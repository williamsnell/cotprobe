Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this attachment disorder question. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment. The options are A through J. I remember that the pattern of attachment refers to a child's attachment style, which can be categorized into secure, insecure, and anxious-avoidant.

An insecure-avoidant child is one who's attached to their parents but feels anxious and avoidant when things get messy. They probably show a lot of negative behaviors, like avoiding contact or seeking comfort elsewhere. So, they might be withdrawing or showing distress when separated.

Looking at the options:

Option A says little distress when separated and turns away. That fits with an anxious-avoidant child because they would avoid contact and feel distressed when they're separated.

Option B is about being more anxious when the mother is away. That sounds more like a secure attachment child, who's withdrawn and avoids contact because they're secure.

Option C is very distressed and continues to be anxious upon separation. That's also insecure, showing distress and avoidance.

Option D says more anxious when present and resists contact. Again, secure behavior.

Option E is distressed but easily comforted. That's more secure but with more positive behavior.

Option F is no preference. Maybe this is a more extreme case, like a child who's really avoiding contact.

Option G is extreme distress and clings. That's an anxious-avoidant showing maximum distress.

Option H is distressed but pulls away. That's a secure-avoidant showing both distress and avoidance.

Option I is indifferent. That's a more secure or maybe an insecure child who doesn't feel strongly about attachment.

Option J is little distress and seeks comfort from a stranger. Hmm, this seems like it's showing a secure attachment because they're seeking comfort, which is a positive behavior.

Wait, the question is about an insecure-avoidant pattern. So, the child might show anxiety and avoidance. Let's think about each option.

Option H says they're distressed and pull away. That fits an anxious-avoidant child who avoids contact but is distressed when separated.

Option G is more distressing than H, showing extreme behavior.

Option J is more secure. The question is about an insecure pattern, so J might not fit.

Another thought: secure-avoidant (I) shows little to nothing, secure. Insecure-avoidant (H) is more anxious and avoids. So, the question is about insecure-avoidant, so H would be the most accurate.

Wait, the initial question is about a pattern of attachment. The options are about what the child does in different situations. So, an insecure-avoidant would show tension, avoidance, and distress when separated.

Looking at the options again, option H says "is very distressed when separated from his/her mother and pulls away from her when she returns." That sounds correct because they avoid contact and feel distressed.

Option G is more distressing than H, but the question is about an insecure pattern, so H is more accurate.

Wait, but option J is seeking comfort from a stranger. That might be more secure behavior. So, the answer is H.

The correct answer is **H: is very distressed when separated from his/her mother and pulls away from her when she returns.**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Pattern:** The child has an insecure-avoidant attachment style, meaning they are attached but show anxiety and avoidance of contact.
2. **Analyzing the Options:**
   - **A, B, D, E, F, I:** These options describe secure or indifferent behavior, which doesn't fit the insecure-avoidant pattern.
   - **C, G, J:** These involve extreme behavior (extreme distress or seeking comfort), which may not fit the pattern.
   - **H:** This describes the insecure-avoidant behavior of being distressed and pulling away upon separation.
3. **Conclusion:** The most accurate description is option H, as it aligns with the child's insecure-avoidant attachment.

**Answer:** H
