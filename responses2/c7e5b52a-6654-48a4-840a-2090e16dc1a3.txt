Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about employment testing and its purpose, particularly regarding educational or socially disadvantaged individuals. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The passage is about the principal effect of a concern—probably a policy or issue—on improving employment opportunities for those who are educationally or socially disadvantaged. The question is asking what this improvement has encouraged in terms of employment testing.

Looking at the options:

A: Intelligence quotient tests
B: norm-referenced test
C: tests that assess physical abilities
D: work-sample types of tests
E: timed tests of a narrow range of abilities
F: personality assessment tests
G: tests based solely on academic performance
H: tests based on social skills

I need to think about what each of these tests typically assesses. Let me remember what each type of test entails.

Intelligence quotient (IQ) tests measure cognitive abilities, which are related to problem-solving and logical reasoning. These are more about human intelligence.

Norm-referenced tests compare an individual's performance to a national or standard sample. So they tell you where you stand relative to others. This might be useful for evaluating performance in specific areas, like in certain jobs.

Physical abilities tests assess strength, balance, coordination, etc. Not sure if this is directly relevant to employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups, unless it's about physical job roles.

Work-sample tests are a type of performance test where participants demonstrate their skills in specific tasks. They assess practical skills, which could be relevant for jobs that require practical application.

Timed tests of a narrow range of abilities might assess something specific, but I'm not sure if this is the primary focus when considering employment testing for disadvantaged individuals.

Tests based on academic performance focus on learning and knowledge, which might be more about academic roles rather than employment opportunities in general.

Tests based on social skills assess things like communication, empathy, and social interactions. These are crucial for job roles that require teamwork, communication, and adaptability.

Now, the principal effect of the concern to improve employment opportunities for disadvantaged individuals. Who would be better off having tests that assess practical skills or workable abilities? Work-sample tests seem to be more about practical skills, which are often needed in many jobs, including those that might be more accessible to those who are educationally or socially disadvantaged. These tests might help in identifying individuals who can adapt and perform well in real-world situations, which is important for employment.

So looking at the options, option D is work-sample types of tests. That sounds relevant because it's a way to assess practical skills, which would help in employment opportunities.

The other options either focus more on academic skills (G and H) or more about performance relative to others (B and A), which might not specifically target disadvantaged groups as effectively as work-sample tests do.

The principal effect of the concern has focused on encouraging the use of work-sample type tests, which assess practical skills and are particularly relevant for improving employment opportunities for disadvantaged individuals by identifying those with adaptable and competent skills.

Answer: D
