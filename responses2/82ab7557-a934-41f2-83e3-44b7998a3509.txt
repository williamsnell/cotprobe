Question:

A housing corporation owned farmland and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the farmland tract. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned "all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants" to a municipal corporation, the city. The community association was then terminated. A chef, the owner of lot 18 in the residential development, proposes to convert his single-family dwelling into a massage parlor. The city asserts an action against the chef to recover money damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the chef?

Options:

A: The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.
B: The Declaration of Covenants is unenforceable because it is overly restrictive.
C: The Declaration of Covenants does not explicitly prohibit the conversion of single-family dwellings into businesses.
D: The chef has the right to use his property as he sees fit, regardless of the Declaration of Covenants.
E: The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.
F: The chef was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants when he bought the property.
G: The assignment of rights to the city was invalid because the community association was terminated.
H: The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.
I: The city is not in privity of estate with community association.

Okay, so I've got this question about property law, specifically about the Covenants in a deed and their enforceability. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that a housing corporation owns farmland and divides it into 100 lots to form a residential community. They created a Development Plan and a Community Association to manage the lots. The Covenants in the Declaration of Covenants set some restrictions. One of them is that single-family homes can't be converted into businesses, like a massage parlor. So the Community Association (CA) assigns all rights, powers, etc., to a municipal corporation, which is now the city.

The chef owns lot 18, which is a single-family residence. He wants to convert it into a massage parlor. The city is suing him for damages. The question is, what's the best argument the chef can make.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which legal principle applies here. I remember that the Covenants in a deed usually create obligations for the Covenants holder. But the key issue is whether the Covenants are enforceable after the Community Association is terminated.

Option A says the restraint is invalid. Restraints in a deed are typically enforceable as they're part of the covenant. So if the Covenants prohibit something, the CA would be bound to enforce it. So A might be a valid argument.

Option B claims the Covenants are too restrictive and unenforceable. That seems off because the Covenants are usually valid; the problem is whether they're enforceable under the circumstances. Termination of the CA might affect that.

Option C says the Covenants don't prohibit single-family homes from being converted to businesses. But the Covenants specifically mention that they can't do so. So C is incorrect.

Option D says the chef can use his property as he likes regardless of the Covenants. That's probably not right because the Covenants explicitly forbid this. The Covenants are part of the deed, so their terms are valid unless the deed is terminated.

Option E is about the burden being in gross. I think that's more about whether the burden of the benefit runs. But the question is about the right to use the property, not the burden. So E might not be relevant here.

Options F and G are about the chef not knowing about the Covenants when buying the property. But the question is about the legal arguments the chef can make, which should be based on the Covenants themselves, not on the facts of the purchase. So F and G might not be the best options.

Option H is similar to E, talking about the burden in gross. Again, this is more about whether the benefit runs, not about the rights the community association has.

Option I says the city isn't in privity with the CA. But the issue is about the enforceability of the Covenants, not about whether the city can buy land from the CA. So I don't think I is the best choice.

Back to the main options. The main point here is whether the Covenants are enforceable after the CA is terminated. Some jurisdictions allow the Covenants to be enforced even if the CA is terminated, especially if the Covenants were enforceable. So the answer would be A: The restraint is invalid.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the Covenants can be terminated and enforced. I think that in some cases, especially with terminating a Covenants holder, the Covenants can still be enforced. So the termination by the CA would not affect the enforceability of the Covenants. Therefore, the restraint is still valid, so A is correct.

Another angle: some jurisdictions have rules about when the Covenants become enforceable. If the CA is terminated, the Covenants may still apply. So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is **A: The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.**

**Explanation:**
The question revolves around the enforceability of a covenant created in a deed, where the Community Association (CA) assigns the rights of the Covenants to another entity. The key issue is whether the Covenants, which prohibit the conversion of single-family homes into businesses, are enforceable even after the CA is terminated. 

The CA's termination does not affect the enforceability of the Covenants. Many jurisdictions hold that the Covenants remain valid even if the CA is terminated, as the Covenants are part of the original deed and their terms are not inherently tied to the CA's termination. Therefore, the restraint on alienation is valid, making option A the correct argument for the chef.
