Okay, so I have this question about property taxes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that a tax of $800 is paid on a property with an assessed value of $20,000. Then the tax rate is increased by 1%, and I need to find out the new tax cost. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, first, I think I need to find out the original tax rate. Because if the tax rate goes up by 1%, the new amount will depend on the new rate. 

So, the original tax is $800 on an assessed value of $20,000. I remember that the tax is calculated based on a percentage, so maybe the tax rate is tax divided by the assessed value.

Let me calculate the original tax rate. So, the formula for tax is:

Tax = ( assessed value ) × ( tax rate )

We know that the tax is $800 and the assessed value is $20,000. So rearranging the formula to find the tax rate:

Tax rate = Tax / Assessed Value

So, that would be 800 divided by 20,000. Let me compute that.

800 / 20,000 = 0.04.

Oh wait, 0.04 is 4%. So the tax rate is 4% before the increase. Now, the rate is increased by 1%, so the new rate is 4% + 1% = 5%.

Now I need to find what the new tax would be if the rate is 5%. The assessed value is still $20,000.

So new tax = assessed value × new tax rate.

Which is 20,000 × 5% = 20,000 × 0.05.

Let me compute that. 20,000 times 0.05 is 1,000. So the new tax would be $1,000.

Wait, but let me double-check. If 4% of 20k is 800, then 5% should be 10% more than 800? Wait no, 5% of 20k is 1,000, which is indeed 200 more than 800. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A is $1,000. So the correct answer should be A.

The assessed value of the property is $20,000, and the original tax is $800. To find the tax rate, divide $800 by $20,000, which gives 4%. Increasing this rate by 1% gives a new rate of 5%. Applying this to the assessed value: 5% of $20,000 equals $1,000. Thus, the new tax cost is $1,000.

Answer: A
