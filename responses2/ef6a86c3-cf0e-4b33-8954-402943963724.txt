Okay, so I've got this question about the energy of an electron and measuring it with a certain precision. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my studies that there's something called the uncertainty principle which relates to the precision of measurements. But wait, the question is about the time it takes to measure the energy with a 1% precision. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. 

The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. And momentum is related to energy via E = pc, since for a free particle, E is the total energy, and p is momentum. So maybe I can relate the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in time.

Wait, time comes into play because the energy is related to the frequency. The energy uncertainty ΔE would relate to the time uncertainty Δt through ΔE = ħ / (Δt). Because the energy of a photon is E = h f, and the frequency is related to time by f = 1/Δt (if Δt is the time uncertainty). So combining these, ΔE = h / (Δt). 

Wait, let me think again. The energy uncertainty equation is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So solving for Δt gives Δt ≥ ħ/(2ΔE). But the problem asks for a 1% precision, so I think it's 1% of the measured energy. So ΔE is 1% of 1e-18 J. Let's calculate that. 

Wait, 1% of 1e-18 is 1e-18 * 0.01 = 1e-20 J. So ΔE is 1e-20 J. Plugging into the formula: Δt ≥ ħ/(2 * 1e-20). What's the value of ħ? Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So:

Δt ≥ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-20 J) ) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-20) ) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-20) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-20) 

Wait, let's compute that. 

1e-34 divided by 2e-20 is (1/(2e14)) ) because 1e-34 / 1e-20 is 1e-14. So 1e-14 /2= 0.5e-14. Wait, no, wait: 1e-34 divided by 2e-20 is (1/2) * 1e-14. Because 1e-34 is (1e-20)*1e-14. So 1e-34 / 2e-20 = (1/2) * 1e-14. So 0.5e-14 s. But wait, the calculation is (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-20) = (1.0545718)/(2) * 1e-14. So 1.0545718 divided by 2 is approximately 0.527286. So 0.527286e-14 seconds, which is 5.27286e-15 seconds. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:5.3e-15 s. But wait, the options have option I as 4.8e-15 s, which is about 4.8e-15. Hmm, why the discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me compute it again more accurately. 

So, 

Δt = ħ/(2 * ΔE) 

ΔE is 1e-20 J. So:

Δt = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-20 J) ) 

So 1e-34 divided by 2e-20 is (1e-14)/2 = 0.5e-14 s. But 1.0545718e-34 divided by 2e-20 is (1.0545718)/(2) ) * 1e-14. 

1.0545718 / 2 = 0.5272859. So 0.5272859e-14 s is 5.272859e-15 seconds. So approximately 5.27e-15 s. 

Looking at the options:

A: 5.3e-15 s (Yes, this is the closest to our calculation.)

But wait, I recall that sometimes the time is expressed in terms of the energy's uncertainty. Is there a different approach using the energy-time uncertainty relation? Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the frequency and then find the time.

Wait, the energy is E = h f, so f = E/(h). If the energy's uncertainty is ΔE, then the frequency uncertainty is Δf = ΔE/h. The time uncertainty Δt is 1/Δf, so Δt = h/(ΔE). 

Wait, wait. If E = h f, then f = E/h. If ΔE is the uncertainty in E, then Δf is ΔE/h. So the time uncertainty Δt is 1/Δf = h/(ΔE). 

So Δt = h / (ΔE) 

Wait, but earlier I had Δt = ħ/(2ΔE) because of the uncertainty principle. Oh, because the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So Δt = ħ/(2ΔE) for the minimal possible time uncertainty. 

So using this formula, with ΔE=1e-20 J,

Δt = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-20 J) ) 

= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-20) 

= (1.0545718 / 2 ) * 1e-14 

= 0.5272859 * 1e-14 s 

= 5.272859e-15 s ≈ 5.3e-15 s.

Which is option A. So that's about 5.3e-15 seconds.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.3e-15 s. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the time required to measure the energy of an electron to a precision of 1%, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates energy uncertainty (ΔE) to time uncertainty (Δt). The principle is expressed as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

where \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant (\(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)). For a 1% precision, the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E = 0.01 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} = 1 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

Substituting into the uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta E}
\]

\[
\Delta t = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-20}} = \frac{1.0545718}{2} \times 10^{-14} \approx 0.5272859 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s} \approx 5.3 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is **option A: \(5.3 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}\)**.
