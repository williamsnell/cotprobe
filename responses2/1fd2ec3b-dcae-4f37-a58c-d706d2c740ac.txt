Question:

A property owner owned a large building in the city. The owner leased the building to a shopkeeper for a period of 20 years at a rental of $10,000 per month. The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted "to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. " One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide "by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. "One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The non-profit organization has a B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. Which of the following is not correct regarding the legal relationship(s) of the various parties?

Options:

A: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper.
B: Privily of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation.

Okay, so I've got this legal question in front of me. Let me try to parse through it step by step. I remember that property law deals with things like ownership, rights, and obligations. The question is about a series of leases and whether certain parties are related legally.

The setup is that a property owner leased a building to a shopkeeper for 20 years at $10,000 per month. The lease says the shopkeeper can't assign it to anyone except a certain kind of corporation. Then a few months later, the shopkeeper leased to a corporation that didn't have the right credit rating. The corporation agreed to pay the shopkeeper $15,000 per month. Then, the corporation took over the building from the shopkeeper and used it for five years, while the shopkeeper also took over. The non-profit organization, which had a B credit rating, was given a non-profit lease, paying $17,500 monthly.

Wait, the question is about the legal relationships. So the options are about whether certain parties have privity of estate or contract.

Let me start by recalling what privity of estate and contract mean. Privity of estate means that two parties are legally related, so they can enter into contracts and have obligations. Privity of contract means that they have the legal right to bind each other's contracts.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Property owner and shopkeeper have privity of estate and contract.

Wait, the first lease between owner and shopkeeper allows the shopkeeper to assign the lease only to corporations with A rating. So that's a credit rating condition. Does that affect privity of contract? The lease is between two entities, so even if there's a credit rating condition, there's a (theoretically) a contract between them. But credit ratings are about the company's financial standing, not necessarily the legal relationship. So I think A is correct because they're related as parties.

Option B: Shopkeeper and corporation have privity of estate and contract.

The second lease is between the shopkeeper and corporation. The corporation didn't have the required credit rating, so the lease was for five years. The corporation agreed to pay $15k for the five years. So the lease between shopkeeper and corporation is valid, so they have privity of estate. Also, they have a contract. So B is correct.

Option C: Property owner and corporation have privity of estate but not contract.

Wait, the first lease was between owner and shopkeeper, and the second between shopkeeper and corporation. So the property owner and corporation aren't directly involved in a lease. So the property owner doesn't have a contract with the corporation. So their privity of estate exists, but not contract. So option C is correct.

Option D: Neither party has privity of estate nor contract with the nonprofit organization.

Let me think. The non-profit organization was taken over by the corporation, which was part of the five-year lease. So the corporation was part of the property owner's interest. But what about the non-profit organization? It was leased by the corporation, but since the company is part of the property owner's business, the corporation is within the same estate as the property owner. So the non-profit organization is part of the property owner's business. But does the property owner have a contract with the non-profit organization? I don't think so because the only contracts were between the property owner and shopkeeper, and between shopkeeper and corporation. The non-profit organization wasn't part of any of those. So the property owner and the non-profit organization don't have a contract. As for privity of estate, yes, because the non-profit is part of the property owner's business.

Wait, but the question is about whether these parties have privity of estate and contract. The options are asking which is NOT correct.

The question is which is NOT correct. So let's list each option.

Option A: Correct. Property owner and shopkeeper have both privity of estate and contract.

Option B: Correct. Shopkeeper and corporation have both.

Option C: Correct. Property owner and corporation have estate (since no direct lease) but no contract.

Option D: The question is, is D correct or not? The question is which is not correct.

Wait, the question states: "Which of the following is not correct regarding the legal relationship(s) of the various parties?"

So all options are claims about privity of estate or contract. The correct answer is the one that's not correct.

Looking back, the question: The last person's options are about whether these parties have privity and contract. So which option is incorrect.

Looking at the last part: The non-profit organization was part of the property owner's business. But is there a contract between the property owner and the non-profit?

Probably not, because the only contracts are owner-Shopkeeper and Shopkeeper-Corporation. The non-profit is a separate entity, not part of any contract.

So, the non-profit organization has privity of estate with the property owner, but no contract. So regarding the option D: "Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization." Is this correct?

Yes, because the property owner and the nonprofit aren't legally related. So their privity of estate exists (since the nonprofit is part of the property owner's business), but there's no contract. So D's statement is correct. But wait, the question is which is not correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is incorrect. The options are statements about privity of estate and contract.

Wait, the question is about whether each option is correct or not, and which is incorrect.

Wait, the options are:

A: Correct (property owner and shopkeeper have both estate and contract).

B: Correct (shopkeeper and corporation have both).

C: Correct (property owner and corporation have estate, not contract).

D: Neither estate nor contract, so between the property owner and the nonprofit.

But wait, the property owner and the nonprofit organization are not directly involved in any contract. So D's statement says neither estate nor contract exists. Which is correct because they aren't legally related.

So all options are correct except one. Wait, but the question is asking which is not correct, so the incorrect statement is the answer.

Wait, looking back, the options:

Option D: "Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization."

Wait, does "privity of estate" exist? The property owner and the nonprofit are part of the same business, so yes, they have privity of estate. So D's statement is incorrect because it says neither exists, which is wrong. Because they have some estate.

Wait, no, because privity of estate is the legal right to bind each other, which exists. So D's statement is wrong. So the question is which option is NOT correct. So D is not correct because privity of estate exists between them.

Wait, the question is which is not correct. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait, another angle. The non-profit organization is part of the property owner's business. So the property owner has a right to control the business, but they don't have a contract with the non-profit. So privity of estate is correct, but contract is not. So D's statement is correct. So the not correct option is D, which claims that neither exists, which is incorrect because privity of estate does exist.

Wait, let me rephrase the options:

A: Both privity of estate and contract. Correct.

B: Both. Correct.

C: Property owner and corporation have estate but not contract. Correct.

D: Neither estate nor contract. Incorrect, because estate exists.

So the question is which option is NOT correct. The incorrect option is D because privity of estate exists between them.

But wait, the question is about which is not correct. Let me re-examine all the options.

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me outline each option.

Option A: Correct.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Correct.

Option D: Incorrect, because the property owner and the non-profit organization have privity of estate but not contract. So the statement in D is correct, but the question is which is not correct. So if D is correct, then the incorrect option is none. But I think I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the non-profit organization is not part of any contract with the property owner, right? So D's statement that neither exists is correct. So D's option is correct, so the incorrect statement is another option. So which is not correct?

Wait, the question is asking which is not correct. Let's look at each option in terms of whether it is correct.

Which of the following is not correct.

So which option is incorrect.

Option D states: neither estate nor contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.

But as I said, the property owner and the nonprofit have privity of estate, so D is incorrect. But wait, that can't be because the question is which is not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the question.

Wait, the question is: "Which of the following is not correct regarding the legal relationship(s) of the various parties?"

Wait, so the options are statements about the parties. The correct answer is the option that is incorrect.

So the incorrect statement is the one that is not correct.

So reviewing each option:

A: Correct. Property and shopkeeper have both.

B: Correct. Shopkeeper and corporation have both.

C: Correct. Property owner and corporation have estate, not contract.

D: Incorrect. Property owner and non-profit have estate, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which is not correct. So the correct answer is D, because it's the only incorrect statement.

Wait, but the question is about the legal relationships. So the correct answer is D, which is not correct. Because the property owner and non-profit organization do have some estate, so D is wrong.

Wait, but wait another thought. What about the privity of contract? If the two are not party to a contract, then their privity of contract doesn't exist.

So in D's option, privity of estate exists (the property owner has the organization as part of their business), but contract doesn't. So D's statement is correct.

So the only incorrect option is D. So the answer is D.
</think>

The question revolves around determining which legal relationship statement is not correct regarding the parties involved. The key is to analyze each option based on privity of estate and privity of contract.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Option A**: "Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper."  
   - The lease agreement allows the shopkeeper to assign it to a corporation unless it is an A-rated credit-rated corporation. However, privity of contract exists because the parties are legally bound to their agreements.  
   - **Conclusion**: Correct.

2. **Option B**: "Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation."  
   - The second lease is valid, and there is no credit rating condition affecting privity of contract.  
   - **Conclusion**: Correct.

3. **Option C**: "Privity of estate exists between the property owner and the corporation, but no privity of contract does."  
   - The property owner and corporation are not directly involved in a lease. Their privity of estate exists because the corporation is part of the property owner's business. However, no contract exists because there is no lease between them.  
   - **Conclusion**: Correct.

4. **Option D**: "Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization."  
   - The property owner and the nonprofit organization have privity of estate (as the nonprofit is part of the property owner's business).  
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect because privity of estate exists.

### Final Answer:
The incorrect statement is **D**, as the property owner and the nonprofit organization do have privity of estate.
