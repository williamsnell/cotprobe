Okay, so I've got this question here about markup percentages. Let me see what it says. It says that an item called Atepdellsells for $200, and the dollar markup is $80. I need to find the percent markup based on the selling price, and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on markup terms, but I'll try to work through this step by step. Markup usually refers to the amount added to the cost to get the selling price, right? So, in this case, the markup is $80, and the selling price is $200.

Wait, when they say "dollar markup," that's the amount you add to the cost to get to the selling price. So, if the cost is C, then Selling Price (SP) = Cost (C) + Markup. So, SP = C + 80. But the SP given is $200, so that means C = SP - 80. So, C = 200 - 80 = $120. So the cost is $120.

But the question is about the markup percentage based on the selling price. So, markup percentage is calculated as (Markup / Selling Price) * 100%. So, plugging in the numbers, that's (80 / 200) * 100%.

Let me calculate that. 80 divided by 200 is 0.4. Multiply by 100% gives 40%. So the markup percentage based on the selling price is 40%.

Looking at the options, option A is 40%. So that should be the correct answer.

The markup percentage based on the selling price is calculated as (Markup / Selling Price) * 100%. Here, the markup is $80 and the selling price is $200. So, 80 / 200 = 0.4, which is 40%.
