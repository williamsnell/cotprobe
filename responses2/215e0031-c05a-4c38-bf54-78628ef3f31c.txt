Okay, so I've got this problem here about the vibrational frequency of I2 and the population in the first excited state. Hmm, I need to find the temperature where the excited state population is half the ground state. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the vibrational states of molecules can be treated using the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the Boltzmann distribution is the ratio of the populations of two states. In this case, the ground state (n=0) and the first excited state (n=1) are involved.

The Boltzmann factor is given by the equation: 
P1 / P0 = (g1 / g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)),
where g1 and g0 are the statistical weights of the excited and ground states, and ΔE is the energy difference between them. 

Wait, but wait—what are the statistical weights for vibrational states? Oh right, for harmonic oscillators, the statistical weight for a vibrational state n is g_n = (2n+1) * g_0. But since we're only dealing with n=0 and n=1 here, the statistical weights are g_0 = 1 (since 2*0+1=1) and g_1 = 3. So the ratio g1/g0 is 3/1=3.

So plugging into the formula: P1/P0 = 3 * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

We are told that the population in the first excited state is half that of the ground state. That means P1/P0 = 1/2.

So setting up the equation: 
1/2 = 3 * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, let me double-check that. Because sometimes the ground state can have a statistical weight of 1, and the excited state 3, so the ratio would be 3. So the equation is correct as written.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because if the ground state is n=0, then the energy levels are E_0 and E_1 = E_0 + ΔE. So the population ratio P1/P0 = (g1/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, actually, when considering the statistical weight, for each transition, the energy difference is ΔE = E1 - E0 = hν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. So in the case of I2, the vibrational frequency ν is given as 208 cm⁻¹. But wait, wait—no, wait. That frequency is in reciprocal centimeters, and I remember that the energy in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) is related to frequency (in cm⁻¹) by E = h c ν̄, where ν̄ is the wavenumber in reciprocal centimeters. But wait, actually, the energy in terms of wavenumbers can be related via the equation E = h c (ν̄), where ν̄ is in cm⁻¹. Alternatively, since the wavenumber is related to frequency by ν = c ν̄, where c is the speed of light. But perhaps a better approach is to convert the wavenumber into energy in Joules.

Alternatively, the frequency of vibration can be calculated from the wavenumber. So the vibrational frequency ν is given by ν = c * ν̄, where c is the speed of light (approx. 3e10 cm/s). So ν = 3e10 cm/s * 208 cm⁻¹ = 6.24e12 s⁻¹. Wait, but wait—this gives the frequency in Hz. But wait, I think that's correct. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 3e10 cm/s * 208 cm⁻¹ is (3e10) * 208 = 6.24e12 s⁻¹. So the frequency is 6.24e12 s⁻¹. So the energy difference ΔE would be equal to h * ν. h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ΔE = hν = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.24e12 s⁻¹. Let's compute that. 6.626e-34 * 6.24e12 = (6.626 *6.24) e-22. 6.626 *6 is about 39.756, and 0.24*6.626 is about 1.590. So total is around 41.346, so 4.1346e-23 J. Hmm. But wait, wait—wait, I have to be careful with units. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so let's convert ΔE into eV.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since I know that the vibrational frequency ν is given in cm⁻¹, I can directly relate it to the energy in wavenumbers. Because for a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. But since the wavenumber is given, and ν = c ν̄, perhaps there's a relation between the wavenumber and the energy in terms of cm⁻¹.

But maybe it's easier to use the relation that for the vibrational partition function, the energy is given in terms of cm⁻¹. The formula I remember is that the partition function Z is approximately given by a sum over n of (2n+1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)). But here, we're using the Boltzmann distribution. So the ratio P1/P0 = (g1/g0) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck, so let's re-express the equation properly.

Given: P1 = (1/2) P0.

So,

P1/P0 = 1/2 = (g1/g0) exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

We know that g1 = 3, g0 =1; so 3 exp(-ΔE/(kT)) = 1/2.

So, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) = (1/2)/3 = 1/(6) ≈ 0.1667.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: 

-ΔE/(k T) = ln(1/6) ≈ -1.7918.

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T) = 1.7918.

So, T = ΔE / (k * 1.7918).

Now, I need to compute ΔE in terms of k.

Wait, but I think that because the wavenumber ν̄ is in cm⁻¹, the energy can be calculated as E = h c ν̄. But let me think. Alternatively, using the relation that the energy in wavenumbers is E (cm⁻¹) * h c (in J·s·m/s·cm) → Wait, maybe a better approach is to express ΔE in terms of ν.

Wait, considering that the wavenumber ν̄ is related to the frequency ν by ν = c ν̄, where c is the speed of light (3e10 cm/s). So the frequency ν is in cm⁻¹ multiplied by c.

So, ν = c ν̄.

The energy E is h * ν = h c ν̄.

But I'm not sure about the exact units here. Let's compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is 3e10 cm/s.

ν̄ is 208 cm⁻¹.

So, ν = 3e10 cm/s * 208 cm⁻¹ = 6.24e12 s⁻¹.

Then, E = hν = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.24e12 s⁻¹ = let me calculate that.

6.626e-34 * 6.24e12 = 6.626 *6.24 = about 41.34, and 1e-34 *1e12=1e-22. So E = 4.134e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, that's in Joules. I need to convert it to eV because the Boltzmann constant k is usually expressed in eV.

Because 1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J. So E (in eV) = E (J) / (1.602e-19).

So, E = 4.134e-23 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.58e-4 eV.

Wait, that's a very small energy. But wait, that can't be right because the vibrational frequency of I2 is 208 cm⁻¹, which is a pretty high frequency. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the unit conversion?

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Wait, I'm getting E = h c ν̄, but maybe I should have used the relation E = h c ν̄. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the wavenumber is in reciprocal centimeters; the energy in wavenumbers multiplied by h c gives the energy in Joules. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, but 4.134e-23 J is 0.0258 eV. That's about 2.6 eV, which for the vibrational frequency is quite high. But wait, the given frequency is 208 cm⁻¹, which is a huge number. Wait, 208 cm⁻¹ is about 1.5e13 Hz, which is a high frequency, but the energy corresponding to that would be h times that frequency. Let me calculate hν for ν=208 cm⁻¹.

Compute hν: h is 6.626e-34 J·s, ν = 208 * 3e10 cm/s → 208 * 3e10 = 6.24e12 cm/s.

So, hν = 6.626e-34 * 6.24e12 = (6.626 *6.24) e-22 ≈ 41.34e-22 J → 4.134e-21 J. To convert to eV: 4.134e-21 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 0.0258 eV, which is about 2.58 eV. So that's correct.

So the energy difference ΔE is about 2.58 eV. But wait, wait, that can't be right because the question is asking for the temperature where the population ratio is 1/2. But let's proceed step by step.

Wait, so back to T = ΔE/(k * 1.7918). Let's compute each part.

First, k is the Boltzmann constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

ΔE is 0.0258 eV.

So, T = 0.0258 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 1.7918).

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 * 1.7918 ≈ 8.617 * 1.7918 ≈ let's calculate that.

8 *1.7918 = 14.3344, 0.617 * 1.7918 ≈ approx 1.111. So total ≈ 15.445 → 1.5445e-4.

But wait, wait: 8.617e-5 * 1.7918 → 8.617 *1.7918 = approx 15.445 → 15.445e-5 → 0.00015445.

So, T = 0.0258 / 0.00015445 → let me compute that.

0.0258 divided by 0.00015445 → 0.0258 / 0.00015445 ≈ 167.3 K.

Wait, that's about 167 K. Looking at the options, I don't see that. Oh wait, option E is 600 K, option B is 360 K. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the conversion of ΔE to eV. Let me recompute.

Wait, E = h c ν̄, where ν̄ is in cm⁻¹.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e10 cm/s.

ν̄ = 208 cm⁻¹.

So E (in J) = h * c * ν̄ = 6.626e-34 * 3e10 * 208.

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23 J·s * cm/s → Wait, cm is 1e-2 m, but perhaps I should think in terms of cm and s. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

E = h * c * ν̄ → 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e10 cm/s * 208 cm⁻¹.

Wait, but cm and cm⁻¹ are reciprocal units. So cm * cm⁻¹ = 1. So the units are:

J·s * (cm/s) * (1/cm) → J * s * cm/s * cm⁻¹ → J * (s * cm/s) * cm⁻¹ → J * (cm⁻¹) → J/(m⁻1)?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just compute the numbers.

6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23 (J·s * cm/s) → which is J·cm.

Wait, because s and cm/s cancel: s * cm/s → cm.

So 1.9878e-23 J·cm.

Multiply by 208 cm⁻¹:

E = 1.9878e-23 * 208 → 1.9878e-23 * 2e2= 3.9756e-21, but wait, 208 is 200 +8 → 200*1.9878e-23 = 3.9756e-21, 8*1.9878e-23= 1.590e-22 → total ≈ 4.1346e-21 J.

So E = 4.1346e-21 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E (eV) = (4.1346e-21 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 0.0258 eV.

So, ΔE is about 0.0258 eV.

Now, plugging into T = ΔE/(k * 1.7918).

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, denominator: 8.617e-5 eV/K * 1.7918 ≈ 8.617 * 1.7918 → let's compute that.

8 * 1.7918 = 14.3344.

0.617 *1.7918 ≈ 1.110.

So total is 15.444 → 15.444e-5 → 0.00015444 eV/K.

So, T = 0.0258 eV / 0.00015444 eV/K → let's compute that.

0.0258 / 0.00015444 → 0.0258 ÷ 0.00015444 ≈ 167.3 K.

Hmm, that's approximately 167 K. But looking at the options, I don't see any close to 167 K except perhaps option B (360 K) and D (325 K), but not A (600 K). Wait, but wait—maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I think I got the formula wrong. Let me re-examine the equation.

The ratio P1/P0 should be (g1/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but wait, the correct formula is P1/P0 = (g1/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I mixed up ΔE and k. Let me double-check:

Let me compute k*T: 8.617e-5 eV/K * 167 K = 8.617e-5 * 167 → 8.617 * 0.00167= 0.01447 → 0.01447 eV.

Wait, but 0.01447 eV is 1.447e-2 eV. But I'm getting ΔE/(kT) as 1.7918.

Wait, because from the equation, ΔE/(k T) = 1.7918.

Wait, if I compute k*T = 8.617e-5 * 167.3 ≈ 0.01447 eV.

Wait, but 0.01447 eV is approximately 1.447e-2 eV. But then, 1.447e-2 / 1.602e-19 → that's (1.447e-2) / (1.602e-19) ) = 8.8e16 K, which is way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of T. Let me recompute T.

T = ΔE/(k * 1.7918)

ΔE = 0.0258 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So,

T = (0.0258) / (8.617e-5 * 1.7918) → Let's compute the denominator first.

8.617e-5 * 1.7918 → 8.617 *1.7918 = let's compute that.

8 *1.7918 =14.3344, 0.617*1.7918= approx 1.111. So total is 15.445 → 15.445e-5 → 0.00015445.

So denominator is 0.00015445.

So T = 0.0258 / 0.00015445 → 0.0258 / 0.00015445 → Let's compute 0.0258 ÷ 0.00015445.

Wait, 0.00015445 is 1.5445e-4.

So 0.0258 / 1.5445e-4 → 0.0258 / 0.00015445 = 0.0258 * (1/0.00015445) → 0.0258 * 6482 → approximately 167 K.

Hmm, that's the same result as before. But that's not matching any of the given options. So, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE.

Wait, perhaps I was supposed to use the vibrational frequency ν in cm⁻¹, and calculate ΔE as h c ν. Let me try that approach.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

c is 3e10 cm/s.

ν = 208 cm⁻¹.

So, E = h * c * ν → 6.626e-34 * 3e10 * 208.

Let me compute this.

6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23 J.

Multiply by 208: 1.9878e-23 * 208 = approx 4.134e-21 J.

Convert to eV: 4.134e-21 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV → approx 0.0258 eV.

So, this brings us back to the same calculation. So that's 0.0258 eV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for the Boltzmann factor. Let me recheck the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the ratio P1/P0 = (g1/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Which is correct. So, the equation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken into account that the ground state (n=0) has a statistical weight of 1, and the first excited state (n=1) has a statistical weight of 3. So g1/g0 is 3/1 =3.

So, the equation is 1/2 = 3 exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, 1/2 = 3 exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Divide both sides by 3:

(1/2)/3 = 1/(6) ≈ 0.1667.

So, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) = 0.1667 → take natural log: -ΔE/(k T) = ln(0.1667) → ln(1/6) → about -1.7918.

So,

ΔE/(k T) = 1.7918 → T = ΔE/(k * 1.7918).

Which gives T ≈ 167 K.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps the equation should be:

P1/P0 = (g1/g0) exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

Because the higher energy state is more populated. So, for P1 to be 1/2 of P0, the exponent must be negative. So, the equation is correct.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the ratio in the opposite way. Let me double-check.

If P1 is half of P0, then P0 is twice P1. So, P1 = (1/2) P0 → P0 = 2 P1.

So, in terms of the equation, P0/P1 = 2 → (g0/g1) exp( ΔE/(k T) ) = 2.

Because, g0/g1 is 1/3, so 1/3 * exp(ΔE/(k T)) = 2.

Wait, no, the equation is P0 / P1 = (g0/g1) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So, 2 = (1/3) exp(ΔE/(k T)) → exp(ΔE/(k T)) = 6 → ΔE/(k T) = ln(6) → 1.7918 → same as before.

So, same result. Therefore, T = 167 K. But that's not an option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE. Let me recompute.

Wait, E = h c ν̄ → h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e10 cm/s, ν̄=208 cm⁻¹.

So E = 6.626e-34 * 3e10 * 208 → Let me compute this step by step.

6.626e-34 * 3e10 = (6.626 * 3) e(-34 +10) → 19.878e-24 J.

Multiply by 208 → 19.878e-24 * 208 → 19.878 * 208 = 4134. So, 4134e-24 J → 4.134e-21 J.

So, E is 4.134e-21 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E (eV) = 4.134e-21 / 1.602e-19 = approx 0.0258 eV.

Hmm, same as before. So, it's 0.0258 eV.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used the equation T = (ΔE/(k)) * ln(1/(P1/P0)) )

Wait, because from the equation, (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, (P1/P0) = (3/1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, 1/2 = 3 exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Which again gives ΔE/(k T) = ln(6) → 1.7918. So same result.

Hmm. So, the temperature is approximately 167 K, but this is not among the options. So, I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the equation for the partition function, which might take into account the degeneracy.

Wait, no, I think I used the correct approach. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE. Let me compute it again.

E = h c ν̄ → 6.626e-34 * 3e10 * 208.

Compute 6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23 J.

Multiply by 208: 1.9878e-23 *208 = 4.134e-21 J.

Convert to eV: 4.134e-21 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 0.0258 eV.

Hmm, same result. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula that I'm using. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the correct ratio is (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But perhaps I should have taken the ratio the other way around.

Wait, suppose I set up the ratio as P0/P1 = (g0/g1) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

In this case, with P0/P1 = 2 → (1/3) * exp(ΔE/(k T)) = 2 → exp(ΔE/(k T)) = 6 → ΔE/(k T) = ln(6) → same result.

So, same calculation. So, the temperature is 167 K.

Looking at the options, I don't see that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute T again.

T = ΔE / (k * ln(6/(P1/P0)) )

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula differently. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The ratio of populations is given by (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(P1/P0) = ln(g1/g0) - ΔE/(k T)

Rearranged:

ΔE/(k T) = ln(g1/g0) - ln(P1/P0)

So,

ΔE/(k T) = ln(g1/g0) - ln(P1/P0)

So, T = ΔE / [k ( ln(g1/g0) - ln(P1/P0) ) ]

In our case, P1/P0 = 1/2 → ln(P1/P0) = ln(1/2) = -0.6931.

So,

ΔE/(k T) = ln(3) - (-0.6931) → ln(3) is 1.0986 → 1.0986 + 0.6931 = 1.7917.

So, same as before.

So, T = ΔE / (k * 1.7917 )

Which is 0.0258 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 1.7917) → 0.0258 / (8.617 * 1.7917e-5) → Let me compute the denominator:

8.617 * 1.7917 ≈ 15.445 → 15.445e-5 → 0.00015445.

So, T= 0.0258 / 0.00015445 → 167 K.

So, same result.

Hmm, but the options don't include this value. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula without the natural log, but that would change the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the equation:

ln(P1/P0) = ln(g1/g0) - ΔE/(k T)

Which is the same as before.

So, solving for T gives the same result.

Hmm, maybe I should have considered that the ratio is (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula:

T = (ΔE)/(k) * ln( (g0/g1) / (P1/P0) )

Which would be another approach.

Wait, let's try this.

T = (ΔE)/(k) * ln( (g0/g1) / (P1/P0) )

In our case, g0/g1 = 1/3, P1/P0 = 1/2 → (g0/g1)/(P1/P0) = (1/3)/(1/2) )= 2/3.

So, ln(2/3) = ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055.

So,

T = (0.0258 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) * (-0.4055) → 

Wait, no, that's not the right approach.

Wait, no, the formula is T = (ΔE)/(k) * ln( (g0/g1) / (P1/P0) )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me rederive it.

From the equation:

ln(P1/P0) = ln(g1/g0) - (ΔE)/(k T)

Rearranged:

ln(g1/g0) - ln(P1/P0) = (ΔE)/(k T)

So,

(ΔE)/(k T) = ln(g1/g0) - ln(P1/P0 )

→ T = ΔE / [k ( ln(g1/g0) - ln(P1/P0) ) ]

In our problem:

g1/g0 = 3, so ln(3) ≈1.0986.

P1/P0 = 1/2 → ln(1/2) = -0.6931.

So,

ln(g1/g0) - ln(P1/P0) = 1.0986 - (-0.6931) = 1.0986 + 0.6931 = 1.7917.

So,

T = (0.0258 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 1.7917 )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 * 1.7917 ≈ 0.00015445 eV/K.

So,

T = 0.0258 / 0.00015445 → 167 K.

Same result.

Hmm, but none of the options match this value. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula once more.

The correct formula is:

P1/P0 = (g1/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Where ΔE = h c ν̄.

So, for P1/P0 = 1/2,

1/2 = (g1/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

→ (g1/g0) = 3 → 3 * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) = 1/2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) = 1/6 → -ΔE/(k T) = ln(1/6) = -1.7918 → ΔE/(k T) = 1.7918 → T = ΔE/(k * 1.7918 )

So, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in the value of ν̄.

Wait, is ν̄ the vibrational frequency or the wavenumber? Wait, no, in the formula, ν̄ is the vibrational frequency. But wait, in the problem, ν̄ is given as the wavenumber, which is 208 cm⁻¹. So, perhaps I should have used the wavenumber instead of the frequency.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the partition function includes the degeneracy and the vibrational frequency.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Z = 2 (1 + g1 exp(-ν̄ k T) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the formula for the vibrational partition function, which includes the degeneracy and the wavenumber.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the vibrational partition function. Let me try to derive it.

The partition function Z is given by the sum over all states of exp(-E/(k T)).

In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) hbar ω, where ω is the angular frequency.

The degeneracy g_n is the number of states at energy level E_n.

In our case, the vibrational frequency is given by ν̄ = 208 cm⁻¹, which is the wavenumber. So, the angular frequency ω is related to ν̄ by ω = 2π ν̄.

Wait, no, wait. The wavenumber ν̄ is the number of cycles per cm. So, the frequency ν is ν̄ * (1 cm / 1 cm) → ν̄ is in cm⁻¹. So, the angular frequency ω is 2π ν̄.

So, ω = 2π ν̄ → ω = 2π * 208 cm⁻¹.

So, E_n = (n + 1/2) hbar ω → E_n = (n + 1/2) hbar (2π ν̄).

But perhaps, the correct way is to use the formula for the partition function in terms of the degeneracy and the vibrational frequency.

Wait, the vibrational partition function for a harmonic oscillator is:

Z = g0 (1 + g1 exp(- ω k T) )

Where g0 is the degeneracy at the ground state, and g1 is the degeneracy at the first excited state.

In our case, g0 = 1 (since it's a single state), and g1 = 3 (since n can be 0, 1, 2).

So, the partition function Z is:

Z = 1 * (1 + 3 exp(- ω k T) )

= 1 + 3 exp( - ω k T )

The ratio P1/P0 is given by:

P1 = (3/1) Z1 / Z0

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps the ratio is (P1)/(P0) = (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0) ?

No, perhaps I'm confusing the partition function and the population ratio.

Wait, the ratio of the populations is given by (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0).

Wait, perhaps let me think again. The partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-E/(k T)). 

The population ratio P1/P0 is the ratio of the populations of state 1 and state 0.

The population of state i is Pi = (g_i) Z_i / Z_total, where Z_i is the partition function for state i.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of the populations is (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0).

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0).

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should use the partition function formula, as it's more straightforward.

The partition function Z is:

Z = sum_{i} g_i exp( -E_i/(k T) )

For our case, the ground state (n=0) has g0=1 and E0= (1/2) hbar ω.

The first excited state (n=1) has g1=3 and E1= (3/2) hbar ω.

The second excited state (n=2) has g2=6 and E2= (5/2) hbar ω.

Wait, but perhaps for the purposes of the partition function, we only consider the degeneracy and the vibrational state, not the energy level itself.

So, the partition function Z is:

Z = g0 * exp( -E0/(k T) ) + g1 * exp( -E1/(k T) ) + g2 * exp( -E2/(k T) )

In our case, g0=1, E0= (1/2) hbar ω.

g1=3, E1= (3/2) hbar ω.

g2=6, E2= (5/2) hbar ω.

So,

Z = 1 * exp( - (1/2) hbar ω / (k T) ) + 3 * exp( - (3/2) hbar ω / (k T) ) +6 * exp( - (5/2) hbar ω / (k T) )

Now, the ratio P1/P0 is given by the ratio of the populations of state 1 and state 0.

The population Pi is given by:

Pi = (g_i) * (Z_i) / (Z_total)

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the population is proportional to the partition function.

Wait, perhaps the population of state i is Pi = (g_i) Z_i / Z_total, where Z_i is the partition function for state i.

So, for state 0 (n=0), Z0 = g0 * exp( - E0/(k T) ) = 1 * exp( - (1/2) hbar ω / (k T) )

For state 1 (n=1), Z1 = g1 * exp( - (3/2) hbar ω / (k T) )

For state 2 (n=2), Z2 = g2 * exp( - (5/2) hbar ω / (k T) )

So, the population of state 1 is P1 = (g1) Z1 / Z_total, where Z_total = Z0 + Z1 + Z2.

Similarly, P0 = (g0) Z0 / Z_total.

So, the ratio P1/P0 is:

(P1/P0) = (g1 Z1) / (g0 Z0) ) )

Because P1 = (g1 Z1) / Z_total, P0 = (g0 Z0) / Z_total.

So, (P1/P0) = (g1 Z1) / (g0 Z0)

= (3 * Z1) / (1 * Z0 )

= 3 Z1 / Z0

Hmm, so in our problem, (P1/P0) = 3 * (Z1/Z0 )

We need to find (Z1/Z0 ), which is:

Z1 =3 exp( - (3/2) hbar ω / (k T) )

Z0 =1 exp( - (1/2) hbar ω / (k T) )

So,

Z1/Z0 = 3 exp( - (3/2) hbar ω / (k T) + (1/2) hbar ω / (k T) )

= 3 exp( - (1) hbar ω / (k T) )

Because (3/2 - 1/2) =1.

So,

Z1/Z0 =3 exp( - hbar ω / (k T) )

Now, hbar ω is equal to Planck's constant multiplied by the angular frequency, which is h * ν. Since ω=2π ν, but ν̄=208 cm⁻¹, which is the wavenumber. So, ω=2π ν̄.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate hbar ω to h ν̄.

Wait, hbar = h / (2π), so hbar ω = (h/(2π)) * ω.

Since ω =2π ν̄, this gives hbar ω = (h/(2π)) * 2π ν̄ = h ν̄.

So, hbar ω = h ν̄.

Thus,

Z1/Z0 =3 exp( - h ν̄ / (k T) )

Now, the population ratio is (P1/P0) =3 * (Z1/Z0 )

So,

(P1/P0)= 3 * 3 exp( - h ν̄/(k T) )

= 9 exp( - h ν̄/(k T) )

Wait, but earlier, we had another approach where (P1/P0)=1/2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the partition function approach versus the population ratio approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use the formula for the population ratio (P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0 )

And to compute Z1 and Z0.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula in terms of the partition function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set the ratio (P1/P0)=1/2 and solve for T.

Wait, perhaps that's the way to proceed. Let me try again.

Earlier, I calculated (P1/P0) =1/2.

Which led to T=167 K.

But that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the correct formula for the partition function, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for the partition function with the degeneracy and the frequency, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula:

Z = g0 (1 + g1 exp( - ν̄ k T) )

But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the vibrational partition function, which is:

Z = 2 (1 + g1 exp( - ν̄ k T) )

But perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

Z = 2 (1 + g1 * exp( - ν̄ k T) )

Where g1 is the degeneracy at the first excited state.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Z = g0 (1 + g1 exp(- ν̄ k T) )

In any case, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see where it leads me.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the same approach but included the correct formula for the partition function.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

Z = g0 (1 + g1 exp(- ν̄ k T) )

So,

Z =1*(1 +3 exp( - ν̄ k T) )

=1 +3 exp( - ν̄ k T )

Now, the ratio P1/P0 is given by:

(P1/P0) = (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0 )

But since Z1 is the partition function for state 1, which is g1 * exp( - E1/(k T) )

So, Z1 =3 exp( -E1/(k T) )

Similarly, Z0=1 exp( -E0/(k T) )

So, (Z1/Z0) =3 exp( - E1/(k T) + E0/(k T) )

E1 = (3/2) hbar ω

E0= (1/2) hbar ω

So,

E1 =3/2 * hbar ω

E0= 1/2 * hbar ω

So,

E1 - E0 = (3/2 -1/2) hbar ω = hbar ω

So,

(E1/(k T)) - (E0/(k T)) = (hbar ω) / (k T)

Thus,

exp( (E1 - E0)/(k T) ) = exp( hbar ω / (k T) )

Wait, no, because E1 - E0 = hbar ω.

Wait, but E1 = (3/2) hbar ω, E0=(1/2) hbar ω.

So,

E1 - E0= (3/2 -1/2 ) hbar ω= hbar ω.

So,

E1 - E0 = hbar ω.

So,

E1 - E0 = hbar ω.

Thus,

(E1 - E0)/(k T) = hbar ω / (k T)

So,

exp( (E1 - E0)/(k T) ) = exp( hbar ω / (k T) )

But in the Z1/Z0 ratio, we have:

(Z1/Z0) =3 exp( - (E1/(k T) - E0/(k T) ) )

=3 exp( - (E1 - E0)/(k T) )

=3 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

So, (Z1/Z0)=3 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

Now, (P1/P0)= (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0 )

=3 * 3 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

=9 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

But earlier, when I calculated (P1/P0)=1/2, I got T=167 K.

So, perhaps I should set (P1/P0)=1/2 and solve for T.

But perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (P1/P0)= (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0 )

But perhaps it's (P1/P0)= (g1/g0) * (Z1/Z0 )

But in this case, since Z1/Z0=3 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

So, (P1/P0)=3 * 3 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

=9 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

But if (P1/P0)=1/2, then:

1/2=9 exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )

→ exp( - hbar ω/(k T) )=1/(18)

→ -hbar ω/(k T)= ln(1/18)= -4.407

→ hbar ω/(k T)=4.407

→ T= (hbar ω)/(k) * (1/4.407 )

But hbar ω= h * ν̄.

Because hbar= h/(2π), so hbar ω= (h/(2π)) * ν̄.

Wait, ν̄ is in cm⁻¹. So, ω=2π ν̄.

Thus, hbar ω= (h/(2π)) * 2π ν̄= h ν̄.

So, hbar ω= h ν̄.

So,

T= (h ν̄ )/(k) * (1/4.407 )

Compute this:

h=6.626e-34 J s

ν̄=208 cm⁻¹ =208 /100 m⁻¹ =2.08e2 m⁻¹

k=1.987e-3 J/K
