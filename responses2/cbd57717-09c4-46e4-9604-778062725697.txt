Question:

The police received an anonymous tip informing them that a pharmacist was engaged in the illegal manufacture of synthetic cocaine. As part of its investigation, the police placed an electronic tracking device on the pharmacist's car. The tracking device was attached to the underbody of the pharmacist's car while it was parked outside his home. The police did not secure a warrant before installing the device. By means of the tracking device, the police were able to trail the pharmacist's movements. The police followed the pharmacist every day for almost a month. Finally, one day the police tracked the pharmacist's car to a vacant warehouse on the outskirts of town. While the pharmacist was inside the building, the police peered in the window and saw drug paraphernalia and equipment used in the manufacture of synthetic cocaine. Based on these observations, the police secured a search warrant and gained entry into the building. Once inside, the police arrested the pharmacist and confiscated a large quantity of synthetic cocaine that had just been produced. At his trial for illegal possession and manufacture of a controlled dangerous substance, the pharmacist moves to suppress the cocaine confiscated by the police. The pharmacist's motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police acted in good faith when placing the tracking device.
B: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to track the pharmacist's movements.
C: granted, because the pharmacist had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his car.
D: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to place the tracking device on the pharmacist's car.
E: denied, because the police could have discovered the location of the warehouse simply by following the pharmacist's car.
F: denied, because the evidence would have inevitably been discovered.
G: denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.
H: granted, because the police invaded the pharmacist's privacy by peering into the warehouse window.
I: granted, because the information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.
J: granted, because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.

Okay, so I'm looking at this law question about police actions and whether they should use a search warrant. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that the police received a tip about a pharmacist manufacturing synthetic cocaine. They placed an electronic tracking device on the car while it was parked outside their home. Then they followed the pharmacist every day for almost a month. Finally, they tracked the pharmacist's car to a warehouse, and they arrested him there.

The key here is whether the police had a valid reason to put the tracking device on the car. The question is whether the arrest and seizure of the pharmacist's car were lawful.

I remember that placing a tracking device on a vehicle is usually done to monitor movement. But there are exceptions, especially if the device is tracked by a warrant. The law generally requires that when placing a tracking device, a warrant is necessary. But here, the police didn't have a warrant yet because they were investigating. So, they had to place the device without a warrant, which could be a problem.

Wait, but the question says they didn't secure a warrant before installing the device. So, that's a problem because the law requires that when you put a tracking device on a vehicle, you need a warrant to warrant its placement. So, the police were acting in bad faith by not having a warrant. That would mean they couldn't use the tracking device properly, so they couldn't track the movements. Then, they followed the car every day for a month, which is a lot, but that's more about the daily enforcement.

But then, the police did follow the car and tracked the location. After a month, they found the pharmacist in the warehouse, which was a legal place. So, the main issue is whether the placement of the tracking device was done properly.

So, the main point is whether the police had a valid reason to place the tracking device. Without a warrant, it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment because it's considered unreasonable search and seizure. So, the police didn't have a warrant to place it, which is a problem. Therefore, they shouldn't be able to use the tracking device to track the movements.

But wait, the police followed the car and tracked its location. That's more of an enforcement action, not directly about the warrant. The crucial part is whether they had a warrant to put the device on the car.

So, the police didn't have a warrant. Therefore, their actions were in violation of the Fourth Amendment. They can't perform a search without a warrant, so they couldn't use the device properly. Thus, their actions were unreasonable, and they couldn't proceed to track the movements.

But then, the next step was that they followed the car and found the pharmacist in the warehouse. So, the main issue is whether the initial placement of the device was lawful.

So, the possible answers are about the warrant issue. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Denied because police acted in good faith. I think that's not right. If they didn't have a warrant, their actions were bad faith. So, they shouldn't be allowed to use the device.

Option B: Denied because of reasonable suspicion. Hmm, the police had a tip, so maybe they had a reason to track. But without a warrant, it's not a good faith use. So, B might not be correct.

Option C:Granted because of a reasonable expectation of privacy. Well, they placed the device on the car, which is their vehicle, so that's a violation of privacy. So, the expectation of privacy is low because they were tracking movements. So, that's a good reason to be restricted. But the police didn't have a warrant, so it's not a good faith use because it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment. So, C might not be the right answer.

Option D:Granted because they didn't have a warrant. That makes sense. The police didn't have a warrant to place the tracking device, which is necessary to warrant the use of the device. So, that's a violation.

Option E: Denied because they could have discovered the warehouse location by following the car. But this is more about the enforcement action, not the warrant. The police followed the car and found the pharmacist. So, the evidence was found during that enforcement, not during the initial placement of the tracking device.

Option F: Denied because the evidence would be found. No, the evidence was found during enforcement, not discovery.

Option G: Denied because the device didn't exceed 30 days. Well, the device was placed on the car, but the warehouse was a long way away. The tracking wasn't on the same vehicle, so I don't think that's relevant.

Option H:Granted because the info was illegally obtained. The tracking device is a surveillance tool, which is illegal. So, this is a search warrant issue, not just about information being obtained.

Option I:Granted because information was illegally obtained. That's about the tracking device, which is a surveillance tool, so that's a Fourth Amendment issue.

Option J:Granted because the seizure was of the fruit of an illegal search. Yes, that's exactly what happened: the police performed an illegal search (placing the device) and then seized evidence.

So, the correct answer should be J. Because their actions were unlawfulâ€”placing the tracking device without a warrant is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

The police violated the Fourth Amendment by not having a warrant to place an electronic tracking device on the pharmacist's car. This action constitutes unreasonable search and seizure, as it exceeds the 30-day limitation and is used to monitor movements, which is illegal. The key issue is the lack of a warrant, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the police acted in violation of the law and were denied the search warrant required. The correct answer is:

**J: granted, because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.**

**Answer: J**
