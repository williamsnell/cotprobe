Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of acetone. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

The problem says that when acetone is heated to 600°C, it decomposes into CO and various hydrocarbons. The reaction is first order in acetone concentration, and the half-life is 81 seconds. I'm supposed to find out how long it takes for the pressure of acetone to drop from 0.48 atm to 0.45 atm in a 1-liter container.

Wait, wait. So acetone is a gas here, right? Because the pressure is given. So we're dealing with gases here, and the reaction is a gas-phase reaction. Oh, and the problem says it's first-order, so that probably relates to the rate law and maybe some integrated rate laws.

I remember that for a first-order reaction, the half-life is a constant. So if the initial pressure is P0 and it's P0/2, the time is the half-life. But here, the pressures are 0.48 and 0.45 atm. So the pressure isn't exactly half. So I can't use the half-life directly. I'll need to use the integrated rate law for first-order reactions.

The formula I think is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt. But wait, since we're dealing with pressure, and assuming that the volume is constant (since it's a 1-liter container), the pressure is proportional to the concentration. So if [A] is pressure, that should work.

So let's plug in the values. P0 is 0.48 atm, and P is 0.45 atm. So [A]₀ is 0.48, and [A] is 0.45 atm. So [A]₀ / [A] is 0.48 / 0.45. That's about 1.0667.

So ln(1.0667) equals k multiplied by t. Let me calculate ln(1.0667). I know that ln(1.05) is about 0.04879 and ln(1.07) is about 0.06766. So 1.0667 is between these. Let me see: (1.0667 -1) is 0.0667, and 0.0667 is approximately 1/15. So perhaps the natural log is about 0.065? Wait, let me get a better approximation.

Alternatively, I can remember that ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 ... for small x. Here, x is 0.0667, which is about 1/15. Let me compute ln(1 + 0.0667) = 0.0667 - (0.0667)^2/2 + (0.0667)^3/3. Let's calculate:

0.0667 squared is approximately 0.00444, so divided by 2 gives 0.00222. So subtracting that: 0.0667 - 0.00222 = 0.06448. Then (0.0667)^3 is about 0.000296, divided by 3 is 0.0000987. So add that: 0.06448 + 0.0000987 ≈ 0.06458. So ln(1.0667) ≈ 0.06458.

So ln(1.0667) ≈ 0.0646. So the equation becomes:

0.0646 = k * t.

But wait, we need to find k. Since it's a first-order reaction, the half-life t₁/₂ is ln(2)/k. The half-life given is 81 seconds, so k = ln(2)/81. Let me compute that.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.6931 divided by 81 is about 0.00856 per second. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. No, wait, no. Wait, the half-life T₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. So k = ln(2)/T₁/₂. So k is (0.6931) / (81) ≈ 0.00856 per second.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the units. Since pressure is in atm, and the volume is 1 L, then the concentration is in mol/L, but the pressure is proportional to moles (PV = nRT, so for same T and V, P ∝ n). So the reaction is first order in terms of pressure, which is equivalent to concentration.

So the initial concentration is 0.48 atm, and we're looking for time when concentration is 0.45 atm.

So back to the equation: ln(0.48/0.45) = k t. 0.48/0.45 is 1.0667, as before. ln(1.0667) ≈ 0.0646.

So 0.0646 = k * t. And k is 0.6931/81 ≈ 0.00856 per second.

Wait, so t = 0.0646 / 0.00856 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0646 / 0.00856. Let me compute 0.00856 times 7 is 0.06 (since 0.00856 *7 = 0.06), so 7*0.00856 is 0.06 (approx 0.06), but 0.0646 is a bit more. So 7 * 0.00856 = 0.06, but 0.0646 is 0.0046 more. Then, how much more time is needed? Since 0.00856 per second per t.

So 0.0046 / 0.00856 ≈ 0.537. So t ≈ 7.537 seconds. Looking at the options, option F is 2.7 sec, which is much less. Option B is 40 sec, which is about 5 times longer. Option D is 7.5 sec. So that's close to 7.5 seconds. Oh, wait, the calculation gives about 7.54 seconds, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. If I have t = (ln(0.48/0.45)) / (ln(2)/81).

Wait, ln(0.48/0.45) is ln(1.0667) ≈ 0.0646.

ln(2) is 0.6931.

So k = 0.6931 /81 ≈ 0.00856.

t = 0.0646 / 0.00856 ≈ let's compute this division.

0.0646 ÷ 0.00856.

Hmm. 0.00856 * 7 = 0.06 (since 0.00856 *7 = 0.06), so 7 gives 0.06 atm.

But we have 0.0646, which is 0.0046 more. So 0.00856 * x = 0.0046.

x = 0.0046 / 0.00856 ≈ 0.537.

So total t is 7 + 0.537 ≈ 7.537 seconds. So approximately 7.5 seconds. Looking at the options, option D is 7.5 sec.

Wait, but option D is 7.5 sec, and option F is 2.7 sec, which is about a third of that. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Ah, wait, wait. Wait, the pressure is 0.48 at initial, and 0.45 is the current pressure. So perhaps I should have used the formula correctly.

Wait, the formula I used is ln([A]0/[A]) = kt. But [A] is the pressure of acetone, so that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the half-life formula. For a first-order reaction, the half-life is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. So k is ln(2)/t₁/₂. Since the half-life is 81 seconds, k = 0.6931 /81 ≈ 0.00856 per second.

So the calculation seems correct. So t is about 7.5 seconds. So the answer would be option D: 7.5 sec.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A: 20 sec
B:40
C:120
D:7.5
E:8.56
F:2.7
G:0.693
H:162
I:81
J:12

So D is 7.5, which is what I get. But wait, the problem is the initial pressure is 0.48, final is 0.45. So the pressure is dropping, so the reaction is proceeding. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps I'm mixing up the formula? Because sometimes, the integrated rate law uses ln([A]/[A]0) = -kt. But in this case, since we're moving from a higher pressure to a lower pressure, the equation I used is correct. So I think the earlier steps are right. So the answer should be option D:7.5 sec.

The problem involves the decomposition of acetone into CO and hydrocarbons at 600°C, where the reaction is first order in acetone concentration. The initial pressure of acetone is 0.48 atm, and the pressure decreases to 0.45 atm. The half-life of the reaction is given as 81 seconds.

For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}\right) = kt
\]

Here, \([A]_0 = 0.48 \, \text{atm}\) and \([A] = 0.45 \, \text{atm}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{0.48}{0.45}\right) \approx \ln(1.0667) \approx 0.0646
\]

The rate constant \(k\) for a first-order reaction can be calculated using the half-life formula:

\[
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \frac{0.6931}{81} \approx 0.00856 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

Substituting \(k\) and the pressure values into the integrated rate law:

\[
t = \frac{\ln(1.0667)}{k} = \frac{0.0646}{0.00856} \approx 7.54 \, \text{seconds}
\]

This calculation shows that the time required for the pressure to drop from 0.48 atm to 0.45 atm is approximately 7.5 seconds. Among the given options, the closest match is **D: 7.5 sec**.
