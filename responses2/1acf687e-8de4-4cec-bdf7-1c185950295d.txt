Okay, so I have this question about neural networks and their performance. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

Statement 1 says that CIFAR-10 classification with CNNs can exceed 95% performance. I remember that CIFAR-10 is a standard dataset in machine learning, consisting of 60,000 images, 32x32 pixel grids, and 10 classes. CNNs are pretty good at image classification, right? I think using good architectures like ResNets or others can get up to around 90% accuracy. So maybe this statement is true. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's higher? I should think again. Oh right, some studies have shown higher than 95% in some cases, especially with careful training. So Statement 1 seems plausible.

Statement 2 says that ensembles of neural networks don't improve accuracy because the representations are highly correlated. Ensembles use multiple models to reduce variance and maybe reduce overfitting. But I remember that while ensembles can help, they do rely on diversity in representations. If the models are too similar, their representations might not be as diverse, so they might not help. Also, I think that using a large number of models can sometimes improve things, but maybe it's not always the case. Wait, but isn't the main idea that combining models can sometimes outperform any single model? Or does it depend on the setup? Oh, I think in some cases, like with bagging or boosting, ensembles can improve performance. So Statement 2 might be false because it's not correct that ensembles don't help. Or is it that they don't, but sometimes they do? I'm a bit confused here. I'll come back to this.

The options are about whether each statement is true or false. The answer options are combinations of A to J, but the user only gives options A to J as the possible answers, but the user wrote the options as A:False, B:True, etc. Wait, the user's question includes the options as:

A: False, False
B: True, True
C: True, False
D: False, True

Wait, the options are A to J, but the user wrote the answer options are A to J, but the options given in the question are A through to J with each a pair. Wait, looking again, the question says:

The question's options are A to J, but the user wrote:

Options:

A: False, False
B: True, True
C: True, False
D: False, True

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the options in the question are presented as possible answers from A to J, but the options themselves are A to J, each with a pair of True/False. That can't be right. Oh, maybe I misread it. Let me read again.

The user's question says:

The answer options are A through to J.

Each option is a pair of True or False.

So the four answer options are:

A: False, False

B: True, True

C: True, False

D: False, True

So the question is whether Statement 1 is true or false, and Statement 2 is true or false, and the answer options are A to D, each with a pair.

So the user is asking, I need to determine if each statement is true or false, then choose the answer option that matches the two statements' truth values.

So Statement 1: Is CIFAR-10 classification with CNNs beyond 95% possible? I think yes. For example, I think some research has shown this. For instance, ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10 can achieve 97% validation accuracy, which is over 95%. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: Ensembles of neural networks don't improve accuracy because the representations are highly correlated. Well, I'm not sure. I think that when you use ensembles, you can sometimes improve accuracy, but it depends on the models used. If the base models are highly correlated, their representations may not help beyond what a single model could achieve. But sometimes it can help, especially when using a diverse set of models. For example, bagging can sometimes improve performance because it reduces variance. Or boosting can focus on hard samples, but that's a different approach. So Statement 2 is probably False because ensembles do help in some cases, so the statement that they don't is incorrect.

So Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Looking at the options:

A: False, False → Both false → Doesn't match.

B: True, True → Both correct? No, because Statement 2 is false.

C: True, False → Yes, this matches.

D: False, True → No, because the first is correct.

So the correct answer is option C: True, False.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each statement and the options provided.

**Statement 1:** The CIFAR-10 classification performance for CNNs can exceed 95%.  
This statement is **True** because CNNs, especially deep architectures like ResNet-50, have achieved over 95% validation accuracy on CIFAR-10.

**Statement 2:** Ensembles of neural networks do not improve classification accuracy because their representations are highly correlated.  
This statement is **False**. Ensembles can improve accuracy by reducing variance and leveraging diverse models. Techniques like bagging and boosting are effective in some cases.

**Answer Options:**
- A: False, False → Incorrect, because Statement 1 is True.
- B: True, True → Incorrect, because Statement 2 is False.
- C: True, False → Correct, as Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.
- D: False, True → Incorrect, because Statement 1 is True.

**Conclusion:** The correct answer is **C: True, False**.
