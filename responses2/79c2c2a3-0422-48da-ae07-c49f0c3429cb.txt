Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the Wagner Act is called the "laba's Mega Charta." I remember that Wagner was a key figure in labor laws, so this must be related to his contributions. Let me think about what each option says and how they tie into his work.

Option A: Mandatory profit sharing between employers and employees. I think that's more about wage agreements, like labor contracts, but Wagner was more about collective bargaining. Profit sharing might be more related to other labor laws, not specifically his original work.

Option B: Obliging employers to bargain in good faith with a union. That sounds familiar. The Wagner Act did require unions to represent employees, and it also set standards for how unions should conduct business. So this aligns with Wagner's principles, like the unions' obligation to be fair and to the public interest.

Option C: Outstaysed company unions. Wagner's law was about protecting unions, not eliminating them. He likely worked on regulations that would prevent unions from being banned, not outright abolishing them.

Option D: Universal pension system. That's more about insurance, not labor. The Wagner Act was about labor relations, so this doesn't fit.

Option E: Automatic union membership. Wagner's laws probably didn't create automatic unions; that was more of a later development, maybe in other labor movements.

Option F: Four-day workweek. Wagner's laws didn't enforce a strict workweek as a requirement; the four-day week was later established elsewhere.

Option G: Federal minimum wage. Wagner's main focus was on protecting workers, not setting a minimum wage. I think he worked on higher minimums, like 1.5 times the local minimum.

Option H: Labor's right to self-organization and collect bargaining. Yes, Wagner's "Magnataca" was a big document that established labor rights, including union self-governance and collective bargaining. That's what the question is referring to.

Option I: Health insurance. Wagner's laws didn't require health insurance; that's part of later labor laws.

Option J: Antiunion discrimination. Wagner's law wasn't about that; he focused more on protecting unions.

So the Wagner Act is considered a Mega Charta because it established fundamental rights and obligations for workers, including union self-governance and collective bargaining. This aligns with Wagner's vision of protecting workers' rights under the law.
