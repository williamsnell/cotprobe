Okay, so I've got this question about SCR surge currents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. I remember that SCR stands for Self-Contingent Triggered, which means they can start without an external trigger, unlike some other electronic components.

The question says that an SCR has a half-cycle surge current of 3000 A at a 50 Hz supply. And we're supposed to find out what the full cycle surge current is. Oh wait, a full cycle surge would be twice a half cycle, right? Because a half cycle is half the time of the full cycle. So first, I think the full cycle surge current is just double the half-cycle value.

So if half is 3000, full should be 6000. But wait, maybe there's more to it. I remember that surge currents can vary depending on the triggering conditions. Like, different triggering times can lead to different peak currents.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify anything about triggering time or the pulse duration. Oh, but wait, the half-cycle surge current is given, so maybe the full is just twice that. Because the half-cycle is the part during half a cycle, so full cycle is double that.

So 3000 A for half cycle would make 6000 A for full. Looking at the options, option B is 6000 A. Are there any other factors I'm missing?

Wait, sometimes surge currents depend on the power factor. Oh, but the question doesn't mention anything about that. It just gives the half-cycle value. So maybe the answer is 6000 A.

Another thought: Sometimes, surge currents are calculated based on the applied voltage. Like, the surge current is the applied current during the surge. But the question doesn't provide voltage, so that probably isn't relevant here.

So I think the correct answer is option B, 6000 A.

The question asks for the full-cycle surge current of an SCR given that the half-cycle surge current is 3000 A at a 50 Hz supply. Since a half-cycle is half of the full cycle, the full-cycle surge current is twice the half-cycle value. Therefore, the full-cycle surge current is 6000 A. Looking at the options, this corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
