Question:

If a star that is 20 light-years from Earth explodes, gravitational waves from the explosion would reach Earth in

Options:

A: 10 years, as gravitational waves travel at double the speed of light
B: 5 years, as gravitational waves travel at four times the speed of light
C: 40 years, as gravitational waves travel at half the speed of light
D: Instantly, as gravitational waves travel at infinite speed
E: 20 years.
F: None of these.
G: 100 years, as gravitational waves travel at a fifth the speed of light
H: more than 20 years.
I: less than 20 years.
J: It would never reach Earth

Okay, so I have this question about gravitational waves and their speed. Hmm, I remember that light and gravitational waves both travel at the speed of light, right? Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, gravitational waves do travel at the speed of light, same as light. Oh wait, no, wait again. Hmm, I think I might have gotten that confused. Let me think. Oh wait, no, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Light and gravitational waves both travel at the same speed, which is c, the speed of light. So both travel at approximately 300,000 km per second. So that means gravitational waves and light both travel at the same speed, c.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. No, wait again. No, I think I'm getting it wrong. Oh, wait, noâ€”no, wait, no. Oh, wait: I think I'm mixing up something. No, wait, no. Wait, in reality, both light and gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, which is the same. So they both reach Earth at the speed of light. That's a key point.

So the question is about a star that's 20 light-years away. So the distance is 20 light-years. So if something takes 20 light years to reach us, that's the time it would take for light to travel that distance, because light travels one light-year in one year. So if light takes 20 years, then gravitational waves, which also travel at c, would take 20 years to reach Earth. So the explosion happens 20 light-years away, and gravitational waves take same time to reach us.

Wait, but the options. Let's look at the options. Option E is 20 years. So that's the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 10 years, as gravitational waves travel at double the speed of light. Wait, no. Gravitational waves travel at speed c. So option A is wrong because it says they travel at twice the speed, which would be 2c. That's way too fast. Speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so 2c would be 6e8 m/s, but that's not how it works. So A is incorrect.

Option B: 5 years, as they travel at four times the speed. No, same reason as A; they don't go that fast.

Option C: 40 years, half the speed. Again, not correct, since they go at c.

Option D: Instantly. No, because even though c is the maximum speed, it's not infinite. So D is wrong.

Option E: 20 years. Correct, as both take same speed.

Option F: None of these. Well, E is correct, so F is wrong.

Options G, H, I, J: G says 100 years as they travel at a fifth speed. No, that's wrong. H is more than 20. No. I is less. So not correct. J is incorrect because they do reach instantly.

So the correct answer is E.

The question asks about the time it takes for gravitational waves to travel 20 light-years from a star. Since gravitational waves travel at the speed of light (c), they will take the same amount of time as light to cover the distance. A 20 light-year distance means it will take 20 years for gravitational waves to reach Earth. 

Analyzing the options:
- **E (20 years)** is correct because gravitational waves travel at the speed of light.
- All other options (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J) are incorrect for various reasons related to incorrect speeds or times.

Thus, the correct answer is E.

**Answer: E**
