Okay, so I've got this question about effusion rates and the mole composition of a gas mixture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says there's a gaseous mixture of 90 mole percent hydrogen (H2) and 10 mole percent deuterium (D2) at 25°C, and the total pressure is 1 atm. They effuse through a pin hole of area 0.30 mm². I need to calculate the composition of the initial gas that passes through. The options are from A to J, each giving different mole percentages for D2 and H2.

I remember that Graham's law deals with effusion rates, but this seems a bit more complicated since it's a mixture. Oh wait, I think when dealing with mixtures, the effective molar mass comes into play. Because effusion rates depend on the molar mass; lighter gases effuse faster.

So each gas in the mixture will effuse at a rate proportional to their molar mass. The rate of effusion is inversely proportional to their molar mass because lighter gases effuse faster. So the total effusion rate is the sum of each component's effusion rate.

But wait, in this case, since the mixture is effusing, the mole fraction of each gas affects the total effusion rate. Oh right, the mole fractions determine how much each contributes to the overall effusion.

Wait, but the question is asking for the composition of the initial gas that passes through. Oh wait, no, maybe not. Let me read the question again.

Oh, wait, no. The question says, calculate the composition of the initial gas that passes through. So wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Do they mean what's the mole fraction of each gas in the initial mixture that passed through? Or is it the mole fraction of each gas in the original gas mixture?

Wait, no. The initial gas is a mixture, but the question is about the mole composition of the initial gas that passes through. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's about the composition of the gas that is left in the container after effusion. Oh, perhaps it's the mole fractions in the initial mixture that are kept. Hmm, perhaps the question is about the mole fractions of each gas in the initial mixture.

Wait, the question says: "Calculate the composition of the initial gas that passes through." So perhaps the composition refers to what's left in the container after effusion. Because the effusion process removes gases from the container.

Wait, but that's a bit unclear, but I think the question is asking for the mole fractions of each gas in the initial mixture that remain in the container after effusion. Or perhaps it's the mole fraction of each gas in the initial mixture, which is the composition of the initial gas.

Wait, no. The wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question: "Calculate the composition of the initial gas that passes through." So the initial gas is the mixture, and after effusion, the remaining gas must have a certain composition. So perhaps the question is asking for the mole fractions of D2 and H2 in the initial mixture, but that can't be because the options give D2 and H2 mole fractions.

Wait, but the options are the mole percentages of D2 and H2 in the initial mixture. So the question is, what is the initial composition of the gas? So the question is asking which option correctly describes the mole percentages of D2 and H2 in the initial mixture.

But wait, the initial gas is a mixture of 90% H2 and 10% D2. Because the question says, the mixture is 90 mole percent H2 and 10 mole percent D2. But wait, that's option A, which says D2 is 92.7% and H2 7.3%. That can't be right because the question is phrased as the composition that passes through. So maybe the initial composition is the composition that remains, not the one that effused.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the mole fractions of the gases in the initial mixture, because that's what the options are. So the initial gas is 90% H2 and 10% D2. But the options are giving D2 and H2 mole percentages. So the correct answer would be A: D2 92.7% and H2 7.3%? Or is that the composition that passed through?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says, "the composition of the initial gas that passes through." Oh, perhaps it's the mole fractions of each gas in the initial mixture. Because effusion is about how much each gas effuse, but the leaving gas would have the same composition as the initial mixture.

Wait, but the given options are the mole percentages of D2 and H2 in the initial mixture. So perhaps the question is asking what is the mole composition of the initial gas that passes through, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the initial composition is what's left.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the mole fractions of the gases that remain in the container after effusion. Because effusion would cause gases to leave, but the composition would remain the same. So the initial composition is the same as the composition that passes through.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think differently. The effusion rate depends on the molar mass. The formula for Graham's law when dealing with mixtures is a bit more complex, but perhaps the mole fractions of each gas in the mixture affect the total effusion rate.

Wait, but the effusion rate is proportional to the sum of the mole fractions multiplied by their molar masses. Because each gas's contribution is additive in terms of their effusion rates.

Hmm, alternatively, I remember that for a gas mixture, the rate of effusion (per unit area) is proportional to the sum of the mole fractions multiplied by their molar masses. Because each molecule has a certain effusion rate proportional to its mass.

So the rate (R) is proportional to sum of (x_i * M_i), where x_i is the mole fraction and M_i the molar mass.

Wait, but in this case, the effusion rate is given as a sum of each gas's effusion. So for the mixture, the total effusion rate R_total is R_total = R_H2 + R_D2.

Each R_i is proportional to x_i * M_i. Because R = (P/(RT)) * sqrt(2M), but when considering mixture, the total effusion rate is the sum of each component's effusion rate.

So, R_total = x1 * sqrt(2 M1) + x2 * sqrt(2 M2).

In the case where M1 is the molar mass of H2 (2 g/mol) and M2 is D2 (32 g/mol), and x1 is 0.9 (90% H2), x2 0.1 (10% D2).

Wait, but wait, the formula for an effusion rate is R = (sqrt(2 M) )/(sqrt(273.15)) * x, but perhaps more accurately, R is proportional to x * sqrt(M), as the effusion rate is proportional to the square root of the molar mass.

Wait, so for effusion, the rate (per unit area) is proportional to the molar mass of the gas, multiplied by its mole fraction. Because lighter gases effuse faster, so their contribution is higher. So, the formula:

R = x1 * sqrt(2 M1) + x2 * sqrt(2 M2).

But wait, wait, the exact formula: the effusion rate per gram is proportional to sqrt(M). Because effusion rate (molar flux) is proportional to sqrt(M). So for each gas, the effusion rate per mole is proportional to sqrt(M).

So, for a mixture, the total effusion rate would be the sum for each gas of (x_i * sqrt(M_i)) * (per mole basis?), but perhaps it's better to think in terms of molar flux.

Wait, perhaps the total effusion rate is given by R_total = x1 * sqrt(2 M1) + x2 * sqrt(2 M2).

Because each gas's contribution to the total effusion is proportional to their mole fraction and their molar mass.

So, the total effusion rate is R_total = (x_H2 * sqrt(2 * 2)) + (x_D2 * sqrt(2 * 32)).

Wait, 2 is grams per mole for H2, and 32 g/mol for D2.

So, substituting the values:

x_H2 =0.9, M_H2=2 g/mol.

x_D2 =0.1, M_D2=32 g/mol.

So:

R_total = (0.9 * sqrt(4)) ) + (0.1 * sqrt(64)) )

sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(64)=8.

So R_total = (0.9 * 2 ) + (0.1 *8 ) = 1.8 + 0.8 = 2.6.

So the total effusion rate is 2.6.

But, wait, I'm not sure if I'm calculating this correctly. Another approach: the rate of effusion for each gas is proportional to x_i * sqrt(M_i). So the ratio of the effusion rates of H2 to D2 is (x_H2 * sqrt(2)) ) / (x_D2 * sqrt(32)).

Because sqrt(2) is H2's molar mass, and sqrt(32) is D2's molar mass.

So, H2's effusion rate is (0.9 * sqrt(2)) and D2 is (0.1 * sqrt(32)).

Calculating sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, sqrt(32) ≈ 5.656.

So H2's rate is 0.9 *1.414 ≈ 1.273.

D2's rate is 0.1 *5.656 ≈ 0.5656.

So the ratio of H2 to D2 rates is 1.273/0.5656 ≈ 2.25. So H2 effused about twice as fast as D2.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the composition of the initial gas that passes through. So perhaps the effusion rate tells us the mole fractions that remain in the container. Because as effusion occurs, the gases leave, and the composition of the remaining gas would be the same as the initial composition.

Wait, that makes sense. So the initial composition is what's left in the container after effusion. So the mole fractions of each gas in the initial mixture that remain are the same as those in the initial gas.

So for example, if the initial gas was 90% H2 and 10% D2, after effusion, the same mole fractions would remain.

But wait, the options are giving mole percentages for D2 and H2 of the initial gas. So the correct answer would be option A, which says D2 is 92.7% and H2 is 7.3%, but that's the initial composition. Wait, but the question says to calculate the "composition of the initial gas that passes through." That would be the same as the initial composition.

Hmm, but the options are giving the initial composition. So the question is probably about what's left in the container after effusion, which is the same as the initial composition. So the correct answer would be option A, which says D2 is 92.7% and H2 is 7.3%.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the initial composition is 90% H2 and 10% D2, which is option A. So why are other options like option B (D2=12%, H2=88%) even present?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's about the mole fractions in the effused gas. No, I think that would be a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of partial pressures. The mole fractions in the effused gas would be the same as the initial because effusion doesn't change the composition.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of it another way. The problem is about effusion rates. The effusion rate depends on the molar mass and the mole fraction. The effusion rate for each gas is proportional to x_i * sqrt(M_i). The ratio of the effusion rates (H2 to D2) is x_H2 / x_D2 * sqrt(M_H2 / M_D2).

So, x_H2 is 0.9, x_D2 is 0.1.

So the ratio of effusion rates is (0.9 / 0.1) * sqrt(2/32) = 9 * sqrt(1/16) =9*(1/4)= 2.25.

So the effusion rate for H2 is 2.25 times that of D2.

But I'm not sure how this relates to the mole fractions in the initial gas that pass through. Because effusion occurs, gases leave, so the moles that remain are the same as the initial. So the mole fractions in the remaining gas are the same as the initial.

Therefore, the initial mole fractions are 90% H2 and 10% D2. So the correct answer would be option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the effusion process of a gaseous mixture containing 90% hydrogen (H₂) and 10% deuterium (D₂) at 25 °C and 1 atm. The goal is to determine the composition of the initial gas that passes through a pinhole of area 0.30 mm².

### Key Concepts:
1. **Effusion Rate and Molar Mass**: The effusion rate of a gas is proportional to the square root of its molar mass. Lighter gases effuse faster, so the total effusion rate of a mixture is the sum of the effusion rates of its components.
2. **Mole Fractions and Effusion Rate**: The mole fraction of each gas in the mixture affects the total effusion rate. The ratio of effusion rates of H₂ to D₂ depends on both their mole fractions and molar masses.
3. **Mole Fractions in the Initial Gas**: The composition of the initial gas that passes through the pinhole corresponds to the mole fractions of the gases in the initial mixture, as effusion does not alter the composition of the remaining gas.

### Calculation:
- Molar masses: H₂ = 2 g/mol, D₂ = 32 g/mol.
- Mole fractions: H₂ = 0.9, D₂ = 0.1.
- Effusion rate ratio: 
  \[
  \text{Effusion rate ratio} = \frac{x_{\text{H}_2} \cdot \sqrt{M_{\text{H}_2}}}{x_{\text{D}_2} \cdot \sqrt{M_{\text{D}_2}}} = \frac{0.9 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{0.1 \cdot \sqrt{32}} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 1.414}{0.1 \cdot 5.656} \approx 2.25.
  \]
  This indicates that H₂ effuses about 2.25 times faster than D₂.

### Interpretation:
- The mole fractions of H₂ and D₂ in the initial mixture remain unchanged after effusion because the composition of the gas that passes through the pinhole is identical to the composition of the initial gas.
- Therefore, the mole fractions in the initial gas that pass through are the same as the mole fractions in the initial mixture.

### Correct Answer:
The initial mole fractions of H₂ and D₂ in the gas that passes through the pinhole are 90% and 10%, respectively. This corresponds to **Option A**.
