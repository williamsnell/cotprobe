Okay, so I've got this question about social sanctions, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that children who are still sucking their thumbs when entering kindergarten are subject to teasing and ridicule. They're asking what type of social sanction is applied here. The options are A to J, each describing different types of sanctions.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that different behaviors can lead to different forms of sanctions. There are formal and informal sanctions, and they can be positive or negative. Let me think about each term.

Formal sanctions are usually explicit or written, like a warning or a book. They have a clear structure and are usually considered more serious. Formal sanctions can be positive or negative. Informal sanctions are more like what's spoken or felt, not written. They can be more flexible and might be applied in situations where it's not appropriate to use formal language.

So, the behavior in question is sucking their thumbs. That's a specific, observable behavior. I think that's classified as acrete behavior because it's a specific action done by an individual. But what about the type of sanction applied?

Teasing and ridicule are forms of negative reinforcement. Wait, no, negative reinforcement is when you remove a stimulus or reward to encourage a behavior. So in this case, the behavior (sucking thumbs) is being reinforced by the negative outcome (teasing or ridicule). Alternatively, it's a form of negative consequence.

Wait, so if a behavior is reinforced by a negative consequence, that's called a negative consequence. But the question is about the type of sanction, not the consequence itself. So the sanction applied would be the response that follows the behavior.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall: formal sanctions are when you specify the form, like warning or punishment. Informal sanctions are more like the actual response, like saying "It's a bad behavior" or "You shouldn't do that."

So when a child is being teased for sucking their thumbs, that's a negative response. But is it formal or informal? It's not a formal rule because it's about a specific action not being allowed. It's more like a norm or a rule that's enforced informally.

Wait, but the question is about the type of social sanction applied. So the act of being sanctioned is the response. If the child receives a warning for this, that's a formal negative sanction. If they receive a verbal warning, that's informal.

But I'm not sure. Let me think: the question states that the children are being subject to teasing and ridicule. Teasing is a form of negative reinforcement, but the type of response is what counts as the sanction.

Wait, perhaps the term I'm looking for is negative reinforcement. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, the answer might be an informal negative sanction, which is option F.

Alternatively, maybe it's a formal negative sanction because it's a specific type of punishment, but I'm not too certain.

Wait, another approach: the options. Let's look at them again.

A: Formal negative
B: No sanction
C: Positive
D: Informal neutral
E: Informal positive
F: Informal negative
G: Negative
H: Formal positive
I: Formal neutral
J: Both formal and informal negative

From what I remember, negative reinforcement is a type of form of social sanction. But in the context of the options, option F is informal negative. But wait, wait, noâ€” the options are more general. Formal negative is when you specify the form (like a warning), and informal negative is when you give a verbal warning, perhaps.

So the act of being told to not do that is an informal negative. So the answer would be F: Informal negative sanction.

Alternatively, maybe it's not formal or informal but just negative, but the options don't have that. So I think F is the answer.

The correct answer is F: Informal negative sanction.

**Answer:** F
