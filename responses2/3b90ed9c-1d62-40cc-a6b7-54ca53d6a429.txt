Question:

In the Harlow study of emotional attachment, infant monkeys were placed in a cage and given both a "wire" mother and a "cloth" mother. Researchers then moved a bottle of milk from one mother to the other while introducing various stimuli to see if the monkeys would form an attachment to either of the "mothers." In this experiment, the independent variable is

Options:

A: the type of stimuli introduced to the monkeys
B: with which "mother" the bottle of milk is placed
C: the gender of the infant monkeys
D: the amount of milk in the bottle
E: the type of material used to create the "mothers"
F: the "wire" mother versus the "cloth" mother
G: the age of the infant monkeys
H: the time of day the milk bottle was moved
I: the preference of the infants for the source of milk
J: the preference of the infants for the "wire" mother

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the Harlow study on emotional attachment. Let me read the question carefully again.

The question is about identifying the independent variable in the Harlow study. The setup involves placing infant monkeys in a cage, giving them a wire mother and a cloth mother. Then, researchers move a bottle of milk from one mother to the other while introducing various stimuli. The goal is to see if the monkeys form an attachment with either mother. The question is asking what the independent variable is.

Hmm, I remember that in experiments, the independent variable is the factor that is manipulated by the experimenter. It's the cause that you change to observe its effect. The dependent variable is what you measure to see if it changes as the independent variable changes.

So, in this case, the monkeys are exposed to different stimuli while their mothers are switched around. The independent variable must be the stimulus they're exposed to. Wait, but the options don't list "stimuli." Let me look at the options again.

The options are A to J. Looking at them, option F is "the type of material used to create the 'mothers'". Oh, that's interesting because the mothers were made of wire or cloth. So, in this study, the type of mother material might be the independent variable because it's what's being manipulated.

But wait, the question is about the dependent variable. Oh, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. The independent variable is what you change. So which factor was changed?

In the experiment, the setup is that the mother's role is being switched. The mother's material is the same; it's wire or cloth. So the researcher might have manipulated the mother's material to see how that affects attachment. So the independent variable would be the type of mother.

Wait, but the question is about the independent variable. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The independent variable is what you change. So if the mother's material is being changed, then that's the independent variable. So in this case, the independent variable is the type of mother's material.

Wait, but the question is about the setup: they gave each monkey both a wire and a cloth mother. But the way the experiment is set up, the variable is which mother is being moved. Or is it the type of mother?

Wait, the question is about the independent variable in the experiment. The independent variable is the factor that's controlled by the researcher. So the experiment is: the researcher moves the bottle from mother 1 to mother 2, and varies the materials.

Wait, let me read the setup again. The monkeys are in a cage with both a wire and cloth mother. The researcher moves the bottle of milk from one to the other and introduces various stimuli. So the independent variable is perhaps the type of mother's material.

Wait, the question is about which variable is the independent one. Let's think in terms of the question: what is being manipulated by the researcher? The mother's material would be the variable. So, the independent variable is the type of mother's material used to create the mothers.

Looking at the options, option F is "the type of material used to create the 'mothers'". So F would be the independent variable because the researcher is varying this variable to see its effect.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another angle: the independent variable is what's being tested. The researcher is moving the bottle and using different materials. So, the variable is the type of mother's material. So the correct answer should be F: the type of material used to create the "mothers".

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The setup is that each monkey is in a cage with both a wire and a cloth mother. The researcher moves the bottle of milk between the two mothers. So perhaps the independent variable is the type of mother's material, because that's what's being changed. Alternatively, the mother's role is being switched, but that's the dependent variable because that's what's being observed—the effect.

Wait, another thought: the question is asking for the independent variable. The independent variable is the factor that's being manipulated. So, in this experiment, the researcher is varying which mother (wire or cloth) is being moved. Or wait, no—wait, the mother's type is determined by the materials used. So the type of mother's material is what's being changed.

Wait, maybe the question is about the independent variable being the type of mother's material. So the correct answer would be F.

Alternatively, the independent variable could be the type of stimuli being introduced, but that's option A. But I think the setup is that the type of mother's material is what's varied. So the correct answer is F.

The Harlow study investigates how different types of "mothers" affect the formation of emotional attachment between infants. The independent variable is the factor that is manipulated by the researcher to observe its effect. In this study, the researcher varies the type of "mother's material" (wire or cloth) to see how it influences attachment. 

Option F, "the type of material used to create the 'mothers'," is the independent variable because it is the factor being altered to test its effect on attachment.
