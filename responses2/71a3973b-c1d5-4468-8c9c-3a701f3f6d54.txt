Question:

A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Options:

A: Oral nystatin therapy
B: Tranquilizer therapy
C: Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy
D: Oral pain reliever therapy
E: Intravenous antiviral therapy
F: Incision and drainage
G: Salt water gargle
H: Antacid therapy
I: Oral antifungal therapy
J: Inhaled corticosteroid therapy

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this medical question. Let's read through it carefully.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a sore throat and fever for 5 days. She noticed changes in her voice and pain with swallowing. She's been on acetaminophen since she started showing symptoms. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she doesn't take any routine medications. Her vital signs are 40.0°C (which is pretty high, almost body temp), 130/min pulse, 18/min breathing, and BP 102/66 mmHg.

She has a right-sided edema in her right soft palate, edema in the airway, white exudate in the right tonilis, and a trismus. The exam shows enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes on palpation of the neck disc.

She's being treated with acetaminophen. The question is about the most appropriate management for antibiotic therapy.

I remember that a trismus is a popping sound in the throat, and acute trismus is usually caused by infection, like strep. But here, the patient is on acetaminophen, which is an analgesic. High fever and sore throat often point to bacterial infection, not viral. So the trismus might be due to something else, maybe a viral infection.

Her exudates are on the right side. Exudates are fluid buildup, so that could be edema, which is often seen with infections.

She's having pain with swallowing, which could be related to something like dysphagia, but more likely it's a trismus or something else. However, the exam shows edema in the airway and soft palate, which points towards an infection.

She's been on acetaminophen since her symptoms started. That's probably because she didn't have a history of allergies or pre-existing conditions. So if she's on acetaminophen, perhaps the infection is causing her symptoms.

The question is about antibiotic therapy, so the patient isn't taking any. So what's the best next step? Since she has trismus and edema, maybe she has an acute infection, like strep. But if it's a viral infection, she might not be taking antibiotics, so the doctor would consider other options.

But wait, her blood pressure is 102/66. That's a bit high, but maybe not critical. She's on acetaminophen, so maybe the infection is causing her to be hyperactive.

Looking at the options, the options are for antibiotics, but the patient isn't on antibiotics. So the question is, what's the next step?

Option A: Oral nystatin. Nystatin is an antibiotic for trismus. But the patient is on acetaminophen, so maybe not the best choice.

Option B: Tranquilizer. That's for pain and anxiety. She's already on acetaminophen, so maybe not applicable.

Option C: Intravenous methylprednisolone. That's another antibiotic for trismus. But again, the patient is on acetaminophen.

Option D: Oral pain reliever. She's on acetaminophen, so maybe not the best for pain.

Option E: Intravenous antiviral. That's for viral infections. But is she on a viral infection? Her symptoms are more in line with an acute infection, like strep. If it's viral, the patient might start intravenous antiviral, but the question is about antibiotic therapy. But the patient's been taking acetaminophen, which suggests she's not allergic or pre-existing condition, so maybe not the right choice.

Option F: Incision and drainage. That's for infections without symptoms, like TB, but she has trismus and edema, which is more indicative of an infection.

Option G: Salt water gargle. That's for pain, maybe, but again, she's on acetaminophen and acute trismus might be more about the infection.

Option H: Oral antifungal. Antifungal is for viral infections. If she has a viral infection, this could be the next step.

Option I: Oral antacid. Antacids are for acid reflux, not directly for infections, but could be used if that's the case.

Option J: Inhaled corticosteroid. That's for inflammation, like trismus, but again, the patient might be on a viral infection.

Wait, the patient is on acetaminophen, so maybe the infection is viral. If that's the case, the next step would be intravenous antiviral. But the question is about antibiotic therapy. Hmm.

Wait, the question says, "of the following is the most appropriate management?" So they're considering antibiotics, but perhaps the patient isn't on them. So the options given are for antibiotics, or other treatments.

Wait, no, the first part of the question: "She comes to the ED because of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever." Then, she's taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. The question is, what's the most appropriate management for her, given that she's on acetaminophen and being treated with it.

Wait, perhaps the patient is on acetaminophen, which is an analgesic, but her symptoms are worsening, indicating something more severe. So if she's on an analgesic and has trismus, maybe the next step is considering intravenous antiviral if it's a viral infection. But the options are for different management.

Wait, perhaps I've missed something. The question is about the most appropriate management for her, given that she's on acetaminophen. So she's not on antibiotics, but the question is about her management, which is part of the same analysis.

Wait, but the question is about the next step. The treatment options given include options for managing her, perhaps. For example, option E is intravenous antiviral, which is for viral infections.

Wait, but if she's on an analgesic and has trismus, maybe the next step is considering intravenous antiviral if it's a viral infection. But the patient's vital signs are normal in some ways, but her BP is high (102/66), which is higher than average. Maybe it's a hyperactive trismus, and the underlying infection is causing it.

Wait, but the patient's being treated with acetaminophen, perhaps due to allergies or a pre-existing condition. So perhaps the best next step is intravenous antiviral if she's on a viral infection, but the question is about antibiotic therapy. Alternatively, perhaps she's on a viral infection, and she needs an antiviral, but the question is about her management. But the question says, the patient is taking acetaminophen, and the options are for antibiotic management.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The patient's symptoms are due to a viral infection, causing trismus. So, she's on acetaminophen, which is an analgesic. The next step would be to consider intravenous antiviral, which is option E. But the options are for the management, which might include other treatments.

Wait, but the question is about her management, and the options provided are for possible management. So if she's on an analgesic, which is part of her treatment, perhaps the next step is intravenous antiviral for viral infection.

Alternatively, if she's on an analgesic and the underlying cause is a severe infection with trismus, perhaps she's not on an antiviral but needs to consider IV antiviral.

Wait, but the patient's blood pressure is 102/66, which is high, but maybe normal if she's on an analgesic. She's on acetaminophen, which is an analgesic, so maybe her high BP is due to something else.

Wait, the question says, which is the most appropriate management for her of the options given.

Options A to J are all about different management options. So the patient is being treated with acetaminophen, but perhaps the underlying cause is a viral infection, leading to her needing an antiviral.

So, the options are:

E: Intravenous antiviral therapy.

But the patient is taking an analgesic. So perhaps she needs an antiviral despite being on an analgesic. Alternatively, maybe the patient is on a viral infection, so the next step is IV antiviral.

But the question is about the most appropriate management of her, given that she's on acetaminophen. So perhaps she's on an analgesic and needs to be considered for antiviral if it's a viral infection.

Wait, but the patient's blood pressure is 102/66, which is a bit high. Maybe she's on a high-dose, which she's not taking, but she is on acetaminophen. So perhaps she's not on a viral infection.

Alternatively, maybe she has a bacterial infection, leading to trismus. But in that case, the patient might not be on an antiviral, and the next step would be to rule out the cause.

Wait, but the question is about the most appropriate management for her, given her current condition. So perhaps she's on an analgesic, and the next step is to rule out underlying causes, which would involve antiviral therapy.

But the options are about management. So among the options, E is IV antiviral, which is for viral infections. So if she's on an analgesic, but the underlying cause is a viral infection, then she would need IV antiviral.

Alternatively, if she has an acute infection, perhaps she's on an antacid or something else, but the options don't include those.

Wait, let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: Oral nystatin

B: Tranquilizer

C: Intravenous methylprednisolone

D: Oral pain reliever

E: Intravenous antiviral therapy

F: Incision and drainage

G: Salt water gargle

H: Oral antifungal

I: Oral antacid

J: Inhaled corticosteroid

So the patient's current management is acetaminophen. The question is about the most appropriate management, but the options are about the next step.

Wait, perhaps the patient's symptoms are due to a bacterial infection, and the initial treatment was not antiviral but she's on acetaminophen. So in that case, perhaps the next step is IV antiviral. But the options are about management, not treatment.

Alternatively, perhaps the patient is on an analgesic and the underlying infection is causing trismus, so she needs IV antiviral. So among the options, E is IV antiviral.

Alternatively, could it be intravenous nystatin? But that's for trismus. The patient has trismus, so option C is for trismus, but the patient is on acetaminophen. So that seems less likely.

Option B is a pain reliever, which might not be the next step if she's on acetaminophen.

Option H is oral antifungal. That's for viral infections.

Option E is IV antiviral.

Option F is drainage, which is for infections without symptoms.

Option G is gargle, which is for pain.

Option I is antacid, which is for acid reflux.

Option J is corticosteroid, which is for inflammation.

So if the patient's underlying cause is a viral infection, she should be given IV antiviral. But in the case of a bacterial infection, she'd be on oral antifungal. But the question is about antibiotic therapy.

Wait, but the question says, "of the following is the most appropriate management." So the patient is being treated with acetaminophen, and her symptoms are worsening, which may indicate a more severe infection, possibly with trismus.

So if the underlying cause is a viral infection, she would be given IV antiviral. But if it's a bacterial infection, she'd be given oral antifungal.

But the options don't include antifungal, only nystatin, pain reliever, etc. So which is the best option given the test.

Wait, but the patient is on acetaminophen, and her symptoms have worsened, which is a common sign in acute viral infections, especially with trismus.

So if the patient has an acute infection causing trismus, the next step would be IV antiviral. So option E.

But wait, the question is about the most appropriate management for her of the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the patient is on an analgesic and needs to rule out an underlying cause, so she should be given IV antiviral. So E is the answer.

But wait, the patient's BP is 102/66. That's a bit high, but maybe not necessarily an issue unless it's due to a bacterial infection.

So, if the patient's underlying cause is a viral infection, the next step is antiviral. So option E is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the patient is on an analgesic and needs to rule out a bacterial infection, but I'm not sure about that. But in most of the cases, acute trismus is more indicative of viral infection.

So the answer is E: In IV antiviral therapy.
</think>

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever, accompanied by changes in her voice and swallowing, increased pain with swallowing, and edema in her soft palate and airway. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began and has no pre-existing medical history. Her vital signs are 40.0°C (104.0°F), 130/min, 18/min, and 102/66 mm Hg. She has white exudate on the right tonilis and edema in the right soft palate and airway, along with a white exudate. The exam reveals an acute right-sided trismus.

The patient is being treated with acetaminophen, and the question is about the most appropriate management for her, given the options provided. The key considerations are the underlying cause of the symptoms, which may involve a viral infection, as trismus is more commonly associated with bacterial infections.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Oral nystatin therapy**  
  Nystatin is used to treat trismus, but the patient is on acetaminophen, an analgesic, and the underlying cause of her symptoms is unclear. This makes nystatin less appropriate.

- **B: Tranquilizer therapy**  
  Translational therapy for pain or anxiety, but the patient is on acetaminophen and has acute trismus. Translational therapy is not indicated here.

- **C: Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy**  
  This is used for acute viral infections, not trismus. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a viral infection.

- **D: Oral pain reliever therapy**  
  Acetaminophen is already being used, and this option does not provide a rationale for increasing pain relief.

- **E: Intravenous antiviral therapy**  
  Antiviral therapy is appropriate if the patient's symptoms are due to a viral infection, as trismus is commonly associated with viral infections. This option aligns with the patient's current management and the underlying cause of her symptoms.

- **F: Incision and drainage**  
  This is typically used for infections without symptoms, such as TB, and not applicable here.

- **G: Salt water gargle**  
  This is for pain or anxiety but does not address the underlying cause of trismus.

- **H: Oral antifungal therapy**  
  Antifungal therapy is for viral infections, but the patient may not currently be on one.

- **I: Oral antacid therapy**  
  Antacids are for acid reflux and are not indicated here.

- **J: Inhaled corticosteroid therapy**  
  This is for inflammation but does not address the underlying cause of trismus.

### Conclusion:
The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a viral infection causing acute trismus. The most appropriate next step is **intravenous antiviral therapy** to treat the underlying infection.
