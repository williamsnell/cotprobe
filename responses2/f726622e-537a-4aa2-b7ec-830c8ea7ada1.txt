Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Christian denominations. The question is asking which denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are A through J, each representing a different denomination. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to remember what each of these denominations is known for. I'll try to recall each one briefly or think about their key characteristics.

Option A: Roman Catholic. I know this is a traditional Christian denomination, often considered the oldest. It's known for its teachings about grace, sin, and the Trinity. But I don't think it's very strict in terms of the strictness of the Christian faith. It's more about the doctrines rather than being overly strict.

Option B: Lutherans. The Lutherans are also part of the Catholic tradition. They're known for their strictness, especially regarding Christ's Definition of Sainthood. They emphasize that God is not the savior, but only the Lord. So Lutherans might promote a more strict, dogmatic Christianity.

Option C: Methodists. The Methodists are another Catholic denominational variant. They're known for their strict teachings, especially about Christ as a savior and the Trinity. They also emphasize the doctrine of the gospels, which is pretty strict. So they might be a good candidate for a stripped-down Christianity.

Option D: Greek Orthodox. I'm not as familiar with this one. I think it's a mix of Eastern Orthodox and Greek influences. It's part of the Western Orthodox tradition. I don't recall it being as strict as the Methodists or Lutherans.

Option E: Quakers. Quakers are more religious than denominational. They believe in a divine plan and have strict communal practices. They don't follow a strict Christian doctrine like Lutherans or Methodists, so maybe they're more about communal worship and communal sacrifice rather than strict Christianity.

Option F: Seventh-day Adventists. I'm less sure about this one. I think some Seventh-day Adventists are very strict, similar to Lutherans, but others might be more open. Wait, I remember that the Seventh-day Adventists are more strict than the Quakers but less so than the Methodists or Lutherans. They emphasize Christ as the savior and the Trinity, which is pretty strict.

Option G: Baptists. The Baptists are another Protestant denomination. They're known for their strictness, especially regarding Christ as the savior and the Trinity. They also emphasize that the Bible is the word of God. So they might be promoting a more strict Christianity.

Option H: Mormons. Mormons are more like the priests of heaven, I think. They don't follow strict Christian doctrines and often reject the idea of Christ as the savior. Instead, they believe in a higher power and a divine plan. So their Christianity is more about the scriptural interpretation and the idea of a divine plan rather than strict doctrine.

Option I: Puritans. The Puritans are foundational in Christian tradition. They believe in Christ as the ultimate sacrifice and the savior, and they emphasize the doctrine of the Trinity and that the Bible is the word of God. So they are very strict in their Christianity.

Option J: Anglicans. Anglicanism is a mix of Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. It's known for its inclusivity and diversity. Anglicans often accept a narrower definition of God, not necessarily the traditional doctrine of the Trinity or Christ as the savior. So they might not be as strict as the others.

Now, the question asks which promotes a "stripped-down Christianity." Stripped-down might mean more of a strict, dogmatic approach, emphasizing doctrine over practice or communal aspects.

Looking at the options again:

- Lutherans (B) and Methodists (C) are known for their strictness. But I'm a bit confused because I thought Methodists are also known as "Catholic Methodists." Lutherans focus more on Christ's Definition of Sainthood and the gospels, while Methodists also emphasize these things but perhaps in a more strict way.

Wait, but the question is about which one promotes a "stripped-down" Christianity. So perhaps strictness in terms of doctrine is more about Lutherans than Methodists. Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, the term "stripped-down" could mean that the focus is less on the broader Christian teachings and more on individual Christian belief. So for example, Methodists and Lutherans might focus more on the doctrine than on the whole Christian picture.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The options are:

A: Roman Catholic ( traditional, not particularly strict)
B: Lutherans (very strict, Christ's Definition and gospels)
C: Methodists (also strict, same as B)
F: Seventh-day Adventists (strict, but perhaps not as much as B)
G: Baptists (strict)
H: Mormons (more about scriptural interpretation, not strict doctrine)
I: Puritans (very strict)
J: Anglicans (more moderate)

So the question is which promotes a stripped-down Christianity. So the ones that are more dogmatic in their teachings.

Looking again, the best fit for a more strict, dogmatic approach would be the ones that emphasize Christ as the savior, the Trinity, and the gospels. So that would be the Lutherans, the Methodists, the Seventh-day Adventists, the Baptists, and the Puritans.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so only one answer. So perhaps the answer is B: Lutherans, because they are known for their strictness regarding Christ's Definition of Sainthood and the gospels.

Alternatively, Methodists (C) might also be a candidate because they have a very dogmatic approach.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of what each denomination's focus is.

- Roman Catholic (A): Focus on theology, not too strict in doctrine.
- Lutherans (B): Strict, focusing on Christ's Definition of Sainthood.
- Methodists (C): Strict, similar to B, emphasizing the gospels and doctrine.
- Seventh-day Adventists (F): Strict, focusing on Christ as the savior.
- Quakers (E): More about communal worship and sacrifice.
- Greek Orthodox (D): Mix of influences, less strict.
- Baptists (G): Strict, Christ as the savior.
- Mormons (H): Focus on scriptural interpretation, not doctrine.
- Puritans (I): Very strict, focusing on Christ and the Trinity.
- Anglicans (J): Mix of Catholic and Protestant, moderate.

The question is about a "stripped-down Christianity", which might mean more of a strict doctrine approach. So the answer would be B, C, F, G, or I.

Wait, but the options are only one letter. So perhaps the answer is B, as the most widely recognized as a strict, dogmatic approach.

Alternatively, the question might be looking for the one that is as opposed to the more traditional, broader Christian picture. So perhaps the answer is B: Lutherans.

Wait, no. The question is about promoting a stripped-down Christianity. That might mean more about doctrine than about the broader picture.

Wait, perhaps the answer is the ones that emphasize doctrine over communal aspects or individualism. So B, C, F, G, I are dogmatic.

Wait, but the options are all different denominations, so the question is, which one is most known for being strict.

I think the answer is B: Lutherans, because they are known for their strict approach, focusing on Christ's definition of sainthood and the gospels.

The question asks which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity, focusing on strictness, doctrine, or dogmatic approach. Here's the analysis:

- **A: Roman Catholic**: Known for theology, not a strict doctrine.
- **B: Lutherans**: Strict, focusing on Christ's Definition of Sainthood and the gospels.
- **C: Methodists**: Strict, emphasizing doctrine similar to Lutherans.
- **D: Greek Orthodox**: Mix of influences, less strict.
- **E: Quakers**: Mix of religious and communal aspects.
- **F: Seventh-day Adventists**: Strict, focusing on Christ as the savior.
- **G: Baptists**: Strict, Christ as the savior.
- **H: Mormons**: Focus on scriptural interpretation, not doctrine.
- **I: Puritans**: Very strict, focusing on Christ and the Trinity.
- **J: Anglicans**: Moderate approach.

The most commonly recognized strict approach is the Lutherans (B), as they are known for their focus on Christ's Definition of Sainthood and the gospels. 

**Answer: B**
