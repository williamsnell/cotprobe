Okay, so I need to approximate the integral of sin²(x) from 0 to pi using the Trapezoidal Rule. Hmm, the question gives me multiple-choice answers, so I should probably figure this out step by step.

Wait, what's the Trapezoidal Rule again? Oh right, it's a method to approximate the integral by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids. The formula for the Trapezoidal Rule when you have n intervals is (Δx/2) * [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + ... + 2f(xₙ₋₁) + f(xₙ)], where Δx is the width of each trapezoid. Or wait, more accurately, each trapezoid's area is (Δx/2)*(f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1})), so for n intervals, it's a sum of these terms.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact setup. Let me think again. The integral from a to b is approximated as Δx/2 [f(a) + 2f(a+Δx) + 2f(a+2Δx) + ... + 2f(b-Δx) + f(b)], where Δx is (b-a)/n. Oh right, so the first and last terms are multiplied by 1, and the others are multiplied by 2.

So for the integral from 0 to pi of sin²(x) dx, let's set it up. I need to choose the number of intervals. Wait, the question didn't specify the number of intervals. Oh, wait, looking back at the question, it says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh, wait, the question says "use the Trapezoidal Rule with to approximate..." but I think maybe it's implied to use a certain number of intervals. Or perhaps the question expects me to use a default, like n=1 or n=2. Or wait, maybe I should read the problem again.

Wait, the question says "Use the Trapezoidal Rule with to approximate...", but perhaps it's a typo. Oh, no, maybe it's assuming a certain number of intervals. Looking at the options, the choices are all decimal numbers, so maybe the integral equals one of those. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a specific number of intervals, like n=100, but that might not be needed. Or perhaps the correct number of intervals is 2, which is a common choice.

Wait, let me think about what the exact integral of sin²(x) from 0 to pi is. I remember that the integral of sin²x is (x/2 - sin(2x)/4) evaluated from 0 to pi. So substituting pi and 0: (pi/2 - 0) - (0 - 0) = pi/2. So the exact integral is pi/2, which is approximately 1.570796. Oh, wait, that's one of the options. So option D is 1.570796. But wait, the question says "use the Trapezoidal Rule with to approximate...". So maybe the approximation is close to pi/2, but perhaps with some error. But I'm not sure if the question is expecting me to perform the approximation with a specific number of intervals. Wait, maybe it's using n=1, which would make the trapezoidal rule just a single trapezoid. Let me check.

If n=1, the formula becomes Δx/2 [f(0) + f(pi)]. Since Δx = (pi - 0)/1 = pi. So (pi/2) [ sin²(0) + sin²(pi) ]. Both terms are zero, so the integral would be zero. But that doesn't make sense because the actual integral is pi/2. So I'm probably supposed to use a larger number of intervals, like n=2 or n=4, to get a better approximation.

Wait, let's try n=2. Then Δx = (pi -0)/2 = pi/2. The trapezoidal formula for n=2 would be (pi/4) [f(0) + 2f(pi/2) + f(pi)]. Let's compute each term:

f(0) = sin²(0) =0.

f(pi/2) = sin²(pi/2)=1.

f(pi)=0.

So the sum inside the brackets is 0 + 2*(1) + 0 = 2. Multiply by pi/4: (pi/4)*2 = pi/2 ≈ 1.570796. Oh! That's the same as the exact value. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but when n=2, the approximation is exactly the same as the exact integral. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's re-calculate. For n=2, it's two intervals, so the trapezoids are from 0 to pi/2 and pi/2 to pi. Each has width pi/2.

Wait, wait, the trapezoidal rule formula is (Δx/2) [f(x0) + 2(f(x1) + f(x2)) + ... + f(xn)].

So for n=2, the formula becomes (pi/2 /2) [f(0) + 2*f(pi/2) + f(pi)].

Which is (pi/4) [0 + 2*(1) +0] = (pi/4)*2 = pi/2. Which is correct. So the approximation gives pi/2.

So the Trapezoidal Rule with n=2 gives the exact result for this integral. Hmm, that's interesting. So perhaps the correct answer is D: 1.570796.

Wait, but what about n=1. Let me check that again. For n=1, the trapezoidal rule would compute (pi/2) [f(0) + f(pi)] = (pi/2)(0 + 0) =0, which is wrong. So n=2 is better.

So in that case, the Trapezoidal rule with n=2 gives us the exact value for the integral. So the approximation is pi/2, which is option D. So the answer should be D.

To approximate the integral \(\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) \, dx\) using the Trapezoidal Rule, we first note that the exact value of this integral is \(\pi/2 \approx 1.570796\). The Trapezoidal Rule with \(n=2\) intervals gives the exact result because the function is symmetric and the trapezoids perfectly approximate the area under the curve. 

Thus, the approximate value using the Trapezoidal Rule with \(n=2\) is:
