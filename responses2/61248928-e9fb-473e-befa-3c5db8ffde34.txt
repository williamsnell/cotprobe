Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, the scenario is a rock dropping onto a smooth pond. A few moments later, a wave is produced, and when it arrives at the shore, it touches the child's ankles. The question is about which observation shows that the wave hitting the child's feet carries less energy than when it was first created.

Hmm, I remember that when waves are created by a disturbance, like a rock, the energy is transferred to the medium, which is the water in this case. So, the initial energy is in the wave as it was created, and as it travels, energy is transferred along the wave.

Wait, so the wave that hits the child's feet must have less energy than the wave it was created with. Because the child's feet would absorb some of it or maybe the wave has slowed down or something. But wait, the question is about the energy, not the speed or height.

Let me think about wave properties. I recall that when a wave moves through a medium, its energy depends on two main factors: the amplitude (height) and the wavelength. The energy per unit area is proportional to the square of the amplitude. So, a taller wave (higher amplitude) has more energy, right? But the energy per wavelength (like the intensity) depends on the square of the amplitude and inversely on the wavelength.

Wait, but in this case, the wave is moving and reaches the shore. So the initial wave is created by the rock's impact. The wave's energy is transmitted as it moves. So when it arrives at the child's feet, the wave's energy is less because some of it is absorbed by the child's feet or perhaps the wave's energy is being lost as it's transmitted to the shore.

But wait, how does the wave's energy change as it travels? Let me think. The wave's energy depends on the amount of disturbance. The initial wave is created by the impact, which has a certain energy. As the wave propagates, it transfers that energy along. So the energy of the wave remains the same as it moves. But the question is about the wave that arrives at the child's feet. So the wave's energy at that point is less than the original wave's because the wave is moving from the source to the shore, and some energy is lost as it travels. Or maybe the wave's speed increases as it travels, but that's about momentum, not energy.

Wait, the options given are about observations that show less energy. So looking at the options:

A: Turbulent wave. I think turbulent waves cause more energy spreading, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Turbulence could imply more energy spread, but the child's feet might have absorbed some of it, leading to less energy leaving the area.

B: Split into smaller waves. That would mean the wave broke, but the question says the wave arrives at the shore, so probably not. If it splits, it must have been a breaking wave, but the question doesn't mention breaking. So probably not B.

C: Pulse's width becomes greater. That would mean the wave is losing energy because the wave's energy is spreading out. Because the width is related to the wavelength and amplitude. So if the width increases, maybe the wave is losing energy. But I'm not sure if this is the right option.

D: Height has become greater. That doesn't make sense because if the wave is losing energy, its height should decrease. So D is not correct.

E: Wave is moving more slowly. Wait, but when a wave moves through a medium, its speed depends on the medium and the wave's frequency. But the question is about energy loss during propagation. So if a wave is moving more slowly, its speed is lower. Does that affect energy? I think the energy is transmitted as the wave moves. So if the wave is slower, maybe the energy per unit area is lower, but the total energy remains the same. So, the wave's speed doesn't directly cause energy loss.

F: Pulse's width has become smaller. That's about the wavelength. If the wave is losing energy, maybe the wavelength increases. Or if the width (wavelength) increases, perhaps because the wave is spreading out. So the width becomes bigger, implying more energy loss. So F says the width becomes smaller, which would be the opposite of what's happening. So F is probably not correct.

G: Wave speed increased. No, because the wave is moving from the source to the shore, so it's losing energy, not gaining. So G is incorrect.

H: Height has become smaller. Oh, if the wave is losing energy, then the height should decrease. So H is the opposite of what we want. So H is not correct.

I: Temperature change. The question doesn't mention any heating or cooling. So probably not.

J: Color change. Not relevant here, unless the wave is absorbing light, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, so the correct answer should be the one that shows the wave's energy has decreased. Let me think about the wave's characteristics.

Wave energy is proportional to amplitude squared (E ~ (a)^2), and also inversely proportional to the wavelength (E ~ (a² / λ)). So if the wave is losing energy as it travels, the amplitude decreases, or the wavelength increases.

Which option indicates that the wave is losing energy? Let's look again.

The options are about the wave characteristics. For example, the width of the wave (option F) could indicate the wavelength. If the width becomes larger (option F), the wavelength is longer, which would mean the wave is losing energy.

Alternatively, the height (option D) would show more energy. So the correct one is not D or F.

So the wave's energy is less at the shore. So which observation would indicate that?

Option F: The wave's width has become smaller. So if the width is smaller, the wavelength is shorter. Which would mean the wave is losing energy, because the same energy is spread out over a longer wavelength. So this would make the wave's height (amplitude) decrease.

So option F says the width (λ) has become smaller, which would lead to less energy. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but another possibility is that the wave's speed has changed. If the wave is moving more slowly, that's just its speed, but doesn't directly affect the energy. Unless it's because the wave's frequency is changing.

Wait, the speed of a wave on a surface (like water) can be affected by the speed at which the wave is moving along the surface. But in this scenario, the wave is moving from the rock to the shore, so the speed of the wave would be affected by the speed of the wave itself. Wait, no, the wave's speed is determined by the medium (water) and the properties of the medium. If the wave is moving slower, perhaps because it's slowed by the water's surface tension or something else. But I don't think that's the main point here. The key is the energy.

So the question is which observation indicates less energy. So the correct answer is F, because the wave's width (or wavelength) is smaller, so the energy is less.

To determine which observation provides evidence that the portion of the wave hitting the child's ankles carries less energy than when it was first created by the rock's impact, we analyze the relationship between wave characteristics and energy.

When a wave travels through a medium like water, its energy is proportional to the square of its amplitude and inversely proportional to its wavelength. As the wave moves from the source to the shore, it loses energy due to absorption by the medium and absorption at the boundaries. This results in a decrease in the wave's amplitude and wavelength.

**Option F** states that the wave's width (wavelength) has become smaller. A smaller wavelength indicates that the wave is spreading out more, which aligns with the energy loss as the wave travels. This makes F the correct answer, as it directly shows that the wave's energy has decreased.

Other options are analyzed as follows:
- **A**: Turbulent wave implies more energy spreading, which is not relevant here.
- **B**: Splitting into smaller waves would require breaking of the wave, which is not mentioned in the scenario.
- **C**: A greater width could indicate energy spreading, but the question asks about energy loss at the shore.
- **D**: Height increasing would imply energy gain, which contradicts the scenario.
- **E**: Moving more slowly is about speed, not energy loss.
- **G**: Increased speed would imply energy gain, which is incorrect.
- **H**: Height decreasing would imply energy loss, but the question asks about the wave's width.
- **I**: Temperature change is unrelated to the energy loss discussed.
- **J**: Color change is irrelevant to the energy dynamics.
- **K**: No other options provide a clearer indication of energy loss.

Thus, the correct answer is **F**, as it directly indicates that the wave's energy has decreased due to spreading out over a larger wavelength.
