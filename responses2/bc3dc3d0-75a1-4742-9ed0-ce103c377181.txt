Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, methane burning. Oh yeah, I remember that from my notes. The reaction is CH4 plus O2 producing CO2 and water vapor. The equation is CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g). 

The question says that the final pressure of the gaseous products is 6.25 torr, and we need to find the partial pressure of the water vapor. Wait, partial pressure, right. Oh, right, according to Dalton's Law, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. But wait, the problem is that the reaction produces both CO2 and H2O, and their pressures are probably in the gaseous products. So the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of CO2 and H2O.

Wait, but when a gas is produced in a reaction, like in this case, the pressure of each gas is proportional to their moles. So first, I think I need to find out the mole ratio of CO2 to H2O in the reaction. Let's see, the balanced equation is 1 mole of CH4 and 2 moles of O2 producing 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:2 for CO2:H2O.

Wait no, in the balanced equation, the ratio is 1 mole of CH4:2 moles O2 → 1 mole CO2:2 moles H2O. So the moles of CO2 and H2O are in the ratio 1:2. So for every mole of CO2 produced, two moles of H2O are produced.

But wait, the total pressure is 6.25 torr. That's the sum of the partial pressures of CO2 and H2O. Because total pressure is the sum of all partial pressures.

So let's let the partial pressure of CO2 be x torr, then the partial pressure of H2O would be 2x torr because the ratio is 1:2. So total pressure is x + 2x = 3x.

The total pressure is given as 6.25 torr. So 3x = 6.25 → x = 6.25 /3 ≈ 2.0833 torr.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because the ratio is 1 mole : 2 moles. So per mole of CH4, you get 2 moles of H2O. So for every 1 mole of CH4, you get 2 n of H2O and 1 n of CO2.

Wait, so the way to model it is that the moles of CO2 is 1, H2O is 2, which makes the total 3 moles for every mole of CH4 reacting. So for every 3 moles of gaseous products, CO2 is 1/3 and H2O is 2/3.

Hold on, but the total pressure is 6.25 torr. So each mole of the product contributes to the pressure. So the partial pressure of each gas is its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure.

Mole fraction of CO2 would be (1/3), H2O is (2/3). So partial pressure of CO2 is (1/3)*6.25 = approx 2.0833 torr. Partial pressure of H2O is (2/3)*6.25 ≈ 4.1667 torr.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 4.16 torr. So that would be the answer? But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait another approach: the reaction equation gives a 1:2 mole ratio of CO2 and H2O. So for every 3 moles of gaseous products, 1 is CO2 and 2 are H2O. So the partial pressures would be proportional to their moles.

So total pressure is 6.25 torr. The mole ratio is 1:2 for CO2 to H2O. So the total parts are 3. So CO2 is 1/3 of the total, H2O is 2/3.

So CO2 partial pressure is (1/3) * 6.25 = ~2.0833 torr. H2O is (2/3)*6.25= ~4.1667 torr.

So looking at the options, H is 4.16 torr, which is 2/3 *6.25. That's about 4.1666… which matches. So the partial pressure of H2O is approximately 4.16 torr.

So the correct answer would be option H.

To determine the partial pressure of water vapor (H₂O) in the gaseous products, we start by analyzing the balanced chemical equation:

**CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**

From the stoichiometry of the reaction, the mole ratio of CO₂ to H₂O is 1:2. This means for every 1 mole of CO₂ produced, 2 moles of H₂O are produced. Consequently, the partial pressures of CO₂ and H₂O in the gaseous products are proportional to their mole ratios.

The total pressure of the gaseous products is given as 6.25 torr. To find the partial pressures, we calculate the mole fractions:

- The total number of moles of gaseous products is \(1 + 2 = 3\) moles.
- The mole fraction of CO₂ is \(\frac{1}{3}\), and the mole fraction of H₂O is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

Using these mole fractions, the partial pressures are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Partial pressure of CO₂} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6.25 \, \text{torr} = 2.083 \, \text{torr}
\]

\[
\text{Partial pressure of H₂O} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6.25 \, \text{torr} = 4.1667 \, \text{torr}
\]

The problem asks for the partial pressure of water vapor, which is approximately 4.1667 torr. Among the given options, this corresponds to option **H: 4.16 torr**.
