Okay, so I've got this problem here about the discount rate of a loan. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. Hmm.

The question says Mr. White received $972.50 from ABC Loan Company. He signed a loan agreement to pay $1000 at the end of 180 days. I need to find the discount rate. The options are all percentages, so I'll need to calculate the correct one.

Wait, so discount rate. I remember that discount rate is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the loan. The formula for discount rate when you have a single period (days) is something like (Face Value - Present Value)/Present Value, multiplied by (360 divided by days), right?

The formula is:
Discount Rate = (Face Value - Present Value) / Present Value * (360 / Days)

Let me plug in the numbers. Face Value is $1000, Present Value is $972.50, and Days are 180.

So, the difference is 1000 - 972.50 = $27.50.

Then, 27.50 / 972.50 = let's calculate that. Hmm, 27.5 divided by 972.5. Let me see, 972.5 * 0.028 is about 27.21, which is close. So 0.028 approximately.

Then multiply by 360/180 = 2. So 0.028 * 2 = 0.056, which is 5.6%.

Looking at the options, option H is 8.0% per year. That's higher than 5.6%. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of simple interest. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the discount yield, which is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: The discount rate is the rate that when applied to the present value gives the present value plus discount equals the face value. So, the formula is:

Discount Rate = (Face Value - Present Value) / Face Value * (365 / Days) for a year. Or wait, sometimes it's based on 360 days.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The standard formula for discount rate is:

Discount Rate = (Face Value - Present Value) / Present Value * (365 / Days) but sometimes it's based on 360. Wait, but in this case, the days are 180. Let me compute it again.

So, (1000 - 972.50) = 27.50. 27.50 / 972.50 = 0.028228 approximately.

Multiply by (360 / 180) = 2. So 0.028228 * 2 = 0.056456, which is about 5.6456%.

Looking at the options, H is 8.0% per year. That's higher, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question is asking for the discount rate using simple interest, but with a different calculation. Or perhaps the question is about the rate at which the present value would grow to face value.

Wait, maybe the formula should be:

Discount rate per annum = (Face Value - Present Value) / Present Value * (360 / Days) * 100.

So that would be (27.50 / 972.50) * (360/180) = 0.028228 * 2 = 0.056456, which is 5.6456%. Close to 5.65%, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options: H is 8.0% per year. Could I have miscalculated?

Wait, perhaps the question is using 365 days instead of 360. Let me try that.

(27.50 / 972.50) = ~0.028228. Multiply by 365 / 180 ≈ 2.0278. So 0.028228 * 2.0278 ≈ 0.0572, which is about 5.72%. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the discount rate is the simple interest rate over 180 days. So, the formula could be:

Discount Rate = (Face Value - Present Value) * (360 / Days) / Present Value * 100.

Which is the same as before. So that's 5.6456%. Hmm, but that's not an option.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, option G is 6.5%, H is 8%, etc. Maybe I should consider the discount yield, which is (Face Value - Present Value) / Face Value * (360 / Days). Let me calculate that.

(27.50 / 1000) * (360/180) = 0.0275 * 2 = 0.055 or 5.5%. That's option C. Hmm, but that's the discount yield, not the rate. But in this case, the question is asking for the discount rate, which is the rate at which the present value is discounted to get the face value. So perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. The discount rate is the rate at which the present value is discounted to get the face value. So, the formula is:

Face Value = Present Value * (1 + (Discount Rate * Days / 360)).

So, rearranging to solve for Discount Rate:

Discount Rate = ((Face Value / Present Value) - 1) * (360 / Days).

Which is the same as I did before.

So, 1000/972.50 = 1.028229.

Subtract 1: 0.028229.

Multiply by (360/180) = 2: 0.056458, or 5.6458% approximately.

Looking back at the options, H is 8.0% per year. That's higher than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 972.50 plus 5.6458% per year for 180 days. Let me compute that.

5.6458% per year is 5.6458/365 ≈ 0.01548% per day.

180 days would be 180 * 0.01548 ≈ 2.786%. So adding to 972.50, 972.50 * 1.02786 ≈ 972.50 + 27.22 = 999.72, not 1000. So my calculation is probably correct, but the options don't have 5.6%. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different number of days. Wait, 180 days is exactly two months, so I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the discount is calculated as (Face Value - PV) / PV, which is 27.50 / 972.50 = 0.028229, which is 2.8229%. But that doesn't seem to match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effective annual rate. Wait, but that's another concept. Let's see:

The discount rate is 5.6458%, which is approximately 5.65%. None of the options exactly match, but let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 2.75%

B:7.5%

C:5.5%

D:5.0%

E:9.0%

F:4.5%

G:6.5%

H:8.0%

I:4.0%

J:3.0%

Hmm, none of them is 5.65%. Wait, but option H is 8.0% per year. That's higher than our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another approach: Maybe the discount is calculated as (Face Value - Present Value) / Face Value * 365 / Days. Let's see.

(27.50 / 1000) * (365 / 180) = 0.0275 * 2.0277778 ≈ 0.0557, which is about 5.57%. That's close to option G (6.5%) or C (5.5%). Hmm, 5.57% is closer to option C (5.5%) or H (8.0%). So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 5.5% per year.

Wait, so based on this, the discount rate is approximately 5.57%, which is closest to option C, 5.5%. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but earlier calculation with 360 days gave me 5.645%, which isn't an option, but with 365 days, it's 5.57%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question expects the discount rate per annum, but the days are 180. Let me think about how the discount is calculated.

Another way: The present value is $972.50, face value $1000, 180 days.

The discount rate can be calculated as:

(1000 - 972.50)/972.50 = 27.50 / 972.50 = 0.028229, which is 2.8229% over 180 days. To find the annual rate, multiply by (365 / 180) ≈ 2.0278.

0.028229 * 2.0278 ≈ 0.0572, which is about 5.72%, which isn't an option. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is using simple interest instead of compound. Let's see.

Simple interest formula: PV = FV - (FV * I * T), but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded and actually refers to the discount period. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the discount rate in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the effective annual rate. Let me compute that.

The rate for 180 days is 5.6458%. So, the effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.056458)^(365/180) - 1. Let's calculate that.

0.056458 is the rate over 180 days. So, the number of periods per year is 365/180 ≈ 2.02778.

So, (1 + 0.056458)^2.02778 - 1.

Calculating 1.056458^2 is approx 1.1162. But wait, more accurately, the exact exponent would be (1.056458)^(2.02778).

Using logarithm approximation, but maybe it's easier to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the effective annual rate formula.

Effective annual rate = (1 + (0.056458)^(365/180)) - 1. Hmm, but that might be messy.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the rate that when applied to the present value gives the face value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely because the options are given. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the present value factor. PV = FV * (1 - (discount rate) * (days/365)).

So, 972.50 = 1000 * (1 - (d * 180/365)).

Wait, solving for d:

1 - d*(180/365) = 972.50 / 1000 = 0.9725.

So, 1 - 0.9725 = d*(180/365).

0.0275 = d*(0.49315).

So, d = 0.0275 / 0.49315 ≈ 0.0557, which is 5.57%.

So, the discount rate is approximately 5.57%, which is close to option C's 5.5% and option H's 8.0%. Since 5.57% is closer to 5.5%, option C is the best fit.

Wait, the options don't have 5.57%, but option C is 5.5%. So that's the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to have a discount rate that's 5.5%, which is option C.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves calculating the discount rate for a loan agreement where Mr. White receives $972.50 and agrees to pay $1000 in 180 days. The discount rate is the rate at which the present value is discounted to yield the face value. The formula used is:

\[
\text{Discount Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Present Value}}{\text{Present Value}} \right) \times \left( \frac{360}{\text{Days}} \right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{Discount Rate} = \left( \frac{1000 - 972.50}{972.50} \right) \times \left( \frac{360}{180} \right) = \left( \frac{27.50}{972.50} \right) \times 2 \approx 0.056458 \text{ or } 5.6458\%
\]

This value does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, considering the closest match and the context of the question, the closest option is **5.5% per year (Option C)**. This is likely the intended answer.
