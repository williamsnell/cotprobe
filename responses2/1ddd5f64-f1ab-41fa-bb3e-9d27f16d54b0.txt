Question:

All of the following support the endosymbiotic theory that ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent, free-living prokaryotes EXCEPT:

Options:

A: Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission.
B: Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic cells.
C: Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.
D: Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.

Okay, so I've got this question about the endosymbiotic theory. Hmm, what's it all about again? Oh right, it's about how mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are organelles in eukaryotic cells, came to exist. The theory suggests that they were once free-living prokaryotic organisms.

The question is asking which option does NOT support the idea that their origins were prokaryotes. The exception is the one that doesn't fit. 

So the options are A to D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently by binary fission similar to prokaryotes. Wait, binary fission is a prokaryotic method, right? So that would support the idea that they evolved from prokaryotes. So this supports the theory, so it's not the exception.

Option B states that their ribosomes are more like bacteria. Oh, prokaryotes have ribosomes, and eukaryotes have their own. So if the ribosomes are more like bacteria, that's a sign that they were once free-living, so that fits the theory as well. So this supports, not the exception.

Option C suggests they function independently from the host. Wait, prokaryotes do function on their own, right? So mitochondrial and chloroplast function as organelles, not relying on the host. So this would support the theory. Not the exception.

Option D says they have a single circular chromosome and no histones or proteins. Wait, the endosymbiotic theory is more about the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts being free-living, not necessarily their chromosome structure. Also, prokaryotes have DNA, so a single circular chromosome isn't a prokaryotic feature. Oh, wait, prokaryotes have circular chromosomes, but eukaryotes have linear. So if the D option says the organelles have a single circular chromosome, that doesn't fit the prokaryote origin. Because prokaryotes are single-celled eukaryotes, but their origins were free-living. If the organelles have a circular chromosome, that would imply they came from eukaryotic origins, not prokaryotes. So this would be the exception, which doesn't support the endosymbiotic theory; that is, the correct answer is D. Because the question is which option "EXCEPT" the theory. So, the exception is D.

The question asks which option does NOT support the endosymbiotic theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent, free-living prokaryotes. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Mitochondria and chloroplasts dividing by binary fission, similar to prokaryotes, supports the theory as prokaryotic fission is a hallmark of their origin. **This supports the theory.**

- **Option B**: Ribosomes resembling bacteria rather than eukaryotic cells aligns with the idea of free-living origins, supporting the theory. **This supports the theory.**

- **Option C**: Independent functioning from the host supports the theory, as free-living organelles are known to function independently. **This supports the theory.**

- **Option D**: A single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins is a prokaryotic feature, which would indicate origins from eukaryotes. This contradicts the theory of prokaryotic origins. **This does not support the theory.**

The exception is **Option D**, as it points to eukaryotic origins for mitochondria and chloroplasts, which conflicts with the endosymbiotic theory.

**ANSWER: D**
