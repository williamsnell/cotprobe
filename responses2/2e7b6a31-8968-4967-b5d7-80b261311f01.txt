B: If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.
C: Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by entails that Russell makes dinner.
D: Russell's making dinner is a sufficient condition for Izzy not playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by.

Okay, so I've got this logic problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about translating a given propositional logic formula into a natural English sentence using the provided key. The formula is (~B • E) ⊃ D. And the options are A through J. 

First, I need to understand what each letter represents. The key says:
A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book. → So A is true if that's the case.
B: Izzy plays Minecraft. → So B is true for Izzy.
C: Emily stops working. → C is true for Emily.
D: Russell makes dinner. → D is true when Russell is making dinner.
E: Ashleigh stops by. → E is true if Ashleigh stops by.

The formula given is (~B • E) ⊃ D. Let me parse that. The notation (~B) is the negation of B, so "Izzy does NOT play Minecraft." Then, "E" means Ashleigh stops by. So (~B • E) is the conjunction of those two negations and E, meaning both are true. Then, this entire conjunction implies D, which is that Russell makes dinner.

In logical terms, the implication (A ⊃ B) means "If A, then B." So in this case, if both "Izzy does NOT play Minecraft" and "Ashleigh stops by" are true, then it must be the case that Russell makes dinner. 

Now, translating this into English: "If both it's not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by, then Russell makes dinner." 

Looking at the options:

Option A: "If it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner." → Wait, that seems a bit off. The way it's phrased is a bit awkward. The conjunction in the antecedent is "both" but the way it's phrased is "both of them," which isn't correct English. It should be "both are true." So this option might not be correct.

Option B: "If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner." → This looks slightly better. The antecedent uses "both," which is more natural. So this might be the correct option.

Option C: "Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by entails that Russell makes dinner." → This translates to the logical statement (~B ∧ E) → D, which is exactly what the formula is. But the structure is a bit different. It's saying that the conjunction of B and E leads to D, which is a different way of phrasing it. The formula's structure is (~B • E) ⊃ D, so the sentence would be that if both (~B and E), then D. So this is similar but phrased differently. I'm not sure if option C is correct. 

Option D: "Russell's making dinner is a sufficient condition for Izzy not playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by." → This is going the other way. Sufficient condition would mean that if D is true, then B and E. But our formula is that if B is not true and E is true, then D is true. So option D is about D implying B and E, which isn't what the formula says. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "If both it's not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner." → This seems similar to option A and B, except maybe the wording. I think this is another variation.

Wait, the formula is (~B ∧ E) → D. So in English, it's "If both it's not the case that B and E, then D." So the correct translation is option A or B, depending on how it's phrased.

Looking again, option B is "If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner." The phrasing uses "both" which is correct as "and" in logic, but in natural language, "both" could be a bit awkward. Option A says "If it's not the case that both... then D." So both are true. 

But both phrasings are correct. So which is the better option? Let me look at the options again:

Option A: If it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.

Option B: If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.

Option C: Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by entails that Russell makes dinner.

Hmm. Option C seems to suggest that B and E imply D. But the formula is (~B ∧ E) → D. So that's not the same. So option C is incorrect.

So between A and B, both seem correct in their structure, but the wording of B uses "both" which is a bit more natural in English. So option B would be the correct translation.
</think>

The correct answer is option A or B. However, option B uses "both" which is more natural in English, so the best choice is:

A: If it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me go back. The formula is (~B ∧ E) ⊃ D. So the correct English translation is "If both it's not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner." So option B is correct.

Answer: B
