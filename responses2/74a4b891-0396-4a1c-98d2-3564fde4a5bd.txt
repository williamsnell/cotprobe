Question:

What is the principle of diminishing marginal returns?

Options:

A: A rule that describes how, after a certain level of performance, additional input does not yield any output
B: A point beyond which the output attributable to each additional unit of factor input will become less and less.
C: An economic principle that suggests a constant decrease in output with each additional input
D: An economic theory that predicts unlimited growth
E: The phenomenon where output increases exponentially with each additional input
F: The principle stating that output increases linearly with input
G: The idea that each unit of input improves the quality of output, regardless of how much is already being produced
H: The concept that each additional input doubles the output
I: The belief that each additional unit of input decreases the total cost of production
J: A process where increasing amounts of input lead to proportional increases in output

Okay, so I've got this question about the principle of diminishing marginal returns. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that this has something to do with production and costs. Let me think.

The question is asking which option correctly describes this principle. The options are A to J, each with a different statement. I need to pick the correct one.

Let me recall: The principle of diminishing marginal returns is about how adding more of one input while keeping others constant leads to a decrease in the marginal increase in output. So, the marginal product starts high and decreases as more input is used. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a rule that after a certain point, additional input doesn't yield any output. That doesn't sound right because it's not about no output but a decrease. Also, I think it's not just about not yielding any output but a drop.

Option B: A point beyond which output per additional input decreases less. Wait, that's the same as what I just thought. It's about marginal returns decreasing, so B seems correct.

Option C: Constant decrease in output with each additional input. No, that's not right. It's not a constant decrease; it's that the increase is getting smaller each time.

Option D: Economic theory predicting unlimited growth. No, that's not right. It's about diminishing returns, not growth.

Option E: Exponential growth with input. That's more like the law of diminishing returns in the long run, but it's actually the opposite. Or maybe it's a different concept. Wait, noâ€”actually, in the short run, increasing input leads to diminishing returns, but in the long run, you can vary all inputs, leading to increasing returns. So E might not be the correct term.

Option F: Linear increase in output. No, that's the opposite. It's about the marginal returns decreasing, not the total being linear.

Option G: Each unit improves output, regardless of production. I think that's more about perfect substitutes, which isn't the case here. This is about diminishing returns, not an absolute improvement.

Option H: Each input doubles output. That's the law of doubling or the concept of diminishing returns, but it's a specific case. Not the general principle.

Option I: Belief that each unit lowers costs. That's the law of diminishing returns in the context of cost, but the principle is about returns, not costs per unit.

Option J: Increasing inputs lead to proportional increases in output. That's the law of returns, not the principle of diminishing returns.

Wait, so now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The principle is about the diminishing marginal returns, which means each additional unit of input contributes less to output. So the correct option is B: a point beyond which each additional input leads to less output per unit.

Looking back, option B says a point beyond which output attributable to each additional unit becomes less. That's correct because it's about the marginal increase getting smaller. So the answer should be B.

The principle of diminishing marginal returns refers to the phenomenon where, as more of an input is added while others are held constant, the marginal increase in output decreases. This means that each additional unit of input contributes less to the total output.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A:** Incorrect. The principle doesn't involve no output but a decrease in marginal output.
- **B:** Correct. This option accurately states that beyond a certain point, each additional input leads to less output per unit.
- **C:** Incorrect. It doesn't describe a constant decrease but diminishing returns.
- **D:** Incorrect. This is a theory about growth, not marginal returns.
- **E:** Incorrect. Exponential growth is the opposite of diminishing returns.
- **F:** Incorrect. It's a linear increase scenario, not the principle of diminishing returns.
- **G:** Incorrect. This describes an absolute improvement, not marginal diminishing.
- **H:** Incorrect. This is a specific case, not the general principle.
- **I:** Incorrect. This relates to cost considerations, not the principle itself.
- **J:** Incorrect. This describes the law of returns, not marginal diminishing.

**Answer:** B
