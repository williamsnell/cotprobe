Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric charges and forces. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember from my classes that Coulomb's Law is involved here. Coulomb's Law says that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1*q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant.

The problem states that two balls are electrically charged and separated by a short distance, producing a force of 50 μN. Then, the mass of one ball is doubled while the other's charge and distance remain the same. The question is asking what the new electric force becomes.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The problem says the mass of one ball is doubled, but it doesn't mention changing the charge. So, hold on, the charges are the same. Because the original force is 50 μN, which is the Coulombic force between them.

So, initially, the force F is 50 μN. When one charge's mass is doubled, but I don't think that affects the electric force. Oh wait, wait, the question is about the electric force. Electric force depends only on the charges and the distance. Mass doesn't directly factor into Coulomb's Law. But wait, could the mass affect something else, like gravitational force? But the question is about electric force, so I don't think so.

So, the electric force would remain the same. Oh, wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no, because if one of the masses is doubled, that might affect the weight, but the question is about electric force, which is a separate concept. So, the electric force is only due to the charges and distance, so doubling the mass of one ball wouldn't change the electric force. So the answer should be 50 μN.

Looking at the options, option H is 50 μN. But wait, wait a minute. Let me read the question again. Oh, wait, the question says, "keeping the charge of each ball the same, the mass of one of the balls but not the other is doubled." So, the charge is the same, but the mass is altered. But since electric force doesn't involve mass, the force remains the same. So, the answer is H, 50 μN.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: wait, could the electric force involve something else? For example, if the mass is doubled, but perhaps the charge is still the same, but the electric field is changing. No, because the electric force depends on the charges. So, only the product q1*q2 matters. So, the electric force remains 50 μN.

So the correct answer should be option H: 50 μN.

The problem involves two electrically charged balls separated by a short distance, producing an electric force of 50 μN. When the mass of one ball is doubled, the electric force remains unchanged because the electric force depends only on the charges of the balls and the distance between them, not on their masses. Therefore, the new electric force is still 50 μN.

Answer: H
