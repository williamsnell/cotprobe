Okay, so I've got this question about bankruptcy and creditors. Let me try to figure it out.

The question says Mr. Williams filed a petition for bankruptcy. He has $2,240 in assets and $5,600 in liabilities. Now, a creditor named Johnson has a claim of $1,725. We need to find out how much he can expect to receive.

Hmm, I remember that in bankruptcy, the claimant's assets are what the court considers, not the total of all debts. So if the assets are less than the total debts, the court typically gets rid of the case, right? But wait, the question is about what the creditor can expect. If the claimant's assets are more than the creditor's claim, the creditor can't claim that amount. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In a bankruptcy, the court can only use the available assets to cover the claims. So if the total assets are $2,240 and the creditor's claim is $1,725, the court can only deduct that from the assets because the assets are less than the claim. So the creditor would get the full amount of the claim, or maybe just whatever is left. Wait, no. No, the claim is a claim against the assets. So the court can only claim the assets that are greater than the claim. So, if the claim is $1,725 and the assets are $2,240, the court can't claim more than $1,725 because the assets are less than the claim. So the creditor would receive the full $1,725. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in some cases, the court might stop the case if the assets are insufficient. But the question is about the amount the creditor can expect, not about the case proceeding.

Alternatively, another approach: in the case of a bankruptcy, the court can only use the available assets to satisfy the claims. So if the claim is $1,725 and the assets are $2,240, which is less than the claim, the court can't fulfill the claim. So the creditor wouldn't be able to receive anything? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again. The claimant's assets are $2,240. The claim is $1,725. So the court can't cover the claim because the assets are less than the claim. So the claimant's assets are insufficient to cover the claim. Therefore, the creditor cannot receive any payment beyond the available assets. Wait, but if the assets are exactly equal to the claim, the claimant can be paid the full amount. If the assets are more, then the claimant is still covered up to the assets. But if the claim is more than the assets, the court will likely terminate the case and the claimant will have to pay in full, or maybe the claimant has to pay the remaining. But in this scenario, the claim is $1,725 and the assets are $2,240.

Wait, but the claim is $1,725. So the court can only use up to that amount? No, wait. No, in a bankruptcy, the court uses the available assets to cover all of the claim. So if the claim is $1,725 and the assets are $2,240, the court can only use the $1,725 because that's what the creditor is claiming for. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the assets are more than the claim. So the court can only use the available assets to cover the claim, but since the assets are more than the claim, the claimant can be paid the full amount of the claim. Or wait, no, the claimant's assets are used to cover the claim. So if the claim is $1,725, but the assets are $2,240, the court can cover the claim by using the $1,725, and the remaining $515 of assets would be kept by the court as uncomenced. So the creditor gets the full $1,725. Alternatively, some might think that since the assets are more than the claim, the claimant can be paid the full amount, but I'm a bit confused because this depends on whether the assets are used to cover the claim or not.

Wait, another angle: if the claimant's assets are less than the claim, the court can't even cover the claim. So the claimant can't be paid anything. But wait, that's not right because the assets are more than the claim. So the court can use the assets to cover the claim, but only up to the claim's amount. Or maybe the court can't even do that. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the creditor can't receive anything because the assets are insufficient, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options: option A is $1,725, which is the claim. But wait, no. Let me re-examine the question. The question is about how much the creditor can expect. So if the claim is $1,725, and the assets are $2,240, which is more than the claim, then the court can't claim more than the assets. So the creditor can receive $1,725. But wait, that doesn't seem right because if the claim is $1,725 and the assets are $2,240, the court can only use $1,725. So it's exactly the amount the claimant is claiming. Wait, no, that's not correct because the assets are more than the claim. So the claimant's assets are sufficient to cover the claim. So the claimant can be paid the full $1,725, but the court keeps the excess. So the creditor would receive $1,725. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose assets are $100, and a claim is $50. The court can only use up to $50, so the claimant can be paid $50, and the court keeps the remaining $50. So in this case, the claim is $1,725, and the assets are $2,240. So the court can use up to $1,725, so the claimant gets $1,725. So the answer would be A: $1,725.

Wait, but the options include other amounts too. Let me check the options again. Option A is $1,725, B is $1,120, C is $690, D is $2,240, E is $870, F is $860, G is $1,360, H is $345, I is $0, J is $5,600.

Wait, but the assets are $2,240, and the claim is $1,725. So if the assets are more than the claim, the court can use the claim's amount (i.e., $1,725) and the remaining $515 would be kept. So the claimant can be paid $1,725. So the answer is option A. Alternatively, is there a scenario where the assets are insufficient to cover the claim? Let me think. If the assets were $1,724, then the claimant couldn't be paid anything because the assets are insufficient. But in this case, the assets are $2,240, which is more than the claim of $1,725. So the claimant can be paid $1,725.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck because sometimes in bankruptcy, the claimant's assets are considered. So if the assets are more than the claim, the claimant can be paid the full amount. So the answer should be A: $1,725.

Alternatively, some sources say that the creditor can only recover the amount that the claimant's assets exceed the claim. So in this case, the claimant's assets are $2,240, and the claim is $1,725. So the excess is $515. But that would mean the creditor can only get $515. But none of the options have that. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, no. The correct approach is that the court uses the available assets to cover the claim. So if the claim is $1,725, and the assets are $2,240, the court can use the entire $1,725, leaving $515 in the court's pocket. So the claimant receives $1,725, and the court has $515. So the correct answer is A: $1,725.

Wait, but another thought: in some cases, the court can only use as much as the claimant's assets. So if the assets are less than the claim, the court can't even start, and the claimant has to pay in full. But in this case, the assets are more, so the court can use the entire claim's amount. Therefore, the answer is A: $1,725. So I'll go with A.

Mr. Williams has $2,240 in assets and $5,600 in liabilities. A creditor with a claim of $1,725 can expect to receive the full amount of the claim because the assets are sufficient to cover the claim. The court will use the available assets to satisfy the claim, leaving some assets in the court's pocket. Therefore, the correct answer is $1,725.

**Answer: A: $1,725**
