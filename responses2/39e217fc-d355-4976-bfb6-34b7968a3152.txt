Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about capital cities and whether they're located outside the "central core area" of a country. The options are from A to I, each with a different city. I'm a bit rusty on geography, but I'll try to think through each one.

First, let me understand what the question is asking. The central core area probably refers to the major cities or regions that are considered the main centers of a country. So, the capital cities that are outside this central core would be the ones that are less central or perhaps more regional.

Looking at each option:

A: Beijing, China. I know Beijing is the capital of China. The central core of China is a big city, so Beijing is definitely in the core.

B: Washington D.C., USA. D.C. is the capital, and it's in the heart of the U.S., so it's inside the central core.

C: Paris, France. Paris is the capital and also a major city, so again, it's within the central core.

D: Cairo, Egypt. Cairo is the capital of Egypt. I think Egypt's central core includes Cairo as the main capital, so it's probably not outside.

E: London, UK. London is the capital of the United Kingdom. It's the most populous country, and London is definitely a major city within the central core.

F: Berlin, Germany. Berlin is the capital and also a major city. It's part of the central business district of Germany, so it's within the core.

G: Moscow, Russia. Moscow is the capital of Russia, and I believe it's part of the central business area of Russia. So, it's within the central core.

H: Tokyo, Japan. Tokyo is the capital and the most populous country in the world. It's definitely a major city within the central core.

I: Abuja, Nigeria. Abuja is the capital of Nigeria. I'm not sure about its exact position, but I think it's a major city, maybe in the southern part of Nigeria. I don't recall it being outside the central core.

Wait, but let me think again. Abuja is a major city, but does it lie outside the central business area? I'm not sure. Maybe some argue that the capital is in the central core, but some might consider the rest of the country's cities as the core. Alternatively, perhaps Abuja is considered a regional capital.

Alternatively, perhaps the central core refers to major cities or major economic hubs. Abuja might be a regional hub, so it's not a central core city. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the central core in some contexts refers to the main urban areas. For example, in the UK, the central core includes major cities like London and Manchester. If that's the case, then cities like London or Manchester would be in the core, but cities like Moscow or Paris might be considered outside because they are more regional.

Wait, but the question is about capitals. So, for example, London is the capital, and its capital is also London. So, perhaps the capitals that are capitals of smaller or regional countries would be outside the central core areas of their respective countries.

Alternatively, maybe the central core refers to major cities, and any capital beyond that would be considered outside.

Wait, but the question is about the capitals, not the countries. So each city is the capital of a country. So, for a city to be in the central core, it must be a major city in its country's context.

So, for example, Moscow is a major city in Russia, so it's in the central core. Cairo is a capital city, so it's in the core as well.

But then, Abuja is a major city in Nigeria, so that's within the central core.

Wait, so maybe none of the capitals are outside the central core. But that can't be right because the question says one is outside.

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the central core refers to the major business districts, not necessarily major cities. But capitals are cities, so perhaps capitals that are major cities would be within the core.

Wait, but the question is about capitals being outside the central core. So, which capital is not a major city in its country.

Let me think again. Let me list the capitals and their countries:

Beijing: China – major city in the central core.

Washington D.C.: USA – capital, central core.

Paris: France – major city, central core.

Cairo: Egypt – capital, central core.

London: UK – capital, central core.

Berlin: Germany – capital, central business district.

Moscow: Russia – capital, central business district.

Tokyo: Japan – capital, central business.

Abuja: Nigeria – capital, major city.

So, all the capitals are major cities, meaning they are within the central core.

Wait, but that's impossible because the question says one is outside. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the concept. Maybe the central core refers to the major cities within the country's urban center, and capitals are outside.

Wait, another thought: maybe the central core refers to the major cities in the 'main' cities of a country. For example, in the UK, the central core includes the capital London, Manchester, and other major cities. So, perhaps the capitals of countries with smaller urban centers would be outside.

But in reality, all capitals are major cities. So perhaps the question is using a different definition.

Wait, Abidjan is a city in the Central African Republic. But that's not one of the options here. The options are capitals of countries, so Abuja is the only one outside the usual central core.

So, perhaps the central core refers to major cities, and Abuja is a regional capital, not a major one, hence outside.

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, the central core is considered to include major cities and some regional capitals. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the central core in some contexts refers to the major industrial cities, but even then, the capitals are also among the major industrial cities.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the options.

The options are A-I, with I being Abuja. Since all the capitals are major cities, perhaps the answer is not Abidjan or Abuja. But the options don't include Abidjan, only Abuja.

Wait, the options given are:

A: Beijing → China's capital, central core.

B: Washington D.C. → Capital of USA, central core.

C: Paris → France's capital, central core.

D: Cairo → Egypt's capital, central core.

E: London → UK's capital, central business.

F: Berlin → Germany's capital, central business.

G: Moscow → Russia's capital, central business.

H: Tokyo → Japan's capital, central business.

I: Abuja → Nigeria's capital, major city.

But the question is asking which capital is OUTSIDE the central core.

Wait, but all capitals are within the central core. So that's confusing. Maybe the question is using a different definition. Alternatively, perhaps the central core refers to the major cities in the country, and some capitals are outside of that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. Maybe in some contexts, the central core includes major cities, and the capitals that are major cities are considered central, while others are regional.

Alternatively, perhaps the capitals of countries that have major cities outside the central core.

Wait, perhaps the capitals of countries where the main cities are not the central core. But that doesn't make sense because all capitals are major cities.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking backward. The central core area refers to the major urban centers, and capitals are within those.

So, perhaps none of the capitals are outside. But the question states that one is.

Wait, that suggests I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider each option.

Wait, perhaps the capitals of the countries are not considered as major cities in the central core context. But that doesn't seem right because their capitals are the major cities.

Wait, maybe the central core refers to the major industrial cities, not the major cities. But even then, the capitals would still be major industrial cities.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the capitals are within the central business districts, and some are considered outside.

Wait, maybe the capitals of some countries are not part of the central business districts. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the central core refers to the major cities in the country, and some capitals might not be considered major cities. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the capitals are not part of the central core. For example, in some countries, the main cities are the central business districts, and the capital might be a regional city.

Wait, for example, in Germany, the central business district might be Darmstadt, but the capital is Berlin. So, perhaps in Germany, the capital is outside the central core in terms of major cities.

In that case, Berlin would be outside the central core, but looking back at the options, E is London, which is the capital of the UK, and the UK's central core includes London and Manchester, so London is in the core.

Wait, maybe the question is using a different definition. Another approach: the central core in some contexts refers to major cities, and the capitals are major cities, so perhaps none are outside.

Wait, but the question says one is outside. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, another angle: the capitals of some countries are in the central business districts, but the capitals of other countries are regional capitals. For example, in the UK, the capital is London, which is a major city, so it's in the core.

In Germany, the capital is Berlin, which is a major city, so in the core.

In the US, Washington D.C. is the capital, which is in the core.

In France, Paris is a major city, so core.

In China, Beijing is a major city, so core.

In Egypt, Cairo is a major city, so core.

In Russia, Moscow is a major city, so core.

In Japan, Tokyo is a major city, so core.

So all the capitals are major cities, meaning they are within the central core.

But the question asks for a city outside the central core. Since all are within, perhaps the answer is none, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and one of them is outside.

Wait, perhaps Abuja is outside the central core in some contexts. Abuja is the capital of Nigeria, and perhaps it's not considered a major city in the same way as others. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the capitals of some countries are not part of the central business districts, hence considered outside. For example, in Germany, the central business district is Darmstadt, but the capital is Berlin, which is a major city outside the central business district.

So, if that's the case, Berlin would be outside the central business district, hence outside the central core. But in the options, E is London, which is the capital of the UK, and London is in the central core.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the central business district, not the capital.

In that case, the capitals of countries where the main business districts are not the central core would be considered outside.

But then, which capitals are considered outside? For example, in Germany, the capital is Berlin, which is a major city outside the central business district.

So, perhaps for some countries, the capital is outside the central business district, hence outside the central core.

Looking at the options, E is London, which is in the UK's central business district, so London is in the core.

So, perhaps the answer is not E.

Wait, perhaps Abuja is outside the central core. So, in that case, the answer would be I: Abuja.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe Abuja is a regional capital, not a major city.

Alternatively, perhaps the central core refers to the major industrial cities, and Abuja is a regional capital, hence outside.

Alternatively, perhaps the capitals of countries that have significant industrial areas outside the central core would be considered outside.

But I'm getting stuck here. So, perhaps the correct answer is I: Abuja, because it's a major city but not part of the central core, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, but all capitals are major cities. So, perhaps the question is incorrect, but I think the intended answer is I: Abuja.
</think>

The central core refers to major cities within a country, and capitals are typically within this area. All the options provided are capitals of countries, and thus within the central core. However, the question asks for a capital outside the central core. Upon reevaluation, Abuja, as the capital of Nigeria, is considered a regional capital and may not be part of the central core, making it the correct answer.

Answer: I
