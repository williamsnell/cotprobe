Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the chi-square test and a public health clinic study. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that in one month, out of 70 patients, 70 were found to have the same inherited disorder. Wait, 55 were males and 15 were females. Oh, wait, that adds up to 70. Because 55 +15 =70. So the total number is 70. But wait, wait—each patient has the disorder, so there are 70 patients, each with the condition. Half of them are male, 55, and the other half female, 15? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, 55 +15 is 70, that's correct. So 55 males, 15 females. So the ratio is 55:15, which simplifies to 11:3. So males are more than females.

The question is whether there's a statistically significant association between the disease and the male sex. The test to use is chi-square.

The options are A to J. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the setup is a contingency table. The variables are sex (male vs female) and having the disorder (yes or no). So the expected outcome is to see if the presence of the disorder is associated with sex.

We need to calculate the chi-square statistic to test the null hypothesis that sex and the disease are independent.

The formula for chi-square is Σ[(O-E)^2/E], where O is observed and E is expected. Alternatively, for 2x2 tables, another formula is (n*(ad - bc)^2)/( (a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d) )).

Wait, but since the numbers are small, maybe we can compute it.

So, the observed data:

- Males with disorder (O11): 55
- Males without (O12): 15 (since total males are 55)
- Females with (O21): 15 (since total females are 15, so 15 have the condition)
- Females without: 55-15=40.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Total patients: 70. 55 males, 15 females.

So, for the condition:

Males: 55 with the condition, 15 without.
Females: 15 with, 40 without.

Wait, wait, that totals 55+15=70 males (no, wait, no. The 55 and 15 are the total number of males and females, but the counts for each sex with and without the condition are what I just wrote.

So the contingency table would be:

          | Condition (C) | No Condition (N)
------------------------------------------
Male      | 55            | 15
Female    | 15            | 40

Now, the formula for chi-square is:

χ² = Σ [ (O - E)^2 / E ]

Where E is the expected count for each cell under the assumption of independence.

The formula for expected count for each cell is (row total * column total) / grand total.

So, let's compute each expected value.

First, the row totals (male and female) and column totals (condition and no condition).

Male row total:55+15=70.

Female row total:15+40=55.

Column totals: Condition total is 55+15=70. No condition:15+40=55.

Grand total:70.

So for the male condition cell (O11=55):

E11 = (70 *70)/70 =70.

Wait, no: E11 is (row1 total * column1 total) / grand total. Row1 is male:70, column1 is condition:70. So 70*70=4900. Divided by 70, which is 70. So E11=70.

Similarly, E12 (male without condition): (70 *55)/70=55.

E21 (female with condition): (55 *70)/70=55.

E22 (female without condition): (55 *55)/70. Let me compute that. 55 *55=3025. Divided by 70: 3025/70= approx 43.214.

Wait, let me make sure:

Let me compute each E:

E11: (70 *70)/70 =70.

Wait, no. Wait, the rows are for each sex, columns for condition and no. So row1 is male (70), row2 female (55), column1 condition (70), column2 no (55).

So for E11: (70 *70)/70 =70 (since 70 is row1, 70 is column1, 70 is grand total).

E12: (70 *55)/70 =55.

E21: (55 *70)/70 =55.

E22: (55 *55)/70 = (55^2)/70 = 3025/70 ≈43.214.

Now, let's compute each (O-E)^2 / E.

So for each cell:

1. O11=55, E11=70.

(55-70)^2 /70 = (-15)^2 /70 = 225 /70 ≈3.214.

2. O12=15, E12=55.

(15-55)^2 /55 = (-40)^2 /55= 1600 /55 ≈29.09.

3. O21=15, E21=55.

(15-55)^2 /55= 1600/55 ≈29.09.

4. O22=40, E22=43.214.

(40 -43.214)^2 /43.214 = (-3.214)^2 /43.214 ≈10.33 /43.214 ≈0.239.

Now sum all these up.

3.214 +29.09=32.304.

32.304 +29.09=61.394.

61.394 +0.239≈61.633.

So χ² ≈61.63.

Now, degrees of freedom (df) is (2-1)(2-1)=1.

So df=1.

Next, we need the critical value for a chosen significance level. But the question doesn't specify alpha. However, the options suggest whether the association is significant or not.

Wait, but in a chi-square test, the p-value is the probability of observing a result as extreme or more extreme than the test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

So with df=1, and a χ² of about 61.63, which is a very high value.

Looking up the critical values for chi-square with df=1:

Common significance levels (like p <0.05, p <0.01, etc.):

For p <0.05, the critical value is about 3.841.

For p <0.01, it's about 6.635.

Our χ² is 61.63, which is way higher than 6.635. So p <0.01 is definitely met. So the association is highly significant.

But wait, the options don't have an option for "the association is highly significant." Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: association is significant at some levels, not others.

B: female sex is highly significant.

C: not enough info.

D: no association.

E: female is significant.

F: condition is equally preveous between sexes, no significance.

G: association in both, stronger in males.

H: difference due to chance.

I: male association is significant, but not highly.

J: significant, but not highly?

Wait, wait, the options are given, so I need to see which one fits.

Wait, our chi-square is about 61.63, which is way above 6.635 (for p=0.01). So we can reject the null hypothesis at p <0.01. So the association is highly significant.

So the correct option is J: the association of the condition with the male sex is highly significant.

Wait, but let me read the options again. Option J says: "The association of the condition with the male sex is highly significant."

So that's the case.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The question is whether any association is significant, or which option describes the situation.

The options provide whether the association is significant at various levels. So if the computed chi-square is high, it's significant at even p <0.01.

So in terms of the answer options, the correct choice would be J.

The question involves determining if there is a statistically significant association between a inherited disorder and the sex of patients using the chi-square test. The study includes 70 patients, with 55 males and 15 females. The contingency table is as follows:

|          | Condition (C) | No Condition (N) |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| Male     | 55             | 15                 |
| Female   | 15             | 40                 |

### Step 1: Calculate Expected Values
The expected values (E) under the assumption of independence are calculated as:
- \( E_{11} = \frac{(70 \times 70)}{70} = 70 \)
- \( E_{12} = \frac{(70 \times 55)}{70} = 55 \)
- \( E_{21} = \frac{(55 \times 70)}{70} = 55 \)
- \( E_{22} = \frac{(55 \times 55)}{70} \approx 43.214 \)

### Step 2: Compute Chi-Square Statistic
The chi-square statistic is calculated using the formula:
\[ \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} \]

Calculations for each cell:
1. \( \frac{(55 - 70)^2}{70} \approx 3.214 \)
2. \( \frac{(15 - 55)^2}{55} \approx 29.09 \)
3. \( \frac{(15 - 55)^2}{55} \approx 29.09 \)
4. \( \frac{(40 - 43.214)^2}{43.214} \approx 0.239 \)

Summing these values:
\[ \chi^2 \approx 61.63 \]

### Step 3: Determine Degrees of Freedom
The degrees of freedom (df) for a 2x2 table is:
\[ df = (2 - 1)(2 - 1) = 1 \]

### Step 4: Interpret the Results
The calculated chi-square value of 61.63 is far above the critical value of 6.635 for \( \alpha = 0.01 \) (with df = 1). This indicates a highly significant association between the disorder and the sex of patients.

### Step 5: Match with Answer Options
The options are:
- **A**: Significant at some levels but not others.
- **B**: Significant for females.
- **C**: Insufficient data.
- **D**: No association.
- **E**: Significant for females.
- **F**: Condition equally prevalent.
- **G**: Association stronger in males.
- **H**: Difference due to chance.
- **I**: Significant for males, but not highly.
- **J**: Highly significant for males.

The chi-square statistic and p-value indicate a highly significant association, making **Option J** the correct choice.
