Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. The question is asking me to translate the statement "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy" into predicate logic. The options are A through J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what each part of the statement means. The phrase "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy" is an "or" statement, which in logic is typically represented by the symbol '∨'. So, I need to represent that either Taylor (let's say 't' or 'T') or Eric (let's say 'e' or 'E') is a latte boy.

Wait, but in predicate logic, variables are often used. So, I think Taylor would be a constant, maybe 't', and Eric would be 'e'. But the options aren't all using constants; some use variables. So I need to figure out how to express this in predicate logic.

The options are:

A: Lt ∨ Le
B: Lx ∨ Ly
C: Lt ∧ Le
D: L(t ∧ e)
E: tL ⊃ eL
F: tL ∨ eL
G: Lx ∧ Ly
H: L(t ∨ e)
I: E ∨ T
J: Tl ⊃ El

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Maybe some options use 'Lx' meaning x is a latte boy, where 'x' is a variable. So, for example, option B is 'Lx ∨ Ly', which would translate to either x is a latte or y is a latte.

In the problem, Taylor and Eric are specific individuals. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use individual constants. But looking at the options, all of them are using variables, which suggests that maybe the problem uses variables for the individuals.

So, for example, option F is 'tL ∨ eL', which would mean Taylor is a latte or Eric is a latte. Since "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte" is an "or" statement, this would fit.

Wait, but in logic, 'or' is inclusive, meaning that both can be true, but in this case, the statement is about "either" one of them being a latte. So, the translation should be 'Taylor is a latte OR Eric is a latte'.

Looking at the options, 'tL' would mean Taylor is a latte (assuming L is the predicate), and 'eL' would mean Eric is a latte. So 'tL ∨ eL' would correctly represent either Taylor or Eric being a latte.

So option F is 'tL ∨ eL'. Wait, but I think some of the options have 'Lx' or 'Le' which might just be a way to represent the predicate. So, 'tL' is Taylor is a latte, 'eL' is Eric is a latte.

Alternatively, maybe the variables are just for the people, and the predicate is L(x), meaning x is a latte. So in that case, 't' and 'e' are specific individuals, and the statement would be 'L(t) ∨ L(e)'.

But looking at the options, none of them use 'L(t)' or 'L(e)' as standalone. Instead, some options have 'Lt' or 'Le'. So, perhaps the correct notation is the option F: tL ∨ eL, because that would mean either Taylor is a latte or Eric is a latte.

Wait, but let's make sure. The original statement is "Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy." So, it's about the individuals Taylor and Eric. So in predicate logic, since we're talking about individuals, we need to represent that at least one of them is a latte. So 'tL' would mean Taylor is a latte, 'eL' Eric is a latte. So the logical OR would be 'tL ∨ eL', which is option F.

Another option is option H: L(t ∨ e). Wait, that would be a predicate applied to the disjunction. So L(t∨e) would mean that the disjunction t∨e is a latte. But that doesn't make sense because t∨e would be a truth value (either true or false), and applying L to it would mean that the whole thing is a latte, which isn't what the original statement says.

So, option H is 'L(t ∨ e)', which probably isn't correct because the statement is about Taylor or Eric being a latte, not about the disjunction being a latte.

So, the correct option is F: tL ∨ eL.

The correct translation is option F: tL ∨ eL, which accurately represents that either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy.

Answer: F
