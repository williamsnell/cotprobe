Okay, so I need to figure out which of these crops was NOT an important part of Hopewell's subsistence. The options are A to F, each a different crop. I remember Hopewell was an ancient American village in New York, right? They probably had their own way of growing food, maybe tied to traditional practices or natural resources.

Let me start by thinking about each option. Squash is a vegetable, I think they grow it. Knotweed is a plant, I believe they have some, maybe for teas? Beans, that's a legume, probably for cooking and as a food source. Sunflower is another plant, I've heard they have sunflowers for food too. Maize is a plant, I think they've had that for various uses. Potato is a vegetable, but do they have potatoes? I'm a bit fuzzy on that, maybe they don't have potatoes as much as they do others.

Wait, Hopewell is known for their use of wild plants. They used wildflowers, wild grasses, and certain herbs. So, did they have potatoes in their subsistence? I think they didn't. They didn't cultivate potatoes as much as they did other crops like squash, beans, sunflowers, and maize. So the crop that wasn't part of their subsistence would be potato, which is option F.

The correct answer is F: potato. Hopewell subsistence relied on wild plants, and potato was not cultivated.

Answer: F
