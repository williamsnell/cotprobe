Okay, I've got this problem here about Keiko birdwatching. Let's see, the question says she counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon. The total was 76 birds. I need to find out how many she counted in the afternoon. Hmm, let's break it down.

So, let's call the number of birds she saw in the afternoon 'x'. That makes sense because 'x' is easy to work with. Then the morning count would be 'x' plus 34, right? Because she saw 34 more than in the afternoon.

So, the total birds she saw that day is the sum of morning and afternoon counts. That would be x (afternoon) plus (x + 34) (morning). And that equals the total birds, which is 76.

Let me write that out as an equation: x + (x +34) =76. Now I can solve for x. Let's combine like terms. x plus x is 2x, and 34 remains. So 2x +34 =76.

Subtracting 34 from both sides: 2x =76-34. Let me calculate 76-34. That's 42. So 2x=42. Now, divide both sides by 2: x=21.

So Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon. Let me check the options. Option C is 21 birds, so that's the answer.
