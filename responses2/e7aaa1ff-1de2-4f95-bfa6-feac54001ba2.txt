Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about PKU and preventable mental retardation. Let me start by recalling what I know about PKU, which I think stands for primary progressive Klebsiella pneumoniae, a type of gastrointestinal disorder.

I remember that PKU is caused by mutations in the β-lactamase gene. Beta-lactamases are enzymes that break down antibiotics. So if someone has PKU, their body can't break down certain antibiotics, like penicillin or others, which are often used to treat infections.

The question is about preventing mental retardation linked to PKU. I think PKU can lead to various developmental issues because the body's resistance mechanisms might interfere with normal functions. But how is this prevented? The options are hormone replacement therapy, surgical intervention, psychotherapy, vitamin supplements, blood transfusions, removing environmental toxins, gene therapy, antibiotics, regular exercise.

I remember hearing that PKU is often treated with gene therapy. Gene therapy would involve knocking out the beta-lactamase gene, which would prevent the enzyme from breaking down antibiotics. That makes sense because if the enzyme can't work, the bacteria can't produce the antibiotics needed to treat an infection or cause problems that lead to mental retardation.

Option A is hormone replacement therapy, which I think targets hormones like testosterone or estrogen. These are more commonly used in certain medical conditions, like high blood pressure or hormonal replacement for muscle issues. Not sure how applicable that is to PKU.

Option B is surgical intervention. I'm not sure how surgery would prevent PKU-related mental retardation. Surgical interventions are more about physical health, maybe things like heart surgery or brain surgery, which I don't think are directly related to PKU.

Option C is psychotherapy. That's more about mental health and emotional well-being. While it's important, I don't think it directly prevents PKU-related issues like mental retardation.

Option D is vitamin supplements. VITAMINS A, B12, and others are important for various bodily functions. I don't recall PKU being caused by vitamin deficiencies, especially since PKU is linked to enzyme mutations.

Option E is blood transfusions. Blood transfusions are a way to prevent blood clots, which can help prevent infections. But I'm not sure how that directly prevents PKU-related issues in the body, like enzyme function.

Option F is removal of environmental toxins. If you remove toxins, that might prevent PKU, but the question is about prevention. The question is about how to prevent mental retardation associated with PKU itself. So it's more about the body's ability to handle PKU symptoms, not about removing toxins.

Option G is gene therapy. As I thought earlier, this would involve knocking out the beta-lactamase gene. That would prevent the enzyme from working, which would suppress the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae, leading to impaired bacterial resistance. This could prevent PKU-related issues, including mental retardation.

Option H is antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat infections, but the question is about preventing PKU's associated mental retardation, not about treating the condition itself.

Option I is regular exercise. Exercise might help with overall health, but I'm not sure if it directly prevents PKU-related mental retardation. It's more about physical health and general well-being.

So the options that directly address preventing PKU-related issues are A (hormone therapy), G (gene therapy), and others. But the question is specifically about preventing the mental retardation caused by PKU. So I think the best answer is G: gene therapy.

The primary cause of PKU is mutations in the β-lactamase gene, which impairs the production of antibiotics. Preventing PKU-related mental retardation would involve disrupting this enzyme. Among the options, gene therapy (G) directly targets the β-lactamase gene, preventing its function, which would suppress bacterial growth and impair PKU symptoms. 

Answer: G
