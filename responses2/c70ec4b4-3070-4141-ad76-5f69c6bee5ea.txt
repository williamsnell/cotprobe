Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the frequency of radiation emitted during a pure rotational transition in HCl. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says the transition is J=1 to J=0. I remember that when a molecule absorbs or emits radiation, it changes its rotational quantum number. For pure rotational transitions, the energy difference between adjacent rotational states is what determines the frequency. Oh wait, right, the formula involves the moment of inertia and the quantum number.

The formula I think I need is the rotational energy levels. The energy E for a rotational state J is something like E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So the energy difference between J=1 and J=0 would be E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I)) * (1*2) - (ħ²/(2I)) * (0*1) )= (2ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I). 

Wait, more accurately, let me write it again. The energy for J=1 is (1)(2) * [ħ²/(2I)] = ħ² I/(I) = ... Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step. E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) * J*(J+1). So E_1 = (ħ²/(2I)) * (1)(2) = (2ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). Because 2/(2I) is 1/I. Similarly, E_0 is (1)(0)*[...] which is zero. So the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I) * (1/ (2I) ) * (1)(2) ). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate: 

E_1 = (ħ²/(2I)) * (1)(2) = (2 ħ²) / (2I) )= ħ² / I. E_0 is zero. So ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = ħ² / I.

Wait, wait, no, let me do the calculation again. E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1) so for J=1: (1)(2) = 2, so E_1 = (2 ħ²) / (2I) )= ħ² / I. For J=0: E_0 = 0. So the energy difference is (ħ²/I) - 0 = ħ² / I. Oh right, so ΔE = ħ² / I. 

Now, the energy of a photon is E_photon = h f, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. So we can equate ΔE = h f. So f = ΔE / h. 

So f = (ħ² / I) / h. Because ħ is h/(2π). So substituting ħ = h/(2π), f becomes ( (h/(2π))² ) / I ) / h.

Let me compute that. (h²/(4π²)) / I ) divided by h is (h/(4π² I)).

Wait, let me make it step by step. Let me write f as ( (ħ^2)/(I) ) / h.

We can substitute ħ = h/(2π), so:

f = ( ( (h/(2π) )^2 ) / I ) / h )

= ( h²/(4 π²) ) / ( I h )

= (h)/(4 π² I )

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the units. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it in terms of I being the moment of inertia.

But wait, the moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule like HCl is given by I = μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. 

So I need to find μ. The mass of each atom. H has a molar mass of about 1 g/mol, Cl about 35.5 g/mol. But since it's a diatomic, each has a molar mass, but in terms of atomic masses, H is about 1.00784 u and Cl is about 34.96885 u. The reduced mass μ is given by (m1 m2)/(m1 + m2), where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two atoms. 

The distance between H and Cl is given as 1.3A°. I think A is the abbreviation for angstrom, which is 1e-10 meters. So 1.3A is 1.3e-10 m.

So compute μ:

μ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)

m1 = 1.00784 u, m2 = 34.96885 u.

But u is the atomic mass unit. 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Wait, but sometimes in spectroscopy, we use atomic units for calculations, but perhaps it's easier to convert everything into kilograms and compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of cm⁻¹ because the wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) would be easier, but let's stick with SI because the final answer is in Hz, which is 1/s.

Wait, but let's proceed. Let me compute the reduced mass in kg.

m1 = 1.00784 u = 1.00784 * 1.6605390666e-27 kg ≈ 1.6743e-27 kg.

m2 = 34.96885 u = 34.96885 * 1.6605390666e-27 kg ≈ 5.876e-26 kg.

So m1 + m2 ≈ 1.6743e-27 + 5.876e-26 = 6.0434e-26 kg.

m1 * m2 = 1.6743e-27 * 5.876e-26 ≈ 9.823e-53 kg².

So μ = (1.6743e-27 * 5.876e-26) / (6.0434e-26) )

Wait, that's (9.823e-53) / (6.0434e-26) ) = 1.625e-26 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

m1 = 1.00784 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 1.6743e-27 kg.

m2 = 34.96885 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 5.876e-26 kg.

So m1 * m2 = 1.6743e-27 * 5.876e-26 = let's compute the exponents: 1e-27 * 1e-26 = 1e-53.

1.6743 *5.876 ≈ approximately 1.674 *5.876. 

Let me compute: 1.674 * 5 = 8.37, 1.674 * 0.876 is about 1.674 * 0.8 = 1.3392, 0.076 *1.674 ≈ 0.128, so total approx 1.3392 + 0.128 ≈ 1.467. So total is 8.37 + 1.467 ≈ 9.837, so about 9.837e-53 kg².

m1 + m2 = 1.6743e-27 +5.876e-26 = 5.876e-26 + 0.16743e-26 = 6.0434e-26 kg.

So μ = (9.837e-53) / (6.0434e-26) ) = (9.837 /6.0434) * 1e-27.

9.837 /6.0434 ≈ about 1.626. So μ ≈ 1.626e-27 kg? Wait, but wait, 9.837e-53 /6.0434e-26= (9.837/6.0434) *1e-53+26= (1.626) *1e-27= 1.626e-27 kg.

So I = μ r².

r is 1.3 A = 1.3e-10 m. So r² = (1.3e-10)^2 = 1.69e-20 m².

So I = μ r² = 1.626e-27 kg * 1.69e-20 m² = 2.75e-47 kg m².

So now, we have I = 2.75e-47 kg m².

Now, the frequency f is (ħ²)/(I h).

Wait, let me write all the steps again.

We have f = ( (h²/(4π²)) )/( I h ) )= (h / (4 π² I )).

Wait, no, because earlier f was (ħ²/(I)) / h. Since ħ = h/(2π), ħ² = h²/(4π²). So f = (h²/(4π²)) / (I h) ) = (h) / (4 π² I).

Wait, no, let's re-calculate:

f = (ħ^2) / ( I h )

But ħ = h/(2π), so:

f = ( (h/(2π) )^2 ) / ( I h )

= ( h²/(4 π²) ) / ( I h )

= (h ) / (4 π² I )

So f = h / (4 π² I )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it again. Because (h/(2π))^2 is h²/(4 π²), so:

f = (h²/(4 π²)) ) / ( I h ) ) = (h) / (4 π² I )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recompute:

Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J s.

So f = (h^2/(4 pi² I )) ) / h ?

Wait, no. Wait, I think I messed up the substitution earlier. Let me re-derive:

We have ΔE = (ħ²)/(I) ), and ΔE = h f.

So f = ΔE / h = (ħ²/(I)) / h.

Since ħ = h/(2 pi), substituting:

f = ( (h/(2 pi) )^2 )/( I h ) )

= ( h^2 / (4 pi²) ) / ( I h )

= h / (4 pi² I )

Yes, correct.

So now, f = h / (4 pi² I )

But wait, I is 2.75e-47 kg·m².

So plug in the numbers.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So f = (6.626e-34) / (4 * pi² * 2.75e-47 )

Compute denominator: 4 * pi² * 2.75e-47.

pi² is about 9.8696.

So 4 * pi² ≈ 39.4784.

Multiply by 2.75e-47: 39.4784 * 2.75e-47 ≈ (approx 39.48 * 2.75 )e-47.

39.48 * 2.75: Let's compute 40 * 2.75 is 110, but 39.48 is 40-0.52.

So 40 *2.75=110, 0.52 *2.75≈1.43, so 110-1.43=108.57. So 108.57e-47.

So denominator is ~1.0857e-45.

So f = 6.626e-34 / 1.0857e-45 = (6.626 /1.0857) * 1e11.

Wait, because 1e-34 / 1e-45 is 1e11.

So 6.626 / 1.0857 ≈ around 6.117.

So f ≈ 6.117e11 Hz.

Hmm, wait, but wait. Let's compute 6.626 / 1.0857 accurately.

1.0857 × 6 = 6.5142 → 6.5142, which is less than 6.626 by 0.1118.

1.0857 × 0.1 =0.10857 → 6.5142 + 0.10857 =6.62277, which is close to 6.626. The difference is about 0.00323. So 0.00323 /1.0857 ≈ approx 0.003.

So 6.117 → approximately 6.117e11 Hz.

But wait, the choices are in the 1e12 Hz range. Wait, 6e11 would be 0.6e12. So looking at the options, option C is 0.615e12, which is about 6.15e11 Hz. So that's close to our calculation.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of 4 pi². Let me recompute.

4 pi squared is 4 * (pi^2) ≈ 4*9.8696 ≈ 39.4784.

Multiply that by 2.75e-47: 39.4784 *2.75e-47.

Wait, 39.4784 *2.75 is:

39 * 2.75=107.25,

0.4784 *2.75=1.3118.

So total 107.25 + 1.3118= 108.5618.

So 108.5618e-47 → 1.085618e-45.

So denominator is 4 pi² I = 1.0856e-45.

So the denominator is 1.0856e-45.

So f = 6.626e-34 / (1.0856e-45) = (6.626 /1.0856) ) * 1e(11) → because 1e-34 /1e-45 is 1e11.

6.626 /1.0856 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

1.0856 *6 = 6.5136.

6.5136 → 6.5136 is less than 6.626 by 0.1124.

So 6.5136 + (0.1124) =6.626 → how much is 0.1124 /1.0856 → apprx 0.1035.

So 6 → 6×1.0856=6.5136.

6.5136 + 0.1035=6.6171.

Hmm, about 6.6171. So f is approximately 6.6171e11 Hz.

Which is 6.617e11 Hz, which is 0.6617e12 Hz.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.615e12 Hz, option A is 0.715e12, etc.

Wait, 0.6617e12 is closest to 0.615e12? No, because 0.615 is less than 0.66. So the closest is option C and A. Wait, 0.66 is closer to 0.615? No, 0.66 is larger than 0.615. So 0.66 is 0.045 away from 0.615 and 0.055 away from 0.715. Wait, no, 0.66 -0.615=0.045, 0.715-0.66=0.055. So 0.66 is closer to 0.615 (difference 0.045) than to 0.715 (0.055). So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of f to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The steps are:

1. Calculate I (moment of inertia) for HCl. I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2).

m1 is H: 1.00784 u, m2 is Cl: 34.96885 u.

μ = (1.00784 * 34.96885) / (1.00784 +34.96885 ) = ?

Calculating numerator: 1.00784 *34.96885.

Let me compute 1.00784 *34.96885.

34.96885 ×1 =34.96885.

34.96885 ×0.00784 = approximately 0.2728.

So total is about 35.24165 u².

Denominator: 1.00784 +34.96885 =35.97669 u.

So μ = 35.24165 /35.97669 = approx 0.9784 u.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately:

35.24165 ÷35.97669.

Let me do this division.

35.24165 /35.97669.

Let me compute 35.97669 × 0.978 → 35.97669 ×0.9=32.37902, 35.97669 ×0.07=2.5183683, 35.97669 ×0.008=0.28781352 → sum is 32.37902 +2.5183683=34.8973883 +0.28781352=35.18519.

But wait, 35.18519 is less than 35.24165.

35.24165 -35.18519=0.05646.

Now, 35.97669 × x =0.05646.

x=0.05646 /35.97669≈0.001573.

So total μ ≈0.978 +0.001573=0.979573 u.

So μ≈0.97957 u.

Now, r is 1.3A =1.3e-10 m.

So r² = (1.3e-10)^2 =1.69e-20 m².

μ =0.97957 u.

But u is 1.6605390666e-27 kg.

So μ =0.97957 *1.6605390666e-27 kg.

μ≈1.629e-27 kg.

Then I = μ r² =1.629e-27 *1.69e-20 = (1.629 *1.69) e-47.

1.629 *1.69 ≈ approx 2.75.

So I≈2.75e-47 kg m².

Now, compute f = (h²)/(I h) )= h/(4 pi^2 I )

h=6.626e-34 J s.

So f = (6.626e-34 )/(4 * pi^2 *2.75e-47 )

Compute denominator: 4 * pi^2 = 4 *9.8696≈39.478. So 39.478 * 2.75e-47 ≈39.478 *2.75 =108.57, so 108.57e-47 =1.0857e-45.

So f= 6.626e-34 / 1.0857e-45 = (6.626/1.0857) *1e11.

6.626/1.0857≈6.117.

So f ≈6.117e11 Hz =6.117e1 Hz =6.117e1e12 = 6.117e12 Hz.

Wait, no, wait, 6.117e11 Hz is 6.117e-1 Hz in terms of 1e12. No, that's not right.

Wait, no, 6.117e11 Hz is equal to 6.117e1 Hz since 1e11 is 1e1 *1e10. Wait, no.

Wait, 6.117e11 Hz =6.117e1 *1e10 →6.117e1 is 61.17, but that's not correct.

Wait, no, 1e11 Hz is 10^11 Hz, which is 10^1 Hz multiplied by 10^10 Hz.

Wait, no, 1e11 is 10^11, and 1e1 is 10^1.

Wait, but 6.117e11 is 6.117 *1e11, which is 6.117 *10^11.

But 1e12 is 10^12.

So 6.117e11 Hz is 0.6117e12 Hz.

So 0.6117e12 Hz is 6.117e11 Hz.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.615e12, which is 6.15e11 Hz, which is about 0.615 times 1e12.

So our calculation gives about 6.117e11 Hz, which is 0.6117e12 Hz.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.615e12, which is close to 0.6117e12, considering rounding errors.

So the correct answer should be option C: 0.615e12 Hz.

To determine the frequency of the emitted photon when the pure rotational transition occurs in HCl, we use the relationship:

\[
f = \frac{\hbar^2}{I h}
\]

where:
- \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\),
- \(I = \mu r^2\) is the moment of inertia,
- \(r\) is the bond length, and
- \(\mu\) is the reduced mass of the diatomic molecule.

### Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass \(\mu\)
The reduced mass \(\mu\) is given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

where \(m_1 = 1.00784 \, \text{u}\) (mass of hydrogen) and \(m_2 = 34.96885 \, \text{u}\) (mass of chlorine). Substituting these values:

\[
\mu = \frac{(1.00784)(34.96885)}{1.00784 + 34.96885} = \frac{35.24165}{35.97669} \approx 0.97957 \, \text{u}
\]

Converting to kilograms using \(1 \, \text{u} = 1.6605390666 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\):

\[
\mu = 0.97957 \times 1.6605390666 \times 10^{-27} \approx 1.629 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\)
The moment of inertia is given by:

\[
I = \mu r^2
\]

where \(r = 1.3 \, \text{A} = 1.3 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Substituting \(\mu\) and \(r\):

\[
I = 1.629 \times 10^{-27} \times (1.3 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.629 \times 10^{-27} \times 1.69 \times 10^{-20} = 2.75 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the frequency \(f\)
Using the formula \(f = \frac{\hbar^2}{I h}\), substitute \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\), \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}\), and \(I = 2.75 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2\):

\[
f = \frac{\left(\frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi}\right)^2}{2.75 \times 10^{-47} \times 6.626 \times 10^{-34}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
2\pi \approx 6.283, \quad (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67}
\]

\[
\frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{4.084 \times 10^{-35}} \approx 1.076 \times 10^{-32}
\]

Now, divide by \(I h\):

\[
f = \frac{1.076 \times 10^{-32}}{1.76 \times 10^{-71}} \approx 6.117 \times 10^{39} \, \text{Hz}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the given options
The calculated frequency is approximately \(6.117 \times 10^{11} \, \text{Hz}\), which corresponds to \(0.6117 \times 10^{12} \, \text{Hz}\). Comparing with the options:

- **Option C: 0.615 × 10¹² Hz**

This is the closest match, considering rounding errors.

ANSWER: C
