Okay, so I've got this question about Hamming distances between some codewords. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The codewords given are 000000, 010101, 101010, and 110110. Hamming distance, right, is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. So, for each pair of codewords, I'll calculate their Hamming distance and then find the minimum among them.

Wait, wait, the question says "pairwise distances" and "determine the minimum Hamming distance." Oh, so I have to calculate all possible pairwise distances and see which is the smallest.

But wait, wait. There are four codewords, so how many pairwise distances are there? Let's see, for four elements, the number of unique pairs is 4 choose 2, which is 6. So I'll list all possible pairs.

Let's list all possible pairs:

1. 000000 and 010101
2. 000000 and 101010
3. 000000 and 110110
4. 010101 and 101010
5. 010101 and 110110
6. 101010 and 110110

Now, let's compute each of these.

First pair: 000000 vs 010101. Let's compare each bit:

0 vs 0 → same
0 vs 1 → different
0 vs 0 → same
0 vs 1 → different
0 vs 0 → same
So the differing bits are positions 2 and 4. That's two differences. So Hamming distance here is 2.

Second pair: 000000 vs 101010. Comparing each bit:

0 vs 1 → different
0 vs 0 → same
0 vs 1 → different
0 vs 0 → same
0 vs 1 → different
So differing bits are positions 1, 3, 5 → three differences. Hamming distance 3.

Third pair: 000000 vs 110110. Comparing:

0 vs 1 → diff
0 vs 1 → diff
0 vs 0 → same
0 vs 1 → diff
0 vs 0 → same
So positions 1,2,4 are different. That's three differences. Distance 3.

Fourth pair: 010101 vs 101010. Comparing:

0 vs 1 → diff
1 vs 0 → diff
0 vs 1 → diff
1 vs 0 → diff
0 vs 1 → diff
1 vs 0 → diff
Wait wait, let me check that again. Let me write them down:

0 (010101) vs 1 (101010)
1 (010101) vs 0 (101010)
0 vs 1 → diff
1 vs 0 → diff
0 vs 1 → diff
Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 010101 is the first, 101010 is the second. Let me line them up:

0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0
So each position:

pos1: 0 vs 1 → diff
pos2:1 vs 0 → diff
pos3:0 vs1 → diff
pos4:1 vs0 → diff
pos5:0 vs1 → diff
pos6:1 vs0 → diff
Wait, that's all six positions differing. So Hamming distance is 6? Or am I making a mistake?

Wait, wait, maybe I should check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me check again.

Wait, 010101 vs 101010:

Each position:

pos1: 0 vs 1 → different
pos2:1 vs0 → different
pos3:0 vs1 → different
pos4:1 vs0 → different
pos5:0 vs1 → different
pos6:1 vs0 → different

Yes, all 6 are different. So the distance is 6.

Fifth pair: 010101 vs 110110. Let's compare each bit:

0 vs 1 → diff
1 vs1 → same
0 vs0 → same
1 vs1 → same
0 vs1 → diff
1 vs0 → diff
Wait, let me line them up.

010101 vs 110110:

0 vs1 → diff
1 vs1 → same
0 vs0 → same
1 vs1 → same
0 vs1 → diff
1 vs0 → diff
Yes, that's three differences. So distance is 3.

Sixth pair: 101010 vs 110110. Comparing each bit:

1 vs1 → same
0 vs1 → diff
1 vs0 → diff
0 vs1 → diff
1 vs1 → same
0 vs0 → same
Wait, let's write each position:

pos1:1 vs1 → same
pos2:0 vs1 → diff
pos3:1 vs0 → diff
pos4:0 vs1 → diff
pos5:1 vs1 → same
pos6:0 vs0 → same

So differing bits are 2,3,4. That's three differences. Distance is 3.

So now, all the pairwise distances are:

1. 000000 - 010101: 2
2. 000000 - 101010: 3
3. 000000 - 110110:3
4. 010101 - 101010:6
5. 010101 - 110110:3
6. 101010 - 110110:3

Now, the minimum among these is 2. So the answer should be option A:1? Wait, no. Wait, the options are:

A:1

B:8

C:9

D:2

E:5

F:4

G:6

H:3

I:7

J:0

So the minimum is 2, which is option D.

The task is to calculate the Hamming distances between the codewords 000000, 010101, 101010, and 110110, then determine the minimum Hamming distance.

### Step 1: Calculate pairwise Hamming distances
- **000000 vs 010101**: Differ at positions 2 and 4 → distance = 2
- **000000 vs 101010**: Differ at positions 1, 3, 5 → distance = 3
- **000000 vs 110110**: Differ at positions 1, 2, 4 → distance = 3
- **010101 vs 101010**: All positions differ → distance = 6
- **010101 vs 110110**: Differ at positions 2, 3, 4 → distance = 3
- **101010 vs 110110**: Differ at positions 2, 3, 4 → distance = 3

### Step 2: Identify the minimum distance
The distances are: 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3. The smallest is **2**.

### Step 3: Match with the options
The minimum distance is **2**, which corresponds to option **D**.
