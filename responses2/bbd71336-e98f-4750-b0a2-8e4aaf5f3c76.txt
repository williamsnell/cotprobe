Okay, so I have this question about Kant and his concepts. The question is asking about what something can't be called "good" without qualification except a certain thing. Hmm, I remember that Kant talked a lot about duties and good versus right.

Kant's concept of "dutio prima" is the primary good, which is the duty or moral obligation. I think this is the idea that something is good if you have a moral duty to do it. So, the default state of being good is tied to action. 

Looking at the options, let's see. The question is about 'nothing can be called “good” without qualification except _____'. So, the blank is what must be the primary good. The options are A to J.

Option A is a good will. I'm not sure if Kant would say that a good will on its own is good. Maybe it's more about intentions than actions.

Option B is self-interest. That's about wanting what's best for oneself, not others. That's subjective, so maybe not Kant's primary good.

Option C is justice. I remember that Kant thought about the moral duty to act justly, which is about being right in doing what's necessary. So justice might be the answer here.

Option D is right action. That's a bit different because it's about what's right to do, not the good itself.

Wait, Kant's duty is the primary good. So the option that represents that would be C: justice. Because the moral duty is the basis for what is good. So if you have a duty, that's the reason it's good without qualification.

Alternatively, I should think about what Kant's duties are. He thought that duties are the primary good. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: justice, because Kant's duty is the moral obligation that defines the primary good, without which something cannot be considered good.
