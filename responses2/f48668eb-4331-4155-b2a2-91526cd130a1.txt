Okay, so I have this problem about finding the mass of air in a closed chamber. Hmm, let's see. The chamber has dimensions 35 ft by 20 ft by 10 ft. The pressure is 17 lb/in², and the temperature is 75°F. I need to find the mass, assuming air is an ideal gas. The options are A to J, each with a different number of pounds mass.

Wait, I remember that for ideal gases, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles. Oh, but I need to find mass, not moles. So maybe I should use the specific gas constant. Right, the specific gas constant R depends on the gas. For air, I think it's around 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) or something like that. Or wait, maybe I should double-check the units.

Wait, another approach: using the ideal gas law in terms of mass. The ideal gas law can be written as PV = mRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, m is mass, R is specific gas constant, and T is temperature in absolute units (like Rankine for air). So, m = PV/(RT).

But wait, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's list all the given units.

Volume: 35 ft × 20 ft × 10 ft. Let me calculate that. 35 * 20 is 700, times 10 is 7000 cubic feet. So V = 7000 ft³.

Pressure: 17 lb/in². Hmm, I think I remember that 144 square inches in a square foot, so 144 psi to a square foot. Wait, 144 in² = 1 ft². So 17 psi is equal to 17 lb/in². But I need to convert that to lb/ft² because pressure in ft terms would be easier.

Wait, 1 psi is 1 lb per square inch. So 17 psi is 17 lb per square inch. To get lb per square foot, since 144 square inches make a square foot, multiply by 144. So 17 * 144 = 2448 lb/ft².

Wait, no, wait. 1 in² is (1/144) ft². So, 1 lb/in² is (1 lb) / (1/144 ft² ) = 144 lb/ft². So, 17 lb/in² is 17 * 144 = 2448 lb/ft². Okay, that's pressure in lb per square foot.

Temperature: 75°F. I need to convert that to Rankine. Because the specific gas constant R for air in ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) is used when T is in Rankine. So, Rankine is Fahrenheit plus 459.67. So 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 °R.

Now, the specific gas constant R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). I think that's correct.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. The universal gas constant R is 1545 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R), and the molecular weight of air is about 28.97 lbm/lbmol. So R for air is R_univ / M = 1545 / 28.97 ≈ 53.35. Yeah, that's correct.

So now, applying the formula m = PV/(RT). Let's plug in the numbers.

P = 2448 lb/ft²
V = 7000 ft³
R = 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R)
T = 534.67 °R

So m = (2448 lb/ft²) * (7000 ft³) / (53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) * 534.67 °R)

Wait, calculating denominator: 53.35 * 534.67. Let's compute that.

53 * 534 ≈ let's compute 53 * 500 = 26,500; 53*34=1802; total 28,302. But since it's 53.35 * 534.67, let's approximate.

Wait, 53.35 * 534.67. Let me calculate 53.35 * 534.67.

53.35 * 500 = 26,675

53.35 * 34.67 ≈ let's compute:

First, 53.35 * 30 = 1,600.5

53.35 * 4.67 ≈ 53.35 *4 = 213.4, 53.35 * 0.67 ≈ ~35.63. So 213.4 +35.63=249.03.

So 1,600.5 +249.03=1,849.53.

So total denominator is 26,675 + 1,849.53 = 28,524.53.

So denominator is 28,524.53.

Now numerator: 2448 *7000= ?

2448 *7000: 2448 * 7 * 1000. 2448 *7=17,136. So 17,136 *1000=17,136,000.

So m = 17,136,000 / 28,524.53 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that.

Divide 17,136,000 by 28,524.53.

Let me approximate 28,524.53 ≈ 28,500 for easier calculation.

28,500 * 600 = 17,100,000. So 600 is approx the mass.

Wait, 28,524.53 * 600 = ?

28,524.53 *600 = 28,524.53 * 6 *100 = 171,147.18 *100=17,114,718.

But our numerator is 17,136,000. So 17,136,000 -17,114,718 = 21,282.

So how much more than 600?

21,282 / 28,524.53 ≈ 0.748.

So approximately 600.748 lbm.

Wait, wait, but that's approx 600.75, but let me compute more accurately.

But I think perhaps the exact calculation would be better.

Wait, let's compute 17,136,000 / 28,524.53.

Let me write it as 17,136,000 ÷ 28,524.53.

Well, 28,524.53 × 600 = 17,114,718.

So 17,136,000 – 17,114,718 = 21,282.

21,282 is the remainder.

Now, 21,282 ÷ 28,524.53 ≈ 0.748.

So total is approximately 600.75 lbm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 601 lbm, option D is 500, etc. So the closest is 601 lbm. But wait, wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure conversion. Let me go back.

Pressure was 17 lb/in². So since 1 in² is (1/144) ft², but when calculating pressure in lb per square foot, it's 17 * 144 = 2448 lb/ft². That's correct.

Volume is 35 x 20 x10 ft³ = 7000 ft³. Correct.

R is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). Correct.

Temperature is 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 °R. Correct.

So m = (2448 lb/ft²) * (7000 ft³) / (53.35 * 534.67) = (2448 *7000)/(53.35 *534.67).

Wait, but wait, let me compute 53.35 *534.67.

Let me compute 53.35 * 534.67 accurately.

53.35 * 500 = 26,675

53.35 * 34.67 = ?

Compute 34.67 *53.35.

Let me break it down:

34 *53.35 = (30 *53.35) + (4 *53.35) = 1600.5 + 213.4 = 1813.9

0.67 *53.35 = 35.7145

So 34.67 *53.35=1813.9 +35.7145= 1849.6145.

So 53.35 *534.67= 26,675 + 1,849.6145= 28,524.6145.

So denominator is 28,524.6145.

Numerator is 2448 *7000 = 17,136,000.

So m = 17,136,000 / 28,524.6145 ≈ ?

Let me compute 17,136,000 ÷ 28,524.6145.

Approaching this:

28,524.6145 * 600 = 17,114,768.7.

Subtract that from 17,136,000: 17,136,000 -17,114,768.7 = 21,231.3.

Now, 21,231.3 / 28,524.6145 ≈ 0.745.

So total is about 600.745 lbm.

So the mass is approximately 600.75 lbm. Looking at the options:

A:550

B:650

C:601

D:500

E:800

F:750

G:450

H:900

I:700

J:850

So option C is 601, which is the closest. So the answer should be C:601 lbm.

To determine the mass of air in a closed chamber, we use the ideal gas law in the form:

\[
m = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Volume (V):** \( 35 \, \text{ft} \times 20 \, \text{ft} \times 10 \, \text{ft} = 7000 \, \text{ft}^3 \)
- **Pressure (P):** \( 17 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \)
- **Temperature (T):** \( 75^\circ \text{F} \)
- **Gas constant for air (R):** \( 53.35 \, \text{ft·lbf/(lbm·°R)} \)

### Unit Conversions:
1. **Convert pressure to lb/ft²:**
   Since \( 1 \, \text{lb/in}^2 = 144 \, \text{lb/ft}^2 \),
   \[
   P = 17 \times 144 = 2448 \, \text{lb/ft}^2
   \]

2. **Convert temperature to Rankine:**
   \[
   T = 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 \, \text{°R}
   \]

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
m = \frac{P \cdot V}{R \cdot T} = \frac{2448 \cdot 7000}{53.35 \cdot 534.67}
\]

1. **Calculate the denominator:**
   \[
   53.35 \cdot 534.67 \approx 28,524.6145
   \]

2. **Calculate the numerator:**
   \[
   2448 \cdot 7000 = 17,136,000
   \]

3. **Compute the mass:**
   \[
   m = \frac{17,136,000}{28,524.6145} \approx 600.75 \, \text{lbm}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated mass of air is approximately \( 600.75 \, \text{lbm} \), which rounds to \( 601 \, \text{lbm} \). Among the options, the closest value is **601 lbm**.
