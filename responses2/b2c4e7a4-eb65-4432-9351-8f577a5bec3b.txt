Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?

Options:

A: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.
B: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.
C: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.
D: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about property law and constitutional law. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about a city enacting an ordinance to improve the quality of rental housing. They required each new and existing unit to have at least one full bathroom per bedroom, specific plumbing and electrical stuff, and a covered parking space. A majority of existing owners opposed this because they thought it would lower the number of low-income rental units. They argued that owners can't raise rents enough to cover the costs, but the city went ahead. Now, a plaintiff suing the city says the ordinance is unconstitutional based on the face of it, not the content. 

The question is about the burden of persuasion for the plaintiff's suit. So, I'm supposed to choose the best option from A to J, but the options given are A to D. The options are about what burden the plaintiff must show to prove the ordinance is unconstitutional.

First, I need to recall the types of constitutional law challenges. There are two main approaches: 

1. **Direct Constraint Clause Argument**: The argument here is that the ordinance imposes an unconstitutional burden on the state, making the right of property owners to use their property less free and clear. This is a type of constitutional constraint under the Second Amendment, but more specifically, it's the First Amendment's right of property.

2. **State vs. Private Choice Argument**: The defender of the ordinance might argue that the state's regulation is legitimate because it affects the private choice of residents. The state regulates economic activity within state regulatory authority, so that's a Second Amendment concern.

Now, the question is about the burden of persuasion. For the Second Amendment, the burden is typically on the state. The state must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest. That means the state needs to show that the ordinance is something that the state wants to achieve, and that it's not arbitrary or unreasonable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient."

Wait, so this is saying that the state needs to show the ordinance is necessary for a state interest, and that it's adverse to the right. But in the case, the state is acting to improve housing, so the burden is on the state. So this seems like it's correct, but I'm not sure. The issue is about whether the state's burden is on the city, which is the defendant.

Option B: "The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons."

Hmm, this is about the impact on low-income individuals. But I think the burden of persuasion is on the state to show that it's necessary for a state interest and that it's adverse to the private right. The defendant's burden is to show that the ordinary person's rights are not impacted. So B seems to be addressing the private rights, which is a different burden. So this might not be the state's burden.

Option C: "The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents."

This is about the burden on the plaintiff to show that the state's interest isn't important. Wait, no, the state's burden is to show that it's necessary and adverse to the private right, not the plaintiff. So C seems to be about the plaintiff's burden, which is not correct.

Option D: "The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority."

Again, this is about the plaintiff's burden. They argue that the state's interest isn't there to regulate the economic activities of a type within state regulation. But the state's burden is on the city to show the necessary state interest, not on the plaintiff. So D's focus is on the plaintiff's burden, which is incorrect.

So now, I'm looking at the options A and B, but wait, the options are given as:

A) State burden on city, because adverse to fundamental right.

B) State burden on city, because of negative impact on low-income.

Wait, the options are:

A: State's burden, because it's adverse to a right.

B: State's burden, because it has a negative impact on low-income.

Wait, the question is about the burden of persuasion, which is the state's burden, not the plaintiff's. So the correct answer would be one that states the state's burden.

Looking back, the options are:

A: State burden, because adverse to fundamental right.

B: State burden, because of negative impact on low-income.

C: Plaintiff's burden, because not related to state interest.

D: Plaintiff's burden, because state interest not legitimate.

So, the correct answer should be one that states the state's burden. So the options are A and B.

But the question is about which option states the burden correctly.

The question is about what burden the plaintiff must show, but no, the options are about what burden the state must show because the state is the one needing to demonstrate the state interest.

Wait no, the options are about the burden of persuasion. So each part of the options (A to D) is about what the state must prove in order to hold the ordinance unconstitutional.

So, in the case, the plaintiff is trying to show that the ordinance isn't necessary for a compelling state interest, and that it's adverse to the private property right.

So the state's burden is on the city to show the state interest is necessary, and that the ordinance is adverse to the private property right.

Looking at the options again, which ones are about the state's burden on the city?

A and B are both about the state burden on the city.

So the options are between A and B.

The question is about whether the state's burden is on the city, which it is.

So the correct answer is about the state burden on the city, not on the plaintiff.

So the options A and B are the ones we're considering.

Option A: State burden, because it's adverse to a fundamental right.

Option B: State burden, because of negative impact on low-income.

So, the state's burden on the city is to show that the ordinance is necessary for a state interest and that it's adverse to the private property right. So the correct statement is that the state must demonstrate that it's necessary and that it's adverse.

Which of the options A or B reflects that.

Option A says that the state shows that it's necessary and that it's adverse. Option B says the state shows it's necessary and that it's a negative impact on low-income.

Wait, but the First Amendment's right of property is about any property, not just low-income. So the state's burden is on the city to show that it's necessary for a state interest, not just that it's bad for low-income.

So for example, if the city's law requires at least one bathroom per bedroom, that might be a state interest because it's related to property. So the state would need to show that it's necessary for a state interest.

Thus, the correct answer would be about the state burden on the city, not on the plaintiff.

So, the options A and B are about the state burden on the city.

So, the correct answer is either A or B.

But both options are correct in their reasoning, but which one is more accurate.

Wait, the First Amendment right is not only about low-income. It's about any right of property. So if the state's law imposes a requirement on all units, regardless of income, then the state's burden is to show that it's necessary for a state interest, not just that it's bad for low-income.

So the state must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary for a state interest. Therefore, the correct answer should be that the state burden is on the city, and that the ordinance is necessary for a state interest.

Looking at the options, A says the state burden is on the city, and it's because it's adverse to a fundamental right. But the state interest is on property rights, which is a fundamental right. So A's reasoning is correct.

Option B says the state burden is on the city, because it's a negative impact on low-income persons. But that's a different burden. The state's burden is on the city to show the state interest is necessary, not on the low-income impact.

So the correct answer is A. Because the state must show that the ordinance is necessary for a state interest (which it is) and that it's adverse to the fundamental right of property.

Thus, the correct answer is A.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the burden of persuasion in the suit against the city's ordinance. The city enacts a law requiring units to have at least one full bathroom per bedroom, specific plumbing/electrical systems, and a covered parking space. A majority of existing owners oppose this, arguing that it would reduce low-income housing units. The city enacts the law, and the plaintiff seeks to establish that the ordinance is unconstitutional. The burden of persuasion in this context is on the state, not on the plaintiff.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: States that the city must demonstrate the ordinance is necessary for a state interest and that it is adverse to the fundamental right of property. This aligns with the state's burden, as it must show the law is necessary for a state interest and is adverse to the private property right. The right of property is a fundamental right, making this option correct.

2. **Option B**: Focuses on the ordinance's impact on low-income individuals, arguing it negatively affects their rights. However, the burden of persuasion here is on the state to show the ordinance is necessary for a state interest, not on the plaintiff to address the impact on low-income individuals. This option incorrectly attributes the burden to the plaintiff.

3. **Option C** and **Option D**: Both focus on the plaintiff's burden, which is incorrect. The state's burden is on the city, not the plaintiff, and the state must demonstrate the ordinance's necessity for a state interest, not the absence of a rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately states that the city must demonstrate the ordinance is necessary for a state interest and that it is adverse to the fundamental right of property, fulfilling the state's burden of persuasion.
