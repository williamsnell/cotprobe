Okay, so I have this question about culture and something called cultural relativity. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking what Benedict (1934) means by cultural relativity. The options are A to J. I remember that "cultural relativity" is a concept from psychology and sociology, often associated with behaviorism. From what I recall, it refers to the idea that cultural differences are relative and depend on the context in which they are experienced.

Wait, what does Benedict mean? I think he wrote about this. I remember something about people having a "cultural perspective" that's shaped by their own experiences, leading to different ways of seeing the world. So, cultural relativity is about how cultural elements are understood based on the cultural context, not the content itself.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Comparing practices without bias. That sounds more like a perspective, maybe not relativity.

Option B: One's culture is superior. That doesn't fit. Relativity means it's relative, not absolute.

Option C: Economic system. That's about production, not relativity.

Option D: Inherited genetically. That's about heritability, not relativity.

Option E: Study of differences. Wait, that's more about variation, not relativity.

Option F: Belief about human behavior in context. That sounds familiar. It's about how behavior is influenced by culture's environment.

Option G: Adaptation to environment. That's about how culture becomes part of the environment, not relativity.

Option H: Scientific study of transmission through language/symbols. That's more about how symbols and language work, not relativity.

Option I: All cultures equal. That's a strong statement against variation, not relativity.

Option J: Process of adopting foreign elements. That's more about how cultures integrate, not the concept itself.

Wait, so the question is about what does Benedict mean. I think in his work, he posited cultural relativity as the idea that cultural differences are relative to the cultural context. So the belief that different cultures have different values, beliefs, etc., because they are observed in different ways.

Looking at the options, option F says: "Belief that human behavior can only be understood and evaluated within the context of its cultural environment." That aligns with the idea of cultural relativity being about how a person's understanding is shaped by their culture's context, not the other way around.

So the correct answer should be F.

The concept of cultural relativity, as interpreted by Benedict, refers to the belief that cultural differences are relative to the cultural context in which they are experienced. This means that a person's understanding and evaluation of the world are shaped by their cultural environment, not the other way around. 

Analyzing the options, the correct definition aligns with option F, which states that cultural relativity is the belief that human behavior can only be understood and evaluated within the context of its cultural environment.

ANSWER: F
