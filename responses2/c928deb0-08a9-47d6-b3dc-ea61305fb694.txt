Okay, so I have this physics problem here about photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves electrons being emitted from a metal surface when light of a certain frequency shines on it. The question gives me the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons and the work function of cesium. I need to find the longest wavelength of light that could produce this emission.

Wait, what's the work function again? Oh right, it's the minimum energy required to eject an electron from the metal surface. The formula I think is something like the energy of the photon equals the work function plus the kinetic energy of the electron. So E = φ + K.

The kinetic energy here is given as 2 eV. The work function φ is 1.8 eV. So substituting into the equation, E = 1.8 + 2 = 3.8 eV. So the photon's energy must be 3.8 eV.

Now, I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. To find the longest wavelength, I need the photon energy to be as low as possible (since longer wavelength corresponds to lower energy). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the longer the wavelength, the lower the energy of the photon. Because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength: E = hc/λ. So higher energy (E) corresponds to shorter wavelength (λ). So to find the longest possible wavelength, we need the photon energy to be the minimum required, which is 3.8 eV.

Wait, but wait, no! Because the work function is the minimum energy needed. So the minimum energy required is 1.8 eV, because without that, the photon's energy can't be enough. Wait, no, no: the photon's energy must be at least equal to φ. So if the photon's energy is exactly φ, then the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron is zero (it just barely gets emitted). So in this case, since the kinetic energy is 2 eV, the photon's energy is 1.8 + 2 = 3.8 eV. So that's the photon energy.

So now, the longest wavelength of light that can produce such emission would correspond to the maximum possible wavelength. Wait, but wait, no. The maximum wavelength would correspond to the minimum energy photon that can cause the emission. Because the longer the wavelength, the lower the energy. So the maximum wavelength would be when the photon's energy is just enough to cause the emission (i.e., 3.8 eV). 

Wait, but wait another thing. No, the maximum wavelength would actually be the longest possible wavelength that can produce the given effect. Or wait, perhaps I got that reversed. Let me think: The longer the wavelength, the lower the energy. So the maximum possible wavelength would correspond to the minimum energy photon that can cause the emission. Because if you use a longer wavelength, the photon has lower energy, so it can't provide enough energy for the electron to be emitted. So the maximum possible wavelength is when the photon's energy is exactly the minimum required, which is 3.8 eV. Because any longer wavelength would have lower energy than 3.8 eV, which isn't enough for the emission.

Wait, but wait, wait, no, no. Oh wait, no, the question is about the longest wavelength possible that could have produced the emission given the kinetic energy. So I think I'm getting this backwards. Let's clarify.

The maximum wavelength would be the one that gives the minimum energy photon (so that it can just barely cause the emission). So the photon energy is exactly 3.8 eV, so the wavelength is the longest possible. Because any longer wavelength (lower energy) photon can't provide the required energy.

Wait, no, because if the photon's energy is higher than 3.8 eV, then the kinetic energy of the electron would be more than 2 eV. But the question states that the kinetic energy is 2 eV. So the photon's energy must be exactly 3.8 eV, because any higher would give a higher kinetic energy, and any lower would give a lower. So the longest wavelength is when the photon's energy is 3.8 eV.

So once I have E = 3.8 eV, then λ = hc/E. But I need to compute this and make sure to convert units correctly.

Let me remember the constants. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, but I think it's often given in eV·s for these types of problems, but I might need to convert it.

Wait, alternatively, since 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules, and c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.

So, E = 3.8 eV = 3.8 * 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 3.8 * 1.602e-19 J = approx 6.0876e-19 J.

Then, λ = hc / E.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s.

So λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (6.0876e-19 J)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 6.0876e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 6.0876e-19 = approx 3.265e-7 meters.

Wait, because 1 meter is 1e9 nm, so 3.265e-7 m = 326.5 nm.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option D is 327 nm, and I got about 326.5, so that's close. But let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s,

c = 3.0e8 m/s,

E = 3.8 eV = 3.8 * 1.602e-19 J = 6.0876e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 6.0876e-19.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide numerator by E: 1.9878e-25 /6.0876e-19 = approximately (1.9878 /6.0876) * 1e-6.

1.9878 /6.0876 is approx 0.3265.

So 0.3265e-6 meters = 3.265e-7 meters. Which is 326.5 nm. So around 327 nm.

Looking at the options, option D is 327 nm. So the answer should be D.

To determine the longest wavelength of light that could produce the given emission, we start with the relationship between the energy of a photon, the work function of the metal, and the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons:

\[
E = \phi + K
\]

Here, the work function of cesium is given as \( \phi = 1.8 \, \text{eV} \), and the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is \( K = 2 \, \text{eV} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E = 1.8 \, \text{eV} + 2 \, \text{eV} = 3.8 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

Rearranging for the wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}.
\]

Using the constants \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( E = 3.8 \, \text{eV} \), we calculate the wavelength. First, convert the energy to joules:

\[
E = 3.8 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 6.0876 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Now substitute into the wavelength formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{6.0876 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}}.
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Divide by the energy:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{6.0876 \times 10^{-19}} = 3.265 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Convert to nanometers:

\[
\lambda = 3.265 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \times 10^9 \, \text{nm/m} = 326.5 \, \text{nm}.
\]

The longest wavelength corresponds to the minimum energy photon, which is \( 3.8 \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the longest wavelength is approximately \( 327 \, \text{nm} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: 327 nm.**
