Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Aquinas's natural law theory. Hmm, I remember Aquinas talked a lot about natural law, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me think.

The question is asking which of the options is a basic intrinsic good under Aquinas's view. The options are A: human life, B: human procreation, C: human sociability, D: all of the above.

Wait, Aquinas' natural law theory is part of his broader philosophy, which includes theology and ethics. Natural law is about the inherent worth of things. So, according to that, what are the basic intrinsic goods?

In his work "Summa Theologica," Aquinas defines natural law as the inherent worth of things, which includes things like the soul, the mind, and the body. So, intrinsic goods would be things that have inherent value.

Looking at the options: 

A) Human life. That's something that's obviously good because it's a fundamental aspect of human existence. Without life, humans wouldn't exist.

B) Human procreation. Hmm, that's about creating new people. I'm not sure if Aquinas would accept that as a basic good. Maybe he doesn't because it's more about creation and existence, not intrinsic value.

C) Human sociability. That's about how people interact. It's a social good. I'm not certain if Aquinas would include that as a basic intrinsic good.

D) All of the above. Wait, but I thought A might not be considered a basic intrinsic good in his system. Maybe Aquinas doesn't include that as a core value.

Wait, let me think again. Aquinas's natural law is about the inherent worth. So, basic intrinsic goods should include things like the soul, mind, body, and their inherent goodness. So human life is a basic intrinsic good because it's part of the soul. But procreation and sociability are different. Procreation is more about the creation process, and sociability is about social interaction. So maybe only A is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Procreation is about reproducing, which is a part of life. But is that considered intrinsic? Or is it more about the social dynamics? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to intrinsic goods as those that are inherent and not derived from the social context. So, human life is one. Procreation is perhaps about the social aspect of reproducing, but does Aquinas include that as a basic intrinsic good? I'm not so sure. I think Aquinas doesn't explicitly include procreation as a basic good in his natural law theory.

So, if that's the case, then the correct answer would be A: human life. Because it's an intrinsic good. The other options, B and C, I'm not sure about. Or perhaps B and C are also considered intrinsic.

Wait, another angle: in natural law, the basic goods are the soul, mind, body, and the soul's inherent goodness. So, does that include the ability to procreate or to be sociable? I don't think so. Procreation might be a social function, but the intrinsic good would be the soul's inherent worth. 

So, human life is a basic intrinsic good. Therefore, the correct answer would be A.

But wait, the question says "basic intrinsic good." So, looking at the options, option D says all of the above. Hmm, but I'm not sure about B and C.

Alternatively, maybe all of them are considered intrinsic. Because human life, being able to reproduce, and being sociable are all aspects that contribute to one's worth. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about Aquinas' views more closely. His natural law theory includes the inherent worth of mind, soul, body, and the soul's inherent goodness. So, human life (soul) is a basic good. Procreation ( reproducing) may not be considered a basic good because it's about social functions. Similarly, sociability (acting with others) might not be a basic good. So, only A is a basic intrinsic good.

But the options don't have an option about just A. The options are A, B, C, D, with D being all of the above.

Wait, if none of B and C are considered basic intrinsic goods, then the correct answer would be A.

But I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should think: are procreation and sociability considered intrinsic goods? In natural law, intrinsic goods are things that have inherent worth. So, for example, the mind's inherent worth, the soul's inherent worth. Procreation is about reproducing, but perhaps that's a social function. So, perhaps not considered a basic intrinsic good.

So, the correct answer would be A: human life.

But wait, the options are A, B, C, D as separate choices. So, the question asks which is a basic intrinsic good. If only A is correct, then the answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe B and C are considered intrinsic. I'm a bit stuck. Another thought: maybe the question is referring to natural law's intrinsic goods as the four elements (earth, water, air, fire) and the soul. So, human life is part of the soul, so intrinsic good. Procreation and sociability are social functions, not intrinsic.

So the correct answer is A. Therefore, the answer is A.

The question asks which of the options represents a basic intrinsic good according to Aquinas's natural law theory. Aquinas defines natural law as the inherent worth of things, including the soul, mind, body, and their inherent goodness. 

- **Option A: human life**  
  Human life is inherently good as it is a fundamental aspect of the soul. It is considered a basic intrinsic good, as Aquinas emphasizes the inherent worth of the soul.

- **Option B: human procreation**  
  Procreation is a social function rather than an intrinsic good. While it is part of human existence, it is not considered a basic intrinsic good in Aquinas's view.

- **Option C: human sociability**  
  Sociability is a social function and not an intrinsic good. Aquinas does not include it as a basic intrinsic good in his natural law theory.

- **Option D: all of the above**  
  Since both B and C are not considered basic intrinsic goods, this option is incorrect.

**Conclusion:** The only basic intrinsic good is human life.
