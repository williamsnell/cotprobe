Okay, so I've got this Black-Scholes question to tackle. Let me think through it step by step. Alright, let's see. The question is about using the delta-gamma approximation to find the new price of a put option when the stock price changes. Hmm, I remember delta and gamma are measures of how options' prices change with stock price movements, right?

So the initial setup: the stock price is $30, and the put option is $4. The delta is -0.28, and gamma is 0.10. The stock price is changing to $31.50, which is an increase of $1.50. I need to find the new put price.

Wait, the delta-gamma approximation uses the first two terms of the Taylor expansion, so it's like Delta * (new price change) + (Gamma * (ΔS)^2 / 2). Or wait, no, the formula is ΔP ≈ ΔΔS * (ΔS) + (1/2) Γ (ΔS)^2. Oh wait, actually, the formula is P ≈ P + ΔP + (1/2) Γ (ΔS)^2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: the change in the option price (ΔP) is approximately ΔΔS * ΔS (the delta times the change in stock) plus (Γ/2) times (ΔS)^2, because Gamma is the rate of change of Delta. So the formula would be:

ΔP ≈ Δ * ΔS + (Γ / 2) * (ΔS)^2.

Wait, no, more accurately, I think it's ΔP ≈ Delta * ΔS + (Gamma / 2) * (ΔS)^2. Because the first derivative is Delta, and the second derivative is Gamma. So the change is Delta multiplied by ΔS plus (Gamma) multiplied by (ΔS)^2 over 2. Because the second derivative is Gamma, which is the rate of change of Delta. So the second term is (Gamma / 2) * (ΔS)^2.

Alternatively, another way to look at it is that the second delta (gamma) is the change in delta per unit change in stock. But wait, in this case, since we're moving from 30 to 31.50, which is an increase by 1.50, the delta is -0.28, and gamma is 0.10. So let's calculate the delta delta.

Wait, let me get this clear. The stock price is $30, and it increases by $1.50 to $31.50. So the delta is -0.28, and gamma is 0.10. So the change in delta is delta * deltaS, which is -0.28 * 1.50. Let me compute that: -0.28 * 1.5 is -0.42. So the delta increases by -0.42. But wait, delta is the sensitivity of the option to the stock price change. So when the stock goes up, the option's price increases by delta.

Wait, wait, no, the delta is the change in option price per unit change in stock price. So if the stock goes up by deltaS, the option's price should change by Delta * deltaS. But wait, the delta is negative here, which means that when the stock price increases, the put option's price decreases. But in this case, the stock is increasing, so the put option should decrease in price. Wait, no, the put is a bit more complicated because it's a put, and the short put is losing value as the stock increases. Let me think again.

Wait, the put is a put option on a non-dividend-paying stock. So when the stock price goes up, the put option's value would decrease because the stock is getting further from the strike. So if the stock increases by 1.50, the put option's price should decrease by the amount given by delta. So the delta is -0.28, so the change in option price is delta * (31.50 - 30) = -0.28 * 1.5 = -0.42. So the put price would decrease by 0.42. So the new put price is 4 - 0.42 = 3.58. 

Wait, but wait, the gamma is 0.10. So the second term is (Gamma * (ΔS)^2)/2. So ΔS is 1.50. So (0.10 * (1.50)^2)/2 = (0.10 * 2.25)/2 = 0.225 / 2 = 0.1125. 

So the total change in option price is approximately -0.42 (from delta) plus 0.1125 (from gamma). So total change ΔP = -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075. 

So the new price is 4 - 0.3075 = 3.6925. Looking at the options, the closest is option J:3.9, but that's 3.6925 is closer to 3.7. Wait, no, the options don't have 3.7 as the immediate next. Let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 3.7. So is my calculation correct?

Wait, let me recheck because I'm a bit confused. The approximation is ΔP ≈ Delta * ΔS + (Gamma * (ΔS)^2)/2. So, Delta is -0.28, Gamma is 0.10. 

ΔS is 1.50.

So Delta part: -0.28 *1.50 = -0.42.

Gamma part: (0.10 * (1.5)^2 ) / 2 = (0.1 * 2.25)/2 = 0.225/2=0.1125.

So total change is -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075.

So the new price is 4 - 0.3075 = 3.6925.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:3.7, which is 3.70, but wait, 3.6925 is about 3.69, which is closer to 3.7 than 3.6. So the correct option would be E:3.7.

Wait but wait, let me think again. The initial price is 4. So we're going from $30 to $31.50, an increase of $1.50.

Another way: the change in delta is -0.28 * 1.50 = -0.42. The change in gamma is 0.10 * (1.50)^2 / 2 = 0.1125. 

So the approximate change in the option price is Delta * deltaS + (1/2) Gamma * (deltaS)^2.

Which is (-0.28)(1.5) + (0.1)(1.5)^2 / 2.

Calculating:

-0.28 * 1.5 = -0.42.

0.1 * 2.25 = 0.225; divided by 2 is 0.1125.

So total change is (-0.42) + 0.1125 = -0.3075.

So the new price is 4.00 - 0.3075 = 3.6925.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A:5.5, B:2.9, C:4.8, D:3.0, E:3.7, F:4.5, G:5.0, H:2.5, I:4.2, J:3.9.

So 3.6925 is approximately 3.69, which is closest to 3.7 (option E). But wait, why isn't option I:4.2 is higher? Because 3.69 is less than 4. So E is the closest.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again: when the stock price increases, the value of a put should decrease. So the initial price is 4. So the new price should be 4 - 0.3075 = 3.6925, which is approximately 3.69, so E is the correct answer.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is the opposite? Because I'm a bit confused about the sign. Let me think: the delta is negative, which means that as the stock goes up, the option price goes down. Oh wait, delta is the rate of change of the option price with respect to the stock price. So if delta is -0.28, when the stock goes up by 1.5, the option price goes down by 0.28 * 1.5 = 0.42.

So the put price would be 4 -0.42 = 3.58, but then we have to account for gamma. Gamma is 0.10, which is the rate of change of delta with respect to stock price. So the change in delta is delta * deltaS, which is -0.28 * 1.5 = -0.42. The change in delta is -0.42. But gamma is the derivative of delta with respect to S, so the change in delta is gamma * deltaS. So the change in delta is 0.1 * 1.5 = 0.15. Wait, that seems contradictory. Hmm, perhaps I need to recheck the formula.

Wait, the formula for the second term in the Taylor expansion is (1/2)*Gamma*(deltaS)^2. So perhaps the change in delta is Gamma*(deltaS), which would be 0.10 * 1.5 = 0.15. So the delta would change by 0.15, which would make the new delta: -0.42 + 0.15 = -0.27. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because we're calculating the change in the option price, not in delta.

Wait, no. The delta is the derivative of the option price with respect to the stock price. So the change in delta is Gamma * deltaS. So for each dollar increase in S, delta increases by Gamma * deltaS. So if Gamma is 0.10, then the change in delta is 0.10 * 1.50 = 0.15. So the new delta is -0.28 + 0.15 = -0.13. Hmm, but that's the change in delta, not the change in the option price. So perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. The change in the option price is approximately Delta * deltaS + (1/2)*Gamma*(deltaS)^2. So the first term is the linear change, and the second is the quadratic. So the change in price is that sum. So, let me recalculate.

Change in price = Delta * deltaS + (1/2)*Gamma*(deltaS)^2.

Delta is -0.28, deltaS is 1.5.

So:

Delta part: -0.28 * 1.5 = -0.42.

Gamma part: 0.10 * (1.5)^2 / 2 = 0.1 * 2.25 / 2 = 0.225 / 2 = 0.1125.

So total change is -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075.

So the new price is 4.00 - 0.3075 = 3.6925.

Which is approximately 3.70, so option E is correct.

To determine the new price of the put option using the delta-gamma approximation, we start with the given values: the stock price increases from $30 to $31.50, resulting in a change of $1.50 ($\Delta S = +1.50$). The initial put price is $4.00, the delta ($\Delta$) is $-0.28$, and the gamma ($\Gamma$) is $0.10$. The formula for the delta-gamma approximation is:

\[
\Delta P \approx \Delta \cdot \Delta S + \frac{1}{2} \Gamma \cdot (\Delta S)^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the linear change in the option price
The linear change in the option price is given by:
\[
\Delta P_{\text{linear}} = \Delta \cdot \Delta S = (-0.28) \cdot 1.50 = -0.42
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the quadratic change in the option price
The quadratic change in the option price is given by:
\[
\Delta P_{\text{quadratic}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \Gamma \cdot (\Delta S)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.10 \cdot (1.50)^2 = 0.05 \cdot 2.25 = 0.1125
\]

### Step 3: Combine the changes
The total change in the option price is the sum of the linear and quadratic changes:
\[
\Delta P = \Delta P_{\text{linear}} + \Delta P_{\text{quadratic}} = -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the new option price
The new option price is the initial price plus the total change:
\[
P_{\text{new}} = P + \Delta P = 4.00 - 0.3075 = 3.6925
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated new price of $3.6925 is closest to $3.70, which corresponds to option **E**.
