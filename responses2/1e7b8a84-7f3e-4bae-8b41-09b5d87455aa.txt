Okay, so I need to find the wavelength of the first line in the visible (Balmer) series for hydrogen. The transition is from orbit 3 to 2. Hmm, I remember that the Balmer series is about transitions from higher energy levels to the second level (n=2). 

Wait, the Balmer formula is something like 1/λ = R (1/2² - 1/3²), where R is the Rydberg constant. I think the Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. Oh wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that R is about 1.097e7 m^-1. Oh wait, no, the Rydberg constant is 1.097e7 m^-1. So 1/λ equals R multiplied by (1/(2²) - 1/(3²)). Let's compute that.

Calculating the terms inside the parenthesis: 1/4 is 0.25, and 1/9 is approximately 0.1111. So 0.25 minus 0.1111 equals 0.1389. So 1/λ = 1.097e7 m^-1 * 0.1389. Let me compute that.

Wait, 1.097e7 times 0.1389. Let me calculate 1.097 * 0.1389. Hmm. 1 * 0.1389 is 0.1389, 0.097 * 0.1389 is about 0.0134. So adding them gives 0.1523. So 0.1523e7 m^-1. That's 1.523e6 m^-1. Wait no, wait, 1.097e7 * 0.1389 is (1.097 * 0.1389) * 1e7. So 1.097 *0.1389 is approximately 0.1522. So 0.1522e7 m^-1. Wait, no: 1.097e7 is 1.097 * 1e7. Multiplying by 0.1389 gives 1.097 * 0.1389 * 1e7. Let me compute 1.097 * 0.1389.

1.097 * 0.1389 = let's compute that more accurately. 1 * 0.1389 = 0.1389. 0.097 * 0.1389. Let's break that down: 0.09 * 0.1389 = 0.012501, and 0.007 *0.1389=0.0009723. So total is 0.012501 + 0.0009723= 0.0134733. So sum is 0.1389 + 0.0134733 = 0.1523733. So 0.1523733 * 1e7 = 1.523733e6 m^-1. So 1/λ = 1.523733e6 m^-1. So λ is 1e6 / 1.523733 m.

Wait, wait. 1e6 is 1,000,000. 1e6 divided by 1.523733e6 is approximately (1,000,000 / 1,523,733) meters. Let me compute that. 1e6 / 1.523733e6 is approximately 0.6563 meters, which is 656.3 micrometers or 656.3 nm. Wait, but the options are in Angstroms. Oh wait, 1 meter is 1e10 angstroms. So 656.3e-6 meters is 656.3e-10 * 1e10 = 656.3 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again. Because the Rydberg constant is actually about 1.097e7 m^-1. Wait, no, yes, because the Rydberg constant is about 1.097e7 m^-1. So 1/λ = R (1/2² - 1/3²) = 1.097e7 * (1/4 -1/9) = 1.097e7 * (5/36) ≈ 1.097e7 * 0.138888...

Wait, 1.097e7 * 5/36. Let me compute it more accurately.

5/36 is approximately 0.138888... So 1.097e7 * 0.138888 = let me compute that. 1.097 * 0.138888 is about 0.15237, so 0.15237e7 m^-1. So 1/λ= 1.5237e6 m^-1. So λ is 1e6 / 1.5237e6 m. Wait, but 1e6 is 1,000,000. 1e6 / 1.5237e6 = 1 / 1.5237 ≈ 0.6563 meters, which is 656.3 nm. So that's 656.3 Angstroms.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 6560 A, which is 6560 Angstroms. Oh wait, no—option H is 6560A, which is 6560 Angstroms, which is 656 nm. Ah, yes, because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 6560 Å is 656 nm. So the correct answer is 6560 Å, which is option H.

Wait, but wait, the options given are:

H:6560A

So the correct answer should be option H, which is 6560 Angstroms.

To calculate the wavelength of the first line in the Balmer series for hydrogen, where the electron transitions occur from orbit 3 to orbit 2, we use the Balmer formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right)
\]

Here, \( R \) is the Rydberg constant, approximately \( 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} \right)
\]

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{1}{4} = 0.25, \quad \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.1111, \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} = 0.25 - 0.1111 = 0.1389
\]

Now calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \times 0.1389 \approx 1.523 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{1.523 \times 10^6} \, \text{m} \approx 656.3 \, \text{nm}
\]

Since \( 1 \, \text{nm} = 10 \, \text{Å} \), the wavelength is:

\[
\lambda \approx 6560 \, \text{Å}
\]

This corresponds to option H.
