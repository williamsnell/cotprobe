Okay, so I have this problem here. It's about choosing 3 cards from a standard deck where all three cards must be of different suits. The question is asking how many ways there are to do this, and the options are given from A to J. 

Hmm, let's break this down. A standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. So, I need to select 3 cards, each from a different suit. 

Wait, so the first thing that comes to mind is that since each card must come from a different suit, each of the three cards must come from one of the four suits. But since we're choosing three cards, we can't have more than one card from any single suit. So, the suits for the three cards must be three different suits, right? Because if all three were from the same suit, then two would be the same, but since each must be different, each must come from a unique suit.

So, the first step is to choose which three suits we're going to pick from. There are four suits in total, so the number of ways to choose three suits from four is given by the combination formula C(n, k) where n is 4 and k is 3. C(4,3) is 4. So there are four possible sets of suits.

Now, for each of those sets of three suits, I need to figure out how many ways I can choose one card from each suit. Since each suit has 13 cards, for each suit, the number of ways to choose one card is 13. Since the choices are independent across suits, I multiply the number of choices for each suit together. 

So, for one set of three suits, the number of ways is 13 * 13 * 13. Wait, no, that's 13^3. 13 multiplied three times is 2197. But wait, no, because each of the three suits contributes 13 choices, so it's 13 (for the first suit) multiplied by 13 (for the second) multiplied by 13 (for the third), which is 13^3. 13*13 is 169, multiplied by 13 is 2197. 

But wait, that's for one set of three suits. Since there are four possible sets of three suits, I need to multiply this by the number of ways to choose the suits. So, 4 (number of suit combinations) times 2197. 

Wait, 4 * 2197 is 8788. Oh wait, but let me check that again. So, 13^3 is 2197, and 4 * 2197 is 8788. So, that's the total number of ways. 

Looking back at the options, option B is 8788. So I think that's the correct answer. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Is there another way to approach this problem to confirm? Let's think about the selection process. 

Another approach: How many ways are there to choose 3 cards all of different suits. So each card must come from a unique suit, so the first card has 52 options, the second must be from a different suit than the first, so 39 options (since 52 - 13 =39), and the third must be from a different suit than the first two, so 26 options (52 - 26=26). 

But wait, since the order doesn't matter, we need to adjust for that. Because when I choose the first, second, third, it's permutations, but combinations require division by 3! since the order doesn't matter. 

So, the total number would be (52 * 39 * 26) / 6. Let's calculate that. 

First, 52 *39 is 2028. Multiply by 26: 2028 *26. Let's compute 2000*26=52,000, and 28*26=728, so total is 52,728. 

Divide by 6: 52,728 รท6 = 8788. 

So that's the same as before. So the answer is 8788, which is option B.

The problem requires selecting 3 cards from a standard deck where each card must be from a different suit. 

First, choose 3 suits out of 4, which can be done in C(4,3)=4 ways. For each selection of three suits, each card has 13 options, leading to 13^3=2197 possibilities. Multiply this by 4: 4*2197=8788. 

Alternatively, using permutations and adjusting for order: (52*39*26)/6 = 8788. Both methods confirm the answer is 8788.
