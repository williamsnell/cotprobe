Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the percentage of Americans who think the U.S. and Germany have a good relationship. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the question is about the relationship between the U.S. and Germany in 2019. I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage, but I know there's some media coverage and perhaps some survey data. 

I recall that in 2019, a significant portion of Americans were asked about their thoughts on international relations. I think the percentage might be around 70-80%. I remember reading that around 75% of Americans believe the U.S. and Germany have a good relationship. Or maybe it's 80%. Wait, I think the exact figure might be 75%.

Looking at the options provided, option B is 75%, option F is 70%, and option E is 80%. Since I'm pretty sure it's around 75% based on my previous knowledge, I'm leaning towards B. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes sources can vary slightly. 

Wait, another thought: I remember a study or a report that mentioned around 75% of respondents thought the relationship was good. That would confirm option B. So I'm pretty confident that B is the correct answer.

The correct answer is B: 75%.
