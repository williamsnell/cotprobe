B: Nine
C: Four

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about maximizing profits by hiring the right number of workers. Let me see if I can figure this out. Alright, the question says that the wage rate is $30 per day, and the factory owner is considering how many workers to hire. There's a table provided with the number of workers and their corresponding Value of Marginal Product (VMP) per day. 

Wait, the table isn't shown, but from what I remember, it's something like this. Let me think. Oh, right, the table probably starts at 6 workers. So the first row is 6 workers with VMP of $50, next is 7 with $70, then 8 with $35, 9 with $20, and 10 with $10. 

So the idea is to hire workers until the VMP of the next worker equals the wage rate. Because if the VMP is higher than the wage, it's profitable to hire that worker. But if VMP is less than the wage, it's not. So the optimal number is where VMP equals the wage, or just up to that point.

Wait, but in the table, the VMP is decreasing. Let's see: 6 workers, 50. 7:70. 8:35. 9:20. 10:10. So each additional worker brings a lower VMP. 

So the first worker (6) brings 50, which is more than 30. So hire that. Then 7 brings 70, which is more than 30. Hire that. 8 brings 35, which is more than 30. So hire that. 9 brings 20, which is less than 30. So now, perhaps it's better to stop hiring. Because the next VMP is below the wage. But wait, we need to check when VMP is equal to the wage. 

Wait, actually, the rule is to hire workers as long as the VMP is greater than the wage. So if the next VMP is less than the wage, you stop. So in this case, the VMP for the 9th worker is 20, which is less than 30. So you wouldn't hire the 9th worker. Because the next one brings less than the wage. But wait, maybe the VMP is the additional revenue the worker brings. So if the 9th worker's VMP is 20, which is less than the wage of 30, then it's not profitable to hire the 9th worker. So you would stop at the point before that, which is the 8th worker.

Wait, but wait, another way to think is that you keep adding workers as long as the VMP is higher than the wage. Let me list the VMP for each worker:

Worker 6: 50 >30 → hire.
Worker 7:70>30 → hire.
Worker8:35>30 → hire.
Worker9:20<30 → don't hire.

So the maximum number of workers is 8, because beyond that, it's not profitable. So the owner should hire 8 workers.

Wait, but let me double-check. The VMP for 8 is 35, which is higher than 30, so it's worth hiring. 9th is 20, which is less, so no. So total workers would be 8, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are given as A:8, B:9, etc. So the correct choice is A: eight.

To determine the optimal number of workers to hire to maximize profits, we compare the value of the marginal product (VMP) of each additional worker to the wage rate of $30 per day. Hiring workers continues until the VMP of the next worker is less than the wage rate.

From the table:
- Worker 6: VMP = $50 > $30 → hire.
- Worker 7: VMP = $70 > $30 → hire.
- Worker 8: VMP = $35 > $30 → hire.
- Worker 9: VMP = $20 < $30 → stop hiring.

Thus, the factory owner should hire **8 workers** to maximize profits.
