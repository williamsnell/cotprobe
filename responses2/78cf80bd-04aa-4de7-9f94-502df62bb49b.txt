Okay, so I have this physics question here about a rocket escaping Earth's gravitational field. Hmm, I remember that's a classic escape velocity problem. Right, escape velocity is the speed needed for an object to break free from Earth's gravity without further propulsion. Let's think about the formula.

I recall that the formula for escape velocity is v = sqrt(2 * G * M / r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of Earth, and r is the radius of Earth. But wait, I don't remember the exact numbers for G and M. Oh wait, but sometimes there's a simplified version where escape velocity is approximately sqrt(2 * g * R), where g is Earth's gravitational acceleration and R is Earth's radius.

Wait, I think g is about 9.8 m/s², and R is about 6.4 million meters. So plugging those in: 2 * 9.8 * 6.4e6. Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 2 * 9.8 is 19.6. Then, 19.6 multiplied by 6.4e6. Let's compute 19.6 * 6.4 = 125.44. So 125.44e6, which is 1.2544e8.

Wait, but that's the squared term inside the square root. So the escape velocity is sqrt(1.2544e8) m/s. Let me compute that. The square root of 1.25e8 is approximately 1.12e4 m/s. Wait, because 1e4 squared is 1e8, and 1.25e8 is (1.12e4)^2. Let me check: (1.12e4)^2 is 1.12² * 1e8. 1.12 squared is 1.2544, yes. So sqrt(1.2544e8) is 1.12e4 m/s. So the escape velocity is about 11,200 m/s.

Looking at the options, A is 1.12×10^4 m/s. That's 11,200 m/s. So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the escape velocity from Earth's gravitational field, we use the formula:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
\]

For Earth, this simplifies to approximately:

\[
v \approx \sqrt{2 \cdot g \cdot R}
\]

Where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and \( R = 6.4 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \). Plugging these values:

\[
v = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 6.4 \times 10^6} = \sqrt{1.2544 \times 10^8} \approx 1.12 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

This corresponds to option A.
