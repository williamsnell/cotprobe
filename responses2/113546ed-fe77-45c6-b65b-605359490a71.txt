Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to think through it step by step. Let me try to work it out.

The question says there are N particles, each can be in two energy levels: +ε and -ε. We need to find the internal energy of the system.

Wait, right, internal energy would be the sum of the energies of all the particles. So for each particle, it's either +ε or -ε. But wait, I have to think about the probabilities of being in each state.

The probability of occupying an energy level is given by P_E = e^{-E/(k T)}. Hmm, but wait, let me check the exponent. The question says P_E = e^{-E/(k T)}. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait, the given formula is P_E = e^{-E/(k T)}. Or wait, no, the problem says P_E = e^{-E/(k T)}, but wait, the formula isn't correct because if E is positive, then e^-E/(kT) is less than 1. But another formula I've seen is P = e^{-E/(kT)} / Z, where Z is the partition function. Oh, so maybe the given P_E is actually a part of the partition function.

Wait, let me read the problem again. Oh, the probability is given by P_E = e^{- E/(k T)}. Hmm, so maybe the denominator is missing. Oh, but perhaps it's supposed to be the general form. Because usually P_E = e^{-E/(k T)} / Z, where Z is the sum over all states. So I think the question might have a typo, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the given formula is correct and I should use it as is.

Wait, the problem says P_E = e^{-E/(k T)}, but that doesn't account for the Boltzmann factor. Oh, wait, no, no. Actually, the standard formula is P(E) = [e^{-E/(k T)} ] / Z, where Z is the partition function. So perhaps the given P_E is the reciprocal of the Boltzmann factor, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, wait, the problem says the probability of occupying an energy level is P_E = e^{-E/(k T)}. That doesn't make sense because if E is positive, then e^-E is less than 1, so P_E would be less than 1. But the partition function is generally a sum of exponentials. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and the P_E is as given.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula actually is P(E) = e^{-E/(k T)} / Z, but the problem states it as P_E = e^{-E/(k T)}. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I should use the given formula, not the standard one.

So each particle can be in state +ε with probability P_+ and state -ε with probability P_-.

Wait, but wait, what about the normalization? Because probabilities must sum to 1. So P_+ + P_- = 1.

So let's compute P_+ and P_-.

P_+ = e^{- (ε)/(k T)} / Z, where Z is the partition function.

But wait, what is Z? The partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each state. So for each particle, the energy is either +ε or -ε. So each particle's partition function is e^{+ε/(k T)} + e^{-ε/(k T)}.

So Z = e^{ε/(k T)} + e^{-ε/(k T)}.

So P_+ = e^{-ε/(k T)} / Z = [e^{-ε/(k T)} ] / [ e^{ε/(k T)} + e^{-ε/(k T)} ]

Similarly, P_- = e^{ε/(k T)} / Z.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Because in the given formula, P_E is e^{-E/(k T)}, so perhaps each particle's energy is E = -ε, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps E is the energy of the state, and each particle can be in either +ε or -ε. So the energies of the states are ±ε.

Wait, but in that case, each particle has two possible energies: +ε and -ε.

But wait, the question says "each of which can exist in only two energy levels +ε and -ε."

So for each particle, the possible energies are +ε and -ε.

But when considering the internal energy, each particle's energy is either +ε or -ε. So the average energy per particle is the sum over the probabilities of each state multiplied by its energy.

So average energy per particle: <E> = P_+ * (+ε) + P_- * (-ε).

Then, the internal energy U would be N * <E>.

But wait, let's compute this.

But first, let's compute P_+ and P_-. The given formula is P_E = e^{- E/(k T)}, but wait, for each particle, E is either +ε or -ε. So:

P_+ (for E=+ε) is e^{- (+ε)/(k T)} / Z.

P_- (for E=-ε) is e^{- (-ε)/(k T)} / Z.

Wait, no, wait, the partition function Z is the sum over states of e^{-E/(k T)}.

But in this problem, each particle has two states: +ε and -ε.

So Z = e^{- (+ε)/(k T)} + e^{- (-ε)/(k T)} } = e^{-ε/(k T)} + e^{+ ε/(k T)}.

Which is Z = e^{ε/(k T)} + e^{-ε/(k T)}.

So, P_+ = e^{- (+ε)/(k T)} / Z = e^{- ε/(k T)} / (e^{ε/(k T)} + e^{- ε/(k T)}).

Similarly, P_- = e^{- (-ε)/(k T)} / Z = e^{ε/(k T)} / (e^{ε/(k T)} + e^{- ε/(k T)}).

Let me factor the denominator. Let me denote x = e^{ε/(k T)}. Then the denominator is x + 1/x. So, x + 1/x = (x^2 +1)/x.

So P_+ = e^{-ε/(k T)} / (x + 1/x) = [1/x] / ( (x^2 +1)/x ) )= [1/x] * [x/(x² +1) )] = 1/(x² + 1) )

Similarly, P_- = e^{ε/(k T)} / (x + 1/x) = x / ( (x² +1) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, let me compute P_+ and P_- in terms of x= e^{ε/(k T)}.

So, x = e^{ε/(k T)}.

Then, P_+ = e^{-ε/(k T)} / (x + 1/x) = e^{-ε/(k T)} / (x + 1/x )

But e^{-ε/(k T)} = 1/x, so the numerator is 1/x.

Denominator: x +1/x = (x^2 +1)/x.

So P_+ = (1/x) / [ (x² +1)/x ] ) = (1/x) * (x)/(x² +1 )= 1/(x² +1 ).

Similarly, P_- = e^{ε/(k T)} / (x +1/x) ) = x/(x +1/x ) = x^2/(x² + 1 )

Wait, let me compute this.

x = e^{ε/(k T)}.

Then, x² = e^{2 ε/(k T)}.

So P_+ = 1/(x² +1 ), P_- = x²/(x² +1 ).

Wait, that's correct because P_+ + P_- = [1 + x² ]/(x² +1 ) = 1.

So the average energy per particle is:

< E > = P_+ * (+ε) + P_- * (-ε )

= [ (1/(x² +1 )) * ε ] + [ (x²/(x² +1 )) * (-ε) ]

Factor ε/(x² +1 ):

= ε/(x² +1 ) [ 1 - x² ]

Wait, because 1 - x² is the numerator.

So,

< E > = ε [ (1 - x²) ] / (x² + 1 )

But x² = e^{2 ε/(k T) }, so 1 - x² = 1 - e^{2 ε/(k T)}.

Denominator: x² +1 = e^{2 ε/(k T)} + 1.

So,

< E> = ε ( 1 - e^{2 ε/(k T)} ) / ( 1 + e^{2 ε/(k T)} )

Hmm, can we simplify this expression?

Yes, because 1 - e^{2a} = - (e^{a} - e^{-a} ) * e^{-a}, wait let's see.

Alternatively, note that 1 - e^{2a} = (1 - e^{a})(1 + e^{a} )

Wait, wait,

Let me compute:

1 - x² = 1 - e^{2a} where a= ε/(k T).

Let me write 1 - e^{2a} = (1 - e^{a})(1 + e^{a} )? Let me check.

(1 - e^a)(1 + e^a) = 1 + e^a - e^a - e^{2a} = 1 - e^{2a}.

So yes, 1 - e^{2a} = (1 - e^a)(1 + e^a).

Similarly, 1 + e^{2a} = (e^{a} + e^{-a} ) e^{a} ?

Wait, (e^{a} + e^{-a}) e^a = e^{2a} + 1. Oh, right, so 1 + e^{2a} = (e^{a} + e^{-a}) e^{a}.

But perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 - e^{2a}) = -(e^{2a} - 1) = - (e^a - e^{-a}) ) * 2 e^{-a} } ?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me think about the expression:

< E> = ε (1 - e^{2a} ) / (1 + e^{2a} )

We can factor out e^{a} from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: 1 - e^{2a} = e^{a} (e^{-a} - e^{a}) ) = -e^{a} (e^{a} - e^{-a} )

Denominator: 1 + e^{2a} = e^{a} ( e^{-a} + e^{a} )

So,

(1 - e^{2a})/(1 + e^{2a}) = [ -e^{a} (e^{a} - e^{-a}) ] / [ e^{a} (e^{a} + e^{-a}) ) ]

Hmm, the e^{a} terms cancel:

= [ - (e^{a} - e^{-a} ) ] / (e^{a} + e^{-a} )

Note that [e^{a} - e^{-a} ] is 2 sinh a, and [e^{a} + e^{-a} ] is 2 cosh a.

So,

= [ - (2 sinh a) ] / (2 cosh a ) ) = - sinh a / cosh a = - tanh a.

So,

< E> = ε ( - tanh a )

But a = ε/(k T), so:

< E> = - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

So, the average energy per particle is - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

Wait, but wait, this seems a bit odd. Because the energy per particle can't be negative? Or can it?

Wait, each particle can have energy +ε or -ε. So for each particle, the average can't be negative? Let me think.

No, because the probabilities are weighted with the energies. For example, if ε/(k T) is large, which means the thermal energy is high, so the particles are more likely to be in the +ε state. So the average energy would be positive. But according to the formula, when a is large, tanh a approaches 1. So <E> would be -ε * 1 = -ε. That would imply the average energy is negative, which seems impossible because each particle can't have negative energy on average if that's the case.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, let me recheck. Let's recompute [1 - e^{2a} ] / [1 + e^{2a} ]

= [ (1 - e^{a})(1 + e^a) ) ] / [ (e^{a} + e^{-a}) e^{a} ) ]

Wait, denominator is 1 + e^{2a} = e^{a} (e^{-a} + e^{a}) ) = e^a ( 2 cosh a )

Wait, perhaps to factor numerator and denominator, I can write:

Numerator: 1 - e^{2a} = - (e^{2a} -1 ) = - (e^{a} - e^{-a} ) e^{a} ) * 2?

Wait, no. Let me write 1 - e^{2a} as -(e^{2a} -1 ) = -(e^{a} - e^{-a} ) * e^{a}.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express 1 - e^{2a} = -(e^{a} - e^{-a} ) * e^{-a} * 2?

No, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me factor out e^{a}:

1 - e^{2a} = e^{a} ( e^{-a} - e^{a} ) = -e^{a} (e^a - e^{-a} )

Similarly, denominator: 1 + e^{2a} = e^{a} ( e^{-a} + e^{a} ) ) = e^{a} (2 cosh a )

So,

< E> = ε * [ - e^{a} (e^{a} - e^{-a} ) ] / [ e^{a} (2 cosh a ) ) ]

The e^{a} terms cancel:

= ε [ - (e^{a} - e^{-a} ) ] / ( 2 cosh a )

But (e^{a} - e^{-a} ) = 2 sinh a, and cosh a = (e^{a} + e^{-a} ) / 2.

So,

= ε [ - 2 sinh a ] / ( 2 cosh a )

The 2's cancel:

= - ε sinh a / cosh a = - ε tanh a.

So, < E> = - ε tanh (a )

But a= ε/(k T), so:

< E> = - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

Hmm, that's the average energy per particle.

Wait, but let me think about this. If ε/(k T) is large, then tanh(ε/(k T)) approaches 1. So <E> per particle becomes -ε. But that implies each particle is on average in the -ε state. But wait, the energy levels are +ε and -ε. So for each particle, the energy is either +ε or -ε. The average being negative suggests that it's more likely to be in the -ε state.

But wait, let's think about the problem again. Each particle can be in either state. The average energy per particle is the expectation value of the energy, which is a sum over the possible energies weighted by their probabilities.

So if the average per particle is negative, that would imply that the system as a whole has negative internal energy. But that seems possible if N is large, but perhaps the system as a whole could have that.

But wait, let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 0. Option D is -ε N.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me check the average again. Let me go back.

We have:

< E> = [ P_+ * (+ε) + P_- * (-ε) ]

= ε [ P_+ / (P_+ + P_-) ) - P_- / (P_+ + P_- ) ]

Wait, because if you factor out ε, you can write it as:

= ε [ (P_+ - P_- ) / (P_+ + P_- ) ]

Because P_+ * (1) + P_- * (-1) = (P_+ - P_-).

So,

< E > = ε (P_+ - P_- ) / (P_+ + P_- )

Hmm, perhaps that's a better way to compute it. Let me compute P_+ and P_-.

Earlier, we found:

P_+ = 1/(x² + 1 ), and P_- = x²/(x² +1 ), where x = e^{ε/(k T)}.

So,

P_+ - P_- = [1 - x² ] / (x² + 1 )

P_+ + P_- = (1 + x² ) / (x² +1 ) = 1.

So,

< E> = ε [ (1 - x² ) / (x² + 1 ) ]

Which is the same as earlier.

So, < E> = ε (1 - e^{2 ε/(k T)} ) / (1 + e^{2 ε/(k T)} )

Which is the same as <E> = - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

But wait, let's think about this. If the temperature is high, T >> ε/(k T) ? Wait, no. If T is very high, ε/(k T) is small. So tanh( ε/(k T) ) ≈ ε/(k T).

So, <E> ≈ - ε ( ε/(k T) ) ) / 1 = - ε²/(k T )

But that's a very small negative, which is close to zero.

Hmm, but the average energy per particle could be negative, but for a system with a large number of particles, the total internal energy could be small.

But looking at the options, option F is zero, and option D is -ε N.

Wait, but let me recalculate the average.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs earlier. Let me recompute <E>.

Wait, I think earlier I made a mistake in the sign when calculating the average.

Wait, P_+ is 1/(x² +1 ), P_- is x²/(x² + 1 ).

So,

P_+ = 1/(x² +1 ), which is 1/( e^{2 ε/(k T)} + 1 )

P_- = e^{2 ε/(k T)} / ( e^{2 ε/(k T)} + 1 )

So,

P_+ = 1/(1 + e^{2 ε/(k T)} )

P_-

So,

P_+ + P_- = 1.

Now, <E> per particle is (P_+ * (+ε) ) + (P_- * (- ε )) )

= ε [ P_+ / (P_+ + P_- ) - P_- / (P_+ + P_- ) ]

= ε [ (P_+ - P_- )/(P_+ + P_- ) ]

But since P_+ + P_- =1,

< E> = ε ( P_+ - P_- )

= ε [ (1/(x² + 1 )) - (x²/(x² + 1 )) ]

= ε [ (1 - x² ) / (x² + 1 ) ]

Which is the same as before.

Now, substituting x = e^{ε/(k T)}.

So, 1 - x² = 1 - e^{2 ε/(k T)}.

So,

< E> = ε [ (1 - e^{2 ε/(k T)} ) / (1 + e^{2 ε/(k T)} ) ]

Which can be written as:

= - ε [ (e^{2 ε/(k T)} - 1 ) / (e^{2 ε/(k T)} + 1 ) ]

= - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

Because [e^{a} - 1]/[e^{a} +1 ] = (e^{a/2 } - e^{-a/2 } ) * e^{-a/2 } / (e^{a/2 } + e^{-a/2 } ) * e^{-a/2 }

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

So, the per-particle average energy is negative.

Hmm, but is that possible? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the partition function for each particle. Wait, each particle has two states, so the partition function per particle is Z = e^{+ε/(k T)} + e^{-ε/(k T)} = e^{ε/(k T)} ( e^{-ε/(k T)} + e^{-3ε/(k T)} ) )? No, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that each particle's energy can be either +ε or -ε, the average would be something like (1-p) * (-ε) + p * (+ε) = ε (2p -1 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the average in terms of probabilities.

Wait, the expected value of each particle's energy is:

E = (+ε) * P_+ + (-ε) * P_-.

= ε ( P_+ - P_- )

So,

E = ε ( [1/(x² +1 )] - [ x²/(x² + 1 ) ] )

= ε [ (1 - x² ) / (x² + 1 ) ]

Which is the same as before.

So, the internal energy is N * E.

So,

U = N * [ ε (1 - x^2 ) / (1 + x^2 ) ]

But x = e^{ε/(k T)}, so x² = e^{2 ε/(k T)}.

So,

U = N * ε (1 - e^{2 ε/(k T)} ) / ( 1 + e^{2 ε/(k T)} )

We can factor numerator and denominator as follows.

Numerator: 1 - e^{2a} = -(e^{2a} - 1 )

Denominator: 1 + e^{2a} = e^{2a} + 1

But perhaps we can write this as:

[1 - e^{2a} ] / [1 + e^{2a} ] = [ (1 - e^a)(1 + e^a) ) ] / [ (e^a + e^{-a} ) e^a ]

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor e^{a} from numerator and denominator.

So,

[1 - e^{2a} ] / [1 + e^{2a} ] = e^{-a} [e^{a} - e^{-a} ] / [ e^{a} + e^{-a} ].

Which is e^{-a} * [ 2 sinh a ] / [ 2 cosh a ].

So,

= e^{-a} * ( sinh a ) / ( cosh a )

= e^{-a} * tanh a.

Because sinh a / cosh a = tanh a.

So,

U = N * ε * e^{-a} * tanh a.

But a = ε/(k T), so e^{-a} = e^{-ε/(k T)}.

So,

U = N ε e^{-ε/(k T)} tanh(ε/(k T)).

Hmm, but that doesn't look like any of the options given.

Wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the average energy per particle as follows.

The average energy per particle is:

E_avg = sum_{states} [ (energy) * (probability) ]

Which is (+ε)*P_+ + (-ε)*P_-.

= ε ( P_+ - P_- )

As before.

Let me compute P_+ - P_-:

P_+ - P_- = [1/(x² +1 ) ] - [ x²/(x² +1 ) ]

= (1 - x² ) / (x² +1 )

Now, x = e^{a}, where a = ε/(k T).

So,

x² = e^{2a}.

1 - x² = 1 - e^{2a}.

So,

P_+ - P_- = (1 - e^{2a}) / (e^{2a} + 1 )

Which can be written as:

(1 - e^{2a}) / (e^{2a} + 1 ) = (1 - e^{a}e^{a}) / (e^{a}e^{a} + 1 )

Hmm, perhaps factor e^{a} from numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, write numerator as (1 - e^{a}) (1 + e^{a} ) / (1 + e^{a} ) ) ?

Wait, 1 - e^{2a} = (1 - e^{a})(1 + e^{a} )

Similarly, 1 + e^{2a} = (1 + e^{a})(e^{-a} + e^{a} ) )

Hmm, perhaps that's getting somewhere.

So,

(1 - e^{2a}) / (1 + e^{2a} ) = [ (1 - e^{a})(1 + e^{a}) ) ] / [ (1 + e^{a}) (e^{-a} + e^{a} ) ) ]

Cancel (1 + e^{a}) terms.

Leaves:

(1 - e^{a}) ) / (e^{-a} + e^{a} )

But e^{-a} + e^{a} = 2 cosh a.

So,

(1 - e^{a} ) / (2 cosh a )

= [ 1 - e^{a} ] / [ 2 cosh a ]

But 1 - e^{a} is -(e^{a} - 1 )

So,

= - (e^{a} - 1 ) / ( 2 cosh a )

But e^{a} - 1 = 2 sinh (a/2 ), and cosh a = 2 cosh^2 (a/2 )

Hmm, perhaps substituting that in.

But perhaps it's getting too complicated, and perhaps I should proceed to evaluate the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option F is 0.

Option D is -ε N.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of the average energy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the average energy per particle is negative, but the system's internal energy is negative.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option F: Internal energy is zero.

Option D: Internal energy is -ε N.

So, which is correct?

Wait, let me think again: each particle can be in either state, so for N particles, the internal energy is the sum of their energies.

So, the internal energy U = sum_{i=1}^N E_i.

Each E_i is either +ε or -ε.

So, for the entire system, the number of +ε and -ε particles can vary.

But the problem statement doesn't specify the number of particles in each state, so we have to consider all possible N.

But perhaps the average internal energy per particle is negative, but the total internal energy could vary.

Wait, but the options don't give a formula for the total internal energy. They give formulas for the internal energy of the system, which is the sum of each particle's energy.

Hmm, but perhaps the internal energy is the sum of each particle's energy, so if each particle can be in either state, then the average is as I calculated.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me recalculate the average.

The average energy per particle is:

E_avg = ε [ (1 - e^{2a} ) / (1 + e^{2a}) ) ]

Which can be written as:

E_avg = - ε tanh( a )

Because [1 - e^{2a} ] / [1 + e^{2a} ] = - tanh a.

So,

E_avg = - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

Hmm, but that would imply that the average energy per particle is negative.

But this seems odd because each particle can't have negative energy on average.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation again.

Wait, let me think about the average energy again.

Each particle can have energy +ε or -ε.

The average energy is the sum of the energies of each particle divided by the number of particles.

So,

E_avg = [ (+ε) * P_+ + (-ε) * P_- ] / N.

= [ ε (P_+ - P_- ) ] / N.

Which is same as ε (P_+ - P_- ) / N.

But P_+ - P_- = [1 - e^{2a} ] / (1 + e^{2a} )

Which is [ (1 - e^a)(1 + e^a) ) ] / [ (1 + e^a)(e^{-a} + e^a ) ) ]

Cancel (1 + e^a ) terms.

Leaves (1 - e^a ) / (e^{-a} + e^a )

Which is (1 - e^a ) / (e^a (e^{-a} + e^{-a}) ) )

Wait, 1 + e^a = e^a (e^{-a} + e^{-a} ) )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that [1 - e^{2a} ] / [1 + e^{2a} ] = - [ e^{2a} - 1 ] / [ e^{2a} + 1 ].

And [ e^{2a} -1 ] / [ e^{2a} +1 ] = tanh a.

So,

[1 - e^{2a} ] / [1 + e^{2a} ] = - tanh a.

So,

E_avg = ε ( - tanh a ) = - ε tanh( a )

With a = ε/(k T).

So, E_avg = - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

So, the average energy per particle is negative.

Hmm, but this would imply that for each particle, on average, it's in the -ε state, but that's only possible if the system as a whole has a negative internal energy.

But looking at the options, option F is zero, and option D is -ε N.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: Internal energy = -ε N.

Because, the average per particle is -ε tanh( ε/(k T) ), but the total internal energy is N times that, which would be option D.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, earlier I found that the average per particle energy is E_avg = - ε tanh( ε/(k T) )

But the internal energy is U = N * E_avg.

So, U = N * ( - ε tanh( ε/(k T) ) )

Which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

The options are:

A) ε N e^{ε/(k T)}

B) -ε N e^{ε/(k T)}

C) ε N e^{-ε/(k T)}

D) -ε N

E) ε N

F) 0

So, option D is -ε N.

Option F is zero.

So, from our calculation, the internal energy is N * E_avg, where E_avg is - ε tanh( ε/(k T) ), which is option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but wait a moment. I think I made a mistake in the calculation of E_avg.

Because the internal energy is the sum of all the energies, so for each particle, it's either +ε or -ε.

So, let me denote the number of particles in the +ε state as N_+ and in the -ε state as N_-.

So, the internal energy U = N_+ ε + N_- (-ε ) = ε (N_+ - N_- )

But the total number of particles N = N_+ + N_-.

So, the average internal energy per particle is U / N = (N_+ - N_- ) / N.

But for the entire system, the number of +ε and -ε particles can vary.

But the problem statement doesn't specify the number in each state, so we have to assume that all particles are in either state, but we have to find the average.

Wait, but perhaps the average is independent of how many particles are in each state.

Hmm, that can't be right because the average would vary based on the number of particles in each state.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the way I computed U.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the internal energy is not N times the average per particle, but it's the sum of each particle's energy.

So, each particle's energy can be either +ε or -ε.

So, U = sum_{i=1}^N E_i = sum_{i=1}^N (± ε )

So, the average per particle is U/N = (sum (± ε )) / N.

So, that's the average.

So, from our calculation, the average per particle is -ε tanh( ε/(k T) ), so the total internal energy is U = - ε tanh( ε/(k T) ) * N.

Which is option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.

The problem involves calculating the internal energy of a system of \( N \) particles, each of which can exist in one of two energy states: \( +\epsilon \) or \( -\epsilon \). The goal is to determine the total internal energy of the system, given the options provided.

### Key Analysis

1. **Internal Energy Definition**:  
   The internal energy \( U \) of the system is the sum of the energies of all \( N \) particles. For each particle, the energy can be either \( +\epsilon \) or \( -\epsilon \). Thus,  
   \[
   U = \sum_{i=1}^N E_i = \sum_{i=1}^N (\pm \epsilon).
   \]

2. **Average Energy Per Particle**:  
   The average energy per particle \( \langle E \rangle \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N E_i.
   \]  
   Substituting the energy of each particle,  
   \[
   \langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N (\pm \epsilon) \right).
   \]  
   Since the system is not specified to have a particular number of particles in each state, the average energy per particle depends on the number of particles in each state. However, the problem asks for the total internal energy, which is the sum of the energies of all particles.

3. **Total Internal Energy**:  
   The total internal energy \( U \) is the sum of the energies of all \( N \) particles. For each particle, the energy is either \( +\epsilon \) or \( -\epsilon \). Thus,  
   \[
   U = \sum_{i=1}^N E_i = \sum_{i=1}^N (\pm \epsilon).
   \]  
   The average energy per particle is:  
   \[
   \langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \left( N_+ \epsilon - N_- \epsilon \right),
   \]  
   where \( N_+ \) is the number of particles in the \( +\epsilon \) state, and \( N_- \) is the number of particles in the \( -\epsilon \) state. Thus,  
   \[
   \langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \left( N_+ - N_- \right) \epsilon.
   \]  
   The total internal energy is:  
   \[
   U = N \langle E \rangle = \epsilon \left( N_+ - N_- \right).
   \]  

4. **Simplifying the Expression**:  
   The problem does not specify the number of particles in each state, so the average energy per particle depends on \( N_+ \) and \( N_- \). However, the total internal energy is derived from the sum of the energies of all particles. For the system as a whole, the total internal energy is:  
   \[
   U = N \langle E \rangle = N \left( -\epsilon \tanh\left(\frac{\epsilon}{kT}\right) \right).
   \]  
   Simplifying,  
   \[
   U = -N \epsilon \tanh\left(\frac{\epsilon}{kT}\right).
   \]  

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   The total internal energy \( U \) is given by the formula \( U = -N \epsilon \tanh\left(\frac{\epsilon}{kT}\right) \), which corresponds to option **D**.  

### Conclusion

The correct answer is:  
\[
\boxed{D}
