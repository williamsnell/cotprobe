Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"The Sovereign Congress of Venezuela, to which authority the people of the Republic of the New Granada have voluntarily stood by.
Considering:
1. "That united in a single Republic, the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada have all proportions and ways to elevate themselves to a higher grade of power and prosperity.
2. "That constituted in separate republics, for any more stronger the ties that these have united them, so far from taking advantages of so many advantages, they would hardly consolidate and make respect their sovereignty.
3. "That these truths, highly penetrated by superior talented men and of an enlightened patriotism, had moved the governments of both republics to convene in a reunion that the vicissitudes of wars decreed and decree the following fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia:
ARTICLE 1. The Republics of Venezuela and New Granada are from this day on united in a single one under the glorious title of Republic of Colombia….
ARTICLE 4. The Executive Power of the Republic will be vested on the President and in case of his defect a Vice President and his replacement will be appointed interimly by the acting Congress."
Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia, passed by the Congress of Angostura convened by Simon Bolivar, 1819
Source 2:
"IN THE NAME OF THE HOLY TRINITY.
TITLE 1 - Of the Empire of Brazil, its Territories, Government, dynasty, and Religion.
Art. 1. The EMPIRE of Brazil is the political association for all Brazilian citizens. These will form a free and independent nation, and will not form any other union or federation, which may cause it to lose its own Independence.
Art. 2. Its territory is divided into provinces in the form in which it currently finds itself; these may be subdivided, as is required for the good of the state.
Art. 3. Its government is a Hereditary Monarchy, constitutional, and Representative.
Art. 4. The prevailing dynasty is that of the Lord Dom Pedro I, the sitting Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil.
Art. 5. The Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire. Followers of all other religions are allowed to worship within their households, or particular houses for that intent, so long as there is nothing indicating this on the exterior of the Temple."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about political philosophy from the period around 1750-1900 CE. Hmm, the question is asking which aspect of political philosophy is best illustrated by the given sources. The options are A to D.

Let me read through the information again. There are two sources provided: Source 1 is about the Sovereign Congress in Venezuela and New Granada, and Source 2 is about the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil. Both seem to be about the structure of a monarchy and its government.

Source 1 talks about the idea that a single republic could unite two smaller ones, which is the Sovereign Congress. It mentions that unity would allow the two to elevate themselves to a higher grade of power. So, it's about unity and the idea of a united republic.

Source 2 is about the Empire of Brazil. Art. 1 says the empire is a political association for all citizens, which is free and independent. Art. 3 says it's a hereditary monarchy, which suggests a form of constitutional monarchy. Art. 4 talks about the dynasty being the Emperor, which indicates a monarchy with a dominant power structure.

So, the two sources are both discussing different forms of government structures. Source 1 is about unity and a single republic, while Source 2 is about a monarchist system with a single authority.

The question is about political philosophy in that period. The options are about different aspects. Let's look at the options:

A: Constitutions around the world decreed representative governments for their citizens. Hmm, I'm not sure. The two sources are about centralized systems, not representatives. But the question's focus is on political philosophy, not necessarily the structure, but the underlying principles.

B: Monarchs exerted a great deal of influence in their nations' governments. This seems related to the idea that monarchs have a powerful influence, which aligns with both sources. Source 1 discusses unity and central authority, which might imply that the people (or the government) exerting control is a key point. Source 2 is about the structure of the empire, which is a monarchy, so monarchs exerting influence.

C: Military dictatorships often supplanted democratic governments. I don't recall either source directly supporting or contrasting military vs. democracy. Source 1 is about unity, not military structures. Source 2 is about a monarchy, so likely a form of democracy or monarchic rule, but military reforms were a later topic.

D: Industrialization propelled societies to demand more social obligations from their governments. That's more of an economic perspective, not really about political philosophy in the sense of governance structures.

So, the two sources are about different forms of governance. The two options are B and maybe A. Option B seems to fit because both sources are about the structure of power. Source 1 is about unity of two republics, and Source 2 is about a centralized monarchy.

Wait, but the question is about political philosophy. So, political philosophy might focus on the nature of governance. For example, does it emphasize the political nature of authority, or the idea of a single sovereign?

The two sources are both about the structure of government. Source 1 is about unity, which is a form of political unity. Source 2 is about a single, centralized authority, which is a monarchical system.

Looking at the options, option B says monarchs exert influence. Both sources discuss monarchic systems, so this seems relevant.

Option A says constitutions are representative. Our sources don't seem to support that. They are about centralized systems.

So, considering the options, the best answer would be B: Monarchs exert a great deal of influence in their nations' governments.

The question focuses on political philosophy from the period 1750–1900 CE, based on two sources: one discussing the unity of two republics and the other outlining a monarchical system in Brazil. Both sources relate to the structure of governance, with one emphasizing unity and the other a centralized monarchy.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Discusses representative governments, which neither source directly addresses.
- **B**: Focuses on monarchic influence, aligning with both sources as they discuss centralized authority.
- **C**: Relates to military versus democracy, which is not supported by the sources.
- **D**: Pertains to industrialization, not relevant to governance structures.

The best fit is **B**, as both sources highlight monarchic influence in governance, reflecting the key theme of political philosophy in the period.

ANSWER: B
