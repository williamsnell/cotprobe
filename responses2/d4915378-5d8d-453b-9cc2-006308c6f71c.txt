Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a treaty called the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. I'm a bit rusty on my international law, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me some information from Article I and III. Let me see what each article says.

Article I: It mentions that Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey have declared war and are now in peace. The other side, Russia, has not declared war. They're going to stay peaceful and amicably.

Then, Article III talks about Article I's territories. The territories to the west of the line they agreed on (which was supposed to be Russia's territory) are no longer under Russian sovereignty. The line is drawn on the map as part of the treaty. The line's exact fixation will be determined by a Russo-German commission.

So, the main point is that Article III says the territories west of this line are no longer part of Russia. But what's the line exactly? The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed in March 1918. The line they agreed upon is the present-day boundary between the German and Russian Empires.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the line might be their former territories. Let me think. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was about splitting the territories into two parts: the eastern part of Germany and the western part of the Russian Empire. So, the line was between the east of Germany and the west of Russia. 

So, after the treaty, those west territories of Russia aren't part of Russia anymore. So, the territories that were north of their line are part of the German Empire, and those south are part of the Russian Empire?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me visualize it. Imagine a line that splits the map into two parts. The eastern part of the German Empire is on one side, and the western part of the Russian Empire is on the other. So, the exact line is the boundary between them. Any territory to the east of that line is part of Germany, and any territory to the west is part of Russia, but not both. 

So, that means, after the treaty, the western part of the Russian Empire is no longer under Russia. Instead, it's part of Germany. Wait, but I thought the line is east of the German Empire, so the west of it is Russia's territory. So, the territories west of the line are no longer part of Russia; they belong to the German Empire. 

Wait, that would mean the result is that the German Empire has gained a new territory, the western part of Russia. But that's not one of the options. Let me look at the options.

The options are about surrenderes or the formation of a neutral zone. The options include:

Option D says the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires. So, maybe the neutral zone is the area where neither side holds any land. But the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, as I remember, was about splitting the territories into two. The line is east of Germany and west of Russia. So, the territories to the west of the line were considered Russian, but after the treaty, those territories are now part of Germany. So, the new territories are the eastern part of Germany and the western part of Russia.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I got it wrong. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which I think is related to splitting territories, was about the Eastern part of the German Empire and the Western part of the Russian Empire. So, the line was east of Germany and west of Russia. That is, the eastern part of Germany is now part of the Russian Empire. Or wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Let me think of the actual history. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 14, 1918) was signed by the German Empire and the Russian Empire. It's part of the broader Treaties of the Congress of Berlin, which led to the partition of Germany, including the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. 

The treaty split the territories into two: the eastern part of the German Empire (now part of the Russian Empire) and the western part of the Russian Empire. So, the east of the line is Russia, and the west is part of the German Empire. But wait, no—actually, the line was east of the German Empire, meaning that the east was part of Russia, and the west was part of Germany? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the line is east of the German Empire, so to the east is the German Empire, and to the west is the Russian Empire. That would make the line east of Germany, so that the east is part of Russia, and the west is part of the German Empire. But that doesn't fit with what I thought earlier.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the line. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was about splitting the territories into two. The east was part of Russia, and the west was part of Germany. So, the line is east of the German Empire, meaning that the east is part of Russia, and the west is part of the German Empire.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think of it again. The line drawn is the east boundary. So, the eastern part of the German Empire is on one side, and the western part of the Russian Empire is on the other side. So, after the treaty, the territories to the west of the line are part of the German Empire, and the territories to the east are part of Russia. But wait, no, the line is the boundary where the territories switch. So, if the line is east of Germany, then to the west is Russia, and to the east is Germany. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to visualize. Imagine the world map. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: the line drawn was east of the German territories. So, to the east is Russia, and to the west is part of the German Empire. Wait, no. I think the line is east of the German Empire. So, the east is part of Russia, and the west is part of Germany. So, after the treaty, the territories to the west of the line (the western part of the Russian Empire) are no longer part of Russia, but are part of the German Empire.

Wait, that's not possible because the line is east of the German Empire. So, the east is part of Russia, the west is part of Germany. So, if that's the case, then the territories to the west (the western part of the Russian Empire) are now part of the German Empire. So, the result is that the German Empire has gained the western part of the Russian Empire. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, the line is west of the German Empire. So, to the west is part of Russia, and the east is part of the German Empire. So, the western part of Russia is now part of the German Empire.

Wait, but the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk is part of the Treaties of Berlin. The Treaties of Berlin led to the partition of Germany, including splitting the territories into two: the eastern part of the German Empire and the western part of the Russian Empire. So, the east was part of Russia, and the west was part of the German Empire.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the east boundary is east of the German Empire, so the east is part of Russia, and the west is part of the German Empire. So, after the treaty, the east is part of Russia, and the west is part of the German Empire. So, the result is that the German Empire's territories are now the western part of the Russian Empire. Hmm, but that would mean the German Empire is gaining a new territory.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options.

Option A: the surrender of the eastern part of the Austrian Empire to the Russian Empire. No, because the question states that the Austrian Empire's territories are no longer in conflict. So, option A is about Austria-Hungary, which isn't mentioned here.

Option B: the surrender of Bulgaria. No, because the question is about the result of Article III, which mainly affects Russia's territories.

Option C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. Wait, but after the treaty, the German Empire's territories are the western part of Russia. So, would that mean the German Empire is surrendering part of itself to the Russian Empire? Or is it the Russian Empire surrendering the German territories?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for the other side, Russia. They decided to draw the line east of the German Empire's east, so the east would be part of Russia, and the west would be part of Germany.

So, the western part of the Russian Empire (from the treaty) becomes part of the German Empire. So, the result is that the German Empire has gained the western part of the Russian Empire. So, the German Empire is now in a new territory, the western part of Russia.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says the German Empire surrender to Russia's western part. Let me look.

Options:

C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. Hmm, but no, the German's territories are now part of Russia. So, perhaps the Russian Empire is surrendering the German territories to themselves.

Wait, but the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was an end to Article I for the other side (Russia). So, the line was drawn, and the territories were split. Now, the question is what's the result of Article III.

Wait, Article III says that the territories lying to the west of the line (which was east of the German Empire) are no longer under Russian sovereignty. So, the west of the line is part of the German Empire, and the east is part of Russia.

So, the result is that the German Empire's territories are now part of the Russian Empire. So, their territories are now part of Russia.

Wait, then the question is about the surrender of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires.

Wait, what's a neutral zone? It's a zone where neither side holds any territories. So, in this case, maybe after the treaty, the territories that were split into two are now between them, so the neutral zone is the area between their territories.

Wait, no. Because the territories are split into two: the east is part of Russia, and the west is part of Germany. So, the east (which is east of the line) is part of Russia, and the west (the part where the line is) is part of the German Empire. So, the area between them is a zone where both have territories. But that's not a zone where one has land and the other doesn't; it's just the line. Maybe the neutral zone is the area between their territories.

Wait, perhaps the neutral zone is the part that's neither part of Russia nor the German Empire. But in the Treaty, the territories were split, so perhaps the neutral zone is the area that was split, which is the line itself. But the line is east of the German Empire, so the area between the German Empire and Russia is the neutral zone.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk were about splitting the territories. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 14, 1918) ended Article I for Russia, meaning that Russia's territories were split into two: the east of the line (which was east of the German Empire) and the west of the line (which was part of the German Empire). So, the east part is Russia, and the west part is German.

Wait, but that would mean that the east is part of Russia, and the west is part of Germany. So, that's the split. Now, the result of Article III is that the territories to the west of the line (the western part of the Russian Empire) are no longer under Russian sovereignty. So, the Russian Empire loses that part, and it's part of the German Empire.

So, the result is that the German Empire gains the western part of the Russian Empire. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct answer. Because the line is the boundary, and the neutral zone is the area between them. So, the territories to the west of the line are part of the German Empire, and the east is part of Russia. So, the neutral zone is the area in between, which is the line itself, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the neutral zone refers to the area that was split. So, perhaps the line itself is the zone between the two Empires, but that's not land. Wait, no, the line is a boundary, so perhaps it's the area that's not part of either's territory.

Wait, maybe the result is that the German Empire has a new territory, the western part of Russia, but that's not listed. Looking back at the options:

Option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires.

Hmm. Or another option is Option B, which says the surrender of the west part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. But the result is the German's territories are part of Russia, so perhaps the German lost that part.

Wait, perhaps the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk resulted in the merger of the German and Russian Empires. No, that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, another angle: The Treaties of Berlin led to the end of Article I for Russia, so the territories were split. Then, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for the other side (Germany) and divided the territories again.

Wait, perhaps the result is that the territories are split again. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, I think the correct answer is that the German Empire gained the western part of the Russian Empire. But looking at the options, that's not there. Option D is about a neutral zone. Alternatively, perhaps the result is that the German Empire's territories are now the west of Russia, which would mean that the German Empire has lost that part, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the line. Maybe the line was east of the German Empire, so that the east is Russia, and the west is the German Empire. So, the west part is part of the German Empire.

So, the result is that the German Empire's territories are now the western part of Russia. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire.

No, because the result is the German's territories are now part of Russia.

Wait, perhaps the result is that the German Empire's territories are now the west of the Russian Empire. But the options don't have that.

Another approach: The Treaties of Berlin led to the partition of Germany, and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk further divided it. The result is that the territories to the west of the line are now part of the German Empire, and the east is part of Russia.

So, the German Empire has gained the western part of Russia. But looking at the options, that's not present. So, the options must have the correct one.

Looking again, the options are:

A: The surrender of the eastern part of the Austrian Empire to the Russian Empire. No, because the question is about the result of Article III.

B: The surrender of Bulgaria. No.

C: The surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. Hmm, does the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk result in the German's territories being part of Russia? Or is the Russian losing that part?

Wait, the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for Russia, so Russia's territories were split. The line was east of the German Empire. So, the east is Russia, the west is German. So, the result is that the German's territories are part of Russia. So, the German Empire's territories are now part of Russia.

So, does that mean that the German Empire is surrendering part of itself (the west) to Russia? But the options don't have this. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me recheck.

Option C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. That would mean the German's western territories are now part of Russia. But I thought that the German's territories were part of Russia, not surrendering them.

Alternatively, perhaps the result is that the German Empire's territories are now the east part of Russia, and the Russian Empire's territories are the west part. But that would mean the German's territories are being converted to Russia. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the result is that the German Empire lost a part of itself (the west) and was converted to Russia, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the German Empire's territories are now neutral with the Russian Empire, which would be option D.

Wait, another thought. The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for the other side (Russia), meaning that Russia's territories were split. The result is that the territories to the west of the line are no longer under Russia's sovereignty. So, that's the German Empire.

But the options don't have that. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the German Empire's territories are now the eastern part of Russia. So, the result is that the German Empire's territories are the east, which is part of Russia. So, the German Empire is no longer in a separate territory but part of Russia.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me see what the options are again.

Options:
A: the surrender of the eastern part of the Austrian Empire to the Russian Empire
B: the surrender of Bulgaria
C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire
D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires
E: the surrender of Austria-Hungary to the German Empire
F: the surrender of the eastern part of the German Empire to the Austrian Empire
G: the establishment of a joint Russo-German control over the western part of the Russian Empire
H: the surrender of the eastern part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire
I: the surrender of the eastern part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire
J: the surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire

Wait, I think I need to get this straight. The Treaties of Berlin led to the split of Germany. The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk further split the territories. The result is that the territories lie east of Russia (so, the eastern part) are part of Russia, and the western part is part of the German Empire.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think of the result as the German Empire acquiring the western part of Russia. So, the result is that the German Empire is now in a new territory, which is the western part of Russia.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. But according to our analysis, the German Empire is now part of Russia's territory, not surrendering it.

Wait, perhaps the result is that the German Empire's territories are now the eastern part of Russia, and the Russian Empire's territories are the western part. So, the neutral zone is between them, which would be the line itself. But the line is east of the German Empire, so the area between the German Empire and Russia is a zone where both have territories.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires. Because the line is the boundary, and the neutral zone is the area that's neither part of Germany nor Russia. But in reality, the line is east of Germany and west of Russia, so perhaps the neutral zone is the area in between, but that's just the line itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the result is that the German Empire's territories were split, and the entire territories between the two Empires are the neutral zone. So, that would be option D.

Wait, I'm not sure. Another angle: The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for the other side (Russia), meaning that Russia's territories were divided. The result of that was that the territories to the west of the line are now part of the German Empire, and the territories to the east are part of Russia.

So, the German Empire has acquired the western part of Russia. But in the options, I don't see that. Let me see the options again.

Option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires. Hmm. So, the neutral zone is the area that's neither part of Germany nor Russia.

Wait, that's not possible because the area between them is land. So, perhaps the neutral zone is the line itself, which is not part of either's territory. But the line is east of Germany, so perhaps the area between is the neutral zone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the result of the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk. They ended Article I for the other side (Russia), meaning that Russia's territories were split. The result was that the territories to the west of the line (which was east of Germany) were part of the German Empire, and the territories to the east were part of Russia.

So, the result is that the German Empire has acquired the western part of Russia. However, none of the options state that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires.

Wait, perhaps the result is that the German Empire has a new territory, the western part of Russia, and the Russian Empire has a new territory, the eastern part of Germany. So, the neutral zone is the area that was split, which is the line between them. But that's not a zone where one has land and the other doesn't, it's just the line.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the German Empire has a new territory, the western part of Russia, which is a neutral zone because the line is the boundary where neither has land. But the line is east of Germany, so the area between the German Empire and Russia is a zone where both have land.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the line with the neutral zone. The neutral zone is the area that was split, which is the line itself. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the neutral zone is the area between the two Empires, which is the line itself.

But looking at the options, none of them exactly say that. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: the surrender of the eastern part of the Austrian Empire to the Russian Empire.

No, because the question is about Article III.

B: the surrender of Bulgaria.

No, not relevant.

C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire.

Wait, but according to the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk, the German Empire's territories were no longer under Russia's sovereignty. So, the German Empire's territories are now part of Russia. So, the result is that the German Empire's territories are now part of Russia, meaning the German Empire has lost that part, which would be a surrender. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the German Empire has surrendered part of itself to the Russian Empire.

But looking at the options, option C says the German's western part is surrendered to Russia. But according to the Treaties, the German's territories were part of Russia. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the German's territories are now part of Russia, which would be a surrender of the German's territories, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of the result of the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk as the following:

The territories to the west of the line (which was east of Germany) are now part of the German Empire, and the territories to the east are part of Russia.

So, the result is that the German Empire has acquired the western part of Russia.

But looking at the options, I don't see that. So, perhaps the answer is that the German Empire's territories are now the east part of Russia, which would mean that the German Empire has lost the part that was part of Russia.

Wait, no. The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for the other side (Russia), meaning that the territories were split. The result was that the territories to the west of the line (the western part of the Russian Empire) are no longer under Russian sovereignty but are now part of the German Empire.

So, the result is that the German Empire has acquired the western part of the Russian Empire, which would be a surrender of the German's territories. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong and the correct answer is that the German Empire's territories are now the east part of Russia. So, the result is that the German Empire gained a new territory, the east part of Russia. So, the correct answer would be that the German Empire's territories are now part of Russia, but the options don't have that.

Looking back, the only option that makes sense is Option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires.

Wait, perhaps the result is that the German and Russian Empires have created a neutral zone between them, which is the line itself. So, the line is a zone where neither has land, hence the neutral zone.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk resulted in the merger of the German and Russian Empires into a single entity, which would be a neutral zone between them.

But I don't think that's the case. The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk led to the partition of Germany, not to the merger with Russia.

Wait, another approach: The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for Russia, meaning that Russia's territories were split. The result was that the territories to the west of the line were part of the German Empire, and the territories to the east were part of Russia.

So, the result is that the German Empire has acquired the western part of Russia. So, the correct answer should be that the German Empire has acquired that part, but this is not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the German Empire lost that part to the Russian Empire, which would be option C.

Wait, but according to the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk, the German Empire's territories were part of Russia, not surrendering them. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the German Empire's territories are now the east part of Russia, which would mean that the German Empire has lost part of itself to Russia. So, the correct answer would be option C.

But according to the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk, the German Empire's territories are no longer part of Russia, but rather part of Russia. So, perhaps the result is that the German Empire has lost the part that was part of Russia, hence surrendering it, which would be option C.

So, given that the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk resulted in the German Empire's territories being part of Russia, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Because the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk ended Article I for Russia, which would mean that the territories were split, so the result was that the territories to the west of the line (the western part of Russia) are no longer part of Russia's territories but are part of the German Empire.

So, the correct answer is that the German Empire's territories are now the western part of Russia, which would be a surrender of the German Empire to Russia.

Wait, but according to the Treaties, the result is that the German Empire's territories are part of Russia, not surrendering. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the German Empire has established a neutral zone between itself and Russia.

Wait, perhaps the result is that the German Empire has established a neutral zone, meaning the line itself, which is the boundary where neither has land. So, the neutral zone is the area that was split, which is the line itself.

So, the correct answer is option D: the establishment of a neutral zone between the German and Russian Empires.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.
</think>

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ended Article I for Russia, led to the splitting of the territories. The line drawn was east of the German Empire and west of Russia. The result was that the territories to the west of the line (the western part of Russia) were no longer under Russian sovereignty but were now part of the German Empire. This means that the German Empire acquired the western part of Russia, which is a surrender of the German Empire to Russia. 

Among the given options, the correct answer is **C: the surrender of the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire**. This option aligns with the result of the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk, where the German Empire's territories were no longer under Russian sovereignty but were now part of Russia. 

ANSWER: C
