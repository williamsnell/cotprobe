Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question is: Which of the following statements is not true?

The options are A to E. Let me list them out:

A: Nuts and seeds are deficient in lysine.
B: Legumes are deficient in methionine.
C: Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein.
D: Dairy products are rich source of tryptophan.
E: Cereals are deficient in lysine.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my nutrition, but I'll try to recall what I know.

Starting with option A: Nuts and seeds are deficient in lysine. Wait, I remember that nuts and seeds are often high in protein. Lysine is an amino acid, and I think some plants provide it. Nuts and seeds have triterpenes, which do contain lysine. So I'm pretty sure A is true. So A is not the incorrect statement.

Option B: Legumes are deficient in methionine. Methionine is a crucial amino acid. Legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, have lots of methionine. So B must be true, making it not the incorrect option.

Option C: Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein. Wait, vegan diets are people who eat a plant-based diet, so they don't eat animal products. But plant-based foods like grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables do provide protein. So if a vegan eats plant-based, they should be fine. But wait, some plants provide protein, but others might not. Wait, no, the question is about deficiency. So if vegan, they don't eat animal proteins. But do plant-based foods provide enough protein? I think they do, because legumes and grains are plant-based and provide protein. So C says they are deficient. I'm not sure. Maybe some plant-based foods have less, but generally, I think they're fine. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is wrong because vegan diets are not deficient, but the option says they are. Hmm. Wait, let me think again. No, if you eat plant-based, you are not deficient. So statement C says they're deficient. So is it true or not? Wait, option C says, "Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein." If they're not deficient, then this statement is false. So that might make C the incorrect statement.

Option D: Dairy products are rich source of tryptophan. Tryptophan is a proteinogenic amino acid, and dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are rich in it. So D is true.

Option E: Cereals are deficient in lysine. Cereals are grains, like wheat, rice, oats. They do have triterpenes, which include lysine. So E is true.

So let's go back to option C. The question is whether vegan diets are deficient in protein. I think that's not correct. Vegan diets don't eat animal-based proteins, but plant-based foods do provide protein. So the statement in C is that vegan is deficient, which would be incorrect. So C is the statement that is not true.

Wait, but waitâ€”is there any reason a vegan diet might be deficient? Like, maybe they have a lot of plant-based protein, but do they lack it? I don't think so. So statement C says they are deficient. So the incorrect statement is C.
</think>

The correct answer is C: Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein. vegan diets do not lack protein; instead, they rely on plant-based foods that do provide protein. Therefore, the statement that vegan diets are deficient in protein is not true.

Answer: C
