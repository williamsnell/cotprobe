Question:

On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. If the mother asserts a wrongful death action against the doctor, she will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.
B: not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.
C: not prevail, because the hospital, not the doctor, is responsible for the errors of its employees.
D: prevail, because the doctor had a duty of care to ensure the correct blood type was administered.
E: prevail, because the doctor's failure to follow the hospital's rules indirectly led to the father's death.
F: not prevail, because the doctor did not personally administer the wrong blood type.
G: not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.
H: not prevail, because the doctor gave correct instructions to the nurse.
I: prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.
J: prevail, because the doctor should have ensured that the nurse followed the hospital's rule for blood transfusion orders.

Okay, so I need to figure out this legal question. Let me read it carefully.

So, a father carved a turkey on Thanksgiving Day and seriously cut his hand. The doctor treated him and ordered a blood transfusion because his blood type was A-positive. However, the blood bank messed up, sending B-positive instead. The father died. The mother is suing the doctor for wrongful death, and I need to determine if she'll prevail.

The question is about the doctor's responsibility regarding the blood bank's errors. The options are about the doctor's duty or the hospital's responsibility.

Hmm. So the key points are:

1. The doctor ordered a blood transfusion, but the blood bank made an error.
2. The blood bank sent the wrong blood type.
3. The father died because he didn't receive the right blood.

The mother is suing the doctor for wrongful death. So the question is whether the doctor is liable because he didn't follow the hospital's instructions, even though the doctor knew about the hospital rule.

Wait, but the doctor was aware of the hospital's written rule. So did he have a duty to follow it?

I think the doctor's duty would be to follow the hospital's written rules because the rule is part of the doctor's job. For example, doctors are expected to follow hospital procedures. So if the doctor ordered a blood transfusion, he must have followed the written rule.

But in this case, the hospital's rule says orders must be made in writing by the physician's charge. So the doctor followed that rule. However, the hospital's employees might not have followed it because they're not the physician's charge.

Wait, the doctor was aware of the hospital's written rule. The doctor himself was the physician, I assume. So the doctor must have followed the hospital's written rule. But the hospital's employees might not have followed it because the physician isn't the one who wrote the order.

So if the hospital's blood bank made an error, but the doctor followed the rule, does the doctor have a duty to follow the hospital's rule, or only the physician?

Wait, in medical procedures, especially blood transfusions, the physician's charge is responsible for the order. So if the doctor, being the physician, must make the orders in writing. But the hospital's employees might not have followed that because they're not the physician's charge.

In this case, the doctor's instruction was to the nurse to order A-positive blood. The blood bank sent B-positive. The father died because he didn't get the right blood.

So the hospital's error led to the wrong blood being transfused. But the doctor's instructions were correct. So if the doctor didn't follow the hospital's written rule, that would be a problem because the rule was part of his duty. But since the doctor knew about the rule (as he was aware of it), he should have followed it.

Wait, but the doctor's written rule was part of his job. So if he ordered a blood transfusion, he must have followed the hospital's written instructions. He did, but the bank messed up.

But the question is about whether the doctor is liable for the blood bank's error. The issue is whether the hospital's error (in the blood bank) is a matter of the hospital's own negligence or if the doctor's actions are what caused the problem.

So the key is: was the doctor's duty to follow the hospital's written rule? If so, then the error in the bank's order would have been a mistake on the hospital's part. But the doctor was following the rule.

Wait, but the hospital's written rule says orders must be in writing by the physician's charge. So the physician must make the order in writing. So the doctor did that, but the bank messed up. So the blood bank's mistake was their own. The doctor is liable because he followed the rule, but the blood bank's mistake is an error within the hospital, not the doctor's.

Wait, but the question is whether the doctor is liable for the blood bank's error. The doctor's intent was to follow the rule. So if he did, but the bank messed up, that's a mistake on the bank. The doctor's actions were correct, but the hospital's error still counts against him.

Alternatively, maybe the doctor's failure to follow the rule is a breach, but the rule is part of his duty. So he should have followed it, so he's not liable.

Wait, but the doctor's instruction was to order A-positive. The blood bank sent B-positive, but the doctor's instruction was correct. So if the doctor followed the rule, then his duty is met, and he's not liable for the blood bank's error.

Alternatively, perhaps the blood bank's error is a mistake in their own handling, not the doctor's. The doctor's duty to follow the hospital's written rule is separate from the hospital's error.

So if the doctor followed the rule (he did), then it's not his fault, and he's not liable for the blood bank's mistake.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In medical professions, the physician's charge is responsible for all orders. So if the doctor, being the physician, made the blood transfusion, he must have followed the hospital's written rule. He did. But the blood bank made a mistake in the order.

So the blood bank's mistake is a mistake within their own handling. The doctor's actions were correct. So the blood bank's error isn't on the doctor's duty, but merely a mistake in their own process.

So the doctor is not liable for the blood bank's error because the error was in the bank's handling. The doctor's duty was to follow the rule, which he did, so he isn't liable.

Wait, but the question is whether the doctor is liable for the wrong blood transfusion. The blood bank's order was wrong. The doctor, knowing the rule, followed it. So the doctor's actions were correct, but the blood bank's mistake is a mistake, not his duty.

So the blood bank's error is an error within the hospital, not the doctor's. Therefore, the doctor is not liable for the blood bank's mistake.

So the mother is suing for wrongful death, so the doctor's duty to follow the rule is what's causing the problem. But since the doctor followed the rule, the blood bank's mistake isn't his fault.

Wait, but the question is whether the doctor is liable. If the blood bank's mistake is an error within the hospital, then the doctor is not liable because he didn't make a mistake in his own order.

Alternatively, the doctor's mistake isn't his fault because he followed the rule. So if he did, he's not liable for the blood bank's error.

But the options are about whether the doctor is liable.

Looking at the options:

Option G says: not prevail, because the doctor did not personally administer the wrong blood type.

Wait, maybe I should think about it another way. The doctor was following the rule, so he's not liable. The blood bank's error is a mistake, but the doctor's duty to follow the rule was correct.

Therefore, the blood bank's mistake is not on the doctor's fault. So the father's death was due to the wrong blood transfusion, not the doctor's error.

So the mother's claim would not prevail because the doctor followed the hospital's rule, so he isn't liable for the blood bank's mistake.

Wait, but the doctor did follow the rule, so he's not liable for the blood bank's error. Thus, the correct answer is that the doctor is not liable, and the wrong blood type was administered by the blood bank, not the doctor.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be G: not prevail, because the doctor did not personally administer the wrong blood type.

Wait, but the doctor's instruction was to order A-positive. The blood bank sent B-positive. The father died because he didn't get the right blood.

So if the doctor had followed the rule, he was supposed to order A-positive, but the blood bank messed up.

Wait, but the doctor's instructions were correct. The blood bank made a mistake.

So the blood bank's mistake is their own. But the doctor followed the rule, so he's not liable for the blood bank's error.

Wait, but the question is whether the doctor is liable for the wrong blood type. The blood bank made a mistake. So the blood type was wrong.

The doctor's duty to follow the rule is met. So if the blood bank messed up, that's an error in their own handling, not the doctor's.

Therefore, the doctor is not liable for the blood bank's mistake. The father died because he received the wrong blood, not because the doctor made a mistake.

Thus, the mother's lawsuit would not prevail because the doctor didn't make the wrong decision; the error was elsewhere.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer would be G: not prevail, because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood.

Wait, but the doctor did follow the rule, so the blood was A-positive, which was wrong. So the father's death was because he got B-positive, which was wrong.

So the doctor followed the rule, so he's not liable for the blood bank's mistake.

So the answer would be that the doctor isn't liable, so the mother's claim doesn't prevail. So the correct option is G: not prevail because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood.

But wait, the options are:

G: not prevail, because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood type.

So if the doctor did follow the rule, which he did, then it's not his fault. So the mother's claim is wrong because the blood was wrong, not the doctor.

Therefore, the mother is wrong, and the doctor isn't liable for the blood bank's mistake.

So the correct answer is G: not prevail, because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood type.

Wait, but the doctor delivered the wrong blood. So the blood was incorrect. The doctor's action was correct, but the mistake was in the blood bank.

So the father died because the wrong blood was given. The doctor didn't make the mistake, so he isn't liable.

So the mother's claim would not succeed, and the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, maybe the doctor's instruction was correct, so the blood was delivered correctly, but the blood was wrong. Wait, no. The doctor said to take A+, but the blood was B+. So the mother is claiming the doctor's mistake.

Wait, but if the doctor followed the rule, his mistake was in the blood type, not in the order.

Wait, the doctor was supposed to order A+ blood. The blood bank messed up, so sent B+. So the blood was wrong. The mother is claiming the doctor's mistake.

But the doctor followed the rule, so he wasn't wrong in the order, just in the blood type.

Wait, but the doctor's instruction was to take A+, so if he did that, the blood was correct, but the blood bank messed up.

So the blood was wrong. So the mother's claim is that the doctor made a mistake, but the doctor did the right order. The actual mistake was in the blood bank.

So the doctor isn't liable for the blood bank's error. Therefore, the mother's claim isn't correct. So the father's death was due to the wrong blood, not the doctor.

So the correct answer is option G: not prevail, because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood type.

Wait, but the doctor was following the rule, so he did administer the correct blood type. The mistake was elsewhere. So the blood was wrong, and it's not the doctor's fault.

Therefore, the mother's claim is not valid because the doctor didn't make the wrong blood; the blood was wrong and the doctor didn't handle it.

So the conclusion is that the doctor isn't liable, so the mother's claim isn't prevail. The correct answer is G: not prevail, because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood type.

Wait, but the doctor's instruction was to order A+. The blood was B+. So the blood was wrong. The father died because he didn't get the correct blood. So the doctor didn't make the mistake; the blood was wrong.

So the mother is wrong, and the father's death was due to the wrong blood, not the doctor.

So the correct answer is G: not prevail, because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood type.

Wait, but the doctor did administer the correct blood type. Or did he? Let me check.

The doctor's instruction was to order A+. He did that, but the blood bank messed up, so the blood was B+. So the blood was wrong. So it's not the doctor's fault.

Thus, the mother is wrong, so the mother doesn't prevail. So the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around whether the doctor is liable for administering the wrong blood type to the father, leading to his wrongful death. The key points to consider are:

1. **The Doctor's Duty**: The doctor, as the physician, was required by the hospital's written rule to order blood transfusions in writing by the physician's charge. The doctor performed this correctly, ordering A-positive blood.

2. **The Blood Bank's Error**: However, the blood bank made an error, sending B-positive blood instead. The blood bank's mistake is an error within the hospital's own handling, not the doctor's responsibility.

3. **The Father's Death**: The father received the wrong blood type (B-positive instead of A-positive), leading to his death. The mother is suing the doctor for wrongful death.

4. **Liability Analysis**: The doctor was negligent in following the hospital's written rule, but this was not the cause of the father's death. The error was in the blood bank's handling, not the doctor's actions. The blood was wrong, not the doctor's fault.

5. **Conclusion**: The doctor's duty to follow the hospital's written rule was met, so he is not liable for the blood bank's mistake. The father's death was due to the wrong blood, not the doctor.

The correct answer is **G: not prevail, because the doctor did not administer the wrong blood type.**
