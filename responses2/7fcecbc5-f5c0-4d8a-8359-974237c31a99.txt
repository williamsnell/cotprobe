Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about triangle RST with points X, Y, Z on the sides. I remember that midsegments in a triangle are lines connecting the midpoints of two sides and are parallel to the third side, and their length is half of that side. 

The problem says that X is on RS, Y is on RT, and Z is on ST. Also, XY and XZ are midsegments. So, that means XY connects the midpoints of RS and RT, and XZ connects the midpoint of RS and ST. Wait, actually, no. If X is on RS, then the midsegment would be between midpoints of two sides.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. A midsegment connects midpoints of two sides. So, if X is the midpoint of RS and Y is the midpoint of RT, then XY would be a midsegment. Similarly, if X is the midpoint of RS and Z is the midpoint of ST, then XZ would be another midsegment.

Wait, but the problem says X is on RS, Y on RT, Z on ST. So, perhaps X is the midpoint of RS, but Y and Z are other points. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.

"X is located on the side RS, Y is located on the side RT, Z is located on the side ST, and XY and XZ are midsegments of △RST."

So, XY is a midsegment, which connects midpoints of two sides. So, if X is on RS, then the midsegment would connect the midpoint of RS to the midpoint of RT. But wait, then where would Z be? Because Z is on ST. So, perhaps XY connects the midpoint of RS to the midpoint of RT, and XZ connects the midpoint of RS to the midpoint of ST. So, that would imply that X is the midpoint of RS because both XY and XZ are midsegments.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it methodically.

In triangle RST, let's label the vertices R, S, T. Points X on RS, Y on RT, Z on ST. XY and XZ are midsegments. So, a midsegment connects midpoints of two sides. So, if X is the midpoint of RS, then the midsegment from X would connect to the midpoint of RT (which would be Y) and also the midpoint of ST (which would be Z). So, that makes sense: X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST. Then, XY connects midpoints of RS and RT, and XZ connects midpoints of RS and ST.

If that's the case, then the midsegment XY is parallel to side ST and its length is half of ST. Similarly, XZ is parallel to side RT and its length is half of RT.

Given that, the length of XY is 7. Since XY is a midsegment, it's half the length of ST. So, ST must be 14. But wait, let me confirm.

Wait, no. Wait, if XY is a midsegment, then it's parallel to ST and its length is half of ST. So, XY is 7, so ST = 14. That would suggest the answer is 14, which is option H. But let me check the other given information.

The problem also says that RT is 13. Wait, RT is a side of the triangle. So, in triangle RST, RT is 13. So, that's the length of side RT, which is from R to T.

But if X is the midpoint of RS, then the midsegment XY is parallel to ST and is half its length. So, XY is 7, so ST is 14. Similarly, the midsegment XZ is parallel to RT and is half of RT. Since RT is 13, XZ would be 6.5. But the problem doesn't mention the length of XZ, except that angle YXZ is 124°. So, maybe that angle is key.

Wait, angle YXZ is 124°, which is the angle at point X between points Y and Z. So, triangle YXZ is a triangle with sides XY=7, XZ=6.5, and angle YXZ=124°. But since XY and XZ are midsegments, and we've already found ST=14 and RT=13, maybe this is a way to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. If X is the midpoint of RS, then Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST. So, XY connects midpoints of RS and RT, so it's a midsegment, thus parallel to ST and length 7. Therefore, ST is 14. So, that's straightforward.

Wait, but the problem says "XY and XZ are midsegments of △RST." So, if X is the midpoint of RS, then X is the midpoint, so Y and Z are the midpoints of RT and ST respectively. So, XY is the midsegment from midpoint of RS to midpoint of RT, so it's parallel to ST and of length 7. So, ST is 14. That seems correct.

But let me check if I'm misinterpreting X. The problem says X is on RS, but doesn't specify if it's the midpoint. If X is just any point on RS, then XY and XZ could be midsegments from other points. But the term midsegment usually refers to a segment connecting midpoints, so I think it's safe to assume that X, Y, Z are midpoints. So, XY is a midsegment, so Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST.

So, with that, XY is 7, which is half of ST, so ST is 14. So, the answer should be 14, which is option H. But I'm a bit confused because the problem says RT is 13, but if X is the midpoint of RS, then RT is 13, and the midsegment XZ would be half of RT, which is 6.5. So, given all that, the length of ST is 14, which is option H.

The problem involves triangle RST with midsegments XY and XZ. By understanding that midsegments connect midpoints and are half the length of the third side, we determine that ST is twice the length of XY, which is 14.

Answer: H
