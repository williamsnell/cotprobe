Okay, let's tackle this integral problem. Hmm, so the integral is ∫_{|z|=r} [f(z)] / [(z - z₁)(z - z₂)] dz. I remember that when dealing with complex integrals like this, especially around closed paths, the residue theorem is super useful. 

First, let me recall the residue theorem. The theorem says that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues inside the contour. So, the value of the integral will be 2πi multiplied by the sum of the residues of the function at the points inside the contour.

In this case, the function inside the integral is f(z) divided by (z - z₁)(z - z₂). So the function has simple poles at z = z₁ and z = z₂. But wait, the integral is around the circle |z|=r, which is a closed contour. The question states that z₁ and z₂ are two points in the ball B(0, r), meaning they are inside the ball centered at 0 with radius r. So both z₁ and z₂ lie inside the contour of integration.

Now, each pole inside the contour contributes a residue. For a simple pole at z = a, the residue is the limit as z approaches a of (z - a) * f(z). Here, our function is f(z)/[(z - z₁)(z - z₂)], so when we factor out the (z - z₁) and (z - z₂), each pole will have a residue of f(z₁)/(z₂ - z₁) and f(z₂)/(z₁ - z₂), respectively. 

Wait, let me think again. So for the pole at z = z₁, the residue is f(z₁) divided by the product of the other factors evaluated at z₁, which is (z₁ - z₂). Similarly, for z = z₂, it's f(z₂) divided by (z₂ - z₁). So the residues are f(z₁)/(z₁ - z₂) and f(z₂)/(z₂ - z₁). But wait, (z₂ - z₁) is the negative of (z₁ - z₂), so the second term is -f(z₂)/(z₁ - z₂).

Adding these residues together: [f(z₁)/(z₁ - z₂)] + [f(z₂)/(z₂ - z₁)] = [f(z₁) - f(z₂)]/(z₁ - z₂). Hmm, but wait, are f(z₁) and f(z₂) known? The question only states that f is bounded, but not necessarily continuous or anything else. So I can't directly compute f(z₁) or f(z₂). So perhaps the sum isn't a fixed number but depends on the specific function f.

Wait, but the question is asking for the value of the integral without knowing specific values of f at z₁ and z₂. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is zero because there are no other poles outside the contour? No, because the function is entire, meaning it's analytic everywhere, including at z₁ and z₂. So the only singularities inside the contour are the two poles, z₁ and z₂.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have a function that's a ratio of polynomials, the integral can be evaluated using the residue theorem. So let's think: the function f(z)/(z - z₁)(z - z₂) has two simple poles. The integral over |z|=r would be 2πi times the sum of residues at z₁ and z₂. But the residues are [f(z₁)/(z₁ - z₂)] and [f(z₂)/(z₂ - z₁)]. 

Wait, let me compute the sum: f(z₁)/(z₁ - z₂) + f(z₂)/(z₂ - z₁) = [f(z₁)(z₂ - z₁) + f(z₂)(z₁ - z₂)] / [(z₁ - z₂)(z₂ - z₁)].

Wait, that denominator is (z₁ - z₂)(z₂ - z₁) which is -(z₁ - z₂)^2. The numerator is f(z₁)(z₂ - z₁) + f(z₂)(z₁ - z₂) = f(z₁)(-1)(z₁ - z₂) + f(z₂)(z₁ - z₂) = (z₁ - z₂)(-f(z₁) + f(z₂)).

So the sum is [ (z₁ - z₂)(-f(z₁) + f(z₂)) ] / [ - (z₁ - z₂)^2 ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator: numerator is (z₁ - z₂)(f(z₂) - f(z₁)), denominator is - (z₁ - z₂)^2. So the sum becomes (f(z₂) - f(z₁)) / ( - (z₁ - z₂) ) = (f(z₁) - f(z₂)) / (z₁ - z₂).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this simplifies to zero. The problem is, unless f(z₁) = f(z₂), the sum won't be zero. But the question doesn't give any constraints on f(z₁) and f(z₂), just that f is bounded. So the integral could be anything, depending on f. Therefore, the integral's value can't be determined without more information about f.

But wait, that's conflicting with the question, which asks for the value of the integral, so it must be a specific answer. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the integral is zero? But I don't think so because the function has two poles, and unless f(z) is zero, the residues won't cancel each other out. Unless f(z₁) equals f(z₂), but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me consider the function f. Since it's bounded and entire, by Liouville's theorem, it's constant on the entire complex plane. So if f is a bounded entire function, by Liouville's theorem, it's constant. So f(z) = c for some constant c.

Wait, that's a key point! If f is entire and bounded, then by Liouville's theorem, it's a constant function. So f(z) = c for some constant c.

If that's the case, then f(z₁) = c and f(z₂) = c. Therefore, the residues at z₁ and z₂ are both c/(z₁ - z₂) and c/(z₂ - z₁), which are equal because (z₂ - z₁) is just -(z₁ - z₂). So each residue is c/(z₁ - z₂) and c/(z₂ - z₁) = -c/(z₁ - z₂).

Adding them together: [c/(z₁ - z₂)] + [-c/(z₁ - z₂)] = 0.

So the sum of the residues is zero, so the integral is 2πi times zero, which is zero. So the value of the integral is zero.

Wait, that makes sense now. So the integral is zero. So the correct answer is option C: 0.0.
</think>

The integral is evaluated using the residue theorem. Since f is a bounded entire function, by Liouville's theorem, it must be constant. The residues at z₁ and z₂ are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, leading to their sum being zero. Thus, the integral equals 2πi times zero, which is zero.
