Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. John has 12 marbles, each a different color. Among these, there's one red, one green, and one blue marble. The question is asking how many ways he can choose 4 marbles such that exactly one of them is either red, green, or blue.

Wait, let me rephrase that to make sure I get it. He needs to pick 4 marbles, but exactly one of those four must be either red, green, or blue. The rest must not be any of those three. So, to satisfy this condition, he has to include one of the special marbles (red, green, blue) and three marbles that are neither red, green, nor blue.

Hmm. So, first, let's figure out how many special marbles there are. There's red, green, and blue, so that's 3 marbles in total. The rest of the marbles are non-special, and there are 12 - 3 = 9 of those.

So, the strategy here is to choose 1 special marble and 3 non-special marbles. The number of ways to choose 1 special marble from 3 is C(3,1), and the number of ways to choose 3 marbles from the 9 non-special ones is C(9,3). Then, multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of ways.

Wait, let me compute those combinations.

C(3,1) is 3, because there are 3 ways to choose 1 out of 3. 

C(9,3) is calculated as 9! / (3! * (9-3)! ). Let's compute that. 

9*8*7 / (3*2*1) = 504 / 6 = 84.

So, the total number of ways is 3 * 84 = 252.

Looking at the options, I see option D is 252. So the answer should be D.

Wait, are there any other constraints I'm missing? For example, is there any restriction on the marbles being distinct beyond their colors? The question says 12 marbles of different colors, so each is unique. So, choosing different ones is allowed. So, no issues there.

Alternatively, could I have approached this another way? Let's see. The total number of ways to choose 4 marbles from 12 is C(12,4). But that's without any restrictions. But the problem requires exactly one of the four to be red, green, or blue. So, another approach could be to subtract the cases where none are special and the cases where two or more are special, but that might be more complicated.

Let me think: the total number of ways without any restrictions is C(12,4) = 495. But that's all possibilities. But we only want those where exactly one is special.

Wait, another way to compute it is: choose 1 special (3 options) and 3 non-special (9 options), which is exactly what I did before. So that's 3 * 84 = 252, which is option D.

So, I think I'm confident that the correct answer is D, 252.

The problem requires selecting 4 marbles with exactly one being red, green, or blue. There are 3 special marbles and 9 non-special marbles. The number of ways is calculated by choosing 1 special from 3 (C(3,1) = 3) and 3 non-special from 9 (C(9,3) = 84). Multiplying these gives 3 * 84 = 252.

Answer: D
