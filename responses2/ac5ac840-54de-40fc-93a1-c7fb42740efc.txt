Okay, so I have this problem here where Steve ordered some plastic cases for his baseball cards, and I need to find the volume of one case. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. So, the formula should be V = l * w * h.

The problem states each case has a length of 12 cm, width of 6.5 cm, and height of 1.25 cm. Oh wait, I should make sure I multiply them correctly. Let me write them down: 12 cm, 6.5 cm, and 1.25 cm.

So, I need to multiply 12 by 6.5 first, and then multiply the result by 1.25. Let me compute that step by step. 

First, 12 multiplied by 6.5. Hmm, 12 times 6 is 72, and 12 times 0.5 is 6. So adding those together, 72 +6 is 78. So 12 *6.5 =78 cmÂ². Wait, no, that's the area, but I'm calculating volume, so the units would be in cubic centimeters. So, moving on.

Now, multiply this 78 by 1.25. Let's see, 78 times 1 is 78, and 78 times 0.25 is 19.5. Adding those together gives 78 +19.5 =97.5. So the volume is 97.5 cubic centimeters.

Looking at the options, option F is 97.5. So that should be the correct answer.

The volume of the case is calculated by multiplying its dimensions. Using the formula \( V = l \times w \times h \):

\[
V = 12 \, \text{cm} \times 6.5 \, \text{cm} \times 1.25 \, \text{cm} = 97.5 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

**Answer: F: 97.5**
