The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion."
â€”John C. Calhoun, "South Carolina Exposition and Protest," 1828

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me about John C. Calhoun and his "protest" from 1828. The question is about what political position the language of his protest most resembles. The options are from A to J, each referring to a different political event or response.

First, I need to understand John C. Calhoun's text. The passage states that theStates have the power to decide on the infractions of their powers and to correct them. It's a statement about the division of sovereignty. The original text mentions that the General and State Governments hold their respective portions of the sovereign powers. This seems to imply that the States aren't just holding a portion but actually have the right to decide matters, which is a core idea of sovereignty.

Now, the question is about the language used in Calhoun's protest. He uses the word "protest," which is a verb that means arguing or challenging an idea. The original text uses terms like "sovereignty," "delegated powers," "General and State Governments," "judging," "influence," etc.

Looking at the options:

A: The response of the Democratic-Republicans to the Alien and Sedition Acts. I think the D-R party was against the Alien Act and supported the Compromise of 1850. They opposed the 1828 protests and were more against the New South issues.

B: The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812. The New England Federalists were in favor of the War of 1812, which was about the American Revolution. Their response would probably be more about supporting the war, not opposing it. So probably not this.

C: The response of the American colonists to the British Stamp Act of 1765. The colonists opposed the Stamp Act, which was about taxation without representation. They might have opposed the Stamp Act, but the language here seems more about the justification for their actions, not directly about their response to the Stamp Act's effect on their government.

D: The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the "Barbary pirates." The Barbary pirates were a problem in the colonies, but the Jefferson administration's response might be more about dealing with the problem, perhaps through military action. So not directly related to the protest language.

E: The response of the South to the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The Missouri Compromise was about the size of the South. The South opposed it, so their response would be more about the political issues in that area. Not directly the same as Calhoun's protest.

F: The response of the Confederacy to Lincoln's election. The Confederacy supported Lincoln, so their response would align with the ideas of the Union, not the individual's dissent.

G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act. The North avoided the Fugitive Slave Act, so their response would be about avoiding that law, but the language here is about the right of the States to decide, which isn't directly tied to any specific event.

H: The response of the Whigs to the annexation of Texas. Whigs opposed Texas being annexed, so their response would be more about their stance on the Texas issue. The language here is about the states' rights, which is a broader concept.

I: The response of Daniel Shays to the Massachusetts legislature policies in the 1780s. Shays was a writer who supported the Massachusetts Constitution. His response might be more about his views on taxation or the state's role, not directly related to the specific protests of 1828.

J: The response of supporters of Jackson to the corrupt bargain of 1824. So Jackson was a politician, and their response would be about their actions versus the corrupt bargain. The language here is about political actions and agreements, not about the states' sovereignty.

Wait, but the question is about the language of Calhoun's protest. So I'm looking for the term that appears in his text, which is about the states' ability to decide matters, like "judging" or "power."

Looking again, the passage says that the States can decide on their own, which is an essential attribute of sovereignty. The term "sovereignty" is central here. So the language used would be something that conveys this idea of states' right to make their own decisions.

Looking at the options, which one uses the concept that the States have the right to decide their own affairs. Let me think about each option.

Option G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The Fugitive Slave Act was a law that North Carolina passed, allowing slavery to be sold without a slave's consent. The North opposed this law, so their response would be more about the consequences rather than the right to decide. But I'm not sure if that's the right term.

Option C: American colonists responding to the Stamp Act. They opposed the Stamp Act, so their response would be about taxes, not about their ability to decide. So possibly not.

Option F: Confederacy to Lincoln. They supported Lincoln, so their response would be more about the Union's actions, not the individual's decision-making.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly say "the States have the right to decide." Let me think again.

Looking at the passage: "It would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy for their correction." So the right is that the States have the power to decide, which is a core part of sovereignty.

Which option refers to the States' right to decide? Option G: "The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850." The North opposed the act, perhaps because it favored slavery. But their response would be more about the consequences of the act. So maybe not the right term.

Alternatively, looking for a term in the passage. Calhoun says the states' right to decide. So looking for a term that conveys that idea.

Wait, the passage says "the states cannot be divested of their sovereignty." So the states have the right to decide, which is a principle of sovereignty.

The options: The question is about the language of the protest. The passage uses "sovereignty," which is a concept. But the options don't directly say "sovereignty." Let's see the options again.

Looking for a term that relates to the states' ability to decide, which is part of the passage. The passage says the states have the right to decide, so perhaps the answer is related to that.

Looking at the options:

Option G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act. The North opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, which allowed slavery to be sold without consent. So their response would be about the consequences or the actions they took, not about the right to decide.

Wait, perhaps none of the options match exactly. So perhaps the answer is not listed, but the options may have a term that conveys the right to decide.

Alternatively, maybe the passage is using the term "judging" in a certain way. For example, "the right of judging" is an essential attribute of sovereignty.

Looking at the options, the only one that mentions 'judging' is option A: the response of the Democratic-Republicans to the Alien and Sedition Acts. That's about the D-R opposing the new laws.

But I don't think that's the right term. The passage isn't directly about judging; it's about the states' right to decide.

Wait, the passage says, "the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former." So the states are not holding a portion but can decide on their own. So the right is that the states can decide, and this is an essential part of their sovereignty.

Looking for the term that refers to this. The options don't have a direct match, but let's think about each option's meaning.

Option G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act. The North opposed the act, perhaps because it favored slavery. So their response would be about the negative actions, not the right to decide.

Option F: The response of the Confederacy to Lincoln. They supported Lincoln, so their response would be about agreement, not the right to decide.

Option D: The response of the Jefferson administration to the Barbary pirates. They opposed the pirates, so their response would be about dealing with the problem, not sovereignty.

Option H: Whigs to the annexation of Texas. They opposed the annexation, so their response would be about the consequences.

Option J: Supporters of Jackson to the corrupt bargain. Their response would be about their actions versus a corrupt agreement.

Wait, the passage uses the concept of the states' right to decide. So perhaps the correct answer is related to that. But none of the options directly say that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act. The North opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, but their response would be about their actions, not the idea of states' right to decide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The passage is from John C. Calhoun, and in his "Protest," he refers to the states' ability to decide on their own. The term that comes to mind is "judging," but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps option H, which says the response of the Whigs to the Texas issue. The Whigs opposed Texas, so their response would be about their stance, not the right to decide.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G. Let me think again. The passage says that the states have the right to decide, which is a core part of their sovereignty. The option that refers to the states having the right to decide is perhaps option G.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The North opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, but their response was more about the consequences rather than the right to decide.

Wait, I'm confused. Let's think about the options:

The passage says that the states have the right to decide on their own, which is a fundamental aspect. So the language would be something that conveys that. The options likely refer to specific events, but the most fitting is option G.

Alternatively, none of the options directly say "the states have the right to decide," but the passage's key is that the states can decide on their own.

Looking at the options, perhaps option G is the answer. Because the North opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, which was about slavery, and their response was about the consequences of the law.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The question is which political position the Calhoun's language resembles. So the language in his protest is about the states' ability to decide. The options don't have that word, but option G is the response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act. The North opposed the act, so perhaps they would have opposed it, but the passage isn't about that.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the exact passage.

The passage says, "the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy for their correction."

So, the right is that the states can decide. So the language would be one that conveys that. None of the options directly say that, but the closest is option G, which is the response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act. It's about the consequences of the act, but the passage isn't addressing that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option G, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the correct answer is G because the passage uses the concept of the states' right to decide, and option G is about the North's stance on the Fugitive Slave Act.

Hmm, this is tricky. Another thought: perhaps the answer is G, as the North opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, but that's not directly about the states' right to decide. Alternatively, I might have to think that the passage's language is about the states' ability to decide, which is a concept not directly mentioned in the options. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is option G because the passage refers to the states' right to decide, and the options don't have that, so G is the closest fit.

The question asks which political position the language of John C. Calhoun's "protest" most resembles. The passage discusses the states' right to decide on the infractions of their powers, emphasizing the states' ability to correct issues independently, which is a core aspect of sovereignty. The options provided are analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Refers to the Democratic-Republicans' stance on the Alien and Sedition Acts, which is unrelated to Calhoun's protest.
- **Option B**: Relates to the New England Federalists' response to the War of 1812, which does not align with the specific language of the protest.
- **Option C**: Pertains to the American colonists' reaction to the Stamp Act, which is about taxes and not the states' decision-making.
- **Option D**: Connects to the Jefferson administration's response to Barbary pirates, which focuses on military actions rather than governance.
- **Option E**: Pertains to the South's response to the Missouri Compromise, which is about political issues rather than sovereignty.
- **Option F**: Refers to the Confederacy's response to Lincoln's election, which aligns with the Union's stance but not directly with Calhoun's language.
- **Option G**: The North's response to the Fugitive Slave Act. While the North opposed the act, this option does not directly reflect the states' right to decide, which is central to Calhoun's text.
- **Option H**: The Whigs' response to the Texas issue. This relates to their stance on the issue rather than the states' right to decide.
- **Option J**: The supporters of Andrew Jackson's response to the corrupt bargain. This is about political agreements rather than governance.

The passage emphasizes the states' ability to decide, which is not directly mentioned in the options. However, **Option G** (the response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act) is the closest fit, as it pertains to a specific event rather than the states' right to decide. Despite this, none of the options perfectly match the concept described in the passage. Given the analysis, **Option G** is selected as the most appropriate answer.

ANSWER: G
