Okay, so I have this problem where I need to use the divergence theorem to evaluate a surface integral. Hmm, the divergence theorem relates a surface integral over a closed surface to a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. I think the formula is something like the triple integral over the volume enclosed by S of the divergence of F dV. 

The vector field F is given as F = sin(πx) i + (zy³) j + (z² +4x) k. So, first, I need to find the divergence of F. The divergence is the sum of the partial derivatives of each component with respect to their respective variables. 

So, div F = ∂F_x/∂x + ∂F_y/∂y + ∂F_z/∂z. Let's compute each term.

F_x is sin(πx), so the derivative with respect to x is π cos(πx). 

F_y is zy³, so the derivative with respect to y is 3zy². 

F_z is (z² +4x), so the derivative with respect to z is 2z. 

Adding all these up, the divergence is π cos(πx) + 3zy² + 2z.

Now, according to the divergence theorem, the surface integral over the closed surface S is equal to the triple integral of this divergence over the volume of the box. The box is defined by x from -1 to 2, y from 0 to 1, and z from 1 to 4. So, I need to set up the integral in terms of x, y, z.

The integral becomes ∫ from x=-1 to 2 ∫ from y=0 to 1 ∫ from z=1 to 4 [π cos(πx) + 3zy² + 2z] dz dy dx.

I'll compute this step by step. Let me split the integral into three parts:

1. ∫ [π cos(πx)] dz
2. ∫ [3zy²] dz
3. ∫ [2z] dz

Wait, but the order of integration is important. The limits are x from -1 to 2, y from 0 to 1, z from 1 to 4. So, the order of integration is x, y, z. So, the first integral is with respect to z, then y, then x.

First, compute the inner integrals.

First, let's compute the integral of [3zy²] with respect to z. The integral of 3y² z dz from z=1 to 4. The integral is (3y²)(z²/2) evaluated from 1 to 4. So, (3y²)( (4²/2) - (1²/2) ) = (3y²)(16/2 - 1/2) = (3y²)(15/2) = (45/2) y².

Next, the integral of 2z dz from z=1 to 4. That's 2*(z²/2) from 1 to 4. So, (z²) evaluated from 1 to 4: 16 -1 =15. So, 15.

So, the total integral is the sum of these three parts for each x, y, and then x and y.

Wait, no. No, I think I made a mistake in the order. The triple integral is done as dz dy dx, but the integrand is already split into the three terms.

Wait, let me clarify: the triple integral is ∫ (from x=-1 to 2) ∫ (y=0 to 1) [ ∫ (z=1 to4) (π cos πx + 3zy² + 2z) dz ] dy dx.

So, for each x and y, compute the inner integral with respect to z.

Let me compute each integral step by step.

First, compute the innermost integral ∫ (z=1 to 4) [ π cos(πx) + 3 y² z + 2z ] dz.

We can integrate term by term.

∫ π cos(πx) dz from 1 to4: since cos(πx) doesn't depend on z, it's just π cos(πx) multiplied by (4-1) =3. So, 3π cos(πx).

Next, ∫ 3 y² z dz from 1 to4. As before, that's (3y²)( (z²/2) evaluated from 1 to4) = 3y²*(16/2 - 1/2) = 3y²*(15/2) = (45/2) y².

Third term: ∫ 2z dz from 1 to4: 2*(z²/2) from 1 to4 = (16/2 - 1/2) = 15.

So, the inner integral is 3π cos(πx) + (45/2) y² +15.

Now, the triple integral is this expression integrated over y from 0 to 1 and x from -1 to 2.

So, we now have to compute ∫ (x=-1 to 2) ∫ (y=0 to 1) [3π cos(πx) + (45/2) y^2 +15 ] dy dx.

We can split this into three separate integrals:

Integral over x of ∫ [3π cos(πx)] dy dx, plus ∫ [45/2 y² ] dy dx, plus ∫ [15 ] dy dx.

Compute each:

First term: ∫ (x=-1 to 2) [3π cos(πx)] dx * ∫ (y=0 to 1) dy.

Wait, no. Because the integrand is [3π cos(πx) + ... ] and y is integrated from 0 to1, but the 3π cos(πx) doesn't depend on y, so the integral over y would be 1, since it's from 0 to1.

So, first term: ∫ (x=-1 to 2) [3π cos(πx)] * [∫ (y=0 to1) dy ] dx → ∫ [3π cos(πx)] * (1) dx from x=-1 to2.

So, Integral of 3π cos(πx) dx from x=-1 to 2.

The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx).

So, 3π times [ (1/π)(sin(πx) ) ] from x=-1 to x=2.

So, 3 sin(πx) evaluated from x=-1 to 2.

At x=2: sin(2π) =0.

At x=-1: sin(-π) =0.

So, the integral is 3*(0-0)=0.

Hmm, that's zero. So the first term contributes zero.

Second term: ∫ (x=-1 to2) ∫ (y=0 to1) [ (45/2) y^2 ] dy dx.

We first integrate over y. For a fixed x, (45/2) ∫ y² dy from 0 to1. The integral of y^2 dy is y^3 /3 evaluated from 0 to1 → 1/3.

So, for each x, the integral is (45/2)(1/3) = (45)/(6) = 7.5.

Then, integrating over x from -1 to2: 7.5 * (2 - (-1)) =7.5 *3=22.5.

Third term: ∫ (x=-1 to2) ∫ (y=0 to1) [15] dy dx.

Again, integrating over y: 15 ∫ dy from 0 to1 →15 *1=15.

Then, integrating over x: 15*(2 - (-1))=15*3=45.

So, the total triple integral is the sum of these three terms: 0 +22.5 +45= 67.5.

Wait, but wait, the options are A:80.1, B:69, etc. So 67.5 is option I:67.5. But let me double-check the integrals.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of integration or in the limits. Let me re-calculate each step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the divergence as I did, and then compute the triple integral correctly. Let me go through the integral again.

So, the divergence is π cos(πx) +3 z y² + 2 z.

So, the integral is ∫_{x=-1}^2 ∫_{y=0}^1 ∫_{z=1}^4 [ π cos(πx) +3 z y² + 2 z ] dz dy dx.

Let me compute the integrals in the order of z first, then y, then x.

Compute the inner integral ∫ (z=1 to4) [3 z y² + 2 z ] dz.

Wait, wait. The integrand is 3 z y² + 2 z.

So integrating with respect to z:

Integral of 3 y² z dz = 3 y² * (1/2) z² evaluated from 1 to4 → (3 y²/2)(16-1) = (3 y²/2)(15) = 45 y²/2.

Integral of 2 z dz is 2*(1/2) z² evaluated from 1 to4 → (1)(16 -1) =15.

So, the inner integral becomes 45/2 y² +15.

Now, the integral over y from 0 to1 of (45/2 y² +15) dy.

Integrate term by term:

45/2 ∫ y² dy = 45/2 * (1/3) y³ evaluated from 0 to1 → 45/(6) (1) = 7.5.

15 ∫ dy from 0 to1 →15*1=15.

So, ∫ (y=0 to1) [ ... ] dy= 7.5 +15=22.5.

Then, the integral over x from -1 to2 of 22.5 dx. Since 22.5 is constant, the integral is 22.5*(2 - (-1))=22.5*3=67.5.

So, the total integral is 67.5, which is option I. But looking back at the options, option I is 67.5.

Wait, but the options given are:

A:80.1

B:69.0

C:60.5

D:72.3

E:91.4

F:83.7

G:58.6

H:75.2

I:67.5

J:54.8.

So, 67.5 is option I.

But wait, let me think again. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake in the order of integration. Because the divergence is being integrated over the entire volume. I think I correctly followed the order of x, y, z. So the order seems correct.

Wait, but the box is from x=-1 to 2, y=0 to1, z=1 to4. So, the limits are correct.

Wait, another possibility is that I computed the integral of the divergence as 67.5, which is option I. However, looking back, I may have made a mistake in the calculation because the divergence terms may vary with x and y. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each component's integral separately and see.

Wait, let me compute each term's integral again:

First term: ∫ [ π cos(πx) ] dz, but wait that's for the divergence. Wait, no, the divergence is already in terms of x, y, z, so the integral is as we computed.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral over x. Let me compute ∫ (from x=-1 to 2) [3π cos(πx)] dx.

The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx). So,

3π ∫ cos(πx) dx from -1 to 2 → 3π [ (1/π) sin(π x) ] from -1 to 2.

= 3 [ sin(2π) - sin(-π) ].

Sin(2π) is 0, sin(-π) is 0. So, 3*(0 -0)=0. So that term is zero.

Second term: ∫ [3 z y² + 2 z ] dz from 1 to4.

Wait, no, the second term is [3 z y² + 2 z], but in the integral, we have the first term as π cos(πx), but perhaps I should compute the integral for each component.

Wait, no, when I compute the inner integral for the divergence, I have to integrate each term separately.

Wait, the divergence is π cos(πx) + 3 z y² + 2 z. So, each term contributes to the integral.

First term: ∫ (z=1 to4) π cos(πx) dz → π cos(πx) * (4-1) =3π cos(πx).

Second term: ∫ (z=1 to4) 3 z y² dz.

3 y² ∫ z dz from 1 to4 =3 y² [ (z²/2) ] from 1 to4 =3 y² (16/2 -1/2) =3 y² (15/2) = (45/2) y².

Third term: ∫ (z=1 to4) 2 z dz = 2 [ z²/2 ] from 1 to4 → 2*( (16/2 -1/2) )=2*(15/2)=15.

So, the inner integral is 3π cos(πx) + (45/2) y² + 15.

Now, the integral over y from 0 to1. So, integrate each term:

3π cos(πx) ∫ dy = 3π cos(πx) * (1-0) =3π cos(πx).

(45/2) y² ∫ dy from 0 to1 → (45/2) * [ y^3/3 ] from0 to1 → (45/2)(1/3) =15/2.

15 ∫ dy =15*(1-0)=15.

So, the integral over y is [3π cos(πx) ] +15/2 +15.

Now, the integral over x from -1 to2.

So, ∫ (x=-1 to 2) [3π cos(πx) +15/2 +15 ] dx.

We can split this into three parts:

3π ∫ cos(πx) dx from -1 to2.

15/2 ∫ dx from -1 to2.

15 ∫ dx from -1 to2.

Compute each part.

1. 3π ∫ cos(πx) dx from -1 to2.

The integral of cos(πx) is (1/π) sin(πx). So,

3π [ (1/π)( sin(2π) - sin(-π) ) ] → 3 [ sin(2π) - sin(-π) ].

Sin(2π)=0, sin(-π)=0. So, 3*(0-0)=0.

2. 15/2 ∫ dx from -1 to2 → (15/2)*(2 - (-1)) = (15/2)*3 =45/2 =22.5.

3. 15 ∫ dx from -1 to2 →15*(3) =45.

So, adding all three parts: 0 +22.5 +45 =67.5.

So, the triple integral is 67.5, which is option I. So, the correct answer is option I:67.5.

To evaluate the surface integral $\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S}$ using the divergence theorem, we first compute the divergence of the vector field $\vec{F} = \sin(\pi x) \vec{i} + (zy^3) \vec{j} + (z^2 + 4x) \vec{k}$. The divergence is:

\[
\text{div} \, \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[\sin(\pi x)] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}[zy^3] + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}[z^2 + 4x] = \pi \cos(\pi x) + 3zy^2 + 2z.
\]

Using the divergence theorem, the surface integral over the closed surface $S$ of the box is equal to the triple integral of the divergence over the volume of the box. The box has dimensions $x \in [-1, 2]$, $y \in [0, 1]$, and $z \in [1, 4]$. The triple integral is:

\[
\int_{-1}^2 \int_0^1 \int_1^4 [\pi \cos(\pi x) + 3zy^2 + 2z] \, dz \, dy \, dx.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the inner integral with respect to $z$
The integral of $[\pi \cos(\pi x) + 3zy^2 + 2z]$ with respect to $z$ is evaluated term by term:
- $\int_1^4 \pi \cos(\pi x) \, dz = 3\pi \cos(\pi x)$,
- $\int_1^4 3zy^2 \, dz = \frac{3y^2}{2}(16 - 1) = \frac{45}{2} y^2$,
- $\int_1^4 2z \, dz = 2 \cdot \frac{z^2}{2} \Big|_1^4 = 15$.

Thus, the inner integral is:
\[
3\pi \cos(\pi x) + \frac{45}{2} y^2 + 15.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the integral with respect to $y$
The integral of the inner result with respect to $y$ is evaluated term by term:
- $\int_0^1 \frac{45}{2} y^2 \, dy = \frac{45}{2} \cdot \frac{y^3}{3} \Big|_0^1 = \frac{45}{6} = 7.5$,
- $\int_0^1 15 \, dy = 15 \cdot 1 = 15$.

Thus, the integral over $y$ is:
\[
7.5 + 15 = 22.5.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the integral with respect to $x$
The integral of the result with respect to $x$ is evaluated term by term:
- $\int_{-1}^2 3\pi \cos(\pi x) \, dx = 3\pi \cdot \left[\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi}\right]_{-1}^2 = 3[\sin(2\pi) - \sin(-\pi)] = 3(0 - 0) = 0$,
- $\int_{-1}^2 22.5 \, dx = 22.5 \cdot (2 - (-1)) = 22.5 \cdot 3 = 67.5$.

Thus, the total triple integral is:
\[
0 + 67.5 = 67.5.
\]

### Final Answer
The value of the surface integral is **67.5**, which corresponds to option **I**.
