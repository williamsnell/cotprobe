Okay, so I've got this leadership theory question here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about the HOUSE’S PATH-GOAL THEORY, which I remember is related to the characteristics of a good leader. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that according to this theory, subordinate satisfaction and motivation are maximized when they believe the leader is helping. Then it asks what type of leadership style this is, and the options are A through J.

First, I should recall what each of these theories emphasizes. I think there's something called the PATH-GOAL theory, which was proposed by Fiedler. Fiedler's theories are about how people perceive their job satisfaction and how leadership styles affect that.

The HOUSE’S PATH-GOAL theory is one of Fiedler's theories. Fiedler categorized leadership styles into different types, each with its own characteristics. The main types are:

1. Instrumental leadership: This style is about the leader's role in the organization. They're seen as the main force behind the success of the team. They're more about the role of the leader in contributing to the organization's goals, not the individual's personal growth. So, in instrumental leadership, the leader's focus is on the overall results rather than individual performance.

2. Path-positive: Here, the leader believes that the path to success is clear, and success is determined by the leader. The employees see the leader as the key to achieving the company's goals. This style is more about the company's success and the leader's emphasis on quantity over quality.

3. Path-negative: The leader thinks that success is determined by the path taken, and there are many possible paths. This style is about the flexibility and allowing employees to take different routes as long as they reach the desired outcome.

4. Path- followers: The leader's role is more about observing and supporting the team's actions, not leading them towards a specific goal. This style is more about the team's ability to perform as it is.

Now, the question states that subordinate satisfaction and motivation are maximized when the leader believes the leader is helping. So, in this theory, the leader is seen as the one helping the subordinate, and the subordinate feels this support makes them satisfied and motivated.

Looking back, the HOUSE’S PATH-GOAL theory, according to Fiedler, emphasizes that the leader is the one helping the subordinate. This style is instrumental leadership, where the leader's role is to drive the team towards organizational success, focusing on the overall goal rather than the subordinate's individual performance.

So the options are:

A: Focus on creating a positive environment. That's more about the work environment but not necessarily the leadership style.

B: Involves subordinates in decision-making. That's more about democratic decision-making, not helping.

C: Provides feedback and recognition for a job well done. This is about giving recognition, but it's more about the subordinate's self-perceived performance.

D: Encourages subordinates to work independently. That's more about autonomy than helping.

E: Challenges goals and high performance. That's more about the subordinate's performance.

F: Establishes supportive relationships. That's about relationships, not leadership style.

G: Emphasizes team building. This is about building the team, not leadership.

H: Places a high value on engagement. This is about the subordinate's satisfaction, but it's more about the overall company culture.

I: Encourages developing goals. That's about helping the subordinate set their own goals, which aligns with the theory.

J: Provides specific rules. This is about procedures, not about leadership.

So the correct answer should be I: Encourages subordinates to develop their own goals and objectives. That's because the theory is about the leader helping the subordinate, implying that the leader is supportive and believes in their development.

Wait, but I should make sure. The theory is about subordinate satisfaction and motivation being maximized when they believe the leader is helping. So the leader is the one helping, which is instrumental leadership. But in the options, the one that describes this is I: encourages subordinates to develop their own goals. Because in instrumental leadership, the leader is seen as the one guiding the team towards the company's goals, and the subordinate's satisfaction comes from feeling they are part of the team's success.

So yeah, I think I is the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **I: Encourages subordinates to develop their own goals and objectives.** 

**Explanation:**
The HOUSE’S PATH-GOAL theory, proposed by Fiedler, emphasizes that subordinate satisfaction and motivation are maximized when they believe the leader is helping. This leadership style is known as **instrumental leadership**, where the leader's role is to guide the team towards organizational success, focusing on the overall goal rather than individual performance. The theory highlights that the leader's support and encouragement of subordinates' development of their own goals align with this approach. Therefore, the correct answer is **I**, as it directly describes the characteristics of instrumental leadership.
