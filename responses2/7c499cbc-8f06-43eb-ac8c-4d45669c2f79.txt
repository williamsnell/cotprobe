Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company's revenue and cost functions, and I need to find the breakeven point and the range of units to produce to make a profit. Hmm, let's see. I remember that breakeven is when revenue equals cost, so I'll start with that.

The revenue function is R = 90√(2X), and the cost function is C = 3X + 1200. So, I need to set them equal to find X where R = C.

Wait, does that mean 90√(2X) = 3X + 1200? Yeah, that makes sense. I'll need to solve for X. But this equation looks a bit tricky because of the square root. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate it, but I have to remember that squaring can sometimes introduce extra solutions, so I need to check my answers at the end.

So, let's write it out:

90√(2X) = 3X + 1200.

Hmm, let me divide both sides by 3 to simplify. That gives 30√(2X) = X + 400. Hmm, not sure if that helps much, but maybe.

Alternatively, I could square both sides right away. Let me try that.

(90√(2X))^2 = (3X + 1200)^2.

Calculating left side: 90^2 is 8100, times (√(2X))^2 which is 2X. So, 8100 * 2X = 16200X.

Right side: (3X)^2 is 9X², and 1200^2 is 1,440,000. The cross terms: 2*(3X)*(1200) = 7200X. So, altogether, right side is 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000.

So, setting left = right:

16200X = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000.

Let's move everything to one side:

0 = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000 - 16200X.

Simplify the terms:

7200X - 16200X is -9000X.

So, equation becomes:

9X² -9000X +1,440,000 = 0.

Divide through by 9 to simplify:

x² - 1000X + 160,000 = 0.

Wait, let me check that division again. 9X² /9 is X². 9000X/9 is 1000X; 1440000/9 is 160000.

Wait, but that's not right because 1,440,000 divided by 9 is 160,000, yes.

So equation is X² - 1000X + 160000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check again.

Wait, when I squared both sides, 90√(2X) squared is (90)^2 * (2X) = 8100 * 2X = 16200X. That's correct.

And (3X +1200)^2 is 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000. Correct.

So equation is 16200X = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000.

Subtracting 16200X: 0 = 9X² + 7200X -16200X +1,440,000.

Which is 9X² -9000X +1,440,000=0. Divide by 9: X² -1000X +160,000=0.

Hmm, I can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic is X² -1000X +160,000=0.

Using the quadratic formula: X = [1000 ± sqrt(1000² -4*1*160000)] /2.

Compute discriminant: 1000² = 1,000,000. 4*1*160000= 640,000. So discriminant is 1,000,000 -640,000 = 360,000.

Square root of 360,000 is 600. So, X = (1000 ±600)/2.

So, two solutions:

X = (1000 +600)/2 = 1600/2 = 800.

X = (1000 -600)/2 = 400/2 = 200.

So the roots are X=200 and X=800.

But wait, since we squared both sides, we need to check if these are valid solutions.

At X=200: R =90√(2*200)=90√400=90*20=1800. C=3*200 +1200=600+1200=1800. So yes, 200 is a valid solution.

At X=800: R=90√(1600)=90*40=3600. C=3*800 +1200=2400+1200=3600. So that's also valid.

So the breakeven points are at X=200 and X=800.

But wait, the question is asking for the breakeven point and the range to make a profit. So, the breakeven points are at 200 and 800. So, to make a profit, you need to be either between 200 and 800, or beyond 800? Let me think.

Wait, the profit is when R > C. So, when is 90√(2X) > 3X+1200.

We found the breakeven points at 200 and 800.

For X between 200 and 800, let's pick X=500. R=90√(1000)=90*31.62≈2846. C=3*500+1200=1500+1200=2700. So 2846>2700, so profit is positive.

What about X=1000? R=90√(2000)=90*44.72≈4025. C=3000+1200=4200. So, 4025 < 4200, so profit is negative, so no profit.

Wait but wait, looking at the options, option E is 300 < X < 900. Hmm, but wait, since our breakeven points are 200 and 800, the profit is positive between 200 and 800.

Wait, but according to the quadratic, the function R - C is zero at 200 and 800, and positive between them.

But the options given don't include 200 and 800 as endpoints. So, perhaps the company's breakeven is at 200 and 800 units, and makes a profit when X is between 200 and 800.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options given are:

A: 250 < X <850

B: 100 < X <700

C:350< X <900

D:0 < X <600

E:300 < X <900

F:150 < X <750

G:200 < X <800

H: X <200

I: X >800

J:400 < X <1000

So, our solution is X must be between 200 and 800, so that would make the profit positive. But looking at the options, E is 300 < X <900, which includes 200 to 300. But our breakeven is at 200, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Are the units X the same as the breakeven point? Or does the problem have X as the number of units made, so maybe the breakeven is when exactly 200 and 800 units, but the profit is positive between them.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. The question is asking for the breakeven point, which is when R = C, and the range to make a profit. So, when R > C, which is between X=200 and X=800.

Looking at the options, option G is 200 < X <800, which matches our solution.

But the options don't include E (300 < X <900) as a breakeven. Wait, but E is an option for units to produce to make a profit, but according to the problem, the correct range is 200 to 800.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says "the last character of your answer must be the letter you have chosen." So, the breakeven is at X=200 and X=800, and the profit is when X is between 200 and 800.

But looking at the options, option G is 200 < X <800. So that's the correct answer for the breakeven point and the range to make a profit.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "how many units to produce (in terms of an inequality) to make a profit." So, the range is 200 < X <800, which is option G.

Wait, but let me look back at the options. Option G is 200 < X <800, which is correct.

So the correct answer should be option G: 200 < X <800.
</think>

The breakeven point is where revenue equals cost, which occurs at X = 200 and X = 800. To make a profit, revenue must exceed cost, which happens when 200 < X < 800. This corresponds to option G.
