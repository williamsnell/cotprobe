Okay, so I've got this question here about a machinist's labor cost. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says the machinist spent 23 and a half hours working on a part. His pay rate is $3.90 per hour. I need to find the total cost of his labor for the part.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to convert 23 and a half hours into a decimal because I usually work with decimals for calculations. Let me think, 0.5 hours is half an hour. So 23.5 hours is the total time worked.

Next, I remember that to find the total pay, I multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate. So it's 23.5 hours multiplied by $3.90 per hour. Let me write that down: 23.5 * 3.90.

Wait, do I need to do any calculation here? Let's think about how to multiply these numbers. Let me break it down. 

Maybe I can separate 23.5 into 23 and 0.5 to make it easier. So, 23 * 3.90 plus 0.5 * 3.90.

Calculating 23 * 3.90 first. Let me do 23 * 3 = 69, and 23 * 0.90 = 20.70. Adding those together, 69 + 20.70 gives 89.70.

Then, the 0.5 part: 0.5 * 3.90 is 1.95.

Now I add the two results together: 89.70 + 1.95. Let me do that addition. 89.70 plus 1 is 90.70, plus 0.95 is 91.65. So the total cost is $91.65.

Looking at the options, option D is $91.65. So the answer should be D.

The total labor cost is calculated by multiplying hours worked by the hourly rate. 23.5 hours Ã— $3.90 = $91.65. 

Answer: D: $91.65
