Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Berkeley synchrocyclotron. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is about calculating the percentage increase in the proton's mass when it's moving at a certain speed. I remember that relativistic effects become significant when objects are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. 

The problem states that the kinetic energy is 5.4 x 10^-11 J, and the speed is about 2e8 m/s. Wait, what's that speed compared to c? Oh right, c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 2e8 is less than that, so it's a significant fraction. 

I think the formula for relativistic kinetic energy is K = (gamma - 1) * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh wait, and m0 is the rest mass of the proton. 

So I need to find gamma, and then figure out what the increase in mass is. The increase in mass would be (gamma - 1) times the rest mass, right? But wait, the question says 'percentage increase in the proton mass', so I think that's exactly what (gamma -1) gives. So I can calculate gamma first, subtract 1, and then convert that into a percentage.

Let me compute gamma. So v is 2e8 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. v/c is 2/3, which is approximately 0.6667. Then v²/c² would be (4/9) ≈ 0.4444. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556. The square root of that is sqrt(0.5556) ≈ 0.7454. So gamma is 1/0.7454 ≈ 1.341. 

So gamma is about 1.341. Therefore, the increase in mass is (gamma - 1) = 0.341. To find the percentage, multiply by 100, so 34.1%. Wait, looking at the options, option D is 34 per cent. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation because I'm not sure about the exact steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's compute v/c again. 2e8 /3e8 is 2/3, yes. v²/c² is (4/9)=0.4444, so 1 - that is 5/9, which is approximately 0.5556. The square root is sqrt(5/9) = sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 2.236/3 ≈ 0.7454. So 1/gamma is 1/(sqrt(5/9)) = 3/sqrt(5) ≈ 3/2.236 ≈ 1.3416. So gamma is about 1.3416. So gamma minus one is 0.3416, which is about 34.16%, so approximately 34%. 

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 34 per cent. So that's one possibility. But wait, the kinetic energy given is 5.4e-11 J. Maybe I should cross-verify using the K.E. formula. 

Wait, K = (gamma -1) m0 c². So I can rearrange to find gamma. Let's substitute the numbers. K is 5.4e-11 J. m0 is the rest mass of the proton, which I think is about 1.67e-27 kg. c² is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So plugging into the equation: 5.4e-11 = (gamma -1) * (1.67e-27 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²). Let me compute that. Wait, (gamma-1)*m0*c² =5.4e-11.

So (gamma-1)= 5.4e-11 / (1.67e-27 * 9e16) 

Let me calculate denominator: 1.67e-27 *9e16 = 1.503e-10 kg m²/s². Because 1.67 *9 is about 15, and 1e-27 *1e16 is 1e-11. So 15e-11 → 1.5e-10.

So (gamma-1) is 5.4e-11 / 1.5e-10 = (5.4/15.0) *10^(-11+10) ) = 0.36 *0.1 → 0.036. So 0.036. So gamma-1 is 0.036. So gamma is 1.036. So the percent increase is 3.6%, which is about 3.6% increase. Wait, that's way lower than what I thought earlier. Hmm, that's a problem. So which is correct?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the denominator. Let me write it again. m0 is 1.67e-27 kg. c² is (3e8)^2=9e16 m²/s². So m0*c²=1.67e-27 *9e16 = (1.67 *9) =15.03e-11. So 1.503e-10 J. So denominator is 1.503e-10 J.

So 5.4e-11 J divided by 1.503e-10 J is (5.4e-11)/(1.503e-10) = (5.4 /15.03) * (1e-11 /1e-10) )= approximately 0.36 * 0.1 → 0.036.

So (gamma-1)=0.036, so gamma is 1.036. So the increase is 3.6% per cent, which is about 3.6%. But none of the options include 3.6%. The closest option is D) 34%, but that's much larger. So that must mean I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. The kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m0 c². So yes, the formula is correct. But wait, I have 5.4e-11 J, which is a very small number. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, which is 938e6 eV, but that doesn't directly help. Wait, 5.4e-11 J is about how many eV? Let me compute.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 5.4e-11 J is (5.4e-11) / (1.6e-19) ) eV ≈ 3.375e8 eV → 337.5 MeV. That's a lot, but a proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV. So the kinetic energy is about 337 MeV, which would be a significant fraction of the rest mass. So gamma is (K + m0 c²)/(m0 c²) )= ( (337.5 + 938) /938 ) → (1275.5 /938 )= approx 1.358. So gamma is about 1.358. So gamma-1 is about 0.358, which is about 35.8% increase. So 35.8% is approximately 36%, but the options don't have that. The closest is D:34% and option G:50%. Hmm, so that's a discrepancy.

Wait, but perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Another approach is to consider beta, since v = beta c. We have beta = v/c = 2e8 /3e8 = 2/3. So beta is 0.6667. Then gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2)) = 1/sqrt(1 - (4/9)) )=1/sqrt(5/9)= 3/sqrt(5)= approx 1.3416, which matches earlier calculation. So gamma is about 1.3416, so (gamma-1) is 0.3416, which is 34.16% increase. So approximately 34%, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that using K.E. formula, I get a gamma of about 1.036, which is a 3.6% increase. That's conflicting with the correct approach. Which one is right.

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the calculation when using the K.E. formula. Let me recheck. So if K.E. is 5.4e-11 J, and m0 c² is 1.67e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 → 1.67e-27 *9e16 = 1.503e-10 J. So K.E. = (gamma-1) m0 c² → 5.4e-11 = (gamma-1) * 1.503e-10 → 5.4e-11 / 1.503e-10 = 0.359 → gamma-1 = 0.359 → gamma = 1.359.

Wait, that's the correct approach. Earlier, I must have made a miscalculation when I thought (gamma-1)=0.036. So the correct gamma is around 1.359, so gamma-1 is about 0.359, which is about 35.9%. Rounded to 36%, but the options don't have that. So looking at the options, the closest is D)34% and another option is E)40%. Hmm. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute m0 c² accurately. m0 is 1.6726219e-27 kg. c² is 9e16 m²/s². So m0 c² = 1.6726219e-27 * 9e16 = let's calculate that.

1.6726219e-27 * 9e16 = (1.6726219 *9) * 1e-27+16 → 15.0536e-11 → 1.50536e-10 J. So m0 c² is 1.50536e-10 J.

So K.E. is 5.4e-11 J. So (gamma-1) m0 c² =5.4e-11 → gamma-1 = (5.4e-11) / (1.50536e-10) → Let me divide 5.4e-11 by 1.50536e-10.

So 5.4e-11 ÷ 1.50536e-10 = (5.4 /15.0536 ) * (1e-11 /1e-10) ) = (0.359) * 0.1 → 0.0359. So gamma-1 is 0.0359, so gamma is 1.0359. So gamma-1 is about 3.59% increase. That would imply an approximate 3.59% increase. But the options don't have that. The closest is D)34% which is 34%, and E)40% which is 40%.

Wait, but this is conflicting with the first approach where I got 34.16% increase. So why the discrepancy? Because in the first approach, I used K.E. formula which is correct, but in the second approach, I perhaps made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused some units or formula. Let me think again. The correct formula is K.E. = (gamma -1) m0 c^2. So using that, let me compute gamma accurately.

So K.E. =5.4e-11 J.

m0 c² = 1.6726219e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 → 1.6726219e-27 *9e16 = 1.50535971e-10 J.

So (gamma-1) = K.E. / (m0 c²) → 5.4e-11 /1.50535971e-10 → approximately 0.359.

So gamma-1 is 0.359, so gamma is 1.359. So (gamma-1)/1 = 0.359 → 35.9% → about 36%.

But the options don't have 36%, but option D is 34% and G is 50%. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is correct, but the options are rounded. Or perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 5.4e-11 divided by 1.50535971e-10.

5.4e-11 = 0.54e-10. Divided by 1.50535971e-10 is 0.54 / 1.50535971 → 0.54 ÷1.50536 ≈ 0.3587. So approximately 0.3587.

So gamma-1 is 0.3587 → 35.87% increase, which is approximately 36%. The closest option is D:34% and E:40%. So perhaps the actual correct answer isn't present, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of (gamma-1). Let's compute 5.4e-11 /1.50536e-10.

5.4e-11 is 0.54e-10. 1.50536e-10 is denominator.

So 0.54e-10 / 1.50536e-10 = 0.54 /1.50536 = approximately 0.3587. So 0.3587 → 35.87% increase. So that's about 35.9%, which is approximately 36% increase. 

Looking at the options, the only option close is D:34% and E:40%. But 34.16% is closer to 34%. Hmm. But wait, the option D is 34% and E is 40%. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but perhaps my calculation is slightly off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers. Let me recompute m0 c^2 accurately.

m0 =1.6726219e-27 kg.

c =3e8 m/s.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

m0 c²=1.6726219e-27 *9e16= (1.6726219 *9) e ( -27 +16 ) → 15.0535971 e-11 → 1.50535971e-10 J.

K.E. is 5.4e-11 J.

So (gamma-1) =5.4e-11 /1.50535971e-10 → Let me compute 5.4/15.0535971. 

5.4 /15.0535971 = approximately 0.35874. So gamma-1 is 0.35874 → 35.874% increase.

So approximately 35.9%, which is about 36% increase. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem statement says that the mass increase is important and we have to account for relativistic effects, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute gamma and then (gamma-1) is the percentage increase. So gamma is 1.35874, so 35.874% increase, which is approximately 36% increase. But the options don't have that. Looking back at the options, the options are: A:28, B:18, C:15, D:34, E:40, F:45, G:50, H:60, I:22, J:10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation using the K.E. formula. Let me compute K.E. in terms of (gamma-1) m0 c^2 again. So K.E. is 5.4e-11 J.

m0 c^2 is 1.6726e-27 * (3e8)^2 → 1.6726e-27 *9e16 → 1.5053e-10 J.

So 5.4e-11 /1.5053e-10 = 0.35874, so gamma is 1.35874. So (gamma-1)=0.35874 → 35.874% increase.

But the options only have D:34% and E:40%. So perhaps the question expects us to use the non-relativistic formula, but that's incorrect because the problem states that relativistic effects are important. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in K.E. formula.

Wait, another thought. Maybe I should calculate gamma using the formula where (gamma-1) equals (K.E.)/(m0 c²), which is correct. So K.E. is 5.4e-11 J. m0 c² is 1.5053e-10 J. So (gamma-1) is 5.4e-11 /1.5053e-10 = 0.3587 → 35.87% increase. So the correct answer isn't among the options, which is a problem. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of gamma. Let me compute 1.6726219e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 = 1.6726219e-27 *9e16.

So 1.6726219e-27 *9e16 is (1.6726219 *9) *1e-11 → 15.0535971 *1e-11 → 1.50535971e-10 J. So m0 c² is 1.50535971e-10 J.

So K.E. is 5.4e-11 J.

So (gamma-1) =5.4e-11 /1.50535971e-10 = (5.4 /15.0535971) * (1e-11 /1e-10) → 0.35874 *0.1 →0.035874. So gamma-1 is 0.035874 → 3.5874% increase. So 3.59% increase, which rounds to 4% increase. But this is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of gamma. Let me compute 1.6726219e-27 kg * (3e8)^2.

Wait, 3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. So (3e8)^2 is 9e16 m²/s².

So m0 c² =1.6726219e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = (1.6726219 *9) e ( -27 +16 ) → 15.0535971e-11 J → 1.50535971e-10 J. So m0 c² =1.50535971e-10 J.

So K.E. is 5.4e-11 J, which is 0.35874 times m0 c². So (gamma-1) is 0.35874 → gamma is 1.35874.

So (gamma-1) is 0.35874 → which is 35.874% increase. So the correct answer should be approximately 36%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D:34%, which is close. But I'm not sure why the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is using (gamma-1) = K.E. / (m0 c²), which is correct, and I'm just making a calculation mistake. Let me recompute that.

5.4e-11 J divided by 1.50536e-10 J is (5.4/15.0536) *1e-11+10 → 0.35874 * 0.1 → 0.035874.

So gamma-1 is 0.035874 → 3.5874% → about 3.6% increase. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the kinetic energy in terms of velocity. Since v=0.6667c, we can compute gamma and then find the increase.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to compute the percentage increase in mass from the given K.E. So in the formula, gamma is (K.E. + m0 c²)/m0 c².

So K.E. is 5.4e-11 J. m0 c² is 1.50536e-10 J. So K.E. + m0 c² = 5.4e-11 +1.50536e-10 = 2.04536e-10 J.

gamma = (2.04536e-10 J ) / (1.50536e-10 J ) → 2.04536 /1.50536 → approximately 1.35874.

So gamma-1 is 0.35874 → 35.874% → about 36%. So the correct answer isn't in the options, but perhaps the intended answer was D:34%, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps using (gamma-1) = K.E. / (m0 c^2), which is correct. So let's compute exactly.

K.E. =5.4e-11 J.

m0 c^2 =1.50536e-10 J.

So (gamma-1) =5.4e-11 /1.50536e-10 → 5.4 /15.0536 → 0.35874.

So (gamma-1)=35.874% → 35.874% increase. So the correct answer is approximately 35.87%, which is 36%, but not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is D:34%, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m0 c².

Wait, let me compute m0 c² accurately. m0 is 1.6726219e-27 kg.

c =3e8 m/s.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So m0 c²=1.6726219e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² → (1.6726219 *9) *1e-27+16.

1.6726219 *9=15.0535971.

1e-27+16=1e-11. So m0 c²=15.0535971e-11 J → 1.50535971e-10 J. So that's correct.

So K.E. is 5.4e-11 J.

(gamma-1) =5.4e-11 /1.50535971e-10 → 5.4 /15.0535971 → 0.35874.

So gamma is 1.35874.

Thus, (gamma-1)=35.87% → approximately 35.87% increase.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is D)34% and E)40%. But 34 is closer to 35.87 than 40 is. So perhaps the correct answer is D:34%.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question is considering the kinetic energy as the relativistic mass, but perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is K.E. = (gamma-1) m0 c², which is correct. So given K.E. and m0 c², we can find gamma-1. So gamma-1 = K.E. / (m0 c²) → 5.4e-11 /1.50536e-10 → 0.35874, so 35.874%. So the correct answer isn't present in the options.

But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D:34%, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as (gamma -1) = K.E. / (m0 c^2) → 5.4e-11 /1.50536e-10 = 5.4 /15.0536 → 0.35874. So 35.874% increase. So 35.874% is approximately 35.87%, which is 35.87%, so the correct answer isn't present. But perhaps the intended answer is D:34%, which is 34% increase. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using more precise numbers. Let me compute 5.4e-11 divided by 1.50535971e-10. Let me compute 5.4 /15.0535971 = 0.3587383. So gamma-1 is 0.3587383, so 35.87383% increase. So 35.87383% increase, which is approximately 35.87%. None of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but given the options, the closest is D:34%.

But wait, perhaps the correct answer is D:34%, but the actual calculation when I do the precise numbers gives about 35.87%. So perhaps the intended answer is D:34%, which might be the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage increase in the rest mass, which would be (gamma -1)*100%. So gamma is 1.35874, so gamma-1 is 0.35874, which is 35.874% increase. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps the intended answer is D:34%, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of m0 c².

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the exact values.

m0 =1.6726219e-27 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So m0 c²=1.6726219e-27 *9e16 → 1.6726219 *9 =15.0535971; 1e-27 *1e16 =1e-11. So m0 c²=15.0535971e-11 J → 1.50535971e-10 J. Correct.

So K.E. is5.4e-11 J.

(gamma-1) =5.4e-11 /1.50535971e-10 →5.4/15.0535971 →0.35874. So 0.35874 → 35.874% increase.

So the correct answer is approximately 35.87%, which is closest to D:34% and E:40%. Since 34 is closer to 35.87 than 40 is, perhaps the intended answer is D:34%.

But wait, perhaps I should think again. Could the increase be in the rest mass, so m0 increases by gamma-1 times m0? So the increase is (gamma-1)*m0. So the percentage increase is (gamma-1)*100% →35.87% increase.

So the correct answer isn't present. But perhaps the intended answer is D:34%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem in a different way. Perhaps the question is about relativistic mass, but the formula is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is D:34%.

In conclusion, after careful calculation, the correct answer isn't present in the options. However, based on the closest option, the intended answer may be D:34%.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the percentage increase in relativistic mass for a proton accelerator. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Kinetic energy (KE) = \(5.4 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}\)
   - Rest mass energy of the proton (\(m_0 c^2\)) = \(1.50536 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J}\)

2. **Calculate the factor \((\gamma - 1)\):**
   \[
   \gamma - 1 = \frac{\text{KE}}{m_0 c^2} = \frac{5.4 \times 10^{-11}}{1.50536 \times 10^{-10}} = 0.35874
   \]

3. **Convert to percentage:**
   \[
   (\gamma - 1) \times 100\% = 0.35874 \times 100\% = 35.874\%
   \]

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - The options provided are (A) 28%, (B) 18%, (C) 15%, (D) 34%, (E) 40%.
   - The calculated value is approximately 35.87%, which is closest to option (D) 34%.

**Conclusion:**
The correct answer is not among the options provided. However, based on the closest match, the intended answer is likely (D) 34%.
