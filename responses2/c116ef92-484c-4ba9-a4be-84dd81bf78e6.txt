Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about Gestalt therapy and transference. Let me see... I remember that Gestalt therapy is a type of therapeutic process that focuses on the client's internal experiences and feelings, often through various techniques like dream work. 

The question asks what the last character (the letter) of the answer must be. The options are A to I and F. The options describe different interpretations or outcomes related to transference in Gestalt therapy. 

Transference in Gestalt is about the client's projection of their thoughts, feelings, and desires onto others, right? I think in the context of therapy, especially with dream work, transference is about the client bringing their hidden desires or fears into the therapeutic environment. 

Looking at the options, option F says "considered a sign that therapy is progressing favorably." That makes sense because in many therapeutic approaches, including Gestalt, transference is seen as a positive outcome as it helps the client understand and address their internal struggles, which can contribute to their overall development and healing.

Other options: A talks about投影（projection）the therapist's issues, which doesn't really fit. B says it's ignored, but I think it's not ignored; it's a significant aspect. C suggests it's a fantasy for the client, but transference isn't a fantasy but a real occurrence. D talks about deepening the relationship, which is more about therapy approaches like CBT, not Gestalt. E says it's regression (going back), but transference isn't regression; it's a way to explore. I doesn't fit; the client isn't seen early. G mentions it's for the patient, which isn't the case. H refers to dream work, but transference is a broader concept in Gestalt. 

So, F seems to be the best fit. It correctly describes transference as a positive outcome in therapy. The last letter is F, so the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: "Considered a sign that therapy is progressing favorably." 

Answer: F
