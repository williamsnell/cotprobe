Okay, so I have this question about bankruptcy and the order in which bondholders, common stockholders, and preferred stockholders are paid. Hmm, I remember from my finance class that when a company goes bankrupt, it's called liquidation, and bondholders are usually paid first. But wait, what about preferred stock? I think the ranking is important here. 

I think it goes like this: bondholders first, then preferred stock, and then common stock. Because bonds are a type of security, and they have a higher priority. Preferred stock is next because it's a hybrid between equity and debt. So the order would be bondholders first, then preferred, then common. 

Looking at the options, option A says Preferred, common, bond. No, that's the reverse. Option B is bond, common, preferred. No, that's bond first, then common. Option C is preferred, bond, common â€” that's what I think. So option C seems correct.

Wait, let me make sure. In the event of bankruptcy, the order of preference is usually bondholders first because they have a higher claim than preferred stock, which in turn is higher than common stock. So the correct sequence is bondholders, then preferred, then common. So the answer should be option C.

The correct order of payment in bankruptcy is bondholders first, followed by preferred stock, and then common stock. This ranking reflects their respective claims, with bonds having the highest priority, preferred stock next, and common stock last.

Answer: C: Preferred stockholders, bondholders, common stockholders
