Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It says the density of a gaseous compound is 1.23 kg/m³ at 330 K and 20 kPa. I need to find the molar mass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

Wait, I remember that for gases, the ideal gas law applies. The formula is PV = nRT, right? But since we're dealing with molar mass, maybe I should rearrange it to find M.

Oh right! The formula is M = (mass) / (moles), but I don't know mass yet. Alternatively, I think there's a way to relate density to molar mass using the ideal gas law. Let me recall that.

Density (d) is mass divided by volume (d = m/V). Oh, but from the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. And moles (n) is mass (m) divided by molar mass (M). So n = m/M.

Putting it together, PV = (m/V) RT. Let me write that out:

PV = (m/V) RT

Multiply both sides by V: PV * V = m RT

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe rearrange the ideal gas equation to solve for m/V. Let's see: from PV = nRT, and n = m/M, so PV = (m/M) RT. Multiply both sides by M: PV*M = m RT. Then, m = (PV*M)/(RT). 

But wait, the density d is m/V. So substitute m:

d = (PV*M)/(RT) * (1/V) → d = (P*M)/(R T)

Wait, wait, that would give d = (P*M)/(R T). Because m/V is d. So rearranged: M = (d * R T) / P.

Yes, that makes sense. So the molar mass is (density * R * T) divided by pressure.

Wait, let me check the units to make sure. Density is given in kg/m³, R is in J/(mol·K), pressure in Pascals. Let me see.

Density d = 1.23 kg/m³. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). T is 330 K. Pressure P is 20 kPa, which is 20,000 Pa.

So let's plug into M = (d * R * T)/P.

But wait, the units for d is kg/m³. R is J/(mol·K) = (kg·m²/(s²·mol·K)), and P is Pa = kg/(m·s²). Let's see.

Let me compute the units:

d has kg/m³. R has (kg·m²)/(s²·mol·K). T is K (units cancel). P has kg/(m·s²).

So putting it together:

M = (kg/m³) * (kg·m²/(s²·mol·K)) * K / (kg/(m·s²))

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (kg/m³) * (kg·m²/(s²·mol·K)) * K → kg * kg * m² / (s²·mol·K) * K → kg² m² / (s² mol)

Denominator: kg/(m·s²) → kg m^{-1} s^{-2}

So overall, M = (kg² m² / (s² mol)) / (kg m^{-1} s^{-2}) ) → kg² m² / (mol) * m / kg s^{-2} ?

Wait, perhaps I should do this more carefully:

M = (d * R * T) / P

d: kg/m³
R: (kg·m²)/(s²·mol·K)
T: K
P: kg/(m·s²)

So multiplying them:

kg/m³ * (kg m²/(s² mol K)) * K → (kg * kg m²) / (s² mol) → because K cancels.

Then divide by P, which is kg/(m s²):

So M = [kg² m² / (s² mol)] / [kg/(m s²)] = (kg² m² / (s² mol)) * (m s²)/(kg) )

Simplify numerator and denominator: kg² m² * m s² / (s² mol kg) )

The s² cancels, kg² and kg leaves kg in numerator, m^3 (since m² * m = m³) in numerator, denominator is mol.

So it's (kg * m³) / mol → kg·m³/mol.

Wait, but molar mass should be in kg/mol. Let me think: kg·m³/(mol * m³) = kg/mol. Because m³ cancels.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, density is kg/m³. So when you multiply by R (which has units of J/(mol·K)), which is (kg m²)/(s² mol K), and then T (K), and divide by P (kg/(m s²)), the units should give kg/mol.

Wait, let me check:

d (kg/m³) * R (kg m²/(s² mol K)) * T (K) / P (kg/(m s²)).

So,

kg/m³ * kg m²/(s² mol K) * K → (kg * kg m²) / (s² mol) → kg² m²/(s² mol)

Divide by P, which is kg/(m s²):

So kg² m²/(s² mol) * (m s²)/(kg) → (kg² m² * m s²) / (s² mol kg * kg) ?

Wait, no. Wait, kg² m² divided by s² mol multiplied by (m s²)/(kg). So:

kg² m² * m s² / [ s² mol * kg * kg ]

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me just proceed with the calculation and then check the units.

Calculate M = (1.23 kg/m³ * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 330 K) / (20,000 Pa)

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So R is 8.314 kg·m²/(s²·mol·K). So:

d = 1.23 kg/m³
R = 8.314 kg m²/(s² mol K)
T = 330 K
P = 20,000 Pa = 20,000 kg/(m s²)

So,

M = (1.23 * 8.314 * 330) / (20000)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

First, 1.23 *8.314 ≈ let's see: 1.23 *8 is 9.84, 1.23*0.314≈0.387. So total about 10.227.

Then multiply by 330: 10.227 *330 ≈ 10.227 *300 = 3068.1, plus 10.227 *30=306.81 → total 3374.91.

Denominator is 20000.

So M = 3374.91 / 20000 → approx 0.1687 kg/mol.

Wait, 0.1687 kg/mol is about 168.7 g/mol. Oh, looking at the options, option A is 169 g/mol. That's pretty close. But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the order of operations.

Wait, R is 8.314 or 8.314? Wait, 8.314 J/(mol·K) is correct.

Wait, double-checking the calculation:

1.23 * 8.314 = let me compute more accurately. 1.23 *8=9.84, 1.23 *0.314=0.387. So 9.84+0.387=10.227.

Then 10.227 *330. Let's compute 10 *330=3300. 0.227 *330: 0.2 *330=66, 0.027*330=9. So total 66+9=75. So 3300+75=3375. So 3375. Then, 3375 /20000 = 0.16875 kg/mol.

Which is 168.75 g/mol. 

Looking at the options, option A is 169 g/mol, which is very close. So the molar mass is approximately 169 g/mol. So the correct answer is A.
</think>

To determine the molar mass of the gaseous compound, the ideal gas law is used in conjunction with the given density, temperature, and pressure. The formula for molar mass is derived as:

\[
M = \frac{d \cdot R \cdot T}{P}
\]

Where:
- \( d = 1.23 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) (density),
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} = 8.314 \, \text{kg·m}^2/(\text{mol·s}^2) \) (ideal gas constant),
- \( T = 330 \, \text{K} \) (temperature),
- \( P = 20 \, \text{kPa} = 20,000 \, \text{Pa} = 20,000 \, \text{kg/(m·s}^2) \) (pressure).

### Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula
\[
M = \frac{1.23 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 330}{20,000}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator
\[
1.23 \cdot 8.314 = 10.227
\]
\[
10.227 \cdot 330 = 3375
\]

### Step 3: Divide by the denominator
\[
M = \frac{3375}{20,000} = 0.16875 \, \text{kg/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Convert kg/mol to g/mol
\[
0.16875 \, \text{kg/mol} = 168.75 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated molar mass is approximately \( 168.75 \, \text{g/mol} \), which matches option **A: 169 g/mol**.
