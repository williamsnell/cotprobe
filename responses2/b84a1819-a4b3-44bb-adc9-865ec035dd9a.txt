Okay, so I've got this question about fats and triacylglycerols. Hmm, I remember that triacylglycerol is a major component of fats, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, triacylglycerol stands for triglyceride, right? And it's one of the three main lipid components in a cell. The question is asking about the concentration of triacylglycerols in fats. The options are various percentages, from 10% to 95%, and some below 10%.

I think I read somewhere that in organisms, like humans, the majority of lipid is triglycerides. But what percentage? Oh right, maybe around 90-95%. I've heard that in human cells, the triglyceride levels are quite high. So if the options are, say, 95-100%, that would be a high concentration. But what's the typical fraction?

Wait, another angle: if the question is about the majority of triglycerides in the body, I think it's more than 95%. Like, maybe 95-100% of triglycerides are in the cell membrane, and the rest are lipoproteins. So the answer would be B: 95-100%.

Alternatively, I've heard that the majority is around 95%, but sometimes it's a bit less. But 95-100 seems to be a standard figure. So looking back at the options, B is 95-100%.

The correct answer is B: 95-100%. This represents the majority of triglycerides, which are triacylglycerols, in the human body, particularly in the cell membrane. 

Answer: B
