Question:

Explain how density dependent controls of population occur.

Options:

A: Density dependent controls occur when the population density decreases.
B: Density dependent controls occur when the population's growth is influenced by unlimited resource availability.
C: Density dependent controls are independent of the population's size and density.
D: Density dependent controls occur when a population is limited by weather changes only.
E: Density dependent controls occur when a population's habitat changes.
F: Density dependent controls are determined by the occurrence of natural disasters, regardless of population density.
G: Density dependent controls occur when regulatory factors like predation, emigration, competition, physiological and behavioral mechanisms oppose the growth of a population as its density increases.
H: Density dependent controls occur solely due to predation.
I: Density dependent controls happen exclusively due to immigration of new individuals into a population.
J: Density dependent controls occur when a population's growth rate increases without limit as its density increases.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about population density-dependent controls. Hmm, I need to figure it out. Let me think about what I remember from biology class.

Density-dependent factors are those that affect the population size based on how many individuals are present. I think they're opposite to density-independent factors, which don't depend on population size but rather external conditions like weather.

So, the question is asking how density-dependent controls occur. The options are A to J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says density dependent controls decrease the population. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because density-dependent factors would cause the population to change based on its size. So A might be incorrect.

Option B says they're influenced by unlimited resources. No, because unlimited resources would be density-independent. So B is probably wrong.

Option C claims they're independent of population size and density. That doesn't make sense because that's exactly what density-dependent is. So C is incorrect.

Option D says controlled by weather changes only. I know that weather can influence populations, but that's more about density-dependent factors like temperature affecting various species. But the option says only weather, which is too narrow. So D is probably not the correct answer.

Option E says controlled by habitat changes. Again, habitat changes are a factor, but they're not the main density-dependent ones. So E is probably not the right choice.

Option F says determined by natural disasters regardless of density. Well, natural disasters can certainly affect population dynamics regardless of whether the population is dense or not. But I'm not sure if that's the best way to phrase it. It's a possibility but not the most comprehensive.

Option G says regulatory factors oppose growth as density increases. This sounds correct. Density-dependent factors include things like competition, predation, emigration, etc., which increase as the population grows. So G seems correct.

Option H says only due to predation. No, that's too specific. There are other factors too, like emigration or emigrants.

Option I says only due to immigration. No, that's the opposite; immigration would increase population density, which could be density-dependent if it's a limiting factor.

Option J says growth increases without limit. That doesn't make sense because typically, as density increases, factors can limit growth. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but some of the other options might be correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, option G says "regulatory factors like predation, emigration, competition, physiological and behavioral mechanisms oppose the growth of a population as its density increases." That sounds accurate. So G would be the right answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about how density-dependent controls occur. So the controls themselves are density-dependent. So the correct answer is that they occur when the control is based on the population's density. So in G, it's the regulation by these factors (like predation) that depends on the density. So the controls (the regulation) happen when factors like these are in place.

So the question is about the occurrence of these controls. So when density-dependent factors are in place, they affect the population as density increases.

So among the options, G says that these controls occur when the factors oppose growth as the density increases. So that's the correct scenario.

The other options don't fit. Like, for example, option J says growth increases without limit, which is more about unlimited resources (a D option) or something else. No, that's not the case.

So the correct answer should be G.

The question asks about how density-dependent controls occur. Density-dependent factors influence population dynamics based on population density. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because density-dependent controls do not decrease population density.
- **Option B** is incorrect because density-dependent factors are influenced by limited resources, not unlimited availability.
- **Option C** is incorrect because density-dependent controls are dependent on population size and density.
- **Option D** is incorrect because weather changes are not the sole density-dependent factors; other factors like competition and emigration also play a role.
- **Option E** is incorrect because habitat changes are not the primary density-dependent controls.
- **Option F** is partially correct but too narrow, as natural disasters can influence population dynamics regardless of density.
- **Option G** is correct because density-dependent controls are regulated by factors like predation, competition, and emigration that oppose population growth as density increases.
- **Option H** and **Option I** are incorrect as they describe density-independent factors.
- **Option J** is incorrect because population growth does not increase without limit.

The correct answer is **G**, as it accurately describes density-dependent controls occurring when regulatory factors oppose population growth as its density increases.
