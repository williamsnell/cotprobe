Okay, so I've got this accounting question about equity methods. I remember that the equity method is used when an entity has an investment in another company and it's not considered to have significant influence. But wait, what's the key here? The question says Goll Co. has a 25% interest in Rose Co and an 18% interest in Jave Co. Neither investment gives Goll significant influence. So I need to figure out which investments Goll should account for using the equity method.

Hmm, the equity method applies when the investor has significant influence. If Goll doesn't have significant influence, they don't use the equity method. Significant influence usually means controlling more than 50%, but maybe that's an exception if one of the companies is a go-to or if the other is a major player. Wait, no, the rule is typically if the investor has more than 50% control, they use the equity method. But in this case, both are under 50%, so neither should use the equity method. But wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait no. The question says neither investment gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence. So neither has significant influence. So neither should use the equity method. Because if they did, they would be using the equity method for their investment, but since they don't have significant influence, the equity method isn't appropriate. So the correct answer would be E: Neither Rose nor Jave.

But wait, let me check the options. The options are about which investment(s) Goll should account for using equity method. So the correct choice is E because they don't have significant influence, so neither investment would use equity method.

Wait, but why is option F there? Option F says both Rose and Jave unless Goll has significant influence. So if Goll had significant influence, then they would account for both. But since it's neither, it's E.

So the answer should be E: Neither Rose nor Jave.
