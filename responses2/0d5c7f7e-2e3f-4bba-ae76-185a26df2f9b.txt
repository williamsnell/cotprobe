Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about theories related to how people make choices based on values and beliefs. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs. The options are A to J, each pointing to a different theory.

First, I need to recall what each theory stands for. Let's think about them one by one.

Option A: Social Learning Theory. I remember this one is about learning through observation and imitation. Like, people learn by observing others' behaviors and then copying those behaviors. So this theory is about social interactions and behavior changing based on others.

Option B: Contingency Theory. Hmm, not sure. I think the contingency approach is more about the relationship between a person's behavior and the outcome, like positive and negative consequences. It's more about explaining why people do certain things, not necessarily the process of choice itself.

Option C: Operant Conditioning. This one is about classical conditioning where rewards are used to reinforce positive behaviors. So, like, if you get a reward when you do something, you're more likely to do it again. But does it directly deal with values and beliefs?

Option D: Evolutionary. I'm not too clear on this. Evolutionary psychology suggests that human behavior is shaped by our environment and our environment's influence. It might include theories about how we behave based on our environment, but I'm not sure if it's a standalone theory about choice based on values.

Option E: Classical. Wait, maybe this is a typo. I think it's about the contingency approach. So E might not be correct. Or perhaps it's a different theory.

Option F: Expectancy Theory. Wait, isn't Expectancy Theory part of the Classical Theory? Or perhaps F is a typo for E. I'm a bit confused here. I'll keep that in mind.

Option G: Psychoanalytic Theory. That's about exploration and understanding the unconscious, developed by Sigmund Freud. It's more about understanding the human mind and behavior, not directly about choice based on values.

Option H: Instrumental. Wait, perhaps this is a typo. Maybe it's meant to refer to something else, like Instrumentalism being part of a certain theory.

Option I: Cognitive Dissonance. That's more about how people feel when they have conflicting desires or expectations. It's a psychological concept, not a theory explaining choice behavior.

Option J: Humanistic. This rings a bell. Humanistic psychology focuses on the individual's inner lives and their relationship to the environment. It emphasizes emotional and personal growth, and values like self-love and compassion. It's about how people make choices based on their personal values.

So, putting it together: the question is about a theory where people make choices based on values and beliefs. That sounds like Humanistic theory (Option J). Because Humanistic psychology is all about the individual's self and how they develop from that, based on their values.

Looking at the other options, Social Learning (A) is about observing others, but the question is about making choices based on values, not just observing. Contingency (B) talks about behavior and outcomes, which is more about the effect than the cause. Operant Conditioning (C) is about rewards and behavior, but doesn't explain why.

Expectancy (F) is part of the classical conditioning theory, explaining how people expect outcomes and will behave to achieve them. Instrumental (H) doesn't directly address choice.

Cognitive Dissonance (I) is about feeling discomfort when there's a discrepancy between expectations and actuals, not about choice.

So the correct answer should be J: Humanistic.

The theory that aligns with the principle of people making choices based on values and beliefs is Humanistic Theory. This is because Humanistic psychology emphasizes personal development, self-love, and the relationship between an individual and their environment, focusing on the individual's inner lives and values. 

Answer: J
