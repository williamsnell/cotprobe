Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a song from the 17th century, "Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!" The lyrics mention "Rhine and Prague." I need to connect this to the context provided.

The passage says that the Winter King is related to the Holy Roman Empire, and that his empire had strongholds at places like Rhine and Prague. Also, it mentions that his armies were stationed there. So, the song is warning about his territories and where he might have been active.

Looking at the options, option B says it's about strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire. That makes sense because the song warns against going to places the Winter King would rule over or where his forces might be stationed. So, the strongholds at Rhine and Prague are places where he might be, so the narrator is advising against them.

Other options: Option E talks about victories, but the song doesn't mention military victories. Option F and G are about wealth or hidden properties, which don't fit. Option J is about a pilgrimage destination, which doesn't seem relevant here. Option A is about the empire's capital, but the song is about specific cities, not necessarily capitals. Option C is about birthplaces, which doesn't fit either. Option D is about military posts, but the song isn't directly talking about military deployments but rather the places the King would rule over. Option H is about losing territories, but the song's focus is on warned about his territories.

So, the best answer is option B. The song warns against Rhine and Prague because those are strongholds from the Holy Roman Empire, which the Winter King was likely to rule over.

The question refers to the historical context of the Winter King, specifically his strongholds at Rhine and Prague. The song warns against visiting these places because they were the locations the Winter King might have ruled over, advising against them.

Answer: B
