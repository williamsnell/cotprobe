Question:

Consider the paper Native Client: A Sandbox for Portable, Untrusted x86 Native Code by Yee et al. Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.

Options:

A: all instructions that modify segment state
B: all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32
C: all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)
D: all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the Native Client paper by Yee and the NaCl library. The question is about which x86 machine instructions a validator will always forbid in a sandboxed module. Ben Bitdiddle says that with the restrictions of the module sandboxing, the module is safe, but Ben is wrong. So I need to find out what instructions are always forbidden.

From what I remember, the Native Client acts as a sandbox for untrusted x86-native code. The idea is that the code is run in a way that's isolated from the rest of the system, so it's safe to assume that the module doesn't touch memory or execute code outside its own data area.

The question is about what instructions are always forbidden. So I'm thinking about the different types of x86 instructions and how they relate to this.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: All instructions that modify the segment state. So modifying the segment state is allowed in the module. I remember that in the Native Client, the module is designed to keep the segment state the same across runs. So modifying the segment state would mean the module is changing the environment, which might not be safe. Wait, but the question is about what the validator forbids. Since the module is supposed to be isolated, I'm not sure if modifying segment state is forbidden. Maybe it's allowed because the module is supposed to maintain the same segment state.

Option B: All loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32. So any address not a multiple of 32 is forbidden. I think that's correct. Because in 32-bit architectures, each memory address is represented by a 32-bit value, so any address mod 32 would be 0. So any load or store that writes or reads to an address not 0 mod 32 would be out of the module's code and thus forbidden. That makes sense because the module is supposed to contain only its own code, so the addresses it writes to must be within the module's data area.

Option C: All indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable). Indirect operations involve fetching an address from a register or variable and using it to perform a load or store. So if the address is in a register or variable, that's allowed. But the question is about what the validator forbids. I'm not sure if indirect operations are forbidden because if the address is in a register, the module can use that. But I think that's allowed. So if the module's data area is fixed, then any indirect access that requires an address that's not mod 32 would be forbidden. Wait, but the question is about what the validator *forbids*. So is it allowed? Or is it that the module can't access data outside its own, which would mean that any indirect access (like an indirect load or store) is allowed as long as the address is mod 32. Or is it that if the address isn't mod 32, then it's forbidden? Hmm, perhaps the module can have indirect operations as long as the target address is part of its own data, which is mod 32. So option C is not about forbidden instructions, but maybe allowed. So if the question is about what the validator forbids, perhaps option C is not the answer.

Option D: All indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable). Indirect jumps are when the instruction uses an address that's in a register or variable as the source. So in a module that's sandboxed, the module can't modify or read beyond its own data. So if an indirect jump uses an address that's not mod 32, that would be outside the module's data. So the validator (or the module's code) would have to ensure that the target address is mod 32. So perhaps any indirect jump that uses an address not mod 32 is forbidden. But I think the actual restriction is that the module can't write to or read beyond its own data. So in that case, any indirect access (like an indirect load or store) is allowed as long as the target is mod 32. Indirect jumps, though, may use an address that's mod 32, but if the source is a register or variable, then it's allowed. So the validator might not forbid indirect jumps, but rather that the module can only access mod 32 addresses. So I'm not sure if D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what is always forbidden. So Ben is wrong, so the actual forbidden instructions are more than just the segment state modification.

Wait, the question says that with these restrictions, the module is safe. So I'm looking for instructions that are always forbidden. So if the module's data area is 32-bit, then any load or store to an address not 0 mod 32 is forbidden. That's option B.

So the correct answer would be B: all loads or stores to addresses not 0 mod 32.

Wait, but option C is about indirect loads or stores. So if the module is sandboxed, does it allow indirect loads (like an indirect operation) as long as the target is mod 32? I think that's the case. So would the validator (or the module) have any restrictions on that? Or is it allowed as long as the target is mod 32?

If the module can't modify memory outside its own data area, then any indirect operation (like an indirect load or store) is allowed as long as the target address is part of the module's own data. So the target address must be 0 mod 32, but the source (like a register) can be any address in the module.

So in that case, the module is allowed to have indirect operations as long as the target is mod 32. So the validator doesn't forbid that. So option C is about indirect loads or stores, but the module is allowed to do that as long as the target is mod 32. So the forbidden instruction is the target address, not the source.

So the question is about what the validator *forbids*. So in that case, the module can't have indirect accesses to addresses not mod 32. So the validator would forbid indirect accesses if the target address is not mod 32. But the options don't have that. So the options are about what the module always forbids.

Wait, the question says "Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed." So he's wrong, meaning that validation is needed. So the module must be validated.

But the question is about what he's wrong byâ€”what instructions are always forbidden.

So the module's forbidden instructions are the ones that are outside its own data. So any load (store) that's outside mod 32 is forbidden. Also, any instruction that tries to modify the module's data would be forbidden.

So the options are:

A: All segment state modifications. Not necessarily forbidden, because the module is supposed to maintain its own data area. So if the module is modified, it could read from or write to the wrong memory. Wait, but the module is supposed to be isolated, so any modification to the module's data would be out of its own code. So modifying segment state is allowed because the module doesn't modify its own data. So A is not forbidden by the module's design, but perhaps it's allowed.

Wait, no, the module's data area is fixed. So any load or store that writes to or reads from outside the module's data area is forbidden. So any write or read to an address not mod 32.

So the correct answer would be B: all loads or stores to addresses not 0 mod 32.

Another point: the module's data is fixed, so the load and store operations must write to and read from mod 32 addresses. So B is correct.

So the question asks for instructions that the validator *always* forbids, so that the module must be validated. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

The question asks which x86 x86 machine instructions the validator always forbids in a sandboxed module, given that the module is isolated and designed to contain only its own code. Ben Bitdiddle claims that the restrictions alone make the module safe, but he is wrong, meaning validation is necessary. The correct answer must reflect the module's design constraints.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: All instructions that modify segment state**  
   The module must maintain its own data area, so modifying segment state is allowed. This is not a forbidden instruction.

2. **Option B: All loads or stores to addresses not 0 mod 32**  
   The module is designed to access only its own memory, which is 32-bit. Therefore, any load or store to an address not 0 mod 32 is forbidden. This is a correct and forbidden instruction.

3. **Option C: All indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)**  
   Indirect operations use an address from a register or variable as the source. While the target address (mod 32) must be within the module's data, the source (address in a register or variable) is allowed. Thus, this is not a forbidden instruction.

4. **Option D: All indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)**  
   Indirect jumps use an address from a register or variable as the source. Similar to indirect loads, the source is allowed, but the target address must be mod 32. This is not a forbidden instruction.

### Conclusion:
The module must forbid any load or store to an address not 0 mod 32, as this is outside its own data area. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
