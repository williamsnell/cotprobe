Question:

Two co-defendants were investment brokers at a bank. They had been employed by the bank for ten years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the bank's new manager. Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. If the co-defendants are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
B: Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
C: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.
D: Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
E: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
F: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, and only one is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
G: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
H: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
I: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, and only one is guilty of murder.
J: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about criminal law, specifically murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about two co-defendants who were investment brokers at a bank for ten years. They were fired, and they're now suing the bank for planting a bomb and getting $2 million. They went online to find info, built a bomb, and then tried to defuse it. But the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. Now, I need to figure out what the charges are for them—murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Hmm, first, I remember that in some jurisdictions, planting a bomb is considered a felony murder. So if they were committing murder by planting a bomb, they might be guilty of murder. But wait, does that mean they're also guilty of conspiracy? I'm a bit confused about whether the conspiracy is separate from the actual murder.

In conspiracy cases, usually, the conspiring individuals are held guiltless. So if they were planting the bomb as part of their own plan, their own guilt would cover the entire offense. But in this case, they were acting on behalf of the bank. Wait, they were employed by the bank, but they were fired. Did that affect their ability to commit the act of planting a bomb?

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the act of planting a bomb is considered a separate crime. I remember that planting a bomb itself is a felony, but if it's part of a larger plan, the conspiring individuals are not held responsible for the plan. So if they built the bomb as part of their own plan to plant one, their own guilt would cover the entire offense.

But in this case, they were employed by the bank. So I'm wondering if their employment led to the act of planting the bomb. But the question says they consulted the internet and then built the bomb. So maybe the planting was their own act, not directly tied to the job. Or perhaps their job led them to investigate the bank's safety, which included taking action against a possible bomb.

Wait, but the key point is whether they were part of the plan. If they were directly involved in planting the bomb, then they'd be guilty of murder. But if they were just the ones who planned the bomb, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder themselves, but the bank would be.

But wait, the question says they decided to plant the bomb as revenge. So they went to the bank and demanded the money, but the bank refused. They tried to defuse the bomb, but it exploded, killing people. So did the act of planting the bomb contribute to their own murder?

Alternatively, maybe the act of planting the bomb is a separate offense, which would be murder, and since they were responsible for planting it, they'd be guilty of murder. But whether they're also guilty of conspiracy—wait, but in some jurisdictions, conspiracy to commit murder isn't separate from murder itself. So if they are guilty of murder, they aren't automatically guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me recast it: murder is a separate crime from conspiracy. So if the co-defendants committed murder by planting a bomb, they're guilty of murder. But whether they are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder depends on whether they were part of the conspiracy. If they were the ones planting it, then they themselves weren't part of any conspiracy, but perhaps the conspiracy was the bank ignoring the security. Or maybe the bank had a security plan, but the co-defendants didn't follow it, so they're guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but the scenario says that after getting the money, they decided to plant the bomb. So perhaps the conspiracy was that the bank misunderstood the importance of security and didn't act on the information. So the co-defendants were part of the conspiracy to prevent the bomb from exploding. So if they were directly responsible for planting it, they'd be guilty of conspiracy, but the killing was accidental, not because of their actions. But wait, in this case, the killing was accidental, so perhaps the killing didn't contribute to their own guilt.

Wait, but the question is about whether they're guilty of conspiracy. So if they were part of the conspiracy plan, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder. But in this case, they were planting the bomb, which is murder, but they were part of a conspiracy plan. So they would be guilty of conspiracy, but not of murder.

Wait, but the question is about the charges. The charges are murder and conspiracy to commit murder. So each charge is separate.

Wait, but the options might involve whether they are guilty of either, both, or neither.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible outcomes.

In some jurisdictions, the planting of a bomb is considered a felony murder. So if they were guilty of murder, then they might be guilty of conspiracy. Because if the planting was part of their own plan, the conspiracy wouldn't require them to be held liable.

Wait, but some jurisdictions consider the act of planting a bomb as a separate offense, so they'd be guilty of murder, but not of conspiracy. Alternatively, if the conspiracy was part of the bank's actions, then the co-defendants were not responsible for that.

Wait, but the question states that they were employed by the bank, so perhaps their role in the bank's security was part of a larger plan. So maybe they were part of that conspiracy, meaning they wouldn't be guilty of murder themselves, only of conspiracy.

Wait, but the question is about the charges: they are charged with murder and conspiracy. So if the planting was their own act, then they'd be guilty of murder. But if it was part of a conspiracy, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder themselves, but would be guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but I need to figure out whether they were part of the conspiracy. So in the scenario, they were the ones who decided to plant the bomb as revenge. So I think that they were directly responsible for the act. Therefore, they would be guilty of murder. But the question is whether they are guilty of conspiracy.

In some cases, if the act of planting a bomb is part of a larger conspiracy, the conspiring individuals are not held responsible for their own actions. So if they were part of a conspiracy plan, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder. But in this case, the question is whether they were the ones planting the bomb, not whether they were part of a conspiracy plan.

Wait, the question says that they were employed by the bank. So perhaps their firing was part of the bank's investigation, and they went to investigate the new manager. So maybe they didn't directly participate in the bank's security measures that led to the bomb's planting. So perhaps they weren't part of a conspiracy plan.

Alternatively, perhaps the act of planting the bomb was part of their own plan, so they would be guilty of conspiracy as well as murder.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about similar cases. For example, in the case of someone planting a bomb, if they were directly involved, they'd be guilty of murder. But if they were part of a larger plan, they wouldn't be guilty of murder. But here, the question is about whether they are guilty of conspiracy. So if the act of planting the bomb was part of the conspiracy, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder. But if it was their own act, then they'd be.

Wait, but the scenario says that they were employed by the bank and were fired. So perhaps their firing led them to investigate the bank's security, and then they went to plant the bomb. So perhaps they were directly involved in the bank's security, which led to the bomb being planted.

Wait, but the question states that they were employed by the bank for ten years. So perhaps they were part of the security team. So did they plant the bomb as part of their job duties? Or was it just a personal act?

If it was part of their job duty, then they would be guilty of murder and perhaps the conspiracy. But if it wasn't, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy. (That's impossible unless the co-defendants didn't plant the bomb, which they did.)

B: Both guilty of both. That can't be right because they're different crimes.

C: Both guilty of conspiracy, not murder. So they didn't commit murder themselves, so they aren't guilty of murder.

D: Both not guilty of murder, guilty of conspiracy. Maybe they didn't commit murder, but did they commit conspiracy?

Wait, if they were part of a conspiracy, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder. So if they were part of a conspiracy, they wouldn't be guilty of murder, but they weren't guilty of conspiracy either. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but the question states that they decided to plant the bomb as revenge. So perhaps the conspiracy was that the bank didn't follow the security protocols, and the co-defendants were responsible for planting the bomb. Alternatively, perhaps they were part of the bank's security team and didn't plant the bomb, but that's not the case because the question says they did.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the planting was their own act. Let's say they were part of the bank's security team. If they were part of the team and decided to plant the bomb, then they wouldn't be guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. But perhaps if the bank didn't follow the security protocols, and the co-defendants were responsible for planting the bomb, then they would be guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but the question says they were employed by the bank for ten years, so perhaps they were part of the security team. If the bank's safety was compromised because they didn't follow the protocols, then the co-defendants might be part of the conspiracy.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to approach it differently.

In general, if someone plants a bomb, they are guilty of murder. But if they were part of a conspiracy that prevented the bomb from being planted, then they aren't guilty of murder. But in this scenario, they are part of the bank and were involved in their own investigation. So perhaps they didn't plant the bomb themselves. Alternatively, perhaps they did, but it was accidental.

But the killing was accidental. So maybe the killing didn't contribute to their own guilt.

But the question is about charges regardless of whether the killing was intentional. So even if the killing was accidental, they might still be guilty of conspiracy if they were part of the conspiracy plan.

Wait, but the options seem to suggest that the co-defendants are both guilty of both. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think that the planting of the bomb is a separate offense from murder. So if the co-defendants were directly involved, they're guilty of murder, but not of conspiracy. Alternatively, if the act was part of a conspiracy, they wouldn't be guilty of murder.

Wait, but in this case, the bank's manager was fired, which led them to investigate the new manager. So perhaps the co-defendants were involved in the bank's security, which led to the bomb being planted. So if they were part of the security team and didn't plant the bomb, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder. But the question says they did plant the bomb as revenge, so perhaps they were responsible.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the planting was their own act. So if it was their own act, then they are guilty of murder, but not of conspiracy. But the options don't have an option where only one is guilty of murder. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the act of planting the bomb was part of a larger conspiracy, so they weren't individually guilty of murder. But they were part of the conspiracy, so they weren't guilty of murder. But that doesn't align with the options.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option E says both are guilty of felony murder but neither is guilty of conspiracy. That can't be right because if the co-defendants were part of the conspiracy, they wouldn't be guilty of murder.

Option H says only the phone caller is guilty of felony murder. But that's not correct because both would be guilty.

Option F says both are guilty of felony murder, and only one is guilty of conspiracy. But if they were part of a conspiracy, they wouldn't be guilty of murder.

Wait, perhaps the key is that they were employed by the bank. So perhaps their firing led them to investigate the bank, and then they went on to plant the bomb as part of their investigation. So their own actions led to the bomb being planted. So they are guilty of murder, but not of conspiracy.

But if that's the case, then none of the options have both guilty of murder. The options are about whether they are guilty of both, or either, etc.

Wait, another thought: in some jurisdictions, the planting of a bomb is considered a felony murder. So if that's the case, they're guilty of murder, but whether they're guilty of conspiracy depends on whether they were part of a conspiracy. If they weren't, then they are only guilty of murder. But the question is about whether they are guilty of both.

Wait, but perhaps the key is that the act of planting the bomb is part of their own actions, so they are guilty of both. But that doesn't make sense because murder and conspiracy to commit murder are separate.

Wait, another approach: the bank's actions. They were the ones who fired, and perhaps they didn't follow the bank's security protocols. So the co-defendants, being part of the security team, were responsible for planting the bomb as part of the bank's investigation. So if they were part of a conspiracy plan, they wouldn't be guilty of murder.

But the question is about the co-defendants' own actions. So if they were directly involved in planting the bomb, they are guilty of murder. But if they were part of a larger conspiracy, then they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about whether they were guilty of both. So, if the act of planting the bomb was part of their own plan, they wouldn't be guilty of conspiracy. But the options don't have an option where they're guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option says.

Option E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.

But if they were part of a conspiracy, they wouldn't be guilty of murder. So if the co-defendants were part of a conspiracy, then E wouldn't be correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is that they're both guilty of conspiracy and murder, but not sure.

Wait, I think I recall that in some cases, the planting of a bomb is considered a separate offense from conspiracy. So they're guilty of murder, but not of conspiracy.

But looking at the options, none have both guilty of both. The closest is option E, which says both guilty of felony murder and neither is guilty of conspiracy. But that can't be right if they were part of a conspiracy.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that both are guilty of both. But I don't think so because they're different crimes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.

But in reality, if the act of planting the bomb was part of their own plan, then they wouldn't be guilty of murder. So perhaps the correct statement is that they are both guilty of conspiracy and not of murder. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another approach: the bank's actions. The bank was fired, which led them to investigate the new manager. So perhaps the bank didn't follow security protocols, leading to the co-defendants planting the bomb as part of their investigation. So if the bank didn't follow security, the co-defendants were part of the conspiracy. So they wouldn't be guilty of murder, but they were part of the conspiracy, so no, they wouldn't be guilty of conspiracy either.

Wait, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is that they are both guilty of conspiracy and not of murder.

But looking at the options, none have that. So I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that both are guilty of both. But that's possible only if they're both guilty of both. So the answer is E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but if they were part of a conspiracy, they wouldn't be guilty of murder. So maybe the correct answer is that both are guilty of both—no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about whether the act of planting the bomb was part of their own plan. Maybe they were part of the bank's team, and didn't plant the bomb, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, the question says they decided to plant the bomb. So if they were part of the conspiracy plan, then they are not guilty of murder, but perhaps they are guilty of conspiracy. Thus, the correct answer would be E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but that can't be right because if the co-defendants were part of a conspiracy plan, they wouldn't be guilty of murder. So option E is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the co-defendants are both guilty of conspiracy and not of murder, but that's not any of the options.

Wait, another angle: the bank's action. They were fired, so perhaps they didn't follow security protocols. The co-defendants were part of the security team. So if they were part of the security team and the bank didn't follow security protocols, then the co-defendants were part of the conspiracy. So they wouldn't be guilty of murder, but they were part of the conspiracy.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where they are guilty of conspiracy but not of murder. So the correct statement is that they are both guilty of conspiracy and not of murder. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The question is about whether the co-defendants are guilty of both charges. The options are:

A: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty. But both are guilty.

B: Both guilty of both.

C: Both guilty of conspiracy, not murder.

D: Both not guilty of murder, guilty of conspiracy.

E: Both guilty of murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.

H: Only the caller guilty of murder.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E. Because the bank's actions led them to investigate, and perhaps that led to the planting of the bomb. So if the co-defendants were part of the conspiracy, they wouldn't be guilty of murder, but the answer E says they are both guilty of both.

But that's confusing. Alternatively, if the co-defendants were the ones who planted the bomb, then they're guilty of murder, but not of conspiracy. So in that case, the answer would be C, which says both guilty of conspiracy, but weren't guilty of murder. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the co-defendants were employed by the bank. So perhaps their firing led them to investigate the manager, which is part of the bank's security. Then, perhaps they went on to plant the bomb as part of their investigation. So in that case, they are guilty of murder and part of the conspiracy. So they wouldn't be guilty of murder.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E.

Wait, I'm not confident. I think the correct answer is E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: Both guilty of felony murder, neither is guilty of conspiracy.**

**Explanation:**
1. **Murder (First Charge):** The co-defendants were directly involved in planting the bomb as part of their investigation after the bank's manager was terminated. Therefore, they are guilty of murder.
2. **Conspiracy (Second Charge):** The act of planting the bomb itself did not qualify them as a conspirator. Since there's no evidence that the co-defendants were part of a larger conspiracy plan, they are not guilty of conspiracy.
3. **Felon Murder:** The planting of the bomb is a separate offense from murder. Hence, they are guilty of felony murder.

This makes option **E** the correct choice, as it accurately reflects their guilt in felony murder and their non-guilt in conspiracy.
