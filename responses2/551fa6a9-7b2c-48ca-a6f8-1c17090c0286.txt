Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about computer architecture. The question is about what storage locations are used by both the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and the control section of a CPU.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that CPUs have a lot of components, including the ALU which handles arithmetic and logic operations. The control section manages the flow of the CPU's operations.

I think the ALU uses something called an accumulator. Oh wait, the accumulator is a register that holds the result of an operation. So the accumulator is a type of storage location. Also, in the control section, I believe there are some registers used to hold program counter, address, etc. So the registers are definitely part of this.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is Registers. That's definitely used. So both the ALU and the control section use registers. Are there any other options that might fit?

Option A is Multiplexers. Multiplexers are used in memory control, maybe for selecting data from different locations. But I'm not sure if they're storage locations themselves. They function more as switches or selectors.

Option B is Memory Cache. That's more like a storage system that's managed by a hardware cache controller. The CPU's cache is a separate component, not part of the main storage, so probably not the answer.

Option E is Buffers. Buffers store data temporarily, but they're managed by higher-level memory controllers or disk I/O, not the CPU's own storage.

Option H is Latches. Latches are used in registers to store bits, but that's more of a function in the CPU's control unit, not a storage location per se.

Option I is Accumulators. Yes, the accumulator is a register holding the result of an operation. So that's definitely a storage location.

So both ALU and control sections have the accumulator as a storage location. So the correct answer should include registers and accumulator. Wait, looking at the options, option C is Registers, which is correct for the storage locations. But the ALU also uses an accumulator, which is a type of register.

Wait, the options are single choices, but in the question, it's asking which storage location both employ. So if the question is about a single storage location, perhaps it's only the accumulator. But the question is about both ALU and control. So the answer should be that both use registers. So option C is correct because the ALU uses the accumulator, which is a register. The control section also uses registers for various purposes.

Wait, looking again at the options: the question is about both the ALU and control section using which storage location. So the storage location would be the registers. Because both the ALU and control unit use registers to store data and program state.

Looking at the options, option C is Registers. So the correct answer should be C.

The ALU and control section of a CPU both utilize registers as storage locations. These registers are essential for holding program counter, address, and accumulated results. While the ALU itself uses an accumulator, which is a type of register, the question asks for storage locations, so the correct answer is registers (Option C).

Answer: C
