Question:

An auditor decides to use the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation. The auditor should be aware that the blank form may be ineffective because

Options:

A: The auditor may have selected the wrong accounts to send the blank form to.
B: The blank form might be too complicated for the recipient to understand.
C: Accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population.
D: Accounts unconfirmed may have already been written off as uncollectible.
E: The blank form might be lost in the mail, resulting in no response.
F: All accounts do not have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation.
G: The recipient may not have the necessary information to fill the blank form.
H: Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients.
I: The blank form may be mistaken for junk mail and discarded.

Okay, so I have this accounting question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about an auditor using the blank form for positive accounts receivable confirmation and what they should be aware of because the blank form might be ineffective. The options are A to I.

Hmm, I remember that in accounting, when you confirm accounts, you might need a blank form. But sometimes, it might not work. So, why might that happen?

Let me think about what each option says. Option A says the auditor might have selected the wrong accounts. Wait, I thought that the blank form is used for confirmation, but if the selected accounts aren't the right ones, that could cause problems. Like, if you send the blank form to the wrong accounts, you might not get the correct confirmation. That makes sense because the blank form might not be tailored to the selected accounts. So A is a possible reason.

Option B: The blank form might be too complicated for the recipient. I'm not sure. Some forms can be complicated, but if it's too complicated, maybe the recipients can't understand it. But does that make the form ineffective? I'm not certain. Maybe it's a possible issue, but I'm not sure how likely it is.

Option C: Accounts actually confirmed may not be representative. Wait, no, actually confirmed accounts should be the ones that are being confirmed, they are part of the population being checked. So I don't think this is correct. The accounts confirmed would be the ones that are being confirmed, so they should represent the population. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Unconfirmed accounts may have been written off. Oh, that's a good point. If an account was written off, it wouldn't be confirmed because it's already deemed uncollectible. So the blank form might not be effective because it's missing these unconfirmed accounts. So D is a good option.

Option E: The blank form might be lost in the mail. If the blank form is lost, there wouldn't be any confirmation. So the auditor would have no way to confirm the accounts, making the form ineffective. So E is a possible issue.

Option F: All accounts have equal opportunity. I'm not sure. Maybe if some accounts are more critical, they get selected more often. But generally, each account should have an equal chance. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Recipient may not have info. If the recipient doesn't know how to fill out the form, the blank form might not be filled correctly. That could lead to errors, making the form ineffective. So G is a possible issue.

Option H: Few responses. If the form is too hard to fill out, maybe it's harder for recipients to respond, leading to fewer confirmations. So H is another possible reason.

Option I: Blank form mistaken for junk. If someone mistakenly discards the blank form, it won't show up. So I is a possibility.

So the question is asking which statement the auditor should be aware of because the blank form may be ineffective. So all these options could be issues, but the question is looking for a single correct answer.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "The auditor should be aware that the blank form may be ineffective because..." So the options are separate reasons, and the correct answer is one of them.

I think the main issues are about the form being ineffective for the selected accounts. So options A, E, D, G, H, I are all possible reasons. But the question is asking which one the auditor should be aware of.

Wait, but the question provides options from A to I, each as a possible reason. But the question is a bit tricky because it's asking which one the auditor should be aware of. So all these reasons are possible, but perhaps the most likely is D, E, or others.

Wait, the question is about why the blank form might be ineffective. So it's possible that the form is not being used correctly, leading to it being ineffective. So the possible issues are:

- If the blank form is sent to the wrong accounts (A). So if the auditor selected the wrong accounts, they might not get the correct confirmation, making the form ineffective.

- If the recipient can't understand the form (G). Probably not the main issue.

- If the blank form is lost (E). If the form is lost, the accounts aren't confirmed, so the form is ineffective.

- If the form is too complicated (B). Not sure.

- If the form is mistaken for junk (I). But that's a possibility.

- The accounts actually confirmed may not be representative (C). No, because confirmed accounts are part of the population. So C is incorrect.

- Unconfirmed accounts may have been written off (D). Yes, because if they were written off, they wouldn't be confirmed.

- Few responses may occur (H). If the blank form is too difficult, maybe fewer confirmations. So H is a possible issue.

So, the question is asking which is a reason the auditor should be aware of. So all these options could be reasons.

Looking back at the options, the question is which one the auditor should be aware of because the form is ineffective.

Wait, the question is giving a scenario where the blank form may be ineffective. So the correct answer is when the form is ineffective due to one of these reasons.

So the options are A, E, D, G, H, I.

But I'm supposed to pick the correct one.

Wait, the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So I'll have to pick the letter, but I have to pick one. Wait, the options are all A through I, but the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think differently.

The blank form is used for positive accounts, so it's for confirming accounts. The form may be ineffective if:

- It's not sent to the right accounts (A). Maybe the selected accounts are not the ones that need confirmation.

- It's too complicated (B), but maybe that's not as likely as the others.

- The blank form is lost (E) → no response.

- The form is mistaken as junk (I) → no response.

Wait, but the question is about why the form may be ineffective. So if the blank form is lost (E), then there's no response, meaning the form is ineffective because it didn't get used.

Similarly, if the form is mistaken for junk (I), same result.

If the blank form is not used at all (because the form is lost or not filled out properly), then the form is ineffective.

Wait, but which is more likely. The problem is about the form being ineffective. So the reasons are:

A: Wrong accounts sent.

E: Form lost → no response.

I: Form discarded → no response.

D: Unconfirmed accounts written off → not confirmed.

H: Few responses → if the blank form is difficult, maybe few confirmations.

G: Recipient doesn't fill correctly.

So, the question is, which of these is a reason the auditor should be aware of.

Wait, perhaps the key issue is about whether the form is being used correctly. So the options are A, E, D, G, H, I.

The correct answer is likely to be D, E, or another.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The question is, why the blank form may be ineffective. So the possibilities are:

- The accounts actually confirmed may not be representative. No, because confirmed are part of the population. So C is wrong.

- The blank form might be too complicated (B) → probably not as likely.

- The blank form may be mistaken for junk (I) → possible.

- The blank form might not be filled out properly (G) → possible.

- The blank form might be lost (E) → possible.

- The blank form might not be used (A) → possible.

- Unconfirmed may have been written off (D) → correct.

- Few responses may occur (H) → correct.

So, the correct options are D, E, I, G, H.

But the question is which of the given options is a reason.

Wait, but the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the user is to select one letter.

Wait, but the options are A to I. So which one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because if the accounts actually confirmed are not representative, then the form may not confirm them. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the form might not be filled out correctly, leading to no confirmation (G).

Wait, but the question is which of the options the auditor should be aware of because the form may be ineffective.

Looking for the possible issue, perhaps D is about unconfirmed accounts being written off, which would prevent them from being confirmed. So the blank form would be ineffective because those accounts were already written off.

Option E is about the blank form being lost, leading to no response. So the blank form is ineffective.

Option I is about the blank form being discarded. So the same as E.

Option G is about the recipient not knowing how to fill the form.

Option D is about the unconfirmed accounts being written off.

So all these are possible reasons.

Wait, but the question is presented in a way that the correct answer is likely to be one of the given options.

In accounting, when you use the blank form, it's essential that it's correctly used. So the blank form may be ineffective because:

- The selected accounts may not be the ones that need confirmation (A).

- The recipient may not know how to fill out the form (G).

- The form might be lost (E).

- The form might be mistaken for junk (I).

Wait, but the question is about why the form may be ineffective. So, the form being ineffective because it's not used correctly, which could happen if the recipient doesn't understand it, or if it's lost, etc.

So the possible reasons are A, E, I, G, D.

So the correct answer is likely one of these. But the question is which one is the best answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the blank form may not be used if the unconfirmed accounts have already been written off. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the blank form may be too complicated for the recipient, which is a possible issue.

Wait, the question is about the form being ineffective. So the right answer could be D, E, or another.

Wait, I think the main issue is that if some accounts were written off (D), the blank form would not be effective because those accounts wouldn't be confirmed. So D is a valid reason.

Option E is another reason.

But the options are separate, so each is a possible reason.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the blank form may not be effective if some accounts were written off. But the question is about why the blank form may be ineffective, so it's possible that the form is not being used correctly, leading to it being ineffective.

So the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, the form may be too complicated for the recipient (G). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each option's reasoning is.

Option A: wrong accounts.

Option B: too complicated.

Option C: accounts confirmed are part of the population, so no.

Option D: unconfirmed written off.

Option E: lost form.

Option F: equal selection.

Option G: recipient can't fill.

Option H: few responses.

Option I: form discarded.

So the correct answer is likely to be D, E, I, G, or H.

Wait, but the question is about why the form is ineffective. So perhaps the problem is that the blank form was not used at all. So if the blank form is lost or not filled, it's ineffective. So E and I are both possible issues. But the question is which letter the user selects. Since the options are A to I, I'm to choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because the blank form may be ineffective if the unconfirmed accounts have already been written off as uncollectible. So the blank form wouldn't be used because the accounts were already written off, so the form is ineffective.

Alternatively, if the blank form is not used at all (because it's lost or not filled), that's also a reason.

Wait, but the question is "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So each option is a separate reason, and the correct answer is one of them.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, because the blank form might be discarded, leading to no response.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think I'll go with option D because it's about unconfirmed accounts being written off, making the form ineffective.

Wait, but another thought: if the blank form is used but you don't select the correct accounts, you can't confirm them. So A is a possible issue. But the question is which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, if the blank form is too complicated (B), but I'm not sure that's the best reason.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options again.

The question is, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

So I have to pick one of the letters A-I as the answer.

Looking at what the options are, each is a separate reason.

The question is which reason the auditor should be aware of because the blank form may be ineffective.

So, the correct answer is one of the options.

Now, I'm going to think about it again. The blank form is used for positive accounts, so if the selected accounts are not the correct ones, the form is ineffective. So A is a possible issue.

But the question is asking which one the auditor should be aware of. So perhaps the key reason is that the blank form may not be used at all because it's lost or not filled, making the form ineffective.

So, the correct answer is E or I.

Alternatively, perhaps the blank form is too complicated for the recipient to understand (G), making it ineffective.

Wait, but I'm not sure about G. The recipient may not have the necessary information.

Wait, but the question is about why the blank form may be ineffective, so all these reasons are possible.

But the question is looking for the best answer, which is likely D, E, I, G, or H.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because the blank form may not be effective if the unconfirmed accounts have been written off.

Alternatively, the blank form may be used incorrectly, leading to it being ineffective.

Wait, I think the best answer is D, because if the unconfirmed accounts have been written off, the blank form would not be used, making it ineffective.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the blank form may be lost. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: The blank form might be discarded and not filled. So the blank form is ineffective because there's no confirmation. So I is a possible reason.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is D because the blank form might not be used if the unconfirmed accounts have already been written off.

Wait, but this is getting me stuck. I think I'll go with D as the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is D: "Accounts unconfirmed may have already been written off as uncollectible." This is because if the unconfirmed accounts were already written off, the blank form would not be used, making it ineffective.
