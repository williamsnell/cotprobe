Okay, so I've got this problem here about markup percentages. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. The question says the last character of the answer must be the letter chosen, so I'll make sure I pick the right letter in the end.

Alright, the problem states that a sofa has a markup of 20% based on its selling price. I need to find the percent markup based on the cost. Okay, so I remember that markup can be calculated in two ways: based on cost or based on selling price. The question is asking for the markup on cost, not selling price.

Wait, so if the markup is 20% on the selling price, how does that translate to markup on cost? Let me recall the formula. Markup percentage is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost) divided by Cost, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. But here, the markup is given as 20% of the selling price, not the cost.

So, let me break it down. Let's denote the cost as C and the selling price as S. The markup based on selling price is 20%, so the selling price is 120% of the cost. So, S = C + 20% of C = 1.20 * C.

Now, the markup amount is S - C = 0.20 * C. But the markup percentage based on cost would be (0.20 * C) divided by C, which is 0.20, or 20%. Wait, that can't be right because the answer options don't have 20% as a separate choice except option F and H. Wait, no, looking back, option F is 20% and H is 18%. So wait, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The markup is 20% based on the selling price. So, markup on cost is (Markup on SP) minus (Markup on SP as a percentage of cost). Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The markup is calculated as a percentage of the cost. So, markup on cost is (S - C) / C * 100. But if the markup is 20% on SP, then S = C + 0.20*S. Wait, no, that's not right because markup is based on SP. So, if markup is 20% on SP, then S = C + 20% of S. Wait, that can't be right because that would make S = 1.20 * S, which implies 1 = 1.20, which is impossible. So I must have gotten the formula wrong.

Ah, right! The markup on SP is 20%, meaning that the markup (which is S - C) is 20% of S. So, S - C = 0.20 * S. Let's solve for C: C = S - 0.20*S = 0.80*S. So, C is 80% of S. 

Now, the markup percentage on cost would be (S - C)/C * 100. Substituting C = 0.80*S, we get (S - 0.80*S)/(0.80*S) * 100. Simplify numerator: 0.20*S. So, 0.20*S / 0.80*S = 0.25, which is 25%. So the markup on cost is 25%.

Let me check the options. Option I is 25%, which matches. So the correct answer should be I:25%.

The markup based on cost is 25%.

Answer: I: 25%
