Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the fallacy called "appeal to popularity." I'm a bit fuzzy on my logic terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the fallacy is about. I remember that a fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid. So, the question is asking which option describes this fallacy specifically.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "Saying someone should do something because he or she dislikes someone else." Hmm, that sounds a bit odd. If someone dislikes someone else, it's possible that they might want to avoid conflict, but does that make sense in a cause-and-effect way? I'm not sure if this is a fallacy. It might be more about personal dislike rather than a logical fallacy.

Option B: "Saying someone should do something to be better liked by others." This sounds familiar. I think this is the classic appeal to popularity fallacy. It's when someone tries to convince others to adopt a certain viewpoint by arguing that it'll make them feel more popular or liked. This reasoning assumes that just because someone is more popular, the idea is better, which can lead to people adopting the idea even if it's not necessarily correct.

Option C: "Saying someone should do something because it will make him or her feel good." This also seems like a fallacy. It's based on the idea that a positive feeling from the action will encourage others to like it. But again, this assumes that feeling good will make the action favorable, which isn't always the case.

Option D: "Saying someone should accept an idea because of the source of the idea." I'm not sure about this one. I don't recall this being a well-known fallacy, but I think it's possible that some people might confuse the source of an idea with the reasonableness of the idea. But I don't think it's a standard fallacy.

So, the question is specifically about appeal to popularity. I remember that appeal to popularity is when someone tries to appeal to the popularity of a cause or idea. The classic example is when someone says, "People love X, so Y is more popular than X," and people will follow Y because they like X.

Looking back at the options, option B directly states this: it's about making someone like an idea by appealing to the popularity of that idea. So, that's the fallacy in question.

The correct answer is:

**B: saying someone should do something to be better liked by others**

This option describes the appeal to popularity fallacy, where someone argues that an idea is more popular because it makes the person feel good, aiming to convince others of its popularity.
