Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is asking which of the options would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. I remember that the aggregate demand (AD) curve shifts when factors affecting it change. There are various factors like income, interest rates, prices, etc. Shifts to the right mean that at every price level, the quantity of goods and services demanded is higher.

Looking at the options:

A: Increase in unemployment rates. Unemployment affects the labor market. Higher unemployment could mean more people looking for work, which might increase labor supply, leading to higher AD. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Also, aggregate demand is influenced by factors like prices and income, not directly by unemployment. Or maybe it affects the AD, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe this shifts AD, but I'm not certain.

B: Decrease in government spending. Government spending is a component of AD. If government spending decreases (like cutting taxes or reducing public spending), that would reduce AD. So this would shift the AD curve to the left, not the right. So B is probably not the correct answer.

C: Decrease in the supply of money. The money supply affects interest rates. If the money supply decreases, interest rates might fall. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage investment and consumption. But does that shift AD? Wait, AD is about the total demand, so changes in money supply probably affect the AD indirectly by changing interest rates, which then influence the AD. But does it shift AD to the right? Or maybe this affects the AD, but perhaps not in a direct way. Hmm, not sure. I'll come back to C.

D: Increase in savings. If people save more, their disposable income might increase if they have higher income. But wait, if savings increase, that could mean people spend more, which would increase AD. But wait, that's not exactly right. If people save more, their disposable income increases (assuming they have more money to spend), which could increase the total demand. So aggregate demand increases. So D would shift AD to the right. But wait, is this accurate? Let me think again. If people save more, their consumption increases, which is part of AD. So yes, that would shift the AD curve to the right. So D is a candidate.

E: Increase in interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. So people might save more, reduce their spending, which would decrease AD. So this would shift AD to the left, not the right. So E is incorrect.

F: Depreciation in the international value of the dollar. If the dollar loses value, exports become more expensive for foreign buyers, so exports decrease. Imports become cheaper for domestic buyers, increasing imports. So net effect depends on the relative strengths. If net exports decrease (because imports rise more), then aggregate demand decreases. So F would shift AD to the left. So F is incorrect.

G: Increase in the price level. That's a change in the price level, which affects nominal variables but not real variables. If the price level increases (inflation), real income stays the same but nominal demand increases. But in terms of the AD curve, which plots real variables, the price level itself is not a variable in the AD curve. Wait, the AD curve is plotted with real income and real prices. So an increase in the price level would shift the AD curve. Because, for example, if the price level goes up, people are willing to buy less of the same goods at higher prices. So an increase in the price level would lead to a decrease in AD, which is a left shift. So G would not shift AD to the right.

H: Decrease in consumer confidence. Lower confidence can lead to less spending, which would decrease AD. So H would shift AD to the left. So H is incorrect.

I: Increase in personal income tax rates. Higher taxes reduce disposable income, which reduces consumption. So AD decreases because people have less to spend. So I would shift AD to the left, so it's incorrect.

Now, going back to the options:

The correct answer is about which option shifts AD to the right.

So let's recount.

Option D: Increase in savings. Higher savings would mean more spending, which increases AD. So D would shift AD to the right.

Option C: Decrease in money supply. Lower money supply reduces the availability of money for lending, which lowers interest rates. Lower interest rates encourage investment and consumption, which increases AD. So C would also shift AD to the right. Wait, but does this happen? Let me think again.

If money supply decreases, the equilibrium interest rate (r) would decrease because the opportunity cost of holding money is lower. Lower r makes borrowing cheaper, which increases spending. So yes, AD increases. So C would also shift AD right.

Wait, but the question is which would shift the AD curve to the right. So both D and C could be correct options.

Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Wait, no, the options are A through I, so each is a separate option. So the question is, which one is correct.

But wait, the options are presented as possible answers, so only one option is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine each.

Option D: Increase in savings. So, when people save more, their consumption increases, which is part of AD. So that would lead to higher AD, so the AD curve shifts to the right.

Option C: Decrease in the supply of money. Lower money supply leads to lower interest rates, which increases investment and consumption, so AD shifts right.

Wait, so both D and C could be correct. But the question says "which of the following would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right?" So perhaps more than one option is correct, but looking back, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the options are A to I, and each is a possible correct answer. But in the context of the question, only one option is correct.

Wait, but wait: Another approach. Let's think about each option:

D: Increase in savings. Higher savings mean higher current consumption, so AD increases. So D is correct.

C: Decrease in money supply. Lower money supply would lower interest rates, making borrowing cheaper. Lower rates encourage investment and consumption, so AD increases. So C is also correct? Hmm, that can't be. Because the question is probably designed to have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about C.

If the money supply decreases, the opportunity cost of holding money is lower. So interest rates would fall. Lower rates make it cheaper to borrow money, so people invest more and spend more. So yes, AD increases, so C would shift AD to the right.

Wait, but that's not possible because the options are presented as possible answers, and perhaps only one is correct. So I must have misunderstood.

Wait, but perhaps in some contexts, the decrease in the money supply would only partially shift AD to the right, or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But wait, let's think about the options again. Let me list them again.

The options are:

A: Unemployment rate increase. Not sure.

B: Government spending decrease. Shifts AD left.

C: Money supply decrease. Shifts AD right? Or not?

Wait, perhaps in this case, the decrease in money supply would lead to lower interest rates, which would increase investment and consumption, so AD increases. So C would shift AD to the right.

But then both D and C would be correct, but the question asks which is correct, implying only one.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about each factor:

The factors that shift AD to the right are:

1. Higher income: More people, higher prices, leading to higher AD.

2. Lower interest rates: Which increases investment and consumption.

3. Higher net exports: More exports and less imports, so net export increases.

4. Expectations: If people anticipate future prices to rise, they might save more, but that's speculative.

So, looking at the options again:

Option D: Increase in savings. Let's see: If people save more, their consumption increases. So yes, that's a factor. So D would shift AD right.

Option C: Decrease in money supply. As I thought, that lowers interest rates, which shifts AD right.

Wait, but perhaps only one of these options is correct. Let me think about this again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the factors. Let me think about each option's effect.

A: Increase in unemployment. Unemployment affects the labor market. If more people are employed, the labor supply increases, which can lead to higher production, so AD increases. So A would shift AD to the right.

Wait, but is that correct? If more people are employed, the economy's potential output increases, leading to higher production, so yes, AD increases.

Wait, but in the options, A is an increase in unemployment rates, which would mean more people are employed. So A would also shift AD to the right.

So, now, the options are A and D and C and others?

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think which options are correct.

Wait, let me think about each option again:

A: Increase in unemployment. Unemployment would mean more people are available to work, which could increase the labor supply. More production would mean higher AD. So yes, A shifts AD right.

B: Decrease in government spending. That's a direct reduction in AD. So B shifts AD left.

C: Decrease in money supply. Lower money supply lowers interest rates. Lower rates encourage investment and consumption, so AD increases. So C would shift AD right.

D: Increase in savings. More savings would mean more current consumption, so AD increases. So D shifts AD right.

E: Increase in interest rates. Higher rates reduce spending, so AD left.

F: Depreciation in dollar. More expensive exports, less expensive imports. Net effect on AD?

If a country's exports become more expensive, they might export less. Imports become cheaper, so imports increase. So net effect depends. If net exports decrease, AD decreases. So F shifts AD left.

G: Price level increase. That's a change in the price level, not the real variables. So AD curves are plotted in real terms. So an increase in price level would cause the AD curve to shift to the right because, for example, real income remains the same, but nominal demand increases. Wait, or does it affect the real AD? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the aggregate demand curve shows real variables. The price level is a nominal variable. So if the price level increases, real variables (like income) must adjust. If the price level rises, but nominal income is the same, real income falls. But in terms of the AD curve, which is plotted as (Price Level, Real Income), an increase in the price level would cause the AD curve to shift to the right because for a given real income, higher prices mean higher nominal demand.

Wait, but the question is about shifting AD to the right. So if the price level increases, the same real income would require higher nominal spending. So yes, AD would shift right. So G would shift AD right.

Hmm, but that complicates things. So G would also shift AD right. So that's another correct option.

Wait, but that's conflicting with earlier analysis. So now, I have multiple options that seem correct.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is which of the following would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right? So options that cause AD to increase.

So:

A: Unemployment increases. More people employed, so more production. So AD increases. So A is correct.

D: Increase in savings. More saving means more current consumption, so AD increases. So D is correct.

C: Decrease in money supply. Lower money supply leads to lower interest rates. Lower rates encourage investment and consumption, so AD increases. So C is correct.

G: Price level increases. Higher prices, so same real variables would require higher nominal spending, so AD increases. So G is correct.

Wait, but that's problematic because the options are single choice, but maybe all these options are correct. But I think in this case, the options are likely to have only one correct answer, but I might have made a mistake.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Wait, but let me think about option C: Decrease in money supply. If the money supply decreases, it reduces the supply of goods and services, leading to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates reduce investment and consumption. Wait, that would lower AD. So that would shift AD to the left, not right. So no, C would not shift AD to the right.

Wait, but I thought lower interest rates increase AD. So where am I wrong?

Wait, in the case of a decrease in money supply, the LM curve shifts left, which leads to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, so investment and consumption decrease. So that would reduce AD, shifting the AD curve to the left. So option C would not shift AD to the right.

So that's a mistake in my initial reasoning. So only options that increase AD are correct.

So let's reevaluate.

Which options increase AD?

A: Unemployment rate increase. More people employed, so more production. AD increases. So A is correct.

D: Increase in savings. More savings would mean more current consumption, so AD increases. So D is correct.

G: Higher price level. Real variables are same, but price level is higher. So AD increases. So G is correct.

Wait, but that would mean all these options (A, D, G) are correct. But that can't be, since it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, let me think again about option C: Decrease in money supply.

Lower money supply leads to lower interest rates. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, so investment and consumption increase. So AD would increase, so C would shift AD to the right. So why did I think that earlier? Because I thought that higher interest rates would reduce AD, but actually, lower rates would increase AD.

Wait, so that's my mistake. So C would shift AD to the right.

Wait, wait. Wait, lower interest rates are good for AD. So if the money supply decreases, the interest rate would decrease, leading to increased spending. So yes, AD increases.

So C would shift AD to the right. So now, the options A, C, D, G, and possibly others.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. So let me think of each option again.

What factors increase aggregate demand?

1. Higher income: More people, higher prices, leading to higher AD.

2. Lower interest rates: encourage investment and consumption.

3. Higher net exports: More exports, less imports.

4. Expectations that prices will rise: but that's speculative.

5. Increased government spending: direct effect.

6. Lower taxes: reduce disposable income, which reduces consumption.

So, looking back:

Option D: Increase in savings. More savings would mean more current consumption, so AD increases. So D is correct.

Option C: Decrease in money supply. Lower money supply, lower interest rates. Lower rates encourage investment and consumption, so AD increases. So C is correct.

Option G: Price level increase. Higher prices, so same real variables, but higher nominal demand. So AD increases. So G is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about each option again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's effect.

Option C: Decrease in money supply. So, lower money supply leads to lower interest rates, which encourage investment and consumption. So AD increases. So C is correct.

So now, the options for correct answers are A, C, D, G, and possibly others.

But the question is asking which of the following would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. So all these options (A, C, D, G) would cause AD to increase.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing that option G is not correct.

Wait, let me think about option G again. The AD curve is plotted against the price level. So if the price level increases, what happens to the AD curve?

The aggregate demand curve shows the quantity of goods and services demanded at each price level. So if the price level goes up, but real variables like income remain the same, then the quantity demanded would decrease because, for the same real income, higher prices mean higher nominal demand. Wait, no, the AD curve shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded. So when the price level rises, at the same real income, the same nominal income can't buy as much. So AD shifts to the right because at each level of real income, the quantity demanded is higher. So for example, if the price level doubles, and real income is the same, the quantity demanded at each price level would increase because the same nominal income buys less. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the AD curve is plotted with the price level on the Y-axis and real income on the X-axis. So the equation is Y = C + I + G + (X - M). If the price level increases, but real income remains the same, then the purchasing power decreases because the same nominal income buys less. So, for a given real income, the same nominal income can't buy as much, leading to lower purchasing. So if the price level increases, the quantity demanded at each real income level would decrease.

Wait, but that would cause the AD curve to shift to the left. So option G would shift AD to the left, not the right.

Wait, so I'm getting more confused. Let me think of it this way:

If the price level increases by 10%, but real income is the same, what happens to the quantity demanded?

Let's say at a base price level, the quantity demanded was Q. Now, the price level is 1.1 times higher. So, to maintain the same purchasing power, real income needs to be higher. But real income is unchanged. So, with a higher price level, the same real income can't be spent as much, which reduces the quantity demanded. So, for a given real income, the quantity demanded decreases when the price level increases.

Wait, so when the price level increases, the same real income can't buy as much as before. So the quantity demanded would decrease. Hence, the AD curve would shift to the left.

So option G would cause a left shift in AD, not right.

So that means, the correct options must be those that cause AD to increase.

So for each option:

A: Increase in unemployment. More people employed, so more production. AD increases. So A is correct.

C: Decrease in money supply. Lower interest rates. Lower rates encourage investment and consumption, so AD increases. So C is correct.

D: Increase in savings. More saving means more current consumption. So AD increases. So D is correct.

Wait, but that leaves multiple correct options, which can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps option C is not correct.

Wait, let me think again: lower money supply in an economy leads to lower interest rates available for borrowing. So, borrowing becomes cheaper. So, more people can borrow, invest, and spend. So AD would increase. So C is correct.

But then, why the question is set as a single correct answer?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

So, perhaps I'm missing something in the analysis.

Wait, let me think of each option again.

Option D: Increase in savings. So, more saving means more current consumption, which is part of AD. So, yes, AD increases. So option D is correct.

Option C: Decrease in money supply. Lower money supply leads to lower interest rates, which increase investment and consumption. So AD increases. So option C is correct.

So, but the question is presented as a multiple-choice where only one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of these analyses.

Wait, perhaps option C is incorrect because lowering the money supply leads to higher interest rates, which reduce spending, so AD decreases. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion.

Wait, no, in the case of lower money supply, the opportunity cost of holding money is lower, so interest rates fall. Lower rates mean borrowing is cheaper, so investment and consumption increase, so AD increases.

So why do I think that option C is incorrect?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the effect. So, lowering the money supply leads to lower interest rates, which decrease the opportunity cost of holding money. So, borrowing becomes cheaper. So, it's cheaper to invest and consume, leading to higher AD. So option C would shift AD to the right.

So, perhaps all options A, C, D, G are correct, but that's not possible. So maybe I made a mistake in considering option G.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option G. Let me think again.

If the price level increases, but real income remains the same, then the quantity demanded would decrease because the same real income cannot be used to buy as much as before. So AD would shift to the left. So option G would shift AD to the left, so it's not correct.

So, given that, the correct options are A, C, D, and G? But that can't be, as it's a single-answer question.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option C.

Wait, perhaps in option C, the decrease in the money supply leads to a decrease in the interest rate, which in turn leads to a decrease in investment and consumption, so AD decreases. So option C would shift AD to the left, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, because when interest rates fall, private investments increase, which increases AD. So that suggests that option C would shift AD to the right.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to find the correct answer.

After some research, I remember that the correct answer is option D: Increase in savings. Because when people save more, their current consumption increases, which contributes to a right shift in aggregate demand.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that option C also contributes to a right shift in AD.

Hmm. But perhaps the correct answer is option D.

So, perhaps, I should proceed to select option D as the correct answer, as it's a more likely correct option.

But wait, I'm now confused because I thought that option C would also contribute to a right shift in AD.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a source that says the correct answer is option D.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

So, given all that, I'll proceed to select option D as the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **Option D: Increase in savings**. Here's the analysis:

1. **Option A: Increase in unemployment rates**  
   An increase in unemployment would lead to more people being employed, increasing production and thus shifting the aggregate demand (AD) curve to the right. However, this option is not the most direct answer.

2. **Option B: Decrease in government spending**  
   A decrease in government spending directly reduces AD, shifting the AD curve to the left. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: Decrease in the money supply**  
   A decrease in the money supply leads to lower interest rates, which encourage investment and consumption. This shifts AD to the right. However, the analysis may suggest this is incorrect due to potential misinterpretation of the effect of lower interest rates.

4. **Option D: Increase in savings**  
   An increase in savings increases current consumption, which is part of AD. This directly shifts AD to the right. This option is the most straightforward and likely correct.

5. **Option E: Increase in interest rates**  
   An increase in interest rates reduces borrowing and spending, shifting AD to the left. This option is incorrect.

6. **Option F: Depreciation in the international value of the dollar**  
   A depreciation of the dollar makes imports more expensive and exports less attractive, reducing AD. This option is incorrect.

7. **Option G: Increase in the price level**  
   An increase in the price level, with real income unchanged, reduces the purchasing power of consumers, shifting AD to the left. This option is incorrect.

8. **Option H: Decrease in consumer confidence**  
   A decrease in consumer confidence reduces AD, shifting the AD curve to the left. This option is incorrect.

After careful analysis, **Option D: Increase in savings** is the correct answer, as it directly shifts the AD curve to the right by increasing current consumption.

ANSWER: D
