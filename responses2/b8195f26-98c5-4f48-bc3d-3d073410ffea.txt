Question:

A landlord orally leased a commercial building to a tenant for a 10-year term, which ended one year ago. At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?

Options:

A: No, because the items were considered part of the property.
B: Yes, because the removal did not cause any damage to the building.
C: No, because he removed the items after the lease term had ended.
D: Yes, because he had originally paid for the items.
E: Yes, because they were trade fixtures.
F: No, because the items were considered permanent fixtures.
G: Yes, because he had the landlord's original permission to install the items.
H: No, because the lease was oral.
I: No, because he was a holdover tenant.
J: Yes, because they were accessions.

Alright, so I've got this question about landlord-tenant law. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. Okay, the scenario is that a tenant leased a commercial building to them orally. The lease was for 10 years and ended one year ago. At the beginning, the tenant installed various appliances and a large air-conditioning system. They did this with the landlord's permission and used them for the tenant's business. Now, at the end of the lease term, the tenant hasn't vacated yet. He's been paying the rent, and he's been in possession for another four months. But before he could let go, he removed the appliances and air conditioning, and there was no damage to the building. The question is whether his removal was proper.

I need to figure out which option is correct. The options are A through J, each with a different reason.

First, I should recall the relevant lease law principles. When a landlord leases a building, especially one where the tenant installs items like appliances, these are considered fixtures or fixtures of place. They're part of the building's facilities and are considered to be there from the start.

In general, when tenants move in and install fixtures, they must take measures to be removed within 12 months of the lease ending. This is because the landlord can't force them to vacate during the lease term. If they're still there, the landlord has a duty to remove them before the lease ends.

In this case, the tenant moved in, installed the appliances, and left them in place. The lease ended one year ago, so the tenant had 12 months to vacate. He's been in possession for four months and hasn't vacated yet. He removed the items before the lease ended, even though the lease was oral. Wait, the lease was oral, but the tenant was allowed to move in and install fixtures. So the right to vacate applies to the tenant's move-in, but the landlord has a duty to remove the tenant's fixtures if they're still there.

Wait, the landlord's duty is to take the tenant out of the premises within 12 months of the lease ending if the tenant continues to occupy. So the tenant was in possession for four months and hasn't vacated yet, but the landlord hasn't taken him out yet. That's a breach of duty.

Wait, so the question is whether the removal was proper. The tenant removed the items before the lease ended, but the landlord's duty is to take the tenant out within 12 months of the lease ending. Since the lease was oral, the landlord couldn't enforce this duty unless the tenant had signed a written lease. But the question says "orally" leased, which I'm not exactly sure about. If it's oral, then the landlord can't enforce the duty, but the question is about what's proper for the tenant.

Alternatively, the problem is that the tenant needs to vacate within 12 months of the lease ending. If they haven't vacated yet, the landlord has a duty to take them out before the lease ends. In this case, the tenant didn't vacate before the lease ended, so the landlord had a duty to take him out. He did do that by removing the fixtures. So is the removal proper?

Wait, but the question is about whether the removal was proper. The tenant's removal was done before the lease ended, which was 12 months ago. So the landlord's duty was to remove him. The answer is yes, it's proper because the landlord had the duty and he did remove the items.

Looking at the options: Option C says "No, because he removed the items after the lease term had ended." But the lease ended before the tenant vacated. So the tenant didn't have time to vacate, so the landlord had a duty. If he removed them before the lease ended, that's proper. So C is incorrect.

Option A: No because the items were considered part of the property. I don't think that's the reason. The court would likely consider the failure to vacate within the lease term, which is the main issue here.

Option B: Yes because the removal didn't cause damage. That's about the consequences of the removal, not the obligation. The tenant's duty is to remove the items, not that he would not have caused damage.

Option C is incorrect as discussed.

Option D: Yes because he had the landlord's permission. Wait, the tenant had paid for the items, so he had permission. But the duty is about removing them, not about getting permission. So D says yes because of permission, which isn't the issue here.

Option E: No because he was a holdover. Wait, the tenant was in the building, but the landlord couldn't force him to vacate even if he had the right. So E is incorrect.

Option F: No, because the items were considered permanent fixtures. Wait, no, the items were installed during the lease, so they're fixtures of place. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Yes because he had the landlord's original permission. Again, the duty is about removing, not permission.

Option H: No because the lease was oral. But if the lease was oral, the landlord couldn't enforce the duty unless the tenant had a signed lease. However, the question is whether the removal was proper. Since the landlord had the duty but didn't take him out, the removal was proper. So H is incorrect.

Option I: No because he was a holdover. No, the tenant was in the building, so being a holdover is not relevant.

Option J: Yes because they were accessions. Accessions are fixed fixtures. So J is correct.

Wait, so the correct answer is J. Because the items were considered accessions, which are fixed fixtures that the landlord must remove if the tenant remains in possession. But the question is whether the removal was proper. Since the tenant removed them before the lease ended, it's proper. Or, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. The question is about whether the removal was proper. The landlord must remove the tenant's fixtures within 12 months of the lease ending. Since the lease ended before the tenant vacated, the landlord had a duty. He did remove them, which is proper. So the correct answer is J: yes, because they were accessions.

Wait, but the question is, was the removal proper? So the right answer is J, as the removal was proper.

The question revolves around the properness of the tenant's removal of fixtures after leasing the building. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Principles**: When a tenant installs fixtures, they are considered fixtures of place and must be removed within 12 months of the lease ending if they remain in possession. The landlord has a duty to enforce this duty.

2. **Scenario**: The tenant removed the items before the lease ended, which was one year ago. The lease ended before the tenant vacated, and the removal was timely.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. The failure to vacate within the lease term is the main issue, not the ownership status of the fixtures.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The duty is about removing the items, not the consequences of their removal.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The removal was proper as long as the landlord had the duty to remove the tenant's fixtures.
   - **D**: Incorrect. The duty is not about getting permission; it's about removing the items.
   - **E**: Incorrect. The landlord can enforce the duty but did not take the tenant out.
   - **F**: Incorrect. The items were considered fixtures, not permanent fixtures.
   - **G**: Incorrect. The duty is about removal, not permission.
   - **H**: Incorrect. The lease was oral, and the duty would not be enforced without a signed lease.
   - **I**: Incorrect. The tenant was in the building and was not a holdover.
   - **J**: Correct. The items are accessions, fixed fixtures, and removal was proper.

The correct answer is **J: Yes, because they were accessions.** The removal was proper as the tenant removed the items before the lease ended, fulfilling the landlord's duty.

Answer: J
