Okay, so I have this question about the highest levels of learning and performance. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I remember from my psychology class that arousal levels are related to emotional states and motivation. 

The question is asking which option corresponds to the highest levels of learning. Let's look at the options. 

Option A says "constant changes in levels of arousal." That doesn't seem right because constant arousal might imply steady states, not the highest level of learning. 

Option B is "low levels of arousal." That would be more like when someone is perhaps bored or not motivated, which doesn't fit as high a level of learning.

Option C is "arousal levels that are consistently low." Wait, that's the same as B. So maybe C and B are the same? Or perhaps C is a variation of B. Hmm, but I think they're distinct. 

Option D is "high levels of arousal." That's the opposite of what I'm thinking. High arousal would mean more intense feelings, which probably isn't the highest performance.

Option E is "complete absence of arousal." No, that's even less intense, so probably not the highest.

Option F is "moderate levels of arousal." Again, moderate might not be the highest.

Option G is "extreme levels of arousal." Extreme arousal could mean very high energy, which might be associated with peak performance or learning. 

Option I is "gradually increasing levels of arousal." That doesn't fit, as it's about gradual changes, not the highest.

Option J is "arousal levels that are consistently high." That sounds exactly like what I was thinking about high arousal leading to high performance. 

So putting it together, the highest levels of learning and performance would have high arousal, which is option J. I think J is the correct answer.

The correct answer is J: arousal levels that are consistently high.
