Okay, so I've got this question about gift tax and property gifts. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: A taxpayer buys an insurance contract on his own life and designates his two children as equal beneficiaries. He makes all premium payments. The question is, how many gifts of property have been made for gift tax purposes?

The options are A to J. I need to figure out the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that when someone makes a gift, it's a tax-free transfer as long as it's not for a gift with a substantial value. But wait, in this case, it's an insurance contract. I think there's a specific term for that. Oh right, it's called a life insurance policy. 

Now, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact gift tax rules for life insurance. I think that when someone makes a life insurance policy, it's considered a tax-free transfer. But does that mean it's a gift? Or is it just a transfer?

Wait, no. A life insurance policy is a type of life insurance, not a gift. Gifts in the context of gift tax are when you transfer property to someone else with the intent to exchange it for other things. So, a life insurance policy is not a gift per se; it's a policy that's intended to provide income or coverage to others, not as a direct transfer of property.

So, the person here is making a life insurance policy, which is a type of policy, not a gift. He's buying it and designating children as beneficiaries. But whether that counts as a gift depends on the definition. Since it's a policy and not a direct transfer, maybe it's not considered a gift.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, if you're the owner of a life insurance policy, you might be considered the beneficiary. But in this question, it's specified that he designates his children as beneficiaries. So the policy is given in a way that's not transferring the policy itself to another person. Instead, it's given to the children as a gift.

Wait no, because the policy is a life insurance policy, which isn't a gift. A gift is when you transfer property (like cash, inventory, etc.) to a third party with the intent to exchange it. So a life insurance policy is a policy, not a gift. So the person isn't transferring a life insurance policy to another person; he's committing to provide coverage. Therefore, it's not a gift.

Wait, but some people might consider the policy itself as a gift, but I think that's not the case. A gift is when you transfer a property to someone else. So the policy isn't being transferred; it's a promise to provide coverage. So the number of gifts made is zero.

Wait, but the question says he makes all premium payments. Does that affect the gift count? I don't think so because the premium is a cost, not a transfer. So the number of gifts made is zero.

Looking at the options, option C says Zero. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: Zero. 

Explanation: The taxpayer purchases a life insurance policy as a transfer of property, not as a gift. Since a life insurance policy is not a gift but a promise, no gifts are made. Premium payments are costs and not considered gifts. 

Answer: C
