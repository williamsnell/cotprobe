Okay, let's tackle this question. The question is about memory and specifically asks which type of memory falls under the recall of information within the past few hours to days. So I need to recall the different types of memory.

I remember that memory can be categorized into different types. There are short-term and long-term memories. Short-term is the immediate recall period, while long-term is the long-term retention. So the options given include Episodic, Declarative, Semantic, Working, Echoic, Sensory, Prospective, Implicit, and Long-term.

Episodic memory is specifically about short-term, immediate events and details. Declarative memory is about remembering what you say, which is more long-term but can involve recent events. Semantic memory is about remembering concepts, ideas, and meanings, which is a long-term memory. Working memory is the temporary storage used in cognitive tasks, not a type of memory itself. Echoic memory is about recalling sounds or visual images, which is another short-term memory. Sensory memory is about what you can sense, like smell or touch. Prospective is about looking forward or predicting the future. Implicit is a type of long-term memory learned without conscious effort, and Implicit doesn't fit the immediate recall aspect here.

The question is about recalling information within a few hours to days. Episodic is immediate, so that's the right fit. Declarative is more about what you say, which is long-term but not immediate. Semantic is long-term but not the immediate recall aspect. So the correct answer should be Episodic, which is option A.

The correct answer is **A: Episodic** because Episodic memory involves recalling recent, specific information within a few hours to days.
