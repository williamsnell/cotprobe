Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the shapes of different molecules. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given options has a tetrahedral shape. The options are labeled A to I, each representing a different molecule. I remember that molecular geometry is determined by the number of bonding pairs and lone pairs around the central atom. For tetrahedral shapes, the central atom typically has four regions of electron density: four bonding pairs, or one bonding and three lone pairs.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: SO₂. Sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is in the center. It has two oxygen atoms bonded to it, so two bonding pairs. The other two regions would be lone pairs. Sulfur has a valence of 6, so bonding pairs are 2, so lone pairs would be 4-2=2. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in SO₂, S has a double bond with each O. So the structure is bent. So that's bent, not tetrahedral. So A is not the answer.

Option B: BeCl₂. Beryllium chloride. Be is the central atom. Each Cl is bonded, so that's two bonding pairs. Be has a valence of 2, so bonding pairs are 2. The remaining two regions are lone pairs. So, 2 bonding, 2 lone. For BeCl₂, the geometry is linear. Because when there are two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, but wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Be has only four valence electrons. It forms two bonds, so two bonding pairs, and has two lone pairs. So the electron arrangement is four regions: two bonding, two lone. So the shape would be linear. So B is not the answer.

Option C: SF6. Sulfur hexafluoride. S is the central atom. It's connected to six F atoms. So all six are bonding pairs. That's six regions, so the geometry should be octahedral. So C is not the answer.

Option D: CBr4. Carbon tetrachloride. C is the central atom. It has four Br atoms attached. Each Br is connected to C. So four bonding pairs and no lone pairs. So the shape is tetrahedral. Because four bonding pairs and zero lone pairs. So D’s shape is tetrahedral. That might be the answer. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option E: PCl4F. Phosphorus tetrafluorochloride? Wait, no, PCl4F. P is the central atom. It has four Cl and one F attached. So that's five regions (four Cl, one F). So five regions of electron density. So possible shapes: trigonal bipyramidal (if F is axial), or T-shaped (if F is axial, and others in different positions). But for tetrahedral, you need four bonding regions. Here, F is a fifth, so it's not tetrahedral. So E is not the answer.

Option F: NH3. Ammonia. Nitrogen in the center. Three H atoms and one N-H bond. So three bonding pairs. The fourth region is a lone pair on nitrogen. So four regions: three bonding, one lone. The shape is trigonal pyramidal. Not tetrahedral. So F is not.

Option G: BF3. Boron trifluoride. Central B has three F atoms. So three bonding pairs and no lone pairs. That's three regions. So the shape is trigonal planar. Not tetrahedral, so G is out.

Option H: CO2. Carbon dioxide. Central C has two O atoms. Both O have double bonds. So two bonding pairs. The other two regions are lone pairs. So four regions. Wait, but for CO2, each O is bonded to C with a double bond, so no lone pairs. So the electron arrangement is two bonding pairs. So the shape is linear. So H is not the answer.

Option I: H2O. Water. Central O atom. It has two H atoms. So two bonding pairs. The other two regions are lone pairs. So four regions. So molecular geometry is bent (V shape). So I is not the answer.

Wait, but looking back, only D (CBr4) seems to have four bonding regions with no lone pairs, making tetrahedral. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine which molecule has a tetrahedral shape, we analyze the electron arrangement around the central atom based on the number of bonding pairs and lone pairs:

- **A: SO₂**  
  Sulfur dioxide has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent (V-shaped) geometry.  
- **B: BeCl₂**  
  Beryllium chloride has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a linear geometry.  
- **C: SF₆**  
  Sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs, resulting in an octahedral geometry.  
- **D: CBr₄**  
  Carbon tetrachloride has four bonding pairs with no lone pairs, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry.  
- **E: PCl₄F**  
  Phosphorus tetrafluorochloride has five regions of electron density, resulting in a trigonal bipyramidal or T-shaped geometry.  
- **F: NH₃**  
  Ammonia has three bonding pairs and one lone pair, resulting in a trigonal pyramidal geometry.  
- **G: BF₃**  
  Boron trifluoride has three bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in a trigonal planar geometry.  
- **H: CO₂**  
  Carbon dioxide has two bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in a linear geometry.  
- **I: H₂O**  
  Water has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent (V-shaped) geometry.  

The only molecule with a tetrahedral shape is **CBr₄**.  

**ANSWER: D**
