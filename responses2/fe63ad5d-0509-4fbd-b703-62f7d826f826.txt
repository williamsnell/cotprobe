Okay, I need to figure out which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per kilogram of body mass. I'm a bit rusty on my nutrition and metabolism, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that energy expenditure is related to how active a person is. So, more active people burn more energy. But how does that translate to different organs?

Let me list out the options: Intestines, Heart, Lungs, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Stomach, Skin, Skeletal Muscle, and Pancreas.

I think the liver is an important organ. I remember reading that the liver is an exception because it doesn't burn a lot of calories. Its energy expenditure is low because it doesn't use oxygen as efficiently as other organs. Maybe around 1-2 calories per kg of body mass.

The heart is another organ; I recall it's quite active, so it burns a lot. So that's probably not the answer.

The lungs are also active, especially in athletes. They require a lot of energy because they work against gravity and in a high-energy environment. I think their energy expenditure is higher than the liver.

Kidneys are more about waste production, especially in the form of urine and excreted waste, so they probably burn a lot of energy.

Stomach: Stomach is involved in digestion, so it burns energy for nutrient absorption. I think it's a bit higher than the liver but maybe not as high as other organs.

Skeletal muscle: These are active muscles, so they burn a lot of energy. Like, running or jumping would use a lot of energy.

Pancreas: I'm a bit unsure about this one. The pancreas is related to sugar metabolism. If you're really low on glucose, it uses energy to make sugar again. But the main energy expenditure would be for producing glucose, which is probably more energy than the liver but maybe less than the heart.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The liver's energy expenditure is the lowest, about 1-2 cal/kg. The brain, being the highest, probably burns more, about 10-15 cal/kg. The heart is an exception, not burning a lot. The lungs are high, and the heart is high. The brain is higher than the liver.

So the liver has the lowest. Looking at the options, liver is option H. The other options seem to have higher exponents. So the answer should be H.

The organ with the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass is the liver, as it burns only about 1-2 calories per kilogram of body mass. 

Answer: H
