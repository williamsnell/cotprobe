Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evolution in giraffes. Hmm, let me think through it. The question is asking what kind of selection is happening when taller giraffes are favored, and more of them survive and pass on their genes. 

Artificial selection, right. I remember that's when certain traits are selected for because they're beneficial. Like, if a population has a trait that helps them survive or reproduce better, they're more likely to pass on those genes. So that's selection, but what kind specifically?

Looking at the options, option I is disruptive selection. Wait, no, disruptive selection usually refers to when advantageous traits are selected against others that have less of that trait. Like, maybe if a trait is harmful in one group and beneficial in another, it disrupts the population. But in this case, the taller individuals are the ones with the beneficial trait, so they're selected for. That sounds more like directional selection, which is when selection acts on a single trait, favoring one type.

Option J is directional selection. I think that's when a particular factor causes a change in the direction of a population's traits. Since the environmental change is promoting taller giraffes, their advantage is in the height. So directional selection would make sense here. 

Wait, but what's the difference between directional and other types. Directional selection is when one direction is favored. For example, if a trait is beneficial, selection will favor individuals with that trait. So in this case, the taller individuals are better, so they're selected for. That's exactly directional selection.

Other options: A is about artificial, but that's more general. B is the founder effect, which is about a population's initial few individuals being replaced. C is stabilizing, which is when intermediate traits are maintained, like in a population where certain traits are kept to prevent extremes. D is intrasexual, which is when individuals within the same species affect each other. E is sexual selection, which involves traits determined by sexual dimorphism. F is kin selection, where genes affect relatives. G is genetic drift, random changes in allele frequencies. H is bottleneck effect, a random decrease in population size.

So the correct choice is directional selection. So the answer should be J.

The question describes a scenario where taller giraffes are favored due to environmental benefits, making them more likely to survive and pass on their genetic information. This aligns with **directional selection**, where selection favors one trait over others, leading to the accumulation of that trait in the population. 

Answer: J
