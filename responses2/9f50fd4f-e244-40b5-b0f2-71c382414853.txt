She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct diagnosis for this woman. Let's break down the question and the information provided. 

The patient is a 50-year-old woman presenting with recurrent abdominal pain for the first time. She has a long history of physical symptoms, but despite extensive diagnostic studies and multiple consultations, definitive causes haven't been found. She's described in a dramatic and exaggerated manner, making conflicting statements about her past history. She's been hospitalized at least 23 times, which suggests there's a significant medical history.

The possible options are Conversion disorder, Histrionic personality disorder, Occult medical disorder, and Somatic symptom disorder. 

First, I'll try to understand each option. 

Conversion disorder (Option A) is a mental health condition where symptoms of one disorder change to another when exposed to a specific environment. The patient here seems to have physical symptoms and possibly a mental health issue, but the description suggests a medical diagnosis, not necessarily mental. So maybe A isn't the best fit.

Histrionic personality disorder (Option B) is a personality disorder with characteristic exaggerated, dramatic, or exaggerated behavior that may result from excessive focus on one aspect of one's personality. The patient's description about dramatic and exaggerated symptoms might fit here, but it's more about behavior than underlying medical issues. Though, the recurring symptoms could relate to a personality disorder, but again, I'm not sure if that's the most likely here.

Occult medical disorder (Option C) refers to a hidden medical issue that is not easily visible or obvious. The patient has a long, history of symptoms, which could be indicative of something underlying. Her repeated symptoms and conflicting statements about her past might point towards a hidden condition, making Option C possible.

Somatic symptom disorder (Option D) is a condition where symptoms are excessive or exaggerated, often due to stress or anxiety. The patient's description of dramatic and exaggerated symptoms could fit, but it's more about physical symptoms than a specific disorder that's often studied or classified. Somatic disorders are sometimes categorized, but I'm not sure if this is the most accurate here.

Now, considering the symptoms and her history: the recurring abdominal pain, conflicting statements, and repeated hospitalizations. These all suggest a medical diagnosis rather than a personality disorder. Conversion disorder involves changing symptoms, not necessarily a medical condition. Somatic symptom disorder might be about excessive symptoms, but the question is about a diagnosis, not just the presentation.

Occult medical disorder points towards something hidden, which fits with a recurring issue. Conversion disorder is more about changing symptoms, not finding the root cause. Whereas Histrionic might relate more to behavior, but the symptoms here are physical. Somatic symptom disorder is about excessive symptoms, but the history is about recurring, which could be a symptom of another condition.

So, the most likely diagnosis here seems to be Occult medical disorder (Option C) because it's about a hidden medical issue that's causing the symptoms, which fit the patient's history and symptoms.

The most likely diagnosis is **Occult medical disorder** (Option C). This is because the patient's recurring and conflicting symptoms, along with her history of a long-term medical history, suggest an underlying medical condition that isn't immediately visible. Conversion disorder, Histrionic personality disorder, and Somatic symptom disorder are less likely given the nature of the symptoms and the context of the patient's history. Occult medical disorder fits best as it refers to a hidden medical issue causing the symptoms. 

Answer: C
