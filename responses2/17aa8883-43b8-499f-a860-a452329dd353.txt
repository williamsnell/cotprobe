Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bicycle that's selling for $82, and you can pay it off in six months with a 10% annual finance charge. I need to figure out how much each month's payment should be. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that finance charges are usually interest calculated on a monthly basis. Since the annual rate is 10%, I should probably convert that to a monthly rate. So, 10% per year divided by 12 months would be about 0.8333% per month. Let me calculate that: 10% is 0.10, divide by 12 gives 0.10 / 12 = 0.008333... or 0.8333333%.

Now, the total time period is six months. I think I can use the simple interest formula here. The formula is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. Wait, but since the time is in months, maybe it's better to convert it to a fraction of a year. So 6 months is 6/12 = 0.5 years.

So, the interest would be 82 * 0.008333... * 0.5. Let me compute that. 82 multiplied by 0.008333 is approximately 0.68333, and then multiplied by 0.5 gives about 0.341667. So, the total interest is approximately $0.34.

Adding that to the principal, the total amount to pay back is 82 + 0.341667 which is about $82.34. Now, this needs to be paid over six months. So each month's payment would be 82.34 divided by 6.

Let me calculate that: 82.34 / 6. Well, 6 times 13 is 78, which leaves 4.34. 6 times 0.72 is about 4.32, so 13.72 would be 6 * 13.72 = 82.32. So 13.72 plus a little more for the remaining 0.02. So approximately $13.72 each month.

Looking at the options, option B is $13.65, which is close but not exactly 13.72. Let me see if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula instead. Because the interest is applied monthly, and payments are made at the end of each month. The formula is P = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r ], where P is the present value (the amount owed), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, P is $82, r is 0.008333, and n is 6. Let me plug this into the formula:

PMT = P / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So, calculate (1 + 0.008333) = 1.008333, then raise that to the power of -6. Let me compute (1.008333)^6. Hmm, that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, I can use exponentiation step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1.008333^6. Let me compute it step by step:

1.008333^1 = 1.008333  
^2 = (1.008333)^2 ≈ 1.0167  
^3 ≈ 1.0167 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0252  
^4 ≈ 1.0252 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0341  
^5 ≈ 1.0341 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0433  
^6 ≈ 1.0433 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0522.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator or a better approximation. Alternatively, I know that (1.008333)^6 can be approximated using the exponential formula: e^(6 * ln(1.008333)). ln(1.008333) is about 0.00827. So 6 * 0.00827 is about 0.0496. e^0.0496 is approximately 1.0515. So (1.008333)^6 ≈ 1.0515.

So, (1 - 1.0515) is -0.0515. Divide that by r, which is 0.008333. So -0.0515 / 0.008333 ≈ -6.225. Then, P divided by that gives 82 / (-6.225) → wait, but that gives a negative payment, which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, the present value of an ordinary annuity formula is P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]. So rearranged, PMT = P / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

So, let's compute (1 - (1 + 0.008333)^-6) / 0.008333.

First, compute (1 + 0.008333)^6. From earlier, I estimated it as about 1.0515. So (1 + 0.008333)^-6 would be 1/1.0515 ≈ 0.9515.

So, 1 - 0.9515 ≈ 0.0485. Divide that by r (0.008333): 0.0485 / 0.008333 ≈ 5.825.

So, PMT is 82 / 5.825 ≈ 14.19. Hmm, that's around $14.19, but that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait another approach: perhaps calculate it more accurately. Let me compute (1.008333)^6.

Compute 1.008333 squared is 1.016708.

1.016708 cubed: 1.016708 * 1.016708 ≈ 1.033643, then times 1.008333: 1.033643 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0425.

Then to the fourth power: multiply by 1.008333 again: 1.0425 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0514.

Fifth: 1.0514 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0597.

Sixth: 1.0597 * 1.008333 ≈ 1.0687.

So (1.008333)^6 ≈ 1.0687.

Then, (1 - 1.0687) is -0.0687.

Divide by r (0.008333): -0.0687 / 0.008333 ≈ -8.21.

So, the denominator is -8.21. Then, 82 / (-8.21) → negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use (1 - (1 + r)^n ) / (-r) ?

Wait, let me think again. The present value formula is PV = PMT * [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So, solving for PMT: PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So, PMT = PV * [ r / (1 - (1+r)^-n) ]

So, in numbers: 82 * [ 0.008333 / (1 - (1.008333)^-6) ]

We have (1.008333)^-6 as 1/1.0687 ≈ 0.936.

So 1 - 0.936 = 0.064.

So, PMT = 82 * (0.008333 / 0.064 ) → 0.008333 / 0.064 is approximately 0.1305.

So, 82 * 0.1305 ≈ 10.701 → which is about $10.70, which is not an option here. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think of it differently. The problem says it's paid off in six months with a 10% annual finance charge. So perhaps the interest is calculated monthly, but the total amount is 6 months, with an interest rate of 10% per year, so 5% per month? Wait, no, because 10% per year would be 10/12 ≈ 0.833% per month. So that's what I did earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total amount owed after 6 months considering the interest.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t. Here, P is $82, r is 10% per year, and t is 6 months (0.5 years). So I = 82 * 0.10 * 0.5 = 82 * 0.05 = $4.10. So total amount is 82 + 4.10 = $86.10.

If you're paying it off in six months, you'd have to pay 86.10 / 6 = 14.35. But that's about $14.35 per month, which isn't one of the options either. Wait, but perhaps the interest is compounded monthly, not simple interest. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "a 10% per year finance charge." I think that's the simple interest, so I should use simple interest calculation.

Wait, but wait, maybe the finance charge is compounded monthly. So the interest is 10% per annum, so 10/12 ≈ 0.8333% monthly. Using the compound interest formula: A = P (1 + r)^n, where r is the monthly rate, and n is the number of months.

So, A = 82 * (1 + 0.008333)^6.

Earlier, I estimated (1.008333)^6 ≈ 1.0515. So 82 * 1.0515 ≈ 86.23. Then, since you're paying it off in 6 months, the total amount is 86.23. So each month's payment is 86.23 / 6 ≈ 14.37 per month. So around $14.37, which is approximately $14.35 (option F). But when I used the present value formula earlier, I got something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula more accurately. Let me try that.

Formula: PV = PMT * [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

Here, PV is $82, r is 0.008333, n is 6.

So, [1 - (1 + 0.008333)^-6] / 0.008333 = [1 - (1/1.0515)] / 0.008333.

Which is approximately [1 - 0.9515] / 0.008333 → 0.0485 / 0.008333 ≈ 5.825.

So, PMT = 82 / 5.825 ≈ 14.18. Hmm, but that gives about $14.18, which isn't any of the options. So maybe the problem is using compound interest, which would give a higher amount to pay each month.

Wait, but the question says "installment plan with no down payment, but a 10% per year finance charge." So I think that's simple interest, not compound. So using the simple interest approach, each month's payment is $14.35, which is option F.

But wait, let me calculate it properly. 10% per year is 5% per month. So, simple interest: total interest is 82 * 5% * 6 months = 82 * 0.05 *6 = 82 * 0.3 = $24.6. So total amount is 82 +24.6= $106.6.

Divided by 6 months: 106.6 /6 ≈ 17.76 per month. That's about $17.76, which isn't an option either. So this approach can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see: the question says the finance charge is 10% per year, so 10% per annum. So, the total amount owed after 6 months is 82 plus 10% of 82 for 6 months. But wait, 10% per year is 5% per month. So over 6 months, the interest would be 82 * 0.05 *6 = 82 *0.3 = 24.6. So total is 82 +24.6 =106.6. Each month's payment is 106.6 /6 ≈$17.76. But this is not any of the options. So perhaps the problem is using a different method.

Wait, perhaps the finance charge is calculated on the remaining balance each month, which would be compounding interest. So monthly interest is 10% per annum → 0.8333% per month. So each month, the amount owed is multiplied by 1.008333.

So, the amount owed after the first month: 82 * 1.008333 ≈ 82.683333.

Second month: 82.683333 * 1.008333 → let's compute 82.683333 * 1.008333 ≈ 83.37.

Third month: 83.37 * 1.008333 ≈ 83.97.

Fourth: 83.97 *1.008333 → approx 84.57.

Fifth: 84.57 *1.008333 → approx 85.17.

Sixth: 85.17 *1.008333 → approx 85.78.

So the total amount owed is approximately $85.78.

Now, if you're paying it off over six months, each payment would be 85.78 /6 ≈ 14.297 → about $14.30 per month. Looking at the options, option F is $14.35, which is close. So the correct answer would be F: $14.35.

The problem requires calculating the monthly payment for a $82 bicycle with a 10% annual finance charge, to be paid off in six months. The finance charge is 10% per year, so the monthly rate is 10%/12 ≈ 0.8333%. 

Using the compound interest formula for total amount owed:  
A = P × (1 + r)^n, where P = $82, r = 0.008333, n = 6.  
A ≈ 82 × (1.008333)^6 ≈ 82 × 1.0515 ≈ 86.23.  

To find the monthly payment, divide the total amount by 6:  
Each payment ≈ 86.23 / 6 ≈ $14.37.  

However, the closest option to this calculation is $14.35 (option F).
