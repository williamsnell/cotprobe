Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about figuring out how many students were originally in a class based on some changes during the period. Let's break it down.

First, the problem says that at the beginning of the class period, half of the students go to the library. Then, later in the period, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab. In the end, there are 8 students left. I need to find out how many students were there originally.

Hmm, let's think about the numbers here. Suppose the original number of students is N. So, at the beginning, half leave, which means N/2 students go to the library, leaving N/2 remaining in the class. Then, later, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab. So, from the remaining N/2, half would be (N/2)/2, which is N/4, go to the lab. That leaves N/2 - N/4 = N/4 students remaining in the class.

But wait, the problem states that after both events, there are 8 students left. So, according to my calculations, N/4 = 8. To find N, I can multiply both sides by 4. That gives N = 32. So, the original number of students was 32, which is option D.

Wait a second, let me double-check. If N is 32:

1. Half go to the library: 32/2 = 16. Remaining: 16.
2. Half of those go to the lab: 16/2=8. Remaining: 8. 

Yes, that matches the problem statement. So 32 is the right answer.

The original number of students was 32, which is option D.
