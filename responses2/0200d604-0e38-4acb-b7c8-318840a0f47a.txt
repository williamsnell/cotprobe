Okay, so I've got this question about residual analysis. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question says that there's a least squares regression line fitted to some data, and the equation is y = -2.29 + 1.70x. One particular point has x =5 and y=6. We need to find the residual for this point.

Residual, right. I remember that the residual is the difference between the observed value (y) and the predicted value (ŷ) from the regression line. So it's like y minus ŷ.

So the first thing I need is the predicted y when x is 5. Let me plug in x=5 into the equation.

Calculating ŷ: 
ŷ = -2.29 + 1.70 * 5.

Let's compute that. 1.70 times 5 is 8.50. Then subtract 2.29: 8.50 - 2.29. Hmm, 8.50 minus 2 is 6.50, minus another 0.29 is 6.21. So ŷ is 6.21.

Wait wait, but the observed y is 6. So the residual is y - ŷ. That would be 6 - 6.21. Let me calculate that: 6 minus 6 is 0, but 0.21 is subtracted, so it's -0.21.

Looking back at the options, option B is -0.21. So that's the residual.

Wait, but wait—what's the order of the options? Let me read them again.

Options:
A: 1.70
B: -0.21
C: -6.21
D: -5.00
E: -1.70
F: -7.91
G:5.00
H:7.91
I:0.21
J:6.21

So yes, B is -0.21, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be B.

To find the residual for the point (5, 6), first calculate the predicted y-value using the regression equation y = -2.29 + 1.70x. Substituting x = 5 gives ŷ = -2.29 + 8.50 = 6.21. The residual is the difference between the observed y and the predicted y: 6 - 6.21 = -0.21. 

The correct option is **B: -0.21**.
