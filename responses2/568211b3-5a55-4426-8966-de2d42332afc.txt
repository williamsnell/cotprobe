Okay, so I have to estimate the difference between 999 and 103. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that estimation can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, the numbers are 999 and 103. Both are pretty close to round numbers, which might make the calculation easier. 999 is just one less than 1000, and 103 is just 7 more than 100. So, maybe I can think of them as 1000 and 100 to make the estimation simpler.

If I subtract 100 from 1000, I get 900. But wait, 103 is 7 more than 100, so I need to add that back. So 900 plus 7 is 907. But wait, that's an exact difference. But the question is about estimating, so maybe I should consider the ranges.

Looking at the options, the differences given are in ranges. Let's see. The closest options are B: 200-400, D: 1,300-1,500, etc. My exact calculation is 999-103=896. So that's about 900.

Looking at the options, option A is 500-700, which is a bit lower than 896. Option B is 200-400, which is way too low. Option C is 700-900, which includes 896. Option D is 1,300-1,500, which is way higher. So C seems a possibility.

Wait, but let me think again. 999 is nearly 1000, and 103 is about 100. So 1000-100=900. So the difference is around 900. So the options that include 900 in their range are C (700-900) and maybe A (500-700). But 900 is the exact difference. So which option best represents the range?

But wait, the question says "the difference is between which numbers?" So I think it's looking for the range within which the actual difference falls. So 900 is between 700 and 900, so option C. Alternatively, 896 is approximately 900, so C is the correct option.

The difference between 999 and 103 is approximately 896, which falls within the range of 700 and 900. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Answer: C
