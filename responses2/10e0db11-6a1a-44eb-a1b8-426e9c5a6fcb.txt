Okay, so I've got this question here about converting mass to energy. I remember from my physics class that there's a formula called E=mc² that relates mass and energy. But wait, what's the exact number here? I think the conversion factor from atomic mass units (amu) to energy is something specific.

I recall that 1 amu is equivalent to about 931 MeV. But wait, I've also heard that sometimes the conversion is given as approximately 930 MeV/c², which is why sometimes people use that value. Oh right, because E=mc² would mean that if m is 1 amu, then E would be about 931 MeV. 

Looking at the options, option H is 931 MeV. That must be the right answer. Let me think again. The question asks for the energy equivalent in MeV, so yeah, the mass is 1 amu, so 1 * 931 MeV equals 931. 

So the correct answer should be option H.

The energy equivalent of a particle with a mass of 1 amu is calculated using the equation \( E = mc^2 \). The conversion factor is approximately 931 MeV per amu. Among the given options, the correct value is 931 MeV. 

Answer: H
