Okay, so I've got this question about the vapor pressure of CCl4 and calculating the enthalpy change. Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure relates to the boiling point, and changes can be calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives me the vapor pressures at two temperatures. At 23°C, the pressure is 0.132 atm, and at 58°C, it's 0.526 atm. I need to find the enthalpy change (ΔH') between these two points. Oh wait, I think the formula is ΔH' = (ΔS)(R)/(1/T2 - 1/T1) or something like that. Wait, no, wait—Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = ΔH/(R). So integrating it gives ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Oh right, that's the correct form. Let's get the units right.

Wait, the units of ΔH have to make sense. Since pressure is in atm, volume is in liters, but wait, the units for the equation: let me get the correct units. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). But wait, wait, T should be in Kelvin because we're dealing with absolute temperatures. So yes, I need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin.

So the given temperatures are 23°C and 58°C. Adding 273.15 to each. So 23 + 273 = 296 K, and 58 + 273 = 331 K.

The pressures are P1 = 0.132 atm and P2 = 0.526 atm. So ln(P2/P1) = ln(0.526 / 0.132) ≈ ln(4.0) because 0.526/0.132 is about 4. So ln(4) is approximately 1.386.

Now, calculate 1/T1 - 1/T2. T1 is 296 K and T2 is 331 K. 1/296 is about 0.00338. 1/331 is approximately 0.00302. So subtracting them: 0.00338 - 0.00302 = 0.00036.

Wait, no, wait—wait, because the equation is (1/T1 - 1/T2). So 0.00338 - 0.00302 is 0.00036. So the denominator is 0.00036.

Putting it all together: ln(4) = (ΔH/R) * (0.00036). So to solve for ΔH: ΔH = (ln(4) * R) / (0.00036).

What's R? R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So let's plug in the numbers:

ΔH = (1.386 * 8.314) / 0.00036.

Calculate numerator: 1.386 * 8.314 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.386 * 8 = 11.088, and 1.386 * 0.314 ≈ approx 0.436. So total is about 11.524 J/(mol·K) * (1/K) )? Or wait, let me compute 1.386 * 8.314.

Wait, 1.386 * 8.314. Let's do it step by step. 8.314 * 1 =8.314, 8.314 * 0.3 = 2.4942, 8.314 * 0.08 = 0.66512, 8.314 *0.006 =0.049884. Adding them together: 8.314 +2.4942 = 10.8082, +0.66512= 11.4733, +0.049884= 11.5232 J/(mol·K) * K^{-1}? Wait, no: units don't add up. Let me correct: 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 1.386 is 11.523 J/(mol). Then, the denominator is 0.00036.

So ΔH = 11.523 / 0.00036 ≈ let's compute that.

11.523 / 0.00036 = 11.523 / 3.6e-4.

Wait, 0.00036 is 3.6e-4. So 11.523 / 3.6e-4 = (11.523 /3.6) * 1e4.

11.523 /3.6 = approximately 3.195 (since 3.6 *3=10.8, 3.6 *3.195 ≈ 3*3.6=10.8, 0.195*3.6=0.702 → 11.502). So 3.195 × 1e4 → 31950 J/mol.

So about 3.195e4 J/mol, which is 31,950 J/mol. Wait, looking at the options, the closest numbers are C:26,500; E:40,000; etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try again.

Wait, wait, let me redo the calculation. Let me compute (1.386 * 8.314) first.

1.386 * 8.314.

Let me multiply 1.386 * 8 = 11.088.

1.386 * 0.3 = 0.4158.

1.386 * 0.014= approx 0.0194.

Adding them all: 11.088 + 0.4158 = 11.5038 + 0.0194 = 11.5232 J/(mol·K) * K.

So that's 11.5232 J/(mol).

Now, the denominator is 0.00036 (1/T1 - 1/T2) → 1/296 - 1/331 = (331 -296)/(296 *331) = 35/(296 *331). Let's compute 296 ×331: approx 296×300=88,800, 296×31=9176 → 88,800 + 9,176 = 97,976. So 35 / 97976 ≈ 3.579e-4. So 0.0003579. So around 0.000358.

So ΔH = (11.5232) / (0.000358) → Let me compute 11.5232 / 0.000358.

Hmm, 0.000358 is 3.58e-4. So 11.5232 / 3.58e-4 → (11.5232 / 3.58) *1e4.

11.5232 / 3.58 → let's compute 3.58 ×3.2 = approx 11.456. So 3.2 is about 11.456. 11.5232 is a bit more. So 3.2 + (0.0672/3.58) → approx 3.2 + 0.0188 → 3.2188. So ≈3.219.

Multiply by 1e4 → 32,190 J/mol → approximately 32,200 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 32,000 J/mol. And option G is 20,000. So the closest would be option I. So the correct answer is I.

To determine the enthalpy change (ΔH') of CCl₄ in the given temperature range, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H'}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
The given temperatures are \( T_1 = 23^\circ \text{C} \) and \( T_2 = 58^\circ \text{C} \). Adding 273.15:
\[
T_1 = 23 + 273.15 = 296.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_2 = 58 + 273.15 = 331.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the pressures ratio
The vapor pressures are \( P_1 = 0.132 \, \text{atm} \) and \( P_2 = 0.526 \, \text{atm} \). The pressure ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{0.526}{0.132} \approx 4.0
\]
Thus:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \ln(4) \approx 1.386
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the temperature term
The temperature term is:
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{296.15} - \frac{1}{331.15}
\]
Using approximations:
\[
\frac{1}{296.15} \approx 0.00338, \quad \frac{1}{331.15} \approx 0.00302
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx 0.00338 - 0.00302 = 0.00036 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for ΔH'
Rearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
\[
\Delta H' = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) \cdot R}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}}
\]
Substitute \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), \( \ln(P_2/P_1) = 1.386 \), and \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.00036 \):
\[
\Delta H' = \frac{1.386 \cdot 8.314}{0.00036}
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
1.386 \cdot 8.314 \approx 11.523 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]
Then, divide by the denominator:
\[
\Delta H' = \frac{11.523}{0.00036} \approx 31,950 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \( \Delta H' \) is approximately \( 32,000 \, \text{J/mol} \), which corresponds to **Option I**.
