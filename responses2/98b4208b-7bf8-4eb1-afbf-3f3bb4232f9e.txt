Okay, so I have this statistics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about a large department store where the number of customers served per day is normally distributed. The mean is 3,250 customers, and the standard deviation is 320. I need to find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days. The options are A through J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with a normal distribution, the middle 50% corresponds to the middle part of the distribution. So, it's the range that includes the middle half, which would be from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile, right? Because if you take the lower 25% and the upper 25%, the middle is between them.

Wait, another thing I recall is that in a normal distribution, the median is the mean. So, the middle 50% would start at the 25th percentile and end at the 75th. That makes sense because 50% is in the middle, so the other 50% is split equally on both sides.

So, I need to find the 25th and 75th percentiles. To do that, I should probably use the z-score method. I think the formula is z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. But I'm not entirely sure about how to get the z-scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles.

Wait, I remember that in a standard normal distribution (Z), the 25th percentile is around -0.6745 and the 75th is around +0.6745. Oh wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no—wait, the 25th percentile is actually in the left tail, so a negative z-score, and the 75th in the right tail, positive. So, yeah, around ±0.6745.

Wait, let me confirm. The 25th percentile (Q1) is at z ≈ -0.6745 and the 75th percentile (Q3) is at z ≈ +0.6745. So that's correct.

So, calculating the 25th percentile first. Let's compute X (25th percentile):

X = μ + z * σ
μ is 3250, σ is 320.

So, X = 3250 + (-0.6745) * 320. Let me calculate that.

Calculating 0.6745 * 320: 0.6745 * 300 is 202.35, and 0.6745 * 20 is 13.49, so total is 202.35 + 13.49 = 215.84. But since it's negative, it's -215.84.

So, adding that to 3250: 3250 - 215.84 = 3034.16. Approximately 3034. So the lower bound is around 3034.

Now the 75th percentile. X = μ + z * σ, where z is +0.6745.

So, X = 3250 + 0.6745 * 320. Let me do the same calculation. 0.6745 * 320 is 215.84 as before. So adding to 3250, it's 3250 + 215.84 = 3465.84. Approximately 3466.

So the range is from 3034 to 3466. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option B is (3,034, 3,466). So that looks like the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check if I applied the z-scores correctly. Another way to think is: the 25th percentile is μ - σ * z, and 75th is μ + σ * z. So that's what I did. So yeah, 3034 and 3466, which is option B.

The number of customers served per day is normally distributed with a mean of 3,250 and a standard deviation of 320. To find the middle 50% of days, we determine the 25th and 75th percentiles. Using the standard normal distribution, the z-scores for these percentiles are approximately ±0.6745. Calculating the corresponding customer numbers:

- 25th percentile: \( X = 3250 - 0.6745 \times 320 = 3034.16 \approx 3034 \)
- 75th percentile: \( X = 3250 + 0.6745 \times 320 = 3465.84 \approx 3466 \)

Thus, the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days is (3,034, 3,466), which corresponds to option **B**.
