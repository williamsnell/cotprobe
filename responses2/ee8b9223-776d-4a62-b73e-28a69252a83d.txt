Alright, I've got this problem here about Wiley's Gum Co. and their financials. Let's see what I remember from my accounting class. So, the question is asking for the gross profit and net income for the last week, based on some given numbers.

First, I'll try to break down the information provided. The company's revenue from sales is $16,150. Revenue is the total income from sales before any deductions. Then, they have sales returns and allowances of $150. I think that's how much they returned products or had deductions from sales. So, to find the gross profit, I should subtract the sales returns and allowances from the revenue.

So, gross profit would be calculated as Revenue - Sales Returns & Allowances. Let me do that math: $16,150 minus $150 equals $16,000. Wait, that's $16,000, but wait, no, wait. 16,150 minus 150 is 16,000? No, wait, 16,150 minus 100 is 16,050, minus another 50 is 16,000. Oh wait, no, 16,150 minus 150 is 16,000. Because 150 is 100 + 50. So, yes, $16,000.

Wait, no, wait. 16,150 minus 150. Let's do it properly. 16,150 minus 100 is 16,050, minus 50 more is 16,000. So yes, $16,000 is the gross profit.

Next, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is $9,600. COGS is the direct cost of producing the goods sold by the company. So, to find the gross profit, it's correctâ€”Gross Profit is Revenue - COGS, but wait wait, no. Wait, wait, gross profit is Revenue minus all indirect expenses, but in this case, they've given sales returns and allowances as part of the revenue. Or wait, wait, no, the way I've been taught, gross profit is the revenue minus COGS. But in this case, the revenue includes the sales returns and allowances, right? Because revenue is the total sales, but any returns or allowances reduce the actual cost of goods sold.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The formula for gross profit is usually (Revenue - COGS). But wait, if there are returns or allowances, does that affect the COGS? Or does it reduce the revenue before calculating COGS?

Wait, I think sales returns and allowances are already part of the revenue. So the revenue is $16,150. But the COGS is the cost of goods sold, which is $9,600. So gross profit is Revenue - COGS. So that's $16,150 - $9,600. Let me compute that. 16,150 minus 9,600. 16,000 minus 9,600 is 6,400, and then plus 150 gives 6,550. Wait, no. Wait, 16,150 minus 9,600. Let's break it down: 16,150 minus 9,000 is 7,150. Then subtract 600 more: 7,150 minus 600 is 6,550. So, gross profit is $6,550.

Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, the COGS is the cost of the goods sold, which is $9,600. So gross profit is Revenue - COGS. So yes, $16,150 minus 9,600 is 6,550. So that's the gross profit. But wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake. Because sometimes, sales returns and allowances can affect the calculation. Wait, for example, if you have sales returns, you might still have to calculate COGS as the cost of goods that was actually sold. But in this problem, I think the COGS is given as $9,600, which is probably already adjusted for any returns. So the gross profit is 16,150 - 9,600 = $6,550.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because if the COGS already includes returns, then gross profit is Revenue (already adjusted for returns) minus COGS. Or no, I think COGS already includes the cost of goods, regardless of returns. So if revenue was $16,150, but sales returns and allowances are $150, the net revenue is 16,150 - 150 = 16,000. Then COGS is $9,600. So gross profit would be 16,000 - 9,600 = 6,400.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the definitions. Net income is calculated as Gross Profit minus all operating expenses. But wait, operating expenses include things like rent, salaries, utilities, etc.

Wait, let's read the problem again. They have expenses: Rent $800, Salaries $3,200, Utilities $160, Miscellaneou $575. So, total expenses are 800 + 3,200 + 160 + 575.

Let me add those up: 800 + 3,200 is 4,000. 4,000 + 160 is 4,160. 4,160 + 575: 4,160 + 500 is 4,660, plus 75 is 4,735. So total operating expenses are $4,735.

So, net income is Gross Profit minus total operating expenses.

So first, I need to compute Gross Profit correctly.

If the company's revenue is $16,150, and sales returns and allowances are $150. So, does that mean that the actual revenue (after returns) is $16,150 - 150 = $16,000. So the COGS is $9,600. Then, gross profit would be $16,000 - $9,600 = $6,400.

Alternatively, perhaps the COGS already includes the returns. So if the COGS is $9,600, and the revenue already reflects the returns, then gross profit is $16,150 - $9,600 = $6,550.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach it more methodically.

The standard formula:

Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS.

But in this case, the Revenue is given as $16,150, which is the total sales. But then, sales returns and allowances are $150. So the actual cost of goods sold would be COGS, but that doesn't include the returns. So, if we have COGS as $9,600, then the gross profit is 16,150 - 9,600 = 6,550.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Because the COGS is the cost of goods sold, which is based on the goods that were actually sold. So if there are returns, the COGS might be higher, but in this problem, I think COGS is provided as is, without taking returns into account. Or do I?

Wait, perhaps the COGS is the cost of goods sold before considering returns. So, for example, if you have $9,600 COGS, and then subtract the returns, which are part of revenue, which is $150, so perhaps the revenue is $16,150, which includes the $150 returns. So the adjusted revenue is $16,000, and the COGS is $9,600.

So, in that case, gross profit would be 16,000 - 9,600 = $6,400.

Alternatively, perhaps the COGS is already the net COGS after considering the returns. So the calculation is (Revenue after returns) is 16,000, and COGS is 9,600. So yes, that's the same as before.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about it another way. Let me calculate both possibilities.

Option 1: COGS is $9,600, includes the returns.

So, if the COGS is $9,600, then gross profit is 16,150 - 9,600 = 6,550.

But wait, that would mean the cost of goods sold includes the $150 in returns. But that doesn't make sense because returns would have been part of revenue, not COGS.

Alternatively, perhaps the COGS is $9,600, and the sales returns and allowances are $150. So, the net sales is 16,150 - 150 = 16,000, and the COGS is 9,600. So gross profit is 16,000 - 9,600 = 6,400.

Wait, but that seems to conflict with the fact that COGS is $9,600. Maybe I should think of it as the COGS is the cost of the goods that were actually sold, without considering any returns. So if the COGS is $9,600, and the revenue is $16,150, then the COGS doesn't include the returns. So the gross profit is 16,150 - 9,600 = 6,550.

But I'm not sure. Let me check. Let's say you have a company with revenue of $100,000, and COGS is $50,000. So gross profit is $50,000. But if you have $10,000 in returns, does that mean that the COGS is $50,000? Or does it mean that the COGS would be $50,000 less the returns?

Wait, I think that if you have returns, the COGS is higher because you have to account for the returns. So if the COGS is $9,600 and you have $150 in returns, maybe that indicates that the COGS is higher. So perhaps you have to subtract the returns from COGS to get the COGS as per actual sales.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the basic formula.

Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS.

But Revenue includes Sales Returns and Allowances. So perhaps the correct approach is:

Gross Profit = (Revenue - Sales Returns) - COGS.

Wait, but the COGS is already the cost of goods sold, so that would be:

Revenue is 16,150.

Subtract Sales Returns and Allowances: 16,150 - 150 = 16,000.

Then subtract COGS: 16,000 - 9,600 = 6,400.

So gross profit is $6,400.

Wait, but that's not aligning with the other calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the COGS is the cost of goods sold without considering the returns. So the gross profit is 16,150 - 9,600 = 6,550.

Hmm, but which is correct? I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the numbers. Let me try both scenarios.

Scenario 1: COGS already includes the returns. So, COGS is $9,600, and the revenue is $16,150. But in reality, that's not possible because the revenue already includes the returns. So perhaps the COGS is $9,600, and the revenue after returns is 16,150 - 150 = 16,000. So gross profit is 16,000 - 9,600 = 6,400.

Scenario 2: COGS doesn't include the returns. So, the COGS is 9,600, and the revenue is 16,150. So gross profit is 16,150 - 9,600 = 6,550.

But then, I'm not sure which scenario applies. Maybe the COGS is computed as the cost of goods sold after considering returns. So perhaps if the COGS is $9,600, then the cost of goods sold after returns is 9,600. So, the actual revenue after returns is 16,000, which is the same as 16,150 - 150. So, then, gross profit is 16,000 - 9,600 = 6,400.

Hmm, so which is correct? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute gross profit as the revenue after returns minus COGS.

So, revenue after returns is 16,150 - 150 = 16,000.

So, gross profit is 16,000 - 9,600 = 6,400.

Then, net income is gross profit minus other expenses.

The other expenses are rent, salaries, utilities, and miscellaneou.

Let's add those:

Rent: 800

Salaries: 3,200

Utilities: 160

Misc: 575.

Adding up: 800 + 3,200 = 4,000; 4,000 + 160 = 4,160; 4,160 + 575=4,735.

So, total operating expenses are 4,735.

So, net income is 6,400 - 4,735.

6,400 minus 4,735: 6,400 - 4,000 is 2,400. Then subtract 735 more: 2,400 - 735 = 1,665.

So, net income is 1,665, which is option J.

Wait, let me check the options.

Options:

A: 5,765

B:5,315

C:16,150

D:6,850

E:1,665 (Option J)

F:6,400

G:7,135

H:4,915

I:4,735

So, the calculations give us a net income of $1,665, which is option J.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the gross profit. Because if I had done it another way, perhaps I get a different result.

Wait, perhaps the COGS is 9,600, and the revenue without returns is 16,150. So, gross profit would be 16,150 -9,600 = 6,550.

Then, subtracting expenses: 6,550 - 4,735=1,815.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm. So that suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the COGS includes the returns. Let me think again. So, the company's COGS is $9,600. But the revenue includes the returns. So, the actual revenue is 16,150 -150=16,000. So, COGS is 9,600, so gross profit is 16,000 -9,600=6,400.

Then, subtract the operating expenses (4,735) from 6,400. 6,400 -4,735=1,665, which is option J.

So, that's one option. But wait, the problem says "revenue from sales was $16,150." Sales returns and allowances were $150. So, the net sales is 16,150 -150=16,000.

COGS is 9,600, so gross profit is 16,000 -9,600=6,400.

Then, net income is 6,400 -4,735=1,665. So, option J.

Wait, but why did I earlier compute gross profit as 16,150 minus COGS as 9,600. Well, maybe I was confused about whether the COGS includes the returns or not.

Wait, perhaps the COGS is the amount that was actually sold. So, for example, if the COGS is $9,600, and the revenue is $16,150 (after returns), then COGS would be $9,600, and the gross profit is 16,000 -9,600=6,400.

So, the correct net income is 6,400 -4,735=1,665, which is option J.

Looking at the options, option J is 1,665.

To determine the net income for the week, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Gross Profit:**
   - Revenue from sales: $16,150
   - Sales returns and allowances: $150
   - Adjusted revenue (after sales returns): $16,150 - $150 = $16,000
   - Cost of goods sold (COGS): $9,600
   - Gross Profit = Adjusted Revenue - COGS = $16,000 - $9,600 = $6,400

2. **Calculate Operating Expenses:**
   - Rent: $800
   - Salaries: $3,200
   - Utilities: $160
   - Miscellaneou: $575
   - Total Operating Expenses = $800 + $3,200 + $160 + $575 = $4,735

3. **Calculate Net Income:**
   - Net Income = Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses = $6,400 - $4,735 = $1,665

4. **Verify Options:**
   - Among the options provided, $1,665 corresponds to option **J**.

**Final Answer:** J. $1,665
