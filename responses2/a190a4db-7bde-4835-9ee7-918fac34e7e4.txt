Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about definitions related to security and cybersecurity. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given options is not a correct definition. The options are A to H, and each seems to relate to different aspects of security concepts.

Let me start by recalling what I know about security definitions. I remember that in cybersecurity, there are several key concepts like absolute, reactive, relative, etc.

Option A says: Acting subjects are who or what is acting to produce security or insecurity. That makes sense because the actors in a security scenario are the ones taking action. So this seems correct.

Option B is: Reactive security is the act of responding to threats after they have occurred. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Reactive security is more about the response after a threat is known, not just reacting. So maybe B is incorrect because it's not the correct definition.

Option C: Relative security is when a state or individual is safe relative to others. Yeah, that's what I remember from security planning. It's about safety within a defined group or context. So C is correct.

Option D: Absolute security is when there's no threat. That makes sense because it's the state where everything is secure, so nobody is at risk. So D is correct.

Option E: Referent object is whom or what we act to make secure. This sounds like the subject of action. So E is correct.

Option F: Objective security is when a matter is objectively a security issue. That's about the matter being a real security concern, not just a subjective view. So F is correct.

Option G: Collective security is achieved through cooperation of multiple parties. Yes, that's the concept of teamwork in security. So G is correct.

Option H: Proactive security is preventing threats before they happen. That's the opposite of reactive. So H is correct.

Option I: Substantive content is what being secure looks like and the conditions needed. I think that's right. So I is correct.

Wait, let me double-check each option. The question asks which is not correct. So the incorrect one is B. Because reactive security isn't the act of responding after a threat. Reactive security is more about the response after a threat is known. So B is incorrect because it says reacting is the act of responding after the threat has occurred. So B is not a correct definition.

The incorrect definition is option B. Reactive security is not the act of responding to threats after they have occurred; instead, it refers to the response after a threat has been identified. 

**Answer: B**
