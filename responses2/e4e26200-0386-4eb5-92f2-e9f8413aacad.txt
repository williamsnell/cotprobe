Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a light bulb. Let me see what it's asking. The question is asking for the current through the filament of a light bulb when a voltage of 120 volts is applied and the resistance is 240 ohms. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that Ohm's Law is probably involved here. Ohm's Law relates voltage, current, and resistance with the formula V = IR. Oh right, so V is voltage, I is current, R is resistance. So the formula should be current equals voltage divided by resistance.

Wait, let me write that down. I = V/R. So I have V as 120 volts and R as 240 ohms. Plugging those numbers in, I get I = 120 / 240. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 240 is 0.5. So the current should be 0.5 amperes.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.5 amperes. So that's the answer. Let me double-check if I did the math right. 240 divided by 120 is 2, so 120 divided by 240 is indeed 0.5. Yeah, that makes sense. So the current through the bulb is 0.5 amperes.

To determine the current through the filament of a light bulb, we use Ohm's Law: \( I = \frac{V}{R} \). Given \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \) and \( R = 240 \, \Omega \), the calculation is:

\[
I = \frac{120}{240} = 0.5 \, \text{A}
\]

The correct option is **G: 0.5 ampere**.
