Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 14 equals w plus 23. Hmm, wait, that sounds a bit off. Let me think. Oh, right, maybe it's 14 equals w minus 23. Because if it's 14 = w +23, then solving for w would give me a negative number, but looking at the options, there's no negative number except maybe G: −23, but wait, let's double-check.

The equation is 14 = w + 23. To solve for w, I need to get w by itself on one side. So I'll subtract 23 from both sides. Let me write that down: 14 minus 23 equals w. Calculating that, 14-23 is -9. So w would be -9. Looking at the options, option G is -9.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the equation. The original equation was 14 = w +23. Oh, so wait, that would mean w is 14 - 23, which is indeed -9. So option G is correct.

But wait, looking at the options again, the choices are A:9, B:37, C:−23, D:14, E:−14, F:0, G:−9, H:−37, I:23. So yes, G is -9, which matches my calculation.

The correct solution is G: −9.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Start with the equation: 14 = w + 23.
2. Subtract 23 from both sides: 14 - 23 = w.
3. Calculate: 14 - 23 = -9.
4. Therefore, w = -9, which is option G.

Answer: G
