Okay, so I've got this question about the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question is about how the cost of a basket of goods and services changes from $200 in the base period to $400 in the current period. I remember that the consumer price index measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services over time. 

Wait, the base period is when the CPI is usually set to 100. So, in the base period, the basket's cost is $200, and then it goes up to $400. So, the question is asking about how the CPI changes. 

The options are A to I. Let me look at each option. 

Option A says the CPI has risen 5% from base to current. Hmm, wait. The CPI is calculated based on prices, not the actual dollar amount of the basket. So, if the basket costs $200 in base and $400 in current, the CPI would be calculated as (400 / 200) * 100 = 200. So, it's 200, not 5%. So A is incorrect.

Option B says the CPI equals 100 in current. That can't be right because the base is 100, and the current is 200. So B is wrong.

Option C says it equals 50. No, that's way too low. The base is 200, so the index can't be 50 if it's based on that. Unless I'm confusing the base and the value, but I don't think so. So C is wrong.

Option D says equals 0.5. That doesn't make sense either. The base is 200, so the index should be 200, not 0.5. So D is out.

Option E says the index has risen 200% from base to current. Wait, percentage increase is usually calculated relative to the original value. So, the increase is from 200 to 400, which is 200 increase. So, the percentage increase is (200 / 200) * 100% = 100%. So the index would have risen by 100%, making the total 200. So E is saying it's 200%, which would make the index 400, which is correct. So E would be correct.

But wait, let me make sure. Another way to think about percentage change is (new - old)/old *100. So (400-200)/200 = 100% increase. So E says it's 200% rise. Oh wait, no, 200% increase would mean 200% of the original. So 100% increase would be 200, but 200% increase would be 400. Because 200% is the same as doubling. So yes, 200% increase from 200 to 400. So E is correct.

Option F: equals 200. That's the same as the new value. But the CPI is calculated as a ratio, not the actual value. So the index isn't 200; it's 200. So F is incorrect.

Option G: equals 300. No, that's not right. The index should be 200.

Option H: has fallen 50%. No, it's gone up, so that's not correct.

Option I: equals 400. That would be the actual value of the basket, but the CPI is calculated relative to the base. So the CPI is 200, not 400. So I is incorrect.

Wait, but wait another point. The question is phrased as: "the consumer price index" has what change. So the index goes from 200 to 400, meaning it's 200 times the base. So the value of the index is 200, which is option I. But the question is about the index's value, not the actual change. So the index is 200 now, so I is correct. However, E is about the percentage increase, which is 100%. So E is correct in that the index has risen 100% (which is a 200% increase? Wait, no. Wait, the increase is 200, which is 100% of 200). So, the percentage increase is 100%, so the index is 200, which is a 100% increase from 100. Wait no, wait, if the base is 100, then the current index is 200. So, the increase is 100, which is 100% of the base. So, the index has increased by 100%, making the total 200. So E says the index has risen 200% from base to current. Wait, 200% of the base (100) is 200, so the increase is 200, which would make the index 100 + 200 = 300? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The percentage increase is calculated as (New Value - Old Value)/Old Value * 100. So (400-200)/200 *100 = 100%. So the index has increased by 100%, making it 200. But option E says it's risen 200% from base to current. Wait, no, because the '200' is the value, not the increase. Because the base is 200, so 200 is the new value. So the change is 200, which is 100% of the base (200 *100% = 200). So the percentage increase is 100% (from 200 to 400). So the index has increased by 100%, not 200%. Therefore, option E is incorrect because it says 200%, when it's actually 100%. So, the correct answer is option E? Or wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let me think again.

The question is about the change in the index. So the index went up from 200 to 400, so the percentage increase is (400-200)/200 = 100%. So the index has risen by 100% (from 200 to 400). So, option E says 200% rise, which would imply 400 (base 200, so 200 + 200 =400). So the percentage increase is 100%, not 200%. Therefore, option E is incorrect.

Wait, no, the increase is 200, which is 100% of 200. So the index as a whole increased by 100% (from 200 to 400). So the correct answer is that the index has risen 100% (so the increase is 200, which is 100% of 200). So the correct option would be E, but wait, the question is about the 'change' in the index. So, the index has risen by 100% to 400. So the correct answer is that the index has risen 100% (so the answer is E). 

Wait, but the options are:

E: has risen 200 percent from the base to the current period.

So, wait, if the base is 200 and current is 400, the percentage increase is 200% (since 200 * 2 =400, so 200 is 100% of 200, so 200% increase). Oh, wait! Because the increase is 200, which is 100% of 200. So the index has increased by 100%, not 200%. So E is saying it's 200% rise, which is incorrect. So the correct change is 100%, so E is wrong.

Wait, but the options don't have a 100% increase option. Let me check the options again.

Looking back: 

A: 5% increase. No.

B: 100. No.

C: 50? No.

D: 0.5. No.

E: 200% increase. So that's 200% of 200, which is 400. So 200% increase would mean the index went from 200 to 400.

So, the correct answer is E. Because the question says, "the consumer price index..." which is the index. So, the index has risen by 200% (since the value is 400, which is 200% higher than 200). So E is correct.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services. In this case, the basket costs $200 in the base period and $400 in the current period. 

To calculate the percentage increase, use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Value} - \text{Base Value}}{\text{Base Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{400 - 200}{200} \right) \times 100 = 100\%
\]

Thus, the CPI has risen by 100%. 

Now, evaluate the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The CPI is not 5% of the base value; it is 200.
- **B**: Incorrect. The CPI is 200, not 100.
- **C**: Incorrect. The CPI is not 50.
- **D**: Incorrect. The CPI is not 0.5.
- **E**: Correct. The CPI has risen by 200% (since 200% of the base value is 400).
- **F**: Incorrect. The CPI is 200, not 200.
- **G**: Incorrect. The CPI is not 300.
- **H**: Incorrect. The CPI has increased, not decreased.
- **I**: Incorrect. The CPI is 200, not 400.
- **J**: Incorrect. The question does not mention "falls."
- **K**: Incorrect. The CPI is not 0.5.
- **L**: Incorrect. The CPI is not 400.
- **M**: Incorrect. The CPI is 200, not 400.

**Correct answer: E**.
