Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, the question is about minimizing the cost of a cylindrical container. I remember that cost optimization usually involves calculus, specifically taking derivatives to find minima or maxima.

So, the container is a cylinder. It has a radius r and a height h. The capacity is given as 10 cubic feet. The top and bottom are made of one material costing $2 per square foot, while the side (lateral surface) is another material costing $1.50 per square foot.

First, let's write down the formulas for the volume and the surface areas.

The volume V of a cylinder is πr²h. We know that V = 10 ft³, so πr²h = 10. That's our constraint equation.

Next, the surface areas. The top and bottom together have an area of 2*(πr²) because each is πr² and there are two of them. The side (lateral) surface area is 2πrh.

Now, the cost. The top and bottom cost $2 per square foot, so their total cost is 2*(2πr²) = 4πr². The side costs $1.50 per square foot, so that part is 1.5*(2πrh) = 3πrh.

So the total cost C is 4πr² + 3πrh.

We need to express C in terms of one variable, either r or h, and then find the minimum.

From the volume equation, h = 10/(πr²). Let's substitute that into the cost equation.

So, C = 4πr² + 3πr*(10/(πr²)).

Simplify that. The π in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we have 4πr² + (30r)/(r²). Let's write it as 4πr² + 30/(r).

Now, C(r) = 4πr² + 30/r.

To find the minimum, take the derivative of C with respect to r and set it to zero. 

The derivative C’(r) is d/dr [4πr² + 30/r] = 8πr - 30/(r²).

Set this equal to zero: 8πr - 30/(r²) = 0.

Multiply both sides by r² to eliminate the denominator: 8πr³ - 30 = 0.

So, 8πr³ = 30 → r³ = 30/(8π) → r³ = 15/(4π).

Calculate r³: 15/(4 * 3.1416) ≈ 15/(12.5664) ≈ 1.1938.

So, r ≈ cube root of 1.1938 ≈ 1.06 feet.

Hmm, that's about 1.061 feet, which is option A, C, H, etc. Wait, let me check the other options.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately. Let's compute 15/(4π):

4π ≈ 12.5663706

15 / 12.5663706 ≈ 1.193805.

Now cube root of 1.1938 is approximately (let me think) 1.061. Because 1.061^3 is about 1.061 * 1.061 = 1.1257, then *1.061 ≈ 1.1257 *1.061 ≈ 1.194, which is close to 1.1938. So r≈1.061 ft.

So r≈1.061 ft.

Now, find h. Using h=10/(πr²). Let's plug in r≈1.061.

r² = (1.061)^2 ≈ 1.126.

So πr² ≈ 3.1416 * 1.126 ≈ 3.531.

So h≈10 / 3.531 ≈ 2.828 ft. That's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the radius is approximately 1.06, then the height is about 2.828, which is exactly sqrt(8) because 8 is 2^3. So 2.828 is about 2.828, which is 2*sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828.

Wait, but in my calculation, h is about 2.828. So that's option A. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure. For example, option C is radius 2.5 and height 2. Let me check what the cost would be.

Wait, let me compute the cost for option A.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation for r.

r³ = 15/(4π) = 15/(12.566) ≈ 1.1938.

r ≈ cube root of 1.1938. Let me compute that more accurately.

Cube of 1.06 is (1.06)^3 = 1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236, then *1.06 = approx 1.1236 *1.06 ≈ 1.191. That's very close to 1.1938. So r ≈1.06 feet.

Then, h =10/(πr²) =10/(3.1416*(1.06)^2) =10/(3.1416*1.1236) ≈10/(3.534) ≈2.828 ft.

So the height is exactly 10/(π*(1.06)^2) ≈2.828. That's correct.

So the cost for option A is C=4πr² +3πrh.

But wait, let's compute the cost.

Given r≈1.061, h≈2.828.

Compute 4πr²: 4 *3.1416*(1.061)^2.

(1.061)^2≈1.126, so 4 * 3.1416 * 1.126 ≈4 * 3.531 ≈14.124.

Then, 3πrh: 3 *3.1416 *1.061 *2.828.

First, 3.1416 *1.061≈3.1416*1.061≈3.333. Then, 3.333 *2.828 ≈9.424. Multiply by 3: 28.272.

So total cost is 14.124 +28.272 ≈42.396.

But wait, that's not the right way. Wait, 3πrh is 3 * π *1.061 *2.828.

Wait, 1.061 *2.828 ≈3. So 3 * π *3 ≈3*3.1416*3≈28.274.

And 4πr² is 4 * π *1.126 ≈4 *3.1416*1.126≈4 *3.534≈14.136.

Adding both: 14.136 +28.274≈42.41.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the minimal cost. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the other options to see which one gives the minimal cost.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the cost for each option and see which is the lowest.

But that might take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations earlier.

Wait, another approach: the optimal r is 1.061, h≈2.828. Looking at the options, option A says that. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the dimensions that minimize the cost of the cylindrical container, we start with the volume constraint: 

**V = πr²h = 10**  
Thus, **h = 10/(πr²)**.

The total cost is calculated as:

**Cost = (Cost of top and bottom) + (Cost of side)**  
= **2*(2πr²) + 1.5*(2πrh)**  
= **4πr² + 3πrh**.

Substituting **h = 10/(πr²)** into the cost equation:

**Cost = 4πr² + 3πr*(10/(πr²))**  
= **4πr² + 30/r**.

To find the minimum cost, we take the derivative of the cost function with respect to **r**:

**d(Cost)/dr = 8πr - 30/r²**.

Setting the derivative to zero:

**8πr - 30/r² = 0**  
=> **8πr³ = 30**  
=> **r³ = 30/(8π)**  
=> **r ≈ 1.061 feet**.

Using **h = 10/(πr²)**, we find:

**h ≈ 2.828 feet**.

This matches option **A**.
