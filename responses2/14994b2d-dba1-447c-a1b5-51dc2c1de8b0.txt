B: 30 km
C: 12 km
D: 21 km
E: 9 km
F: 6 km
G: 18 km
H: 15 km

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. Two hikers start heading east. Hiker 1 goes 3 km, and Hiker 2 goes 6 times that distance. The question is about displacement for Hiker 2. Hmm.

Wait, displacement is the straight-line distance from starting point to ending point. But wait, both hikers are moving in the same direction, eastward. So, Hiker 2 is moving 6 times the distance Hiker 1 did. Hiker 1 did 3 km, so 6 times that would be 18 km. So displacement is just 18 km east. But wait, the options don't have 18 as an option. Oh wait, let me check again.

Looking at the options: C is 12 km, F is 6 km, G is 18 km. Oh wait, option G is 18 km. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. What's displacement? Oh, right. Displacement is the straight line from start to finish. But in this case, both walked east, so displacement is just the total distance moved east. So Hiker 2's displacement is 18 km east, which is option G.

Alternatively, could the question be about the distance covered, which would be 18 km, same as displacement here because movement is in the same direction. So yeah, the answer should be G.

The displacement of Hiker 2 is 18 km east. Since both hikers move in the same direction, displacement equals total distance for Hiker 2. The correct option is G.

Answer: G
