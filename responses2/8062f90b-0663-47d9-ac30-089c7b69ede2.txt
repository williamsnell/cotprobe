Okay, so I've got this question about twin studies and schizophrenia. Hmm, twin studies... I remember they look at how genes and environment contribute to traits. The question is about the heredity aspect in schizophrenia, which is a complex mental disorder.

The options are A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think. Twin studies compare identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) with fraternal twins (who share none). So, the idea is to see if the trait is passed down through genes or environment.

Option A says identical twins have a lower concordance. Wait, no, I think identical twins have a higher concordance because they share genes more. So A is incorrect.

Option B claims that environment is the only determinant. That's not right because twin studies show genes play a role. So B is wrong.

Option C says fraternal twins have the same concordance as the general population. No, because twin studies show they have higher concordance than non-twin siblings. So C is incorrect.

Option D suggests schizophrenia is solely genetic. That's not what twin studies say. They show it's also influenced by environment. So D is wrong.

Option E says that the predisposition exists and is genetically transmitted. Wait, I remember that twin studies support the idea that genetic factors are a major influence. The findings from twin studies show that genetic factors are more influential than environment. So E might be correct?

Wait, but some studies have shown that environment is also a significant factor. Like, for example, certain early life experiences or genetic factors together have a bigger impact. So maybe E is correct in saying that the predisposition exists and is genetically transmitted, but with some environmental influence.

Option F says both twins have the same chance. No, because identical twins have higher concordance.

Option G says identical twins have 100% concordance. No, that's not the case; that would mean everyone is genetically identical, which is impossible.

Option H suggests identical twins have no higher concordance than strangers. That's true, because identical twins share genes, so they have a higher concordance rate. So H is correct, but the question is about heredity, so maybe H is not the answer.

Option I says identical twins have the same concordance as non-twin siblings. No, identical have higher.

Option J says fraternal have higher concordance. Wait, no, wait. Wait, earlier I thought that non-twin siblings also have lower than identical. So J is incorrect because fraternal have lower concordance than identical.

Wait, no, wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify: identical twins have higher concordance than fraternal. Non-twin siblings (like half-siblings) have even less. So, for example, identical twins have a 25% concordance rate (if, say, 75% are affected by one gene), while fraternal would have lower, maybe 15% or so. So which option matches that?

Looking back at the options, option H says identical twins have no higher concordance than strangers. That's correct. So that's true. But the question is about heredity.

Wait, the question is about heredity, so what's the correct answer? Let me re-read the question.

The question is: "Citing specific investigations, discuss what the results of twin studies have suggested about the role of heredity in the development of schizophrenia."

So the options are talking about the role of heredity, which refers to genetic factors.

So the correct twin study result would be that identical twins have a higher concordance rate than fraternal. So option H is correct, but that's about non-twin siblings. Wait, no, option H says identical twins have no higher concordance than strangers. That's correct. So if someone raises identical twins apart, their concordance is the same as general populations, but I thought non-twin siblings have lower concordance.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general idea is that identical twins share 100% of genes. So they have a higher concordance rate than fraternal. So the concordance rate for identical is higher than for fraternal. So for example, in a study, identical twins might have a 20% higher concordance rate than fraternal. So option H says that, which is correct. But the question is about heredity, which is about the role of genes.

Wait, but the question is about heredity. So which of the options reflects that.

Looking at the options, option E says that the findings support the view that a predisposition for schizophrenia may exist and it is genetically transmitted. So that's a possible correct statement.

But wait, I thought that twin studies have shown that genetic factors are a major component, and that environment also plays a role. So E is a possibility.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question is about what twin studies suggest. So, the correct answer is probably option E.

Wait, but another point: Option H is correct. But the question is about heredity, so perhaps the correct answer is E, because it's about genetics being the factor.

Wait, but another point: the question is about the role of heredity. So the findings of twin studies suggest that genetics are a major factor. So, for example, the presence of hereditary factors is a key part, and environment as well, but they may be more influential.

So, among the options, E says that the findings support the view that a predisposition exists (so hereditary factors are a factor) and that it's genetically transmitted.

Option H is also correct, but it's about identical vs non-twin siblings, not about heredity.

So the correct answer would be E. Because the question is about heredity, which is about whether genes are the main factor.

Wait, but the initial thought was that option H is correct, but that's about non-twin siblings.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to remember. Twin studies have shown that identical twins have a higher rate of having the same condition. So twin studies have shown that genes are a major factor.

So the correct answer would be that genetics play a role in the development of schizophrenia, and that this is due to heredity. Looking at the options, option E says that, but perhaps it's the twin result that suggests that genetic factors are a major influence.

Wait, let me check the options:

E: The findings support the view that a predisposition for schizophrenia may exist and it is genetically transmitted.

So that's correct. It's a result that twin studies have shown: that genetic factors are a significant component.

So the correct answer is E.

The question asks about the role of heredity in the development of schizophrenia based on twin studies. Twin studies compare identical twins (who share 100% of genes) with fraternal twins (who share no genes). Identical twins generally have a higher concordance rate (a higher proportion of individuals affected by the condition) than fraternal twins. This indicates that genetic factors are a significant component of the development of schizophrenia.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Incorrect.** Identical twins do not have a lower concordance rate; they share genes more, so they have a higher concordance rate.
- **B: Incorrect.** The findings do not suggest that environment is the sole determinant; genes are also a major factor.
- **C: Incorrect.** fraternal twins do not have the same concordance rate as the general population.
- **D: Incorrect.** Schizophrenia is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, not solely genetic.
- **E: Correct.** Twin studies support the idea that a predisposition for schizophrenia may exist (indicating genetic factors) and that this predisposition is genetically transmitted.
- **F: Incorrect.** Fraternal twins do not have the same concordance rate as identical twins.
- **G: Incorrect.** Identical twins do not have a 100% concordance rate.
- **H: Incorrect.** Identical twins have a higher concordance rate than strangers, not less.
- **I: Incorrect.** Identical twins do not have the same concordance rate as non-twin siblings.
- **J: Incorrect.** Fraternal twins do not have a higher concordance rate than identical twins.
- **K: Incorrect.** The statement in option K is not relevant to the question.

### Conclusion:
The findings of twin studies, particularly the higher concordance rate observed in identical twins compared to fraternal twins, suggest that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of schizophrenia. This aligns with the reasoning in option E.
