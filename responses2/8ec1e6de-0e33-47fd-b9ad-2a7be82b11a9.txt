Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the share of GDP spent on the military by Saudi Arabia as of 2017. 

First, I'll recall what I know about Saudi Arabia's economic policies and spending. I remember that Saudi Arabia has been a key player in the global economy, especially in energy and oil-related sectors. They've been part of the OPEC since the early 90s, which means they're heavily involved in international oil markets.

Now, thinking about their budget, I think they spend a significant portion of their GDP on military spending. But how much exactly? I'm trying to remember if there's a specific number they have. I think 1% or 2% is a common figure, but I'm not entirely sure. 

I also remember that Saudi Arabia's economy has been growing rapidly. I've heard that their GDP has been increasing quite a bit, especially post-9/11. If they're growing their economy, they might be spending a larger portion of their GDP on military and other public services. 

Looking at the options, the choices are percentages: 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, 15%. From what I can recall, Saudi Arabia's military expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been around 1% during that time. But I'm not 100% certain. 

Wait, I think there was a point where Saudi Arabia's defense spending reached 1% of GDP, maybe around 2004 or so. After that, their economy expanded, and maybe their military spending grew a bit. But I'm not sure if it peaked there or if it had a decline. 

Another angle: some sources mention that Saudi Arabia has a high level of defense spending, including on military equipment and services. But the exact percentage? I'm trying to recall specific numbers. If it's 1%, that's a solid number, but I should make sure. 

Alternatively, I remember reading that Saudi Arabia's defense budget was significant. For example, if their defense budget was about 2% of GDP, that would make option J correct. But I'm not certain. 

Wait, I think in 2017, Saudi Arabia had a defense budget that was about 1% of GDP. So option A: 1%. That seems plausible. 

The other options don't seem to match my current knowledge. For instance, 15% would be a huge portion, which doesn't fit with their growing economy and increasing defense spending. 12% is also high but not as high as 1%. 6% is somewhat low, and 8% is a bit higher. 

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is A:1%.

The correct answer is A: 1%.
