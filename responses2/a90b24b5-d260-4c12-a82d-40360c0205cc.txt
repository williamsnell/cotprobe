Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about a rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte and how it leads to the release of proteolytic enzymes to prevent polyspermy. The options are a bunch of different reaction types, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in animals, especially in reproductive processes, calcium levels are important. I think I've heard that in oocytes, which are the young cells in the egg, the calcium levels are crucial. When calcium levels are too high, it can cause issues, maybe leading to the release of certain enzymes.

Wait, proteolytic enzymes are enzymes that break down proteins. So if there's an increase in free calcium, these enzymes would probably be released. The question mentions that these enzymes act to prevent polyspermy. Poly spo means multiple, so preventing multiple sperm yeasts, which are the sperm's sperm cells, right? So the release of these enzymes somehow stops the sperm from having too many sperm cells, thus preventing something like multiple insemination.

Now, looking at the options, the choices are various types of reactions. Let's think about each option.

Option B: enzymatic reaction. That sounds like a general term for any reaction involving enzymes. But the question is about a specific event, so maybe it's a more specific type.

Option C: proteolytic reaction. That sounds more specific. Proteolytic enzymes are cleaved from proteins, so this directly relates to the scenario described.

Options like A (polyspermy reaction) or F (fertilization reaction) don't fit. A reaction here is about a specific event in the oocyte. Fertilization is a broader concept, more about the pairing of eggs and sperm.

Options like I (zona reaction) and J (intracellular reaction) don't seem relevant. The question is about a reaction involving the release of enzymes, not structural changes like a reaction zone.

So the key here is that the release of proteolytic enzymes is a type of enzymatic reaction. Proteolytic enzymes break down proteins, so the release of these enzymes is a proteolytic reaction. 

Wait, but is the question asking for the type of reaction that occurs, or what they're called? The question says, "the events just described entail the" â€” so perhaps it's the event itself. Hmm, but the options are types of reactions. Oh wait, the options are the names of the reactions, so the correct answer is C: proteolytic reaction.

Wait, but I thought sometimes the term "zona" refers to something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the question is about the type of reaction, which is the release of proteolytic enzymes. So it's a proteolytic reaction, which is option C.

Alternatively, option B is "enzymatic reaction," which is broader. But since the question specifies the release of specific enzymes, C is more accurate.
</think>

The question describes a scenario where the release of proteolytic enzymes in the sea urchin oocyte prevents polyspermy. Proteolytic enzymes are enzymes that break down proteins, so the release of these enzymes is a type of enzymatic reaction. Among the options provided, the most accurate description of the event is a proteolytic reaction. 

Options like "enzymatic reaction" (B) are broader and include this event, but "proteolytic reaction" (C) is more specific to the action described. Other options, such as "calcium reaction" (G), "zona reaction" (I), and "cortical reaction" (H), are unrelated to the described process. 

ANSWER: C
