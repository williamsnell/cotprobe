Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the standard deviation of total student costs at a university. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

So, the question says that the financial aid office is studying student costs per semester. They charge $4500 in tuition for all students. Then, there are three other variables: books, room and board, and personal expenditures. Each has their own mean and standard deviation. The data is given as:

- Tuition: $4500 per student, but wait, the problem says "All students are charged $4500 for tuition." So that's a fixed cost, not a variable. So I probably don't need the standard deviation for that, or do I? Wait, actually, the problem says to find the standard deviation of the total costs. So each cost category is a variable, and they're independent.

So, the variables are:

- Books: mean $350, std dev $65.
- Room and board: mean $2800, std dev $380.
- Personal: mean $675, std dev $125.

All these are independent, so their variances add when you sum them up. Oh wait, but wait—wait, no. Summing variables depends on their variances. Because for the total, the variance is the sum of the variances of each component, because they are independent. So, the standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the variances.

Wait, let me make sure. The total cost is the sum of these three variables (books, room and board, personal). For independent variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their individual variances. So Var(X + Y + Z) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + Var(Z). Then the standard deviation is sqrt(Var(X + Y + Z)).

Right. So, I need to calculate the variance for each of the three variables, sum them, then take the square root.

Let's break it down:

1. Books: mean = $350, std dev = $65. So the variance is 65^2. Let me calculate that: 65 * 65. 60^2 is 3600, 5^2 is 25, and the cross term is 2*60*5=600. So 3600 + 600 +25 = 4225. So variance is 4225.

2. Room and board: mean $2800, std dev $380. Variance is 380^2. 380 * 380. Let's compute 38^2 first. 38 squared is (40-2)^2 = 1600 - 160 +4= 1444. So 380^2 is 1444 * 100 = 144400.

3. Personal: mean $675, std dev $125. Variance is 125^2. 125 * 125 is 15625.

Now, sum all variances: 4225 + 144400 + 15625.

Let me add them step by step.

First, 4225 + 144400 = 148,625.

Then, 148,625 + 15,625: 148,625 + 15,625 = 164,250.

So the total variance is 164,250.

The standard deviation is the square root of this. Let me compute sqrt(164250). Hmm.

Breaking it down: 164,250. Let me think about square numbers. Let's see, 400^2 is 160,000. 405^2 is (400+5)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*5 +5^2 = 160,000 + 4000 +25 = 164,025.

Wait, 405^2=164,025. But our sum is 164,250, which is 164,250 - 164,025 = 225 more. So 164,025 is 405^2, and 164,250 is 405^2 + 225. Hmm, 225 is 15^2. So 405^2 +15^2 = (405+15)^2 ? No, because (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So 420^2 is 176,400, which is way higher than 164,250. Alternatively, perhaps it's (405 + x)^2 equals 164,250.

Wait, wait, let's compute 405^2 + 15^2 = 164,025 +225=164,250. So that's 405^2 +15^2. But how does that relate to the square root of the sum?

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of 164,250 as (405 + 15)^2? No, that can't be, because (a +b)^2 = a² + 2ab +b². For a=405, b=15, 2ab is 2*405*15=12,150. So (405 +15)^2=420^2=176,400, which is higher than 164,250. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps 405^2 + 15^2 is the same as (sqrt(405^2 + 15^2))^2, which is the same as sqrt(405^2 +15^2). Hmm, but that's not a perfect square. Wait, perhaps it's 405.5^2?

Wait, let me compute 405.5 squared. 405.5*405.5. Let me compute 405^2 + 2*405*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 164,025 +405 +0.25=164,430.25. That's higher than 164,250. So 405.5^2 is 164,430.25. So our target is 164,250, which is 180.25 less.

Wait, perhaps the square root of 164,250 is 405.25? Because 405.25^2 is ?

Wait, let me compute 405.25 * 405.25.

Breaking it down: 405 + 0.25.

(405 + 0.25)^2 = 405² + 2*405*0.25 + 0.25² = 164,025 + 202.5 + 0.0625 = 164,227.5625.

Hmm, that's 164,227.5625. The total sum is 164,250, which is 22.4375 more than that. So perhaps 405.25 + some fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate it numerically. So let's compute sqrt(164250).

Wait, 405^2 =164,025. So 164,250 -164,025 = 225. So 225 is 15^2, so sqrt(164,025 + 15^2) = sqrt((405)^2 + (15)^2). But I'm not sure how to simplify that further. Alternatively, maybe it's 405 + (15)/(2*405) because of some approximation. Let me think: the formula for sqrt(a² + b²) when b is much smaller than a is approximately a + b/(2a). But 15 is much smaller than 405, so perhaps it's approximately 405 + 15/(2*405).

15/(2*405)= 15/(810) = 1/54≈0.0185185. So approx 405.0185.

So sqrt(164250)≈405.0185, which is approximately 405.02. But looking at the options, the last option is G: $320, which is way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe I've confused the variables. Let me double-check. The problem says that the total cost is the sum of three components:

- Books: mean 350, std 65.

- Room and board: mean 2800, std 380.

- Personal: mean 675, std 125.

So, the total cost is books + room + personal.

But wait, no. Wait, the "mean outlay for room and board" is $2800. So that's a fixed cost? Or is it the total cost? Wait, the problem says, "the mean cost for books is $350 with a standard deviation of $65...". So books are a variable, meaning that each student's cost is 350 plus some deviation. Similarly, room and board is a variable (2800 + deviation), and personal is 675 plus deviation.

So, each category is a variable, and their variances add up. So the total variance is the sum of each component's variance.

So, I think I did that correctly. So, I have 4225 +144400 +15625 = 164250.

Wait, but when I computed sqrt(164250), I got approximately 405.0185. So the standard deviation is approximately $405.02, which is about $405.

Looking back at the options, option C is $405, option H is $91. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Let me re-calculate each variance:

Books: 65^2 = 4225.

Room and board: 380^2. Let me compute 380 * 380. Let me do it as (300 + 80)(300 +80). Wait, that's 380^2 = (300 +80)^2 = 300² + 2*300*80 +80².

300² is 90000. 2*300*80= 48000. 80²=6400. So sum is 90,000 +48,000 = 138,000 +6,400 = 144,400. So that's correct.

Personal: 125^2=15,625. That's correct.

Sum: 4225 +144,400=148,625. Then +15,625=164,250. Square root is around 405.

So yes, the standard deviation is approximately $405. Looking at the options, option C is $405.

The problem involves calculating the standard deviation of the total student costs at a university, which includes fixed costs (books) and variable costs (room and board, personal). The total cost is the sum of these three components, and since they are independent, the variance of the total cost is the sum of the variances of each component. The standard deviation is the square root of this sum.

### Step 1: Calculate the Variance for Each Component
1. **Books**: Mean cost = $350, Standard deviation = $65.  
   Variance = \( 65^2 = 4225 \).

2. **Room and Board**: Mean cost = $2800, Standard deviation = $380.  
   Variance = \( 380^2 = 144400 \).

3. **Personal Expenditures**: Mean cost = $675, Standard deviation = $125.  
   Variance = \( 125^2 = 15625 \).

### Step 2: Sum the Variances
The total variance is the sum of the variances of the three components:
\[
\text{Total Variance} = 4225 + 144400 + 15625 = 164250
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the total variance:
\[
\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{164250} \approx 405.02
\]

### Step 4: Match the Result to the Options
The calculated standard deviation is approximately $405, which corresponds to option C.
