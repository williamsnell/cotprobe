Options:

A: Binary 1100, Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D
B: Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D
C: Decimal 11, Hexadecimal D, Binary 1100
D: Hexadecimal D, Decimal 11, Binary 1100

Okay, so I have this question here about numbers in different bases and figuring out their order from least to greatest. Let me see what I can do.

The question gives me three numbers: binary 1100, decimal 11, and hexadecimal D. I need to arrange them in order from least to greatest. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order.

First, I should probably convert all these numbers to the same base to make comparison easier. Since the options have different bases (binary, decimal, hex), I'll convert them all to decimal to compare.

Let's start with the binary number. Binary 1100 is equal to how much in decimal? Well, binary digits represent powers of 2. So, from right to left, each digit is 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc. So breaking down 1100:

- The rightmost digit is 0, which is 2^0 (0 * 1 = 0).
- Next is 0, which is 2^1 (0 * 2 = 0).
- Then 1, which is 2^2 (1 * 4 = 4).
- The leftmost digit is 1, which is 2^3 (1 * 8 = 8).

Adding them up: 8 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 12. So binary 1100 is 12 in decimal.

Next, the decimal number is already 11. So that's straightforward.

Now, the hexadecimal D. Hexadecimal is base 16. Each digit represents 16^n, where n starts at 0 from the right. D is a single digit, and in hexadecimal, D stands for 13. So D in decimal is 13.

So now, all three numbers in decimal are:
- Binary 1100 → 12
- Decimal 11 → 11
- Hexadecimal D → 13

Now, let's arrange them from least to greatest. So comparing 11, 12, 13.

11 is the smallest, followed by 12, then 13. So the order is 11, 12, 13.

Looking at the options, the options are A, B, C, D.

Option B says Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D. That matches our order: 11, 12, 13.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the options. Oh, right, the options are:

A: binary, decimal, hex → 12,11,13 → which would be 12,11,13. So that's not correct.

B: decimal, binary, hex → 11,12,13 → correct.

C: decimal, hex, binary → 11,13,12 → nope.

D: hex, decimal, binary → 13,11,12 → nope.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The numbers in decimal are:

- Binary 1100 = 12
- Decimal 11 = 11
- Hexadecimal D = 13

Arranging them from least to greatest: 11, 12, 13. 

Looking at the options, option B lists them in the correct order: 11 (Decimal), 12 (Binary), 13 (Hexadecimal). 

Answer: B
