Alright, I've got this multiple-choice question about food security. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking what food security is. The options are A to H. I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, I remember that food security refers to the ability to produce, distribute, consume, and consume enough food to meet the needs of a population. It's about having enough food available and being able to get it in the right amounts.

Looking at the options:

A: Ensuring controlled and affordable prices. Well, that's part of it, but I'm not sure if it's the main definition. It's more about the conditions, not the system.

B: Preventing terrorists from poisoning food. That sounds more like a specific threat, not the general concept of food security.

C: Component elements are availability, utilisation, stability, and access. This seems like a good match. It lists the key aspects that food security involves.

D: Developing genetically modified crops. That's a specific action, not the definition.

E: Protecting food from natural disasters. That's a proactive measure, but not the broad definition.

F: Ensuring everyone's access. This is part of it, but I think the question is about the broader system or system's components.

G: Ending micronutrient malnutrition. While important, it's a subset of overall food security.

H: The system producing enough food. Wait, H says it's about producing enough. But isn't it more about ensuring that it's enough and accessible? Or is it the production system?

I: Protecting agricultural land. That's a part of food security, but again, I'm not sure if that's the primary definition.

Wait, the options are asking for what food security is. So the correct answer should encompass the main aspects. Option C lists availability, utilisation, and stability, which are part of food security. It's also about access. So H says it's about producing enough food. But wait, H is part of the production system, but perhaps the broader definition is about ensuring enough food is available and accessible, which would align with H or C.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Food security is about having enough food for people, not just producing it. H talks about producing enough, which is part of it but perhaps not the whole picture. C lists the elements that are part of food security: availability, how much is used, stability, and access. That seems more comprehensive.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is C: Its component elements include availability, utilisation, and stability, as well as access.

Answer:
C: Its component elements include availability, utilisation, and stability, as well as access.
