Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Moroil's morality and the foundational crisis. I remember that Moroil is the author of "The Mor conditioner," which deals with ethics, especially the moral issues of human existence and the universe.

The question is asking what morality described as facing a foundational crisis essentially involves. The options are various ethical theories. Let me think about each one.

First, Moroil's work is known for its critical approach to morality. In "The Mor conditioner," he discusses the moral difficulties of human existence. I recall that he distinguishes between practical and moral morality. Practical morality is about what actions are morally right, while moral morality is about the rightness of the moral framework itself.

One of the key concepts he brings up is the idea of a foundational crisis. I think he's talking about the moral issues that arise as we consider the moral nature of existence. For example, questions about whether the universe is designed by a being or if causation is a moral issue. This seems to touch on the concept of moral responsibility or duties.

Looking at the options, one of them is "prima facie duties." I'm not entirely sure, but I think prima facie duties refer to moral duties that are immediately apparent or without deeper consideration. For instance, if someone is responsible for their own actions, that's a prima facie duty. Moroil seems to be addressing the moral duties that are inherent in the universe, which might fit with option H.

Alternatively, deontological ethics (option F) deals with the morality of actions based on the consequences, like "ought" statements. But that's more about the outcomes rather than the moral framework itself.

I'm trying to remember if Moroil's work specifically addresses foundational ethical issues. He does discuss the moral nature of existence and the role of causation. So, the foundational crisis might involve moral duties that are essential to the existence of the universe.

Putting it together, I think the correct answer is H: prima facie duties. This concept is central to Moroil's argument about the moral responsibilities that must be upheld in the universe, setting the stage for his critique of various ethical systems.
