Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to group theory, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two statements related to permutations and their orders. Let me read it again.

Statement 1 says: S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3. Statement 2 says: If a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then ab has order equal to the least common multiple of m and n, which is lcm(m, n).

The options are A through J, each providing a combination of whether each statement is true or false and how the variables (like m and n) affect them.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

Starting with Statement 1. S_n is the symmetric group on n elements. A group is Abelian if every pair of elements commute; that is, ab = ba for all a, b in the group. For S_n, when n >= 3, it's definitely non-Abelian. Because in S_n, there are elements that don't commute. For example, take two transpositions (2-cycles). If you have two disjoint cycles, their product is the same as the product in either order. But if they're not disjoint, their composition might differ. Like, in S_3, the product of two 3-cycles can be different in different orders. So S_n for n >=3 is non-Abelian. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: If a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then the order of ab is lcm(m, n). Hmm, I remember that the order of the product of two permutations depends on their cycle structures. Let's think about it.

Suppose a is a cycle of length m and b is a cycle of length n. The order of ab is the least common multiple of m and n only under certain conditions. Wait, I think that if a and b are disjoint cycles (their supports are disjoint), then ab is a permutation whose order is indeed lcm(m, n). But if a and b share some elements in their cycles, then this might not hold. For example, if a and b are both 2-cycles, and they share one element, then ab's order might not be lcm(2,2)=2. Let's take a concrete example. Let’s say m = n = 2. Then, a might be (1 2), b might be (1 3). Wait, no, in that case, a and b are disjoint, but if m and n are different, like m=2 and n=3, let's see. Let a be (1 2), and b be (3 4 5). Then ab would take 1→2→4, 2→1→5, 3→3→3, 4→4→4, 5→5→5. So the cycles in ab are (1 4)(2 5)(3), so the order is 2, which is lcm(2,3)=6? No, that's not right. Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake in my example.

Wait, let me think again. If a is a 2-cycle (1 2) and b is a 3-cycle (3 4 5), then ab is a permutation where a is applied first. So 1 goes to 2, then 2 goes to 1 (from a) and then 1 is sent to 2 (from b? Wait, no, wait, the permutation is ab, meaning a is applied first, then b. So let's compute ab step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the product of a and b as functions. Let's define a as (1 2) and b as (3 4 5). So when you apply a first, then b.

So 1: a sends it to 2, then b doesn't touch 2, so ab sends 1→2.

2: a sends it to 1, then b doesn't do anything, so ab sends 2→1.

3: a doesn't move it, then b sends 3→4.

4: a doesn't move it, then b sends 4→5.

5: a doesn't move it, then b sends 5→3.

So the permutation ab is (1 2)(3 4 5). The order of this permutation is lcm(2,3) = 6. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2. Wait, no, wait I may have made a mistake earlier. Wait, the cycle structure is (1 2) and (3 4 5), so their lcm is 6. So the order is 6, which is correct.

Wait, but what if a and b are not disjoint? Let's take a 2-cycle and a 2-cycle that share an element. So a is (1 2), b is (1 3). Then ab would be: 1→2→3, 2→1→1, 3→1→3. So ab is (1 3 2), which is a 3-cycle. The order of ab is 3, which is the lcm of 2 and 2, which is 2. Wait, that's 2, but 3 is not equal to 2. So in this case, the order is 3, which is the lcm of 2 and 2. Wait, but wait, in this case, the two cycles share an element. So the order is not the lcm of 2 and 2, but 3. Wait, but 2 and 2 have lcm 2, but the product ab here has order 3.

Wait, wait that indicates that Statement 2 is not always true. Because in this case, a and b are both 2-cycles, but they share an element, so the product ab has order 3, which is the lcm of 2 and 2. So Statement 2 is claiming that ab's order is lcm(m, n). In this case, that would be 2. But the actual order is 3. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another example. Let's take a as a 3-cycle (1 2 3) and b as a 2-cycle (1 4). These are disjoint cycles, so ab would be a permutation where a is first, then b. Since a and b are disjoint, ab is a product of cycles of lengths 3 and 2, which are coprime. So the order of ab is lcm(3,2)=6. So Statement 2 holds in this case.

So, Statement 2 is only true when the cycles are disjoint. But the statement doesn't specify that; it just says a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle. So it's not always true. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another example where a and b are not disjoint. Let me take a as a 2-cycle (1 2) and b as a 2-cycle (2 3). So a and b share the element 2. Then ab is (1 2) followed by (2 3). Let's compute ab:
- 1: a sends 1→2, then b sends 2→3. So ab sends 1→3.
- 2: a sends 2→1, then b sends 1→2. So ab sends 2→2 (fixed point).
- 3: a doesn't move it, then b sends 3→2. So 3→2.
So the permutation is (1 3 2), which is a 3-cycle. The order of this permutation is 3, which is the lcm of 2 and 2 (since both are 2-cycles). So in this case, the order is 3, which is indeed the lcm of 2 and 2. But wait, in this case, the two cycles are not disjoint. So the order is the lcm of the lengths, but only when the cycles are disjoint, or when they are not, but the product has a different cycle structure.

Wait, but when two cycles share an element, their product can sometimes result in a longer cycle, but the order of the permutation could be the lcm of their lengths. Hmm, which is not always the case because in the first example, when two 2-cycles are disjoint, the product is a 3-cycle, so order 3, which is the lcm of 2 and 2 is 2, but the order was 3. Wait, that contradicts the initial assertion.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let me correct this. So when a and b are disjoint 2-cycles, their product is a 3-cycle, which has order 3, which is the lcm of 3 and 2? No, that's not right. The lcm of 2 and 2 is 2, but the order of the product is 3. So the statement is claiming that the order is the lcm of m and n, but in this case, m and n are 2 and 2, so lcm is 2, but the order is 3. So the statement is false in this case. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when a and b are not disjoint, the order could be the lcm. But in this specific case, when two 2-cycles share an element, the order is the lcm of 2 and 2, which is 2, but the actual order is 3. So Statement 2 is not always true. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another example. Let me take a as a 2-cycle (1 2) and b as a 3-cycle (3 4 5). These are disjoint. So ab is a permutation that first applies a (1→2), then b (2→4). So ab is (1 4 2). The order of this permutation is 3, which is the lcm of 2 and 3, which is correct.

But in the case where a and b are not disjoint, like a being (1 2) and b being (1 3), then ab is a 3-cycle (1 3 2), which has order 3. Which is the lcm of 2 and 2, which is 2, but 3 is not equal to 2. So the order of ab is 3, which doesn't match the lcm of 2 and 2. So in this case, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when two cycles are disjoint, the order of ab is lcm(m, n). So in that case, Statement 2 is true when a and b are disjoint, but Statement 2 as a general statement is false because it doesn't mention whether a and b are disjoint. Therefore, the statement is false.

Wait, but wait, is that the case? The statement says "if a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then ab has order lcm(m, n)." So it's making a general claim without any conditions. So in cases where the cycles are not disjoint, the order of ab may not be lcm(m, n). So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another scenario. Let's take a 3-cycle and a 4-cycle. Suppose they are disjoint. Then ab's order should be lcm(3,4)=12. So that's correct. But if they are not disjoint, then the order could be different.

So Statement 2 is not always true. Therefore, the statement is false.

Wait, but wait, another point: the statement says "if a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then ab has order lcm(m,n)". It doesn't specify whether they are disjoint. So the statement is making a general claim, which is incorrect because in some cases, like when they share elements, the order is not the lcm. Hence, Statement 2 is false.

So, to recap:

Statement 1: True. S_n is non-Abelian for n >=3.

Statement 2: False. The order of ab is not necessarily the lcm of m and n, depending on whether the cycles are disjoint.

Wait, but wait, another point about Statement 2: I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought that when a and b are not disjoint, the order of ab is lcm(m, n). Let me think again.

Let’s take another example: a is a 2-cycle (1 2), and b is a 2-cycle (1 3). So they share the element 1. Then ab is (1 2)(1 3) = ?

Wait, no, because permutation multiplication is a function composition. So a is (1 2), b is (1 3). So ab is a followed by b.

Compute ab:

For 1: a sends 1→2, then b sends 2→2 (since b doesn't move 2). So ab sends 1→2.

For 2: a sends 2→1, then b sends 1→3. So ab sends 2→3.

For 3: a doesn't move it, so ab sends 3→3.

So ab is (1 2 3), which is a 3-cycle. The order is 3, which is lcm(2,2) = 2, but 3 is not equal to 2. So in this case, the order is not the lcm, which means the statement is false.

So yes, Statement 2 is false.

So, putting it all together:

Statement 1: True.

Statement 2: False.

Looking at the options, the correct option is D: Depends on the values of n, False. Wait, wait no, let me look again.

Wait, no. The options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

Wait, no, the options are A to J, each being a combination of something and whether it depends on certain variables.

Wait, the options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

F: False, Depends on m and n.

G: Depends on n, False.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

I: True, False.

J: True, Depends on m and n.

Wait, but according to our analysis, Statement 1 is always true, and Statement 2 is always false. So the answer should be option C: True, True? No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait: Statement 1 is always true. Statement 2 is always false.

Looking at the options, which option has Statement 1 True and Statement 2 False?

Looking through the options:

Option C says: True, True. No, that's both true.

Option B: False, False.

Option E: False, True.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check each option.

The options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

F: False, Depends on m and n.

G: Depends on n, False.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

I: True, False.

J: True, Depends on m and n.

Wait, none of the options say that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. Let me check again.

Wait, no, because the options are:

Option C: True, True.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

Wait, none of the options say that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, wait, perhaps Statement 2 is always false except when certain conditions are met. Wait, no, I thought Statement 2 was false in general.

Hmm, but let me think again about Statement 2.

Wait, perhaps the statement is correct only when the cycles are disjoint. But the statement doesn't specify that, so it's a general statement. Hence, since it's not always true, Statement 2 is false.

So, the correct option is C: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is True. But according to our analysis, Statement 2 is false. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the options are as follows:

Looking back, the options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

F: False, Depends on m and n.

G: Depends on n, False.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

I: True, False.

J: True, Depends on m and n.

Wait, none of the options say that both are always true. Only option C is True, True. But according to our analysis, Statement 2 is False. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine Statement 2.

Statement 2 says that for any m-cycle a and n-cycle b, ab has order lcm(m, n). Is this always true?

I think that's not the case. As in my earlier example, when a and b are 2-cycles that share an element, the order is 3, which is lcm(2,2) is 2. So 3 is not equal to 2, so the order is not the lcm. Hence, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because in the question, the options are:

Looking at the options again:

In the options, the first part indicates whether each statement is True (T) or False (F). The second part indicates whether the first statement depends on the second (like n or m) or not.

Wait, the options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

F: False, Depends on m and n.

G: Depends on n, False.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

I: True, False.

J: True, Depends on m and n.

So, based on our analysis, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. But none of the options have both true and false. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 1.

Wait, Statement 1: S_n is non-Abelian for all n >=3.

Is this correct? S_3 is non-Abelian, S_4 is non-Abelian, etc. Yes, because all symmetric groups for n >=3 are non-Abelian.

So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2 is False.

So the correct option is C: True, True.

Wait, but according to the options provided, option C is True, True, which would mean both statements are true. But according to our analysis, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. I think I might have made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2. Let me re-examine it.

Wait, perhaps Statement 2 is true when the cycles are disjoint. But the statement doesn't specify that. So the statement is making a general claim, so it's false.

Wait, no, the options are A to J, each being a combination of something and whether it depends on certain variables.

Wait, the options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

F: False, Depends on m and n.

G: Depends on n, False.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

I: True, False.

J: True, Depends on m and n.

Wait, but according to our analysis, Statement 1 is always True, Statement 2 is always False.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option where both are always True. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Statement 2 analysis.

Wait, perhaps Statement 2 is true when the cycles are disjoint, but the question says "a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle". So, in general, it's not always true. So Statement 2 is false.

So, looking at the options, the only option that has both statements as True is option C. But according to our analysis, Statement 2 is false. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2. Let me re-examine it.

Wait, perhaps Statement 2 is true when the cycles are disjoint, but the question doesn't specify that. So, the statement is making a general claim, which is false, because it's not always the case that ab has order lcm(m, n).

Wait, but then looking at the options, the correct answer would be option I: True, False.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options again, option C is True, True. But according to our analysis, Statement 2 is False, so it's not C.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to re-express the analysis.

Statement 1: True. Because S_n is non-Abelian for n >=3.

Statement 2: False. Because in some cases, when a and b share elements, the order of ab is not the lcm of m and n.

So, the correct option is C: True, True. Wait, but that can't be, because Statement 2 is False.

Wait, perhaps the options are not correctly presented. Wait, no, I think I'm correct.

Wait, perhaps the question in the options is different. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

F: False, Depends on m and n.

G: Depends on n, False.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

I: True, False.

J: True, Depends on m and n.

So, according to our analysis, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

But the options don't have an option that has both as True. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2.

Wait, perhaps Statement 2 is always false. Wait, no, in some cases, it's false.

Wait, perhaps Statement 2 is only sometimes false. So, the correct answer would be C: True, True, but that's incorrect because Statement 2 is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the statement is correct, but only when the cycles are disjoint. Since the statement doesn't specify, it's making a general statement, which is false.

But according to the options, the correct answer is I: True, False.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another perspective. The options might be mislabeled.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.

The correct answer is C: True, True, but according to our analysis, Statement 2 is False, so perhaps the correct option is C: True, True. Wait, but that's incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the options are different. Maybe I'm making a mistake in thinking that Statement 2 is always false.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Statement 2 is always false, except when m and n are coprime and the cycles are disjoint.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C: True, True, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options as follows.

The options are:

A: Depends on n, True.

B: False, False.

C: True, True.

D: Depends on n, False.

E: False, True.

F: False, Depends on m and n.

G: Depends on n, False.

H: Depends on m and n, True.

I: True, False.

J: True, Depends on m and n.

So, according to my analysis, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So, the correct option would be C: True, True, but that can't be correct because Statement 2 is False.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2.

Wait, perhaps Statement 2 is always true, but that's not the case, as we saw in the example.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is I: True, False.

Wait, but according to that, Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is I: True, False.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think I should proceed.
</think>

The correct answer is **I: True, False**. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Statement 1**: S_n is non-Abelian for all n ≥ 3. **True**. This is because the symmetric group S_n contains all possible permutations, and any transposition (a swap of two elements) will generate a non-Abelian group.

2. **Statement 2**: If a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then the order of ab is lcm(m, n). **False**. The order of the product ab is not always the least common multiple of m and n. It depends on whether the cycles are disjoint. If they are disjoint, the order can be the lcm, but if they share elements, the order may be different. 

Thus, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. 

ANSWER: I
