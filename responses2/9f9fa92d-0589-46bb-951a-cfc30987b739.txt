Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the cost per tire for Good-day Tire Company. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that over the past six months, their expenses were $820,600 and they produced 110,000 tires. I need to find the cost per tire.

Hmm, so I think the basic formula here is to divide the total cost by the number of tires produced. That makes sense because if you know how much it costs to produce all the tires, then each tire would cost that amount on average.

So the total cost is $820,600. The number of tires is 110,000. I should probably write that down: cost per tire = total cost / number of tires.

Let me do that calculation. 820,600 divided by 110,000. Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can simplify this. Both numbers are in thousands, so 820.6 divided by 110.

Wait, 110 goes into 820 how many times? Let me compute 110 * 7 = 770, which is less than 820. 110*7.46 is 820.6 (because 110 * 0.46 = 50.6, so 770 +50.6=820.6). So 7.46.

But wait, that's 7.46 per tire. Let me check the calculation again. Alternatively, I can think of 820,600 divided by 110,000.

Alternatively, I can simplify the division by dividing numerator and denominator by 100, so 8206 / 1100.

Now, 1100 goes into 8206 how many times? Let me compute 1100 *7=7700. Subtract that from 8206: 8206-7700=506. Now, 506 divided by 1100 is 0.46 (since 1100 *0.46=506). So adding, it's 7.46.

So the cost per tire is $7.46.

Looking at the options, option J is $7.46. So the answer should be J.

To determine the cost per tire, divide total expenses by the number of tires produced. 

**Calculation:**
Total cost = $820,600  
Number of tires = 110,000  
Cost per tire = $820,600 / 110,000 = $7.46  

**Answer:** J: $7.46
