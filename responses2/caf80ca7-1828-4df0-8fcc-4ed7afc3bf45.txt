Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about federal powers and which one cannot stand alone to support federal law. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question gives options A through J, each representing a different power. The task is to pick which one cannot support federal law on its own. I remember from my studies that federal law is built on various powers, but some might be more fundamental or foundational.

I think the key here is to recall the structure of federal law. Federal law is typically based on the constitutional guarantees, which include powers like the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. But some powers might be more basic and not derivable from others.

Looking at the options:

A: Defense power — That's the power to keep the country safe, like maintaining national security. I believe this power is necessary because it's essential for maintaining order, which is part of federal law. So it can support federal law.

B: Treaty power — The power to enter into treaties and agreements. That's important for maintaining relations with foreign nations, which is indeed part of federal law. So B can support federal law.

C: Legislative power — The power to make laws. This is a fundamental power, as it's the basis of federal law. So C can support it.

D: Executive power — The power of the executive branch, like the president. This seems more like the controlling branch, not necessarily a power that's independently sufficient. Wait, but the question is about what cannot stand alone. So if the executive is part of the federal system, maybe it's not a power that's independent. Or perhaps it's implied that the executive can support the law, but maybe it's not the only way.

Wait, but the question is which power cannot stand alone. So if the executive can't support it on its own, that would be the answer. Alternatively, maybe the executive can support it, but perhaps without it, it can't. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

E: Commerce power — The power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. That's important for ensuring that the federal government doesn't interfere too much with domestic industries or foreign trade, which is part of federal law. So E can support it.

F: Spending power — The power to spend money on various initiatives. This is more about administrative and legislative functions, but it's not a fundamental power. It's more about the ability to allocate resources, which can support the law.

G: Spending power — Wait, same as F? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's a different option. Let me check the list again. Oh, no, G is spending power. So perhaps F is another option. Wait, the list in the question shows F as commerce power, and G as spending power. So perhaps G is spending power, which is a different option.

H: Necessary and proper power — This refers to powers that are necessary and proper for the functioning of the government, like the executive, legislative, and judicial. These are the foundational powers, so they can support federal law.

I: Taxing power — The ability to tax. That's important for revenue. So I can support federal law.

J: Police power — The power to enforce law, which is part of federal law. So J can support it.

Wait, but the question is which power cannot stand alone. So perhaps the answer is F or G. Let me think again.

Wait, H is necessary and proper power. So if a power is necessary and proper, does it stand alone? Or is it part of a larger system? I think necessary and proper powers are more about what's required to function, so they might not all be independent. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, commerce power. Because the commerce power is not as foundational as the executive or legislative. Maybe it's not as independent. Or perhaps the answer is F, spending power, because spending power is a more procedural power, not a governing power.

Wait, let me think about the hierarchy. The executive, legislative, and judicial are the three branches. But the question is about a single power. So which of these cannot stand alone to support the law.

Option F, spending power, is more about the ability to spend money, which is more about administrative functions than the ability to enforce or control the law. So perhaps it's not a governing power that can alone support the law. So maybe F is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: all powers except for necessary and proper are part of the system. So necessary and proper powers are the foundational, but the others are more procedural. So perhaps F is spending power, which is a more basic power but not a governing one. So if a power can't alone, it's F.

Alternatively, the executive's power is necessary, but it's part of the system. So if you don't have executive power, you can't enforce the law. Wait, but the executive can enforce the law through checks and balances. So maybe executive power can support the law.

Hmm, this is tricky. Another angle: necessary and proper power is H, which is a governing power. So perhaps the answer is F, spending power, because it's not a governing power, and without it, the law can't be enforced. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: the executive, legislative, and judicial are the three fundamental powers. So if one of these can't support the law, it's the answer. For example, is spending power sufficient? Well, spending power is more about allocating funds, which can support the law, but perhaps it's more about the ability to use resources, not enforcing the law.

Wait, but the question is which power standing alone cannot support the law. So if a power isn't part of the fundamental system, then it can't support it. For example, spending power is more about administrative functions than enforcing the law. So perhaps F is the answer.

Alternatively, necessary and proper power is the foundation, but perhaps the answer is something else.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall from what I've studied. Federal law is supported by executive, legislative, and judicial powers, but perhaps spending power is more of an administrative power, not a governing one. So if you don't have spending power, you can't enforce or enforce the law. Or perhaps spending power is just about the ability to spend, not enforcing the law.

Wait, but the question is about powers that can stand alone to support the law. So if a power is a fundamental one, it can support it. If it's not, then it can't.

Wait, the executive power is a fundamental power, so it can support. The legislative is as well. The judicial is too. The commerce power is more about regulation, which is important but perhaps not as a dominating power. Spending power is about administrative functions, so maybe it's not a governing power.

So perhaps F is spending power, which is not a governing power, so it cannot stand alone to support federal law. Because without spending power, you can't enforce the law as effectively, or perhaps it's not a power that can enforce the law. Alternatively, spending power is part of the administrative functions, not the governing ones.

Wait, but the question is about which power cannot support the law. So if a power is not a governing one, then it can't support. For example, spending power is more about administrative functions, so without it, you can't enforce the law. So F is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, commerce power, because it's about regulating trade, which is important but perhaps not as a governing power. Or perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the answer might be F, spending power, because without it, you can't maintain the law through enforcement.

Wait, but the executive power is necessary, but it's part of the system. So if the executive doesn't have its power, you can't enforce the law. So F might not be the answer.

Wait, maybe I should consider that necessary and proper power (H) is the foundational, so it's necessary to have, so it can support. The other powers, like spending (F), are more procedural, so they can support the law but aren't foundational.

Wait, but the question is which cannot stand alone. So if a power is not part of the system that can enforce the law, then it can't stand alone. For example, spending power is about using money, which is not directly enforcing the law. So perhaps F is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, commerce power. Because without that, you can't really regulate business, which is part of federal law. So E can support the law, but F might not.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question is which power cannot support federal law. So which of these powers is not part of the necessary and proper powers.

Wait, necessary and proper are H. So which of the other options is not H. So the answer would be F, spending power, because it's not a governing power.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, commerce power, because it's more about regulation than enforcement. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: necessary and proper powers are the ones that are both necessary and proper. So the other powers might not be necessary or proper. For example, spending power is necessary for government operations but not necessarily proper in the sense that it's not the most fundamental. So perhaps E can support it, but F is spending power, which is more about administrative functions.

I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think of which power is not part of the basic system. The basic system is executive, legislative, and judicial. So any other power is not part of the basic system and can't support. So F is spending power, which is a procedural power, so it's not a governing power, so it can't stand alone to support federal law. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but the question is about which power cannot support the law. So if a power is not a fundamental one, it can't support the law. So F is spending power, which is not a fundamental power; thus, it can't stand alone. But wait, the executive power is a fundamental power, so perhaps F is spending power, which is a non-fundamental, so it can't support.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, spending power, because it's a more basic but not governing power.

Wait, but the question is which power cannot support the law. So if a power is not a governing one, it can't support. So spending power is more about the ability to spend, which is important for the law's enforcement but isn't a governing power. Therefore, F is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another way: The executive, legislative, and judicial are the main powers. So if any of the other options are not these, they cannot stand alone. So F is spending power, which is a procedural power, so it's not part of the fundamental system. Thus, it can't support the law on its own.

So the answer is F.
</think>

The answer is F, spending power.

**Explanation:** The executive, legislative, and judicial powers are the foundation of federal law. Spending power, while essential for government operations, is a procedural power and not a governing one, meaning it cannot support federal law independently. Therefore, spending power cannot stand alone to support federal law.

Answer: F
