Alright, let's tackle this LSAT question. So, the problem says the mean score is 650 with a standard deviation of 45. Only applicants above 700 are considered. We need to find the percentage of these applicants who have scores below 740. And the scores are normally distributed.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should find how many standard deviations above 650 the score 700 is, because that will give me a z-score. Then, for 740, I'll do the same. But wait, the key here is that only scores above 700 are considered. So the cutoff is 700, but the question is about those above 700 who are below 740.

Wait, no, wait. The question says "scores above 700" are considered, meaning we're looking at applicants with scores >700, and within that group, how many have scores <740. So it's a conditional probability. So the total considered is those above 700, and within that, how many are below 740.

Wait, but I think the way to approach this is to compute the proportion of people above 700 and below 740, divided by the proportion of people above 700. Because it's a conditional probability. So we're looking for P(700 < X <740) / P(X>700).

But wait, maybe another approach is to figure out the z-scores for 700 and 740, and then using the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities.

Let's do that. The z-score is (X - μ)/σ.

So for X=700: z = (700-650)/45 = 50/45 ≈ 1.111.

For X=740: z = (740-650)/45 = 90/45=2.

So the z-scores are approximately 1.111 and 2.

Now, I need to find the area under the normal curve between z=1.111 and z=2. But wait, no. The interval is from 700 to 740, but the consideration is only for X>700, so the lower limit is X>700. Wait, no. Wait, no, the problem says that only applicants with scores above 700 are considered. But within that group, how many have scores below 740? So it's the proportion of people with 700 < X <740, divided by the proportion of people with X>700.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, another approach: the probability that X is between 700 and 740 divided by the probability that X is greater than 700.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with a normal distribution, we can compute the probability for each and then take the ratio.

So, first, find P(700 < X <740). Then find P(X>700), and then the ratio is what we need.

Wait, but maybe the question is phrased as the percentage of the applicants considered (i.e., those above 700) who have scores below 740. So it's P(700 < X <740) over P(X>700), or is it the other way around? Wait, perhaps it's the percentage of the group above 700 that has scores <740. So the formula would be P(X <740 and X>700) divided by P(X>700). So, yes, that's what I thought.

But wait, another approach: Let's compute the z-scores for 700 and 740.

For 700: z = (700-650)/45 = 50/45 ≈ 1.111.

For 740: z= (740-650)/45=90/45=2.

Now, using the standard normal distribution table, we can find:

P(X<740) = P(z <2) ≈ 0.9772.

P(X<700) = P(z <1.111) ≈ 0.8665. Because 1.111 is approximately 1.11, and looking up 1.11 in the z-table: let me think. The z at 1.11 is about 0.8665.

Similarly, P(X<700) is 0.8665.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1.111 in terms of the standard normal distribution. Let me think of exact values. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for the exact z-scores, but maybe I can approximate.

But wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the percentiles.

So P(X <700): The z is 1.111. Let me think, what's the cumulative probability up to z=1.11?

Wait, for z=1.11, the cumulative distribution is about 0.8665. So P(X<700)≈0.8665.

Similarly, P(X<740) is the cumulative up to z=2. For z=2, the cumulative probability is about 0.9772.

So the probability that X is between 700 and 740 is P(700 < X <740) = P(X<740) - P(X<700) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107, or about 11.07%.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of applicants considered (i.e., those with X>700) who have scores below 740. So that would be P(X <740 and X>700) divided by P(X>700).

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the total considered is X>700, so the denominator is P(X>700). So the numerator is P(700 <X <740). So the ratio is [P(700 <X <740)] / [P(X>700)].

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. The group considered is those with X>700. So the total pool is all X>700. We need to find the percentage of this pool that has X<740. So it's [P(700 <X <740)] / [P(X>700)].

P(X>700) is 1 - P(X<700) = 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335.

P(X<740) is 0.9772.

So P(700 <X <740) is 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107.

So the ratio is 0.1107 / 0.1335 ≈ 0.829, which is approximately 82.9%.

Wait, but let me double-check because the answer options don't have 83%, but they do have 82.9% as option I.

Wait, the options are:

A:75%

B:86.7%

C:50%

D:80%

E:13.3%

F:60.5%

G:90%

H:67.2%

I:82.9%

J:17.1%

So option I is 82.9%, which matches what I calculated. So the answer is I.

The mean LSAT score is 650 with a standard deviation of 45. Only applicants with scores above 700 are considered. We need to determine the percentage of applicants considered (i.e., those with scores >700) who have scores below 740.

1. **Calculate Z-scores:**
   - For X = 700: \( Z = \frac{700 - 650}{45} \approx 1.11 \)
   - For X = 740: \( Z = \frac{740 - 650}{45} = 2.0 \)

2. **Find cumulative probabilities:**
   - \( P(X < 700) \approx 0.8665 \) (using z ≈ 1.11)
   - \( P(X < 740) \approx 0.9772 \) (using z = 2.0)

3. **Calculate probabilities:**
   - \( P(700 < X < 740) = P(X < 740) - P(X < 700) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107 \) (approximately 11.07%)
   - \( P(X > 700) = 1 - P(X < 700) = 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335 \) (approximately 13.35%)

4. **Compute the required percentage:**
   - \( \frac{P(700 < X < 740)}{P(X > 700)} = \frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \approx 0.829 \) (approximately 82.9%)

Thus, the correct answer is **82.9%**, which corresponds to option **I**.
