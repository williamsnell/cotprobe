Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. I remember from history class that this was a big deal in the Vietnam War. Let me think. The resolution was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1973, right? It was a pretty controversial decision.

I think the main thing it did was allow the U.S. to increase its involvement in Vietnam. Because I recall that before this, the U.S. was mostly a neutral participant in the war. So, they sent a lot of troops but didn't really engage with the conflict to much effect. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution probably changed that.

So, what's the significance? Well, it probably showed that the U.S. didn't want to keep its influence in the war anymore. They were worried about losing public support because the U.S. was doing nothing about it. So, this resolution allowed them to take over more ground, maybe even to have more impact on the outcome of the war.

Looking at the options, option C says it allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam. That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: It triggered a global protest against US involvement in Vietnam. I don't think so. The Gulf of Tonkin wasn't about protests; it was about policy changes.

Option B: Reduced US troops. That's true, but the resolution itself was about increasing involvement, not reducing. So B might be partially correct but not the main significance.

Option D: Influence of public opinion. That's true, but the resolution's main effect was on policy, not just public opinion. The actual change was in the policy, so maybe D is a bit less accurate than C.

Option E: Begin negotiations with Vietnam. No, the resolution wasn't about starting negotiations. It was about intensifying involvement.

Option F: Curtailed U.S. involvement. No, the resolution allowed more involvement. It's the opposite.

Option G: Cursued U.S. away. No, it was about increasing involvement.

Option H: U.S. was neutral. No, the resolution changed that.

Option I: Isolated U.S. from allies. No, the U.S. was actually part of the alliance.

Option J: End of the war. That's a good point, but the resolution was about increasing involvement, not ending the war.

So the most accurate answer is C: It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam. That directly relates to the resolution's content.

The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was significant because it allowed the U.S. to intensify its involvement in Vietnam. This decision changed the U.S. foreign policy by increasing its engagement with the conflict, which was a key factor in the eventual end of the Vietnam War. 

Answer: C
