Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the area of an equilateral triangle with sides of 12 inches. I remember that the formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height)/2, but wait, for an equilateral triangle, the height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem because all sides are equal.

Okay, so an equilateral triangle has all sides equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. To find the height, I can split the triangle down the middle, creating two right-angled triangles. Each of these right triangles will have a hypotenuse of 12 inches (the side of the original triangle), and the base will be half of that, so 6 inches. The height is the other side of the right triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, which says that (hypotenuse)^2 = (base)^2 + (height)^2. Plugging in the values I have: 12² = 6² + h². That would be 144 = 36 + h². Subtracting 36 from both sides gives h² = 108. Taking the square root of both sides, h = √108. Hmm, √108 can be simplified: 108 is 36 * 3, so √36 * √3 = 6√3. So the height is 6√3 inches.

Now, the area is (base * height)/2. The base is 12 inches, and the height is 6√3. So plugging in, the area would be (12 * 6√3)/2. Let's compute that. 12 times 6 is 72, multiplied by √3 gives 72√3. Then divide by 2: 72√3 / 2 is 36√3.

Wait, but I need a numerical approximation. So I should calculate 36 times √3. I know that √3 is approximately 1.732. So 36 * 1.732. Let's do that multiplication: 36 * 1 is 36, 36 * 0.7 is 25.2, and 36 * 0.032 is about 1.152. Adding those together: 36 + 25.2 = 61.2, plus 1.152 is 62.352. So the area is approximately 62.35 square inches.

Looking at the options, option G is 62, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be G.
