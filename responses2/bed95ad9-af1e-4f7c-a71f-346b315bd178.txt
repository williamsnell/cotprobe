Okay, I've got this problem here about calculating the selling price of a stock. Let's see what it says. The last sentence says, "The cost of a stock was $4,200. If its selling price was 85% of the total cost..." So, I need to find the selling price.

Hmm, let me break this down. The total cost is $4,200. The selling price is 85% of that. So, I think I just need to calculate 85% of $4,200. That makes sense because 85% is like 0.85 in decimal form. So, the formula would be Selling Price = 0.85 * Total Cost.

Let me do the math. 0.85 multiplied by 4,200. Let's see, 4,200 times 0.85. Well, 4,200 times 0.8 is 3,360. Then, 4,200 times 0.05 is 210. Adding those together: 3,360 + 210 equals 3,570. So, the selling price should be $3,570.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is $3,570. So that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculation in case I made a mistake. 85% is 0.85. 4200 * 0.85. Oh, wait, another way to think about it: 10% of 4200 is 420. So, 80% would be 420 * 8 = 3360. Then, 5% is 210. Adding those gives 3360 + 210 = 3570. Yep, that's right. So the answer is H.

The selling price is 85% of the total cost ($4,200). Calculating 85% of 4200:

Selling Price = 0.85 * 4200 = 3570.

Answer: H: $3,570

Answer:
     H: $3,570
