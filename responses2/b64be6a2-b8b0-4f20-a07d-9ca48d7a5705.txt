Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the effects of a divided government. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question asks what the divided government frequently results in. The options are various political changes, like amendments to the Constitution, dissolution of political parties, legislative stuff, and so on. I need to think about what happens when a country has a divided government, meaning it's divided into two parts or has a bicameral legislature, right?

Option A is amendments to the Constitution. I remember that when a government is divided, sometimes it can lead to the creation of a new constitutional convention or even a national assembly. For example, in some cases, the House of Representatives might pass laws that could pave the way for a constitutional amendment. So this could be a possible answer.

Option B is dissolution of political parties. I'm not sure about this. Dissolution usually happens in a unified government, not a divided one. Divided governments can have issues with their own parties, but they might not dissolve. Maybe parties can still form, but they might not split completely. So I'm not sure if this is a frequent outcome.

Option C is immediate passage of major legislation. I'm thinking that in a divided government, it might be harder to pass laws because there are two houses. Like, the lower house might wait for the upper house's approval, leading to delays. So this might happen, but it's not the most frequent result.

Option D is delays in confirming ambassadors. Ambassadors are usually confirmed at the bicameral level, but if the government is split, maybe there's a delay because the process is more complicated. So this could be a frequent outcome, but I'm not certain.

Option E is a smooth legislative process. I don't think so. A divided government makes it harder to pass laws because you have two houses. They might have to wait for the upper house to approve, which could slow things down. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F is increased foreign policy collaboration. Divided governments can lead to more collaboration because different parts can influence each other. So this might happen, but is it the frequent result?

Option G is reapportionment of voting districts. Reapportionment is about how seats are distributed in the legislature, which can happen in a divided government. For example, if one party gains more seats, their districts might expand or contract. So G could be a frequent result.

Option H is quick approval of Supreme Court nominees. I don't think so. A divided government would make it harder because both houses have to agree on legislation, which could take longer. So H is probably not the answer.

Option I is reduction in national debt. I'm not sure. In some cases, a divided government might reduce debt, but I think it's more about how the economy works. For example, if one party gains control of the purse money, the debt might rise. So I'm not certain about this one.

Option J isn't one of the options, so I can ignore that.

Let me think again. The question is which outcome is frequent when the government is divided. I'm leaning towards A, B, and G as possible. But wait, the question says "frequently," so which of these is more likely.

Option B: dissolution of political parties. I'm not sure, but I don't think political parties naturally dissolve in a divided government. They might form a coalition but not necessarily dissolve.

Option G: reapportionment of voting districts. This is more about how seats are allocated, which is a common issue in a divided government. So G could be a frequent outcome.

Alternatively, A is about constitutional amendments, which are more about the creation of new laws rather than dissolution of parties. So perhaps G is more directly related to the structure of the government.

Wait, the question is about the effects. Reapportionment (G) is about how seats are allocated, which is a common issue in a divided government. So when a country is divided, how do they allocate seats in the legislature? That's a frequent issue, so G would be a frequent result.

So the answer is G: reapportionment of voting districts.

The answer is G: reapportionment of voting districts.

The reapportionment of voting districts is a common issue in a divided government, where seats in the legislature are allocated based on population or other criteria. This is a frequent outcome, as it is a key aspect of how power is distributed within the political structure.

Answer: G
