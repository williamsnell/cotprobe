Okay, so I've got this question about negative externalities in the market. Hmm, I remember that externalities are when someone's actions affect others without their consent, which can cause problems in the economy. But wait, what's a negative externality specifically?

Right, a negative externality occurs when the actions of a firm or individual cause harm to others. Like, if someone drives too fast and causes traffic congestion, that's a negative externality because it affects society's welfare.

The question is asking when a negative externality exists. So I need to figure out what condition indicates that.

Let me think about the options. The options are A through H, each a different scenario.

Option A: Spillover benefits are received by society. Wait, spillover benefits are when benefits are shared. Like, if a factory's pollution benefits both the environment and the people nearby. But how does this relate to externalities? I think a negative externality is when the effect is bad, so if the factory's pollution is bad, it's a negative externality. So maybe A is not the right answer.

Option B: Total welfare is maximized. That's more about the market outcome. If the market is efficient, it maximizes welfare. But externalities cause market failures, so without them, the market may not be efficient. So I don't think B is correct because externalities exist even if the market isn't perfectly efficient.

Option C: Marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost. Oh wait, that sounds familiar. In the presence of externalities, the market usually doesn't achieve the socially optimal level because the private costs and benefits don't account for the externalities. So the private market may have a surplus or deficit, leading to overproduction or underproduction. The only time when the market reaches the socially optimal point is when the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost. So C seems correct. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D: Marginal private benefit equals marginal social cost. Hmm. So this is about the private market allocation. If the private market price equals the marginal social cost, then that's the efficient point. Because the private benefit is what the market would get, but social cost includes the external costs. So D would be true when the market is efficient, but the question is about externalities existing. So if externalities exist, the market doesn't reach that efficient point. So D would be correct under efficient conditions, but the question is about the existence of externalities. So D is a condition that's true when externalities are present? No, wait, no. If externalities exist, the market usually doesn't reach that point because the private benefit and cost don't include the externalities. So D is only true when the externality is internalized perfectly, which isn't the case here. So D is not the right answer for the question.

Option E: Market overallocates resources. That's the opposite of what I was thinking earlier. If the market overallocates, then the private benefits are more than the social costs. Wait, but with externalities, the market might under-allocate or over-allocate?

Wait, think about a factory emitting pollution. Suppose the private marginal benefit of reducing emissions is higher than the cost of the pollution. The market would produce more emissions because the private benefits are greater than the private costs. But society's total benefit includes the external costs, so the market's production is less than the socially optimal. So the market overallocates resources to the production (i.e., overproduces). So E says the market overallocates. That's correct according to the concept of negative externalities. Because the private market's choice is not efficient.

Option F: Total welfare is minimized. That's the opposite of E. If the market is overallocating, like in E, then total welfare is lower than socially optimal. So F is the opposite scenario. So F is not correct.

Option G: Total welfare is minimized. So when the market is overallocating, welfare is lower. So G is the opposite of E. So G is not correct.

Option H: Market underallocates resources. So underallocation would mean the private market is producing more than socially optimal. Wait, underallocating would be overproducing? Or under producing? Let me think. If externalities are present, the market might underproduce because the private benefit is not enough to offset the cost. Or perhaps the opposite. I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: externalities can lead to market outcomes either under or over.

Suppose that an industry's production of a good produces negative spillovers. So the social cost is higher than the private cost. The private market might produce more than the socially optimal because the private benefits are higher than the social costs. So the market would overproduce.

Alternatively, if the production causes positive externalities, the private costs are lower than the social costs, leading to underproduction.

In both cases, the market's choice (over or under) depends on the nature of the externality. But the question is about negative externalities, so negative impact.

So the market's choice is that it overallocates resources to the production of this good, because the private benefits (for the good) are more than the social costs. So E says "the market overallocates resources to the production of this good." That's correct.

Wait, but another point: when a negative externality exists, the market's private benefits don't include the costs to others. So the market's private marginal cost (and benefit) would not include the external costs. Therefore, the market's decisions would lead the production to be such that private marginal benefit is higher than social marginal cost. Which would lead to overproduction.

So E is the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let's make sure. The question is, which condition indicates a negative externality exists.

A negative externality is when a good's production causes negative effects on society, like pollution. So when does that happen? It happens when the private market doesn't take into account the external costs or benefits.

So which of the options states when that happens?

Option D: The marginal private benefit equals the marginal social cost. Wait, that's the efficient point. So when does a negative externality exist? When the market's private marginal benefit doesn't match the social marginal cost, leading to over or under production.

Alternatively, when the market is not efficient because of externalities. So negative externality exists when the private market doesn't produce optimally due to the externalities.

So the answer is when the market under or overallocates resources, which is E and H? Or D?

Wait, I thought that a negative externality's existence is when the market's allocation isn't efficient because of external costs.

So the condition that leads to negative externality is when the market underallocates or overallocates resources, which is E and H.

But the question is asking which condition exists when a negative externality exists.

Looking at the options: Which condition is correct.

Wait, the existence of a negative externality is when the market allocates resources in a way that doesn't account for the external costs or benefits.

So when does that happen? That's when the market overallocates or underallocates resources, which is E and H.

But the options are A to H, each a different condition.

But the question is phrased: "A negative externality in the market exists when..." So the correct condition is E or H.

Wait, let me see. The question is asking when a negative externality exists. It's not asking for the condition for its existence.

So which condition is true when a negative externality exists.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In a market where a negative externality exists, the private marginal benefit doesn't equal the social marginal cost. So the private market is producing more than socially optimal, but that's when the market is overallocating.

Alternatively, the condition that leads to externalities is when the private marginal benefit is not equal to the social marginal cost. So D is when the market is efficient, but negative externalities cause the market to not reach that.

Wait, no. The question is about when a negative externality exists. So the correct answer is when the market is allocated inefficiently due to externalities. So the correct condition is E: the market overallocates resources.

Wait no, I think I had this right earlier. So the correct answer is E. But wait, let's look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

E: the market overallocates resources.

H: the market underallocates resources.

So the question is, when a negative externality exists, which of these is true.

The presence of a negative externality causes the market not to reach the efficient level. So it's the opposite of D, which is when it's efficient.

So the correct condition is E is when the market overallocates, leading to inefficient outcome because the private benefits are higher than social costs.

Alternatively, if the market underallocates, as in H, that's the case when private costs (for the good) are higher than social costs.

Wait, the question is about negative externalities. So the market is not allocating optimally because of the negative externality.

So the question's options are about what occurs when a negative externality exists. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "A negative externality in the market for a good exists when..."

So the condition is E or H.

Wait, but I think I remember that when a negative externality exists, the market underallocates resources. Because the private marginal benefit is higher than the social marginal cost. So the market would produce more than the socially optimal level. That's E.

Wait, but in one scenario, the private marginal benefit (which is the market's "internal" marginal benefit) is higher than the social marginal cost. That leads to overproduction.

In another scenario, if the private marginal cost is higher than the social marginal cost, the market would produce less than socially optimal.

So the question is, when negative externality exists, the market allocates resources in a way that doesn't account for the externalities, leading to inefficient outcomes.

So the condition is E: the market overallocates resources.

But wait, another thought: the correct condition for a negative externality is when the private marginal benefit is greater than the social marginal cost, leading to overproduction. So E is correct because that's when the market overallocates resources.

Alternatively, if the private marginal cost is lower than the social marginal cost, the market underallocates resources, which is H.

So the question's wording is which of the options is correct when a negative externality exists.

So, when negative externality exists, the market allocates resources in a way that doesn't account for the externalities, leading to inefficient outcomes. So the condition is E: overallocates.

Wait, the question is: "A negative externality in the market for a good exists when..."

So when the market is overallocating, that's E.

But wait, another thought: for a negative externality, the private marginal benefit is higher than the social marginal cost, leading to overproduction. The market would produce more than the socially optimal level. So the condition is E.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about the options again.

Another way: negative externality exists when the marginal social benefit is less than the private marginal benefit. Wait, no, that's when the market is underproducing because the private benefit (what the market would get) is less than the social benefit (which includes external benefits). So in that case, the market is underallocating resources.

Wait, but I'm getting tangled. Let me think about the most basic definition.

A negative externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good produces a benefit or cost that affects others, and that effect is not reflected in the market price or the individual's private cost/benefit.

So the market doesn't take into account the external costs or benefits. The private market may produce more than socially optimal, leading to overproduction.

So the question is, which condition is true when a negative externality exists. So the condition is E: the market overallocates resources.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

A negative externality exists when the market allocation of resources does not account for the external costs or benefits of production or consumption. This leads to inefficiency because the market does not produce the socially optimal quantity of goods. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** is incorrect because spillover benefits do not inherently cause negative externalities; negative externalities are about costs or benefits not being shared among society.
- **Option B** is incorrect because total welfare being maximized is the condition for an efficient market, not the presence of externalities.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the equality of marginal social benefit and marginal social cost (MBS and MSB) is the condition for efficient allocation, not the presence of externalities.
- **Option D** is incorrect because D refers to the efficient allocation, not the existence of externalities.
- **Option E** is correct. A negative externality exists when the market overallocates resources to the production of the good. This occurs because the private marginal benefit (what the market would receive) is greater than the social marginal cost (what society would receive), leading to overproduction.
- **Option F** is incorrect because total welfare is minimized only when the market underallocates resources, not when externalities exist.
- **Option G** is incorrect because it describes the opposite scenario of E.
- **Option H** is incorrect because H refers to underallocating resources, which is not the case when externalities exist.
- **Option I** and **Options J-K** are irrelevant to the question.

The correct answer is **E: the market overallocates resources to the production of this good**.
