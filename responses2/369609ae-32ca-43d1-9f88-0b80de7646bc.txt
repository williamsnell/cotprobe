Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about John Hobbes and his philosophy. The question is about what Felicity is, according to him. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that Hobbes was a philosopher, and his work is often considered part of the later development of political philosophy. His major work is "Leviathan," which deals with ethics and the moral philosophy of the state.

The question is asking about "felicity," which I think refers to the state of being happy, satisfied, or content. In Hobbes's terms, he's known for his critical views on human nature and how society should be organized.

Looking at the options:

A: the absence of desire. Hmm, so if someone has no desire, they're not motivated. But Hobbes didn't think in terms of absence; he focused on the contentment he had. So this might not be it.

B: a state of constant dissatisfaction. That sounds like the opposite of what I'm thinking. If someone is constantly dissatisfied, that's the opposite of felicity.

C: a state of constant change. Hobbes was critical of change because he believed that society should be stable and regulated. Change might be viewed negatively by him, so this might not be the right term.

D: the absence of progress. Progress for Hobbes was about gaining more, so absence of progress would mean not having made any gains. That's not Felicity's point.

E: a state of satisfaction with one's current state. Oh, this sounds familiar. I think in "Leviathan," Hobbes talked about the state of being "unsatisfied" but in a way that's actually contentment. He believed that true happiness comes from being in balance, not needing more.

F: the fulfilment of all desires. That's a bit different. Fulfillment of all desires might be a way of saying you're happy, but in the context of Hobbes, I think he was more focused on the moral and ethical aspect rather than the literal fulfillment of all desires.

G: a continual progress of desire from one object to another. So, continuously wanting more of something. That's more about the desire-driven nature of happiness, which Hobbes might not have emphasized as much.

H: the ability to control one's desires. That's more of a psychological concept, not necessarily Hobbes's primary focus.

I: a state of tranquility. That's more of a contemporary term. Hobbes didn't use that.

J: a state of contemplation. Again, more of a modern concept.

So, putting it together, the correct answer is E. Felicity, in Hobbes's view, is about being in a state where all desires are fulfilled, which he sees as the absence of dissatisfaction. So, E is the best choice.

The correct answer is E: a state of satisfaction with one's current state.

Answer: E
