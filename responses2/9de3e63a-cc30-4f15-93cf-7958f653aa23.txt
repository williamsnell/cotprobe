Okay, so I've got this question about finding the determinant of a matrix. The matrix A is given as [2 3; 1 2]. Hmm, determinants, right? I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is calculated in a specific way. Let me think about the formula. Oh yes, the determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc. 

So in this case, the matrix is [[2, 3], [1, 2]]. Applying the formula, it would be (2 * 2) minus (3 * 1). Let me compute that: 2*2 is 4, and 3*1 is 3. Subtracting, 4 - 3 equals 1. So the determinant is 1. Looking at the options, option G is 1. 

Wait, did I get that right? Let me double-check. Oh yeah, determinant formula is ad - bc. The matrix is top row 2 and 3, bottom row 1 and 2. So 2*2=4, 3*1=3. 4-3 is 1. Yep, that's correct. I think that's it.

The determinant of matrix A is calculated as (2*2) - (3*1) = 4 - 3 = 1. 

Answer: G
