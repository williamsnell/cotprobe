Okay, so I have this question about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Hmm, I remember that Maslow's theory is all about why people are motivated. Let me think about what he said. I think it's a hierarchy, right? So it goes from the lowest to the highest level of needs.

The question is asking what each person is motivated by according to this theory. The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: "solely by their physical needs." That doesn't sound right. I remember that the hierarchy is more than just physical needs. There are higher levels too, like safety, love, and finally, self-actualization.

Option B: "striving for self-actualization and personal growth." Oh wait, that does sound like a part of the hierarchy. After the physical needs, society places higher demands.

Option C: "primary (physical) and secondary (emotional) needs." That's part of it, but the full hierarchy has more levels. So maybe this is not the complete answer.

Option D: "a constant state of dissatisfaction." I'm not sure. Maybe that's more about satisfaction rather than the needs themselves.

Option E: "desire for power and dominance over others." That's more about self-interested motivations, not the hierarchy of needs as understood by Maslow.

Option F: "need to fulfill societal expectations." This seems related to the higher needs, like safety or security, but again, it's more about the purpose or fulfillment beyond just needing the basic needs.

Option G: "motivation is derived from the fear of failing to meet needs." That's a bit vague. I think Maslow's theory is more about the hierarchy rather than fear.

Option H: "motivation is derived from the fear of failing to meet needs." Wait, I think he said that people are motivated by their needs. So maybe this is correct, but it's not the complete picture.

Option I: "desire to achieve in the eyes of others." That's more about social recognition and respect, which might be part of the hierarchy, but I'm not sure if it's the main focus.

Option J: "satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy." Wait, I thought the hierarchy is more than just the steps. So this might not capture the entire picture.

Wait, I should think again. The full hierarchy has several levels, not just physical and emotional. The classic levels are: Basic Needs, Social Needs, Personal Needs, Intuitive Needs, Drive Needs, Integral Needs, and Self-Actualization.

So the question is about what each person is motivated by. The primary needs are the basic ones, like food and shelter. Secondary includes things like safety and love. Then comes self-actualization. So the question is, what is the theory's basis? Each person is motivated by meeting these levels in order. So, the first step is physical needs.

But looking at the options, option B says striving for self-actualization and personal growth. That's part of the hierarchy. So the question is phrased as "what each person is motivated by," not what they do. So the answer should be the highest level, which is self-actualization.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "each person is motivated by what?" So the theory states that each person is motivated by meeting each level in order. So the highest level is self-actualization.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is about striving for self-actualization. So then the correct answer is B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The hierarchy is: Basic needs (physical, safety, love, integral), then Social, then Personal, then Drive, then Integral. So the last is self-actualization. So each level is a step up, so the motivation is about meeting each step. So the question is about what they're motivated by, which is the hierarchy.

So the options are: each person is motivated by the hierarchy. So the highest level is self-actualization. So the correct answer would be the highest level. Looking at the options, option B says striving for self-actualization and personal growth, which is the fifth level.

Wait, but the options given are A to J. Let me read each option again.

A: solely physical – no, because higher needs come after.

B: striving for self-actualization and personal growth – that's the highest.

C: primary (physical) and secondary (emotional) – not the full picture.

D: dissatisfaction – that's about feeling satisfied, but not the structure.

E: power – more about self-interest.

F: societal expectations – related to higher needs.

G: inner self – that's about self-perception, not the hierarchy.

H: fear of failing – not the basis.

I: desire to achieve in others – more about social.

J: next step – not the full hierarchy.

So the correct answer should be B, because it's about striving for self-actualization and personal growth, which are the highest levels of Maslow's hierarchy.

The correct answer is B: striving for self-actualization and personal growth. 

Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs outlines a progression of requirements that drive human motivation. The highest level of need is self-actualization, which involves pursuing one's own goals and aspirations. This level is often referred to as "self-actualization" and is the last in the hierarchy. Each successive level builds on the previous one, culminating in self-actualization. Therefore, each person is motivated by meeting these higher levels, with self-actualization being the most significant goal.
