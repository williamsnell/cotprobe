B: Influenza
C: Pertussis
D: Poliomyelitis

Okay, so I've got this question about a child who's having an emergency, and I need to figure out which vaccine to choose based on the symptoms. Let's see. The child is 13 months old and has urticaria, lips swelling, and difficulty breathing after eating an egg. Those symptoms point towards an upset stomach or maybe something related to allergies.

The question is about a potential risk from vaccination—so it's about which vaccine's ingredient can trigger a hypersensitivity reaction, which is a type of immunosuppression. Hypersensitivity is when the immune system is too strong and doesn't respond properly to a foreign substance, leading to symptoms like swelling, difficulty breathing, etc.

Looking at the options: A is Hepatitis, B is Influenza, C is Pertussis, D is Polio. I remember that each of these vaccines has different ingredients and can cause immune reactions.

Hepatitis A and B are common vaccines. Hepatitis B is a particularly strong one because it's a highly immunogenic virus. Pertussis (HIV) is the flu, and its vaccines are generally mild, but they can still cause mild reactions. Polio is a vaccine that's been eradicated, so its use is less common, but I'm not sure about the specific reactions.

The child's symptoms after eating an egg. Eggs are a common allergen, but so are dairy products, nuts, and certain other foods. Eggs are usually not a high-risk allergen, but other foods can trigger reactions.

So the question is which vaccine's ingredient is a potential cause for hypersensitivity. I think that Pertussis (HIV) is the worst among these. Because even though its vaccines are generally safe, their components can cause mild allergic reactions. So if someone gets the Pertussis vaccine, they might have a reaction that could explain the child's symptoms.

Wait, but wait—what about Hepatitis B? I think Hepatitis B is more immunogenic than other viruses but not as severe. Pertussis is worse. So the correct answer would be C: Pertussis.

The child's symptoms, including urticaria, lips swelling, and difficulty breathing after eating an egg, suggest an allergy or hypersensitivity reaction. The question asks which vaccine's ingredient could cause this reaction.

- **A: Hepatitis** is a strong immunogenic virus, but its vaccines are generally safe. It can cause mild allergic reactions.
- **B: Influenza** is a mild virus, and its vaccines are typically less immunogenic, so they are less likely to cause hypersensitivity.
- **C: Pertussis (HIV)** is the worst among the options, as its vaccines are generally safe but can cause mild allergic reactions. Since eggs are not a high-risk allergen, this is the most likely candidate.
- **D: Polio** has been eradicated, so its use is less common, but it's unlikely to cause hypersensitivity.

The correct answer is **C: Pertussis**, as its vaccines can trigger hypersensitivity reactions. 

Answer: C
