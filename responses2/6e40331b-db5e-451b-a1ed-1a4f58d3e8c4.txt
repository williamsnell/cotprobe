Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a philosophy text by Nathanson. The question is asking about a message he argues we can send by abolishing the death penalty. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall what I know about Nathanson's arguments. I remember that Nathanson is a philosopher known for his work on criminal justice. I think he's critical of the death penalty because it can be too harsh and doesn't address the underlying issues of murder, which is the highest crime.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: We believe in the possibility of redemption and change. I'm not sure how directly this relates to abolishing the death penalty. Maybe it's more about the idea that people can change, but I don't recall Nathanson making this a primary argument against the death penalty.

Option B: There are some penalties worse than death. So, he's saying that there are more severe penalties than the death penalty. That sounds like he's pointing out that the death penalty isn't the best solution because it's harsher than necessary. But does that mean abolishing it? Maybe, but I'm not certain if this is the main argument.

Option C: We are unable to administer justice effectively. This seems a bit off. If the death penalty is abolished, wouldn't that make administering justice easier? I don't think this is the primary point he's making here.

Option D: There is no punishment that is proportional to murder. That makes a lot of sense. Nathanson argues that the death penalty isn't proportional for murder. So, if we stop using it, then murder (and other higher crimes) would have a more appropriate punishment. So, this seems to be a strong candidate.

Option E: There is always a possibility of judicial errors. Well, that's more of a probability-based argument. It's about the limitations of the system, but not necessarily the main point when considering the abolition of the death penalty.

Option F: We are lenient towards heinous crimes. Again, this seems more about leniency towards certain crimes rather than the death penalty specifically.

Option G: We should prioritize rehabilitation over punishment. So, he's arguing that we should spend time on the guilty rather than punishment. That makes sense because he's criticizing the death penalty as a form of punishment that doesn't address the root issue of crimes. But again, this isn't directly about abolishing it.

Option H: None of the above. That would mean none of the options A-J are correct. But since D seems to be a strong argument against abolishing the death penalty, I think H is not the right answer.

Option I: We respect the dignity of human life. I don't see how that's directly linked to abolishing the death penalty. Respect is about the rights, but that's more general.

Option J: We have a flawed criminal justice system. That's a broad statement. Nathanson might critique the system in a more detailed way, but this is a more general option. I'm not sure if it's the main point.

Putting it all together, Nathanson's main argument against the death penalty is that it's not proportional for murder. So, D seems correct.

The correct answer is D: there is no punishment that is proportional to murder.

**Answer: D**
