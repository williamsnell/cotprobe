Question:

A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?

Options:

A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms
B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR
C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier
D: The patient's symptoms are coincidental and not related to the CFTR mutation
E: The G551D mutation in CFTR does not cause symptoms
F: The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype
G: The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained
H: The patient's clinical phenotype is due to a mutation in a different gene
I: The patient has a rare form of CFTR mutation that requires two alleles
J: The CFTR mutation is associated with her clinical phenotype but not the cause

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient and a genetic condition. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a 30-year-old woman has a 2-day history of abdominal pain. Her medical history includes recurrent upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. Her nasal secretions are thick. She also mentions that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are normal, so no major issues like hypertension or hypotension. The physical exam shows epigastric (背痛) tenderness.

Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations found one allele of the CFTR gene mutated (G551D). The question is about why this mutation is causing her symptoms.

First, I need to recall what CFTR mutations do. CFTR is the gene for cystic fibrosis, right? The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is G551D. Without this mutation, the CFTR protein is hydrophilic (water-loving), so the cell can't take in water well. This leads to cell swelling, which causes the lungs to damage, hence sinusitis and other respiratory issues. The pancreatitis is more about the pancreas getting infected, which is a separate issue.

Her symptoms are related to the CFTR mutation. But the genetic test shows only one allele is mutated. So, what if she has one CFTR mutation and one normal allele? That would make her a carrier. But wait, carriers can have the mutation inherited from one parent and not the other. Let me think about how carriers can manifest.

In cystic fibrosis, carriers can have one mutated CFTR allele and one normal allele. They can pass the mutation to a child, but since the CFTR protein can't take in water, it doesn't cause the same symptoms as those with two mutations. So, a CFTR carrier (with one G551D and one normal) would present with symptoms like upper respiratory infections, but not the same as those with two mutations.

Wait, but wait. Are the symptoms the same? I think that's the case. So, someone with a CFTR mutation (like a carrier) would have similar symptoms to someone with two mutations. So, in this case, since she has a mutation (one allele), but only one, what does that mean for her symptoms?

Wait, but the patient's symptoms are abdominal pain. Cystic fibrosis causes a lot of respiratory issues, not abdominal ones. Or does it? I'm not sure. I've heard that cystic fibrosis can cause abdominal pain in some cases, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the symptoms could be related to another condition, like perhaps cystic fibrosis related to the lungs.

Wait, but the question says her symptoms are due to CFTR mutation. So, the genetic test found one mutation in CFTR, not two. So, if the patient has a CFTR mutation (so one G551D), but only one allele is mutated, what does that mean?

Wait, wait. If the patient has a single CFTR mutation (G551D), meaning she has one mutated allele and one normal, she would be a carrier. But carriers can have the mutation inherited from both parents. But in this case, only one allele is mutated, so she must be carrying it.

But why does she have abeconomic pain? Because cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that's hereditary. So, even if she has one mutation, so does she have a 50% chance to pass it to a child. But that's about the incidence, not the patient's symptoms.

Wait, but the patient's symptoms are due to CFTR mutation. So, the genetic test found one mutation in CFTR, not two. So, if the patient has a CFTR mutation (so one G551D), but only one allele is mutated, what does that mean?

Wait, wait. If the patient has a single CFTR mutation (G551D), meaning she has one mutated allele and one normal, she would have a CFTR carrier. carriers can have the mutation inherited from one parent and not the other, or both. But since only one allele is mutated, she's a carrier of one mutation.

But the question is why her symptoms are as they are. Because carriers of CFTR have the mutation, but do they have the same symptoms as those with two mutations? Or do they have more severe symptoms?

Wait, in the case of cystic fibrosis, the patient can have symptoms due to the mutation, but not necessarily the same as the ones with two mutations. Wait, no, perhaps they do. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think that in cystic fibrosis, even a single mutation can cause a range of symptoms, including those that are not typical for CF. Or maybe the symptoms are the same as with the two-mutation condition. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, let's think about the symptoms. Her symptoms are abeconomic pain, which is a symptom of the lungs. Cystic fibrosis in the lungs causes things like wheezing, coughing, and sometimes, in more severe cases, abdominal pain. So, maybe she has a CFTR mutation that causes her to have these symptoms. But since she has a mutation, perhaps she's a carrier, and the symptoms could be present in carriers.

Wait, but wait. If she has a CFTR mutation (G551D), she would have the same symptoms as someone with two mutations. But the patient's symptoms are due to one mutation. So, if she has a mutation, it's possible that her symptoms are the same as those with a two-mutation, but sometimes, carriers can have the mutation and not show the same symptoms as having two mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the symptoms are more likely to be due to a two-mutation condition, but since the patient has a single mutation, maybe her symptoms are similar to that.

Wait, but the question is why her symptoms are as they are. So, the genetic test found one mutation in CFTR. So, what does that mean for the patient's phenotype.

Option B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.

Wait, but the patient's genetic testing only found one mutation. So, she has one G551D allele. But that doesn't necessarily mean she's a carrier because carriers can have the mutation. Wait, wait. If the patient has one mutation, perhaps it's a carrier, but carriers can have the mutation and not have the same symptoms as those with two mutations.

Alternatively, maybe carriers can't have some of the same symptoms as those with two mutations.

Wait, wait. The CFTR mutation is G551D. The CFTR protein is hydrophilic (water-loving), which makes it difficult to enter the lungs, so it causes congestion and wheezing. This is typical of CF. So, if someone has a CFTR mutation, they can have symptoms like wheezing, cough, and in severe cases, chest pain or wheezing. So, her symptoms are similar to someone with two CF mutations.

Since her symptoms are due to a CFTR mutation, perhaps her symptoms are the same as those of someone with a two-mutation CFTR. But the genetic testing found one mutation, not two.

Wait, but the question states that the genetic testing found a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. That means one allele is mutated, so the person has a CFTR mutation. But as a result, she has the same symptoms as CF with a single mutation (e.g., wheezing, cough, etc.), but perhaps not the same as with two mutations.

So, the patient's symptoms are due to CFTR mutation, but since she has one, she's a carrier for the mutation. But since the genetic testing found one mutation, that's the key point.

Wait, but the question is about the phenotype. The options are about why her symptoms are the way they are.

So, the CFTR mutation (G551D) causes her symptoms. Since she has one mutation, the CFTR is not a two-mutation condition, but a single mutation.

So, what is the best explanation? Let's look at the options.

Option B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR. So, she has one mutation, so she's a carrier.

Wait, but carriers can have the mutation and not necessarily present with the same symptoms as two mutations. Alternatively, if it's a single mutation, they don't have the same symptoms as a two-mutation, but this is a point of confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the mutation is present, so she has a CFTR mutation. So, the genetic testing found a mutation in one allele, so she has at least one, but her symptoms may be due to that mutation.

Wait, but wait. If a person has a CFTR mutation, they have the same symptoms as someone with two mutations.

Wait, but the patient's symptoms are not the same as those with two mutations, but they are due to the single mutation.

But how is that possible? Let me think about it. Maybe the symptoms are similar, but the patient's phenotype is due to a CFTR mutation, not the cause.

Wait, the question says the patient's symptoms are due to the CFTR mutation. So, the symptoms are expressed because of the mutation. So, the genetic testing is not the cause, but the presence of the mutation is.

But the options are asking about the explanation for her symptoms.

So, the patient's symptoms are due to having a mutation (G551D) in one allele. So, the best explanation is that she has a CFTR mutation (so the correct answer is B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR).

Wait, but wait. If she has a CFTR mutation, and that mutation is G551D, then her symptoms would be similar to those with the two-mutation condition. But the patient's symptoms are due to a single mutation, so the presence of the mutation is the cause, but the symptoms may not be as severe as those from a two-mutation.

Wait, but the question is about the "phenotype", which includes why she has those symptoms. So, the fact that she has a mutation explains her symptoms.

So, since the genetic test found one mutation, that explains her symptoms. But the presence of a mutation is enough to cause the symptoms.

But the options are about why her symptoms occur. So, the correct answer is B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.

Alternatively, could the patient have a CFTR mutation and a different condition? But the question points out that her symptoms are due to the CFTR mutation. So, the explanation is that she has a mutation in CFTR, which is G551D, and since she has a mutation, her symptoms are due to that.

Wait, but why would the patient have a mutation and be a carrier? Because carriers have the mutation inherited from one parent and not the other. But in her case, since only one allele is mutated, she could be a carrier. But the question is about why her symptoms are as they are, not about her genotype.

Wait, the correct reasoning is that she has a mutation in the CFTR gene, which is G551D, so her symptoms are due to that mutation. So, the answer would be B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.

Wait, but another angle: The patient's presence of a single mutation (G551D) is a hallmark of CFTR mutation, which causes the symptoms. So, the symptoms are present because she has a mutation. So, the correct explanation is that she has a mutation in the CFTR gene, which is G551D, so her symptoms are due to that.

Looking at the options, option B says that. But the option that says she's a carrier, which is option C: the patient is a CFTR obligate carrier.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Option C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier. An obligate carrier has two copies of the mutated allele (so, two G551D). So, if she's a carrier, that would lead to what symptoms? Because with two mutations, the CFTR protein is hydrophilic and can't enter the lungs, leading to symptoms like wheezing and chest pain. But the patient's symptoms are more likely to be what? If she's a carrier, the symptoms might not be as bad as with two mutations. Or maybe the patient's symptoms are not the same as that.

Wait, but the question states that her symptoms are due to the CFTR mutation. So, the presence of a mutation is the cause, but the symptoms may be similar to those caused by two mutations.

Wait, but the patient has only one mutation. So, perhaps her symptoms are due to a single mutation, not the two. So, her symptoms are worse than those with two mutations, but the patient's symptoms are due to a mutation in a single allele.

Wait, but what's the correct reasoning for her phenotype? Do the symptoms reflect the mutation (so presence of mutation is the cause), or does the presence of the mutation cause the symptoms?

The question says her symptoms are due to the mutation. So, the patient's symptoms are her presenting because of the presence of a CFTR mutation. Thus, the explanation is that she has a mutation in CFTR, which is G551D.

So, the correct answer is B. But wait, another angle: Option C says she's an obligate carrier, which would cause more severe symptoms like wheezing, but the patient's symptoms may be more like typical CF symptoms.

Wait, but the patient's symptoms are abeconomic pain, which is more like wheezing or coughing. So, the presence of a mutation (G551D) causes symptoms, so the correct explanation is that she has a mutation in the CFTR gene (G551D), which is option B.

But then why is there an option for B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.

Wait, the question is: why does she have these symptoms? The reason is the mutation in the CFTR gene, which is G551D. So, the presence of that mutation is the cause.

But the options are about what explains her phenotype. So, the correct explanation is that she has a CFTR mutation (G551D), which is option B.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option says.

Option B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR. So, she has one, so the mutation is present. That would explain her symptoms, because the mutation is present.

But another point: carriers can have the mutation, but they may not present with the same symptoms as someone with two mutations. However, the question says that her symptoms are due to the mutation. So, the presence of the mutation is the cause.

So, the answer would be B: only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.

Wait, but wait. The genetic testing found one allele. So, perhaps she has a mutation that is necessary for the CFTR protein to be hydrophilic, causing the symptoms. So, the presence of a mutation in one allele is enough to cause the symptoms.

So, the correct explanation is that she has a mutation in CFTR (G551D), which is option B.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Both needed for symptoms (unlikely, since a single mutation might cause it)

B: Only one needed

C: Carrier, which would involve two mutations

D: Symptoms not related (unlikely, as the question says symptoms are due to CFTR mutation)

E: No symptoms (not relevant)

F: Mutation unrelated (unlikely, since the question says it's a CFTR mutation)

G: carriers with another mutation (not relevant)

H: Symptoms caused by another gene (unlikely, as the question says it's CFTR)

I: More severe symptoms (unlikely)

J: Symptoms not from the mutation (unlikely)

So, the best option is B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.

Wait, but wait again. If the patient has a mutation in CFTR (G551D), that's a CFTR mutation. The CFTR mutation is known to cause a range of respiratory infections, including cough, wheezing, etc. Her symptoms are similar to those with a CFTR mutation, but not more severe than those from two mutations.

Wait, but the question says her symptoms are due to the mutation. So, the correct explanation is that she has a mutation, so the answer is B.

Alternatively, wait, I might have mixed up the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Both alleles mutated. If that's the case, the symptoms would be more severe, like wheezing, perhaps more than the current case.

Option B: Only one allele mutated. That explains the symptoms, as the mutation causes the symptoms.

Option C: Carrier. If she's a carrier, she has one mutation. But carriers may not present with the same symptoms as someone with two mutations.

But the question is about why the symptoms are as they are. So, the presence of a mutation is the cause, so option B is correct.

Wait, but another possibility: The patient has a CFTR mutation that causes her to have upper respiratory infections (sinuses) and other respiratory issues. But in this case, the symptoms are abeconomic pain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, in the question, her symptoms are abeconomic pain. That's a type of abdominal pain. Which is more likely due to CF in the lungs, not the upper respiratory tract.

Wait, perhaps the patient has a CFTR mutation that causes wheezing in their airways, leading to symptoms of chest pain or wheezing. But the question says her symptoms are due to CFTR mutation. So, the CFTR mutation is causing her to have the symptoms.

So, the correct answer is B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR. Because the patient has a mutation, so the symptoms are due to it.
</think>

The patient has a 2-day history of abeconomic pain, which is typically associated with the lungs. Her genetic testing identified a single mutation (G551D) in the CFTR gene, which is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis. The question asks why her symptoms occur. 

- **Option A**: If both alleles were mutated, symptoms might be more severe, such as wheezing, but the patient's symptoms are abeconomic pain, which is more likely due to CFTR mutations in the lungs. This makes Option A unlikely.  
- **Option B**: A single mutation in the CFTR gene explains her symptoms, as CFTR mutations cause respiratory issues like wheezing and cough. This is the most direct explanation for her symptoms.  
- **Option C**: A carrier would have one mutated allele and one normal allele. While carriers can have the mutation, they may not present with the same symptoms as someone with two mutations. However, the patient's symptoms are due to the mutation, not the carrier.  
- **Option D**: The patient's symptoms are not unrelated to the CFTR mutation but are more likely due to the mutation.  
- **Option E**: The presence of a CFTR mutation does not explain the absence of symptoms.  
- **Option F**: The mutation is present, not unrelated.  
- **Option G**: The mutation is a known cause of the symptoms described.  
- **Option H**: The symptoms are not caused by two CFTR mutations.  
- **Option I**: The symptoms are not caused by the mutation.  
- **Option J**: The symptoms are not caused by the mutation.  
- **Option K**: The patient's symptoms are due to the mutation, not the cause of the symptoms.  
- **Option L**: The patient's symptoms are caused by the mutation.  

The best explanation is that the patient has a mutation in the CFTR gene (G551D), which explains her symptoms.
