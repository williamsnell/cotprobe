Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called "cardinals"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Martin Luther and his views on reformers. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is asking which reformer expressed views similar to Martin Luther's. The options are A to E, each a different person. I remember that Martin Luther was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation and wrote extensively on various topics like theology and education.

Looking at the text provided, it's from a letter by Martin Luther to his ordinate. In it, he talks about the Christian nobility, the need for reform, and mentions how cardinals were used to control the church. He also discusses the importance of convents and fiefs, and his support for Martin Luther to the German nobility.

Now, the options are:

A: Philipp Melanchthon
B: Sir Thomas More
C: John Knox
D: Erasmus
E: Martin Bucer

I need to think about each of these and see if any of them align with Luther's views.

Philipp Melanchthon was a German cardinal and theologian. He was one of the early Protestant leaders, but I don't recall him being associated with the same reforms as Luther. He wrote on the Reformation, but I'm not sure if he was directly involved in the same way.

Sir Thomas More was an English writer who became a prominent Protestant. He was a cardinal and wrote extensively on theology, but I'm not certain if he directly supported the same reforms as Luther. His focus seems more on the church's role in society, maybe more on cardinal power and the role of the Church in state.

John Knox was a 16th-century English cardinal and theologian. He was an early Protestant, but I don't remember his views being similar to Luther's. His work might have been more focused on theological principles.

Erasmus was a 16th-century Dutch cardinal and theologian. He was a key figure in the Cartesian theology movement. He wrote extensively on theology, including the Cartesian Oeuvres, but I don't think he was directly associated with the Protestant Reformation reform efforts, especially in terms of the role of cardinals. His views were more about philosophy and the Cartesian framework.

Martin Bucer was a 17th-century English cardinal. I'm not sure about his specific views on reform or cardinals, but I don't think he's the one expressing similar views as Luther.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the names. Let me think again. The letter in question is about the German nobility, the reform, and the role of cardinals. So the reformers in question are those who advocate for reform or the governance of the church.

Looking up, I recall that Martin Luther did support the use of cardinals to lead the church, which is what he's talking about in the text. So the reformers he was talking about are the ones who support the role of cardinals in the church.

E.g., Erasmus was more about the Cartesian views, but perhaps he didn't directly support the role of cardinals. Alternatively, maybe other reformists like Melanchthon or Knox were involved. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the text mentions that Luther supports the use of cardinals. Which of the options supports the same? Looking at the options, I think Erasmus was a cardinal, but he's more on the Cartesian side. Alternatively, maybe Melanchthon was involved, but I don't remember him being a reformer in the same way as Luther.

Wait, I think the answer is D: Erasmus. Because in the text, he says "he is the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter." That's a key point about the church's role. Also, in the text, he talks about the use of cardinals, which is similar to what he supports for reform.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Melanchthon was involved in reforming, but I'm more familiar with Melanchthon being a cardinal who supported the Reformation. But perhaps he was involved in similar ideas.

Wait, the text mentions that the German nobility is being reformled, and the use of cardinals is a way to do that. So the reformers are those who advocate for the role of cardinals in the church. So who among the options supports this?

Erasmus was a cardinal and a reformer. He wrote about the church's role in society. He also wrote about the Cartesian views, which are part of the Protestant Reformation. He's known for his work in theological texts. So he's a reformer who supports the role of cardinals, which matches the views in the text.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the text is about Martin Luther's own views, not the Reformation as a whole. The text is about the German nobility and the need for reform. So the reformers he is addressing are those who support reform and the role of cardinals.

Looking back, the options are about who supported similar views. So I'm trying to find which of these reformers would have supported the role of cardinals in reforming the church.

Erasmus is a cardinal, so he would support reforming the church. His work includes the Cartesian views, which are part of the Protestant Reformation. So he would have expressed views supporting the role of cardinals in reforming the church.

Alternatively, Melanchthon was a cardinal who was a reformist, but I think Melanchthon's work was more about church reforms in general, not specifically the role of cardinals.

Wait, another thought: the text is about the German nobility, which is a form of reform. So the reformers would be those who advocate for reforming the church. So the ones who support the role of cardinals, which are important in church governance.

So, in the options, Erasmus is a cardinal, so he would support reforming the church. So the answer would be D: Erasmus.

Alternatively, Melanchthon was involved in reforming the church, but perhaps not as directly as Erasmus. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that Melanchthon was more about church reform in general, while Erasmus focused on the Cartesian views and church governance.

I think the correct answer is D: Erasmus.
</think>

The text discusses Martin Luther's views on reforming the Christian estate, particularly regarding the role of cardinals in the church. Among the options provided, Erasmus, as a cardinal and a reformer, aligns most closely with these views. He was a key figure in the Cartesian theology movement and supported the use of cardinals in reforming the church. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Erasmus**
