Question:

The mean daily demand for bread at a popular bakery is 2,500 loaves, with a standard deviation of 225 loaves. Every morning the bakery bakes 3,000 loaves. What is the probability that today it will run out of bread? Assume that the mean daily demand for bread at this bakery is normally distributed.

Options:

A: 0.9869
B: 0.5234
C: 0.6875
D: 0.0132
E: 0.3500
F: 0.4589
G: 0.8333
H: 0.2314
I: 0.7500
J: 0.1667

Okay, so I've got this problem about a bakery's bread demand. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The mean daily demand is 2,500 loaves with a standard deviation of 225. The bakery bakes 3,000 loaves every morning. I need to find the probability that they run out of bread today. Oh wait, right, that's the probability that the demand exceeds 3,000 loaves. 

Wait, no, not exactly. Because the problem says they bake 3,000 loaves, so if demand is higher than that, they'll run out. So I need to find the probability that daily demand (X) is greater than 3,000. 

I remember that for normal distributions, we can standardize the variable using Z = (X - μ) / σ. So X is 3,000, μ is 2,500, σ is 225. Let me compute that.

Z = (3000 - 2500) / 225. 3000 minus 2500 is 500. 500 divided by 225. Let me calculate that. 225 times 2 is 450, so 500 is 225*2 + 50. So 2 + (50/225) → which is 2.222... approximately.

So Z ≈ 2.222. Now, I need to find P(X > 3000), which is P(Z > 2.222). Alternatively, since the standard normal distribution tables usually give P(Z < z), I can find P(Z < 2.22) and subtract it from 1.

Looking up Z = 2.22 in the standard normal table. Let me think, what's the value for Z=2.2? I remember that Z=2.20 is about 0.9861. For 2.22, maybe it's a bit higher. Let me think, perhaps 0.9868? Or maybe another way, like using linear approximation between 2.2 and 2.3.

Wait, another approach: Z=2.22 is 2 and 0.22. The table values for Z=2.20 is 0.9861, and Z=2.23 is approximately 0.9871. So, 2.22 would be halfway between 2.20 and 2.23. So maybe 0.9861 + 0.001 = 0.9871? No, wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the exact value.

Wait, let's think about the standard normal distribution. For Z=2.22, the cumulative probability is about 0.9868. So P(Z < 2.22) is approximately 0.9868. Therefore, P(Z > 2.22) is 1 - 0.9868 = 0.0132. So the probability of running out is approximately 0.0132, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, using a calculator or a more precise table. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the error function or another method, but I think the approximate value is 0.9868, so 1 - 0.9868 = 0.0132. So the probability is about 1.32%. That sounds low, but given the demand is 2,500 with a standard deviation of 225, baking 3,000 loaves is 500 loaves more, which is a significant number. The z-score is 2.22, which is two and a third standard deviations above the mean. So yes, the probability that it's more than that is about 1.32%. So the correct answer should be D: 0.0132.

To determine the probability that the bakery runs out of bread, we need to calculate the probability that the daily demand exceeds 3,000 loaves. Given the mean demand (μ) is 2,500 loaves and the standard deviation (σ) is 225 loaves, we standardize the variable using the Z-score formula:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{3000 - 2500}{225} = \frac{500}{225} \approx 2.222
\]

Next, we find the probability that Z is greater than 2.222. Using a standard normal distribution table, the cumulative probability for Z = 2.22 is approximately 0.9868. Therefore:

\[
P(Z > 2.22) = 1 - P(Z \leq 2.22) = 1 - 0.9868 = 0.0132
\]

Thus, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread is approximately 0.0132, which corresponds to option D.
