Question:

On Thursday morning, two plainclothes police officers were shot to death while trying to arrest a bank robber who had just robbed a bank. Following the killings, the police issued an "all-points-bulletin" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.
B: succeed, if the man can prove the security guard had no reason to suspect him
C: succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.
D: not succeed, because the security guard was performing his duty
E: succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.
F: succeed, if the security guard used excessive force during the arrest
G: succeed, if the man experienced emotional trauma as a result of the false arrest
H: not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about an assault claim made by a man against a security guard. Hmm, I remember that assault requires physical contact, pain, and usually some kind of emotional distress. Let's break down the facts.

On Thursday morning, two plainclothes police officers were shot to death trying to arrest a robber. Then, on Friday, a security guard saw someone on Main Street who looked like the suspect. He approached, thought he was the suspect, pulled a gun, and arrested him. The police informed him he was wrong. The suspect said he wasn't the robber and shot the officers. He was humiliated by the false arrest.

So the man is suing the security guard for assault. I need to determine if he can succeed.

First, what's the standard for assault? I think it requires that the plaintiff (the man here) was harmed physically, and that the harm was due to the defendant's action. Also, there's the emotional distress part. So the key here is whether the man's injury was caused by the security guard's actions.

The security guard pulled a gun and arrested the man. He thought he was the suspect, but the man said he wasn't. The police told him he was wrong. The man is suing for assault, so he's claiming that the guard's belief was incorrect.

Wait, but does the security guard's belief count as a defense? Like, if he was mistaken, does that negate the defense for assault? Or does the belief itself not directly cause harm?

In some jurisdictions, a person can have a defense if they believe their own actions were incorrect or something. But in this case, the man is suing for assault, which is a specific defense. I think the defendant's belief doesn't negate the plaintiff's claim if the belief was a mistake that led to harm.

I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that the defendant's belief must be both a mistake of fact and a mistake of law. But in this scenario, the defendant's belief was a mistake of law (they thought he was the suspect, but he wasn't). Does that mean the belief itself doesn't cause injury? Or does the belief lead to the man's belief in the suspect?

Wait, the man's belief that he was the suspect leads him to believe the security guard was the suspect. So the defendant's belief (that he's the suspect) is incorrect. But the man's belief (that the security guard was the suspect) is incorrect too.

Now, does the defendant's mistake of law (thinking he was the suspect) lead to the man's belief that he was the suspect? Yes. So the defendant's mistake of law would lead to the man's belief that he was the suspect.

But does that mean the defendant's mistake of law is a defense? Or is it a defense only if the defendant's belief was incorrect. Because here, the defendant's belief was incorrect (they thought he was the suspect), so that's a defense for the man.

Wait, but is the defense that the defendant's belief was incorrect, and if that belief was formed before the defendant acted, then the defendant's mistake of law is a defense. So in this case, the man is suing because he believes the defendant (security guard) had a wrong belief.

So his claim against the defendant is that he was wrongfully believed to be the suspect, leading to him believing the defendant acted on his behalf. But does that make the defendant's belief a defense?

I think the key here is that the defendant's belief was a mistake, which is a defense. So the man can claim that the defendant's belief was incorrect and thus has a defense. So he can successfully assert the assault.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I remember that when a person's belief is incorrect, it can be a defense, but it's not necessarily always successful. But in this case, the defendant's belief was incorrect, which is a defense.

So the man's claim is that he was wrongfully believed to be the suspect, leading him to believe the defendant acted on his behalf. If the defendant had a wrong belief, then the man's belief is incorrect, so the defendant's mistake is a defense.

So the man can succeed in asserting assault because the defendant's mistake of law (thinking he was the suspect) led to the man's belief that he was the suspect. Therefore, the defendant's mistake of law is a defense for the man.

Looking at the options:

A: Not succeed because no injury. — No, because the man can sue for injury.
B: Succeed if defendant had no reason to suspect him. — That's the defense, so he can.
C: Succeed if the guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. — That's another reason why the defense is valid, but the main point is that the defendant's belief was incorrect.
D: Not succeed because defendant didn't intend to injure. — No, because the defendant's action includes injury.
E: Succeed if the guard used excessive force. — Not relevant to the injury.
F: Succeed if the guard used excessive force. — Not relevant.
G: Succeed if the man experienced trauma. — Yes, because the defendant's belief was incorrect.
H: Not succeed because defendant didn't intend to injure. — No, since the defendant acted on that belief.

So the correct answer is either B or G.

Wait, the options are:

G: succeed if the man experienced emotional trauma from false arrest.

So the defense is that the defendant's belief was incorrect, leading to the man's belief that he was the suspect. The assumption is that the defendant's belief was incorrect, which is a defense. So if the man is suing, he can because the defendant's belief was a mistake, which is a defense.

So the options are B, G, or H. But H says the defendant didn't intend to injure, which is not a defense. H is incorrect because the defendant's actions include injury.

So the correct answer is G: the man would succeed if his belief was incorrect.

Wait, but let me think again. Does the defendant's mistake of law (thinking he was the suspect) cause the man's belief that he was the suspect? Yes, because the man believed the defendant was the suspect, thinking the guard was him. So the defendant's mistake of law is a defense.

So the man can assert assault because the defendant's belief was incorrect, making the belief a defense.

The man can successfully assert a claim for assault against the security guard because the defendant's belief that he was the suspect was incorrect. This belief led the man to believe the security guard was the suspect, thereby creating a defense for him. The defense is that the defendant's mistake of law (thinking he was the suspect) was incorrect, and thus the man can claim assault.
