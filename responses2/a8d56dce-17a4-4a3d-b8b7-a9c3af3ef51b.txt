Question:

Every day Melanie spends her lunch money consuming apples, at $1 each, and oranges, at $2 each. At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?

Options:

A: She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.
B: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.
C: She should spend all her money on apples since they are cheaper.
D: She should save her lunch money instead of spending it on apples and oranges.
E: She should continue consuming apples and oranges at the same rate, regardless of marginal utility.
F: She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.
G: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.
H: She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the total utility is maximized, regardless of the price.
I: She should spend all her money on oranges as they have higher marginal utility.
J: She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar of oranges is twice that of apples.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about utility maximization. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says Melanie is spending her lunch money on apples and oranges. Apples cost $1 each and oranges are $2 each. Right now, she's at a point where her marginal utilities are 12 for apples and 18 for oranges. But wait, she's already spent all her money, so she's at the utility maximizing combination, but I think the question is about how she should change her consumption to maximize utility if she still has money left. Or maybe she's already at that point, and the question is about her next decision.

Wait, the question says: If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should she change her consumption? Oh, so perhaps she's already at the optimal point. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because the initial information is about her current consumption. She's spending all her money, so maybe she's at the marginal utility per dollar equal point. But the options suggest that she might want to adjust. So the question is, if she's already at the optimal point, then she shouldn't change anything. But perhaps she's not, and she needs to adjust.

Wait, let's read the question again. The question says she's already spent all her lunch money. So she's at the optimal point, meaning that her marginal utilities per dollar are equal. So she shouldn't change anything. So the answer should be option A: she's consuming the utility maximizing combination.

But wait, the options include other possibilities. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: She should make no changes; she's at the utility maximizing combination. That makes sense if she's already at the point.

Option B: Increase apples, decrease oranges until the marginal utility per dollar is equal. But if she's already at that point, she shouldn't change. So probably option A is correct.

But wait, wait. Because she's already spent all her money. So she's at the optimal point. So she's already maximizing her utility. So she shouldn't change anything. So the correct answer is A.

But let me think again. Let me calculate the marginal utilities per dollar.

Apples: MU=12, price=1. So per dollar, it's 12/1=12.
Oranges: MU=18, price=2. So per dollar, 18/2=9.

So apples give better (higher) utility per dollar. So if she has money left, she should buy more apples. Wait, but she's already spent all her money. So she can't buy more. So she's already at the optimal point. So the answer is A: she's already at the optimal point.

But wait, the last part of the question says, if she has already spent all of her money, how should she change her consumption to maximize utility? So now she's at the optimal point, so she doesn't need to change anything. So the correct choice is A.

So the options are:
A: current choice is optimal.
B: change to equalize marginal utilities per dollar.
C: spend all on apples, which is wrong because oranges are more expensive.
D: same but for oranges? Or perhaps she'd buy more apples?
E: save money, so no, she's already spending all.
F: decrease apples, increase oranges. But if apples are better, then she should buy more apples.
G: increase apples, decrease oranges. Hmm, that's the opposite of what she should do.
H: She increases apples and oranges to maximize total utility, regardless of price. But no, she should equalize per dollar.
I: spend on oranges, which is incorrect.
J: decrease apples, increase oranges. But that would make oranges more, which is bad.

So the correct choice is A, because she's already at the optimal point.

The question asks how Melanie should adjust her consumption of apples and oranges to maximize utility, given that she has already spent all her lunch money. 

- **Option A**: Correct. If she is already at the utility-maximizing combination, she should not change her consumption.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. If she is already at the optimal point, she should not increase apples or decrease oranges.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Spending all money on apples is not advisable since oranges are more expensive.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no indication that oranges should be bought more or less.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. She is already spending all her money, so she should not save it.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Decreasing apples would worsen utility.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Increasing apples would improve utility.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Maximizing total utility doesnâ€™t require equalizing per dollar.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Spending on oranges would not maximize utility.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Decreasing apples would not maximize utility.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as she is already at the optimal point.
