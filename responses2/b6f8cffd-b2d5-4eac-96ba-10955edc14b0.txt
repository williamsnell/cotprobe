Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about abortion, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Little's argument regarding the准许终止妊娠 until the fetus is a person. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I remember that abortion has been a contentious issue in ethics. So, I'll start by recalling what I know.

First, the options are A to J. Let me go through each one.

Option A says abortion is morally wrong but can be permissible in extreme cases. I think this is related to the concept of "moral gray area." There are cases where abortion is discussed as a gray area because it's unclear whether it's right or wrong. But I'm not sure if this is Little's stance.

Option B states the fetus isn't a person until it's capable of independent life. That rings a bell. I remember something about the fetus needing to have autonomy. In some legal contexts, the fetus is not yet a person until it can be independently controlled or has the ability to function on its own. So this might be a point Little is making.

Option C claims the decision is ultimately with the mother. This sounds like the stance of the fetus's autonomy. Some people believe the fetus has the legal right to make decisions about its own life, so the mother's decision is up to her.

Option D says the moral status of the fetus is irrelevant. That doesn't sound right. The fetus's moral status would affect the mother's decision, so it's definitely not irrelevant; the mother has a right to decide.

Option E suggests abortion is absolutely morally wrong. That's probably incorrect because there are ethical arguments for it, like preventing the fetus from becoming a person, which could have serious consequences.

Option F says it's ethically permissible to abort before the fetus is a person. That aligns with what Little might be saying, especially if she's arguing that the fetus's autonomy should take precedence over abortion.

Option G claims a woman has a right to control her own body. That's more of a biological perspective, not exactly about abortion's morality. It's more about personal autonomy, not the moral aspect.

Option H mentions no clear answer about abortion's moral status. This is a term from the "moral gray area" debate. Little might be pointing out that there's no definitive answer, which is a key point.

Option I says abortion is absolutely morally wrong. That's just the opposite of option E and F. It's a strong statement, probably incorrect.

Option J refers to a legal right to abortion, which is another stance Little might support. She might argue that the fetus's autonomy and legal rights are prioritized.

Now, let's think about Little's stance. I think she argues that the fetus is not a person until it can be a person, so the abortion should stop before that point. That would tie into option B and F. But the question is about the argument she makes. So, the question is which option best captures her reasoning.

The question is asking what Little argues. So, the correct answer would be either B or F. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says the fetus isn't a person until it's capable of independent life. That's the basis for Little's argument. Option F states that it's ethically permissible to abort before the fetus is a person. Both seem to align with the idea that the fetus's autonomy is important.

Wait, but the question is about what Little argues. The options are choices Little might make. So, which one is the correct answer.

In the context of the question, the correct answer is likely B or F. But I think Little might be referring to the autonomy argument (B) rather than the ethical permission (F). For example, in some legal contexts, the fetus is not a person until it can become a person, so the mother's decision is about whether to terminate before that point.

Wait, but the question is about what she argues. So, the correct answer would be either B or F.

Looking back, both B and F are related. But the question is, what does Little argue? So, it's likely that she argues that the fetus isn't a person until it can be, which points to option B or F.

Wait, but the options are separate. Let me think about the original question again. The question is about Little's argument, which includes her stance on whether it's morally wrong to terminate before the fetus can be a person. So, the question is about which of these options is the correct answer.

In the context of the question, the correct answer is B or F, but I think the most accurate answer is B because it's the basis for Little's argument. Additionally, option F is a more general statement, but Little's argument is probably the specific one about the fetus's autonomy.

So, the correct answer is B: the fetus is not a person until it is capable of independent life.

The question revolves around Little's argument regarding the准许终止妊娠 until the fetus is a person. To determine the correct answer, I analyzed each option based on Little's stance.

- **Option B**: This aligns with Little's argument, stating the fetus isn't a person until it can independently function. This is a key point in her reasoning.
- **Option F**: This also aligns, as it discusses the ethical permissible nature of aborting before the fetus can be a person.

However, the question specifically asks what Little argues. Since the question is about her argument, the correct answer is likely **B**, as it directly encapsulates the basis of her stance.

ANSWER: B
