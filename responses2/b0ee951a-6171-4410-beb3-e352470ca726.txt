Okay, so I'm trying to answer this economics question about producer surplus and consumer surplus. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, Elsa values her time at $50 per hour. She's tutoring David for two hours. David is willing to pay $175 for those two hours. But they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours. The question is about the transaction and which statement is true regarding the surpluses.

Hmm, I remember that consumer surplus is the difference between what a person is willing to pay and what they actually pay. Similarly, producer surplus is the difference between what a producer is willing to accept and what they actually receive. Wait, but wait—since it's Elsa and David, I think it's the opposite. Wait, no—wait, in this case, maybe I'm mixing up who is the consumer and who is the producer.

Wait, in this scenario, David is the one being tutored, right? So David is the consumer. He's willing to pay $175, but was only charged $125. So the consumer surplus for David would be $175 - $125 = $50. But wait, no—wait, no. Wait, consumer surplus is what he's willing to pay minus the price he actually pays. So yes, that's correct. So in this transaction, the consumer surplus is $50.

Now, what about the producer surplus? The producer is Elsa. She values her time at $50 per hour. She's tutoring for two hours, which is a total of $50 * 2 = $100. But the negotiated price is $125 for the entire two hours. Wait, wait—wait a second. Wait, no. If the price is $125 for the two-hour service, then the price per hour would be $62.50 per hour. Because 125 divided by 2 is 62.50.

Wait, no, wait again. I think I'm getting this mixed up. Wait, the question says the price is $125 for the entire two hours. So the total is $125. So for two hours, the price per hour is $62.50. But wait, that's not right. Because if the price is $125 for two hours, then the price per hour is $125 / 2 = $62.50. But that seems high compared to what David is willing to pay.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, the producer's cost is based on her time. She values her time at $50 per hour. So for two hours, she would normally be paid $100. But the negotiated price is $125. So the total is $125. So that would mean that the total cost for her is $125, but she's only valued her time at $100. So the producer surplus is $125 - $100 = $25.

Wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, producer surplus is the amount the producer receives minus the cost they incur. So if the price is $125, and their cost is $100 (because she values her time at $50/hour), then the surplus is $25. So the producer surplus is $25.

Alternatively, wait, maybe I got the roles reversed. Wait, is the price the price Elsa gets? No, wait the problem says " Negotiated a price of $125 for the entire two hours." So the two-hour service is being sold at $125. So the total revenue is $125. The time spent is two hours, so the cost is 2 * 50 = $100. So the producer surplus is $125 - $100 = $25.

Wait, so in this case, the consumer surplus is $50 (because he was willing to pay $175 and paid $125), and the producer surplus is $25. So the difference between consumer surplus and producer surplus is $50 - $25 = $25. So which option says that the difference is $25? Let's see the options.

Looking at the options, option H says the difference is $25. So that would mean the consumer surplus is higher, by $25. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I correctly calculate the surplus?

Wait, the consumer surplus is the amount he's willing to pay minus what he actually paid. He paid $125, and he was willing to pay $175. So 175 - 125 = $50. Correct.

The producer surplus is the amount they get (revenue) minus their cost. The service is $125 total, and their cost is 2 hours * $50/hour = $100. So 125 - 100 = $25.

So the difference between consumer surplus and producer surplus is 50 -25 = 25. So the consumer surplus is higher by $25.

Looking at the options, option H is "The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25." So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it: sometimes the total surplus is the sum of consumer and producer surplus. But in this question, the options are about the difference between the two surpluses.

So yes, the difference is $50 (consumer surplus) minus $25 (producer surplus) equals $25. So the statement would be that the consumer surplus is greater than the producer surplus by $25. Which would correspond to option H.

The question involves calculating the surplus for both the consumer and the producer in a tutoring transaction. Here's the analysis:

1. **Consumer Surplus**:  
   David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but the negotiated price is $125.  
   Consumer Surplus = Willingness to pay - Actual payment = $175 - $125 = $50.

2. **Producer Surplus**:  
   Elsa values her time at $50 per hour. For two hours, her total cost is $50 * 2 = $100. The negotiated price for two hours is $125, which represents her revenue.  
   Producer Surplus = Revenue - Cost = $125 - $100 = $25.

3. **Difference in Surpluses**:  
   The difference between consumer surplus and producer surplus is $50 (consumer surplus) - $25 (producer surplus) = $25.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option H**: "The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25."  
     This matches the calculated difference of $25.

Thus, the correct answer is **H**: The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.

**ANSWER: H**
