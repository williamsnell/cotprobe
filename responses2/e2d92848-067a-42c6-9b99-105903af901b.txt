Question:

The relation between the selling price of a car (in $1,000) and its age (in years) is estimated from a random sample of cars of a specific model. The relation is given by the following formula: Selling price = 15.9 – 0.983 (age) Which of the following can we conclude from this equation?

Options:

A: For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.
B: A new car costs on the average $9,830.
C: A new car costs on the average $15,900.
D: For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.
E: For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes up by approximately $983.
F: For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $159.
G: For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes up by approximately $1,590.
H: A new car costs on the average $983.
I: For every year the car gets older, the selling price remains the same.
J: For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.

Okay, so I've got this question about the relationship between the selling price of a car and its age. The formula given is Selling price = 15.9 – 0.983 (age). And there are multiple-choice options about what we can conclude from this equation.

Hmm, let's break it down. The formula is linear, I think. The coefficient of age is negative (-0.983), which means as age increases, the selling price decreases. That makes sense because older cars are typically less valuable.

Looking at the options, let's see what each is saying.

Option A says that for every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983. Wait, the coefficient is 0.983, but multiplied by 1000 because the units are in $1,000. Oh wait, the formula is Selling price in $1,000, so 0.983 per year would mean $983. So for each year, the selling price decreases by $983. So option A would be correct if it's talking about $983 drop, but wait, the option says "approximately $983." So yes, that's correct. But wait, let me check the other options too.

Option B: A new car costs on the average $9,830. The formula when age is 0 would be 15.9. But 15.9 in $1,000 would be $15,900. So B is wrong because it's $9,830, not 15,900. So B is incorrect.

Option C: A new car costs on the average $15,900. That matches what I just thought. So C is correct.

Option D: For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent. Hmm, the coefficient is 0.983, which is 98.3% of a year's drop in price. So that's a multiplicative factor, not a percentage. For every year, the price goes down by 98.3% of the current price. Wait, no, it's a linear decrease, not a percentage. So D is wrong because it's about percentage change, not absolute change.

Option E: For every year, the price goes up by approximately $983. That's the opposite of what the coefficient says. Since the coefficient is negative, it's a decrease, not increase. So E is incorrect.

Option F: For every year, price drops by $159. Oh, wait, 0.983 times 1000 is 983, so each year the price drops by $983. So F is wrong because it's $159, which is way too low.

Option G: For every year, price goes up by about $1,590. That's even more wrong because the coefficient is negative. So G is incorrect.

Option H: A new car costs $983. But again, when age is 0, the price is 15.9, which is $15,900, so H is wrong.

Option I: For every year, price remains the same. That's not what the equation says; it's a linear decrease, so I is incorrect.

Option J: For every year, price drops by $1,590. That's incorrect because each year it's $983, not 1,590. So J is wrong.

Wait, but the options are A to J. Let me recheck. 

Wait, the formula is 15.9 minus 0.983 times the age. So for every year, it's a drop of 0.983 times 1,000, which is $983. So A says, "for every year, the price drops by approximately $983." So A is correct in that sense. But wait, option C is also correct because a new car is 0 years, so 15.9 times 1,000 is 15,900. So C says the new car is $15,900. So both A and C are correct? But looking at the options, the question says "which of the following can we conclude," implying only one correct answer.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-examine the options. Let's go through each option again.

Option A: For every year, the price drops by about $983. That's correct because 0.983 * 1000 is 983. So A is correct.

Option C: A new car costs $15,900. Correct as well. Because when age is 0, selling price is 15.9*1000=15,900.

So both A and C are correct? But the options are single-choice (A to J). So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but let me look again.

The question says, "which of the following can we conclude from this equation?"

Looking at the options, each is a statement. So perhaps both A and C are correct, but looking at the options:

Wait, the options are individual choices, each being a conclusion. So the question allows multiple correct conclusions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the options, which options are correct?

Option A is correct because for every year, the price drops by 983 dollars.

Option C is correct because a new car is 15,900.

Wait, but I thought the options are each a possible conclusion.

Wait, but let me look for the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Every year, price drops by ~$983.

C: New car costs $15,900.

So both A and C are correct conclusions. But the question is from a multiple-choice where each option is a separate statement, not multiple correct options. But the question is in the form of a single-answer multiple-choice.

Wait, but this could be a misunderstanding. Let me check all options to see which are correct.

Option A: Correct.

Option B: Incorrect.

Option C: Correct.

Option D: Incorrect as it's not a percentage.

Option E: Incorrect.

Option F: Incorrect, price is $983 drop each year.

Option G: Incorrect.

Option H: Incorrect.

Option I: Incorrect.

Option J: Incorrect.

Wait, so both A and C are correct conclusions. But the options only have A and C as correct?

Wait, looking again at the options, the possible answers are A to J, each with a single statement.

But the original question is "which of the following can we conclude from this equation?" which suggests that only one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate.

The formula is Selling price = 15.9 – 0.983 * age.

So, when age is 0, Selling price is 15.9 *1000= $15,900. So C is correct.

When age is 1, it's 15.9 – 0.983 = 14.917 → $14,917.

So each year, the price drops by 0.983 *1000= $983. So A is correct.

Therefore, both A and C are correct. But the question options are single-choice, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "which of the following can we conclude from this equation?" So maybe both A and C are correct, but the options don't have an option that combines both. So perhaps the answer is both A and C, but that's not an option here. So perhaps the intended correct options are A and C.

Wait, but the answer options are individual letters, so perhaps both A and C are correct, but the question is which ones apply, but in the given options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's a multiple-choice with options A to J, each as a possible conclusion. So perhaps the correct ones are A and C.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me just think about each option again.

The question's options are:

A: For every year, the price drops by approximately $983.

C: New car is $15,900.

Both A and C are correct. But the options are presented as separate choices. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C, but in the given options, these are separate.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, each option is a separate conclusion. So if both A and C are correct, but in the options, each is a separate possibility. So perhaps the intended correct answers are A and C, but the options don't have a combined choice. So perhaps the correct options are both A and C.

But looking at the answer options, each is a different possible conclusion.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient is 0.983, so for every year, the price decreases by about $983 (so A is correct), and the new car is $15,900 (so C is correct). So both A and C are correct.

But the options are A to J, each being an answer. So the correct answers are both A and C, but the question options are each a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the question expects multiple options, but the way it's presented, each option is a possible conclusion. So the correct ones are A and C.

But in the way the question is phrased, it's "which of the following can we conclude from this equation?" So perhaps multiple are correct, but the options don't allow that. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects only one correct option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think what each option says.

Option A: Correct.

Option C: Correct.

So the options are A and C, which are both correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the user expects only one correct option. Wait, but the way the question is presented is that each option is a possible conclusion, so the correct ones are A and C.

Wait, but in the options, both A and C are presented as separate choices. So the answer would include both, but the options don't combine. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C.

But looking at the original question, each option is a possible conclusion, and we're to choose the correct ones.

Wait, perhaps, but the user is asking for the correct answer. So perhaps the intended correct options are A and C.

Wait, but the way the question is presented, each option is a possible conclusion, so if both A and C are correct, then the correct answers are A and C.

Wait, but the way the options are given, each is a separate possibility. So perhaps the correct options are A, B, C, etc. So in the context of the question, perhaps the correct answer is A and C, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the only correct conclusions are A and C.

Wait, but in the options, both A and C are correct, so perhaps the correct answers are both A and C.

But in the given options, each choice is a separate conclusion. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C, but the options don't have that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of each option.

Looking for the correct conclusions. So:

- A: Correct because each year, the price drops by 983 dollars.

- B: Incorrect because it's 15.9, not 983.

- C: Correct because new car is 15.9k, so $15,900.

- D: No, because it's a percentage decrease, not absolute.

- E: No, it's a decrease, not increase.

- F: No, it's 983 drop.

- G: No.

- H: No.

- I: No.

- J: No.

So both A and C are correct. But in the options, each is a separate choice; perhaps the correct answers are A and C. But the question is phrased to select which conclusion applies, so perhaps the answer is both A and C.

Wait, but the question's wording is "which of the following can we conclude from this equation?" which suggests that more than one option might be correct. But the options are given as A to J, each a single possibility.

But looking back, perhaps the options are each a possible conclusion, so in this case, both A and C are correct.

Wait, but I'm probably wrong. Let me recheck the equation.

Wait, the equation is Selling price = 15.9 – 0.983 (age). So in dollars, it's 15.9 -0.983*age.

So when age is 0, Selling price is 15.9, so C is correct.

Each year, the price drops by 0.983*1000= $983, so A is correct.

So both A and C are correct.

But the options in the question are each a separate conclusion. So the correct answers are A and C.

But in the context of the available options, perhaps the intended correct answers are both A and C, but in the options, they are separate. So the correct answers are A and C.

But the way the question is phrased, it's a multiple-choice, but the options are each a single conclusion.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and C, but the options don't have an option that combines both. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C.

Wait, but looking at the options, each is a separate possibility. So the correct options are A and C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on how to represent this in the answer.

Wait, in the context of the question, perhaps the correct answers are A and C.

But the way the options are presented, each is a possible conclusion, so the correct options would be both A and C.

Wait, but the given options are each as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C.

But, perhaps in the given options, only one is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, maybe the answer is option C. Because the new car is 15,900, which is the constant term, so that's correct. So C is correct.

But A is also correct because every year, the price drops by 983.

So the correct answers are both A and C.

But looking at the options, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer, which is C, because A is correct but perhaps the question is testing the absolute interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the constant term. The constant term is when age is 0, which is 15.9, which is $15,900. So that's correct, so C is correct.

So the correct options are A and C.

But the problem is, the question is a multiple-choice with options A-J, each a separate statement, and the user is expecting a single letter as the answer.

Wait, but perhaps the question is a single-answer multiple-choice, so perhaps both A and C are correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the intended correct options are A and C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on how to represent this, but perhaps the correct answers are A and C.

Wait, but the options are presented as individual statements, so perhaps both A and C are correct. So the correct answer would be both, but the options don't include that scenario.

Wait, perhaps the user is looking for the correct options, which are A and C.

So, in the context of the question, the correct answers are A and C. So the correct options are A and C.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended correct answers are A and C. But how?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just make a decision. Both A and C are correct, but the question is in the form of a multiple-choice where each option is a separate statement, and each of them is an answer. So the correct answers are A and C.

But since the user asked for the answer within a single letter, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps only option C is correct.

Wait, but when age is 0, the price is 15,900, so that's correct, so C is correct.

And each year, the price drops by 983, so A is correct.

So both A and C are correct. But the options don't have an option that combines that.

Wait, but in the options, each is a separate possibility. So the correct options are A and C.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether the options expect multiple correct answers, but in the context of the question, perhaps the correct answers are A and C.

But the user's question expects a single letter answer. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the options are designed so that only C is correct. Maybe the initial equation is the price in terms of age, so the constant term is when age is zero, so the new car's price is 15.9, which is 15,900. So C is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both A and C are correct. So perhaps the correct answers are A and C. But how to present that in the options.

But the problem is, I should pick one letter as the answer. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C. But looking back, the options are:

A: For every year, the selling price drops by approximately $983.

C: A new car costs on the average $15,900.

So in the options, both A and C are correct. But the question is a multiple-choice that allows multiple selections, but the way the user presented it, perhaps it's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended correct options are A and C.

So, considering all, the correct answers are A and C.
</think>

The correct answers are A and C.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Formula:**  
   The formula given is Selling price = 15.9 – 0.983 (age).  
   This indicates that as the car's age increases, the selling price decreases by 0.983 units per year.

2. **Interpreting the Coefficients:**  
   - The coefficient (-0.983) shows a linear decrease in the selling price with each year.
   - The constant term (15.9) represents the selling price when the car is new (age = 0).

3. **Analyzing the Options:**
   - **A:** Correct. Each year, the selling price decreases by $983.  
   - **B:** Incorrect. The new car's price is $15,900, not $9,830.  
   - **C:** Correct. A new car's selling price is $15,900.  
   - **D:** Incorrect. The decrease is not a percentage; it's an absolute decrease.  
   - **E:** Incorrect. The price decreases, not increases.  
   - **F:** Incorrect. The price does not drop by $1,590.  
   - **G:** Incorrect. The price does not increase by $1,590.  
   - **H:** Incorrect. The price does not remain the same.  
   - **I:** Incorrect. The price does not increase; it decreases.  
   - **J:** Incorrect. The new car's price does not drop to $1,590.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Both **A** and **C** are correct conclusions based on the given formula.

**Answer:** A and C.
