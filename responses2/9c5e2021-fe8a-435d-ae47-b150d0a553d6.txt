Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem is about the electric field in Earth's atmosphere. It says that the electric field is directed vertically downward. At 300 meters altitude, the field is 60.0 N/C, and at 200 meters, it's 100 N/C. I need to find the net amount of charge in a cube that's 100 meters on each edge. The cube has horizontal faces at 200 and 300 meters. Oh, and the answer options are all in microcoulombs. 

Hmm, I remember that electric fields relate to charge density. Oh wait, Gauss's Law! Because Gauss's Law is all about electric flux and relating it to charge enclosed. So Gauss's Law formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε0, where Φ is the electric flux through a closed surface. 

Wait, but in this case, the cube's faces are at 200 and 300 meters. So the cube is between those two altitudes, 100 meters in height. And the electric field is directed vertically downward. So the field is perpendicular to the top and bottom faces of the cube. For the other faces (front, back, left, right), the field would be horizontal, so the flux through those would be zero. Because electric field is perpendicular to the area only for the top and bottom.

So the flux through the top face is E_top * Area, and the flux through the bottom is E_bottom * Area. Wait, but wait: since the field is directed downward, the top face's flux is E * A, and the bottom face's flux is E (downward) multiplied by the same area. But wait, if the cube is between 200 and 300 meters, the top face (at higher altitude) would have a lower electric field than the bottom face (lower altitude). 

Wait, but the cube is 100 m tall. So the top face is at 300 m, and the bottom at 200 m. So the electric field at 300 m is 60 N/C downward, and at 200 m is 100 N/C downward. Since the cube is in the region where the field decreases with altitude, the bottom face has a higher E than the top face. Because a higher altitude means lower pressure (assuming Earth's atmosphere), so lower electric field. Wait, no: Wait, wait, Earth's atmosphere has the electric field decreasing with altitude. So yes, the top face (300 m) has E = 60 N/C, and the bottom (200 m) has E=100 N/C. Since the cube is in the region where the field decreases with altitude, the bottom face has a higher E than the top.

Wait, but the electric flux is E * A. So the flux through the bottom face is E_bottom * A, and flux through top is E_top * A. But wait, the cube's top and bottom are vertical, so the field is perpendicular to them. So the flux is E * Area for each. 

So the total electric flux through the cube would be (E_bottom - E_top) * Area. Because the bottom has a higher E, so the flux goes into the cube (positive), and the top has lower E, so flux leaves (negative). 

Wait, but let me think again: the cube is enclosed, so the net flux is the sum of the flux through all six faces. But the four side faces (front, back, left, right) have E parallel to their area, so the flux through them is zero. So only the top and bottom contribute. 

So Φ = E_bottom * A - E_top * A. Because the top face is at higher altitude (lower E), so the flux through it is E_top * A (but since the field is downward, flux is positive). The bottom face's flux is E_bottom * A (also downward, so positive). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the field is directed downward, so the flux through the top and bottom faces would have the same sign. Because both are in the same direction relative to the surface. So the top face's flux is E_top * A, and the bottom face's flux is E_bottom * A. So the total flux is E_bottom * A - E_top * A. 

Wait, but wait, Gauss's Law says Φ = Q_enc / ε0. So Q_enc is the charge inside, which in this case is the cube. 

Wait, but I need to find the net charge. So Q = Φ * ε0. 

But wait, the cube is between 200 and 300 m, so between them, the electric field is varying. So according to Gauss's Law, the flux through the cube is just the difference in the electric field multiplied by the area. 

So, substituting, Φ = E_bottom * A - E_top * A. 

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. The cube has an edge of 100 m, so the area A is 100 m * 100 m = 1e4 m². 

E_bottom is 100 N/C, E_top is 60 N/C. 

So Φ = (100 - 60) * 1e4 = 40 * 1e4 = 4e5 N·m²/C. 

Wait, but wait, the electric field is downward, so when using Gauss's Law, the flux is positive? Because the direction is the same as the surface's normal. So yes, so the flux is positive.

So Φ = 4e5 N·m²/C.

Then, Q = Φ * ε0. 

Wait, what is ε0? The vacuum permittivity is 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). 

So Q = (4e5) * (8.85e-12) * (1e4? Wait, no: Wait, the area is 1e4 m², so the flux is 4e5 N·m²/C.

Wait no, let me correct. Φ is E * A, so E is 100 N/C, A is 1e4 m², so Φ is 100 * 1e4 = 1e6 N·m²/C. Similarly, E_top is 60 N/C, so E * A is 60 * 1e4=6e5 N·m²/C. So Φ = 1e6 - 6e5 = 4e5 N·m²/C.

Wait, so Φ is 4e5. So that's 400,000 N·m²/C.

So Q = 4e5 * 8.85e-12 = let's compute that.

4e5 = 400,000.

400,000 * 8.85e-12 = 400e3 * 8.85e-12 = 400 * 8.85e-9 = 354e-9 C. 354 nanoCoulombs? Wait, no, wait 8.85e-12 *4e5 = 4e5 *8.85e-12 = 4 *8.85e-7. 4 *8.85 is 35.4, times 1e-7 is 3.54e-6 C. Oh wait, 354e-9 is 3.54e-7? Wait, no, 4e5 is 400,000. Let me compute 4e5 * 8.85e-12.

4e5 is 4 * 1e5, 8.85e-12 is 8.85 * 1e-12.

Multiply them: (4 * 8.85) * 1e5 * 1e-12 = 35.4 * 1e-7 = 3.54e-6 C, which is 3.54 microCoulombs.

Looking at the options, option C is 3.54 μC. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The electric field is directed vertically downward, so the flux through the top and bottom faces is positive, right? So the bottom face has a flux of 100 * 1e4 = 1e6 N·m²/C. The top face has a flux of 60 * 1e4 = 6e5. So the net flux is 1e6 -6e5 = 4e5 N·m²/C. 

Yes, so 4e5 * ε0 = 4e5 * 8.85e-12 = 354e-7 C = 3.54e-6, which is 3.54 μC. So that's option C.

So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we use Gauss's Law, which states:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

where \( \Phi \) is the electric flux through a closed surface, \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) is the charge enclosed, and \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the vacuum permittivity (\( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/(\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2) \)).

### Key Observations:
1. The cube has horizontal faces at 200 m and 300 m altitudes, with the top face (300 m) having an electric field \( E_{\text{top}} = 60.0 \, \text{N/C} \) and the bottom face (200 m) having an electric field \( E_{\text{bottom}} = 100.0 \, \text{N/C} \).
2. The electric field is directed vertically downward, so the flux through the top and bottom faces of the cube is in the same direction (downward) relative to the cube. The flux through the side faces is zero because the electric field is horizontal and perpendicular to these faces.
3. The total electric flux through the cube is the difference in flux through the bottom and top faces:

\[
\Phi = E_{\text{bottom}} \cdot A - E_{\text{top}} \cdot A
\]

where \( A = 100 \, \text{m} \times 100 \, \text{m} = 10^4 \, \text{m}^2 \).

### Calculation:
1. Compute the flux through the bottom and top faces:
   \[
   \Phi_{\text{bottom}} = E_{\text{bottom}} \cdot A = 100.0 \cdot 10^4 = 1.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}
   \]
   \[
   \Phi_{\text{top}} = E_{\text{top}} \cdot A = 60.0 \cdot 10^4 = 6.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}
   \]

2. Subtract the flux through the top face from the flux through the bottom face to find the net flux:
   \[
   \Phi = \Phi_{\text{bottom}} - \Phi_{\text{top}} = 1.0 \times 10^6 - 6.0 \times 10^5 = 4.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}
   \]

3. Solve for the enclosed charge using Gauss's Law:
   \[
   Q_{\text{enc}} = \Phi \cdot \varepsilon_0 = (4.0 \times 10^5) \cdot (8.85 \times 10^{-12}) = 3.54 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}
   \]

4. Convert to microcoulombs:
   \[
   Q_{\text{enc}} = 3.54 \, \mu\text{C}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The net amount of charge contained in the cube is \( 3.54 \, \mu\text{C} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
