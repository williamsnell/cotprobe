Question:

This question refers to the following information.
In order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible, I have translated the term "Protoplasm," which is the scientific name of the substance of which I am about to speak, by the words "the physical basis of life." I suppose that, to many, the idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis, or matter, of life may be novel—so widely spread is the conception of life as something which works through matter. … Thus the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.
Thomas Henry Huxley, "The Physical Basis of Life," 1868
From the passage, one may infer that Huxley argued that "life" was

Options:

A: a process that breaks down ordinary matter
B: essentially a philosophical notion
C: a term that has no physical basis
D: a concept beyond human understanding
E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter
F: a result of carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds
G: a supernatural phenomenon
H: subject to continual death and renewal
I: a complex chemical reaction
J: a force that works through matter

Okay, so I have this question about the passage from Thomas Huxley's "The Physical Basis of Life." I need to figure out what he was arguing about life. The question is asking what Huxley concluded about life based on the passage.

Let me read through the passage again. He translates "Protoplasm" into "the physical basis of life." Protoplasm is the scientific name of the material of living things. So, he's saying that life has a physical basis, which is matter. 

Then he explains that life breaks down into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds. These have properties like water's, but nothing new. So, the matter of life—whether it's a plant, animal, or other organism—breaks apart into these three substances. 

Wait, but the passage doesn't say that life is broken down. It says that the matter breaks up into these substances, but does that mean the life itself breaks down? Or is it the matter that breaks down? Hmm. The passage says "the matter of life breaks up into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds." So, perhaps life as a whole is made up of these components, but does that mean life itself is broken down? Or is the matter (the living organisms) made up of these substances?

I think the passage is trying to say that the physical basis of life (the matter) is what makes life. So, Huxley is arguing that life is fundamentally based on matter. So, when he says "the matter of life," that refers to the living organisms or the components of living things. 

Looking at the options, option A says "a process that breaks down ordinary matter." But in the passage, he says the matter breaks into these chemicals, not that it's broken down into something else. So maybe he's saying life is made up of these things, but not that life itself is broken down. Alternatively, perhaps he's using "the matter of life" to refer to the living organisms, which are composed of matter.

Wait, the passage says "the matter of life" breaks up into those chemicals. So, he's saying that the living matter (like plants and animals) is composed of these three substances. So, Huxley is arguing that life is a process that breaks down ordinary matter into these substances. But is that the conclusion he makes?

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is trying to suggest that life is fundamentally dependent on matter, and that the breakdown of matter leads to the breakdown of life. So, Huxley concludes that life is based on matter. So, perhaps the answer is that life is a process that breaks down ordinary matter.

Wait, but the options are:

A: a process that breaks down ordinary matter

B: essentially a philosophical notion

C: a term that has no physical basis

D: a concept beyond human understanding

E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter

F: a result of carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds

G: a supernatural phenomenon

H: subject to continual death and renewal

I: a complex chemical reaction

J: a force that works through matter

So, looking for the conclusion. Huxley is arguing that life is based on matter. So, the matter of life (living things) are made up of carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds. So, the matter breaks down, resulting in these. So, perhaps the conclusion is that life is a process that breaks down ordinary matter. So, option A.

Wait, but option H says "subject to continual death and renewal." That's more about the process of life's cycle, not breaking down matter. So, that's not the conclusion.

Alternatively, Huxley's argument is that life is a process that breaks down ordinary matter. So, the matter of life (living organisms) is the foundation. So, when he says that the matter breaks up into these chemicals, that's the basis of life. So, he concludes that life is a process that breaks down ordinary matter.

So the correct answer would be A.

The passage by Thomas Henry Huxley argues that life is fundamentally based on matter. He translates "Protoplasm" (the matter of living things) and explains that life breaks down into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds. Thus, Huxley concludes that life is a process that breaks down ordinary matter.
