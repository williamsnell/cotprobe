Question:

A homeowner wished to have his house painted. He contacted a number of house painters in his area and asked them to submit bids to do the work. The homeowner received 10 bids. The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be

Options:

A: that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.
B: that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.
C: that the homeowner deliberately exploited the telegraph company's mistake.
D: that the telegraph company's mistake nullifies the contractual agreement.
E: that the homeowner's immediate acceptance of the bid was unreasonable.
F: that the discrepancy between the bid and the actual cost of painting is too large.
G: that the mistake made the contract unconscionable.
H: that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.
I: that the bid was not legally binding as it was sent via telegram.
J: that the homeowner failed to provide accurate specifications for the job.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this contract question. Let me read it again carefully.

The homeowner wants his house painted. He sent 10 bids to painters. The first nine range from $10k to $12.5k. The 10th bid was from a telegraph company, which sent $1k. Wait, but the telegraph company made a mistake, sending $1k instead of $10k. So the 10th bid was actually $10k, not $1k. So the bids were off by $9k each.

The homeowner accepted the 10th bid, but the painter refused. So the painter's defense is what? The options are A to I.

Option A says the homeowner should have been aware. But I don't think that's right. The bids were made, but the 10th was a mistake. So the homeowner's mistake doesn't make the painter responsible automatically.

Option B suggests the telegraph company is liable. But the company didn't act under contract. They sent the bid, but it was wrong. So liability is on the painter, not the company.

Option C says the homeowner exploited the mistake. Exploitation usually applies if the mistake was part of a contract. But here, the mistake was on the part of the telegraph company, not the contract.

Option D says the mistake nullifies the contract. Wait, a contract is a contract between two parties. If the bid is wrong, does that nullify the contract? Well, maybe, but I'm not sure. Perhaps the contract was between the painter and the homeowner. If the bid is incorrect, that might affect the contract, but I think it's more about the payment rather than the contract itself. Or maybe the painter's mistake could affect the payment, but the contract is about the work, not the payment. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Option E is that the homeowner's acceptance was unreasonable. The payment was wrong, so maybe the painter is justified in rejecting the bid. But why would the payment be wrong? The bid was $1k, but it should have been $10k. That seems wrong. So the painter might argue that the payment is unreasonable because it's way too low compared to the others.

Option F says the bid is too high. The actual cost is probably around $12k, so $1k is way off. So maybe the bid is too low, making the painter's rejection reasonable.

Option G says the mistake made the contract unconscionable. Unconscionable contracts are those where there's a clear mistake made by one party. But here, the mistake was made by the telegraph company, which didn't have a contract with the painter. The painter's mistake affects the payment, not the contract itself. So maybe the contract is still valid because the painter made a mistake in the payment. Or maybe the payment is wrong, but the contract isn't.

Option H suggests the homeowner had an affirmative duty to investigate. That's about contract law. If the painter sent a bid, the homeowner probably had a duty to check it, but perhaps the mistake here doesn't change that duty. But the mistake in the bid affects the payment, not the investigation duty.

Option I is about the bid not being legally binding. I think bids are considered legally binding, especially if they're submitted via a third party like telegraph. So I don't think that's correct.

Option J is that the bid was not accurate. But J is about the specifications, not the payment. Wait, J says the bid was not legally binding because of incorrect specs. But the specs aren't the issue here; it's the bid amount.

So putting it all together:

The bids were supposed to be in the $10k to $12.5k range. The 10th bid was $1k, which is way off. So the painter's best defense is that the bid was unreasonable because it was too low, which makes the painter's rejection reasonable. So option E says the bid was not reasonable because it was too low. So the painter would argue that the bid was unreasonable.

Wait, but the payment is from the painter. So if the bid was too low, the painter is justified in rejecting it. But the question is, why would the painter accept the 10th bid, which was $1k, when others asked for $10k to $12.5k? Because it's way too low. So the painter's best defense is that the bid was unreasonable, making their rejection reasonable. So the correct answer should be option E.

Wait, but let's think again. The homeowner accepted the bid, but the painter refused. The painter's best defense is that the bid was unreasonable because it was $1k, which is way below what others bid for. So the painter would argue that he was mistaken and the bid is wrong, making his rejection due to lack of payment acceptable. So the answer would be option E.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: that the bid was not legally binding as it was sent via telegram.**

**Explanation:** 
The bids were submitted by a third party (the telegraph company) which made a mistake, sending a $1k bid rather than the intended $10k. The homeowner accepted this bid, but the painter refused because it was too low. The painter's defense is that the bid was unreasonable, making their rejection acceptable.
