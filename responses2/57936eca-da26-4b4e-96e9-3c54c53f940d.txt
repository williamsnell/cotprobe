Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question to answer, and I'm a bit new to group theory, so I'll need to think this through carefully.

The question is about two statements related to group theory, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, let me look at Statement 1. It says, "If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K|." Wait, I remember that when you have two subgroups, the size of their product HK depends on their intersection. From what I recall, the formula for the order of the product of two subgroups is |HK| = |H| * |K| / |H ∩ K|. So Statement 1 sounds correct. But wait, I should double-check. Oh yeah, I think that's the formula for the order of the product of two subgroups when they're both subgroups of a group. So I think Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: "A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p." Hmm, okay. Let me remember what D_p is. D_p is the dihedral group of order 2p, which represents the symmetries of a regular p-gon. So, if G is a group of order 2p, p is an odd prime.

I remember that groups of order pq, where p and q are primes, have specific properties. Since p is an odd prime and 2p is the order, maybe p is the prime. So the group could be either cyclic or dihedral. Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, actually, the dihedral group D_p has order 2p, yes. But is every group of order 2p cyclic or dihedral? Or are there other possibilities?

Wait, more accurately, I think that for groups of order pq, where p and q are primes, p < q, the group is either cyclic or dihedral. But wait, isn't that only when p is less than q? So here, 2p is the order, so p and 2 are primes. Since p is an odd prime, 2 is a prime, and p is less than 2 only if p=2, but p is given as an odd prime. So p is at least 3. So 2p is the order.

Wait, so for example, if p=3, then 2p=6. The possible groups of order 6 are either cyclic (C6) or the symmetric group S3, which is also called D3. So in this case, the group is either cyclic or isomorphic to D3. So in that case, Statement 2 would be true.

But wait, is that the case for all groups of order 2p where p is an odd prime? Let me think. So more generally, if you have a group G of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, then G must be either cyclic or dihedral. Oh, but wait, hold on—what about when p=2? Then 2p=4, but p is given as an odd prime, so p can't be 2. So for p odd, 2p is even, but p is odd. So the group order is even.

Wait, another thought: The Sylow theorems might help here. The number of Sylow p-subgroups in G would be useful. For a group of order 2p, the number of Sylow p-subgroups n_p must satisfy n_p divides 2 and n_p ≡ 1 mod p. Since p is an odd prime, the only possible n_p is 1 or 2. But n_p must be congruent to 1 mod p. Let's see: For p=3, n_p must be 1 or 2, and 1 mod 3. 2 mod 3 is 2, which isn't 1, so n_p=1. So there is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup, which is normal. That would make G a semidirect product of the Sylow p-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroup.

The Sylow 2-subgroup is of order 2, so it's either the cyclic group C2 or the trivial group. But since the group is of order 2p, which is even, p is odd, so the Sylow 2-subgroup must be cyclic of order 2. So that would be C2.

So G is the semidirect product of C2 and C_p, where C_p is cyclic of order p. The action is determined by a homomorphism from C_p to Aut(C2). Since Aut(C2) is isomorphic to C1 (trivial) or C1 again? Wait, no, wait. Wait, Aut(C2) is isomorphic to C1? No, wait, no. Wait, C2 is a cyclic group of order 2, so its automorphism group is isomorphic to C1, but wait, wait, no. Wait, actually, for a cyclic group of order n, Aut(C_n) is isomorphic to C_{φ(n)}, where φ is Euler's totient function.

For n=2, φ(2)=1. So Aut(C2) has order 1, so it's trivial. Which means that the homomorphism from C_p to Aut(C2) is trivial. So the semidirect product is actually a direct product. That would make G isomorphic to C_p × C2, which is cyclic of order 2p. Wait, no. Because C_p × C2 is cyclic only if p divides 2, but p is an odd prime, so p >2. So C_p × C2 is not cyclic, but a non-abelian group.

Wait, but wait, if G is semidirect product of C_p and C2, but the action is trivial, so G is just the direct product C_p × C2, which is abelian. But the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic only if their orders are coprime. Since p is odd and 2 is even, but wait, 2 and p are coprimes because p is an odd prime. So C_p × C2 is cyclic of order 2p. Wait, no. Because C_p is order p, C2 is order 2. So their direct product is order 2p. But for the direct product of two cyclic groups, say C_m and C_n, the order is m * n. And the product is cyclic if and only if m and n are coprime. So since p and 2 are coprime, C_p × C2 is cyclic of order 2p. So G would be cyclic, in that case.

But wait, is that right? So if the homomorphism is trivial, G is the direct product. So G would be cyclic of order 2p. But that's not the only possibility because maybe when the homomorphism isn't trivial. Wait, but earlier I thought n_p =1, so only one Sylow p-subgroup. So G must be the semidirect product, but the semidirect product is only possible if the action is non-trivial, but in this case, the action must be trivial because n_p is 1, which implies that the homomorphism from C_p to Aut(C2) is trivial. Therefore, G is the direct product of C2 and C_p, which is cyclic of order 2p.

Wait, but that can't be right because some groups of order 2p are non-abelian. Wait, no, wait. Because if the homomorphism is trivial, then the action is trivial, so G must be abelian. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The group G is of order 2p. Since 2 and p are primes, and p is odd, so the possible group orders are 2p, which is abelian only if p divides 2, but since p is odd, it can't be. So G is non-abelian.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier conclusion was wrong. Let me re-examine. Let me consider p=3, so group order is 6. For G of order 6, which is either cyclic (C6) or the dihedral group D3 (which is isomorphic to S3). So in that case, it's either cyclic or dihedral.

But wait, if G is of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, and if p is 3, then 2p=6, and the group can be either cyclic or dihedral. So for higher p, does it hold that the group is cyclic or dihedral?

Wait, perhaps for p=5, 2p=10. Is there a group of order 10 other than cyclic and dihedral? No, wait, because 10=2×5. So the possible groups are cyclic (C10) and the dihedral group D5 (which is the symmetries of a regular pentagon). So for any p, the group is either cyclic or dihedral.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think about p=3. So 2p=6. The possible groups are cyclic (C6) and S3 (dihedral D3). So yes, in that case, it's either cyclic or dihedral.

But wait, what about p=5, 2p=10. Are there any other groups of order 10 besides C10 and D5? I don't think so. Because 10 factors into 2×5, and the Sylow theorems dictate that the group is either cyclic or dihedral.

Wait, but in another case, for example, p=7, 2p=14. Then, the order is 14. The Sylow p-subgroup is of order 7, which is cyclic. Then, the homomorphism from the Sylow p-subgroup to Aut(C2) must be considered. But since Aut(C2) is trivial, the homomorphism is trivial, so the group is the direct product of C2 and C7, which is cyclic of order 14. So in that case, it's cyclic. But wait, that's only if the homomorphism is trivial. Alternatively, could there be another group? Well, 14 is 2×7, and both are primes, so the group must be cyclic or dihedral. But wait, in this case, the homomorphism is trivial, leading to a direct product, which is cyclic. So in that case, the group is cyclic. So for p=7, 2p=14, G is cyclic.

Wait, but wait, what about p=2? Well, p is given as an odd prime, so p can't be 2. So the only possible groups of order 2p are cyclic and dihedral, so Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait, wait another moment. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about p=2, but p is given as an odd prime, so it's not allowed. So for all odd primes p, the group of order 2p is either cyclic or dihedral. So Statement 2 is correct.

So, to recap: Statement 1 is correct, and Statement 2 is correct. So the correct option would be B: True, True.

The analysis of the two statements:

1. **Statement 1** asserts that for subgroups H and K of a group G, the order of HK is given by |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. This is a standard result in group theory, known as the formula for the order of the product of two subgroups. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

2. **Statement 2** claims that a group of order 2p (where p is an odd prime) is either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p. This is correct because such groups can only be cyclic or dihedral. The Sylow theorems and the structure theorem for groups of order 2p (which are of order 2p, where p is an odd prime) confirm that the group must be cyclic or dihedral. Hence, Statement 2 is true.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is:

**B: True, True**
