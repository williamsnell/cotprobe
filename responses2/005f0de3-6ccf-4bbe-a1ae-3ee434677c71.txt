Question:

Catharine MacKinnon argues that since men dominate women, the question is ultimately one of power. Which proposition below is the most inconsistent with this argument?

Options:

A: The power dynamic is determined by individual strength and not gender.
B: The idea of 'woman' needs to be redefined.
C: Women inherently possess more power than men.

E: Men and women share equal power in society.
F: Equality is impossible because men define women as different.
G: Women can achieve equality through political pressure.
H: Men and women are inherently equal in all aspects.
I: The concept of power is subjective and varies from person to person.
J: The world is phallocentric and oppressive.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the argument that men dominate women and the power dynamics. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking which proposition is the most inconsistent with the argument that since men dominate women, the question is ultimately one of power.

Hmm, the argument starts by saying men dominate women. Then, the question is about power, so I think they're talking about the power structures within society. Option A says the power dynamic is determined by individual strength and not gender. That sounds directly opposite to the argument. The argument suggests that men dominate, so maybe there's a hierarchy based on strength. So if A says it's not gender, that would contradict the idea that men dominate, implying that power isn't gendered.

Option B suggests redefining the concept of 'woman.' That's a bit of a stretch. I'm not sure if this is directly opposed to the idea that men dominate women. Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the most inconsistent.

Option C says women have more power than men. That's the opposite of what the argument says. If the argument is that men dominate, then having more power than men would be contradictory. So this is a strong candidate.

Option D: Gender-based inequality is a myth. That's a classic counterpoint. If the argument is that men dominate, then this proposition would be the opposite. It's more about the myth that there are unequalities, implying that they don't exist.

Option E claims men and women share equal power. That's the opposite of the original statement. If the original says men dominate, then E is the opposite, so it's inconsistent.

Option F says equality is impossible because men define women as different. Hmm, this seems more about the limitations of men, but I'm not sure how it's inconsistent with the original argument.

Option G: Women can achieve equality through political pressure. This seems to support the idea that inequalities can be addressed, which would be consistent with the original argument.

Option H: Men and women are inherently equal. This directly contradicts the original argument. If the original says men dominate, then H is the opposite.

Option I: The concept of power is subjective and varies. This is a valid point. Power isn't fixed; it can be influenced by many factors, so this is a consistent proposition.

Option J: The world is phallocentric and oppressive. I'm not sure how this relates, but phallocentrism is a psychological term about being attractive to others, not directly about power structures. So this doesn't seem directly opposed.

Now, the question asks for the proposition that is most inconsistent. So which one directly contradicts the original argument.

The original says men dominate women. So any option that says men don't dominate (i.e., women have more power) is inconsistent. So options C, D, E, and H are all opposing. Now, the question is which is the most inconsistent.

Option C: Women inherently possess more power than men. That directly contradicts the original argument.

Option D is a myth, which is a strong counter-argument but perhaps not as directly opposed. Option E is the opposite, so that's a direct contradiction.

But the question is about which is the most inconsistent. So C and E are direct opposites.

So which one is the stronger contradiction. Option E says they share equal power. The original argument is that men dominate, so E is the opposite. So E is the most inconsistent.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the argument that men dominate women, implying that the power dynamics are based on strength. So if E says that men and women share equal power, that's not the same as men dominating. So E is the opposite of the original argument. So E is inconsistent.

But wait, the original argument is that men dominate women. So, if E says that they share equal power, that's the opposite. So E is the opposite.

Wait, but in the options, option E is that men and women share equal power. So if the original says men dominate, then E is the opposite. So E is inconsistent.

Similarly, option C says women have more power than men. So that's the direct opposite.

But the question asks which proposition is the most inconsistent. So perhaps both C and E are more inconsistent than others.

I need to think about which one is the opposite. The original statement says that men dominate women, implying that women are weaker. So any option that says women are stronger would be inconsistent.

So options C, D, E, and H.

Option H is that men and women are inherently equal. So if the original says men dominate, H is the opposite.

Option E says they share equal power. So if the original is men dominate, E is the opposite.

But the question is which of the options is the most inconsistent. So looking for the option that directly contradicts the original argument.

Option E and C are both opposites.

Wait, but the original argument is that men dominate women, so the power is not based on men's strength but is inherent in the gender. So option C says women have more power than men, which is directly the opposite of the original. So that's the inconsistency.

So the most inconsistent would be option C. Because it's the direct opposite of the original argument.

The question asks which proposition is the most inconsistent with the argument that men dominate women and the power dynamics are based on individual strength. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Suggests that power is determined by individual strength and not gender. This directly contradicts the argument that men dominate women, making it inconsistent.
- **Option B**: Redefines the concept of 'woman.' While this is a different perspective, it is not directly opposed to the original argument about unequal power structures.
- **Option C**: States that women inherently possess more power than men. This is the direct opposite of the original argument, making it the most inconsistent.
- **Option D**: Argues that gender-based inequality is a myth. This is a counter-argument but not as directly opposed to the original claim.
- **Option E**: Claims men and women share equal power. This directly contradicts the original argument, making it inconsistent.
- **Option F**: Suggests equality is impossible due to men defining women as different. This is not directly opposed to the original claim.
- **Option G**: Highlights that women can achieve equality through political pressure. This is consistent with the idea of unequal power.
- **Option H**: Claims men and women are inherently equal. This directly contradicts the original argument.
- **Option I**: Emphasizes that power is subjective and varies. This is a valid observation but not the most inconsistent.
- **Option J**: Suggests the world is phallocentric and oppressive. This does not relate to the original argument.

The most inconsistent proposition is **Option C**, as it directly opposes the original argument by stating women have more power than men.
