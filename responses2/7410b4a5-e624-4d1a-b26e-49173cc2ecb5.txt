Question:

A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?

Options:

A: It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother
B: It is a polymorphism
C: It is a sequence variant of unknown significance
D: It will change the folding of the protein

Okay, let me try to work through this question. Hmm, so it's about Marfan syndrome. I remember Marfan is a genetic disorder. Let's think about the key points here.

The patient is a 10-year-old girl. She's at the 95th percentile for height and weight. Hmm, so she's in the middle range. Her physical exam shows some issues: a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Oh wait, that makes me think of Marfan. Because Marfan affects the palate, teeth, and joints.

The mother is 163 cm tall, which is average. She has no clinical evidence of Marfan, but the patient and her mother have the same nucleotide change. Also, the same change is found in 15 out of 200 without Marfan. I'm trying to remember how often such polymorphisms occur. Oh, right, about 1 in 200. That's pretty common, which suggests it's not a rare mutation.

Marfan is caused by a specific mutation in the FBN1 gene. FBN1 stands for Frigactin Beta 1. The mutation is at position 21, I think. The mutation makes the protein nonfunctional. So the patient's mutation is the same as in her mother. Wait, but the mother has the same change. But the mother has no clinical evidence, so she's not affected. So the mother's FBN1 mutation is probably the same as the patient's. Or maybe both have it, but the mother doesn't have the disease.

Wait, the question is about the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother. The options are about what that change does. Let's look again.

The options are about what the change does: whether it's a disease-causing mutation, a polymorphism, a sequence variant, or whether it'll change protein folding.

So, the patient has a mutation in FBN1 at a certain position. Since the mother has the same change, but she doesn't have the disease. So that suggests that the mutation is present in both but isn't causing the disease. Because if it were the disease-causing mutation, the mother wouldn't have any symptoms.

Wait, but the question says the mother isn't affected, but the same change is found in 15% of the 200. So that's a common occurrence. So maybe the mutation is present in both but not causing the disease.

Looking at the options:

A: It is a disease-causing mutation. But if the mother doesn't have the disease, then the change isn't causing it. So A is incorrect.

B: It is a polymorphism. A polymorphism is a variation in a DNA sequence. The question says the mutation is single nucleotide, so it's a polymorphism. But A is about being a disease-causing mutation, which isn't the case. So B isn't correct.

C: It is a sequence variant of unknown significance. So the single nucleotide change causes it to be a nonfunctional protein. Sequence variants can do different things. But if the change is in FBN1, which is a known gene, and the mutation is known, then maybe it's a known variant. But the question says it's found in 15/200 without Marfan. So 15% is quite high, which suggests it's a common mutation. If the change is a known mutation, it's more likely to be disease-causing, but in this case, the mother doesn't have the disease. So the change isn't causing the disease. So perhaps it's a sequence variant that doesn't change function. So option C is possible.

D: It will change the folding of the protein. Well, if the FBN1 protein is nonfunctional, it can't fold properly. So changing the folding of the protein would be a consequence. But the question is, what about the mutation itself? The question says the patient's mutation is in the same locus as her mother, and the change is present in 15/200 without Marfan. So the mutation is present in both, but the mother doesn't have the disease. So the change is present but doesn't cause a disease.

Wait, the question is about what the mutation does to the patient and her mother. The patient's mutation is the same as her mother's. So the question is what does that mutation do in the context of the patient and her mother.

In Marfan, the FBN1 protein is nonfunctional. So the mutation is a disease-causing mutation. But the patient's mother doesn't have the disease. Wait, but the question says both have the same mutation. So if the mutation is in the same gene, but the mother doesn't have the disease, that suggests that the mutation is not functional for her. But the patient's disease status isn't determined yet.

Wait, the question is about the single nucleotide change. So the options are about what the change does. So if the change is in the same gene (FBN1), and it's a mutation that causes the protein to be nonfunctional, then the patient's mutation would prevent folding. But since the mother doesn't have the disease, her FBN1 is nonfunctional. But wait, Marfan's disease is when the protein is nonfunctional. So if the mother's FBN1 is nonfunctional, then she would have Marfan. But the question states that the mother has no clinical evidence of Marfan, but the same change is present. So in that case, the patient's mutation is a disease-causing mutation, and the mother's is not present because she doesn't have the disease.

Wait, but the question is about the mutation in the patient and her mother. So the patient has FBN1 mutation that prevents folding, so the answer would be D: It will change the folding of the protein. But wait, the question is about the change in the patient and her mother. The mother's change isn't present in the mother, but in the patient.

So the options: the question is about what the mutation is doing for both.

The patient's mutation is a disease-causing mutation, so the answer A is incorrect because it's not a disease-causing mutation.

The mother's mutation isn't causing the disease, so the change is present in 15% of the population without Marfan. So the change is a sequence variant that doesn't cause a functional protein. So the change is a nonfunctional mutation. So the FBN1 protein is nonfunctional, so the change affects the folding. So the patient's mutation would cause the protein to be nonfunctional, so it will change the folding (D option).

But wait, the question is about what the mutation does in both the patient and her mother. The mother doesn't have the disease, so her mutation isn't present. But the patient's mutation is present. So the patient's mutation is a disease-causing mutation, so the answer would be A. But the mother's mutation isn't present, but the question says the same change is found in the patient and her mother.

Wait, no. The question states that the mother has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. So the mother has the mutation, but doesn't have Marfan. Therefore, the change is present in both. The mother's mutation isn't causing the disease, so the change is a sequence variant that doesn't affect the protein function.

So the patient has a mutation that causes the FBN1 protein to be nonfunctional. So the answer would be D: It will change the folding of the protein.

Wait, but the options are:

A) It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother.

But the mother doesn't have the disease, so her mutation isn't causing the disease. So A is incorrect.

B) It is a polymorphism.

Yes, it's a polymorphism, but the question is about what it does. So B is about the type of mutation, not the effect.

C) It is a sequence variant of unknown significance.

If the change is in FBN1, which is a known gene, perhaps known to be a mutation causing nonfunctional proteins. So the variant is significant but may not cause a functional protein. So C could be correct.

Wait, the question is about what the change does for both the patient and her mother. The patient's mutation affects the protein function, so D is correct.

But the mother's mutation is not present. So the mother's mutation doesn't cause the disease, but the patient's does.

So the question is about what the single nucleotide change does. For the patient, it's a disease-causing mutation. For the mother, it's a sequence variant. So the answer refers to what the mutation does in both. The patient's mutation is a disease-causing mutation. The mother's isn't. So the options are about the effect.

The options are:

A: The patient's mutation is disease-causing, and the mother's is not. So A is incorrect.

B: It's a polymorphism. The change is a polymorphism, yes. But doesn't say what it does.

C: It's a sequence variant of unknown significance.

D: It affects the protein's folding.

So the patient's mutation is a disease-causing mutation. So A is wrong. The change is a mutation, not a polymorphism or sequence variant with unknown significance. The question is about what the change does.

The options for the change's effect: the change is a mutation that causes the protein to be nonfunctional. So for the patient, the change affects the protein function (so D is correct). For the mother, it's a nonfunctional mutation, but she doesn't have the disease. So the mother's mutation is a sequence variant, but not causing a disease. So the correct answer for the change is that it will change the folding (D).

So the answer is D.
</think>

The patient is a 10-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome, characterized by a 95th percentile height and 25th percentile weight. Her physical examination reveals narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity, which are typical features of Marfan syndrome. Molecular testing for FBN1 (the gene involved in Marfan syndrome) reveals a single nucleotide difference that does not alter the amino acid at that locus. The mother is 163 cm tall, average height, and has no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome. There is a 15/200 (7.5%) occurrence of this mutation in individuals without Marfan syndrome, suggesting it is relatively common.

The patient's mutation is a disease-causing mutation, as it prevents the FBN1 protein from functioning properly, which is a defining feature of Marfan syndrome. The mother's mutation is a sequence variant but does not affect protein folding. The question asks about the single nucleotide change in the context of both the patient and her mother.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **A: It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother.**  
  This is incorrect because the mother does not have Marfan syndrome, and the mutation does not cause the disease in her.

- **B: It is a polymorphism.**  
  This is correct, as the mutation is a polymorphism, but it does not address the functional impact of the mutation.

- **C: It is a sequence variant of unknown significance.**  
  This is partially correct, as the mutation is a sequence variant. However, the question is about the functional effect of the mutation, not its significance.

- **D: It will change the folding of the protein.**  
  This is correct because the mutation is a nonfunctional variant of FBN1, which prevents the protein from folding properly. This is a defining feature of Marfan syndrome.

The mutation in the patient is a disease-causing mutation, but the question focuses on the functional impact of the mutation. Since the mother's mutation does not cause the disease, the correct answer is based on the functional effect of the mutation.

ANSWER: D
