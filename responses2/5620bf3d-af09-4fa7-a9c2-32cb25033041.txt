Question:

One of the methods for the synthesis of dilute acetic acid from ethanol is the use ofacetobacter. A dilute solution of ethanol is allowed to trickle down overbeechwoodshavings that have been inoculated with a culture of the bacteria.

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the Gibbs Free Energy change for the synthesis of dilute acetic acid from ethanol. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The reaction, as written, is ethanol reacting with oxygen to produce acetic acid. The formula given is C2H5OH + O2 + H2O → Acetic Acid. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the reaction is written as C2H5OH (aq) + O2 + H2O (l) → acetic acid. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. The standard way is C2H5OH (ethanol) + O2 (oxygen) → CH3COOH (acetic acid). But in the problem statement, maybe there's a typo or perhaps I should write the balanced equation.

Wait, looking again, the reaction is written as C2H5OH + O2 CH3COOH + H2O → acetic acid. Hmm, that doesn't look right. Oh wait, perhaps the problem statement actually has the reaction as ethanol plus oxygen yielding acetic acid. Because O2 is usually a reactant, and acetic acid is the product. Or maybe it's a typo in the problem. Let me make sure.

But maybe the correct reaction is ethanol plus oxygen producing acetic acid, but that doesn't make sense because acetic acid can't be made from ethanol and O2. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait: ethanol and oxygen don't produce acetic acid. Oh wait, wait... maybe the problem statement is correct, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is ethanol plus oxygen producing acetic acid and water. Oh, wait, perhaps the balanced equation is ethanol + oxygen → acetic acid + water.

Wait, let me think. The reaction given in the problem is written as C2H5OH (aq) + O2 CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) → acetic acid. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect. Wait, maybe the reaction is written as ethanol plus oxygen producing acetic acid and water.

Wait, the problem says: The reaction can be written as C2H5OH (aq) + O2 (CH3COOH) + H2O (l) → acetic acid. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps it's ethanol plus O2 yielding acetic acid and water, which is the typical esterification reaction. So, the correct reaction is ethanol + O2 → CH3COOH + H2O. But in the problem the equation is written as ethanol plus O2 plus H2O → acetic acid. Wait, that would mean the equation is ethanol plus O2 plus H2O → acetic acid, which doesn't look right. Because O2 plus H2O would be the products. Oh, perhaps the equation is ethanol (C2H5OH) reacting with O2 and H2O to produce acetic acid. Hmm, that's not a balanced equation. Alternatively, perhaps it's ethanol plus O2 yielding acetic acid and water.

Wait, maybe the correct reaction is ethanol (C2H5OH) plus oxygen (O2) to produce acetic acid (CH3COOH) and water (H2O). So the correct balanced equation would be:

C2H5OH + O2 → CH3COOH + H2O

But in the problem statement, the equation is:

C2H5OH (aq) + O2 (CH3COOH) + H2O (l) → acetic acid

Wait, that's not balanced. Let me count the atoms:

On the left (reactants): C2H5OH has 2 C, 6 H, 1 O. O2 is O2 (so 2 O). H2O is H2O (2 H, 1 O). So total H: 6 + 2 = 8. O: 1 + 2 =3. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is C2H4O2.

Wait, so the products are CH3COOH (which is C2H4O2) and H2O (which is H2O). So the products have 2 C, 4 H, 2 O. The reactants are C2H5OH (2 C, 6 H,1 O) and O2 (2 O). So the sum of the reactants' O is 3, but the products have 2 (from acetic acid) + 1 (H2O) =3 O. So O is balanced.

H on reactants: 6 (ethanol) + 2 (H2O) =8 H. On products: 4 (from CH3COOH) +2 (from H2O) =6 H. Wait, that's a problem. So the H is not balanced. So the reaction as written doesn't balance. So perhaps the correct balanced equation is ethanol plus O2 producing acetic acid and water.

Wait, but the problem states the reaction as ethanol plus O2 plus H2O → acetic acid. That can't be correct. Oh, perhaps the problem statement made a typo, and the correct equation should be C2H5OH + O2 → CH3COOH + H2O.

But regardless, the problem asks me to calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the given reaction.

But wait, in any case, the problem gives the Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) for ethanol, water, and acetic acid. So I need to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction as written.

Wait, but the reaction as written is not balanced. So perhaps the given reaction is actually the esterification reaction, ethanol plus oxygen to form acetic acid and water.

Wait, but the problem's given equation is C2H5OH + O2 + H2O → acetic acid. That doesn't seem to balance. So perhaps the equation is incorrect, and I should proceed under the assumption that the reaction is as I wrote, but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is ethanol plus O2 yielding acetic acid and water, which is a correct equation. So perhaps the given reaction in the question is actually Ethanol (C2H5OH) plus O2 → Acetic acid (CH3COOH) + H2O.

But in the problem statement, the equation is written as:

C2H5OH (aq) + O2 (aq) + H2O (l) → acetic acid (aq)

Wait, that's impossible, because ethanol can't form acetic acid and water. Unless it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is C2H5OH + O2 → CH3COOH + H2O.

But the problem states the equation as C2H5OH + O2 CH3COOH + H2O → acetic acid. That's probably a typo and should be C2H5OH + O2 → CH3COOH + H2O.

So perhaps the correct balanced reaction is:

C2H5OH (aq) + O2 (g) → CH3COOH (l) + H2O (l)

Assuming that ethanol and oxygen react to form acetic acid and water.

But given that, I need to calculate the ΔG° for this reaction. The formula provided is the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for ethanol, water, and acetic acid. So perhaps I should calculate the ΔG for the reaction using the ΔGf° values.

The standard Gibbs free energy change for a reaction is calculated using the formula:

ΔG° = Σ ΔGf° (products) - Σ ΔGf° (reactants)

So in this case, the reactants are ethanol and O2, and the products are acetic acid and H2O.

Wait, but wait, the equation is ethanol + O2 → acetic acid + H2O. So, the products are CH3COOH and H2O.

So, the ΔG for the reaction is [ΔGf°(CH3COOH) + ΔGf°(H2O)] - [ΔGf°(C2H5OH) + ΔGf°(O2)].

Wait, but I should double-check the standard Gibbs of formation for O2. Because O2 is an element in its standard state, so its ΔGf° is zero. So O2 is a reactant with ΔGf° = 0.

So let me plug in the values given.

The given data:

Ethanol (C2H5OH): ΔGf° = -43.39 kcal/mol

Water (H2O): ΔGf° = -56.69 kcal/mol

Acetic acid (CH3COOH): ΔGf° = -95.38 kcal/mol

Oxygen (O2): ΔGf° = 0.

So substituting into the equation:

ΔG° = [(-95.38) + (-56.69)] - [(-43.39) + 0 ]

= [ (-152.07) ] - [ (-43.39) ]

= (-152.07) + 43.39 = -108.68 kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is -120.5, option G is -108.7.

Wait, but wait, is O2 part of the reactants or products? In the reaction equation, ethanol and O2 are reactants, and products are acetic acid and H2O.

So the formula is correct. So the calculation is:

ΔG° = (ΔGf products) - (ΔGf reactants)

= [ (-95.38) + (-56.69) ] - [ (-43.39) + 0 ]

Adding each part:

ΔGf products: (-95.38) + (-56.69) = -152.07

ΔGf reactants: (-43.39) + 0 = -43.39

ΔG° = (-152.07) - (-43.39) = (-152.07) + 43.39 = -108.68 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option G is -108.7, which is approximately -108.7.

So the correct answer would be option G.

To calculate the Gibbs Free Energy change, ∆G°, for the synthesis of dilute acetic acid from ethanol, we use the standard Gibbs Free Energy of Formation (ΔGf°) values provided. The reaction is written as:

**Ethanol + Oxygen → Acetic Acid + Water**

The correct balanced equation for this reaction is:

**C₂H₅OH (aq) + O₂ (g) → CH₃COOH (l) + H₂O (l)**

The formula for ΔG° is:

**ΔG° = Σ ΔGf° (products) - Σ ΔGf° (reactants)**

From the problem, the standard Gibbs Free Energy of Formation values are:
- Ethanol (C₂H₅OH): -43.39 kcal/mol
- Water (H₂O): -56.69 kcal/mol
- Acetic acid (CH₃COOH): -95.38 kcal/mol
- Oxygen (O₂): 0 kcal/mol (element in its standard state)

Substituting these values into the formula:

**ΔG° = [(-95.38) + (-56.69)] - [(-43.39) + 0]**

1. Calculate the sum of the products:
   - ΔGf°(CH₃COOH) + ΔGf°(H₂O) = (-95.38) + (-56.69) = -152.07 kcal/mol

2. Calculate the sum of the reactants:
   - ΔGf°(C₂H₅OH) + ΔGf°(O₂) = (-43.39) + 0 = -43.39 kcal/mol

3. Subtract the reactants from the products:
   - ΔG° = (-152.07) - (-43.39) = (-152.07) + 43.39 = -108.68 kcal/mol

The closest option to this calculated value is **-108.7 kcal/mol**, which corresponds to option **G**.
