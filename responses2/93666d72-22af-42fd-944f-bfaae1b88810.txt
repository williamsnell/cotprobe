Question:

Terri opened a fast food restaurant. The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. She has to pay daily operational costs of $250 and labor costs of $400. What expression represents her total cost if she has had the restaurant open for “ D ” days?

Options:

A: 800,000 + 400 D
B: 250 + 800,000 D
C: 400 + 800,000 D
D: 800,000 − 650 D
E: 800,000 + 650 D
F: 800,000 + 150 D
G: 800,000 + 1050 D
H: 800,000 − 150 D
I: 650 + 800,000 D
J: 800,000 + 250 D

Okay, so Terri opened a fast-food restaurant, and I need to figure out the correct expression for her total cost based on the number of days she's been open. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's break down the information given. The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. That's a fixed cost because it doesn't change with the number of days the restaurant is open. So, whatever the total cost is, this part will always be there.

Next, she has to pay daily operational costs of $250. That's another fixed cost because it's a cost that's applied each day. So, for each day D, she has to spend $250. So that would be 250 multiplied by D, which is 250D.

Then, there are labor costs of $400. Wait, does that mean she has to pay $400 every day, or is that a one-time cost? The wording says "labor costs of $400." I think that she has to pay $400 for each day she works. So, that's another fixed cost. So that would be 400 multiplied by D, which is 400D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. If all those are fixed costs, then the total cost would be the sum of all fixed costs. So, initial cost plus daily operational plus labor costs.

So, the initial cost is $800,000. That's a fixed cost. Then, each day, she has $250 operational cost and $400 labor cost. So, each day, she's adding 250 + 400 = $650 to her total cost. So, over D days, the additional cost is 650D.

So, the total cost is the initial cost plus 650D. So, 800,000 + 650D.

Looking at the options, option E is 800,000 + 650 D, which matches what I just figured out.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The options are:

A: 800,000 + 400 D
B: 250 + 800,000 D
C: 400 +800,000 D
D: 800,000 − 650 D
E: 800,000 + 650 D
F: 800,000 + 150 D
G: 800,000 + 1050 D
H: 800,000 − 150 D
I: 650 + 800,000 D
J: 800,000 + 250 D

Wait, option J is 800,000 + 250 D, which would be if she only had operational costs, not labor. But the problem states labor costs are $400, so that's not it.

Similarly, option D is 800,000 − 650 D, which doesn't make sense because the costs can't decrease; they would keep increasing over days.

Option E seems correct because it's the sum of the fixed cost and the variable costs. So, adding $650 per day.

The correct expression for Terri's total cost after D days is the sum of the fixed opening cost and the variable daily costs. Each day adds $250 operational and $400 labor, totaling $650 per day. Thus, the expression is 800,000 + 650D.

Answer: E
