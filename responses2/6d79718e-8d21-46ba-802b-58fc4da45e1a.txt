Okay, so I have this question about inflation and purchasing power. Hmm, I need to figure out what happens when there's inflation. I remember that inflation is when prices go up over time. But how does that affect the purchasing power of money?

Purchasing power refers to how much value money has after considering changes in price levels. So if prices rise, each unit of money buys fewer goods and services. That sounds right. For example, if a loaf of bread used to cost $1 and now it costs $1.20, the same amount of money can't buy as much. So purchasing power decreases.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The question is asking what happens to purchasing power when there's inflation. So when inflation occurs, prices go up, so the same amount of money buys fewer things. That would mean purchasing power decreases.

Looking at the options:

A: Purchasing power increases. No, because inflation makes prices rise, so purchasing power goes down. So A is wrong.

B: Remains the same. That doesn't make sense. If prices rise, money's purchasing power decreases.

C: Decreases and less goods can be bought with the same money. That sounds correct. The purchasing power is the ability to buy more with money. So if prices are higher, you can't buy as much with the same money.

D: Fluctuates unpredictably. In the question, it's specifically about the effect of inflation, which is a consistent economic phenomenon. So the purchase power should decrease steadily, not fluctuate.

So the correct answer should be C. The purchasing power decreases, and less goods can be purchased with the same amount of money.

The correct answer is C: Purchasing power decreases and less goods can be purchased with the same amount of money.
