Okay, so I've got this question about utilitarianism and what Brandt defends. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is about the version of utilitarianism that Brandt defends, and it's asking about the "function" of "rightness" in that system. The options are A to J, each describing different factors.

I remember that utilitarianism is all about the greatest good for the greatest number. The main idea is that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being. So, the concept revolves around the consequences of actions.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's the amount of harm. Wait, that doesn't sound right because each action's consequences are evaluated, not just the harm. So A might not be the right answer.

Option B talks about whether the maxim can be universalized. That sounds more like the scope of utilitarianism rather than the function of rightness itself. So probably not B.

Option C is about the moral character of the person. That's more about the nature of the person rather than the action's consequence. So C is probably not the answer.

Option D is the distribution of wealth. That's more about equity, not about the consequences of an action. So D is probably not it.

Option E is the consequences of particular acts. Hmm, that rings a bell. Because in utilitarianism, rightness is determined by the consequences—so E would be part of the function. But let me think again.

Wait, another thought. The question is about the function of "rightness" in Brandt's version. The key point is that Brandt, I think, was critical of certain aspects of utilitarianism, maybe the issues with consequences or universalization.

Oh, I remember that Brandt's views on utilitarianism were more about the consequences rather than the maxim being universalizable. So he might have argued against the idea that the same maxim applies everywhere, which would be option B.

Wait, the question is about what the function of rightness is. So if rightness is based on consequences, then the function is about the consequences. So the function is about the consequences of the action.

Wait, let me read the options again. Option E is 'the consequences of particular acts.' That directly refers to the outcome. So in utilitarianism, the idea is that the right action is the one that leads to the greatest overall happiness, which is determined by its consequences.

So the function of rightness is in evaluating consequences. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, what about the other options? Option A is about the amount of harm. That's more about the negative consequences, but not the broader function of rightness.

Option B is about the maxim being universalizable, which is more about whether the same maxim applies to everyone, which isn't the function of rightness itself.

So, yeah, I think the correct answer is E. The function of rightness is the consequences of particular acts.

The version of utilitarianism that Brandt defends emphasizes the consequences of actions as the determining factor for rightness. This means the function of rightness is based on the outcomes of particular acts.

Answer: E
