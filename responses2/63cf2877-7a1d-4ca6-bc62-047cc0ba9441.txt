Okay, so I have this question about the Pleistocene era and some islands. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question is about the last character of the response, so I need to make sure I'm getting that right. The question is about the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo forming what, and the landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania being called what.

First, I'm trying to remember the geological terms. The Pleistocene is the last ice age, around 12-16 million years ago. During this period, a lot of glacial activity happened, including the breakup of the supercontinuum ice sheet (SCS). I think the SCS was responsible for the breakup of the superhighway of the continent, leading to the splitting of major landmasses.

So, the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo must be part of the split landmass. I remember that in the Pleistocene, the SCS broke off at the equator, leading to the formation of major landmasses. The Sunda Islands are part of that split. The Sunda region is also known as the "Great Divide," which separates Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania from Western Australia and the Pacific. So, the islands in question probably formed the Sunda Islands.

Now, the second part of the question: the landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. I think that's called the Sunda Plateau. But wait, sometimes I've heard it referred to as the Wallacea Plateau. Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. Let me think. The Sunda Islands are part of the Sunda Plateau, which is a large area of the South Australian Plateau. The Wallacea Plateau is another term I've heard in the context of the Australian Plateau, which includes the Borneo and Sumatra islands. But wait, the Sunda Islands are part of the larger Sunda Plateau, which is a part of the South Australian Plateau. So, the correct term for the landmass is the Sunda Plateau, which is sometimes called the Sunda Islands themselves. Alternatively, I might be mixing terms here.

Wait, no. The Sunda Islands are part of the Sunda Plateau, which is a larger area. The Sunda Plateau is also known as the Sunda Islands. But I'm not sure if the plateau is called Sunda or Wallacea. Alternatively, perhaps the "Sahul" is another term. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The Sunda Islands are a group of islands that formed part of the Sunda Plateau. The landmass that connects Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania is the Sunda Plateau. So, perhaps the correct answer for the second part is Sunda or Wallacea.

Wait, no. I think the Sunda Islands are part of the Sunda Plateau. So, the correct term would be Sunda. Because the Sunda Plateau is sometimes called the Sunda Islands. Alternatively, I've heard it referred to as the Walla. Maybe I should check my notes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's called the Sunda Region. Wait, but the options are specific. Let's look at the options again. The options are options A to J.

The first part is the islands forming Sunda; or Wallacea; etc. The options are:

A: Sunda; Sahul
B: Sunda; Wallacea
C: Gondwana; Beringia
D: Sunda; Gondwana
E: Beringia; Sunda
F: Wallacea; Sunda
G: Wallacea; Beringia
H: Gondwana; Sahul
I: Beringia; Sahul
J: Sahul; Wallacea

Wait, so the options for the first part are between Sunda and Wallacea. The second part is between Sunda and Wallacea.

So, the islands are Sunda. So the first blank is Sunda.

The second blank is the landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. I think that's the Sunda Plateau, which is sometimes called the Sunda Islands. Alternatively, I've heard it referred to as the Walla. But looking at the options, the options for the second blank are either Sunda or Wallacea.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The Sunda Plateau is a large area. The Sunda Islands are part of it. The Sunda Plateau is sometimes called the Sunda Islands. So, the correct term for the landmass would be Sunda. So, the first blank is Sunda, the second blank is Sunda? Or is it Wallacea?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the timeline. The Pleistocene split the continent around 11.5 million years ago. The SCS split the continent into the Australian and Western Australia, the Pacific, and the Sunda Plateau. The Sunda Plateau is a major landmass that includes the Sunda Islands.

Wait, so the second part is the landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. That's the Sunda Plateau. So, the second part would be Sunda.

But looking at the options, option B is Sunda; Wallacea. Option F is Wallacea; Sunda. I'm not sure whether the correct term is Sunda or Walla.

Wait, I think the correct term is the Sunda Plateau, which is called the Sunda Islands. But in the options, the first blank is Sunda, which is correct. For the second blank, I think it's called the Sunda Region, sometimes called Sunda, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the islands mentioned are the Sunda Islands, so the first blank is Sunda. The landmass is the Sunda Plateau, which is sometimes called the Sunda Islands. So the second blank is Sunda. Then looking at the options, option B is Sunda; Wallacea. Option F is Wallacea; Sunda.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about the other SUTBA terms. The Sunda Plateau is sometimes called the Sunda Islands. So the correct term for the second blank is Sunda. So the second part is Sunda.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is Sunda; Wallacea. option F is Wallacea; Sunda.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is the Sunda Plateau, which is sometimes called the Walla. Wait, I think the correct term is the Walla. Or perhaps the Sunda Plateau is called the Walla. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct answer. I think the correct answer is B: Sunda; Wallacea. Or F. Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the Sunda Islands are part of the Sunda Plateau, which is sometimes called the Walla. So the second part is Walla. So the options would be B: Sunda; Walla or F: Walla; Sunda. Looking at the options, option F is Wallacea; Sunda.

Wait, I think I'm mixing this up. Let me think again. The correct term for the landmass is known as the Walla. So the second part should be Walla. So, the answer would be B: Sunda; Walla or option F: Walla; Sunda.

Wait, but the correct answer is option B: Sunda; Walla.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the correct answer is Sunda for the first part and Walla for the second. Looking at the options, that's option B: Sunda; Walla.

Alternatively, the correct term is Sunda for the landmass. So the second blank is Sunda.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let me think of the options. The second part is either Sunda or Wallacea.

The first part is Sunda, correct. So the options for the second part are either Sunda or Wallacea.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is the Sunda Plateau, which is the same as the Walla. So the second part is Walla.

So the options for the question are:

Which is option A: Sunda; Sahul. No.

B: Sunda; Walla.

Yes, because the landmass is called the Walla.

So the answer is B: Sunda; Walla.
</think>

The Pleistocene era saw the breakup of the superhighway of the continent, leading to the formation of the Sunda Islands as part of the larger Sunda Plateau. The landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania is known as the Sunda Plateau, which is sometimes referred to as the Walla. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as the first blank should be "Sunda," not "Sahul."
- **B**: Correct, as it states "Sunda" for the first part and "Walla" for the second part.
- **C**: Incorrect, as it refers to "Gondwana," which is unrelated to the Pleistocene era.
- **D**: Incorrect, as it mentions "Gondwana," which is the superhighway of the continent, not the landmass.
- **E**: Incorrect, as it refers to "Beringia," which is unrelated to the Pleistocene.
- **F**: Incorrect, as it mentions "Walla" for the first part, which is not accurate.
- **G**: Incorrect, as it refers to "Walla," which is not the correct term for the first part.
- **H**: Incorrect, as it mentions "Gondwana," which is the superhighway, not the landmass.
- **I**: Incorrect, as it refers to "Beringia," which is unrelated.
- **J**: Incorrect, as it mentions "Sahul," which is not accurate.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: Sunda; Walla**.
