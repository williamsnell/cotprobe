Question:

This question refers to the following information.
In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a "humanness"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, "The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857," 1990

Okay, so I have this question about the Cawnpore massacres, and I need to figure out the correct answer based on the provided information. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the question is asking about the death of British citizens at Cawnpore. The options are A to D, each making a different point about this event.

Looking at the first passage, it describes that the Cawnpore massacres were done by a "subject race" — black men who shed blood of their masters and poor women and children. It goes on to talk about the various wars they had involved, including religion, race, and revenge. So it's a war of destruction, not just violence.

The second passage is by Rudrangshu Mukherjee. It talks about the British rule in India, particularly the 1857 revolt that disrupted the British dominance. It mentions that the British had a "dominance" and "superiority" hierarchy based on race and civilization. The rulers treated the Indians as animals, which led to their suffering. So, it's about the British's perceived superiority and the resultant atrocities.

The question is specifically about the death of British citizens at Cawnpore. From the passages, I remember that the British, under colonial rule, were seen as superior to the local population, especially the Indians. The first passage's second point says that the British "superiority" meant they denied the Indians a "humanness." So, they treated them as animals, leading to their suffering.

The options are about this event. Option A says it's a betrayal of a "higher" race by a "lesser" race. The first passage says that the British were dealing with "lesser" races (like black men and poor women), so maybe this is correct. But I'm not sure yet.

Option B says it's a regrettable but avoidable mistake. The second passage seems to suggest that the British had a system that caused their atrocities, so maybe this is a mistake. But I'm not certain.

Option C says it was the British themselves who did it. But the first passage states it was done by a "subject race," implying it was the British. So C might be incorrect.

Option D says it was a religious duty. The first passage doesn't mention religion as a reason, but the second passage does talk about religious aspects. However, the question is about the death of British citizens, not religious crimes. So probably not D.

Let me think again. The question is about the death of British citizens. The first passage's first point says that the Cawnpore massacres were done by "subject race" — black men and poor women. The second passage argues that the British had a system that treated them as superior. So the death was due to the British's system, which was a form of "superiority" leading to their crimes.

So looking at the options:

A: betrayal of higher race (lesser race) by lower. That's what the first passage says about the races affected.

B: regrettable mistake. The first passage doesn't directly say the British were making mistakes, but the second passage does talk about the system, which caused atrocities. So perhaps it's a mistake that the British had a system, but the question is about the cause of the deaths.

Wait, the question is about the death of British citizens. So the deaths were of the British. The point in the first passage is that the British were the ones doing it. So the options:

A: The deaths were a betrayal of a higher race (lesser race) by a lower race. That fits.

B: It was a mistake, but the question is about the event. The first passage doesn't say the British made mistakes, except that the system of superior races led to their atrocities. But the specific cause is the British themselves.

So the correct answer would be A: seems to mark a betrayal of a "higher" race (lesser) by a "lesser" race (the British). Or the first passage says "lesser" races, so the British are the "lesser" race.

Wait, no, the first passage says "subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children." So the British are the "lesser" race in that context. The "higher" race would be the local Indian population. So the event was a betrayal of the "higher" race (the Indians) by the "lesser" race (the British). So option A is correct.

Option B says it's a mistake, but the first passage doesn't directly say that. Instead, the second passage talks about the British system causing the atrocities, but the question is about the cause of the deaths—so the event is a result of the British system, not necessarily a mistake.

So the answer should be A.

The death of British citizens at Cawnpore, as described in the passages, is attributed to a system of "superiority" that the British imposed, which treated the local population as superior. This led to their suffering, including the massacres. The first passage emphasizes that the British "subject race" consisted of "lesser" races (black men and poor women), whereas the local population was the "higher" race. Therefore, the event is seen as a betrayal of the "higher" race by the "lesser" race. 

Option A correctly captures this, while the other options either misattribute the cause or do not align with the evidence.
