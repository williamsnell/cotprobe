Okay, so I've got this optics problem here. Let me read it again. So, there's a circular object that's 4 cm in diameter. It's placed 40 cm from a lens, and the image formed has a diameter of 2 cm. The question is asking for the distance of the image from the lens and the power of the lens. The options are A through J. 

Hmm. Right, I remember that when dealing with lenses, the magnification formula and the thin lens equation are really important here. Let me think about what each part means. 

First, the object size is 4 cm, and the image size is 2 cm. So, the image is smaller than the object. Wait, but in what direction? If the object is placed in front of a lens, the image could be inverted or upright depending on the type of lens. Oh, wait, but the question doesn't specify if it's a converging or diverging lens. So maybe I can figure that out based on the image size.

Wait, the object is 4 cm and the image is 2 cm. So, the magnification (m) is image size divided by object size. So m = 2/4 = 0.5. 

Magnification can also be expressed as m = -di/do, where di is the image distance and do is the object distance. Wait, that's right. So, m = - di/do. 

But wait, the magnification is negative if the image is inverted. But in this case, the image size is smaller than the object, but the direction isn't given. Hmm. Wait, the object is 4 cm, but the image is 2 cm. So, the image is smaller. So, if m is 0.5, that suggests that the image is inverted. Because magnification is negative when inverted, but in this case, the image size is smaller. So, the image is smaller in size and inverted. 

So, using magnification formula: m = - di/do. 

But wait, I don't know the sign of m yet. I also don't know whether the lens is converging or diverging. But the object is in front of it. Let me think about what the magnification tells me.

Wait, we can relate the magnification formula with the thin lens equation. The thin lens equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length. But I don't know f yet. Hmm.

Wait, I also have information about the image distance. The problem states that the object is 40 cm from the lens. So, do is 40 cm. Wait, but wait, the object size is 4 cm, and the image size is 2 cm. So, magnification is 0.5. 

So, m = - di/do = 0.5. Wait, no, wait. Because m is 2/4 = 0.5, but sign depends on inversion. Let me think: if the image is inverted, then m is negative. So, m is -0.5. So, -0.5 = - di/do. So, di/do = 0.5. Which implies di = 0.5 * do. So, di = 0.5 * 40 cm = 20 cm. So, the image is at 20 cm from the lens. 

Wait, but wait a second. Because if the object is 40 cm in front of the lens, and the image is 20 cm behind, then the image is real. But wait, if the object is placed at 40 cm, and the image is 20 cm behind, that would be in front, right? Wait, no, wait. The image distance di is positive if it's on the opposite side of the lens from the object. So, if the object is in front (do positive), then di being positive would mean the image is in front. But in this case, di=20 cm, which is positive, so the image is in front. But wait, that would mean the image is real. But wait, with a magnification of 0.5, the image is smaller than the object. So, if the object is 4 cm in front, image is 2 cm in front. But if the image is real, then the lens is converging. Because a diverging lens would produce virtual images. So, if di is positive, the image is real. So, the lens must be converging. 

Wait, but wait again. The object is in front, the image is in front, so the image is real, so the lens is converging. So, that's correct. So, the image distance is 20 cm. Now, we can find the focal length using the thin lens equation. 

The thin lens equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. So, do is 40 cm, di is 20 cm. 

Let me plug in the numbers:

1/f = 1/40 + 1/20. 

Wait, 1/40 is 0.025, 1/20 is 0.05. So 0.025 + 0.05 = 0.075. So, 1/f = 0.075. So f = 1/0.075. 

Calculating that, 1 divided by 0.075 is approximately 13.333... cm. So, the focal length f is 13.33 cm. 

Now, power of the lens is 1/f in diopters. So, power P = 1/f. Since f is in meters, I have to convert 13.33 cm to meters. 13.33 cm is 0.1333 meters. 

So, P = 1 / 0.1333 â‰ˆ 7.5 diopters. 

Wait, let me do the exact calculation. 13.3333 cm = 0.133333 m. So, 1 / 0.133333 is 7.5. 

So, the power is 7.5 diopters. 

But wait, the options are: 

Looking at the options, I see option H is 20 cm, 7.5 diopters. So, the image distance is 20 cm, and power is 7.5. So, option H is 20 cm and 7.5 diopters. 

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Did I get the object and image distances correctly? 

Wait, the object is 40 cm from the lens, so do=40 cm. The image is 20 cm from the lens, so di=20 cm. So, using the formula, yes, that's correct. 

So the image is 20 cm from the lens, and the power is 7.5 diopters. Looking at the options, H is 20 cm, 7.5 diopters. 

But wait, the options are given as (distance, power). So the first option in the choices that matches is option H. 

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the image is 2 cm in diameter. So, the magnification is 0.5. But when the image is inverted, that's correct. So, everything seems to add up. 

Wait, but let me think again. So, the image is 2 cm in diameter, so 4 cm object and 2 cm image. So, the linear magnification is 0.5. So, m = -0.5. 

So, m = - di / do = -0.5. Since do is 40 cm, di is -0.5 * 40 = -20 cm. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. 

Wait wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, the magnification is m = - di/do. So, m = 0.5 or -0.5? Let me get this right. 

The image is smaller than the object, which is 4 cm to 2 cm. So, the image is smaller and inverted. So, the magnification is negative. So, m = -0.5. 

Wait, so m = - di/do. So, -0.5 = - di / 40. So, di /40 = 0.5. So, di = 20 cm. So, the image is 20 cm from the lens. 

So, that's correct. The image distance is 20 cm. So, using the thin lens equation, 1/f = 1/40 + 1/20 = 0.025 + 0.05 = 0.075. So, f = 1/0.075 = 13.333 cm. 

Power is 1/f in meters. So, 13.333 cm = 0.13333 m. So, 1/0.13333 = 7.5 diopters. 

So, that's correct. So, the image is 20 cm from the lens, and the power of the lens is 7.5 diopters. Looking at the options, option H is 20 cm, 7.5 diopters. So, the correct answer is option H. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 20 cm, 7.5 diopters. So, that's our answer.

To solve the problem, we use the magnification formula and the thin lens equation. The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = \frac{\text{image size}}{\text{object size}} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
\]

Since the image is smaller and inverted, the magnification is negative, so:

\[
m = -0.5 = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]

Here, \( d_o = 40 \, \text{cm} \) (object distance) and \( d_i \) is the image distance. Rearranging:

\[
\frac{d_i}{40} = 0.5 \implies d_i = 20 \, \text{cm}
\]

The image is real, so the lens is converging. Using the thin lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Substituting \( d_o = 40 \, \text{cm} \) and \( d_i = 20 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{20} = 0.025 + 0.05 = 0.075
\]

Thus, the focal length is:

\[
f = \frac{1}{0.075} \approx 13.33 \, \text{cm}
\]

The power of the lens is:

\[
P = \frac{1}{f} \, \text{(in meters)} = \frac{1}{0.1333} \approx 7.5 \, \text{diopters}
\]

Finally, the image is located 20 cm from the lens, and the lens has a power of 7.5 diopters. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**H: 20 cm, 7.5 diopters**
