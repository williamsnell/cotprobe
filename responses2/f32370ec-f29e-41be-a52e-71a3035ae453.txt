Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a water pipe with a leak. The pressure is 80 psi, and the area of the leak is 0.01 square inches. The question is asking how much force is needed to stop the leak. The options are A to J, with various units.

Hmm, I remember that pressure is force per unit area. Oh right, the formula is Pressure (P) equals Force (F) divided by Area (A), or P = F/A. So I need to rearrange this to find the force. That would be Force equals Pressure multiplied by Area, F = P * A.

Wait, but units! Oh yeah, psi is pounds per square inch. So, pressure is 80 lb/in². The area is 0.01 in². So I multiply them together.

Let me calculate that. 80 times 0.01 is 0.8. So the force is 0.8 pounds. But wait, oh wait, let me think again. Because sometimes units can be tricky.

Wait, 80 psi times 0.01 in² equals 0.8 lb. So that's 0.8 pounds of force. Looking at the options, option E is 0.8 lb. So that would be the answer, right?

Wait, but let me double-check that I didn't mix up anything. Oh, wait, no. Because the question is about the force required to stop the leak. So if the leak is releasing water, and you're trying to stop it, you need to apply enough force to counteract the pressure. So yes, the force would be pressure times area.

So, 80 psi is 80 pounds per square inch. Multiply by 0.01 in²: 80 * 0.01 is 0.8 lb. So that makes sense. So the force is 0.8 lb, which is option E.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think about the units again. 80 lb/in² times 0.01 in² equals 0.8 lb. That seems right. Oh, but wait, is there any conversion factor I'm missing? No, because psi is lb per in², so multiplying by in² cancels out the area unit.

So the answer should be E: 0.8 lb.

The pressure is given as 80 psi (pounds per square inch) and the area of the leak is 0.01 square inches. To find the force required to stop the leak, we use the formula \( F = P \times A \). 

Substituting the values:
\[
F = 80 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \times 0.01 \, \text{in}^2 = 0.8 \, \text{lb}.
\]

This matches option E.
