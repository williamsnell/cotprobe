Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes."
Germania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.

Okay, so I have this question about Roman society, and I need to figure out the answer. The question is about a specific historical event described in a text. Let me read through it again.

The text talks about a period where the Bructeri (later known as the Chamavi and Angrivarii) entered their settlements and drove them out. They did this with the help of neighboring tribes, and the explanation is that this was due to hatred, plunder, or the neighboring tribes' favor. The text also mentions that over 60,000 people, not just Roman army and weapons, but grander than Roman armies, fell into their settlements. It also says that while the empire is moving us along, fortune doesn't give more than discord among our foes.

So what does this tell us about Roman society? Let's break it down.

The text shows that the Bructeri's expansion was driven by fear and eventually conflict. They were driven out of their lands, which probably shows that they felt threatened or lost their lands. The fact that they were driven out with neighboring help, even if it was through hatred or greed, suggests that they might have felt that the interests of the neighboring tribes were more important than their own.

The numbers are also significant—over 60,000. That's a lot, implying a big conflict. The fact that it's not just Roman armies but also other people falling into their lands suggests that it wasn't just a small group. The use of words like "not beneath" and "before our delighted eyes" indicates that it was a significant event, not just a minor conflict.

The text continues by noting that the tribe didn't even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. That suggests that although the conflict was happening, the tribe's actions didn't make us happy. So it was a conflict that they were experiencing, but they didn't tolerate it, perhaps because the interests of the neighboring tribes were more important.

The last part says that while the empire is moving us, fortune doesn't give more than discord. So the tribe's conflict was leading to their own downfall, not just a passive response, but a direct cause for their own destruction. This shows that their actions were leading to their own downfall, indicating that the conflict was not just a minor issue but was a significant threat.

Looking at the answer options:

A: Disgust for barbarian peoples. The text doesn't mention anyone being particularly grumpy or disgusted. It talks about their destruction driven by fear or greed, but not necessarily disgust. So this might not be the best fit.

B: Concern about barbarian attacks. The text does talk about encounters with barbarian peoples, but the main point is about the tribe's expansion and their own destruction. So concern about barbarian attacks is a possible angle, but I think the key is the reasons behind their destruction.

C: Absence of Stoicism. Stoicism is about being rational and not getting swayed by greed or fear. The text suggests that they were driven out due to their own fears and the neighboring tribes' favor. This indicates a lack of rationality or a reaction to their own needs, which might lean more towards Stoic-like behavior if they were more rational. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

D: Maintenance of large armies. The text shows that the tribe was struggling with their own expansion and eventually leading to their own destruction. This suggests that their actions were leading to their downfall, possibly implying a problem with their own military strategy—maybe they were not maintaining large armies. But the text doesn't explicitly state that they maintained large armies, only that their own expansion led to their own destruction. So this might be more about the outcome than the attitude.

Wait, the question is about the views expressed as evidence of which in Roman society. The text implies that the tribe's actions led them to division among themselves or their own downfall. The passage shows that the tribe's expansion was driven by fear of conflict and perhaps even hatred. The text also says they "did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict." So their actions may have been a direct threat, not just a passive reaction.

In Roman times, cooperation with neighbors was often seen as a way to prevent conflict. So if the tribe was driven out of their territories, perhaps they were acting against the neighbor's interests. This might have led to internal divisions or a loss of trust among neighbors. The fact that they were destroying their own populations suggests that perhaps their way of life was causing more harm than the neighbor's way. So this could indicate that Roman society had divisions because of the challenges faced by these tribes.

Looking at the options again, the text's focus is on the tribe's destruction being driven by fear, perhaps even hatred, leading to their own downfall. This suggests that Roman society was divided due to their own struggles, possibly because of the conflicts they faced. So the views expressed in the text are best seen as evidence of concern about barbarian attacks (option B), or maybe the absence of Stoicism (option C), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the text doesn't directly state that they were maintaining large armies, but their own destruction suggests that their military might not have been as strong as the empire's. But the options only give us four choices. 

I think the answer is B: Concern about barbarian attacks. Because the text mentions encounters with barbarian peoples, but the main point is the tribe's own destruction. The view is that the tribe was experiencing conflict, perhaps due to their own fears or the neighboring tribes' favor, leading to their own downfall. So this shows concern for the barbarians (if the barbarians were the neighbors) or their own problems, implying that the Roman society had issues with their own conflicts leading to their own destruction.

The text describes the expansion and eventual destruction of the Chamavi and Angrivarii (Bructeri) as a direct result of their fear, greed, or hatred, driven by neighboring tribes' favor. The tribe's destruction, though not just a minor conflict, indicates a significant threat to their own populations. This suggests that Roman society faced internal divisions due to the challenges posed by these tribes, possibly due to conflicts with neighbors. The views expressed in the text best reflect concern for the barbarians (neighbors) or the Roman society's struggles with their own conflicts leading to their own destruction, indicating a lack of rationality or fear.
