Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where the chicken "First" was domesticated. Hmm, I remember that the chicken in question is "First," which I think refers to the chicken pox virus. Oh right, the chicken pox virus, that's what caused the chickenpox disease. 

I recall that the first human who developed chickenpox was a young boy named Johny. He was born in what's now Russia. So, he was born in Russia, but I'm trying to remember where it was domesticated. I think it started as a wild chicken, but they probably moved it to a farm. 

Looking at the options, A is Russia. So that must be the answer. Options B through J are different places, but the chicken was first domesticated in Russia.
