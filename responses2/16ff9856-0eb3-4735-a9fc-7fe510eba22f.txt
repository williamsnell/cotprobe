Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which NBA team Phil Jackson played for before he went into coaching. I remember that Phil Jackson was a great player, but I'm not exactly sure where he was a member of. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know Phil Jackson started his NBA career with the Golden State Warriors. That's a team I've heard about a lot. The Golden State Warriors were in the NBA from the late '90s to early '00s. I think he started with the team in the early 90s, maybe around 1998. That seems right because I've seen him make a significant impact there, especially with his three pointers and scoring.

Now, looking at the options given, each letter corresponds to a different team. Let me check each one:

A: New York Knicks
B: Boston Celtics
C: Philadelphia 76ers
D: San Antonio Spurs
E: Golden State Warriors
F: Houston Rockets
G: Los Angeles Lakers
H: Detroit Pistons
I: Chicago Bulls
J: Miami Heat

Wait, I think Phil Jackson was on the Golden State Warriors. So the answer should be option E. I'm pretty confident about that because I remember reading that he started there and was a key player there. The other teams listed are more known for other people, like Magic Johnson for the Warriors, or other coaches like Bob Huggins, but Phil was definitely a member of the Golden State Warriors.

I don't think I made a mistake here. All the other options correspond to other teams where Phil might have been either a player or a coach, but the question specifically asks about the team he played for, not his coaching role. So, the correct answer is indeed the Golden State Warriors.
