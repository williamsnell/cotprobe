Question:

"Hard" water contains small amounts of the salts calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO_3)_2) and calcium sulfate (CaSO_4, molecular weight = 136 g/mole). These react with soap before it has a chance to lather, which is responsible for its cleansing ability. Ca(HCO_3)_2 is removed by boiling to form insoluble CaCO_3. CaSO_4, is removed by reaction with washing soda (Na_2 CO_3, molecular weight = 106 g/mole) according to the following equation: CaSO_4 + Na_2 CO_3 \rightarrow CaCO_3 + Na_2 SO_4. If the rivers surrounding New York City have a CaSO_4 concentration of 1.8 × 10^-3 g/liter, how much Na_2 CO_3 is required to "soften" (remove CaSO_4) the water consumed by the city in one day (about 6.8 × 10^9 liters)?

Options:

A: 8 tons
B: 35 tons
C: 25 tons
D: 12 tons
E: 50 tons
F: 30 tons
G: 15 tons
H: 20 tons
I: 5 tons
J: 10 tons

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about softening water to remove calcium sulfate (CaSO4) from water sources. The river in New York City has a CaSO4 concentration of 1.8 × 10^-3 g/L. We need to find out how much Na2CO3 is required to soften the water consumed by the city in a day, which is about 6.8 × 10^9 liters.

Hmm, I remember from school that when you have calcium sulfate and you add sodium carbonate, it reacts to produce calcium carbonate, which is insoluble and thus forms a precipitate. The reaction is CaSO4 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + Na2SO4. So each mole of CaSO4 reacts with one mole of Na2CO3.

I think the key here is to find out how much CaSO4 is in the water and then convert that to the required Na2CO3. Since the concentration is given in g/L, I can calculate the total grams of CaSO4 in one day and then find out the moles needed.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total mass of CaSO4 in the water.
2. Determine the moles of CaSO4 present.
3. Find the moles of Na2CO3 needed (same as CaSO4 moles).
4. Convert moles of Na2CO3 to mass.
5. Finally, convert the mass into tons since the answer options are in tons.

Let me go through each step.

First, total mass of CaSO4. The concentration is 1.8e-3 g/L, and the volume is 6.8e9 liters. So mass = concentration × volume.

Mass = 1.8e-3 g/L * 6.8e9 L.

Let me compute that. 1.8e-3 is 0.0018 g/L. So 0.0018 * 6.8e9 = ?

Well, 6.8e9 is 6,800,000,000. Multiply by 0.0018:

0.0018 * 6,800,000,000 = ?

Hmm, 6,800,000,000 * 0.0018. Let's think: 6,800,000,000 * 1.8e-3 = 6,800,000,000 * 0.0018.

Wait, 6,800,000,000 is 6.8e9. So 6.8e9 * 1.8e-3 =?

Multiplying 6.8 *1.8 = 12.24, and the exponents 1e9 * 1e-3 = 1e6. So 12.24e6 grams.

12.24 million grams. Because 1e6 is a million.

Wait, but 12.24e6 grams is 12,240,000 grams. Wait, no: 1e6 is 1,000,000; so 12.24e6 is 12,240,000 grams. Because 12.24 * 1e6 = 12,240,000.

Now, convert grams to kilograms. Because molar masses are in grams per mole. So 12,240,000 grams is 12,240 kg? Wait, no: 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 12,240,000 grams = 12.24e3 kg = 12,240 kg.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. 12,240,000 grams divided by 1000 is 12,240 kg. Yes.

So the total CaSO4 is 12,240 kg. But wait, no: wait, 12,240,000 grams is 12,240 kg? Wait, no: 12,240,000 grams is 12,240 kilograms. Because 1000 grams is 1 kilogram, so 12,240,000 / 1000 = 12,240 kg. Yes.

But let's keep track of units.

Now, the molecular weight of CaSO4 is 136 g/mol. So moles of CaSO4 = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol).

So moles = 12,240,000 g / 136 g/mol.

Let me calculate that. 12,240,000 / 136.

136 goes into 12240000 how many times?

Well, 136 * 90,000 = 12,240,000. Oh wait, because 136 * 9e4 is 136*90,000=12,240,000. So 90,000 moles.

Wait, so 90,000 moles of CaSO4.

But the reaction says 1 mole CaSO4 reacts with 1 mole Na2CO3, so we need 90,000 moles of Na2CO3.

Now, Na2CO3 has a molar mass of 136 g/mol (since it's the same as CaSO4, but the molecular formula is Na2CO3, which is 23*2 +12 +3*16 = 46 +12 +48= 106? Wait, no wait. Wait, Na is 23, O is 16, C is 12. So Na2CO3 is 2*23 +12 +3*16 = 46 +12 +48 = 106 g/mol. Oh yeah, the problem states molecular weight of Na2CO3 is 106 g/mol. So that's correct.

So to find the mass of Na2CO3 needed, multiply moles by molar mass.

So 90,000 moles * 106 g/mol = ?

90,000 * 100 is 9,000,000. 90,000 *6 is 540,000. So total 9,540,000 grams.

Convert grams to tons. Because 1 ton is 1000 kg, and 1 kg is 1000 grams.

So 9,540,000 grams is 9.54e6 grams.

Convert to kg: 9.54e3 kg. Then convert to tons: 9.54e3 kg / 1e3 = 9.54e0 tons? Wait, no: 1 ton is 1000 kg. So 9.54e3 kg is 9.54e0 tons? No. Wait, 9.54e3 kg is 9.54e0 * 1000 kg. So 9.54e3 kg is 9.54e0 tons? Wait, no:

Wait, 1 ton = 1000 kg.

So 9540 kg is 9.54 tons.

Wait, wait, 9,540,000 grams is 9,540 kg. Because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 9,540,000 grams is 9,540 kg.

Convert kg to tons: 9,540 kg / 1000 kg/ton = 9.54 tons.

Wait, but wait, that's 9.54 tons. Let me see the options. The options are in 5,10,15,20,25, etc. So 9.54 is approximately 10 tons. But wait, the options don't have a 10 ton option with a plus, but looking back, the options are:

A:8, B:35, C:25, D:12, E:5, F:30, G:15, H:20, I:5, J:10.

So 9.54 is closest to 10 tons. So the answer would be option J:10 tons.

Wait, but wait—did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me go through again.

Total CaSO4: 1.8e-3 g/L * 6.8e9 L = (1.8 *6.8) * 1e-3 * 1e9.

1.8 *6.8: 1.8 *6 =10.8, 1.8 *0.8=1.44, total 12.24. So 12.24e6 grams? Because 1e-3 *1e9 is 1e6. So 12.24e6 grams.

Convert to kg: 12.24e6 g = 12,240 kg.

Wait, no: 12,240,000 grams is 12,240 kg, because 12,240,000 /1000 =12,240.

So that's correct.

Molar mass of CaSO4 is 136 g/mol. So moles = 12,240 /136 = 90,000 moles. Because 136 * 90,000 = 12,240,000 (12,240 kg is 12,240,000 grams).

Wait, no: 90,000 * 136 = 12,240,000 grams (12,240 kg). So moles correct.

So Na2CO3 needed is 90,000 moles. Moles of Na2CO3 is same as CaSO4. So 90,000 moles.

Molar mass of Na2CO3 is 106 g/mol. So mass needed is 90,000 *106 g.

Calculate that: 90,000 *106 = (9e4) * (1.06e2) )= 94.5e6 grams.

Wait no: 90,000 * 106 is 90,000 *100 =9,000,000; 90,000 *6=540,000 → total 9,540,000 grams.

Convert to tons: 9,540,000 grams = 9,540 kg. 9,540 kg is 9.54 tons.

But the options don't have exactly 9.54. The closest is 10 tons (option J). But wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let me recompute the total CaSO4.

6.8e9 L × 1.8e-3 g/L.

6.8e9 *1.8e-3 = (6.8 *1.8) * (1e9 *1e-3) = 12.24 * 1e6 grams.

12.24e6 grams is 12,240,000 grams.

Yes, that's correct.

Molar mass of CaSO4 is 136 g/mol → moles = 12,240,000 /136 = 90,000 moles. Correct.

Molar mass of Na2CO3 is 106 g/mol → 90,000 *106 =9,540,000 grams. 9,540,000 grams is 9.54e6 grams.

Wait, wait. 9,540,000 grams is 9,540,000 grams. That's 9.54 million grams.

Wait, no, wait: 9,540,000 grams is 9,540,000 / 1000 = 9,540 kg. Wait, no, 9,540,000 grams is 9,540 kg. Because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 9,540,000 grams = 9,540 kg.

Convert kg to tons: 9,540 kg / 1000 = 9.54 tons. So about 9.5 tons, which is closest to 10 tons, option J.

But wait, what about the options given? Let me look again.

Options:

A:8

B:35

C:25

D:12

E:5

F:30

G:15

H:20

I:5

J:10

So J is 10 tons. So the correct answer is J, 10 tons.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion earlier. Let's double-check.

Wait, if 1 ton is 1000 kg, then 10 tons is 10,000 kg. Wait, but in our calculation, the mass is 9,540 kg, which is 9.54 tons. So 9.54 is closer to 10 than to 8 (difference of 1.46), so option J is the correct choice.

To determine how much sodium bicarbonate (Na₂CO₃) is required to soften the water consumed by the city in one day, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the total mass of CaSO₄ in the water:**
   - The concentration of CaSO₄ is 1.8 × 10⁻³ g/L.
   - The volume of water consumed is 6.8 × 10⁹ L.
   - Total mass of CaSO₄ = (1.8 × 10⁻³ g/L) × (6.8 × 10⁹ L) = 12,240,000 g = 12,240 kg.

2. **Convert the mass of CaSO₄ to moles:**
   - The molar mass of CaSO₄ is 136 g/mol.
   - Moles of CaSO₄ = 12,240,000 g / 136 g/mol = 90,000 moles.

3. **Determine the moles of Na₂CO₃ required:**
   - From the reaction equation, 1 mole of CaSO₄ reacts with 1 mole of Na₂CO₃.
   - Moles of Na₂CO₃ = 90,000 moles.

4. **Convert the moles of Na₂CO₃ to mass:**
   - The molar mass of Na₂CO₃ is 106 g/mol.
   - Mass of Na₂CO₃ = 90,000 moles × 106 g/mol = 9,540,000 g = 9,540 kg.

5. **Convert the mass of Na₂CO₃ to tons:**
   - 1 ton = 1000 kg.
   - Mass of Na₂CO₃ in tons = 9,540 kg / 1000 = 9.54 tons.

6. **Compare with the answer options:**
   - The closest option to 9.54 tons is 10 tons, which corresponds to option J.

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
