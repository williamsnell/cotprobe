Question:

A train pulled into a busy station. Some passengers got off the train, and others got on. A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, "All aboard!" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train "Wait for me!" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, "You can make it," and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee. The coffee shop customer suffered an injury to her shoulder as a result of being hit by the container of coffee. If the coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad, which of the following elements of her claim will the plaintiff be unable to satisfy?

Options:

A: Assumption of risk.
B: Proximate or legal causation.
C: Negligence per se.
D: Breach.
E: Cause-in-fact.
F: Duty.
G: Contributory negligence.
H: Foreseeability.
I: Vicarious liability.
J: Comparative negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about a negligence claim in a railway accident. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.

The scenario starts with a train pulling into a busy station. Passengers get off, others get on. A few moments later, a conductor calls "All aboard." Then a man with a cardboard box comes running towards the train towards the open door, just as it starts moving. He hesitates, thinking about giving up or going ahead. A worker helps by giving him a shove. He falls, the box hits him, causing fireworks, which ignite a rocket that crashes into a wall in the shop, causing the customer's shoulder injury.

Now, the question is about a plaintiff (the customer in the shop) asserting a negligence claim against the railroad. Which elements of her claim can she't satisfy?

The options are A through J, each representing a different negligence theory. I need to go through each option to see which elements are satisfied and which aren't.

First, what's the plaintiff's claim? She's suing for injuries, so it's a cause of action under the negligence theory. The possible elements are assumption of risk, proximate or legal causation, per se negligence, breach, cause-in-fact, foreseeability, duty, contributory negligence, foreseenability, comparative negligence, and vicarious liability.

Let me go through each:

A: Assumption of risk. This is about the plaintiff's belief that the railroad was negligent. The worker gave him a shove, but whether he had an assumption of risk here. The worker's action was to assist, but does that constitute an assumption? I think it's more about the belief that the railroad was at fault. If the worker acted with the intent to assist, then maybe the assumption is satisfied. But sometimes, if the worker didn't have a duty to assist or if he acted in a way that created a risk that was not inherently on the railroad, then it might not be satisfied. However, the worker was giving assistance, so perhaps this is satisfied.

B: Proximate or legal causation. This is whether the action (the man falling) was close enough to the injury (shoulder injury) and if it's a cause of the injury. The man was near the door, so it's proximate. But is it a cause? The accident was due to the box falling and the impact. The man was hurt by the box, which is the cause. So yes, this causation is satisfied.

C: Negligence per se. This is when the injury is caused by a defect inherent to the product. The box contains fireworks, which are dangerous. The injury is from the box hitting the ground. But per se negligence requires that the injury is a defect in the product itself. Since the box is dangerous, it's a defect. But wait, the cause is the impact from the falling box. The injury is due to the box's fall, which is a product defect. So per se negligence applies here. That's one element the plaintiff can't satisfy because it's a per se claim.

D: Breach. This is the railroad's liability for the breach. The worker helped the man, which was a breach of duty. So breach is satisfied.

E: Cause-in-fact. This is whether the facts were close enough to the injury and that the injury was a cause of the harm. The man was near the door, so yes. The injury was from being hit by the falling box. So this is satisfied.

F: Duty. The railroad's duty was to ensure a smooth ride, but the question is about negligence. The duty is about what the railroad should have done, but in this case, the railroad's negligence is in causing harm. So duty isn't about the railroad's negligence here. So F is not satisfied.

G: Contributory negligence. This is when the plaintiff's actions were a significant part of the injury. The man was near the door and near the accident. He was in the path of the falling box. He was aware of the danger and maybe had a duty to protect himself. So he contributed, so G is satisfied.

H:Foreseenability. This is whether the plaintiff knew or should have known about the danger. The man was running towards the door, which was moving, and the box was falling. The worker gave a shove. The worker might not know the exact danger, but he was giving assistance. The worker's action of giving a shove might not have been foreseen, but the worker's intent was to help, not to prevent the accident. So foreseeability is about foreseeing the danger. If the worker didn't foresee it, then foreseeability isn't satisfied. Wait, but the man was running towards the door, which was moving, so he was near the door. The worker gave a shove, but the worker's intention was to assist. So whether the worker knew about the danger or not? The worker gave a shove hoping to assist, but the worker might not have known the exact danger, so foreseeability is not satisfied.

I: Vicarious liability. This is if the plaintiff's negligence is vicariously liable. If the worker's action was negligent, then the worker's negligence is vicarious. The worker's actions are negligent, so I is satisfied.

J: Comparative negligence. This is about the plaintiff's fault being comparable to another. But since we're only considering whether the plaintiff can satisfy the elements, and the fact that the worker's action was negligent is sufficient, J isn't directly relevant here.

So which elements can't the plaintiff satisfy? The elements are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

From the options, C is per se negligence, which the plaintiff can't satisfy.

Wait, but I thought per se is a separate issue. The injury is from a product defect, so per se applies. So the plaintiff can't satisfy C.

The other elements, like breach, cause-in-fact, duty, etc., are satisfied. 

So the answer is C: Negligence per se.

The plaintiff is suing for injuries and must determine which elements of her claim can't be satisfied under negligence. The analysis of each element is as follows:

- **A: Assumption of risk**: This requires the plaintiff to have believed the railroad was negligent. While the worker's actions were intended to assist, this is more about the belief of the worker's duty rather than the plaintiff's assumption. Thus, this element is satisfied.

- **B: Proximate or legal causation**: The event (man falling) was proximate to the injury (shoulder injury) and caused it. The box's falling was the cause. This element is satisfied.

- **C: Negligence per se**: The injury is caused by a product defect (box containing fireworks), making this a per se claim. The plaintiff cannot satisfy this element.

- **D: Breach**: The worker's action was a breach of duty. This element is satisfied.

- **E: Cause-in-fact**: The man was near the door, and the injury was a cause of harm. This element is satisfied.

- **F: Duty**: The railroad's duty was to ensure a smooth ride. The duty is not about the railroad's negligence but its inherent duty. This element is not satisfied.

- **G: Contributory negligence**: The man's actions contributed to the injury. This element is satisfied.

- **H: Foreseenability**: The worker gave a shove, but the worker's intention was to assist, not to prevent the accident. foreseeability is not satisfied.

- **I: Vicarious liability**: The worker's negligence is vicariously liable. This element is satisfied.

- **J: Comparative negligence**: This is not relevant to the plaintiff's claim.

The plaintiff cannot satisfy the elements of **C: Negligence per se** and **H: Foreseenability**.
