Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the volume of a solid cut out of a sphere by two parallel planes, each 1 unit away from the center. The sphere has a radius of 2 units. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But this problem isn't about the entire sphere. Instead, it's about the part between two parallel planes. Since both planes are 1 unit from the center, the distance between them would be 2 units. Wait, that can't be right because the sphere's radius is 2, so the planes are each 1 unit from the center. Hmm, actually, the distance from the center to each plane is 1, so the distance between the two planes is 2 units (from one end to the other). But wait, no, because the center is in the middle, so the first plane is at +1, the other at -1, so the distance between them is 2 units. But wait, the sphere's radius is 2, so the planes are each 1 unit from the center, so the total length between the planes is 2 units, and the sphere extends from -2 to +2.

Wait, but the problem says it's a solid cut out by the two planes. So the solid is the part of the sphere between the two planes. So the cross-section would be like a spherical segment.

I think the formula for the volume of a spherical segment (which is the part between two parallel planes) is V = πh²(3r - h)/3, where h is the height of the segment, and r is the radius of the sphere. But wait, let me check. Alternatively, the volume can also be found by integrating the area of circular slices.

Wait, another approach is to think of it as the sphere minus two smaller spherical caps. So if I calculate the volume of the entire sphere and subtract the volumes of the two caps that are outside the region between the planes.

The formula for the volume of a spherical cap is (πh²(3r - h))/3, where h is the height of the cap. In this case, each plane is 1 unit from the center. Let me visualize: the sphere has radius 2. The planes are each 1 unit from the center, so the distance from the center to each plane is 1. So the height of each cap would be the distance from the plane to the top of the sphere. Since the sphere's radius is 2, the topmost point is 2 units from the center. So, the distance from the plane (which is at 1 unit from the center) to the top is 2 - 1 = 1 unit. So each cap has a height of 1 unit.

So each cap's volume is πh²(3r - h)/3. Plugging h=1 and r=2, that's π*(1)^2*(3*2 -1) /3. That's π*(1)*(6-1)/3 = π*(5)/3 = 5π/3. Since there are two caps, the total volume of both is 2*(5π/3) = 10π/3.

Wait, but the sphere's total volume is (4/3)π*(2)^3 = (4/3)π*8 = 32π/3. So if I subtract the two caps (10π/3) from the sphere's volume, that would give me the volume of the solid between the two planes. So 32π/3 -10π/3 = 22π/3. That matches option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, using the spherical segment formula: V = πh²(3r - h)/3. Here, h is the height of the segment. Since the planes are each 1 unit from the center, the height between them is 2 units (from -1 to +1). Wait, wait, no, the height in the formula is the distance between the two planes, which is 2 units. Let me plug h=2 into the formula. So V = π*(2)^2*(3*2 -2)/3 = π*4*(6-2)/3 = π*4*4/3 = 16π/3. Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier result. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing h in the segment formula with the height in the caps. Let me clarify. The formula for a spherical segment (the portion between two parallel planes) has h as the height of the segment. So for a sphere of radius r, if the two planes are at a distance of a and b from the center, the height of the segment is |a - b|. But in this case, the planes are at +1 and -1, so the distance between them is 2 units, so h=2. Using the formula V = πh²(3r - h)/3, that would give h=2, r=2: V= π*(4)*(6-2)/3 = π*4*4/3 = 16π/3. But earlier, when I subtracted the two caps, I got 22π/3. So which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again. The volume between the two planes is the volume of the sphere minus the two caps. Each cap has a height h = 1 (from the plane to the top of the sphere). So the volume of each cap is (πh²(3r - h))/3 = (π*1*(6-1))/3 = 5π/3. So two caps together are 10π/3. Sphere's volume is 32π/3. So subtracting, 32π/3 -10π/3=22π/3. So why the discrepancy with the segment formula?

Ah, wait, perhaps the segment formula uses a different h. Wait, if the two planes are 2 units apart (from -1 to +1), the height of the segment is 2 units, which is correct. But let me plug h=2 into the segment formula. So V = πh²(3r -h)/3 = π*(4)*(6 - 2)/3 = π*4*4/3 = 16π/3. But from the other method, subtracting the caps, I get 22π/3. Wait, that can't be right. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I calculate the spherical segment. Let me check the formula again. The formula for the volume of a spherical segment (the portion between two parallel planes) is indeed V = πh²(3r - h)/3, where h is the height of the segment. So in this case, if the two planes are 2 units apart, h=2. So plugging in, V= π*(2)^2*(3*2 -2)/3 = π*4*(6-2)/3= π*4*4/3=16π/3. But this doesn't match the other approach where I subtracted the two caps of 5π/3 each (total 10π/3). So I must have made a mistake in calculating the cap's volume.

Wait, let me recalculate the cap's volume. The formula for the volume of a spherical cap is V = (πh²(3r - h))/3. For h=1, r=2: (π*(1)^2*(6-1))/3=5π/3. So two caps: 5π/3 * 2 =10π/3. Sphere's volume is 32π/3. So 32π/3 -10π/3=22π/3. This suggests the correct answer is 22π/3, which is option A.

Wait, so why the discrepancy with the segment formula? Perhaps I'm using the wrong h in the segment formula. Let me think again. The segment formula uses h as the distance between the two planes. So if the planes are 2 units apart, h=2. So using that, V= πh²(3r -h)/3= π*(4)*(6-2)/3= π*4*4/3=16π/3. But this contradicts the subtraction approach, which gives 22π/3. So I must have made a mistake in the segment formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, no, the formula for a spherical cap is correct, and the segment formula is correct. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the two caps are not each 1 unit in height. Let me think: the sphere has radius 2. The planes are at +1 and -1. So the top of the sphere is at 2. The distance from the plane at +1 to the top is 2 -1=1, same as the distance from the plane at -1 to the bottom. So each cap has a height of 1. So the volume of each cap is (πh²(3r -h))/3 with h=1, so 5π/3. So two caps: 10π/3. Sphere's volume is 32π/3. So 32π/3 -10π/3=22π/3. That seems correct.

So the correct answer is 22π/3, option A.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think if I can visualize this. The spherical segment is the part between x= -1 and x= +1. So the height of the segment is 2 units. So using the segment formula, V= πh²(3r -h)/3. So h=2, r=2. Plugging in: V= π*(4)*(6-2)/3= π*4*4/3=16π/3. But that's less than the result from subtracting the caps. So something's wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, I think I found the error. The formula for the spherical segment is actually when the height h is the distance from the base to the top of the segment. So in this case, the segment is between x=-1 and x=+1, which is a height of 2. But the formula might be h as the distance from the base to the top, which is 2, but perhaps r is the radius of the sphere, which is 2. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different when you have a spherical cap. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the segment formula is for when the height is from the base (plane) to the top of the sphere. So in this case, the height h is 2 (from x=-1 to x=+1). So V= πh²(3r -h)/3 = π*(2)^2*(6-2)/3 = π*4*4/3=16π/3. But this contradicts the subtraction approach, which gives 22π/3. So I must have made a mistake in the segment formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, no, the formula for a spherical segment (the part between two parallel planes) is actually correct. So perhaps the mistake is in how I'm calculating the caps. Let me see: each cap's height is 1 unit. So the volume of each cap is (πh²(3r -h))/3. So h=1, r=2: (π*(1)^2*(6-1))/3=5π/3. So two caps: 10π/3. Sphere volume is 32π/3. So 32π/3 -10π/3=22π/3. That seems correct, as I subtracted the two caps from the sphere. So why does the segment formula give a different result?

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using for the segment is incorrect. Let me check another source. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the segment and the cap.

Wait, another approach: the volume of the solid between two planes can be found by integrating the area of circular slices. The sphere is centered at the origin. The equation is x² + y² + z² = 2² =4. The planes are at x=1 and x=-1. So the region between x=-1 and x=1 is the solid. The volume can be found by integrating from x=-1 to x=1, the area of each circular slice.

The radius of each slice at position x is r(x) = sqrt(4 - x²). So the area A(x) = π*(4 - x²). The volume is the integral from x=-1 to x=1 of A(x) dx.

So compute ∫ from -1 to 1 of π(4 - x²) dx.

Let me compute that: ∫π(4 -x²)dx from -1 to 1. The integral of 4 is 4x, the integral of x² is (x³)/3. So evaluating from -1 to 1:

At x=1: 4*1 - (1)^3/3 = 4 - 1/3 = 11/3
At x=-1: 4*(-1) - (-1)^3/3 = -4 - (-1/3) = -4 + 1/3 = -11/3

Subtracting: 11/3 - (-11/3) = 22/3. Multiply by π: (22/3)π.

So the volume is 22π/3, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A:22π/3.

The problem involves finding the volume of a solid cut out of a sphere of radius 2 by two parallel planes, each 1 unit from the center. The sphere's equation is \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4\), and the planes are at \(x = -1\) and \(x = 1\). The volume between the planes can be calculated by integrating the area of circular slices along the x-axis.

1. **Setting up the integral**:  
   The radius of a slice at position \(x\) is \(\sqrt{4 - x^2}\), so the area of each slice is \(A(x) = \pi(4 - x^2)\).  
   The volume is the integral from \(x = -1\) to \(x = 1\):  
   \[
   V = \int_{-1}^{1} \pi(4 - x^2) \, dx
   \]

2. **Evaluating the integral**:  
   - The integral of \(4\) is \(4x\).  
   - The integral of \(x^2\) is \(\frac{x^3}{3}\).  
   - Evaluated from \(-1\) to \(1\):  
     \[
     \left[4x - \frac{x^3}{3}\right]_{-1}^{1} = \left(4(1) - \frac{1^3}{3}\right) - \left(4(-1) - \frac{(-1)^3}{3}\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \left(4 - \frac{1}{3}\right) - \left(-4 + \frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{11}{3} - \left(-\frac{11}{3}\right) = \frac{22}{3}
     \]
   - Multiply by \(\pi\):  
     \[
     V = \frac{22}{3}\pi
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The volume of the solid is \(\frac{22}{3}\pi\), which corresponds to option A.
