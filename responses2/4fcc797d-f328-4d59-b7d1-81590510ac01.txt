Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this attachment question. Let me take it step by step. 

The scenario is a mother and her infant are alone in a room. A stranger comes in, the mother leaves, and she comes back. When she comes back, the infant starts crying and keeps crying even after being picked up. Eventually, the infant returns to playing happily with the toys. 

Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that there are different types of attachment styles. Let's list them out to remind myself. There's the secure, preferential, unconditioned, and unconditioned disorganized styles. There are also some others like secure-expressive, avoidant, and so on.

Wait, the infant is crying and then settles down, returning happily. That sounds like she's becoming more secure. When the mother leaves, she goes back, which usually means the infant is trying to establish new secure attachment. But here, the infant is crying initially and then calms down. That makes me think the mother's presence is stabilizing the infant's behavior.

I think the secure style is when the infant is able to establish a secure attachment. They often show signs of preferential attachment, where they want the relationship to go in a certain way. They might cry if the mother leaves, but once the mother returns, the infant's crying stops. Or maybe the crying is a result of the mother's presence.

Wait, but in this case, the infant starts crying and then calms down. That's different. So maybe the infant is expressing fear or anxiety? Or is it the mother's presence that's causing her to cry, but then she stops and the infant doesn't cry anymore?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about each option.

Option D is "Ambivalent." That means the infant likes the relationship but is neither entirely positive nor negative. But in this scenario, the infant is clearly crying, which might indicate distress. So ambiguous might not fit.

Option J is "Secure." That would mean the infant is able to establish a secure attachment. They often show signs of preferential attachment and may cry when the relationship is broken. But in this case, the crying only starts after the mother returns. So the infant might not be establishing a secure attachment yet; perhaps they prefer the relationship but have some anxiety.

Option F is "Fearful avoidant." That's when the child is anxious and avoids the situation, but the mother's return might be a positive reinforcement. But the infant is crying, so maybe it's not avoidant.

Option A is "Anxious avoidant." Similar to fearful avoidant, but more about avoiding situations. The crying might not fit.

Option E is "Dependent." That's when the child is dependent on the parent, often showing signs of fear or anxiety. The crying suggests distress, so dependent might not be it.

Option I is "Anxious resistant." That's when the child is anxious and doesn't show signs of relief. The crying might be a result of the anxiety, but the scenario says the crying stops after the mother returns. So perhaps the mother's presence is calming the infant, which might make the infant feel secure.

Wait, the mother leaves, the infant starts crying, but then the mother comes back and the crying stops. So the mother's presence, maybe through the stranger, is helping the infant. That sounds like the infant is becoming secure, which would align with the secure attachment style (option G).

Alternatively, if the infant was feeling anxious and then the mother's presence reduces it, that could be a scenario for the anxious resistant (I), but in this case, the crying stops, which might indicate the mother's presence is sufficient to calm the infant, reducing anxiety.

Another point: in the secure style, the infant is able to form a secure attachment. They often show signs of preferential attachment and may cry when the relationship is broken. But once the relationship is broken, the crying stops. That seems to fit the scenario. So in this case, the mother's return is a form of re-establishment, which is secure.

So the answer should be G: Secure.

The scenario describes an infant who becomes more secure after the mother returns, with the mother's presence calming the infant and reducing crying, which fits the secure attachment style. The secure style involves the infant establishing a stable attachment, often showing signs of preferential attachment and reduced crying upon relationship disruption.

Answer: G
