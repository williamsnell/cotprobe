Okay, so I have this question about the range of a trigonometric function. The function is y = 5 + 3 * sin(pi – x). Hmm, I remember that the sine function has a range of between -1 and 1. But wait, there's this transformation here: 3 multiplied by the sine term. So, the amplitude would be 3, right? That means the sine part will vary between -3 and 3.

But then there's also that plus 5 outside. So, that would shift the entire sine wave up by 5 units. Let me think: if the sine term is between -3 and 3, adding 5 would make it go from 5-3=2 to 5+3=8. So the range should be from 2 to 8. Looking at the options, option C is 2 ≤ y ≤ 8. That must be the answer. Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think about the phase shift. The argument is (pi – x), which can be rewritten as -(x - pi), which is a reflection over the y-axis. But the range shouldn't change because it's just a phase shift. So yes, the range remains determined by the amplitude and the vertical shift.

The function is y = 5 + 3 sin(pi – x). The sine function has a range of [-1, 1], so multiplying by 3 scales it to [-3, 3]. Adding 5 shifts the entire function up by 5 units, resulting in a range of [2, 8]. 

Answer: C
