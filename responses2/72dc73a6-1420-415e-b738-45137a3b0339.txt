Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about Bulimia Nervosa treatment options. Let me start by recalling what I know about Bulimia Nervosa.

Bulimia Nervosa is a mental health condition that affects someone's ability to eat. It causes them to binge on food, which makes them nervous and can lead to a lot of stress. The main symptoms are mood swings, eating disorders, and sometimes physical changes like weight loss or regain of appetite.

Now, the question asks what's correct regarding treatment. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: It is not useful to discuss weight with patients. I'm not sure about this. From what I remember, the approach often focuses more on the psychological aspects rather than just weight. So maybe A is incorrect because discussing weight isn't the main focus.

Option B: Treatment should focus solely on physical symptoms. That doesn't sound right. I think more than just physical symptoms; there's a lot more to it. They might also need to address the psychological effects, like how eating affects mood.

Option C: Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics. Oh wait, that rings a bell. I believe that's correct. Treatment often involves avoiding food, eating slowly, and giving the patient time to process their feelings. So this would be a primary approach.

Option D: Use of antipsychotic medication is first-line treatment. Hmm, antipsychotics are used for depression, right? Bulimia is more about mood and eating disorders, not necessarily depression. I'm not sure if antipsychotic is the first-line treatment. Maybe it's not correct.

Option E: The first approach is to discuss body image. I don't think that's the main approach. Body image is another area, but the main focus is on the behavioral and psychological aspects, not just looking good.

Option F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit. Fluoxetine is an antipsychotic used for depression, not necessarily for Bulimia. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Treatment should prioritize on patients' social relationships. I don't think that's part of the treatment. Focus is more on the behavioral aspects.

Option H: Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices. That's a bit vague. I remember that purging is part of the treatment, but it's not exclusive. They might also use other strategies.

Option I: The main treatment approach is diet control. Wait, diet control is a behavioral approach, not medication. But I'm not entirely sure if it's the main approach or just part of it.

Option J: Treatment should ignore the psychological aspects of the disorder. That doesn't make sense because Bulimia Nervosa is all about mental health issues, so treatment should address that as well.

So, going back to the options, C seems correct because the primary focus is on food avoidance and psychological strategies. The other options either don't mention the psychological aspects, focus on body image, or use incorrect medications.

The correct answer is C: Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics.
