Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about retributive practices, and I'm a bit new to this topic, so I need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking which kind of retributivism Nathanson supports. The options are A through J, each representing a different legal principle. I remember from my studies that retributive justice deals with the responsibility of the plaintiff to the defendant, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

First, I should probably list out what each option means. 

A: Proportional — I think this is about proportionality. Like, the punishment should be proportional to the harm done. So, if the defendant did something wrong that's three times worse than another offense, the retribution should be three times more severe.

B: Equality — This sounds like a principle that focuses on equality between the plaintiff and defendant, especially in criminal cases. Like, maybe the same punishment for a similar offense.

C: Retalational — I'm not sure. Retaliation is when the defendant recovers the plaintiff's damages. Like, the defendant gets paid for the pain or suffering the plaintiff endured.

D: Punitive — This is about severe punishment for a crime. So, the defendant gets a harsher sentence because of the harm they've caused.

E: Compensatory — This is about giving the plaintiff money to compensate for their loss. So, if the defendant did something wrong, the plaintiff gets some form of financial relief.

F: Absolute — This term seems odd. I think it means unlimited or no exception. So, the retribution would be the maximum possible, maybe even beyond the harm caused.

G: Restorative — Restorative justice deals with the issue of retribution and deals with how it's done. It's about the process, not the principle itself. So, Nathanson might support restorative because he's concerned about how the retribution is handled.

H: Corrective — This sounds like a different approach. Corrective justice is more about repairing the harm, so like, helping the plaintiff recover legally, not just giving money.

I: Preventive — Preventive justice is more about preventing future harm. Like, taking steps to prevent similar crimes in the future. So, Nathanson might support this as well.

J: Consequential — This would mean the punishment is based on the consequences rather than the harm itself. So, the punishment is determined by the long-term effects, not the immediate harm.

Now, the question is about which Nathanson supports. I'm not entirely sure, but I think Nathanson is a proponent of restorative justice. I remember that in some legal systems, the court doesn't impose punishment unless there's no other option, which is restorative.

Looking at the options, G is restorative, which seems to fit. So, Nathanson would support G.

The correct answer is G: restorative. Nathanson supports restorative justice, which deals with the process of retribution rather than the principle itself. Therefore, the answer is G.

Answer: G
