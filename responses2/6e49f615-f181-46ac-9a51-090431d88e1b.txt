Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the number of grains of sulfuric acid in a certain volume and concentration of solution. Hmm, grains... wait, I think grains are a unit of mass, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh right, I remember that a grain is about 64.79 milligrams, but I should check if that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes grains are used as a unit in pharmaceuticals. Anyway, the problem gives me the molarity of the sulfuric acid solution and its molecular weight, so I can approach this using molarity and the formula related to grams.

The problem states: How many grains of sulfuric acid are contained in 3.00 liters of 0.500 N solution? The molecular weight (molar mass) of H2SO4 is 98.1 g/mol.

So, the plan is to find out how many moles of H2SO4 are in 3 liters of 0.500 N solution, then convert moles to grams, and then convert grams to grains.

Wait, what's N here? Oh, N stands for normality. Oh right, normality is a unit of concentration that's used for solutions where the solution is acidic (like HCl, H2SO4) because each molecule or formula unit can donate a certain number of equivalents. For H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid, each molecule donates 2 equivalents of H+ ions. So, the normality (N) is the same as the molarity (M) multiplied by the number of equivalents per formula unit. So, if the solution is 0.500 N, that's 0.500 M multiplied by 2 equivalents per H2SO4 molecule.

Wait, wait. Oh, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. Normality (N) is defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solution. For a diprotic acid like sulfuric acid, each molecule can supply two equivalents. So, if the solution is 0.500 N, that means 0.500 equivalents per liter. So, the molarity (M) is N divided by the number of equivalents per mole. So, Molarity = Normality / equivalents per mole. So here, Molarity = 0.500 N / 2 = 0.250 M.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using normality where each molecule contributes one equivalent, regardless of how many H+ it can donate. No, that can't be right. Oh, wait, no: for sulfuric acid, each molecule can donate two H+ ions (since it's diprotic). So, the normality is equal to 2 * molarity. So, if the solution is 0.500 N, the molarity is 0.500 / 2 = 0.250 M.

Hmm, but perhaps I should double-check this. Let's think: For HCl, which is a strong acid and fully dissociates, the normality is equal to the molarity. For example, 1 M HCl is 1 N. But for H2SO4, which is diprotic, each molecule donates 2 H+ ions. So, yes, the normality would be twice the molarity. So, if the solution is N = 0.500, then Molarity = N / 2 = 0.250 M.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the number of equivalents. The formula for normality is N = (moles of H+ ions) / liters. For sulfuric acid, since each mole yields 2 moles of H+ (because it's diprotic), the normality is 2*Molarity. So, if N is 0.500, then Molarity is 0.250 M.

Now, next step: calculate the moles in 3 liters of 0.250 M H2SO4. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So, 0.250 mol/L * 3.00 L = 0.750 mol.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me recheck that. Molarity is moles per liter. So, 0.250 M * 3.00 L = 0.750 moles. Yes, that's correct.

Now, to find the mass of H2SO4 in grams. The molecular weight (MW) is given as 98.1 g/mol. So, mass = moles * MW. So, 0.750 mol * 98.1 g/mol = 73.575 grams. Let me compute that: 0.75 * 98.1. Let's do 0.75 *98.1. 0.75 * 100 is 75, but since it's 98.1, which is 100 -1.9, so let's compute 0.75 *98.1.

98.1 *0.75 = (90 *0.75) + (8.1 *0.75) = 67.5 + 6.075 = 73.575 g. So, that's 73.575 grams.

But wait, the question asks for grains, not grams. So, I need to convert grams to grains. Oh, grains are a unit of mass. From what I remember, 1 grain is about 64.798 milligrams. Alternatively, perhaps a more precise value is 64.79891 milligrams per grain.

So, to convert grams to grains, we can use the conversion factor: 1 grain = 64.798 mg. So, 1 gram = 1000 mg, so 1 gram = 1000 / 64.798 ≈ 15.432 grains. Because 64.798 *15.432 ≈ 1000. Let me compute that: 64.798 *15 = 971.97, 64.798 * 0.432≈ 28.05. So 971.97 +28.05 ≈ 999.999, so approximately 15.432 grains per gram.

So, 73.575 grams * 15.432 grains/gram. Let's compute that.

73.575 * 15.432.

Hmm, let's compute:

73.575 * 15 = 1103.625
73.575 * 0.432 = let's compute 73.575 * 0.4 = 29.43, 73.575 *0.032 ≈ 2.354, so total 29.43+2.354≈31.784.

So 1103.625 +31.784 = 1135.409 grains.

Wait, but that's higher than any of the given options. Did I make a mistake in the conversion?

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different conversion factor. Let me double-check. Oh, wait! 1 grain is approximately 64.798 grams. No, wait, wait. No, that's grams to grains. No: Wait, 1 grain is about 64.798 milligrams, which is 0.064798 grams. So, 1 grain = 0.064798 grams. So, to get grams per grain, it's 1/0.064798 ≈15.4323 grains per gram. Hence, 73.575 grams * 15.4323 grains/gram ≈73.575 *15.4323.

Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 73.575 * 15.4323.

I can break it down:

73.575 * 15 = 1103.625

73.575 * 0.4323 =?

Compute 73.575 *0.4 = 29.43

73.575 *0.0323 ≈ 2.365 (because 73.575 *0.03=2.20725; 73.575 *0.0023=0.1692225; sum 2.20725 +0.1692225=2.3764725)

So 0.4323 gives 29.43 +2.3764725 = 31.8064725.

So total 1103.625 +31.8064725 = 1135.4314725 grains.

But looking at the options, the highest is option J:55.3 g. Wait, that's way lower than my calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the molarity calculation.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps.

Step 1: Normality is 0.500 N. For H2SO4, each molecule contributes two H+ ions. So, N = 2 * Molarity. So, Molarity = N /2 = 0.500 /2 = 0.250 M. That's correct.

Step 2: Volume is 3.00 liters. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.250 * 3.00 = 0.750 moles. Correct.

Step 3: Mass = moles * MW. 0.750 mol *98.1 g/mol =73.575 grams. Correct.

Wait, but the options don't include 73.5 grains (which would be 73.5 grains, which is about 73.5 *15.432 ≈ 1135 grains, which isn't listed). So perhaps I have a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of grains in the solution, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of H2SO4 molecules, but that would be in Avogadro's number terms, which is not the case here.

Wait, wait, another approach. Let's think about using the formula directly. Number of moles is 0.750 moles. Mass = moles * MW =0.750 *98.1 =73.575 grams. Now, converting grams to grains: 73.575 grams * (1 grain /0.064798 grams)=73.575 /0.064798 grains.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 grain =0.064798 grams. So, grams to grains is division by 0.064798. So, 73.575 /0.064798 = approximately 73.575 /0.064798 ≈ 1135.4 grains. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but looking at the options, I'm seeing options like 73.5 g (option G), 49 g (option I), etc. Perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, perhaps the question is not asking for grains but for the equivalent weight or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, where the number of H2SO4 molecules is being considered, but no, that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is 0.500 mol/L instead of normality. That would change things. Wait, no, the problem states it's 0.500 N. So, that's the normality, which is 0.500 N.

Wait, perhaps the question is in grams and wants it in milligrams, but no, the options are in grams.

Alternatively, perhaps the molarity is 0.250 M, leading to 0.750 moles, but perhaps the calculation of grains was wrong.

Wait, another approach: let's compute 0.750 grams of H2SO4.

Wait, 0.750 grams is how many grains? 0.750 grams * (1 grain / 0.064798 grams) ≈ 11.35 grains. But that's way lower than the options, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the initial step of converting normality to molarity was wrong. Let me check that again.

Normality N = 2 * Molarity (for H2SO4, which is diprotic). So, for N=0.500 N, Molarity is 0.500 /2 =0.250 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the number of moles in terms of another unit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong molar mass. Wait, the molecular weight of H2SO4 is 98.1 g/mol. Correct. So, 0.750 moles *98.1 g/mol =73.575 grams. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different unit for grains. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 102.5 g

B:24.5 g

C:88.2 g

D:196.2 g

E:29.4 g

F:147 g

G:98.1 g

H:73.5 g

I:49 g

J:55.3 g

So, option H is 73.5 g. Which is exactly the grams we calculated. So, wouldn't the answer be option H?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, what if the problem is not converting grams to grains, but to another unit, like mg? No, the options are grams. So, 73.575 grams is option H.

But earlier I thought the answer should be about 73.575 grams, but that's option H. But let's check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate the number of moles correctly.

Molarity = N/2 = 0.500 /2 =0.250 M.

Moles in 3.00 L: 0.250 M *3.00 L =0.750 mol.

Mass: 0.750 *98.1 =73.575 grams. So, that's 73.575 g, which is option H.

But wait, looking at the options again, option H is 73.5 g, which matches exactly. So why is option J 55.3 g, which is lower than 73.5? Did I make a mistake in the initial approach?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula without considering the normality correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of moles, but the options don't reflect that.

Wait, perhaps I got the normality formula wrong. Let me think again. Normality is equal to the number of equivalents per liter. For H2SO4, each molecule donates two equivalents. So, N= 2* Molarity. So, Molarity= N/2. Correct.

But wait, perhaps the problem states the solution is 0.500 N, but that's the normality. So, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, another approach: if I calculate the number of moles as 0.750, and the mass is 73.575 grams, which is option H. So, the correct answer should be H. But looking back at the options, option H is 73.5 g and option J is 55.3 g. I think my calculation is correct, so maybe the correct answer is option H.

But wait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of moles or grams. Let me recheck:

Molarity = 0.500 N / 2 = 0.250 M.

Volume = 3.00 L.

Moles = 0.250 *3 = 0.750 mol.

Mass = 0.750 * 98.1 = 73.575 g. So, 73.575 g is option H.

But I notice that option H is 73.5 g, so that matches. So why are options like option I (49 g) present? Maybe I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong molecular weight. Wait, the molecular weight is 98.1. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is in the normality formula. For example, if the solution was 0.500 M instead of N.

Wait, let me try that.

Molarity would be 0.500 M.

Moles =0.500 *3 =1.5 mol.

Mass = 1.5 *98.1=147.15 g.

But that's option F, which is 147 g. Not matching my initial approach.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, like using grams instead of moles. But no, the problem asks for the number of grains of sulfuric acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is giving the concentration in a different unit. For instance, perhaps the solution is 0.500 grams of H2SO4 per liter. But that would change the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the answer is the same as grams, but only if the molar mass is 1. But that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, no, option H is 73.5 g. So, if my calculation leads to 73.575 grams, which rounds to 73.6, which would be option H. So, perhaps the correct answer is option H.

But wait, looking at the initial problem, the molarity is 0.500 N, which I've used correctly. So, unless I have a mistake in the calculation, the correct answer should be option H.

But wait, the options don't have 73.5. In the options, option H is 73.5 g. So, the correct answer is H.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about the number of moles, which would be 0.750 mol. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of moles in 3.00 liters of 0.500 N solution. The option which is 0.750 mol is not present, but the grams are 73.575, which is option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 98.1 g. Which is the molar mass. So, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is G. But that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of moles. Let me recalculate:

Molarity = 0.500 N / 2 =0.250 M.

Moles in 3.00 L: 0.250 *3.00=0.750 mol.

Mass: 0.750 *98.1=73.575 grams.

So, the correct answer is 73.575 grams, which is option H.

Thus, the correct answer is H.

The problem involves calculating the number of grains of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in a 3.00 L solution with a normality (N) of 0.500 N. Here's the analysis:

1. **Convert Normality to Molarity**:  
   For sulfuric acid, each molecule donates 2 equivalents. Thus,  
   \[
   \text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Normality}}{2} = \frac{0.500}{2} = 0.250 \, \text{M}.
   \]

2. **Calculate Moles of H₂SO₄**:  
   Using the molarity and volume:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.250 \, \text{mol/L} \times 3.00 \, \text{L} = 0.750 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Mass of H₂SO₄**:  
   Using the molar mass (MW = 98.1 g/mol):  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{MW} = 0.750 \, \text{mol} \times 98.1 \, \text{g/mol} = 73.575 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Convert Grams to Grains**:  
   1 grain = 64.798 milligrams = 0.064798 grams. Thus,  
   \[
   \text{Grains} = \frac{\text{Mass in grams}}{0.064798} = \frac{73.575}{0.064798} \approx 1135.4 \, \text{grains}.
   \]

5. **Match with Options**:  
   The calculated mass is 73.575 grams, which corresponds to **option H**. 

Thus, the correct answer is **H: 73.5 g**.
