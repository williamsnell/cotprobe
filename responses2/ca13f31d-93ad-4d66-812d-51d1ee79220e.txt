Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again. It says that X1 and X2 are independent Poisson random variables with means λ1=2 and λ2=3. I need to find P(X1=3, X2=5). 

The hint mentions that the event can occur if and only if either {X1=1, X2=0} or {X1=0, X2=1}. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. Because if X1 is 3 and X2 is 5, then 3+5 is 8, but the hint says that the event is when either X1 is 1 and X2 is 0, or the other way around. That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the hint. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps the hint is incorrect. No, wait, no, the way the hint is written is confusing. Oh, wait, no—no, the way it's written is that the event {X1=3, X2=5} can only happen if either X1=1 and X2=0, or X1=0 and X2=1. But that can't be right because 1+0=1 and 0+1=1, which are different from 3 and 5. So that must be a mistake in the hint. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, no—no, the way the hint is written is: "Note that this event can occur if and only if {X1=1, X2=0} or {X1=0, X2=1}." But that can't be right because {X1=3, X2=5} implies X1+X2=8, but the only possibilities in the hint are when X1+X2=1. That seems contradictory. So perhaps the hint is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the event {X1=3, X2=5} can only happen if X1 is 1 and X2 is 0, or X1 is 0 and X2 is 1. But that's not true because 3 and 5 are their own numbers, not 1 and 0. So perhaps the hint is wrong, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm reading the problem wrong. Let me recheck. Oh wait, the problem is about finding P(X1=3, X2=5), which is the joint probability mass function of X1 and X2. Since they are independent, I can compute P(X1=3) * P(X2=5). But wait, the hint says to consider the cases where X1=1 and X2=0, or vice versa. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because 3 and 5 are not 1 and 0. So maybe the hint is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the probability of X1=3 and X2=5, but the hint is suggesting that this can only happen if X1=1 and X2=0 or X1=0 and X2=1. But that's not correct because 3 and 5 are different from 1 and 0. So maybe the hint is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct way is to compute P(X1=3, X2=5) directly, but let's proceed.

Wait, regardless, maybe I should compute P(X1=3) and P(X2=5) separately and then multiply them. Because X1 and X2 are independent.

So for Poisson distributions, the PMF is P(X=k) = (λ^k e^{-λ}) / k! 

So for X1=3, λ1=2, P(X1=3) = (2^3 e^{-2}) / 3! = (8 e^{-2}) / 6.

Similarly, for X2=5, λ2=3, P(X2=5) = (3^5 e^{-3}) / 5! = (243 e^{-3}) / 120.

Then, the joint probability is P(X1=3) * P(X2=5). Let me compute that.

But wait, looking at the options, let's compute it.

First, calculate P(X1=3):

2^3 = 8
3! = 6
So 8/(6) = 4/3 ≈ 1.3333
Wait, but that can't be, because Poisson probabilities are between 0 and 1. Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait no, let me calculate it properly.

P(X1=3) = (2^3 e^{-2}) / 3! = (8 e^{-2}) / 6 ≈ (8 * 0.1353) /6 ≈ (1.0824)/6 ≈ 0.1804. Wait, that's about 0.1804.

Wait, but that can't be right because e^{-2} is approximately 0.1353, so 8 * 0.1353 is about 1.0824, divided by 6 is 0.1804.

Similarly, P(X2=5) = (3^5 e^{-3}) /5! = 243 * e^{-3} / 120.

e^{-3} is approximately 0.0498. So 243 * 0.0498 ≈ 12.1114. Divided by 120: ≈ 0.1009.

So the joint probability would be 0.1804 * 0.1009 ≈ 0.0182.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.0182.

But wait, the options are given, and the choices are from A to J. So let me think again. Wait, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the Poisson probabilities more accurately.

For X1=3, λ=2:

P = (2^3 e^{-2}) / 6.

2^3 is 8. e^{-2} is about 0.135335.

So 8 * 0.135335 ≈ 1.08268.

Divide by 6: 1.08268 /6 ≈ 0.18044.

For X2=5, λ=3:

3^5 is 243.

e^{-3} is about 0.049787.

So 243 * 0.049787 ≈ let's compute:

243 * 0.05 is 12.15, but since it's 0.049787, which is about 0.05 minus a little. 243 * 0.000213 ≈ about 0.0518, so total is 12.15 + 0.0518 ≈ 12.2018.

Divide by 120: 12.2018 / 120 ≈ 0.10168.

So P(X1=3) ≈0.1804, P(X2=5)≈0.10168. Multiply: 0.1804 * 0.10168 ≈ 0.01834.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.0182. So that's very close. But wait, the options don't have E as 0.0182? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.0137

B: 0.0084

C: 0.0157

D: 0.0168

E: 0.0182

F: 0.0245

G: 0.0101

H: 0.0213

I: 0.0125

J: 0.0226

So option E is 0.0182, which matches the calculation. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a moment. The initial hint says the event can occur if and only if {X1=1, X2=0} or {X1=0, X2=1}, which doesn't make sense because 3 and 5 are not 1 and 0. So perhaps the hint is incorrect, but regardless, the correct approach is to compute the joint probability as P(X1=3) * P(X2=5).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Hmm, but the problem is to find P(X1=3, X2=5), which is straightforward. So the correct answer is option E, 0.0182.

To find \( P(X_1=3, X_2=5) \), we use the fact that \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent Poisson random variables with means \( \lambda_1=2 \) and \( \lambda_2=3 \), respectively. The joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:

1. Calculate \( P(X_1=3) \):
   \[
   P(X_1=3) = \frac{2^3 e^{-2}}{3!} = \frac{8 e^{-2}}{6} \approx 0.1804
   \]

2. Calculate \( P(X_2=5) \):
   \[
   P(X_2=5) = \frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} = \frac{243 e^{-3}}{120} \approx 0.1017
   \]

3. Multiply the probabilities:
   \[
   P(X_1=3, X_2=5) \approx 0.1804 \times 0.1017 \approx 0.0182
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is **E: 0.0182**.
