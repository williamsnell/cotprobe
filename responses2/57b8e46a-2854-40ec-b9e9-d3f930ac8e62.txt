Okay, so I need to figure out how many faces a convex 3D object has given that it has 15 vertices and 39 edges. Hmm, I remember something about convex polyhedrons and their properties. Oh right, there's Euler's formula that relates the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) of a convex polyhedron. 

Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2. Yeah, that's it. So I can plug in the values I have and solve for F. Let me see, V is 15, E is 39. So substituting in, it would be 15 - 39 + F = 2. Let me compute that step by step. 

15 minus 39 is -24. So the equation becomes -24 + F = 2. To find F, I'll add 24 to both sides. That gives F = 2 + 24, which is 26. So the number of faces should be 26. Let me double-check my calculations. 15 minus 39 is indeed -24. Adding 24 gives 26, yes. That makes sense because other polyhedrons like cubes have 6 faces, but here it's a different shape. 

Looking at the options, option B is 26. So the correct answer should be B. I don't think I made any mistakes in applying Euler's formula here. It seems straightforward once you remember the formula.

The number of faces is calculated using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2. Substituting V=15 and E=39 gives F=26.

Answer: B: 26
