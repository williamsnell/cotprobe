Okay, so I have this question about the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and another statement about the Penn Treebank. I'm a bit fuzzy on my linguistics, but I'll try to think through it.

Statement 1 says that the Stanford Sentiment Treebank contains movie reviews, not book reviews. Hmm. I remember that the Stanford Treebank is a standard dataset for sentiment analysis. I think it includes a variety of text, including news articles, reviews of books, movies, and other media. So if that's the case, Statement 1 should be true. But wait, some sources might say it doesn't include books, but I think the original Stanford sentiment treebank does include books. Let me think again... Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should double-check. I think the original version did include books. So Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2 says that the Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling. Oh right, the Penn Treebank is a well-known dataset specifically for language modeling. It's been widely used in research and industry for tasks like parsing and language modeling. So Statement 2 is definitely true.

Looking at the options, the first part is whether each statement is true or not. So both statements are true. But wait, let me make sure about Statement 1. I think the Stanford sentiment treebank does include books. So yes, Statement 1 is True. Statement 2 is also True.

So the answer should be both statements true. Looking at the options:

A: True, True â†’ That's what I think.

Wait, but the options are given as A to J, each with two letters. So the correct answer is A: True, True. But wait, another thought: I'm not 100% sure about the Stanford sentiment treebank. Do they include books or just articles and such? Because sometimes I think the original version is for books, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the original version (like the one before the development versions) did include books. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the statement is incorrect because perhaps it's not including books.

Wait, another angle: some sources say the original Stanford sentiment treebank (1999) included books and other documents. So Statement 1 is accurate. So both are true. So the answer must be A.

The correct answer is A: True, True.

Answer:
     A: True, True
