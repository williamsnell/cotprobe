Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a perfectly competitive employer hiring labor. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question is asking where the employer hires labor up to. The options are from A to J. I remember that in perfectly competitive markets, the employer is a price taker, meaning they can't influence the price of the product. 

So, the key here is to think about the conditions for hiring labor. I remember that the firm hires up to the point where the marginal factor cost (MFC) equals the marginal revenue product (MRP). Wait, but what's MFC? Oh right, MFC is the cost of the last unit of labor, which is the wage rate because each worker's wage is their cost. So MFC is just the wage rate.

And MRP is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker. Since the firm is perfectly competitive, the price (P) is the same as the marginal revenue (MR). So MRP equals P times the marginal product of labor (MP). But wait, in the case of a perfectly competitive market, the price (P) is the same across all workers, so MRP = P * MP. But in the long run, the price is fixed, so MR is equal to P. So MRP is P * MP, but since P is constant, MRP is just the additional revenue from the last worker.

Wait, but the question is asking when the employer hires labor up to a point. So the condition is that the wage equals the marginal revenue product. Or wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Because for the firm, the point is MRP equals MFC. But MFC is equal to the wage rate in the long run because all factors are variable. So the condition is MRP = wage. Because MFC is the cost of the last worker, which is the wage.

Alternatively, since each worker adds a certain amount of output, and the firm's revenue from each additional worker is P*(MP), which is MRP, the condition for hiring up to the point where MRP equals the wage rate. Wait, but for a perfectly competitive firm, price is fixed. So MRP = P * MP. So the condition would be that the wage equals the MRP. Because MFC is the wage, and MRP is P*MP. So if the firm is making P=MR, then MRP is P*MP, so MFC (wage) must be equal to MRP for the firm to hire the next worker. So the condition is that the wage equals the marginal revenue product.

Looking at the options, option F is "Wage = Marginal Revenue Product of labor." Or wait, another way: in the long run, the firm hires until MRP equals the wage. So the condition is that the wage equals the MRP.

Alternatively, in the short run, the MFC is the wage rate (since all factors are variable only in the short run). So the condition is MFC equals MRP. So the condition is that the wage (MFC) equals MRP.

So, the correct condition is that the wage equals the marginal revenue product of labor, which is option F.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in perfect competition, the MRP is equal to the MR, which is P. So MRP = P*(MP). So if the price is fixed, the MRP depends on the MP. But the condition is that the wage (MRFC) equals MRP. So the correct condition is that the wage equals MRP.

So the answer should be F: wage = marginal revenue product of labor.
</think>

In a perfectly competitive market, a firm hires labor up to the point where the wage rate equals the marginal revenue product (MRP). This is because the firm maximizes profit by hiring workers until the additional revenue generated by the last worker (MRP) equals the additional cost of hiring that worker (the wage rate). Since price is constant in perfect competition (MR = P), the condition simplifies to the wage rate (MFC) equaling the MRP.

**Answer:** F: Wage = Marginal Revenue Product of labor.
