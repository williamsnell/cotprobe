Question:

A housing corporation owned a tract of land and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the property. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations' and restrictions recited in the Declaration of Covenants. One of the restrictions reads:"There shall never at any time be erected, permitted, or maintained upon any part of the property any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors. "The Declaration of Covenants was duly recorded and was included in the deed taken by a psychologist when he purchased lot 24 in the housing development. The psychologist recorded his deed. The psychologist gave his lot to his son. The deed conveying lot 24 to the son contained no reference to the Declaration of Covenants or any of its provisions. The deed provided that "these premises are conveyed to (the son), his heirs, and assigns, as long as they are used for residential purposes only. " The son did not record his deed. The son was unaware of the Declaration of Covenants. The son started a home business selling imported wine from his home. A geologist, the owner of lot 26, which was situated next to the son's lot, brought an action of ejectment against the son. Which of the following is the best argument for the son?

Options:

A: Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.
B: The son's business does not qualify as a saloon or place for manufacture of liquors.
C: The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.
D: The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist, but not the geologist, the right to sue the son.
E: The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.
F: The son was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants, thus should not be held accountable.
G: The psychologist did not explicitly forbid the sale of alcohol in the deed to the son.
H: The geologist has no right to sue as the son's business does not affect him directly.
I: The prohibition in the Declaration of Covenants does not apply as the son did not purchase the lot.

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, we've got a housing corporation that's selling lots and has a Declaration of Covenants. One of the covenants prohibits the sale of alcohol, specifically for a place sold as a saloon, or for selling or manufacturing spirituous or vinous liquors. The owner of lot 24 is the psychologist, and his son took it. The psychologist recorded his deed, but the son didn't. The son sold his lot and brought an action against his father, claiming he's liable.

So the question is, what's the best argument for the son? Let's break down the legal aspects here. 

First, the main points are: 

1. The son didn't record his deed. 
2. The Declaration of Covenants (DC) was recorded, but the son didn't know about it.
3. The DC prohibits sales of certain liquors.
4. The son's deed conveys the land to his son without any reference to the DC.
5. The son's business is wine imported from home, which is a different category of alcohol. So, the DC specifically prohibits spirituous or vinous, not imported wine.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not recorded, condition can't be enforced. But recording is important. The statute of frauds requires recording to be enforceable. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Son's business doesn't qualify. The DC prohibits spirituous or vinous, and wine is spirituous, so B is correct. So the son's business is within the DC's prohibition. 

Option C: Law prohibits a fee simple determinable. Hmm. The DC is a covenant, not a statute. The fee simple determinable is a form of conveyance. But the DC is a covenant that affects the son's ability to use the land. The son's deed doesn't include the DC, so the son is free to use the land for his business. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: The deed created a fee simple determinable with possibility of reverter. No, the DC is a covenant, not a statute. The son's deed, if it's a fee simple, would mean he can use the land for as long as he wants, but the DC's prohibition would affect his operations. The DC's effect would be a covenant, not a fee. So D is not correct.

Option E: Son's business doesn't affect the geologist. But if the DC affects the son's business, that's separate from the geologist's business. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Son wasn't aware of the DC. That's true, but the DC is a covenant, not a statute. The son didn't know about it because he didn't record his deed. But the son's deed didn't include the DC, so the DC's prohibition doesn't apply. So F is correct, but the issue is whether the DC's prohibition applies to the son's business.

Option G: The DC doesn't apply because the son didn't record. But the DC is an administrative covenant, not a statute. Recording is separate. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The son's business doesn't affect the geologist. The DC affects the son, not the geologist. So H is not correct.

Option I: DC doesn't apply because son didn't purchase. But the DC is about the sale, not the purchase. So I is incorrect.

So the best argument is B (the son's business doesn't qualify because the DC prohibits spirituous liquors, which includes wine).

The best argument for the son is that his business involves spirituous or vinous liquors, which are prohibited under the Declaration of Covenants. 

**Answer: B**
