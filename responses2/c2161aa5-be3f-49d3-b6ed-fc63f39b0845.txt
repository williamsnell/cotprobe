A: 310 Kelvin
B: 315 Kelvin
C: 320 Kelvin
D: 277 Kelvin
E: 284 Kelvin
F: 298 Kelvin
G: 290 Kelvin
H: 273 Kelvin
I: 305 Kelvin
J: 265 Kelvin

Alright, so I need to figure out the equivalent temperature in Kelvin when the ambient temperature is 77째F. Hmm, okay, I remember that converting Fahrenheit to Celsius first and then to Kelvin is the way to go. Let me think through the steps.

Wait, no, actually, converting Fahrenheit directly to Kelvin is another approach. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the formula is K = (F - 32) * 5/9 + 273. Let me make sure I get this right. So, 77째F minus 32 is... let's calculate that: 77 minus 32 is 45. Then multiply by 5/9. Let's see, 45 * 5 is 225, divided by 9 is 25. Then add 273. So 25 plus 273 is 298 Kelvin. 

Wait, so the result is 298 K. Let me check the options. Option F is 298 Kelvin. So the correct answer should be F. I think that's it.

To convert 77째F to Kelvin, use the formula: 

\[ K = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} + 273 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ K = (77 - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} + 273 = 45 \times \frac{5}{9} + 273 = 25 + 273 = 298 \]

The equivalent temperature is 298 K. 

Answer: F
