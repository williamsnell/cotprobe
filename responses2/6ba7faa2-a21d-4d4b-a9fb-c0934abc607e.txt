Okay, so I've got this question about perfectly competitive firms in the short run. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let's try to think this through.

First, what do I remember about perfectly competitive markets? Well, in a perfectly competitive market, there are many firms and many buyers, right? All the firms produce identical products. So each firm is a price taker, meaning they can't influence the market price. The price is determined by the market as a whole.

Now, the question is about the short run. So, in the short run, some inputs might be fixed, like capital, while others can be variable, like labor. Firms can choose to shut down if the price isn't high enough to cover their variable costs.

I remember that in the short run, a firm will produce where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. Since the price is determined by the market, that means MR equals the market price. So, the firm will produce up to the point where MC equals the price. If the price is above the average variable cost (AVC), that's a good sign because the firm can cover its variable costs and some of its fixed costs. But if the price is below AVC, the firm might shut down to minimize losses.

Wait, but what about average total cost (ATC)? ATC is the average cost of producing, including both fixed and variable costs. So, if price is above ATC, the firm is making economic profits. If price is below ATC, they're incurring losses that they can't even cover by not producing at all. So they might shut down.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Always operate at a loss. That's not right. Firms can sometimes make positive profits if price is above ATC.

Option B: Profits not affected by average total cost. That's not correct. Profit depends on whether price is above or below ATC.

Option C: Earnings normal. Normal profit is when the firm's total revenue covers all costs, including both fixed and variable. So, that's correct only when price equals ATC. But some firms can make profits, others can't. So option C says they earn normal profit always, which isn't true.

Option D: shuts down if price below ATC. Wait, shut down is when price is below average variable cost (AVC). So if price is below AVC, the firm might shut down. Because if price is less than AVC, the firm can't even cover its variable costs. So, if price is below ATC, which is always above AVC (since AVC is always below ATC, right?), then the firm would shut down. So option D says if price falls below ATC, shut down. Wait, that's not correct. Because if price is below ATC but above AVC, the firm should shut down. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Always shut down on price drop. No, because if price is above ATC but below AVC, they might not shut down. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Earnings positive. That's not always true. Some firms can make positive profits, but others might shut down and not earn any. So F is not always correct.

Option G: May earn positive, negative, or normal. That sounds right. Because if price is above ATC, they make positive. If price is equal to ATC, they make normal profit. If price is below ATC, they make a loss. So G is correct.

Option H: Always negative. No, because some firms can make positive profits. So H is wrong.

Option I: Always negative. No, same reason as H. So I is wrong.

Option J: Profits don't depend on market conditions. No, because profits are directly related to price and costs. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer is G: The firm may earn positive, negative, or normal profits.

The correct answer is **G: The firm may earn positive, negative, or normal profits.**

In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers and must decide whether to shut down or continue production based on whether the market price covers their variable costs (AVC). If the price is above ATC (average total cost), the firm makes positive economic profits. If the price equals ATC, it makes normal profits. If the price is below ATC, the firm incurs losses that it cannot cover, leading to shutdown. Therefore, the firm can earn positive, negative, or normal profits depending on the market conditions.

**Answer: G**
