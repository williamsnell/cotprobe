Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question. The question is about the impact on assets and liabilities when Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a company pays out salaries, it's a cash outflow. So, the company is using its cash to pay these expenses. That would affect the cash account, right? Because when you spend money, your cash decreases. But how does that affect assets and liabilities?

Let me think about the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So, if the company has cash (an asset) and it uses cash to pay salaries, that's reducing the cash asset. So, assets should decrease. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the only impact.

Wait, when a company pays salaries, it's a transaction that involves the expense (cost of goods sold or similar) and the cash. So, salaries expense is an expense account, which is a liability because it's an obligation to pay in the future. So, paying salaries would reduce the salary expense, not increase it. Because expense is an expense, not an asset or liability.

So, when they pay $300,000 in salaries, the main impact is on the cash. Because the company is using its cash to pay the salaries. So, cash decreases by $300,000. 

But wait, what about the accounting equation? If cash (an asset) is decreased, and the expense (liability) is not affected, does that mean the assets are decreased and equity (which is what's on the right side) is decreased as well? Let me think. 

The transaction would be a decrease in cash (an asset) and a decrease in salary expense (liability). But how does that affect equity? Wait, the equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So, if cash (an asset) decreases and salary expense (liability) decreases, that would mean that equity must increase because the total assets must equal the total liabilities plus equity.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. If the company pays out $300k in salaries, it's a cash outflow. So, the cash account decreases by $300k. That reduces assets by $300k. 

But salaries expense is an expense account, which affects the income statement. It's not an asset or liability. So, the expense is an expense, which reduces the net income, which in turn affects equity.

Wait, so let me make it clear. When the company pays salaries, it's an expense. 

So, the transaction would be:

- Debit Salary Expense (which is an expense account, so it's a liability for the company)
- Credit Cash (which is an asset)

So, both the expense is a liability and the cash is an asset.

So, how does this affect the accounting equation?

Before the transaction: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

After the transaction:
- Cash (an asset) decreases by $300k. So assets = Li + Equity - $300k.
- Salary Expense (liability) decreases by $300k. So Li = Li - $300k.

So, substituting into the equation:
Assets = (Li - 300k) + Equity - 300k
Which can be rewritten as:
Assets = Li - 600k + Equity
But wait, that seems a bit off. Let me try another approach.

The transaction is a decrease in cash (asset) and an increase in salary expense (liability). But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you pay salaries, you're using cash to pay an expense. So, the cash decreases, and the expense is recognized as a liability. 

So, in terms of the accounting equation, the total assets decrease by $300k, and the total liabilities decrease by $300k as well? Because the expense is a liability. No, wait. The expense is a liability because it's an obligation to pay in the future. So, the expense is a liability, which is a part of the equation. 

But wait, how does this impact the overall equation? Let's see:

The transaction is a decrease in cash (an asset) and an increase in salary expense (liability). So, both assets and liabilities have changed, but how?

Wait, no. The expense is a liability, but the cash is an asset. So, the net effect is that the company's assets have decreased by $300k (cash decreased), and the expense account (liability) has decreased by $300k? No, that doesn't make sense because the expense is a liability, but the company is paying it now.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transaction as a decrease in cash and an increase in salary expense as an expense, but that doesn't change the liability. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me approach this differently. When a company pays salaries, the effect is:

- Cash decreases (asset decreases by $300k)
- Salary Expense increases (expense increases by $300k, which is a liability)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you pay salaries, you're reducing your liability (because you have an obligation to pay it). So, the salary expense is a liability account that increases. 

Wait, no, the expense is a liability because it's an obligation. So, the company's liabilities increase by $300k because they have to pay this amount in the future.

Wait, so the salary expense is a cost recognized on the income statement. So, when you record the expense, it's an increase in the expense (liability) because you're incurring a cost now, which is a liability.

So, the transaction would be:

Debit Salary Expense (liability increases by $300k)
Debit Cash (asset decreases by $300k)
Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you pay salaries, you have to debit the expense and credit cash. Wait, no, that's incorrect. The transaction is that the company has a liability for the salaries they're paying, so they credit their liability account. At the same time, they're using their cash, so they debit the cash account.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let's think of it as:

The company has a liability for the salaries they're paying. So, when they pay salaries, they pay an expense, which increases their liability. Because the company will have to pay this amount in the future. So, the transaction is:

Debit Salary Expense (liability increases by $300k)
Debit Cash (asset decreases by $300k)
Wait, no, because paying salaries is a cash outflow. So, the correct entry is:

Debit Salary Expense (liability increases by $300k)
Debit Cash? No, because it's not a cash outflow. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the correct accounting entry is:

Debit Salary Expense (liability increases by $300k)
Debit Cash? No, because you're not paying cash. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. 

Wait, when a company pays salaries, they're using their actual cash. So, the transaction is:

- Debit Salary Expense (which increases the expense, a liability)
- Debit Cash (which decreases the asset)

But that doesn't make sense because it's not a cash outflow. Oh wait, no. If you have a liability for paying salaries, that's an expense, so you have to record the expense, which increases the liability. So, the transaction is:

- Debit Salary Expense (liability increases by $300k)
- Credit Cash (asset decreases by $300k)

Wait, but that would mean the company has a decrease in asset (since they're using cash), and an increase in liability (because they have to pay this amount in the future). 

So, the impact is:

- Assets decrease by $300k (cash decreases)
- Liabilities increase by $300k (Salary Expense increases, which is a liability)

Wait, but the options probably don't have that. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Looking for an option where assets decrease by $300k, and liabilities increase by $300k.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J says:

J: Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000.

That's not correct because cash is decreased.

Option A: Assets up, liabilities down. No, because we're paying cash, so assets should decrease.

Option B: Expense decreases, cash increases. That's not correct because the expense is an expense, so it's an increase in liability.

Option C: Assets up, cash down. No, cash is down.

Option D: Expense decreases, liability up. No, expense is an expense, so it's an increase in liability.

Option E: Assets down, liabilities up. Hmm, but I thought the cash is down, so the assets would be down.

Wait, no, let me see. When a company pays salaries, the cash decreases (asset decreases). They also have an increase in the liability (because the salary is an expense that will be paid in the future). So, assets decrease by $300k, and liabilities increase by $300k.

Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option A says assets up, liabilities down. That's the opposite of what's happening.

Option J says salary expense is increased, cash is increased. That can't be right.

Wait, wait, let me reevaluate. The salary expense is an expense, so when a company pays salaries, they're increasing their expenses, which is a liability. So, the salary expense increases by $300k, so the liability increases by $300k. 

So, the overall effect is:

- Assets: decrease by $300k (cash used up)
- Liabilities: increase by $300k (because the expense is a liability)

Looking at the options, which one says that? Let me check:

Option J says: Salary expense increased, cash increased. That's not right.

Option A: Assets up, Liabilities down. Wrong.

Option G: Salary expense increased, assets down. No.

Option I: Salary expense increased, cash decreased. No.

Option J: Salary expense increased, cash increased. No.

Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Oh! Wait a second. I'm getting confused. Because when a company pays salaries, the cash is a source of cash, so it decreases.

Wait, the correct answer must be that the company's assets decrease (cash goes down) and their liabilities increase (because the salary expense is a liability). So, the impact is:

- Assets: decrease by $300k
- Liabilities: increase by $300k

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Assets up, Liabilities down → No.

Option J: Salary expense increased, cash increased. → No.

Wait, but none of the options seem to exactly match. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about how the transaction affects assets and liabilities, not the accounting equation. Let me think again.

When Corporation X pays $300,000 in salaries, the relevant accounts affected are:

1. Cash (an asset) decreases by $300,000.

2. Salary Expense (liability) increases by $300,000.

So, the assets decrease by $300k, and the liabilities (because salary expense is increased) increase by $300k.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that states that. Let me check all the options again.

Options:

A: Assets up, Liabilities down → Incorrect.

B: Salary expense down, cash up → Incorrect (it's a cash outflow, so cash down).

C: Assets up, cash down → No.

D: Expense down, Liabilities up → Incorrect.

E: Assets down, Liabilities up → No, because cash is down.

F: Expense up, Liabilities down → No.

G: Expense up, assets down → No.

H: Expense down, cash down → No.

I: Expense up, cash down → No.

J: Expense up, cash up → No.

Wait, none of the options seem to match. But that can't be right because the options must have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks for the impact on assets and liabilities. So, when the company pays salaries, the cash (an asset) decreases, so assets are decreased. The salary expense is a cost that is recognized as an expense, which is a liability. So, the liability increases by $300k.

So, the correct impact is: assets decrease by $300k, and liabilities increase by $300k.

But looking at the options:

Wait, the options are A to J, and I think I need to re-examine each one.

Let me read each option again:

Option A: Assets up, liabilities down. No.

Option B: Salary expense down, cash up. No, because it's a cash outflow, so cash goes down.

Option C: Assets up, cash down. No.

Option D: Salary expense down, liabilities up. No, because expense is an expense, so it's an increase in liability.

Option E: Assets down, liabilities up. Yes! Because the company's assets decrease (cash used up), and the expense is a liability. So, the net effect is that assets decrease and liabilities increase.

Wait, but why is that? Because the expense is a liability. So, the actual change is that the expense increases (liability increases) and the asset decreases.

So, the correct impact is: assets decrease by $300k, and liabilities increase by $300k.

But the only option that says that is option E: "Assets are decreased by $300,000; liabilities are increased by $300,000."

Wait, no. Because option E says:

E: Assets are decreased by $300,000; liabilities are increased by $300,000.

But that would mean that the company's assets reduced by $300k, and their liabilities increased by $300k. But in reality, the company's paid cash, so assets have decreased, and the salary expense (liability) has increased. So, yes, that's correct.

But wait, let's see the answer options again.

Looking again at the options, option E says:

E: Assets are decreased by $300,000; liabilities are increased by $300,000.

Wait, option E says that the company's assets are decreased, and its liabilities are increased. That's correct because paying salaries reduces cash (an asset) and increases the liability (salary expense).

So, the correct answer should be option E. But wait, let me recheck the options.

Wait, the options are written as:

E: Assets are decreased by $300,000; liabilities are increased by $300,000.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, the salary expense is an expense, so it's an increase in the liability. So, the impact is: assets decrease, and liability increases.

Wait, but the correct accounting entry is that the salary expense is an expense (liability increases) and the cash is a decrease. So, the correct option would be E.

Wait, but earlier I thought option J was correct, but that's wrong because J says salary expense is increased, and cash is increased, which isn't right.

Wait, no, option J is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The correct answer is that the company's assets decrease because they've paid out cash, and their liabilities increase because the salary expense is a liability.

So, the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but looking back, option J says:

J: Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000.

That's not correct because cash is a source of cash, so it should decrease.

So, the correct answer is option E.
</think>

When Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries, the transaction affects the accounting equation as follows:

1. **Cash (an asset)** decreases by $300,000 because the company has paid out cash.
2. **Salary Expense (a liability)** increases by $300,000 because the company has incurred an obligation to pay this amount in the future.

Thus, the impact is:

- **Assets** decrease by $300,000.
- **Liabilities** increase by $300,000.

Now, reviewing the options:

- **Option E** states: "Assets are decreased by $300,000; liabilities are increased by $300,000." This matches the correct impact.

ANSWER: E
