Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about enforceability of offers for widgets. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking which option is not enforceable if the seller changes his mind before accepting the offer. So, I need to remember the principles of contract law related to offers and their enforceability.

First, I think about what each option says. The key here is that the seller might change his mind before accepting the offer, which would affect enforceability. I recall that some promissory statements are enforceable even if the offerer changes mind, but others aren't.

Option A: The seller emails offering $35,000 with the offer open for ten days. I remember that emails are considered offers, and they can be enforced even if the seller changes mind. So A is enforceable.

Option B: The seller sends a written offer without a time frame. I think written offers are enforceable unless they violate some rules. But wait, the order of events matters. If the seller changes his mind and doesn't accept, then the offer would be unenforceable because the offerer changed the mind. So B might be the answer because the seller could change his mind, making the offer unenforceable.

Option C: Similar to A but telephonic. I believe the same logic applies. Teleoffers are considered offers, and even if the seller changes mind, it's enforceable. So C is okay.

Option D: The seller tells the buyer she will sell for $35k and the offer is irrevocable for ten days. Wait, if the seller says it's irrevocable, does that make the offer enforceable regardless of the seller changing his mind? Or does the irrevocability come into play when the seller changes mind? Hmm, I think the irrevocable part doesn't affect the enforceability if the seller changes. So D seems enforceable.

Option E: Verbal offer over the phone. Same as A, B, C, D. So E is enforceable.

Option F: Faxes offer. Similar to emails or telephonic. So F is okay.

Option G: Seller writes an offer stating the offer is irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $2.00. But buyer didn't pay. Does that affect enforceability? I think that part is about the offer's terms. If the offerer can't enforce because they changed their mind and didn't accept, then the offer is unenforceable. Because the offerer changed mind, so the contract is void. So the offer is not enforceable. That would make G the answer.

Wait, but what about Option H: The seller writes the offer and says it's irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $1.00. Buyer pays. So the offerer can enforce it. So H is enforceable, so not the answer.

Option I: The seller writes the offer without any conditions. So I think that's a written offer, which is enforceable. So I is okay.

So the question is which one isn't enforceable if the seller changes his mind. So the one where the seller's condition is based on payment or an irrevocable period but the seller can change mind.

Looking back, G says the offer is irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $2.00. But if the buyer doesn't pay, then the seller can't enforce the condition because the seller didn't accept. So the offerer's condition isn't met because the buyer didn't pay. So the condition (irrevocable period) is based on payment, which was a condition the seller didn't accept. Therefore, the seller can't enforce the offer because they can't meet the condition. So G is not enforceable.

Wait, but wait. The offer is by the seller. If the seller can't meet the condition (buyer didn't pay), then the offer is void. So G's offer is not enforceable because the seller can't meet the condition.

So the correct answer should be G.

The question asks which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes his mind before accepting. Let's analyze each option:

- **A**: An email offering ten days is enforceable even if the seller changes mind.
- **B**: A written offer without a time frame may not be enforceable if the seller changes mind, as they can't meet the offeror's requirements.
- **C**: A telephonic offer with a ten-day timeout is enforceable if the seller changes mind.
- **D**: An irrevocable offer is enforceable unless the seller changes mind, regardless of its terms.
- **E**: A verbal offer over the phone is enforceable if the seller changes mind.
- **F**: A fax offer is enforceable if the seller changes mind.
- **G**: An irrevocable offer with a condition on payment is not enforceable if the buyer doesn't pay, preventing the seller from meeting the condition.
- **H**: An irrevocable offer with a payment condition is enforceable as the buyer paid.
- **I**: A written offer is enforceable.

The offer that is not enforceable is **G**, as the seller cannot meet the condition (no payment) to enforce the irrevocable period. 

**ANSWER: G**
