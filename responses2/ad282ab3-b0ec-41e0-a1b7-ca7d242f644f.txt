Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the characteristics of arteries. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, let's recall what I know about arteries. I remember that arteries are part of the blood vessels that transport blood away from the heart. They carry oxygenated blood, right? So that's something to note.

Looking at the options, option A says they carry blood towards the heart. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if they're away from the heart, they shouldn't be going towards it. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says they always carry deoxygenated blood. Hmm, no, that's not right either. I think some arteries carry deoxygenated blood, but others carry oxygenated. So B is incorrect because it's always wrong.

Option C: They carry blood away from the heart. That sounds correct. Because the heart controls which blood is taken in and which is left in the arteries. So C is probably the right answer.

Option D: They contain valves that prevent backflow. No, I don't think that's true. I remember that in some cases, like the aorta, there are heart valves that prevent blood from flowing backward. But the body doesn't have valves in all arteries. So D is not always correct.

Option E: They always carry oxygenated blood. That's partially correct, but not always. So E would be incorrect because it's not the only time they carry oxygenated blood.

Option F: Lumen is large compared to veins. No, I think the lumen (the main part) of arteries is actually smaller than veins. Veins have a larger lumen. So F is incorrect.

Option G: They exchange gases and nutrients. Yes, definitely. Arteria carries oxygenated blood that gets oxygenated, and it carries nutrients to cells. So G is correct.

Option H: They form a network of small vessels called capillaries. No, that's the network in veins. Arteries don't form capillaries; they pass through them. So H is incorrect.

Option I: They're thin-walled. No, I think thin-walled capillaries are in veins, and arteries are thicker because they have more blood to carry. So I is incorrect.

Option J: They have no muscle. No, I know that many arteries have a thin layer of smooth muscle. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let's go back and make sure. The question is which is the correct characteristic.

So looking at the options, C and G are correct. But wait, the question is a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer. Let me read the options again.

The question is, which is correct as a characteristic. So both C and G are correct statements.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question probably expects only one correct answer. So let me think again.

Looking at the options, what's the correct characteristic.

Option C: They carry blood away from the heart. That's definitely true because the heart's main function is to pump blood away.

Option D: They contain valves that prevent backflow. No, because while some have heart valves, the majority don't. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C, but wait, let me check other options.

Wait, perhaps in the case of some arteries, like the aorta, they have heart valves. But the question isn't about all of them, just which is a correct characteristic.

So among the options, C and G seem correct. But looking back, the question is asking for the correct characteristic, so perhaps both are correct but which is the best answer.

Wait, the options are A to J, each as a choice. The question is, which is correct.

Looking back:

Option G says they carry gases and nutrients. That's correct because that's a function of arteries. So G is correct.

But looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the question is which is correct.

Wait, maybe the question is looking for the most accurate description. So the correct characteristics are both C and G.

Wait, let me re-examine the options:

The question is "Which of the following is the correct characteristic of arteries?"

So the correct answer is the correct statement.

Between C and G, both are correct. But since the question is about which is correct, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question may have only one correct option. Let me check all the options.

Wait, the question says 'which of the following is the correct' — so only one is correct.

Looking back, the options are:

A: carry towards heart — wrong.

B: always carry deoxygenated — wrong.

C: carry away — correct.

D: contain valves preventing backflow — wrong.

E: always carry oxygenated — wrong because sometimes not.

F: large lumen compared to veins — wrong.

G: carry gases and nutrients — correct.

H: form capillaries — wrong.

I: thin-walled — wrong.

J: no muscle — wrong.

So both C and G are correct characteristics. But the question is a single-choice question, and the options are labeled A to J.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which of the following is the correct", implying only one is correct. So perhaps the answer intended is C.

Wait, but looking again, in the options, which is correct. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The question is about the correct characteristic of arteries. So all the options are statements about arteries' characteristics.

So for example, option G says "they carry gases and nutrients." That's correct because that's a function of arteries. So G is correct.

Similarly, option C is correct.

Wait, but the options C and G are both correct statements. But in the question, only one can be correct.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because that's a correct statement about the function of arteries.

Alternatively, the correct answer might be both C and G. But in the options, only one is correct as per the question.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the basics.

Arteries: They are the largest blood vessels in the body, carrying oxygenated blood away from the heart to meet capillaries. They are thin-walled, and they exchange gases with the body's cells, as well as delivering nutrients to tissues.

So, correct statements would be C (they carry away) and G (they carry gases and nutrients).

Wait, but what about the options provided? The question is phrased as "Which of the following is the correct characteristic of arteries?" So perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but in reality, both are correct.

But in the multiple-choice format, each option is a separate statement, and only one will be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that best describes a correct characteristic. So both C and G are correct, but the question is whether any of the options is the correct one.

Wait, but the question is, "Which of the following is the correct characteristic of arteries?" So perhaps more than one is correct, but the question expects only one. But in reality, both C and G are correct.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me double-check each option.

Option G: "They carry gases and nutrients." That's correct because they exchange oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases, and they deliver nutrients to cells.

Option C: "They carry blood away from the heart." Correct.

So both are correct.

But the question is which is correct. So the correct answers are C and G. But the options are presented as separate choices, but the question is a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the question is giving which is correct. So both C and G are correct, but perhaps the question expects only one.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: is G a correct statement? Or is G incorrect because not all arteries carry that? No, because the majority do. So G is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but the options are set to have only one. But the question is presented as a multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, maybe in the options, only one is correct, so I need to pick between C and G.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing knowledge that all arteries carry oxygenated blood, but that's not true. So the correct answer would have to be C because it's always correct.

So perhaps option G is a correct statement, but option C is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option's correctness.

Option A: Carrying towards the heart. Incorrect.

Option B: Always deoxygenated. Incorrect.

Option C: Away from heart. Correct.

Option D: Backflow prevention. Incorrect.

Option E: Oxygenated. Incorrect.

Option F: Large lumen. Incorrect.

Option G: Carry gases and nutrients. Correct.

Option H: Capillaries. Incorrect.

Option I: Thin. Incorrect.

Option J: No muscle. Incorrect.

So both C and G are correct. But the question is which is correct. It's a single-answer question, so perhaps both are correct, but only one is presented as an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit more nuanced. Let me think again about the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing about the function of the artery. So option G is a correct function, so it's correct.

Wait, but the question is, "Which is the correct characteristic of arteries?" So both C and G are correct, but the options may have only one correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see what the options are again.

The correct answer is C and G. But the question is, which is correct. So the correct options are C and G. But the question only allows one correct answer. So maybe the correct answer is both, but in the context of the options, perhaps only one is correct. Or perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating G.

Wait, another angle: Does every artery carry both gases and nutrients? Well, I think yes. So G is correct.

Wait, perhaps option G is a correct statement, but option C is correct as well. But I'm not sure whether the question expects multiple correct answers, but in this case, it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the one that's the most correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing which of the following is a correct statement about the characteristics of an artery.

So, since both C and G are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because it's a correct statement, but I'm a bit confused because G is also correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing which option is correct regarding their functions. So both C and G are correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should go with the initial assessment: both C and G are correct, but in the options, only one is correct, so perhaps only one is to be selected.

Wait, but looking at the question again, the options are presented as separate statements. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but in reality, the question expects only one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a fundamental characteristic.

Alternatively, maybe G is the correct answer. Because the question is about a correct characteristic, not a function. So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the definitions.

An artery transports blood away from the heart. It carries oxygenated blood, and it carries gases and nutrients. So both C and G are correct.

But the question is which is the correct characteristic. So if both are correct, then they would both be correct answers. But the options are single-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial understanding. Let me recall: what's the function of an artery. An artery carries oxygenated blood away from the heart, and it also carries the necessary gases and nutrients to the cells and stores them.

So both C and G are correct. But if the question is about a characteristic, perhaps the correct answer is both, but since the options are single, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering function, and G is a consequence of that function. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing knowledge that 'they carry gases and nutrients' as a characteristic. So I think G is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and G. But according to the problem's options, it's a single choice. So maybe the intended answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that is correct. So, let's re-express the options:

The correct answer is C and G. But in the options, perhaps only C is correct, and G is a correct function. But the question is, which is correct, so both are correct statements.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I'll proceed to select option C and G, but in the multiple-choice setup, only one option can be chosen.

Wait, perhaps I should go with the initial assessment: both C and G are correct, but in the question, only one is correct, so perhaps only C is correct. I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and G. But given the options, I'll proceed to choose C because it's a clear correct statement about the function.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because option G is also correct, but perhaps the question is about a function. But the question is about a characteristic, which is a general property.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing which statement is correct regarding the function. So both C and G are correct, but the question is a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but the key is that option C is correct because it's a fundamental characteristic of arteries. So my final answer would be C.
</think>

Arteries are the largest blood vessels in the body, responsible for carrying oxygenated blood away from the heart to meet the needs of capillaries. They have several key characteristics, including:

1. **Carry blood away from the heart (Option C):** This is a fundamental and correct description of how arteries function.

2. **Carry gases and nutrients (Option G):** Arteries are responsible for delivering oxygenated blood and the necessary nutrients to cells, which is a critical function of the vessel system.

However, the question is asking for the **correct characteristic** of arteries, and both **C** and **G** are correct statements. Since the question is presented as a single-choice format, the most accurate and fundamental characteristic is **C**, as it directly describes the primary role of arteries.

ANSWER: C
