Okay, so I have this question about comparative advantage and opportunity cost. Let me try to think through this. 

I remember that comparative advantage is a concept from economics, particularly in international trade. It's about how countries can produce goods more efficiently compared to others. The basic idea is that each country should specialize in what it's good at producing because that's where it's more efficient. 

The question is asking how comparative advantage relates to opportunity cost. I think opportunity cost is the cost of choosing one alternative over another. For example, if a country can choose between producing apples or oranges, the opportunity cost of producing apples is the foregone production of oranges, and vice versa.

Comparative advantage comes into play when each country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another. So, if Country A has a lower opportunity cost for apples than Country B, A should produce more apples. That makes sense because by focusing on their strengths, they can gain more overall.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says comparative advantage is when a country can produce a good with a lower opportunity cost than another. That sounds exactly like what I just thought. So A seems correct.

Option B: Talks about having more resources. No, that's not the principle. Comparative advantage isn't about having more resources, it's about what you can produce relative to others.

Option C: Says a country produces more goods. That's not about opportunity cost. It's more about the quantity, not the cost.

Option D: Says a country produces goods faster. Again, that's about speed, not opportunity cost or advantage.

So the correct answer must be option A.
