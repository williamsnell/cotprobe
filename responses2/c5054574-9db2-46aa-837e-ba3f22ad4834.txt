Okay, so I've got this question about lifting a load using wire rope. I'm a bit rusty on my construction stuff, but I'll try to figure this out. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about whether a specific rope and drum size are suitable for lifting a 7.5 ton load from a depth of 760 feet. The suggested rope is a 6 × 19 IPS rope with a diameter of 1.5 inches, and the drum is 96 inches in diameter.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the numbers. Let's break it down. First, I remember that the size of the wire rope affects the load capacity. The " IPS" part—I think that stands for IPC Standard Wire Size. The number in the standard (like 19) indicates the wire's diameter. So, a 6 × 19 IPS rope would mean it's a larger rope, probably made of steel to handle more tension.

The load is 7.5 tons. I think the rope's tensile strength is important here. I'm not exactly sure, but I remember that the maximum load a rope can handle depends on its tensile strength and the length over which it's used. Oh, right! The formula for maximum load is something like (Tension factor) × (Tensile strength) / (diameter squared). Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula, but I think the key is that the rope's size affects how much it can hold under its own weight and the load applied.

Wait, the drum's diameter is 96 inches. I think the drum's size is important because it determines how much weight can be lifted per unit length. Oh, right! The load capacity of the drum is often determined by its tensile strength divided by the diameter squared. So, a larger drum (larger diameter) can carry more weight because the area is bigger, reducing tension per unit length.

Wait, but what about the rope's tensile strength? Like, if the rope's tensile strength is higher, it can handle more weight. So, a 6 × 19 IPS rope—what's the tensile strength of that? I'm not exactly sure, but I think I've heard numbers like 100, 200, 300, etc. Maybe higher numbers mean stronger ropes. Wait, but the problem doesn't give me the tensile strength of the rope, so maybe it's assuming that the rope's tensile strength is sufficient for the load, or maybe the drum's size is the main concern.

Wait, but the load is 7.5 tons. So, I think the maximum load a rope can handle is determined by its tensile strength and the length over which it's used. Since the question is about lifting a depth of 760 feet, which is a long length, but the rope's length over which it's used would determine the maximum load.

Wait, but perhaps the question is more about whether the drum's diameter is sufficient. Because the drum's size determines how much weight can be lifted at any given time. The drum's tensile strength is calculated by (tensile strength) / (pi × (diameter)^2). So, a larger diameter means lower stress per unit length.

Wait, let me think about the rope and the drum separately. The rope's tensile strength must be able to handle the load plus the weight of the load. But the problem doesn't give us the rope's tensile strength. Oh, wait, perhaps the question assumes that the rope's tensile strength is suitable based on other factors, but perhaps it's the drum's size that's the main point.

Wait, the drum's size is 96 inches. I think the typical drum sizes for such applications are usually around 96 inches or less, but I'm not certain. I remember that in many construction projects, a 96-inch drum is standard. But I'm not sure about the exact acceptable sizes.

Also, the rope's diameter is 1.5 inches. Wait, is that in standard wire size? Because 6 × 19 is a standard wire size. Wait, the 6 × 19 is the standard wire's size, which corresponds to a diameter of 1.5 inches. So that part makes sense. So the rope's diameter is 1.5", which is 1½ inches. So that's the rope's size.

Now, the drum's size is 96 inches. So, the question is whether that's acceptable. I'm trying to recall the standard wire rope sizes. I think that the correct maximum recommended diameter for a rope is around 1.5", 3", 5", 7", 9", 11" inches, etc. So, 1.5" is definitely a standard rope size. So the rope is acceptable.

But wait, the drum's size is 96 inches. So, what's the standard for that? From what I remember, 96 inches is a standard drum size. So both the rope and drum are within acceptable sizes. So then, the options would be either the answer is I (both acceptable) or some other.

Wait, the options are letters from A to J. Let me look at them again.

Option I says both the rope and drum sizes are acceptable. Option E says the drum is acceptable, but rope should be thinner. Option D says rope is okay, drum needs upgrade.

Wait, but the drum is 96 inches. If that's too large, maybe because the standard is higher, but 96 inches is probably acceptable. Wait, sometimes in construction, 96 inches is okay for a drum, especially if it's a 90-foot drum or something. So I think 96 inches is acceptable.

So both the rope and drum are acceptable. That would be option I. But wait, what about the rope's material? The question also asks about the drum's material. Oh, the options are about whether the drum is acceptable.

Wait, the question says: "Check if these sizes are suitable." So I think both sizes are okay. So the correct answer would be I.

But let me think again. Some wire ropes have a minimum diameter, perhaps 1.5" is okay, but maybe the drum's diameter is too large? Wait, 96" is about 8 feet. That's a huge drum. Or perhaps for a rope, maybe a shorter rope is needed for a deeper depth, but the drum's size is about how much weight it can hold.

Wait, another factor is the length over which the rope is used. But the question gives the depth as 760 feet. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the rope's weight is a problem if it's too long. But I think the question is only about the rope diameter and drum diameter, not the length. Hmm, let me re-examine the question.

The question says, "It is suggested to use a widely applied 6 × 19 IPS rope of diameter 1(1/2) in. and drum of diameter 96 in. Check if these sizes are suitable."

So, the problem is about whether the rope and drum sizes are acceptable. So, if the rope is 1.5" and the drum is 96", are those acceptable.

I think 1.5" is acceptable, and 96" is as well. So option I: both are acceptable.

Wait, but the options are:

Option I: Both the rope and drum sizes are acceptable.

So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is presented as the correct one, but let me check the other options.

Options A through G are various combinations, but the options are letters A to J.

So, if both the rope and drum are acceptable, then the correct answer is I. But wait, the options are A through J, each giving a specific choice. So, the answer would be I.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, the rope's tensile strength—what if the rope's tensile strength is insufficient? For example, if the rope is 6 × 19, but its tensile strength is lower than the load, it won't hold. But since the question doesn't give us the tensile strength, perhaps it's assumed that the rope is good enough. So, the load is 7.5 tons, which is likely more than what a 6 × 19 rope can handle. Wait, no, that probably depends on the tensile strength. But without knowing the tensile strength, it's hard to say. But perhaps the question is only about the rope's diameter and drum's diameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the drum's size is a problem. Wait, 96 inches is 8 feet. Is that too large for the application? I'm not sure, but I think in some projects, 96" is acceptable.

Wait, another thought: the 6 × 19 IPS rope is 6 strands, each 19 AWG wire. The rope's tensile strength is probably around 70,000 psi or something. Wait, maybe I should calculate the maximum load the rope can carry.

The maximum load formula I remember is (tensile strength × 8.84) / (d^2). So, if the rope's tensile strength is 70,000 psi.

Let me compute that. 70,000 psi × 8.84 = approx 618,800. Divided by (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So 618800 / 2.25 ≈ 274,222 pounds per linear foot. Hmm, wait, but the load is 7.5 tons, which is 7500 pounds. So, the rope's maximum load per foot is about 274,222, which is way more than needed. So, the rope's tensile strength is sufficient for the load.

But wait, the question is about the drum's size. The drum's tensile strength is determined by (tensile strength) / (d^2). Wait, but without knowing the drum's tensile strength, I'm not sure. But the drum's size is 96 inches, which is a standard size. So, the drum is acceptable.

So both the rope and drum sizes are acceptable. So the answer is I.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't think any other option matches. Hmm, the options are A to J, and I is option I.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the drum is too small. Because the drum's size is 96 inches, but maybe the drum's tensile strength isn't sufficient for the load. But without knowing the drum's tensile strength, I can't be certain. So, if the question is only about the rope and drum sizes, then I think I'm correct.

So, the conclusion is that both rope and drum are acceptable. So the answer is I.

The question evaluates whether a 6 × 19 IPS rope with a diameter of 1.5 inches and a drum of 96 inches in diameter are suitable for lifting a 7.5 ton load. The analysis considers the rope's tensile strength, drum's tensile strength, and standard wire rope and drum sizes.

1. **Rope Analysis**:  
   - The rope's diameter is 1.5 inches, which is a standard size.  
   - The tensile strength of the rope, while not explicitly provided, is assumed to be sufficient for the load (7.5 tons), as the rope's maximum load capacity per unit length (274,222 lb/ft) exceeds the required 7500 lb.  

2. **Drum Analysis**:  
   - The drum's diameter is 96 inches, which is a standard size.  
   - Standard drum sizes allow sufficient tensile strength per unit length, making the drum size acceptable.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Both the rope and drum sizes are within acceptable limits, making option **I (Both the rope and drum sizes are acceptable)** correct. Other options either incorrectly state the drum's size as too small or suggest upgrading the drum's material, which is not supported by the given information.
