Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about partnerships and whether a silent partner can bind the partnership with a purchase. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about Pete Smith and Bill Jones, who are partners in a general partnership called Pete Smith Plumbing. Pete is the active partner, and Bill is the silent partner. Bill has been uninvolved for six years, but he recently bought 100 toilets for the business, and Pete is upset about it because it's a lot and will take years to use.

I need to determine the best advice for Pete. The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that in a general partnership, all partners have the authority to manage the business and can bind the partnership unless restricted by a contract or agreement. But this is a general partnership, so the default rules apply unless they've changed that in their partnership agreement.

Bill is a silent partner, but in a general partnership, both partners are generally partners in fact and law, regardless of how active they are. Even if someone is silent, they have the authority to act on behalf of the partnership unless restricted. So, the fact that Bill hasn't been involved for six years doesn't automatically mean he can't act. It's more about whether he had the authority or if the partnership can be bound by his actions.

Looking at the options:

A: The partnership can only be bound by the active partner. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Both partners can bind the partnership unless there's a restriction.

B: Silent partners are investors only and can't bind the partnership. That doesn't sound correct either. In a general partnership, partners are both principals and can bind the partnership.

C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act. This seems plausible because, as a partner, he can act on behalf of the partnership.

D: Bill's action is invalid because he didn't consult Pete. But in a partnership, partners don't need to consult each other unless the partnership agreement says so. So this might not be a valid reason.

E: The partnership can return the toilets because Bill didn't have authority. But if he had apparent authority, the partnership is bound, so they can't just return them without liability.

F: Third parties are on notice that he's unauthorized if his name isn't in the partnership name. Wait, the partnership name is Pete Smith Plumbing, so Bill's name isn't there. So third parties might think he's not authorized. But I'm not sure if that's the case because in a general partnership, all partners can act, even if their name isn't in the business name.

G: Pete can sue Bill for unnecessary expenditure. That might be a possible action, but is it the best advice? The question is about whether the partnership is bound, not about suing the partner.

H: Bill isn't authorized, so the sale can be set aside. But in a general partnership, he should be authorized unless restricted, so this might not be correct.

I: The third party can be liable for not checking his authority. But if Bill acted within the scope of the partnership, the third party might not be liable for not knowing the internal restrictions.

J: If Bill used his personal funds, the partnership isn't bound. But if he bought the toilets for the partnership, regardless of using personal funds, the partnership would be liable because the purchase was on behalf of the business.

So, putting it together, the key point is whether a silent partner can bind the partnership. Since it's a general partnership, yes, he can. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act.

The best advice is that Bill, as a silent partner in a general partnership, can bind the partnership with his actions. In a general partnership, all partners have the authority to act on behalf of the business unless restricted by agreement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act.

Answer: C
