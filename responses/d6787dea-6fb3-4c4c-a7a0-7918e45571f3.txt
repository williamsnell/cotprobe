Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem to solve using Stokes' Theorem. Hmm, I remember Stokes' Theorem relates a surface integral over a vector field's curl to a line integral around the boundary curve of the surface. The theorem is ∫∫_S (curl F) · dS = ∮_C F · dr, where C is the boundary of S.

The vector field given is F = z² i - 3xy j + x³y³ k. The surface S is the part of z = 5 - x² - y² above z=1. Since it's oriented upwards, the normal vector points in the positive z-direction.

First, I need to figure out the boundary curve C of S. The surface is a paraboloid opening downward, and it's cut by the plane z=1. So, setting z=1 in the equation z=5 - x² - y² gives 1 = 5 - x² - y² → x² + y² = 4. So the boundary is the circle x² + y² =4 in the plane z=1.

Next, I need to parameterize this boundary curve. Since it's a circle of radius 2 in the plane z=1, I can use polar coordinates. Let me use r from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π. So, the parametric equations would be x = 2 cos θ, y = 2 sin θ, z=1. So, r(θ) = (2 cos θ, 2 sin θ, 1), where θ goes from 0 to 2π.

Now, Stokes' Theorem says that the surface integral is equal to the line integral around C of F · dr. So, I need to compute ∮_C F · dr.

To compute this line integral, I can parameterize the curve and then express F in terms of the parameter θ. Let me compute F(r(θ)).

Given F = z² i - 3xy j + x³y³ k. Substituting x=2 cos θ, y=2 sin θ, z=1.

So,

F_x = z² = (1)^2 = 1.

F_y = -3xy = -3*(2 cos θ)*(2 sin θ) = -3*(4 cos θ sin θ) = -12 cos θ sin θ.

F_z = x³ y³ = (2 cos θ)^3 * (2 sin θ)^3 = 8^3 cos³ θ sin³ θ? Wait, no. Wait, (2 cos θ)^3 is 8 cos³ θ, and (2 sin θ)^3 is 8 sin³ θ. So multiplying them gives 64 cos³ θ sin³ θ. Wait, no, actually, F_z is (2 cos θ)^3 * (2 sin θ)^3 = (8 cos³ θ) * (8 sin³ θ) ? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, (2 cos θ)^3 is 8 cos³ θ, and (2 sin θ)^3 is 8 sin³ θ, so when multiplied together, it's 8 * 8 cos³ θ sin³ θ = 64 cos³ θ sin³ θ. Wait no, wait, no, the term is x³ y³, so x is 2 cos θ, so x³ = (2 cos θ)^3 = 8 cos³ θ. Similarly, y³ = (2 sin θ)^3 =8 sin³ θ. So x³ y³ = 8 cos³ θ *8 sin³ θ = 64 cos³ θ sin³ θ? No, wait, that would be (x y)^3, but x³ y³ is (x y)^3. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each component separately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me compute F_z correctly. F_z = x³ y³. So x=2 cos θ, so x³ = (2)^3 cos³ θ =8 cos³ θ. Similarly, y³=8 sin³ θ. So F_z = (8 cos³ θ)(8 sin³ θ) = 64 cos³ θ sin³ θ. That's correct.

So, F(r(θ)) = (1) i + (-12 cos θ sin θ) j + (64 cos³ θ sin³ θ) k.

Now, dr is the derivative of r(θ) with respect to θ times dθ. So, compute r'(θ):

dx/dθ = -2 sin θ,
dy/dθ = 2 cos θ,
dz/dθ = 0.

So, r'(θ) = (-2 sin θ) i + (2 cos θ) j + 0 k.

Now, the line integral is ∫_C F · dr = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) [F(r(θ)) · r'(θ)] dθ.

Compute the dot product F · r':

F_x * dx/dθ + F_y * dy/dθ + F_z * dz/dθ.

So,

1*(-2 sin θ) + (-12 cos θ sin θ)*(2 cos θ) + (64 cos³ θ sin³ θ)*0.

Simplify each term:

First term: -2 sin θ.

Second term: (-12 cos θ sin θ)*(2 cos θ) = -24 cos² θ sin θ.

Third term: 0.

So, the integrand becomes:

-2 sin θ -24 cos² θ sin θ.

Factor out -2 sin θ:

-2 sin θ (1 + 12 cos² θ).

So, the integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2π) [-2 sin θ (1 + 12 cos² θ)] dθ.

Let me split this into two parts:

-2 ∫ [sin θ + 12 cos² θ sin θ] dθ from 0 to 2π.

We can separate the integral into two:

-2 [∫ sin θ dθ + 12 ∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ].

Let me evaluate each integral.

First integral: ∫ sin θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

The integral of sin θ is -cos θ. Evaluated from 0 to 2π:

[-cos(2π) + cos(0)] = [-1 + 1] = 0.

Second integral: 12 ∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = cos θ, so du = -sin θ dθ. Then, the integral becomes:

12 ∫ u² (-du) from u=cos(0)=1 to u=cos(2π)=1.

Wait, but when θ goes from 0 to 2π, u goes from 1 to 1, but via a negative path. Let me correct that.

Wait, when θ increases from 0 to π, cos θ goes from 1 to -1, and then from π to 2π, it goes back to 1. So, the substitution would have to consider the limits properly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to notice that the integrand is an odd function around θ=π, but perhaps a better approach is to compute it as:

∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ.

Let me compute it over 0 to 2π.

Let me make substitution u = cos θ, du = -sin θ dθ.

So, ∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ = ∫ u² (-du) = -∫ u² du.

But the limits when θ=0, u=1; θ=2π, u=1 again. But since from θ=0 to π, u goes from 1 to -1, and from π to 2π, u goes back to 1. So, the substitution would split the integral into two parts, but perhaps it's easier to evaluate over 0 to 2π.

Wait, but integrating from 0 to 2π, the integral of cos² θ sin θ dθ should be zero, because it's an odd function over a symmetric interval. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, cos² θ is even, sin θ is odd. So cos² θ sin θ is an odd function. The integral over a symmetric interval around zero would be zero. But wait, our interval is from 0 to 2π, which is not symmetric around zero. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps evaluate the integral:

∫ (from 0 to 2π) cos² θ sin θ dθ.

Using substitution u = cos θ, du = -sin θ dθ.

When θ=0, u=1; θ=π, u=-1; θ=2π, u=1.

So, the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=1 to u=-1) u² (-du) + ∫ (from u=-1 to u=1) u² (-du).

Wait, that's because from θ=0 to π, u goes from 1 to -1, and from θ=π to 2π, u goes from -1 back to 1.

Wait, let me split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π and from π to 2π.

So, ∫ (0 to 2π) cos² θ sin θ dθ = ∫ (0 to π) cos² θ sin θ dθ + ∫ (π to 2π) cos² θ sin θ dθ.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: ∫ (0 to π) cos² θ sin θ dθ.

Let u = cos θ, du = -sin θ dθ.

When θ=0, u=1; θ=π, u=-1.

So, the integral becomes ∫ (u=1 to u=-1) u² (-du) = ∫ (from 1 to -1) u² (-du) = ∫ (from -1 to 1) u² du.

Which is [ (u³)/3 ] from -1 to 1 = (1/3) - (-1/3) = 2/3.

Wait, but the integral is ∫ u² (-du) from 1 to -1, which is ∫ from 1 to -1 of u² (-du) = ∫ from -1 to 1 u² du, which is 2/3.

Wait, but that's just the first part.

Second part: ∫ (π to 2π) cos² θ sin θ dθ.

Again, let u = cos θ, du = -sin θ dθ.

When θ=π, u=-1; θ=2π, u=1.

So, the integral becomes ∫ (from u=-1 to u=1) u² (-du) = ∫ (from 1 to -1) u² du = ∫ (from -1 to 1) u² du = 2/3.

Wait, but in this case, since θ goes from π to 2π, u goes from -1 to 1. So, the substitution would give:

∫ (π to 2π) cos² θ sin θ dθ = ∫ (u=-1 to u=1) u² (-du) = ∫ (from 1 to -1) u² du = ∫ (from -1 to 1) u² du = 2/3.

Wait, but the integral is ∫ (π to 2π) cos^2 θ sin θ dθ = ∫ (u=-1 to u=1) u^2 (-du) = ∫ (from 1 to -1) u^2 du = which is the same as ∫ (from -1 to 1) u^2 du, which is 2/3.

So, the total integral over 0 to 2π is 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought the function is odd and the integral would be zero. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that ∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ from 0 to 2π is zero because cos² θ sin θ is an odd function over the interval. Wait, but 0 to 2π isn't symmetric around zero, so that reasoning might not hold.

But let me check my substitution again.

Wait, when I did the substitution for the first integral from 0 to π, I got 2/3, and the second from π to 2π also 2/3. Adding them gives 4/3.

But wait, that seems inconsistent with the function's symmetry. Let me compute the integral numerically for a simple case, say, from 0 to π/2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution signs. Let me re-examine the substitution for the first integral.

First integral (0 to π):

∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ.

Let u = cos θ → du = -sin θ dθ → -du = sin θ dθ.

So, the integral becomes ∫ u² (-du) from u=1 to u=-1.

Which is ∫ from 1 to -1 u² (-du) = ∫ from -1 to 1 u² du = [u³/3] from -1 to 1 = (1/3) - (-1/3) = 2/3.

Similarly, the second integral (π to 2π):

∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ.

Again, u = cos θ, du = -sin θ dθ → sin θ dθ = -du.

When θ=π, u=-1; θ=2π, u=1.

So, ∫ (from π to 2π) cos² θ sin θ dθ = ∫ (from u=-1 to u=1) u² (-du) = ∫ (from 1 to -1) u² du = ∫ (from -1 to 1) u² du = 2/3.

So, total integral is 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3.

Wait, but that seems correct. So, the second integral in the line integral is 12 * (4/3) = 16.

Wait, but let me go back. The line integral is:

-2 [∫ sin θ dθ + 12 ∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ] from 0 to 2π.

We found ∫ sin θ dθ = 0.

∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ = 4/3.

So, substituting back:

-2 [0 + 12*(4/3)] = -2 [12*(4/3)].

Wait, 12*(4/3) is 16.

So, -2 * 16 = -32.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have -32. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the F · dr calculation.

F(r(θ)) · r'(θ) was:

(1)*(-2 sin θ) + (-12 cos θ sin θ)*(2 cos θ) + 0.

So:

-2 sin θ + (-24 cos² θ sin θ).

Which is -2 sin θ -24 cos² θ sin θ.

Factor out -2 sin θ:

-2 sin θ (1 + 12 cos² θ).

So the integral is ∫ (0 to 2π) [-2 sin θ (1 + 12 cos² θ)] dθ.

Which is equal to -2 ∫ (0 to 2π) [sin θ + 12 cos² θ sin θ] dθ.

Which is -2 [ ∫ sin θ dθ + 12 ∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ ].

We found ∫ sin θ dθ from 0 to 2π is zero.

And ∫ cos² θ sin θ dθ from 0 to 2π is 4/3.

So, substituting:

-2 [0 + 12*(4/3)] = -2 [16] = -32.

But wait, the options don't include -32. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated F · r'.

Let me recompute F · r'.

F is (1, -12 cosθ sinθ, 64 cos³θ sin³θ).

r' is (-2 sinθ, 2 cosθ, 0).

So F · r' = (1)(-2 sinθ) + (-12 cosθ sinθ)(2 cosθ) + (64 cos³θ sin³θ)(0).

So:

-2 sinθ + (-24 cos²θ sinθ) + 0.

So, that's correct: -2 sinθ -24 cos²θ sinθ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization of F?

Wait, F_z is x³ y³. x is 2 cosθ, y is 2 sinθ.

So x³ = (2)^3 cos³θ = 8 cos³θ.

y³ = 8 sin³θ.

So x³ y³ = 8 * 8 cos³θ sin³θ = 64 cos³θ sin³θ.

So F_z is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the integral.

Wait, let me recompute ∫ (0 to 2π) cos²θ sinθ dθ.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let me make substitution u = cosθ, so du = -sinθ dθ.

So ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ = ∫ u² (-du) = -∫ u² du = - (u³/3) + C.

So evaluated from 0 to 2π:

At θ=2π, u=1.

At θ=0, u=1.

So ∫ from 0 to 2π cos²θ sinθ dθ = [- (1³/3) + (1³/3)] = 0.

Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier when splitting the integral into two parts.

Wait, when I split the integral into 0 to π and π to 2π, perhaps I should have accounted for the negative sign correctly.

Wait, let me try this substitution again over the entire interval 0 to 2π.

Let u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ.

So, ∫ (0 to 2π) cos²θ sinθ dθ = ∫ (u=1 to u=1) u² (-du) = ∫ from 1 to 1 of u² (-du) = 0.

Because as θ goes from 0 to 2π, u starts at 1, goes to -1, and back to 1. So the integral from 0 to 2π is zero.

Wait, that makes more sense. So earlier, when I split the integral, I think I did it incorrectly. Let me try this substitution without splitting.

So, ∫ (0 to 2π) cos²θ sinθ dθ = ∫ (u=1 to u=1) u² (-du) = 0.

Because the limits are the same, so the integral is zero.

Wait, that's different from what I got earlier when I split the integral. So perhaps the correct value is zero.

Wait, but when I split the integral into 0 to π and π to 2π, each part gave 2/3, summing to 4/3. But that's probably because I didn't account for the direction correctly.

Wait, perhaps when I did the substitution for the second part, from π to 2π, the limits would be from u=-1 to u=1, but with the negative sign, it becomes from 1 to -1, which would be the same as integrating from -1 to 1, which is 2/3 again, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should instead note that ∫ (0 to 2π) cos²θ sinθ dθ = 0 because the function is periodic over 2π and the positive and negative areas cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps using symmetry, since cos²θ sinθ is an odd function around θ=π, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps to verify, I can compute the integral numerically for a specific case.

Compute ∫ (0 to 2π) cos²θ sinθ dθ.

Let me compute it numerically:

We can note that over 0 to π, cosθ goes from 1 to -1, and over π to 2π, it goes back to 1. The function cos²θ sinθ is positive in some regions and negative in others.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution:

Let me make substitution u = θ - π, so when θ=0, u=-π; θ=2π, u=π.

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the function has a period of 2π, and integrating over a full period would yield zero if the function is odd.

Wait, but cos²θ sinθ is an odd function around θ=π. Let me check:

Let me shift θ by π: let φ = θ - π.

Then, cos(φ + π) = -cosφ, and sin(φ + π) = -sinφ.

So cos²(φ + π) = (-cosφ)^2 = cos²φ.

sin(φ + π) = -sinφ.

So, cos²θ sinθ = cos²(φ + π) sin(φ + π) = cos²φ (-sinφ) = -cos²φ sinφ.

Which is -f(φ), so the function is odd around θ=π.

Thus, the integral from 0 to 2π would be zero because the areas cancel out.

Therefore, ∫ (0 to 2π) cos²θ sinθ dθ = 0.

So, going back, the line integral is:

-2 [ ∫ sinθ dθ + 12 ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ ] = -2 [0 + 12*0] = 0.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the line integral is zero.

Wait, but that's confusing because earlier when I split the integral, I thought it was 4/3, but perhaps that was a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the substitution over the entire interval.

Using u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ.

∫ (0 to 2π) cos²θ sinθ dθ = ∫ (u=1 to u=1) u² (-du) = 0.

Yes, because the limits are the same, so the integral is zero.

So, the line integral is -2*(0 + 12*0) = 0.

Wait, but that would mean the surface integral is zero. But looking at the options, E is 0.0.

But I'm a bit confused because earlier, when I split the integral, I thought it was 4/3, but that must have been incorrect. So the correct answer would be 0.0, which is option E.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization of F.

Wait, let me double-check F_z. F_z = x³ y³. With x=2 cosθ and y=2 sinθ, so x³ y³ = (2 cosθ)^3 * (2 sinθ)^3 = 8 cos³θ * 8 sin³θ = 64 cos³θ sin³θ. So that's correct.

Wait, but when I computed F · r', I got -2 sinθ -24 cos²θ sinθ. So the integrand was -2 sinθ(1 +12 cos²θ).

So, ∫ (0 to 2π) -2 sinθ(1 +12 cos²θ) dθ.

Which is -2 ∫ sinθ dθ -24 ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ.

We found both integrals to be zero, so the line integral is zero.

So the surface integral is zero, so the answer is E: 0.0.
</think>

To solve the problem using Stokes' Theorem, we relate the surface integral of the curl of **F** over the surface **S** to the line integral of **F** around the boundary curve **C** of **S**. The surface **S** is the part of the paraboloid \( z = 5 - x^2 - y^2 \) above \( z = 1 \), and its boundary **C** is the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \) at \( z = 1 \).

### Parameterization of the Boundary Curve
The boundary curve **C** can be parameterized as:
\[
\mathbf{r}(\theta) = (2\cos\theta, 2\sin\theta, 1), \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi
\]
The derivative is:
\[
\mathbf{r}'(\theta) = (-2\sin\theta, 2\cos\theta, 0)
\]

### Expression for **F** on the Boundary
Substituting \( x = 2\cos\theta \), \( y = 2\sin\theta \), and \( z = 1 \) into **F**:
\[
\mathbf{F} = z^2 \mathbf{i} - 3xy \mathbf{j} + x^3y^3 \mathbf{k}
\]
\[
\mathbf{F} = (1) \mathbf{i} - 12\cos\theta\sin\theta \mathbf{j} + 64\cos^3\theta\sin^3\theta \mathbf{k}
\]

### Line Integral Computation
The line integral becomes:
\[
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_0^{2\pi} \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(\theta)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(\theta) \, d\theta
\]
\[
= \int_0^{2\pi} \left[ (1)(-2\sin\theta) + (-12\cos\theta\sin\theta)(2\cos\theta) + (64\cos^3\theta\sin^3\theta)(0) \right] d\theta
\]
\[
= \int_0^{2\pi} \left[ -2\sin\theta - 24\cos^2\theta\sin\theta \right] d\theta
\]
\[
= -2 \int_0^{2\pi} \sin\theta \, d\theta - 24 \int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2\theta\sin\theta \, d\theta
\]

### Evaluation of Integrals
1. **First Integral**:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin\theta \, d\theta = 0
\]
This is because the integral of \( \sin\theta \) over a full period is zero.

2. **Second Integral**:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2\theta\sin\theta \, d\theta = 0
\]
Using the substitution \( u = \cos\theta \), \( du = -\sin\theta d\theta \), the limits of integration for \( u \) are the same over \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \), making the integral zero.

### Final Result
Substituting the results back:
\[
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = -2(0) - 24(0) = 0
\]
By Stokes' Theorem, the surface integral is equal to the line integral:
\[
\iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0
\]

**Answer:** E
