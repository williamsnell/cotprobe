Okay, I'm trying to figure out what the output of this program is. Let's see, the code is a C program with some printf statements. I remember that in C, the order of operations matters, especially when dealing with increment operators.

So, the program starts by initializing two integers, x and y, both set to 5. Then there are two printf statements.

Looking at the first printf: "%d%d\textbackslashn", x++, x. Wait, wait, the code says x++. Oh right, that's the post-increment operator. So the value of x is printed first, and then x is incremented by 1. So the first part is x++, which means we take the current value of x, print it, then add 1 to x. Then, the next %d is x again. But after the post-increment, x has already been increased. So let's break it down step by step.

Initial x is 5. The first printf is "%d%d" with x++ and x. So the first %d is x++: that's 5, then x becomes 6. The second %d is x, which is now 6. So the first line would print 56.

Now the second printf is "%d%d" with ++y and y. The ++y is the pre-increment operator, so y is increased by 1 before being used. Initial y is 5. So ++y makes it 6, then the second %d is y, which is still 6. So the second line prints 66.

Putting it together, the output should be 56 followed by 66. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option J is 56, 66. Let me check again.

Wait, wait, no, the first printf is x++, x. So first x is 5, printed, then x becomes 6. So the first part is 5, and the second is 6. So the first line is 56. Then the second printf is ++y, y. So y starts at 5, becomes 6, then printed as 6, and the next is also 6. So the second line is 66.

So the output should be 56 followed by 66. Looking at the options, option J is 56, 66.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the first line again. The first argument is x++ and the second is x. So the first value is 5, then x becomes 6. So the first printf outputs 5 and 6, making 56. The second printf uses ++y, so y becomes 6, then y is 6. So the second line is 6 and 6, making 66.

So the output is 56 followed by 66, which is option J.

The output of the program is 56 followed by 66.
