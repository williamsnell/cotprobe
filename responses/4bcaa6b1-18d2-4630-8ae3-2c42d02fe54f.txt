Question:

A college freshman obtains a score of 150 on his English final exam, a score of 100 on his math exam, a score of 55 on his chemistry exam, and a score of 30 on his history exam. The means and standard deviations for these tests are, respectively, 125 and 20 for the English exam, 90 and 10 for the math exam, 45 and 5 for the chemistry exam, and 30 and 5 for the history exam. Based on this information, you can conclude that the young man's test performance was best on which exam?

Options:

A: Math and History
B: math
C: Chemistry and History
D: English and Math
E: All of the above
F: history
G: English
H: chemistry
I: English and History
J: None of the above

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exam the college freshman did best on based on his scores and the given means and standard deviations. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when comparing performances across different tests, it's not just about the raw scores. You have to consider how those scores relate to the average (mean) and the spread (standard deviation) of each test. This is usually done by calculating the z-score for each test. The z-score tells you how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. A higher z-score means the score is better relative to the others.

So, the formula for the z-score is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the individual's score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

Let's calculate the z-scores for each subject:

1. **English Exam**:
   - Score (X) = 150
   - Mean (μ) = 125
   - Standard deviation (σ) = 20
   - Z-score = (150 - 125) / 20 = 25 / 20 = 1.25

2. **Math Exam**:
   - Score (X) = 100
   - Mean (μ) = 90
   - Standard deviation (σ) = 10
   - Z-score = (100 - 90) / 10 = 10 / 10 = 1

3. **Chemistry Exam**:
   - Score (X) = 55
   - Mean (μ) = 45
   - Standard deviation (σ) = 5
   - Z-score = (55 - 45) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2

4. **History Exam**:
   - Score (X) = 30
   - Mean (μ) = 30
   - Standard deviation (σ) = 5
   - Z-score = (30 - 30) / 5 = 0 / 5 = 0

Now, looking at the z-scores:
- English: 1.25
- Math: 1.0
- Chemistry: 2.0
- History: 0.0

The highest z-score is in Chemistry with 2.0, followed by English at 1.25, then Math at 1.0, and History at 0.0. So, the best performance was in Chemistry, then English, and Math.

Looking at the options, option H is "Chemistry," which matches the highest z-score. But wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:
A: Math and History
B: math
C: Chemistry and History
D: English and Math
E: All of the above
F: history
G: English
H: chemistry
I: English and History
J: None of the above

Wait, option H is just Chemistry. But the highest z-score is Chemistry, so the best performance was on Chemistry. However, the question says "best on which exam," so the answer should be H. But wait, when I look back, the user's initial analysis said the answer was J, but I'm getting H. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the z-scores are correct. Chemistry has the highest z-score, so the best performance was on Chemistry. So the answer should be H. But looking back, the user's initial thought process considered only English and Math, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the user's thought process seems to have concluded that the answer is J, but according to my calculations, the correct answer is H because Chemistry has the highest z-score. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are A to J, with H being chemistry. So the correct answer should be H, but the initial response suggested J. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, the initial response is from the user, and they're asking me to think through it. So based on the calculations, the best performance was on Chemistry, so the answer is H. But looking at the options, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the z-scores. Let me double-check:

English: (150-125)/20 = 25/20 = 1.25 ✔️

Math: (100-90)/10 = 1 ✔️

Chemistry: (55-45)/5 = 10/5=2 ✔️

History: (30-30)/5=0 ✔️

So yes, Chemistry is the highest. So the answer should be H. But looking at the options, H is "chemistry." So the correct answer is H.

The best performance is on the Chemistry exam, as it has the highest z-score. 

Answer: H
