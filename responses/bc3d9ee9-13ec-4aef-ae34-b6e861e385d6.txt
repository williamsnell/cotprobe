Okay, so I have this problem here about electronic parts and their lifespans. The question gives me some probabilities and asks for the mean and standard deviation assuming a normal distribution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that 60% of the parts last over 3 years. So that means the probability that a part lasts more than 3 years is 60%, or 0.6. In terms of the normal distribution, that means P(X > 3) = 0.6. Because the normal distribution is symmetric, the z-score corresponding to this probability will help me find the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).

Wait, but I also know that 70% of the parts last less than 6 years. So, P(X < 6) = 0.7. That means that 30% last 6 years or more, right? Because 100% - 70% = 30%. So P(X > 6) = 0.3.

Let me write this down:

1. P(X > 3) = 0.6 → So the z-score for X=3 is such that P(Z > z1) = 0.6. That would make z1 the value where the cumulative probability up to z1 is 0.4 (since 1 - 0.6 = 0.4). Looking at standard normal tables, a z-score of about -0.25 corresponds to 0.4013, which is close enough. So z1 ≈ -0.25.

2. P(X < 6) = 0.7 → So the z-score for X=6 is such that P(Z < z2) = 0.7. From the table, a z-score of around 0.525 corresponds to 0.7000. So z2 ≈ 0.525.

Now, using the z-score formula: z = (X - μ) / σ.

For the first point, X=3: z1 = (3 - μ)/σ = -0.25.

For the second point, X=6: z2 = (6 - μ)/σ = 0.525.

So now I have two equations:

(3 - μ)/σ = -0.25 → 3 - μ = -0.25σ → μ = 3 + 0.25σ. (Equation 1)

(6 - μ)/σ = 0.525 → 6 - μ = 0.525σ → μ = 6 - 0.525σ. (Equation 2)

Now, I can set Equation 1 equal to Equation 2:

3 + 0.25σ = 6 - 0.525σ.

Let me solve for σ.

0.25σ + 0.525σ = 6 - 3 → 0.775σ = 3 → σ ≈ 3 / 0.775.

Calculating that: 3 divided by 0.775. Let me do that division. 3 / 0.775 is the same as 3000 / 775. Let me see, 775 times 3 is 2325. 775*3.8 is 775*(3 + 0.8) = 2325 + 620 = 2945. 775*3.86 is 2945 + (0.06*775)=2945+46.5=2991.5. Hmm, 775*3.87 is 2991.5 + 7.75=3000 approx. So σ ≈ 3.87.

Wait, but 3 divided by 0.775 is exactly 3 ÷ 0.775. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.775 is 775/1000, so 3 ÷ (775/1000) = 3 * (1000/775) ≈ 3 * 1.2903 ≈ 3.8709. So σ ≈ 3.8709.

Now plug σ back into Equation 1 to find μ.

μ = 3 + 0.25 * 3.8709 ≈ 3 + 0.9677 ≈ 3.9677.

So μ ≈ 3.9677 and σ ≈ 3.8709.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option H is μ=3.977, σ=3.861. That's very close to what I got. Let me check the other options.

Option I: μ=3.977, σ=3.761. Hmm, the σ is a bit lower than what I calculated.

Option J: μ=4.077, σ=3.661. Not close.

Option D: μ=4.377, σ=3.261. Also not matching.

Wait, but my calculation gives μ ≈3.9677 and σ≈3.8709. Let me check if any option has μ around 3.97 and σ around 3.87. Option H is μ=3.977, σ=3.861, which is quite close. Option I has a lower σ. So likely H is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because the options might have more precise values.

Wait, I approximated the z-scores. Maybe I should use more precise z-values.

For P(Z > z) = 0.6 → P(Z < z) = 0.4. The exact z-score for 0.4 is around -0.2533, not -0.25. Similarly, for P(Z < z)=0.7, the exact z is 0.5244, not 0.525.

Let me recalculate using these more precise z-values.

z1 = -0.2533, z2 = 0.5244.

So the equations become:

(3 - μ)/σ = -0.2533 → 3 - μ = -0.2533σ → μ = 3 + 0.2533σ. (Equation 1a)

(6 - μ)/σ = 0.5244 → 6 - μ = 0.5244σ → μ = 6 - 0.5244σ. (Equation 2a)

Setting them equal:

3 + 0.2533σ = 6 - 0.5244σ → 0.2533σ + 0.5244σ = 6 - 3 → 0.7777σ = 3 → σ = 3 / 0.7777 ≈ 3.857.

So σ ≈3.857. Then μ = 3 + 0.2533 * 3.857 ≈ 3 + 0.2533*3.857.

Calculating 0.2533 * 3.857:

0.25 * 3.857 = 0.96425

0.0033 *3.857≈0.012728.

Total ≈0.96425 +0.012728≈0.976978.

So μ ≈3 + 0.976978≈3.976978, which is approximately 3.977.

So μ ≈3.977 and σ≈3.857. So looking at the options again, option H is μ=3.977, σ=3.861. That's very close. The slight difference might be due to rounding in the z-scores. So I think option H is the correct answer.

The problem involves determining the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the lifespan of electronic parts under a normal distribution, given that 60% last over 3 years and 70% last less than 6 years. Using z-scores corresponding to these probabilities, we set up two equations based on the z-score formula and solve for μ and σ. The calculations yield μ ≈ 3.977 and σ ≈ 3.857, which closely match option H.

Answer: H
