Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about thermal expansion. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says: There's a 200 cm³ glass flask filled to the brim with mercury at 20°C. We need to find out how much mercury overflows when the temperature is raised to 100°C. The coefficient of linear expansion for the glass is given as 0.40 × 10⁻⁵ per Kelvin. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, so first, I remember that when materials are heated, they expand. Both the flask (made of glass) and the mercury inside will expand. But since the flask is initially filled to the brim, any expansion of the flask would allow some mercury to stay, but the mercury's expansion might cause it to overflow.

Wait, actually, the glass flask will expand, increasing its volume, which would create more space. But the mercury inside will also expand, increasing in volume. The overflow is the difference between the mercury's expansion and the flask's expansion. If the mercury expands more than the flask, it overflows. If the flask expands more, maybe less overflows or none. But in this case, since the flask is filled to the brim, any expansion of the mercury beyond the flask's expansion would cause overflow.

So, I think the key here is to calculate the change in volume of both the glass and the mercury when the temperature increases from 20°C to 100°C. Then, subtract the change in flask volume from the change in mercury volume to find the overflow.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the flask's volume increases, so the amount it can hold increases. The mercury's volume also increases. The overflow would be the mercury's expansion minus the flask's expansion. Because the flask's expansion makes more room, so the excess mercury would be the difference.

So the formula for volume expansion is ΔV = V₀ * 3 * α * ΔT, right? Because volume expansion coefficient is approximately three times the linear expansion coefficient for most materials. So for glass, the linear expansion coefficient is given as α = 0.40 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹. Therefore, the volume expansion coefficient β would be 3α, which is 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ per K.

And for mercury, I think I need to know its coefficient of volume expansion. I'm pretty sure mercury has a higher expansion coefficient than glass. Let me recall, mercury's coefficient is about 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ per °C. Wait, is that right? Because I remember that mercury expands quite a bit. Let me double-check: yes, I think it's around 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ K⁻¹ for volume. Since temperature change in °C and K is the same for this purpose (since the difference is the same), I can use that.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate the change in volume of the glass flask when heated.
2. Calculate the change in volume of the mercury when heated.
3. Subtract the glass's ΔV from mercury's ΔV. The result is the overflow.

Let's get into the calculations.

First, the temperature change ΔT is 100°C - 20°C = 80°C.

For the glass flask:
Volume expansion coefficient β_glass = 3 * α_glass = 3 * 0.40e-5 = 1.2e-5 per K.
ΔV_glass = V₀ * β_glass * ΔT
V₀ is 200 cm³.
So ΔV_glass = 200 * 1.2e-5 * 80.

Let me compute that:
200 * 1.2e-5 = 200 * 1.2 = 240; 240e-5 = 0.0024
0.0024 * 80 = 0.192 cm³.

So the glass expands by 0.192 cm³.

Now for the mercury:
Volume expansion coefficient β_mercury = 1.8e-4 per K.
ΔV_mercury = V₀ * β_mercury * ΔT
Again, V₀ is 200 cm³.
So ΔV_mercury = 200 * 1.8e-4 * 80.

Let me compute that:
200 * 1.8e-4 = 200 * 0.00018 = 0.036
0.036 * 80 = 2.88 cm³.

So the mercury expands by 2.88 cm³.

Now, the overflow is the mercury's expansion minus the glass's expansion because the glass's expansion allows more room, so the excess is the difference.

Overflow = ΔV_mercury - ΔV_glass = 2.88 - 0.192 = 2.688 cm³.

Looking at the options, the closest value is F: 2.4, but wait, 2.688 is closer to 2.7, which is option G. Hmm, but let's make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Let me double-check the calculations.

For glass:
β_glass = 3 * 0.4e-5 = 1.2e-5
ΔV_glass = 200 * 1.2e-5 * 80
200 * 1.2e-5 = 0.0024
0.0024 * 80 = 0.192 cm³. That's correct.

Mercury:
β_mercury = 1.8e-4
ΔV_mercury = 200 * 1.8e-4 *80
200 *1.8e-4 = 0.036
0.036 *80=2.88 cm³. Correct.

Overflow=2.88-0.192=2.688 cm³≈2.7 cm³. So option G is 2.7.

Wait, but the options are given as A:3.2, B:2.1, C:1.2, D:3.9, E:1.5, F:2.4, G:2.7, H:4.0, I:3.6, J:1.8.

So 2.7 is option G. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me check: the glass's linear expansion is 0.4e-5, so volume is 3x that, which is correct.

Mercury's volume expansion coefficient, I think I'm correct at 1.8e-4. Alternatively, maybe 1.8e-5? Wait, no, I'm pretty sure it's higher. Let me think: glass is about 0.4e-5 linear, so volume is 1.2e-5. Mercury's volume expansion is higher, like 1.8e-4, which is 18e-5, which is 10 times higher than glass's volume expansion. That makes sense because mercury expands more.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is ΔV = V₀ * β * ΔT, and I did that correctly. So yeah, 200 *1.8e-4=0.036, times 80 is 2.88.

So the overflow is 2.88 - 0.192 = 2.688, which is approximately 2.7 cm³. So the answer should be G:2.7.

Wait, but I don't see option G as 2.7 in the options given. Let me check again the user's list.

Wait, the options are:

A:3.2
B:2.1
C:1.2
D:3.9
E:1.5
F:2.4
G:2.7
H:4.0
I:3.6
J:1.8

Ah, yes, G is 2.7, so that's the correct answer.

Wait, but sometimes, when dealing with such problems, I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: the glass's volume increases by 0.192 cm³. So the flask can now hold 0.192 cm³ more mercury. But the mercury itself has expanded by 2.88 cm³. So the total mercury would require 200 + 2.88 cm³, but the flask can only hold 200 + 0.192 cm³. So the overflow is the difference: 2.88 - 0.192 = 2.688 cm³.

Yes, that's correct. So the overflow is 2.688 cm³, which is approximately 2.7 cm³. So the correct answer is G.

The problem involves calculating the overflow of mercury in a glass flask when the temperature increases from 20°C to 100°C. Both the glass and mercury expand due to thermal expansion. The overflow is the difference between the mercury's volume expansion and the flask's volume expansion.

1. **Temperature Change**: ΔT = 100°C - 20°C = 80°C.
2. **Glass Flask Expansion**:
   - Linear expansion coefficient (α) = 0.40 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹.
   - Volume expansion coefficient (β) = 3α = 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹.
   - Initial volume (V₀) = 200 cm³.
   - Change in volume (ΔV_glass) = 200 × 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ × 80 = 0.192 cm³.
3. **Mercury Expansion**:
   - Volume expansion coefficient (β) = 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ K⁻¹.
   - Change in volume (ΔV_mercury) = 200 × 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ × 80 = 2.88 cm³.
4. **Overflow Calculation**:
   - Overflow = ΔV_mercury - ΔV_glass = 2.88 - 0.192 = 2.688 cm³ ≈ 2.7 cm³.

The closest option is **G: 2.7**.
