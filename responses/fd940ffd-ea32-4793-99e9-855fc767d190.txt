Question:

The code fragment below is intended to display "odd" if the positive number num is odd.
 IF (<MISSING CONDITION>)
 DISPLAY “odd”

 Which of the following can be used to replace <MISSING CONDITION> so that the code fragment will work as intended?

Options:

A: (num MOD 1) = 1
B: (num MOD 3) = 1
C: (num DIV 2) = 1
D: (num MOD 1) = 0
E: (num MOD 2) = 1
F: (num MOD 2 ) = 0
G: (num DIV 2) = 0
H: (num MOD 0) = 1

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the correct condition should be in the IF statement to make the code display "odd" when the number is odd. Let's see... The code is in some programming language, but I think the concepts are similar across many. 

The question is about determining whether a number is odd. I remember that in programming, checking if a number is odd usually involves using the modulus operator. The modulus gives the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, for example, if num is 5 and we do num MOD 2, that should give 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.

So the condition should check if the remainder when num is divided by 2 is 1. That would mean the number is odd. Let me look at the options.

Option A: (num MOD 1) = 1. Wait, dividing by 1 would always give a remainder of 0, right? Because any number divided by 1 is itself with 0 remainder. So this condition would never be true. So A is incorrect.

Option B: (num MOD 3) = 1. Hmm, this would check if the number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. That doesn't directly tell us if it's odd. For example, 4 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 1, but 4 is even. So B isn't right.

Option C: (num DIV 2) = 1. The DIV operator gives the quotient, not the remainder. So if num is 3, 3 DIV 2 is 1, which is correct because 3 is odd. But wait, what about 5? 5 DIV 2 is 2, which is not equal to 1. So this condition would fail for numbers larger than 3. So C isn't a general solution.

Option D: (num MOD 1) = 0. As with option A, since mod 1 is always 0, this condition is always true. But we want it to be true only when num is odd, so D is incorrect.

Option E: (num MOD 2) = 1. This makes sense because when you divide an odd number by 2, the remainder is 1. So this condition should correctly identify odd numbers.

Option F: (num MOD 2) = 0. This would be true for even numbers, so if the condition was F, it would display "odd" for even numbers, which is wrong.

Option G: (num DIV 2) = 0. This would only be true for numbers less than 2, like 0 or 1. But 1 is odd, but 0 is even. So G isn't a general solution.

Option H: (num MOD 0) = 1. Wait, dividing by zero is undefined and would cause an error. So H is invalid.

So the correct condition is E: (num MOD 2) = 1.
</think>

The correct condition is to check if the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is 1. This is because any odd number divided by 2 will leave a remainder of 1. Among the options provided, only option E satisfies this condition.

E: (num MOD 2) = 1

The answer is E.

Answer: E
