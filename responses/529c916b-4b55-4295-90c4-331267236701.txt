Okay, so I've got this question about colors and how they appear under different lighting conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that a piece of paper appears blue in sunlight. So, in normal daylight, when all the colors are present, the paper looks blue. That probably means the paper absorbs other colors and reflects blue. I remember from school that objects appear the color they reflect. So if it's blue in sunlight, it's because the paper is reflecting blue light and absorbing the other colors in the spectrum.

Now, the tricky part is what happens when the paper is illuminated by a red light that's passed through a green filter. Wait, red light with a green filter? That seems a bit confusing. Let me think about how filters work. A filter only allows light of its own color to pass through. So a green filter would let green light through and block other colors. But the light source is red, so the light before the filter is red. Hmm, that must mean the filter is changing the red light somehow.

Wait, no. The light is red, but it's passed through a green filter. So normally, a green filter would only allow green light to pass. But if the light is red, which is a different color, wouldn't the green filter block most of it? Because red and green are on opposite ends of the color wheel, I think. Oh wait, no, red and green are actually complementary colors. So a green filter would block red light. Because when you mix red and green, you get yellow, but when you have a filter, it only lets its own color through. So if the light is red and the filter is green, the green filter would absorb the red light, right? So the resulting light after the filter would be... almost nothing? Or maybe some very dark color.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include dark colors except black. Let me think again. The original light is red, and the filter is green. The green filter would only allow green light to pass, but the source is red. So if red light hits a green filter, the filter would block most of the red, allowing very little to pass. So the light after the filter would be mostly dark, maybe almost no light.

But wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recall the color theory. Pigments and filters work by subtracting colors. So when a filter is placed over a light source, it transmits only its own color. So a red light source emits red light. When you put a green filter in front of it, the filter will only let green light through. But wait, that's if the filter is colored green, which is a subtractive filter. So the green filter would take the red light and remove all colors except green. But red is a primary color, and green is another primary. Wait, no, in additive color mixing, red and green make yellow, but in subtractive, it's different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of what colors are transmitted. If the light is red (say, wavelength around 650 nm) and the filter is green (around 550 nm), the green filter would absorb the red light because red is not green. So very little or no light would pass through, making the area under the light appear black because there's no light illuminating it.

But wait, the paper is being illuminated by this filtered light. So if the paper is blue in sunlight, which means it reflects blue. But under red light with a green filter, the paper would be illuminated with very little or no light that it can reflect. Because the paper's color is blue, which is part of the spectrum. Let me think: if the light shining on the paper is green (after the filter), and the paper is blue, does it reflect any light?

Wait, no. Wait, the light after the filter is green. The paper is blue. So when green light hits the blue paper, what happens? The paper can only reflect blue. But since the incoming light is green, which is a different color, the paper would absorb the green light and not reflect anything, meaning it would appear black.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to approach it methodically. 

1. The paper appears blue in white light. So it reflects blue and absorbs other colors (red and green, perhaps? Because blue + green = cyan, but maybe I'm mixing things up).

2. The light source is red, meaning it emits red light. When this red light passes through a green filter, the filter allows only green light to pass. So the resulting light is green.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the filter is green, so it only allows green light to pass through. If the original light is red, then the green filter would block the red, so the transmitted light would be very dim, almost no light. Because green and red are complementary; they don't overlap. So the filter would absorb the red light, resulting in no light passing through.

But that can't be right because then the paper would be in darkness, appearing black. So the answer would be black, option C.

Wait, but another way: when red light passes through a green filter, does any light get through? Because red and green are different wavelengths. The filter would only transmit green, so if the source is red, no green would pass. So the paper is illuminated with no light, so it appears black.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the filter only allowing green to pass. So the paper is under green light. The paper is blue, so when green light hits it, the paper reflects blue. But wait, blue is not present in the incoming green light. So the paper would absorb the green light and not reflect anything, making it look black.

Wait, but another angle: the paper appears blue in white light because it reflects blue. That means the paper's color is blue, so its pigment absorbs the other colors. When illuminated with green light, the paper would only reflect green if it has green pigment. But the paper is blue, so it doesn't reflect green; it reflects blue. But the incoming light is green, so the paper can't reflect any green, so it absorbs all the green, making it appear black.

So the conclusion is that the paper appears black under that illumination. So the answer is C: Black.

The paper appears blue in sunlight because it reflects blue light and absorbs other colors. When illuminated by red light passed through a green filter, the filter allows only green light to pass, as it absorbs other wavelengths. Since the paper is blue, it does not reflect green light, leading it to absorb all the incoming green light and appear black.

Answer: C
