Okay, so I have this question about barometers. The question is asking what happens when a barometer uses water instead of mercury. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that a barometer measures atmospheric pressure. The traditional mercury barometer has a glass tube filled with mercury, which is then inverted into a dish of mercury. The height of the mercury column is what indicates the atmospheric pressure. Mercury is a heavy metal, so the column doesn't need to be very tall to show changes in pressure.

Now, if we replace mercury with water, which is much less dense, the same atmospheric pressure would require a much taller column of water. Because water is lighter than mercury, the barometer would need to be longer to achieve the same pressure measurement. That makes me think that the barometer would be taller. Looking at the options, E is "taller," so that's a possibility.

Wait, but are there other factors? I think about the density of the fluid in a barometer. The formula for pressure is P = ρgh, where P is pressure, ρ is density, g is gravity, and h is height. Since ρ is much lower for water than mercury, h must be much higher to maintain the same pressure. So the barometer would indeed be taller, which points to option E.

Let me check other options to make sure. Option B is "shorter," which doesn't make sense because water is less dense, so the height should increase. Option C says "heavier," but since we're using water instead of mercury, which is denser, maybe the mass isn't the issue here as much as the height. But I think the question is about the barometer's physical structure, not the mass of the fluid. So the barometer itself would need to be taller, not necessarily heavier, because it's the height of the fluid column that matters.

Another thought: could the barometer be inoperable? Option J says that. I don't think so because water can still be used in a barometer; it's just that the tube needs to be longer. So J is probably not the right answer.

Options about accuracy, sensitivity, expense, etc., like F, G, H, I, G: less sensitive to temperature changes? Mercury expands more with temperature than water, so a mercury barometer would be more sensitive to temperature changes. Wait, that's the opposite. If you use a less dense fluid like water, the expansion might be different. But I'm not sure if that affects the sensitivity. The question is about the height of the barometer, so maybe the other options aren't directly relevant.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: taller.

The correct answer is E: taller. A water-based barometer requires a taller column to measure atmospheric pressure due to water's lower density compared to mercury.
