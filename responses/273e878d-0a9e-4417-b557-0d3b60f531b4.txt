She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address "to view a picture of the car," which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was "used and sold as is." When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for

Options:

A: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.

C: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.
D: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
E: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."
F: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.
G: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.
H: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.
I: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about Carol Collector and the Thunderbird purchase. Let me break it down step by step.

First, Carol saw an ad for a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000. The ad had a website with a picture of the car. The picture showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol then paid the $25k and signed a sales contract that said the car was "used and sold as is." When she went to pick it up, it turned out to be a 1968 model, which isn't rare and is worth less than the 1964 model. Now, she's suing the seller. The question is, what's the likely outcome?

Hmm, so the key points here are the advertisement, the picture, the contract, and the actual car. Let's think about the elements involved. This seems like a case of misrepresentation or fraud in advertising. In contract law, if a seller misrepresents a material fact, the buyer can sometimes rescind the contract or seek damages.

The ad said it was a 1964 model, but it was actually a 1968. The difference in year is significant because it affects the valueâ€”1964 might be more collectible and expensive, while 1968 is less so. Carol relied on the ad and the picture when she bought the car. The contract had an "as is" clause, which usually means the buyer takes the product as they find it, but that doesn't necessarily protect the seller if there was fraud or misrepresentation.

I remember that in some cases, an "as is" clause can be effective, but if the seller made a false statement of fact, especially regarding a material aspect, the buyer might still have a claim. For example, if the seller actively misled the buyer, the "as is" clause might not protect them because the buyer relied on the seller's false information.

Looking at the options, option D says the seller because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement. That seems relevant because the ad said 1964, but it was 1968. Option H says the seller unless Carol can prove she relied on the picture. But in this case, Carol did rely on the picture, which showed a 1964 model. So if she can prove reliance, the seller is liable.

Wait, but what about the "as is" clause? If the seller didn't hide anything and just made a mistake, maybe the clause would hold. But here, the seller put up a picture of a 1964, so that's an intentional misrepresentation. So the "as is" clause wouldn't save them because the misrepresentation vitiates the contract.

Looking at the options, option D seems correct because the advertisement misrepresented the car's model year, which is a material fact. The buyer relied on that, so the seller is liable.

The key issue is the misrepresentation in the advertisement regarding the car's model year. The seller advertised a 1964 Thunderbird but delivered a 1968 model, which significantly affected the value. Carol relied on the ad and the provided picture when purchasing the car. While the contract included an "as is" clause, such clauses do not protect sellers from liability if they make material misrepresentations. Therefore, the seller is likely liable for misrepresentation in the advertisement.

Answer: D
