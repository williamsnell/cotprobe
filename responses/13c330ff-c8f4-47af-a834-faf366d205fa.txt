Question:

Which statement best describes the circumstances that have shaped the emergence of peace studies as a field of research?

Options:

A: Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide.
B: Peace studies developed during the 1960s and 1970s as a reaction to the civil rights movement and anti-war protests, focusing on social justice issues and the role of nonviolent resistance in promoting peace.
C: Developed as a response to World War I, peace studies focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation that exist within the global system, with the aim of promoting peace through the equal distribution of these resources.
D: The field of peace studies emerged during the Cold War, primarily focusing on the East-West divide and the potential for nuclear war, with a secondary focus on the impact of war on the environment.
E: Peace studies emerged as a field of research in the post-Cold War era, largely driven by the need to understand and address the root causes of internal conflicts and civil wars.
F: Developed during the era of decolonization, peace studies focuses on the legacy of colonialism and its impact on conflicts and tensions in the global South.
G: Peace studies developed as a discipline following the Cold War when the security studies paradigm shifted to include areas of concern such as environmental, societal and economic security. As a field of research peace studies adopts a Euro-centric approach to security and has thus been defined by developments within the West and wealthier nations.
H: Peace studies emerged as a response to the developing nuclear capability of states during the Cold War. The aim of peace studies is to secure the state as a referent object and does this through the study of weapons accumulation. The approach is particularly focused on the nuclear arms race between East and West.
I: Peace studies emerged in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, primarily focusing on the issues surrounding war atrocities and the impact of war on civilian populations.

Okay, so I need to figure out which option best describes the emergence of peace studies as a field of research. Let me go through each option one by one and see which makes the most sense.

Starting with option A: It says peace studies developed after WWII because International Relations failed to prevent global conflict after WWI. It mentions the nuclear arms race and Cold War, then quickly moved to environmental issues and North-South divides. That seems plausible because after WWII, especially during the Cold War, there was a lot of focus on preventing nuclear war. But I'm not sure if it's correct that it "quickly" embraced environmental and North-South issues. Maybe, but I'll keep it in mind.

Option B: Developed during the 1960s and 70s due to civil rights and anti-war protests, focusing on social justice and nonviolent resistance. The 1960s were indeed a time of significant social change and anti-war movements, especially against the Vietnam War. So this could be a factor, but was this the primary reason for the emergence of peace studies? I'm not certain, but it's a possible angle.

Option C: Response to WWI, focusing on wealth and resource disparities. WWI did lead to some peace movements, like the formation of the League of Nations, but I'm not sure if peace studies as a formal field emerged then. It seems more like after WWII, especially with the Cold War, that peace studies gained more traction. So maybe C is not the best fit.

Option D: Emerged during the Cold War, focusing on East-West divide and nuclear war, with some environmental focus. This sounds familiar. The Cold War's nuclear threat was a major driver for studying how to prevent such conflicts. Environmental issues might have come later, but the primary focus was definitely on the East-West and nuclear aspects. This seems strong.

Option E: Emerged post-Cold War, focusing on internal conflicts and civil wars. After the Cold War, there was a shift in focus towards internal conflicts, but I think peace studies as a field started earlier, during the Cold War. So E might not be the best answer.

Option F: Developed during decolonization, focusing on colonialism's impact. While decolonization was a significant event, especially in the mid-20th century, I'm not sure if peace studies' emergence was primarily due to that. It might be a part of the broader context but not the main driver.

Option G: Emerged after the Cold War when security studies shifted to environmental, societal, and economic issues. It also mentions a Euro-centric approach. While post-Cold War did see a shift in focus, I think peace studies started earlier. Plus, Euro-centric might not fully capture the global perspective now.

Option H: Response to developing nuclear capability during the Cold War, focusing on state security through weapons study. This is similar to D but more narrowly focused on weapons accumulation. While nuclear arms were a big part, peace studies might have a broader scope beyond just weapons.

Option I: Emerged after the Vietnam War, focusing on war atrocities and civilian impact. The Vietnam War did influence a lot of anti-war sentiment and studies, but again, I think the broader emergence of peace studies was more tied to the Cold War's nuclear threat.

So, putting it together, option A mentions the post-WWII era and the Cold War, which aligns with the emergence of peace studies. It also includes the shift to environmental and North-South issues, which might be a bit of an extension but still relevant. Option D is also strong, focusing on the Cold War's East-West divide and nuclear issues. 

Wait, but the question is about what best describes the circumstances. The Cold War's nuclear arms race and the East-West divide are key factors. Option D says it emerged during the Cold War, primarily focusing on those issues. Option A says it developed after WWII as a response to IR's failure post-WWI, which might be a bit off because peace studies likely gained more momentum during the Cold War rather than right after WWII.

So, between A and D, I think D is more accurate because the Cold War era, with its nuclear threat, was the main driver for the field's emergence. Option A's mention of quick embrace of environmental and North-South issues might be a secondary development, not the primary shaping factor.

The emergence of peace studies as a field of research was significantly influenced by the global circumstances of the Cold War era, particularly the nuclear arms race and the East-West divide. During this period, the threat of nuclear war and the ideological tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union created a pressing need to understand and address the causes of conflict and the means to achieve peace. This context led to the development of peace studies, which focused on preventing nuclear annihilation and exploring alternatives to war. While the field later expanded to include issues like environmental sustainability and the North-South wealth divide, these were secondary developments that came after the initial focus on the Cold War's central conflicts.
