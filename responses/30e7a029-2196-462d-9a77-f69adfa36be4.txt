Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this economics question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about what open market operation the central bank should perform to move the economy closer to full employment by increasing the federal funds rate. The options are about buying or selling bonds, how the money supply changes, the effect on aggregate demand, and what they're trying to fight.

First, I remember that the federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks use when they borrow from each other overnight. So when the central bank wants to increase this rate, they're making it more expensive for banks to borrow money. That usually happens when they want to reduce the money supply because higher interest rates encourage savings and reduce borrowing, which in turn reduces spending and investment.

Now, open market operations involve the central bank buying or selling government bonds. If the central bank buys bonds, they inject money into the economy because they pay for the bonds, which increases the money supply. Conversely, if they sell bonds, they take money out of the economy, decreasing the money supply.

Since the central bank wants to increase the federal funds rate, they must be trying to decrease the money supply. That means they're selling bonds. So the first part of the answer should be "Sell bonds."

Next, selling bonds would decrease the money supply. So the second blank should be "Decreases."

Now, a decrease in the money supply typically leads to a decrease in aggregate demand because there's less money available for spending and investing. So the third blank is "Decreases."

Finally, when the central bank raises interest rates and reduces the money supply, they're trying to fight inflation. Because if the economy is overheating, demand-pull inflation is a risk, and reducing money supply helps cool it down. So the last blank is "Inflation."

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Buy bonds → Decreases → Decreases → Unemployment. No, because we need to sell bonds.

B: Sell bonds → Increases → Decreases → Unemployment. Wait, if they sell bonds, money supply decreases, not increases. So second part is wrong.

C: Buy bonds → Increases → Decreases → Unemployment. Wrong because we're selling.

D: Sell bonds → Increases → Decreases → Inflation. No, because selling bonds decreases money supply, so the second part is wrong.

E: Buy bonds → Increases → Increases → Unemployment. Not correct.

F: Sell bonds → Decreases → Decreases → Unemployment. Wait, money supply decreases, AD decreases, but why fight unemployment? If the economy is at full employment, maybe they're fighting inflation, not unemployment.

G: Buy bonds → Increases → Increases → Inflation. No, because we're selling.

H: Sell bonds → Decreases → Decreases → Inflation. This matches what I thought: Sell bonds, money supply decreases, AD decreases, fighting inflation.

I: Buy bonds → Decreases → Increases → Inflation. No, because buying increases money supply.

J: Sell bonds → Increases → Increases → Inflation. No, because selling decreases money supply.

So the correct option is H: Sell bonds, which decreases the money supply, decreases aggregate demand, and fights inflation.

To move the economy closer to full employment by increasing the federal funds rate, the central bank must perform an open market operation that decreases the money supply, thereby reducing aggregate demand and fighting inflation. The appropriate action is to sell bonds, which decreases the money supply, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand and targeting inflation.

Answer: H
