Okay, so I have this question about calculating the percent markup based on the selling price. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the television costs $180 and the retailer buys it for $136.50. Wait, actually, wait a second. Is the cost the retailer's cost or the selling price? The question says it costs the retailer $136.50. So, the cost price is $136.50. The selling price is $180. So, the markup is the difference between these, right?

So, first, I need to calculate the markup amount. That's selling price minus cost price. So, $180 minus $136.50. Let me do that math: 180 minus 136.50. Hmm, 180 minus 136 is 44, and then minus 0.50 is 43.50. So, the markup is $43.50.

Now, the question asks for the markup percentage based on the selling price. So, I need to find what percentage $43.50 is of $180. To find a percentage, I take the markup divided by the selling price, then multiply by 100.

So, the formula is (Markup / Selling Price) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: (43.50 / 180) * 100.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 43.50 divided by 180. Hmm. 180 goes into 43.50 how many times? Well, 180 times 0.24 is 43.20. Because 180 * 0.2 is 36, and 180 * 0.04 is 7.2. 36 + 7.2 is 43.2. So, 0.24 gives 43.2, which is close to 43.50. The difference is 0.30.

So, 0.30 divided by 180 is 0.001666... So, adding that to 0.24 gives approximately 0.241666... Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 24.1666...%, which is about 24.17%.

Looking at the options, option E is 24.17%, so that's the answer.

To calculate the percent markup based on the selling price:

1. **Markup Amount**: Selling Price ($180) - Cost Price ($136.50) = $43.50.
2. **Markup Percentage**: (Markup / Selling Price) × 100 = (43.50 / 180) × 100 ≈ 24.17%.

**Answer**: E: 24.17%
