Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers."
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
Which of the following explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must "avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity"?

Options:

A: Disunity might lead to the failure of political unions within the African continent.
B: African nations will not achieve independence without unity.
C: Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.
D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.
E: The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.

Okay, so I've got this question about Kwame Nkrumah's statement from 1961. The question is asking why Nkrumah thinks Africa must avoid the dangers of disunity. I need to choose the correct explanation from options A to J, but in this case, the options provided are A to E.

First, I'll read the quote carefully to understand his main point. He says that the greatest contribution Africa can make to world peace is by avoiding disunity through creating a political union. This union, by its success, would stand as an example to a divided world. He also mentions that a union would project the African personality and gain respect because the world respects size and influence. Then he gives examples: the world ignored African opposition to French atomic tests in the Sahara and the UN's indecision in the Congo while the country was falling into anarchy. He says this shows the callous disregard of African independence by the Great Powers.

So, the main idea here is that unity is crucial for Africa to gain respect and effectiveness on the global stage. Without unity, Africa is ignored or treated dismissively by larger powers.

Looking at the options:

A: Disunity might lead to the failure of political unions within Africa. Hmm, this seems a bit circular. He's talking about avoiding disunity to form a union, but the option is about the failure of unions due to disunity. I'm not sure if that's the main point. It might be more about the consequences, but not directly the reason he's emphasizing.

B: African nations won't achieve independence without unity. Wait, but the quote is from 1961, and many African nations had already gained independence by then. So this might not be the main point, as he's talking about the current situation and the need for a union beyond independence.

C: Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray. The quote does mention the Congo example, which was in disarray, but the main issue seems to be that without unity, the world doesn't take Africa seriously, leading to issues like being ignored in the Sahara tests and the Congo crisis.

D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence. This seems to align with his statement. He says that a union would command respect because the world respects size and influence. So without unity, Africa's smaller size and lack of influence mean they're disregarded, as seen in the examples.

E: The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars. While that's true, the quote doesn't explicitly mention past civil wars as the reason for needing unity. Instead, it's about the current situation and gaining respect.

So the key point is that the world respects size and influence, so without unity, Africa is ignored. Therefore, option D seems to be the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.

Answer: D
