Okay, so I have this question about patent law and jury trials. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a patent holder suing a licensee for patent infringement in federal court. The patent holder thinks a jury would be more sympathetic, so he wants a jury trial. The question is, what should his lawyer do to secure that right?

First, I remember that in U.S. federal courts, the right to a jury trial isn't automatic. You have to request it properly. I think there's a specific time frame for this. 

I remember something about the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 38, which deals with jury demands. From what I recall, a party has to demand a jury trial within a certain number of days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. 

Wait, the last pleading—so that could be an answer or a reply. But the key point is the time limit. I'm pretty sure it's 14 days, but I might be mixing that up with something else. Alternatively, I think it's 30 days. Hmm. 

Let me think. Oh right, I think the general rule is that you have to serve a written demand for a jury trial within 14 days after the last pleading related to the issue is served. But wait, sometimes the time can be extended if the parties agree, but the default is 14 days.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 60 days after pleadings close.
Option B: 30 days.
Option C: At the initial court hearing.
Option D: Exclude jury in complaint—no, that's the opposite.
Option E: Verbal request at first hearing—probably not, because it's usually written.
Option F: At initial pretrial conference—maybe, but I think the demand has to be earlier.
Option G: Include in the complaint—does the complaint need to include it? Or is it a separate document?
Option H: 14 days after complaint served.

Wait, the complaint is the initial pleading. So the initial pleading is the complaint. The defendant's answer is the next pleading. The last pleading would be the answer. So, after that, you have 14 days to demand a jury.

But wait, sometimes the initial pleading is just the complaint, and if the defendant files an answer, that's the last pleading directed to the issue. So the patent holder (the plaintiff) files the complaint, the defendant files an answer. Then, the plaintiff has 14 days after the answer is served to demand a jury.

But in this question, the scenario is that the patent holder is the plaintiff and the licensee is the defendant. So the plaintiff files the complaint, the defendant files an answer. Then, the plaintiff has 14 days after the answer to demand a jury.

Looking at the options, option H says "within 14 days after the complaint was served." But wait, the complaint is the first pleading, so the answer is the last pleading. So the 14 days would run from when the answer is served, not the complaint.

But none of the options specify that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 60 days after pleadings close. Pleadings close when the last pleading is filed, which is the answer. So 60 days after that? That seems too long.

Option B: 30 days after pleadings close. Still longer than 14.

Option C: At initial court hearing. Probably too early, unless the court requires it.

Option E: Verbal request—no, it's usually written.

Option F: At initial pretrial conference. That's after the initial stages, so probably too late.

Option G: Include in the complaint. I think you can include a jury demand in the complaint, but is that the only way? Or is it a separate document? I'm not sure, but some sources say you can include it in the complaint.

Option H: 14 days after the complaint was served. Wait, that's from the plaintiff's complaint. But the defendant's answer would be after that. So if the complaint is served, and then the answer is filed, the 14 days would run from when the answer is served, not the complaint. So option H might not be correct.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The rule says the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. The last pleading would be the defendant's answer. So the 14 days would start when the answer is served. But none of the options mention that. 

Looking at the options, option H is 14 days after the complaint was served. But that's before the defendant files the answer, which is the last pleading. So if the plaintiff waits until after the answer is served, that's when the 14 days start. But the options don't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe the complaint is the pleading, and if the defendant doesn't answer, the time runs from the complaint. But in reality, the defendant does answer, so the 14 days would be after the answer.

Wait, but the question is about the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff files the complaint, and the defendant files the answer. Then, the plaintiff has 14 days after the answer is served to demand a jury.

So none of the options directly say 14 days after the answer is served. But looking at the options, option H is 14 days after the complaint was served. That would be too early because the answer hasn't been filed yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial pleading is the complaint, and the last pleading is the answer. So the period runs from the answer. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check what each option says.

Option A: 60 days after close of pleadings. That's too long.

Option B: 30 days after close of pleadings. Still longer than 14.

Option C: At initial court hearing. Unlikely, as jury demand needs to be in writing.

Option E: Verbal request—no, must be written.

Option F: At initial pretrial conference. Probably after the initial deadline.

Option G: Include in the complaint. I think you can, but it's not clear if that's the only way.

Option H: 14 days after complaint served. So if the complaint is served on day 1, then 14 days later. But the answer would be filed later than that, so H might be too early.

Wait, perhaps the initial pleading is the complaint, and the last pleading is the answer. So the 14 days start when the answer is served. But the options don't have that. So which option is correct?

Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading is served, which would be the answer. But the options don't mention that.

Looking back, the options are:

A: 60 days after close of pleadings.

B: 30 days after close of pleadings.

C: At initial court hearing.

D: Exclude jury in complaint.

E: Verbal at first hearing.

F: At initial pretrial conference.

G: Include in complaint.

H: 14 days after complaint served.

I think the correct answer is either G or H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is H if the time starts from the complaint, but that would be incorrect because the last pleading is the answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe the 14 days run from the service of the last pleading directed to the issue, which is the answer. So if the answer is served on day X, the demand must be within 14 days of X. But none of the options specify that.

Alternatively, maybe the initial pleading is the complaint, and the period starts from that. But that would mean the demand has to be within 14 days, but the answer hasn't been filed yet, so it's possible to include it in the complaint.

Wait, I think you can include the jury demand in the complaint. So option G says "File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand." That might be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the demand has to be a separate document within the 14 days after the last pleading.

But the question says the patent holder wants to obtain a jury trial, so the lawyer needs to make a jury demand. The options are about when to file it.

If the answer hasn't been filed yet, the plaintiff can include the jury demand in the complaint. So option G would be correct.

Alternatively, if the answer has been filed, the plaintiff must serve a separate jury demand within 14 days of the answer.

But the question doesn't specify whether the answer has been filed yet. It just says the patent holder brought the action and wants a jury. The lawyer needs to ensure the demand is made correctly.

In federal court, the general rule is that the party must serve a written demand for a jury trial within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. If no pleading is filed by the defendant, the plaintiff can demand a jury trial within 14 days after the complaint is served.

Wait, so if the defendant hasn't filed an answer yet, the plaintiff can include the jury demand in the complaint or serve it within 14 days after the complaint is served.

So in this case, the patent holder is the plaintiff. He files the complaint, and then the defendant (licensee) will file an answer. Once the answer is filed, the plaintiff has 14 days to demand a jury.

But the question is, what should the lawyer do? The options don't mention the answer, so perhaps the correct answer is H: 14 days after the complaint was served. But that would be before the answer is filed, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, the plaintiff can include the jury demand in the complaint, which would be option G. That might be the correct approach because it's allowed to include it in the initial pleading.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is either G or H. Since the complaint is the initial pleading, the jury demand can be included in it. So option G would be correct.

The question revolves around the procedural requirements for securing a jury trial in a federal patent infringement case. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38, a party must demand a jury trial in writing within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. The last pleading is typically the defendant's answer to the complaint. However, the plaintiff can include a jury demand in the initial complaint or serve it separately within the applicable timeframe.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (60 days after pleadings close)**: This exceeds the 14-day requirement.
- **Option B (30 days after pleadings close)**: Also exceeds the 14-day requirement.
- **Option C (At initial court hearing)**: Jury demands must be made in writing, not verbally at the hearing.
- **Option D (Exclude jury in complaint)**: This is the opposite of what is needed.
- **Option E (Verbal request)**: Jury demands must be written, not verbal.
- **Option F (At initial pretrial conference)**: This is too late, as the demand must be made earlier.
- **Option G (Include in complaint)**: Allowed, as the jury demand can be included in the initial pleading.
- **Option H (14 days after complaint served)**: This is correct if the last pleading is the complaint, but the defendant's answer is typically the last pleading, making this option too early.

Given the context, the most appropriate action is to include the jury demand in the complaint, as it is a valid and timely method to secure a jury trial.
