Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the wavelength of a sound. Hmm, I remember that the speed of sound depends on the temperature, right? The question says the temperature is 15 degrees Celsius. Wait, I think the speed of sound in air at 0°C is about 331 meters per second, and for each degree Celsius increase, it goes up by approximately 0.6 m/s. So at 15°C, the speed should be 331 + (15 * 0.6). Let me calculate that: 15 times 0.6 is 9, so 331 + 9 equals 340 m/s. Got that.

The frequency given is 1000 cycles per second, which is the same as 1000 Hz. I remember the formula wavelength equals speed divided by frequency. So wavelength λ = v / f. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 340 m/s divided by 1000 Hz. Let me do that division: 340 divided by 1000 is 0.34 meters per cycle. Wait, but the answer options are in feet. Oh right, I need to convert meters to feet. I think 1 meter is approximately 3.28084 feet. So 0.34 meters times 3.28084 gives me the wavelength in feet.

Calculating that: 0.34 * 3.28084. Let me break it down. 0.3 * 3.28084 is about 0.984, and 0.04 * 3.28084 is around 0.131. Adding those together gives roughly 1.115 feet. Hmm, looking at the options, let me check the choices. The options are A to J, with various numbers. The closest to 1.115 would be option J: 1.12 ft/cycle. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the speed of sound. Oh wait, sometimes the speed at 15°C is taken as 343 m/s. Oh right, because 331 + (15 * 0.6) is 340, but maybe the exact value is a bit higher. Let me recalculate that. 15 * 0.6 is 9, so 331 + 9 is 340. So 340 m/s is correct. Alternatively, maybe the speed is given as 340 m/s exactly for this problem. So wavelength is 340/1000 = 0.34 m.

Converting to feet: 0.34 * 3.28084. Let me compute this accurately. 0.3 *3.28084 = 0.98425, 0.04*3.28084=0.1312336. Adding them gives 0.98425 + 0.1312336 = 1.1154836 feet. So approximately 1.1155 ft. Looking at the options again, option J is 1.12, and option F is 1.15. Hmm, 1.1155 is closer to 1.12 than 1.15, so J is the correct option. Wait, but I think I might have seen somewhere that the speed of sound at 15°C is 343 m/s. Let me check that. Oh yeah, I think the formula is 331 + (0.6*T), where T is temperature in Celsius. So 331 + (15*0.6) = 340 m/s. So 340/1000 is 0.34 m, which is 1.115 ft. So the answer should be J: 1.12 ft/cycle.

The wavelength is calculated using the formula λ = v / f, where v is the speed of sound at 15°C (340 m/s) and f is the frequency (1000 Hz). Converting meters to feet gives approximately 1.12 ft/cycle.

Answer: J
