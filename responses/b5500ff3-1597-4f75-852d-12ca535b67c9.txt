Okay, so I have this problem where X follows a normal distribution with a mean of 9 and a standard deviation of 3. I need to find the probability that X is between 5 and 11, which is P(5 < X < 11). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with normal distributions, it's helpful to standardize the values using the Z-score formula. The Z-score tells us how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

So, I'll calculate the Z-scores for both 5 and 11. 

Starting with X = 5:
Z = (5 - 9) / 3 = (-4) / 3 ≈ -1.3333.

Next, for X = 11:
Z = (11 - 9) / 3 = 2 / 3 ≈ 0.6667.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is between -1.3333 and 0.6667. That is, P(-1.3333 < Z < 0.6667). 

I recall that standard normal distribution tables give the probability that Z is less than a certain value. So, to find P(-1.3333 < Z < 0.6667), I can calculate P(Z < 0.6667) minus P(Z < -1.3333).

Let me look up these Z-scores in the standard normal table. 

For Z = 0.6667, which is approximately 0.67, I think the table value is around 0.7456. Wait, let me double-check. The Z-table for 0.67 gives 0.7486, but maybe I should use more precise values. Alternatively, using a calculator or a more detailed table, 0.6667 would correspond to about 0.7453.

For Z = -1.3333, which is approximately -1.33, the table value is around 0.0910. Wait, no, I remember that Z = -1.33 gives P(Z < -1.33) as about 0.0918.

So, now I subtract the lower probability from the upper one: 0.7453 - 0.0918 = 0.6535. 

Looking at the options, option E is 0.65361, which is very close to my calculation. So, the probability P(5 < X < 11) is approximately 0.6536, which would correspond to option E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I remember the Z-table correctly? For Z = 0.6667, if I use a calculator, the CDF (cumulative distribution function) is about 0.7453, and for Z = -1.3333, it's about 0.0918. Subtracting gives 0.6535, which rounds to 0.6536. Yep, that's correct. So, the answer should be E.

To solve P(5 < X < 11) for X ~ N(9, 3), we standardize X to Z-scores: Z₁ = (5 - 9)/3 ≈ -1.3333 and Z₂ = (11 - 9)/3 ≈ 0.6667. Using the standard normal distribution, P(-1.3333 < Z < 0.6667) = Φ(0.6667) - Φ(-1.3333) ≈ 0.7453 - 0.0918 = 0.6535, which rounds to 0.6536.
