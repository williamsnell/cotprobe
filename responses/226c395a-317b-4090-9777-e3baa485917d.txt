Okay, so I've got this question about the CAPM model and calculating the required rate of return for two stocks. Let me break it down step by step. I remember that CAPM stands for Capital Asset Pricing Model, and it's used to determine the expected return of an asset based on its beta, which measures its volatility relative to the market.

The question gives me two stocks, A and B. Stock A has a beta of 0.8, and Stock B has a beta of 1.4. The expected market return is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 7%. I need to find the required rate of return for both stocks using the CAPM formula.

The CAPM formula is: Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). So, I'll calculate each stock's required return separately.

Starting with Stock A: Beta is 0.8. Plugging into the formula, it's 7% + 0.8*(10% -7%). Let me compute the difference first: 10% minus 7% is 3%. Then multiply by 0.8: 0.8 *3% = 2.4%. Add that to the risk-free rate: 7% +2.4% =9.4%. So Stock A's required return is 9.4%.

Now for Stock B: Beta is 1.4. Using the same formula: 7% +1.4*(10% -7%). The difference again is 3%, so 1.4 *3% =4.2%. Adding that to 7% gives 11.2%. So Stock B's required return is 11.2%.

Looking at the options, I need to find the pair where A is 9.4% and B is 11.2%. Scanning the options:

Option C says 9.4% and 11.2%. That matches exactly. Let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 

For Stock A: 7 + (0.8 *3) =7+2.4=9.4. Correct.

For Stock B: 7 + (1.4 *3)=7+4.2=11.2. Correct.

So the answer should be option C.

The required rate of return for Stock A is 9.4% and for Stock B is 11.2%, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
