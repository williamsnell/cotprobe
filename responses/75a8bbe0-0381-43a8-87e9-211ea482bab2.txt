Question:

In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.
B: the buyer, if the farmer knew about the mortgage to the investor but did not disclose it.
C: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances protects against future claims on the property.
D: the buyer, because the covenant of the right to convey was breached.
E: the farmer, because the son's mortgage to the investor was not mentioned in the deed.
F: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
G: the farmer, if the mortgage to the investor was satisfied before the sale to the buyer.
H: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
I: the farmer, because the buyer did not perform a thorough title search before purchasing the property.
J: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me start by breaking down the facts and the legal concepts involved.

So, the landowner in 1888 had a dairy farm. He conveyed it to his son in 1938. Then, the son gave it to his friend in 1953, but the deed wasn't recorded until after the son died in 1957. Then, in 1956, the son mortgaged the farm to the bank, and this mortgage was recorded in 1956. But the mortgage instrument says it's subordinate to a mortgage given by the son to an investor in 1936, which was recorded in 1936. So, in 1936, the son gave a mortgage to the investor, and that was recorded. Then in 1956, he gave another mortgage to the bank, which was recorded, but the bank's mortgage was subordinate, meaning the investor's mortgage takes priority over the bank's.

In 1979, the friend conveyed the farm to a farmer, and that deed was recorded but didn't mention any mortgages. Then, in 2008, the farmer sells to a buyer for $75k, closing on Jan 15, 2009. All deeds are general warranty deeds. The jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages.

The buyer later learns about the 1936 mortgage to the investor, which wasn't satisfied, and sues the farmer for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

The question is about who gets judgment—buyer or farmer—and why.

First, let's recall what a general warranty deed includes. It has covenants: seisin, right to convey, against encumbrances, warranty, and quiet enjoyment. The buyer is claiming breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

In a title theory state, mortgages are considered a lien on the property, and the mortgagee holds the legal title until the loan is repaid. So, the investor's mortgage in 1936 was a lien, and the bank's in 1956 was subordinate.

The recording act is notice-type. So, a subsequent purchaser (like the friend in 1979) is protected if they take without notice of prior unrecorded deeds. But if they have notice, they might be bound.

The chain of title: 1888 to son (1938), son to friend (1953, recorded 1957), friend to farmer (1979, recorded). The son's 1936 mortgage to investor was recorded in 1936, so when the friend conveyed in 1979, the recording would have been available. But the friend's deed didn't mention any mortgages. Wait, but the friend didn't know about the mortgages? Or did they?

Wait, the friend got the farm from the son in 1953, but the deed wasn't recorded until 1957. So, when the friend took the farm in 1953, the 1936 mortgage was already recorded. Because the recording was in 1936. So, the friend, when they took the property in 1953, should have had notice of the 1936 mortgage because it was already recorded. Therefore, when the friend conveyed to the farmer in 1979, the farmer would have had notice of the 1936 mortgage because it was recorded before.

But wait, the friend's deed to the farmer was a general warranty deed. So, the friend made covenants, including against encumbrances. But the friend's deed didn't mention the mortgage. So, when the farmer bought from the friend, he got a general warranty deed, which would include covenants. But the friend may have breached the covenant against encumbrances if there were encumbrances.

But the farmer then sold to the buyer in 2008. The farmer's deed to the buyer included the covenant against encumbrances. The buyer is now claiming that because of the 1936 mortgage, which wasn't satisfied, the farmer breached that covenant.

But wait, the 1936 mortgage was subordinate to the 1956 mortgage to the bank. So, the bank's mortgage was recorded in 1956, which is after the 1936 one. So, the investor's mortgage was senior. But when the son died in 1957, did that affect the mortgages? Also, in 1956, the son mortgaged to the bank, which was subordinate. So, the bank's mortgage was junior.

Now, in 1979, the friend conveys to the farmer. The friend's deed was a general warranty, so the friend covenants that there are no encumbrances. But the friend took the property in 1953 from the son, but the son's title was subject to the 1936 mortgage. So, when the friend took it in 1953, the 1936 mortgage was already on the property because it was recorded. Therefore, the friend's title was subject to that mortgage, which means the friend couldn't covenant that there were no encumbrances because there was the 1936 mortgage.

Wait, but the friend took the property in 1953, but the deed wasn't recorded until 1957. So, when the friend conveyed in 1979, the 1936 mortgage was already recorded, so the farmer would have had notice. But the friend's deed to the farmer didn't mention any mortgages. So, the farmer took the property subject to the 1936 mortgage because it was recorded before the friend's conveyance.

But the issue is whether the farmer's deed to the buyer included the covenant against encumbrances. The buyer is now claiming breach because of the 1936 mortgage.

Wait, but the 1936 mortgage was recorded in 1936, so when the friend received the property in 1953, the mortgage was already on the title. Therefore, the friend's title was subject to it. So, when the friend conveyed to the farmer, he couldn't make a covenant against encumbrances because the mortgage existed. But the friend's deed to the farmer was a general warranty deed, which included that covenant. So, the friend breached that covenant.

But the farmer then sold to the buyer, and the farmer's deed also included the covenant against encumbrances. So, the farmer's title was subject to the mortgage, so when the farmer conveyed to the buyer, he also couldn't make that covenant. Wait, but the farmer's title came from the friend, who had a title subject to the mortgage. So, the farmer's deed to the buyer would have the same issue.

But the buyer is suing the farmer, claiming breach of the covenant against encumbrances because of the 1936 mortgage.

Now, in a notice-type recording jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser (like the friend) is protected if they take without notice. But the friend took in 1953, after the 1936 mortgage was recorded. So, the friend had notice, meaning the friend's title was subject to the mortgage. Therefore, the friend couldn't covenant against encumbrances because there was a mortgage.

So, when the friend conveyed to the farmer, he breached the covenant against encumbrances. But the farmer, in turn, conveyed to the buyer with the same covenant. So, the farmer's title was subject to the mortgage, so the farmer also breached the covenant when conveying to the buyer.

But wait, the 1936 mortgage was given by the son to the investor, and the 1956 mortgage to the bank was subordinate. So, the investor's mortgage would take priority over the bank's. But does that affect the current issue? The buyer is concerned about the 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied.

Now, the question is whether the covenant against encumbrances is breached if there is an outstanding mortgage. Yes, because a mortgage is an encumbrance. So, if the property is subject to a mortgage, that's an encumbrance, and the covenant against encumbrances would be breached.

But in this case, the 1936 mortgage was recorded, so the friend had notice when taking in 1953, and thus the farmer had notice when taking in 1979. Therefore, when the farmer conveyed to the buyer, he had notice of the mortgage, so the covenant against encumbrances was breached.

But wait, the deed from the friend to the farmer didn't mention the mortgage. But in a general warranty deed, even if it's not mentioned, the covenants are made. So, the friend's deed to the farmer included the covenant against encumbrances, which was breached because the property was subject to the 1936 mortgage. Similarly, the farmer's deed to the buyer also included the covenant, which was breached.

But the buyer is suing the farmer. The options are about whether the buyer can recover.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the buyer wins because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee the property isn't subject to outstanding rights. That seems correct because the mortgage is an outstanding right.

Option H says the buyer wins because the covenant was breached at the time of conveyance, so the buyer can recover. That's also correct because covenants in a deed are breached at the time of conveyance if there's a defect in title.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the covenant against encumbrances is breached only if an encumbrance arises after the conveyance. Or is it breached at the time of conveyance if there's an existing encumbrance?

I think the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, which is breached at the time the deed is delivered if there's an existing encumbrance. So, when the farmer conveyed to the buyer, if there was a mortgage, the covenant was breached immediately.

So, the buyer can sue for breach because the covenant was breached at the time of conveyance.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee... This is correct.

Option H: Because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, so buyer can recover. This is also correct.

Wait, but the options might have different reasoning. Let me read them again.

Option F says the covenant is a guarantee that the property isn't subject to outstanding rights. That's correct.

Option H says the covenant is breached at conveyance, so buyer can recover. That's also correct.

Wait, but in some states, the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, breached at the time of conveyance if there are encumbrances. So, the buyer can recover because the covenant was breached when the farmer conveyed the property.

So, which option is correct? Both F and H seem correct, but I need to see the exact phrasing.

Option F: because the covenant against encumbrances protects against future claims.

Wait, no, the covenant against encumbrances is about existing claims, not future. It's about the title being clear as of the date of conveyance.

So, the buyer is protected against existing encumbrances at the time of conveyance. The 1936 mortgage was an existing encumbrance, so the covenant was breached.

Therefore, the buyer can recover because the covenant was breached at conveyance.

Looking back at the options, H says the buyer can recover because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time of conveyance.

So, option H is correct.

But wait, let me check other options.

Option A: the farmer, unless covenantee is disturbed in enjoyment. That's the covenant of warranty, which is a future covenant. But the buyer is suing under the covenant against encumbrances, a present covenant.

Option B: buyer if farmer knew but didn't disclose. The recording statute is notice, so if the farmer had notice, they would be bound. But the farmer's title came from the friend, who had notice because the mortgage was recorded. So, the farmer had notice, so the covenant was breached.

Option C: buyer because the covenant protects against future claims. No, it's about existing.

Option D: buyer because covenant of right to convey was breached. That's a different covenant, but the issue is against encumbrances.

Option E: farmer because the mortgage wasn't mentioned in the deed. But the covenant is in the deed, regardless of mention.

Option F: buyer because the covenant is a guarantee. Correct in part, but the breach occurs at conveyance.

Option G: farmer if mortgage was satisfied before sale. But it wasn't; it's still pending.

Option I: farmer because buyer didn't do a title search. But the buyer is relying on the covenant, and in a general warranty deed, the buyer doesn't have to do a search; the seller warrants the title.

Option J: farmer because the covenant may only be breached if at all at conveyance. But that's incorrect; the covenant is breached at conveyance if there's an encumbrance.

So, the correct reasoning is that the covenant against encumbrances was breached at the time of conveyance because the property was subject to the 1936 mortgage. Therefore, the buyer can recover.

Looking at the options, both F and H seem relevant, but F's reasoning is about the guarantee, and H is about the timing of the breach.

The correct answer is F or H. Wait, let me think again.

The covenant against encumbrances is breached if, at the time of conveyance, there are encumbrances. The 1936 mortgage was an encumbrance existing at the time the farmer conveyed to the buyer. Therefore, the covenant was breached, and the buyer can recover.

So, looking at the options, Option F and H both relate, but the precise reason is that the covenant was breached at conveyance.

Option H says: "the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages."

Yes, that's correct. So, the answer is H.

The question revolves around the breach of the covenant against encumbrances in a real estate transaction. The key facts are that the property was subject to a mortgage from 1936, which was recorded and thus put subsequent purchasers on notice. The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it is breached at the time of conveyance if there are existing encumbrances. Since the 1936 mortgage was an existing encumbrance when the farmer conveyed the property to the buyer, the covenant was breached. Therefore, the buyer is entitled to recover damages.

Answer: H
