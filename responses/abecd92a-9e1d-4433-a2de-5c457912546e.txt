Okay, I need to solve this thermodynamics problem about entropy change during a polytropic process. Let's start by understanding the problem.

So, we have three kilograms of air initially at 100 kPa and 300 K. It's being compressed polytropically with n=2.56 to a final pressure of 500 kPa. We need to find the change in entropy using the ideal gas equations, assuming constant specific heats.

First, I remember that for an ideal gas undergoing a polytropic process, the change in entropy can be calculated using the formula:

Δs = cp * ln(T2/T1) - R * ln(P2/P1)

Wait, or is it using the relation for polytropic processes? Oh right, in a polytropic process, TV^n = constant, but since it's an ideal gas, I can relate temperatures and pressures using the polytropic relations.

Alternatively, the entropy change can be expressed in terms of pressure and temperature. But since we have a polytropic process, maybe I should find the final temperature first.

Wait, the formula for entropy change for an ideal gas when undergoing a polytropic process is:

Δs = (cp / (n-1)) * ln(P1/P2) - (R / (n-1)) * ln(P2/P1)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the general formula for entropy change is:

Δs = cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1)

But this applies when the process is such that the specific heats are constant. So regardless of the process, as long as cp and R are constant, this formula should hold.

So first, I need to find T2, the final temperature after compression.

Since the process is polytropic (P V^n = constant), I can relate the initial and final states using this relation. Also, for an ideal gas, PV = mRT, so I can relate the pressures and temperatures.

Let me write down the polytropic process equation:

P1 * V1^n = P2 * V2^n

But since it's an ideal gas, V = mRT/P. So substituting:

P1 * (m R T1 / P1)^n = P2 * (m R T2 / P2)^n

Simplify:

P1 * (m R T1)^n / P1^n = P2 * (m R T2)^n / P2^n

Divide both sides by (m R)^n:

P1 * T1^n / P1^n = P2 * T2^n / P2^n

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to use the relation for T2 in terms of T1.

I recall that in a polytropic process, the temperature and pressure are related by:

(T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1)^((n-1)/n)

Yes, that sounds right. So let's compute that.

Given P1 = 100 kPa, P2=500 kPa, so P2/P1 = 5.

n = 2.56, so (n-1)/n = (1.56)/2.56 ≈ 0.609375

So T2 = T1 * (5)^(0.609375)

Let me calculate 5^0.609375.

I think I can approximate this. Let me see:

5^0.6 is about e^(0.6 ln5). ln5 ≈ 1.6094, so 0.6 * 1.6094 ≈ 0.9656. e^0.9656 ≈ 2.629.

But since the exponent is 0.609375, which is a bit higher than 0.6, maybe around 2.65 or so.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

But perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute ln(5) ≈ 1.6094.

So 0.609375 * ln(5) ≈ 0.609375 * 1.6094 ≈ 0.609375 * 1.6 is 0.975; 0.609375 * 0.0094 ≈ ~0.00573. So total ≈ 0.9807.

So e^0.9807 ≈ e^0.98 is about 2.664.

So T2 ≈ 300 K * 2.664 ≈ 800 K? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because when you compress a gas, temperature increases. So 300 K to 800 K is a big jump, but let's check the calculation.

Wait, wait, no—wait! I think I messed up the exponent. Because (n-1)/n is positive, so yes, T2 increases.

But let me confirm the formula. The formula is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((n-1)/n). Yes, that's correct.

So P2/P1 is 5, (n-1)/n is (2.56-1)/2.56 = 1.56 / 2.56 ≈ 0.609375.

So 5^0.609375 ≈ e^(0.609375 * ln5) ≈ e^(0.609375 * 1.6094) ≈ e^(0.9807) ≈ 2.664.

So T2 = 300 * 2.664 ≈ 799.2 K. Let's take it as approximately 800 K.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 5^0.609375 more accurately.

Another approach: Let me compute 5^0.609375.

0.609375 = 1.56/2.56.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms or exponents more accurately.

Alternatively, let me use approximate values. For example, 5^0.6 ≈ 5^(3/5) ≈ cube root of 5^3 = 125, but 5^3=125, but 5^(3/5) is the fifth root of 125, which is about 2.626.

But 0.609375 is a bit more than 0.6, so maybe around 2.65.

So T2 ≈ 300 * 2.65 ≈ 795 K. Let's take it as 795 K for calculation purposes.

Now, we can compute the entropy change using the formula:

Δs = cp * ln(T2/T1) - R * ln(P2/P1)

Wait, but wait—what are the values of cp and R for air?

I remember that for air, R (gas constant) is about 0.287 kJ/kg·K. Cp for air is about 1.005 kJ/kg·K.

So, Δs = (1.005) * ln(795/300) - (0.287) * ln(500/100)

Compute each part:

First, ln(795/300) = ln(2.65) ≈ 0.9755.

Then, 1.005 * 0.9755 ≈ 0.9804 kJ/kg·K.

Next, ln(500/100)=ln(5)≈1.6094.

So R * ln(P2/P1) = 0.287 * 1.6094 ≈ 0.4615 kJ/kg·K.

So Δs = 0.9804 - 0.4615 ≈ 0.5189 kJ/kg·K.

But wait, that's per kg. We have 3 kg, so total entropy change is 0.5189 * 3 ≈ 1.5567 kJ/°K.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.57 kJ/°K, which is close to this value. So the answer should be F.

The entropy change is calculated using the formula:

Δs = cp * ln(T2/T1) - R * ln(P2/P1)

For air, cp ≈ 1.005 kJ/kg·K and R ≈ 0.287 kJ/kg·K. The final temperature T2 is determined using the polytropic relation:

T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((n-1)/n)

With P2/P1 = 5 and (n-1)/n ≈ 0.609375, T2 ≈ 300 K * 2.664 ≈ 795 K. Substituting into the entropy formula:

Δs = (1.005) * ln(795/300) - (0.287) * ln(5)

ln(795/300) ≈ 0.9755 and ln(5) ≈ 1.6094. Thus:

Δs ≈ (1.005 * 0.9755) - (0.287 * 1.6094) ≈ 0.9804 - 0.4615 ≈ 0.5189 kJ/kg·K.

For 3 kg, Δs_total ≈ 0.5189 * 3 ≈ 1.5567 kJ/°K, which matches option F.
