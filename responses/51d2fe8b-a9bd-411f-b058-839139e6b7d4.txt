Okay, so I need to figure out how many three-digit positive integers there are. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that a three-digit number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. Each of these places can have certain digits.

The hundreds place can't be zero because then it wouldn't be a three-digit number anymore. So the hundreds digit can be from 1 to 9. That gives me 9 possible choices for the hundreds place.

Next, the tens place can be any digit from 0 to 9. So that's 10 possible choices for the tens digit.

Similarly, the units place can also be any digit from 0 to 9, giving another 10 possible choices.

To find the total number of three-digit numbers, I think I need to multiply the number of choices for each place together. So that would be 9 (hundreds) * 10 (tens) * 10 (units). 

Let me calculate that: 9 * 10 is 90, and 90 * 10 is 900. So there should be 900 three-digit numbers.

Looking at the options, option A is 900. That makes sense because, for example, the smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999. If I count from 100 to 999 inclusive, that's 900 numbers. Just to double-check, 999 minus 100 is 899, but since I include both ends, I add 1, making it 900. Yep, that's correct.

The number of three-digit positive integers is calculated by considering the possible digits for each place. The hundreds place has 9 options (1-9), and the tens and units places each have 10 options (0-9). Multiplying these gives 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.
