Okay, so I need to figure out what happens when we observe the visible spectrum of a star through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas. Hmm, I remember from my basic astronomy that when light passes through a gas, certain spectral lines can appear depending on whether the gas is emitting or absorbing light.

Wait, the star emits its own spectrum, which is a blackbody spectrum. But when it passes through hydrogen gas, the gas might absorb certain wavelengths. Oh right, if the gas is cooler than the light it's interacting with, it causes absorption lines. Because the gas absorbs specific wavelengths corresponding to its elements.

Cool hydrogen gas would be at a lower temperature, so when the star's light, which comes from a hotter source, passes through this gas, the gas absorbs the light at the wavelengths it emits. So, hydrogen's absorption lines would appear in the star's spectrum. But wait, the star's spectrum is a continuous blackbody, right? So when the gas absorbs, it creates dark lines where the light is missing.

So the observed spectrum should be the star's blackbody with absorption lines from hydrogen. Looking at the options, option G says "You see the star’s blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen." That makes sense because the gas is absorbing, not emitting. Emission lines would come from the gas being excited, like if it were a nebula emitting on its own.

Wait, but if the gas is between us and the star, the star's light would have absorption lines because the gas is cooler. If the gas were emitting, like in a glowing cloud, we might see emission lines. But here, the scenario is viewing the star through the gas, so it's absorption, not emission. So option G is correct.

When observing the visible spectrum of a star through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas, the star emits a continuous blackbody spectrum. As this light passes through the cool hydrogen gas, the gas absorbs specific wavelengths corresponding to hydrogen's spectral lines. Since the gas is cooler than the star, it does not emit light but instead absorbs, resulting in absorption lines in the star's spectrum. Therefore, the observed spectrum is the star’s blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen.

Answer: G
