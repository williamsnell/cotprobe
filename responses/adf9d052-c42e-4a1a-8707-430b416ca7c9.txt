Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the multiplicity of the root ξ = 1 for the polynomial P(x) = x^5 - 2x^4 + 4x^3 - x^2 -7x +5. Then, using that information, I need to find P'(2) + P''(2) and choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that the multiplicity of a root is the number of times it occurs as a root of the polynomial. To find the multiplicity of ξ = 1, I can use synthetic division. I think the process involves dividing the polynomial by (x - 1) repeatedly until it's no longer a factor, and the number of times I can do this will give the multiplicity.

Let me start by performing synthetic division with ξ = 1 on P(x). So I set up the coefficients: 1 (x^5), -2 (x^4), 4 (x^3), -1 (x^2), -7 (x), and 5 (constant term).

I bring down the first coefficient (1) and multiply by 1, then add to the next coefficient. Let me write this out step by step.

1 | 1  -2   4   -1   -7    5
        1    -1    3     2    -5
    ----------------------------
      1  -1    3     2    -5    0

So the remainder is 0, which means (x - 1) is a factor. Now, I take the quotient polynomial from the synthetic division: x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x -5.

I'll call this Q1(x) = x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x -5.

Now, I need to check if 1 is a root again. I'll perform synthetic division on Q1(x) with ξ = 1.

1 | 1  -1   3    2   -5
        1    0    3     5
    ---------------------
      1   0    3    5    0

Again, the remainder is 0, so (x -1) is a factor again. The new quotient Q2(x) is x^3 + 0x^2 + 3x +5, which simplifies to x^3 +3x +5.

Now, I'll test Q2(x) at x=1.

1 | 1   0    3    5
        1    1    4
    -----------------
      1   1    4    9

The remainder is 9, which is not zero. So, (x -1) is not a factor of Q2(x). That means the multiplicity of ξ =1 is 2 because we could factor out (x -1) twice.

Wait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. I think I made a mistake in the last synthetic division step. Let me double-check.

Wait, Q2(x) is x^3 +3x +5. When I plug in x=1, P(1) should be 1 +3 +5 =9, which is correct. So the remainder is 9, so 1 is not a root of Q2(x). So the multiplicity is 2.

Now, I need to find P'(2) + P''(2). To do that, I'll first find the derivatives P'(x) and P''(x), then evaluate them at x=2 and sum them.

Alternatively, since we have the original polynomial, I can compute the derivatives directly.

First, let's find P'(x).

P(x) = x^5 -2x^4 +4x^3 -x^2 -7x +5

P'(x) = 5x^4 -8x^3 +12x^2 -2x -7

P''(x) is the derivative of P'(x):

P''(x) = 20x^3 -24x^2 +24x -2

Now, I need to compute P'(2) and P''(2).

Let's compute P'(2):

P'(2) = 5*(2)^4 -8*(2)^3 +12*(2)^2 -2*(2) -7
= 5*16 -8*8 +12*4 -4 -7
= 80 -64 +48 -4 -7
Let me calculate step by step:

80 -64 = 16
16 +48 = 64
64 -4 = 60
60 -7 = 53

So P'(2) = 53.

Now P''(2):

P''(2) =20*(2)^3 -24*(2)^2 +24*(2) -2
= 20*8 -24*4 +48 -2
= 160 -96 +48 -2
Calculating step by step:

160 -96 = 64
64 +48 = 112
112 -2 = 110

So P''(2) =110.

Adding them together: 53 +110 =163.

Looking at the options, H is 163. So the answer should be H.

The multiplicity of ξ = 1 is 2. Calculating P'(2) and P''(2) gives 53 and 110, respectively. Their sum is 163.
