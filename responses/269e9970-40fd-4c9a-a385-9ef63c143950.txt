Question:

One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the father did not retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege.
B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.
C: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.
D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.
E: admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public.
F: admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father was.
G: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.
H: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.
I: inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship.
J: inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with attorney-client privilege. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a pilot's plane ran out of gas, leading to an emergency landing that injured a 9-year-old boy. The boy's father is suing the pilot for negligence. The boy and his father went to see an attorney for initial discussions but didn't retain that attorney. Instead, the father hired another lawyer. Now, at trial, the pilot's attorney is trying to call that consulting attorney to testify about what the boy said during their meeting regarding his physical condition.

The question is about whether this testimony is admissible. The options revolve around attorney-client privilege and whether it applies here.

First, I need to recall what attorney-client privilege entails. Generally, communications between a client and their attorney are confidential and protected from being disclosed in court unless certain exceptions apply. The key elements for the privilege are: (1) the communication was made between a client and an attorney, (2) the communication was intended to be confidential, and (3) the purpose was to seek legal advice or assistance.

In this case, the boy and his father went to meet an attorney, but they didn't retain that attorney. So, was there an attorney-client relationship? Well, just meeting for preliminary discussions doesn't necessarily establish a formal attorney-client relationship unless the attorney is actually retained. So, maybe the consulting attorney wasn't the boy's attorney. But wait, the father didn't retain him, but the boy might be considered a client if he was acting on his own interests, but that's tricky because the father is the one suing on his behalf.

Option I says it's inadmissible because the consultation was preliminary and didn't form a formal attorney-client relationship. That might be a point because without retention, the privilege might not apply. But I'm not sure if the privilege requires formal retention or if a preliminary consultation can still be protected.

Another point is whether the boy is considered a client. Since the father is the one suing, maybe the father is the client, not the boy. So, under option F, if the boy wasn't the client, then the privilege wouldn't apply. But wait, the boy was present during the consultation, so even if the father was the client, the boy might still have some privilege if he was seeking legal advice on his own behalf.

But then, the father didn't retain the consulting attorney, so the attorney's role was just for initial discussions. If they didn't retain him, then maybe there's no privilege because the attorney wasn't acting as the boy's lawyer. So the consulting attorney could testify about what the boy said because there was no formal attorney-client relationship.

Looking at the options, option A says it's admissible because the father didn't retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege. That makes sense because without retention, the attorney isn't representing the client, so the privilege doesn't attach. 

Alternatively, option I suggests it's inadmissible because the consultation was preliminary. But I think the key here is whether the attorney was retained. If not, the privilege might not exist. So A might be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the fact that the boy was a minor? Option J says it's inadmissible because minors can't waive their privilege. But I think minors can waive it, though they might need to do so through a guardian or something. But in this case, the father is the one who didn't retain the attorney, so the boy's presence doesn't necessarily create a waiver. Hmm, not sure about that.

Another angle: since the consulting attorney wasn't retained, any statements made during the meeting wouldn't be privileged. So the pilot's attorney can call that consulting attorney to testify about the boy's statements because there's no privilege. That would make option A correct.

So, putting it together, the consulting attorney isn't the boy's attorney, so the privilege doesn't apply, making the testimony admissible. So the answer should be A.

The scenario involves a negligence lawsuit where the pilot's attorney seeks to call a consulting attorney to testify about the boy's statements during a preliminary consultation. The key issue is whether attorney-client privilege applies. Since the father did not retain the consulting attorney, there was no formal attorney-client relationship, which nullifies any privilege. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

Answer: A
