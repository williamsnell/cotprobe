Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: When 10.0 grams of silicon dust reacts with 100.0 grams of oxygen, O₂, to form silicon dioxide, SiO₂, how many grams of O₂ remain uncombined? The reaction equation is given as Si + O₂ → SiO₂.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with such problems, I should first write down the balanced chemical equation because stoichiometry relies on that.

The given equation is Si + O₂ → SiO₂. Let me balance it. Silicon is on the left, and oxygen is also on the left. On the product side, we have SiO₂.

So, for silicon, it's 1 on the left, so that's good. Oxygen is 2 in O₂, and in SiO₂, each molecule has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, so if I have one SiO₂ molecule, that's 2 O atoms. So, the balanced equation would be Si + O₂ → SiO₂.

Wait, but let me check the coefficients. Let's see, 1 Si atom, 2 O atoms in O₂ (so O₂ is 1 molecule), and SiO₂ has 1 Si and 2 O. So, the equation is balanced as is. So, the balanced equation is:

Si + O₂ → SiO₂

But wait, does that balance? Let me count the atoms. On the left: 1 Si, 2 O (from O₂). On the right: 1 Si and 2 O. So yes, it's balanced. So the mole ratio is 1:1 for Si to O₂, and 1:1 for O₂ to SiO₂.

Wait, no. Wait, wait a second. One mole of O₂ (which has 2 moles of O atoms) reacts with one mole of Si to produce one mole of SiO₂, which has 2 O atoms. So, the balanced equation is correct as written.

So, the next step is to determine the limiting reactant because that will tell me how much of each reactant is consumed and how much is left over.

I have 10.0 grams of Si and 100.0 grams of O₂. I'll need to convert these masses into moles to find out which is the limiting reactant.

The molar mass of Si is approximately 28.085 g/mol. Let me calculate the moles of Si:

Moles of Si = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / 28.085 g/mol ≈ 0.356 mol.

Now, the molar mass of O₂ is 32.00 g/mol (since O is 16.00, so O₂ is 32.00). So moles of O₂ = 100.0 g / 32.00 g/mol = 3.125 mol.

According to the balanced equation, the mole ratio of Si to O₂ is 1:1. That means each mole of Si requires one mole of O₂.

So, let's see how much O₂ is needed for all the Si to react. Since I have 0.356 mol of Si, I would need 0.356 mol of O₂.

But I have 3.125 mol of O₂ available, which is way more than needed. So, Si is the limiting reactant, and O₂ is in excess.

Now, when all the Si reacts, how much O₂ is consumed? It's 0.356 mol. So, the remaining O₂ will be the initial moles minus the consumed moles.

Moles of O₂ remaining = 3.125 mol - 0.356 mol = 2.769 mol.

Now, I need to convert this remaining moles of O₂ back into grams.

Mass of O₂ remaining = moles × molar mass = 2.769 mol × 32.00 g/mol ≈ 88.608 g.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 88.6. The closest option is B: 88.5 g. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should check my calculations again to see if I made any rounding errors.

Let me recalculate the moles of Si more accurately. The molar mass of Si is 28.085 g/mol.

Moles of Si = 10.0 / 28.085 = approximately 0.3561 mol.

Moles of O₂ needed = 0.3561 mol.

Moles of O₂ available = 100 / 32 = 3.125 mol.

Moles of O₂ left = 3.125 - 0.3561 = 2.7689 mol.

Mass of O₂ left = 2.7689 ×32 = let's compute that.

2.7689 × 32 = ?

Well, 2 ×32 =64, 0.7689 ×32 = 24.5928. So total is 64 +24.5928=88.5928 grams, which rounds to approximately 88.6 grams.

The options are:

A: 100 g

B: 88.5 g

C: 82.0 g

D: 92.5 g

E: 95.0 g

F: 80.0 g

G: 75.0 g

H: 91.5 g

I: 10.0 g

J: 85.5 g

So option B is 88.5 g, which is very close to our calculated 88.6 g. So I think B is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check if I considered everything correctly. Did I calculate the moles correctly? Yes, 10g Si is about 0.356 moles. O₂ is 100g, which is 3.125 moles. The reaction uses 0.356 moles of O₂, leaving 2.769 moles, which is 88.6 grams. So yes, B makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering significant figures, but the options match. So I think B is correct.

The balanced chemical equation is Si + O₂ → SiO₂, with a 1:1 molar ratio between Si and O₂. Converting the given masses to moles, 10.0 g of Si corresponds to approximately 0.356 mol, and 100.0 g of O₂ corresponds to 3.125 mol. Since Si is the limiting reactant, it requires 0.356 mol of O₂ to fully react. Subtracting this from the available O₂ leaves 2.769 mol of O₂ unreacted. Converting this back to grams gives approximately 88.6 g, which aligns with option B.

Answer: B
