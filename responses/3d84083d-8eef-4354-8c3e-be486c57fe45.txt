Question:

Which of the following is not a hypothesis for why hominids walked on two legs?

Options:

A: it expended less energy than quadrupedalism for going long distances
B: it freed the hands to carry things
C: it allowed hominids to see greater distances

E: it allowed for better heat regulation
F: it allowed for braincase expansion

Okay, so I have this question about why hominids started walking on two legs, and I need to figure out which option isn't a hypothesis for that. Let me think through each option one by one.

The question is asking which of the options A through F is not a hypothesis for bipedalism. So, I need to recall what I know about the different theories explaining the evolution of bipedalism in hominids.

Option A says it expended less energy than quadrupedalism for long distances. I remember reading that bipedal walking is more energy-efficient over long distances. So this is a valid hypothesis, probably the one from the energy expenditure theory.

Option B: it freed the hands to carry things. That makes sense too. Bipedalism would free up the hands for tool use, carrying food, babies, etc. So this is another valid theory.

Option C: it allowed hominids to see greater distances. Hmm, I think this is related to the idea that standing upright gives a better vantage point to spot predators or prey. So yes, this is a hypothesis I've heard before.

Option D: it provided a more intimidating posture to potential predators. Wait, that seems a bit odd. If hominids were prey, maybe a taller posture would make them seem larger and more intimidating to predators. But I'm not sure if this is a widely accepted hypothesis. I think the more common reasons are related to efficiency, freeing hands, and visibility. Maybe this is the one that's not a standard theory.

Option E: it allowed for better heat regulation. I think this relates to the idea that walking bipedally might reduce exposure to the sun, as standing upright can reduce the surface area exposed to the sun compared to quadrupedal animals. So this is another hypothesis, probably from the thermoregulation theory.

Option F: it allowed for braincase expansion. I'm pretty sure that as hominids' brains expanded, having an upright posture allowed the skull to develop in a way that accommodated larger brains. So this is a valid hypothesis, possibly linked to the increase in brain size and intelligence.

So, going back to the options, D is about intimidating predators. I'm trying to remember if this is a commonly cited reason. I think most theories focus on efficiency, carrying capacity, visibility, heat regulation, and brain size. Intimidation as a reason isn't something I recall being a major hypothesis in the study of bipedalism. So I think D is the one that's not a standard explanation, making it the correct answer to the question.

The question asks which option is not a hypothesis for why hominids started walking on two legs. After evaluating each option:

- **A**: Energy efficiency is a well-supported theory.
- **B**: Freeing hands for tool use is a valid hypothesis.
- **C**: Improved visibility is a known reason.
- **D**: Intimidating predators is not a widely accepted hypothesis.
- **E**: Thermoregulation is a recognized theory.
- **F**: Brain expansion is a valid explanation.

Thus, the answer is D.

D
