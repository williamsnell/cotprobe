Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about World War I and poison gas. The question says that 1.1 × 10^8 kg of phosgene gas was used, and I need to find out how many molecules that corresponds to. Hmm, phosgene is C0Cl2, right? Wait, wait, no, I think it's actually COCl2. Yeah, because I remember phosgene is used in chemical weapons and it's carbon, oxygen, and two chlorines. So the formula is COCl2.

Alright, so the problem is about converting kilograms of COCl2 into the number of molecules. I think I need to go through moles first because I remember that moles are the bridge between mass and molecules. So the plan is to convert kg to grams, then grams to moles using the molar mass, and then use Avogadro's number to get the number of molecules.

First, I'll convert kilograms to grams because molar masses are usually in grams per mole. 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 1.1 × 10^8 kg is 1.1 × 10^8 × 1000 grams. Let me calculate that. 1.1e8 * 1e3 = 1.1e11 grams. So that's 1.1 × 10^11 grams of phosgene.

Next, I need the molar mass of COCl2. Let's break it down: Carbon is about 12 g/mol, Oxygen is 16 g/mol, and Chlorine is about 35.5 g/mol each. So, 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 2*35.5 (Cl2). Let me add that up. 12 +16 is 28. Then 2 times 35.5 is 71. So 28 +71 is 99 g/mol. So the molar mass of COCl2 is 99 g/mol.

Now, to find the number of moles, I'll use the formula moles = mass / molar mass. The mass here is 1.1e11 grams, and the molar mass is 99 g/mol. So moles = 1.1e11 / 99. Let me compute that. Hmm, 1.1e11 divided by 99 is approximately 1.111e9 moles because 99 is about 100, so 1.1e11 / 100 is 1.1e9, and since 99 is 0.99 times 100, it's a little more, so around 1.111e9 moles.

Wait, let me be more precise. 1.1e11 divided by 99. Let's compute 1.1e11 / 99 = (1.1 / 99) × 1e11. 1.1 divided by 99 is approximately 0.011111... So 0.011111 × 1e11 is 1.1111e9 moles. So approximately 1.111e9 moles.

Now, to find the number of molecules, I'll multiply the number of moles by Avogadro's number, which is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So molecules = moles × Avogadro's number. That's 1.111e9 × 6.022e23.

Let me calculate that. 1.111e9 * 6.022e23 = (1.111 * 6.022) × 10^(9+23) = approximately 6.695 × 10^32 molecules.

Wait, let me check the math again. 1.1e8 kg is 1.1e11 grams. Divided by 99 g/mol gives about 1.111e9 moles. Multiply by 6.022e23 gives about 6.695e32. Looking at the options, option F is 6.6 × 10^32, which is very close. So I think that's the right answer.

Alternatively, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the molar mass. COCl2: C is 12, O is 16, Cl is 35.5 each. So 12 +16 = 28, plus 71 (2*35.5) gives 99. Yep, that's correct. So the moles part is correct.

Another way to double-check: 1.1e8 kg is 110,000,000 kg, which is 110,000,000,000 grams. Divided by 99 g/mol gives roughly 1,111,111,111.11 moles. Multiply by 6.022e23 gives 6.695e32, which rounds to 6.7e32, but the option is 6.6e32, so that's close enough, considering rounding during calculations.

To determine the number of molecules of phosgene (COCl₂) corresponding to 1.1 × 10⁸ kg, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert kilograms to grams**:  
   \( 1.1 \times 10^8 \, \text{kg} = 1.1 \times 10^{11} \, \text{g} \).

2. **Calculate the molar mass of COCl₂**:  
   - Carbon (C): \( 12 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
   - Oxygen (O): \( 16 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
   - Chlorine (Cl): \( 35.5 \, \text{g/mol} \times 2 = 71 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
   - Total molar mass: \( 12 + 16 + 71 = 99 \, \text{g/mol} \).

3. **Determine the number of moles**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{11} \, \text{g}}{99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.111 \times 10^9 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Convert moles to molecules using Avogadro's number**:  
   \[
   \text{Molecules} = \text{Moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} = 1.111 \times 10^9 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 6.695 \times 10^{32} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest answer is \( 6.6 \times 10^{32} \, \text{molecules} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
