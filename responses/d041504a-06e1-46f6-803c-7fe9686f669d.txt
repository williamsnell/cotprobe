Question:

An Aston Martin V8 Vantage sports car has a lateral acceleration of $0.96g = (0.96)(9.8 m / s^2) = 9.4 m / s^2$. This is the maximum centripetal acceleration the car can sustain without skidding out of a curved path. If the car is traveling at a constant 40m/s on level ground, what is the radius R of the tightest unbanked curve it can negotiate? (Unit: m))

Options:

A: 190
B: 150
C: 220
D: 200
E: 160
F: 180
G: 230
H: 170
I: 210
J: 140

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an Aston Martin V8 Vantage and its ability to take a tight curve without skidding. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on circular motion, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem states that the car has a lateral acceleration of 0.96g. I remember that g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s². So, multiplying 0.96 by 9.8 should give me the maximum centripetal acceleration the car can handle. Let me calculate that quickly: 0.96 * 9.8 = 9.4 m/s². Got it, so the centripetal acceleration a_c is 9.4 m/s².

The car is traveling at a constant speed of 40 m/s on level ground. The question is asking for the radius R of the tightest unbanked curve it can negotiate. Hmm, unbanked means that the road isn't tilted, so the only force providing the centripetal acceleration must be the friction between the tires and the road.

I recall the formula for centripetal acceleration: a_c = v² / R, where v is the velocity and R is the radius of the circular path. Since I'm looking for R, I can rearrange this formula to solve for R. So, R = v² / a_c.

Let me plug in the numbers. The velocity v is 40 m/s, and a_c is 9.4 m/s². Calculating v squared first: 40 * 40 = 1600 m²/s². Now, divide that by 9.4. Let me do that division. 1600 divided by 9.4... Hmm, 9.4 times 170 is 1598, which is very close to 1600. So, 1600 / 9.4 ≈ 169.15. Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 140-230 range, and 169 is around option H (170). But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 9.4 times 170 is indeed 1598, so 170 is roughly the value. But wait, isn't the formula correct? Centripetal acceleration is v²/R, so R = v²/a_c. Oh, wait, no, that seems right. Let me confirm: if a_c is higher, R would be smaller because the car can take a tighter turn. Since a_c is 9.4, which is quite high, R would be smaller.

Wait a second, 40 squared is 1600. Divided by 9.4. Let me calculate it more accurately. 1600 divided by 9.4:

9.4 * 170 = 1598, as I did before. So 1600 - 1598 = 2. So, 1600 /9.4 = 170 + 2/9.4 ≈ 170.21. So approximately 170.21 meters. Looking at the options, H is 170. That seems to fit.

Wait, but the options are A through J, and H is 170. So that would be the answer, right? Let me make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Centripetal acceleration formula is correct. Velocity is given, acceleration is given, solving for radius.

Another way to think about it: if the maximum acceleration is higher, the radius can be smaller for the same speed. In this case, 9.4 m/s² is the max, which allows a smaller R. So with v=40, R=170. That seems correct. So the answer should be H: 170.

To determine the radius \( R \) of the tightest unbanked curve the Aston Martin can negotiate, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[
a_c = \frac{v^2}{R}
\]

Rearranging for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{v^2}{a_c}
\]

Given:
- \( v = 40 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( a_c = 0.96g = 0.96 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 9.4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

Substituting the values:

\[
R = \frac{40^2}{9.4} = \frac{1600}{9.4} \approx 170.21 \, \text{m}
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is \( 170 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
