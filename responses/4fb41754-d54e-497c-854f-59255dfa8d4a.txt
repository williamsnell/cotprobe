Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find a recursive sequence y[n]. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem states that y[1] is 3, y[0] is 2, and for n >= 2, the recurrence relation is y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 0. I need to find the sequence y[n] using this relation and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that solving linear recurrence relations involves finding the characteristic equation. Let me recall how that works. For a homogeneous linear recurrence relation like this one, the equation is y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 0. The characteristic equation would be r² - 3r + 2 = 0. 

So, solving that quadratic equation: r² -3r +2 = 0. Let me factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 2 and add up to -3. Oh, that's -1 and -2. So, (r -1)(r -2) = 0. Therefore, the roots are r = 1 and r = 2.

Since the roots are real and distinct, the general solution of the recurrence relation should be y[n] = A*(1)^n + B*(2)^n, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.

Wait, the initial conditions are given as y[0] = 2 and y[1] = 3. So I can plug in n=0 and n=1 to find A and B.

When n=0: y[0] = A*(1)^0 + B*(2)^0 = A + B = 2.

When n=1: y[1] = A*(1)^1 + B*(2)^1 = A + 2B = 3.

So I have two equations:

1) A + B = 2
2) A + 2B = 3

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2. That gives (A + 2B) - (A + B) = 3 - 2 → B = 1.

Substituting B = 1 into equation 1: A +1 = 2 → A = 1.

So the general solution is y[n] = 1*(1)^n + 1*(2)^n. Simplifying, y[n] = 1 + 2^n.

Wait, let me check that. For n=0: 1 + 2^0 = 1 +1 = 2, which matches y[0]=2. For n=1: 1 +2^1=1+2=3, which matches y[1]=3. Good so far.

Now, let's compute y[2], y[3], etc., to see what the sequence looks like beyond n=1.

y[2] = 1 +2^2 =1 +4=5.

y[3] =1 +2^3=1+8=9.

y[4]=1+16=17.

So the sequence starts as y[0]=2, y[1]=3, y[2]=5, y[3]=9, y[4]=17, etc.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: y[n] =5,9,15,... so starting from n=2, the terms are 5,9,15. Hmm, but y[4] is 17, not 15. So that doesn't match.

Option B: y[n]=5,9,17,... So for n=2, it's 5; n=3,9; n=4,17. That matches y[2]=5, y[3]=9, y[4]=17. So option B seems correct.

Option C: y[n]=2,5,9,... So starting from n=0, it's 2,5,9. But our sequence at n=0 is 2, n=1 is 3, which doesn't fit. So C is out.

Option D: y[n]=3,5,9,... So n=1 is 3, n=2 is5, which matches, but n=3 is9. Let me check: according to my solution, y[3]=9, so that's correct. But D's sequence starts at n=1, but the initial terms y[0]=2 is not part of that. Wait, the question says the options start from n>=2, so maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are phrased as y[n] = ... starting from n >=2. So for example, option A is for n >=2: 5,9,15,... So for n=2, it's 5; n=3,9; n=4,15. But according to our solution, y[4]=17, which doesn't match 15. So option A is wrong.

Option B: y[n]=5,9,17,... So n=2 is 5, n=3 is9, n=4 is17. That's exactly what our solution gives. So option B is correct.

Wait, but I thought the general solution is y[n]=1+2^n. Let me compute y[2]=1+4=5, y[3]=1+8=9, y[4]=1+16=17. Yep, that's correct.

So the sequence for n>=2 would be 5,9,17,... which is option B.

The problem involves solving a linear recurrence relation with initial conditions. The recurrence relation is y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 0 for n ≥ 2, with y[0] = 2 and y[1] = 3. 

The characteristic equation is r² - 3r + 2 = 0, which factors to (r-1)(r-2) = 0, giving roots r = 1 and r = 2. The general solution is y[n] = A(1)^n + B(2)^n. Using the initial conditions, we find A = 1 and B = 1, leading to y[n] = 1 + 2^n. 

Calculating the terms for n ≥ 2, we get y[2] = 5, y[3] = 9, y[4] = 17, etc. Comparing with the options, option B matches the sequence 5, 9, 17,...

Answer: B
