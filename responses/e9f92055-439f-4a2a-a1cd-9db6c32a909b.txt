Okay, so I've got this question about why the exodus of human resources from farming might be stopping. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is asking for the main reasons, and the options are A to E.

First, I need to understand what the exodus from farming means. It probably refers to people leaving the agricultural sector to find jobs elsewhere, maybe in cities or other industries. So, the question is why this movement might be slowing down or ending.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Low farm population, declining agricultural productivity growth, increased agricultural demand. Wait, that seems a bit conflicting. If the farm population is low, maybe fewer people are available, but if productivity is declining, that might make farming less attractive. However, increased agricultural demand could mean more need for workers, so maybe that's a reason people would stay or return.

Option B: Lack of jobs in industries. If industries aren't providing jobs, people might not have a reason to leave farming. So, if other sectors aren't hiring, maybe they stay in farming, which could end the exodus. That makes sense.

Option C: Climate change creating new farming opportunities. Climate change can affect farming in various ways. Maybe new regions become arable or new crops can be grown, which might attract people back to farming. That could be a reason, but I'm not sure how directly it affects the exodus.

Option D: Mandatory agricultural service policies. If the government enforces people to work in agriculture, that would definitely stop the exodus. But I'm not sure how common these policies are or if they're a main reason.

Option E: Decrease in urban living standards. If cities are becoming less appealing, people might move back to rural areas. If urban areas are worse in terms of quality of life, jobs, etc., then farming might become a more viable option again, stopping the exodus. That seems possible.

So, the main reasons would likely involve factors that make farming more attractive or other sectors less attractive. Let's think about each option.

Option B suggests that if industries aren't providing jobs, people won't leave farming. That makes sense because if there's nowhere else to go, they stay. Similarly, Option E, if urban areas are worse, people might prefer to stay in farming.

Option A has a mix: low farm population could mean fewer people, but if agricultural demand is up, maybe more people are needed. Declining productivity growth might not be a good reason to stay, so maybe A isn't the best.

Option C's climate change could create new opportunities, but I'm not sure if that's a main reason for the exodus stopping. It might be a factor, but perhaps not the primary one.

Option D, mandatory policies, seems more like a government action which might not be the main reason on its own.

So, considering the options, the main reasons are probably B and E. But the question is about enumerating the main reasons, so looking at the options, the correct one must be the best fit.

Wait, the question is about why the exodus is coming to an end, so factors that cause people to stay in farming or not leave anymore.

Option B: If industries don't have jobs, people can't leave farming, so the exodus stops. That seems correct.

Option E: If urban areas are worse, maybe people leave cities and go back to farming, reversing the exodus.

But the question is about the exodus coming to an end, meaning it's stopping, not necessarily reversing.

So, if industries lack jobs, people can't leave farming, so the outflow stops. That's B.

Alternatively, if urban living standards are decreasing, people might leave cities and go back to farming, which could end the exodus. So E could also be a reason.

But looking back at the options, the correct answer is probably B, because lack of jobs elsewhere would prevent people from leaving farming, thus ending the exodus. Alternatively, if urban areas become less desirable, people might return, but that's more of a reversal.

Wait, the question is about why the exodus is ending, not necessarily reversing. So if industries aren't offering jobs, people can't leave, so the exodus stops. That seems more direct.

But the options are given, and I need to choose the best one. The options are:

A: Low farm population, declining productivity, increased demand.

B: Lack of jobs in industries.

C: Climate change.

D: Mandatory policies.

E: Decrease in urban living standards.

So, the correct answer is B, because if there are no jobs in industries, people won't leave farming. That makes the exodus end.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The exodus is people leaving farming. If industries can't offer jobs, they can't leave, so the exodus stops. That's B.

Alternatively, if urban areas are worse, people might leave cities and go back, but that's more of a reverse migration. The question is about the exodus ending, so B seems more about preventing people from leaving, whereas E is about people returning.

So, the main reason would be B.

The exodus of human resources from farming may be coming to an end due to several factors. Among the options provided, the most plausible reason is **B: Lack of jobs in industries**. If industries are not providing sufficient employment opportunities, people are less likely to leave farming. This lack of alternative job options effectively prevents the outflow of labor from agriculture, leading to the slowing or cessation of the exodus. Other factors, such as urban living standards or climate change, may influence migration patterns but are less directly tied to the end of the exodus compared to the availability of jobs in other sectors.

**Answer: B**
