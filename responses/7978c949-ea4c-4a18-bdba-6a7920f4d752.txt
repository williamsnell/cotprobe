Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the markings on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol. I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Huaca del Sol is one of those ancient Peruvian sites, right? It's a big temple or something, probably built by the Moche or another pre-Columbian culture. The question is about the markings on the mud-bricks there.

The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says the markings are instructions for the builders by engineers. Hmm, that sounds plausible. In many ancient cultures, they did have engineers or master builders who would plan and oversee construction. But would they write instructions directly on the bricks? I'm not sure. Maybe they used other methods, like oral instructions or markings on plans. Also, mud-bricks are usually made in molds, so maybe the markings aren't for instructions but something else.

Option B suggests they're random scratches with no meaning. That could be possible, but I feel like ancient cultures often had some form of writing or symbols. The Moche, for example, had a system of knotted strings called quipus for record-keeping, but I'm not sure if they wrote on bricks. Maybe the scratches aren't meaningful, but I'm leaning against this answer because it feels too dismissive.

Option C says the markings are to identify the local group that made them. That makes sense. Many ancient structures have inscriptions or symbols to show who built them. For instance, in Egyptian pyramids, they have cartouches with the pharaoh's name. Similarly, the Moche might have used these markings to indicate which group or team made the bricks, perhaps for record-keeping or to claim their work. This seems reasonable.

Option D is about simple arithmetic by carpenters. Carpentry would involve measuring and numbers, but mud-bricks are more about masonry. Also, if it's arithmetic, were they using a written system for that? The Moche had a base-60 numbering system, I think, but I'm not sure if they wrote numbers on bricks. Plus, why would carpenters be marking bricks? Maybe it's more about the builders or the workers.

So, putting it together: A is possible but maybe less likely. B seems too negative. C sounds plausible because it's about identifying the group, which is a common practice. D is about a specific group (carpenters) and arithmetic, which I'm not sure about. Therefore, I think the answer is C.

The markings on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol are likely intended to identify the local group that produced them, as this is a common practice in ancient cultures for record-keeping and claiming work.

Answer: C
