Okay, so I've got this question about the half-life of radon. The half-life is given as 3.80 days, and the question is asking after how many days only one-sixteenth of the sample will remain. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. So each half-life, the amount is reduced by half. The question is about when only 1/16th remains. That means the sample has gone through several half-lives.

Let me visualize this. Starting with 100% of the sample, after one half-life (3.8 days), it's 50%. After two half-lives (7.6 days), it's 25%. Three half-lives would be 12.9 days, and the remaining would be 12.5%. Wait, but 1/16 is 6.25%, right? So that's even less than 12.5%. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think in terms of exponents. The formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial, t is time, and T is the half-life.

We want N/N0 = 1/16. So setting up the equation: 1/16 = (1/2)^(t / 3.8). Let me take the logarithm of both sides to solve for t. Since the base is 1/2, I can use log base 1/2, or convert it using natural log.

Alternatively, I know that 1/16 is the same as (1/2)^4, because (1/2)^4 = 1/16. So that means (1/2)^(t/3.8) = (1/2)^4. Therefore, the exponents must be equal. So t/3.8 = 4. Solving for t gives t = 4 * 3.8 = 15.2 days.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because 4 half-lives would reduce the sample to 1/16th. Let's see: after 1 half-life, 1/2 remains; after 2, 1/4; after 3, 1/8; after 4, 1/16. Yep, that makes sense. So t should be 4 half-lives multiplied by the half-life period.

So 4 * 3.8 days is 15.2 days. Looking at the options, H is 15.2 days. So that should be the correct answer.

The half-life of radon is 3.80 days. To determine when only one-sixteenth (1/16) of the sample remains, we use the formula for radioactive decay: 

\[
\frac{N}{N_0} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / T}
\]

Here, \( \frac{N}{N_0} = \frac{1}{16} \) and \( T = 3.80 \) days. Since \( \frac{1}{16} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 \), we equate the exponents:

\[
\frac{t}{3.80} = 4 \implies t = 4 \times 3.80 = 15.2 \text{ days}.
\]

Thus, after 15.2 days, one-sixteenth of the radon sample will remain.
