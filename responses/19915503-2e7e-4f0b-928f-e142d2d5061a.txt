Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Marguerite has taken several spelling tests before, and on all of them, she scored between 75 and 89. Now, she scored a perfect 100 on her next test. The question is asking which of the given statements is true regarding her test scores.

First, let's understand what each statistical term means here: median, mode, mean, and range. I think I remember that the median is the middle value when all numbers are arranged in order, the mode is the most frequent number, the mean is the average, and the range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores.

So, let's break down each part. Marguerite's previous scores are all between 75 and 89. Let's assume she has taken 'n' tests before. Now she's taken one more, so total tests are 'n+1'.

Let me consider each option one by one.

Option A: The median will decrease. Hmm. If she adds a higher score, the median could stay the same or increase, not decrease. Because adding a higher number might push the middle value up if the new number is higher than the current median. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: The mode will decrease. Mode is the most frequent score. If all her previous scores are between 75-89, and the new score is 100, unless one of the scores was 100 before, the mode might stay the same or change if 100 becomes the new mode. But since her previous scores don't include 100, adding one 100 won't make it the mode unless all her previous scores were the same, which isn't stated. So maybe mode stays the same or could change, but I'm not sure. Let's keep this in mind.

Option C: The median will remain the same. Wait, adding a higher score might affect the median. Let's think about an example. Suppose she had scores like 75, 80, 85, 89. So median is (80+85)/2 = 82.5. If she adds 100, the new scores are 75,80,85,89,100. Median is now 85. So the median increased. So in this case, C is not correct.

Option D: The mean will increase. Mean is the average. Adding a higher number than the previous average should increase the mean. Let's see. Suppose her previous average was, say, 82. Adding 100 would make the new average higher because 100 is significantly higher than 82. So D could be correct.

Option E: The range will decrease. Range is max - min. Her previous range was between 75 and 89, so 14. Now, adding 100, the new max is 100, min is still 75, so range becomes 25. That's an increase, not decrease. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The mean will decrease. No, because adding a higher score would likely increase the mean. So F is wrong.

Option G: The mean will remain the same. No, because adding a higher number will change the average. So G is wrong.

Option H: The mode will increase. Mode depends on frequency. If all her previous scores were unique, adding 100 won't change the mode. But if one of her previous scores was the mode, say 85 appeared twice, then adding 100 once won't change the mode. So mode might stay the same or possibly change if 100 becomes the most frequent, but since she only added one 100, it's unlikely unless she had all unique scores before. So H is probably incorrect.

Wait, but in the initial problem, it's stated that she earned a score of 100 on her next test. So her previous scores are all between 75-89, and the new score is 100. So the mode could stay the same if her previous mode was, say, 85, and adding 100 once doesn't change it. Alternatively, if all her previous scores were unique, then the mode might not exist, or all are modes. But in any case, adding one 100 wouldn't increase the mode; it might create a new mode if 100 becomes the most frequent, but since it's only one, it's unlikely.

So, looking back, the correct options are D, because adding a higher number (100) would increase the mean. Let me confirm with an example.

Suppose she had two tests before: 80 and 85. Mean is (80+85)/2 = 82.5. Adding 100: (80+85+100)/3 = 265/3 â‰ˆ 88.33, which is higher than 82.5. So mean increases. So D is correct.

Another example: three tests, all 80. Mean is 80. Adding 100: (80+80+80+100)/4 = 340/4 = 85, which is higher. So yes, mean increases.

So the correct answer is D: The mean will increase.

The correct answer is D: The mean will increase.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding the problem**: Marguerite's previous scores are between 75 and 89, and she scored 100 on her next test. We need to determine how this affects the median, mode, mean, and range.

2. **Analyzing each option**:
   - **Median**: Adding a higher score (100) can increase the median, not decrease it. Hence, options A and C are incorrect.
   - **Mode**: The mode depends on frequency. Adding one 100 won't change the mode unless it becomes the most frequent, which is unlikely. Thus, options B and H are incorrect.
   - **Mean**: Adding a higher score (100) will increase the average (mean). Therefore, option D is correct.
   - **Range**: Adding 100 increases the range from (89-75)=14 to (100-75)=25. Hence, option E is incorrect.
   - **Mean decrease (F) and remain same (G)**: Adding a higher score cannot decrease or keep the mean the same. Thus, F and G are incorrect.

3. **Conclusion**: The mean will increase due to the addition of a higher score (100).
