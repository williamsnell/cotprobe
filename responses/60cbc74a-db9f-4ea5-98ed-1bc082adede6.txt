Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the change in enthalpy when 100 grams of water goes from ice at -10°C to liquid water at +15°C. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that enthalpy change involves considering both the heat required to change temperature and the heat involved in phase changes. So, for ice turning into water, there are a few steps involved: warming the ice from -10°C to 0°C, then melting the ice into water, and finally warming the liquid water from 0°C to 15°C.

Wait, but the problem says 100 grams of H2O. Oh right, I should convert that to moles because the heat capacities and heat of fusion are given per mole. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so 100 g divided by 18 g/mol is approximately 5.556 moles.

Now, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C.** The heat required for this is calculated using the heat capacity of ice. Looking at the table, the heat capacity for H2O(s) at 239 K (which is about -34°C) is 33.30 J/mol·K. But wait, the temperature here is -10°C, which is 263 K. The table has an entry for H2O(s) at 271 K (0°C) with a heat capacity of 37.78 J/mol·K. Hmm, maybe I should use the value at 239 K since -10°C is between 239 K and 271 K? Or perhaps the problem expects us to use the given values and interpolate if necessary. Wait, the problem provides specific data points. Let me check the temperatures. The first entry is H2O(s) at 239 K (which is about -34°C) with 33.30 J/mol·K. The next is at 271 K (0°C) with 37.78 J/mol·K. So, the ice is at -10°C, which is 263 K. Since 263 K is between 239 K and 271 K, I might need to interpolate the heat capacity at that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the closest value, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the heat capacity of ice is considered constant over this range, but I don't think so. Wait, the problem gives specific data, so I should probably use the one at 239 K because that's the closest lower point, or perhaps it's acceptable to use the average? Hmm, maybe I can just use 33.30 J/mol·K as the heat capacity for the ice since it's the one provided for 239 K, and -10°C is closer to 0°C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the value at 271 K for the melting point, but since the ice is at a lower temperature, perhaps 239 K's value is more appropriate. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The temperature of the ice is -10°C (263 K), so between 239 K and 271 K. The heat capacities are given as 33.30 at 239 K and 37.78 at 271 K. So, perhaps I should interpolate between these two values. The difference between 239 K and 271 K is 32 K. The temperature we're at is 263 K, which is 24 K above 239 K. So the fraction is 24/32 = 3/4. So the heat capacity would be 33.30 + (3/4)*(37.78 -33.30) = 33.30 + (3/4)*(4.48) ≈ 33.30 + 3.36 = 36.66 J/mol·K. But wait, this might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the value at 271 K (37.78 J/mol·K) since that's the melting point, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem just expects using 33.30 J/mol·K as given for 239 K. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with 33.30 J/mol·K for this step.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require interpolation, but just uses the given values at the temperatures. Let me check the data again. The problem says to use data from the table. The table has H2O(s) at 239 K (33.30) and 271 K (37.78). So perhaps the problem expects me to use the value at 239 K, as that's the closest lower temperature, and just proceed with that.

So, the temperature change for the ice is from -10°C (263 K) to 0°C (273 K). Wait no, wait: 0°C is 273 K. Wait, but wait, from -10°C to 0°C is a temperature change of 10 degrees. So the heat required to warm the ice is q1 = n * C_ice * ΔT. So n is 5.556 mol, C_ice is 33.30 J/mol·K, and ΔT is 10°C (which is 10 K). So q1 = 5.556 * 33.30 * 10 = let's calculate that. 5.556 * 33.30 ≈ 5.556*33.3 ≈ let's see, 5 *33.3=166.5, 0.556*33.3≈18.55, so total ≈185.05 J/mol. Multiply by 10 K: 185.05 *10 = 1850.5 J? Wait, no, wait: 5.556 *33.30 = let me compute that more accurately. 5 *33.30 = 166.5, 0.556 *33.30 ≈18.55, so total ≈185.05 J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹ * 10 K = 1850.5 J? Wait, no, wait: 5.556 * 33.30 = approximately 5.556 *33.3 = let's compute 5 * 33.3 = 166.5, 0.556 *33.3 ≈18.54, so total ≈185.04 J/mol. Then multiply by 10 K: 185.04 *10 = 1850.4 J. So q1 ≈ 1850 J.

Wait, but if I used the interpolated value of 36.66 J/mol·K, then q1 = 5.556 *36.66 *10 ≈ let's compute: 5 *36.66=183.3, 0.556*36.66≈20.37, so total ≈203.67 J/mol. Multiply by 10: 2036.7 J. Hmm, but I'm not sure if interpolation is required. The problem might expect using the given value at 239 K, which is 33.30. But perhaps the problem expects using 37.78 J/mol·K? Because the ice is melting at 0°C, perhaps the problem considers the heat capacity of ice as 37.78 J/mol·K, but that's the value at 271 K. Or maybe it's given as an average? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the heat capacity is 37.78 J/mol·K for the entire ice warming process. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't really require considering the change in heat capacity with temperature, and just uses the value at 239 K. Well, I'll proceed with the given value at 239 K, which is 33.30 J/mol·K, for the ice warming step.

Next step: **Melting the ice at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C.** The heat of fusion is given as 6.02 kJ/mol. Since we're dealing with 5.556 moles, the heat required is q2 = n * ΔH_fusion. So 5.556 mol * 6.02 kJ/mol = let's calculate that. 5 *6.02=30.1, 0.556*6.02≈3.345, so total ≈33.445 kJ, which is 33,445 J.

Wait, but wait, the ΔH_fusion is given as 6.02 kJ. So 5.556 mol *6.02 kJ/mol = 5.556*6.02. Let me compute that accurately: 5*6.02=30.1, 0.556*6.02≈3.345, so total ≈33.445 kJ, which is 33,445 J.

Then, **heating the liquid water from 0°C to 15°C.** The heat capacity of liquid water is given in the table. Looking at the options, the entries are for H2O(l) at 273 K (0°C) with 75.86 J/mol·K, and at 298 K (25°C) with 75.23 J/mol·K. Wait, but 15°C is 288 K. So the heat capacity might change slightly, but the problem gives data at 273 K and 298 K. Since 15°C is between 0°C and 25°C, perhaps I should average the two values, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the value at 273 K since that's the starting point. Alternatively, perhaps the heat capacity is considered constant over this range, so we can use the value at 273 K, which is 75.86 J/mol·K.

Wait, the problem gives H2O(l) at 273 K as 75.86, and at 298 K as 75.23. So, perhaps the heat capacity decreases slightly, but the change is minimal. For the purposes of this problem, perhaps using the value at 273 K is acceptable.

So, the temperature change is from 0°C to 15°C, which is 15 K. So q3 = n * C_water * ΔT = 5.556 mol *75.86 J/mol·K *15 K.

Let me compute that:

First, 5.556 *75.86 ≈ let's approximate. 5 *75.86 = 379.3, 0.556 *75.86 ≈42.14, so total ≈379.3 +42.14=421.44 J/mol·K. Then multiply by 15 K: 421.44 *15 ≈6321.6 J.

Alternatively, perhaps more accurately:

5.556 *75.86 = let me compute it properly.

5 *75.86 = 379.3
0.556 *75.86 = let's compute 0.5*75.86=37.93, 0.05*75.86=3.793, 0.006*75.86≈0.455. So total 37.93 +3.793=41.723 +0.455=42.178. So total 379.3 +42.178=421.478 J/mol·K. Multiply by 15: 421.478 *15=6322.17 J.

So q3≈6322 J.

Now, summing all three steps:

q1 (warming ice) = ~1850 J
q2 (melting ice) = ~33,445 J
q3 (warming water) = ~6322 J

Total enthalpy change ΔH = q1 + q2 + q3 = 1850 + 33445 + 6322 = let's add them up.

1850 +33445 = 35,295. Then 35,295 +6322=41,617 J. So approximately 41,617 J, which is about 41,600 J.

Looking at the options, option H is 41,800 J. That's very close. So the answer would be H.

But wait, let me double-check my steps, especially the heat capacities and calculations.

Wait, in the first step, when I calculated q1, I used 33.30 J/mol·K. But earlier I thought about whether I should use the interpolated value of 36.66 J/mol·K. Let me see what would happen if I used that.

If C_ice =36.66 J/mol·K, then q1=5.556 *36.66 *10 = let's compute: 5.556 *36.66 = approx. 5 *36.66=183.3, 0.556*36.66≈20.37, total ≈203.67 J/mol·K. Multiply by 10 K: 2036.7 J.

Then q1=2036.7 J.

q2 remains 33,445 J.

q3 remains 6322 J.

Total ΔH=2036.7 +33445 +6322 = 2036.7+33445=35481.7 +6322=41803.7 J, which is about 41,804 J. That's exactly option H:41,800 J.

Ah, so that's probably the correct approach. So the initial assumption to interpolate the heat capacity of ice gives a result matching option H.

So the correct answer is H:41,800 J.

To calculate the enthalpy change for 100 g of water going from ice at -10°C to liquid water at +15°C, the process involves three steps: warming the ice, melting it, and then warming the liquid water. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Warming the ice from -10°C to 0°C**:  
   The heat capacity of ice at 239 K (-34°C) is given as 33.30 J/mol·K. Since -10°C (263 K) is between 239 K and 271 K, the heat capacity is interpolated to 36.66 J/mol·K.  
   - Moles of water = \( \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.556 \) mol.  
   - Heat required: \( q_1 = n \cdot C_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T = 5.556 \cdot 36.66 \cdot 10 \approx 2036.7 \, \text{J} \).

2. **Melting the ice at 0°C**:  
   The molar heat of fusion is 6.02 kJ/mol.  
   - Heat required: \( q_2 = n \cdot \Delta H_{\text{fusion}} = 5.556 \cdot 6.02 \, \text{kJ} \approx 33.445 \, \text{kJ} = 33,445 \, \text{J} \).

3. **Warming the liquid water from 0°C to 15°C**:  
   The heat capacity of liquid water at 273 K (0°C) is 75.86 J/mol·K.  
   - Heat required: \( q_3 = n \cdot C_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T = 5.556 \cdot 75.86 \cdot 15 \approx 6322 \, \text{J} \).

4. **Total enthalpy change**:  
   \( \Delta H = q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 2036.7 + 33,445 + 6322 \approx 41,804 \, \text{J} \), which rounds to 41,800 J.

Thus, the closest option is **H: 41,800 J**.

Answer: H
