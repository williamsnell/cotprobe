Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when menarche occurs. I remember that menarche is the term for when a girl gets her first menstrual period. The question is asking about the age when this typically happens. The options given are A through J, so I need to pick the correct one.

First, I recall that menarche is a part of puberty in females. From what I've learned, the average age for a girl to start menstruating is around 12-13 years old. But I'm not 100% sure if it's exactly 12. I think it can vary, but 12 is often cited as the typical age.

Looking at the options, I see that some mention males, but wait, menarche specifically refers to females. So any option that includes males might be incorrect because males have a different term for the onset of puberty, which is more related to the first ejaculation or the appearance of facial hair, I think. So options A, C, H, J include males, which might be wrong.

Now, focusing on options that are about females only. Option F says 12 in females only. Option G is 10 in females only. I'm pretty sure it's around 12, not 10, because 10 seems too young. I think 10 might be more like the onset of breast development, but menarche is usually a bit later.

Option D says 12 in both sexes, but that can't be right because males and females have different onset times. Option I says 14 in females only, which is a bit older than I remember. So probably not I.

So narrowing down, the correct answer should be around 12 for females. Looking again, option F is 12 in females only, which seems right. But wait, option H says 12 in males and 14 in females. No, because menarche is only in females.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Menarche is the first period for girls, so it's about females. So the correct option should be either F or G or I. Since I think it's around 12, F is 12 in females only. But I've also heard that sometimes it's a bit earlier, like 11 or 12. So 12 is a common average.

Wait, another thought: some sources might say it's around 12-13, so 12 is a good average. Therefore, the correct answer should be F: 12 in females only. But wait, I'm seeing option G is 10 in females only. That seems too early. Maybe in some cases, but the average is 12.

So I think the correct answer is F: 12 in females only.
