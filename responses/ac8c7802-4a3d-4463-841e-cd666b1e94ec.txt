Question:

The sex of a child is dictated by the inheritance of:

Options:

A: a single Y chromosome from the mother.
B: a single Y chromosome from the mother or father.
C: a single X chromosome from the father.
D: a recessive allele on the X chromosome.
E: a single Y chromosome from the father.
F: a single X chromosome from the mother.
G: both X and Y chromosomes from the father.
H: the number of Y chromosomes from the mother.

Okay, so I have this question about how the sex of a child is determined through inheritance. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what dictates the sex of a child. The options are A to J. Let me go through each option and see which makes sense.

First, I remember that in humans, sex is determined by the sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y (XY). So the Y chromosome determines maleness.

Now, where does the Y come into play? I think it's the father who contributes either an X or a Y. Because the mother always gives an X, since she has two X's. So the sex is determined by what the father givesâ€”either X (which would make it XX, female) or Y (XY, male).

Looking at the options:

Option E says a single Y chromosome from the father. That makes sense because the father's sperm can carry either X or Y. If it's Y, the child is male.

Option A says Y from the mother. No, because mothers don't have Y chromosomes. They can only give X.

Option B is Y from either parent. But the mother can't give Y, so this is incorrect.

Option C: single X from father. That would mean the father gives an X, so the child is XX, which is female. But that's not the determining factor for sex; it's more about whether it's X or Y.

Option D: recessive allele on X. I'm not sure, but I think this is more about traits that are carried on the X, like color blindness, not about sex determination.

Option F: X from mother. Well, the mother always gives X, but that alone doesn't determine the sex. It's the father's contribution that decides.

Option G: both X and Y from father. No, because the father gives either X or Y, not both.

Option H: number of Y from mother. Again, the mother can't give Y.

Option I: dominant allele on X. Maybe for some traits, but not for sex determination.

Option J: number of X from mother. Well, females have two X, but the mother contributes one, and the father contributes the other. But again, this isn't about sex determination.

So the key is that the father's sperm determines the sex by giving either X or Y. The Y from the father makes the child male. So the correct answer should be E: a single Y chromosome from the father.

The sex of a child is determined by the inheritance of a single Y chromosome from the father. 

Answer: E
