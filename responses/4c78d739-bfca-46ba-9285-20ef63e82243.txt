Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who's experiencing some neurological symptoms. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The patient is a 64-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. His symptoms include progressive numbness in his hands and feet and weakness in his legs when he stands. He's been through chemotherapy, specifically his third course was four weeks ago. The physical exam shows areflexia, which means he doesn't have any reflexes, which is a sign of possible nerve damage.

So, the question is asking which drug is most likely causing these adverse effects. The options are A: Doxorubicin, B: Fluorouracil, C: Methotrexate, D: Vincristine.

First, I should recall the common side effects of each of these chemotherapy drugs, especially focusing on neurotoxicity because the symptoms here seem to point towards nerve damage.

Starting with Doxorubicin (Option A). I remember that Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic. Its main side effects include cardiotoxicity, which can lead to heart issues, especially with cumulative doses. It can also cause bone marrow suppression and maybe some gastrointestinal issues. But I don't recall it being particularly known for neuropathy. So maybe not A.

Next, Fluorouracil (Option B). Fluorouracil is a fluoropyrimidine used in chemotherapy. It's commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects, like mouth sores, nausea, and vomiting. It can also cause bone marrow suppression, but I don't think it's a major cause of neuropathy. So B might not be the right answer.

Methotrexate (Option C). Methotrexate is a folate antagonist, often used in various cancers and also in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Its side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, mouth sores, and sometimes gastrointestinal issues. I'm not sure if methotrexate is linked to significant neurotoxicity. It's more known for other organ toxicities, so maybe C isn't the cause here.

Vincristine (Option D). Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid, part of the plant Vinca rosea. It's known for its specific side effects, particularly neurotoxicity. The vinca alkaloids are known to cause peripheral neuropathy, which presents as numbness, tingling, weakness, and loss of reflexes, especially in the extremities. Since the patient has areflexia and numbness in hands and feet, this sounds like a classic presentation of vincristine-induced neuropathy.

Putting it all together, the symptoms described—numbness, weakness, areflexia—are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which is a well-known side effect of vincristine. So the most likely answer is D: Vincristine.

The patient's symptoms of numbness, weakness, and areflexia are indicative of peripheral neuropathy. Among the listed chemotherapy drugs, vincristine is known for causing neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the most likely cause of these adverse effects is:

D: Vincristine

**Answer:** D
