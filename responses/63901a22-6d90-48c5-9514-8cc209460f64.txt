Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the additional terms proposed in an acceptance between merchants. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking what is NOT true about these additional terms. So I need to find the option that's incorrect regarding when they become part of the contract.

First, I remember from my studies that when a merchant makes an offer, and another merchant accepts but adds some terms, these additional terms are treated differently than in non-merchant cases. Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), merchants can introduce additional terms in their acceptances, and those terms can become part of the contract unless certain conditions are met.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they become part of the contract only if both parties are merchants. I think that's correct because the UCC applies to merchants, and additional terms are allowed in their acceptances. So if both are merchants, the additional terms can be part of the contract. So A is true, which means it's not the answer because the question is about what's not true.

Option B: They become part of the contract only if the offeree does not object within a reasonable time. Wait, the offeree is the one accepting. So if the offeree adds terms, the offeror might object. I think the rule is that if the offeror objects within a reasonable time, the additional terms don't become part of the contract. So B seems to have it backwards. It says the terms become part if the offeree doesn't object, which would mean they're included unless the offeree objects. But I think it's the offeror's objection that matters. So B might be incorrect.

Option C: They become part only if the offeree agrees within a reasonable time. Hmm, no, because the offeree is the one accepting with the additional terms. The offeror can agree or object. So I'm not sure about C yet. Maybe it's about mutual agreement, but I think the key is the offeror's response.

Option D: Additional terms always become part of the contract. That can't be right because if the offeror objects, they don't. So D is definitely not true, making it a possible answer. But let me check other options.

Option E: They become part only if in writing. I don't think so. The UCC allows oral modifications, so additional terms don't have to be written to be part of the contract. So E is not necessarily true.

Option F: They become part unless they materially alter the agreement. This sounds familiar. If the additional terms don't materially change the offer, they can be included. So F is correct, meaning it's not the answer.

Option G: They become part only if the offeror sends a written confirmation. That doesn't sound right. The offeror's response can be oral. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H: They never become part of the contract. No, because sometimes they do if the offeror doesn't object. So H is not true.

Option I: They become part unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer. That makes sense because if the offer says "no changes," then additional terms wouldn't be included. So I is correct.

Option J: They become part unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time. Yes, this is correct. If the offeror doesn't object, the additional terms are part of the contract. So J is true.

So the question is what is NOT true. Let's go back to the options.

Option B: They become part only if the offeree does not object. Wait, the offeree is the acceptor who proposed the additional terms. So the offeree (acceptor) adds terms, and the offeror can object. So the terms are included unless the offeror objects. So B is saying "if the offeree does not object," which would mean the terms are included. But actually, the terms are included unless the offeror objects. So B is incorrect because it's the offeror's objection that matters, not the offeree's lack of objection. So B is not true.

Alternatively, looking at option J: "They become part unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time." That's correct, so J is true. Therefore, the incorrect statement is B because it's the offeror who needs to object, not the offeree.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the offeree is the one accepting with additional terms. So the offeror can accept those terms or not. So if the offeror doesn't object, the additional terms become part of the contract. So option B says the terms become part if the offeree does not object, which is incorrect because it's the offeror's objection that matters. So the offeree (acceptor) doesn't need to object; it's the offeror who can object.

So the incorrect statement is B, which is not true. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The correct answer is **B** because the additional terms proposed in an acceptance between merchants do not become part of the contract based on the offeree's lack of objection. Instead, it is the offeror's objection that determines whether the additional terms are included.
