Question:

Explain how density dependent controls of population occur.

Options:

A: Density dependent controls occur when the population density decreases.
B: Density dependent controls occur when the population's growth is influenced by unlimited resource availability.
C: Density dependent controls are independent of the population's size and density.
D: Density dependent controls occur when a population is limited by weather changes only.
E: Density dependent controls occur when a population's habitat changes.
F: Density dependent controls are determined by the occurrence of natural disasters, regardless of population density.
G: Density dependent controls occur when regulatory factors like predation, emigration, competition, physiological and behavioral mechanisms oppose the growth of a population as its density increases.
H: Density dependent controls occur solely due to predation.
I: Density dependent controls happen exclusively due to immigration of new individuals into a population.
J: Density dependent controls occur when a population's growth rate increases without limit as its density increases.

Okay, so I've got this biology question about density-dependent controls on population. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that population control mechanisms can be either density-dependent or density-independent. Density-dependent factors are those that depend on the population's size or density. So, when the population is larger, these factors become more significant. On the other hand, density-independent factors don't depend on population size, like natural disasters or weather changes.

The question is asking how density-dependent controls occur. The options are labeled A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says density-dependent controls occur when the population density decreases. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If the density decreases, the factors should maybe be less influential, not when they occur. So A might not be the correct answer.

Option B says these controls happen when growth is influenced by unlimited resources. Wait, unlimited resources would actually promote growth, not control it. So B is probably wrong because density-dependent factors limit growth, not when resources are abundant.

Option C claims density-dependent controls are independent of population size. That's the opposite of what density-dependent means. So C is incorrect.

Option D says it's limited by weather changes only. Weather is a density-independent factor, right? So D is not about density-dependent controls.

Option E talks about habitat changes. Habitat changes could be either, but if it's because of the population's actions, like overcrowding leading to resource depletion, that's density-dependent. But the option doesn't specify, so I'm not sure yet.

Option F says controls are determined by natural disasters regardless of density. Again, natural disasters are density-independent, so F is not the right choice.

Option G: Density-dependent controls occur when factors like predation, emigration, competition, etc., oppose growth as density increases. This sounds familiar. I remember that as populations grow, these factors become more significant. So G seems correct.

Option H says it's solely due to predation. But density-dependent factors include more than just predation, like competition and disease. So H is too narrow and incorrect.

Option I says it's due to immigration. Immigration would add to the population, not control it, so I is wrong.

Option J claims growth rate increases without limit as density increases. That's the opposite of density-dependent control; higher density should lead to factors that limit growth, not increase it. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G. It accurately describes density-dependent controls as factors that become more influential as the population density increases, such as predation, competition, and other mechanisms.

The correct answer is G. Density-dependent controls occur when factors like predation, emigration, competition, physiological, and behavioral mechanisms oppose population growth as density increases.

Answer: G
