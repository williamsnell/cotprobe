Question:

A brick mason was hired by a builder under a written one-year contract, at an annual salary of $45,000, with employment to begin on March 1. Because the builder was unable to secure enough building contracts to keep all its employees busy during the season beginning March 1, it notified the brick mason on February 15 that it could not afford to employ him as a mason. At the same time, however, the builder offered to employ the mason, for the same contract period, as a night guard at an annual salary of $25,000. The mason declined the offer and remained unemployed during the year. No offer and remained unemployed during the year. No employment for brick masons was available in the community during the year, but the mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year. At the end of the year, in an action against the builder for breach of contract, how much, if anything, is the mason entitled to recover?

Options:

A: $20,000 (the difference between the mason's contract price and the salary offered for the night guard position).
B: $45,000 (the contract price).
C: Nothing, because the mason turned down a reasonable alternative employment offer.
D: Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages.
E: $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).
F: $45,000 plus damages for emotional distress.
G: Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason.
H: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a day laborer).
I: $45,000 minus any unemployment benefits the mason received during the year.
J: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a night guard).

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a breach of contract case involving a brick mason and a builder. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the facts: A brick mason was hired under a written one-year contract starting March 1 with an annual salary of $45,000. The builder, because of not having enough work, notifies the mason on February 15 that they can't employ him as a mason but offers him a night guard position for the same period at $25,000 a year. The mason declines this offer and remains unemployed for the year. 

Now, during that year, there were no brick mason jobs available in the community, but he could have gotten day laborer jobs paying up to $25,000. At the end of the year, he sues for breach of contract. The question is how much he can recover.

I remember that when a contract is breached, the non-breaching party can usually recover damages. In employment contracts, typically, the measure of damages is the lost earnings the employee would have earned minus any mitigation, like if they found another job.

Wait, so the builder is offering a different position at a lower salary. The mason turns it down. So, does the builder have any liability?

I think in contract law, when an employer offers a different position, if the new position is reasonable, the employee is expected to mitigate by accepting it. If they refuse without good reason, they might not be able to recover the full amount.

In this case, the builder offered a night guard position at $25k, which is less than the mason's original salary of $45k. The mason declined. But he could have found other day labor jobs paying up to $25k. So, if he didn't take the night guard job, but could have earned $25k elsewhere, would that affect his damages?

So, the contract was for $45k. The mason didn't work at all, but he could have earned $25k elsewhere. So, his actual loss is $20k (45k-25k). But wait, the builder offered him a job at 25k, and he turned it down. Does that mean he didn't mitigate because he didn't take the offer?

Wait, but the builder's offer was a different role. If the mason is a brick mason, being a night guard is a different job. The question says that there were no brick mason jobs available, but other day labor jobs were available up to $25k. So, the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer, but he didn't take the night guard job. 

So, the builder offered a lower-paying job, but the mason didn't take it. Now, is the builder liable for the full $45k, or is the mason required to take the lower-paying job and mitigate his damages? Or because the job offered was a different position, is the mason not required to take it?

I think the key here is whether the job offered by the builder was a reasonable alternative. If the mason is a brick mason and the builder offers a different role, he might not be obliged to accept it unless it's a comparable position. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the builder offers any alternative employment, the mason must take it to mitigate.

Wait, the mason's contract was for a specific role as a brick mason. The builder offered a different role, which might not be comparable. But under the doctrine of mitigation, the employee is required to make reasonable efforts to find comparable employment. If the builder offers an alternative position, even if it's a different role, the employee might have to accept it unless it's not reasonable.

In this case, the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer, which is the same as the night guard salary. So, if he didn't take the night guard job, he could have found a day labor job paying the same. So, the question is whether he's required to take the night guard job. If he's not, then his damages would be the difference between his contract and what he could have earned, which is $20k (45k-25k). 

But wait, the options include E: $20k (45k-25k), which is the contract minus what he could have earned elsewhere. But some options talk about whether he mitigated by not taking the builder's offer.

Option C says nothing because the mason turned down a reasonable alternative. So, if the night guard job is a reasonable alternative, then the mason is barred from recovering the full amount because he didn't accept it. But if the job is not comparable, then he's not required to take it.

I think the key here is whether the new job is a comparable position. Since the mason's original role was a brick mason, being a night guard is a different role. So, the mason might not be required to accept it. Therefore, he can still recover the difference between his contract and what he could have earned elsewhere, which is $20k. 

Looking at the options, E is $20k, which is the contract price minus what he could have earned. So, that would be the correct answer. Alternatively, if the builder's offer was a reasonable alternative, then the mason might have to take it, and thus not recover the full amount. But since the job is different, perhaps he isn't required to accept it.

Wait, but some jurisdictions might say that any alternative employment offered by the employer must be accepted unless it's not comparable. So, if the builder offers a different position, but it's not comparable, the employee isn't obliged to take it. Therefore, the mason could still recover the difference between his contract and what he could have earned elsewhere, which is $20k.

So, the answer should be E: $20,000.

The mason is entitled to recover the difference between his contract salary and what he could have earned elsewhere, which is $20,000.
