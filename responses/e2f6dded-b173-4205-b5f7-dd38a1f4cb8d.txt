Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about ferromagnetic materials and work required when a magnetic field is applied. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that we have 0.1 cubic meters of a ferromagnetic substance at a constant temperature of 4 K. The magnetic field is increased from 0 to (4π/10) tesla. We need to find the work required, assuming the substance follows the Curie equation of state. The given constant C is 4π × 10^9 weber-°K/amp-meter.

Wait, first, I remember that when you apply a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic material, the magnetization M changes, and there's energy involved in that process. The work done is related to the change in magnetic energy in the material, right?

The Curie equation, I think, relates the magnetic susceptibility χ to temperature. The equation is χ = C/(T), where C is the Curie constant. Oh wait, but in this problem, they've given the Curie constant as C = 4π × 10^9 weber-°K/amp-m. So, the susceptibility χ would be C divided by temperature T. Since T is 4 K, χ = (4π × 10^9) / 4 = π × 10^9 weber/amp-m.

But wait, the magnetic field B is related to H and M. B = μ0 (H + M), and M is the magnetization. For linear materials, M = χ H, so B = μ0 (H (1 + χ)). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the relation between magnetization and the field.

Wait, the work done in magnetizing the material can be found by integrating the magnetic field B over the change in magnetization. Or perhaps, the work done is the integral of B·dM over the volume? Or maybe it's the integral of the magnetic field multiplied by the change in magnetization. I'm a bit confused here.

I recall that the energy stored in a magnetic field is given by U = (1/2) ∫ B · H dV. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here, because we're dealing with the work done during the magnetization process, which might involve integrating M against the field.

Alternatively, the work done per unit volume when the field is changed from 0 to B is given by the integral of M dB, because the force per unit volume is M × H, and H is B/μ0 - M/μ0, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the energy change. The energy per unit volume is (1/2) B H. Since H = B/μ0 (assuming linear material), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since M is proportional to H via the susceptibility, perhaps we can express H in terms of B.

Wait, the Curie equation gives us the susceptibility χ = C/T, which is χ = (4π × 10^9) / 4 = π × 10^9 weber/amp-m. So, χ is in units of m/(A·m) because H is in A/m. Wait, no, χ is unitless because H is in A/m and B is in T (which is Wb/m² = T). Wait, no, χ is unitless because B = μ0 (H + M) and M = χ H. So χ is a dimensionless quantity.

Wait, maybe I should express M in terms of H. M = χ H. Then, since B = μ0 (H + M) = μ0 H (1 + χ). But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

The work done when the magnetic field is applied is the integral of the magnetic field B multiplied by the change in magnetization M over the volume. Or perhaps it's the integral of the magnetic field B times the differential change in M, integrated over the volume.

Wait, the work done W is the integral over the volume of the integral of B · dM. Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say that the work done is the integral of B · dM over the volume. So, W = ∫ B dM over the volume.

But since the material is ferromagnetic and we're applying the field from 0 to B, let's model this. So, M starts at 0 and goes to M = χ H. But H is B/μ0. Wait, B = μ0 (H + M) = μ0 H (1 + χ), so H = B/(μ0 (1 + χ)).

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. The work done in magnetizing the material can be expressed as the integral from B=0 to B=B of B dM, integrated over the volume.

But M is related to B via the Curie equation. Since we're given the Curie equation, M = χ H, and H = B/μ0. So M = (χ/μ0) B.

Wait, no, because B = μ0 (H + M) = μ0 H (1 + χ), so H = B/(μ0 (1 + χ)), and M = χ H = (χ B)/(μ0 (1 + χ)).

Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to consider that M varies with B as M = (C/(T μ0)) B, since χ = C/(T μ0) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let's try to write down the relationships:

1. The Curie equation: χ = C/(T), where C is the Curie constant. So χ = (4π × 10^9 weber-°K/amp·m) / 4 K = π × 10^9 weber/amp·m.

Wait, but the unit of χ should be m/(A·m) because H is in A/m. Wait, no, χ is unitless because it's the ratio of M (magnetic moment per unit volume, in A·m) to H (in A/m). So M = χ H, so χ is (A·m)/(A/m) = m², which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the units wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the formula without worrying too much about the units, as they might cancel out correctly.

So, M = χ H, and H = B/μ0. Therefore, M = (χ/μ0) B.

So, M = (χ/μ0) B.

Now, the work done W is the integral of B dM over the volume. So,

W = ∫ B dM from M=0 to M = M_max.

But M = (χ/μ0) B, so dM = (χ/μ0) dB.

So, W = ∫ B * (χ/μ0) dB from B=0 to B=B_final.

So, W = (χ/μ0) ∫ B dB from 0 to B_final.

The integral of B dB is (1/2) B².

So, W = (χ/μ0) * (1/2) B_final² * Volume.

Given that Volume V = 0.1 m³.

So, substituting the values:

χ = C/(T) = (4π × 10^9 Wb·K/A·m) / 4 K = π × 10^9 Wb/A·m.

Wait, let me double-check the units. C is given as 4π ×10^9 weber-°K/amp·meter. So, C has units of (Wb·K)/(A·m). So, when we divide by T (in K), χ = (Wb·K/(A·m)) / K = Wb/(A·m), which is correct because χ is in units of m/(A·m) because H is in A/m. Wait, no, perhaps χ is unitless. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here, but let's proceed with the calculation.

μ0 is the permeability of free space, which is 4π × 10^-7 H/m (henrys per meter). So, μ0 = 4π × 10^-7 Wb/A·m.

So, putting it all together:

W = (χ/μ0) * (1/2) B² * V.

Substituting the values:

χ = (4π × 10^9 Wb·K/A·m) / 4 K = π × 10^9 Wb/A·m.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in calculating χ. Let me recalculate.

Given C = 4π × 10^9 weber-°K/amp·m. So, C has units of (Wb·K)/(A·m). Then, χ = C / T, where T is in K. So,

χ = (4π × 10^9 Wb·K/(A·m)) ) / 4 K = π × 10^9 Wb/(A·m).

So, χ is π × 10^9 Wb/(A·m).

μ0 is 4π × 10^-7 Wb/A·m.

So, χ/μ0 = (π × 10^9) / (4π × 10^-7) ) = (10^9) / (4 × 10^-7) ) = (10^16) / 4 = 2.5 × 10^15.

Wait, that seems extremely high, but let's proceed.

B_final is given as (4π/10) Wb/m². So, B = (4π/10) T.

So, B² = (4π/10)^2 = (16π²)/(100).

Now, putting everything into W:

W = (2.5 × 10^15) * (1/2) * (16π²/100) * 0.1.

Calculating step by step:

First, 2.5e15 multiplied by 0.5 is 1.25e15.

Then, 1.25e15 multiplied by (16π²/100) is 1.25e15 * (16π²/100) = 1.25e15 * 0.16π² = 2e14 π².

Then, multiplied by 0.1 (the volume) gives 2e14 π² * 0.1 = 2e13 π².

Wait, that seems too high, and the options are on the order of 1e5 to 1e7 π N·m. So, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating χ/μ0.

Let me recalculate χ/μ0:

χ = π × 10^9 Wb/(A·m).

μ0 = 4π × 10^-7 Wb/A·m.

So, χ/μ0 = (π × 10^9) / (4π × 10^-7) ) = (10^9) / (4 × 10^-7) ) = (10^16)/(4) = 2.5 × 10^15 (Wb/(A·m)) / (Wb/(A·m)) ) → unitless, correct.

So, that part is correct.

Now, the integral:

W = (χ/μ0) * (1/2) B² * V.

So,

(2.5e15) * 0.5 * ( (4π/10)^2 ) * 0.1.

Compute B²: (4π/10)^2 = 16π²/100 = 0.16π².

So,

2.5e15 * 0.5 = 1.25e15.

1.25e15 * 0.16π² = 2e14 π².

2e14 π² * 0.1 = 2e13 π².

Wait, that's 2e13 * (π^2) N·m. But looking at the options, the highest is option G: 1e7 π N·m. So, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done is (1/2) ∫ B dM from M=0 to M=M_max.

Wait, because the energy per unit volume is (1/2) B M. So, the total work would be (1/2) ∫ B dM over the volume.

Wait, let me think again. The energy stored in the material is U = (1/2) ∫ B · H dV. But H is B/μ0 - M/μ0, but perhaps for small fields, H ≈ B/μ0. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for the work done is W = ∫ B dM from 0 to M_max, and since M = (χ/μ0) B, then dM = (χ/μ0) dB.

So, W = ∫ B * (χ/μ0) dB from 0 to B_final.

Which gives W = (χ/μ0) * (1/2) B_final^2 * V.

So, that's the same expression as before, but the numbers are way too big. So, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the value of χ. Let me recheck.

Given C = 4π × 10^9 Wb·K/(A·m). So, C = 4πe9 Wb·K/(A·m).

χ = C / T = (4πe9 Wb·K/(A·m)) / 4 K = πe9 Wb/(A·m).

Yes, that's correct.

μ0 = 4πe-7 Wb/(A·m).

So, χ/μ0 = (πe9) / (4πe-7) ) = (1e9) / (4e-7) ) = (1e16) /4 = 2.5e15.

Hmm, that's correct.

B_final is 4π/10 T = 0.4π T.

So, B_final^2 = (0.4π)^2 = 0.16 π² T².

So, putting it all together:

W = (2.5e15) * (0.5) * (0.16 π²) * 0.1.

Compute each part:

2.5e15 * 0.5 = 1.25e15.

1.25e15 * 0.16 = 2e14.

2e14 * π² ≈ 2e14 * 9.87 ≈ 1.974e15.

Wait, but then multiply by 0.1 (volume):

1.974e15 * 0.1 = 1.974e14 N·m.

That's way larger than any of the options, which are up to 1e7 π. So, clearly, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the work done is calculated differently. Perhaps using the relation between B and H, and integrating the energy density.

The energy density u is (1/2) B H.

H is B/μ0, so u = (1/2) B (B/μ0) ) = B²/(2 μ0).

So, the total energy U is u multiplied by the volume V.

So, U = (B²/(2 μ0)) * V.

But wait, that would give the energy stored in the magnetic field, but I'm not sure if that's the work done on the material, as the material's magnetization is being driven by the field.

Wait, but perhaps the work done is the energy required to create the magnetic field, which would be U = (1/2) B H * V. Since H is B/μ0, then U = (1/2) B²/(μ0) * V.

So, let's compute that.

Given B = 4π/10 T = 0.4π T.

So, B² = (0.4π)^2 = 0.16 π² T².

μ0 =4π ×1e-7 H/m.

So,

U = (0.5) * (0.16 π²) / (4π × 1e-7) ) * 0.1 m³.

Simplify:

(0.5) * (0.16 π²) = 0.08 π².

Denominator: 4π × 1e-7.

So,

0.08 π² / (4π × 1e-7) ) = (0.08 /4) * π²/(π) ) / 1e-7.

Simplify:

0.02 * π / 1e-7 = 0.02 π × 1e7 = 2e5 π.

Multiply by volume 0.1 m³:

2e5 π * 0.1 = 2e4 π.

Wait, 2e4 π N·m is 20,000 π, which is 2e4 π. Looking at the options, none of them match. The closest is option F: 2e6 π, which is way bigger.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think about the correct formula for the work done.

Another approach: The work done in magnetizing the material is the integral from 0 to B of B dM, integrated over the volume.

M = (χ/μ0) B.

So, dM = (χ/μ0) dB.

Therefore, W = ∫ B dM = ∫ B * (χ/μ0) dB.

Integrate from 0 to B_final:

W = (χ/μ0) * (1/2) B_final^2 * V.

Which is the same expression as before.

So, plugging in the numbers again:

χ = πe9 Wb/(A·m).

μ0 =4πe-7 Wb/(A·m).

So, χ/μ0 = (πe9) / (4πe-7) ) = (1e9) / (4e-7) ) = 2.5e15.

B_final = 4π/10 T = 0.4π T.

B_final^2 = (0.4π)^2 = 0.16 π².

So,

W = 2.5e15 * 0.5 * 0.16 π² * 0.1.

Calculating:

2.5e15 *0.5 =1.25e15.

1.25e15 * 0.16 = 2e14.

2e14 * π² = approx 2e14 * 9.8696 ≈ 1.9739e15.

1.9739e15 * 0.1 = 1.9739e14.

Which is way bigger than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units of C. Let me check the given C again: C =4π ×1e9 Wb·°K/(A·m). So, units are (Wb·K)/(A·m).

Then, χ = C / T → (Wb·K/(A·m)) ) / K → Wb/(A·m).

Which is correct because χ is dimensionless (since M = χ H, and H is in A/m, M in A·m, so χ = M/(H) → (A·m)/(A/m) = m² → no, that can't be right. So perhaps I messed up the units again.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of M = χ H, where H is in A/m, M in A·m/m³ = A/m. So, M = χ H → χ is (A/m) / (A/m) ) → unitless. So, χ is unitless, which matches the calculation.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as before, but perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let's recompute χ/μ0:

χ = (4π ×1e9 Wb·K/(A·m)) ) / 4 K = π ×1e9 Wb/(A·m).

μ0 =4π ×1e-7 Wb/(A·m).

So, χ/μ0 = (πe9) / (4πe-7) ) = (1e9) / (4e-7) ) = (1e16)/4 = 2.5e15.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, B_final =4π/10 T = 0.4π T.

So, B_final squared is (0.4π)^2 = 0.16 π².

So, W = 2.5e15 * 0.5 * 0.16 π² * 0.1.

Let me compute each step:

2.5e15 * 0.5 = 1.25e15.

1.25e15 * 0.16 = 2e14.

2e14 * π² ≈ 2e14 * 9.8696 ≈ 1.9739e15.

1.9739e15 * 0.1 = 1.9739e14.

Which is 1.9739e14 N·m, which is way larger than any of the options. So, perhaps I have the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the energy in a magnetic material, which is U = (1/2) ∫ B · H dV from 0 to B.

But H is B/μ0 (assuming linear material), so U = (1/2) ∫ (B/μ0) B dV.

So, U = (1/(2 μ0)) ∫ B² dV.

So, for the entire volume V, U = (1/(2 μ0)) * B² * V.

Wait, that's a simpler formula. Let's try that.

So,

U = (B² * V) / (2 μ0).

Compute this:

B =4π/10 = 0.4π T.

B² = (0.4π)^2 = 0.16 π².

V =0.1 m³.

μ0 =4π ×1e-7 H/m.

So,

U = (0.16 π² * 0.1) / (2 *4π ×1e-7)).

Calculate numerator: 0.16 *0.1 =0.016. So, 0.016 π².

Denominator: 2 *4π ×1e-7 =8π ×1e-7.

So,

U = (0.016 π²) / (8π ×1e-7) ) = (0.016 /8) * (π² / π) * (1e7).

Simplify:

0.016 /8 = 0.002.

π²/π = π.

So,

U = 0.002 * π *1e7 = 0.002e7 π = 2e4 π.

So, U =2e4 π N·m.

Which is 20,000 π N·m. Looking at the options, option F is 2e6 π, which is 2,000,000 π. So, that's way bigger. Hmm, none of the options match. So perhaps this approach is also wrong.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the formula.

The energy stored in the magnetic field is indeed U = (1/2) B H * V. And since H = B/μ0, then U = (1/2) B (B/μ0) V = B² V/(2 μ0).

So, that's correct. Let me plug in the numbers again.

B =4π/10 T = 0.4π T.

B² = (0.4π)^2 =0.16 π² T².

V=0.1 m³.

μ0=4π ×1e-7 H/m =4π ×1e-7 Wb/(A·m).

So,

U = (0.16 π² * 0.1) / (2 *4π ×1e-7).

Compute numerator: 0.16 *0.1=0.016. So, 0.016 π².

Denominator: 2*4π ×1e-7=8π ×1e-7.

So,

U = (0.016 π²) / (8π ×1e-7) ) = (0.016 /8 ) * (π²/π) * (1e7).

0.016/8=0.002.

π²/π=π.

So,

U=0.002 * π *1e7 = 2e4 π.

Which is 20,000 π N·m. But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula involving the Curie equation more directly. The Curie equation is M = C/(T) H.

Wait, no, the Curie equation is χ = C/(T), so M = χ H = (C/(T)) H.

So, M = (C/(T)) * (B/μ0).

Wait, because H = B/μ0.

So, M = (C/(T μ0)) B.

So, the energy is U = ∫ B dM from 0 to B.

Wait, but M = (C/(T μ0)) B.

So, dM = (C/(T μ0)) dB.

Thus,

U = ∫ B * (C/(T μ0)) dB from 0 to B_final.

Which is (C/(T μ0)) * (1/2) B_final^2.

Multiply by volume V, so U = (C/(T μ0)) * (1/2) B_final^2 * V.

Let me compute this:

C=4π×1e9 Wb·K/(A·m).

T=4 K.

μ0=4π ×1e-7 Wb/(A·m).

B_final=4π/10 T.

V=0.1 m³.

So,

U = (4πe9/(4 *4πe-7)) * (1/2) * (4π/10)^2 *0.1.

Simplify:

First, compute (4πe9)/(4 *4πe-7) = (4πe9)/(16πe-7) )= (e9)/(4e-7) )= (1e16)/4 = 2.5e15.

Then, (1/2) * (4π/10)^2 = 0.5 * (16π²/100) = 0.5 * 0.16 π² = 0.08 π².

Multiply by 0.1: 0.08 π² *0.1=0.008 π².

Now, multiply all together:

2.5e15 * 0.008 π² = 2e13 π².

Which is 2e13 * (π^2) N·m.

But this is way too large, and the options are much smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents again. Let me recheck:

C=4π ×1e9 Wb·K/(A·m).

T=4 K.

So, C/(T) = π ×1e9 Wb/(A·m).

μ0=4π ×1e-7 Wb/(A·m).

So, C/(T μ0) = (πe9) / (4πe-7) ) = (1e9) / (4e-7) ) = 2.5e15.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the work done as the integral of B dM over the volume, which gives:

W = ∫ B dM = ∫ B * (C/(T μ0)) dB.

Which gives (C/(T μ0)) * (B²/2) * V.

So, substituting the numbers:

C=4πe9, T=4, μ0=4πe-7.

So,

(4πe9)/(4 *4πe-7) ) = (e9)/(4e-7) )= 2.5e15.

Then, B²/2 = ( (4π/10)^2 ) /2 = (16π²/100)/2 = (0.16 π²)/2 = 0.08 π².

Multiply by V=0.1: 0.08 π² *0.1=0.008 π².

So, W=2.5e15 *0.008 π² = 2e13 π².

Again, same result as before, which is way too big.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Another thought: perhaps the work done is given by W = (1/2) C V B² / T.

Wait, where did I get that from? Let me think. From the Curie equation, M = C/(T) H, and H = B/μ0. So,

M = (C/(T μ0)) B.

The energy is the integral of B dM from 0 to B.

So,

W = ∫ B dM = ∫ B * (C/(T μ0)) dB from 0 to B.

Which is (C/(T μ0)) * (1/2) B².

Multiply by volume V:

W = (C/(T μ0)) * (1/2) B² * V.

Which is what I've been calculating. So, perhaps the problem is that C has units that I'm not considering correctly.

Wait, given C =4π ×1e9 Wb·K/(A·m).

So, units of C: (Wb·K)/(A·m).

Then, χ = C/(T) → (Wb·K/(A·m)) ) / K → Wb/(A·m).

Which is correct because χ is unitless, as M is in A/m and H in A/m, so M = χ H → (A/m) = (unitless) * (A/m) → correct.

So, the calculation seems right, but the result is way too big. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is W = (1/2) M B * V.

Because the energy stored in the magnetization is (1/2) M B.

But M = (C/(T μ0)) B.

So,

M = (4πe9 /4 K ) / (4πe-7) ) * B.

Which simplifies to:

(1e9 /4e-7 ) * B = 2.5e15 B.

Wait, but then M = 2.5e15 B.

So, energy U = (1/2) M B V.

Which is (1/2) * 2.5e15 B * B * 0.1.

So,

U = (1.25e15) * B² *0.1.

B =4π/10 T → B² = (4π/10)^2 =16π²/100=0.16 π².

So,

U =1.25e15 *0.16 π² *0.1= 1.25e15 * 0.016 π² = 2e13 π².

Again, same result. So, I'm getting the same huge number. But the options are much smaller. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is W = (1/2) ∫ B M dV, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the work done is the integral of H dM, which is ∫ H dM = ∫ (B/μ0) dM.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the work done is the area under the B-M curve. If M is proportional to B, then it's a straight line from 0 to M_max at B_max. So, the area would be the average B times M times volume.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between B and M.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is W = ∫ B dM from 0 to M_max, and since M = (C/(T μ0)) B, then dM = (C/(T μ0)) dB.

So,

W = ∫ B * (C/(T μ0)) dB = (C/(T μ0)) * (1/2) B² * V.

Which is what I've been calculating.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it numerically.

Compute step by step:

C=4π ×1e9 = approx 12.566e9.

T=4.

μ0=4π ×1e-7 ≈1.2566e-6.

B=4π/10 ≈1.2566.

So,

C/(T μ0) = (12.566e9) / (4 *1.2566e-6) )= (12.566e9) / (5.0264e-6) )= approx 2.5e15.

B²= (1.2566)^2 ≈1.579.

So,

W=2.5e15 * (1/2) *1.579 *0.1.

=2.5e15 *0.5 *0.1579 *0.1.

=2.5e15 *0.007895.

= approx 1.97375e13.

Which is 1.97375e13 N·m, which is way too big.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option H:4e6 π N·m.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me check:

When I calculated C/(T μ0):

C=4π ×1e9.

T=4.

μ0=4π ×1e-7.

So,

C/(T μ0) = (4πe9) / (4 *4πe-7) )= (4πe9)/(16πe-7) )= (e9)/(4e-7) )= 1e16 /4 =2.5e15.

Yes, correct.

Then, B_final=4π/10=0.4π.

B²=0.16 π².

So,

W=2.5e15 * 0.5 *0.16 π² *0.1.

=2.5e15 *0.5=1.25e15.

1.25e15 *0.16=2e14.

2e14 * π²= approx 6.28e14.

6.28e14 *0.1=6.28e13.

Hmm, that's 6.28e13 N·m, which is still way too big.

Wait, but wait, the options are in the range of 1e5 to 1e7 π. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent of C.

Wait, given C =4π ×10^9 weber-°K/amp·m. So, 4πe9, yes.

But perhaps I should calculate it more carefully.

Wait, let me try to compute the entire expression step by step numerically.

Compute W = (C/(T μ0)) * (1/2) B² * V.

C=4π ×1e9 = approx 12.5663706e9 Wb·K/(A·m).

T=4 K.

μ0=4π ×1e-7 = approx 1.25663706e-6 Wb/(A·m).

B=4π/10 = approx 1.25663706 T.

V=0.1 m³.

Compute C/(T μ0):

12.5663706e9 / (4 *1.25663706e-6) )= 12.5663706e9 / (5.02654824e-6) )= approx 2.5e15.

Compute B²: (1.25663706)^2 ≈1.5791367.

So,

W=2.5e15 * (1/2) *1.5791367 *0.1.

Simplify:

2.5e15 *0.5 =1.25e15.

1.25e15 *1.5791367 ≈1.25e15 *1.579 ≈1.97375e15.

1.97375e15 *0.1=1.97375e14.

Which is 1.97375e14 N·m, which is way larger than any option. So, I'm clearly making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is W = (1/2) * (C/(T)) * B² * V.

Wait, because M = (C/(T)) H, and H = B/μ0.

So, M = (C/(T μ0)) B.

The energy is (1/2) B M * V.

So,

U = (1/2) B * (C/(T μ0)) B * V.

= (1/2) * (C/(T μ0)) * B² * V.

Which is the same as before.

So, I'm back to the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Curie equation is M = C/(kT) H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong expression for M.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is M = (C/(T)) (B/μ0).

Wait, that would mean M = (C/(T μ0)) B.

Which is what I have. So, I think I'm correct.

Wait, perhaps the given C is in different units. Let me check the units again.

C is given as 4π ×1e9 Wb·°K/(A·m).

So, C has units of (Wb·K)/(A·m).

So, when I compute χ = C/(T), the units are (Wb·K)/(A·m) ) / K → Wb/(A·m).

Which is correct, as χ is unitless.

Wait, perhaps I should express B in terms of H. Let me try that.

H = B/μ0.

So, H = (4π/10) / (4π ×1e-7) )= (0.4π) / (4π ×1e-7) )= 0.1 /1e-7 =1e6 A/m.

So, H=1e6 A/m.

Then, M = χ H = (C/(T μ0)) * H.

Wait, no, M = χ H.

But χ = C/(T μ0).

Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, χ = C/(T).

Because Curie equation is χ = C/(T).

But μ0 is a separate constant.

So, M = χ H = (C/(T)) * (B/μ0).

Which is M = (C/(T μ0)) B.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the work done as the integral of H dM.

Because H is the magnetic field intensity, and dM is the change in magnetization.

So, work done W = ∫ H dM from M=0 to M_max.

Since M = χ H, dM = χ dH.

So,

W = ∫ H * χ dH from H=0 to H_max.

= χ ∫ H dH from 0 to H_max.

= χ * (1/2 H_max^2 ) * Volume.

So,

W = (χ V /2 ) H_max^2.

But H_max = B_final / μ0.

So,

W = (χ V /2 ) (B_final/μ0)^2.

Let me compute this.

χ = C/(T) = (4πe9 Wb·K/(A·m)) ) /4 K = πe9 Wb/(A·m).

V=0.1 m³.

B_final=4π/10 T=0.4π T.

μ0=4πe-7 Wb/(A·m).

So,

W= (πe9 *0.1 /2 ) * (0.4π/(4πe-7))^2.

Simplify:

First, compute (0.4π/(4πe-7))^2.

= (0.4/(4e-7))^2 * π^2 / π^2 = (0.1e7)^2 = (1e6)^2 =1e12.

Wait, wait:

(0.4π) / (4πe-7) )= 0.4/(4e-7) )= (0.1) / (e-7) )=1e6.

So, (1e6)^2 =1e12.

So,

W = ( πe9 *0.1 /2 ) * 1e12.

= ( πe8 /2 ) *1e12.

= (0.5 πe8) *1e12.

=0.5 πe20.

= (5e19) π/10.

Wait, no, 0.5 *1e20 =5e19.

Wait, no, 0.5 *1e20 is 5e19.

So,

W=5e19 π N·m.

Which is way too big. So, I must have made a mistake.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Another approach: perhaps the correct formula is W = (C V B^2)/(2 T μ0).

So,

W = (4πe9 *0.1 * (4π/10)^2 ) / (2 *4 *4πe-7).

Wait, but let me compute this step by step.

Compute numerator:

C=4πe9.

V=0.1.

B=4π/10.

So,

C * V * B² =4πe9 *0.1 * (16π²/100) )=4πe9 *0.1 *0.16 π² )=4πe9 *0.016 π².

=4 *0.016 * π^3 e9.

=0.064 π^3 e9.

Denominator:

2 *4 *4πe-7 =32 πe-7.

So,

W= (0.064 π^3 e9) / (32 πe-7) )= (0.064 /32) * (π^2) * (e16).

0.064/32=0.002.

So,

W=0.002 * π² *e16.

=2e-3 *e16 π².

=2e13 π².

Again, same result as before. So, I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H:4e6 π.

Because when I plug in the numbers, I get 2e4 π, which is not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula W = (1/2) C V B^2 / T.

So,

W = (1/2) * (4πe9) *0.1 * (4π/10)^2 /4.

Compute:

(4πe9)*0.1=4πe8.

(4π/10)^2=16π²/100=0.16 π².

So,

(1/2) *4πe8 *0.16 π² /4.

= (2πe8) *0.16 π² /4.

= (0.32 π^3 e8)/4.

=0.08 π^3 e8.

=8e7 π^3.

But that's 8e7 π^3, which is not matching any option.

I think I'm stuck and need to proceed to the answer based on the options given. Given that my calculation leads to 2e4 π, which is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:4e6 π.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: perhaps the correct formula is W = (C V B^2)/(2 T μ0).

Let me compute that.

C=4πe9.

V=0.1.

B=4π/10.

T=4.

μ0=4πe-7.

So,

W= (4πe9 *0.1 * (4π/10)^2 ) / (2 *4 *4πe-7).

Compute numerator:

4πe9 *0.1=4πe8.

(4π/10)^2=16π²/100=0.16 π².

So,

4πe8 *0.16 π²=4*0.16 * π^3 e8=0.64 π^3 e8.

Denominator: 2 *4 *4πe-7=32 πe-7.

So,

W=0.64 π^3 e8 / (32 πe-7 )= (0.64/32) * π^2 * e15.

0.64/32=0.02.

So,

W=0.02 π^2 e15=2e-2 *e15 π²=2e13 π².

Again, same result.

I think I'm missing something fundamental here. Maybe the correct answer is option H:4e6 π N·m.

The problem involves calculating the work required to magnetize a ferromagnetic substance following the Curie equation of state. The key steps involve determining the magnetization \( M \) as a function of the magnetic field \( B \), integrating the energy expression, and substituting the given constants and values.

1. **Curie Equation**: The susceptibility \( \chi \) is given by \( \chi = \frac{C}{T} \), where \( C = 4\pi \times 10^9 \, \text{Wb·K}/(\text{A·m}) \) and \( T = 4 \, \text{K} \). Thus, \( \chi = \frac{\pi \times 10^9}{1} \, \text{Wb}/(\text{A·m}) \).

2. **Magnetization**: \( M = \chi H = \chi \frac{B}{\mu_0} \), where \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{Wb}/(\text{A·m}) \). Substituting, \( M = \frac{\chi}{\mu_0} B \).

3. **Work Calculation**: The work \( W \) is the integral of \( B \, dM \) over the volume:
   \[
   W = \int B \, dM = \int B \cdot \frac{\chi}{\mu_0} \, dB = \frac{\chi}{\mu_0} \cdot \frac{1}{2} B^2 \cdot V
   \]
   Substituting \( \chi = \pi \times 10^9 \), \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \), \( B = \frac{4\pi}{10} \, \text{T} \), and \( V = 0.1 \, \text{m}^3 \):
   \[
   W = \frac{\pi \times 10^9}{4\pi \times 10^{-7}} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{4\pi}{10}\right)^2 \cdot 0.1
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   W = \frac{10^{16}}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{16\pi^2}{100} \cdot 0.1 = 2.5 \times 10^{15} \cdot 0.08\pi^2 \cdot 0.1
   \]
   \[
   W = 2 \times 10^{13} \pi^2 \, \text{N·m}
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated result is significantly larger than the provided options. This suggests a possible error in the interpretation of the Curie constant or the integration limits. However, based on the given options and the closest match to the expected scale, the most reasonable choice is:
