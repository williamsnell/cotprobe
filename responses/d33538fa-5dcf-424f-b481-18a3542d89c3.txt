Okay, so I have this problem about oil drops settling in a chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my fluid mechanics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives me the specific gravity of oil as 0.88. I remember that specific gravity is the ratio of the fluid's density to water's density. Since water is 62.4 lb/ft³, the oil's density should be 0.88 times that. Let me calculate that: 0.88 * 62.4 = around 54.8 lb/ft³. Wait, no, wait—wait, actually, water's density is 1 g/cm³, but in lb/ft³, water is 62.4 lb/ft³. So yeah, oil's density is 0.88 * 62.4. Let me compute that accurately: 62.4 * 0.88. 62 * 0.88 is 54.56, and 0.4 *0.88 is 0.352, so total is 54.912 lb/ft³. So approximately 54.912 lb/ft³.

The oil drops have a diameter of 3.5e-5 ft. So radius is half of that, which is 1.75e-5 ft. I think I'll need the radius for the Stokes' law calculation.

The settling time is 90 seconds, which is 1.5 minutes? Wait, no, it's just 90 seconds, so 1.5 minutes, but maybe I should keep it in seconds for calculations. So t = 90 s.

The density of air is given as 0.075 lb/ft³, and viscosity is 1.2e-5 lb/ft-s. Wait, is that the absolute viscosity or the dynamic viscosity? I think it's dynamic viscosity, which is the one used in Stokes' law.

Stokes' law gives the terminal velocity of a spherical object in a fluid. The formula is v = (2/9) * g * (ρ_p - ρ_f) * r² / η, where:
- v = terminal velocity,
- g = acceleration due to gravity,
- ρ_p = density of the particle (oil drop),
- ρ_f = density of the fluid (air),
- η = dynamic viscosity of the fluid.

Wait, but wait—wait, the units here are in lb/ft³ and lb/ft-s, and g is in ft/s². Let me make sure I get the units right.

So first, calculate the terminal velocity, then multiply by the settling time to get the maximum height the oil drops will settle.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Stokes' law is v = (2/9) * (ρ_p - ρ_f) * g * r² / η. I think that's correct.

So let me plug in the numbers.

First, compute the difference in densities: ρ_p - ρ_f = 54.912 - 0.075 = 54.837 lb/ft³.

Then, radius r is 1.75e-5 ft. So r squared is (1.75e-5)^2 = (3.0625e-10) ft².

η is 1.2e-5 lb/ft-s.

g is 32.174 ft/s² (standard gravity).

Now compute the numerator: (ρ_p - ρ_f) * g * r² = 54.837 * 32.174 * 3.0625e-10.

Let me compute each step:

54.837 * 32.174 ≈ let's see, 50*32=1600, 4.837*32≈154.784, so total around 1754.784, but precise calculation:

54.837 * 32.174:

Let me compute 54 *32.174 = 54*32=1728, 54*0.174≈9.396, so 1728 +9.396=1737.396.

Then 0.837 *32.174 ≈ approximately 26.913.

Adding together, 1737.396 +26.913 ≈ 1764.309.

So now, 1764.309 * 3.0625e-10.

Let me compute 1764.309 *3.0625e-10:

First, 1764.309 *3.0625 = let's see, 1764 *3 =5292, 1764 *0.0625=110.25, so total 5292 +110.25=5402.25. But since it's 1764.309, the exact value would be a bit more, but for approximation, say about 5405. Then, 5405e-10 is 5.405e-7.

Now the denominator is 9 * η, because in the formula it's (2/9)*... So denominator is 9 *1.2e-5 = 1.08e-4.

So v = (2/9) * (numerator / denominator) → wait, no, the formula is (2/9) * [ (ρ_p - ρ_f) g r² ] / η.

Wait, I think I messed up the steps. Let me re-express:

v = (2/9) * (ρ_p - ρ_f) * g * r² / η.

So I have (ρ_p - ρ_f) * g * r² = 54.837 *32.174 * (1.75e-5)^2.

Wait, let me compute (1.75e-5)^2: 3.0625e-10.

So (54.837)(32.174)(3.0625e-10) = let's compute 54.837 * 32.174 first.

As before, 54.837 *32.174 ≈ 54.837 *32 = 1754.784, plus 54.837 *0.174 ≈ 9.518, so total ≈1764.302.

Multiply by 3.0625e-10: 1764.302 * 3.0625e-10 ≈ 5.405e-7.

Now divide by η, which is 1.2e-5: 5.405e-7 / 1.2e-5 = (5.405 / 1.2) *1e-2 ≈4.504 *0.01 ≈0.04504.

Now multiply by (2/9): 0.04504 * (2/9) ≈0.04504 * 0.2222 ≈0.010008 ft/s.

Wait, that seems really low. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me try again.

Compute (ρ_p - ρ_f) = 54.912 - 0.075 = 54.837 lb/ft³.

r = 3.5e-5 ft / 2 =1.75e-5 ft.

r² = (1.75e-5)^2 =3.0625e-10 ft².

g =32.174 ft/s².

η=1.2e-5 lb/ft-s.

Compute the numerator: (ρ_p - ρ_f)*g*r² =54.837 *32.174 *3.0625e-10.

Compute 54.837 *32.174 first.

54.837 *32.174:

Let me compute 54 *32.174 =54*32=1728, 54*0.174=9.396 → total 1737.396.

Then 0.837 *32.174:

0.8 *32.174 =25.7392.

0.037 *32.174≈1.190.

Adding:25.7392 +1.190=26.9292.

Total:1737.396 +26.9292=1764.3252.

Multiply by 3.0625e-10:

1764.3252 *3.0625e-10 = (1764.3252 *3.0625) *1e-10.

Compute 1764.3252 *3.0625:

3.0625 is 3 + 1/16.

1764.3252 *3=5292.9756.

1764.3252 * (1/16) =110.270325.

Adding together:5292.9756 +110.270325 =5403.245925.

So 5403.245925e-10 =5.403245925e-7.

Now, divide by η=1.2e-5:

5.403245925e-7 /1.2e-5 = (5.403245925 /1.2) *1e-2 =4.502704938 *0.01=0.04502704938.

Multiply by (2/9):

0.04502704938 * (2/9) =0.04502704938 *0.222222≈0.01000596 ft/s.

So the terminal velocity v is approximately 0.010006 ft/s.

Now, the settling time is 90 seconds. The maximum height H is v * t.

H=0.010006 ft/s *90 s=0.90054 ft.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.9 ft, which matches closely.

Wait, but wait a second—did I miss any unit conversions? Let me check.

Density units: oil is in lb/ft³, air too. Viscosity is in lb/ft-s, which is correct. Acceleration due to gravity is in ft/s², correct. So the units should work out.

Wait, wait—Stokes' law uses the absolute viscosity, which is given here as 1.2e-5 lb/ft-s. So that should be correct.

So H≈0.9 ft, which is option A.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the maximum height of a chamber required for oil drops to settle using Stokes' law. The terminal velocity of the oil drops is determined by their density, radius, and the viscosity of air. Using the given values, the terminal velocity is calculated to be approximately 0.010006 ft/s. Multiplying this by the settling time of 90 seconds gives the maximum height, which is approximately 0.9 ft.
