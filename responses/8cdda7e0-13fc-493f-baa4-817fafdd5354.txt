Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The urn has 10 red and 10 white balls. We're drawing them one at a time with replacement. We need to find the probability that the fourth white ball is the fourth ball drawn. Hmm, wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me make sure I understand. Oh, right, so we're drawing until the fourth white ball appears, and we want the probability that this happens exactly on the fourth draw. So the fourth ball is white, and before that, in the first three draws, there have been exactly three white balls. Because if the fourth white comes on the fourth try, then the first three must have had exactly three whites.

Wait, but since we're replacing the balls each time, each draw is independent, right? So each draw has a probability of 10/20, which simplifies to 1/2 for white and 1/2 for red each time.

So, the problem is similar to the negative binomial distribution, where we're looking for the probability that the fourth success (here, drawing a white ball) occurs on the fourth trial. The negative binomial gives the probability of having k successes in n trials, with the nth trial being the kth success.

In this case, k is 4, and we want the probability that the fourth success occurs on the fourth trial. So, the formula for the negative binomial is:

P(X = n) = C(n-1, k-1) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- C(n-1, k-1) is the combination of (n-1) choose (k-1)
- p is the probability of success on a single trial
- n is the trial on which the kth success occurs

Plugging in the numbers:
- n = 4 (since the fourth white is on the fourth draw)
- k = 4 (we want the fourth success)
- p = 1/2

So, C(4-1, 4-1) = C(3,3) = 1.

Then, p^4 = (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

And (1-p)^(4-4) = (1/2)^0 = 1.

So, multiplying these together: 1 * 1/16 * 1 = 1/16.

Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because each draw is independent, the probability that the fourth white comes exactly on the fourth draw is the probability that the first three are white and the fourth is white. So, that would be (1/2)^4 = 1/16. So, that seems to match.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is: for the fourth white to be on the fourth draw, the first three must be exactly three whites and one red. Wait, no, that's not right. Because we have to have exactly three whites in the first three draws, and then the fourth is white. So, the first three draws must have exactly three whites, which is only one possible combination (since all three are white). The probability of that is (1/2)^3, and then the fourth is white, so (1/2)^1. So total probability is (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

Alternatively, let's model it as a sequence. The first three draws must all be white, and then the fourth is white. So, the number of ways for the first three to be white is 1 (since all must be white). So, the probability is (1/2)^3 * (1/2) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

Wait, but wait a second. If we're doing this with replacement, each draw is independent, so the sequence is just four independent events. The probability that the first three are white and the fourth is white is (1/2)^4 = 1/16. That seems straightforward.

But let me double-check whether the negative binomial applies here. Negative binomial models the number of trials needed to achieve a certain number of successes. So, in this case, we're looking for exactly four trials to get four successes. So, the formula should indeed give the probability as C(3,3)*(1/2)^4*(1/2)^0 = 1*(1/16)*1 = 1/16.

So, the answer should be 1/16. Looking at the options, F is 1/16.

The probability that the fourth white ball is drawn exactly on the fourth trial is calculated using the negative binomial distribution, considering each draw is independent with replacement. The result is 1/16.
