Question:

An investor is looking to purchase a security for $100 with an initial margin of 50% (meaning the investor is using $50 of his money to purchase the security and borrowing the remaining $50 from a broker).

Okay, so I need to figure out at what price the investor will get a margin call. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I hope I get it right.

Alright, the investor is buying a security for $100. The initial margin is 50%, which means the investor is putting in $50 of their own money and borrowing the other $50 from the broker. So, the initial margin requirement is 50% of the purchase price. That makes sense because the margin is the amount the investor must have in their account as a down payment.

Now, the maintenance margin is 25%. I remember that the maintenance margin is the minimum value that the security must maintain in the account after the purchase. If the value drops below this level, the investor gets a margin call, meaning they have to add more money or sell the security to cover the deficit.

So the question is, at what price will the investor receive this margin call? I think the formula for the margin call price involves the initial investment and the maintenance margin. Let me try to recall the formula. I think it's something like:

Margin Call Price = (Initial Margin / (1 - Maintenance Margin)) * Purchase Price

Wait, no, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the value of the security and the equity in the account.

The initial setup:
- Security price = $100
- Investor's initial margin = 50% of $100 = $50 (their own money)
- Borrowed amount = $50 from the broker.

So, the total amount the investor has in the account is $50 (equity) and $50 (loan). The total value is $100.

The maintenance margin is 25%, which means that the equity in the account must not drop below 25% of the value of the security. So, when the security's price falls, we need to find the point where the equity is exactly 25% of the new value. At that point, the investor is at the maintenance level, and any further drop would trigger a margin call.

Let me denote the price at which the margin call occurs as P. At that point, the equity in the account is 25% of P.

But the equity is also equal to the initial investment minus any losses. Wait, maybe a better way is to express equity as the value of the security minus the amount owed, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, the formula I think is:

Equity = (Current Price) * (Initial Margin) / (1 - Maintenance Margin)

Wait, no, perhaps a more precise approach is needed. Let's think in terms of the value of the security and the loan.

The investor's equity is always the value of the security minus the loan amount. But the loan amount is fixed at $50 in this case because they borrowed $50. Wait, no, actually, in margin trading, the loan is typically based on the value of the security, so as the security's value changes, the loan amount might adjust, but in this case, since it's an initial purchase, the loan is $50 regardless of the price movement.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in margin accounts, the amount you borrow is based on the initial purchase, but as the security's value changes, the equity fluctuates. The loan amount is fixed at $50, but the value of the security changes, so the equity is Security Price - Loan.

So, initially, Security is $100, Loan is $50, so equity is $50. That's correct.

But when the price drops, say to P, the equity becomes P - $50. The maintenance margin is 25%, so the equity must be at least 25% of the current security value.

So, the condition for a margin call is when equity < 25% of P. The margin call occurs when equity equals 25% of P.

So, setting up the equation:

Equity = P - Loan = 25% of P.

But wait, the loan is $50, so:

P - 50 = 0.25 * P

Let me solve for P:

P - 0.25P = 50
0.75P = 50
P = 50 / 0.75
P = 66.666...

So, P is approximately $66.67.

Looking at the options, H is 66.67. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check. If the price is $66.67, then the equity is 66.67 - 50 = 16.67. 25% of 66.67 is 16.6675, which is approximately 16.67. So yes, the equity equals 25% of the security's value, which triggers the margin call.

So the correct answer is H: 66.67.
</think>

The margin call occurs when the equity in the account equals 25% of the security's price. Using the equation \( P - 50 = 0.25P \), solving for \( P \) gives approximately \$66.67. 

Answer: H
