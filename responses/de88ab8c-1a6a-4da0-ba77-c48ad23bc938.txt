Question:

 What two problems does individualism lead us into, according to Hourdequin?

Options:

A: They lead us into "tragedy of the commons" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.
B: It leads to a decline in societal values and the rise of selfish behavior.
C: It encourages a culture of isolation and self-centeredness, and leads to a lack of community engagement.
D: It leads to the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility.
E: It leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods.
F: It leads to a lack of empathy and understanding of others, and an increase in individualistic behavior.
G: It results in increased consumption and waste, and a disregard for the environment.
H: It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.
I: We both tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so think that we can only advocate for policy in "tragedy of the commons" situations.
J: It promotes competition over cooperation and leads to societal fragmentation.

Okay, so I have this question about what two problems individualism leads to, according to Hourdequin. The options are from A to J. I'm not exactly sure who Hourdequin is, but I think it's someone in the field of philosophy or social sciences. I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what individualism is. Individualism is a belief that individuals should be prioritized over the community or state. It emphasizes personal autonomy, self-reliance, and individual rights. Now, the question is about the problems it leads to. I remember that in discussions about individualism, there are common critiques related to social issues.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which makes sense. 

Option A: "They lead us into 'tragedy of the commons' situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons." The tragedy of the commons refers to a situation where individuals acting in their own self-interest deplete a shared resource. So, individualism could lead to this because people might not consider the common good. An atomistic view of persons means seeing individuals as separate and not connected, which aligns with individualism. This seems plausible.

Option B: "It leads to a decline in societal values and the rise of selfish behavior." While individualism is often linked to selfishness, I'm not sure if Hourdequin specifically points out societal values decline as a problem. It's a bit vague.

Option C: "It encourages a culture of isolation and self-centeredness, and leads to a lack of community engagement." This also makes sense because individualism can make people more focused on themselves rather than the community. But again, I'm not sure if this is what Hourdequin says.

Option D: "It leads to the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility." This is a strong critique, but I'm not certain if it's the exact point Hourdequin makes.

Option E: "It leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods." This seems more related to environmental issues, perhaps connected to individualism in terms of consumption, but I'm not sure if Hourdequin ties individualism directly to these environmental problems.

Option F: "It leads to a lack of empathy and understanding of others, and an increase in individualistic behavior." While individualism might reduce empathy, this seems a bit circular since it's about increasing individualism itself.

Option G: "It results in increased consumption and waste, and a disregard for the environment." Similar to E, this might be a side effect but not the primary two problems Hourdequin highlights.

Option H: "It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality." This is more abstract and I'm not sure how it ties directly to the two problems.

Option I: "We both tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so think that we can only advocate for policy in 'tragedy of the commons' situations." This seems a bit more specific. It mentions moral obligations and the tragedy of the commons, which I think are two key points. But I'm not sure if it's two separate problems or just one.

Option J: "It promotes competition over cooperation and leads to societal fragmentation." Competition is a result of individualism, but societal fragmentation might be a broader issue.

Now, thinking about the tragedy of the commons, that's a well-known concept linked to individualism because individuals acting in self-interest can deplete shared resources. So the first problem in option A makes sense. The second part of A is an atomistic view, which means seeing people as separate entities rather than connected. That's a critique of individualism.

Option I also mentions the tragedy of the commons but combines it with moral obligations. It says that people think their obligations are only personal, which could lead them to inaction in common resource situations. But I'm not sure if that's two distinct problems or just one.

Comparing A and I, A talks about two separate issues: the tragedy of the commons and an atomistic view. I is more about the perception of moral obligations and policy advocacy, which might be one problem but phrased differently.

I think the correct answer is A because it clearly states two distinct problems: the tragedy of the commons and an atomistic view. The other options either don't specify two clear issues or are more about side effects rather than the primary problems Hourdequin discusses.

The answer is A. Individualism leads to the tragedy of the commons, where individuals acting in self-interest deplete shared resources, and fosters an atomistic view, seeing people as separate rather than connected.

Answer: A
