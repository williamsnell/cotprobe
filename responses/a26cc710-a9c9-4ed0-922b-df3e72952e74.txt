Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Elkind's theory and Alice's belief. Let me start by recalling what I know about Elkind's work. I remember he did some research on child development, particularly on how children view themselves and others.

The question is about Alice, a 14-year-old who thinks everyone is staring at her because of a big blemish on her forehead. The options given are various psychological concepts, and I need to pick which one Elkind would attribute her belief to.

I think Elkind talked about something called the "imaginary audience." From what I remember, the imaginary audience is the idea that children imagine a group of people are always watching them, especially during self-conscious moments. This makes them feel like they're on stage, and others are evaluating them constantly. So, when Alice feels that everyone is looking at her, that fits the description of the imaginary audience because she's convinced an audience exists, even if it's not real.

Let me go through the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. The "personal fable" is another term from Elkind, but I believe it refers to an adolescent's belief that their experiences are unique and more important than others'. So that's more about uniqueness and personal significance, not necessarily the feeling of being watched.

Theory of mind is about understanding others' mental states, which is more related to empathy and social cognition, not specifically about self-perception. Egocentrism is a broader concept where the self is the center of the universe, but I think the imaginary audience is a subset of that egocentrism specific to adolescence.

Self-concept is about how one sees themselves, but it's a more general term. The looking-glass self refers to how people derive their self-concept from others' perceptions, which is more about social feedback than the illusion of being observed.

Social referencing is about looking to others for cues on how to behave, which is more about learning from others rather than the belief in an audience. Self-conscious emotions are feelings like embarrassment or shame, which are related but not the underlying belief causing them.

Social comparison is about evaluating oneself relative to others, which doesn't directly address the feeling of being stared at. So, putting it all together, the best fit is the imaginary audience because it's about the belief that an audience is constantly watching and judging, which is exactly what Alice is experiencing.
