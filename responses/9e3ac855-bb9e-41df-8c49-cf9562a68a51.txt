Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about equity versus bonds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which statement is true of equity but not of bonds. There are nine options, labeled A through I. I'll go through each one and see which applies.

First, I need to recall the basics. Equity refers to stocks or shares that represent ownership in a company, while bonds are a form of debt where the issuer borrows money from the investor and agrees to pay back the principal plus interest. 

Let's look at each option:

A: They can be issued by firms. Both firms and governments can issue bonds. Firms definitely issue equity, like stocks. So both equity and bonds can be issued by firms. So A is true for both, so it's not the answer.

B: They can be traded on the secondary market. Yes, both stocks and bonds are traded on secondary markets like the stock exchange. So B is true for both, not the answer.

C: They have a fixed interest rate. Bonds typically have fixed interest rates, called coupons. Equity, like stocks, don't have fixed interest rates; they pay dividends which can vary. So C is true for bonds but not equity. So this isn't the right answer.

D: They cannot be traded on the secondary market. No, both can be traded. So D is false.

E: Their payouts are exempt from corporation tax. Wait, I'm not sure. For bonds, the interest is taxable, but for dividends, they might be taxed differently. Wait, no, I think that in some countries, dividend payouts to shareholders may be taxed, but I'm not certain about corporation tax exemption. Maybe E is about the payouts being exempt from corporation tax when paid by the company. Let me think: when a company pays dividends, it's after paying taxes. So the payout (dividend) itself isn't exempt. Bonds' interest is usually taxable, but I don't think either's payout is exempt. So E might not be correct.

F: They are considered a form of debt. Bonds are debt, but equity isn't. So F is true for bonds but not equity. So F is not the answer.

G: Their payouts (i.e., dividend or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted. For bonds, the interest is paid from the issuer's after-tax income? Wait, no, I think bonds are typically paid before taxes, or maybe not. Wait, when a company issues bonds, the interest is an expense for the company, so it's tax-deductible. So the interest is paid after taxes. For equity, dividends are paid from after-tax profits because the company has already paid taxes on its income. So both dividends and bond coupons are paid after taxes. Hmm, so G would be true for both, making it not the answer.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: For bonds, the interest is an expense for the issuer, so it's deducted before calculating taxable income, meaning the company pays interest from pre-tax income. So the coupon is paid before taxes, whereas dividends are paid after taxes. So for G, which says payouts are made after tax, that would be true for equity (dividends) but not for bonds (coupons). So G would be true for equity but not bonds. So G could be the answer.

H: They are issued by government entities. Both bonds and equity can be issued by government entities. For example, government bonds and, in some cases, government-owned companies issuing equity. So H is true for both, not the answer.

I: Their payouts (i.e., dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted. So for bonds, as I thought earlier, the interest is paid before taxes, so the coupon is an expense that reduces taxable income. Therefore, the coupon is paid from pre-tax income. For equity, dividends are paid after the company has paid taxes, so they come from after-tax profits. So I is true for bonds but not for equity. So I is not the answer.

Wait, but the question is about what's true of equity but not bonds. So looking back, the options:

G: Equity payouts (dividends) are after tax. Bonds' coupons are before tax. So G is true for equity but not bonds. So G is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for G, both are after tax, but now I'm correcting myself. So G is true for equity but not for bonds, making it the correct answer.

The correct answer is G. Equity payouts (dividends) are made after corporation tax, whereas bond interest (coupons) is typically paid before taxes. 

Answer: G
