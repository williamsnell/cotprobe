Okay, so I need to figure out the due date for a federal estate tax return, specifically Form 706, when the taxpayer died on May 15 in year 2. The question says that no extension was requested, so I don't have to consider any delays there.

First, I remember that estate tax returns have a specific filing deadline. I think it's related to the decedent's death date. Normally, for an individual's income tax return, the deadline is April 15 of the following year, but estate taxes might be different.

Wait, I think the estate tax return is due nine months after the person's death. So if someone died on May 15, adding nine months to that date would be the due date. Let me calculate that. May 15 plus nine months would take us through the year. May to December is seven months, and then adding two more months would bring us to January 15 of the next year. Wait, no, that can't be right because May plus nine months would be February 15 of the next year. Let me check that again.

Wait, May has 31 days, so May 15 plus one month is June 15. Then adding another eight months: June (1), July (2), August (3), September (4), October (5), November (6), December (7), January (8). So that's eight months, bringing us to January 15 of the next year. But wait, that's only eight months. Oh, wait, no, because the first month after May is June, so May 15 plus nine months would be February 15 of the following year because May to February is seven months, but adding nine months would actually land in February of the next year. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. I think the standard due date is nine months from the date of death. So May 15 plus nine months. Let's count: May (1), June (2), July (3), August (4), September (5), October (6), November (7), December (8), January (9). So nine months after May 15 would be January 15 of the next year, which is year 3. But looking at the options, I don't see January 15, year 3 as an option. Wait, the options are:

A: Oct 15, year2
B: April 15, year3
C: Jan 31, year3
D: Nov 15, year2
E: Dec 31, year2
F: May 15, year3
G: March 15, year3
H: Feb 15, year3
I: Sep 15, year2
J: Aug 15, year2

Wait, so if the due date is nine months after death, which would be February 15, year3, because May 15 plus nine months is February 15 of the next year. But looking at the options, H is February 15, year3. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I thought the estate tax return was due nine months after death, which would be in the same year. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with the gift tax or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the due date is the same as the individual's tax return, which is April 15 of the following year, but for estate taxes, it's different. Wait, I think the estate tax return is due nine months after death, which would be February 15, year3 in this case. But looking at the options, H is February 15, year3. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's count it again. Starting from May 15, year2:

Adding one month: June 15, year2 (1)
July 15 (2)
August 15 (3)
September 15 (4)
October 15 (5)
November 15 (6)
December 15 (7)
January 15, year3 (8)
February 15, year3 (9)

Yes, that's nine months. So the due date would be February 15, year3. Looking at the options, H is February 15, year3. But wait, another thought: sometimes the due date might be extended if certain conditions are met, but the question states that no extension was filed, so we don't consider that.

Alternatively, I might be confusing this with the tax return for the estate, which is Form 706. I think the due date is indeed nine months from the date of death. So the correct answer should be H: February 15, year3.

The due date for a federal estate tax return (Form 706) is nine months after the date of the taxpayer's death. Since the taxpayer died on May 15, year 2, adding nine months leads to February 15, year 3.
