Okay, so I've got this question about neuron membrane potentials. Hmm, let me think. The question says that a change from +50mV to -70mV is considered which of the options. I'm a bit rusty on my neuroscience, but I'll try to remember.

Wait, first, I should recall the different terms related to membrane potentials. So, neurons have resting potentials, action potentials, and various other changes. The resting potential is usually around -70mV, right? So when a neuron is at rest, the membrane potential is about -70mV. 

Now, when a stimulus comes in, the membrane can depolarize, which means the potential becomes less negative, maybe even reaching +50mV. Oh wait, that's the threshold, right? Or is that the action potential? No, the action potential is when it goes up to +40mV or something like that. 

Wait, the change here is from +50mV to -70mV. So the membrane is going from a more positive state back to a more negative state. That's moving away from the threshold. So that's probably repolarization. Because during an action potential, once the depolarization occurs (like going from -70 to +50), the ion channels close, and the membrane starts repolarizing back to -70.

But wait, let me think again. The resting potential is -70mV. If the potential goes to +50, that's a big depolarizationâ€”that's when the action potential starts. Then, after the peak, it goes back down. So when it goes from +50 back to -70, that's repolarization, which is part of the action potential cycle.

So the change described is a movement from a depolarized state back to the resting potential. That process is called repolarization. Looking at the options, J is repolarization. 

I should double-check the other options. Threshold potential is the point where the depolarization triggers an action potential, like +50mV might be the threshold in some cases. But the change here is going past that, so it's not the threshold anymore. 

Graded potentials are the changes in membrane potential that vary with the strength of the stimulus, like in dendrites or the cell body. Action potential is the all-or-none response, so that's when it goes up to +40 or so. 

So yeah, the change from +50 to -70 is definitely repolarization. So the answer should be J.

The change in membrane potential from +50mV to -70mV represents the process of repolarization, where the membrane returns to its resting state after depolarization. 

Answer: J
