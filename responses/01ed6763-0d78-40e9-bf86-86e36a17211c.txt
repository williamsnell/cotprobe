Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the minimum number of base substitutions needed to change certain codons from one amino acid to another. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that each amino acid is encoded by one or more codons, which are sequences of three nucleotides. Each position in the codon can vary, and different changes can lead to different amino acids. To find the minimum substitutions, I need to look for codons that are as similar as possible between the starting amino acid and the target amino acid.

Let's break down each part of the question:

a) Glutamic acid to lysine.
b) Leucine to alanine.
c) Phenylalanine to glycine.
d) Tryptophan to serine.
e) Valine to glutamic acid.

For each of these, I need to find the codons for the starting amino acid and see if any of them can be changed with the fewest substitutions to reach a codon for the target amino acid.

Starting with part a) glutamic acid (Glu) to lysine (Lys). Glutamic acid has several codons: GAA, GAG, GGA, GGG. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Actually, the standard codon chart says Glu is GAA and GAG. Lys is AAA and AAG.

So, let's see: If we have GAA and want to change it to AAA. Let's look at each codon:

GAA to AAA: G vs A in the first position, A vs A in the second, A vs A in the third. So the first base needs to change from G to A. That's one substitution. So that's possible with just one change. So a) requires 1 substitution.

Next, part b) leucine to alanine. Leucine has codons like UUA, UUG, CUU, CUA, CUG, UCU. Alanine is GCA, GCU, GCC, GCG.

Looking for a codon that's as close as possible. Let's take leucine's UUA. To change to alanine. Let's see: UUA to GCA. Let's compare each position.

First base: U to G → that's a change. Second: U to C → another change. Third: A to A → no change. So two substitutions needed. Alternatively, are there any leucine codons that can change with fewer substitutions?

Wait, let's check another leucine codon. How about UUG? To get to alanine's GCU, for example. UUG to GCU. First base U→G (change), second U→C (change), third G→U (change). That's three changes, which is worse.

Another option: Leucine's CUU. Let's see if any alanine codons have similar bases. Alanine's GCU: CUU vs GCU. First C→G (change), second U→C (change), third U→U (no). So two changes again. So seems like two substitutions are needed for leucine to alanine.

Hmm, but wait, maybe another approach. Let's see if any leucine codon can be changed with only one substitution to an alanine codon. Let's think: Leucine has codons like UUA, UUG, etc. Alanine is GCA, GCU, etc.

Looking for a case where only one base change would work. Suppose we have a leucine codon where only one base is different from an alanine codon. Let me think, for example, leucine's UUA (which is a leucine) and alanine's GUA? Wait, no, GUA is valine. Wait, GCU is alanine. So UUA (leucine) to GCU (alanine). Comparing each base:

U (1) → G (change), U (2) → C (change), A (3) → U (change). So three changes. That's worse.

Wait another idea: Maybe a leucine codon that's only one base away from an alanine codon. Let's see. Are there any overlapping codons? For example, if a leucine codon is UUA, could changing the first U to G make it GUA, but that's valine, not alanine. Changing the second U to C would make it UCA, which is serine. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another codon. Let's take leucine's UUG. To change to GCA (alanine). UUG → GCA: first U→G (change), second U→C (change), third G→A (change). No, that's three changes. Alternatively, changing UUG to GCU: that would be U→G (first), U→C (second), G→U (third). Again three changes.

Wait, what about leucine's CUA? CUA is leucine. Alanine's GCA is one possibility. CUA → GCA: first C→G (change), second U→C (change), third A→A (no change). So two substitutions. So it seems that two substitutions are needed for leucine to alanine.

Wait, but I might be missing something. Let me think again. Maybe I should look up the codon tables again, but since I can't, I'll proceed.

Part c) Phenylalanine to glycine. Phenylalanine's codons are UUU and UUA? Wait, no, wait. No, UUA is leucine. Let me correct that. Phenylalanine is UUU and UUF (but F is phenylalanine). Wait, no, more accurately, phenylalanine is UUU, UUF (but F is phenylalanine). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: The standard codon chart says phenylalanine is UUU and UUF, but actually, F is phenylalanine, so UUU and UUF. But wait, UUF is not a standard codon; perhaps it's better to just think of UUU and UUF as phenylalanine. Wait, no, more accurately, the standard codons are UUU and UUF, but F is just another symbol for phenylalanine. Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with UUU and UUF as the codons for phenylalanine.

Glycine has codons like GGG, GGA, GGC, GGT, etc.

So, let's take phenylalanine's UUU. What's the closest glycine codon? Let's compare each position.

Looking for a glycine codon that's as close as possible. Let's see, glycine can have any base in the third position, but the first two are G and G. So, UUU (Phe) to GGG (Gly): all three bases change. That's three substitutions. But perhaps there's a closer codon.

Wait, another approach: Let's look for a codon where only two bases need to change. For example, UUU → GGG would require all three bases changing, which is three substitutions. But maybe there's a way to change only two.

Wait, perhaps UUU can be changed to GGT. Let me see: UUU to GGT. First U→G (change), second U→G (change), third U→T (change). No, that's three changes again.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's see if any phenylalanine codon can be changed with only one substitution to a glycine codon. Let me think, phenylalanine's UUU. If I change the first U to G, it becomes G UU, which is G UU. Wait, what's G UU? That's valine, right? Because valine's codons are GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG. So changing the first U to G in UUU would make it GUU, which is valine, not glycine.

Alternatively, changing the second U to G: UGU. Wait, UGU is cysteine. Hmm, not helpful.

Changing the third U to G: UUG. UUG is leucine. Hmm, that's not helpful either.

Wait, perhaps another phenylalanine codon? Let's see, phenylalanine is also UUF, but that's the same as UUU. So perhaps the only way is to make two substitutions. Let me think again: UUU to GGG requires three substitutions. But maybe another approach: Let's see if we can find a glycine codon that's two bases away from a phenylalanine codon.

Wait, perhaps if we change two bases, but in such a way that the third base doesn't matter because glycine's third base is variable. For example, changing UUU to GGG would require three changes, but maybe changing UUU to GGT would still be two changes. Wait, no, because the third base in GGT is T, not U. So, UUU to GGT would require changing the first two Us to Gs, and the third U to T, which is three changes.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, let's think about other possibilities. What about changing UUU to GGA? That would require changing the first two Us to Gs, and the third U to A. That's three changes again.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's look for a codon where only one base change is needed. For example, if a phenylalanine codon can be changed to a glycine codon by altering just one base. Let me think: Suppose we have UUU (Phe) and want to change it to GGT (Gly). That's three changes. Or perhaps another codon. Wait, maybe if the third base doesn't matter. Let me think, if I change the first U to G, making it G UU, which is valine. Not helpful. Alternatively, if I change the second U to G, making it UGU, which is cysteine. No. Changing the third U to G or A would make it UUA (leucine) or UUG (leucine). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me think: Glycine's codons are all GGN, where N can be any base. So, to get from a phenylalanine codon (UUU or UUF) to a glycine codon (GGN), we need to change the first two Us to Gs. So that's two substitutions, and the third base can stay the same or change, but to minimize, perhaps keeping it the same. Wait, but UUU's third base is U, and if we change the first two to G, the third would be U, making it G G U, which is GGU, which is glycine. So wait, changing UUU to GGU would require two substitutions: first U to G, second U to G. The third U can stay as U, so GGU is glycine. So that's two substitutions. So part c) would require two substitutions.

Wait, that makes sense. Because changing the first two Us to Gs would make the codon GGU, which is glycine. So only two substitutions are needed. So part c) is two substitutions.

Wait, but earlier I thought it might require three, but this seems to be two. So I need to correct that.

Moving on to part d) Tryptophan to serine. Tryptophan's codons are UGG and sometimes others, but mainly UGG. Serine's codons are AGA, AGC, GAG, GCT, etc. Wait, no, let me correct that. Serine's codons are UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, AGC.

So, starting with tryptophan's UGG. Let's see if any serine codon is close.

Looking at AGU: UGG to AGU. First U→A (change), second G→G (no change), third G→U (change). So two substitutions needed.

Alternatively, looking at UCA: UGG to UCA. First U→U (no change), second G→C (change), third G→A (change). That's two substitutions as well.

So the minimum is two substitutions for tryptophan to serine.

Wait, but wait another thought: Are there any serine codons that require only one substitution from UGG? Let's see, UGG to UGC. UGC is cysteine, not serine. UGG to UGU is also cysteine. Wait, AGU is serine. So UGG to AGU: first U→A, second G→G, third G→U. So two changes.

Alternatively, UGG to UGA is stop codon, which is not helpful. So yes, two substitutions needed.

Lastly, part e) Valine to glutamic acid. Valine's codons are GUA, GUU, GUG, GUS (wait, no, S is serine). So valine is GUU, GUA, GUG, GUS? No, wait. Valine is GUU, GUA, GUG, and maybe GUS? Wait, no, I think it's GUU, GUA, GUG, and maybe others. Wait, more accurately, valine's codons are GUU, GUA, GUG, and GUS? No, S is serine. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again: Valine is encoded by GUU, GUA, GUG, and GUS is not a standard codon; that's probably a mistake. So valine's codons are GUU, GUA, GUG, and also GUS? No, I think it's just GUU, GUA, GUG, and maybe GUS is incorrect. So, valine is GUU, GUA, GUG, and GUS is not a standard codon. So, to get to glutamic acid, which is GAA and GAG.

So, let's take valine's GUU. Let's see if we can change it to GAA. GUU to GAA: first G→G (no change), second U→A (change), third U→A (change). So two substitutions needed.

Alternatively, changing GUU to GAG: GUU → GAG. First G→G, second U→A, third U→G. So two substitutions again.

Is there a way to do it with just one substitution? Let's see. Suppose we have GUU, and change the second U to A. That would make GAA, which is glutamic acid. So that's only one substitution. Wait, that's possible! Because changing the second base from U to A would make it GAA, which is glutamic acid.

Wait, so that's correct. So for valine to glutamic acid, changing the second U to A would suffice. So only one substitution needed.

Wait, but wait. Valine's codons are GUU, GUA, GUG, etc. So if we take GUU and change the second U to A, we get GAA (glutamic acid). So yes, one substitution.

Wait, but let me double-check. GUU is valine. Changing the second U to A would make it GAA, which is definitely glutamic acid. So yes, just one substitution.

Wait, but earlier I thought about changing the third U to A, but that's not necessary if the second U can be changed. So part e) requires only one substitution.

Wait, but let me confirm. The codons:

Valine: GUU, GUA, GUG, etc.

Glutamic acid: GAA, GAG.

So, GUU → GAA: change the second U to A. That's one substitution.

Yes, that works.

So, summarizing:

a) Glu to Lys: 1 substitution.

b) Leu to Ala: 2 substitutions.

c) Phe to Gly: 2 substitutions.

d) Trp to Ser: 2 substitutions.

e) Val to Glu: 1 substitution.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option F says:
F: 2 for Glu to Lys, 1 for Leu to Ala, 1 for Phe to Gly, 2 for Trp to Ser, 2 for Val to Glu.

Wait, but according to my analysis, Val to Glu requires 1 substitution, not 2.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Looking for the option where a) is 1, b) 2, c) 2, d) 2, e) 1.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 2 for Glu to Lys, 1 for Leu to Ala, 1 for Phe to Gly, 2 for Trp to Ser, 2 for Val to Glu.

Wait, no. Because Val to Glu is 1, not 2. So option F is incorrect.

Looking at option I:

I: 1 for Glu to Lys, 2 for Leu to Ala, 2 for Phe to Gly, 1 for Trp to Ser, 1 for Val to Glu.

Wait, but according to my analysis, Trp to Ser requires 2 substitutions. So option I says 1 for Trp to Ser, which is incorrect.

Option F: Let me check again.

Option F: 2 for Glu to Lys, 1 for Leu to Ala, 1 for Phe to Gly, 2 for Trp to Ser, 2 for Val to Glu.

Wait, but according to my analysis, Val to Glu is 1 substitution, so F's answer for e) is 2, which is wrong.

Option H: 1 for Glu to Lys and Trp to Ser, 3 for the rest.

Hmm, but my analysis shows a) 1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)1. So none of the options perfectly match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the parts.

Wait, let me double-check each part again.

a) Glu (GAA) to Lys (AAA): change G to A in first position. So 1 substitution. Correct.

b) Leu (e.g., UUA) to Ala (GCA): changing UUA to GCA would require changing first U to G (1), second U to C (2), third A remains A. So two substitutions. Correct.

c) Phe (UUU) to Gly (GGU): changing first two Us to Gs. So two substitutions. Correct.

d) Trp (UGG) to Ser (AGU): changing first U to A (1), third G to U (2). So two substitutions. Correct.

e) Val (GUU) to Glu (GAA): change second U to A. So one substitution. Correct.

So looking for an option where:

a) 1

b) 2

c) 2

d) 2

e) 1

Looking at the options:

Option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1 (which is wrong, should be 2), e)1.

Option E: 2 for all, which doesn't fit.

Option J: 3 for a), which is wrong.

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3, which is incorrect.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1, e)1.

But d) should be 2, so I is incorrect.

Option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part d). Let me double-check.

Trp is UGG. To change to Ser, which codons are available?

AGU is serine. So UGG → AGU: first U→A, second G→G, third G→U. So two substitutions.

Alternatively, UGG → UCA: first U→U, second G→C, third G→A. Two substitutions.

So d) should be two substitutions.

Looking at the options, the only one that fits a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)1 is not present. But let me check the options again.

Option F: 2 for Glu to Lys (wrong), 1 for Leu to Ala (correct), 1 for Phe to Gly (correct in my earlier analysis but I think I made a mistake), 2 for Trp to Ser (correct), 2 for Val to Glu (wrong).

Wait, earlier I thought Phe to Gly required two substitutions, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me check again.

Phe is UUU. Gly is GGU. So changing UUU to GGU requires changing first two Us to Gs. That's two substitutions. So c) is two substitutions.

So the correct numbers are a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)1.

Looking at the options, which option has these numbers?

Option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1 (wrong), e)1.

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3.

Option F is the closest but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part e).

Wait, Val is GUU. Glu is GAA. So changing the second U to A. That's one substitution. So e) is 1.

So looking back, the correct substitution counts are:

a) 1

b) 2

c) 2

d) 2

e) 1

Looking at the options, the only option that fits all except one is option F, but a) is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part a).

Wait, part a) Glu to Lys. Glu is GAA, Lys is AAA.

So GAA to AAA: first G→A (1 substitution), others same. So yes, one substitution.

So looking again at the options, perhaps none of them exactly match, but let me check option F again.

Option F says:

F: 2 for Glu to Lys, 1 for Leu to Ala, 1 for Phe to Gly, 2 for Trp to Ser, 2 for Val to Glu.

Wait, but according to my analysis, a) is 1, but F says 2. So F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part a). Let me think again. Are there any codons for Lys that are only one base away from Glu's codon?

Glu's codons are GAA and GAG. Lys's are AAA and AAG.

So, GAA → AAA: change first G to A. That's one substitution.

Alternatively, GAG → AAG: change first G to A and second G to A? Wait, no, GAG to AAG would require changing the first G to A and the second G to A. Wait, no, GAG is G A G. Changing to A A G (AAG), which is lysine. So GAG → AAG would require changing the first G to A (1 substitution), and the second A remains A. Wait, no, GAG has GAA as the first two bases? Wait, no. GAG is G A G. So to change to AAG, first G→A (1), second A→A (no change), third G→G (no change). Wait, no, AAG is AAA and AAG.

Wait, GAG is G A G. To change to AAG, which is lysine, we need to change the first G to A. So that's one substitution. So yes, one substitution is sufficient.

So a) is 1 substitution.

Looking back, none of the options perfectly match the substitution counts I have. Let me check the options again.

Option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1 (wrong), e)1.

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3.

Option F is the only one that has b)1, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part c). Let me think again about Phe to Gly.

Phe is UUU. Gly is GGG, GGA, etc.

If I change UUU to GGG, that's three substitutions. But if I change UUU to GGU, that's two substitutions: first two Us to Gs, third U remains U. So Gly's codon GGU is valid, so two substitutions.

So part c) is two substitutions.

Hmm. I think I have to go with the option that matches as much as possible, but perhaps I made a mistake in one part.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part e). Let me think again. Valine is GUU, and glutamic acid is GAA.

So changing the second U to A would make it GAA. So that's one substitution. So e) is 1.

So the correct substitution counts are:

a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)1.

Looking at the options, none have all these numbers. But let me check each option again.

Option F: F says a)2, which is wrong.

Option I: I says a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1, e)1. So d) is wrong.

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3.

Option F is the only one that has b)1, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part d). Let me think again about Trp to Ser.

Trp is UGG. Serine's codons include AGU.

So UGG → AGU: first U→A (1), third G→U (2). So two substitutions.

Alternatively, UGG → UGA is a stop codon, which is not helpful. So two substitutions are needed.

So d) is two substitutions.

Hmm. I think the correct answer is not present in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option F has:

F: 2 for Glu to Lys, 1 for Leu to Ala, 1 for Phe to Gly, 2 for Trp to Ser, 2 for Val to Glu.

But according to my analysis, a) is 1, so F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part a). Let me think again. Are there any codons where changing two bases would lead to a different amino acid with fewer substitutions? No, because GAA to AAA is one substitution.

So I think the correct substitution counts are a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)1.

Looking at the options, the only one that comes close is option F, but a) is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I need to re-examine the options again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me read them again.

Option F: 2 for Glu to Lys, 1 for Leu to Ala, 1 for Phe to Gly, 2 for Trp to Ser, 2 for Val to Glu.

So according to this, Val to Glu requires two substitutions, but I thought it was one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about Val to Glu.

Valine's codon is GUU. Glutamic acid is GAA.

If I change the second U to A, I get GAA, which is correct. So that's one substitution.

So option F's answer for e) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is F, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in part e), Val to Glu requires two substitutions because the codon is GUU, and to get to GAA, you need to change the second U to A and the third U to A as well? No, because GAA has third A. So no, only the second U needs to change.

Wait, no. GUU to GAA: first G remains, second U→A, third U→A. Wait, no, GAA has third A, so changing third U to A would be another substitution.

Wait, wait, no. To get from GUU to GAA:

GUU → GAA:

First base: G → G (no change).

Second base: U → A (change 1).

Third base: U → A (change 2).

So that's two substitutions.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh no! I think I made a mistake earlier. Because GAA is G-A-A. So starting from GUU (G-U-U), to get to GAA, you need to change the second U to A and the third U to A. So that's two substitutions.

Oh! So I was wrong earlier. So part e) requires two substitutions, not one.

That changes everything.

So let me correct that.

e) Valine to glutamic acid: two substitutions.

So now the substitution counts are:

a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check again.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Valine's codon is GUU.

Glutamic acid's codon is GAA.

So to change GUU to GAA:

Change second U to A → GAA? No, because GAA is G-A-A.

Wait, GUU is G-U-U.

To get to GAA (G-A-A), you need to change the second U to A and the third U to A. So two substitutions.

So e) requires two substitutions.

So now the substitution counts are:

a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2.

Looking at the options, which one has all these numbers?

Looking at option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Option E: All 2, which would fit except a) is 1.

Option H: a)1, d)1 (wrong), others 3.

Option F: a)2, others as per.

Wait, perhaps option E: 2 for all. But a) is 1, so E is incorrect.

Option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all parts again.

a) Glu to Lys: 1 substitution.

b) Leu to Ala: 2 substitutions.

c) Phe to Gly: 2 substitutions.

d) Trp to Ser: 2 substitutions.

e) Val to Glu: 2 substitutions.

So all parts except a) require two substitutions.

Looking for an option where a) is 1, and the rest are 2.

Looking at the options:

Option F: a)2 (wrong), others have 1 or 2.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1 (wrong), e)1 (wrong).

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3.

Option F is the only one that has most parts as 2, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part a). Let me think again.

Glu is GAA. Lys is AAA and AAG.

So GAA to AAA: change first G to A → one substitution.

Alternatively, GAA to AAG: change first G to A and third A to G. That's two substitutions.

But the minimum is one substitution.

So a) is 1 substitution.

So now the substitution counts are a)1, others 2.

Looking for an option where a) is 1, and the rest are 2.

Looking at the options, option F has a)2, which is wrong.

Option I: a)1, but d)1, others vary.

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3.

Option F is the only one with most parts as 2, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part c).

Wait, part c) Phe to Gly: UUU to GGU requires two substitutions. So that's correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps option F is the intended answer, but with a mistake in a).

But I think the correct substitution counts are a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but perhaps option F is the closest, but a) is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part e).

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where a) is 1, and others are 2. Let me check the options again.

Option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Option I: a)1, but others vary.

Option H: a)1, but others are 3 or 1.

Option F is the only one with most parts as 2, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for the option that has a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2.

Looking at the options:

Option F: a)2, others as above.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1, e)1.

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3.

Option F is the only one with four parts as 2, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but a) is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part a).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, considering the closest match.

But according to my analysis, the correct substitution counts are a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine part e). Valine's codon is GUU. Glutamic acid is GAA.

So, to change GUU to GAA, you need to change the second U to A (1 substitution) and the third U to A (another substitution), totaling two substitutions.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the substitution counts are:

a)1

b)2

c)2

d)2

e)2

Looking at the options, the only one that fits is option F, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part a). Let me think again.

Glu's codon is GAA, and Lys is AAA.

So GAA → AAA requires changing first G to A. That's one substitution.

So a) is 1.

Looking again, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part e). Let me think again.

Valine's codon is GUU. To get to GAA, you need to change the second U to A and the third U to A. So two substitutions.

Yes, that's correct.

So, substitution counts are all 2 except a) which is 1.

Looking at the options, the only option that has a)1 and others as 2 is not present. So perhaps the correct answer is option F, but a) is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part a).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking at the options, option F is:

F: 2 for Glu to Lys, 1 for Leu to Ala, 1 for Phe to Gly, 2 for Trp to Ser, 2 for Val to Glu.

But according to my analysis, a) is 1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2.

So the only option that has the majority correct is option F, but a) is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where a) is 1, and others are 2. Let me check the options again.

Option F: a)2, which is wrong.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1 (wrong), e)1 (wrong).

Option H: a)1, d)1, others 3.

Option F is the closest, but a) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part a). Let me think again.

Glu is GAA, Lys is AAA.

GAA → AAA: change first G to A. One substitution.

So a) is 1.

Looking for an option with a)1 and others as 2.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part e). Let me think again.

Valine's codon is GUU. Glutamic acid is GAA.

Changing GUU to GAA requires changing the second U to A and the third U to A. So two substitutions.

Yes.

So, the substitution counts are a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2.

Looking at the options, the only one that has a)1 is option I, but others are wrong.

Option I: a)1, b)2, c)2, d)1, e)1.

So d) and e) are wrong in option I.

Hmm.

I think I might have to go with option F, even though a) is wrong, but perhaps I made a mistake in part a).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where a) is 1, and others are 2.

But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

After rechecking, I think the correct substitution counts are a)1, b)2, c)2, d)2, e)2. Since none of the options match, I might have to choose the closest option, which is option F, but I'm not confident.

The minimum number of base substitutions required for each amino acid change is determined by comparing the codons for the starting and target amino acids. Here's the analysis for each part:

1. **Glutamic acid (Glu) to lysine (Lys):**  
   Glutamic acid codons (GAA, GAG) can be changed to lysine codons (AAA, AAG) with **1 substitution** (e.g., GAA → AAA by changing the first base G to A).

2. **Leucine (Leu) to alanine (Ala):**  
   Leucine codons (e.g., UUA) can be changed to alanine codons (e.g., GCA) with **2 substitutions** (changing UUA to GCA requires altering the first and second bases).

3. **Phenylalanine (Phe) to glycine (Gly):**  
   Phenylalanine codons (UUU) can be changed to glycine codons (GGU) with **2 substitutions** (changing the first two bases from U to G).

4. **Tryptophan (Trp) to serine (Ser):**  
   Tryptophan codons (UGG) can be changed to serine codons (e.g., AGU) with **2 substitutions** (changing UGG to AGU requires altering the first and third bases).

5. **Valine (Val) to glutamic acid (Glu):**  
   Valine codons (GUU) can be changed to glutamic acid codons (GAA) with **2 substitutions** (changing the second and third bases from U to A).

### Final Answer:
The substitution counts are:  
a) 1, b) 2, c) 2, d) 2, e) 2.

The closest matching option is **F**, but it incorrectly states 2 substitutions for Glutamic acid to lysine. Despite this discrepancy, **F** is the best available choice.

**F**
