Question:

Lucy is making gift baskets. She puts 3 apples in each gift basket. Which number sentence shows how to find the total number of gift baskets, b, Lucy can make with 24 apples?

Options:

A: 3 + b = 24
B: b × 3 = 24
C: 24 - 3 = b
D: b ÷ 3 = 24
E: 24 ÷ b = 3
F: 24 + 3 = b
G: 3 × 24 = b
H: b ÷ 24 = 3
I: 3 - b = 24
J: 24 × 3 = b

Okay, so Lucy is making gift baskets, right? And she puts 3 apples in each basket. The question is asking which number sentence shows how to find the total number of gift baskets, b, she can make with 24 apples. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the relationship is between the number of apples and the number of baskets. Since each basket has 3 apples, the total number of apples used will be 3 times the number of baskets. So if there are b baskets, each with 3 apples, the total apples would be 3 × b.

But wait, Lucy has 24 apples in total. That means 3 times the number of baskets equals 24. So mathematically, that's 3 × b = 24. Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this equation.

Let's look at the options one by one. Option A is 3 + b =24. That would mean adding 3 and b gives 24, which doesn't make sense because if she's putting 3 apples in each basket, it's multiplication, not addition. So A is out.

Option B is b ×3=24. That's the same as 3×b=24. So this seems correct. But let me check the others to be sure.

Option C is 24-3=b. That would mean subtracting 3 from 24 to get b, which would be 21. But that doesn't fit the scenario because if each basket has 3 apples, you're dividing the total by 3, not subtracting. So C is wrong.

Option D is b ÷3=24. That would mean b is 24×3=72. But that doesn't make sense because if each basket has 3 apples, the number of baskets should be less than 24, not more. So D is incorrect.

Option E is 24 ÷ b =3. That rearranges to b=24/3=8. Wait, that's actually correct because if 24 divided by the number of baskets is 3, then b is 8. But wait, the question is asking which number sentence shows how to find b. So E is another way to write it, but let's see what B says.

Option B is b×3=24, which is the same as 3b=24, so b=24/3=8. So both B and E are correct in terms of solving for b, but the question is about the number sentence that represents the situation. So in the problem, it's about how many baskets (b) can be made with 24 apples when each basket has 3 apples. So the equation should be apples per basket times number of baskets equals total apples, which is 3×b=24. So B is correct.

Option F is 24 +3 =b. That would be 27=b, which doesn't make sense. So F is wrong.

Option G is 3×24 =b. That's 72=b, which is way off because you can't have 72 baskets with only 24 apples if each takes 3. So G is incorrect.

Option H is b ÷24=3. That would mean b=3×24=72, which is the same as D and G, so wrong.

Option I is 3 - b=24. That would mean b=3-24=-21, which is impossible because baskets can't be negative. So I is wrong.

Option J is 24 ×3 =b. That's 72=b, same as G, which is incorrect.

So the correct equation is option B: b×3=24.

The correct number sentence is B: b × 3 = 24.
