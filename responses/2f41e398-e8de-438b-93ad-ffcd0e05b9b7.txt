Okay, so I need to figure out when the first Buddhist temple was constructed in Japan. Hmm, I remember that Buddhism was introduced to Japan from China or Korea, maybe around the 6th or 7th century. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact date. Let me think about what I know.

Buddhism started in India, right? And it spread to other countries. I think it came to Japan through Korea. There was a period when Korean kingdoms were involved in cultural exchanges with Japan. So maybe during that time, Buddhism was introduced.

I recall that the Asuka period in Japan was around the 6th and 7th centuries, and that's when a lot of cultural and religious changes happened. The first Buddhist temple, I think it's called Asuka-dera. Was that the first one? If so, when was it built?

Looking at the options: A is 325 CE, which seems too early because I think Japan didn't get Buddhism that early. B is 119 CE, even earlier. That doesn't sound right. C is 451 CE, which is still in the 5th century. D is 596 CE, which is in the 6th century. 

Wait, I think the Asuka-dera was built in the late 6th century. So maybe 596 is the correct year. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, some sources might say it was earlier. Let me try to remember any specific events. There's the Koguryo wall paintings from Korea that date back to the 5th century, but when did it actually reach Japan?

I think the official introduction was during the reign of Empress Suiko, who ruled in the late 6th century. So the first temple, Asuka-dera, was probably built around that time, maybe 596 CE. Therefore, option D seems likely.

The first Buddhist temple in Japan, Asuka-dera, was constructed during the Asuka period, which spanned the 6th and 7th centuries. Based on historical records and the reign of Empress Suiko, the construction of Asuka-dera likely occurred around 596 CE. This aligns with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from Korea during that time.

Answer: D
