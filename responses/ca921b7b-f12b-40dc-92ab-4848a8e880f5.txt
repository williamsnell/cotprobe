Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

There are four machines in a factory producing the same product. Each machine contributes a different percentage to the total output. Specifically, Machine A produces 10%, Machine B 20%, Machine C 30%, and Machine D 40%. So, their output percentages are A:10%, B:20%, C:30%, D:40%. 

Now, each machine has a different rate of producing defective items. The defective rates are given as follows: Machine A has a 0.001 defect rate, Machine B 0.0005, Machine C 0.005, and Machine D 0.002. So, A is 0.1%, B is 0.05%, C is 0.5%, and D is 0.2% defective.

The question is: If an item is selected at random and found to be defective, what's the probability that it was produced by each machine? So, we need to find P(Machine A | defective), P(Machine B | defective), P(Machine C | defective), and P(Machine D | defective).

This sounds like a Bayes' Theorem problem. Bayes' Theorem helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the machine, and B is the event that the item is defective. So, for each machine, we calculate P(Machine | defective) = [P(defective | Machine) * P(Machine)] / P(defective).

First, I need to find the overall probability of an item being defective, P(defective). Since each machine contributes a certain proportion to the total output and has its own defective rate, we can calculate the total defective rate by summing up the product of each machine's output percentage and its defective rate.

Let me break that down:

P(defective) = (P(A) * P_def_A) + (P(B) * P_def_B) + (P(C) * P_def_C) + (P(D) * P_def_D)

Where P(A) is 0.10, P(B) 0.20, P(C) 0.30, P(D) 0.40.

So plugging in the numbers:

P(defective) = (0.10 * 0.001) + (0.20 * 0.0005) + (0.30 * 0.005) + (0.40 * 0.002)

Let me calculate each term:

0.10 * 0.001 = 0.0001
0.20 * 0.0005 = 0.0001
0.30 * 0.005 = 0.0015
0.40 * 0.002 = 0.0008

Adding them up: 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002; 0.0002 + 0.0015 = 0.0017; 0.0017 + 0.0008 = 0.0025.

So P(defective) = 0.0025.

Now, for each machine, I'll compute P(Machine | defective) using Bayes' Theorem.

Starting with Machine A:

P(A|defective) = [P(defective|A) * P(A)] / P(defective)
= (0.001 * 0.10) / 0.0025
= 0.0001 / 0.0025
= 0.04

So 0.04 is 4/100, which simplifies to 1/25.

Wait, 0.04 is 1/25? Wait, no. 1/25 is 0.04, yes. So Machine A's probability is 1/25.

Next, Machine B:

P(B|defective) = (0.0005 * 0.20) / 0.0025
= 0.0001 / 0.0025
= 0.04
= 1/25.

Wait, that's the same as A? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again.

0.0005 * 0.20 = 0.0001. Divided by 0.0025 is 0.04. Yes, so 1/25.

Wait, that's the same as A, but looking at the options, some have different probabilities for A and B. Let me proceed.

Machine C:

P(C|defective) = (0.005 * 0.30) / 0.0025
= 0.0015 / 0.0025
= 0.6
= 3/5.

Wait, 0.6 is 3/5. So P(C|defective) is 3/5.

Machine D:

P(D|defective) = (0.002 * 0.40) / 0.0025
= 0.0008 / 0.0025
= 0.32
= 8/25.

Wait a second, 0.32 is 8/25 because 8 divided by 25 is 0.32. Yes.

So the probabilities are:

A: 1/25
B: 1/25
C: 3/5
D: 8/25

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches these probabilities.

Option E says:
E: P(M1|M) = 1/25, P(M2|M)=1/25, P(M3|M)=3/5, P(M4|M)=8/25.

Wait, but in option E, P(M3|M) is 3/5, which is 0.6, and P(M4|M) is 8/25, which is 0.32. That matches exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Let me look at each option.

Option E: P(M1|M)=1/25, P(M2|M)=1/25, P(M3|M)=3/5, P(M4|M)=8/25. That's exactly what I got.

Wait, but let me check if I've got the machines correct. The problem refers to machines A, B, C, D as M1, M2, M3, M4. So in the options, M1 is A, M2 is B, M3 is C, M4 is D.

So yes, the probabilities I computed match option E. So the answer should be option E.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Rechecking P(defective):

Machine A: 0.1 * 0.001 = 0.0001
Machine B: 0.2 * 0.0005 = 0.0001
Machine C: 0.3 * 0.005 = 0.0015
Machine D: 0.4 * 0.002 = 0.0008
Total P(defective) = 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002; +0.0015 = 0.0017; +0.0008 = 0.0025. Correct.

For each machine:

A: (0.001 * 0.1)/0.0025 = 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04 → 1/25.
B: (0.0005 * 0.2)/0.0025 = 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04 → 1/25.
C: (0.005 * 0.3)/0.0025 = 0.0015 / 0.0025 = 0.6 → 3/5.
D: (0.002 * 0.4)/0.0025 = 0.0008 / 0.0025 = 0.32 → 8/25.

Yes, that's correct. So the probabilities are as in option E.

The problem requires applying Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that a defective item was produced by each machine. By calculating the overall defective rate and then applying Bayes' formula for each machine, the probabilities are found to match option E.
