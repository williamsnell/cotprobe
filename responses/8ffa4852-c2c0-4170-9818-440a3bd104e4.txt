Question:

A woman was the fee simple owner of a 20-acre tract of land. When the woman moved to another state, a man took possession of the tract. The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?

Options:

A: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional seven years, or until the son reaches the age of 25.
B: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.
C: The man has acquired title by adverse possession.
D: The man will acquire title by adverse possession only if the son does not claim the land before he turns 18.
E: The man has not acquired title by adverse possession because the woman was not aware of his possession at the time of her death.
F: The man has not acquired title by adverse possession because the son was a minor at the time of the woman's death.
G: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.
H: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12years, or nine years after the son attains the ageof 18.
I: The man will acquire title by adverse possession only if he continues in possession for a total of 30 years.

Okay, so I have this law question about adverse possession, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the facts are that a woman owned a 20-acre tract in fee simple. She moved to another state, and a man took possession. The man has always complied with the adverse possession statute. Twelve years later, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as the only heir. Nine years after her death, when the son is 15, the guardian finds out the man is still there.

The statutory period is 20 years, and the age of majority is 18.

So, the question is about whether the man has acquired title by adverse possession, and what the current state of title is.

First, I remember that adverse possession requires the possessor to meet certain conditions: open, continuous, hostile, and actual possession for the statutory period. Here, it says the man's possession has always complied with the statute, so the first 12 years are done, but wait, the woman died after 12 years. Now, the son is the heir. Does that affect anything?

Wait, the man has been in possession for 12 years when the woman dies. The statutory period is 20, so he needs 8 more years. But the woman's son is the heir. Now, when the son turns 15, which is after 9 years from the woman's death, so the son is now 15.

Wait, the timeline: woman moved, man took possession. 12 years later, woman died. Then, 9 years after death, son is 15. So total time from the man's possession: 12 +9=21 years? Wait no, because the 9 years after death would be after the initial 12 years. So the man has been in possession for 12 years, and then 9 more after the woman's death, making it 21 years total. But the statutory period is 20. So if he's already reached 20, he would have acquired title? But wait, the problem says that the guardian discovered this when the son was 15, which is 9 years after the woman's death.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recount. The woman owned the land, moved away. Man took possession. After 12 years, woman died, leaving her son as heir. Then, nine years later (so 9 years after her death), the son's guardian finds out. So the total time from when the man took possession is 12 +9=21 years. But the statute is 20. So the man has been in possession for more than 20 years. So, he would have acquired title by adverse possession, right?

But wait, the issue is that the woman's son is the heir. Does the son's claim affect the adverse possession? Because when the woman died, the son became the owner, but he was a minor. So the adverse possession clock might reset when the true owner (the son) comes into being.

Wait, that's a key point. Adverse possession requires that the possessor's claim be adverse to the true owner. So, when the woman died, the son became the owner. But the man was in possession. If the son is a minor, can he take action? Or does the statute require that the adverse possession run against the current owner?

I think that when the woman died, the son became the owner, so now the man is in adverse possession against the son. But the son was a minor, so maybe the period starts over when the son reaches majority. Or maybe the period continues.

Wait, let me think. Adverse possession is against the interest of the true owner. So when the woman died, the son became the owner. So the man's possession is now adverse to the son's interest. But the son was a minor, so he couldn't take action until he reaches the age of majority. So does the adverse possession period start running from the time the son reaches 18?

Alternatively, the period might continue from when the man started, but in this case, the man had already been in possession for 12 years. So, if the son is now 15, that's 9 years after the woman's death. So the man has been in possession for 21 years. Since the statute is 20, he would have acquired title by then, right?

Wait, but the son was the owner, and the man's possession was adverse to him. But the son was a minor. Does the fact that the son is a minor affect the completion of the adverse period? Let me think. In some jurisdictions, the adverse possession period can be extended if the true owner is a minor or incapacitated. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the question says the son is 15 when the guardian discovers this, which is nine years after the woman's death. So the son is 15, meaning he was 6 when the woman died. So the guardian is now acting on his behalf.

Does the man's possession need to be adverse to the current owner at the time. When the woman was alive, she was the owner, and the man was in adverse possession against her. But when she died, the son became the owner. So the man's possession is now against the son's interest.

But the son was a minor, so he couldn't take any action until he turned 18. So the period of adverse possession would start from when the son could take action. So the man's 12 years of possession were against the woman, and after her death, the man continued for another 9 years, but only 3 of those years would be after the son turned 18 (since the son was 6 when the woman died, so he turned 18 three years after the 9-year mark, but wait, 6 +9=15, so he's 15 when the guardian finds out. So he hasn't turned 18 yet. So he's still a minor.

Wait, no, 6 years old when the woman died. 9 years later, he's 15. So he turns 18 three years after that. So from the woman's death, he's 6, and turns 18 at year 12. So the man's possession from year 12 (woman's death) onward is 9 years, but the son reaches majority at year 12 (6+12=18). So from that point, the man has to continue in possession for the statutory period against the son.

Wait, but the man has already been in possession for 12 years against the woman. Then, after the woman's death, the ownership passes to the son, and the man is in possession against the son. But the son was a minor until he turned 18, so the period may start from when the son can enforce his rights.

So, the man's possession against the woman was 12 years. Then, against the son, he has been in possession for 9 years, but the son only reaches majority at year 12 after the woman's death (so when the son is 18). So as of the time the guardian discovers (when the son is 15), the man has been in possession for 9 years against the son, but the son hasn't reached majority yet. So the man hasn't completed the 20-year period against the son, because he only has 9 years, and the son will be 18 in 3 more years.

Wait, but the statute of limitations is 20 years. So, for the man to acquire title by adverse possession, he must have been in continuous, open, hostile possession for the full 20 years against the true owner. Here, the true owner changed when the woman died. So the first 12 years were against the woman, and the next 9 years against the son. But the son was a minor until 18, so the period against the son starts when the son can enforce his rights.

So, after the woman's death, the man's possession is now against the son. The son can't act until he's 18. So the man's possession against the son needs to be for 20 years. But the man has only been in possession for 9 years against the son. Wait, but the man has already been in possession for 12 years against the woman. Do those years count towards the 20-year period against the son?

I think the rule is that when the true owner changes, the period of adverse possession starts anew. So, the 12 years against the woman don't count towards the 20 years against the son. Because the son is a different owner.

If that's the case, then the man needs to have 20 years of possession against the son. He has only had 9 years so far, and the son is still a minor until he turns 18. So the man needs to continue for another 11 years (since 9 +11=20). But the options don't mention that.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the man needs to continue for three more years or until the son turns 18. But the son is 15, so he needs three more years to reach 18. So if the man continues until the son is 18, that's three years, but that's only 9 +3=12 years. Not enough for 20. So that might not be the case.

Option G says he needs to continue for an additional eight years, making 12 years after the woman's death. 12 +8=20, but I thought the period starts anew against the son.

Option H says he needs to continue for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son is 18. That would be a long time.

Option C says the man has already acquired title. But the man has been in possession for 12 years against the woman, but after her death, the son is the owner, and the man's possession against the son is only 9 years. So that's not enough, unless the 12 years count towards the 20.

Wait, some jurisdictions allow the period to continue when the ownership changes. So if the man has 12 years against the woman, and then continues against the son, the total may add up. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, if the 12 years against the woman count towards the 20, then the man has 12 years, and needs 8 more. So he has nine years after the woman's death, which is 9 years. So 12 +9=21, which is more than 20. So in that case, he has satisfied the 20-year period. But the problem is that the son is the current owner, and the man's possession is now against the son.

But wait, the question is whether the man has acquired title by adverse possession. If the 12 years against the woman and the 9 years against the son add up to 21, which is over 20, then he would have acquired title. But I'm not sure if the periods can be combined.

Alternatively, the period starts anew when the ownership changes. So after the woman's death, the man needs to have 20 years against the son. He has only 9, so he needs 11 more. But in the options, none say that.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says the man has acquired title. If the periods are combined, then yes. But if they must be against the same owner, then no.

Wait, the woman died 12 years after the man took possession. So the man had 12 years against her. Then, when she dies, the son becomes the owner. The man's possession is now adverse to the son. The son is a minor, so he can't take action until he's 18. So the period of adverse possession against the son starts when the son can enforce his rights, i.e., when he turns 18. So from the son's 18th birthday, the man must continue in possession for 20 years. But the man has only been in possession for 9 years since the woman's death. So as of the time the guardian discovers, the man has 9 years against the son, and the son is 15, so 3 more years until 18.

So if the man continues until the son is 18, that's 12 years in total (9+3), but that's still less than 20. So he needs 20 years after the son turns 18. Or, if the period starts when the son turns 18, he needs 20 years from that point. Since the son is 15 when the guardian finds out, he'll reach 18 in 3 years. So the man needs 20 years from the son's 18th birthday. But that's more than the options suggest.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: Man needs to continue for 3 more years or until son is 18. That would mean that the period is 20 years starting from when the son turns 18, but that's not matching. Wait, no. The option says he needs to continue for three more years (so until the son is 18) or until the son reaches 18. So if the man continues until the son is 18, that's three years, but that's not enough for 20. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option G: Additional eight years, making 12 after woman's death. 12+8=20. So if he needs 20 years after the woman's death, but the ownership changed, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 years against the woman are sufficient. If the woman was the owner, and the man took possession, and after 12 years, he would have needed 8 more years to reach 20. But she died, so the ownership passed to the son. So the man's possession is now against the son. Since the son was a minor, the period against the son starts when the son turns 18. So the man needs to continue for 20 years after the son turns 18. But the options don't mention that.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the man's possession against the woman was 12 years, and the period needed is 20. So he needs 8 more years. But since the woman died, and the son is now the owner, the man's possession is now against the son. The son is a minor, so the period can't start until the son reaches 18. So the man needs to continue in possession for 8 years after the son turns 18. So the total time would be 12 (against the woman) + 3 (until son is 18) +8=23, which is more than 20. But the question is whether he has already acquired title.

Wait, but the man has already been in possession for 12 years against the woman. Then, after the woman's death, he continues for another 9 years against the son. If the periods can be combined, then 12+9=21, which is over 20. So he would have acquired title by adverse possession. But that depends on whether the periods can be added.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions require that the adverse possession be against the same true owner for the full period. So the 12 years against the woman don't count towards the 20 against the son. So the man would need to have 20 years against the son, which he hasn't yet.

But the options don't have that. Option C says the man has acquired title. If the 12 years count, that's possible. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, when the woman died, the man's possession became adverse to the son. The son was a minor, so the period didn't start until the son turned 18. So the man had 12 years against the woman, but after her death, he needed to have 20 against the son. Since he only had 9 against the son, and the son is 15 now, he still needs 11 more years. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the man hasn't acquired title because the son was a minor at the time of the woman's death. So the period couldn't run against the son until he turned 18. So the man's possession against the son hasn't reached the 20 years yet. So the man hasn't acquired title. But the options don't have that, except option F, which says he hasn't acquired because the son was a minor.

But I thought the man needs to have the period run against the current owner. So when the woman dies, the son is the owner, and the man's possession is now adverse to the son. But since the son is a minor, the period starts when the son turns 18. So the man needs to have 20 years from that point.

So as of now, the man has 9 years after the woman's death, which is 9 years against the son, but the son hasn't turned 18 yet. So the man hasn't completed the 20 years. Therefore, he hasn't acquired title yet.

Looking at the options, option B says he needs to continue for three more years or until the son is 18. So if the man continues until the son is 18, that's three more years, making it 12 years against the son. But 12 is less than 20, so he still needs 8 more. But the option says he will not acquire unless he continues for three more years or until the son reaches 18. That doesn't seem right because even if he continues until the son is 18, he still needs 20 years from that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the period starts when the son turns 18, and he needs to continue for 20 years from then. So the time from the son's 18th birthday is what counts. Since the son is 15 now, he'll turn 18 in three years. So the man needs to have 20 years from that point, meaning he needs to continue for 20 years after the son turns 18. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the man will acquire title only if he continues for an additional eight years, making the total 12 years after the woman's death. That's option G. So 12 years after the woman's death, which is the 20-year period, but that's not correct because 12 is less than 20.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to summarize:

- Woman dies after 12 years of man's possession. So against her, he has 12 years. But she dies, so the son becomes owner.

- Adverse possession now runs against the son.

- The son is a minor until 18.

- The period of adverse possession against the son starts when the son turns 18.

- The man needs 20 years from that point.

- As of now, the son is 15, so he'll turn 18 in 3 years.

- The man has been in possession for 9 years since the woman's death, but only 3 of those are after the son could have acted (if the period starts at 18). So he needs 20 years from the son's 18th birthday.

- So the man needs to continue for 20 years from that point, which is more than the options suggest.

But the question is asking about the current state of title. So has the man acquired title yet? Or is he still in the process?

If the man has been in possession for 21 years (12 against the woman, 9 against the son), but the period against the son hasn't completed 20 yet, then he hasn't acquired title.

Alternatively, if the periods can be combined, then 21 years would exceed 20, so he has acquired title. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: The man has acquired title by adverse possession. If the periods are additive, this is correct. But if they must be against the same owner, this is incorrect.

Option G: He needs to continue for an additional eight years, making 12 years after the woman's death. 12+8=20. So the man needs to have 20 years after the woman's death. But the ownership changed, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the period runs against the son, and the son was a minor. So the period can't start until he's 18. So the man needs to have 20 years from the son's 18th birthday. Since the son is 15, the man needs to continue until the son is 38 (18+20=38). But the options don't mention that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the man hasn't acquired title because the son was a minor at the time of the woman's death. So the period couldn't run against the son until he turned 18. So the man's possession against the son is only 9 years, which is less than 20. Therefore, he hasn't acquired title. But option F says that, but I think that's not correct because the woman's death transferred ownership to the son, and the man's possession became adverse to the son, not the woman anymore.

Wait, the issue is whether the period against the woman's estate is sufficient. If the man's possession against the woman was 12 years, which is less than 20, but the woman's death transferred ownership to the son, then the man's possession is now against the son. So the 12 years don't count towards the 20 against the son.

Therefore, the man needs 20 years against the son. He has 9 years so far, and the son is 15. So he needs 11 more years. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options again, option B says he needs to continue for three more years or until the son is 18. That would mean the period is 20 years, but only 12 years (9+3) would have passed, which is still less.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that when the true owner is a minor, the period of adverse possession can be extended. So the man's possession against the son can't start until the son reaches 18. So the period starts when the son turns 18. So the man needs to have 20 years from that point.

So as of now, the man has 9 years after the woman's death. The son is 15, so the son will turn 18 in 3 years. So the man needs to continue for 20 years from that point, meaning 20 -0=20 more years. But the question is, has he acquired title yet? No, because the period hasn't even started against the son yet. So the man hasn't acquired title yet.

But looking at the options, which one fits this scenario.

Option B: He needs to continue for three more years or until the son is 18. So that would mean that the period starts now, and he needs to continue until the son is 18. But that doesn't make sense because the period should start when the son turns 18.

Option G: He needs to continue for eight more years, making 12 in total after the woman's death. That would mean 12 years, but the statute is 20.

Option C: He has acquired title. But I don't think so because the period against the son hasn't been met.

Wait, maybe the answer is option C, because the man has been in possession for 21 years (12 +9), which exceeds the 20-year period. But I'm not sure if the periods can be combined when the ownership changes.

Alternatively, the period must be against the same owner. So the 12 years against the woman don't count, and the man needs 20 against the son. He hasn't completed that yet.

So, the correct answer would be that the man will not acquire title unless he continues for an additional eight years, making the total 20 years after the woman's death. That's option G. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another approach: the woman's death doesn't affect the man's adverse possession against her estate. So the man had 12 years against the woman, and the statutory period is 20. So he needs 8 more years. But the woman's death transferred ownership to the son. Now, the son is the true owner, and the man's possession is adverse to the son. But the son is a minor, so the period can't start until he's 18. So the man needs to have 20 years from when the son turns 18. So as of now, the man has 9 years after the woman's death, but the son is 15. So the man needs to continue until the son turns 18 (3 more years) and then for another 17 years, totaling 20. But the question is about the current state. So the man hasn't acquired title yet.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is that the man hasn't acquired title because the son was a minor. So option F. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is that the man has acquired title because the 12 years against the woman plus the 9 against the son make 21, which is over 20. So option C.

I'm torn between options C and G, but I think the correct answer is option C: the man has acquired title by adverse possession because the total time exceeds 20 years.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the man has acquired title to the tract by adverse possession. The key facts are as follows:

1. The woman owned the land and moved away, allowing the man to take possession.
2. The man has been in open, continuous, and adverse possession for 12 years when the woman dies.
3. The woman's son, aged six at her death, is her sole heir, making him the new owner.
4. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son is 15, the guardian discovers the man's possession.
5. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years, and the age of majority is 18.

### Key Analysis:
- **Adverse Possession Requirements**: To acquire title by adverse possession, the man must maintain open, continuous, hostile, and actual possession for the full statutory period (20 years) against the true owner.
- **Ownership Transition**: When the woman died, ownership passed to her son. At this point, the man's possession became adverse to the son's interest.
- **Minority of the Son**: The son was a minor (age 6) at the time of the woman's death and could not enforce his rights until he reached the age of majority (18). Therefore, the period of adverse possession against the son likely starts when the son turns 18.
- **Elapsed Time**: The man has been in possession for 12 years against the woman and an additional 9 years against the son. However, since the son is a minor, the period of adverse possession against him only begins once he turns 18, which is three years away.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The man does not need to wait until the son reaches 25; the statutory period is 20 years, and the son will reach 18 in three years.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the son will turn 18 in three years, this does not satisfy the 20-year statutory period. The man needs to continue possession for 20 years after the son turns 18.
- **Option C**: Plausible. If the periods of possession against the woman and the son are combined, the man has exceeded the 20-year statutory period (12 + 9 = 21 years). However, some jurisdictions require the period to start anew when the true owner changes, making this less certain.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The man will acquire title if he continues possession for 20 years, not contingent on the son's inaction.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The woman's awareness at death is irrelevant; the focus is on the statutory period and ownership transition.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The son being a minor does not prevent the man from acquiring title if the statutory period is met.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The man needs 20 years of possession against the son, not just 12 years after the woman's death.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The man does not need to wait 12 years after the son turns 18; the statutory period is 20 years.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The man does not need to possess the land for 30 years; the statutory period is 20 years.

### Conclusion:
The most likely answer is **Option C**, as the man has been in possession for more than 20 years in total (12 against the woman and 9 against the son). However, if the period must restart against the son, the correct answer would depend on jurisdictional rules. Given the facts, **Option C** is the best choice.

ANSWER: C
