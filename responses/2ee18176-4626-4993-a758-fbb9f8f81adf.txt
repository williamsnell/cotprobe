Alright, so I've got this question here: What is the order of the group S_3 * Z_2? And there are ten options to choose from, labeled A to J. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First off, I remember that the order of a group is the number of elements in it. So, when they're asking for the order of S_3 * Z_2, they're asking how many elements are in this group. Wait, but what does the * mean here? Is it the direct product of the two groups? I think that's right. So, S_3 is the symmetric group on 3 elements, and Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2. So, the direct product of these two groups would combine each element from S_3 with each element from Z_2.

Okay, so I should find the order of S_3 first. S_3 is the symmetric group on 3 elements, which is the group of all permutations of three objects. The order of S_n is n factorial, so for S_3, that's 3! = 6. Got it. So, S_3 has 6 elements.

Next, Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2. That's straightforward; it has two elements, usually written as {0, 1} under addition modulo 2, or sometimes {e, a} where a has order 2. So, the order of Z_2 is 2.

Now, when you take the direct product of two groups, the order of the resulting group is the product of the orders of the two groups. I think that's a fundamental property. So, the order of S_3 * Z_2 should be |S_3| * |Z_2| = 6 * 2 = 12. That seems right.

Looking at the options, option H is 12. So, I think the answer should be H. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not making any mistakes here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes people might confuse the direct product with other operations, like the free product or the semidirect product. But in this case, the question clearly uses the notation *, which I believe refers to the direct product. So, the order is indeed the product of the two orders.

Also, just to be thorough, S_3 is of order 6 because there are 3! permutations of three elements. And Z_2 is order 2. So, 6 * 2 is 12, which matches option H.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. So, yeah, the answer should be H: 12.

The order of the group \( S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \) is calculated by taking the product of the orders of \( S_3 \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \). The symmetric group \( S_3 \) has order 6, and \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) has order 2. Thus, the order of the direct product is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \).

Answer: H
