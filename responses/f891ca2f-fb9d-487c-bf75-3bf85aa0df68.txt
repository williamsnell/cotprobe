Okay, so I have this question about translating a sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian." I need to pick the best translation from the given options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should break down the sentence. The subject is Abdul and Cleopatra, and the predicate is that they are Egyptian. So, each person (Abdul and Cleopatra) has the property of being Egyptian.

In predicate logic, when we say two things have a certain property, we usually use the conjunction operator. So if I denote E(x) as "x is Egyptian," then Abdul being Egyptian would be E(Abdul) and Cleopatra being Egyptian would be E(Cleopatra). Since both are Egyptian, I need to combine these two statements with "and," which in logic is represented by the dot (•).

So the translation should be E(Abdul) • E(Cleopatra). Now, looking at the options, I need to match this structure.

Looking at the options:

A: Ea • Ec
B: Ea ∨ c
C: Ex • Ey
D: Ex • Ec
E: Ex ∨ Ey
F: Ea • c
G: Ae ∨ Ce
H: Ey • Ec
I: Ae • Ce
J: Ea ∨ Ec

Wait, the way I wrote it is E(Abdul) and E(Cleopatra). So in predicate terms, each would be E applied to a constant. Let me check the notation in the options.

In the options, I see Ea, which probably stands for E(A), where A is Abdul. Similarly, Ec would be E(C), with C being Cleopatra. So option A is Ea • Ec, which translates to E(A) • E(C), which matches the structure I have. That seems correct.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option B uses a disjunction (∨), which would mean either Abdul is Egyptian or Cleopatra is, but not necessarily both. But the original sentence says both are, so it should be a conjunction, not a disjunction. So B is out.

Option C uses Ex and Ey, which might mean E(x) and E(y), but that's using variables instead of constants. The sentence specifically mentions Abdul and Cleopatra, so we should use constants, not variables. So C is incorrect.

Option D uses Ex • Ec, which would be E(x) and E(C). Again, x is a variable, so it's not referring specifically to Abdul. So D is wrong.

Option E uses Ex ∨ Ey, which is again a disjunction and uses variables, so no good.

Option F is Ea • c, but I don't know what 'c' stands for. Maybe it's a constant, but the sentence is about being Egyptian, so it should be E(c), not just 'c'. So F is incorrect.

Option G uses a disjunction again, Ae ∨ Ce. I'm not sure what 'Ae' and 'Ce' mean. Maybe it's a different notation, but it doesn't look like the correct structure. It should be two E predicates connected by 'and', not 'or'.

Option H is Ey • Ec. Ey would mean Cleopatra is Egyptian, and Ec is also Cleopatra? Wait, no, 'Ey' might be a different variable. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. If E is the predicate, then 'Ey' would mean E(y), which is a variable. So H is using a variable and a constant, which doesn't fit our specific case.

Option I is Ae • Ce. Again, I'm not sure what 'Ae' and 'Ce' mean. If 'Ae' is a predicate meaning something else, like perhaps 'A' is a different predicate, but the sentence is about being Egyptian, so it should be E predicates. So I think I is not correct.

Option J is Ea ∨ Ec, which is a disjunction again. So it's either Abdul is Egyptian or Cleopatra is, but not necessarily both. But the original sentence says both are, so J is incorrect.

So going back, the correct translation should be Ea • Ec, which is option A.

The sentence "Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian" translates to predicate logic as two specific individuals (Abdul and Cleopatra) each having the property of being Egyptian, connected by a conjunction. This corresponds to Ea • Ec, where Ea and Ec represent Abdul and Cleopatra being Egyptian, respectively.

Answer: A
