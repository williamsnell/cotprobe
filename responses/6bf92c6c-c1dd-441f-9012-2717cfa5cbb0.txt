Okay, I'm trying to solve this arotameter problem. Let me see what I remember about arotameters. So, an arotameter is a device used to measure volumetric flow rate. It consists of a tapered tube with a float inside that rises or falls depending on the flow rate. The flow rate is calculated using the formula involving the cross-sectional area, the density of the float, and the coefficient of the arotameter.

The problem gives me the following details:

- Length of the tube: 18 inches
- Internal diameters: top is 1.5 inches, bottom is 1.0 inches.
- The cork (float) has a diameter of 1.0 inch, volume of 0.65 in³, and specific gravity of 4.74.
- Volumetric flow rate is 1.80 gpm.
- Coefficient of the arotameter is 0.74.

I need to find the height of the cork from the bottom end of the tube.

First, let me recall the formula for the arotameter. The flow rate (Q) is given by:

Q = K * A * (ρ_f / (ρ_fluid - ρ_f))^(1/2)

Wait, I think that's the general form, but maybe I should look it up again. Alternatively, another version I remember is:

Q = 0.74 * A * sqrt( (2g * h) / (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Q = C * A * sqrt(2g * h / (ρ_fluid - ρ_float)) )

Where C is the coefficient, which here is 0.74.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The flow rate through the arotameter depends on the height of the float. The float is in equilibrium when the buoyant force equals the weight of the float plus the drag force. But maybe for this problem, the formula is simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is:

Q = K * A * sqrt( (2g * h) / (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) )

Where K is the discharge coefficient (0.74 here), A is the area of the float, and h is the height from the bottom.

Wait, but I might have to consider the specific gravity correctly. Let me think about the specific gravity. The specific gravity of the cork is 4.74. Wait, that's higher than water, which has a specific gravity of 1. So, the cork is denser than water. But wait, that can't be right because cork is usually less dense than water. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh wait, perhaps it's the specific gravity of the float relative to some fluid. Wait, no, the specific gravity of the float should be compared to the fluid it's floating in. Wait, but in this problem, perhaps the fluid is water, so the specific gravity of the cork would be 4.74 times that of water. That would make it much denser than water, which doesn't make sense because a cork should float. So maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's the specific gravity of the fluid relative to the float? No, that might not make sense. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem states that the specific gravity of the cork is 4.74. Specific gravity is usually the ratio of the density of the substance to that of water. So, if the cork has a specific gravity of 4.74, its density would be 4.74 times that of water, which is about 4.74 * 62.4 lb/cuft, which is about 295 lb/cuft. That's very dense, much more than water. But that can't be right because a cork should float. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I'm misunderstanding what's given.

Wait, perhaps the specific gravity is given as 4.74 relative to something else, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the specific gravity is that of the fluid, not the float. No, the problem says the cork's specific gravity is 4.74. Hmm, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let's proceed and see.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the specific gravity of the fluid relative to the float. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is expressed in terms of the specific gravity of the float and the fluid. I might be getting this mixed up. Let me try to write down the correct formula.

The correct formula for the arotameter flow rate is:

Q = K * A * sqrt( (2g * h) / (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) )

Where:

- Q is the volumetric flow rate
- K is the coefficient (0.74)
- A is the cross-sectional area of the float
- g is acceleration due to gravity
- h is the height of the float above the bottom
- ρ_fluid is the density of the fluid (assumed to be water here, so 62.4 lb/cuft)
- ρ_float is the density of the float ( cork )

So, first, I can calculate the density of the cork. Specific gravity is 4.74, so ρ_cork = 4.74 * 62.4 lb/cuft ≈ 295.3 lb/cuft.

But wait, that makes the cork heavier than water. So it would sink, which can't be right because the float is supposed to rise with the flow. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the specific gravity is given as 0.474 instead of 4.74. Because 0.474 would make the cork less dense than water, which makes sense. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: specific gravity of 4.74. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed as given. So I'll proceed with 4.74.

Wait, but if the cork is denser than water, then it would sink, which would mean the height h would be at the bottom, but that's impossible because the flow rate is given. So perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Alternatively, maybe the specific gravity is given as 0.474, but I'll proceed as the problem states.

Wait, perhaps the specific gravity is in relation to the fluid. Let me think again. If the fluid is water (specific gravity 1), and the float has a specific gravity of 4.74, that would mean the float is denser, so it would sink, but that can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the specific gravity is 0.474, which would make the float less dense. Let me proceed with 0.474 for the sake of solving the problem, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing specific gravity with density. Let me think: specific gravity is the ratio of the density of the substance to that of water. So if the cork's specific gravity is 0.474, its density is 0.474 * 62.4 lb/cuft ≈ 29.5 lb/cuft, which is much less than water, so it would float. That makes more sense.

But the problem says 4.74, so perhaps that's a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to use the specific gravity differently. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the specific gravity of the fluid relative to the float. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me try to proceed with the given specific gravity of 4.74.

So, the first step is to calculate the area A of the float. The float has a diameter of 1.0 inch, so radius is 0.5 inches. Area A = π r² = π*(0.5)^2 = π*0.25 ≈ 0.7854 in².

Next, I need to find h, the height of the float. The flow rate Q is given as 1.80 gpm. I need to convert this to cubic feet per second because the density is in lb per cubic foot.

1 gallon is 0.1337 ft³, so 1.80 gpm = 1.80 * 0.1337 ft³/min. To convert to per second, divide by 60. So:

Q = 1.80 * 0.1337 / 60 ≈ (0.24066) / 60 ≈ 0.004011 ft³/s.

Wait, let me calculate that again:

1.80 gpm * 0.1337 ft³/gal = 1.80 * 0.1337 = 0.24066 ft³/min.

Convert to per second: 0.24066 / 60 ≈ 0.004011 ft³/s.

Now, plug into the formula:

Q = K * A * sqrt( (2g * h) / (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) )

We can rearrange to solve for h:

h = (Q / (K * A))² * (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) / (2g)

Now, plug in the values:

ρ_fluid (water) = 62.4 lb/ft³

ρ_float (cork) = 4.74 * 62.4 ≈ 295.3 lb/ft³.

Wait, but wait, that would make ρ_float > ρ_fluid, which would mean the float is denser than the fluid, so it would sink. That's impossible because the float is supposed to rise. So perhaps I made a mistake in the specific gravity. Alternatively, maybe I should use the specific gravity as 0.474 instead of 4.74.

Let me try that. If the specific gravity is 0.474, then:

ρ_float = 0.474 * 62.4 ≈ 29.5 lb/ft³.

That makes more sense because it's less dense than water.

So, let's proceed with that.

Now, let's compute h.

h = (Q / (K * A))² * (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) / (2g)

Plugging in the numbers:

Q = 0.004011 ft³/s

K = 0.74

A = 0.7854 in². Wait, but the units need to be consistent. Since ρ is in lb/ft³ and g is in ft/s², I think we need to convert area A to ft².

So, 1 inch = 1/12 ft, so 1 in² = (1/12)^2 ft² = 1/144 ft².

So, A = 0.7854 in² * (1/144) ft²/in² ≈ 0.005454 ft².

Now, compute (Q)/(K*A):

Q/(K*A) = 0.004011 / (0.74 * 0.005454)

First, compute denominator: 0.74 * 0.005454 ≈ 0.004030.

Now, 0.004011 / 0.004030 ≈ 0.995.

Then, square that: (0.995)^2 ≈ 0.990.

Now, compute (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) = 62.4 - 29.5 ≈ 32.9 lb/ft³.

Now, divide by (2g): gravity g is 32.2 ft/s².

So, 32.9 / (2*32.2) = 32.9 / 64.4 ≈ 0.511.

Now, multiply all together:

h = 0.990 * 0.511 ≈ 0.506 ft.

Convert to inches: 0.506 ft * 12 inches/ft ≈ 6.07 inches.

Wait, that's 6.07 inches, but looking at the options, J is 6.0 in. But the options don't have 6.07, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but earlier I assumed the specific gravity was 0.474, but the problem states 4.74. So perhaps I should proceed with the given value, even though it leads to a negative h, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should use the specific gravity correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula uses the specific gravity of the fluid relative to the float. So, specific gravity (SG) = ρ_fluid / ρ_float.

If the float's SG is 4.74, that would mean ρ_float = ρ_fluid / 4.74.

Wait, that would make the float's density less than water, which makes sense because cork floats. So in that case, ρ_float = 62.4 / 4.74 ≈ 13.16 lb/ft³.

Wait, that's a big difference. Let me check:

If the specific gravity of the float is 0.474 (i.e., 47.4% the density of water), then ρ_float = 0.474 * 62.4 ≈ 29.5 lb/ft³, which makes sense.

But the problem states 4.74, which would imply ρ_float = 4.74 * 62.4 ≈ 295 lb/ft³, which is way too dense.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the specific gravity is 0.474 instead of 4.74. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the formula incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (ρ_fluid - ρ_float), but if the float is less dense, then this would be positive, leading to a positive h.

Wait, let me proceed with the assumption that the specific gravity is 0.474, because otherwise the problem doesn't make sense. So, with that in mind:

ρ_float = 0.474 * 62.4 ≈ 29.5 lb/ft³.

Now, compute h again.

h = (Q/(K*A))² * (ρ_fluid - ρ_float)/(2g)

Compute each step:

Q = 1.80 gpm = 1.80 * 0.1337 / 60 ≈ 0.004011 ft³/s.

A = area of float = π*(0.5 in)^2 = π*0.25 ≈ 0.7854 in² = 0.7854 / 144 ≈ 0.005454 ft².

K = 0.74.

Compute Q/(K*A):

0.004011 / (0.74 * 0.005454) ≈ 0.004011 / 0.00403 ≈ 0.995.

Square that: 0.995^2 ≈ 0.990.

Compute (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) = 62.4 - 29.5 ≈ 32.9 lb/ft³.

Divide by (2g): 32.9 / (2*32.2) ≈ 32.9 /64.4 ≈ 0.511.

Multiply all together: 0.990 * 0.511 ≈ 0.506 ft.

Convert to inches: 0.506 * 12 ≈ 6.07 inches. But the options don't have 6.07, but option J is 6.0 in. So perhaps the answer is J.

But wait, the problem states the specific gravity as 4.74, which would make the float denser than water, leading to a negative h, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula differently. Let me think again.

Another formula for the arotameter is:

h = (Q / (K * A))² * (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) / (2g)

But perhaps I should consider the density in different units. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the volume of the float to find the height in the tube.

Wait, the float is a cork with a diameter of 1.0 inch, so radius 0.5 in. Volume is given as 0.65 in³. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Let's check if the volume matches a sphere.

(4/3)π*(0.5)^3 ≈ (4/3)*3.1416*(0.125) ≈ (4/3)*0.3927 ≈ 0.5236 in³. But the given volume is 0.65 in³, which is larger, so perhaps it's a cylinder? Or maybe it's a different shape. Alternatively, perhaps the float is cylindrical, so volume would be πr²h, but I don't know the height. Alternatively, perhaps the volume is given, so I can find the area A from the volume when submerged.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the formula should involve the area of the float's cross-section.

Wait, the area A is the cross-sectional area of the float, which is a circle with diameter 1.0 inch. So A = π*(0.5)^2 ≈ 0.7854 in², as I did earlier.

But if the float is less dense than water, then h would be the height from the bottom, as the float rises.

Wait, but with the specific gravity as 4.74, the float is more dense than water, so it would sink, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the specific gravity is 0.474, leading to h ≈ 6.07 inches, which is close to option J: 6.0 in.

But the options don't include 6.07, but J is 6.0, which is the closest. But the problem states specific gravity as 4.74, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula uses the specific gravity of the fluid relative to the float. So, specific gravity = ρ_fluid / ρ_float.

If the specific gravity is 4.74, then ρ_fluid = 4.74 * ρ_float.

But then, I don't have ρ_float, but I have the volume of the float as 0.65 in³. Wait, that's in³, but density is mass/volume. Wait, but perhaps I can find the mass of the float from the volume and specific gravity.

Wait, the specific gravity is given for the float, so SG = ρ_float / ρ_water.

So, ρ_float = SG * ρ_water.

If SG is 4.74, then ρ_float = 4.74 * 62.4 lb/ft³ ≈ 295.3 lb/ft³.

But that's way too dense. So, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the specific gravity is 0.474, making ρ_float ≈ 29.5 lb/ft³.

Proceeding with that, let's recalculate.

h = (0.004011 / (0.74 * 0.005454))² * (62.4 - 29.5) / (2*32.2)

Compute each part:

0.004011 / (0.74 * 0.005454) ≈ 0.004011 / 0.00403 ≈ 0.995.

Square: 0.995² ≈ 0.990.

(62.4 - 29.5) = 32.9.

32.9 / (2*32.2) ≈ 32.9 /64.4 ≈ 0.511.

Multiply all together: 0.990 * 0.511 ≈ 0.506 ft.

0.506 ft * 12 = 6.07 inches.

But the options are A to J, with J being 6.0 in. So, perhaps the answer is J.

But since the problem states the specific gravity as 4.74, which leads to an impossible scenario, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula uses the height of the float from the top, not the bottom. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = (Q / (K * A))² * (ρ_fluid - ρ_float) / (2g)

But I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me check the units again.

Q is in ft³/s, K is dimensionless, A is in ft², ρ in lb/ft³, g in ft/s².

So, the units inside the sqrt would be (lb/ft³)/(lb/ft³) * 1/s², which is 1/s². So sqrt gives 1/s.

Wait, but then the units for h would be (ft³/s) / (ft² * 1/s) ) → ft.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the units. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the volume of the float to find the height in the tube.

Wait, the float has a volume of 0.65 in³. The cross-sectional area of the tube at the bottom is π*(0.5 in)^2 ≈ 0.7854 in². So, the height of the float in the tube would be volume / area = 0.65 / 0.7854 ≈ 0.829 inches. But that's just the submerged depth, not the height from the bottom.

Wait, but that's when the float is submerged. But in this case, the float is less dense than water, so it would float with only a small part submerged. Hmm, maybe not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the height h is the height of the float's top from the bottom, which would be the submerged depth plus the length above water. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the pressure balance. The pressure at the bottom of the float is equal to the pressure due to the fluid above it. So, the pressure at the float's bottom is ρ_water * g * h. The pressure at the float's top is ρ_water * g * (h - d), where d is the depth submerged. The pressure difference would be equal to the buoyant force divided by the area.

Buoyant force = weight of displaced fluid = ρ_water * g * d * A.

The net force upward is buoyant force minus the weight of the float. But the float is in equilibrium, so net force is zero. So:

ρ_water * g * d * A = (ρ_float * g * V_float)

Where V_float is the volume of the float.

So, d = (ρ_float * V_float) / (ρ_water * A)

Then, the height h from the bottom is d, because the float is floating with depth d submerged.

Wait, but then the height from the bottom would be d. So, h = d.

So, h = (ρ_float * V_float) / (ρ_water * A)

But wait, that's only considering the submerged depth. But in the arotameter, the height h is the distance from the bottom to the top of the float, which would be the submerged depth plus the length above the fluid level. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try using this approach.

Given:

V_float = 0.65 in³ = 0.65 / 1728 ft³ ≈ 0.000376 ft³.

A = area of float's cross-section = π*(0.5 in)^2 ≈ 0.7854 in² = 0.7854 / 144 ft² ≈ 0.005454 ft².

ρ_float = 4.74 * 62.4 ≈ 295.3 lb/ft³.

Then, d = (295.3 lb/ft³ * 0.000376 ft³) / (62.4 lb/ft³ * 0.005454 ft²)

Compute numerator: 295.3 * 0.000376 ≈ 0.1112 lb.

Denominator: 62.4 * 0.005454 ≈ 0.3403 lb/ft.

So, d ≈ 0.1112 / 0.3403 ≈ 0.327 ft ≈ 3.92 inches.

Wait, that's approximately 3.9 inches, which is option B.

But wait, this approach gives h ≈ 3.9 inches, which is one of the options.

But earlier, using the flow rate formula, I got around 6 inches, but that was under the assumption that the specific gravity was 0.474. But with 4.74, the flow rate formula approach led to a negative h, which isn't possible, so perhaps this approach is the correct one.

Wait, but this approach doesn't involve the flow rate. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the height h is determined by the balance of forces, and the flow rate is a separate consideration.

Wait, but the flow rate is given, so perhaps I should combine both approaches. Let me try to reconcile this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the flow rate formula and plug in the values correctly.

Wait, let's try again with the specific gravity as 4.74, even though it leads to a negative h, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

So, specific gravity of the float is 4.74, so ρ_float = 4.74 * 62.4 ≈ 295.3 lb/ft³.

ρ_fluid = 62.4 lb/ft³.

So, ρ_fluid - ρ_float = 62.4 - 295.3 ≈ -232.9 lb/ft³.

That's negative, which would make the term under the square root negative, which is impossible. So, this suggests that the float is denser than the fluid, which would make it sink, which isn't possible. Therefore, the problem must have a typo, and the specific gravity should be 0.474, making the float less dense.

Proceeding with that:

ρ_float = 0.474 * 62.4 ≈ 29.5 lb/ft³.

Then,

h = (Q/(K*A))² * (ρ_fluid - ρ_float)/(2g)

Plugging in:

Q = 0.004011 ft³/s

K = 0.74

A = 0.005454 ft²

So,

Q/(K*A) = 0.004011 / (0.74 * 0.005454) ≈ 0.004011 / 0.00403 ≈ 0.995.

Square: 0.995² ≈ 0.990.

(ρ_fluid - ρ_float) = 62.4 - 29.5 ≈ 32.9 lb/ft³.

Divide by 2g: 32.9 / (2*32.2) ≈ 0.511.

Multiply: 0.990 * 0.511 ≈ 0.506 ft → 6.07 in.

But the options don't have 6.07, but option J is 6.0 in. So perhaps the answer is J.

But the problem states the specific gravity as 4.74, which is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the height from the top, but that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the volume of the float to find the height in the tube. The volume of the float is 0.65 in³, and the cross-sectional area at the bottom is π*(0.5 in)^2 ≈ 0.7854 in². So, the depth submerged would be 0.65 / 0.7854 ≈ 0.829 in. Then, the height from the bottom would be that depth, but that would be only 0.83 inches, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should stick with the flow rate formula, leading to h ≈ 6.07 inches, which is closest to option J: 6.0 in.

The problem involves determining the height of a cork float in an arotameter given the volumetric flow rate and other parameters. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Arotameter Formula**: The flow rate \( Q \) is related to the height \( h \) of the float using the formula:
   \[
   Q = K \cdot A \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2g \cdot h}{\rho_{\text{fluid}} - \rho_{\text{float}}}}
   \]
   where \( K \) is the discharge coefficient, \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the float, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, \( \rho_{\text{fluid}} \) is the density of the fluid, and \( \rho_{\text{float}} \) is the density of the float.

2. **Converting Units**: The volumetric flow rate \( Q \) is given as 1.80 gpm, which is converted to \( 0.004011 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \). The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the float (diameter 1.0 in) is calculated as \( 0.005454 \, \text{ft}^2 \).

3. **Density Calculations**: The specific gravity of the cork is given as 4.74, which implies \( \rho_{\text{float}} = 4.74 \cdot 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \approx 295.3 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \). However, this makes the cork denser than water, leading to a negative height \( h \), which is physically impossible. Assuming a typo, if the specific gravity were 0.474, \( \rho_{\text{float}} \approx 29.5 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \), making the cork less dense than water.

4. **Solving for \( h \)**: Using the formula and the recalculated density, the height \( h \) is found to be approximately \( 6.07 \, \text{in} \), which aligns closely with option J: 6.0 in.

5. **Reconciliation**: Despite the conflicting specific gravity value, the calculations suggest that the intended answer is based on the cork being less dense than water, leading to a height of approximately 6.0 in.

ANSWER: J
