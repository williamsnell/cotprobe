Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question. Let me read it again carefully.

The researcher grows a population of ferns, and after a few generations, she notices a new variant with a distinct phenotype. When she tries to breed the original phenotype with the new one, no offspring are produced. But when she breeds the new variants, the offspring look like the new variant. Hmm, that's interesting.

So, first, I need to understand what's happening here. It sounds like the new variant is somehow different in a way that prevents it from breeding with the original. But when they breed among themselves, they produce offspring that are the same as themselves. This makes me think of something related to reproduction and genetics.

Wait, when two organisms can't produce offspring together, it's often because they're different species. Like, for example, a mule is the offspring of a horse and a donkey, but they can't interbreed back to produce more mules. But in this case, the new variant can't breed with the original, but they can breed among themselves. So the new variant is probably a different species that can't interbreed with the original, but can reproduce within their own group.

So the question is asking which of the options is likely to exhibit this process. The options are various animals and plants: goldfish, spotted toads, Dalmatians, grass, orchids, wheat, garden snails, fruit flies, fallow deer, house cats.

Wait, but wait—ferns are the subject here. So the researcher is working with ferns. Ferns can reproduce both by spores and sometimes through breeding if they're in a controlled environment. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The key point is about the inability to interbreed. So the new variant is likely a different species, so when crossed with the original, there's no offspring. But when crossed among themselves, they produce viable offspring.

Which of these options would likely have such a situation? Let's think about each option.

A: Goldfish. They are a type of fish, but if a new variant appeared, could they interbreed? Goldfish can interbreed with other carp, but if the variant is a different species, maybe not. But I'm not sure if this is a common scenario.

B: Spotted toads. Toads can sometimes have different species that look similar, but if a new variant appeared, maybe it's a different species that can't breed with the original. But I'm not sure if this is the best example.

C: Dalmatians. These are a specific breed of dogs. Breeding different breeds can produce offspring, but if the new variant is a different species, then no. But Dalmatians are all the same species, just a breed, so maybe not.

D: Grass. Grasses can have different species, but I'm not sure if grasses can interbreed. Some grasses can hybridize, but if the new variant is a different species, then perhaps.

E: Orchids. Orchids have many species, and some are known for their complex breeding systems. They might have species that can't interbreed with others, but when among themselves, they produce offspring.

F: Wheat. Wheat is a crop, and there are different varieties. If a new variant is a different species, like maybe a wild wheat, it might not interbreed with the domesticated one. But I'm not sure.

G: Garden snails. Snails can have different species, and some might not interbreed.

H: Fruit flies. Fruit flies have many species, and they can't interbreed with each other, so that's possible.

I: Fallow deer. They can interbreed with other deer species, but if the variant is a different species, perhaps not.

J: House cats. They are all the same species, so any variants would interbreed, so probably not the answer.

Wait, but the original organisms are ferns. So the question is about a plant. The options include grass, orchids, wheat. Let me think about those.

Ferns reproduce via spores, not seeds. So perhaps the new variant is a different species of fern. But the options don't have ferns, so I have to look for something similar.

Wait, the options are different organisms, but the process described is about speciation—when a new species arises that can't interbreed with the parent species.

In the case of the researcher's ferns, the new variant can't breed with the original, but can among themselves. So the new variant is a new species.

So among the options, which organisms are known for having species that can't interbreed but can reproduce within their own group?

Orchids come in many species, and some are specialized, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Grass can have different species, but maybe not as relevant.

Wheat is a plant, but it's a crop, and sometimes different varieties can interbreed, but if a new species arises, it wouldn't.

Alternatively, considering that the question is about a process where a new variant can't interbreed with the original but can among themselves, it's a case of reproductive isolation, leading to speciation.

Another angle: the fact that the original and new variants can't produce offspring suggests that they are reproductively isolated, meaning they're different species. So the new variant is a new species.

Looking at the options, which ones can have distinct species that can't interbreed but can reproduce within their own group.

Fruit flies (H) have many species, each of which can't interbreed with others. So if a new variant is a different species, they can't breed with the original but can among themselves.

But wait, the original organisms are ferns, so the question is about plants. But the options don't have a plant that's a fern, so perhaps the closest is grass, orchids, wheat.

Orchids are a large family with many species. So if a new orchid species arises, it might not interbreed with the original, but can produce offspring among themselves.

Alternatively, grass is a common plant, but I'm not sure about their speciation.

Wait, another point: the fact that the new variant can't breed with the original suggests that they are different species, which is speciation. So the process described is about speciation.

Which of the options is known for having species that can't interbreed with each other but can reproduce within their own species?

Fruit flies are known for having many species, each of which can't interbreed with others. So when a new variant appears, it can't breed with the original, but can among themselves.

But since the original organisms are plants (ferns), perhaps the correct answer is another plant. Let's think: grass, orchids, wheat.

Orchids are often used as examples in plant speciation. For instance, some orchids have complex pollination mechanisms that prevent interbreeding with others, leading to new species.

Grass can also form different species, but I'm not as familiar with grasses as orchids in terms of reproductive isolation.

So, perhaps the answer is E: Orchids.

Alternatively, another thought: the question mentions that the new variants can't interbreed with the original. So the new variant is a different species. Among the given options, which of these is known for having such a process?

Fruit flies (H) are known for their rapid speciation. So if a new species of fruit fly arises, it can't interbreed with the original, but can reproduce among themselves.

But the original organisms are plants, but since the options don't include ferns, perhaps the best fit is orchids.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Fruit flies, because they're known for their ability to form new species quickly.

Wait, but the process described is about a plant (ferns), so perhaps the correct answer is a plant. Among the options, E: Orchids and F: Wheat are plants.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: the question says that when the new variants are bred together, the offspring look like the new variant. So they're true-breeding, which suggests that the new variant is a pure species, perhaps homozygous.

Alternatively, maybe the new variant is a hybrid species that is sterile when crossed with the original but fertile among themselves.

Wait, but the question says that when the new variants are bred, they have offspring that look like the new variant. So they're not sterile. So they're a viable species.

So the process is likely allopatric speciation, where a population is isolated and then diverges into a new species.

Which of the options is known for this?

Well, if the researcher has a population of ferns, and a new variant arises, perhaps a mutation or some change leads to a new species.

But since the options don't include ferns, the next best would be another plant.

Orchids are a good example because many species have arisen through speciation, and they can't interbreed with each other.

Alternatively, wheat is a plant, but I'm not sure about its speciation.

Wait, another angle: the fact that the new variants can't breed with the original suggests that they are a different species, and thus the process is speciation, specifically reproductive isolation.

So the best answer would be an organism that can form new species that are reproductively isolated.

Fruit flies are known for this; they have many species that can't interbreed.

But again, the original question is about plants. Hmm.

Wait, the options include both plants and animals. So perhaps the correct answer is E: Orchids, as they are plants and have many species that can't interbreed.

Alternatively, grass (D) is a plant, but I'm not as sure.

Another thought: the question says that the researcher grows ferns, but the options don't include ferns, so perhaps the correct answer is another plant with similar reproductive strategies.

So between E and F: orchids and wheat.

I think orchids are more likely, as they have many species that can't interbreed.

So, after considering, I think the answer is E: Orchids.
</think>

The question describes a scenario where a new variant of ferns arises and cannot interbreed with the original phenotype but can reproduce among themselves, indicating speciation through reproductive isolation. The process involves the new variant becoming a distinct species that cannot produce offspring with the original but can among themselves.

Among the options, **E: Orchids** is the most fitting. Orchids are known for their diverse species, many of which exhibit reproductive isolation. They have complex pollination mechanisms that prevent interbreeding with other species, aligning with the described process. Although other options like fruit flies (H) are also known for speciation, the original organisms are plants, making orchids the better choice.

**Answer: E**
