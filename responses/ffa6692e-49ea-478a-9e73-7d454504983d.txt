Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the pH of a 0.001 M solution of KOH. Hmm, I remember that KOH is a strong base, right? So it should dissociate completely in water. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that KOH is a strong electrolyte, which means it breaks down into its ions completely. So KOH → K+ + OH-. That part I'm pretty sure about. So in a solution, each mole of KOH gives one mole of OH- ions. 

The concentration given is 0.001 M. Wait, 0.001 M is the same as 1e-3 M. So if I have 0.001 M KOH, that should give me 0.001 M of OH- ions in solution because each KOH molecule produces one OH- ion.

Now, pH is related to the concentration of H+ ions. But I know that in water, the concentration of H+ and OH- are related by the ion product of water, Kw, which is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1e-14.

Since I have the concentration of OH-, I can find the concentration of H+ by rearranging the Kw equation. Let me write that out:

[H+] = Kw / [OH-]

Substituting the numbers, [OH-] is 0.001 M, which is 1e-3 M. So:

[H+] = (1e-14) / (1e-3) = 1e-11 M.

Now, pH is the negative logarithm of [H+], so pH = -log[H+]. Let's compute that.

-log(1e-11) is equal to 11, because log(1e-11) is -11, so the negative of that is 11. So the pH would be 11. 

Wait, but wait a second. Strong bases like KOH should result in a pH greater than 7, which 11 is. So that makes sense. Let me double-check my steps. 0.001 M KOH gives 0.001 M OH-. Kw gives [H+] as 1e-11, so pH is 11. Yeah, that seems right.

I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with strong bases, I might think about the pOH first. Oh right, pOH is the negative log of OH- concentration. So pOH = -log(1e-3) = 3. Then since pH + pOH = 14, pH would be 14 - 3 = 11. That's another way to get the same answer, which confirms it.

So looking at the options, H is 11. So the answer should be H.
