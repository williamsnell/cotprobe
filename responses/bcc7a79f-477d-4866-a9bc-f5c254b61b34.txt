Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electromagnetic induction. Hmm, I think I remember that Faraday's Law is involved in these kinds of problems. Let me read the question again.

So, there's a single turn loop in air, with a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to its plane. The area is 5 square meters. They're asking for the emf appearing at the terminals when the rate of change of flux density is 2 Weber per square meter per second. The options are from A to J, with various voltages.

Wait, I need to recall Faraday's Law. Faraday's Law of Induction states that the induced emf in a loop is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. The formula is emf = -dΦ/dt. But since the problem is asking for the magnitude, I can probably ignore the negative sign.

Magnetic flux Φ is given by Φ = B * A * cosθ, where B is the magnetic field, A is the area, and θ is the angle between the field and the normal to the loop. In this case, the field is normal, so θ is 0 degrees, and cosθ is 1. So Φ = B * A.

But wait, the problem says the rate of change of flux density is given. Flux density is the same as B, right? So dB/dt is 2 Weber/m² per second. Oh, because flux density is B, so dΦ/dt would be d(B*A)/dt. Since the area is constant (the loop isn't changing size), dΦ/dt = A * dB/dt.

So substituting the values, A is 5 m², and dB/dt is 2 Wb/m²/s. So dΦ/dt is 5 * 2 = 10 Wb/s. Then the emf is dΦ/dt, so 10 volts. That would be option B.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The question says the rate of change of flux density is 2. Flux density is B, so dB/dt = 2 Wb/m²/s. So yes, that part is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes problems give the rate of change of flux (dΦ/dt) directly, but here they give dB/dt. So I have to multiply by the area to get dΦ/dt, which is exactly what I did. So yes, 5 * 2 is 10.

I think that's right. So the answer should be 10 volts, which is option B.

The induced emf is calculated using Faraday's Law: emf = -dΦ/dt. Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the loop, Φ = B * A. The rate of change of flux density (dB/dt) is given as 2 Wb/m²/s. Thus, dΦ/dt = A * dB/dt = 5 m² * 2 Wb/m²/s = 10 Wb/s. Therefore, the emf is 10 volts.

Answer: B
