Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace."
Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out who was allowed to participate in the Greek democratic process during the time Thucydides wrote this text, which is around 415 B.C.E. The question is about the democracy in ancient Greece, specifically Athens, I think, since Thucydides was an Athenian historian.

From what I remember, ancient Greek democracy was quite different from modern democracies. It was direct rather than representative, meaning citizens voted directly on laws and policies. But who counted as a citizen back then?

The passage Thucydides wrote talks about the constitution and the administration being a democracy. He mentions that the laws afford equal justice to all in their private differences, and that advancement in public life is based on reputation for capacity, not social class. It also says that even if someone is poor, if they can serve the state, they aren't hindered. So, it sounds like the democracy was inclusive in some ways, but I know it wasn't entirely inclusive.

Wait, but in reality, ancient Greek democracy was only for male citizens. Women weren't allowed to participate. Also, not all men were citizens. Citizenship was usually tied to being born to parents who were citizens of the state. So, for example, in Athens, only male citizens who were born there could participate. Slaves and non-citizens, even if they lived in the city, couldn't vote.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: All children born within the state. No, because it's about participation in the democratic process, which requires being an adult, and also citizenship by birth might not cover everyone born there if their parents weren't citizens.

B: All adult men who served in the military. Not exactly. Military service was part of being a citizen, but not all citizens necessarily served, and the participation wasn't limited to just those who served.

C: All adult men born within the state. This seems plausible because citizenship was usually based on being born to citizen parents, which would mean you were born within the state's boundaries. But wait, in some cases, even if you were born there, if your parents weren't citizens, you wouldn't be. So maybe it's more about being a citizen by birth, which would be option E or F.

D: Only the wealthy and influential. That's not right because the passage talks about equal justice and not being hindered by class, though in reality, wealth still played a role.

E: All adult men and women by birth. No, because women weren't included. So E is out.

F: All adult men who were citizens by birth. That sounds correct. They were the ones who could participate. The passage supports this because it mentions that reputation and ability matter, not just wealth, implying that as long as you were a citizen, you could participate regardless of wealth, but only men.

G: All adult men regardless of birthplace. No, because citizenship was usually tied to being born in the state and to citizen parents.

H: All adult men and women born there. Again, women weren't included, so H is wrong.

I: All adults, regardless of gender and birthplace. No, because only men and only citizens.

J: Only educated ones. No, education wasn't a requirement, though in some cases, the wealthy were more educated.

So, the correct answer should be F: All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth. This aligns with the passage's emphasis on justice, reputation, and not being hindered by class, but only for male citizens.

The correct answer is F, as ancient Greek democracy, particularly in Athens, allowed participation only by adult men who were citizens by birth. Women and non-citizens, regardless of their birthplace, were excluded from the democratic process. The passage supports this by emphasizing justice and merit without class barriers but does not extend participation to women or non-citizens.

Answer: F
