Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the rate of heat loss per foot of a pipe. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says it's a stainless steel pipe with an inside diameter of 3 inches and an outside diameter of 3.5 inches. It's covered with 0.5 inches of asbestos insulation. The fluid inside is at 400°F, and the outside air is 75°F. The inner and outer surface conductances are given as 50 and 5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F, respectively. The thermal conductivities (k) for the steel and asbestos are 30 and 0.12 Btu/hr-ft-°F, respectively.

I think the approach here is to consider the pipe and insulation as a series of resistances. So, the total heat loss would be the temperature difference divided by the sum of all the thermal resistances. The resistances come from the steel pipe, the insulation, and the surface conductances.

Wait, no, actually, conductance is the inverse of resistance. So maybe I should think in terms of conductances and add them up in a series fashion.

Let me visualize the setup. The heat flows from the hot fluid through the steel pipe wall, then through the insulation, and finally into the cooler air outside. Each of these layers has their own thermal resistance or conductance.

The formula for thermal resistance (R) is usually R = (ln(Do/Di)) / (2πkL), where Do and Di are the outer and inner diameters, k is the thermal conductivity, and L is the length. But since we're looking for heat loss per foot, L is 1 foot, so it might simplify.

Wait, but another approach is to calculate the conductance for each section and then combine them. Conductance (C) is 1/R.

So, the total heat loss (Q) will be (T_hot - T_cold) divided by the total thermal resistance, which is the sum of all resistances.

Wait, no, actually, conductances add when resistances are in series. Because 1/R_total = 1/R_steel + 1/R_insulation + 1/R_surface.

Hmm, maybe I should start by calculating the individual thermal resistances.

Let's see. The steel pipe has an inner diameter Di = 3 inches, outer diameter Do_steel = 3.5 inches. The insulation is 0.5 inches thick, so the outer diameter of the insulation would be 3.5 + 0.5*2 = 4.5 inches? Wait, no, wait. The steel's outer diameter is 3.5 inches. The insulation is 0.5 inches thick, so the outer diameter of the insulation would be 3.5 + 2*0.5 = 4.5 inches? Wait, no, no. Wait, the insulation is 0.5 inches thick, so the outer diameter would be 3.5 inches (steel's outside) plus 0.5 inches on each side? No, wait, no. Because the insulation is only on the outside of the steel pipe. So the steel's outside diameter is 3.5 inches, and the insulation adds 0.5 inches to the radius, not diameter. Wait, no, wait. The insulation's thickness is 0.5 inches. So the outside diameter after insulation would be 3.5 + 2*(0.5) inches? No, wait, no, because the thickness is the radial thickness. So the radius increases by 0.5 inches. So the outside diameter is 3.5 inches (steel's outside diameter) plus 2*(0.5) = 1 inch, making the total outside diameter 4.5 inches. So Do_insulation is 4.5 inches.

Wait, but wait, the steel's outside diameter is 3.5 inches. So the radius is 1.75 inches. The insulation adds 0.5 inches to the radius, so the new radius is 1.75 + 0.5 = 2.25 inches, so the outer diameter is 4.5 inches.

Now, for the steel's thermal resistance (R_steel), it's a cylinder, so the formula is R = (ln(Do/Di)) / (2πkL). Since we're per foot, L=1 ft.

So for the steel: Do_steel = 3.5 inches, Di_steel =3 inches. Let me convert inches to feet for consistency. 3.5 inches is 3.5/12 ft ≈ 0.2917 ft. Di_steel is 3/12 = 0.25 ft. So ln(0.2917/0.25) = ln(1.1668) ≈ 0.1542. Then R_steel = 0.1542 / (2π * 30 * 1). 2π is about 6.283, so denominator is 6.283 * 30 ≈ 188.5. So R_steel ≈ 0.1542 / 188.5 ≈ 0.000818 °F·ft/Btu.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 30 Btu/hr-ft-°F is the thermal conductivity. So R_steel would be (ln(Do/Di)) / (2πkL). Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should keep the diameters in inches but make sure all units are consistent. Alternatively, since the length is in feet, perhaps it's better to convert diameters to feet.

Steel:

Do_steel = 3.5 inches = 3.5/12 ≈ 0.2917 ft
Di_steel = 3 inches = 0.25 ft
ln(0.2917/0.25) = ln(1.1667) ≈ 0.1542

R_steel = 0.1542 / (2π * 30 * 1 ft)
Because k is in Btu/hr-ft-°F, and L is 1 ft.

So numerator is 0.1542, denominator is 2π *30 *1 = 188.4956. So R_steel ≈ 0.1542 / 188.4956 ≈ 0.000818 °F·ft/Btu.

But that seems very low. Alternatively, maybe I should think about this differently. Because the conductance for the steel would be C_steel = (2πk ln(Do/Di)) / L. So maybe it's easier to compute the conductance first.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to model each layer as a resistance. So the total resistance is R_total = R_steel + R_insulation + R_outer_surface.

Wait, but the surface conductances are given: inner surface conductance is 50, outer is 5. So perhaps these are the conductances for convection at each surface. So the resistance for each surface would be R = 1/C.

So R_inner = 1/50 = 0.02 °F·ft²/Btu
R_outer = 1/5 = 0.2 °F·ft²/Btu

Now, for the steel and insulation, which are solid layers, their resistances are calculated as:

R_steel = (ln(Do_steel / Di_steel)) / (2πk_steel * L)
Similarly, R_insulation = (ln(Do_insulation / Di_insulation)) / (2πk_insulation * L)

Wait, but wait, the insulation is around the steel, so the inner diameter of the insulation is the outer diameter of the steel, which is 3.5 inches, and the outer diameter of the insulation is 3.5 + 2*(0.5 inches) = 4.5 inches, as we determined earlier.

So for the steel:

Do_steel = 3.5 inches, Di_steel =3 inches.

R_steel = ln(3.5/3) / (2π * 30 * 1 ft)
Let me compute that:

3.5/3 = 1.1667
ln(1.1667) ≈ 0.1542

Denominator: 2π *30 = 6.2832 *30 ≈188.495

So R_steel ≈ 0.1542 / 188.495 ≈ 0.000818 °F·ft/Btu.

Wait, that seems too small. Let me check the units again. Oh, wait, because 1 ft is the length, so perhaps the units are correct.

For the insulation:

Do_insulation =4.5 inches, Di_insulation=3.5 inches.

R_insulation = ln(4.5/3.5) / (2π *0.12 *1 ft)

4.5 /3.5 ≈1.2857, ln ≈0.2505

Denominator: 2π*0.12 ≈0.754

So R_insulation ≈0.2505 /0.754 ≈0.332 °F·ft/Btu.

Wait, that seems plausible.

Now, the conductances are the reciprocals of the resistances. So for the steel and insulation, the conductances would be:

C_steel = 1/R_steel ≈ 1 / 0.000818 ≈1222.3 Btu/hr-°F·ft.

Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I should model the entire system as a series of resistances: inner convection, steel, insulation, outer convection.

So the total resistance R_total is R_inner + R_steel + R_insulation + R_outer.

Where R_inner = 1/50 = 0.02, R_steel ≈0.000818, R_insulation≈0.332, R_outer=1/5=0.2.

Adding them up: 0.02 + 0.000818 + 0.332 + 0.2 ≈ 0.552818 °F·ft²/Btu.

Wait, but that can't be right because the units don't seem to match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Let me think again.

Wait, each R is in °F·ft²/Btu. Because when you have conductance in Btu/hr-°F·ft², the resistance is in °F·ft²/Btu.

So the total R_total is R_inner + R_steel + R_insulation + R_outer.

So R_total = (1/50) + (ln(3.5/3)/(2π*30*1)) + (ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12*1)) + (1/5).

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term numerically.

Compute each term:

R_inner =1/50 = 0.02 °F·ft²/Btu

R_steel = ln(3.5/3)/(2π*30*1) = ln(1.1667)/(6.2832*30) ≈ 0.1542/(188.495) ≈0.000818 °F·ft²/Btu

R_insulation = ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12*1) ≈ ln(1.2857)/(0.754) ≈0.2505/0.754 ≈0.332 °F·ft²/Btu

R_outer=1/5=0.2 °F·ft²/Btu

So total R_total = 0.02 + 0.000818 + 0.332 +0.2 ≈0.552818 °F·ft²/Btu.

Then, the heat loss per foot is Q = (T_hot - T_cold)/R_total.

T_hot=400°F, T_cold=75°F. So ΔT=325°F.

So Q=325 / 0.552818 ≈587.7 Btu/hr-ft.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option G: 645, option I:615, option C:520, etc. Wait, 587 is not exactly matching any option, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_steel or R_insulation.

Let me recalculate R_steel.

Do_steel=3.5 inches =0.2917 ft
Di_steel=3 inches=0.25 ft
ln(0.2917/0.25) = ln(1.1667)=≈0.1542

Denominator: 2π*30*1 = 188.4956

R_steel=0.1542 /188.4956 ≈0.000818 °F·ft²/Btu.

That seems correct.

R_insulation:

Do_insulation=4.5 inches=0.375 ft
Di_insulation=3.5 inches=0.2917 ft
ln(0.375/0.2917)=ln(1.2857)=≈0.2505

Denominator:2π*0.12*1= 0.754

R_insulation=0.2505/0.754≈0.332.

That seems correct.

So R_total=0.02 + 0.000818 + 0.332 +0.2= 0.552818.

So Q=325/0.552818≈587.7.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option I is 615, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the insulation's outer diameter.

Wait, wait a minute. The insulation is 0.5 inches thick. The steel's outer diameter is 3.5 inches. So the insulation adds 0.5 inches on each side? No, wait, the insulation is around the steel, so the thickness adds to the radius, not the diameter. So the outer diameter is 3.5 + 2*(0.5) inches? No, wait, no. Because the insulation's thickness is the radial thickness. So the radius increases by 0.5 inches. So the outer diameter would be 3.5 + 2*0.5 =4.5 inches, which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the steel's conductivity differently. Alternatively, maybe the approach should consider the steel and insulation as concentric cylinders, each with their own thermal resistances, and then add the surface resistances.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

1/C_total = 1/(2πk_steel ln(Do_steel/Di_steel)) + 1/(2πk_insulation ln(Do_insulation/Do_steel)) + 1/C_inner + 1/C_outer.

Wait, no, perhaps the conductances add in series.

Wait, let me think again. The heat flows through:

1. Convection from fluid to inner surface: C_inner =50 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

2. Steel pipe: C_steel = (2πk_steel ln(Do_steel/Di_steel)) / L

3. Insulation: C_insulation = (2πk_insulation ln(Do_insulation/Do_steel)) / L

4. Convection from outer surface to air: C_outer=5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

So the total conductance C_total is the sum of each individual conductance:

C_total = C_inner + C_steel + C_insulation + C_outer

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each component is in series, so their conductances add. So 1/R_total = C_inner + C_steel + C_insulation + C_outer.

Wait, but I'm getting confused between conductance and resistance. Let me clarify:

Each layer contributes a resistance, and the total resistance is the sum of all individual resistances.

So R_total = R_inner + R_steel + R_insulation + R_outer.

Where R_inner = 1/C_inner = 1/50 =0.02

R_steel = ln(Do_steel/Di_steel)/(2πk_steel L)

R_insulation = ln(Do_insulation/Do_steel)/(2πk_insulation L)

R_outer =1/C_outer=1/5=0.2.

So let me recalculate each R.

Compute R_steel:

Do_steel=3.5 in, Di_steel=3 in.

ln(3.5/3)=ln(1.1667)=0.1542

Denominator=2π*30*1=188.4956

R_steel=0.1542/188.4956≈0.000818.

R_insulation:

Do_insulation=4.5 in, Do_steel=3.5 in.

ln(4.5/3.5)=ln(1.2857)=0.2505

Denominator=2π*0.12*1=0.754

R_insulation=0.2505/0.754≈0.332.

So R_total=0.02 +0.000818 +0.332 +0.2≈0.552818.

Then Q=ΔT/R_total=325/0.552818≈587.7 Btu/hr-ft.

But the options don't have 588. The closest is option I:615, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the conductances and add them, then take the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model each layer's resistance and sum them.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the way I'm calculating R_steel and R_insulation.

Wait, another approach: the conductance for a cylindrical wall is C = (2πk ln(Do/Di)) / L.

So for the steel:

C_steel = (2π*30*ln(3.5/3))/1.

Compute that:

ln(3.5/3)=0.1542.

So C_steel=2π*30*0.1542 ≈6.2832*30*0.1542≈6.2832*4.626≈29.13 Btu/hr-°F·ft.

Similarly, for the insulation:

C_insulation=(2π*0.12*ln(4.5/3.5))/1.

ln(4.5/3.5)=0.2505.

So C_insulation=6.2832*0.12*0.2505≈6.2832*0.03006≈0.190 Btu/hr-°F·ft.

Wait, that seems very low for the insulation's conductance, but perhaps it's correct because the insulation has a low thermal conductivity.

Now, the total conductance C_total is the sum of C_inner (50), C_steel (29.13), C_insulation (0.190), and C_outer (5).

So C_total=50+29.13+0.190+5=84.32 Btu/hr-°F·ft.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the heat loss Q=ΔT/C_total=325/84.32≈3.85 Btu/hr-ft, which is way lower than any of the options.

Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing conductance and resistance.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model each layer's resistance and sum them, then compute Q=ΔT/(sum of resistances).

Let me try again:

R_inner =1/C_inner=1/50=0.02

R_steel = ln(3.5/3)/(2π*30*1)=0.1542/(188.495)=≈0.000818

R_insulation=ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12*1)=0.2505/0.754≈0.332

R_outer=1/C_outer=1/5=0.2

Total R=0.02+0.000818+0.332+0.2=0.552818

Then Q=325 /0.552818≈587.7 Btu/hr-ft.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. The closest is option G:645, which is higher. Or maybe option I:615.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_insulation. Let me recheck.

R_insulation = ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12*1)

ln(4.5/3.5)=ln(1.2857)=≈0.2505

2π*0.12=0.754

So R_insulation=0.2505 /0.754≈0.332.

Alternatively, perhaps the outer diameter of the insulation is incorrect. Because the pipe's outside diameter is 3.5 inches, and the insulation is 0.5 inches thick. So the insulation's outer diameter is 3.5 + 2*(0.5) =4.5 inches? Wait, no, the insulation's thickness is 0.5 inches, so it's only added once on the radius. So the outer diameter is 3.5 + 2*0.5=4.5 inches, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the area for each layer correctly.

Wait, another approach: the total thermal resistance for each layer is R=ln(Do/Di)/(2πkL). So for each layer, compute R and sum them, then add the surface resistances.

So:

Steel:

Do=3.5 in, Di=3 in.

R_steel=ln(3.5/3)/(2π*30*1)=0.1542/(188.495)=0.000818.

Insulation:

Do=4.5 in, Di=3.5 in.

R_insulation=ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12*1)=0.2505/0.754≈0.332.

So R_total_layers=0.000818+0.332≈0.332818.

Then, R_total= R_inner + R_layers + R_outer =0.02 +0.332818 +0.2=0.552818.

So Q=325/0.552818≈587.7.

Hmm, but that's not matching any option. Wait, perhaps the units were mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each R in the correct units. Let me make sure all units are in feet.

Do_steel=3.5 inches=3.5/12≈0.2917 ft

Di_steel=3 inches=0.25 ft

R_steel= ln(0.2917/0.25)/(2π*30*1) =0.1542/(188.495)=0.000818.

Insulation:

Do_insulation=4.5 inches=0.375 ft

Di_insulation=3.5 inches=0.2917 ft

R_insulation= ln(0.375/0.2917)/(2π*0.12*1)= ln(1.2857)/ (0.754)=0.2505/0.754≈0.332.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the surface conductances are per unit area, but I'm treating them as per foot. Hmm.

Wait, the surface conductances are given as 50 and 5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. So the units are per square foot.

But in the formula for R, I'm using R=ln(Do/Di)/(2πkL), which gives R in °F·ft²/Btu.

Wait, but the surface conductances are per square foot, so when we add them, perhaps we need to consider the area.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the surface area. Because the conductances are per square foot, but the resistance calculations are per unit length.

Wait, the formula for thermal resistance for a cylinder is R = ln(Do/Di)/(2πkL), which gives R in °F·ft²/Btu. So when multiplied by the area, it gives the total resistance. But in our case, since we're looking for heat loss per foot, L=1 ft, so the area is considered per foot.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the surface conductances in terms of their resistance per foot.

Wait, the inner surface conductance is 50 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. The area per foot is the inner surface area: 2πrL, where r is the inner radius.

r_inner =Di_steel/2=3 inches/2=1.5 inches=0.125 ft.

So area per foot: 2π*0.125*1=0.25π≈0.7854 ft².

So the inner surface conductance per foot is C_inner =50 Btu/hr-ft²-°F * 0.7854 ft² ≈39.27 Btu/hr-°F.

Wait, that makes sense because the conductance per foot would be C =50 * area per foot.

Similarly, the outer surface area per foot is 2π*(Do_insulation/2)*1= π*(4.5/12) ft= π*(0.375)=≈1.1781 ft².

So C_outer =5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F *1.1781≈5.8905 Btu/hr-°F.

Wait, but I think I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the surface conductances are given per unit area, so when calculating the resistance per foot, we can use them as is.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute each resistance per foot, including the surface conductances.

So, the total resistance per foot is R_total= R_inner + R_steel + R_insulation + R_outer.

Where:

R_inner =1/C_inner =1/50=0.02 °F·ft²/Btu.

R_steel=0.000818.

R_insulation=0.332.

R_outer=1/C_outer=1/5=0.2.

So R_total=0.02+0.000818+0.332+0.2=0.552818.

Then, Q=325/0.552818≈587.7 Btu/hr-ft.

But none of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_insulation.

Wait, let me recheck R_insulation.

Do=4.5 inches, Di=3.5 inches.

ln(4.5/3.5)=ln(1.2857)=≈0.2505.

Denominator=2π*0.12*1=0.754.

So R_insulation=0.2505/0.754≈0.332.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is option I:615 Btu/hr-ft. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I should calculate the heat loss through each layer separately and sum them.

Wait, no, because the heat loss through each layer would be the same, so the total heat loss would be determined by the overall conductance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for heat loss through a cylindrical pipe with multiple layers.

The formula is 1/C_total = 1/C_steel + 1/C_insulation + 1/C_inner + 1/C_outer.

Wait, but that's not correct because each layer's conductance is in series, so their reciprocals add.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The overall conductance C_total is the sum of each individual conductance: C_steel + C_insulation + C_inner + C_outer.

Wait, but that can't be right because each conductance is in series, so their reciprocals add.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

The formula for heat transfer through a series of resistances is Q = (T_hot - T_cold) / (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4).

Each R is the thermal resistance of that layer.

So, R1 is the inner surface resistance: R1=1/C_inner=1/50=0.02.

R2 is the steel's resistance: R2= ln(Do_steel/Di_steel)/(2πk_steel L).

R3 is the insulation's resistance: R3=ln(Do_insulation/Do_steel)/(2πk_insulation L).

R4 is the outer surface resistance: R4=1/C_outer=1/5=0.2.

So, sum R_total=R1+R2+R3+R4.

Compute each:

R1=0.02.

R2= ln(3.5/3)/(2π*30*1)=0.1542/(188.495)=≈0.000818.

R3=ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12*1)=0.2505/(0.754)=≈0.332.

R4=0.2.

So R_total=0.02+0.000818+0.332+0.2=0.552818.

Q=325/0.552818≈587.7 Btu/hr-ft.

But none of the options match. The closest is option I:615.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating R_insulation. Let me check again.

Do_insulation=4.5 inches, Di_insulation=3.5 inches.

ln(4.5/3.5)=ln(1.2857)=≈0.2505.

Denominator=2π*0.12*1=0.754.

So R3=0.2505/0.754≈0.332.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the outer diameter of the insulation is incorrect. Let me think again. The steel's outer diameter is 3.5 inches. The insulation is 0.5 inches thick. So the insulation's outer diameter is 3.5 + 2*0.5=4.5 inches. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option I:615. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the steel's resistance.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the steel as a cylinder with inner and outer diameters.

Another way: The steel's thermal resistance is R_steel=ln(Do_steel/Di_steel)/(2πk_steel L).

Do_steel=3.5 inches, Di_steel=3 inches.

ln(3.5/3)=0.1542.

Denominator=2π*30*1=188.495.

R_steel=0.1542/188.495≈0.000818.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the area correctly for the surface conductances.

Wait, the inner surface conductance is given as 50 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. The inner surface area per foot is 2π*(3/2 inches) *1 ft.

Wait, 3 inches is 0.25 ft, so radius is 0.125 ft.

Area per foot: 2π*0.125*1=0.25π≈0.7854 ft².

So the inner surface conductance per foot is C_inner=50 *0.7854≈39.27 Btu/hr-°F.

Similarly, the outer surface area per foot is 2π*(4.5/2 inches) *1 ft. 4.5 inches is 0.375 ft, radius is 0.1875 ft.

Area=2π*0.1875≈1.1781 ft².

So C_outer=5 *1.1781≈5.8905 Btu/hr-°F.

Now, the total conductance C_total is the sum of C_inner, C_steel, C_insulation, C_outer.

But wait, C_steel and C_insulation are per foot, so:

C_steel=(2π*30*ln(3.5/3))/1 ≈6.2832*30*0.1542≈29.13 Btu/hr-°F·ft.

C_insulation=(2π*0.12*ln(4.5/3.5))/1≈6.2832*0.12*0.2505≈0.190 Btu/hr-°F·ft.

So C_total=39.27 (inner) +29.13 (steel) +0.190 (insulation) +5.8905 (outer)≈74.48 Btu/hr-°F·ft.

Then, Q=ΔT/C_total=325/74.48≈4.366 Btu/hr-ft.

That can't be right, because it's way too low compared to the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the surface conductances are already per unit length, so I shouldn't multiply by the area. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer is approximately 588, which isn't listed. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the surface conductances are per unit area and per unit length. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the logarithms correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for heat loss per unit length as:

Q = (T_hot - T_cold) / [ (1/C_inner) + (ln(Do_steel/Di_steel)/(2πk_steel)) + (ln(Do_insulation/Do_steel)/(2πk_insulation)) + (1/C_outer) ]

Yes, that's the same as before.

So, with the numbers:

1/C_inner =0.02

ln(3.5/3)/(2π*30)=0.1542/(188.495)=0.000818

ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12)=0.2505/(0.754)=0.332

1/C_outer=0.2

Sum=0.02+0.000818+0.332+0.2=0.552818

Q=325/0.552818≈587.7.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is option I:615. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_insulation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the insulation's outer diameter is not 4.5 inches, but 3.5 +0.5=4 inches, since it's only 0.5 inches thick, so the outer diameter would be 3.5 +0.5=4 inches. Oh wait, that's a mistake I might have made earlier.

Wait, the insulation is 0.5 inches thick, so it's added to the radius, not the diameter. So the steel's outer diameter is 3.5 inches. The insulation adds 0.5 inches to the radius, making the new radius 1.75 +0.5=2.25 inches, so the outer diameter is 4.5 inches. That was correct earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for heat loss per unit length as:

Q = (T_hot - T_cold) / [ (1/h1) + (ln(Do1/Di)/(2πk1)) + (ln(Do2/Do1)/(2πk2)) + (1/h2) ]

Where h1=50, h2=5, k1=30, k2=0.12, Di=3 inches, Do1=3.5, Do2=4.5.

So,

1/h1=0.02

ln(3.5/3)/(2π*30)=0.000818

ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12)=0.332

1/h2=0.2

Sum=0.552818

Q=325/0.552818≈587.7.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option I:615, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the insulation's resistance.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct outer diameter for the insulation. Let me recheck.

Steel's outer diameter:3.5 inches.

Insulation thickness:0.5 inches. So the insulation's outer diameter is 3.5 +2*(0.5)=4.5 inches. Correct.

Thus, R_insulation=ln(4.5/3.5)/(2π*0.12*1)=0.2505/(0.754)=0.332.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option I:615. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the surface conductances are per unit length already, so I shouldn't add them as R=1/C. Because if C is per square foot, then per foot length, it's C multiplied by the area per foot.

Wait, perhaps the surface conductances are given as per square foot, so for per foot length, I need to multiply by the surface area per foot.

Wait, the inner surface area per foot is 2π*(3/2 inches) = 2π*0.125 ft=0.25π≈0.7854 ft².

So, the inner surface conductance per foot is C_inner =50 Btu/hr-ft²-°F * 0.7854 ft²≈39.27 Btu/hr-°F.

Similarly, the outer surface area per foot is 2π*(4.5/2 inches)=2π*0.375 ft≈2.3562 ft².

So, C_outer=5 *2.3562≈11.781 Btu/hr-°F.

Wait, but that would make the total conductances:

C_total=C_inner + C_steel + C_insulation + C_outer.

Where:

C_steel=(2π*30*ln(3.5/3))/1≈29.13 Btu/hr-°F.

C_insulation=(2π*0.12*ln(4.5/3.5))/1≈0.190 Btu/hr-°F.

So C_total=39.27 +29.13 +0.190 +11.781≈80.37 Btu/hr-°F.

Then, Q=ΔT/C_total=325/80.37≈4.044 Btu/hr-ft.

That's way too low, so this approach must be wrong.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is approximately 588, but since it's not listed, perhaps the intended answer is option I:615. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_insulation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate R_insulation.

ln(4.5/3.5)=ln(1.2857)=≈0.2505.

Denominator=2π*0.12=0.754.

0.2505/0.754≈0.332.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I:615, and I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the outer diameter of the insulation as 4 inches instead of 4.5, which would change R_insulation.

If Do_insulation=4 inches, then:

ln(4/3.5)=ln(1.1429)=≈0.1335.

Denominator=2π*0.12=0.754.

R_insulation=0.1335/0.754≈0.177.

Then R_total=0.02 +0.000818 +0.177 +0.2=0.397818.

Q=325/0.397818≈817.2, which is higher than any option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option I:615.

After all these calculations, I think the closest option is I:615.

To determine the rate of heat loss per foot length of the pipe, we analyze the system as a series of thermal resistances. The total resistance is the sum of the resistances from the inner surface, steel pipe, insulation, and outer surface. The heat loss is then calculated using the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{total}}}
\]

### Step 1: Thermal Resistances
1. **Inner Surface Resistance**:  
   \[
   R_{\text{inner}} = \frac{1}{C_{\text{inner}}} = \frac{1}{50} = 0.02 \, \text{°F·ft}^2/\text{Btu}
   \]

2. **Steel Pipe Resistance**:  
   The steel has an inner diameter \(D_i = 3 \, \text{in} = 0.25 \, \text{ft}\) and outer diameter \(D_o = 3.5 \, \text{in} = 0.2917 \, \text{ft}\).  
   \[
   R_{\text{steel}} = \frac{\ln(D_o/D_i)}{2\pi k_{\text{steel}} L} = \frac{\ln(0.2917/0.25)}{2\pi \cdot 30 \cdot 1} = \frac{0.1542}{188.4956} \approx 0.000818 \, \text{°F·ft}^2/\text{Btu}
   \]

3. **Insulation Resistance**:  
   The insulation has an inner diameter \(D_i = 3.5 \, \text{in} = 0.2917 \, \text{ft}\) and outer diameter \(D_o = 4.5 \, \text{in} = 0.375 \, \text{ft}\).  
   \[
   R_{\text{insulation}} = \frac{\ln(D_o/D_i)}{2\pi k_{\text{insulation}} L} = \frac{\ln(0.375/0.2917)}{2\pi \cdot 0.12 \cdot 1} = \frac{0.2505}{0.754} \approx 0.332 \, \text{°F·ft}^2/\text{Btu}
   \]

4. **Outer Surface Resistance**:  
   \[
   R_{\text{outer}} = \frac{1}{C_{\text{outer}}} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \, \text{°F·ft}^2/\text{Btu}
   \]

### Step 2: Total Resistance
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{inner}} + R_{\text{steel}} + R_{\text{insulation}} + R_{\text{outer}}
\]
\[
R_{\text{total}} = 0.02 + 0.000818 + 0.332 + 0.2 = 0.552818 \, \text{°F·ft}^2/\text{Btu}
\]

### Step 3: Heat Loss Calculation
The temperature difference is \(\Delta T = 400 - 75 = 325 \, \text{°F}\).  
\[
Q = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{325}{0.552818} \approx 587.7 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}
\]

### Step 4: Closest Option
The calculated heat loss of \(587.7 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}\) does not match any option exactly. However, the closest option is **I: 615 Btu/hr-ft**.
