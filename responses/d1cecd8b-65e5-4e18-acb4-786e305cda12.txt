Question:

A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?

Options:

A: Early Parkinson disease
B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E: Increase in alcohol consumption
F: Hyperthyroidism
G: Bereavement reaction
H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy
I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress
J: Onset of multiple sclerosis

Alright, so I've got this question about a 70-year-old woman with worsening tremors. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, her main issue is a tremor that's been present most of her life. Initially, it was mild and only happened when she was tired or stressed. But now, after a month, it's gotten worse and more noticeable. She's even embarrassed to eat with others because of it. That's the key point—it's getting worse, and it's affecting her daily life, especially socially.

Looking at her medical history, she has essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia with atorvastatin. She also takes occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. Oh, and she used to drink alcohol occasionally but now drinks a glass of wine daily because it reduces her tremor. Hmm, interesting.

She started taking fluoxetine three weeks ago for coping with the death of her husband two months ago. So her stress might be related to the bereavement, but she's on an SSRI now.

The physical exam shows a moderate tremor in both hands that's not at rest. Wait, so it's not a resting tremor. Resting tremors are typically seen in Parkinson's, right? Like when the hands are at rest, they tremble. But here, the tremor isn't present at rest, so maybe it's an action tremor, which is more common in essential tremor.

Her medications include fluoxetine, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. I need to think about whether any of these could cause or worsen tremors. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and some antidepressants can cause tremors as a side effect. But she's only been on it for three weeks, and the tremor started getting worse over the past month. Could the timing be related? Also, she started drinking more wine, which she says helps, but alcohol can sometimes exacerbate tremors in certain conditions or perhaps she's using it as a coping mechanism.

Her BMI is 25, which is normal, so no issues there. Vital signs are normal except for blood pressure, which is 130/85—mildly elevated but controlled with lisinopril. Thyroid tests are pending, but hyperthyroidism can cause tremors too, so that's a consideration, but her symptoms have been present for years, and hyperthyroidism usually presents more acutely.

She's 70, so considering age-related conditions. Essential tremor is common and often presents with action tremors, which worsen with stress or fatigue. The fact that her tremor started mild and got worse with stress and now is more noticeable aligns with essential tremor being exacerbated by stress. Also, the fact that it's both hands is another point for essential tremor, as opposed to Parkinson's, which often starts on one side.

Let me think about the options:

A: Early Parkinson disease. But as I thought earlier, the tremor isn't at rest, so less likely.

B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine. Possible, but tremors can occur with SSRIs. However, she's been on it for three weeks, and the worsening started in the past month. Could be, but also considering other factors.

E: Increase in alcohol consumption. She drinks more wine, which helps, but sometimes alcohol can worsen tremors in some conditions. Wait, but she says it reduces her tremor, so she's using it to self-medicate. If she's using more, maybe it's masking something else. But the tremors are worse despite the alcohol, so perhaps it's not the cause.

F: Hyperthyroidism. Possible, but her symptoms have been chronic, and hyperthyroidism usually has more acute onset. Plus, thyroid tests are pending, but if it were hyperthyroidism, she might have other symptoms like weight loss, palpitations, etc.

I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress. This seems to fit. She's had it for years, and now with the stress of her husband's death and perhaps the recent fluoxetine, the tremors are worse.

G: Bereavement reaction. That's more of a psychological response, but the physical symptom of tremor might be a result of the stress but not the bereavement itself as the cause.

H: Adverse effect of lisinopril. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. I don't think it typically causes tremors. Maybe hypotension, but her BP is 130/85, which is okay.

D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen can cause gastrointestinal issues, but I don't recall it causing tremors. Maybe if she were on higher doses, but she only takes it occasionally.

J: Multiple sclerosis. That's a possibility, but the tremor isn't fitting the typical pattern. MS can cause tremors, but usually with other symptoms like weakness, visual issues, etc. Plus, it's less common at 70 and without other signs.

So putting it all together, her tremor started years ago, got worse with stress, and now is more noticeable. She's on fluoxetine, but the timing could be coincidental. However, the most likely cause is that her essential tremor is getting worse due to stress from her husband's death and possibly the changes in her life, including the medication.

Wait, but could the fluoxetine be contributing? Fluoxetine can cause tremors, but she's been on it for three weeks. The tremor started getting worse over the past month, so maybe the timing is a bit off. Alternatively, the stress from bereavement could be the main factor, making her essential tremor worse.

But the question is asking for the most likely cause. Essential tremor is a common condition, and stress can definitely make it worse. She's using alcohol to manage it, which might be a clue too. So I think the answer is I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress.

The patient presents with a worsening tremor that has been present for most of her life, initially mild and stress-induced, but now more noticeable and socially debilitating. She is 70 years old, with a history of essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and is taking lisinopril, atorvastatin, occasional ibuprofen, and fluoxetine for bereavement. She drinks one glass of wine daily, which she reports reduces her tremor.

Key considerations include the nature of the tremor (not present at rest, suggesting an action tremor) and the chronicity of her symptoms. Essential tremor is a common condition that often presents with action tremors and can worsen with stress. The patient's tremor has progressively worsened over the past month, coinciding with increased stress related to her husband's death and the initiation of fluoxetine. While fluoxetine can cause tremors, the timeline suggests that the primary driver is the exacerbation of her pre-existing essential tremor by stress.

Other options, such as early Parkinson disease (resting tremor), adverse effects of medications (lisinopril, atorvastatin, ibuprofen, or fluoxetine), hyperthyroidism, bereavement reaction, or multiple sclerosis, are less likely given the presentation and lack of supporting evidence.

The most likely cause is the exacerbation of her essential tremor due to stress.

Answer: I
