Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the self-inductance of a toroidal coil. Hmm, I remember that self-inductance depends on a few factors like the number of turns, the area, the length, and the permeability of the core. Let me think about the formula for self-inductance.

I think the formula is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l, right? Where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, N is the number of turns, A is the cross-sectional area, and l is the mean length of the coil. Wait, but for a toroid, the mean length is the circumference, which is 2π times the radius, right? Oh wait, actually, the mean length l for a toroid is 2πR, where R is the mean radius.

Okay, so let's break it down. The coil has a mean radius of 10 cm, which is 0.1 meters. The number of turns N is 1500. First, I need to calculate part (a) with an air core, so μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A.

Wait, but the cross-sectional area A of the toroid... Hmm, the formula for the area is πr², where r is the radius of the cross-section. But wait, in the case of a toroid, the cross-section is usually a circle with radius a, but I think the formula might use the area differently. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, no, I think the formula for self-inductance of a toroid is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l, where A is the area of the cross-section, and l is the mean circumference, which is 2πR. So R here is 0.1 meters.

So, R = 0.1 m. The cross-sectional area A would be π times the square of the radius of the toroid's cross-section. Wait, but the problem only gives the mean radius of the coil, which is R. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let me clarify: the mean radius of the toroidal coil is R = 0.1 m. The cross-sectional area A would be π times the square of the radius of the circular cross-section of the toroid, which I think is usually denoted as a. But the problem doesn't give 'a', so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, I think in the standard formula for a toroid, the cross-sectional area A is the area of the circular section, which is πa², where a is the radius of the circular cross-section. But the problem doesn't give 'a', so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the average area in a different way. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me check the formula again. I think the correct formula for the self-inductance of a toroid is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (2πR), where R is the mean radius of the toroid, and A is the cross-sectional area (πa², with a being the radius of the cross-section). But since the problem doesn't give 'a', maybe I'm misunderstanding what's given. Alternatively, perhaps the mean radius R is the same as the radius of the circular cross-section a. That doesn't seem right because R is the radius of the torus itself, while a is the radius of the circular cross-section.

Wait, but the problem states that the mean radius of the toroidal coil is 10 cm. That's R. The cross-sectional area A would then be πa², but without knowing 'a', I can't calculate A. Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the coil is closely wound, making the cross-sectional area approximately the same as the area of one turn. But no, that's for a straight coil, not a toroid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Oh wait, perhaps the formula for the self-inductance of a toroid is L = μ₀ * N² * A / (2πR), where A is the area of the cross-section. So I need to find A. But the problem doesn't provide 'a', the radius of the cross-section. Hmm, am I missing something?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem says the mean radius of the toroidal coil is 10 cm. So R = 0.1 m. The number of turns N = 1500. For part (a), it's an air core, so μ = μ₀ = 4π × 10^-7 H/m. For part (b), it's an iron core with relative permeability μr = 100, so μ = μ₀ * μr.

But without knowing the cross-sectional area A, I can't compute this. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the coil is wound around a toroidal core with a certain cross-sectional area. But the problem doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the formula is expressed differently. Wait, perhaps the formula for a toroid's self-inductance is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (2πR), where A is the cross-sectional area of the torus. But without knowing 'a', I can't proceed. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a key piece of information.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the cross-sectional area A is the same as the area of a single loop. For a loop, the area would be πr², where r is the radius of the loop. But in a toroid, the loop's radius is R, so A_loop = πR². But that doesn't seem right because the cross-sectional area A of the toroid is different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the formula again. Oh right, the formula for the self-inductance of a toroid is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (2πR), where A is the area of the cross-section of the toroidal core, and R is the mean radius of the toroid. So without knowing A, I can't compute L. But the problem doesn't give A. Did I miss that part?

Wait, the problem only gives the mean radius of the toroidal coil as 10 cm and the number of turns as 1500. So perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the cross-sectional area A is equal to the area of the circular cross-section, which is πa², but without 'a', I can't find it. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to calculate A as the area of the loop, which is πR², but that would be the area of the loop, not the cross-section of the toroid.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm confusing the loop area with the toroid's cross-sectional area. Let me think: each turn of the toroid is a loop with radius R, so the area of each loop is πR². But the toroid itself has a cross-sectional area A, which is the area of the circular cross-section of the toroidal core. So, for example, if the toroidal core has a circular cross-section with radius a, then A = πa². But without knowing a, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem is missing some data, or I'm misunderstanding the terms.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a coil that's not toroidal, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the cross-sectional area A is the same as the area of the loop, which would be πR². But that doesn't make sense because in a toroid, the loop's radius is R, but the cross-sectional area is different.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the cross-sectional area A is equal to the area of the loop, which is πR². Although that's probably incorrect, perhaps that's what the problem expects. So let's try that.

So R = 0.1 m. A = πR² = π*(0.1)^2 = π*0.01 ≈ 0.031416 m².

Then, l, the mean length, is 2πR = 2π*0.1 ≈ 0.6283 m.

Now, using the formula L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l.

Plugging in the numbers:

μ₀ = 4π × 10^-7 H/m.

N = 1500.

A = 0.031416 m².

l = 0.6283 m.

So,

L = (4π × 10^-7) * (1500)^2 * 0.031416 / 0.6283.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute (1500)^2 = 2,250,000.

Multiply by A: 2,250,000 * 0.031416 ≈ 70,685.82.

Multiply by μ₀: 4π × 10^-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6.

So 1.2566e-6 * 70,685.82 ≈ 0.0888.

Now divide by l: 0.0888 / 0.6283 ≈ 0.14137 H, which is 141.37 mH.

Wait, that's for part (a), air core. Then part (b) would be 100 times that, because μ increases by 100. So 141.37 * 100 = 14,137 mH, which is 14.137 H.

Looking at the options, option D is (a) 141.37mH, (b) 14.137 H. So that's D.

Wait, but earlier I assumed that A was πR², which might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the cross-sectional area A of the toroid is πa², where a is the radius of the toroidal core's cross-section. But without knowing 'a', I can't compute A. So maybe the problem expects me to consider A as the area of the loop, which is πR². Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The correct formula for the self-inductance of a toroid is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (2πR), where A is the cross-sectional area of the toroidal core, and R is the mean radius of the toroid. So if the problem doesn't give A, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the cross-sectional area A is the same as the area of the loop, which is πR². But that would make A = π*(0.1)^2 = 0.031416 m², as I did earlier.

So proceeding with that, I get L = 141.37 mH for part (a), and 14.137 H for part (b), which matches option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (2πR), and I've used the correct approach. So I think the answer is D.

The self-inductance of a toroidal coil is calculated using the formula:

\[
L = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot N^2 \cdot A}{2\pi R}
\]

Where:
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \) (permeability of free space),
- \( N = 1500 \) (number of turns),
- \( R = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) (mean radius of the toroid),
- \( A = \pi R^2 \) (cross-sectional area of the toroid, assuming the loop area).

### Part (a): Air Core
1. Calculate \( A \):
   \[
   A = \pi (0.1)^2 = 0.031416 \, \text{m}^2
   \]
2. Calculate \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot (1500)^2 \cdot 0.031416}{2\pi \cdot 0.1} \approx 141.37 \, \text{mH}
   \]

### Part (b): Iron Core (Relative Permeability \( \mu_r = 100 \))
The permeability becomes \( \mu = \mu_0 \cdot \mu_r = 4\pi \times 10^{-5} \, \text{H/m} \). Using the same formula:

\[
L = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-5}) \cdot (1500)^2 \cdot 0.031416}{2\pi \cdot 0.1} \approx 14.137 \, \text{H}
\]

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**D: (a) 141.37mH, (b) 14.137 Henrys**
