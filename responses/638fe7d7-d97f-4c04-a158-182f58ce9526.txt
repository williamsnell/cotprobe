Question:

In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail

Options:

A: if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.
B: because the Girl Scouts of America did not know about their ownership until 2009.
C: because the tenant continued to occupy the apartment building after the landowner's death.
D: because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.
E: if the tenant was never formally notified about the landowner's will.
F: if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.
G: because the statutory period for adverse possession had not yet been reached.
H: if the tenant claimed to have bought the apartment building from the landowner before her death.
I: because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.
J: if the tenant made significant improvements to the apartment building.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about property ownership and leases. Let me read through the problem again and break it down step by step.

So, in 1985, a landowner leased an apartment building to a tenant for seven years. The rent was due each month on the first day. Then, in 1986, the landowner died without any heirs and left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America in her will. Importantly, the will didn't mention the apartment building specifically. 

After the landowner's death, the tenant learned about her death and decided to stay but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts didn't find out about their ownership until 2009 when they did an inventory. The question is about whether the Girl Scouts would prevail in an ejection action against the tenant. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I need to understand the legal principles here. The key issue seems to be the transfer of ownership upon the landowner's death and the tenant's rights under the lease. Also, the mention of adverse possession with a 20-year statutory period is important.

When the landowner died, the apartment building was part of her estate. Since it wasn't mentioned in the will, under intestacy laws, it would typically go to her heirs. But since she left everything to the Girl Scouts, maybe the will's broad gift includes all her property, including the building. But wait, the will didn't specifically mention the building. So, does that mean it's included in the estate? I think so because she left her "entire estate," which would include all her assets, unless she had a separate deed or some other arrangement. So the Girl Scouts would take ownership upon her death.

Now, the tenant was leasing the property from the landowner. When the landowner died, the lease would transfer to her estate, right? Because the lease is a contract, and upon the death of the lessor, the lease continues with the estate. So the tenant is still bound by the terms of the lease, including paying rent. But the tenant stopped paying rent after learning of her death, which could be a breach of the lease.

The Girl Scouts didn't know about their ownership until 2009. So from 1986 until 2009, the tenant was in possession, and the Girl Scouts were the owners but didn't know. Then, in 2009, they found out and presumably took action. But the question is about an ejection action, so they want to evict the tenant.

Now, the tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner's death. If the lease requires monthly rent, stopping payments would be a default, giving the landlord (now the Girl Scouts) the right to terminate the lease and evict the tenant. But wait, the tenant didn't know about the ownership change immediately. They found out and decided to stay but not pay rent. So their intent was to remain but not pay rent, which is a partial breach.

Another consideration is adverse possession. The statutory period is 20 years. Adverse possession requires continuous, open, and notorious use of the property without the owner's permission for the statutory period. Here, the tenant has been there since 1986, which is over 20 years by 2006. But the Girl Scouts only found out in 2009, so perhaps the tenant has met the adverse possession requirement by then. But wait, the tenant was paying rent until the landowner died. After that, he stopped. So from 1986 until 2009, he was paying rent to the landowner's estate? Or was he not paying because he thought he didn't have to?

No, the tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner's death. So from 1986 onward, he stopped paying. The Girl Scouts didn't know until 2009. So from 1986 to 2009, the tenant was in possession without paying rent. That's 23 years. So the statutory period of 20 years would have been met by 2006. So if the tenant can claim adverse possession, he might have a defense.

But wait, the Girl Scouts are the new owners. Did the tenant's possession after 1986 without permission (since they didn't know) count as adverse possession? Because if the tenant was paying rent to the wrong party (the landowner's estate, which the Girl Scouts didn't know about), does that count as paying rent to the owner? Or was the tenant in possession without the owner's permission, which is required for adverse possession.

Alternatively, the lease was with the landowner, and upon her death, the lease continues with the estate. So the tenant was still under a lease agreement, even if the estate didn't enforce it. So the tenant was lawfully in possession under the lease until the lease term ended. The lease was for seven years, from 1985, so it would end in 1992. Wait, the lease term started in 1985 for seven years, so it would end in 1992. But the tenant stayed beyond that, from 1992 onward, without a lease. But the problem says the lease term is seven years, and the death was in 1986, so the lease would have ended in 1992. So from 1986 to 1992, the tenant was still under the lease, and from 1992 onward, he was a holdover tenant.

But the tenant stopped paying rent after 1986. So even during the lease term, he stopped paying. That would be a breach, giving the landlord the right to terminate the lease. So the Girl Scouts, as successors, could terminate the lease and evict the tenant even before the term ends. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the lease continues after the landowner's death, and the tenant is still bound by it. The tenant's failure to pay rent would be a breach, allowing the landlord (Girl Scouts) to terminate the lease and evict the tenant. But since the Girl Scouts didn't know until 2009, maybe the lease was considered terminated when the rent wasn't paid, but the tenant was still in possession. So the Girl Scouts could sue for possession once they found out.

But the question is whether the Girl Scouts will prevail in an ejection action. So the defenses would be whether the tenant has a valid lease, whether he's in adverse possession, etc.

Looking at the options:

A: If the tenant believed the lease was still in effect. But the lease was for seven years, and the landowner died in 1986, so the lease would end in 1992. So after 1992, the lease was over, and the tenant was a holdover. Whether he believed the lease was still in effect might not matter if the term had expired. But if the lease was still in effect, his belief wouldn't change that. Maybe A isn't the right reason.

B: Because the Girl Scouts didn't know until 2009. But knowledge alone doesn't determine ownership. They had ownership from 1986, regardless of when they found out. So this might not be the reason they prevail. They can still enforce their rights once they know.

C: Because the tenant continued to occupy after the landowner's death. But that's a given, but does that mean the Girl Scouts can evict? The tenant was under a lease until 1992, and after that, he was a holdover. So the Girl Scouts could evict him after the lease term, regardless of when they found out.

D: Because the tenant stopped paying rent after the death. Well, the tenant was supposed to pay rent each month. Stopping payments would be a breach, allowing the landlord to terminate the lease. But the lease term ended in 1992, so after that, the tenant was a holdover, and the landlord could evict for any reason or no reason, as long as they give proper notice.

E: If the tenant wasn't notified about the will. But the will's terms don't require notification; the tenant's lease is with the original owner, and upon death, the estate takes over. The tenant's lack of notification doesn't affect the lease's validity.

F: If the tenant leased to someone else while in military service. That's probably about the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, which allows a tenant to terminate a lease if called to military service. But this option isn't directly relevant to the ownership issue between the tenant and the Girl Scouts.

G: Because the statutory period for adverse possession wasn't reached. Wait, the statutory period is 20 years. From 1986 to 2009 is 23 years. So the period was reached by 2006. If the tenant can claim adverse possession, he might have a defense. But whether the tenant's possession was adverse is key. If the tenant was under a lease, even an expired one, then he didn't have adverse possession because he had permission, even if he wasn't paying rent. So maybe G is incorrect because the period was reached, but the tenant's possession wasn't adverse.

H: If the tenant claimed to have bought the building before her death. If the tenant bought it, that would end the lease, but the problem states the tenant didn't buy it; he just stopped paying rent. So H isn't applicable.

I: Because the tenant never paid taxes. Unpaid taxes go to the government via tax liens, not the owner. So this doesn't affect ownership between the Girl Scouts and the tenant.

J: If the tenant made significant improvements. Improvements can sometimes affect ownership in some circumstances, but not in this case. The tenant doesn't own the property unless he has a deed, which he doesn't.

Wait, but going back to the issue of adverse possession. For adverse possession, the possession must be without the owner's permission. If the tenant was under a lease, even an expired one, he had permission to be there. So his possession wasn't adverse; it was permissive. Therefore, he can't claim adverse possession because he was still under the lease terms until the lease ended. After the lease ended in 1992, he became a holdover tenant. Holdover tenants are still under the original lease's terms unless the landlord takes action. So the landlord (Girl Scouts) could evict him, but he didn't gain ownership through adverse possession because he wasn't in possession adverse to the owner's interest.

So the Girl Scouts would prevail because the tenant's possession was under a lease, which they could terminate for non-payment. Once the lease term ended in 1992, they could evict him for any reason. The fact that they didn't know until 2009 doesn't change their right to evict once they found out.

Looking at the options again, the correct reason would be D: because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death. Because the tenant's failure to pay rent after the landowner's death would be a breach of the lease, giving the landlord the right to terminate the lease and evict the tenant. Since the lease was with the landowner's estate, the Girl Scouts, upon discovering their ownership, can enforce the termination of the lease and eject the tenant.

Wait, but option C says because the tenant continued to occupy after the landowner's death. But that's not the reason the Girl Scouts win; it's the fact that the tenant stopped paying rent. So D seems more accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the Girl Scouts can evict regardless of the lease because the lease term ended in 1992, and after that, the tenant was a holdover, and they can evict for any reason. But the question is about the reason for their prevail.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G: because the statutory period for adverse possession had not yet been reached. Wait, no, because the period was reached by 2006, but the tenant didn't have adverse possession because he was under a lease. So G is not the reason.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

- The lease was for seven years, starting 1985, ending 1992.

- In 1986, the landowner dies, and the Girl Scouts own the building.

- The tenant stops paying rent in 1986.

- The lease term ends in 1992. After that, the tenant is a holdover.

- The Girl Scouts didn't know until 2009.

So, after 1992, the tenant is a holdover, and the Girl Scouts can evict him for any reason. The fact that he stopped paying rent in 1986 would have allowed them to terminate the lease earlier, but once the lease term is over, they can proceed with eviction regardless.

But the question is about why the Girl Scouts will prevail. The options are the reasons. So the correct reason would be because the tenant stopped paying rent, which is option D.

Wait, but the lease term ended in 1992, so after that, the tenant was a holdover. So the Girl Scouts could evict him for any reason, regardless of the lease. But the tenant's non-payment during the lease term would have given them the right to terminate earlier.

So the correct answer is D: because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.

The key issue is whether the Girl Scouts of America can prevail in an ejection action against the tenant. The tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner's death, which constitutes a breach of the lease agreement. The lease term ended in 1992, but the tenant's failure to pay rent after 1986 provided the landlord (the Girl Scouts, as successors to the estate) with the right to terminate the lease and evict the tenant. The Girl Scouts' lack of knowledge until 2009 does not affect their ownership or their ability to enforce their rights once they discovered them. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.

Answer: D
