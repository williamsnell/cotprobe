Okay, so I've got this cam design problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on cam design, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says it's a plate cam causing a reciprocating roller follower to execute simple harmonic motion. The maximum displacement is 2 inches. The motion consists of a rise over 140 degrees and a fall over 160 degrees of cam rotation. The roller radius is 1 inch, and the pressure angle shouldn't exceed 35 degrees. I need to find two things: the perpendicular distance between the follower axis and the camshaft axis, and the smallest possible size of the cam for noiseless and efficient functioning.

Hmm. Alright, let's start with the basics. In cam design, the follower's motion is determined by the cam profile. Since it's a plate cam, the follower moves perpendicular to the cam's axis. The displacement is simple harmonic, which usually implies a sinusoidal motion. But here, the rise and fall are over different angles—140 and 160 degrees. Wait, that adds up to 300 degrees, which is less than a full 360. So maybe the remaining 60 degrees is some dwell?

But wait, the problem says the motion comprises a rise for 140° and a fall for 160°, so perhaps the total cycle is 300°, and the remaining 60° is when the follower isn't moving—like dwell. But I'm not entirely sure if that's how it's supposed to work. Maybe it's a different kind of motion, but since it's SHM, the displacement follows a sine or cosine curve.

The maximum displacement is 2 inches. In SHM, the displacement can be modeled as y = A sin(θ), where A is the amplitude. The amplitude here is 2 inches because the maximum displacement is 2 inches. But wait, the roller follower has a radius of 1 inch, so that might come into play with the base circle radius.

Wait, the base circle radius is the radius of the cam when there's no lift. The perpendicular distance between the follower axis and the camshaft is often referred to as the offset, 'd'. So, the displacement of the follower is related to the rotation of the cam.

In roller followers, the motion is transmitted through the contact between the cam and the roller. The pressure angle is the angle between the line of action and the tangent to the base circle at the point of contact. It's given that the pressure angle shouldn't exceed 35 degrees.

So, for the perpendicular distance (d), I think it's calculated using the relationship between the amplitude of the SHM, the radius of the roller, and the pressure angle.

Wait, in SHM, the displacement is maximum at 90 degrees, but here the rise is over 140 degrees. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the cycloid motion or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using the radius of the base circle and the perpendicular distance.

Wait, I remember that for a reciprocating roller follower, the displacement y can be expressed in terms of the rotation angle θ of the cam. The displacement equation for SHM is y = A sin(θ), where A is the maximum displacement, which is 2 inches here.

But the displacement is also related to the cam's rotation. The cam rotates through 140 degrees to lift the follower to the maximum displacement, which is 2 inches. Wait, but in SHM, the displacement goes from 0 to maximum at 90 degrees, so maybe the 140 degrees is the total angle for the rise and the fall?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The total angle for the rise is 140 degrees, and the fall is 160 degrees. So the total cycle is 300 degrees, and the remaining 60 degrees is when the follower isn't moving—dwelling.

Wait no, in some cam designs, the rise and fall are parts of the same cycle. So, the total rotation is 360 degrees, but the rise takes 140 degrees, the fall takes 160 degrees, and the remaining 60 degrees is dwell.

Wait, but the problem states "the motion comprises of a rise for 140° and a fall for 160° of the cam rotation." So perhaps it's a total of 300°, meaning that the cam makes a full 360°, but the follower only moves during 140° and 160°, and dwells for the remaining 60°. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the cam rotates once, and the rise occurs over 140°, and the fall over 160°, making the total cycle 300°, with 60° dwell. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, I think I should focus on the SHM part. The displacement is SHM, so the equation is y = A sin(θ), where A is 2 inches. The displacement starts at 0, goes up to 2 inches at θ = 90°, and back to 0 at θ = 180°, but in this case, the rise is over 140°, which is longer than 90°, so maybe the SHM is adjusted.

Wait, perhaps the cam's rotation angle for the rise is 140°, so the SHM can be expressed as y = A sin(θ * (π/140)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the total angle for the rise is 140°, so the SHM goes from 0 to 2 inches over that angle.

Wait, maybe I should model the displacement as a function of the rotation angle. Since it's SHM, the displacement is sinusoidal, but the period is 140° for the rise and 160° for the fall. Hmm, perhaps the rise is from 0 to 2 inches over 140°, and the fall back over 160°, which is a bit asymmetric.

Alternatively, maybe it's a harmonic motion where the total cycle is 300°, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The displacement is 2 inches, so the amplitude A is 2 inches. The displacement equation for SHM is y = A sin(ωt + φ), but in terms of the cam angle θ, perhaps y = A sin(θ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the maximum displacement is 2 inches, so when θ = 90°, y would be maximum. But in this problem, the rise occurs over 140°, so perhaps the SHM is stretched or compressed in the angular domain.

Wait, perhaps the displacement is designed such that the maximum displacement occurs at θ = 140°, so the SHM function would be y = A sin(θ * (π/140)). That way, at θ = 140°, y would reach A. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, maybe the displacement is sinusoidal, and the angle θ is measured from the start of the rise. So, when θ = 0°, y=0; when θ=140°, y=2 inches. So, the amplitude A would be 2 inches, and the function would be y = 2 sin(θ * (π/140)), since 140° is the angle where y reaches maximum.

Wait, that makes sense because at θ=140°, sin(π) = 0, but wait, no. Wait, 140 degrees is 140*(π/180) radians, which is about 2.443 radians. So, if I use y = 2 sin(θ * (π/140)), then at θ=140°, y=2 sin(π) = 0. That's not right. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the phase.

Wait, maybe the function should be y = 2 sin(θ * (π/140) - π/2), so that at θ=0°, y=0, and at θ=140°, y=2 sin(π - π/2) = 2 sin(π/2) = 2 inches. That might work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as y = 2 sin(θ * (π/140) + φ), where φ is a phase shift. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the displacement in terms of the cam's rotation. The rise occurs over 140°, so the displacement goes from 0 to 2 inches as the cam rotates from 0 to 140°, and then the displacement falls back to 0 as the cam rotates another 160°, for a total of 300°, with the remaining 60° being dwell. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the total rotation is 360°, with the rise taking 140°, the fall taking 160°, and the remaining 60° being dwell. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the pressure angle and the perpendicular distance. The pressure angle (α) is the angle between the line of motion and the tangent to the base circle. For a plate cam with a roller follower, the relationship between the perpendicular distance (d), the base circle radius (r), and the pressure angle is given by tan(α) = d / (r + a), where 'a' is the radius of the roller. Wait, no, maybe it's tan(α) = (r + a) / d. Wait, I think it's tan(alpha) = (r + a) / d, where d is the offset.

Wait, let me think again. The pressure angle α is the angle between the line of action (which is the direction of displacement of the follower) and the tangent to the base circle at the point of contact. So, in a reciprocating roller follower, the line of action is perpendicular to the motion of the follower, which is along the axis of the follower.

So, the line of action is along the displacement direction. The base circle has radius r, and the roller has radius a (1 inch). The offset between the cam and follower axes is d. So, the distance from the cam center to the point where the roller touches the cam is r + a. The tangent at that point makes an angle alpha with the line of action.

Wait, perhaps the relationship is tan(alpha) = (r + a) / d. Because the line of action is at a distance d from the cam center, and the tangent line is at a point where the distance from the cam center is r + a (since the roller has radius a). So, the triangle formed would have opposite side (r + a) and adjacent side d, so tan(alpha) = (r + a)/d.

Wait, that makes sense. So, tan(alpha) = (r + a)/d. Since alpha is given as 35 degrees, and a is 1 inch, we can write:

tan(35°) = (r + 1) / d → d = (r + 1) / tan(35°)

But I don't know r or d yet. However, I think there's another relationship involving the displacement and the base circle radius and the offset.

Wait, the maximum displacement of the follower is 2 inches. The displacement y is related to the rotation of the cam. Since it's a reciprocating motion, the displacement is equal to the length by which the follower moves from its lowest to highest position. The displacement y is equal to the distance the follower moves, which is related to the cam's rotation.

Wait, the displacement is also connected to the base circle radius and the offset. The maximum displacement occurs when the roller is at a certain point on the cam. Maybe when the line of action is along the line connecting the cam center to the point of contact, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum displacement is equal to the length of the arc that the follower moves through. Wait, but the follower is moving straight, so maybe it's the difference in position due to the rotation of the cam around the base circle.

Wait, perhaps the displacement y can be expressed as y = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's y = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the position of the follower. The position of the follower's axis is at a distance d from the cam center. The roller touches the cam at a point, and as the cam rotates, the point of contact moves, causing the follower to reciprocate.

The displacement y of the follower can be found using the geometry of the system. The displacement y is equal to the difference in the position of the contact point relative to the follower's axis.

Wait, perhaps when the cam rotates by an angle θ, the point of contact on the cam is at an angle θ from the reference position. The coordinates of the contact point relative to the cam center would be (r cos θ, r sin θ). But considering the offset d, the actual position of the contact point relative to the follower's axis would be (r cos θ - d, r sin θ).

Wait, no, maybe the follower's axis is offset by d from the cam center along the x-axis. So, the cam is rotating, and the follower's axis is at (d, 0) relative to the cam center. The contact point on the cam is at (r cos θ, r sin θ) relative to the cam center. The roller's center is at (d + r cos θ, r sin θ). But the follower moves such that the roller's center moves along a straight line, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the displacement y is the vertical component of the movement of the follower's axis. Wait, no, the follower's axis is fixed at a distance d from the cam center, but as the cam rotates, the point where the roller touches the cam moves, causing the follower to move up and down.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement y is given by the vertical distance between the highest and lowest points of the contact point. Wait, the maximum displacement would then be the difference between the highest and lowest positions.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should use the formula that relates the maximum displacement (y_max) to the base circle radius (r), the offset (d), and the amplitude of the SHM.

Wait, the displacement in SHM is given by y = A sin(θ), where A is 2 inches. The maximum displacement occurs when sin(theta) = 1, so y_max = 2 inches. 

But how does this relate to the cam's geometry? The displacement is caused by the rotation of the cam. The maximum displacement would occur when the point of contact is at a certain position relative to the follower's axis.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement y_max is related to the base circle radius and the offset by the equation y_max = (r + a) sin(alpha), where alpha is the angle at which the displacement is maximum. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the line of action and the pressure angle, the displacement can be related to the base circle radius and the offset. Wait, I think I need to find a way to express the maximum displacement in terms of r and d.

Wait, another approach: the maximum displacement of the follower is equal to the sum of the base circle radius and the offset, multiplied by the sine of the pressure angle. Wait, that might not be correct, but let's think.

Wait, when the follower is at maximum displacement, the point of contact is such that the line of action is perpendicular to the base circle's tangent at that point. The pressure angle is 35 degrees, so perhaps the maximum displacement can be expressed using that angle.

Wait, considering the triangle formed by the cam center (O), the point of contact (P), and the follower's center (F). The distance between O and F is d. The radius of the base circle is r, and the radius of the roller is a =1 inch. So, the distance OP is r + a (since the roller touches the cam). The line FP is the line of action, which is perpendicular to the tangent at P. The pressure angle α is the angle between the line FP and the tangent at P.

Wait, no, the pressure angle is between the line of action (FP) and the line OP (from cam center to P). Wait, no, the pressure angle is the angle between the line of action and the normal to the tangent, which is the line OP. Wait, no, the tangent is at P, so the normal is OP. The line of action is FP, which is the direction of the force. The pressure angle is the angle between FP and the normal (OP). So, the pressure angle α is the angle between FP and OP.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is formed by O, P, and F. O is the cam center, P is the contact point, and F is the follower's center. The line FP is the line of action, and the line OP is the radius at the contact point. The pressure angle α is the angle between FP and OP.

In this triangle, OP = r + a, FP = r + a (since the point P is on the cam's surface, and the follower's center is at F, which is a distance d from O, but the distance FP is along the line of action. Wait, no, FP is the line of action, but F is offset by d from O.

Wait, perhaps using the cosine law in triangle OPF. The sides are OP = r + a, OF = d, and FP = ?

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometry. The angle at P is 90 degrees because the line of action is perpendicular to the tangent, which is the direction of the radius OP. Wait, no, the tangent is perpendicular to OP, so the line of action (FP) is along the tangent, which is perpendicular to OP. Wait, no, that can't be right because the line of action is the direction in which the follower moves, which is along the tangent to the path of the contact point.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to draw a diagram mentally. The cam rotates, and the follower's roller touches the cam at point P. The follower's axis is at a distance d from the cam center. The line FP is the line of action, which is the direction of the force exerted on the follower. The tangent at P is the direction in which the point P is moving as the cam rotates. The line of action is along the tangent at P.

The pressure angle α is the angle between the line of action (tangent) and the line FP. Wait, no, the pressure angle is the angle between the line of action and the line perpendicular to the tangent, which is OP. So, the pressure angle is the angle between FP (line of action) and OP (radius at P). So, in triangle OPF, OP is (r + a), OF is d, and FP is the line of action, which is the direction of displacement.

Wait, but FP is the line of action, which is the direction of the force, so it's along the tangent at P, making an angle alpha with OP. So, in triangle OPF, OP is (r + a), OF is d, and angle at P is alpha.

Wait, perhaps using the sine of alpha. In triangle OPF, the side opposite to angle alpha is OF, which is d. The hypotenuse is OP, which is (r + a). So, sin(alpha) = d / (r + a). Wait, that can't be right because if alpha is 35 degrees, then d = (r + a) * sin(alpha).

Wait, but I think I might have it reversed. Let me think again. The angle at P is alpha, which is between OP and FP. So, in triangle OPF, OP is (r + a), FP is the line of action, and OF is d.

Wait, perhaps using the cosine law here. The angle at P is alpha, so:

FP² = OP² + OF² - 2 * OP * OF * cos(alpha)

But FP is the line of action, which is the displacement direction, and its length would relate to the displacement. Wait, but I'm not sure how to connect this to the maximum displacement of 2 inches.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum displacement y_max is equal to the vertical component of the movement of the follower's center. Wait, the follower's center moves as the cam rotates, so the displacement y would be the vertical distance between the highest and lowest positions of the follower's center.

Wait, when the cam rotates, the point P moves, and the follower's center F moves such that FP is always along the tangent at P. The vertical displacement of F would be determined by the rotation of the cam.

Wait, perhaps the vertical displacement y is given by the difference in the y-coordinates of F as the cam rotates. Let's model this.

Let’s consider the cam center at O (0,0). The follower's center is at F (d, 0) when the cam is at angle 0°. As the cam rotates by an angle θ, the point P on the cam is at (r cos θ, r sin θ). The line FP must be tangent to the cam at P, so the slope of FP is perpendicular to OP. The slope of OP is (sin θ)/(cos θ) = tan θ, so the slope of FP is -cot θ.

But FP passes through F (d, 0) and P (r cos θ, r sin θ). The slope of FP is (r sin θ - 0)/(r cos θ - d) = (r sin θ)/(r cos θ - d). This slope must be equal to -cot θ, since it's perpendicular to OP.

So, (r sin θ)/(r cos θ - d) = -cot θ
=> (r sin θ)/(r cos θ - d) = -cos θ / sin θ
Cross-multiplying:
r sin^2 θ = -cos θ (r cos θ - d)
r sin^2 θ = -r cos^2 θ + d cos θ
Bring all terms to one side:
r (sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ) = d cos θ
Since sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1:
r = d cos θ
So, cos θ = r / d

Wait, that's interesting. So, for any angle θ, cos θ = r/d.

But wait, that can't be right because θ varies as the cam rotates, but r and d are constants. So, this suggests that cos θ is constant, which would mean θ is fixed, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the derivation.

Let me check the earlier steps. The slope of FP is (r sin θ)/(r cos θ - d), and the slope must be equal to -cot θ (since it's perpendicular to OP, whose slope is tan θ).

So, (r sin θ)/(r cos θ - d) = -cot θ = -cos θ / sin θ.

Cross-multiplying gives:

r sin^2 θ = -cos θ (r cos θ - d)
r sin^2 θ = -r cos^2 θ + d cos θ
r (sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ) = d cos θ
r = d cos θ
So, cos θ = r/d.

Hmm, this suggests that for any angle θ, cos θ = r/d, which would only be possible if θ is the same for all positions. That doesn't make sense, so I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the line FP is not just the tangent but also that the point P lies on the cam's base circle. So, the equation for the cam is x^2 + y^2 = r^2. The point P is (r cos θ, r sin θ). The slope of OP is (sin θ)/(cos θ) = tan θ, so the slope of FP, being perpendicular, is -cot θ.

The line FP passes through F (d, 0) and P (r cos θ, r sin θ). So, the slope of FP is (r sin θ - 0)/(r cos θ - d) = (r sin θ)/(r cos θ - d). This slope should equal -cot θ, so:

(r sin θ)/(r cos θ - d) = -cos θ / sin θ
Multiply both sides by (r cos θ - d) and sin θ:
r sin^2 θ = -cos θ (r cos θ - d)
Expanding:
r sin^2 θ = -r cos^2 θ + d cos θ
Bring all terms to left:
r sin^2 θ + r cos^2 θ - d cos θ = 0
r (sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ) = d cos θ
r = d cos θ
So, cos θ = r/d.

But θ varies, so this equation implies that d must vary, which isn't possible. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption in setting up the problem.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the line FP is not just the tangent but also that the point P is on the base circle. So, maybe the correct approach is to model the displacement y as a function of θ, considering the SHM.

The displacement y is given by SHM as y = A sin(θ), where A is 2 inches. But how does this relate to the cam's geometry?

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement y is equal to the vertical component of the movement of the follower's center. The follower's center moves from (d, 0) to some point (d, y). Wait, no, the displacement is along the y-axis, so the vertical movement is y.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement occurs when the line FP is vertical. So, when the line FP is vertical, the follower's center F is at (d, y_max), and the point P is at (r cos θ, r sin θ). The line FP is vertical, so the x-coordinate of F and P must be the same. So, r cos θ = d.

At this point, the y-coordinate of P is r sin θ, and the displacement y of F is equal to the vertical distance from F's original position (d, 0) to its new position (d, y). So, y = r sin θ.

But since at maximum displacement, y = 2 inches, we have r sin θ = 2. But from earlier, r cos θ = d. So, we have two equations:

1. r cos θ = d
2. r sin θ = 2

Squaring and adding both equations:

r^2 (cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ) = d^2 + 4
r^2 = d^2 + 4

But I also have the pressure angle condition. The pressure angle α is the angle between the line FP (which is vertical in this case) and the line OP. Wait, when FP is vertical, the angle between FP and OP is θ. Because OP is at an angle θ from the x-axis, and FP is vertical (along the y-axis), so the angle between OP and FP is θ.

Wait, but the pressure angle is given as 35 degrees. So, θ = 35 degrees.

Wait, that makes sense. So, θ = 35 degrees. Then, from equation 2: r sin(35°) = 2 inches. So, r = 2 / sin(35°).

Calculating sin(35°): approximately 0.5736.

So, r ≈ 2 / 0.5736 ≈ 3.485 inches.

From equation 1: d = r cos(35°) ≈ 3.485 * cos(35°). Cos(35°) is about 0.8192.

So, d ≈ 3.485 * 0.8192 ≈ 2.85 inches.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have d around 2.85 inches. The options are all under 2 inches. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the pressure angle. Let me think again. The pressure angle is the angle between the line of action (FP) and the normal to the tangent (OP). When FP is vertical, the line OP is at angle θ from the x-axis, and the angle between FP (vertical) and OP is θ. But the pressure angle is given as 35 degrees, so θ is 35 degrees. So that part seems correct.

But wait, the follower's displacement is 2 inches, so y = 2 inches. So, when FP is vertical, the displacement y is at maximum, which is 2 inches. So, in that case, r sin θ = 2 inches. That part seems correct.

But according to this, r is about 3.485 inches, and d is about 2.85 inches. But none of the options match this. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the displacement isn't directly r sin θ, but includes the offset d. Let me think again.

The displacement y is the vertical movement of the follower's center. The follower's center is at (d, 0) initially. When the cam rotates by θ, the point P is at (r cos θ, r sin θ). The line FP is vertical, so the x-coordinate of P must equal the x-coordinate of F, which is d. So, r cos θ = d. The y-coordinate of F is then equal to the y-coordinate of P, which is r sin θ. So, the displacement y is r sin θ - 0 = r sin θ. So, y = r sin θ.

But according to the problem, y_max = 2 inches, so r sin θ = 2. Also, from r cos θ = d.

So, r^2 = d^2 + (2)^2 → r^2 = d^2 + 4.

But we also have the pressure angle condition. The pressure angle α is 35 degrees, which is the angle between FP (vertical) and OP. Wait, when FP is vertical, the angle between FP and OP is θ. So, θ = 35 degrees.

So, r sin(35) = 2 → r ≈ 3.485 inches.

d = r cos(35) ≈ 3.485 * 0.8192 ≈ 2.85 inches.

But looking at the options, the perpendicular distance (d) is given as options like 1.2, 1.35, 1.5, etc. So, 2.85 is way too high. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the displacement is not r sin θ, but something else. Let me think again about the geometry.

The follower's center F is at (d, 0). The point P on the cam is at (r cos θ, r sin θ). The line FP is the line of action, which is tangent to the cam at P. The slope of OP is (sin θ)/(cos θ) = tan θ. The slope of FP is perpendicular to OP, so it's -cot θ.

The equation of FP can be written as y = -cot θ (x - d). Since point P lies on this line, substituting P's coordinates:

r sin θ = -cot θ (r cos θ - d)
r sin θ = -(cos θ / sin θ) (r cos θ - d)
Multiply both sides by sin θ:
r sin^2 θ = -cos θ (r cos θ - d)
r sin^2 θ = -r cos^2 θ + d cos θ
r (sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ) = d cos θ
r = d cos θ → cos θ = r/d

Now, the maximum displacement y_max occurs when the follower is at its highest point. The displacement y is the vertical movement of F, which would be the difference in the y-coordinates of F and P when FP is vertical. Wait, no, F doesn't move vertically; its position changes as the cam rotates, but the displacement is along the line of action.

Wait, perhaps the displacement y is the vertical component of the movement of the follower's center. Wait, no, the follower's center moves along a path determined by the cam's rotation and the offset d.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum displacement y_max is the vertical distance between the highest and lowest positions of the point P. So, when P is at the top of the cam, y is maximum, and when it's at the bottom, y is minimum. So, the maximum displacement would be twice the maximum y-coordinate of P.

Wait, but P's maximum y-coordinate is r, so the displacement would be 2r. But the problem states that y_max is 2 inches, so 2r = 2 → r = 1 inch. But that can't be right because then d would be r cos θ = cos(35°) ≈ 0.8192 inches. Looking at the options, option B has d=1.35, which is higher than that. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the displacement is not directly related to r but involves the offset d and the pressure angle.

Earlier, I had the equation tan(alpha) = (r + a)/d, where alpha is 35°, and a is 1 inch. So, tan(35°) = (r + 1)/d → d = (r + 1)/tan(35°).

I can calculate tan(35°) ≈ 0.7002.

So, d ≈ (r + 1)/0.7002.

But I also have the equation from before, r = d cos(theta), where theta is 35°, so r = d cos(35°) ≈ d * 0.8192.

Substituting into the first equation:

d ≈ (0.8192 d + 1)/0.7002

Multiply both sides by 0.7002:

0.7002 d ≈ 0.8192 d + 1

0.7002 d - 0.8192 d ≈ 1

-0.119 d ≈ 1

d ≈ -1 / 0.119 ≈ -8.403 inches.

Wait, that can't be right because d is a distance and should be positive. So, I must have made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is tan(alpha) = (r + a)/d. So, tan(35°) = (r + 1)/d → d = (r + 1)/tan(35°).

And from the displacement, we have the maximum displacement y_max = 2 inches, which I think is related to the base circle radius and the offset. Maybe y_max = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum displacement y is given by y = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the displacement of the follower is determined by the rotation of the cam. The maximum displacement occurs when the cam has rotated such that the point of contact is at a position where the displacement is maximum. For SHM, the displacement as a function of angle is y = A sin(theta), where A is 2 inches. The maximum occurs at theta = 90 degrees, but in this problem, the rise occurs over 140 degrees, so perhaps the maximum displacement is achieved before that.

Wait, maybe the maximum displacement is achieved when the cam has rotated 140 degrees. So, the displacement would be y = A sin(140 degrees * pi/180). Wait, but that would give y = 2 sin(2.443 radians) ≈ 2 * 0.6691 ≈ 1.338 inches, which is less than the given maximum of 2 inches. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude A is such that y = A sin(theta), and the maximum occurs at theta = 140 degrees. So, 2 = A sin(140 degrees). Sin(140) is about 0.6428, so A = 2 / 0.6428 ≈ 3.111 inches. That would make the amplitude larger than the displacement, which seems off.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach or recall standard formulas.

I remember that for a reciprocating roller follower in SHM, the base circle radius (r) and the offset (d) are related by the pressure angle alpha. The formula is tan(alpha) = (r + a) / d, where a is the roller radius.

Given alpha = 35°, a = 1 inch.

So, tan(35°) = (r + 1) / d → d = (r + 1) / tan(35°) ≈ (r + 1) / 0.7002.

Now, the maximum displacement y_max is 2 inches. How is y_max related to r and d?

In SHM, the displacement y is given by y = A sin(theta), where A is the amplitude, which is 2 inches here. The amplitude A is related to the geometry of the cam and the follower. For a reciprocating follower, the amplitude is the total movement from the lowest to highest position, which is twice the maximum displacement from the mean position. Wait, no, the amplitude is the maximum displacement from the mean position, so y_max = A.

Wait, but the problem states the maximum displacement is 2 inches, so A = 2 inches.

The amplitude A is also related to the base circle radius and the offset. The amplitude can be found using the formula A = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is determined by the maximum rise, which occurs when the line of action is perpendicular to the base circle's radius. At that point, the displacement is maximum.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement y_max is equal to the length of the arc of the base circle plus the offset. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: the maximum displacement occurs when the point of contact is at the highest point of the base circle. So, y_max = r + d. But that would mean 2 = r + d. But then using the pressure angle equation d = (r + 1)/tan(35°), we can substitute:

r + d = 2 → d = 2 - r.

Substituting into d = (r + 1)/0.7002:

2 - r = (r + 1)/0.7002
Multiply both sides by 0.7002:
0.7002*(2 - r) = r + 1
1.4004 - 0.7002 r = r + 1
1.4004 - 1 = r + 0.7002 r
0.4004 = 1.7002 r
r ≈ 0.4004 / 1.7002 ≈ 0.2355 inches.

Then, d = 2 - 0.2355 ≈ 1.7645 inches.

Looking at the options, option A has d=1.75 inches and base circle radius 1.65 inches. That's close to my calculation of r≈0.2355, but that's way too small. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the maximum displacement is not r + d, but something else. Perhaps it's the vertical distance between the highest and lowest points of the follower's center.

The follower's center F is at (d, 0). The point P on the cam is at (r cos θ, r sin θ). The line FP is the line of action, which is tangent to the cam at P. The displacement y is the vertical movement of F, but I'm not sure how to calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement y is given by the difference in the y-coordinates of P when the cam is at angle θ and when it's at angle 0°. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement y_max is equal to r (1 - cos θ) + d (1 - cos θ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement y is related to the arc length of the cam's rotation. The rise occurs over 140°, so the arc length is (140/360) * 2πr = (7/18) π r. But I'm not sure how that relates to the displacement.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach or think about the cam's base circle radius and the required pressure angle.

Given that tan(alpha) = (r + a)/d, and we have alpha =35°, a=1 inch, so d = (r + 1)/tan(35°).

We also know that the maximum displacement y_max is 2 inches, which might be related to the base circle radius and the offset. Maybe y_max = r + d, but that didn't work earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps y_max = r (1 + cos(theta)) + d (1 + cos(theta)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement occurs when the line of action is vertical, as I thought earlier. So, in that case, y = r sin(theta), and d = r cos(theta).

But earlier, this led to r ≈3.485 inches and d≈2.85 inches, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement isn't when the line of action is vertical. Maybe it's when the displacement is maximum in the SHM cycle, which occurs at a different angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum displacement is determined by the length of the path the follower travels, which is related to the circumference of the base circle and the offset.

Wait, another thought: the maximum displacement y_max is equal to the base circle diameter plus twice the offset. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the base circle radius is determined by the displacement and the pressure angle. Let me think.

From the pressure angle equation: d = (r + 1)/tan(35°).

The displacement y_max is 2 inches. Maybe y_max = r + d. So,

2 = r + (r + 1)/tan(35°)

Calculating tan(35°) ≈0.7002.

So,

2 = r + (r + 1)/0.7002
Multiply both sides by 0.7002:

1.4004 = 0.7002 r + r + 1.4286
Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute step by step.

Actually,

2 = r + (r +1)/0.7002.

Let me write it as:

2 = r + (r + 1)/0.7002

Multiply both sides by 0.7002:

2 * 0.7002 = 0.7002 r + r + 1

1.4004 = (0.7002 + 1) r + 1

1.4004 = 1.7002 r + 1

Subtract 1:

0.4004 = 1.7002 r

r ≈ 0.4004 / 1.7002 ≈ 0.2355 inches.

Then, d = (0.2355 + 1)/0.7002 ≈ 1.2355 / 0.7002 ≈ 1.764 inches.

But again, this doesn't match any options, and the base circle radius seems too small.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the maximum displacement is achieved when the cam has rotated 140 degrees, so the displacement y = A sin(140°). But A would then be y_max / sin(140°) = 2 / sin(140°) ≈2 / 0.6428 ≈3.111 inches. But I'm not sure how that relates to r and d.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement is given by y = r (1 - cos θ) + d (1 - cos θ), where θ is the angle for which the displacement is maximum. If θ = 140°, then:

y = r (1 - cos 140°) + d (1 - cos 140°)
= (r + d) (1 - cos 140°)

But cos 140° ≈ -0.7660, so 1 - cos 140° ≈ 1.7660.

So, y ≈ (r + d) * 1.766 ≈ 2 inches.

So, (r + d) ≈ 2 / 1.766 ≈1.133 inches.

But from the pressure angle equation, d = (r + 1)/0.7002.

So, substituting into r + d =1.133,

r + (r +1)/0.7002 =1.133

Multiply both sides by 0.7002:

0.7002 r + r + 1 =1.133 *0.7002 ≈0.793.

So,

1.7002 r +1 =0.793

1.7002 r = -0.207 → r negative, which is impossible. So, this approach is wrong.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the maximum displacement is achieved when the cam has rotated 90 degrees, making the displacement y = A =2 inches. So, when θ=90 degrees, y=2.

In that case, using the earlier equation where y = r sin(theta) and d = r cos(theta).

So, at theta=90°, y= r sin(90)=r=2 inches. So, r=2 inches.

Then, d= r cos(theta)= 2 * cos(90)=0, which can't be right because the offset can't be zero if the roller has a radius. So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the displacement is y = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)).

At theta=180°, y= r(1 - (-1)) + d(1 - (-1))= 2r + 2d.

But that would give y=2(r + d)=2 inches → r + d=1 inch. But from the pressure angle equation, d=(r +1)/0.7002.

So,

r + (r +1)/0.7002 =1

Multiply by 0.7002:

0.7002 r + r +1 =0.7002

1.7002 r = -0.2998 → r negative, impossible.

This approach isn't working. I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement occurs when the cam has rotated 140 degrees, and the displacement is 2 inches. So, using SHM, y=2= A sin(140°).

So, A= 2 / sin(140°)≈2 /0.6428≈3.111 inches.

The amplitude A is related to the cam's geometry. Perhaps A = r (1 + cos(alpha)) + d (1 + cos(alpha)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A = r + d. So, 3.111 = r + d.

From the pressure angle equation, d=(r +1)/0.7002.

So,

3.111 = r + (r +1)/0.7002

Multiply by 0.7002:

3.111 *0.7002 ≈2.178= 0.7002 r + r +1

2.178=1.7002 r +1

1.7002 r=1.178 → r≈0.692 inches.

Then, d=3.111 -0.692≈2.419 inches.

But again, this doesn't match any options, and the base circle radius seems too small.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the base circle radius is the same as the roller radius plus the perpendicular distance, adjusted by the pressure angle.

Wait, perhaps the base circle radius r is equal to d tan(alpha) - a, where a is the roller radius.

So,

r = d tan(35°) -1.

And the maximum displacement y_max is 2 inches, which could be related to r and d.

But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum displacement is when the line of action is vertical, so y_max = r + d.

So,

2 = r + d.

But from the pressure angle equation: d = (r +1)/0.7002.

Substituting into 2 = r + (r +1)/0.7002.

Let me compute:

Multiply both sides by 0.7002:

2 *0.7002= 0.7002 r + r +1

1.4004=1.7002 r +1

1.7002 r=0.4004 → r≈0.4004/1.7002≈0.2355 inches.

Then, d=2 -0.2355≈1.7645 inches.

But this gives a very small base circle radius, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement is not r + d, but something else. Maybe it's the vertical component of the displacement, which would involve sine.

Wait, perhaps y_max = r sin(alpha) + d sin(alpha).

So,

2 = (r + d) sin(35°).

sin(35°)≈0.5736.

So,

2≈(r + d)*0.5736 → r + d≈3.485 inches.

From the pressure angle equation, d=(r +1)/0.7002.

So,

r + (r +1)/0.7002≈3.485.

Let me compute:

Multiply both sides by 0.7002:

0.7002 r + r +1≈3.485 *0.7002≈2.441.

So,

1.7002 r +1≈2.441 → 1.7002 r≈1.441 → r≈0.847 inches.

Then, d=(0.847 +1)/0.7002≈1.847/0.7002≈2.638 inches.

Again, this doesn't match any options.

I'm clearly not getting this right. Maybe I should look for another formula or approach.

Wait, I recall that the displacement y of the follower can be expressed as y = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)), where theta is the angle of rotation. The maximum displacement occurs when theta=180°, so y_max = 2(r + d)(1 - (-1))=4(r + d). Wait, that can't be right because that would give y_max=4(r + d), which would be too large.

Alternatively, perhaps y_max = 2(r + d). So, 2(r + d)=2 → r + d=1.

But from d=(r +1)/0.7002,

r + (r +1)/0.7002=1.

Multiply by 0.7002:

0.7002 r + r +1=0.7002.

1.7002 r= -0.2998 → r negative, impossible.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should check the options to see which ones fit the pressure angle equation.

Let's take each option and check if tan(35°) = (r +1)/d.

Option A: d=1.75, r=1.65.

(r +1)=2.65. d=1.75.

tan(35)=2.65/1.75≈1.514.

But tan(35)≈0.7002. So, no.

Option B: d=1.35, r=1.24.

r+1=2.24. d=1.35.

2.24/1.35≈1.659. Not 0.7002.

Option C: d=1.5, r=1.3.

r+1=2.3. d=1.5.

2.3/1.5≈1.533. Not 0.7002.

Option D: d=1.2, r=1.24.

r+1=2.24. d=1.2.

2.24/1.2≈1.866. No.

Option E: d=1.4, r=1.35.

r+1=2.35. d=1.4.

2.35/1.4≈1.678. No.

Option F: d=1.286, r=1.5.

r+1=2.5. d=1.286.

2.5/1.286≈1.942. No.

Option G: d=1.1, r=1.2.

r+1=2.2. d=1.1.

2.2/1.1=2. Not 0.7002.

Option H: d=1.286, r=1.45.

r+1=2.45. d=1.286.

2.45/1.286≈1.905. No.

Option I: d=1.286, r=1.24.

r+1=2.24. d=1.286.

2.24/1.286≈1.738. No.

Option J: d=1.286, r=1.75.

r+1=2.75. d=1.286.

2.75/1.286≈2.135. No.

None of the options satisfy tan(35°) = (r +1)/d. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is tan(alpha) = (r + a)/d, where a is the roller radius. So, in this case, a=1 inch.

So, tan(35°) = (r +1)/d → d=(r +1)/tan(35°)= (r +1)/0.7002.

Now, let's check which options satisfy this.

Option A: d=1.75, r=1.65.

(r+1)=2.65. d=1.75. 2.65/1.75≈1.514. Not 0.7002.

Option F: d=1.286, r=1.5.

r+1=2.5. d=1.286. 2.5/1.286≈1.942. No.

Option I: d=1.286, r=1.24.

r+1=2.24. d=1.286. 2.24/1.286≈1.738. No.

Option H: d=1.286, r=1.45.

r+1=2.45. d=1.286. 2.45/1.286≈1.905. No.

Option E: d=1.4, r=1.35.

r+1=2.35. d=1.4. 2.35/1.4≈1.678. No.

Option C: d=1.5, r=1.3.

r+1=2.3. d=1.5. 2.3/1.5≈1.533. No.

Option B: d=1.35, r=1.24.

r+1=2.24. d=1.35. 2.24/1.35≈1.659. No.

Option D: d=1.2, r=1.24.

r+1=2.24. d=1.2. 2.24/1.2≈1.866. No.

Option G: d=1.1, r=1.2.

r+1=2.2. d=1.1. 2.2/1.1=2. No.

Option J: d=1.286, r=1.75.

r+1=2.75. d=1.286. 2.75/1.286≈2.135. No.

None of the options satisfy tan(35) = (r +1)/d. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is tan(alpha) = d / (r + a). Let me try that.

So, tan(alpha) = d/(r +1).

For alpha=35°, tan(35)≈0.7002.

So, d=0.7002*(r +1).

Now, let's check the options:

Option A: d=1.75. So, 1.75=0.7002*(r +1) → r +1≈1.75/0.7002≈2.5 → r≈1.5.

But option A has r=1.65. Close but not exact.

Option B: d=1.35 → 1.35=0.7002*(r+1) → r+1≈1.35/0.7002≈1.927 → r≈0.927. Not matching B's r=1.24.

Option C: d=1.5 → 1.5=0.7002*(r+1) → r+1≈2.142 → r≈1.142. Option C has r=1.3. Close but not exact.

Option D: d=1.2 → 1.2=0.7002*(r+1) → r+1≈1.713 → r≈0.713. Option D has r=1.24. No.

Option E: d=1.4 → 1.4=0.7002*(r+1) → r+1≈1.4/0.7002≈1.999 → r≈0.999. Option E has r=1.35. No.

Option F: d=1.286 → 1.286=0.7002*(r+1) → r+1≈1.286/0.7002≈1.836 → r≈0.836. Option F has r=1.5. No.

Option G: d=1.1 → 1.1=0.7002*(r+1) → r+1≈1.571 → r≈0.571. Option G has r=1.2. No.

Option H: d=1.286 → same as F, r≈0.836. Option H has r=1.45. No.

Option I: d=1.286 → same as above. Option I has r=1.24. No.

Option J: d=1.286 → r≈0.836. Option J has r=1.75. No.

Only option A is close. It would give r≈1.5, but option A has r=1.65. So, perhaps option A is the intended answer, but it's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps option I is correct. Let me check:

Option I: d=1.286, r=1.24.

Check tan(alpha)=d/(r +1)=1.286/(1.24+1)=1.286/2.24≈0.573. But tan(35°)≈0.7002. So, not matching.

Option F: d=1.286, r=1.5. tan(alpha)=1.286/(2.5)=0.514. Not 0.7002.

Hmm. Maybe I should think differently. Let me try to find d and r that satisfy tan(35) = d/(r +1).

Looking for options where d ≈0.7002*(r+1).

Option C: d=1.5, r=1.3 → 1.5 ≈0.7002*(2.3)=1.61. Close but not exact.

Option E: d=1.4, r=1.35 → 1.4≈0.7002*(2.35)=1.645. No.

Option I: d=1.286, r=1.24 → 1.286≈0.7002*(2.24)=1.568. No.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is not present, but among the options, option I has d=1.286 and r=1.24. Let's see what tan(alpha) would be:

tan(alpha)=d/(r +1)=1.286/(1.24+1)=1.286/2.24≈0.573, which is approximately tan(30°), not 35°. So, not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate for each option and see which one gives alpha≈35°.

Let's compute alpha for each option:

Option A: d=1.75, r=1.65.

tan(alpha)=d/(r+1)=1.75/(2.65)=0.6604 → alpha≈33.4°. Close to 35°.

Option B: d=1.35, r=1.24.

tan(alpha)=1.35/(2.24)=0.6027 → alpha≈31°. Not close.

Option C: d=1.5, r=1.3.

tan(alpha)=1.5/2.3≈0.6522 → alpha≈33°. Close.

Option D: d=1.2, r=1.24.

tan(alpha)=1.2/2.24≈0.5357 → alpha≈28°. No.

Option E: d=1.4, r=1.35.

tan(alpha)=1.4/2.35≈0.5957 → alpha≈30.8°. No.

Option F: d=1.286, r=1.5.

tan(alpha)=1.286/2.5≈0.5144 → alpha≈27°. No.

Option G: d=1.1, r=1.2.

tan(alpha)=1.1/2.2=0.5 → alpha≈26.6°. No.

Option H: d=1.286, r=1.45.

tan(alpha)=1.286/(2.45)=0.525 → alpha≈27.7°. No.

Option I: d=1.286, r=1.24.

tan(alpha)=1.286/2.24≈0.573 → alpha≈30°. No.

Option J: d=1.286, r=1.75.

tan(alpha)=1.286/(2.75)=0.466 → alpha≈25°. No.

So, the closest to 35° is option A with alpha≈33.4°, which is the closest to 35°.

Now, considering the displacement of 2 inches, perhaps the base circle radius and offset in option A would allow for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the maximum displacement is determined by the base circle radius and the offset.

Wait, another formula I found: the displacement y can be given by y = r (1 - cos(theta)) + d (1 - cos(theta)), where theta is the angle of rotation. The maximum displacement occurs when theta=180°, so y_max = 2(r + d)(1 - (-1))=4(r + d). But that can't be because 4(r + d) would be too large.

Alternatively, perhaps y_max = 2(r + d). So,

2(r + d)=2 → r + d=1.

But with option A, r=1.65, d=1.75 → r +d=3.4, which is way above 1. So, this can't be right.

I'm clearly missing something here. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. The closest option that satisfies the pressure angle condition is option A, with d=1.75 and r=1.65, giving alpha≈33.4°, which is close to 35°. The base circle radius is 1.65 inches, which seems reasonable.

So, the perpendicular distance is 1.75 inches, and the base circle radius is 1.65 inches, which corresponds to option A.

The problem involves determining the perpendicular distance between the follower axis and the camshaft axis (d) and the smallest possible size of the cam (base circle radius, r) for a plate cam causing a reciprocating roller follower to execute simple harmonic motion. The maximum displacement is 2 inches, the motion comprises a rise over 140° and a fall over 160°, and the pressure angle should not exceed 35°. The roller radius is 1 inch.

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Pressure Angle Relationship**:  
   The pressure angle (α) is given by:  
   \[
   \tan(\alpha) = \frac{d}{r + a}
   \]  
   where \(a = 1\) inch (roller radius). For α = 35°, \(\tan(35^\circ) \approx 0.7002\). Thus:  
   \[
   d = 0.7002 \times (r + 1)
   \]

2. **Maximizing Displacement**:  
   The maximum displacement of 2 inches must be accommodated by the cam's geometry. The displacement is related to the base circle radius and the offset \(d\), but the exact relationship depends on the cam's profile and the SHM cycle.

3. **Checking Options**:  
   Each option was evaluated to check if it satisfies the pressure angle condition and provides a reasonable base circle radius and offset. The closest match was found in **Option A**, where:  
   - \(d = 1.75\) inches  
   - \(r = 1.65\) inches  

   Substituting into the pressure angle equation:  
   \[
   \tan(\alpha) = \frac{1.75}{1.65 + 1} = \frac{1.75}{2.65} \approx 0.6604
   \]  
   This corresponds to α ≈ 33.4°, which is close to the required 35°.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Among the given options, **Option A** provides the closest match to the pressure angle condition and a reasonable cam size for noiseless and efficient functioning.
