Question:

Which of the following is true of the assessment of power in the arms?

Options:

A: Extension at the elbow is produced by the biceps muscle
B: Grade 3/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated
C: Grade 2/5 power represents movement of the arm only against gravity.
D: The brachioradialis muscle is responsible for shoulder abduction
E: Grade 0/5 power represents full range of motion with resistance
F: The root value of shoulder abduction is C5
G: Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle
H: Grade 5/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated
I: The root value of shoulder abduction is C7
J: Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these options is true regarding the assessment of power in the arms. Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: "Extension at the elbow is produced by the biceps muscle." Wait, I remember that the biceps brachii muscle is responsible for elbow flexion, not extension. Elbow extension is done by the triceps brachii. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: "Grade 3/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated." From what I know, the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale grades muscle strength from 0 to 5. Grade 0 is no movement, 1 is flicker, 2 is movement with gravity eliminated (like when you lift the limb off the bed), 3 is movement against gravity, 4 is movement against some resistance, and 5 is full strength. So Grade 3 should be movement against gravity, not with it. So B is incorrect.

Option C: "Grade 2/5 power represents movement of the arm only against gravity." Wait, no, Grade 2 is movement with gravity eliminated. So when you lift the arm off the surface, it moves but can't handle any weight. So C is also incorrect.

Option D: "The brachioradialis muscle is responsible for shoulder abduction." No, brachioradialis is involved in forearm supination and pronation, and maybe some flexion and extension at the elbow. Shoulder abduction is mainly done by the supraspinatus and deltoid muscles. So D is wrong.

Option E: "Grade 0/5 power represents full range of motion with resistance." That doesn't make sense. Grade 0 is no movement at all, no contraction. So E is incorrect.

Option F: "The root value of shoulder abduction is C5." I think shoulder abduction is primarily a C5 function, as the supraspinatus is innervated by C5. So F might be correct.

Option G: "Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle." No, triceps does extension, biceps does flexion. So G is wrong.

Option H: "Grade 5/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated." No, Grade 5 is full strength, so you can move against strong resistance. H is incorrect.

Option I: "The root value of shoulder abduction is C7." No, I think it's C5, so I is wrong.

Option J: "Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction." No, Grade 1 is a slight contraction, maybe a flicker of movement. So J is incorrect.

So the only correct option seems to be F: The root value of shoulder abduction is C5.
