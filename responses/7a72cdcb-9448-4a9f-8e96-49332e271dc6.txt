Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the work done by a force moving an object from one point to another along a straight line. Hmm, I remember that work done by a force is calculated using the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector. Right, the formula is W = F · d, where W is work, F is the force, and d is the displacement.

First, I need to figure out the displacement vector. The object starts at (0,10,8) and ends at (6,12,20). So, the displacement vector d would be the ending point minus the starting point. Let me calculate each component:

- For the x-component: 6 - 0 = 6 meters.
- For the y-component: 12 - 10 = 2 meters.
- For the z-component: 20 - 8 = 12 meters.

So, the displacement vector d is 6i + 2j + 12k.

Next, the force vector F is given as 8i -6j +9k. Now, I need to compute the dot product of F and d. The dot product is calculated by multiplying corresponding components and then adding them together.

Breaking it down:

- The i-component: 8 * 6 = 48.
- The j-component: (-6) * 2 = -12.
- The k-component: 9 * 12 = 108.

Now, adding these together: 48 + (-12) + 108. Let's compute that. 48 minus 12 is 36, and 36 plus 108 equals 144. 

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again.

Displacement:
- x: 6 - 0 = 6 (correct)
- y: 12 -10 = 2 (correct)
- z:20-8=12 (correct)

Force components:
- Fx=8, Fy=-6, Fz=9 (given correctly)

Dot product:
8*6=48, (-6)*2=-12, 9*12=108. Adding these: 48-12=36, 36+108=144. Yep, that looks right.

So the work done is 144 J. Looking at the options, option A is 144 J. So I think the correct answer should be A.

The work done is calculated using the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector. The displacement vector is found by subtracting the initial point from the final point, resulting in (6, 2, 12). The force vector is given as (8, -6, 9). The dot product is computed as (8×6) + (-6×2) + (9×12) = 48 -12 + 108 = 144 J.
