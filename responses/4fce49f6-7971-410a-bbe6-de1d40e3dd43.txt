Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about pheromones and molecules. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a certain pheromone has the formula C19H38O, and its molar mass is 282 g/mol. To be effective, only 1e-12 grams of it need to be present. The question is asking how many molecules that corresponds to.

Hmm, right. So I think I need to find the number of molecules in that tiny amount of pheromone. I remember that to find the number of molecules, I probably need to use Avogadro's number, which is 6.022e23 molecules per mole. But first, I should find out how many moles are in 1e-12 grams of this compound.

Wait, the molar mass is given as 282 g/mol. So moles are calculated by dividing the mass by the molar mass. So moles = mass / molar mass.

Let me write that down. The mass here is 1e-12 grams. So moles = (1e-12 g) / (282 g/mol). Let me compute that.

1e-12 divided by 282. Let's see, 1e-12 is 0.000000000001 grams. Dividing that by 282 would give a very small number. So 1e-12 / 282 is approximately 3.546e-15 moles. Let me check the calculation: 1/282 is about 0.003546, so 0.003546e-12 is 3.546e-15.

Now that I have the moles, I can find the number of molecules by multiplying by Avogadro's number. So number of molecules = moles * 6.022e23.

Plugging in the numbers: 3.546e-15 moles * 6.022e23 molecules/mol. Let me compute that. 3.546 * 6.022 is about 21.36, and then the exponents are 10^(-15 +23) = 10^8. So 21.36e8, which is 2.136e9 molecules.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 2.12e9, which is close to what I got. Option E is 7.28e8, which is an order of magnitude smaller. Option F is 9.45e11, which is way bigger. So my calculation points towards option I.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up a step.

So mass is 1e-12 grams. Molar mass is 282 g/mol. Moles = 1e-12 /282 ≈ 3.546e-15. Then molecules = 3.546e-15 * 6.022e23 = (3.546 *6.022) *1e8. 3.546 *6 is about 21.276, and 0.022*3.546 is about 0.078, so total around 21.354. So 21.354e8 =2.1354e9. Rounding to three significant figures, that's about 2.14e9. The options have I as 2.12e9, which is pretty close. Maybe I should check if the molar mass was exactly 282.

Wait, the formula is C19H38O. Let me calculate the molar mass again. Carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen is 1.008, oxygen is 16.00.

So for C19: 19 *12.01 = let's see, 19*12 is 228, 19*0.01=0.19, so total 228.19.

Hydrogen: 38 *1.008 = 38 *1 =38, 38 *0.008=0.304, so 38.304.

Oxygen: 16.00.

Adding them up: 228.19 +38.304=266.494, plus 16 is 282.494 g/mol. Oh, wait, the problem says 282 g/mol, so maybe it's rounded. So using 282 is correct.

So back to the moles: 1e-12 /282 = approx 3.546e-15.

Number of molecules: 3.546e-15 *6.022e23. Let me compute that more accurately.

3.546 *6.022 = let's calculate:

3 *6.022=18.066

0.546 *6.022 = approximately 3.287 (since 0.5*6=3, 0.046*6=0.276, so 3.276. Plus 0.546 *0.022 ≈0.012, so around 3.288). So total is 18.066 +3.288=21.354. So 21.354 *1e8 =2.1354e9 molecules. So about 2.135e9.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.12e9, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is option I.

Wait a second, but option E is 7.28e8, which is about ten times less. Did I make a mistake in exponents?

Wait, 3.546e-15 *6.022e23 = (3.546 *6.022) *1e8. Because 1e-15 *1e23=1e8. So 3.546*6.022=21.354, so 21.354e8 is 2.1354e9. So yes, that's correct.

So I think the answer should be option I: 2.12e9. But wait, why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe I should check more precisely.

Let me calculate 1e-12 /282 exactly. Let's compute 1 /282 = approximately 0.00354609. So 0.00354609e-12 =3.54609e-15 moles.

Then, 3.54609e-15 *6.022e23 = (3.54609 *6.022) *1e8.

3.54609 *6.022: let's compute this accurately.

3 *6.022=18.066

0.54609 *6.022:

0.5 *6.022=3.011

0.04 *6.022=0.24088

0.00609 *6.022≈0.03667

Adding: 3.011 +0.24088=3.25188 +0.03667≈3.28855.

So total is 18.066 +3.28855=21.35455.

So 21.35455e8 = 2.135455e9.

So approximately 2.135e9 molecules. The closest option is I: 2.12e9, which is 2.12×10^9. So that must be the correct answer.

To determine the number of molecules required for the pheromone to be effective, we start by calculating the number of moles in 1×10⁻¹² grams of the compound. Using the molar mass of 282 g/mol, the number of moles is:

\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{g}}{282 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 3.546 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{moles}.
\]

Next, we convert moles to molecules using Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules/mol):

\[
\text{Molecules} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Avogadro's Number} = (3.546 \times 10^{-15}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}) \approx 2.135 \times 10^{9} \, \text{molecules}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \(2.135 \times 10^{9}\) is **2.12 × 10⁹ molecules**, which corresponds to option I.
