Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about how free fatty acids are transported in the blood. The options are A through J. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that fatty acids are important for energy, and they need to be transported in the bloodstream. But how exactly? I think they don't just float around freely because they're lipids and might not mix well with blood, which is mostly water.

Option A says inside red blood cells. I don't think so because red blood cells carry oxygen, not really fatty acids. Plus, I remember that large molecules like fatty acids are transported in the plasma, not inside the cells.

Option B is combined with oxygen. That doesn't seem right either. Oxygen is carried by hemoglobin in red blood cells, so combining with oxygen might not be how fatty acids travel.

Option C is as triglycerides. Wait, aren't triglycerides the form in which fats are stored in the body? So when they're released from fat cells, they're broken down into free fatty acids and monoglycerides, which then combine with cholesterol and proteins to form lipoproteins. So maybe C is not correct.

Option D is as free molecules. I'm a bit confused here. I thought that free fatty acids can't dissolve in blood on their own because blood is aqueous. So they must bind to something to be transported. If D is just free, that might not be correct.

Option E is bound to white blood cells. I don't think white blood cells are involved in transporting fatty acids. They're more about the immune system.

Option F is as lipoproteins. Hmm, I remember that lipoproteins are particles that transport lipids in the blood. There are different types like VLDL, LDL, HDL. So maybe after the fatty acids are released, they're packaged into these lipoproteins for transport.

Option G is attached to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen, not fatty acids. So G is probably wrong.

Option H is combined with glucose. Glucose is a carbohydrate, and I don't think it's directly involved in transporting fatty acids. Maybe they can be used together for energy, but not for transport.

Option I is in the form of cholesterol. Cholesterol is another lipid, but I think free fatty acids and cholesterol are both part of lipoproteins, not just as cholesterol alone.

Option J is bound to albumin. I've heard that albumin is a protein in the blood that can bind to things. I think albumin does transport some substances, but wait, isn't albumin more for transporting small molecules like hormones or drugs? I'm not sure if it's the primary transporter for fatty acids.

Wait, I'm a bit confused between F and J. Let me think. When the fatty acids are absorbed from the diet, they're packaged into chylomicrons, which are a type of lipoprotein. These chylomicrons break down in the bloodstream, releasing fatty acids which then bind to albumin for transport. But wait, isn't the majority of transport of fatty acids in the blood via the albumin, not as part of the larger lipoproteins?

Or do free fatty acids get incorporated into the lipoproteins as well? I think that when they're being transported from the liver to other tissues, they might be part of lipoproteins. But the question is about most of the free fatty acids being transported in the blood. So maybe they're bound to albumin, which is option J.

Wait, another angle: after being released from triglycerides, the free fatty acids are taken up by the liver or other tissues. But how do they get there? They must be transported in the blood, so they bind to albumin, which carries them to the tissues. So J is correct.

But I also remember that lipoproteins like VLDL carry triglycerides, not free fatty acids. So when the triglycerides are broken down, the free fatty acids are released and then transported by albumin.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is J: bound to albumin.

The correct answer is J: bound to albumin. Free fatty acids are transported in the blood primarily by binding to albumin, a protein that helps them dissolve in the aqueous environment of the bloodstream. While lipoproteins like VLDL transport triglycerides and other lipids, free fatty acids are mainly carried by albumin for distribution to tissues. 

Answer: J
