Okay, so I need to find the relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x. Hmm, I remember that to find maxima or minima of a function, I should use calculus, specifically finding the derivative and then setting it equal to zero to find critical points.

First, the function is y = (ln x)/x. I think I'll need to find the derivative dy/dx. Since this is a quotient of two functions, I can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule says that if I have a function f(x) = g(x)/h(x), then the derivative f’(x) is [g’(x)h(x) - g(x)h’(x)] / [h(x)]².

So, in this case, g(x) is ln x, so g’(x) would be 1/x. And h(x) is x, so h’(x) is 1. Plugging these into the quotient rule formula:

dy/dx = [ (1/x)*x - ln x * 1 ] / x².

Simplifying the numerator: (1/x)*x is 1, and ln x *1 is ln x. So, numerator becomes 1 - ln x. So, dy/dx = (1 - ln x) / x².

Now, to find critical points, set dy/dx equal to zero. So, (1 - ln x)/x² = 0.

Since x² is always positive for x ≠ 0, the numerator must be zero for the fraction to be zero. So, 1 - ln x = 0. Solving for x: ln x = 1 → x = e^1 → x = e.

So the critical point is at x = e. Now, I need to check if this is a maximum or a minimum. I can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of the first derivative.

Let me try the second derivative. First, I need to find the second derivative d²y/dx². Hmm, but that might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, I can check the sign of the first derivative around x = e.

Let me pick a value slightly less than e, say x = 2. Plugging into dy/dx: (1 - ln 2)/ (2)². Ln 2 is about 0.693, so numerator is 1 - 0.693 ≈ 0.307, which is positive. So dy/dx is positive just below e.

Now, pick a value slightly more than e, say x = 3. Then dy/dx = (1 - ln 3)/9. Ln 3 is about 1.098, so numerator is 1 - 1.098 ≈ -0.098, which is negative. So dy/dx is negative just above e.

Since the derivative changes from positive to negative as x increases through e, this means the function y has a relative maximum at x = e.

Now, to find the maximum value, plug x = e back into the original function. So y = (ln e)/e. Ln e is 1, so y = 1/e.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. So y = (ln x)/x at x=e is (1)/e, which is approximately 0.3679. But looking at the options, H is 1/e, which would be the correct answer. Or wait, wait—did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, let me re-calculate the second derivative to be sure. Maybe I can see if the second derivative is negative, which would confirm it's a maximum.

The first derivative is (1 - ln x)/x². Let's find the derivative of that.

Let me denote f(x) = (1 - ln x) and g(x) = x². So dy/dx = f(x)/g(x). The second derivative is [f’(x)g(x) - f(x)g’(x)] / [g(x)]².

f’(x) is derivative of (1 - ln x) which is -1/x.

g(x) is x², so g’(x) is 2x.

So numerator is (-1/x)(x²) - (1 - ln x)(2x).

Simplify: (-1/x)(x²) is -x.

Then, (1 - ln x)(2x) is 2x(1 - ln x).

So the numerator is -x - 2x(1 - ln x).

Let me expand that: -x - 2x + 2x ln x = (-3x) + 2x ln x.

Factor x: x(-3 + 2 ln x).

Denominator is (x²)^2 = x^4.

So the second derivative is [x(-3 + 2 ln x)] / x^4 = (-3 + 2 ln x)/x^3.

Now, evaluate this at x = e.

ln e = 1, so (-3 + 2*1) = (-3 + 2) = -1.

So the second derivative at x=e is (-1)/(e^3), which is negative. Since the second derivative is negative, the function is concave down at x=e, so it's a relative maximum.

Therefore, the maximum value is y = 1/e at x=e.

Looking at the options, H is 1/e, so that's the answer.

The function \( y = \frac{\ln x}{x} \) is analyzed for its relative maximum by finding the critical points using the first derivative. Applying the quotient rule, the first derivative is \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1 - \ln x}{x^2} \). Setting this equal to zero gives \( 1 - \ln x = 0 \), leading to \( x = e \). The second derivative test confirms this is a maximum since the second derivative at \( x = e \) is negative. Substituting \( x = e \) into the original function yields \( y = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the relative maximum value is \( \frac{1}{e} \).
