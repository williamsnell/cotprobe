Okay, so I've got this economics question here about aggregate supply and aggregate demand. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The question is asking what happens when both short-run aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase. The options are A through J, each describing different outcomes for the price level and real GDP. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in the Keynesian model, the aggregate demand curve (AD) represents the total demand for goods and services at different price levels. When AD increases, it shifts to the right, which typically leads to an increase in both the price level and real GDP, assuming the economy isn't at full capacity. But wait, that's when only AD increases. What about when AS increases?

Aggregate supply (AS) represents the total output that firms are willing to produce at different price levels. In the short run, an increase in AS would mean that firms can produce more at the same price level, so the AS curve shifts to the right as well. This usually causes the price level to fall and real GDP to rise, because more output is possible at lower prices.

So, if both AS and AD increase, what happens? Let me visualize this. Normally, if only AD increases, we move along the AS curve, leading to higher price level and higher GDP. If only AS increases, we move along the AD curve, leading to lower price level and higher GDP. But when both shift outward, the outcome can vary depending on the relative shifts.

Wait, but I think the key here is that both are shifting. So, the new equilibrium will be where the new AS and AD curves intersect. Let me think about the effects. An increase in AD tends to push the price level up and increase GDP. An increase in AS tends to lower the price level and increase GDP. So, when both happen, it's a bit of a tug-of-war between these two forces.

I remember that when both curves shift outward, the price level could go up, down, or stay the same, depending on how much each shifts. Similarly, GDP could increase, decrease, or stay the same. But the question is asking what can be said for certain, not what might happen.

Hmm, so what is certain? Well, if both AS and AD increase, real GDP will definitely increase because both shifts lead to more output. Wait, no—because if AS increases, it allows more output at each price level, but AD also increases, which would normally lead to more output. So, the equilibrium output (real GDP) must go up, right? Because both shifts are in the direction of higher output.

But wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. If AS increases, the economy can produce more, so potential output goes up. If AD also increases, it's pulling more demand, so the economy would produce more. So, yes, real GDP should rise.

What about the price level? If both AS and AD increase, the price level could go up, down, or stay the same. For example, if AS increases a lot relative to AD, prices might fall. If AD increases a lot relative to AS, prices might rise. If they increase equally, prices might stay the same. So, the price level's change is uncertain.

So, putting that together, real GDP definitely increases because both shifts lead to higher output. The price level's change is uncertain—it could go up, down, or stay the same. Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Looking at the options:

I: Real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.

Yes, that's option I. So the answer should be I.

When both short-run aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase, the outcome depends on the relative shifts of the curves. An increase in AD typically leads to a higher price level and higher real GDP, while an increase in AS typically leads to a lower price level and higher real GDP. When both increase, real GDP is certain to rise because both shifts contribute to greater output. However, the price level's change is uncertain because it depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts in AS and AD.

The correct answer is:

I: Real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.

Answer: I
