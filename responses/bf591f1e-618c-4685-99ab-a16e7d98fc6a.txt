Okay, so I have this question: "Objects that absorb light appear" and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that when objects absorb light, they don't reflect any light back to us. So, if an object absorbs all the light that hits it, we can't see it because there's no light coming back. Wait, but the options don't have "invisible" as the first thought. Let me check the options again. Option F is "invisible." Hmm, that seems possible because if an object absorbs all light, it wouldn't reflect any, making it invisible. But wait, another thought: most objects do reflect some light, which allows us to see them. So if an object absorbs all the light, it would indeed be invisible. But is that the case in real life? Well, nothing can absorb 100% of light, but in theory, if it did, it would be invisible. So maybe F is the answer.

Wait, another angle: sometimes when objects absorb certain wavelengths and reflect others, we perceive colors. For example, a red object absorbs all colors except red. But the question is about objects that absorb light, not specifically about color absorption. So the key here is that if an object absorbs all light, it doesn't reflect any, making it appear as if it's not there. So the answer would be "invisible." But looking back at the options, J is "black." Wait, why is that? Because black objects absorb all light and reflect none. So they appear black because they don't reflect any light. But the question is about objects that absorb light, not about their color. So if an object absorbs all light, it's black because it reflects nothing. So the answer could be J, black. But wait, the question is about what they appear, not the color they are. So if an object absorbs all light, it doesn't reflect any, so it would appear black. So the answer is J.

Wait, but the question says "appear." So when an object absorbs light, it doesn't reflect any, so it looks black. So the correct answer is J: black.

The correct answer is J: black. Objects that absorb all light appear black because they reflect no light.

Answer: J
