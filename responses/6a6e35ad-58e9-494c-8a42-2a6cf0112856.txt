Okay, so I've got this question about banking and the reserve ratio. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves. Let me try to break this down.

The question says the bank has $1000 in checking deposits and is required to reserve $250. So, the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that must be kept as reserves. To find that, I think I need to divide the required reserves by the total deposits.

So, $250 divided by $1000. Let me calculate that. 250 divided by 1000 is 0.25, which is 25%. So the reserve ratio is 25%. That part seems clear.

Next, the question asks how much the bank has in excess reserves. Excess reserves are the amount the bank has beyond the required reserves. The total deposits are $1000, and the required reserves are $250. So, the bank's total reserves would be at least $250, but I'm not told how much they actually have. Wait, no, wait. The question doesn't mention the actual reserves, only the required ones. Or does it? Let me check again.

Wait, the bank has $1000 in deposits, and they're required to reserve $250. But the question is about excess reserves. Oh, wait, I think the bank's actual reserves are the required reserves plus any excess. But in this case, the problem only gives the required reserves, not the actual. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, no, the question is asking for the excess reserves, which would be the total reserves minus the required. But since the question doesn't state how much the bank actually has in reserves beyond the required, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. It says, "What is the reserve ratio? How much does the bank have in excess reserves?" Oh, wait, maybe the bank's total reserves are given elsewhere. Wait, no, the question only states $1000 in deposits and $250 required reserves. So perhaps the bank's total reserves are exactly $250, which would mean excess reserves are zero. But that can't be right because the options don't have zero.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem might be that the bank's actual reserves are the required plus any excess. But the question doesn't state the actual reserves. Wait, maybe I'm missing a part of the question. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says the bank has $1000 in checking deposits and is required to reserve $250. So the required reserve is $250. But the bank's actual reserves could be more than that. However, the question doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the bank holds exactly the required reserves. But that would mean excess reserves are zero, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The reserve ratio is 25%, as I calculated. Now, the excess reserves would be total reserves minus required reserves. If the bank only has $250, then excess is zero. But that's not an option. So maybe the question is implying that the bank's total reserves are the required plus some excess. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide the actual reserves. So perhaps the question is missing some information, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the bank's total reserves are $1000, but that doesn't make sense because the required is $250. Wait, no, the deposits are $1000, and the required reserves are $250. So the actual reserves could be more than $250. But without knowing the actual reserves, I can't compute the excess. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the question is implying that the bank's total reserves are $1000, but that's the deposits, not the reserves.

Wait, no, the bank's deposits are $1000, which are liabilities. The reserves are assets. So the bank's reserves are separate from deposits. So the bank must keep $250 in reserves. The rest can be lent out, but the question is about excess reserves. So perhaps the bank's actual reserves are the same as the required, so excess is zero. But again, the options don't have zero. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me look at the options. Option B says 25% $750 M=1/4. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the reserve ratio is 25%, and the excess is $750? That would mean total reserves are $250 + $750 = $1000, but that's the same as deposits, which doesn't make sense because banks usually don't hold all deposits as reserves.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the excess reserves as the amount that can be lent out, which is deposits minus required reserves. So deposits are $1000, required reserves $250, so the available funds for lending would be $750. But that's not exactly excess reserves; that's the amount that can be used for loans. So perhaps the question is referring to this as excess reserves, which would be $750.

So, if that's the case, the reserve ratio is 25%, excess reserves are $750, and the money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio, which is 4.

Looking at the options, option B is 25% $750 M=1/4, but wait, the money multiplier is 4, not 1/4. So option B's money multiplier is wrong. Option G is 25% $750 M=4, which matches. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. The money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio. Reserve ratio is 25%, so 1/0.25 = 4. So the money multiplier is 4. So the option with 25%, $750 excess, and M=4 is G.
</think>

The reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the required reserves ($250) by the total deposits ($1000), resulting in a 25% reserve ratio. The excess reserves are the amount the bank can lend out, which is the total deposits minus the required reserves, giving $750. The money multiplier is the inverse of the reserve ratio, which is 4. The correct option is G: 25% $750 M = 4.
