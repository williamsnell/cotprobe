Okay, so I've got this problem here about distributing balls into boxes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how many ways there are to distribute 13 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes, with no box left empty. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when dealing with identical objects and distinct boxes, this is a combinatorics problem, specifically a stars and bars problem. But wait, since no box can be empty, I think we have to adjust the formula for that condition.

The basic stars and bars formula without any restrictions is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the number of identical items and k is the number of distinct boxes. In this case, n is 13 and k is 4. So normally, it would be C(13 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(16,3). Let me calculate that: 16 choose 3 is (16×15×14)/(3×2×1) = 560. But wait, that's without any restrictions, and we have a restriction here—no box can be empty.

Oh right, when we require that each box has at least one ball, we use a modified version of the formula. The formula changes to C(n-1, k-1). So here, n is 13, so n-1 is 12, and k is 4, so k-1 is 3. Therefore, it's C(12,3). Let me compute that: 12 choose 3 is (12×11×10)/(3×2×1) = 220. Hmm, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option B is 220, so that must be the answer.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake. So the formula for distributing n identical objects into k distinct boxes with no box empty is indeed C(n-1, k-1). Let me think again: when each box must have at least one ball, we first place one ball in each box. That uses up 4 balls, leaving us with 13-4=9 balls to distribute without any restrictions. So now, it's like distributing 9 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes, which is C(9 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(12,3), which is 220. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be option B: 220.

The number of ways to distribute 13 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes with no box empty is calculated using the stars and bars method. First, place 1 ball in each box, leaving 9 balls. The formula then becomes C(9 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(12,3) = 220.

Answer: B
