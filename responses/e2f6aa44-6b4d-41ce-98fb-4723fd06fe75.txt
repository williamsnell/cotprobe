Question:

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that producing one unit of good Y requires 3 workers and 7 units of capital. The wage per worker is $4, and the rent for each unit of capital is $1. The question asks what the marginal physical product of capital (MPPK) should be for production to be at the least cost, and also what that total cost would be if the marginal physical product of labor (MPPL) is $2. The options provided are A through J, each giving a possible MPPK and total cost.

Hmm, I remember that in production economics, the least cost condition occurs when the ratio of the marginal physical products equals the ratio of the input prices. Specifically, the condition is MPPK/MPL = (Wage)/(Rent). Since the wage is $4 and rent is $1, the ratio is 4/1, so 4:1. So MPPK should be 4 times MPPL.

Wait, the MPPL is given as $2. So MPPK should be 4 * MPPL? Let me check that. Oh wait, no. Wait, the ratio is MPPK/MPL = Price of Labor / Price of Capital. Since the price of labor is wage, which is $4, and price of capital is $1, so MPPK/MPL = 4/1. So MPPK = 4 * MPPL. But wait, MPPL is given as $2. So MPPK would be 4 * 2 = 8? Wait, that can't be right because the options don't go up that high. Wait, maybe I got the ratio wrong.

Wait, the correct formula is MPPK/MPL = (Wage)/(Rent). So MPPK = (Wage/Rent) * MPPL. So with Wage $4 and Rent $1, it's 4/1 =4. So MPPK =4 * MPPL. So MPPL is 2, so MPPK=4*2=8. But looking at the options, none of them have MPPK=8. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backward. Let me think again. The condition for cost minimization is that the ratio of MPPK to MPPL equals the ratio of input prices (wage to rent). So MPPK / MPPL = (Wage) / (Rent). So plugging in the numbers: MPPK / 2 = 4/1 → MPPK = 8. But the options don't have MPPK=8. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I need to check the MPPL.

Wait, wait, the MPPL is given as $2, which is the marginal physical product of labor. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, maybe the MPPL is 2 units per worker. Wait, the MPPL is 2, so each worker contributes 2 units to output. So for each unit of good Y, 3 workers are employed. So total labor input is 3 workers per unit, each contributing 2, so total labor MPP is 3*2=6. Wait, no, that's not how it works because MPPL is per worker. So each worker contributes 2 units, so 3 workers would contribute 3*2=6 units. But that's the total, not the marginal.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The key is that for cost minimization, the ratio of MPPK to MPPL should equal the ratio of input prices. So MPPK / MPPL = (Wage) / (Rent). So MPPK = (Wage/Rent) * MPPL.

Given Wage = $4, Rent = $1, so MPPK = (4/1)*2 = 8. But none of the options have MPPK=8. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait another thought: Maybe the MPPL given is the marginal physical product per unit, not per worker. So if each unit of Y requires 3 workers, maybe the total MPPL is 3 * 2 =6. So MPPK would be (4/1)*6=24. But that's even higher, and options don't have that either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the MPPL. Let me read the question again. The MPPL is given as $2. Wait, maybe MPPL is the amount produced by each worker. So each worker adds 2 units of output. So for each unit of Y, 3 workers are used, each producing 2, so total output per Y is 3*2=6. But that's not directly the MPPL; MPPL is per worker.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the cost minimization condition. The firm should use inputs such that the marginal product per dollar is equal for both labor and capital.

So, the marginal product per dollar for labor is MPPL / wage, and for capital, it's MPPK / rent. For cost minimization, these should be equal.

So, MPPL / wage = MPPK / rent.

Given MPPL = 2, wage =4, rent=1.

So 2 /4 = MPPK /1 → 0.5 = MPPK. So MPPK should be 0.5.

Wait, that makes sense. So MPPK =0.5.

Now, looking at the options, option B has MPPK=0.5, and total cost=19. Option F has MPPK=1, which would be wrong. So option B's MPPK is correct.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each unit of Y uses 3 workers and 7 units of capital.

Wage per worker is $4, so 3 workers cost 3*4=12. Capital per unit is 7 units, each at $1, so 7*1=7. Total cost per unit is 12+7=19.

So yes, that matches option B: MPPK=0.5, total cost=19.

Wait, that seems correct. So the correct answer should be option B.
</think>

The correct answer is determined by ensuring the marginal product per dollar is equal for both labor and capital. With MPPL = 2, wage = $4, and rent = $1, the cost-minimizing condition is MPPL/wage = MPPK/rent. Solving 2/4 = MPPK/1 gives MPPK = 0.5. The total cost is calculated as 3 workers * $4 + 7 capital units * $1 = $12 + $7 = $19.
