Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum interest rate a homebuyer can afford for a $95,000 mortgage over 20 years without the monthly payment exceeding $900. Hmm, I remember that this involves using the mortgage payment formula. Let me think step by step.

First, the formula for the monthly mortgage payment is M = P * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n - 1], where M is the monthly payment, P is the principal loan amount, i is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

So, P is $95,000, M is $900, and n is 20 years, which is 240 months. I need to find the maximum i such that M is $900. 

Let me rearrange the formula to solve for i. It's a bit tricky because the equation is not linear in i. Maybe I can try plugging in the options to see which one gets me closest to $900 without exceeding it.

Let's start with option A: 10%. The monthly rate would be 10%/12 ≈ 0.008333. Plugging into the formula:

M = 95000 * [0.008333*(1+0.008333)^240]/[(1+0.008333)^240 -1]. Hmm, calculating this might take time. Alternatively, I can approximate or use an online calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can estimate.

Wait, maybe I should think about using the present value of an annuity formula, which is similar. PV = PMT * [1 - (1+i)^-n]/i. So, 95000 = 900 * [1 - (1+i)^-240]/i.

This equation needs to be solved for i. Since it's difficult algebraically, trial and error with the options seems better.

Let me try option E: 8.27%. The monthly rate is 8.27%/12 ≈ 0.0068917. Now, compute the denominator: (1+0.0068917)^240 -1. Let me approximate (1.0068917)^240. Using logarithms or knowing that (1+i)^n = e^(n*ln(1+i)), but this might get too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the rule of 72 to estimate how much it grows. 72/0.689 ≈ 104 years, so 240 months is about 20 years, so the factor is roughly 2. So, (1.0068917)^240 ≈ around 3.3 or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the PMT function. Since I'm trying to find i, maybe I can set up an equation where PMT = 900, PV=95000, N=240, and solve for i.

Wait, perhaps I can use an approximate method. Let's try each option.

Option E is 8.27%, so let's compute the payment.

Compute (1 + 0.0827/12) = 1.0068917 per month. Then, (1.0068917)^240. Let me compute this. Taking natural logs, ln(1.0068917) ≈ 0.00686. Multiply by 240: 0.00686 *240≈1.6464. So e^1.6464 ≈ 5.196. So (1.0068917)^240 ≈5.196.

So numerator: 0.0068917 *5.196 ≈0.03587.

Denominator: 5.196 -1=4.196.

So the fraction is 0.03587 /4.196 ≈0.00854.

Then, M =95000 *0.00854 ≈809. So that's below $900. So at 8.27%, payment is about $809, which is under $900. So the buyer could afford a higher rate. So maybe the maximum rate is higher than 8.27%.

Looking at the options, the next higher rate is H:8.95%, then D:11.99%, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check my calculation for option E again. Because if 8.27% gives a payment of around $809, which is under $900, then the buyer can afford a higher rate. So which option is the highest rate that would make the payment exactly $900?

Let me try option D: 11.99%. Monthly rate is 11.99/12≈0.0099917.

Compute (1.0099917)^240. Ln(1.0099917)=approx 0.00994. Multiply by 240: 2.3856. e^2.3856≈10.88.

So numerator: 0.0099917 *10.88≈0.1087.

Denominator:10.88-1=9.88.

So fraction: 0.1087/9.88≈0.011.

M=95000 *0.011≈1045. That's way over $900. So 11.99% is too high.

Next, option B:12.80%. Wait, but D is 11.99, which is lower than B. So maybe I should try lower rates.

Wait, maybe I should try option G:9.73%. Let's compute that.

i=9.73/12≈0.008108 per month.

(1.008108)^240. Ln(1.008108)=approx 0.00807. Multiply by 240: 1.9368. e^1.9368≈6.93.

Numerator:0.008108 *6.93≈0.0561.

Denominator:6.93-1=5.93.

Fraction:0.0561/5.93≈0.00946.

M=95000 *0.00946≈898. So that's very close to $900. So at 9.73%, the payment is about $898, which is just under $900. So maybe the maximum rate is just a bit higher than 9.73% to reach exactly $900.

Looking at the options, the next higher rate after G is H:8.95%, but that's lower. Wait, no, H is 8.95%, which is lower than G's 9.73%. So perhaps I need to check if any of the options provide exactly $900.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for G. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Compute (1.008108)^240:

Let me compute this more accurately. Using the formula, (1 + i)^n = e^(n*ln(1+i)).

i=0.008108, so ln(1.008108) ≈0.008085.

n=240, so 240 *0.008085≈1.9395.

e^1.9395≈6.955.

So numerator:0.008108 *6.955≈0.0562.

Denominator:6.955-1=5.955.

Fraction:0.0562/5.955≈0.00944.

So M=95000 *0.00944≈896.8, which is about $897. So at 9.73%, payment is approximately $897. To reach $900, the rate needs to be a bit higher.

Let me try option H:8.95%. Wait, that's lower than G, so payment would be even lower. So perhaps I need to check option D again, but I think I did that earlier and it was over $1000.

Wait, maybe I should try option J:10.85%. Let's compute that.

i=10.85/12≈0.009042.

(1.009042)^240. Ln(1.009042)=approx 0.00901.

n=240, so 240*0.00901≈2.1624.

e^2.1624≈8.71.

Numerator:0.009042 *8.71≈0.0787.

Denominator:8.71-1=7.71.

Fraction:0.0787/7.71≈0.0102.

M=95000 *0.0102≈969. That's over $900. So 10.85% gives a payment of about $969, which is too high.

So between G (9.73%) and J (10.85%), the payment goes from ~897 to ~969. We need a rate that gives exactly $900.

Let me try option E:8.27%, which I think gave $809. That's too low.

Option H:8.95%. Let's compute that.

i=8.95/12≈0.007458.

(1.007458)^240. Ln(1.007458)=approx 0.00743.

n=240: 240*0.00743≈1.783.

e^1.783≈6.0.

Numerator:0.007458 *6.0≈0.04475.

Denominator:6.0-1=5.0.

Fraction:0.04475/5≈0.00895.

M=95000 *0.00895≈855.25. That's still under $900.

So let's try a higher rate than G, but the options don't have higher than G except D and J, which are too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating G's payment. Let me try a more precise calculation for G:9.73%.

Compute (1 + 0.008108)^240.

Instead of approximating with e, maybe I can compute it step by step or use a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + i)^-n]/i.

We have PV=95000, PMT=900, n=240, so:

95000 =900 * [1 - (1 + i)^-240]/i.

We need to find i such that this equation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an iterative approach.

Let me try i=0.009 (9% annual rate, which is 0.75% monthly). Compute:

(1.009)^240. Let me compute this more accurately.

Using logarithms: ln(1.009)=0.008953. Multiply by 240: 2.1487. e^2.1487≈8.58.

So [1 - (1.009)^-240]/0.009 = [1 - 1/8.58]/0.009 ≈ (1 - 0.1165)/0.009 ≈0.8835/0.009≈98.17.

So PMT=95000 /98.17≈968. That's higher than $900. So at 9% monthly, payment is $968. So the rate needed to bring payment down to $900 is lower than 9% annual (which is 0.75% monthly). Wait, no, because higher interest rates increase the payment. Wait, no, higher i would increase the denominator, leading to lower PMT. Wait, no, higher i makes the denominator larger, so [1 - (1+i)^-n]/i becomes smaller, so PMT would be lower. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, when i increases, the denominator increases, so the fraction [1 - (1+i)^-n]/i decreases, which means PMT decreases. So to get a higher PMT, we need a lower i.

Wait, but in our case, we have PMT fixed at $900, and we need to find the maximum i that doesn't make PMT exceed $900. So higher i would lower the PMT, meaning that the maximum i is the one where PMT is exactly $900.

Wait, but earlier when I tried G:9.73% annual, which is ~0.8108% monthly, the PMT was about $897, which is just under $900. So perhaps the correct rate is just above 9.73%, but the closest option is G:9.73%. But the options don't have a higher rate than G except D and J, which are way over.

Wait, but according to the options, the answer is among A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:10.00%

B:12.80%

C:7.50%

D:11.99%

E:8.27%

F:5.45%

G:9.73%

H:8.95%

I:6.35%

J:10.85%

So, from my earlier calculations:

- At 9.73% (G), PMT≈$897.

- At 10.85% (J), PMT≈$969.

We need a rate where PMT is exactly $900. Since at G the PMT is $897, which is just under, and at J it's $969, which is over, the correct rate must be between G and J.

But the options don't have any rate between G and J except J itself. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for G. Maybe G's rate gives a payment closer to $900.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a financial calculator approach. Let me try to compute the exact rate.

We have:

PMT = $900

PV = $95,000

n=240

We need to find i such that:

900 = 95000 * [i(1+i)^240]/[(1+i)^240 -1]

Let me rearrange:

900 = 95000 * [i / (1 - (1/(1+i)^240))]

Divide both sides by 95000:

900 /95000 = [i / (1 - (1/(1+i)^240))]

0.00947368 ≈ [i / (1 - (1/(1+i)^240))]

So we have:

i ≈ 0.00947368 * [1 - (1/(1+i)^240)]

This is an equation in i that's tricky to solve algebraically. So perhaps I can make an educated guess.

Let me try i=0.0095 (9.5% annual, which is ~0.7917% monthly).

Compute (1.007917)^240.

Using ln(1.007917)=approx 0.00788.

240 *0.00788≈1.891.

e^1.891≈6.62.

So 1/(1.007917)^240≈1/6.62≈0.151.

So 1 - 0.151=0.849.

So i≈0.00947368 *0.849≈0.00805.

Wait, but i was 0.0095, and the result is 0.00805, which is lower. That suggests that at i=0.0095, the RHS is 0.00805, which is less than i, so we need a higher i.

Wait, perhaps I should set up an iterative approach.

Let me try i=0.009 (9% annual, which is 0.75% monthly).

Compute (1.0075)^240.

ln(1.0075)=0.00745.

240 *0.00745=1.788.

e^1.788≈6.0.

So 1/(1.0075)^240≈1/6≈0.1667.

1 -0.1667=0.8333.

i≈0.00947368 *0.8333≈0.0079.

But i was 0.009, which is higher than 0.0079, so we need to increase i.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Let's use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the interest rate.

Let me define f(i) = 95000 * [i(1+i)^240]/[(1+i)^240 -1] -900.

We need to find i such that f(i)=0.

We can start with an initial guess and iterate.

Let me start with i=0.009 (9% annual).

Compute f(0.009):

(1.009)^240: as before, approx 6.0.

So numerator:0.009 *6.0=0.054.

Denominator:6.0 -1=5.0.

So 95000 * (0.054/5.0)=95000 *0.0108=1026. So f(0.009)=1026-900=126>0.

We need to find i where f(i)=0, so we need to lower i.

Wait, no, because higher i would decrease the payment. Wait, no: higher i would increase the denominator, thus decreasing the payment. So to get f(i)=0, where payment is $900, we need to find the i where the payment is exactly $900. Since at i=0.009, payment is $1026, which is too high, we need a higher i to lower the payment.

Wait, that can't be right because higher i should increase the monthly payment, not decrease. Wait, no, because higher i makes the denominator larger, so the fraction [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1] becomes smaller, so payment decreases. So to get payment down to $900, we need a higher i.

So f(i)=95000 * [i(1+i)^240]/[(1+i)^240 -1] -900.

At i=0.009, f(i)=1026-900=126>0, so payment is higher than $900. We need i higher than 0.009 to reduce payment to $900.

Let me try i=0.0095 (9.5% annual).

Compute (1.0095)^240.

ln(1.0095)=0.00945.

240 *0.00945=2.268.

e^2.268≈9.66.

Numerator:0.0095 *9.66≈0.0918.

Denominator:9.66-1=8.66.

So 95000*(0.0918/8.66)=95000*(0.0106)=1008. So f(i)=1008-900=108>0. Still too high.

Next, i=0.01 (10% annual).

(1.01)^240: ln(1.01)=0.00995.

240 *0.00995≈2.388.

e^2.388≈10.88.

Numerator:0.01*10.88≈0.1088.

Denominator:10.88-1=9.88.

So 95000*(0.1088/9.88)=95000*(0.011)=1045. So f(i)=1045-900=145>0.

Hmm, payment is still higher than $900. So need higher i.

Wait, maybe I'm doing this wrong. Because when i increases, the denominator increases more, so the fraction decreases, leading to lower payment. So to get payment down to $900, i needs to be higher than 0.01.

Wait, but when i=0.01, payment is $1045, which is way over. So perhaps I need to go higher.

Wait, perhaps I should try i=0.012 (12% annual).

(1.012)^240: ln(1.012)=0.01189.

240 *0.01189≈2.8536.

e^2.8536≈17.38.

Numerator:0.012 *17.38≈0.2086.

Denominator:17.38-1=16.38.

So 95000*(0.2086/16.38)=95000*(0.01273)=1210. So f(i)=1210-900=310>0. Still way over.

Wait, this can't be right because earlier when I tried i=0.0095, payment was $1008, which is still over $900. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should try i=0.008 (8% annual).

(1.008)^240: ln(1.008)=0.00798.

240 *0.00798≈1.915.

e^1.915≈6.78.

Numerator:0.008 *6.78≈0.0542.

Denominator:6.78-1=5.78.

So 95000*(0.0542/5.78)=95000*(0.00938)=886. So f(i)=886-900=-14<0.

So at i=0.008, payment is $886, which is under $900. So the correct i is between 0.008 and 0.009.

Wait, but earlier when I tried i=0.009, payment was $1026, which is way over. That suggests a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing annual and monthly rates. Wait, no, I'm using i as the monthly rate, which is annual rate divided by 12.

Wait, let me clarify: when I set i=0.009, that's 9% per month, which is 108% annually, which is impossible. Oh no, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. If the annual rate is r, then the monthly rate is r/12. So if I'm testing an annual rate of 9%, the monthly rate is 0.09/12=0.0075.

Wait, I think I messed up earlier by using i as the annual rate instead of the monthly rate. That's where I went wrong.

Let me correct this. The formula uses the monthly rate, so i is the monthly rate, which is annual rate divided by 12.

So, let's start over.

We need to find the annual rate r such that the monthly payment is $900.

So, i = r / 12.

The formula is:

900 = 95000 * [ (i (1+i)^240 ) / ( (1+i)^240 - 1 ) ]

Let me try r=9.73%, so i=9.73/12≈0.008108.

Compute (1.008108)^240.

As before, ln(1.008108)=0.008085.

240 *0.008085≈1.939.

e^1.939≈6.93.

Numerator:0.008108 *6.93≈0.0561.

Denominator:6.93 -1=5.93.

So 95000*(0.0561/5.93)=95000*(0.00946)=898. So payment is $898, which is just under $900.

So at r=9.73%, payment is ~$898, which is under $900. So the maximum rate would be just over 9.73% to reach exactly $900.

Looking at the options, the next higher rate is J:10.85%, which would give a much higher payment, as we saw earlier. But perhaps the correct answer is G:9.73%, since it's the highest rate under which the payment is just under $900.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:8.27%, but that gives a payment of $809, which is way under. So the correct answer must be G:9.73%.
</think>

To determine the maximum interest rate the buyer can afford without the monthly payment exceeding \$900, we use the mortgage payment formula:

\[
M = P \cdot \frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( M = \$900 \) (monthly payment),
- \( P = \$95,000 \) (loan amount),
- \( n = 240 \) (number of months),
- \( i \) is the monthly interest rate.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( i \), we test each option by calculating the monthly payment and comparing it to \$900. 

### Key Calculations:
1. **Option G (9.73%)**:
   - Monthly rate: \( i = \frac{9.73\%}{12} \approx 0.008108 \).
   - Compute \( (1+i)^{240} \approx 6.93 \).
   - Payment: \( M \approx \$898 \), which is just under \$900.

2. **Option J (10.85%)**:
   - Monthly rate: \( i = \frac{10.85\%}{12} \approx 0.009042 \).
   - Compute \( (1+i)^{240} \approx 8.71 \).
   - Payment: \( M \approx \$969 \), which is well over \$900.

3. **Option E (8.27%)**:
   - Monthly rate: \( i = \frac{8.27\%}{12} \approx 0.006892 \).
   - Compute \( (1+i)^{240} \approx 5.196 \).
   - Payment: \( M \approx \$809 \), which is significantly under \$900.

### Conclusion:
The highest interest rate that results in a monthly payment close to but not exceeding \$900 is **9.73% (Option G)**, as it yields a payment of approximately \$898. Any higher rate, such as 10.85%, results in a payment exceeding \$900.

**Answer: G**
