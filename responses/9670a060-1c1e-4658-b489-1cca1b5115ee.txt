Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment."
Brown v. Board of Education, 1954
Desegregation of schools was, in part, a response to unfulfilled promises from which of the following initiatives?

Options:

A: The New Deal
B: The Fair Deal
C: The New Frontier
D: Reconstruction
E: The Square Deal
F: The Great Society
G: The Progressive Era
H: The War on Poverty
I: The Emancipation Proclamation
J: The Civil Rights Act

Alright, so I have this question about the Brown v. Board of Education case and the desegregation of schools. The question is asking which initiative's unfulfilled promises led to the push for desegregation. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that Brown v. Board was a 1954 Supreme Court case that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students unconstitutional. The court said that "separate but equal" facilities were inherently unequal, which was a big deal because it overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision from 1896.

Now, the question is about which initiative's promises were unfulfilled, leading to desegregation. I know that after the Civil War, during Reconstruction (1865-1877), the federal government tried to establish equal rights for African Americans, including education. The Reconstruction era saw the passage of the 14th Amendment, which Brown v. Board later cited. But Reconstruction's goals, including educational equality, weren't fully achieved, leading to segregation and the need for later civil rights movements.

Looking at the options, D is Reconstruction. That makes sense because the failure to provide equal education during Reconstruction likely contributed to the need for desegregation in the mid-20th century. Other options like The New Deal (A) were more about economic policies in the 1930s, The Fair Deal (B) was Truman's post-WWII initiatives, The New Frontier (C) was Kennedy's, The Square Deal (E) was Theodore Roosevelt's, The Great Society (F) was LBJ's 1960s programs, The Progressive Era (G) was early 20th-century reforms, The War on Poverty (H) part of The Great Society, The Emancipation Proclamation (I) was by Lincoln to free slaves, and The Civil Rights Act (J) was the 1964 law that addressed discrimination.

So the unfulfilled promises from Reconstruction, particularly in education, would have been a key factor in the push for desegregation in the 1950s. Therefore, the answer should be D: Reconstruction.

The desegregation of schools, as addressed in Brown v. Board of Education, was a response to the unfulfilled promises of Reconstruction, particularly the failure to establish equal educational opportunities for African Americans after the Civil War. 

Answer: D
