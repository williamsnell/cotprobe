Question:

 Why, according to Gill, does Leon Kass think the notion of being "better off dead" is incoherent?

Options:

A: because Kass thinks that death is not a state of being and therefore cannot be evaluated.
B: because Kass believes in the sanctity of life and opposes euthanasia.
C: because Kass maintains that the concept of death is inherently negative and cannot be considered as "better".
D: because there has yet to be a satisfactory philosophical explanation of why death is bad.
E: because dead people no longer exist, and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die.
F: because Kass believes suffering in life can lead to personal growth, making death not a better option.
G: because some things (e.g., long-term torture) are worse than death.
H: because Kass believes that one cannot compare being alive and being dead.
I: because death is, by definition, undesirable.
J: because death cannot be considered as a better option when life is valuable.

Okay, so I've got this question about Leon Kass's views on being "better off dead." I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking why, according to Gill, Kass thinks the notion of being "better off dead" is incoherent. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to recall what Kass's arguments are. I remember that Kass is a philosopher who has written about bioethics, and he's known for opposing things like euthanasia and assisted suicide. He often emphasizes the value of life and the inherent dignity in being alive.

The phrase "better off dead" usually implies that someone's current state is so bad that death would be a preferable alternative. So, if Kass thinks this notion is incoherent, he must have some reasoning against it.

Looking at the options:

A: Kass thinks death isn't a state of being and can't be evaluated. Hmm, this makes sense because death is the absence of life. If you're dead, you can't really have states or experiences, so evaluating whether it's better than life is tricky.

B: He believes in the sanctity of life and opposes euthanasia. That's true, but the question is about why the notion is incoherent, not just his opposition to euthanasia. So B might be a reason, but perhaps not the main point about incoherence.

C: The concept of death is inherently negative. That seems more like a value judgment rather than an argument about coherence. Kass might think death is bad, but the question is about why the idea of being better off dead doesn't make sense.

D: No satisfactory philosophical explanation of why death is bad. I'm not sure if Kass would argue this. He probably thinks death is bad because it's the end of life, not because there's no explanation.

E: Dead people can't benefit from choosing to die. This is a common argument. Once you're dead, you can't choose, so the idea of being better off dead is moot because you can't benefit from it anymore. But is this Kass's point?

F: Suffering can lead to growth, making death not better. This seems more like a positive spin on suffering. I'm not sure if Kass would frame it this way.

G: Some things (like torture) are worse than death. This is a different angle. It's more about comparative suffering rather than the incoherence of the notion itself.

H: Can't compare being alive and dead. This ties into the idea that you can't measure or compare the two states because one is the absence of the other.

I: Death is, by definition, undesirable. Again, this is a value judgment about death, not an argument about the coherence of the notion.

J: Death can't be a better option when life is valuable. This seems to align with H and E, focusing on the value of life making death a worse option.

Wait, the question is about why the notion is incoherent. So, incoherent meaning logically inconsistent or impossible to assess.

Option A says death isn't a state of being, so it can't be evaluated. That makes sense because if you're dead, you don't have any experiences or being to evaluate. So the idea of being "better off" in death is illogical because you can't compare.

Option E says dead people can't benefit from choosing to die. That's more about the practicality or ethics of choosing death, but not about the coherence of the notion itself. It's more about whether the choice is valid, not whether the idea is incoherent.

Option H says you can't compare alive and dead because they're different states. That also makes sense because once you're dead, you're not around to benefit or compare. So the notion of being better off dead is incoherent because you can't have a perspective on it after death.

Wait, so both A and H are about the state of being. A says death isn't a state, so you can't evaluate it. H says you can't compare being alive and dead because they're different.

Which one is more accurate in Kass's argument? From what I recall, Kass argues that death isn't a state you can evaluate because it's the absence of life. So you can't say someone is better off dead because once they're dead, they can't experience being better off. So A might be the answer.

Alternatively, H is about the inability to compare, which is a related point but perhaps more about the comparison rather than the state itself.

I think A is more about the state of being, making the idea incoherent because death isn't a state you can assess. So the notion is incoherent because you can't evaluate death as a state.

The question asks why Leon Kass thinks the notion of being "better off dead" is incoherent, according to Gill. After analyzing the options, the key lies in understanding Kass's view that death is not a state of being and therefore cannot be evaluated. This makes the idea of being "better off dead" incoherent because death is the absence of life, and one cannot compare or assess it as a state of being.
