The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

After having several drinks in a bar, a man and his friend drove by a large home with its lights out. With the man sitting in the passenger seat, the friend pulled the car over. They were feeling drunk and aggressive from the drinks. After discussing it, they decided it was a safe bet to enter the home and see what they could take. They broke in and took several bags of jewelry. While driving away, they were stopped and arrested for burglary. The passenger used the defense that he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to enter the home for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Do the facts described here indicate that the defense will likely prevail at a trial on the merits?

Options:

A: Yes, because the alcohol impaired his judgment, making it impossible for him to make a rational decision.
B: No, because intoxication is never a defense to the commission of a felony.
C: Yes, because the feeling of being drunk and aggressive were not his natural mental state and therefore mens rea was defeated.
D: No, because they had the intent to commit the crime before they even entered the home.
E: Yes, because he was in fact too intoxicated to form the intent needed to prove burglary.
F: Yes, because he was the passenger and not the driver, thus was not directly involved in the act.
G: No, because the act of discussing and deciding to commit the act shows intent, regardless of intoxication.
H: No, because being intoxicated does not diminish the fact that a felony was committed.
I: No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.
J: Yes, because he was under the influence of alcohol and therefore cannot be held responsible for his actions.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the passenger's defense of intoxication will likely succeed in this burglary case. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: a man and his friend, after drinking, decide to break into a home. They take jewelry and get caught. The passenger is arguing that he was too drunk to form the specific intent needed for burglary.

I remember that in criminal law, intent (mens rea) is crucial. Burglary usually requires specific intent, like the intent to commit a felony inside once you break in. So, if he couldn't form that intent because he was intoxicated, maybe his defense works.

Intoxication can sometimes be a defense if it negates the specific intent required for the crime. But I think there's a distinction between voluntary and involuntary intoxication. Since he voluntarily drank, that might affect the outcome.

Wait, but some jurisdictions hold that voluntary intoxication isn't a defense to specific intent crimes. Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think it's that voluntary intoxication can sometimes be a defense if it negates the specific intent, but it's not always allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option E says yes because he was too intoxicated to form the intent needed for burglary. That seems possible. But I also recall that if the intent was formed before getting intoxicated, that could be a problem. Did they decide to commit the crime before getting drunk?

In the facts, they discussed it after drinking but decided to enter the home. So the decision to commit the crime happened when they were already intoxicated. If the intent to commit a felony upon entering was formed while intoxicated, maybe the defense holds.

Option D says no because they had the intent before entering. But if the intent was formed while drunk, does that count? Or does intent have to be formed before getting intoxicated?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If someone gets drunk and then forms the intent to commit a crime, can they use intoxication as a defense? Some jurisdictions say that voluntary intoxication can negate specific intent if it prevented them from forming that intent at the time of the act.

So in this case, if the man was too drunk at the time of breaking in to form the specific intent, then maybe E is correct. But if the intent was formed earlier, before getting too drunk, then maybe D applies.

Wait, the facts say they were feeling drunk and aggressive after drinking, then decided to enter. So the decision to commit the burglary was made while intoxicated. So the specific intent to commit a felony inside was formed when they were already drunk.

In that case, if their intoxication was so severe that they couldn't form the specific intent, then E would be the right answer. But I'm not sure about the law in this area.

Another angle: some jurisdictions don't allow voluntary intoxication as a defense for specific intent crimes. For example, if the crime requires general intent, intoxication isn't a defense. But for specific intent, it might be.

Burglary is typically a specific intent crime because it requires the intent to commit a felony inside. So if he was too drunk to form that intent, the defense could work.

Looking at the options again:

Option E says yes because he was too intoxicated to form the intent needed. That seems correct if the specific intent was formed while intoxicated.

Option D says no because the intent was formed before entering. But if the intent was formed while drunk, then the voluntariness might matter. If the intent was formed before getting drunk, then D would apply, but if it was formed after, while drunk, then E might.

Wait, the facts don't specify whether the intent was formed before or after getting drunk. They had several drinks, then drove by, then decided to enter. So the decision was made after drinking, when they were feeling drunk. So the intent was formed while intoxicated.

So in that case, E would be correct because the specific intent was formed while he was too drunk, making it impossible to form the necessary intent for burglary.

But wait, some states say that even if you were intoxicated, as long as you formed the intent at any point before the act, it's enough. So if they formed the intent to commit a felony when they decided to enter, which was after drinking, maybe they had the intent, so the intoxication doesn't negate it.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me check the options again.

Option G says no because discussing and deciding shows intent regardless of intoxication. So if they had the intent to commit the crime before entering, then the intoxication doesn't matter. But when did they form the intent? After drinking, which made them drunk. So if they had the intent while drunk, maybe the defense applies.

But I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might not accept voluntary intoxication as a defense to specific intent crimes, regardless of when the intent was formed.

Alternatively, if the intoxication was so severe that it prevented them from forming the intent at the time of breaking in, then E would be correct.

I think the key is whether the specific intent was formed at the time of entry. If they were too drunk to form that intent at that moment, then E applies. Otherwise, if the intent was formed earlier, even if drunk, it might not.

In this case, they decided to enter after drinking, so the intent was formed while intoxicated. If their intoxication prevented them from forming the specific intent at that moment, then E is correct. Otherwise, D or G.

I'm leaning towards E being the correct answer because the specific intent was formed while intoxicated, making it impossible to form the necessary intent for burglary.

The passenger's defense hinges on whether he could form the specific intent required for burglary while intoxicated. Burglary typically requires the specific intent to commit a felony upon entering the home. In this case, the decision to enter the home and commit theft was made after drinking, while the man was already intoxicated. If the intoxication was severe enough to prevent him from forming the specific intent at the time of the act, the defense could prevail. 

Analyzing the options, Option E aligns with this reasoning, as it focuses on the intoxication preventing the formation of the necessary intent at the time of the crime. Other options either misstate the law regarding intoxication or fail to consider the timing of the intent formation.

Answer: E
