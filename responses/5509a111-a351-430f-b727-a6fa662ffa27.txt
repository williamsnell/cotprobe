Question:

Mr. A owns 1,000 shares of General Electric common stock. If he tries to sell some, he finds he can get a price of $61.50 per share for all 1,000 shares. If he offers only 500 shares, he can get a price of $61,625 which is $0,125 more per share. That is, reducing his amount sold by a half, he can get a price that is higher by about 1/500. If he sought a price of $61.75, he would sell nothing. Mr. A considers this an insignificant rise in price as a result of withholding his supply. Is this an example of a price-takers' market? Compute Mr. A's marginal revenues as best you can with the given data.

Options:

A: Yes, this is an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61.50 per share
B: Yes, this is an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61,375 per share
C: Yes, this is an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $30,750 per share
D: Yes, this is an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61.625 per share
E: No, this is not an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61,375 per share
F: Yes, this is an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61,625 per share
G: No, this is not an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61,625 per share
H: No, this is not an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $30,750 per share
I: No, this is not an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61.625 per share
J: No, this is not an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61.50 per share

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about Mr. A and his stock shares. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking whether Mr. A is in a price-takers' market and what his marginal revenue is. The options are A through J, with various answers about whether it's a price-takers' market and what the marginal revenue is.

First, I need to understand what a price-taker's market is. From what I remember, a price-taker is someone who has no influence over the market price. They accept the price as it is because the market is so large that one person's actions don't affect the price. So, whether they sell a little or a lot, the price remains the same.

Now, looking at the scenario: Mr. A owns 1,000 shares of GE common stock. When he tries to sell all 1,000 shares, he gets $61.50 per share. But if he offers only 500 shares, he can get a price of $61.625 per share, which is $0.125 higher. Hmm, so by reducing the amount he's selling by half, the price per share goes up a bit. That suggests that his selling a smaller amount might affect the price, which implies he does have some influence on the price. In a price-taker's market, he shouldn't be able to change the price by selling less.

Wait, but the increase is very small—only 1/500 of a dollar. The question says he considers this rise insignificant. So maybe the market is still competitive, and his influence is negligible. But the fact that the price changed when he reduced his offering suggests he does have some power, making it not a price-takers' market.

So, if it's not a price-takers' market, then the first part of the options (A to D) are incorrect because they say "Yes." The options E to J say "No." So, the answer should be in E, F, G, H, I, or J.

Next, let's compute his marginal revenue. Marginal revenue is the additional revenue from selling one more unit. But here, he's selling shares, so it's about the revenue per share.

Wait, actually, in this context, when he sells more shares, the price per share might change. So, marginal revenue would be the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. Let me think.

He can sell 1,000 shares at $61.50 each. Total revenue there would be 1,000 * 61.50 = $61,500.

If he sells only 500 shares, he gets $61.625 each, so total revenue is 500 * 61.625 = let's calculate that. 500 * 61 is 30,500, and 500 * 0.625 is 312.5, so total is 30,812.50.

Wait, but if he sells 500 shares, he's not selling 500, but perhaps the price for the 500 is higher. So, maybe the marginal revenue is when he reduces from 1000 to 500. Alternatively, maybe the marginal revenue per share is higher when he sells fewer shares.

Alternatively, when he sells 500 shares at $61.625, the total revenue is 500 * 61.625 = 30,812.50. But if he had sold all 1000 at $61.50, he would have made 61,500. So the difference is 61,500 - 30,812.50 = 30,687.50. But that's the loss from reducing quantity, not the marginal revenue.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The price when selling all 1000 is $61.50. If he sells 500, he gets $61.625. So, the price per share increases by $0.125 when he sells half. So, for each share he sells, the price drops by a certain amount. Wait, but he's selling fewer shares, so the price goes up.

Marginal revenue is the revenue from selling an additional unit. In this case, when he sells more, the price per share might drop. But here, when he sells less, the price per share increases. So, if he sells one more share, would the price per share drop? Or does he have to lower the price to sell more?

Wait, the way the question is phrased suggests that if he sells all 1000, he gets $61.50 each. If he sells 500, he can get a higher price. So, selling less allows him to get a higher price, implying that the market price isn't fixed, and he can affect it by reducing his supply. That suggests he's not a price-taker but has some market power, making it a not a price-takers' market. So the answer should be "No" in the first part.

Now, for marginal revenue, since when he sells 1,000, the price is $61.50. If he sells 500, the price is $61.625. So, the marginal revenue when selling 500 would be the price at which he sells those 500, which is $61.625 per share. But wait, marginal revenue is the additional revenue from selling an extra unit. But here, he's selling fewer units at a higher price. So, perhaps the marginal revenue for each of the 500 shares is $61.625.

Alternatively, when he sells 500, the marginal revenue is the price per share, which is $61.625. But wait, in economics, marginal revenue is calculated as the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. Let me think: if he sells 1,000 shares, TR1 = 1000 * 61.50 = 61,500. If he sells 500, TR2 = 500 * 61.625 = 30,812.50. The change in quantity is -500, and the change in revenue is 30,812.50 - 61,500 = -30,687.50. So, MR = ΔTR / ΔQ = (-30,687.50) / (-500) = 61.375 per share.

Wait, that makes sense. So, his marginal revenue when reducing from 1000 to 500 is $61.375 per share. But wait, this is the average marginal revenue for those 500 shares. Alternatively, when he sells the 500, each share contributes $61.625 to revenue, but the marginal revenue (the additional revenue from selling one more) is actually higher because selling more would require lowering the price. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the marginal revenue is calculated as the price at which the last unit is sold. So, when he sells 500, the price per share is $61.625, so the marginal revenue for those 500 shares is $61.625 each. But when he sells 1000, the marginal revenue is $61.50 each.

But the question is asking for his marginal revenue as best as can be computed with the given data. So, when he sells 500, he gets a higher price, but the exact marginal revenue might be the change in revenue when he sells one more or one less. Alternatively, since selling less allows him to get a higher price, his marginal revenue for each share he sells is higher than when he sells more.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the marginal revenue when he sells 500 shares. So, when he sells 500, the total revenue is 500 * 61.625 = 30,812.50. The marginal revenue per share would be the additional revenue from selling each share. But since he's selling fewer shares, the marginal revenue is higher.

Wait, I think the correct way is to compute the marginal revenue as the price at which each additional share is sold. But in this case, when he sells 500, each share is sold at 61.625, so the marginal revenue is that. Alternatively, when he sells 1000, it's 61.50.

But the question is about his marginal revenue when he sells 500. So, in that case, the marginal revenue is 61.625 per share. Or, perhaps, since he could have sold more at a lower price, the marginal revenue is the difference between the two prices.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. If he sells 1000, he gets 61.50 each. If he sells 500, he gets 61.625 each. So, the revenue from selling 500 is 500 * 61.625 = 30,812.50. If he had sold all 1000 at 61.50, he would have 61,500. So, by reducing to 500, he loses 30,687.50 in revenue, but gains 0.125 per share on 500 shares, which is 62.50. So, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the marginal revenue is the price he gets for the last share he sells. So, when he sells 500, each of those shares gives him 61.625. Therefore, his marginal revenue per share is 61.625. But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options, option F says yes, it's a price-taker's market, MR is 61,625. But that can't be right because 61,625 is the total revenue for 500 shares. Option I says no, and MR is 61.625. Option J says no, and MR is 61.50.

Wait, the question is about whether it's a price-taker's market. Since reducing the quantity sold increased the price, it's not a price-taker's market, so the answer should be E, F, G, H, I, or J, with the first part being "No."

Now, for the marginal revenue when he sells 500 shares. The total revenue is 500 * 61.625 = 30,812.50. But marginal revenue for each share he sells is 61.625, right? Because that's the price per share. So, the marginal revenue per share is 61.625.

Looking back at the options, option I says "No, this is not an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61.625 per share." So that would be option I. But wait, another way to think about it is that when he sells 500 shares, the marginal revenue is 61.625, but when he sells 1000, it's 61.50. So, his marginal revenue varies depending on how much he sells.

Alternatively, the marginal revenue is the revenue from the last unit sold. So, when he sells 500, the marginal revenue is 61.625. So, the answer would be option I: No, MR is 61.625.

Wait, but another perspective: in a perfectly competitive market (price-taker), the marginal revenue equals the market price. Here, since selling less increases the price, it's not a price-taker. So, the market is not a price-taker's, so the first part is No.

So, the options E, F, G, H, I, J are candidates. Now, the correct MR when selling 500 shares is 61.625 per share. So, the answer would be option I.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option I says "No, MR is 61.625." Option E says "No, MR is 61,375." Wait, 61,375 is 61.375 per share? No, because 61,375 is a total revenue for 1000 shares. So, perhaps I'm mixing up total revenue and marginal revenue.

Wait, let me recalculate. When he sells 500 shares at 61.625, each share contributes 61.625 to MR. So, the marginal revenue per share is 61.625. So, the correct answer is option I.

The scenario describes Mr. A selling shares of General Electric stock. When he sells all 1,000 shares, he receives $61.50 per share. However, reducing the quantity to 500 shares allows him to sell each share for $61.625, a slight increase. This indicates that Mr. A's actions influence the price, meaning he is not a price-taker but has some market power. Therefore, this is **not** an example of a price-takers' market.

To compute the marginal revenue, we consider the revenue generated from selling the 500 shares at $61.625 each. The marginal revenue per share is equal to the price per share when selling those 500 shares, which is $61.625. Thus, the correct answer is:

I: No, this is not an example of a price-takers' market, Marginal revenue is $61.625 per share.

**Answer: I**
