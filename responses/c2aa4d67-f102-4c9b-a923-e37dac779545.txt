Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Butler & Stokes (1969) and their explanation for why the working class supports the Labour Party. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my political science, but let's think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Butler and Stokes were British political scientists. Their work focused on voting behavior, especially in the UK. I think they wrote "The British Party System" or something like that. Their approach was behavioral, looking at how people make decisions when voting.

The question is about the working class's support for the Labour Party. The Labour Party in the UK has traditionally been the party of the working class, promoting socialist policies and trade union rights. So why do working-class people support them?

Looking at the options:

A: Rational calculation of self-interest. That makes sense because if the Labour Party supports policies beneficial to workers, people might vote for them based on their own interests. But I'm not sure if Butler & Stokes focused on rational choice theory. I think their work was more about socialization and habit.

B: Socialization into working class families and communities. Yeah, that sounds familiar. They probably argued that people are socialized from a young age into supporting certain parties. Like, if your family and community support Labour, you're likely to too. That's a strong influence.

C: Influence of trade unions and worker rights movements. Trade unions are definitely a big part of Labour's base, but Butler & Stokes might have looked at this more from a socialization perspective rather than just union influence. Or maybe they considered both.

D: Influence from upper-class ideals. That seems unlikely. The working class wouldn't be influenced by upper-class ideals to support Labour.

E: Local political landscape and voting habits. That's possible. People might vote for the party they've always voted for because it's the habit in their area. But I'm not sure if that's the primary reason Butler & Stokes cited.

F: Desire to conform to societal norms. Maybe, but I think their explanation was more about socialization and habit rather than just conforming.

G: False consciousness and hegemonic values. That's a Marxist concept, suggesting workers don't realize their true interests. I don't think Butler & Stokes went that route; they were more empirical.

H: Lack of exposure to other ideologies. That could be a factor, but I think their explanation was more about existing social structures rather than lack of exposure.

I: Issue-based concerns about culture and lifestyle. Labour's issues do matter, but again, I think the primary reason was more about socialization than specific issues.

J: Dissatisfaction with other parties. That's a possible reason, but again, I'm not sure if that's what Butler & Stokes emphasized.

Wait, I recall that Butler & Stokes discussed the "social conditioning" of voters. They talked about how people's political attitudes are formed early in life through family, education, and community. So working-class people support Labour because they were socialized into that from a young age. That points to option B.

Also, I think they mentioned that voting behavior is often habitual and based on social background. So it's not just about the issues (which would be more of a rational calculation, like option A) but about the socialization into the working class culture.

So putting it together, Butler & Stokes would say it's due to socialization into working-class families and communities, which is option B.

Butler & Stokes (1969) emphasized that working-class support for the Labour Party stems from **socialization into working-class families and communities**. They argued that political attitudes and voting behavior are shaped early in life through exposure to family, education, and community influences, rather than purely rational calculations or issue-based concerns. This social conditioning leads to a habitual alignment with the Labour Party, reflecting the cultural and social background of the working class.

Answer: B
