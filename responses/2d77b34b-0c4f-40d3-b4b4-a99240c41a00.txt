Okay, so I have this problem about a tank with water and salt, and I need to find the amplitude of the oscillation in the long time behavior. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the tank initially has 100 gallons of water and 50 ounces of salt. So, the initial concentration of salt in the tank is 50 oz / 100 gal = 0.5 oz/gal. Water is flowing into the tank at a rate of 2 gallons per minute, and the inflow has a salt concentration of (1/4)(1 + (1/2) sin t) oz/gal. The mixture flows out at the same rate, so the volume in the tank remains constant at 100 gallons.

I remember that this is a type of mixing problem, which can be modeled using a differential equation. The general form of such an equation is dS/dt = (rate in) - (rate out), where S is the amount of salt in the tank at time t.

Let me write down the rates. The rate in is the concentration of the incoming water multiplied by the flow rate. So that would be [ (1/4)(1 + (1/2) sin t) oz/gal ] * 2 gal/min. Let me compute that: 2*(1/4) = 0.5, so the rate in is 0.5*(1 + 0.5 sin t) oz/min. That simplifies to 0.5 + 0.25 sin t oz/min.

The rate out is the concentration in the tank times the flow rate. The concentration in the tank at time t is S(t)/100 oz/gal, so the rate out is (S(t)/100) * 2 = (2 S(t))/100 = S(t)/50 oz/min.

Putting it together, the differential equation is:

dS/dt = (0.5 + 0.25 sin t) - (S(t)/50)

I can rewrite this as:

dS/dt + (1/50) S(t) = 0.5 + 0.25 sin t

This is a linear first-order differential equation. To solve this, I can use an integrating factor. The standard form is dy/dt + P(t) y = Q(t), so here P(t) is 1/50, and Q(t) is 0.5 + 0.25 sin t.

The integrating factor, μ(t), is e^(∫P(t) dt) = e^(∫(1/50) dt) = e^(t/50).

Multiply both sides of the DE by μ(t):

e^(t/50) dS/dt + (1/50) e^(t/50) S(t) = (0.5 + 0.25 sin t) e^(t/50)

The left side is the derivative of [e^(t/50) S(t)] with respect to t. So, integrating both sides:

∫ d/dt [e^(t/50) S(t)] dt = ∫ (0.5 + 0.25 sin t) e^(t/50) dt

Therefore,

e^(t/50) S(t) = ∫ (0.5 + 0.25 sin t) e^(t/50) dt + C

Now, I need to compute the integral on the right. Let me split it into two parts:

Integral = 0.5 ∫ e^(t/50) dt + 0.25 ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt

First integral: 0.5 ∫ e^(t/50) dt

Let u = t/50, so du = dt/50, so dt = 50 du. Wait, but maybe just integrate directly:

∫ e^(at) dt = (1/a) e^(at) + C, so here a = 1/50.

So,

0.5 ∫ e^(t/50) dt = 0.5 * (50) e^(t/50) + C1 = 25 e^(t/50) + C1

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt

This is a bit trickier. I can use integration by parts. Let me recall that ∫ e^(at) sin(bt) dt can be found using a standard formula.

The formula is:

∫ e^(at) sin(bt) dt = e^(at) [a sin(bt) - b cos(bt)] / (a² + b²) + C

In our case, a = 1/50 and b = 1.

So,

∫ sin t e^(t/50) dt = e^(t/50) [ (1/50) sin t - 1 cos t ] / ( (1/50)^2 + 1^2 ) + C

Let me compute the denominator: (1/2500) + 1 = 2501/2500.

So,

= e^(t/50) [ (sin t /50 - cos t) ] / (2501/2500) + C
= e^(t/50) [ (sin t /50 - cos t) * 2500/2501 ) ] + C
= [2500/(2501)] e^(t/50) ( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + C

So putting it together, the second integral is:

0.25 * [2500/(2501)] e^(t/50) ( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + C2

Simplify 0.25 * 2500/2501:

0.25 * 2500 = 625, so 625/2501.

So,

Second integral = (625/2501) e^(t/50) ( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + C2

Now, combining both integrals:

Integral = 25 e^(t/50) + (625/2501) e^(t/50) ( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + C

Factor out e^(t/50):

= e^(t/50) [25 + (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) ] + C

So, going back to the solution:

e^(t/50) S(t) = e^(t/50) [25 + (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) ] + C

Multiply both sides by e^(-t/50):

S(t) = 25 + (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) e^(-t/50) + C e^(-t/50)

Now, apply the initial condition. At t=0, S(0) = 50 oz.

So,

50 = 25 + (625/2501)( (sin 0)/50 - cos 0 ) e^0 + C e^0

Compute each part:

sin 0 = 0, cos 0 = 1, e^0 = 1.

So,

50 = 25 + (625/2501)(0 - 1) * 1 + C * 1

Simplify:

50 = 25 + (625/2501)(-1) + C

Calculate (625/2501)(-1): that's -625/2501 ≈ -0.24995.

So,

50 = 25 - 0.24995 + C

Adding 25 and -0.24995 gives 24.75005.

So,

50 = 24.75005 + C

Subtract:

C = 50 - 24.75005 = 25.24995

So, the general solution is:

S(t) = 25 + (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) e^(-t/50) + 25.24995 e^(-t/50)

Wait, but let me check: did I make a mistake in the constants? Let me recompute the integral part.

Wait, when I computed the second integral, I had:

0.25 * (2500/2501) e^(t/50) ( (sin t)/50 - cos t )

Which is:

(625/2501) e^(t/50) ( (sin t)/50 - cos t )

So that's correct.

So, putting it all together, the solution is:

S(t) = 25 + (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) e^{-t/50} + 25.24995 e^{-t/50}

Wait, but let me combine the exponential terms:

= 25 + [ (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + 25.24995 ] e^{-t/50}

Hmm, but perhaps there's a better way to express this. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out e^{-t/50}.

Wait, let's compute 625/2501. Since 625 is 25^2, and 2501 is 50^2 + 1, which is 2500 +1=2501. So 625/2501 is (50/50)^2/( (50^2 +1) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, 625/2501 is approximately 0.24995.

Wait, 2501 * 0.25 = 625.25, so 625/2501 ≈ 0.24995 exactly.

So, let me write that as approximately 0.25.

Wait, but perhaps I can write this more neatly. Let me see:

The solution is:

S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + 25.24995 ]

Hmm, maybe I can express 25.24995 as (25 + 0.24995). Wait, 25.24995 is 25 + 0.24995.

But let's see:

The term inside the brackets is:

(625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + 25.24995.

I can factor 625/2501 as approximately 0.24995. So,

≈ 0.24995*( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + 25.24995

Let me compute each part:

0.24995*( sin t /50 - cos t ) = 0.24995*(0.02 sin t - cos t ) ≈ 0.004999 sin t - 0.24995 cos t.

Adding 25.24995 gives:

25.24995 - 0.24995 cos t + 0.004999 sin t

So, the solution becomes:

S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ 25.24995 - 0.24995 cos t + 0.004999 sin t ]

Wait, but perhaps I can write this more compactly, noting that 25.24995 is 25 + 0.24995, so:

= 25 + e^{-t/50} [25 + 0.24995 - 0.24995 cos t + 0.004999 sin t ]

But I think that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out the constants. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that as t approaches infinity, the exponential term goes to zero, so the steady-state solution is S(t) approaches 25 oz.

But the problem is about the long-time behavior, which is oscillations about a certain constant level. So, the amplitude of these oscillations would be the maximum deviation from the steady state.

Wait, but perhaps the transient solution is decaying (because of the e^{-t/50} term), so the oscillations are damped, but the problem says the long-time behavior is oscillations about a constant level, implying that perhaps the solution approaches a periodic function with some amplitude.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the solution as S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ K1 sin t + K2 cos t ]

Wait, but in our solution, we have terms involving sin t and cos t multiplied by e^{-t/50}.

Wait, perhaps I can combine the terms into a single sinusoidal function. Let me see.

So, the solution is:

S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + 25.24995 ]

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ A sin t + B cos t + C ]

Wait, but that might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ D cos(t - φ) + E ]

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of amplitude and phase. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the amplitude of the oscillation by looking at the coefficients of sin t and cos t in the transient part.

Wait, looking back, the transient part (the part that goes to zero as t approaches infinity) is:

e^{-t/50} [ (625/2501)( (sin t)/50 - cos t ) + 25.24995 ]

But I think I might have made a mistake in handling the integration. Let me double-check the integration steps.

Wait, when I did the integral of sin t e^{t/50} dt, I used the formula and got:

e^{t/50} [ (1/50) sin t - cos t ] / ( (1/50)^2 + 1 )

Which is:

e^{t/50} [ (sin t /50 - cos t ) ] / (1/2500 + 1 )

Which is e^{t/50} [ (sin t /50 - cos t ) ] * (2500/2501 )

So, the integral is:

(2500/2501) e^{t/50} ( sin t /50 - cos t )

So, when we multiply by 0.25, it becomes:

0.25 * (2500/2501) e^{t/50} ( sin t /50 - cos t )

Which simplifies to:

(625/2501) e^{t/50} ( sin t /50 - cos t )

So that's correct.

So, the solution is:

S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ (625/2501)( sin t /50 - cos t ) + 25.24995 ]

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me compute the coefficients:

First, let's compute (625/2501) * (1/50) = 625/(2501*50) = 625/125050 = 125/25010 ≈ 0.004999.

Similarly, (625/2501)*(-1) = -625/2501 ≈ -0.24995.

So, the transient part is:

e^{-t/50} [ 0.004999 sin t - 0.24995 cos t + 25.24995 ]

So, S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} [ 0.004999 sin t - 0.24995 cos t + 25.24995 ]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can express the oscillatory part as a single sinusoid with amplitude A and phase φ.

Let me denote the transient oscillatory part as:

A e^{-t/50} [ (0.004999) sin t - (0.24995) cos t ]

Which can be written as:

A e^{-t/50} sin(t - φ )

Where A is the amplitude of the oscillation, and φ is the phase shift.

But wait, perhaps I should write the expression as:

R e^{-t/50} sin(t + θ )

So, the amplitude would be R, but since it's multiplied by e^{-t/50}, the amplitude of the oscillation would actually decay over time, but the problem states that the long-time behavior is oscillation about a constant level, which suggests that the transient part might approach a steady oscillation, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, because the e^{-t/50} term tends to zero as t approaches infinity, so the solution approaches 25 oz, which is the steady-state. But the problem says that the long-time behavior is oscillations about a certain constant level, which would imply that perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider if the system is underdamped or overdamped. Wait, in this case, the differential equation is dS/dt + (1/50) S = 0.5 + 0.25 sin t.

The homogeneous solution is S_h = C e^{-t/50}, and the particular solution is the steady-state part, which I think is 25.

Wait, but why is the particular solution 25? Let me check that.

When finding the particular solution for a constant forcing function, we'd set S_p = A, a constant. Then, dS_p/dt = 0, so 0 + (1/50) A = 0.5 + 0.25 sin t.

Wait, but that's a problem because the right-hand side includes a time-dependent term, sin t. So, perhaps the particular solution isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I should use a particular solution of the form A + B sin t + C cos t.

Wait, let me try that.

Let me assume the particular solution S_p(t) = A + B sin t + C cos t.

Then, dS_p/dt = B cos t - C sin t.

Substitute into the DE:

B cos t - C sin t + (1/50)(A + B sin t + C cos t) = 0.5 + 0.25 sin t

Expanding:

B cos t - C sin t + (A/50) + (B/50) sin t + (C/50) cos t = 0.5 + 0.25 sin t

Now, collect like terms:

- For sin t: (-C + B/50) sin t
- For cos t: (B + C/50) cos t
- Constants: A/50

This must equal 0.5 + 0.25 sin t + 0 cos t.

So, we can set up equations by equating coefficients.

For sin t: (-C + B/50) = 0.25
For cos t: (B + C/50) = 0
For constants: A/50 = 0.5

Solving:

From constants: A = 0.5 *50 =25.

From cos t: B + C/50 =0 ⇒ B = -C/50.

From sin t: -C + B/50 = 0.25.

Substituting B = -C/50 into the sin t equation:

-C + (-C/50)/50 = 0.25 ⇒ -C - C/(2500) =0.25.

Factor out C:

C (-1 - 1/2500 ) =0.25 ⇒ C [ (-2501)/2500 ] =0.25

So,

C = 0.25 * (2500 / (-2501)) ) = (625)/(-2501) ≈ -0.24995.

Then, B = -C/50 = (0.24995)/50 ≈ 0.004999.

So, the particular solution is S_p(t) =25 + 0.004999 sin t -0.24995 cos t.

Wait, but this seems different from what I had before. Wait, but previously, in the general solution, I had S(t) =25 + e^{-t/50} [ ... ].

So, perhaps the general solution is S(t) = homogeneous + particular.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The particular solution should not include the exponential term. The homogeneous solution is S_h(t) = C e^{-t/50}, and the particular solution is S_p(t) =25 +0.004999 sin t -0.24995 cos t.

So, the general solution is S(t) = S_h(t) + S_p(t) = C e^{-t/50} +25 +0.004999 sin t -0.24995 cos t.

Wait, that makes more sense. Then, applying the initial condition S(0)=50.

At t=0, S(0) = C e^{0} +25 +0.004999*0 -0.24995*1 = C +25 -0.24995 =50.

So,

C +25 -0.24995 =50 ⇒ C =50 -25 +0.24995 =25 +0.24995=25.24995.

So, the solution is:

S(t) =25.24995 e^{-t/50} +25 +0.004999 sin t -0.24995 cos t.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration approach earlier, and this is the correct form.

Now, as t approaches infinity, the term 25.24995 e^{-t/50} approaches zero, so S(t) approaches 25 +0.004999 sin t -0.24995 cos t.

But the problem says the long-time behavior is oscillation about a certain constant level. So, perhaps the solution approaches a function that oscillates around 25, with some amplitude.

So, the oscillatory part is 0.004999 sin t -0.24995 cos t. Let's find the amplitude of this oscillation.

The amplitude A is given by sqrt( (0.004999)^2 + (-0.24995)^2 )

Compute each term:

(0.004999)^2 ≈ 0.00002499

(-0.24995)^2 ≈ 0.062475

Adding them: 0.00002499 +0.062475 ≈0.0625.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.0625) =0.25.

So, the amplitude is 0.25 oz.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.24995, which is approximately 0.25.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again.

Wait, 0.004999^2 is (approx) (0.005)^2 =0.000025.

(-0.24995)^2 is approx (0.25)^2=0.0625.

Sum: 0.000025 +0.0625=0.062525.

Square root: sqrt(0.062525) ≈0.25005.

Wait, that's approximately 0.25005, which is about 0.25005, which is approximately 0.25.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.24995, which is almost 0.25. So, that's likely the correct answer.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me re-examine the particular solution.

Earlier, from the particular solution, I had S_p(t) =25 +0.004999 sin t -0.24995 cos t.

Wait, but in reality, the coefficients were:

B =0.004999

C= -0.24995.

So, the amplitude is sqrt(B^2 + C^2) = sqrt( (0.004999)^2 + (0.24995)^2 )

Calculating:

0.004999^2 ≈0.00002499

0.24995^2 ≈0.062475

Sum: 0.00002499 +0.062475≈0.06249999.

Square root: sqrt(0.06249999)=0.249999996, which is approximately 0.25.

So, the amplitude is 0.25 oz, which is option B:0.24995.

Wait, but option B is 0.24995, which is very close to 0.25.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 0.25, but due to some approximations, it's 0.24995.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely.

Compute (0.004999)^2:

0.004999^2 = (5e-3 -1e-5)^2 ≈25e-6 - 10e-8 +1e-10 ≈0.000025.

Wait, but more accurately, 0.004999^2 = (0.005 -0.000001)^2 =0.000025 -2*0.005*0.000001 + (0.000001)^2 =0.000025 -0.00000001 +0.000000000001≈0.000024999999.

Similarly, (0.24995)^2 = (0.25 -0.00005)^2 =0.0625 -2*0.25*0.00005 + (0.00005)^2 =0.0625 -0.000025 +0.0000000025≈0.0624750025.

So, adding these:

0.000024999999 +0.0624750025≈0.0625000025.

Then, sqrt(0.0625000025)=0.250000000625.

So, it's approximately 0.250000000625, which is very close to 0.25.

But the options have 0.24995 as option B. So, perhaps the exact value is 0.25, but due to the way the problem was set up, it's 0.24995.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me go back.

Earlier, when finding the particular solution, I had:

From the DE:

dS_p/dt + (1/50) S_p =0.5 +0.25 sin t.

We assumed S_p =A + B sin t + C cos t.

Then, after substituting and equating coefficients, we found:

A=25,

B=0.004999,

C= -0.24995.

So, the amplitude is sqrt(B² + C²) = sqrt( (0.004999)^2 + (0.24995)^2 )

Which is sqrt(0.00002499 +0.0624750025)=sqrt(0.0624999925)=0.25.

So, the amplitude is exactly 0.25 oz.

Wait, but option B is 0.24995, which is very close but not exactly 0.25. So, perhaps the exact answer is 0.25, but due to some approximations, it's presented as 0.24995.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me double-check the particular solution.

Wait, when I solved for C and B, I had:

From the cos t term: B + C/50 =0 ⇒ B= -C/50.

From the sin t term: -C + B/50 =0.25.

Substituting B= -C/50 into this:

-C + (-C/50)/50 =0.25 ⇒ -C - C/(2500)=0.25.

Factor out C: C*(-1 -1/2500)=0.25 ⇒ C=0.25/( -1 -1/2500 )=0.25/( -2501/2500 )=0.25*(-2500/2501 )= -625/2501 ≈-0.24995.

Then, B= -C/50= (625/2501)/50=625/(2501*50)=625/125050=125/25010≈0.004999.

So, the coefficients are correct.

Thus, the amplitude is sqrt( (0.004999)^2 + (0.24995)^2 )=0.25.

So, the correct answer should be 0.25, which is option E:0.50000? Wait, no, option E is 0.50000, which is not correct. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A:0.14995

B:0.24995

C:0.34995

D:0.29995

E:0.50000

F:0.44995

G:0.39995

H:0.19995

I:0.59995

J:0.10000

Wait, so the correct amplitude is 0.25, but none of the options is exactly 0.25. The closest is option B:0.24995, which is approximately 0.25.

Therefore, the answer is option B:0.24995.

The problem involves a tank with 100 gallons of water and 50 ounces of salt. Water flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gallons per minute with a salt concentration of \(\frac{1}{4}\left(1+\frac{1}{2} \sin t\right)\) oz/gal, and the mixture flows out at the same rate. The goal is to determine the amplitude of the oscillation in the long-time behavior of the salt concentration.

1. **Modeling the Problem**:  
   The differential equation governing the amount of salt \(S(t)\) in the tank is:  
   \[
   \frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{1}{50} S(t) = 0.5 + 0.25 \sin t
   \]  
   This is a linear first-order differential equation.

2. **Solving the Differential Equation**:  
   Using the integrating factor method, the solution is found to be:  
   \[
   S(t) = 25 + e^{-t/50} \left[ 0.004999 \sin t - 0.24995 \cos t + 25.24995 \right]
   \]  
   As \(t \to \infty\), the exponential term decays, leaving the oscillatory part.

3. **Finding the Amplitude**:  
   The oscillatory part is \(0.004999 \sin t - 0.24995 \cos t\). The amplitude \(A\) is given by:  
   \[
   A = \sqrt{(0.004999)^2 + (-0.24995)^2} \approx 0.25
   \]  
   The closest option to this value is **0.24995**.

**Answer**:  
B: 0.24995
