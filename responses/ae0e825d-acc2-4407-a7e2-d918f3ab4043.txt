Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an important formal characteristic of art. The question is asking what that characteristic is, and I have to choose from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what a "formal characteristic" of art means. From what I remember, formal characteristics refer to the elements and principles that make up the structure of a work of art. These are the basic components that artists use to create their pieces. So, things like line, shape, color, texture, form, space, value, and composition come to mind. These are the building blocks, the technical aspects that define the artwork's form.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: the artist's nationality — Hmm, nationality is more about the background of the artist rather than the characteristics of the art itself. So probably not this one.

B: its power to evoke strong emotions — That sounds more like an emotional or expressive aspect, which is important, but I'm not sure if it's a formal characteristic. It's more about the impact on the viewer rather than the structure of the art.

C: social meaning — Social meaning relates to the content or message the art conveys, which is more about context and less about the form. So maybe not this option either.

D: the use of geometric shapes — Geometric shapes are definitely an element of art. They fall under the formal characteristics because they're part of the composition and structure. This could be a contender.

E: the size of the artwork — Size can affect the art, but it's more of a physical attribute rather than a formal characteristic. Formal characteristics are more about the elements used, not their dimensions.

F: faithful representation — That sounds more like a style or approach, perhaps realism, but not necessarily a formal characteristic. It's about how accurately the art represents something, which is more about content than form.

G: its ability to depict historical events accurately — Again, this is about content and accuracy, not the form or structure of the art itself.

H: coherence — Coherence refers to how the elements come together in a unified way. That makes sense as a formal characteristic because it's about the arrangement and how the parts work together, contributing to the overall composition.

I: its monetary value — This is definitely not a formal characteristic. It's about the market value, which is external to the artwork itself.

J: the use of vibrant colors — Vibrant colors are an element of art, specifically color. They can be a formal characteristic because they contribute to the visual aspects of the artwork.

So, narrowing it down, the options that seem to fit as formal characteristics are D (geometric shapes), H (coherence), and J (vibrant colors). 

Wait, but the question is about an important formal characteristic, and I might need to pick the best fit. Coherence (H) seems to be about how the elements are arranged, which is a principle of art, not just an element. So perhaps H is a good candidate. Alternatively, D and J are elements, but the question is about a characteristic, which could encompass both elements and principles.

I think the key here is that formal characteristics include both elements and principles. So, geometric shapes (D) are an element, and coherence (H) is a principle. The question is asking for an important one, so either could be correct, but I need to consider which is more likely to be the answer.

Looking back, I remember that in art theory, formal characteristics often include elements like line, shape, color, etc., as well as principles like balance, unity, coherence. So coherence is a principle that makes the artwork unified. Therefore, H might be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the question is looking for an element, then D or J could be right. But the question says "formal characteristic," which can include both elements and principles. So perhaps coherence is the intended answer here.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes coherence isn't as commonly listed as a formal characteristic. Maybe I should think again. The options are A to J, and the answer is one of them.

Another approach: think about each option. The question is about what's an important formal characteristic. So, for example, in a painting, the use of geometric shapes contributes to the form. Similarly, coherence makes the artwork make sense together.

I think the answer is H: coherence because it's about how the elements come together in a structured way, which is a key formal aspect. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D or J, but I'm more confident that H is correct.

The question asks for an important formal characteristic of art. Formal characteristics include both elements (like line, shape, color) and principles (like balance, unity, coherence) that structure a work of art. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, E, F, G, I** are not formal characteristics as they relate to the artist's background, content, size, or external factors like monetary value.
- **B** is about emotional impact, which is more expressive than formal.
- **D (geometric shapes)** and **J (vibrant colors)** are elements of art and thus formal characteristics.
- **H (coherence)** is a principle of art, as it refers to the arrangement of elements in a unified way.

While D and J are elements, H is a principle that is crucial for the artwork's structure and unity. Therefore, the best answer is **H: coherence**.

Answer: H
