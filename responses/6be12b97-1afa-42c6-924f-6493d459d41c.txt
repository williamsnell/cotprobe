Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the RMS thermal noise voltage for a resistor in two different bandwidths. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

First, I remember that thermal noise voltage is calculated using the formula derived from the Johnson-Nyquist theorem. The formula is Vrms = sqrt(4 * k * T * R * Δf), where:
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature in Kelvin,
- R is the resistance,
- Δf is the bandwidth.

I think Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38 × 10^-23 J/(K·Hz), right? And the temperature here is given as 27°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. So 27°C plus 273.15 is 300.15 K, roughly 300 K for simplicity.

The resistor value R is 40k ohms, which is 40,000 ohms.

Now, the problem has two parts: part (a) is from 0 to 10 kHz, so Δf is 10 kHz. Part (b) is from 10 kHz to 25 kHz, so Δf is 15 kHz (since 25 -10 =15). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 25 -10 is 15 kHz? No, 25-10 is 15, yeah, because 10 to 25 is 15 kHz of bandwidth. So for part (a) Δf is 10 kHz, and part (b) is 15 kHz.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The bandwidth for part (a) is 0 to 10 kHz, which is a Δf of 10 kHz. For part (b), it's from 10 kHz to 25 kHz, which is a Δf of 15 kHz. So yes, that's correct.

So for each part, I'll compute Vrms separately.

Let me plug in the numbers for part (a): 0 to 10 kHz.

Vrms(a) = sqrt(4 * k * T * R * Δf_a)
= sqrt(4 * 1.38e-23 * 300 * 40e3 * 10e3)

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 4 * k * T * R * Δf.

4 * 1.38e-23 = 5.52e-23.

Then multiply by T (300): 5.52e-23 * 300 = 1.656e-20.

Multiply by R (40e3): 1.656e-20 * 40e3 = 6.624e-16.

Multiply by Δf_a (10e3): 6.624e-16 * 1e4 = 6.624e-12.

Now take the square root of that: sqrt(6.624e-12) ≈ 8.14e-6 volts. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate:

Wait, 4 * k * T * R * Δf = 4 * 1.38e-23 * 300 * 40e3 * 10e3.

Let me compute each multiplication step by step:

4 * 1.38e-23 = 5.52e-23.

5.52e-23 * 300 = 1.656e-20.

1.656e-20 * 40,000 (40e3) = 1.656e-20 * 4e4 = 6.624e-16.

6.624e-16 * 10,000 (10e3) = 6.624e-16 * 1e4 = 6.624e-12.

So sqrt(6.624e-12) = sqrt(6.624) * sqrt(1e-12) ≈ 2.575e-6 volts. Oh, because sqrt(6.624) is approximately 2.575.

So Vrms(a) ≈ 2.575e-6 V, which is about 2.57 ×10^-6 V. Looking at the options, part (a) is 2.57e-6 for options A, C, D, E, F, I.

Now for part (b), the bandwidth is 15 kHz.

Vrms(b) = sqrt(4 * k * T * R * 15e3).

Let me compute this.

4 * 1.38e-23 = 5.52e-23.

5.52e-23 * 300 = 1.656e-20.

1.656e-20 * 40e3 = 6.624e-16.

6.624e-16 * 15e3 = 9.936e-12.

sqrt(9.936e-12) = sqrt(9.936) * 1e-6 ≈ 3.152e-6 V, so approximately 3.15e-6 V.

Wait, that's about 3.15 ×10^-6 V.

Looking at the options, which option has part (a) as 2.57e-6 and part (b) as 3.15e-6?

Looking at the options:

A: (a) 2.57e-6, (b) 4.15e-6.

B: (a) 3.57e-6, (b) 3.15e-6.

C: (a) 2.57e-6, (b) 1.15e-6.

D: (a) 2.57e-6, (b)3.15e-6.

E: (a)2.07e-6, (b)2.65e-6.

F: (a)2.57e-6, (b)2.15e-6.

I: (a)1.57e-6, (b)3.15e-6.

So option D: 2.57e-6 and 3.15e-6.

Wait, but I thought the calculation for part (b) is 3.15e-6, which matches option D's second value.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Let me check part (b) again.

Wait, in part (b), the formula is the same. So Vrms(b) would be sqrt(4kTR * Δf_b).

Wait, I think I did it correctly. Let me try recalculating part (b):

4kTRΔf_b =4 *1.38e-23 *300 *40e3 *15e3.

Compute step by step.

4 *1.38e-23 =5.52e-23.

5.52e-23 *300 =1.656e-20.

1.656e-20 *40e3 =6.624e-16.

6.624e-16 *15e3 =9.936e-12.

sqrt(9.936e-12) = sqrt(9.936) * 1e-6. Since sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(10) is about 3.162. So sqrt(9.936) is approx 3.153, so 3.153e-6 V. That's 3.15 ×10^-6.

So part (a) is 2.57e-6, part (b) is 3.15e-6. So the correct option is D.

Wait, but in the options, option D says "2.57 ×10^-6 voltsrms and 3.15 ×10^-6 voltsrms." So yes, that's correct.

The RMS thermal noise voltage is calculated using the Johnson-Nyquist formula:  
\[
V_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{4 \cdot k \cdot T \cdot R \cdot \Delta f}
\]  
where:  
- \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/(K·Hz)}\) (Boltzmann's constant),  
- \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\) (converted from \(27^\circ \text{C}\)),  
- \(R = 40,000 \, \Omega\),  
- \(\Delta f\) is the bandwidth.  

### Part (a): 0 to 10 kHz (\(\Delta f = 10 \, \text{kHz}\))  
\[
V_{\text{rms(a)}} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 300 \cdot 40,000 \cdot 10,000} = \sqrt{6.624 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 2.57 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}_{\text{rms}}
\]

### Part (b): 10 kHz to 25 kHz (\(\Delta f = 15 \, \text{kHz}\))  
\[
V_{\text{rms(b)}} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 300 \cdot 40,000 \cdot 15,000} = \sqrt{9.936 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 3.15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}_{\text{rms}}
\]

### Matching with Options  
From the calculations:  
- Part (a): \(2.57 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}_{\text{rms}}\)  
- Part (b): \(3.15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}_{\text{rms}}\)  

The correct option is **D**: \(2.57 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}_{\text{rms}}\) and \(3.15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}_{\text{rms}}\).

**Answer:** D
