Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about what Shapiro claims based on surveys and longitudinal studies. Let me break it down.

The question is asking what Shapiro claims, and the options are A to J. I remember that Shapiro is associated with research on drug use, particularly looking at whether drug use is a temporary phase or more long-term.

First, I think about what I know from psychology and sociology regarding drug use. I recall that many people experiment with drugs during adolescence, but not everyone continues using them. Some studies suggest that most people who try drugs don't end up becoming addicted. So that might point towards options B, E, or H.

Looking at the options:

A: Talks about a temporary phase in adolescence. That sounds possible, but I think it's more about experimentation rather than a phase that everyone goes through.

B: Most individuals experiment but don't continue. That aligns with the idea that most people don't progress to regular use.

C: Excessive use of legal drugs is the norm. I don't think that's what Shapiro is known for; he's more focused on illegal drugs.

D: Use diminishes over time. That might not be the case for everyone, as some people do become addicted.

E: They stop before addiction. This also sounds plausible, similar to B but more about stopping before addiction.

F: No consistent patterns. I don't think that's correct because Shapiro's work suggests there are patterns.

G: Transition to legal substances. Not sure, but I don't recall that being a main point.

H: Moderate use is the norm. That seems more like a harm reduction perspective, which might not be what Shapiro is saying.

I: They don't stop until addicted. That's the opposite of B and E; Shapiro's work probably argues against this.

J: Excessive use is the norm. Again, seems unlikely because most people don't use excessively.

So between B and E. The wording is important. Option B says most experiment but don't continue, while E says they stop before addiction. Shapiro's work, as I remember, emphasizes that most people who try drugs don't become addicted. So maybe E is more specific about stopping before addiction, which is a key point.

Wait, but the question says "indicate that." So Shapiro's claim is supported by longitudinal studies. From what I know, longitudinal studies show that many adolescents try drugs but don't continue, and often stop before it becomes a problem. So E seems to capture that better than B, which is more about experimentation in general.

So I think the answer is E.

The answer is E.

E: those who begin using illegal drugs typically stop before addiction sets in.

The reasoning is that Shapiro's research, supported by longitudinal studies, indicates that most individuals who experiment with illegal drugs do not continue using them and often stop before addiction occurs. This aligns with the idea that drug use is often a temporary phase rather than a long-term issue for many people.

Answer: E
