Question:

Traveling at an initial speed of 1.5 × 10^6 m/s, a proton enters a region of constant magnetic field, B, of magnitude 1.0 T. If the proton's initial velocity vector makes an angle of 30° with the direction of B, compute the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a proton moving into a magnetic field, and I'm supposed to find its speed after 4 seconds. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my classes.

Alright, the proton's initial speed is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. The magnetic field B is 1.0 T, and the angle between the velocity and B is 30 degrees. The question is asking for the speed after 4 seconds.

Wait, right, when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. Oh, right, that's the Lorentz force. The formula for that force is F = q(v × B). So, the force is qvB sin(theta), where theta is the angle between v and B.

But wait, the force is perpendicular to the velocity. That means the force doesn't do any work on the proton because work is force times displacement in the direction of the force. Since the force is perpendicular, the work done is zero. So, the kinetic energy shouldn't change, right? Because work done is the change in kinetic energy.

If the kinetic energy doesn't change, then the speed of the proton should remain constant. Because kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and if that's constant, v must stay the same unless mass changes, which it doesn't here.

So, the proton is moving in a magnetic field, and as long as the magnetic field is constant, the speed doesn't change. It might change direction because the force is centripetal, causing circular motion, but the speed magnitude remains the same.

So, in this case, after 4 seconds, the speed is still the initial speed of 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. Let me check the options. Option A is that value. So the answer should be A.

The proton's speed remains constant because the magnetic force does no work, leaving the kinetic energy unchanged. 

Answer: A
