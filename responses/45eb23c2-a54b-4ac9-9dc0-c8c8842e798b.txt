Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's break it down step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, select the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1: "The Stanford Sentiment Treebank contained movie reviews, not book reviews."

I remember that the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a well-known dataset used for sentiment analysis. From what I've studied, it's specifically about movie reviews. I think it was created by researchers at Stanford to analyze the sentiment of sentences in movie reviews, which helps in training models to detect positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. So, I'm pretty sure Statement 1 is true because it's about movie reviews, not books.

Statement 2: "The Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling."

Penn Treebank is another dataset I'm familiar with. I recall that it's a large corpus of parsed sentences from various sources, including books, newspapers, and other documents. It's been widely used in natural language processing for tasks like part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and yes, language modeling. Language modeling involves predicting the next word in a sequence, and having a diverse dataset like Penn Treebank helps in training such models. So, Statement 2 is also true.

Now, looking at the options:

A: True, True â€“ This matches my assessment of both statements being true.

The correct answer is A, as both statements are true.

Answer: A
