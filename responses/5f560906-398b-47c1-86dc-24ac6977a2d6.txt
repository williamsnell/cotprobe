Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Earth's radius decreasing and how that affects the length of the day. Hmm, I remember that when a figure skater pulls in their arms, they spin faster because their moment of inertia decreases. So maybe the same principle applies here.

Alright, the Earth is treated as a uniform sphere with moment of inertia I = (2/5) mR². The radius decreases by 1/2 percent. Wait, 1/2 percent is 0.5%, right? So the new radius would be R' = R - 0.005R = 0.995R.

I think angular momentum is conserved here because there's no external torque mentioned. So L_initial = L_final. Angular momentum L is Iω, where ω is the angular velocity. Since I changes, ω must change to keep L constant.

Let me write that down. Initial angular momentum L = I * ω_initial. After the radius changes, the new moment of inertia I' = (2/5) m (R')² = (2/5) m (0.995R)². Let's compute that.

I' = (2/5) m R² * (0.995)². Since the mass m of Earth doesn't change, I' = I_initial * (0.995)². So I' = I * (0.990025). 

So L_initial = I * ω_initial = I' * ω_final. Therefore, I * ω_initial = I' * ω_final. Dividing both sides by I', we get ω_final = ω_initial * (I / I'). 

Wait, I is the initial I, which is I_initial, and I' is the new I. So ω_final = ω_initial * (I_initial / I').

But I_initial is I, so substituting, ω_final = ω_initial * (1 / 0.990025). Let me compute 1/0.990025. Let me approximate that. 0.990025 is approximately 0.99, so 1/0.99 ≈ 1.0101. But more accurately, 0.990025 is 1 - 0.009975. Let me compute 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. Here x is 0.009975, so 1/(0.990025) ≈ 1 + 0.009975 ≈ 1.009975. So ω increases by about 0.9975%.

Wait, but let me check that calculation. 0.990025 is 0.995^2. 0.995 * 0.995 is indeed 0.990025.

So ω_final = ω_initial * (1 / 0.990025). Let me compute 1 / 0.990025 exactly. Let's see, 0.990025 is 990025e-6. Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach: 1 / 0.990025 ≈ 1.009975, so about a 0.9975% increase in ω.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me compute 1/0.990025. Let's see, 0.990025 is close to 1, so 1/0.990025 is about 1.0101. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 0.99 times 1.01 is about 1. So 0.99 * 1.01 = 0.9999, which is almost 1. So 1/0.99 ≈ 1.0101. But 0.990025 is slightly less than 0.99, so 1/0.990025 is a bit more than 1.0101. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 990025 * x = 1,000,000 to get x = 1,000,000 / 990,025. Let's compute that. 990,025 * 1.01 is 990,025 + 990,025 * 0.01 = 990,025 + 9,900.25 = 1,000,  which is 999,925.25, which is less than 1,000,000. So 1.01 gives 999,925.25, so the difference is 74.75. So to get from 999,925.25 to 1,000,000, we need an additional 74.75.

So, 74.75 / 990,025 ≈ 0.0000755. So x ≈ 1.01 + 0.0000755 ≈ 1.0100755. So approximately 1.0100755.

Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, using the approximation for small x, 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x² + ... So if x is 0.009975, then 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + 0.009975 + (0.009975)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009975 + 0.0000995 ≈ 1.0100745. So about 1.0100745.

So ω_final ≈ ω_initial * 1.0100745, which is a 1.00745% increase in ω.

Wait, so the new ω is about 1.0100745 times the original ω. So the day length would decrease by the inverse of that. Because ω is inversely proportional to the period (since ω = 2π/T). So if ω increases by a factor, the period T decreases by the same factor.

So the new period T' = T_initial / 1.0100745. So the change in T is ΔT = T' - T_initial = T_initial (1/1.0100745 - 1) = T_initial ( (1 - 1.0100745) / 1.0100745 ) = T_initial ( -0.0100745 / 1.0100745 ) ≈ T_initial * (-0.009975). So a negative change, meaning the day gets shorter.

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation. Let me compute 1/1.0100745. Let me compute it as approximately 0.9900745. Because 1 / (1 + 0.0100745) ≈ 1 - 0.0100745 + (0.0100745)^2 - ... which is approximately 0.9900745.

So T' ≈ T_initial * 0.9900745. So the change in T is T_initial - T_initial * 0.9900745 = T_initial * (1 - 0.9900745) = T_initial * 0.0099255.

So the day shortens by about 0.99255% of the original day length.

Wait, the original day length is 24 hours. Let me compute 24 hours * 0.0099255 ≈ 0.2382 hours. To convert that to minutes, multiply by 60: 0.2382 * 60 ≈ 14.29 minutes.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure the calculation is correct. Because the initial assumption is that the radius decreases by 0.5%, so R' = 0.995 R.

Wait, let me go through the steps again more accurately.

1. The moment of inertia I is proportional to R². So I_initial = (2/5) m R², I_final = (2/5) m (0.995 R)² = (2/5) m R² * (0.995)² = I_initial * (0.995)^2.

2. Since angular momentum L is conserved, L_initial = L_final. So I_initial * ω_initial = I_final * ω_final.

3. I_final = I_initial * (0.995)^2 = I_initial * 0.990025.

4. So ω_final = (I_initial / I_final) * ω_initial = (1 / 0.990025) * ω_initial ≈ 1.010075 * ω_initial.

5. The new angular velocity is higher by a factor of ~1.010075, so the period (T = 2π/ω) will be shorter by the same factor.

6. The change in period is ΔT = T_initial - T_final = T_initial - T_initial / 1.010075 ≈ T_initial (1 - 1/1.010075) ≈ T_initial (1 - 0.9900745) ≈ T_initial * 0.0099255.

7. The original period T_initial is 24 hours. So ΔT ≈ 24 * 0.0099255 hours ≈ 0.2382 hours.

8. Convert to minutes: 0.2382 * 60 ≈ 14.29 minutes.

So the day would be shorter by approximately 14.29 minutes. That's a decrease of about 14.29 minutes.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J:14.28 minutes.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the factor. Because sometimes when things contract, the change in period is proportional to the inverse of the square root, but no, in this case, it's a direct change in moment of inertia and angular velocity.

Wait, no, because angular momentum L = I ω is conserved, and I is proportional to R², so ω must increase by a factor of (I_initial / I_final) = 1/(0.995)^2 = 1/0.990025 ≈ 1.010075.

So the period T is inversely proportional to ω, so T_final = T_initial / 1.010075 ≈ T_initial * 0.9900745.

So the change in T is T_initial - T_final = T_initial (1 - 0.9900745) = T_initial * 0.0099255.

So 24 hours * 0.0099255 ≈ 0.2382 hours, which is about 14.29 minutes.

So the correct answer should be about 14.29 minutes decrease. Looking at the options, option J is 14.28 minutes, which is very close.
</think>

The Earth's radius decreases by 0.5%, reducing its moment of inertia and causing the angular velocity to increase while keeping angular momentum constant. The new radius is \( R' = 0.995R \), and the new moment of inertia is \( I' = I \cdot (0.995)^2 \approx 0.990025I \). Using conservation of angular momentum, \( \omega_{\text{final}} = \omega_{\text{initial}} \cdot \frac{I}{I'} \approx \omega_{\text{initial}} \cdot 1.010075 \). The period \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \omega \), so the new period is \( T' = T_{\text{initial}} / 1.010075 \approx T_{\text{initial}} \cdot 0.9900745 \). The change in period is \( \Delta T = T_{\text{initial}} - T' \approx T_{\text{initial}} \cdot 0.0099255 \). For a 24-hour day, \( \Delta T \approx 0.2382 \) hours, or about 14.29 minutes. The closest option is **J: 14.28 minutes**.
