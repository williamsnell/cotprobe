Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about virtual memory systems that use pages. Let me break down each part step by step.

The question is asking which statements I, II, and III are true. The options are combinations of these statements, so I need to evaluate each one individually.

Statement I: "The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory." Hmm, from what I remember, virtual memory allows a program to use more memory than what's physically available. It does this by swapping pages between main memory and secondary storage like a hard drive. So the virtual address space is indeed larger than the physical memory. That makes statement I true.

Statement II: "Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution." Wait, no, that's not right. In virtual memory systems, programs don't need to stay entirely in main memory. Parts of them can be swapped out to disk when not in use. So the program doesn't have to be fully resident; it can be in parts. Therefore, statement II is false.

Statement III: "Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program." I'm a bit confused here. Semantic characteristics relate to the meaning or structure of the program, like functions or data structures. Pages, on the other hand, are just fixed-size blocks of memory. They don't inherently have any semantic meaning; they're just chunks for addressing. So statement III is false.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up something. Sometimes people talk about paging in terms of how the program is structured, but I think that's more about the hardware and not the semantics of the program itself. The page size is fixed, and it's the OS that manages how these pages are used, not based on the program's structure. So I'm pretty sure statement III is false.

Now, looking at the options:

A: I and III → But III is false, so A is incorrect.
B: None of the above → No, because I is true.
C: All of the above → No, since II and III are false.
D: I and II and not III → No, II is false.
E: I, II and III → No, II and III are false.
F: III only → No, I is true.
G: I only → Yes, because only I is true.
H: II and III → Both are false.
I: I and II → II is false.
J: II only → No.

So the correct answer is G: I only.

The correct answer is G: I only.
