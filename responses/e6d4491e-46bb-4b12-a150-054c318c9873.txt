Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive isotopes and their half-lives. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says there are two isotopes, A and B. Isotope A has a half-life of 3 days, and B has a half-life of 6 days. Initially, there are twice as many atoms of A as B. I need to find out after how many days the ratio of A to B will be reversed. So, the initial ratio is A:B = 2:1, and I need to find when it becomes 1:2.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows the formula N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial quantity, t is time, and T is the half-life. So, I think I can set up equations for both isotopes and then set up a ratio.

Let me denote the initial number of A atoms as 2N and B as N, since there are twice as many A as B. Wait, actually, if I let the initial number of B be N0, then the initial number of A would be 2N0, right? Because twice as many. So, A starts at 2N0 and B at N0.

Now, after time t, the number of A atoms left will be A(t) = 2N0 * (1/2)^(t/3), since its half-life is 3 days. Similarly, B(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/6), because its half-life is 6 days.

I need the ratio A(t)/B(t) to be 1/2. So, I set up the equation:

A(t)/B(t) = (2N0 * (1/2)^(t/3)) / (N0 * (1/2)^(t/6)) ) = 1/2.

Simplify the equation. The N0 cancels out, because they're in numerator and denominator. So we have:

2 * (1/2)^(t/3) / (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/2.

Wait, let's compute the exponents. Remember that (1/2)^a divided by (1/2)^b is (1/2)^(a-b). So, (1/2)^(t/3 - t/6) equals (1/2)^(t/6).

So now the equation becomes 2 * (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/2.

Let me write that as 2 * (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by 2 to get (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/4.

Because 1/2 divided by 2 is 1/4. So, (1/2)^(t/6) = (1/2)^2. Because 1/4 is (1/2)^2.

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So t/6 = 2. Multiply both sides by 6, t = 12 days.

Wait, but I need to check if that makes sense. Let me plug t=12 into the original expressions.

A(12) = 2N0 * (1/2)^(12/3) = 2N0 * (1/2)^4 = 2N0 * 1/16 = 2N0/16 = N0/8.

B(12) = N0 * (1/2)^(12/6) = N0 * (1/2)^2 = N0/4.

So the ratio A/B would be (N0/8) / (N0/4) = (1/8) / (1/4) = (1/8) * (4/1) )= 4/8 = 1/2. Wait, that's correct. The ratio is 1:2, which is the reverse of the initial 2:1.

So the answer should be 12 days. Looking at the options, option C is 12.0, so the answer is C.

The problem involves two isotopes, A and B, with half-lives of 3 days and 6 days, respectively. Initially, there are twice as many atoms of A as B. We need to determine when the ratio of A to B becomes 1:2.

Using the radioactive decay formula, the number of atoms remaining after time \( t \) is given by:
\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/T}
\]
where \( N_0 \) is the initial quantity and \( T \) is the half-life.

Let the initial number of B atoms be \( N_0 \). Then, the initial number of A atoms is \( 2N_0 \). After time \( t \), the quantities are:
\[
A(t) = 2N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/3}
\]
\[
B(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6}
\]
We set the ratio \( \frac{A(t)}{B(t)} = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
\frac{2N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/3}}{N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Simplifying, the \( N_0 \) terms cancel, and using properties of exponents:
\[
2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/3 - t/6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Since \( \frac{1}{4} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \), the exponents must be equal:
\[
\frac{t}{6} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 12 \text{ days}
\]
Verifying, after 12 days:
\[
A(12) = 2N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{N_0}{8}, \quad B(12) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{N_0}{4}
\]
The ratio \( \frac{A(12)}{B(12)} = \frac{\frac{N_0}{8}}{\frac{N_0}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \), confirming the solution.
