Okay, so I need to figure out how the city of Cobb should report trust funds A and B. Let me start by understanding the question.

The city has two trust funds: A and B. Trust fund A's earnings can only be expended, meaning the principal is kept intact, and only the interest or earnings are used. Trust fund B, on the other hand, allows both the principal and the interest to be expended. 

I remember that in governmental accounting, especially under GAAP, funds are categorized based on their purposes and the rules governing their use. The main types of funds include General, Special Revenue, Debt Service, Capital Projects, and Permanent Funds.

Trust fund A is a bit like an earnings-only account. Since only the earnings can be spent, this sounds similar to an investment trust where the principal is preserved. I think in accounting, when the principal can't be spent and only the income is used, it's treated as a Special Revenue Fund or maybe a Permanent Fund. Wait, no, Permanent Funds are where both principal and income are restricted, but in this case, it's only the principal that's restricted, not the earnings. So maybe it's a Special Revenue Fund because it's designated for specific purposes, and the earnings are used as they come in.

Trust fund B allows both the principal and the interest to be expended. That sounds like a Capital Projects Fund because it's meant for financing capital assets, where the principal can be spent on projects, and interest is used for debt service or other expenses. Alternatively, it could be a Special Revenue Fund as well, but I think Capital Projects is more specific here since it's about the principal being available for expenditure on projects.

Wait, no, Capital Projects Funds are used when the money is legally restricted to specific capital expenditures. So if trust fund B's principal and interest can both be spent, it's likely a Capital Projects Fund. Or maybe it's a Special Revenue Fund if it's for a specific purpose, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think about the types again. Special Revenue Funds are used when the money is set aside for specific revenues and specific purposes, but the principal can be spent as part of that. Capital Projects Funds are for financing capital assets, where the principal is used for the project, and interest is handled as part of the fund.

Wait, but in this case, trust fund B allows both principal and interest to be expended. That seems to fit the Capital Projects Fund because the principal is used for the project, and the interest is part of the funds available for that purpose. Alternatively, if the principal can't be spent, it's a different fund.

Let me think about the options again. The options for each fund are paired, like A is the first, B is the second. So for Trust fund A, which is earnings only, it's probably a Special Revenue Fund because it's for specific revenue purposes. Trust fund B, since both principal and interest can be spent, is likely a Capital Projects Fund because it's used for projects where the principal is spent on the project, and the interest is part of the fund's operations.

Wait, but another thought: Capital Projects Funds are used when the funds are legally restricted to specific capital expenditures. So if trust fund B is for a capital project, its principal can be spent, and the interest is part of the project's financing. So that would make Trust fund B a Capital Projects Fund.

But wait, looking at the options, let me see the possible pairs. The options are A-J, each pairing two fund types. So looking at each option:

A: Special revenue Special revenue → Both funds are special revenue.

B: Permanent Capital projects → A is permanent, B is capital.

C: Capital projects Capital projects → Both are capital.

D: Debt service Debt service → Both are debt.

E: Permanent Permanent → Both are permanent.

F: Capital projects Permanent → A is capital, B is permanent.

G: Special revenue Permanent → A is special, B is permanent.

H: Debt service Special revenue → A is debt, B is special.

I: Permanent Special revenue → A is permanent, B is special.

J: Special revenue Debt service → A is special, B is debt.

Wait, so I need to assign each trust fund to one of these. Let me think again.

Trust fund A: Only earnings can be spent, principal is preserved. This seems like a Special Revenue Fund because it's for a specific purpose and the earnings are used. But wait, in some cases, if the principal is not to be spent but only the income, it's a Permanent Fund. No, wait, Permanent Funds allow both principal and income to be used as per the donor's restrictions. If the principal is held and only income is used, it's a Special Revenue Fund.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. In GAAP, a Permanent Fund is one where the principal is irrevocably dedicated to a specific purpose, and the income is used for that purpose. So both principal and income are restricted to that purpose. But in this case, Trust fund A's principal cannot be spent, only the earnings. So that's more like a Special Revenue Fund, where the principal is not spent, but the income is used for a specific purpose.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the principal cannot be spent, but the income can be, that's a Special Revenue Fund. The principal remains in the fund, and the income is used for the fund's purposes.

Trust fund B allows both principal and interest to be spent. That sounds like a Capital Projects Fund because it's used for specific capital expenditures where the principal is spent on the project, and the interest is part of the fund's operations.

So Trust fund A would be Special Revenue, Trust fund B would be Capital Projects.

Looking at the options, which option pairs Special Revenue for A and Capital Projects for B? Let's see the options:

Option F: Capital projects Permanent → No.

Option C: Both capital → No.

Option I: Permanent Special → No.

Wait, looking back at the options, none of them have A as Special Revenue and B as Capital Projects. Wait, looking again:

Looking at option I: Permanent Special → A is permanent, B is special.

No, that doesn't fit.

Option F: Capital projects Permanent → A is capital, B is permanent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.

If Trust fund A's principal is not spent, only the earnings, it's a Special Revenue Fund. Trust fund B's principal and interest can be spent, so it's a Capital Projects Fund.

Which option has Trust fund A as Special Revenue and B as Capital Projects? Let me check the options:

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both Special → No.

Option B: A Permanent, B Capital → Maybe.

Option E: Both Permanent → No.

Option F: A Capital, B Permanent → No.

Option G: A Special, B Permanent → No.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe Trust fund A is a Permanent Fund because the principal is kept, and only the earnings are used. Wait, no, Permanent Funds require that both principal and income are used for the same purpose, but the principal isn't spent. Or is it that in a Permanent Fund, the principal is invested, and the income is used, but the principal remains. So if Trust fund A is like that, it's a Permanent Fund.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The key is whether the principal can be used. If the principal can't be spent (only earnings), it's a Special Revenue Fund because the principal is kept, and the income is used for a specific purpose. If both can be spent, it's a Capital Projects or maybe a Special Revenue as well, depending on the purpose.

Wait, but in the case of Trust fund B, since both principal and interest can be spent, it's likely a Capital Projects Fund because it's meant for capital expenditures, like buying or building something. So the principal is used for the project, and the interest is part of the fund.

So, Trust fund A is Special Revenue, Trust fund B is Capital Projects.

Looking at the options, which one pairs A as Special Revenue and B as Capital Projects?

Looking at the options:

Option I: Permanent Special → No.

Option F: Capital projects Permanent → No.

Option G: Special revenue Permanent → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Special revenue Special revenue

B: Permanent Capital projects

C: Capital projects Capital projects

D: Debt service Debt service

E: Permanent Permanent

F: Capital projects Permanent

G: Special revenue Permanent

H: Debt service Special revenue

I: Permanent Special revenue

J: Special revenue Debt service

Wait, none of the options have A as Special and B as Capital. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe Trust fund A is a Permanent Fund because the principal is not spent, only the earnings. Trust fund B is a Capital Projects Fund because both principal and interest can be spent on capital projects.

So if that's the case, Trust fund A is Permanent and Trust fund B is Capital projects. Looking at the options, option B is Permanent for A and Capital for B. So option B would be the answer.

Wait, but I thought Trust fund A was Special Revenue. Maybe I'm mixing up the fund types.

Alternatively, perhaps Trust fund A is a Special Revenue Fund because it's for a specific revenue purpose, and the earnings are used. Trust fund B is a Capital Projects Fund because it's for capital expenditures.

But looking at the options, there's no option where A is Special and B is Capital. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about Trust fund A. If the principal is not to be spent, but the earnings can be, that's a Special Revenue Fund. Trust fund B, allowing both principal and interest to be spent, is a Capital Projects Fund.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option where A is Special and B is Capital. So perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, maybe Trust fund A is a Permanent Fund because the principal is kept, and only the earnings are used. Trust fund B is a Capital Projects Fund because both principal and interest can be spent on capital projects.

In that case, the answer would be option B: A is Permanent, B is Capital projects.

Wait, but in that case, the answer would be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the types again.

Special Revenue Funds are used when the money is set aside for specific purposes, and the principal can be spent as part of that. But in Trust fund A, the principal cannot be spent, so it's not a Special Revenue Fund. Wait, no, Special Revenue Funds can have the principal available for expenditure as part of the fund's purpose. If the principal is kept and only the earnings are used, it's more like an earnings control, which might still fall under Special Revenue.

Alternatively, maybe Trust fund A is a Special Revenue Fund because it's designated for a specific purpose, and the earnings are used. Trust fund B is a Capital Projects Fund because it's used for capital expenditures, where both principal and interest can be spent.

But again, looking at the options, I don't see that pairing. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe Trust fund A is a Permanent Fund because the principal is not spent, and only the earnings are used. Trust fund B is a Capital Projects Fund.

So the answer would be option B: A is Permanent, B is Capital projects.

Alternatively, perhaps Trust fund A is a Special Revenue Fund, and Trust fund B is a Special Revenue Fund as well, but that doesn't make sense because B allows the principal to be spent.

Wait, another angle: Trust fund A is a Special Revenue Fund because it's for a specific purpose, and only the earnings are used. Trust fund B is a Capital Projects Fund because it's for capital expenditures, using both principal and interest.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is option I: A is Permanent, B is Special revenue. No, that doesn't fit because B allows the principal to be spent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall the types:

- General Fund: For general purposes, most flexible.

- Special Revenue Funds: For specific purposes, with restrictions on how the money is spent, but the principal can be spent as part of the fund's purpose.

- Capital Projects Funds: For financing capital assets, principal is spent on the project, and interest is part of the fund.

- Debt Service Funds: For paying off debt, often used for principal and interest payments.

- Permanent Funds: Principal is kept, and only the income is used, typically for endowments.

So, Trust fund A: Only earnings can be spent → sounds like a Permanent Fund because the principal is kept, and only the income is used.

Trust fund B: Both principal and interest can be spent → sounds like a Capital Projects Fund because it's used for capital expenditures.

Therefore, the answer would be option B: Trust fund A is Permanent, Trust fund B is Capital projects.
</think>

The city of Cobb has two trust funds: Trust fund A, where only the earnings can be expended, and Trust fund B, where both the principal and interest can be expended. 

- **Trust fund A**: Since only the earnings can be spent and the principal is preserved, this aligns with the characteristics of a **Permanent Fund**. In a Permanent Fund, the principal is irrevocably dedicated to a specific purpose, and only the income is used for that purpose.

- **Trust fund B**: As both the principal and interest can be expended, this fits the definition of a **Capital Projects Fund**. This fund is used for financing capital assets, where the principal is spent on the project, and the interest is part of the fund's operations.

Given these categorizations, the correct pairing is **Permanent for Trust fund A and Capital projects for Trust fund B**.

Answer: B
