Okay, so I have this statistics problem about softballs' radii, and I need to find several measures: range, variance, standard deviation, mean deviation about the median, and coefficient of variation. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, the data given is 2.03, 1.98, 2.24, 2.17, and 2.08 inches. There are five values, so it's a small dataset. Let me list them in order to make it easier. Arranged from smallest to largest, it would be: 1.98, 2.03, 2.08, 2.17, 2.24.

Starting with the range. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. So, max is 2.24, min is 1.98. Subtracting them: 2.24 - 1.98 = 0.26 inches. That's the range. Looking at the options, I can cross out any that don't have a range of 0.26. So, options C, I, and J have lower ranges (0.20, 0.21, 0.25). So they can be eliminated. Now, the remaining options are A, B, D, E, F, G, H.

Next, let's find the mean to help with variance and standard deviation. The mean (average) is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. Sum them up:

1.98 + 2.03 = 4.01
4.01 + 2.08 = 6.09
6.09 + 2.17 = 8.26
8.26 + 2.24 = 10.50

So the total is 10.50. There are 5 values, so mean = 10.50 / 5 = 2.10 inches.

Now, variance. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. So I need to calculate each (value - mean), square it, then average those squares.

Calculations:

1.98: (1.98 - 2.10) = -0.12 → squared is 0.0144
2.03: (2.03 - 2.10) = -0.07 → squared is 0.0049
2.08: (2.08 - 2.10) = -0.02 → squared is 0.0004
2.17: (2.17 - 2.10) = 0.07 → squared is 0.0049
2.24: (2.24 - 2.10) = 0.14 → squared is 0.0196

Adding these squared differences: 0.0144 + 0.0049 = 0.0193; +0.0004 = 0.0197; +0.0049 = 0.0246; +0.0196 = 0.0442.

Since the data is a sample (I think, as it's different brands, not the entire population), variance is sum of squared differences divided by (n-1). So n=5, so n-1=4. So variance = 0.0442 / 4 = 0.01105. Wait, but let me check the options. Option A's variance is 0.0105, B is 0.00884, D is 0.009, E is 0.0095, F is 0.012, G is 0.0065, H is 0.011, I is 0.007, J is 0.008. Hmm, my calculation gave approximately 0.01105, which is close to option H's 0.011. But wait, maybe it's the population variance? If it's population variance, we divide by n=5, so 0.0442 /5 = 0.00884. That's exactly option B's variance. So variance is 0.00884 if it's population variance, which makes sense here because we're dealing with all the given data points as the population, not a sample. So that would make the variance 0.00884, which is option B. But wait, I thought variance for population is calculated with n, not n-1. Yes, so that's correct. So variance is 0.00884, which points to option B.

Standard deviation is the square root of variance. So sqrt(0.00884) is approximately 0.094. Let me check: 0.094 squared is 0.008836, which is very close to 0.00884. So standard deviation is 0.094, which matches option B.

Next, mean deviation about the median. First, find the median. Since there are five values, the median is the third value, which is 2.08.

Mean deviation is the average of the absolute differences from the median.

Calculations:

1.98: |1.98 - 2.08| = 0.10
2.03: |2.03 - 2.08| = 0.05
2.08: |2.08 - 2.08| = 0.00
2.17: |2.17 - 2.08| = 0.09
2.24: |2.24 - 2.08| = 0.16

Sum these: 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15; +0.00 = 0.15; +0.09 = 0.24; +0.16 = 0.40.

Average is 0.40 /5 = 0.08. So mean deviation is 0.08, which matches option B.

Finally, coefficient of variation (CV) is the standard deviation divided by the mean, expressed as a percentage. So CV = (0.094 / 2.10) * 100.

Calculating that: 0.094 / 2.10 ≈ 0.04476. Multiply by 100 gives ≈4.476%. So the coefficient of variation is approximately 0.04476, which is about 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places. Looking at the options, option B has CV 0.045. That fits.

So all the values in option B match the calculations: range 0.26, variance 0.00884, standard deviation 0.094, mean deviation 0.08, CV 0.045. So the correct answer should be B.
