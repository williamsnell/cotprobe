Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which kind of retributivism Nathanson supports. I remember that retributivism is a theory in ethics, particularly in criminal justice, where the idea is that the punishment should be proportionate to the crime. But the question is about Nathanson's specific stance, so I need to think about his contributions to this theory.

First, I should recall what the different types of retributivism are. The options provided are A through J, and I need to match them. Let's list them again: proportional, equality, retaliatory, punitive, compensatory, absolute, restorative, corrective, preventive, and consequential.

I think retributivism generally falls under the umbrella of retributive justice, which emphasizes that offenders deserve punishment proportionate to their wrongdoing. Now, Nathanson is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly on retributivism. I remember that he distinguishes between different forms of retributivism.

Proportional retributivism (option A) is the idea that the punishment should be proportional to the crime. That's the classic retributive view, often associated with the phrase "an eye for an eye." Equality retributivism (option B) might refer to treating everyone equally, but I'm not sure how that fits. Retaliatory (C) sounds similar to retributive, but maybe it's more about the act of retaliation rather than the proportionate punishment.

Punitive (D) refers to the idea of inflicting punishment, which is a broader concept. Compensatory (E) is about making amends, which might relate more to restorative justice. Absolute retributivism (F) could mean that punishment is deserved regardless of the outcome, perhaps in a more rigid sense. Restorative justice (G) focuses on repairing the harm done, which is different from traditional retributive approaches. Corrective (H) might be about reforming the offender. Preventive (I) is about preventing future crimes, more of a utilitarian approach. Consequential (J) is outcome-based, which is more utilitarian.

I think Nathanson supports a specific form called "equality retributivism." From what I remember, he argues that the justification for punishment is that it's deserved, and he emphasizes equality in the application of punishment. He might believe that the punishment should be equal in some sense, perhaps in terms of the moral desert rather than proportionality. So, he might support equality retributivism, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Proportional retributivism is the more common form, where the punishment is proportionate. Nathanson, though, might have a different take. I think he might argue that the focus should be on the equality aspect, ensuring that everyone is treated the same in terms of punishment, not necessarily that the punishment matches the crime exactly. So, he supports equality retributivism, which is option B.

The answer is B: equality. Nathanson supports equality retributivism, which emphasizes that punishment should be based on the equality of treating everyone similarly in terms of their moral desert, rather than strict proportionality.

Answer: B
