Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about ring theory, specifically dealing with subrings and integral domains. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question presents two statements:

Statement 1: The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.
Statement 2: Every field is an integral domain.

And then there are several options to choose from, labeled A to J. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false and then pick the correct option.

Let me tackle each statement one by one.

Starting with Statement 1: "The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring."

Hmm, I remember that a subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring under the same operations. But wait, rings don't necessarily have to have a unity element. Oh, right, there are rings without unity. However, when people talk about subrings, especially in certain contexts like in algebra, sometimes the subring is required to have the same unity as the larger ring. But is that always the case?

Wait, no. I think the key here is whether the subring is unital, meaning it has a multiplicative identity. If the ring has a unity, does every subring have to have that same unity? Or can a subring have a different unity?

I recall that in some cases, a subring can have its own unity which is different from the ring's unity. For example, consider the ring of integers Z. If we take a subring like 2Z (the even integers), does 2Z have a unity? Well, 2Z under addition is a group, but under multiplication, it's not even a semigroup because multiplying two even integers gives an even integer, but 2Z doesn't contain 1, which is the multiplicative identity in Z. So 2Z isn't a ring with unity in this case.

Wait, but I'm trying to think of a subring that does have its own unity different from the ring's. Let me think. Suppose we have a ring R with unity 1, and a subring S that contains an element e such that e*e = e and for every s in S, e*s = s*e = s. If e is not equal to 1, can that happen?

I think so. For instance, in the ring R = Z x Z (the product ring), the subring S = Z x {0} has unity (1,0), which is different from the unity (1,1) of R. Wait, no, because in R, the multiplication is component-wise. So (1,0) multiplied by (a,b) would be (a,0), which is the same as just taking the first component. But wait, is (1,0) a unity for S? Let me check. For S, which is Z x {0}, multiplying (1,0) by any element (a,0) in S gives (a,0), which is correct. So yes, S has its own unity (1,0), which is different from R's unity (1,1). So in this case, the subring S has a different unity than R.

Therefore, Statement 1 is false because a subring can have a different unity than the ring it's in. So Statement 1 is False.

Moving on to Statement 2: "Every field is an integral domain."

I know that an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. A field is a commutative ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. So let's see.

If a ring is a field, then it definitely has no zero divisors because in a field, the only way for a product to be zero is if one of the elements is zero. If you have two non-zero elements a and b in a field, then a*b can't be zero because both have inverses, so you can multiply both sides by a^{-1} and b^{-1} to get 1, which would imply the product is non-zero.

Therefore, every field is indeed an integral domain. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not missing any nuances. For example, in some contexts, rings don't have to be commutative, but fields are always commutative. So when we say "integral domain," in some definitions, they require commutativity, but others don't. Wait, no, the standard definition of an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors. Because if it's not commutative, it's called a domain but not an integral domain. So a field is commutative, so it's an integral domain.

Yes, so Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Suppose I have a field F. Then F is a commutative ring with unity, and every non-zero element has an inverse. So yes, no zero divisors, so it's an integral domain. So yes, Statement 2 is definitely True.

So putting it together:

Statement 1: False

Statement 2: True

Looking at the options, the answer should be option C: False, True.

The unity of a subring does not necessarily have to be the same as the unity of the ring, as shown by examples like the subring Z x {0} in the ring Z x Z, which has a different unity. Every field is an integral domain because fields are commutative rings with unity and no zero divisors.

Answer: C
