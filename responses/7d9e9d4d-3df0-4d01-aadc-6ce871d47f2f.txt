Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the inverse of a group element in Z_7. The group element is given as a matrix: ((3,5), (4,6)). I'm supposed to find M[0][1], which is the element in the first row and second column of the inverse matrix M. The options are from A to J, each giving a number, some even with their equivalents in Z_7.

First, I need to remember how to find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. The formula for the inverse of a matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is (1/determinant) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]], right? But wait, since we're working modulo 7, everything has to be done in Z_7, which means all operations are modulo 7.

So, the determinant of the given matrix is calculated as (3*6) - (5*4). Let me compute that: 3*6 is 18, and 5*4 is 20. So 18 - 20 is -2. But in Z_7, -2 is equivalent to 5 because 7-2=5. So the determinant is 5 in Z_7.

Next, I need the inverse of the determinant modulo 7. That means I'm looking for a number x such that 5x ≡ 1 mod 7. Let me think: 5*3 is 15, which mod 7 is 1. So x is 3. Therefore, the inverse of the determinant is 3.

Now, using the inverse formula. The inverse matrix M is (det inverse) multiplied by [[d, -b], [-c, a]]. So plugging in the values:

Original matrix is:
[3, 5]
[4, 6]

So, d is 6, -b is -5, -c is -4, and a is 3.

But wait, in Z_7, negative numbers can be converted to positive by adding 7. So -5 mod 7 is 2, because 7-5=2. Similarly, -4 mod 7 is 3, because 7-4=3.

So the matrix without the det inverse is:
[6, 2]
[3, 3]

Now, multiply each element by the det inverse, which is 3.

So:
First row: 6*3 and 2*3.
Second row: 3*3 and 3*3.

Calculating each:
6*3 = 18 → 18 mod 7 is 4 (since 7*2=14, 18-14=4).
2*3 = 6 → 6 mod 7 is 6.
3*3 = 9 → 9 mod 7 is 2.
3*3 = 9 → same as above, 2.

So the inverse matrix M is:
[4, 6]
[2, 2]

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, I think I messed up the multiplication. Let me recalculate each element step by step.

Starting again, the matrix after applying the determinant inverse (which is 3) to each element:

First element, [0][0]: 6 * 3 = 18 mod7 → 18-14=4 → 4.

[0][1]: 2 *3 =6 → 6.

[1][0]:3 *3=9 → 9-7=2 → 2.

[1][1]:3 *3=9 → 2.

So the inverse matrix is:
[4, 6]
[2, 2]

So M[0][1] is 6.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 6. So is that the answer? But wait, I should double-check because sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I might make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the inverse formula. Wait, the inverse formula is (1/det) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]]. So that's correct.

Wait, let me recheck the determinant calculation. (3*6) is 18, (5*4) is 20. 18-20= -2. Mod7, that's 5, correct.

Inverse of 5 mod7 is 3, because 5*3=15≡1 mod7. Correct.

So the matrix before scaling is [[6, -5], [-4, 3]]. In Z7, -5 is 2, -4 is 3. So the unscaled inverse matrix is [[6,2],[3,3]].

Scaling each element by 3:

6*3=18 mod7: 18-14=4 →4
2*3=6 →6
3*3=9 mod7=2
3*3=9 mod7=2

So the scaled matrix is [[4,6],[2,2]]. So M[0][1] is 6, which is option J.

Wait, but the options include J:6, so that's the answer. But wait, let me check if the determinant is correct because sometimes I get confused with signs.

Wait, the determinant is ad - bc, which is 3*6 -5*4= 18-20= -2. Mod7, that's 5 because 7-2=5. Correct.

So yes, the inverse matrix should be [[4,6],[2,2]], so M[0][1] is 6. So the answer is J.

To find the inverse of the matrix \( M = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 \\ 4 & 6 \end{pmatrix} \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), we first compute the determinant. The determinant is \( (3 \times 6) - (5 \times 4) = 18 - 20 = -2 \). In \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), \(-2 \equiv 5\). The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3 because \( 5 \times 3 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \).

Using the inverse formula for a 2x2 matrix, the inverse is \( \frac{1}{\text{det}} \times \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix} \). Substituting the values, we get:

\[
M^{-1} = 3 \times \begin{pmatrix} 6 & -5 \\ -4 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \mod 7
\]

Converting negatives to positives in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), we have \(-5 \equiv 2\) and \(-4 \equiv 3\). Thus, the matrix becomes:

\[
M^{-1} = 3 \times \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 2 \\ 3 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \mod 7
\]

Multiplying each element by 3:

\[
M^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 2 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \mod 7
\]

The element \( M[0][1] \) is 6. Therefore, the answer is:

J
