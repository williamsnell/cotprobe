Question:

Two inertial systems S and S' have a common x-axis and parallel y-axis, and S' moves with a speed of 0.6c relative to S in the direction of the x-axis. An observer in S sees a rocket moving with a speed of 0.1c in the positive y-direction. What is the speed and direction of the rocket as seen by an observer in the S'-system?

Options:

A: 0.2c in the positive y-direction and 0.6c in the negative x-direction resulting from vector addition
B: 0.605c in a direction making an angle of 7°36' with the negative direction of the x-axis
C: 0.7c in a direction making an angle of 8° with the negative direction of the x-axis
D: 0.5c in a direction making an angle of 15° with the positive direction of the y-axis
E: 0.1c in the positive y-direction with no change in velocity due to the relative movement of S'
F: 0.6c in a direction making an angle of 10° with the negative direction of the x-axis
G: 0.7c in a direction making an angle of 20° with the positive direction of the y-axis
H: 0.68c in a direction making an angle of 11° with the positive direction of the x-axis

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about inertial frames and the rocket's velocity. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with velocities in different inertial frames, especially when they're moving relative to each other, I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, right, because classical addition doesn't work here when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

So the setup is that we have two frames, S and S'. They share the same x-axis and their y-axes are parallel. S' is moving at 0.6c relative to S along the x-axis. An observer in S sees the rocket moving at 0.1c in the positive y-direction. I need to find what the velocity is in S'.

Wait, okay, the velocity addition formula. I think it's u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²) when the motion is along the same axis. But in this case, the rocket's velocity in S is along y, and S' is moving along x. So maybe the components are treated differently. Oh right, the velocity in y shouldn't be affected by the motion along x in the same way. But wait, no, actually, I think the formula for perpendicular directions is different. Let me try to recall.

The general formula for velocity transformation between two frames is:

u'_x = (u_x - v) / (1 - (v u_x)/c²)
u'_y = u_y / gamma (1 - (v u_x)/c²)
u'_z = u_z / gamma (1 - (v u_x)/c²)

Wait, or is it that when the relative motion is along x, the y and z components transform differently. Let me double-check. Oh yes, in the y-direction, the formula is u'_y = u_y / (gamma (1 - (v u_x)/c² )).

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The velocity transformation equations for perpendicular directions. Since S' is moving at velocity v along the x-axis relative to S, any component of u along x (u_x) will be affected, while the y and z components (if any) will be scaled by 1/(gamma (1 - (v u_x)/c² )).

In this problem, the rocket's velocity in S is entirely along y: u = (0, 0.1c, 0). So u_x is zero. So the formulas simplify.

So for u'_y: since u_x is zero, the denominator becomes 1 - 0 = 1, so u'_y = u_y / gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, but v is 0.6c here. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So u'_y = 0.1c / 1.25 = 0.08c.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean the y-component in S' is smaller. But what about the x-component? Since in S, the rocket's velocity is purely in y, any x-component in S' would come from S' moving relative to S. So I should check if there's an x-component in S' due to the relative motion.

Wait, wait. The velocity addition is a bit tricky. Because from S, the rocket's velocity is (0, 0.1c, 0). So in S', which is moving at 0.6c along the x-axis relative to S, the velocity components should be calculated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe using the Lorentz velocity transformations correctly. The correct transformation for the y-component is u'_y = u_y / (gamma (1 - (v u_x)/c² )). Since u_x is zero, it's u'_y = u_y / gamma.

So u'_y = (0.1c) / 1.25 = 0.08c. So the y-component in S' is 0.08c.

But wait, am I forgetting something about the x-component? Because S' is moving at 0.6c in the x-direction relative to S, so in S', the rocket's x-component might not be zero. Wait no, because in S, the rocket is moving purely in y. So from S's perspective, the rocket's x is stationary in S's x. But in S', their frame is moving in x at 0.6c relative to S. So what's the x-component of the rocket's velocity in S'?

Wait, no, the rocket's velocity in S is (0, 0.1c, 0). So from S's perspective, the rocket isn't moving in x. So in S', the rocket's velocity in x would be u'_x = (u_x - v) / (1 - (u_x v)/c² ). Since u_x is zero, this becomes (0 - 0.6c)/(1 - 0) = -0.6c. So u'_x is -0.6c.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if u_x is zero, then u'_x would just be -v, which is -0.6c. So the rocket's velocity in S' would be (-0.6c, 0.08c, 0). Wait, but that's a vector in the x-y plane. So the speed would be the magnitude of this vector. Let's calculate that.

The speed is sqrt( (-0.6c)^2 + (0.08c)^2 ) = sqrt(0.36c² + 0.0064c²) = sqrt(0.3664 c²) = sqrt(0.3664) * c.

Calculating sqrt(0.3664). Let's see: 0.6^2 is 0.36, 0.605^2 is 0.605 * 0.605. Let me compute 0.605 * 0.605: 0.6*0.6 is 0.36, 0.6*0.005 is 0.003, doubled (since it's (a+b)^2), so 0.36 + 2*(0.6*0.005) + (0.005)^2 = 0.36 + 0.006 + 0.000025 = 0.366025. Wait, but sqrt(0.3664) is a bit higher than 0.605, because 0.605^2 is about 0.366025, which is a bit less than 0.3664. So maybe it's approximately 0.6052 or something. So the speed is approximately 0.605c.

Now, what's the direction? The velocity vector has components (-0.6c, 0.08c). So the angle theta relative to the negative x-axis would be tan(theta) = (0.08c)/(0.6c) )= 0.08/0.6 = 0.1333... So theta is arctan(0.1333) ≈ 7.59 degrees. Wait, that's close to 7 degrees and 36 minutes (since 0.59 degrees is about 35.4 minutes, so roughly 7°35', which is 7°36' when rounded). So the direction is making an angle of about 7°36' with the negative x-axis.

Looking at the options, option B says 0.605c in a direction making an angle of 7°36' with the negative x-axis. That matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the velocity of a rocket as observed in two inertial frames, S and S', where S' moves at 0.6c relative to S along the x-axis. The rocket's velocity in S is 0.1c in the positive y-direction. Using the relativistic velocity transformation equations, the components of the rocket's velocity in S' are calculated.

1. **Transformation of the y-component**:  
   The y-component in S' is given by \( u'_y = \frac{u_y}{\gamma} \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.6c \), \( \gamma = 1.25 \).  
   Substituting \( u_y = 0.1c \), we find \( u'_y = \frac{0.1c}{1.25} = 0.08c \).

2. **Transformation of the x-component**:  
   Since the rocket's velocity in S has no x-component (\( u_x = 0 \)), the x-component in S' is \( u'_x = -v = -0.6c \).

3. **Magnitude of the velocity**:  
   The magnitude of the velocity in S' is \( \sqrt{(-0.6c)^2 + (0.08c)^2} = \sqrt{0.3664c^2} \approx 0.605c \).

4. **Direction of the velocity**:  
   The angle \( \theta \) with respect to the negative x-axis is \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{0.08c}{0.6c} = 0.1333 \), giving \( \theta \approx 7^\circ 36' \).

Thus, the rocket's velocity in S' is approximately \( 0.605c \) at an angle of \( 7^\circ 36' \) with the negative x-axis.
