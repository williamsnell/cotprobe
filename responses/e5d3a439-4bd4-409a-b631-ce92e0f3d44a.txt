Okay, so I need to evaluate f(t) given that the Laplace transform F(s) is (2s² + 13s + 17) divided by (s + 1)(s + 3). Hmm, I remember that to find f(t), I have to perform an inverse Laplace transform on F(s). 

First, I think I should simplify F(s) by expressing it as partial fractions. That usually makes it easier to find the inverse transform. So let me set up the partial fractions decomposition.

The denominator is (s + 1)(s + 3), so F(s) can be written as A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 3), where A and B are constants I need to find. 

So, I'll write:

(2s² + 13s + 17) / [(s + 1)(s + 3)] = A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 3)

To find A and B, I can multiply both sides by (s + 1)(s + 3) to eliminate the denominators:

2s² + 13s + 17 = A(s + 3) + B(s + 1)

Expanding the right side:

A*s + 3A + B*s + B = (A + B)s + (3A + B)

So now, I can equate the coefficients of like terms from both sides.

On the left side, the coefficient of s² is 2, s is 13, and the constant term is 17.

Wait, but on the right side, after expansion, I only have a first-degree polynomial in s. That suggests I might have made a mistake because the left side is a second-degree polynomial. Oh wait, no— the left side after expanding would actually be a second-degree polynomial, but when I equate, maybe I should have considered that I multiplied both sides by (s+1)(s+3), which is a second-degree denominator. Let me re-express this correctly.

Wait, no. Actually, when I have F(s) = (2s² +13s +17)/[(s+1)(s+3)] and I write it as A/(s+1) + B/(s+3), then when I multiply both sides by (s+1)(s+3), I get 2s² +13s +17 = A(s+3) + B(s+1). That's correct.

So, grouping terms:

Left side: 2s² +13s +17.

Right side: (A + B)s + (3A + B). 

Wait, but that's only a first-degree equation. So how does that match the second-degree on the left? That can't be right. Oh, I see the problem now. The initial approach is incorrect because the numerator's degree is equal to the denominator's degree. I should perform polynomial division first.

Wait, the numerator is 2s² +13s +17 and the denominator is (s+1)(s+3) which is s² +4s +3. So, the numerator and denominator are both second-degree. So, the first step is to perform polynomial division.

Let me divide 2s² +13s +17 by s² +4s +3.

How many times does s² +4s +3 go into 2s² +13s +17? 

The leading term is 2s² divided by s², which is 2. So, the first term is 2. Multiply the denominator by 2: 2*(s²+4s+3)=2s² +8s +6. Subtract this from the numerator:

(2s² +13s +17) - (2s² +8s +6) = (0s²) +5s +11.

So now, the division gives 2 + (5s +11)/(s² +4s +3). 

Wait, but I'm supposed to express F(s) as a proper fraction, so I think I should have F(s) = 2 + (5s + 11)/[(s+1)(s+3)].

Now, I can perform partial fractions on (5s +11)/[(s+1)(s+3)].

Let me set (5s +11) = A(s+3) + B(s+1). 

Expanding: 5s +11 = (A + B)s + (3A + B)

So, equating coefficients:

For s: 5 = A + B.

For constants: 11 = 3A + B.

Now, I can solve these equations. Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

(3A + B) - (A + B) = 11 -5 → 2A =6 → A=3.

Substituting A=3 into the first equation: 3 + B =5 → B=2.

So, the partial fractions decomposition is:

F(s) = 2 + [3/(s+1) + 2/(s+3)].

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term.

The inverse Laplace of 2 is 2δ(t) because the Laplace transform of the Dirac delta function δ(t) is 1, so 2*1 = 2, which corresponds to 2δ(t).

Next, the inverse Laplace of 3/(s+1) is 3e^{-t}u(t), since L{e^{-at}u(t)} = 1/(s+a).

Similarly, the inverse Laplace of 2/(s+3) is 2e^{-3t}u(t).

So putting it all together:

f(t) = 2δ(t) + [3e^{-t} + 2e^{-3t}]u(t).

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 2δ(t) + (3e^{-t} + e^{-3t})u(t) → The coefficients don't match, as B is 2.

Option B: 2δ(t) + (3e^{-t} + 2e^{-3t})u(t) → This matches.

Option C: 3δ(t) + ... → No, our delta term is 2δ(t).

Option D: 2 + ... → No, we have delta function, not a constant.

Wait, but wait, in the initial step, I had F(s) = 2 + (5s +11)/[(s+1)(s+3)], which upon inverse transform gives 2δ(t) plus the other terms, because 2 is the coefficient of 1 (as 1 is the Laplace transform of δ(t)). So the 2 is 2δ(t), not 2u(t) or a constant.

Looking back at the options, option B is exactly what I derived. So the correct answer is option B.

To find \( f(t) \) given \( F(s) = \frac{2s^2 + 13s + 17}{(s + 1)(s + 3)} \), we first perform polynomial division since the numerator and denominator are both second-degree polynomials. Dividing \( 2s^2 + 13s + 17 \) by \( (s + 1)(s + 3) = s^2 + 4s + 3 \) yields:

\[
F(s) = 2 + \frac{5s + 11}{(s + 1)(s + 3)}
\]

Next, we decompose \( \frac{5s + 11}{(s + 1)(s + 3)} \) into partial fractions:

\[
\frac{5s + 11}{(s + 1)(s + 3)} = \frac{A}{s + 1} + \frac{B}{s + 3}
\]

Solving for \( A \) and \( B \), we find \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 2 \). Thus:

\[
F(s) = 2 + \frac{3}{s + 1} + \frac{2}{s + 3}
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform of each term:

- The inverse Laplace of \( 2 \) is \( 2\delta(t) \).
- The inverse Laplace of \( \frac{3}{s + 1} \) is \( 3e^{-t}u(t) \).
- The inverse Laplace of \( \frac{2}{s + 3} \) is \( 2e^{-3t}u(t) \).

Combining these, we get:

\[
f(t) = 2\delta(t) + (3e^{-t} + 2e^{-3t})u(t)
\]

This matches **Option B**.
