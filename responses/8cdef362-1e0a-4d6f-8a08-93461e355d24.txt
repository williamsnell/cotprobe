Okay, so I have this question about the first names of Lewis and Clark, the early American explorers. I remember that Lewis and Clark are famous for their expedition, often called the Corps of Discovery, which explored the western part of the United States. But I'm not exactly sure about their first names. Let me think through this.

First, I know that the two main leaders of the expedition were Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Wait, no, that might not be right. I think one of them was Meriwether, but I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down.

I recall that Meriwether Lewis was the younger of the two and was actually the one who organized the expedition. He was from Virginia, I think, and he was friends with President Jefferson, who commissioned the journey. Then there's William Clark, who was older and had more experience as an explorer. He was known for his maps and leadership skills.

So, putting it together, the first names would be Meriwether and William. Now, looking at the options given, I need to find the choice that matches these first names.

Option H says Meriwether and William. That seems to fit. Let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option A: Martin and Walter – No, doesn't sound right.
Option B: Matthew and Charles – Not matching.
Option C: Mitchell and Warren – No.
Option D: Michael and Christopher – No.
Option E: Meredith and George – No.
Option F: Marcus and Wilson – No.
Option G: Cabot and Joseph – No.
Option H: Meriwether and William – Yes, this is correct.
Option I: Morgan and Mason – No.
Option J: Miles and Wesley – No.

So, the correct answer should be H: Meriwether and William.
