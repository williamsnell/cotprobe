Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the average frictional force that's causing the cycle and rider to stop. Let's see, the problem states that the combined weight is 186 pounds. They're moving at 10 miles per hour on a level road, and when the rider stops pedaling, they come to a stop after traveling 200 yards. I need to find the average frictional force.

Hmm, I remember that when a force acts on an object, it can cause acceleration or deceleration. In this case, the frictional force is opposing the motion, so it's a decelerating force. I think I should use Newton's second law here, which is F = ma, where F is the force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.

Wait, but the units are in pounds and miles per hour, and the distance is in yards. I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Maybe I should convert everything to SI units, like meters and kilograms, and seconds.

First, let's convert the weight to mass. Weight in pounds is equal to mass in slugs (since in the imperial system, weight W = m * g, where g is 32 ft/s²). So mass m = W/g. So m = 186 lb / 32 ft/s². Let me calculate that. 186 divided by 32 is approximately 5.8125 slugs.

Next, the initial velocity is 10 mi/hr. I need to convert that to feet per second because the acceleration will likely be in ft/s². There are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour. So 10 mi/hr is (10 * 5280)/3600 ft/s. Let me compute that: 10 * 5280 = 52,800. Divided by 3600, that's around 14.6667 ft/s.

The distance traveled before stopping is 200 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, 200 yards is 600 feet.

Now, I can use the kinematic equation to find the acceleration. The equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, distance, and acceleration is v² = u² + 2as. Here, the final velocity v is 0 because it comes to a stop. So, 0 = u² + 2as. Rearranging, a = -u²/(2s).

Plugging in the numbers: u is 14.6667 ft/s, s is 600 ft. So a = -(14.6667)^2 / (2 * 600). Let's compute (14.6667)^2. 14.6667 squared is approximately 215.111. So a = -215.111 / 1200. That gives a = approximately -0.17926 ft/s². The negative sign indicates deceleration.

Now, using F = ma. Mass m is 5.8125 slugs. So F = 5.8125 * (-0.17926) ≈ -1.045 pounds. Wait, that's close to -1.0 lb, which is option E. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions. Let me go through them again.

Initial velocity: 10 mi/hr to ft/s. 10 * 5280 = 52800 ft per hour. Divided by 3600 seconds, so 52800/3600 = 14.666... ft/s. That's correct.

Distance: 200 yards = 600 feet. Correct.

Calculating acceleration: v² = u² + 2as → 0 = (14.6667)^2 + 2*a*600 → a = -(14.6667)^2/(2*600). Let's compute 14.6667 squared: 14.6667 *14.6667. Well, 14.6667 is 44/3. So (44/3)^2 is 1936/9 ≈ 215.111. So 215.111 divided by (2*600)=1200. So 215.111 / 1200 ≈ 0.17926 ft/s². So acceleration is -0.17926 ft/s².

Mass m is 186 lb / 32 ft/s² = 5.8125 slugs. So F = m*a = 5.8125 * (-0.17926) ≈ -1.045 lb. That's approximately -1.0 lb. So the answer should be E: -1.0 lb.

Wait, but looking back at the options, E is -1.0 lb, but I'm getting -1.045 lb. Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently.

Alternatively, maybe using work and energy. The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy. So Work = Friction force * distance = ΔKE.

Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So Friction force * distance = (1/2)mv².

Wait, but in this approach, since work is done against friction, the work will be negative, which would equal the loss of kinetic energy.

So rearranging, Friction force = (1/2 mv²) / distance.

But wait, in imperial units, force is in pounds, which is a unit of force, but in this case, since we're dealing with work, which is in foot-pounds, we need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, let's try that approach again.

Kinetic energy KE = (1/2) m v². Work done W = F * d, but since F is in pounds and d in feet, W is in foot-pounds. Setting W = KE.

So F * d = (1/2) m v².

Solving for F: F = ( (1/2) m v² ) / d.

But m is in slugs, and in imperial units, m in slugs, v in ft/s, so the units would be:

( (1/2) * slug * (ft/s)^2 ) / ft = (1/2) * slug * ft/s², which is equal to pounds because slug*ft/s² = lb.

So that's correct.

So m is 5.8125 slugs, v is 14.6667 ft/s, d is 600 ft.

So F = (0.5 * 5.8125 * (14.6667)^2 ) / 600.

Calculating numerator: 0.5 *5.8125 = 2.90625. (14.6667)^2 is ≈215.111.

2.90625 * 215.111 ≈ let's compute 2.9 * 215 = about 623.5. More accurately: 2.90625 * 215.111.

Wait, 215.111 * 2.90625. Let's do this step by step.

215.111 * 2 = 430.222
215.111 * 0.9 = 193.5999
215.111 * 0.00625 = approx 1.34444

Adding all together: 430.222 + 193.5999 = 623.8219 + 1.34444 ≈ 625.1663.

So numerator is ≈625.1663. Divided by 600: 625.1663 /600 ≈1.04194 lb.

Wait, that's approximately 1.04 lb. But since the friction is opposing the motion, the force is negative. So F ≈ -1.04 lb. Looking at the options, E is -1.0 lb, which is the closest. So the answer should be E: -1.0 lb.

The average frictional force can be determined using the work-energy principle. The work done by friction equals the change in kinetic energy. Converting units appropriately and solving yields the frictional force as approximately -1.0 lb.
