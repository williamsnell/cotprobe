Okay, so I need to compute the mean molecular speed of hydrogen gas (H₂) in m/s. Hmm, I remember that the mean speed of gas molecules is related to the temperature and the molar mass. Oh right, the formula involves the root mean square speed. Let me think about the formula.

I think the root mean square speed (v_rms) is given by the equation v = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass. But wait, what units are we using here? R is usually 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is the same as m²/(kg·s²) because joules are kg·m²/s².

Wait, but I'm not given the temperature. Oh wait, the question doesn't specify a temperature, so maybe I'm supposed to assume room temperature, like 25°C or 298 K? I think that's a common assumption in such problems if no temperature is given.

Hydrogen has a molar mass of about 2 g/mol because each H atom is 1 g/mol, and H₂ is two atoms. So M = 2 g/mol. But I need to convert that to kg/mol for the units to work out. So M = 0.002 kg/mol.

Plugging into the formula: v = sqrt(3 * R * T / M). Let's compute each part.

R is 8.314, T is 298 K, M is 0.002 kg/mol.

So 3*R*T = 3 * 8.314 * 298. Let me calculate that.

First, 8.314 * 298. Let's see, 8 * 300 is 2400, but more accurately: 8.314 * 300 is 2494.2, but since it's 298, which is 300 - 2, so 8.314 * 298 = 8.314*(300-2) = 2494.2 - 16.628 = 2477.572.

Multiply by 3: 3 * 2477.572 = 7432.716.

Now divide by M, which is 0.002 kg/mol. 7432.716 / 0.002 = 3,716,358.

Take the square root of that. Let me think, sqrt(3,716,358) is approximately what?

Well, sqrt(3.716358e6) = sqrt(3.716358) * 1e3. sqrt(3.716358) is about 1.928, so 1.928e3 or 1928 m/s.

Wait, but I'm getting around 1928 m/s. Looking at the options, option I is 1900.0 and J is 2000.0. Hmm, 1928 is closer to 1900 than 2000, so maybe the answer is I: 1900.0.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I used the correct formula. Oh wait, the mean molecular speed... Wait, the root mean square speed is the most common one, but sometimes people refer to the average speed, which is a bit different. The average speed is given by v_avg = sqrt(8RT/(πM)). So maybe I should use that instead.

Let me compute that. v_avg = sqrt(8RT/(πM)).

So 8RT = 8 * 8.314 * 298. Let me compute that. 8 * 8.314 is 66.512. Multiply by 298: 66.512 * 298. Let's see, 66 * 300 is 19,800, but more accurately: 66.512 * 298 = ?

Well, 66.512 * 300 = 19,953.6. Subtract 66.512 * 2 = 133.024, so 19,953.6 - 133.024 = 19,820.576.

Divide by π: 19,820.576 / π ≈ 19,820.576 / 3.1416 ≈ 6309.9.

Take the square root: sqrt(6309.9) ≈ 79.437 m/s? Wait, that can't be right because that's way too low. Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait a minute, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Wait, 8RT is 8 * 8.314 * 298. Let me compute that correctly.

8 * 8.314 = 66.512. Multiply by 298: 66.512 * 298.

Let me break it down: 66.512 * 300 = 19,953.6. But since it's 298, subtract 66.512 * 2 = 133.024. So 19,953.6 - 133.024 = 19,820.576.

Then divide by π: 19,820.576 / 3.1416 ≈ let's calculate that.

3.1416 * 6300 ≈ 19,800, so approximately 6300. So sqrt(6300) is about 79.37 m/s. That's way too low. But wait, that can't be right because the rms speed was about 1928 m/s, which is much higher. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, perhaps I confused the formulas. Oh wait, the root mean square speed is sqrt(3RT/M), and the average speed is sqrt(8RT/(πM)). So let's recalculate the average speed correctly.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is 298 K, M is 0.002 kg/mol.

So 8RT = 8 * 8.314 * 298 = let me compute that again.

8 * 8.314 = 66.512. 66.512 * 298 = 66.512 * (300 - 2) = 66.512*300 = 19,953.6 minus 66.512*2=133.024, which gives 19,953.6 - 133.024 = 19,820.576.

Then 8RT = 19,820.576 J/mol.

Now, 8RT/(πM) = 19,820.576 / (3.1416 * 0.002) = 19,820.576 / 0.0062832 ≈ let me compute that.

19,820.576 / 0.0062832 ≈ Let me see: 0.0062832 * 3,150,000 = approx 19,800,000, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.0062832 is about 6.2832e-3. So 19,820.576 / 6.2832e-3 = 19,820.576 / 0.0062832 ≈ 3,152,000.

Wait, that's a huge number. Taking the square root: sqrt(3,152,000) ≈ 1,775 m/s.

Wait, that's more reasonable. So the average speed is approximately 1775 m/s, which would round to 1750 m/s. Looking at the options, option A is 1750.0 and option I is 1900.0.

Wait, but I thought the rms speed was around 1928 m/s, which is higher than the average speed. So if the question is about the mean molecular speed, which formula applies? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says "mean molecular speed v in the light gas hydrogen (H2)." The term "mean" could refer to the average speed (v_avg) or the root mean square speed (v_rms). I might have to clarify which one is being asked.

In some contexts, the mean speed refers to the average speed, but sometimes people use rms speed as the "mean" because it's more commonly used. Let me check the formulas again.

v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M) ≈ sqrt(3*8.314*298 / 0.002) = as I did earlier, which came out to about 1928 m/s.

v_avg = sqrt(8RT/(πM)) ≈ sqrt(3,152,000) ≈ 1775 m/s.

So the options include 1750 (A) and 1900 (I). If the question is about the average speed, then 1775 would be closer to 1750 (option A). If it's about rms, it's closer to 1900 (option I).

Wait, but the question says "mean molecular speed," which is a bit ambiguous. However, in kinetic theory, the mean speed is often considered as the average speed, which is v_avg. So I'd think it's around 1775 m/s, so option A:1750.0.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting answers based on which formula I use. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations.

Let me recompute v_avg:

v_avg = sqrt(8RT/(πM))

R=8.314, T=298, M=0.002 kg/mol.

Compute numerator: 8 * 8.314 * 298.

8*8.314 = 66.512.

66.512 * 298 = let's compute accurately.

298 = 300 - 2.

66.512 * 300 = 19,953.6.

66.512 * 2 = 133.024.

So 19,953.6 - 133.024 = 19,820.576.

Now, 8RT = 19,820.576 J/mol.

Divide by πM: π=3.1416, M=0.002 kg/mol.

π*M = 0.0062832 kg/mol.

So 8RT/(πM) = 19,820.576 / 0.0062832 ≈ 19,820.576 / 0.0062832.

Let me compute that: 19,820.576 ÷ 0.0062832.

Well, 0.0062832 * 3,150,000 ≈ 19,800,000 (since 3,150,000 * 0.0062832 ≈ 19,800,000). Wait, but 19,820.576 is 19,820.576, so 19,820.576 / 0.0062832 ≈ 3,152,000 (since 0.0062832 * 3,152,000 ≈ 19,820.576).

So sqrt(3,152,000) is sqrt(3.152e6) = sqrt(3.152)*1e3. sqrt(3.152) is about 1.775, so 1775 m/s.

So that's v_avg. So the answer would be approximately 1775 m/s, which rounds to 1750 m/s (option A).

Alternatively, if using v_rms, which is sqrt(3RT/M) = sqrt(3*8.314*298/0.002).

Compute 3*8.314=24.942.

24.942 *298 = let's compute that: 24.942 * 300 =7482.6, minus 24.942*2=49.884 → 7482.6 -49.884=7432.716.

Divide by M=0.002: 7432.716 / 0.002 = 3,716,358.

sqrt(3,716,358) ≈ 1928 m/s.

So if the question is about rms, the answer would be around 1928 m/s, which is closest to option I:1900.0.

But the question says "mean molecular speed," which is a bit ambiguous. However, in physics, the term "mean speed" typically refers to the average speed (v_avg), while "rms speed" is another measure. So if the question is asking for the mean, it's probably v_avg, which is 1775 m/s, so option A:1750.0.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Some sources might consider mean speed as the most probable speed, which is another value. The most probable speed (v_p) is given by sqrt(2RT/M). Let's compute that.

v_p = sqrt(2RT/M) = sqrt(2*8.314*298 /0.002).

Compute 2*8.314=16.628.

16.628 *298= let's calculate:

16.628 * 300 =4988.4, minus 16.628*2=33.256 → 4988.4-33.256=4955.144.

Divide by 0.002:4955.144 /0.002=2,477,572.

sqrt(2,477,572)= approx 1574 m/s. That would round to 1500 m/s (option B), but that's not one of the higher options. So I'm more confident that the answer is either A (1750) or I (1900), depending on which formula is used.

Wait, but I think the mean speed in kinetic theory is usually the average speed, so I'll go with v_avg=1775 m/s, which is close to option A:1750.0 m/s.
</think>

To compute the mean molecular speed of hydrogen gas (H₂), we use the formula for the average speed:

\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{8RT}{\pi M}}
\]

Where:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) (gas constant),
- \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \) (assumed room temperature),
- \( M = 0.002 \, \text{kg/mol} \) (molar mass of H₂).

1. Compute \( 8RT \):
   \[
   8RT = 8 \times 8.314 \times 298 = 19,820.576 \, \text{J/mol}.
   \]

2. Divide by \( \pi M \):
   \[
   \frac{8RT}{\pi M} = \frac{19,820.576}{3.1416 \times 0.002} = 3,152,000.
   \]

3. Take the square root:
   \[
   v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{3,152,000} \approx 1,775 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

This value rounds to 1,750 m/s, corresponding to option **A**. If the question refers to the root mean square (rms) speed, the calculation yields approximately 1,928 m/s, closer to option **I**. However, since the term "mean molecular speed" typically refers to the average speed, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: A**
