Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the temperature change of 1 mole of a diatomic gas when given the heat (q) and work (w) values. 

Hmm, I remember that in thermodynamics, the first law is ΔU = q + w. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the formula is ΔU equals q plus work done on the system. But wait, sometimes work is considered negative when it's done by the system. Let me make sure I get the signs right. 

The problem states that q is 65 J and w is 210 J. Wait, but in the formula, work done by the system is considered negative. So if the system is doing work, w is negative. But here, the w is given as 210 J. I need to clarify whether it's work done on or by the system. The problem just says w = 210 J. Usually, in physics, work done by the system is negative, so I think here w is positive 210 J, meaning work is done on the system. Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. 

Wait, in the formula ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. If the system does work, w is negative. So if the piston is expanding, the gas is doing work on the surroundings, so w would be negative. But the problem says w=210 J, which is positive. So that suggests that work is done on the system, which would mean the piston is compressing the gas, adding energy. 

So ΔU is q + w. So q is 65 J, and w is 210 J. So ΔU = 65 + 210 = 275 J. So the change in internal energy is 275 J. 

Now, for an ideal diatomic gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume Cv is (5/2)R, because diatomic gases have more degrees of freedom. Wait, no, wait. For diatomic gases, at constant volume, Cv is (5/2)R. At constant pressure, Cp is (7/2)R. But wait, I'm not sure if the process is constant volume or not. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's a piston, perhaps it's at constant pressure. Or maybe it's isothermal? No, wait, the question is about the temperature change, so maybe it's not isothermal. 

Wait, but in any case, the formula for ΔU in terms of temperature change is ΔU = n*Cv*ΔT. Since it's 1 mole, n=1. So ΔU = (5/2 R) * ΔT. 

I know R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So substituting, 275 J = (5/2)*8.314 * ΔT. Let me calculate that. 

5/2 of 8.314 is (5 * 8.314)/2 = (41.57)/2 = 20.785 J/K. 

So 275 = 20.785 * ΔT → ΔT = 275 / 20.785 ≈ let's see, 275 ÷ 20.785. Let me calculate that. 

20.785 times 13 is 270.205. Because 20 *13=260, 0.785*13≈10.205, so total around 270.205. Then 275 is 4.795 more. So 4.795 ÷ 20.785 ≈ 0.23. So total is about 13.23 K. Wait, but let me check with a calculator. 

Alternatively, 275 divided by 20.785: 

20.785 × 13 = 270.205 → 275 - 270.205 = 4.795. 

So 4.795 / 20.785 ≈ 0.231. So total ΔT ≈ 13.231 K. So about 13.23 K. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 13.5 K, which is close. So the temperature increases by about 13.5 K. 

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I get the sign right? Because if the system is doing work, then w is negative. But in this problem, w is given as 210 J. So if the gas is doing work, w would be negative. But if the work is done on the system, w is positive. So in this case, since w is positive 210 J, that means work is done on the system, so internal energy increases. Also, q is positive 65 J, so heat is added to the system. So ΔU is positive, leading to an increase in temperature. 

Wait, but wait another thing. The formula for work in thermodynamics can sometimes be written as w = -PΔV. So when the system expands, ΔV is positive, so w is negative (work done by the system). But in this problem, w is given as positive 210 J, so perhaps it's done on the system, meaning the system is being compressed, so work is done on it, increasing internal energy. 

So all in all, the temperature change would be positive, around 13.5 K. So the correct answer should be option C: 13.5 K. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because 275 J is the ΔU, and for a diatomic gas, Cv is (5/2)R. So 5/2 * 8.314 is indeed 20.785 J/K. So 275 / 20.785 is approximately 13.23 K, which is close to 13.5 K. So the option C is the right choice.

The temperature change of a diatomic gas can be calculated using the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = q + w. Given q = 65 J and w = 210 J, the change in internal energy is ΔU = 65 J + 210 J = 275 J. For a diatomic gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume is Cv = (5/2)R, where R = 8.314 J/mol·K. Substituting, Cv = (5/2) * 8.314 ≈ 20.785 J/K. Using ΔU = nCvΔT (n = 1), ΔT = ΔU / Cv = 275 J / 20.785 J/K ≈ 13.23 K. The closest option is 13.5 K, corresponding to option C.
