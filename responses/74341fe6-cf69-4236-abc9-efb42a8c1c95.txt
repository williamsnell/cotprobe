Question:

Options:

A: 1 × 10^-6 M
B: 4 × 10-^13 M
C: 8 × 10^-10 M
D: 3 × 10^-8 M
E: 6 × 10^-4 M
F: 1 × 10-^5 M
G: 5 × 10^-7 M
H: 2 × 10^-9 M
I: 4 × 10-^8 M
J: 1 × 10-^8 M

Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum concentration of Br- ions required to precipitate AgBr from a solution where the Ag+ concentration is 1e-5 M. The Ksp for AgBr is given as 4e-13. Hmm, I remember that Ksp is the solubility product, which is the product of the concentrations of the ions each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients in the dissolution equation.

The dissolution reaction for AgBr is AgBr(s) ⇌ Ag+ (aq) + Br- (aq). So the Ksp expression would be Ksp = [Ag+][Br-].

I need to find the minimum [Br-] that will cause precipitation. That would be when the product [Ag+][Br-] equals the Ksp. So I can rearrange the Ksp expression to solve for [Br-].

Given that [Ag+] is 1e-5 M, I plug that into the equation. So [Br-] = Ksp / [Ag+].

Calculating that: 4e-13 divided by 1e-5. Let me do the division. 4e-13 divided by 1e-5 is the same as 4e-13 * 1e5, which is 4e-8. So [Br-] should be 4e-8 M.

Wait, but let me double-check. Ksp is 4e-13, and Ag+ is 1e-5. Dividing 4e-13 by 1e-5 gives 4e-8. That makes sense because when the product exceeds Ksp, precipitation occurs, so the minimum concentration is exactly when it equals Ksp.

Looking at the options, option I is 4e-8 M. So the answer should be I.

The minimum concentration of Br⁻ ions required to precipitate AgBr is calculated using the Ksp expression. Rearranging Ksp = [Ag+][Br⁻], we find [Br⁻] = Ksp / [Ag+]. Substituting the given values, [Br⁻] = 4 × 10⁻¹³ / 1 × 10⁻⁵ = 4 × 10⁻⁸ M.
