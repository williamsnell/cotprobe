Okay, so I have this problem where I need to use Poiseuille's Law to calculate the rate of flow in a small human artery. Let me think through this step by step. I remember that Poiseuille's Law relates the flow rate to various factors like pressure, radius, length, and viscosity. 

The formula, if I recall correctly, is Q = (π * P * R^4) / (8 * η * L). Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. Oh right, P is the pressure difference, R is the radius, η is the viscosity, and L is the length of the tube. So yeah, that's the formula I need to use.

Let me jot down the given values to make sure I don't mix them up. The viscosity η is 0.027. Hmm, the units aren't specified, but usually, in these contexts, it's in poise, which is dyne·s/cm². The radius R is 0.008 cm. The length I is 2 cm, and the pressure P is 4000 dynes/cm². 

Wait, pressure P is given as 4000 dynes/cm². I think in Poiseuille's Law, P is the pressure gradient, which is the pressure difference per unit length. So the units should be in dynes/cm² per cm, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, I think P here is the total pressure difference across the length L. So maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, no, actually, Poiseuille's Law uses the pressure difference ΔP over the length L. So in the formula, it's ΔP over L, but sometimes the formula is written with ΔP as the total pressure difference. Wait, no, the formula as I wrote it earlier is Q = (π * ΔP * R^4) / (8 * η * L), so ΔP is the pressure difference across the length L. So in this case, the given P is 4000 dynes/cm², which I think is the pressure difference across the artery. So that should be used as ΔP in the formula.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

η = 0.027 (unit-wise, if it's in poise, that's dyne·s/cm²)
R = 0.008 cm
L = 2 cm
P = 4000 dynes/cm²

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, R^4. R is 0.008 cm, so 0.008^4. Let me compute that.

0.008^2 is 0.000064, then squared again: 0.000064^2 = 0.000000004096. So R^4 is 4.096e-9 cm^4.

Now, multiply by π: π * 4.096e-9 ≈ 3.1416 * 4.096e-9 ≈ 1.288e-8.

Next, multiply by P, which is 4000. So 1.288e-8 * 4000 = 5.152e-5. 

Then, the denominator is 8 * η * L. η is 0.027, L is 2 cm. So 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 8 * 0.054 = 0.432.

So now, Q = (5.152e-5) / 0.432 ≈ 1.1926e-5 cm³/s.

Wait, that's 1.1926e-5. Let me convert that to 10^-4 terms. 1e-5 is 0.1e-4, so 1.1926e-5 is 0.11926e-4, which is approximately 0.1193 * 10^-4 cm³/s. Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is 1.19 ×10^-4, which is about ten times larger than what I just calculated. Did I make a mistake in the units or calculations?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations step by step.

Compute R^4 correctly: 0.008 cm is 8e-3 cm. So (8e-3)^4 = (8^4) * (1e-3)^4 = 4096 * 1e-12 = 4.096e-9 cm^4. That's correct.

Multiply by π: 4.096e-9 * π ≈ 1.288e-8.

Multiply by P=4000: 1.288e-8 * 4000 = 5.152e-5.

Denominator: 8 * η * L = 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 8 * 0.054 = 0.432. Correct.

So Q = 5.152e-5 / 0.432 ≈ 1.1926e-5 cm³/s.

Wait, 1e-5 is 0.1e-4, so 1.1926e-5 is 0.11926e-4, or 0.1193 ×10^-4 cm³/s. But that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, D is 1.19 ×10^-4, which is ten times larger than what I got. Hmm. Perhaps I messed up a unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the pressure units. Let me think again. Poiseuille's Law uses pressure in units that are compatible with the other terms. Let me confirm the units for each term.

Viscosity η is in poise, which is dyne·s/cm². Pressure P is given in dynes/cm², and L is in cm, R is in cm.

Wait, the formula is Q = (π * ΔP * R^4) / (8 * η * L). So ΔP is in dynes/cm², η is in poise (dyne·s/cm²), R is in cm, L in cm.

So when I plug in the numbers, let me ensure the units are correct. Let's go through each term:

ΔP = 4000 dynes/cm²
R = 0.008 cm
η = 0.027 poise = 0.027 dyne·s/cm²
L = 2 cm

So putting them into the formula:

Q = [π * (4000) * (0.008)^4 ] / [8 * 0.027 * 2]

I think I did it right earlier, but perhaps I missed a decimal point. Let me recalculate.

Compute numerator: π * 4000 * (0.008)^4.

0.008^4: 0.008 * 0.008 = 6.4e-5, then squared: (6.4e-5)^2 = 4.096e-9.

So π * 4000 * 4.096e-9 = π * 4000 * 4.096e-9.

Compute 4000 * 4.096e-9 = 1.6384e-5.

Multiply by π: 1.6384e-5 * π ≈ 5.15e-5.

Denominator: 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 8 * 0.054 = 0.432.

So Q = 5.15e-5 / 0.432 ≈ 1.19e-5 cm³/s.

Again, that's 1.19e-5, which is 0.119e-4, but the options don't have that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.19 ×10^-4, which is 1.19e-4. My calculation gives 1.19e-5, which is ten times smaller. Hmm, perhaps I missed a zero in the pressure value. Let me check the given P. The question says P=4000 dynes/cm². Oh wait, maybe I misread that as 4000 instead of 40,000? No, it's 4000.

Wait, perhaps R was given in meters? No, the question says R=0.008 cm. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should have converted R from cm to meters? No, because the formula uses cm, so R is 0.008 cm, which is 8e-3 cm, correct.

Wait, maybe the formula I used is incorrect. Let me recheck Poiseuille's Law. The formula is indeed Q = (π ΔP R^4)/(8 η L). So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the numerator and denominator.

Compute R^4 again: 0.008^4 = (8e-3)^4 = 4096e-12 = 4.096e-9 cm^4.

Multiply by π: 4.096e-9 * π ≈ 1.288e-8.

Multiply by P=4000: 1.288e-8 * 4000 = 5.152e-5.

Denominator: 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 8 * 0.054 = 0.432.

So Q = 5.152e-5 / 0.432 ≈ 1.192e-5 cm³/s, which is 0.1192e-4 cm³/s.

Wait, but option D is 1.19e-4, which is exactly 10 times larger. Did I make a mistake in the exponent? Let me check: 5.152e-5 divided by 0.432 is approximately 1.192e-5, which is 1.192e-5 = 0.00001192 cm³/s, which is 1.192 ×10^-5, which is 0.1192 ×10^-4.

Looking at the options, none of them have 0.1192e-4. The closest is option G: 0.89e-4, but that's not close. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R^4? Let me double-check.

0.008^4: 0.008 * 0.008 = 0.000064, then 0.000064 * 0.000064 = 0.000000004096, which is 4.096e-9. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the pressure is given as 4000 dynes/cm², but I should have considered it as 4000 dynes per cm² per second or something else. No, the pressure in Poiseuille's Law is the pressure difference across the length, so units are dynes/cm².

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q = (ΔP * π R^4) / (8 η L). So perhaps I should have used the pressure in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe I should have converted the radius into meters. Wait, no, the formula works in any consistent unit system as long as all terms are in the same units.

Wait, let me try the calculation again, perhaps I made an arithmetic error.

Compute numerator: π * 4000 * (0.008)^4.

(0.008)^4 = 0.008 * 0.008 = 0.000064; 0.000064 * 0.000064 = 0.000000004096.

So 4000 * 0.000000004096 = 4000 * 4.096e-9 = 1.6384e-5.

Multiply by π: 1.6384e-5 * π ≈ 5.15e-5.

Denominator: 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 8 * 0.054 = 0.432.

So Q = 5.15e-5 / 0.432 ≈ 1.19e-5 cm³/s.

Wait, that's consistent. So perhaps the correct answer is 1.19e-5, which is 0.119e-4, but the options don't have this. The closest option is D: 1.19e-4, which is ten times larger. Did I perhaps misread the radius as 0.008 cm instead of 0.08 cm? Let me check the question again.

The question says R=0.008 cm. So that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere because of unit conversion.

Wait, another thought: maybe the pressure is given as 4000 dynes/cm², but perhaps I should have converted it to Pascals or another unit. Wait, but all units are in CGS, so it should be consistent. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used R in meters instead of cm. Let me try that.

R = 0.008 cm = 0.00008 meters.

Wait, but if I use meters, I need to adjust all units to meters, seconds, etc. Let me see.

But wait, Poiseuille's Law in SI units is Q = (π ΔP R^4)/(8 η L), where R and L are in meters, η in Pa·s, and ΔP in Pascals.

But in this case, let's try converting everything to SI units.

ΔP = 4000 dynes/cm². Since 1 dyne = 1e-5 N, and 1 cm² = 1e-4 m². So ΔP = 4000 * 1e-5 N / 1e-4 m² = 4000 * 1e-5 / 1e-4 = 4000 * 0.1 = 400 Pa.

R = 0.008 cm = 0.008e-2 m = 8e-5 m.

L = 2 cm = 2e-2 m.

η = 0.027 poise. 1 poise = 0.1 Pa·s, so 0.027 poise = 0.027 * 0.1 = 0.0027 Pa·s.

Now, compute Q = π * ΔP * R^4 / (8 η L).

Compute R^4: (8e-5)^4 = (8^4) * (1e-5)^4 = 4096 * 1e-20 = 4.096e-17 m^4.

Multiply by ΔP=400: 4.096e-17 * 400 = 1.6384e-14.

Multiply by π: 1.6384e-14 * π ≈ 5.15e-14.

Denominator: 8 * η * L = 8 * 0.0027 * 2e-2.

Compute 8 * 0.0027 = 0.0216; 0.0216 * 2e-2 = 0.000432.

So Q = 5.15e-14 / 0.000432 ≈ 1.19e-10 m³/s.

Wait, 1 m³ = 1e6 liters, but wait, we need cm³. 1 m³ = 1e6 liters = 1e6 * 1e3 cm³ = 1e9 cm³. So 1.19e-10 m³/s = 1.19e-10 * 1e9 cm³/s = 1.19e-1 cm³/s, which is 0.119 cm³/s. That can't be right because the options are in 10^-4 cm³/s.

Wait, that's way off. I must have made a mistake in the SI unit conversion. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 dyne = 1e-5 N, correct. 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So ΔP in Pascals is (4000 dynes/cm²) * (1e-5 N/dyne) / (1e-4 m²/cm²) = 4000 * 1e-5 / 1e-4 N/m² = 4000 * 0.1 N/m² = 400 Pa. That's correct.

R = 0.008 cm = 0.008e-2 m = 8e-5 m.

L = 2 cm = 2e-2 m.

η = 0.027 poise = 0.027 * 0.1 Pa·s = 0.0027 Pa·s.

So numerator: π * 400 * (8e-5)^4.

(8e-5)^4 = 4096e-20 = 4.096e-17.

400 * 4.096e-17 = 1.6384e-14.

Multiply by π: ~5.15e-14.

Denominator: 8 * 0.0027 * 2e-2 = 8 * 0.0027 = 0.0216; 0.0216 * 2e-2 = 0.000432.

So Q = 5.15e-14 / 0.000432 ≈ 1.192e-10 m³/s.

Convert m³/s to cm³/s: 1 m³ = 1e6 liters = 1e6 * 1e3 cm³ = 1e9 cm³. So 1.192e-10 m³/s = 1.192e-10 * 1e9 cm³/s = 1.192e-1 cm³/s = 0.1192 cm³/s, which is 1.192e-1, which is way larger than the options provided, which are all in 1e-4 cm³/s.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the SI conversion approach. Let me try going back to CGS units.

In CGS units, Poiseuille's Law is:

Q = (π ΔP R^4) / (8 η L)

Where:
ΔP is in dynes/cm²,
R and L in cm,
η in poise (dyne·s/cm²),
and Q will be in cm³/s.

So let's compute using CGS units.

Given:
ΔP = 4000 dynes/cm²,
R = 0.008 cm,
L = 2 cm,
η = 0.027 poise.

Compute R^4: (0.008)^4 = 4.096e-9 cm^4.

Multiply by π: π * 4.096e-9 ≈ 1.288e-8.

Multiply by ΔP=4000: 1.288e-8 * 4000 = 5.152e-5.

Denominator: 8 * η * L = 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 8 * 0.054 = 0.432.

So Q = 5.152e-5 / 0.432 ≈ 1.192e-5 cm³/s.

Which is 1.192e-5 cm³/s = 0.1192e-4 cm³/s, or 1.192 ×10^-5 cm³/s. But looking at the options, none of them match this. The closest is option D: 1.19 ×10^-4, which is ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me confirm Poiseuille's Law again. Oh wait! I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. I've seen it sometimes written as Q = (π ΔP R^4) / (8 η L), but I'm not sure if I missed any unit conversions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pressure is given as 4000 dynes/cm², but perhaps it's actually 4000 dynes per cm² per second (dyne/(cm²·s)) which would change things. But no, I think that's not the case here. The problem states P=4000 dynes/cm², which is a static pressure difference.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula uses the radius in meters or another unit. But no, in CGS units, it's in cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recheck:

8 * η * L = 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 8 * 0.054 = 0.432. Correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. My calculation gives 1.192e-5 cm³/s, which is 0.1192e-4. But the options don't have this. The only option close is D: 1.19e-4, which is 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the radius was given as 0.08 cm instead of 0.008 cm? Let me see what happens if R is 0.08 cm.

R = 0.08 cm.

R^4 = (0.08)^4 = (0.08)^2 = 0.0064, squared again: 0.00004096 cm^4.

Multiply by π: 0.00004096 * π ≈ 0.0001288.

Multiply by ΔP=4000: 0.0001288 *4000 ≈ 0.5152.

Denominator: 8 * 0.027 *2 = 0.432.

Q = 0.5152 / 0.432 ≈ 1.192 cm³/s. That's way too big, but if I missed a decimal in R, maybe that's the issue.

But the question states R=0.008 cm, so that's 8e-3 cm, not 0.08 cm. So I think I'm correct in using 0.008 cm.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is 4000 dynes per cm² per second, which would make it 4000 dyne/(cm²·s), but in that case, the units would be different. Let me see.

If P is 4000 dyne/(cm²·s), then the formula would still work, but the calculation would be different. Let me try that.

Wait, no, because Poiseuille's Law uses the pressure difference across the length, which is a static pressure, not a dynamic one. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute everything again, but this time being extra careful with exponents.

Compute R^4: (0.008)^4.

0.008 is 8e-3.

(8e-3)^4 = 8^4 * (1e-3)^4 = 4096 * 1e-12 = 4.096e-9 cm^4.

Multiply by π: 4.096e-9 * π ≈ 1.288e-8.

Multiply by ΔP=4000: 1.288e-8 *4000 = 5.152e-5.

Denominator: 8 * 0.027 * 2 = 0.432.

So Q = 5.152e-5 / 0.432 ≈ 1.192e-5 cm³/s.

Which is 1.192e-5 cm³/s = 0.1192 ×10^-4 cm³/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.19 ×10^-4, which is exactly ten times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, 1 poise is 1 dyne·s/cm². So η=0.027 poise is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R in meters. Let me try that again, but in CGS units, R is in cm, so that's fine.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Q = (π ΔP R^5)/(8 η L). No, that's not right. It's R^4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pressure is given as 4000 mmHg or something else, but the question states it's in dynes/cm², so I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the viscosity from poise to something else. No, in CGS units, η is in poise, which is compatible with the other units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division. Let me compute 5.152e-5 divided by 0.432 more accurately.

5.152e-5 / 0.432 = (5.152 / 432) * 1e-5.

5.152 / 432 ≈ 0.011926.

So 0.011926e-5 = 1.1926e-7 cm³/s.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 1.19e-5. Wait, no, 5.152e-5 / 0.432.

Wait, 5.152e-5 is 0.00005152.

0.00005152 / 0.432 ≈ 0.00011926, which is 1.1926e-4 cm³/s.

Wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake in the decimal placement earlier. Let me compute 5.152e-5 / 0.432 correctly.

5.152e-5 is 0.00005152.

Divided by 0.432: 0.00005152 / 0.432 ≈ 0.00011926.

Which is 1.1926e-4 cm³/s.

Ah! So I must have made a mistake earlier in my calculation. So Q ≈ 1.19e-4 cm³/s, which matches option D.

So the correct answer is D: 1.19 ×10^-4 cm³/s.
