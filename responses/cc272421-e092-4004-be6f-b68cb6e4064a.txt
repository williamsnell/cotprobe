Okay, so I have this question about a 30-year-old woman with mood changes. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the patient is nulliparous, meaning she hasn't had any children yet. She's been feeling anxious, hyperactive, and unable to sleep for 3-4 days before her period starts. Then, on the first day of her menses, she becomes really depressed, loses her appetite, gets irritable, and feels lethargic. She's been trying to conceive for over two years and had a tuboplasty a year ago to fix a closed fallopian tube. No psychiatric history.

So, the key points here are her cyclical mood changes related to her menstrual cycle. She's anxious and hyper before her period and then抑郁on the first day. She's been trying to get pregnant, which makes me think maybe her hormonal changes are affecting her mood, especially since she's been trying to conceive and had a tuboplasty, which is related to fertility.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which disorder fits this presentation. Let's go through each option.

A: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) – this is more about chronic, excessive worry, not necessarily tied to the menstrual cycle. She does have anxiety, but it's cyclical, so probably not GAD alone.

B: Bipolar I disorder, mixed – that's episodes of mania/hypomania and depression at the same time. Her symptoms before and during seem more cyclical and tied to her period, not a mixed episode.

C: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – this is a severe form of PMS. Symptoms include mood changes, anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, and physical symptoms that occur in the luteal phase (before menstruation) and resolve with the onset of menses. Her symptoms fit this: anxiety, hyperactivity, insomnia premenstrual, then depression and other symptoms when menses starts. This seems likely.

D: Cyclothymic personality – this is a personality disorder with fluctuating mood states, but it's chronic and not tied to the menstrual cycle. So probably not.

E: Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) – this is a chronic mild depression, not cyclical. She has periods of depression, but it's tied to her cycle, so not this.

F: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – requires exposure to trauma, which isn't mentioned here. Her symptoms don't point to that.

G: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – this is related to seasons, not the menstrual cycle. Her symptoms are monthly, so not SAD.

H: Bipolar II disorder – involves depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but again, it's not cyclical with menses. Her pattern is linked to her period.

I: Adjustment disorder with depressed mood – this is due to a specific stressor, but her symptoms are cyclical and not just a response to a stressor. Plus, she's been trying to conceive, but the symptoms occur every cycle.

J: Major depressive disorder (MDD) – she has episodes of depression, but it's tied to her menstrual cycle. MDD is more chronic and not necessarily cyclical.

Putting it all together, her symptoms align with PMDD. She has significant mood changes that occur premenstrually and resolve when her period starts. The fact that she's been trying to conceive might tie into the hormonal fluctuations affecting her mood, but the key here is the cyclical nature of her symptoms.

The patient's symptoms of anxiety, hyperactivity, and insomnia occurring 3-4 days before her menstrual cycle, followed by depression, irritability, and lethargy on the onset of menses, suggest a cyclical pattern tied to her menstrual cycle. This presentation aligns with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome characterized by significant mood and physical symptoms that emerge during the luteal phase and resolve with the onset of menses. Other options, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar Disorders, or Major Depressive Disorder, do not fit the cyclical nature of her symptoms. 

Answer: C
