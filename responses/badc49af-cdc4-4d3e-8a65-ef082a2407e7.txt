Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which urban model matches the description given in the question. The question is asking about a model where high-rent residential areas expand outward from the city center along major highways, and lower-rent areas take over sequentially. I remember from my studies that there are several urban models, each describing different patterns of urban growth and structure.

Let me go through the options one by one to see which fits best.

Option A: Star model. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with this one. I think the star model might refer to cities growing in a radial pattern, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about highways or sequential rent-based expansion.

Option B: Ribbon development model. Ribbon development usually refers to linear growth along roads or transportation routes, forming a ribbon-like shape. This might involve highways, but I'm not certain if it's about the sequential change in rent areas.

Option C: Urban realms model. I'm a bit vague on this. I think realms refer to distinct areas or regions within a city, possibly based on economic activities or other factors. Not sure if it's about rental areas expanding outward.

Option D: Sector model. The sector model, if I recall correctly, was proposed by Homer Hoyt. It suggests that cities develop in sectors or wedges extending from the center, influenced by transportation routes and land uses. High-rent areas would be along these sectors, and lower-rent areas might follow as they expand. This seems close to the question's description.

Option E: Concentric zone model. This model, by Ernest Burgess, divides the city into circular zones, each representing different land uses, moving outward from the center. The outer zones are for lower-income areas, but I don't think it specifically talks about growth along highways or sequential rent changes along those highways.

Option F: Urban sprawl model. Sprawl is more about low-density, automobile-dependent development spreading out from the city center. It's a general pattern but doesn't specifically address the sequential rental areas along highways.

Option G: Core-periphery model. This model focuses on a central core with surrounding periphery areas, but I'm not sure it ties into the highway-based expansion described in the question.

Option H: Multiple nuclei model. Proposed by Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman, this model suggests that cities have several nuclei or centers of activity, each with its own sphere of influence. It doesn't specifically address the expansion along highways based on rent.

Option I: Matrix model. I'm not too clear on this one. It might refer to a more complex, interconnected urban structure, but again, not specifically about rental areas along highways.

Option J: Central place model. This model, by Walter Christaller, explains the spatial distribution of cities based on their functions and hierarchy. It deals more with the hierarchy of cities and their service areas rather than the internal structure of a single city's growth.

Putting it all together, the sector model seems to align best with the description. Homer Hoyt's sector model emphasizes that transportation routes (like highways) facilitate the outward growth of different land uses, starting with high-rent areas close to the center and then lower-rent areas expanding outward along those sectors. So the correct answer should be D: Sector model.
