Alright, so I'm trying to figure out Clarence Darrow's belief about life's meaning. I remember that Clarence Darrow was a famous lawyer, known for his defense in high-profile cases, like the Scopes Monkey Trial. But I'm not too sure about his personal beliefs. I think he was an agnostic or maybe an atheist. 

Wait, I've heard that some of his quotes touch on life's meaning. Let me think. There's a famous quote where he says, "The purpose of life is not to be happy. The purpose of life is to seek happiness." Hmm, but that's more about seeking happiness rather than the meaning itself. Or was it about the lack of a predefined purpose?

Another thought: Darrow was a determinist, believing that human behavior is shaped by environmental and social factors rather than free will. If he thought life's outcomes were determined, that might influence his view on meaning. But how does that tie into the options given?

Looking at the options, E says life was a series of random events with no ultimate purpose. J says life was a cosmic joke without real meaning. Both seem to suggest a lack of inherent meaning or purpose. I think Darrow was critical of organized religion and might have held a skeptical view on life's meaning. 

Wait, another angle: In his writings, Darrow often discussed the futility of human struggles. He might have believed that life doesn't have an inherent meaning but is shaped by individuals. Or maybe he saw it as random and without a higher purpose. So between E and J.

J is more about it being a cosmic joke, which seems a bit harsh. E is about random events without purpose. I think E aligns better. Darrow might have viewed life as without a predefined meaning, but individuals could find their own purposes. Or perhaps he saw it as random and without ultimate purpose.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that Darrow was a pessimist. He didn't believe in a higher power or an afterlife. So his view on life's meaning would likely be that it's without inherent meaning, making E or J possible.

Given that, I'm leaning towards E: Life was a series of random events with no ultimate purpose. Or maybe J? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. E is more about the events being random without purpose, while J adds a layer of being a joke, which might be more about the absurdity of life. 

I think Darrow's view was more about the lack of inherent meaning rather than it being a joke. So E makes more sense.
