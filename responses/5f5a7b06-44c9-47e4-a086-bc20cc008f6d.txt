Question:

 In Singer's view, the question of when it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal is one

Options:

A: that is irrelevant as it is never wrong to painlessly kill an animal.
B: that is only wrong if the animal is a pet.
C: that is entirely dependent on the species of the animal.
D: that is dependent on the cultural norms of a society.
E: that is ethically unimportant.
F: that is only applicable to endangered species.
G: to which we need give no precise answer.
H: that cannot be answered, vaguely or precisely.
I: to which we need to give a precise answer.
J: that should be answered on a case-by-case basis.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this Singer question. Let me start by recalling what I know about Peter Singer's views on ethics, especially regarding animal ethics. Singer is a utilitarian, so he focuses on the consequences of actions and aims for the greatest good for the greatest number. 

The question is about when it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal. From what I remember, Singer discusses the idea that causing pain is wrong, but if the killing is painless, it's a different issue. He might consider the interests of the animal, like their right to life, but since the killing is painless, maybe it's less of an issue.

Looking at the options:

A says it's irrelevant because it's never wrong. I don't think Singer would say it's never wrong; he's more about the circumstances and consequences.

B suggests it's only wrong if the animal is a pet. That doesn't sound right because Singer's views treat all animals with interests, not just pets.

C says it's dependent on the species. I think Singer considers all animals, so the species might not be the main factor. Maybe, but not sure yet.

D is about cultural norms. Singer is more about universal principles, so I don't think he would base it on culture.

E says it's ethically unimportant. That seems off because Singer does discuss animal ethics quite a bit.

F is about endangered species. I don't think the question is specifically about that, it's more general.

G suggests we don't need a precise answer. H says it can't be answered. I think Singer would try to provide an answer, so maybe G and H are not it.

I says we need a precise answer. J says case-by-case. Singer tends to give more general principles, so maybe J is better.

Wait, Singer's argument is about the interests of the animal. If killing is painless, it doesn't cause suffering, but does it violate their right to life? He might say that if the animal isn't suffering, it's acceptable, but I'm not sure if he gives a precise answer or leaves it to case-by-case.

Another angle: Singer's "Principle of Utility" would consider the overall happiness. If killing an animal painlessly doesn't cause suffering but might affect others (like the animal's offspring), but if it's just the individual, perhaps it's acceptable. But does he say it's always wrong, or does he leave it open?

I think Singer would say that as long as the action doesn't cause unnecessary suffering, it's permissible. But the question is about when it's wrong. So if it's painless, maybe it's not wrong, but perhaps he doesn't give a precise answer because it depends on various factors like the animal's interests, the context, etc. So maybe the answer is G or J.

Wait, looking back, the question is about when it's wrong. Singer might argue that if killing the animal serves a greater good, then it's permissible. But if it's just for trivial reasons, it's wrong. However, the question is phrased as a general inquiry, so maybe he doesn't give a definitive answer but thinks it's something that needs more analysis. But I'm not sure if he'd say we need no precise answer or that it's case-by-case.

Alternatively, Singer might say that since the animal can't consent and has an interest in living, even painless killing could be wrong. But if it's for a good reason, like saving more lives, maybe it's permissible. But does he provide a precise answer or leave it open?

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is G: to which we need give no precise answer. Because Singer might argue that the question is too vague or that more context is needed to determine its wrongness, so a precise answer isn't required. Or perhaps he would say it's case-by-case, so J.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Singer's view is that the interests of the animal matter. If the killing is painless, perhaps it's permissible if it's for a good cause. But he might not give a precise answer because it depends on the situation. So the question is about when it's wrong. If you can kill painlessly, maybe it's not wrong, but if it's for a trivial reason, it is. But the question is about when it's wrong, so maybe the answer is that it depends, which would be J: case-by-case.

Alternatively, maybe Singer thinks it's not wrong at all if it's painless, making A correct, but I don't think that's the case because he respects the animal's life.

Wait, no. Singer's position is that animals have interests, so even painless killing could be wrong if it doesn't serve a greater good. But he doesn't provide a strict rule, so perhaps the answer is that we need to give a precise answer (I) or that it's case-by-case (J).

I think I'm overcomplicating. Singer's approach is more about consequences, so he might not give a definitive answer but instead consider each case. So the answer is J: that should be answered on a case-by-case basis.

The correct answer is **J**. Singer's view considers the consequences and the interests of the animal, and he would likely address the question on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances and the overall impact on well-being.
