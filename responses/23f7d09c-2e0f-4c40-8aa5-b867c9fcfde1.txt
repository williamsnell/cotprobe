Okay, so I've got this math problem here that defines a new operation called "#". It's defined for all real numbers r and s, and there are three conditions given. The question is asking me to find the value of 11 # 5. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the conditions to make sure I understand them:

1. r # 0 = r. So whenever the second operand is 0, the result is just the first operand.
2. r # s = s # r. This means the operation is commutative; the order of the operands doesn't matter.
3. (r + 1) # s = (r # s) + s + 1. This looks like a recursive formula that relates the operation when the first operand is increased by 1.

My goal is to find 11 # 5. Since 11 is larger than 5, maybe I can use the commutative property to swap them, but I'm not sure yet. Let's see how the third condition can help me build up the result.

I think the best approach is to try to find a general formula for r # s. Let's start by considering small values and see if I can spot a pattern.

Let's consider when r is 0. From condition 1, 0 # s = s # 0 = s. So that's straightforward.

Now, what about r = 1? Using condition 3, (0 + 1) # s = (0 # s) + s + 1. We know 0 # s is s, so this becomes (1 # s) = s + s + 1 = 2s + 1. Wait, so 1 # s = 2s + 1.

Let me check that again. If r=0, then (0 + 1) # s = 1 # s = (0 # s) + s + 1. Since 0 # s = s, then 1 # s = s + s + 1 = 2s + 1. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but according to condition 2, r # s = s # r, so 1 # s = s # 1. Let's compute s # 1 using condition 3 as well. Let's set r = s - 1 (but s must be >=1 to avoid negative numbers, maybe). Hmm, maybe it's better to compute s # 1 directly. Let's try s = 1: 1 # 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3. Alternatively, since 1 # 1 is the same as 1 # 1, that's consistent.

Wait, maybe I can find a general formula for r # s by induction. Let's try to see if r # s can be expressed as r*s + something.

Wait, let's try to compute a few small values to see if I can spot a pattern.

Compute 1 # 1: as above, 2*1 +1 = 3.

Compute 1 # 2: Using condition 3, (0 + 1) # 2 = (0 # 2) + 2 + 1. 0 # 2 = 2, so 1 # 2 = 2 + 2 +1 =5.

Alternatively, using commutativity, 2 # 1 = 5 as well.

Compute 2 # 2: Let's use condition 3 again. Let's express 2 as (1 + 1), so (1 + 1) # 2 = (1 # 2) + 2 + 1. We know that 1 # 2 is 5, so 2 # 2 = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.

Alternatively, using the formula I thought before, if I suppose that r # s = r*s + r + s +1, but wait, let's check:

Wait, 1 # 1 would be 1*1 +1 +1 +1=4, but that's not matching the actual value of 3. So maybe that's not the right formula. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps r # s = r*s + r + s. Let's check:

1 #1 = 1 +1 +1 =3, which matches.

1 #2= 2 +1 +2=5, which matches.

2 #2=4 +2 +2=8, which matches.

Hmm, that seems promising. Let me test another value. Let's compute 2 #3.

Using condition 3: (1 +1) #3 = (1#3) +3 +1.

Compute 1#3 using condition 3: (0+1)#3 = (0#3) +3 +1 =3 +3 +1=7.

So 2#3 =7 +3 +1=11.

Now, using my formula: 2*3 +2 +3=6 +5=11. That matches.

Similarly, 3#3: Using condition 3, (2+1)#3 = (2#3) +3 +1=11 +3 +1=15.

Using formula:3*3 +3 +3=9 +6=15. Correct.

So the formula seems to hold: r # s = r*s + r + s.

Wait, but let's check the initial condition. For r=0, 0 # s=0*s +0 +s = s, which matches condition 1.

And the operation is commutative, which matches condition 2 because r*s +r +s is the same as s*r +s +r.

Now, condition 3: (r+1)#s = (r # s) + s +1.

Let's verify this with the formula. (r+1) # s = (r+1)*s + (r+1) + s = r*s + s + r +1 + s = r*s + r + 2s +1.

On the other hand, (r # s) + s +1 = (r*s + r + s) + s +1 = r*s + r + 2s +1.

Yes, they match. So the formula holds.

Therefore, the general formula is r # s = r*s + r + s.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me compute 0 # s again. Using the formula: 0*s +0 +s =0 +0 +s =s, which matches condition 1.

So, now, with this formula, I can compute 11 #5.

Compute 11 #5 =11*5 +11 +5.

11*5=55, plus 11 is 66, plus 5 is 71. So the result is 71.

Looking at the options, H is 16, which doesn't match. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, 11*5 is 55, plus 11 is 66, plus 5 is 71. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option G is 71, so that's the correct answer.

The operation $\#$ is defined with three conditions. By analyzing these conditions, we deduced that the general formula for $r \# s$ is $r \times s + r + s$. Using this formula, we computed $11 \# 5$ as follows: $11 \times 5 + 11 + 5 = 55 + 11 + 5 = 71$. Therefore, the correct answer is G.
