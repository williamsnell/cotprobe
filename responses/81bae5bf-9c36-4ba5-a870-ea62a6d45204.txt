Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen. The reaction given is CO₂ ⇌ CO + (1/2)O₂. I need to calculate the equilibrium compositions and the extent of reaction at a specific temperature and pressure, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I should recall what I know about chemical equilibria. The problem states that the equilibrium constant K_p is 0.647 at 5301°F and 1 atm. Hmm, 5301°F is really hot, but I guess K_p is given, so I don't need to calculate it from other thermodynamic data.

The reaction is CO₂ decomposing into CO and O₂. The stoichiometry is 1 mole of CO₂ producing 1 mole of CO and half a mole of O₂. The extent of reaction, epsilon (ε), is a variable that represents how much the reaction has proceeded from the initial state to the equilibrium. 

I think I should set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to model the changes in partial pressures. Let me define the initial partial pressures. Wait, but the problem doesn't give initial concentrations. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to assume that initially, there's only CO₂, and it starts to decompose. Or perhaps the initial state is all CO₂, and the products are formed as the reaction proceeds.

Wait, maybe the initial state is pure CO₂. Let's assume that initially, we have a certain amount of CO₂, and as the reaction proceeds, some of it decomposes into CO and O₂. Let's denote the initial partial pressure of CO₂ as P_initial. But without knowing the initial amount or the total pressure, I might need to express everything in terms of the extent of reaction, epsilon.

Let me denote the initial moles as n_CO₂ = 1, and the rest as zero. Then, as the reaction proceeds, for each mole of CO₂ that reacts, it produces 1 mole of CO and 0.5 moles of O₂. So, the change would be +epsilon for CO and +0.5 epsilon for O₂, while CO₂ decreases by epsilon.

Wait, but I'm dealing with partial pressures here. Since the reaction is at constant pressure (1 atm), but the system's volume can change because gases are involved. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider mole fractions since the problem gives the equilibrium compositions as mole fractions x.

Wait, the options give x_CO₂, x_CO, and x_O₂ as the mole fractions. So, the sum of these should be 1, assuming that only these three species are present.

Let me think: the initial state is pure CO₂, so x_CO₂ = 1, and x_CO and x_O₂ are 0. Then, as the reaction proceeds, some CO₂ decomposes into CO and O₂. Let me denote the extent of reaction as epsilon (ε). 

So, the changes would be:

CO₂: initial 1, change -ε → 1 - ε
CO: initial 0, change +ε → ε
O₂: initial 0, change +0.5ε → 0.5ε

But wait, the total number of moles changes because O₂ is produced. So, the total moles at equilibrium would be (1 - ε) + ε + 0.5ε = 1 + 0.5ε.

The mole fractions are calculated as (moles of each) divided by total moles.

So:

x_CO₂ = (1 - ε) / (1 + 0.5ε)
x_CO = ε / (1 + 0.5ε)
x_O₂ = (0.5ε) / (1 + 0.5ε)

Now, the equilibrium constant K_p is given by the partial pressures. Wait, but K_p is expressed in terms of partial pressures, so I need to relate these mole fractions to partial pressures. But since the total pressure is 1 atm, the partial pressure of each gas is its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure, which is 1 atm. So, the partial pressures P are equal to x for each species.

So, K_p = (P_CO * P_O₂)^(1/2) / P_CO₂

Wait, the reaction is CO₂ ⇌ CO + ½ O₂. So, the balanced equation has 1 CO₂, 1 CO, and ½ O₂. Therefore, the K_p expression is:

K_p = (P_CO * (P_O₂)^(1/2)) / P_CO₂

Wait, no, because for the reaction aA ⇌ bB + cC, K_p = (P_B)^b (P_C)^c / (P_A)^a.

In this case, a=1, b=1, c=½. So,

K_p = (P_CO)^1 * (P_O₂)^(1/2) / (P_CO₂)^1

But since each partial pressure is the mole fraction (because total pressure is 1 atm), P = x. So,

K_p = (x_CO) * (x_O₂)^(1/2) / x_CO₂

We know K_p is 0.647. So,

0.647 = [ (ε/(1 + 0.5ε)) * ( (0.5ε/(1 + 0.5ε)) )^(1/2) ) ] / [ (1 - ε)/(1 + 0.5ε) ) ]

Simplify this equation. Let me compute each part step by step.

Let me write the equation again:

0.647 = [ (ε) * sqrt(0.5 ε) ) ] / (1 - ε)

Because the denominators in each fraction are (1 + 0.5ε), which cancels out when we take the ratio.

Wait, let me check the denominator. When I write each x as (moles)/(total moles), the denominator is (1 + 0.5ε). So, when I take the ratio of x_CO * sqrt(x_O₂) / x_CO₂, the denominators are:

x_CO = ε / (1 + 0.5ε)
x_O₂ = 0.5ε / (1 + 0.5ε)
x_CO₂ = (1 - ε)/(1 + 0.5ε)

So,

(x_CO) * sqrt(x_O₂) / x_CO₂ = [ (ε/(1+0.5ε)) * sqrt(0.5 ε/(1+0.5ε)) ] / [ (1 - ε)/(1+0.5ε) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: [ ε/(1+0.5ε) ) ] * [ sqrt(0.5 ε) / sqrt(1+0.5ε) ) ]

Denominator: (1 - ε)/(1+0.5ε)

So, the entire expression becomes:

[ ε * sqrt(0.5 ε) ) / ( (1+0.5ε) * sqrt(1+0.5ε) ) ) ] / [ (1 - ε)/(1+0.5ε) ) ]

The (1+0.5ε) terms in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator will cancel out. Let me see:

[ ε * sqrt(0.5 ε) ) / ( (1+0.5ε)^(1.5) ) ) ] * [ (1+0.5ε) / (1 - ε) ) ]

So, the (1+0.5ε) in the denominator of the first fraction cancels with the numerator of the second fraction, leaving 1/(1+0.5ε)^(0.5).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to substitute the expressions into the equation and simplify.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can make this equation easier. Let me let y = sqrt(ε). Then, ε = y².

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Let me write the equation again as:

0.647 = [ ε * sqrt(0.5 ε) ] / (1 - ε )

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

(0.647)^2 = [ ε² * (0.5 ε) ] / (1 - ε )²

So,

0.418609 = (0.5 ε³) / (1 - ε )²

Multiply both sides by (1 - ε )²:

0.418609 (1 - ε )² = 0.5 ε³

Expand (1 - ε )²:

1 - 2ε + ε²

So,

0.418609 (1 - 2ε + ε²) = 0.5 ε³

Multiply out:

0.418609 - 0.837218 ε + 0.418609 ε² = 0.5 ε³

Bring all terms to one side:

0.5 ε³ - 0.418609 ε² + 0.837218 ε - 0.418609 = 0

This is a cubic equation in ε. Solving cubic equations analytically is possible but complicated. Alternatively, I can try to approximate the solution numerically.

Let me try some values of ε between 0 and 1, since ε cannot be more than 1 (as CO₂ can't decompose more than 100%).

Let's try ε=0.3:

Left side: 0.5*(0.027) - 0.418609*(0.09) + 0.837218*(0.3) - 0.418609
= 0.0135 - 0.037675 + 0.251165 - 0.418609
= 0.0135 -0.037675= -0.024175; +0.251165= 0.22699; -0.418609= -0.191619

Which is negative. I need to find where the equation equals zero.

Try ε=0.4:

0.5*(0.064) = 0.032
-0.418609*(0.16) = -0.066977
+0.837218*(0.4)= 0.334887
-0.418609

Sum: 0.032 - 0.066977 = -0.034977; +0.334887= 0.29991; -0.418609= -0.118699

Still negative.

Try ε=0.5:

0.5*(0.125)= 0.0625
-0.418609*(0.25)= -0.104652
+0.837218*(0.5)= 0.418609
-0.418609

Sum: 0.0625 -0.104652= -0.042152; +0.418609= 0.376457; -0.418609= -0.042152

Still negative.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the K_p expression. Let me go back.

The reaction is CO₂ ⇌ CO + ½ O₂.

So, K_p = (P_CO * P_O₂^(1/2)) / P_CO₂

Each partial pressure is equal to mole fraction x because total pressure is 1 atm.

So,

K_p = [x_CO * (x_O₂)^(1/2)] / x_CO₂

Substituting the expressions in terms of ε:

x_CO = ε/(1 + 0.5ε)
x_O₂ = 0.5ε/(1 + 0.5ε)
x_CO₂ = (1 - ε)/(1 + 0.5ε)

So,

K_p = [ (ε/(1+0.5ε)) * (0.5 ε/(1+0.5ε))^(1/2) ) ] / [ (1 - ε)/(1 + 0.5ε) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ ε * sqrt(0.5 ε) ) / (1 + 0.5ε)^(1.5) ) ] * [ (1 + 0.5ε) / (1 - ε) ) ]

The (1 + 0.5ε) terms cancel:

= [ ε * sqrt(0.5 ε) ) / (1 - ε) ) ]

So,

0.647 = [ ε * sqrt(0.5 ε) ] / (1 - ε )

Let me compute this again. Let me square both sides:

0.647² = [ ε² * 0.5 ε ] / (1 - ε )²

0.418609 = (0.5 ε³) / (1 - ε )²

Multiply both sides by (1 - ε )²:

0.418609 (1 - 2ε + ε²) = 0.5 ε³

Expanding:

0.418609 - 0.837218 ε + 0.418609 ε² = 0.5 ε³

Rearranged:

0.5 ε³ - 0.418609 ε² + 0.837218 ε - 0.418609 = 0

Yes, same as before.

Trying ε=0.6:

Compute each term:

0.5*(0.216)=0.108
-0.418609*(0.36)= -0.1507
+0.837218*(0.6)= 0.50233
-0.418609

Sum: 0.108 -0.1507= -0.0427; +0.50233= 0.45963; -0.418609= 0.041021

Positive. So between ε=0.5 and 0.6, the function crosses from negative to positive.

At ε=0.55:

0.5*(0.55)^3 = 0.5*(0.166375)=0.0831875

-0.418609*(0.55)^2= -0.418609*(0.3025)= -0.1268

+0.837218*(0.55)= 0.46047

-0.418609

Sum: 0.0831875 -0.1268 = -0.0436125; +0.46047= 0.4168575; -0.418609= -0.0017515

Almost zero, slightly negative.

At ε=0.555:

Compute each term:

ε^3 = 0.555^3 ≈ 0.168
0.5 * 0.168 ≈ 0.084

-0.418609*(0.555)^2 ≈ -0.418609*(0.308) ≈ -0.1293

+0.837218 * 0.555 ≈ 0.465

-0.418609

Sum: 0.084 -0.1293= -0.0453; +0.465= 0.4197; -0.418609 ≈ 0.00109

So between 0.55 and 0.555, the function crosses zero.

Let me try ε=0.553:

ε=0.553

ε^3 ≈ 0.553^3 ≈ 0.553 * 0.553=0.3058 *0.553≈0.1693

0.5 * 0.1693 ≈0.08465

-0.418609*(0.553)^2: 0.553^2=0.3058, 0.418609 * 0.3058≈0.1282; so -0.1282

+0.837218 * 0.553≈0.837218*0.55=0.46047; 0.837218*0.003≈0.00251; total≈0.463

-0.418609

Sum: 0.08465 -0.1282= -0.04355; +0.463=0.41945; -0.418609≈0.00084

Close to zero. Maybe ε≈0.553.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the approximation that ε is small, but given that K_p is 0.647, which is not very small, maybe the extent is moderate.

Wait, but if I assume that ε is small, then 1 - ε ≈ 1, and 1 + 0.5ε ≈1. So the equation becomes:

0.647 ≈ [ ε * sqrt(0.5 ε) ] / 1

Which is 0.647 = sqrt(0.5) * ε^(3/2)

sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.7071, so:

0.647 ≈ 0.7071 * ε^(3/2)

ε^(3/2) ≈ 0.647 / 0.7071 ≈ 0.915

Raise both sides to the 2/3 power:

ε ≈ (0.915)^(2/3) ≈ ?

0.915^(1/3) is approximately 0.97, then squared gives ≈0.94. But this is a rough estimate and may not be accurate. It seems that the initial assumption that ε is small is not valid here, as the approximate ε is around 0.94, which contradicts the earlier calculation where ε was around 0.55.

Hmm, perhaps I should try using the correct cubic equation approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try substituting the given options to see which one satisfies the K_p condition.

Looking at the options, let's take each option and compute K_p to see if it equals 0.647.

Let's start with option A:

A: ε = 0.378, x_CO₂=0.127, x_CO=0.248, x_O₂=0.025

Compute K_p = (x_CO * sqrt(x_O₂)) / x_CO₂

x_CO = 0.248, x_O₂=0.025, x_CO₂=0.127

So,

K_p = (0.248 * sqrt(0.025)) / 0.127

sqrt(0.025)=0.1581

So,

(0.248 * 0.1581) / 0.127 ≈ (0.0392) / 0.127 ≈ 0.308

Which is less than 0.647. So option A is not correct.

Option B:

ε=0.278, x_CO₂=0.527, x_CO=0.148, x_O₂=0.325

K_p = (0.148 * sqrt(0.325)) / 0.527

sqrt(0.325)=0.5701

So,

(0.148 * 0.5701) ≈0.0844

Divide by 0.527: ≈0.160

Still much less than 0.647. So B is out.

Option C:

ε=0.178, x_CO₂=0.627, x_CO=0.248, x_O₂=0.125

K_p = (0.248 * sqrt(0.125)) / 0.627

sqrt(0.125)=0.3536

So,

(0.248 * 0.3536) ≈0.0877

Divide by 0.627: ≈0.140

Still too low.

Option D:

ε=0.578, x_CO₂=0.327, x_CO=0.448, x_O₂=0.225

K_p = (0.448 * sqrt(0.225)) / 0.327

sqrt(0.225)=0.4743

So,

0.448 * 0.4743 ≈0.2123

Divide by 0.327: ≈0.649

That's very close to 0.647. So D might be the correct option.

Wait, let me check the exact calculation:

0.448 * 0.4743 = ?

0.4 * 0.4743 = 0.18972

0.048 * 0.4743 ≈ 0.0227664

Total ≈ 0.2124864

Divide by 0.327:

0.2124864 / 0.327 ≈0.649, which is approximately 0.647. So D is a candidate.

Let me check other options to be thorough.

Option E:

ε=0.678, x_CO₂=0.227, x_CO=0.648, x_O₂=0.125

K_p = (0.648 * sqrt(0.125)) / 0.227

sqrt(0.125)=0.3536

0.648 * 0.3536 ≈0.2294

Divide by 0.227: ≈1.0106

Which is higher than 0.647. So E is out.

Option F:

ε=0.778, x_CO₂=0.127, x_CO=0.748, x_O₂=0.225

K_p = (0.748 * sqrt(0.225)) / 0.127

sqrt(0.225)=0.4743

0.748 * 0.4743 ≈0.3544

Divide by 0.127: ≈2.79

Way too high. So F is out.

Option G:

ε=0.678, x_CO₂=0.427, x_CO=0.548, x_O₂=0.325

K_p = (0.548 * sqrt(0.325)) / 0.427

sqrt(0.325)=0.5701

0.548 * 0.5701 ≈0.3124

Divide by 0.427: ≈0.732

Closer but still higher than 0.647. So G is out.

Option H:

ε=0.478, x_CO₂=0.227, x_CO=0.348, x_O₂=0.125

K_p = (0.348 * 0.3536) / 0.227 ≈ (0.123) / 0.227 ≈0.542

Lower than 0.647. So H is out.

Option I:

ε=0.478, x_CO₂=0.327, x_CO=0.348, x_O₂=0.225

Wait, but x_CO₂ + x_CO + x_O₂ should be 1. Let's check: 0.327 + 0.348 + 0.225 = 0.90. Hmm, that's 0.90, which is less than 1. So perhaps this option is incorrect, or maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are correct, but let me compute K_p.

K_p = (0.348 * sqrt(0.225)) / 0.327

sqrt(0.225)=0.4743

0.348 * 0.4743 ≈0.1646

Divide by 0.327: ≈0.503

Lower than 0.647. So I is out.

Option J:

ε=0.878, x_CO₂=0.027, x_CO=0.848, x_O₂=0.425

Check if sum is 1: 0.027 +0.848 +0.425=1.3, which is over 1. So this is impossible. Hence, J is invalid.

So, the only option that gave K_p ≈0.647 was option D, which gave K_p≈0.649, very close to 0.647.
</think>

The correct answer is determined by calculating the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) for each option and comparing it to the given value of 0.647. After evaluating all options, only option D yields a \( K_p \) close to 0.647, confirming it as the correct choice.

Answer: D
