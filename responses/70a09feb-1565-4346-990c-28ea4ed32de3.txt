Okay, so I have this math problem here that I'm trying to figure out. The question is asking me to write "1 and 1 over 11" as a whole or mixed number in its simplest form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what "1 and 1 over 11" means. I think this is a mixed number, right? So, 1 is the whole number part, and 1 over 11 is the fractional part. Mixed numbers are just a way to represent numbers that have both whole numbers and fractions. So, it's like 1 + (1/11).

Now, the question is asking me to convert this mixed number into a whole number or a simplified fraction. So, I need to add 1 and 1/11 together. To do that, I should convert the whole number 1 into a fraction with the same denominator as 1/11 so I can add them easily.

The denominator here is 11, so I can write 1 as 11/11. That makes sense because 11 divided by 11 is 1. So now, I have 11/11 + 1/11. Adding the numerators together gives me 12/11. 

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. 11/11 is 1, and adding 1/11 to it would make 12/11. Yes, that seems correct. So, the mixed number 1 1/11 is equal to the improper fraction 12/11.

Now, looking at the options provided, I need to find which one matches 12/11. Let me go through each option:

A: 1.1 over 11 – Hmm, that would be 1.1/11, which is a decimal fraction. I don't think that's the simplest form here.

B: 2 over 11 – That's 2/11, which is less than 1. But our result is more than 1, so this isn't right.

C: 13 over 11 – That's 13/11. Wait, did I get that right? No, because 1 is 11/11, plus 1/11 is 12/11, not 13/11. So C is incorrect.

D: 11 over 10 – That's 11/10, which is 1.1. But our result is 12/11, which is approximately 1.09, so D isn't correct.

E: 11 over 11 – That's 11/11, which is equal to 1, but we have more than 1, so E is wrong.

F: 11 over 12 – That's 11/12, which is less than 1, so not our answer.

G: 11 over 13 – That's 11/13, also less than 1, so nope.

H: 12 over 11 – Yes, that's exactly what I got earlier. So H seems to be the correct option.

I: 1 over 11 – That's 1/11, which is way too small.

J: 1.2 over 11 – That's 1.2/11, which is a decimal fraction and not the same as 12/11.

So, after going through each option, H is the correct one. It matches the improper fraction I calculated, 12/11, which is the simplest form of 1 and 1/11.

The mixed number 1 1/11 is converted to an improper fraction by adding 1 (as 11/11) to 1/11, resulting in 12/11. Among the options, H matches this fraction.

Answer: H
