Question:

On May 1 of the prior year, Baker purchased equipment with a five-year useful life for a cost of $10,000. Baker adopted the MACRS depreciation system and did not utilize any special depreciation deductions. On March 1 of the current year, Baker sold the equipment. The MACRS depreciation schedule for five-year property is listed below:

Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the MACRS method, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see... 

Alright, the facts are: Baker bought equipment on May 1 of the prior year for $10,000. The equipment has a five-year useful life. They're using MACRS depreciation and didn't take any special deductions. Then, on March 1 of the current year, Baker sold the equipment. So, I need to figure out how much depreciation they can deduct in the current year.

First, I remember that MACRS stands for Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, which is a method the IRS allows for depreciating assets. It's more accelerated than the straight-line method, so depreciation expenses are higher in the early years.

The MACRS depreciation schedule for five-year property is given. The first year is 20%, second is 32%, third is 19.2%, but wait, the question only gives the first three years. I think for five-year property, the rates are 20%, 32%, 19.2%, 11.52%, and 5.76% for the remaining years, but I'm not 100% sure. But since the question only gives up to the third year, maybe I don't need the rest for this problem.

Now, the equipment was purchased on May 1 of the prior year. So, the prior year is year one, and the current year is year two, right? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify the timeline.

If the purchase was on May 1 of the prior year, let's say that's May 1 of last year, which was 2022. Then, the current year is 2023, and March 1, 2023, is when it was sold. So, how much depreciation is allowed in 2023?

In MACRS, the depreciation is based on the half-year convention. That means if you place the asset into service partway through the year, you take half of the first year's depreciation. Similarly, if you dispose of it partway through, you take half of the depreciation for that year.

Wait, but wait. The asset was placed in service on May 1, 2022. So, 2022 is the first year, and the depreciation for 2022 would be half of the first-year rate because it's a half-year convention. Then, in 2023, the second year of depreciation, and since it was sold on March 1, 2023, which is part of 2023, so do we take the full second-year rate or half?

Wait, no. Wait, the sale happens in 2023, so the depreciation for 2023 would be based on how much of the year the asset was in service. Since it was sold on March 1, 2023, that's less than halfway through the year. So, for the second year (2023), we only take half of the second-year MACRS rate.

Wait, let me think again. The first year is 2022. The asset was placed in service on May 1, 2022. So, for 2022, you take half of the first-year rate because it's a half-year convention. So first-year depreciation is 20% * (6/12) = 10% of the cost.

Then, in 2023, the asset was sold on March 1. So, March is the third month. So, the asset was in service for two months (January and February) of 2023 before being sold. So, the time in service in 2023 is 2/12, which is 1/6 of the year. Therefore, for the second year's depreciation, we take half of the second-year rate because it's only been in service for part of the year.

Wait, no, wait. MACRS uses the half-year convention for both placing into service and disposal. So, if you dispose of an asset during the year, you take half of the depreciation for that year.

So, in 2023, the second year, the depreciation rate is 32%. But since the asset was disposed of on March 1, which is within the second year, the depreciation allowed for 2023 would be half of 32%, which is 16%.

Wait, but wait again. Let me confirm. The half-year convention applies when placing into service or disposing. So, for the first year (2022), since it was placed in service on May 1, we take half of the first-year rate. So, 20% * 0.5 = 10%, which is $1,000 of depreciation for 2022.

Then, for 2023, the second year, the asset was sold on March 1. So, for 2023, since it was sold, we take half of the second-year rate. So, 32% * 0.5 = 16% of the cost. So, 16% of $10,000 is $1,600.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Or is there another step? Let me think again. The MACRS method for depreciation is based on the half-year convention, meaning that regardless of when in the year the asset is placed into service or disposed of, you take half the rate for that year.

So, for the first year, 2022, half of 20% is 10%, so $1,000.

Then, in 2023, since the asset was sold on March 1, which is part of the second year, we take half of the second-year rate. So, 32% * 0.5 = 16%, which is $1,600.

So, the total depreciation up to the sale would be $1,000 (2022) + $1,600 (2023) = $2,600. But wait, the question is asking for the amount of depreciation deductible in the current year, which is 2023. So, it's just the $1,600 from 2023.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options given are A through J, and one of them is $1,600, which is option G.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recast the timeline.

Purchase date: May 1, prior year (2022). So, 2022 is year 1. Depreciation for 2022: 20% * 0.5 = 10% of $10k = $1k.

Then, 2023 is year 2. Depreciation for 2023 would normally be 32% of $10k = $3,200. But since the asset was sold on March 1, 2023, we take half of the second-year rate, so 32% * 0.5 = 16% of $10k = $1,600.

So, the depreciation in the current year (2023) is $1,600, which is option G.

Wait, but let me think again. I've heard that when you dispose of an asset, you can't take the full year's depreciation. Instead, you prorate based on the time in service. So, if the asset was sold on March 1, that's 2 months into the year, so 2/12 of the year. But MACRS uses the half-year convention, so regardless of the exact time, you take half the rate.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me see. The half-year convention says that if you dispose of the asset during the year, you take half of the depreciation for that year. So, for the second year, 32%, you take half, which is 16%. So, $1,600.

Alternatively, if the asset was sold on March 1, which is 2 months into the year, but under MACRS, you take half the rate regardless of the exact time. So, yes, 16% of $10k is $1,600.

So, the answer should be G: $1,600.
</think>

The correct answer is G: $1,600. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **First Year (2022):** The equipment was purchased on May 1, 2022, so depreciation for 2022 is half of the first-year MACRS rate (20%) due to the half-year convention. This amounts to 10% of $10,000, which is $1,000.

2. **Second Year (2023):** The equipment was sold on March 1, 2023. Under MACRS, if an asset is disposed of during the year, depreciation for that year is half of the applicable rate. The second-year rate is 32%, so half of that is 16% of $10,000, which is $1,600.

Therefore, the depreciation deductible in the current year (2023) is $1,600.
