Question:

In a hypothetical environment, fishes called pike-cichlids are visual predators of algae-eating fish (i.e., they locate their prey by sight). If a population of algae-eaters experiences predation pressure from pike-cichlids, which of the following should least likely be observed in the algae-eater population over the course of many generations?

Options:

A: Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young
B: Selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters
C: Selection for algae-eaters that reproduce more frequently
D: Selection for algae-eaters with smaller eyes
E: Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes
F: Selection for algae-eaters that can camouflage with algae
G: Selection for algae-eaters that feed on a different type of algae
H: Selection for nocturnal algae-eaters (active only at night)
I: Selection for algae-eaters with faster swimming speeds
J: Selection for algae-eaters that can burrow in the sand

Okay, so I have this biology question about natural selection in a population of algae-eating fish that are preyed upon by pike-cichlids. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which trait would least likely be selected for in the algae-eaters over many generations. The options are from A to J. Let's think about each one.

First, pike-cichlids are visual predators. That means they hunt by sight. So the algae-eaters would likely evolve traits that help them avoid being seen by their predators. Common anti-predator adaptations include camouflage, being faster swimmers, or changing behavior like becoming nocturnal.

Option A: Selection for larger female algae-eaters with more, larger young. Hmm, I'm not sure. Larger size might make them more visible, but maybe larger females can produce more offspring, which could be advantageous. But wait, if they're bigger, they might also be easier targets. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this isn't the least likely.

Option B: Drab coloration. That makes sense because drab colors blend in better, making it harder for predators to spot them. So this would be selected for, not the least likely.

Option C: Reproduce more frequently. If they reproduce more, they might have more offspring, but how does that help with predation? Maybe not directly, unless they're producing more offspring to compensate for higher predation losses. But I'm not sure if this is the least likely.

Option D: Smaller eyes. Wait, why would smaller eyes be beneficial? If they have smaller eyes, maybe they can't see as well, which might make them less likely to detect predators. But if they're prey, maybe better eyesight would help them spot predators earlier. Alternatively, smaller eyes might make them less noticeable. I'm not certain about this one.

Option E: Become sexually mature at smaller sizes. If they mature earlier and smaller, they might reproduce before being eaten. Smaller size could make them harder to see too. So this seems like a plausible adaptation.

Option F: Camouflage with algae. Definitely, this would help them blend in and avoid detection. So this would be selected for, not the least likely.

Option G: Feed on a different type of algae. I'm not sure how this relates to predation. Maybe if they switch to a different algae, they might have different habitat preferences or behaviors that reduce predation risk. But this seems less directly related to visual predation. Maybe this is a possibility for the least likely.

Option H: Nocturnal activity. Since pike-cichlids are visual predators, if the algae-eaters become nocturnal, they can avoid the predators who rely on sight during the day. So this would be selected for.

Option I: Faster swimming speeds. Faster swimmers can escape predators more effectively. So this makes sense as an adaptation.

Option J: Burrow in the sand. If they can burrow, they can hide from predators. That would help them avoid being seen, so this would be selected for.

Now, thinking about each option again. The question is about which is least likely to be selected. So I need to find the trait that doesn't help with avoiding predation.

Option C: Reproducing more frequently. I'm thinking that while having more offspring could help maintain population numbers despite predation, it might not directly help in avoiding being eaten. Alternatively, if they reproduce more quickly, they might have more chances to pass on their genes before being preyed upon. But I'm not sure if this is the least likely.

Option A: Larger females with more young. Larger size might make them more vulnerable, so perhaps there's selection against this. But if they're producing more offspring, it might be favored. I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: Smaller eyes. If eyes are large, they might be more noticeable to predators. So having smaller eyes could make them less visible. Alternatively, smaller eyes might reduce their ability to detect predators, which could be bad. Wait, but if they're prey, maybe they don't need as sharp vision, and smaller eyes could help them blend in better. Or perhaps the opposite: if they have better vision, they can detect predators earlier. So maybe smaller eyes aren't as advantageous. Hmm, not sure.

Option G: Different algae. If they switch to a type of algae that's in a different location or time, maybe they avoid predators. But this seems a bit indirect. Maybe their feeding choice affects their visibility. For example, if the new algae is in a darker area, they might be less visible. Alternatively, it might not have much to do with predation. So perhaps this is the least likely.

Alternatively, Option C: Reproducing more frequently. If they reproduce more, they might have more offspring, but if they're eaten quickly, maybe the population doesn't benefit. Or perhaps the selection is for traits that improve survival, not necessarily reproduction rate. So maybe selection for reproducing more is less likely.

Wait, but the question is about traits that would be least likely to be observed. So the trait that doesn't help with avoiding predation.

If I think about each option: B, F, H, I, J are all directly related to avoiding detection or escaping. A, E, and maybe C and D are about size or reproductive traits.

So the least likely would probably be something that doesn't help with predation. Option G, feeding on a different type of algae, might not directly relate to predation pressure. Unless it's about habitat choice, but it's less likely to be a direct response to predation.

Alternatively, Option C: Reproduce more frequently. Maybe if they reproduce more, they have more offspring, but if the parents are more likely to be eaten, perhaps the survival of the offspring isn't better. Alternatively, if they can reproduce quickly, they might have more chances to reproduce before being eaten.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between G and C. But the question is about visual predation. So traits related to visibility and behavior would be more selected.

Option G is about diet, which might not directly impact visibility. So I think G is the least likely to be selected for.

In a population of algae-eating fish preyed upon by visually hunting pike-cichlids, traits that help avoid detection or escape predators would be strongly selected for. Options like drab coloration (B), camouflage (F), nocturnal activity (H), faster swimming speeds (I), and burrowing (J) directly aid in avoiding predation. Similarly, traits like becoming sexually mature at smaller sizes (E) and having smaller eyes (D) might reduce visibility or improve survival, though the benefits of smaller eyes are less clear.

Reproducing more frequently (C) might help maintain population numbers but does not directly aid in avoiding predation, making it less likely to be strongly selected for. However, the least likely trait to be selected for is feeding on a different type of algae (G), as this primarily relates to diet and habitat rather than directly addressing predation pressure. Therefore, the trait least likely to be observed in the population is **G**.

Answer: G
