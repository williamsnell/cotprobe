Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my half-life concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: A sample of a radioactive material contains one million radioactive nuclei. The half-life is 20 seconds. How many nuclei remain after 10 seconds? The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm. I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of the nuclei to decay. So, every half-life period, the number of remaining nuclei is halved. But wait, in this case, the time given is 10 seconds, which is exactly half of the half-life of 20 seconds. So, does that mean only a quarter of the nuclei decay, or something else?

Wait no, let me think again. The half-life is 20 seconds, so after 20 seconds, half (which is 500,000) would remain. But we're looking at 10 seconds, which is just one half-life divided by 2. So, I think the formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N0 is the initial quantity, t is time elapsed, and T is the half-life.

So plugging in the numbers: N0 is 1,000,000, t is 10 seconds, T is 20 seconds. So t/T is 10/20 = 0.5. So the exponent is 0.5, meaning we take (1/2) raised to the 0.5 power. Wait, (1/2)^0.5 is the same as square root of 1/2, right? Because 0.5 is 1/2. So the square root of 1/2 is approximately 0.7071.

So N = 1,000,000 * 0.7071 ≈ 707,100 nuclei. Let me check the options. Option G is 707,000 nuclei, which is close. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the concepts. Another approach is to think in terms of decay constant. The formula using decay constant λ is N = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ = ln(2)/T. So λ here would be ln(2)/20. But that might complicate things more, but let me see. Let me compute λ first. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so λ ≈ 0.6931 / 20 ≈ 0.034655 per second.

Now, t is 10 seconds, so λt is 0.034655 *10 = 0.34655. So e^(-0.34655) is approximately 1/e^0.34655. Wait, since e^0.34655 is roughly e^0.35. I know that e^0.3 is about 1.3499, and e^0.35 is about 1.419. So 1 divided by 1.419 is approximately 0.705. So N ≈ 1,000,000 * 0.705 ≈ 705,000. Which again points to option G: 707,000. So that's consistent.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is G.

The number of nuclei remaining after 10 seconds is approximately 707,000, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
