Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to work through it carefully.

So, the question is about finding the degree of ionization of ammonia (NH3) in a solution with a given pH. The concentration of NH3 is 0.05 M, and the pH is 11.0. They've provided the Kb value as 1.76 × 10^-5. The options are given from A to J, and I need to select the correct one.

First, I remember that the degree of ionization (α) is the fraction of the original concentration of the weak base that has ionized. The formula for α is [BH+]/[BH], where BH is the base concentration and BH+ is the concentration of the ionized form.

But wait, I'm dealing with a base here, NH3. NH3 is a weak base, so it doesn't dissociate completely. In water, it reacts with H2O to produce NH4+ and OH- ions. The reaction is: NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-.

The Kb is given, which is the base dissociation constant. The formula for Kb is ( [NH4+][OH-] ) / [NH3]. 

Since the solution has a pH of 11.0, I can find the concentration of OH- ions. I know that pH + pOH = 14. So, pOH = 14 - 11 = 3. Therefore, [OH-] = 10^-3 M.

Wait, but in the case of a weak base, the concentration of OH- comes from the dissociation of the base itself, right? Because NH3 is a weak base, it produces OH- ions. So, the [OH-] should be equal to the concentration of NH4+ ions produced, which we can denote as 'x'. But wait, in this case, the pH is given, so the [OH-] is known, which is 1e-3 M.

Hmm, but wait, if the solution is at pH 11, that's pretty basic. For a weak base like NH3, the degree of ionization might be higher than usual because the solution is quite basic to start with. So, maybe I should consider that the [OH-] comes both from the autoionization of water and the dissociation of NH3. But wait, in very basic solutions, the NH3 dissociation would contribute significantly more OH- than water's autoionization. So, perhaps I can approximate that the [OH-] is just from NH3.

Wait, let me think again. The pH is 11, so [OH-] is 1e-3 M. Now, for NH3 in water, the dissociation produces OH- equal to x, where x is the concentration of NH4+ and OH- produced from NH3. So, if the solution's [OH-] is 1e-3, that's from NH3 dissociation, so x = 1e-3.

Wait, but wait a second. The [OH-] in solution is 1e-3, so that's the concentration of OH- from NH3. Therefore, [NH4+] is also 1e-3 M because for every mole of NH3 that dissociates, one mole of NH4+ and one mole of OH- are produced.

Now, the concentration of NH3 that has dissociated is x, which is 1e-3 M. But wait, the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.05 M. So, the degree of ionization α is x / 0.05.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and the change is x, so the concentration of NH3 that dissociates is x. So α = x / 0.05.

So, x is 1e-3, so α = (1e-3) / 0.05 = (1e-3)/(5e-2) )= (1/5) * 1e-1 = 0.02, which is 2e-2. Wait, but wait, that's 2% ionization. But looking at the options, none of them are 2e-2. The options are all in the 1e-4 to 1e-3 range. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concentration. Let me approach this more methodically.

Given:
- Concentration of NH3 (C) = 0.05 M
- pH = 11.0
- Kb = 1.76 × 10^-5

We can find [OH-] from pH:

pOH = 14 - pH = 14 - 11 = 3 → [OH-] = 1e-3 M.

Now, in the dissociation of NH3:

NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + OH-

At equilibrium, [NH4+] = x, [OH-] = x (assuming that the contribution from water autoionization is negligible, which is probably true here because [OH-] is 1e-3, which is higher than 1e-7 from water).

But wait, the [OH-] is given as 1e-3, so x = 1e-3.

Wait, but if x is 1e-3, then the concentration of NH3 that has dissociated is x. So, the degree of ionization α is x / C.

So, α = (1e-3) / 0.05 = 0.02, which is 2e-2 or 0.02. But looking at the options, the highest is H: 1.73e-3, which is much smaller. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe I'm not considering that the [OH-] comes from both NH3 and water, but in this case, since the solution is strongly basic, the contribution from NH3 is much larger than that from water, so it's acceptable to approximate [OH-] ≈ x.

But wait, perhaps I should approach this using the Kb expression correctly.

The Kb expression is Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3].

Given that [OH-] is 1e-3, and assuming that [NH4+] is also 1e-3 (since each mole of NH3 produces one mole each of NH4+ and OH-), then:

Kb = (1e-3)(1e-3) / (0.05 - x) ≈ (1e-6) / (0.05) → because x is small compared to 0.05? Wait, but x is 1e-3, which is 0.001, and 0.05 is 0.05, so 0.001 is about 2% of 0.05, which may not be negligible. So, perhaps I can't ignore x in the denominator.

Wait, but if I proceed without approximation:

Let me denote x as the concentration of NH3 that dissociates. Then,

At equilibrium:
[NH4+] = x
[OH-] = x + 1e-7 (from water), but since 1e-3 is much larger than 1e-7, we can approximate [OH-] ≈ x = 1e-3.

So, [NH3] = 0.05 - x ≈ 0.05 - 1e-3 = 0.049 M.

Wait, but if x is 1e-3, then [NH3] is approximately 0.049. But that's a 2% change, which is perhaps acceptable, but let's see.

Plugging into Kb:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.05 - x) → 1.76e-5 = (1e-3)^2 / (0.05 - 1e-3).

Calculating denominator: 0.05 - 0.001 = 0.049.

(1e-3)^2 = 1e-6.

So, 1e-6 / 0.049 ≈ 2.04e-5.

But Kb is given as 1.76e-5, which is a bit lower. So, perhaps my assumption that x=1e-3 is not accurate, because when I plug in x=1e-3, I get Kb ≈ 2.04e-5, which is larger than the given Kb of 1.76e-5. So, that suggests that x is less than 1e-3.

Hmm, so maybe I need to set up the equation correctly.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the approach. Let me think again.

I have pH =11, so [OH-] =1e-3. The [OH-] comes from NH3 and water, but since NH3 is a weak base, the [OH-] is primarily from NH3. So, let me set up the equation:

Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3]

We know [OH-] is 1e-3, and [NH4+] is equal to [OH-], which is 1e-3.

So, Kb = (1e-3)(1e-3) / [NH3]

But [NH3] is approximately 0.05 - x, where x is the amount that dissociated. But since x is the amount of NH3 that dissociated, x = [NH4+] = 1e-3. So, [NH3] = 0.05 - 1e-3 ≈ 0.049.

So, Kb = (1e-3)^2 / 0.049 ≈ 1e-6 / 0.049 ≈ 2.04e-5.

But the given Kb is 1.76e-5, which is less than 2.04e-5. So, this suggests that my initial assumption that x=1e-3 is leading to a Kb higher than the actual value. Therefore, perhaps x is less than 1e-3, and I need to solve for x.

Wait, but if the solution has a pH of 11, which gives [OH-] = 1e-3, then perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the [OH-] isn't just from NH3 but includes the autoionization of water. Wait, but in a solution with high pH, the OH- from the base dominates, so perhaps the [OH-] is effectively 1e-3.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between pH and the degree of ionization without directly assuming x equals [OH-]. Let me think differently.

Another approach: For a weak base, the pH can be related to the degree of ionization. The formula for pH in terms of Kb and the degree of ionization is:

pH = (pKb - log C - log α) + something? Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between Kb and the ionization.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the [OH-] in terms of the dissociation.

We have NH3 dissociating as NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-.

Let the degree of ionization be α. Then, [NH4+] = α * C, [OH-] = α * C.

Wait, but that's only true if α is very small, so that the change in concentration of NH3 is negligible. But in this case, with pH 11, [OH-] is 1e-3, which may not be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.05 M. So, perhaps I can't make that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression for Kb in terms of α.

Kb = (α * C) * (α * C) / (C - α * C) ) = α² C / (1 - α)

But this might get complicated because it's a quadratic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that 1 - α ≈ 1, but let's see.

Wait, but given that pH is 11, which is quite high, so [OH-] is 1e-3. Let me see what α would be if [OH-] is 1e-3 and C is 0.05 M.

Since [OH-] = α * C → α = [OH-] / C = 1e-3 / 0.05 = 0.02 or 2%.

But as I saw earlier, plugging this into Kb gives a higher value than given. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of OH- is 1e-3, so [NH4+] is 1e-3. The initial concentration of NH3 is 0.05 M, so [NH3] at equilibrium is 0.05 - 1e-3 = 0.049 M. Then, Kb = (1e-3)(1e-3) / 0.049 ≈ 2.04e-5. But the given Kb is 1.76e-5, which is lower. So, that suggests that the actual [OH-] is a bit less than 1e-3, but wait, the pH is given as 11, so [OH-] must be exactly 1e-3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption. Let me try setting up the equation properly without approximating.

Let me denote x as the concentration of OH- produced by NH3. Then, the total [OH-] is x, because water's contribution is negligible (since x is much larger than 1e-7).

So, Kb = (x)(x) / (0.05 - x) = 1.76e-5.

So, x² = 1.76e-5 * (0.05 - x).

Expanding:

x² = 1.76e-5 * 0.05 - 1.76e-5 x.

x² + 1.76e-5 x - 8.8e-7 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's write it as:

x² + (1.76e-5) x - 8.8e-7 = 0.

We can solve this using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)] / 2a.

Here, a = 1, b = 1.76e-5, c = -8.8e-7.

Discriminant D = b² + 4ac = (1.76e-5)^2 + 4*1*(-8.8e-7).

Calculating each term:

(1.76e-5)^2 = (1.76)^2 * 1e-10 = 3.0976e-10.

4ac = 4 * 1 * (-8.8e-7) = -3.52e-6.

Wait, but the discriminant is D = b² - 4ac. Wait, no, because the quadratic is ax² + bx + c = 0, so the discriminant is D = b² - 4ac. But in our case, the equation is x² + (1.76e-5)x -8.8e-7 = 0, so a=1, b=1.76e-5, c= -8.8e-7.

So, D = (1.76e-5)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-8.8e-7) = 3.0976e-10 + 3.52e-6.

Wait, 3.52e-6 is much larger than 3.0976e-10, so D ≈ 3.52e-6.

So, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(3.52e-6) ≈ 1.877e-3.

So, x = [ -1.76e-5 ± 1.877e-3 ] / 2.

We can ignore the negative root because concentration can't be negative, so:

x ≈ ( -1.76e-5 + 1.877e-3 ) / 2 ≈ (1.877e-3 - 1.76e-5) / 2 ≈ (approx 1.8594e-3) / 2 ≈ 9.297e-4.

Wait, but that would make [OH-] ≈ 9.297e-4 M, which would correspond to a pH of about 11.03. But the given pH is 11.0, so perhaps this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, maybe I should use the given pH to find [OH-], which is 1e-3, and then find α.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back. The degree of ionization α is [OH-]/(C + [OH-]), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since [OH-] is 1e-3, and assuming that [OH-] comes from NH3 dissociation, then α = [OH-]/C = 1e-3 / 0.05 = 0.02, which is 2e-2, but that's not among the options. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution's pH is 11, which is due to the NH3 dissociation. So, the [OH-] is 1e-3, which comes from NH3. Thus, the concentration of NH4+ is also 1e-3, so the degree of ionization is 1e-3 / 0.05 = 0.02, which is 2% ionization. But since none of the options are 0.02, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the [OH-] correctly, considering that the solution's pH is 11, which implies [OH-] is 1e-3, and then find the degree of ionization using the Kb expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is using the formula for weak bases:

pOH = (pKb - log C - log α) / 2 ?

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can relate the pH to the degree of dissociation using the formula for weak bases.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of OH- is 1e-3, so [NH4+] is 1e-3. The initial concentration of NH3 is 0.05 M, so the degree of ionization α is [NH4+]/[NH3]_initial = (1e-3)/(0.05) = 0.02. So, α is 0.02, which is 2e-2 or 2%. But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that [NH4+] is equal to [OH-]. Wait, but in the dissociation, each mole of NH3 produces one mole of NH4+ and one mole of OH-. So, [NH4+] = [OH-], which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation. Let's try that.

We have:

Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3].

Let x = [NH4+] = [OH-].

Then, [NH3] = 0.05 - x.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.05 - x) = 1.76e-5.

We know that x is approximately 1e-3, but let's plug that in:

(1e-3)^2 / (0.05 - 1e-3) = 1e-6 / 0.049 ≈ 2.04e-5.

But Kb is 1.76e-5, which is less than 2.04e-5. So, this suggests that x is less than 1e-3. Hmm, but the pH is given as 11, which requires [OH-] = 1e-3. So, perhaps I'm constrained to have x = 1e-3, but then Kb comes out higher than given. This seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the given pH is due to both the NH3 dissociation and water autoionization, but in this case, the contribution from NH3 is much larger, so [OH-] ≈ x. But then, using x=1e-3, the Kb comes out higher than given. So, perhaps the solution is to find x such that Kb is 1.76e-5, and then find the pH from that, but the question gives the pH as 11, so I must have [OH-] =1e-3.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is prepared by dissolving NH3 in water, and the pH is adjusted to 11. So, perhaps NH3 is being treated as a base that is being used to create a buffer solution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to proceed step by step.

Given:

- C = 0.05 M
- pH =11 → [OH-] = 1e-3
- Kb =1.76e-5

We need to find α = [NH4+]/C.

Because [NH4+] = [OH-] =1e-3, then α = (1e-3)/0.05 = 0.02 → 2%. But this doesn't match any option.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

Options:

A: 2.00 × 10^-4

B: 6.20 × 10^-3

C:9.00 × 10^-4

D:3.50 × 10^-3

E:1.76 × 10^-5

F:1 × 10^-3

G:8.65 × 10^-4

H:1.73 × 10^-3

I:4.88 × 10^-4

J:5.50 × 10^-5

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the [OH-] more accurately using the Kb expression.

Let me set up the equation again:

Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3]

We have [NH4+] = [OH-] = x.

[NH3] = 0.05 - x.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.05 - x) =1.76e-5.

But since the pH is 11, x must be 1e-3. So, let's plug that in:

(1e-3)^2 / (0.05 - 1e-3) =1e-6 / 0.049 ≈ 2.04e-5.

But Kb is given as 1.76e-5, which is less than 2.04e-5. So, perhaps the actual x is less than 1e-3. But that would imply that [OH-] is less than 1e-3, which contradicts the given pH of 11.

This suggests that perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe the solution isn't just NH3 in water but is buffered somehow, but the problem states it's a solution of 0.05 M NH3 with pH 11.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not pure NH3 but in a solution where the pH is adjusted to 11. That would imply that the [OH-] is indeed 1e-3, and perhaps some other base is present or the solution is buffered, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate α using the formula:

α = sqrt( (Kb * C) ) / (1 + sqrt(Kb*C)) )

Wait, that's a formula for weak bases where the degree of ionization is approximated when α is small. Let's see:

Compute sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(1.76e-5 * 0.05) = sqrt(8.8e-7) ≈ 2.966e-3.

Then, 1 + 2.966e-3 ≈ 1.002966.

So, α ≈ 2.966e-3 / 1.002966 ≈ 2.957e-3 → approximately 3e-3.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.50e-3, which is close, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, but this formula is an approximation valid when α is small, which may not hold here because the pH is quite high, suggesting a higher degree of ionization.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic solution.

So, let's set up the equation again:

x^2 / (0.05 - x) = 1.76e-5 → x^2 = 1.76e-5 (0.05 - x).

x^2 = 8.8e-7 - 1.76e-5 x.

Rearranging:

x^2 + 1.76e-5 x -8.8e-7 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -1.76e-5 ± sqrt( (1.76e-5)^2 + 4*8.8e-7 ) ] / 2.

Calculating the discriminant:

(1.76e-5)^2 = 3.0976e-10.

4*8.8e-7 = 3.52e-6.

So, D = 3.0976e-10 + 3.52e-6 ≈ 3.52030976e-6.

sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(3.52030976e-6) ≈ 1.876e-3.

So, x = [ -1.76e-5 + 1.876e-3 ] / 2.

Calculating numerator:

1.876e-3 - 1.76e-5 ≈ 1.876e-3 - 0.0000176 ≈ approximately 1.87424e-3.

Divide by 2: x ≈ 9.3712e-4.

So, x ≈ 9.37e-4 M.

Thus, [NH4+] = x ≈ 9.37e-4 M.

Then, the degree of ionization α is [NH4+]/C = 9.37e-4 / 0.05 ≈ 1.874e-2, which is about 1.874e-2 or 1.87%.

But wait, that's higher than the initial assumption of 2e-2, but again, the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but the given pH is 11, so [OH-] is 1e-3, which would mean x must be 1e-3, but when I plug that in, Kb comes out higher than given. So, perhaps the only way this works is if the [OH-] comes from another source, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate α using the relation α = [OH-]/(sqrt(Kb*C)).

Wait, let's compute sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(1.76e-5 * 0.05) = sqrt(8.8e-7) ≈ 2.966e-3.

Then, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb*C) → 2.966e-3, which would correspond to a pH of about 11.54, but the given pH is 11, which is lower.

This suggests that the assumption α² C = Kb*C/(1 + α) is not valid, and perhaps the exact solution is needed.

Wait, going back to the quadratic solution, I found x ≈ 9.37e-4. So, [OH-] = x ≈ 9.37e-4, which would correspond to a pH of about 11.03, which is close to 11. So, perhaps this is acceptable.

Then, the degree of ionization α is x/C = 9.37e-4 / 0.05 ≈ 1.874e-2, which is 0.01874 or 1.874%.

But none of the options are around 0.0187. The closest option is H:1.73e-3, which is 0.173%, way lower than this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, in the quadratic equation, a=1, b=1.76e-5, c=-8.8e-7.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = (1.76e-5)^2 -4(1)(-8.8e-7) = 3.0976e-10 + 3.52e-6 = 3.52035976e-6.

sqrt(D) ≈ 1.876e-3.

So, x = [ -1.76e-5 + 1.876e-3 ] / 2 = (1.876e-3 - 0.0000176) / 2 ≈ 1.8742e-3 / 2 ≈ 9.371e-4.

So, x≈9.371e-4 M.

Then, [OH-] =9.371e-4 → pOH = -log(9.371e-4) ≈ 3.03, so pH=14-3.03≈10.97, which is close to 11. So, perhaps the given pH is an approximation.

Thus, the degree of ionization is α = x/C =9.371e-4 / 0.05 ≈ 1.874e-2 → 1.874%.

But none of the options are close to this. The highest option is H:1.73e-3, which is ~0.173%.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me try a different approach.

Another approach: Using the formula for the degree of ionization for weak bases:

α = sqrt( (Kb * C) ) / (1 + sqrt(Kb * C)) )

So, compute sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(1.76e-5 * 0.05) = sqrt(8.8e-7) ≈ 2.966e-3.

Then, α = 2.966e-3 / (1 + 2.966e-3) ≈ 2.966e-3 / 1.002966 ≈ 2.957e-3 → ~2.96%.

Wait, but that's about 3e-3, which would correspond to option D:3.50e-3, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation.

Wait, perhaps using the exact expression from the quadratic gives α ≈ 9.37e-4 / 0.05 = 1.874e-2, which is 1.874%. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement. Oh wait, the problem says "degree of ionization", which is α = [BH+]/[BH]_initial. But in this case, [BH+] is [NH4+], and [BH]_initial is 0.05 M.

Wait, but in the solution, I've calculated x=9.37e-4 as [NH4+] and [OH-], so α =9.37e-4 /0.05 = 1.874e-2. But this is 1.874e-2, which is 1.874%.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given pH and [OH-], and calculate α as [OH-]/C, which is 1e-3 /0.05 = 0.02, but again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again: The correct expression for Kb is [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3]. Here, [NH4+] = [OH-] =x. [NH3] = 0.05 -x.

So, Kb = x²/(0.05 -x) =1.76e-5.

We can assume that x is small compared to 0.05, so [NH3] ≈0.05.

Then, Kb ≈ x²/0.05 → x² = Kb *0.05 → x = sqrt(1.76e-5 *0.05)=sqrt(8.8e-7)= ~2.966e-3.

So, [OH-]=2.966e-3 → pOH=2.528 → pH=11.472.

But the given pH is 11.0, so this suggests that the assumption x <<0.05 is invalid, and thus, we can't neglect x in the denominator.

Therefore, we need to solve the quadratic equation without approximation.

Earlier, I found x≈9.37e-4, which gives [OH-]=9.37e-4, pH≈10.97, close to 11. So, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with this value.

Thus, α = x/C =9.37e-4 /0.05 ≈ 1.874e-2 → 1.874%.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value again.

Quadratic equation: x² +1.76e-5 x -8.8e-7 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b + sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a, where a=1, b=1.76e-5, c= -8.8e-7.

So,

D= (1.76e-5)^2 +4*1*8.8e-7 = 3.0976e-10 + 3.52e-6 ≈3.52035976e-6.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(3.52035976e-6)= 1.876e-3.

So, x= [ -1.76e-5 +1.876e-3 ] /2 → numerator=1.876e-3 -1.76e-5= 1.876e-3 - 0.0000176=≈1.87423e-3.

x=1.87423e-3 /2 ≈9.371e-4.

So, [OH-]=9.371e-4 → pOH=3.028 → pH=10.972.

Thus, the degree of ionization is 9.371e-4 /0.05= 0.01874 → 1.874%.

But none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given pH to find [OH-], then use that to find the degree of ionization. So, [OH-]=1e-3, and α= [OH-]/C=1e-3/0.05=0.02, which is 2e-2, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the ionization in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is at pH 11, which makes the solution more basic, thus the degree of ionization is higher than the usual case. But I'm stuck because my calculations don't align with the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The highest option is H:1.73e-3, which is about 0.173%. But that's much lower than my calculated 1.87%.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me try solving the quadratic equation again.

Equation: x² +1.76e-5 x -8.8e-7=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -1.76e-5 ± sqrt( (1.76e-5)^2 +4*8.8e-7 ) ] / 2.

Calculate the discriminant:

(1.76e-5)^2 = 3.0976e-10.

4*8.8e-7=3.52e-6.

So, D=3.52e-6 +3.0976e-10≈3.52035976e-6.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(3.52035976e-6)=1.876e-3.

So, x= [ -1.76e-5 +1.876e-3 ] /2 = (1.876e-3 -1.76e-5)/2.

1.876e-3=0.001876; 1.76e-5=0.0000176.

So, 0.001876 -0.0000176=0.0018584.

Divide by 2: 0.0018584/2=0.0009292.

So, x≈9.292e-4 M.

So, [NH4+]=9.292e-4; [NH3]=0.05 -9.292e-4≈0.04907.

Then, Kb= (9.292e-4)^2 /0.04907 ≈(8.636e-7)/0.04907≈1.76e-5, which matches the given Kb.

Thus, α= [NH4+]/C=9.292e-4 /0.05= 1.858e-2 →1.858%.

But again, the options don't include this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, the given Kb is 1.76e-5, which is correct for NH3.

Wait, perhaps the solution expects me to ignore the change in concentration of NH3, i.e., assume [NH3]=0.05 M.

Then, Kb= x² /0.05 →x²=0.05*1.76e-5=8.8e-7 →x= sqrt(8.8e-7)=2.966e-3.

So, [OH-]=2.966e-3 →pH=11.54, but the given pH is 11.0, which is lower. So, this approach isn't valid.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, looking back, the only option close to my calculation is option H:1.73e-3, which is 1.73e-3, but that's about 0.173%, which is much lower than the 1.87% I calculated. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is prepared by dissolving NH3 in a solution where [OH-] is 1e-3, and calculate α based on that. So, α = [NH4+]/C = [OH-]/C =1e-3/0.05=0.02, which is 2e-2, but again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the degree of ionization at a certain pH, using the pH to find [OH-], then use that to find α, assuming that [NH4+]=[OH-].

In that case, α = [OH-]/C =1e-3 /0.05=0.02=2e-2. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the degree of ionization using the pH and Kb, without directly equating [OH-] to x.

Let me try another approach:

The pH is 11, so [OH-]=1e-3.

The formula for the degree of ionization for a weak base can be expressed as:

α = sqrt( (Kb * C) ) / (1 + sqrt(Kb * C)) )

But this is only an approximation when α is small. Let's compute this:

sqrt(Kb*C)=sqrt(1.76e-5 *0.05)=sqrt(8.8e-7)=2.966e-3.

So, α ≈2.966e-3 / (1 +2.966e-3) ≈2.966e-3 /1.002966≈2.957e-3 →2.957%.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute α using the relation:

α = [OH-]/(sqrt(Kb*C)).

But that would give:

α =1e-3 / (2.966e-3) ≈0.337 → which can't be right because that's over 30% ionization, which is too high.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression:

α = [OH-]/(C + [OH-]).

So, [OH-]=1e-3, C=0.05.

Thus, α=1e-3/(0.05 +1e-3)=1e-3 /0.051≈1.96e-2 →1.96%.

Again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is due to NH3, so [OH-]=1e-3 comes from NH3 dissociation, and the degree of ionization is [NH4+]/C =1e-3/0.05=0.02, but again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B:6.20e-3, which is 0.62%. Let me see how that could come about.

If α=6.2e-3, then [NH4+]=6.2e-3 *0.05=3.1e-4 M.

Then, Kb=(3.1e-4)^2/(0.05 -3.1e-4)= (9.61e-8)/(0.04969)=1.935e-6, which is way lower than the given Kb of 1.76e-5. So, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me try solving it numerically.

Let me set up the equation:

x² +1.76e-5 x -8.8e-7=0.

We can use the Newton-Raphson method to solve for x.

Let me define f(x)=x² +1.76e-5 x -8.8e-7.

f'(x)=2x +1.76e-5.

We'll start with an initial guess x0=1e-3.

Compute f(x0)= (1e-3)^2 +1.76e-5*(1e-3) -8.8e-7 →1e-6 +1.76e-8 -8.8e-7= (1e-6 -8.8e-7) +1.76e-8=1.2e-6 +1.76e-8≈1.376e-6.

f'(x0)=2*(1e-3)+1.76e-5=2e-3 +1.76e-5=2.0176e-3.

Next iteration: x1 =x0 -f(x0)/f'(x0)=1e-3 - (1.376e-6)/(2.0176e-3)=1e-3 - (approx 6.818e-4)=0.0003182.

Wait, that can't be right because 1e-3 minus 0.0006818 is negative, which can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 1.376e-6 /2.0176e-3:

1.376e-6 /2.0176e-3 = (1.376 /2017.6) )e-3 → approx 0.0006818e-3 →6.818e-7.

So, x1=1e-3 -6.818e-7≈0.000993182.

Now, compute f(x1)= (0.000993182)^2 +1.76e-5*(0.000993182) -8.8e-7.

(0.000993182)^2≈9.864e-7.

1.76e-5 *0.000993182≈1.746e-8.

So, f(x1)=9.864e-7 +1.746e-8 -8.8e-7= (9.864e-7 -8.8e-7) +1.746e-8=1.064e-7 +1.746e-8≈1.2386e-7.

f'(x1)=2*0.000993182 +1.76e-5≈0.001986364 +0.0000176≈0.002003964.

Next iteration:

x2 =x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1)=0.000993182 - (1.2386e-7)/(0.002003964)≈0.000993182 -6.185e-5≈0.000993182 -0.00006185≈0.00093133.

Now, compute f(x2)= (0.00093133)^2 +1.76e-5*(0.00093133) -8.8e-7.

(0.00093133)^2≈8.675e-7.

1.76e-5 *0.00093133≈1.638e-8.

So, f(x2)=8.675e-7 +1.638e-8 -8.8e-7≈(8.675e-7 -8.8e-7)+1.638e-8≈-1.25e-9 +1.638e-8≈1.513e-8.

f'(x2)=2*0.00093133 +1.76e-5≈0.00186266 +0.0000176≈0.00188026.

Next iteration:

x3 =x2 - f(x2)/f'(x2)=0.00093133 - (1.513e-8)/(0.00188026)≈0.00093133 -8.04e-6≈0.00093133 -0.00000804≈0.00092329.

Compute f(x3)= (0.00092329)^2 +1.76e-5*(0.00092329) -8.8e-7.

(0.00092329)^2≈8.523e-7.

1.76e-5 *0.00092329≈1.626e-8.

So, f(x3)=8.523e-7 +1.626e-8 -8.8e-7≈(8.523e-7 -8.8e-7)+1.626e-8≈-2.77e-9 +1.626e-8≈1.349e-8.

f'(x3)=2*0.00092329 +1.76e-5≈0.00184658 +0.0000176≈0.00186418.

x4= x3 - f(x3)/f'(x3)=0.00092329 - (1.349e-8)/(0.00186418)≈0.00092329 -7.24e-6≈0.00092329 -0.00000724≈0.00091605.

Compute f(x4)= (0.00091605)^2 +1.76e-5*(0.00091605) -8.8e-7.

(0.00091605)^2≈8.393e-7.

1.76e-5 *0.00091605≈1.612e-8.

So, f(x4)=8.393e-7 +1.612e-8 -8.8e-7≈(8.393e-7 -8.8e-7)+1.612e-8≈-4.07e-9 +1.612e-8≈1.205e-8.

f'(x4)=2*0.00091605 +1.76e-5≈0.0018321 +0.0000176≈0.0018497.

x5= x4 - (1.205e-8)/(0.0018497)=0.00091605 -6.518e-6≈0.00091605 -0.000006518≈0.00090953.

This is converging towards approximately x≈9.095e-4 M.

So, [OH-]=9.095e-4 → pOH=3.037 → pH=10.963.

Thus, the degree of ionization α= x/C=9.095e-4 /0.05≈1.819e-2 →1.819%.

But again, none of the options match this. The closest option is not present, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:6.20e-3, but I can't see how that would align with the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option that is approximately sqrt(Kb*C), which is ~3e-3, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given pH to find [OH-], then calculate α as [OH-]/(sqrt(Kb*C)).

But that would be 1e-3 / (2.966e-3)≈0.337, which is 33.7%, which is way too high and doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution expects me to ignore the [OH-] from water and proceed with the assumption that [OH-]=x, leading to α= x/C= 1e-3/0.05=0.02, which is 2e-2, but again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:6.20e-3, which is 6.2e-3. Let me see:

If α=6.2e-3, then [NH4+]=6.2e-3 *0.05=3.1e-4 M.

Then, Kb= (3.1e-4)^2/(0.05 -3.1e-4)=9.61e-8/(0.04969)=1.935e-6, which is much lower than the given Kb of 1.76e-5. So, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is 11, so [OH-]=1e-3, and then find [NH4+] using Kb.

So, Kb= [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3] → [NH4+]= Kb*[NH3]/[OH-].

But [NH3]=0.05 - [NH4+] ≈0.05 (if [NH4+] is small), but given that pH is 11, [NH4+] is 1e-3, which is significant compared to 0.05. So, [NH3]=0.05 -1e-3=0.049.

Thus, [NH4+]= (1.76e-5 *0.049)/1e-3 ≈(8.584e-7)/1e-3≈8.584e-4.

Wait, that's 8.58e-4, which would make α=8.58e-4 /0.05=1.716e-2→1.716%.

Again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for weak bases:

α = [OH-]/(sqrt(Kb*C)).

So, [OH-]=1e-3, Kb*C=1.76e-5 *0.05=8.8e-7.

sqrt(8.8e-7)=2.966e-3.

So, α=1e-3 /2.966e-3≈0.337 →33.7%, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the degree of ionization is expressed as a percentage, so 3.37%, but again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:6.20e-3, but I can't see how that comes about. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations, and the correct answer is option H:1.73e-3.

Wait, let me compute α=1.73e-3.

Then, [NH4+]=1.73e-3 *0.05=8.65e-5.

Then, Kb= (8.65e-5)^2 / (0.05 -8.65e-5) ≈7.48e-9 /0.049914≈1.505e-7, which is much lower than 1.76e-5.

So, that's not correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option B:6.20e-3, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution, and the correct x is 6.20e-3, leading to α=6.20e-3/0.05=0.124, which is 12.4%, but that's way too high.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H:1.73e-3. Let me compute Kb with x=1.73e-3.

x=1.73e-3.

Then, [NH3]=0.05 -1.73e-3≈0.04827.

Kb= (1.73e-3)^2 /0.04827 ≈(2.9929e-6)/0.04827≈6.199e-5, which is close to the given Kb of 1.76e-5? No, it's higher. So, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option B:6.20e-3, but I can't find a way to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I should go with the initial assumption that α= [OH-]/C=1e-3/0.05=0.02, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:6.20e-3.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:1.73e-3, but I can't see how that aligns with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try recalculating the quadratic solution.

We have:

x² +1.76e-5 x -8.8e-7=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-1.76e-5 ± sqrt( (1.76e-5)^2 +4*8.8e-7 ) ] / 2.

Which is:

x = [ -1.76e-5 ± sqrt(3.0976e-10 +3.52e-6) ] /2.

sqrt(3.52035976e-6)=1.876e-3.

So, x= [ -1.76e-5 +1.876e-3 ] /2.

Which is (1.876e-3 -1.76e-5)/2= (1.8584e-3)/2=9.292e-4.

Thus, α=9.292e-4 /0.05=1.858e-2→1.858%.

But again, no option matches. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B:6.20e-3, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:1.73e-3, but I'm not finding a path to it.

Wait, perhaps I should compute α using the formula:

α = [OH-]/sqrt(Kb*C).

So, [OH-]=1e-3.

sqrt(Kb*C)=sqrt(1.76e-5 *0.05)=sqrt(8.8e-7)=2.966e-3.

So, α=1e-3 /2.966e-3≈0.337 →33.7%, which is way higher than any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct α is approximately 1.87%, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B:6.20e-3, though I can't see how that arises.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:1.73e-3, but I can't find a way to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the [OH-] is 1e-3, and that [NH4+]=1e-3, so α=1e-3/0.05=0.02=2e-2, which is 2%. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a calculation where α= [OH-]/(sqrt(Kb*C)).

But that gives 1e-3/(2.966e-3)=0.337→33.7%, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:6.20e-3, but I can't see how. I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is option B:6.20e-3, though I'm not entirely confident.
</think>

To determine the degree of ionization (α) of 0.05 M NH₃ in a solution with a pH of 11.0 and a given \( K_b = 1.76 \times 10^{-5} \), the following steps were taken:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Initial concentration of NH₃ (\( C \)) = 0.05 M
   - pH = 11.0 → pOH = 3 → \([OH^-] = 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\)
   - \( K_b = 1.76 \times 10^{-5} \)

2. **Relationships**:
   - For a weak base, \( K_b = \frac{[NH_4^+][OH^-]}{[NH_3]} \).
   - At equilibrium, \([NH_4^+] = [OH^-] = x\), and \([NH_3] = C - x\).

3. **Quadratic Equation Setup**:
   Substituting into the \( K_b \) expression:
   \[
   K_b = \frac{x^2}{C - x}
   \]
   Substituting \( K_b = 1.76 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( C = 0.05 \):
   \[
   x^2 + 1.76 \times 10^{-5}x - 8.8 \times 10^{-7} = 0
   \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   Using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1.76 \times 10^{-5} \), and \( c = -8.8 \times 10^{-7} \). Solving gives:
   \[
   x \approx 9.37 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Degree of Ionization**:
   The degree of ionization (\( \alpha \)) is:
   \[
   \alpha = \frac{x}{C} = \frac{9.37 \times 10^{-4}}{0.05} \approx 1.87 \times 10^{-2} \, (1.87\%)
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   None of the provided options match the calculated \( \alpha \) of \( 1.87\% \). The closest option is **B: \( 6.20 \times 10^{-3} \)**, though this does not align with the calculations.

Given the discrepancy, the most reasonable choice based on the provided options is:

ANSWER: B
