Okay, so I need to figure out which type of advertising campaign is focused on gathering support for a particular message or cause. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, the question is asking about an advertising campaign that's aimed at gaining support for a message or cause. That makes me think it's more about promoting an idea or a cause rather than selling a product or service directly.

Looking at the options:

A: Idea-oriented. Hmm, that sounds like it's focused on ideas, which could include messages or causes. That seems relevant.

B: Company-oriented. This would be about the company itself, like promoting their image or values, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about gathering support for a message.

C: Market-oriented. This is probably about targeting a market, which might involve understanding the market but not necessarily gathering support for a cause.

D: Service-oriented. This would be about services the company offers, so more about the service rather than a cause.

E: Brand-oriented. This is about building the brand's image, which is more about branding than a specific message or cause.

F: Product-oriented. Clearly about the products, so not the cause.

G: Person-oriented. Maybe about individuals, but I'm not sure how that ties into gathering support for a message.

H: Consumer-oriented. This is about consumers, perhaps their needs or preferences, but again, not specifically about a cause.

I: Profit-oriented. This is about making profits, which is more about the company's financial goals than a message.

So, the key is the focus on gathering support for a message or cause. Idea-oriented seems to fit because it's about promoting an idea, which could be a cause or message. Company-oriented might involve a message, but it's more about the company itself. The other options are more about products, services, branding, or profits, which don't directly relate to gathering support for a cause.
