Okay, so I've got this PyTorch question here, and I need to figure out which commands produce the required matrices. Let me read it carefully.

The question asks for two specific matrices. The first is a 10x5 Gaussian matrix where each entry is i.i.d. sampled from N(μ=5, σ²=16). The second is a 10x10 uniform matrix where each entry is sampled from U[-1,1). I need to find the correct PyTorch commands from the options A to J.

Let me break this down. First, I'll handle the Gaussian part, then the uniform part.

Starting with the Gaussian matrix. The parameters are μ=5 and σ²=16, so σ is 4 because σ = sqrt(16) =4.

In PyTorch, the function for generating Gaussian (normal) random numbers is torch.normal(mean, std). Alternatively, torch.randn() generates standard normal (mean 0, std 1), and you can scale and shift it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: torch.normal(torch.ones(10,5)*5, torch.ones(5,5)*16). Wait, the mean is 10x5, which is correct for a 10x5 matrix. But the std is given as 5x5 with 16. Wait, that would make it a 5x5 matrix of stds. But when you pass mean and std to torch.normal, they need to be broadcastable. So if the mean is 10x5, the std should match in shape or be broadcastable. Here, 5x5 won't broadcast to 10x5 correctly unless it's on the right dimensions. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Or perhaps the std is 16, but wait, torch.normal takes standard deviation, not variance. Oh right, because variance is σ², so std is sqrt(var). In the question, σ² is 16, so σ is 4.

So the correct way to get N(5,16) is to have mean 5 and std 4. Let me look at the options.

Looking at option B: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4. That makes sense. Because torch.randn(10,5) gives a 10x5 matrix with mean 0 and std 1. Multiplying by 4 gives std 4, and adding 5 shifts the mean to 5.

Option F: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4; and the uniform part is torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1). Wait, but I need to check each option.

Option G: The Gaussian part is torch.normal with mean 5 and std 16. Wait, no—σ is 4, so this would be wrong because it's using 16 as the standard deviation, which is incorrect.

Option H: The Gaussian uses std 4 (since 4 is the std), but the uniform part is correct, I think.

Wait, let me think again. The Gaussian part needs to have mean=5 and std=4.

So for each option, I'll check the Gaussian command:

A: The std tensor is ones(5,5)*16. That's 5x5, but the mean is 10x5. So when you pass them to torch.normal, does it work? Because the mean is 10x5 and the std is 5x5, perhaps it's broadcasted correctly. But wait, broadcasting in PyTorch requires that the dimensions are compatible. For example, 10x5 and 5x5 can be broadcasted if the 5x5 is along the correct axis. Alternatively, maybe the std should be 10x5 as well. So the first part of option A might be incorrect because the std is 5x5, but the mean is 10x5. I'm not sure if that would work correctly. Maybe it's better to use 10x5 for both mean and std.

Option B: Uses 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4. That's correct because torch.randn gives N(0,1), so multiplied by 4 gives N(0,16), and adding 5 shifts to N(5,16). So the Gaussian part is correct.

Option C: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*16. No, because that would give std=16, which is incorrect since σ is 4.

Option D: The Gaussian part is correct (mean 5, std 16). No, because std should be 4, so this is wrong.

Option E: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*16. Again, std is 16, wrong.

Option F: Gaussian part is correct, as it's 5 +.randn *4. The uniform part is torch.rand with low=-1 and high=1. Wait, does that work? Because torch.rand by default is [0,1), so if you set low=-1 and high=1, it would generate U[-1,1). But wait, in PyTorch, the function is torch.rand with parameters (size, low=0.0, high=1.0). So for option F, the uniform part is torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1), which is correct.

Option I: Gaussian part is correct (5 +.randn *4). The uniform part is (rand -0.5)/0.5. Let's see: torch.rand(10,10) gives [0,1), subtract 0.5 gives [-0.5, 0.5), then divide by 0.5 gives [-1,1). So that's correct. So I's uniform part is correct.

Option J: Gaussian part is 5 +.randn *16, which is wrong. The uniform part is (rand -0.5)/0.5, which is correct, but since the Gaussian part is wrong, J is incorrect.

Now, looking at the uniform part. The desired distribution is U[-1,1). So the values should be in the interval [-1,1).

The possible ways to generate this:

1. Using torch.rand and scaling. For example, 2*torch.rand(...) -1. Because torch.rand gives [0,1), multiplying by 2 gives [0,2), subtracting 1 gives [-1,1).

2. Alternatively, using torch.rand with low=-1 and high=1. But I think that's not correct because the default is low=0, high=1, but you can specify them. Wait, no, wait: the function is torch.rand(*size, low=..., high=...). So setting low=-1 and high=1 would generate numbers in [-1,1). But wait, actually, the torch.rand function without arguments gives [0,1), but when you set low and high, it's from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive). So yes, that would work.

But wait, let me check the options.

Option B's uniform part is 2*torch.rand(10,10) -1. That's correct.

Option F's uniform part is torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1). I think that's correct as well, but wait, is that how it's implemented? Because in PyTorch, the function signature is torch.rand(*size, dtype=None, device=None, out=None, low=0.0, high=1.0). So you can specify low and high. So that would generate U[low, high).

So both options B and F have correct uniform parts, but let me check other options.

Option A's uniform part is (rand -0.5)/0.5. That's the same as (rand -0.5)/0.5: rand is [0,1), so subtracting 0.5 gives [-0.5, 0.5), then dividing by 0.5 gives [-1,1). So that's correct.

Option I's uniform part is (rand -0.5)/0.5, which is correct.

Option G's uniform part is 2*rand -1, which is correct.

Option H's uniform part is 2*rand -1, correct.

So now, let me go back to each option.

The Gaussian part must be mean=5, std=4.

Option B: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 → correct.

Option F: same Gaussian part → correct.

Option I: same Gaussian part → correct.

Option G: Gaussian part is torch.normal with mean 5 and std 16 → incorrect.

Option H: Gaussian part is mean 5, std 4 → correct.

Wait, let me look at each option again.

Option B: Gaussian is correct, uniform is 2*rand -1 → correct. So option B's both parts are correct.

Option F: Gaussian correct, uniform correct via low and high. So F's both correct?

Wait, no—let me check each option's exact code.

Option F: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 ; torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1). So yes, both correct.

Option I: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 ; (torch.rand(10,10) -0.5)/0.5. Both correct.

So which options have both parts correct?

Looking at each option:

A: Gaussian part has std=16 (wrong), uniform correct.

B: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

C: Gaussian wrong, uniform correct?

Wait, C's Gaussian part is 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*16 → std=16, wrong.

D: Gaussian std=16, wrong.

E: same as C.

F: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

G: Gaussian std=16, wrong.

H: Gaussian correct (std=4), uniform correct.

I: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

J: Gaussian wrong, uniform correct.

Wait, so which options have both parts correct?

Looking for options where both Gaussian and uniform parts are correct.

Option B: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Option F: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Option H: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Option I: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Option J: Gaussian wrong.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Option B: The uniform part is 2*torch.rand(10,10) -1 → correct.

Option F: The uniform part is torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1) → correct.

Option I: The uniform part is (torch.rand(10,10) -0.5)/0.5 → correct.

Option H: The uniform part is 2*torch.rand(10,10) -1 → correct.

So the Gaussian part:

Option B: Correct.

Option F: Correct.

Option H: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

Now, looking at the options, which ones have both parts correct.

Looking at each option:

Option B: Both correct.

Option F: Both correct.

Option H: Both correct.

Option I: Both correct.

Wait, but let me check the uniform part in option H: it's 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1, which is correct.

So which options have both parts correct?

Looking back at the options, I think only options B, F, H, I, and maybe others.

Wait, but let me check each option's exact code.

Let me list the options again.

Option B: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 ; 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1 → both correct.

Option F: 5 + ...*4 ; torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1) → both correct.

Option H: Gaussian part is torch.normal with mean 10,5 and std 5,5*4 → because the std is torch.ones(5,5)*4. Wait, no. Let me see.

Option H: The Gaussian is torch.normal(torch.ones(10,5)*5, torch.ones(5,5)*4). Wait, that's mean 10x5, std 5x5. So the mean is 10x5, std is 5x5. When you pass them to torch.normal, does it broadcast correctly?

I think that in PyTorch, the mean and std must be broadcastable to the same shape. So if mean is 10x5 and std is 5x5, perhaps it works because the broadcasting would be along the second dimension. So for each row in the mean (10 rows), the std would be replicated along columns. So for each row i in mean, the std would be taken from std's row. So it's possible that this works, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to have the std as a 10x5 matrix with all elements 4. So in option B, the approach is more straightforward and correct.

But regardless, the other parts: in option H, the Gaussian is correct, and the uniform is correct.

Similarly, option F: The uniform part uses the low and high parameters, which is correct.

So which options have both parts correct? Let me check each option.

The question is which command produces the required matrices. So the correct option must have both parts correct.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Option F: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Option H: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Option I: Gaussian correct, uniform correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The correct Gaussian command is either:

- Using torch.normal with mean=5 and std=4, which can be done with a tensor of 10x5 for mean and 10x5 for std (each element 4).

Or

- Using 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4.

Both are correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: Uses the second approach for Gaussian, correct.

Option F: Same for Gaussian, correct.

Option H: Uses torch.normal with mean=10x5 and std=5x5*4. Wait, the std is torch.ones(5,5)*4, which is 5x5. Does that work with a 10x5 mean? Probably not, because the broadcasting may not align correctly. Because the mean is 10x5, and the std is 5x5, perhaps it would broadcast correctly along the columns. For example, each row in the mean would use the same std row. But I'm not sure if that's the intended behavior. It might work, but it's a bit more complex than necessary. So perhaps the correct way is to have the std as a 10x5 matrix filled with 4s. So perhaps option B is the better choice.

Now, the uniform part.

Option B uses 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1, which is correct.

Option F uses torch.rand with low=-1 and high=1, which is correct.

So both options B and F have the correct uniform part.

But wait, looking at the options, option B's uniform command is 2*torch.rand(10,10) -1, which is correct.

Option F's uniform command is torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1), which is correct.

So both B and F have correct uniform parts.

But wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer must be one of the options. Let's see.

The question is to select the correct commands that produce both matrices.

So which options have both parts correct?

Looking back, option B's Gaussian is correct (5 +.randn *4), and uniform is correct (2*rand -1). So option B is correct.

Option F's Gaussian is correct, and uniform is correct, but in the options, I need to see if any option has both correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each providing two commands.

So let me check each option again.

Option B: 

First command: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 → correct.

Second command: 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1 → correct.

So option B is correct.

Option F:

First command: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 → correct.

Second command: torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1) → correct.

So option F is also correct.

Wait, but that can't be. Because in the options, each option is a pair of commands. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps some options have Gaussian part wrong.

Wait, looking at option B: the Gaussian is correct, and the uniform is correct.

Option F: same.

Option H: Gaussian uses std=4 correctly, but the mean is 10x5, and std is 5x5. Not sure if that's correct, but perhaps it's correct.

But the question is to select the correct command(s), so perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check each option.

Option B: Both commands correct.

Option F: Both commands correct.

Option I: Both commands correct.

Wait, but the options are structured as two commands per option.

So perhaps the correct answer is B, F, H, I, etc. But looking at the options, perhaps only option B is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B's uniform command is 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1 → correct.

Option F's uniform command is torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1) → correct.

So both options B and F have both parts correct.

But looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but the options don't have multiple correct answers. Wait, the question says "which command(s)" but the options are single letters, each representing two commands.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

The Gaussian part needs to have mean=5 and std=4.

Option B: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 → correct.

The uniform part: 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1 → correct.

So option B is correct.

Option F: same Gaussian, and uniform part is torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1) → correct.

So option F is also correct.

Hmm, but the question is to select one option that correctly produces both matrices. So perhaps both B and F are correct, but I need to check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 ; 2 * torch.rand(10,10) -1 → both correct.

Option F: 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 ; torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1) → both correct.

So both options B and F are correct. But wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but the options don't allow selecting multiple. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the uniform part in option F is incorrect.

Wait, in PyTorch, the function torch.rand(*size, low=..., high=...) is available in version 1.3 and above. So using torch.rand(10,10, low=-1, high=1) is correct.

So option F's uniform part is correct.

Hmm, but the question is to choose one option. So perhaps both B and F are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is option B and option F. But the options don't have multiple correct answers. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another approach: the Gaussian matrix is 10x5, and the uniform is 10x10.

Looking at the options, option B's first command is 5 + torch.randn(10,5)*4 → correct.

Second command: 2*rand -1 → correct.

So option B is correct.

Option F's first command is correct, second command is correct.

So both B and F are correct. But perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the std in the Gaussian part again.

In option B, the Gaussian is created by scaling and shifting the standard normal. So it's correct.

In option F, same for Gaussian.

So perhaps the correct answer is both B and F, but perhaps the options have only one correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but in the options, only B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I think that both B and F are correct. So perhaps the correct options are B and F.

Wait, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but I can only choose one. So perhaps I made a mistake and only one option is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps only option B is correct because the uniform part in F is using low and high, which may not be supported in some versions, but the question specifies PyTorch 1.8, which does support it.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The correct way to create the uniform matrix is to have values in [-1,1).

Option B uses 2*rand -1, which is correct.

Option F uses torch.rand with low=-1 and high=1, which is correct.

So both are correct.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but since the options are single letters, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each being a pair of commands. So perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but since the user is asking to select from A to J, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but since each option is a single letter, perhaps I should look for the one that correctly implements both parts.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but I can't select both.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see which options have both parts correct.

Option B: Both correct.

Option F: Both correct.

Option I: Both correct.

Option H: Both correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B and F, but I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

But I think the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps option B is the correct choice.
</think>

The correct commands are:

For the Gaussian matrix: `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4`  
For the uniform matrix: `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1`

These commands correctly generate the desired distributions. 

Answer: B
