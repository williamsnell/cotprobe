Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about inertial reference frames and events in space-time. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. Alright, the question says that in a particular inertial frame S, two events occur a distance of 6×10^8 meters apart and are separated by a time interval. Then I have two options for the time: (a) 2 seconds and (b) 1 second. The question is asking for the proper time interval between these two events.

Wait, proper time... Right, I remember that proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the events. Oh wait, but wait, for proper time to apply, the events must be at the same place in that frame. Because proper time is the shortest possible time between two events, measured in the frame where they happen at the same spot.

So, the formula for proper time is the square root of (Δt² - (Δx² + Δy² + Δz²)/c²), all multiplied by c², but I think the formula is usually written as Δτ = sqrt(Δt² - (Δx² + Δy² + Δz²)/c²). Oh wait, no, wait, the units might be a bit tricky here. Let me get that right.

The general formula is τ = sqrt( (t2 - t1)^2 - (x2 - x1)^2/c^2 - (y2-y1)^2/c^2 - (z2-z1)^2/c^2 ) all multiplied by c^2, but wait, no, actually, in terms of units, we have to make sure everything's in consistent units. Let me think: in SI units, c is about 3e8 m/s. So the units for the time term would be seconds squared, and for the space terms, (meters)^2/(meters squared per second squared), which would give seconds squared. So when I take the square root, I get seconds.

So in this problem, the two events are separated by Δx = 6e8 meters. The time separation is either 2 seconds or 1 second. So the proper time interval would be the minimum possible time, but wait, no, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the events occur at the same place, so it's the smallest possible time interval between the two events across all possible inertial frames.

Wait, but the question is asking for the proper time interval. So proper time (Δτ) is calculated using the spacetime interval. Let me compute that.

For part (a), Δt = 2 seconds. So Δt² = (2)^2 = 4 s². Δx² is (6e8 m)^2 = 36e16 m². Now, c is 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s². So (Δx²)/c² = (36e16)/(9e16) = 4 s². So the spacetime interval would be Δt² - (Δx²/c²) = 4 - 4 = 0. So Δτ = sqrt(0) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Or can it?

Wait, but if the spacetime interval is zero, that means the two events are timelike separated and happen at the same place in some frame. So the proper time would be zero, which would imply that in that frame, the two events occur at the same time and same place. But wait, no, if Δτ is zero, that would mean that the two events are causally connected and occur at the same place in some frame. But wait, can that happen here?

Wait, let me think again. The spacetime interval squared is (Δt)^2 c^2 - (Δx)^2 - (Δy)^2 - (Δz)^2. Oh wait, the formula is s² = (Δt c)^2 - (Δx)^2 - (Δy)^2 - (Δz)^2. So s² is the square of the spacetime interval. Proper time is then Δτ = sqrt(s²)/c. Wait, if s² is positive, it's spacelike; if zero, it's lightlike; if negative, timelike.

Wait, wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check. The invariant spacetime interval is s² = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2 - (Δy)^2 - (Δz)^2. So s² is (cΔt)^2 minus the sum of the squares of the spatial separations. So for proper time, in the frame where the two events are at the same location, the spatial separation is zero, so s² = (cΔτ)^2. So Δτ = s/(c), but wait, no, because s² is (cΔτ)^2, so Δτ = sqrt(s²)/c. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me approach this step by step. Let's take case (a) where Δt = 2 seconds. So, s² = (c * 2)^2 - (6e8)^2. c is 3e8 m/s, so (3e8)^2 = 9e16, and 2*c is 6e8 m/s, so (2c)^2 is (6e8)^2 = 36e16 m²/s². Wait, no, wait: (cΔt) is (3e8 m/s) * 2 s = 6e8 m. So (cΔt)^2 is (6e8 m)^2 = 36e16 m². The spatial separation is 6e8 m, so (Δx)^2 is (6e8)^2 = 36e16 m². So s² is (36e16) - (36e16) = 0. So s² is zero, which means the two events are lightlike separated. That implies that in some frame, the two events can be made to occur at the same point, and the proper time would be zero. But wait, proper time can't be negative, but can it be zero? Yes, if the events are on a lightlike path.

Wait, but for timelike events, s² is negative, so Δτ would be real. For spacelike, s² is positive, so Δτ would be imaginary, which doesn't make sense in real physics, implying that you can't have a frame where the events are simultaneous (but wait, that's not exactly right either; perhaps I'm mixing up some concepts here).

Wait, but in this case (a), s²=0. So the proper time Δτ would be zero. So in that case, the proper time is zero. But wait, that's only possible if the events are causally connected and lie on a lightlike path. So for part (a), the proper time is zero. But wait, the options don't include zero except in option G, which says Δt' =0 and no reference frame S' can be found. Wait, but if s²=0, then there exists a frame where the events occur at the same place, so the proper time is zero. So in that case, option G would be correct?

Wait, but let me think again. If the proper time is zero, that implies that the two events are simultaneous in some frame, but only if they are at the same location. So in that frame, the time between events is zero, and the spatial separation is zero. So that's possible, but in our case, the spatial separation in S is 6e8 m apart. So to find a frame S' where the two events are at the same place, we can calculate the required velocity.

Wait, but if s²=0, then the events are lightlike separated, so there's a frame where they are at the same place, but the time between would be zero. So the proper time is zero. So in that case, the proper time is zero, but looking at the options, option G says Δt' is zero, but it also says no reference frame S' can be found. Wait, that can't be right because if s²=0, then such a frame exists where the events are at the same place. So option G's second part is wrong. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer for part (a) is zero, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, the options are from A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 2
B: 2.5
C: Can't determine without velocity info
D:4
E:√3
F: Two events never occur at same place
G: 0 and no S' exists
H:3
I:1.5
J:1

Wait, in part (a), if the proper time is zero, then option G says Δt' is zero, but also says no S' can be found. That's incorrect because S' does exist when s²=0. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute this correctly. Let me recalculate part (a):

s² = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2.

Given Δt=2s, Δx=6e8 m.

c=3e8 m/s, so cΔt=3e8 * 2 = 6e8 m.

So (cΔt)^2 = (6e8)^2 = 36e16 m².

Δx^2 = (6e8)^2 = 36e16 m².

So s²=36e16 -36e16 =0.

So s=0, which implies that the events are lightlike separated. So the proper time is zero, because in the frame where they are at the same place, the time between them is zero.

But in that frame, the events are at the same place, so Δx'=0, and Δt' =0. So the proper time is zero.

So the answer for part (a) would be option G: Δt' =0 and no reference frame S' can be found. Wait, but that's not correct because a frame S' does exist where the events are simultaneous and at the same place.

Wait, perhaps option G is incorrect because the second part is wrong. So maybe the answer isn't among the options. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the events. If the events are lightlike separated, then they can be made coincident in some frame, but that frame would have them separated by zero time. So the proper time is zero.

But looking at the options, option G says Δt'=0 and no S' exists, which is incorrect because such an S' does exist. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only timelike intervals, and if s² is zero, then it's not a timelike interval, so the proper time is undefined?

Wait, no, proper time is defined as the minimum possible time between two events, which is the case when they are at the same place. So for lightlike events, the proper time is zero. So the answer for part (a) would be zero, but none of the options directly state that except option G, which also has a wrong part.

Wait, perhaps I should check part (b) first, where Δt=1s.

In part (b), Δt=1s, so s² = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2.

cΔt =3e8 *1 =3e8 m.

So (cΔt)^2=9e16 m².

Δx^2=(6e8)^2=36e16 m².

So s²=9e16 -36e16 = -27e16 m².

So s² is negative, which means it's a timelike interval, so proper time is real.

So Δτ = sqrt( (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2 ) = sqrt(1^2 - (6e8 /3e8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1-4) = sqrt(-3). Oh wait, that's imaginary, which can't be right. Wait, that can't be possible because for a timelike interval, s² should be positive, but in this case, it's negative.

Wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the formula again. Let me get it right. The proper time is given by Δτ = sqrt( (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2 ), but only if (Δt)^2 > (Δx/c)^2; otherwise, it's spacelike and not possible to have a real proper time.

In part (b), (Δt)^2 is 1, and (Δx/c)^2 is (6e8 m /3e8 m/s)^2 = (2)^2 =4. So 1 <4, so the square root of a negative number, which would be imaginary. That implies that the interval is spacelike, and thus, the events cannot be made to occur at the same place in any frame. So the proper time is imaginary, which is not possible in reality, so the proper time doesn't exist. Therefore, the two events cannot occur at the same place in any frame, which would mean that the proper time interval is not defined, or perhaps it's impossible.

But looking at the options, option F says "The two events never occur at the same place." So for part (b), that would be correct.

Wait, but the question is asking for the proper time interval between the two events. For part (a), we have Δτ=0, which would require that the events can be made to occur at the same place in some frame, but for part (b), the proper time is imaginary, so it's not possible.

Wait, but the question is giving options for each part (a) and (b), but in the problem statement, it's presented as two separate scenarios: (a) with Δt=2s and (b) with Δt=1s. So perhaps the options apply to each case.

Wait, the original question is: What is the proper time interval between these two events? Then the options are given, but without specifying (a) or (b). Wait, no, the original question says "What is the proper time interval between these two events?" and then the options are given, but the options don't specify (a) or (b). Wait, no, looking back, the problem says: "In a particular inertial reference frame S, two events occur a distance 6 × 10^8 m apart and are separated by a time interval of (a) 2 sec (b) 1 sec." So it's two separate cases: part (a) is 2 sec, part (b) is 1 sec. Then the options are given, perhaps each applies to both, but probably each part is a separate question. Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for both (a) and (b), but the options are the same for both. Hmm, but the user provided the options as a list, so perhaps each option corresponds to either (a) or (b). But looking at the options, option C says "can't be determined without velocity info," which is only true if we don't know the relative velocity, but the proper time is invariant, so it can be determined regardless of the velocity. So perhaps C is not correct.

Wait, going back to part (a): Δt=2s, Δx=6e8 m. So s²=0, so the events are lightlike. So proper time is zero. But in that case, there exists a frame where the two events happen at the same place, so the proper time is zero. So the answer would be zero, but the options don't have zero except in option G, which says "Δt' =0 and no reference frame S' can be found." That's incorrect because such a frame does exist. So perhaps the proper time is zero, but the option G is incorrect because it includes the false statement about no S' existing. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the two events. For two events that are lightlike separated, the proper time is zero because they can be made to coincide in some frame. So for part (a), the proper time is zero, but looking at the options, only option G has zero, but it says no frame exists, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the proper time in the rest frame S, but no, the proper time is the time in the frame where the events occur at the same place, which is a different frame S'.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as: in the particular frame S, what is the proper time between the events? But no, proper time is frame-independent; it's the same in all frames. So regardless of S, the proper time is calculated using the invariant s².

But in any case, for part (a), s²=0, so proper time is zero. For part (b), s² is negative, so the proper time is imaginary, which isn't possible, meaning the events are spacelike separated and cannot occur at the same place in any frame.

So for part (a), the proper time is zero, but none of the options correctly state that without the incorrect part of option G. So perhaps the correct answer is option G for part (a), but with the understanding that the second part is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is flawed.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing proper time with other concepts. Proper time is the time measured by a clock moving with the events. If the two events are at the same place in some frame, then that frame measures the proper time. But in our case, for part (a), the events are lightlike separated, so there's a frame where they are at the same place, so the proper time is zero.

So, perhaps the answer for part (a) is zero, but since option G says "no reference frame S' can be found," which is false, the correct answer isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option G, but the second part is wrong, making the option incorrect, so the correct answer would be C, which says it can't be determined without velocity info. But that doesn't make sense because proper time is an invariant and can be determined from the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The proper time is given by the invariant formula, so regardless of the frame, you can compute it. So for part (a), the proper time is zero, but since option G is the only one with zero, but the statement is wrong, perhaps the correct answer is C, which says it can't be determined without velocity info. But no, because the proper time can be determined from the given separation in S and the time interval, without needing to know the velocity of S'.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again.

For part (a), Δt=2s, Δx=6e8 m.

Proper time Δτ = sqrt( (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2 ) = sqrt(4 - (36e16)/(9e16)) = sqrt(4-4)=0.

So Δτ=0. So the proper time is zero. So in the frame where they occur at the same place, the time between them is zero. So the answer is zero, but the options don't have a correct option for this scenario. Option G says Δt'=0 and no S' exists, which is incorrect because S' does exist. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering timelike intervals, so part (a) would have a proper time of zero, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is C, which says it can't be determined without velocity info, but that's incorrect because proper time can be determined.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us compute the proper time for each case and select the correct option.

Wait, looking back, the question is: What is the proper time interval between these two events?

So for part (a), the proper time is zero. For part (b), the proper time would be imaginary, so it's impossible, meaning the events cannot be made to occur at the same place, so the proper time doesn't exist.

But looking at the options, option F says "The two events never occur at the same place," which would apply to part (b), not part (a). So perhaps the answer for part (a) is zero, but since the options don't have that correctly, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which says it can't be determined without velocity info. But that's not right because proper time is determined by the invariant interval, which doesn't require knowing the velocity.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem asks for the proper time interval between the two events. Proper time is the shortest possible time between two events, measured in the frame where they are at the same place. So for part (a), the proper time is zero. For part (b), since the interval is spacelike, the proper time is imaginary, meaning it's impossible to have a real proper time, so the events can't occur at the same place in any frame.

So for part (a), the proper time is zero, but since option G is incorrect, perhaps the answer is C, which says it can't be determined without velocity info, but that's not correct because we can determine it from the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering timelike intervals, and part (a) is a lightlike interval, so the proper time is zero, but the options don't have that correctly, so perhaps the intended answer is option C for part (a), but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider part (a) again.

Δt=2s, Δx=6e8 m.

Proper time Δτ = sqrt( (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2 ) = sqrt(4 - (6e8 /3e8)^2 )=sqrt(4-4)=0.

So Δτ=0. So the proper time is zero. So the events can be made to occur at the same place in some frame, with zero time between them. So the proper time is zero, but looking at the options, only option G mentions zero, but it also says no S' can be found, which is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have us compute the proper time for part (a) as zero and part (b) as impossible, but the options don't align perfectly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for part (a), the events are lightlike, so the proper time is zero, but in that case, the events are on the light cone, meaning they can be connected by a light signal. So for part (a), the proper time is zero, but the only option that includes zero is G, which is incorrect because S' does exist.

For part (b), Δt=1s, Δx=6e8 m.

Δt²=1, (Δx/c)^2= (6e8/3e8)^2=4.

So Δτ²=1-4=-3. So Δτ= sqrt(-3)= imaginary. Thus, the proper time is not real, meaning the events are spacelike separated, and cannot be made to occur at the same place in any frame. So the answer for part (b) would be option F: "The two events never occur at the same place."

So putting it all together:

For (a), proper time is zero, but no correct option exists because G is incorrect.

For (b), the proper time is impossible, so the answer is F.

But the question is presented as a single question with options, perhaps applying to both (a) and (b). Alternatively, perhaps the question is for each case, but the options are the same for both.

Wait, perhaps the original question is structured as two separate problems, (a) and (b), but the options are the same for both. So let me look back.

The user's question says: "What is the proper time interval between these two events?" and the options are from A to J.

Wait, perhaps the question is for each scenario (a) and (b), and the options apply to each. So perhaps the answer for (a) is zero, but since option G is incorrect, the intended answer might be C, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E or another.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of it another way. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the events. For (a), the events are lightlike separated, so in the rest frame where they are at the same place, the time is zero. So the proper time is zero, but the only option that includes zero is G, which also says no frame exists, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have the answer be option C for part (a), but that doesn't make sense because the proper time can be determined.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the options again.

Option C says: "∆t' cannot be determined without additional information about the velocity of S' relative to S."

But wait, proper time is an invariant and can be calculated from the given data without knowing the velocity of S' relative to S. So option C is incorrect.

For part (a), proper time is zero, but the only option with zero is G, which is incorrect. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F for part (b), which is correct.

Wait, but the user's question is a single question with two scenarios (a and b), and the options are given as a list. So perhaps the question is for each scenario, and the options are the same.

In that case, for part (a), the proper time is zero, but no correct option exists, and for part (b), the proper time is impossible, so the answer is F.

But the user's question is asking for the proper time interval, so perhaps the answer is F for both parts, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check part (a).

For part (a), Δt=2s, Δx=6e8 m.

So (Δt)^2 =4, (Δx/c)^2= (6e8/3e8)^2= (2)^2=4.

So (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2=0 → Δτ=0.

Yes, that's correct.

So the proper time is zero, but no option correctly states that without the incorrect part.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option G for part (a), but the second part is wrong, so the answer is not correct. But I have to choose from the options, so perhaps the intended answer is option C, but that's not correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have us compute the proper time for part (a) as zero, and the answer is option G, despite the incorrect second part. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper time is not zero, and I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me recheck the formula for proper time.

Proper time is given by Δτ = sqrt( (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2 - (Δy)^2/c^2 - (Δz)^2/c^2 ). Since in this problem, only Δx is given, and others are zero, the formula simplifies to sqrt( (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2 ).

So for part (a): Δt=2, Δx=6e8 m, c=3e8 m/s.

Δx/c = 6e8 /3e8 =2 s.

So (Δt)^2 - (Δx/c)^2 =4-4=0 → Δτ=0.

Thus, the proper time is zero.

But the options don't have a correct entry for this case.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C, but that's incorrect because the proper time can be determined.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F for part (b), but for part (a), the proper time is zero, which isn't correctly represented.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time on this. I'll proceed to the answer.
</think>

In this problem, we analyze the proper time interval between two events separated by a spatial distance of \( \Delta x = 6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) and two time intervals: (a) \( \Delta t = 2 \, \text{s} \) and (b) \( \Delta t = 1 \, \text{s} \). Proper time, \( \Delta \tau \), is calculated using the invariant spacetime interval formula:

\[
\Delta \tau = \sqrt{(\Delta t)^2 - \left(\frac{\Delta x}{c}\right)^2}
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Case (a): \( \Delta t = 2 \, \text{s} \)
1. Compute \( \Delta x / c \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta x}{c} = \frac{6 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = 2 \, \text{s}
   \]
2. Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   \Delta \tau = \sqrt{2^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \, \text{s}
   \]
   The proper time is zero, meaning the events are lightlike separated and can occur at the same place in some frame. However, **option G** states \( \Delta \tau = 0 \) but incorrectly claims no reference frame \( S' \) exists, which is false since such a frame does exist. Thus, no correct option fully describes this scenario.

### Case (b): \( \Delta t = 1 \, \text{s} \)
1. Compute \( \Delta x / c \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta x}{c} = 2 \, \text{s}
   \]
2. Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   \Delta \tau = \sqrt{1^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{1 - 4} = \sqrt{-3}
   \]
   The proper time is imaginary, indicating the events are spacelike separated and cannot occur at the same place in any frame. Thus, **option F** ("The two events never occur at the same place") is correct.

### Conclusion
For part (a), the proper time is zero, but no correct option exists due to the incorrect statement in option G. For part (b), the proper time is impossible, and the correct answer is **option F**.

Answer: F
