Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about jurisprudence, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is about who recognized the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence. The options are A through I, with names like Kelsen, Hart, Pound, Dworkin, Austin, Holland, Blackstone, Holmes, and Salmond.

First, I should recall what the terms "general" and "particular jurisprudence" mean. From what I remember, general jurisprudence refers to the broader study of the fundamental principles and structures of law, applicable to all legal systems. It's more theoretical and universal. On the other hand, particular jurisprudence deals with specific legal systems, like the law of a particular country or jurisdiction. It's more applied and detailed.

Now, I need to think about each of the options and their contributions to jurisprudence. Let's go through them one by one.

A: Kelsen. I think Kelsen was a legal positivist, known for his work on the Grundnorm, which is the basic norm underlying a legal system. He focused on the structure of legal systems, so maybe he dealt with general jurisprudence. Did he talk about the distinction between general and particular?

B: Hart. Hart is another legal positivist, and his work, "The Concept of Law," is a key text. Hart's approach is analytical and he deals with how legal systems work in general. He might be more about general jurisprudence, but I'm not sure if he specifically drew the distinction between general and particular.

C: Roscoe Pound. Pound was an American legal scholar known for his sociological jurisprudence. He emphasized the role of law in society and how it should adapt to social needs. I'm not sure if he's the one who made the distinction between general and particular.

D: Dworkin. Dworkin is a critical legal theorist who argued against legal positivism. He talks about law as a coherent set of principles. I don't recall him specifically addressing the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence.

E: Austin. John Austin was an early legal positivist, known for his work "The Province of Jurisprudence Determined." He focused on the command theory of law, where law is the command of the sovereign. His work is more about general jurisprudence, but I'm not certain if he made the distinction.

F: Holland. Herbert Holland was a British legal philosopher. He contributed to legal positivism and wrote on the nature of law. I'm not sure if he discussed the distinction between general and particular.

G: Blackstone. Sir William Blackstone is famous for his Commentaries on the Laws of England, which is a foundational text in the common law tradition. His work is more about the specifics of English law, so perhaps he's more on particular jurisprudence. But did he talk about the distinction?

H: Holmes. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., was a U.S. Supreme Court justice and legal thinker. He emphasized the predictive function of law and judicial decisions. His work is more about the practical aspects, so maybe more particular, but not sure about the distinction.

I: Salmond. John Salmond was a Scottish legal philosopher. He wrote "The Jurisprudence of Salmond," which I think distinguishes between different branches of law. He might have drawn a line between general principles and specific applications.

Wait, I think Salmond is the one who talked about the distinction. In his work, he divided jurisprudence into general and particular. General jurisprudence would be the study of the principles common to all legal systems, while particular would focus on specific systems like common law or civil law.

So, putting it together, the person who recognized the distinction is Salmond, which is option I.
