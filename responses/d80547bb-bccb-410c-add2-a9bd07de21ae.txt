Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome. The question is asking which chromosome has a deletion that causes this syndrome. The options are from A to J, each corresponding to a different chromosome number.

First, I remember that DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder. From what I've learned before, it's related to a deletion in a specific region of a chromosome. I think it's one of the chromosome 22q11 deletions. Wait, no, wait, that's another condition. Let me think again.

Oh right, DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 10. Specifically, it's a microdeletion in the 10q22-q23 region. But wait, I might be mixing it up with another syndrome. Shprintzen syndrome, I think, is another name for the same condition, sometimes called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Wait, no, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, I think DiGeorge is specifically chromosome 10. Because I remember that 22q11.2 is more commonly associated with a different condition, like maybe the velocardiofacial syndrome or something else. Let me try to recall.

DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by problems in the parathyroid glands, leading to hypoparathyroidism, and thymic hypoplasia, which affects the immune system. It's also associated with heart defects and cleft palate. The genetic cause is a deletion in chromosome 10 at band q22-q23. Shprintzen syndrome, sometimes called the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, includes features like cleft palate, heart defects, and learning disabilities, but I'm not sure if it's the same as DiGeorge.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the two. Let me think about the chromosome numbers. I'm pretty sure that DiGeorge is on chromosome 10, while the 22q11.2 deletion is a different syndrome. So the question is about DiGeorge/Shprintzen, which I think are the same thing, so the answer should be chromosome 10.

Looking back at the options, option D is 10. So the answer should be D.
