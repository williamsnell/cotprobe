Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly identifies what the principle of military necessity belongs to in just war theory. Let me start by recalling what I know about just war theory.

I remember that just war theory has several principles that guide the ethical conduct of war. There are three main categories: jus ad bellum, jus in bello, and jus post bellum. Jus ad bellum refers to the justice of going to war in the first place, while jus in bello deals with the conduct during war, and jus post bellum concerns the aftermath of war.

The principle of military necessity is something I think falls under jus in bello. It relates to the idea that in war, certain actions are necessary to achieve a legitimate military objective, even if they cause significant harm. But I should make sure I'm not confusing it with other principles.

Looking at the options, option G is jus in bello, which seems to fit. Let me check the others to be thorough. Option I is jus ad bellum, which is about the reasons for war, like having just cause. Option H is jus post bellum, which deals with the end of war and peace. So those are out.

Options A, F, and J refer to other principles or theories. Proportionality (A) is also a jus in bello principle, but the question is about necessity. Right intention (F) is part of jus ad bellum. Moral relativism (D) and moral nihilism (E) don't seem related to just war theory's structure.

So the correct answer should be G: jus in bello.
