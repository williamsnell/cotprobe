Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about factors that impact moral intensity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember that moral intensity has to do with how strongly people perceive the morality of an issue. So the question is asking which three factors influence that.

I remember something about different dimensions affecting how we view moral issues. Let me think... I think the factors are related to things like social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity. Wait, what's the difference between social and cultural here? Oh right, social consensus refers to how much agreement there is in society about the issue, while cultural might be more about cultural norms but I'm not sure if that's one of the main factors.

Temporal immediacy is about how soon the consequences of the action happen. If something has immediate effects, it feels more intense morally. Proximity, I believe, refers to how close the issue is geographically or personally. So things that are happening nearby or affect people close to us have higher moral intensity.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that includes these three: social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Social dissensus, Cultural immediacy, Proximity. Hmm, social dissensus is the opposite of consensus. If society doesn't agree, does that increase moral intensity? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Cultural immediacy isn't a term I recall. So probably not A.

Option B: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. This seems to match what I was thinking. All three are factors I remember reading about. Let me check others to be sure.

Option C: Temporal consensus, Social immediacy, Proximity. Wait, temporal consensus doesn't sound right. I think it's more about the immediacy of time, not consensus. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Social consensus, Spatial immediacy, Proximity. Spatial immediacy isn't a term I recognize. It's usually temporal immediacy, so D is out.

Option E: Proximity, Cultural dissensus, Temporal immediacy. So proximity is correct, but cultural dissensus might not be the main factor. I think social consensus is more relevant than cultural dissensus here.

Option F: Proximity, Social consensus, Temporal dissensus. Temporal dissensus doesn't make sense. It's about immediacy, not dissensus.

Option G: Cultural consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. Cultural consensus isn't the main factor; it's social consensus that matters more in moral intensity.

Option H: Proximity, Temporal immediacy, Social dissensus. Social dissensus might actually decrease moral intensity because if society isn't in agreement, it's less clear-cut. So H might not be correct.

Option I: Proximity, Social dissensus, Futility of effect. Futility of effect isn't something I remember as a main factor. It's more about whether the action can make a difference.

Option J: Social dissensus, Temporal immediacy, Distance. Distance is the opposite of proximity. So if something is distant, it might have lower moral intensity. But this option has social dissensus and distance, which don't align with what I know.

So, the correct answer should be option B: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity.
</think>

The factors that impact moral intensity include social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity. These elements determine how strongly an issue is perceived morally. Social consensus refers to societal agreement, temporal immediacy to the timing of consequences, and proximity to the closeness of the issue. Among the options, B correctly includes these three factors.

Answer: B
