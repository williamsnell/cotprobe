Question:

Select the best translation into predicate logic: Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name.

Options:

A: Sy ≡ Bl
B: Sy ⊃ Bl
C: Bx ⊃ Sy
D: Bl ⊃ Sk
E: Bx ≡ Sy
F: Sk ⊃ By
G: Sk ⊃ Bx
H: Sk ≡ Bl
I: By ≡ Sk
J: Bl ≡ Sk

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out the best translation of the sentence "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name" into predicate logic. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in predicate logic, "only if" statements are a bit tricky. I think "A only if B" translates to A implies B, or A → B. So, the structure is that if A happens, then B must happen. So, the statement is saying that Leroy being bad (A) only if DJ Khaled shouts his name (B). So, that would be A → B.

Now, I need to identify the predicates here. Let's parse the sentence:

- "Leroy is bad" → This is the subject, so it's a predicate about Leroy. Let's denote "Bl" where B stands for 'is bad' and l is Leroy.
- "DJ Khaled shouts his name" → This is another predicate. Let's denote "Sk" where S is 'shouts' and k is DJ Khaled, and perhaps an argument for the name, but maybe it's just "Sk" as a shorthand.

So, the original statement is "Bl only if Sk". Using the earlier logic, "A only if B" becomes A → B. So Bl → Sk.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches Bl → Sk. Let's look at each option:

A: Sy ≡ Bl → This is equivalence, meaning Sy and Bl are the same. Doesn't fit.
B: Sy ⊃ Bl → If Sy then Bl. Not what we need.
C: Bx ⊃ Sy → If Bx then Sy. Not relevant.
D: Bl ⊃ Sk → If Bl then Sk. This matches our translation.
E: Bx ≡ Sy → Equivalence again.
F: Sk ⊃ By → If Sk then By. Opposite direction.
G: Sk ⊃ Bx → If Sk then Bx. Opposite direction.
H: Sk ≡ Bl → Equivalence.
I: By ≡ Sk → Equivalence.
J: Bl ≡ Sk → Equivalence.

So, the correct translation is Bl → Sk, which is option D: Bl ⊃ Sk.

The sentence "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name" translates to Bl → Sk in predicate logic, which corresponds to option D. 

Answer: D
