Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read it again carefully. The uncle owns his property in fee simple, which means he has the highest form of ownership possible. He then executes a deed with a specific granting clause: "To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener." I need to determine what each person's ownership rights are.

Hmm, I remember that in property law, when someone conveys property using a deed, the language of the granting clause determines the type of estates created. So, I need to break down the grant step by step.

First, the grant is to "my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew." So, the nephew and niece are getting an estate that ends when the nephew dies. That sounds like a life estate, but it's tied to the nephew's life, not another person's. Wait, no, a life estate can be either "for life" or "for the life of someone else." So in this case, it's for the life of the nephew. That would make it a life estate pur autre vie, meaning it's measured by the life of another person, which is the nephew here.

But wait, the grant is to both the nephew and niece. So are they joint tenants or tenants in common? The wording says "for the life of my nephew," which implies that both have an interest that ends when the nephew dies. If the grant had said "to A and B until the death of C," that would be a joint life estate, but here it's tied to the nephew's life. So both the nephew and niece have a life estate pur autre vie, because it's based on the nephew's life. But wait, the nephew is the one whose life it's tied to, so he would have a life estate, and the niece's interest would depend on whether she's a joint tenant or a tenant in common.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The grant says "to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew." So the estate they get is for the duration of the nephew's life. So the nephew has a life estate pur autre vie (his own life), and the niece also has a life estate, but tied to the same duration. So both have life estates, but when the nephew dies, the estate ends for both. So they're both life tenants, but their estates end at the same time. So they are joint tenants with the same life estate, but I'm not sure if that's a joint tenancy or something else.

Wait, no. In a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship applies. So if they are joint tenants in a life estate, when one dies, the other takes their interest. But in this case, the life estate ends when the nephew dies, so the niece's interest would end at the same time. That doesn't make sense because if it's a joint tenancy, the survivor would take the entire estate. But the grant says that after the nephew's life, it goes to the gardener. So maybe the nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the nephew. Because if they were joint tenants, the survivor would have the entire estate, but the grant specifies that after the nephew's life, it goes to the gardener, meaning the niece's interest ends when the nephew dies. So perhaps they are tenants in common, each holding a life estate that ends when the nephew dies.

Wait, but the wording is "for the life of my nephew." That suggests that the duration is the nephew's life, so both the nephew and niece have a life estate pur autre vie, but both are subject to the same measuring life. So they each have a life estate, but their interests are tied to the nephew's life. So, when the nephew dies, both their estates end. But that seems a bit odd because the niece's interest would end when the nephew dies, regardless of her own life. So their estates are both for the nephew's life, making them tenants in common, each with a life estate pur autre vie.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: a life estate is an interest that ends at a specific time, like the death of a person. If the grant is to A and B for the life of A, then A has a life estate pur autre vie (his own life), and B has a life estate as well, but it's also tied to A's life. So both have life estates that end when A dies. So when A dies, both A's and B's estates end, and the next interest takes over.

In this case, after the nephew's life, the property goes to the gardener. So the gardener has the remainder. Now, what kind of remainder is that?

The grant is "to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener." So the remainder is after the life estate ends, which is the nephew's life. So the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple. Because the remainder is certain to occur when the life estate ends; it's not subject to any conditions. So the gardener's interest is a vested remainder because it's guaranteed once the life estate terminates.

Wait, but the granting clause is "then to my gardener." So it's a remainder that follows the life estate, which is vested because it's not subject to any conditions. So the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one fits this scenario.

Option A says: Nephew has a life estate pur autre vie, niece has a vested remainder, gardener has a life estate. No, that doesn't fit because the gardener has a vested remainder, not a life estate.

Option B: Nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first to die, etc. No, because the life estate is tied to the nephew's life, not the first to die.

Option C: Nephew and niece are joint tenants with rights of survivorship, gardener has a contingent remainder. No, because the remainder is vested, not contingent.

Option D: Nephew and niece are tenants in common, gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple. Hmm, that could be possible. Because the nephew and niece each have a life estate tied to the nephew's life, making them tenants in common, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Option H: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, gardener has a vested remainder. Wait, no, because the grant is for the life of the nephew, so the niece's estate is also tied to the nephew's life, making it a life estate, not pur autre vie.

Wait, the nephew's estate is for his own life, so it's a life estate pur autre vie. The niece's estate is also for the nephew's life, so it's a life estate, but not pur autre vie because it's based on the nephew's life. Wait, no, a life estate can be either based on the grantor's life (life estate in being), or based on another person's life (pur autre vie). So, if the grant is "for the life of X," then both A and B have life estates pur autre vie, with X being the nephew.

So the nephew and niece both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple.

Looking at the options, option H says: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and gardener has a vested remainder. Wait, that would mean the nephew's estate is for his own life (pur autre vie), and the niece's is also pur autre vie. But the grant is "for the life of my nephew," so both have life estates pur autre vie. So that would be option H? Or option J?

Wait, option J says: Nephew has a life estate, niece also has a life estate, and gardener has a vested remainder. So that would mean both have life estates, but it doesn't specify whether they are pur autre vie. But in this case, it's tied to the nephew's life, so both have life estates pur autre vie.

Looking back at the options, option H says the nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and gardener has a vested remainder. But that's inconsistent because the grant is tied to the nephew's life, so both should have life estates pur autre vie.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The grant is to nephew and niece "for the life of my nephew." So the duration is the nephew's life. Therefore, both have life estates pur autre vie, because it's based on the nephew's life. So the nephew's life estate is pur autre vie (his own life), and the niece's is also pur autre vie, because it's based on the nephew's life. So both have life estates pur autre vie.

After that, the property goes to the gardener. So the gardener has a vested remainder because the prior estate is a life estate, which will definitely end at the nephew's death. A vested remainder is one that is certain to occur, without any conditions. So the gardener's remainder is vested in fee simple.

Now, looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option H says: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, gardener has a vested remainder. But if both have life estates pur autre vie, then perhaps option H isn't correct because it only says the niece has pur autre vie, but the nephew's is just a life estate.

Wait, no. The nephew's life estate is pur autre vie because it's based on his own life. So both have life estates pur autre vie. So the correct answer would be that both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Looking at the options, option H says: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, gardener has a vested remainder. But the nephew's estate is also pur autre vie, so that's not accurate. So perhaps the correct option is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at option H again: "The nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder." That can't be right because the nephew's estate is also pur autre vie.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The nephew's life estate is pur autre vie because it's based on his own life. The niece's life estate is also pur autre vie because it's based on the nephew's life. So both have life estates pur autre vie. Now, looking at the options, which one says that?

Option H doesn't, because it says the nephew has a life estate and the niece has a life estate pur autre vie. So perhaps none of the options directly say that, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the niece's estate is a vested remainder, not a life estate. Let me think again. The grant is "to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener." So the nephew and niece get an estate for the life of the nephew. That's a life estate. The gardener gets the remainder. So the nephew and niece both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple.

So the correct option would be: nephew and niece both have life estates pur autre vie, gardener has a vested remainder.

Looking at the options, option H says: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and gardener has a vested remainder. But that would mean the nephew's estate is a simple life estate, not pur autre vie, which contradicts because it's based on the nephew's life.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the grant is to both nephew and niece for the life of the nephew. So both have a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. So looking at the options, H says the gardener has a vested remainder, which is correct, but the issue is whether the nephew and niece have both life estates pur autre vie.

Looking again, option H says the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. That can't be correct because the nephew's life estate is also pur autre vie.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct option is J, which says the nephew and niece have life estates, and the gardener has a vested remainder. But J doesn't specify whether the life estates are pur autre vie.

Wait, the options don't all specify. Let me check each option again.

Option H: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, gardener has a vested remainder. So the nephew's estate is a life estate, not pur autre vie, which is incorrect because it's based on his own life. So H is wrong.

Option J: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate, gardener has a vested remainder. But this doesn't specify that they are pur autre vie, which they are. So J is incorrect because it doesn't capture that detail.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: the grant is to the nephew and niece "for the life of my nephew." So the duration is the nephew's life. So both have life estates that end when the nephew dies. So they each have a life estate pur autre vie. So the correct option should reflect that both have life estates pur autre vie.

Looking at the options, option H says the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie. That's not correct because the nephew's estate is also pur autre vie.

Option J: Both have life estates, but again, it doesn't specify pur autre vie.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the grant is to both for the life of the nephew, so both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. So the answer should be that both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Looking at the options, option H says the gardener has a vested remainder, but it only attributes the niece as having a life estate pur autre vie, which is incorrect because the nephew also has that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H, but I think I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, maybe the answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's option H.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the nephew and niece are joint tenants. If they are joint tenants, then the survivor would take the entire estate, but in this case, the estate ends when the nephew dies, so that can't be. So they must be tenants in common. So both have life estates, but they are tenants in common, not joint tenants.

So the correct option would be that the nephew and niece are tenants in common, each with a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Looking at the options, option D says: Nephew and niece are tenants in common, gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple. Yes, that fits. Because the gardener's remainder is vested, and the nephew and niece are tenants in common with life estates pur autre vie.

Wait, but option D says the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple, which is correct. And the nephew and niece are tenants in common, each with a life estate pur autre vie.

So the correct answer would be option H or D? Wait, option D doesn't specify that the life estates are pur autre vie, but it does say the gardener has a vested remainder. Hmm.

Wait, option H says the gardener has a vested remainder, which is correct, but it only attributes the niece's estate as pur autre vie, not the nephew's.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The grant is to the nephew and niece for the life of the nephew. So the duration is the nephew's life, making both the nephew and niece have life estates pur autre vie. The gardener gets the remainder, which is vested because it's certain to occur when the life estate ends.

So the options must reflect that both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Looking again, option H says the gardener has a vested remainder, which is correct, but it says the nephew has a life estate, not pur autre vie, which is incorrect.

Option J says both have life estates, but not specifying pur autre vie, which is incorrect.

Option G says both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a contingent remainder. No, because the remainder is vested.

Option H is the closest, but it's incorrect about the nephew's estate. So perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the best fit is H, even though it's technically incorrect about the nephew's estate.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the grant creates a joint life estate. Let me think: if the grant is to A and B for the life of A, then A has a life estate pur autre vie, and B has a life estate pur autre vie as well, because it's based on A's life. So both have life estates pur autre vie. Then, after A's death, the property goes to the remainderman.

In that case, the correct answer would be that both have life estates pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. So looking at the options, option H doesn't capture that because it only attributes the niece's estate as pur autre vie.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because the gardener's remainder is vested, and the options don't perfectly capture the nephew's estate.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H. Because the options might not be perfect, but H is the closest.

The question involves interpreting the ownership rights created by a deed granting property "to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener." The key is to analyze the type of estates created for each party.

1. **Nephew and Niece's Estates**: The grant is "for the life of my nephew," which creates life estates pur autre vie for both the nephew and niece. This means their interests are tied to the nephew's life, and both estates will terminate when the nephew dies.

2. **Gardener's Remainder**: After the life estates of the nephew and niece end, the property goes to the gardener. This creates a vested remainder in fee simple for the gardener because the remainder is certain to occur upon the termination of the prior life estates.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option H**: States that the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. While the gardener's vested remainder is correct, the option incorrectly describes the nephew's estate as a simple life estate instead of a life estate pur autre vie.
   - **Option J**: States that both the nephew and niece have life estates, but it does not specify that these are life estates pur autre vie, making it incomplete.
   - **Other Options**: Either mischaracterize the type of estates or the nature of the gardener's interest.

Given the options, **Option H** is the closest, as it correctly identifies the gardener's vested remainder, even though it inaccurately describes the nephew's estate. None of the options perfectly capture the analysis, but **Option H** is the most accurate.
