Question:

Toward the end of the Pleistocene, between 28,000 and 18,000 years ago, worldwide sea level was much lower than present day, resulting in the exposure of a landmass east of Siberia called __________. This period is called the _______.

Options:

A: Beringia; Late Beringian Period
B: Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum
C: Sundaland; Late Laurentide Period
D: Wallacea; McKenzie Maximum
E: Wallacea; Late Glacial Maximum
F: Wallacea; Late Laurentide Period
G: Beringia; Last Glacial Period
H: Sundaland; Late Beringian Period
I: Sundaland; McKenzie Maximum
J: Beringia; McKenzie Maximum

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a landmass that was exposed during the Pleistocene. Hmm, the time frame is between 28,000 and 18,000 years ago. I remember that during the Pleistocene, especially towards the end, there were periods of lower sea levels because of ice ages. 

The question says that the sea level was much lower, so a landmass east of Siberia was exposed. From what I've studied, I think that area is called Beringia. Beringia is the region that includes the Bering Land Bridge, which connected Siberia to Alaska during the last glacial maximum. So the first blank should be Beringia.

Now, the second part is about the period this refers to. The options have terms like Late Beringian Period, Late Glacial Maximum, etc. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was around 20,000 to 24,000 years ago, but the time frame here is 28,000 to 18,000. Wait, that's a bit earlier. Or maybe I'm mixing up the periods. 

Wait, the Last Glacial Period is also known as the Wisconsinan in North America, but globally it's called the Last Glacial Period. The Last Glacial Maximum was the peak around 20,000 years ago. So the period between 28,000 and 18,000 would cover the time leading up to the LGM and then the retreat. So maybe it's called the Late Glacial Maximum? Or perhaps it's part of the Last Glacial Period.

Looking at the options, option G says Beringia and Last Glacial Period. Option A says Late Beringian Period, which I'm not sure about. Option B is Beringia and Late Glacial Maximum. Hmm. I think the Last Glacial Maximum is the peak, so the period leading up to it might be called the Late Glacial. Alternatively, the term "Late Glacial Maximum" isn't as common as "Last Glacial Maximum." Wait, maybe "Late Glacial" refers to the time after the peak, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the Last Glacial Period is the entire glacial period, which includes the maximum. So perhaps the correct term is the Last Glacial Period. So looking at the options, option G is Beringia and Last Glacial Period. That seems right because the exposure happened during that time.

Another option, A, says Late Beringian Period, which I'm not as familiar with. I think Beringia is the region, and the period is the Last Glacial Period. So I'm leaning towards option G.

The correct answer is **G: Beringia; Last Glacial Period**. During the Last Glacial Period, sea levels were lower, exposing the Beringia landmass east of Siberia.

Answer: G
