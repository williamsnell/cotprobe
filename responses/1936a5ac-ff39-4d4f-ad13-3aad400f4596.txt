Question:

A 51-year-old man comes to the office because of a 6-month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating; he also has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss during this period. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?

Options:

A: Parotid
B: Retropharyngeal
C: Subclavian
D: Submental
E: Supraclavicular
F: Popliteal
G: Inferior deep cervical
H: Preauricular
I: Axillary
J: Inguinal

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which lymph node to evaluate first for metastasis in this patient. Let's see, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a lump on his tongue that's been there for six months. He's having trouble with speech and eating, and he's lost 6.8 kg, which is significant. He's a smoker and drinks beer regularly, so that might be relevant.

The lump is a squamous cell carcinoma, which makes sense because the tongue is a common site for that type of cancer, especially with smoking history. Now, when a tumor is in the tongue, I remember that lymphatic drainage is important for metastasis. 

I'm a bit fuzzy on the lymph node drainage areas of the head and neck. So, the tongue's lymphatic drainage mainly goes to the submental and submandibular nodes, right? Submental is under the chin, and submandibular is near the angle of the mandible. Wait, but the question is about the first lymph node to evaluate when there's a tongue tumor.

I think for tongue cancers, the primary lymphatic drainage is to the submental and submandibular nodes. But wait, submandibular is more on the side, and submental is more central. So the submental nodes are the first to check. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the deep cervical nodes are also involved, but maybe those are more for later stages.

Wait, the options are submental (D), supraclavicular (E), and inferior deep cervical (G). So, the submental is under the chin, which is close to the tongue. If the primary lymphatic drainage is the submental, that's the first place to look for metastasis. So the question is asking which to evaluate first, so probably the submental nodes.

Another thought: sometimes the deep cervical nodes (like the inferior deep cervical) are part of the chain that drains the tongue. But I think in the initial evaluation, the submental is more directly involved. Also, the supramandibular or retropharyngeal might not be the first choice.

Wait, the retropharyngeal nodes are in the back of the throat, so maybe not the first place. The subclavian is higher up, but I think that's more for other areas like the breast or arms. Axillary and inguinal are definitely not relevant here. Parotid is for the face and parotid area, not the tongue.

So, putting it all together, the submental nodes are the first to check for metastasis from a tongue tumor. So the answer should be D: Submental.

The patient is a 51-year-old man with a squamous cell carcinoma on the tongue, a common site for such cancers, especially given his smoking history. Lymphatic drainage from the tongue primarily flows to the submental and submandibular nodes. Among these, the submental nodes are the most relevant for initial evaluation of metastasis due to their proximity to the tongue. Other nodes, such as the retropharyngeal, supraclavicular, or deep cervical, are less immediately relevant in this context. Therefore, the submental nodes are the first to evaluate.

Answer: D
