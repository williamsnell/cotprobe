Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Euler circuits in undirected graphs. Hmm, I remember that an Euler circuit is a path that uses every edge exactly once and starts and ends at the same vertex. I think it's also called an Eulerian circuit. 

The question asks which of the given graphs must have an Euler circuit. The options are I, II, and III. Let me break them down one by one.

First, option I is a complete graph with 12 vertices. A complete graph means every vertex is connected to every other vertex. I remember that for a graph to have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degrees. Because each time you enter a vertex, you must exit, so each visit uses two edges. So, in a complete graph with n vertices, each vertex has degree (n-1). 

Let me calculate the degree for each vertex in a complete graph of 12 vertices. So, each vertex is connected to 11 others. 11 is an odd number. Oh wait, that means in a complete graph with 12 vertices, all vertices have odd degrees. But wait, I thought for an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degrees. So that means a complete graph with 12 vertices doesn't have an Euler circuit because all its vertices have odd degrees. So option I can't have an Euler circuit. 

Wait, but wait a second. No, wait, no. Wait, the definition says that for an Eulerian circuit to exist, all vertices must have even degrees. So if any vertex has an odd degree, the graph can't have an Eulerian circuit. So in a complete graph with 12 vertices, each vertex has degree 11, which is odd. Therefore, there are 12 vertices each with odd degrees. So that graph doesn't have an Eulerian circuit. So I is not a graph that must have an Euler circuit.

Next, option II is a complete graph with 13 vertices. Let me check the degrees here. Each vertex is connected to 12 others. So each vertex has degree 12, which is even. Because 12 is even, all vertices have even degrees. So this graph satisfies the condition for having an Euler circuit. So II must have an Euler circuit.

Option III is a tree with 13 vertices. Wait, trees are connected acyclic graphs. I remember that in a tree, all vertices except two have degree 1, and the rest have higher degrees. Wait, no, actually, in a tree with n vertices, there are (n-1) edges. And a tree has exactly two vertices of degree 1, and the others have degrees >=2. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, no. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges, and at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1). So in a tree with 13 vertices, there are 12 edges. So each vertex, except for two, has at least degree 2. But wait, the degrees: let's see. The sum of degrees in any graph is 2*(number of edges). So for a tree with 13 vertices, sum of degrees is 2*(12) = 24. So if we have two vertices of degree 1, the remaining 11 vertices must have degrees adding up to 24 - 2 = 22. So 11 vertices with sum 22 degrees, which would average around 2 each. So most would be degree 2, perhaps a few with higher. But regardless, in a tree, there are exactly two vertices with degree 1, and the others have degrees >=2.

But wait, for an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degrees. So in a tree, we have two vertices with degree 1 (which is odd). So in any tree, there are at least two vertices with odd degrees. So that means, a tree cannot have an Euler circuit because it has vertices with odd degrees. So option III cannot have an Euler circuit. So which of the options must have an Euler circuit? Only II.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the question is which of these must have an Euler circuit. So I is a complete graph with 12 vertices: each vertex has degree 11, which is odd. So I doesn't have an Euler circuit. II is a complete graph with 13 vertices: each vertex has degree 12, even. So II has an Euler circuit. III is a tree with 13 vertices: has two vertices with degree 1 (odd), so no Euler circuit.

The options given are:

I. Complete 12 vertices: No.

II. Complete 13 vertices: Yes.

III. Tree 13 vertices: No.

So the options are:

A: A complete graph with 11 vertices. Wait, the question is about I, II, III. Wait, the options are A through J, which are the possible combinations.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, with each being a possible combination. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: A complete graph with 11 vertices. Hmm, but the question is about I, II, III, so I think the options are about which of I, II, III must have Euler circuits.

Wait, looking back, the question lists I, II, III, and the options are A-J, where each option refers to which of these must have an Euler circuit.

Wait, the options are:

A: A complete graph with 11 vertices → So this would be a different graph from I, II, III. So perhaps the options are possible selections of the given I, II, III.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Which of the following undirected graphs must have an Euler circuit?

I. A complete graph with 12 vertices

II. A complete graph with 13 vertices

III. A tree with 13 vertices

Then the options are:

A: A complete graph with 11 vertices

B: III only

C: I and II

D: None of the above

E: II and III

F: All of the above

G: I only

H: II only

I: I and III

J: A tree with 12 vertices

Ah, so each option (A-J) is a possible combination, but the question is about I, II, III. So perhaps the options are which of the statements I, II, III must have an Euler circuit.

Wait, no. Wait, the options are possible answers, each selecting which of I, II, III must have an Euler circuit.

Wait, no. Let me reevaluate. The question is, which of the given graphs (I, II, III) must have an Euler circuit.

So the possible answers are:

A: I only (complete 11) → but wait, the options don't seem to match. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, with each being a possible combination of graphs I, II, III.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

Looking again:

Options:

A: A complete graph with 11 vertices → So this is a different graph, not I, II, or III.

B: III only → So only III must have an Euler circuit.

C: I and II → So both I and II must have Euler circuits.

D: None of the above → None of I, II, III must have an Euler circuit.

E: II and III → Both II and III must have.

F: All of the above → All I, II, III must have.

G: I only → Only I.

H: II only → Only II.

I: I and III → I and III.

J: A tree with 12 vertices → So this is another graph, not part of I, II, III.

But the question is about which of I, II, III must have an Euler circuit. So the options are about whether:

I. Complete 12 → No.

II. Complete 13 → Yes.

III. Tree 13 → No.

So among the options, the correct answer would be that only II must have an Euler circuit. Looking at the options, H is "II only".

Wait, but let me check the options again. For example, option H is "II only". So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but earlier I thought that I (complete 12) has all vertices with odd degrees (11), so no Euler circuit. II (complete 13) has all vertices with even degrees (12), so yes. III (tree 13) has two vertices with degree 1 (odd), so no.

So the only graph that must have an Euler circuit is II. So the correct option is H: II only.

The question asks which of the given undirected graphs must have an Euler circuit. An Euler circuit exists in a graph if and only if all vertices have even degrees. 

1. **I. A complete graph with 12 vertices**: Each vertex has degree 11, which is odd. Since all vertices must have even degrees for an Euler circuit, this graph does not have one.

2. **II. A complete graph with 13 vertices**: Each vertex has degree 12, which is even. Since all vertices meet the requirement, this graph has an Euler circuit.

3. **III. A tree with 13 vertices**: A tree has exactly two vertices of degree 1 (odd) and the rest have higher degrees. Since there are vertices with odd degrees, this graph does not have an Euler circuit.

Thus, only II must have an Euler circuit.

Answer: H
