Okay, let's try to figure out how many floors the building has. The problem says each story is 14.3 feet tall, and the total height of the building is 185.9 feet. So I need to find out how many times 14.3 feet fits into 185.9 feet.

Hmm, so I think I should divide the total height by the height per story. That makes sense because if each floor is a certain height, dividing the total by per floor gives the number of floors.

Let me write that down: 185.9 divided by 14.3. I'm not sure about the exact division, but I can try to calculate it step by step.

First, maybe I can approximate the numbers to make it easier. 14.3 is close to 14, and 185.9 is almost 186. So 186 divided by 14. Let me see, 14 times 13 is 182, because 14*10=140, 14*3=42, so 140+42=182. Then 186 minus 182 is 4, so that would be 13 with a remainder of 4. So approximately 13.285, but since we're dealing with real floors, you can't have a fraction of a floor, so it would be 13 floors. But wait, that's just an approximation. I should do the exact calculation.

Let me do the exact division: 185.9 รท 14.3.

I can set it up as 14.3 ) 185.9

Alternatively, to make it easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimals. So that becomes 1859 รท 143.

Now, let's do this division: 143 into 1859.

143 goes into 185 once because 143*1=143. Subtracting gives 185-143=42. Bring down the 9, making it 429.

Now, how many times does 143 go into 429? Let's see: 143*2=286, 143*3=429 exactly. So 3 times. So that would make 13 times (1 from 185 and 3 from 429), so 13 times with no remainder.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when we multiplied both by 10, the result should be the same as the original division. So 1859 รท 143 equals 13 exactly, so 185.9 รท14.3 is 13.

So the building has 13 floors. Looking at the options, H is 13. So the answer should be H.
