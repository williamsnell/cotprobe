Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a potato moving under Earth's gravity with air resistance. There are two parts, (a) and (b), and a bunch of options to choose from. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Starting with part (a): Find the terminal velocity when the potato is released from rest, and k is 0.01 s⁻¹. I remember that terminal velocity is the maximum velocity an object reaches when the forces acting on it balance out. So at terminal velocity, the gravitational force pulling down should equal the air resistance pushing up.

The mass of the potato is 0.5 kg. The gravitational force would be mass times gravity, which is m * g. Gravity on Earth is approximately 9.8 m/s², so that's 0.5 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me calculate that: 0.5 * 9.8 is 4.9 N. So the gravitational force is 4.9 N downward.

The air resistive force is given as -k m v. The negative sign indicates it's opposite in direction to the velocity. Since the potato is moving downward, the air resistance is upward. At terminal velocity, the magnitude of air resistance equals the gravitational force. So setting them equal: k m v_terminal = m g.

Wait, but wait. The direction matters. If the potato is moving downward, the air resistance is upward, so the forces balance when k m v (downward?) No, actually, when moving downward, the air resistance is opposite to the motion, so it's upward, and gravity is downward. So the equation should be m g = k m v_terminal. The mass m cancels out from both sides, so v_terminal = g / k.

Plugging in the numbers: g is 9.8 m/s², and k is 0.01 s⁻¹. So 9.8 divided by 0.01 is 980 m/s. Hmm, looking at the options, I don't see 980. The closest options are A:800, J:900. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no! Wait a second, I think I messed up the formula. Because sometimes the formula for terminal velocity when considering upward motion is different. Let me think again. Wait, no, the formula v_t = mg/(kv) is correct because when the potato is falling, the net force is zero when m g equals k m v_t. So yeah, v_t = g/k.

So 9.8 / 0.01 = 980. But the options don't have 980. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the potato moving upward, but no, part (a) says it's released from rest, so it's falling. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem uses a different value for g, like 10 m/s² for simplicity. Let me try that. If g is 10, then 10 / 0.01 is 1000 m/s. Looking at the options, E is 1000 m/s. So perhaps that's the answer for part (a). But I thought g was about 9.8. Maybe the problem approximates g as 10. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another point: when the potato is moving upward, the air resistance is opposite to the motion, so it's downward. But part (a) is when it's released from rest, so it's moving downward. So the calculation should be correct. So if the problem uses g=10, then E is 1000 m/s. But I'm not sure, because the problem gives m=0.5 kg, so maybe it expects g=9.8.

Wait, maybe I should proceed to part (b) first and see if that helps. Let me think about part (b): Find the maximum height of the potato if it's shot upward with an initial velocity of 120 m/s with the same k. Oh, this part is about projectile motion under air resistance. Hmm.

I know that without air resistance, the maximum height would be v_initial squared over (2g), but with air resistance, it's more complicated. The problem here is that the presence of air resistance will reduce the maximum height compared to the case without air resistance.

But how do I approach this? Maybe using energy methods, but air resistance does non-conservative work, so it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the motion using differential equations.

The equation of motion when moving upward (against gravity and air resistance) is:

m dv/dt = -mg - k v

This can be rewritten as dv/dt = -g - (k/m) v

This is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution would involve integrating both sides. Let me write it as:

dv/dt + (k/m) v = -g

The integrating factor is e^(∫(k/m) dt) = e^(kt/m).

Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor:

e^(kt/m) dv/dt + (k/m) e^(kt/m) v = -g e^(kt/m)

The left side is d/dt [v e^(kt/m)].

Integrating both sides from t=0 to t when v=0 (since at max height, velocity is zero):

∫ d/dt [v e^(kt/m)] dt = ∫ -g e^(kt/m) dt

So,

v e^(kt/m) = -g m/k [e^(kt/m) - 1]

Wait, let me check the integration. The integral of e^(kt/m) dt is (m/k) e^(kt/m) + C.

So, the integral from 0 to t of -g e^(kt/m) dt is:

- g ∫ e^(kt/m) dt from 0 to t = -g [ (m/k) e^(kt/m) - (m/k) e^0 ) ] = -g (m/k) (e^(kt/m) - 1 )

So,

v e^(kt/m) = - (g m/k) (e^(kt/m) - 1 )

Wait, but wait, when t=0, v=v0=120 m/s. But when we reach max height, v=0 at time t=T. So let's set the limits correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to solve the equation from t=0 to t=T, where at t=T, v=0.

So,

v e^(kt/m) = ∫ from 0 to T of -g e^(kt/m) dt

Wait, perhaps I should write the solution correctly. The general solution for this DE is:

v(t) = [ v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-kt/m) - (m g)/k

Yes, I've seen this solution before. So, when the potato reaches max height, v=0. So,

0 = [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-k T/m) - (m g)/k

Rearranging:

[ v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-k T/m) = (m g)/k

Divide both sides by [ v0 + (m g)/k ]:

e^(-k T/m) = (m g)/(k [ v0 + (m g)/k ])

Simplify the denominator on the right:

= (m g) / (k v0 + m g )

So,

e^(-k T/m) = (m g) / (k v0 + m g )

Take natural log on both sides:

- k T/m = ln [ (m g) / (k v0 + m g) ]

Multiply both sides by (-m/k):

T = (m/k) * ln [ (k v0 + m g ) / (m g) ) ]

But perhaps a better approach is to find the time taken to reach max height and then integrate velocity over time to find height. Alternatively, perhaps using the equation for velocity as a function of time and then integrating.

Alternatively, perhaps using the equation for velocity as a function of height. Let me try that. The equation of motion can also be written using dv/ds, since a = dv/dt = dv/ds * ds/dt = dv/ds * v.

So,

m dv/dt = -m g - k v

Divide both sides by m:

dv/dt = -g - (k/m) v

But dv/dt = dv/ds * ds/dt = dv/ds * v

So,

v dv/ds = -g - (k/m) v

Rearranging:

v dv/ds + (k/m) v = -g

Hmm, this might be more complicated. Alternatively, I can write it as:

v dv = [ -g - (k/m) v ] ds

But perhaps integrating from v0 to 0 (at max height) and from s=0 to s=h_max.

So,

∫ from v0 to 0 of v dv = ∫ from 0 to h_max of [ -g - (k/m) v ] ds

But this might get complicated because v is a function of s. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the expression for velocity as a function of time and then integrate to find the height.

Wait, let's go back to the velocity equation:

v(t) = [v0 + (m g)/k] e^(-kt/m) - (m g)/k

We can find the time T when v=0:

0 = [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-k T/m) - (m g)/k

=> [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-k T/m) = (m g)/k

Divide both sides by [v0 + (m g)/k]:

e^(-k T/m) = (m g)/(k [ v0 + (m g)/k ]) )

Simplify denominator on the right:

= (m g) / (k v0 + m g )

So,

e^(-k T/m) = (m g) / (k v0 + m g )

Take natural log:

- k T/m = ln [ (m g) / (k v0 + m g) ) ]

So,

T = - (m/k) * ln [ (m g) / (k v0 + m g) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps we can compute this T and then integrate v(t) from 0 to T to find the maximum height.

The height h_max is ∫ from 0 to T of v(t) dt.

So,

h_max = ∫₀^T [v0 + (m g)/k] e^(-kt/m) - (m g)/k dt

Let me compute this integral.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

h_max = ∫₀^T [v0 + (m g)/k] e^(-kt/m) dt - ∫₀^T (m g)/k dt

The second integral is straightforward:

= (m g)/k ∫₀^T dt = (m g)/k * T

The first integral:

= [v0 + (m g)/k] ∫₀^T e^(-kt/m) dt

The integral of e^(-kt/m) dt from 0 to T is:

[ -m/k e^(-kt/m) ] from 0 to T = (-m/k) [ e^(-k T/m) - 1 ]

So putting it all together:

h_max = [v0 + (m g)/k ] * [ (-m/k)(e^(-k T/m) - 1) ) ] - (m g)/k * T

Hmm, this is getting a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe using the solution for velocity and the expression for time T, we can find h_max.

Alternatively, perhaps using energy considerations. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v0². At maximum height, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is m g h_max. But because there's air resistance, which does negative work, the initial KE is converted into gravitational PE plus the work done against air resistance.

So,

(1/2) m v0² = m g h_max + W_air

Where W_air is the work done by the air resistance force. Since air resistance acts opposite to the direction of motion, W_air = - ∫ F_air ds from 0 to h_max.

But F_air = -k m v, so W_air = - ∫ (from 0 to h_max) k m v ds.

But since v = ds/dt, and if we parameterize in terms of t, this becomes -k m ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to T, where T is the time to reach max height.

So,

(1/2) m v0² = m g h_max - k m ∫₀^T v(t) dt

But ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to T is the h_max, so:

(1/2) v0² = g h_max - k ∫₀^T v(t) dt

But this seems circular. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the integral numerically. Let's try plugging in the numbers.

Given:

m = 0.5 kg

k = 0.01 s⁻¹

v0 = 120 m/s

First, compute the terminal velocity from part (a), which we thought was around 980 m/s with g=9.8, or 1000 m/s with g=10.

But for part (b), perhaps using g=9.8.

So, let's proceed with g=9.8 m/s².

Compute the velocity equation:

v(t) = [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-kt/m) - (m g)/k

Plugging in the numbers:

m g = 0.5 kg *9.8 =4.9 N

(m g)/k = 4.9 / 0.01 = 490 m/s

So,

v(t) = [120 + 490] e^(-0.01 t / 0.5) - 490

= 610 e^(-0.02 t) - 490

We need to find T when v=0:

0 = 610 e^(-0.02 T) - 490

610 e^(-0.02 T) = 490

e^(-0.02 T) = 490/610 ≈ 0.8033

Take natural log:

-0.02 T = ln(0.8033) ≈ -0.219

So,

T ≈ 0.219 / 0.02 ≈ 10.95 seconds.

Now, to find h_max, integrate v(t) from 0 to T.

h_max = ∫₀^T [610 e^(-0.02 t) - 490 ] dt

= 610 ∫ e^(-0.02 t) dt - 490 ∫ dt

= 610 [ (-1/0.02) e^(-0.02 t) ] from 0 to T - 490 [ t ] from 0 to T

= 610 * (-50) [ e^(-0.02 T) - 1 ] - 490 T

Compute each part:

First term: 610 * (-50) [ e^(-0.02*10.95) - 1 ]

e^(-0.02 *10.95) = e^(-0.219) ≈ 0.8033

So,

610 * (-50) [ 0.8033 - 1 ] = 610 * (-50) * (-0.1967) ≈ 610 * 50 * 0.1967

Calculate 610 *50 = 30500

30500 *0.1967 ≈ 30500 *0.2 =6100, but since 0.1967 is slightly less, perhaps around 5997.85.

Second term: -490 * 10.95 ≈ -5365.5

So,

h_max ≈ 5997.85 - 5365.5 ≈ 632.35 meters.

Wait, that's the approximate maximum height. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 610 * (-50) [0.8033 -1 ] = 610 * (-50) * (-0.1967) = 610 *50 *0.1967 = 30500 *0.1967 ≈ 30500 *0.2=6100, but 0.1967 is 0.0033 less than 0.2. So 6100 - (30500 *0.0033)= 6100 - 100.65= 6000 - 100.65= 5900 approximately. But maybe more accurately, 0.1967 is 0.1967, so 30500 *0.1967.

Let me compute 30500 *0.1967:

0.1967 * 30500 = ?

Compute 30500 *0.2 =6100

Minus 30500*(0.0033)=30500*0.0033=100.65

So 6100 -100.65=5999.35.

So first term is 5999.35.

Second term: -490 *10.95= -490*(10 +0.95)= -4900 -490*0.95.

490*0.95=465.5

So total second term: -4900 -465.5= -5365.5.

Thus, h_max=5999.35 -5365.5=633.85 meters.

Approximately 634 meters. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are in hundreds or thousands, like 600, 700, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the integral again.

Wait, the integral of v(t) from 0 to T is:

h_max = ∫₀^T [610 e^(-0.02 t) - 490 ] dt

= 610 * [ (-50) e^(-0.02 t) ] from 0 to T - 490 T

= 610 * (-50) [ e^(-0.02 T) - 1 ] -490 T

Which is:

= 610*(-50)* (0.8033 -1) -490*10.95

= 610*(-50)*(-0.1967) -490*10.95

= 610*50*0.1967 -490*10.95

= 30500 *0.1967 -5365.5

30500 *0.1967: Let's compute this accurately.

0.1967 *30000=5901

0.1967 *500=98.35

Total:5901 +98.35=6000- no, 5901+98.35=5999.35

So,

h_max=5999.35 -5365.5=633.85 meters.

So approximately 634 meters.

But the options given are much larger numbers, like 1200, 1100, 1300, etc. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of T. Let me double-check the calculation for T.

We had:

0 = [120 +490] e^(-0.02 T) -490

So,

610 e^(-0.02 T) =490

e^(-0.02 T)=490/610=0.8033

Taking natural log:

-0.02 T = ln(0.8033)= approximately -0.219

So,

T=0.219/0.02=10.95 seconds.

Wait, that seems correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to neglect air resistance and just use the simple projectile motion formula. Let me check that.

Without air resistance, the maximum height would be (v0)^2/(2g). So, 120^2/(2*9.8)= 14400/(19.6)= approx 735 m. But with air resistance, it should be less than that. But the options don't have 700. They have option I as 600, which is close to 634 I calculated earlier. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another method.

Another way to model the problem is to consider the differential equation of motion and solve for velocity as a function of time, then integrate to find the height.

The equation is:

dv/dt = -g - (k/m) v

This is a linear ODE and can be solved using an integrating factor.

The solution is:

v(t) = [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-kt/m) - (m g)/k

We found that earlier. Now, to find the time T when v=0:

0 = [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-k T/m) - (m g)/k

Which gives:

e^(-k T/m) = (m g)/(k [v0 + (m g)/k]) )

= (m g) / (k v0 + m g )

Taking natural logs:

- (k/m) T = ln( (m g)/(k v0 + m g) )

So,

T = -(m/k) ln( (m g)/(k v0 + m g) )

Plugging in the numbers:

m=0.5 kg, k=0.01 s⁻¹, v0=120 m/s, g=9.8 m/s².

Compute denominator: k v0 + m g = 0.01 *120 +0.5*9.8=1.2 +4.9=6.1

So,

(m g) =0.5*9.8=4.9

So,

( m g )/(denominator)=4.9/6.1 ≈0.8033

Thus,

T= -(0.5 / 0.01 ) * ln(0.8033 )= -50 * (-0.219)=10.95 s.

Now, to find h_max, integrate v(t) from 0 to T.

h_max= ∫₀^T v(t) dt= ∫₀^T [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-kt/m) - (m g)/k dt

= [v0 + (m g)/k ] * ∫₀^T e^(-kt/m) dt - (m g)/k * T

Compute ∫ e^(-kt/m) dt from 0 to T.

= [ -m/(k) e^(-kt/m) ] from 0 to T

= (-m/k) [ e^(-k T/m) -1 ]

So,

h_max= [v0 + (m g)/k ] * (-m/k)( e^(-k T/m) -1 ) - (m g)/k * T

Plugging in the numbers:

[v0 + (m g)/k ]=120 +490=610

(-m/k)= -0.5/0.01=-50

(e^(-k T/m))=e^(-0.01 *10.95/0.5)=e^(-0.219)=0.8033

So,

h_max=610 * (-50) [0.8033 -1 ] - (490) *10.95

=610*(-50)*(-0.1967) -490*10.95

=610*50*0.1967 -5365.5

=30500 *0.1967≈5999.35 -5365.5=633.85 meters.

Hmm, same result as before. So approximately 634 meters.

Looking back at the options, the closest one is I:600 m. But 634 is closer to 600 than to 700, but I'm not sure if that's an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:800

B:500

C:700

D:400

E:1000

F:1200

G:1300

H:1100

I:600

J:900

So, 634 is closer to 600 (option I) or 700 (option C). But perhaps the problem expects an approximate value, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach using energy is better. Let's try that.

The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v0². The work done against gravity is m g h_max, and the work done against air resistance is the integral of F_air ds, which is ∫ F_air ds = ∫ (-k m v) ds. Since v = ds/dt, this becomes -k m ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to T.

So,

Initial KE = Work done against gravity + Work done against air resistance.

(1/2) m v0² = m g h_max + k m ∫₀^T v(t) dt

We can compute ∫ v(t) dt, which is h_max, as we did before. So,

(1/2) v0² = g h_max + k h_max

Because ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to T is h_max.

So,

(1/2) v0² = h_max (g +k )

Solving for h_max:

h_max = (v0²)/(2(g +k) )

Wait, that's a much simpler formula! I think I missed this approach earlier. Let me check if that's correct.

Yes, because if we model the equation as:

m dv/dt = -m g -k m v

Which can be written as dv/dt + (k/m) v = -g

The solution leads to velocity as a function of time, and integrating that gives h_max. But perhaps there's a shortcut.

Alternatively, considering the equation:

(1/2) m v0² = m g h_max + k m ∫ v(t) dt

But ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to T is h_max, so:

(1/2) v0² = g h_max + k h_max

Thus,

h_max = (v0²)/(2 (g +k) )

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check the units. v0 is m/s, so v0² is (m²/s²). g is m/s², k is s⁻¹. So g +k would have units of m/s² + 1/s. That doesn't add up dimensionally. So that approach must be wrong.

Ah, right, I can't add g and k directly because they have different units. So that approach is incorrect. I must have made a mistake there.

So, going back, the correct way is to compute h_max as the integral of v(t) from 0 to T, which we found to be around 634 meters. But since the options don't include this, perhaps I made an error in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should use g=10 m/s² for simplicity. Let me try that.

So, with g=10 m/s²:

(m g)=0.5 *10=5 N

(m g)/k=5 /0.01=500 m/s

v(t)= [120 +500] e^(-0.01 t /0.5) -500

=620 e^(-0.02 t) -500

Set v=0:

620 e^(-0.02 T)=500

e^(-0.02 T)=500/620≈0.8065

Take ln:

-0.02 T= ln(0.8065)=approx -0.213

So,

T=0.213/0.02=10.65 seconds.

Now, compute h_max:

h_max= ∫₀^T [620 e^(-0.02 t) -500 ] dt

=620 ∫ e^(-0.02 t) dt -500 ∫ dt

=620 * (-50) [e^(-0.02 T) -1 ] -500 T

Compute:

e^(-0.02*10.65)=e^(-0.213)=approx 0.8065

So,

First term:620*(-50)*(0.8065 -1)=620*(-50)*(-0.1935)=620*50*0.1935

=31000 *0.1935≈31000*0.19=5890, 31000*0.0035=108.5, total≈5998.5

Second term: -500 *10.65= -5325

h_max≈5998.5 -5325=673.5 meters.

Hmm, still around 673 meters. The options don't have this number. So perhaps the approach is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem in part (b) is considering the case without air resistance, which would give a much higher height. Let me compute that.

Without air resistance, the maximum height is v0²/(2g)=120²/(2*9.8)=14400/(19.6)=735 meters. Still not matching the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, the highest option is G:1300 m. But that's way higher than our calculation. Perhaps the problem in part (b) expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem in part (a) is easier to solve correctly, which could help in determining the correct answer.

Let me go back to part (a). The question is to find the terminal velocity when the potato is released from rest. The terminal velocity occurs when the net force is zero, so:

m g = k m v_terminal ⇒ v_terminal = g/k.

With g=9.8 m/s² and k=0.01 s⁻¹,

v_terminal=9.8/0.01=980 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:900 m/s, but that's 900, which is 80 less than 980. Alternatively, if g is taken as 10, then v_terminal=1000 m/s, which is option E.

But the options don't have 980, so perhaps the intended answer is E:1000 m/s for part (a).

If part (a) is E:1000 m/s, then perhaps part (b) is using the same g=10, leading to a higher maximum height.

Wait, let me recalculate part (b) with g=10 m/s².

m=0.5 kg, k=0.01 s⁻¹, v0=120 m/s.

Terminal velocity v_t=10/0.01=1000 m/s.

The velocity equation is:

v(t)= [v0 + (m g)/k ] e^(-kt/m) - (m g)/k

With g=10,

(m g)/k=0.5*10 /0.01=50/0.01=500 m/s.

So,

v(t)= [120+500] e^(-0.01 t /0.5) -500=620 e^(-0.02 t) -500

Set v=0:

620 e^(-0.02 T)=500

e^(-0.02 T)=500/620≈0.8065

Take ln:

-0.02 T= ln(0.8065)=approx -0.213

So,

T=0.213/0.02=10.65 seconds.

Now, integrate v(t) from 0 to T to find h_max.

h_max= ∫₀^T [620 e^(-0.02 t) -500 ] dt

=620 ∫ e^(-0.02 t) dt -500 ∫ dt

=620 [ (-50) e^(-0.02 t) ] from 0 to T -500 T

=620*(-50)[e^(-0.02 T)-1] -500 T

=620*(-50)[0.8065 -1] -500*10.65

=620*(-50)*(-0.1935) -5325

=620*50*0.1935 -5325

=31000 *0.1935 ≈31000*0.19=5890, 31000*0.0035=108.5 → total ≈5998.5

h_max≈5998.5 -5325=673.5 meters.

Hmm, same as before. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore air resistance, leading to h_max=735 m when g=9.8, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look back at the options. Part (a) options include J:900, which is 9.8/0.01=980, close to 900, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects part (a) to be E:1000 m/s, and part (b) to be much higher because without air resistance, the height is 735 m, but with air resistance, it's lower, but in the options, the only higher option is F:1200, which is higher than 735, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem in part (b) is using a different approach, like using the terminal velocity found in part (a) to calculate the height.

Wait, when the potato is shot upward, the maximum height occurs when all the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy plus the work done against air resistance. But perhaps a simpler way is to use the terminal velocity found in part (a) to compute the height.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum height can be found using the formula:

h_max = (v0²)/(2g) * (1/(1 + (k v0)/(m g)))

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: The average velocity during the ascent can be approximated as (v0 +0)/2 = v0/2, but this is only true for constant acceleration, which isn't the case here due to air resistance. So that might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps using the expression for velocity as a function of time and integrating to find the time to reach max height, then using that time to find the height.

But I think I'm stuck here. Given the options, and considering that part (a) is likely E:1000 m/s when using g=10, perhaps part (b) would have a maximum height that's a significant fraction of the initial velocity squared over g, but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to think that part (a) is 1000 m/s, so the answer is E, and part (b) is 1200 m/s, option F. But that doesn't make sense because 1200 is higher than the initial velocity without air resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps part (b) is 600 m, option I, which is close to my calculation of 634 m with g=9.8.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is I:600 m, given that it's the closest to my calculation.

Wait, but the options don't include 634 m, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to use a different method, such as energy conservation without considering the work done by air resistance, which would give a higher height. But that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem in part (b) is using the same approach as part (a), leading to a maximum height of 600 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the case where the acceleration is not constant, and the maximum height is found using the integral approach, leading to the answer I:600 m.

Given all this, I think the best approach is to proceed with the calculations I did, which gave me approximately 634 m, and choose the closest option, which is I:600 m. However, since 634 is closer to 600 than to 700, I might choose I. But another possibility is that the problem expects a higher value, perhaps using a different method.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the energy approach again.

The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv0². The work done against gravity is mgh_max, and the work done against air resistance is the integral of F_air ds, which is ∫ (-k m v) ds.

But since v=ds/dt, the work done by air resistance is -k m ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to T, which is -k m h_max.

So,

(1/2)mv0² = m g h_max + k m h_max

Simplify:

(1/2)v0² = h_max (g +k )

Thus,

h_max = v0²/(2(g +k)).

Wait, but earlier I thought the units wouldn't add up, but let me check with g=9.8 m/s² and k=0.01 s⁻¹.

g +k =9.8 +0.01=9.81 m/s² + s⁻¹? That doesn't make sense because they have different units. So this approach is incorrect. So I must have made a mistake here.

Therefore, the correct approach is to integrate the velocity function, leading to approximately 634 m, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach or the options are incorrect.

Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer for part (a) is E:1000 m/s, and for part (b), using g=10, the height would be around 673 m, which isn't an option either. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the air resistance is given as -k m v, which is a linear drag force. So the terminal velocity is v_t = mg/k, which with m=0.5 kg, g=9.8, k=0.01, gives v_t=9.8/0.01=980 m/s. But that's not an option, so perhaps the intended answer is E:1000 m/s, using g=10.

Then for part (b), using g=10, the height is around 673 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects to use a different method, leading to a higher value. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the potato reaches the terminal velocity quickly, but that doesn't make sense for maximum height.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum height is when the kinetic energy equals the work done against gravity and air resistance. But I'm not sure.

Given all this, I think the best I can do is proceed with part (a) as E:1000 m/s, and part (b) as I:600 m, but I'm not confident.
</think>

To determine the terminal velocity for part (a), we set the gravitational force equal to the air resistive force:  
\[
m g = k m v_{\text{terminal}}
\]  
Simplifying,  
\[
v_{\text{terminal}} = \frac{g}{k}
\]  
Using \(g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2}\) and \(k = 0.01 \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}\),  
\[
v_{\text{terminal}} = \frac{9.8}{0.01} = 980 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]  
Since this value is not an option, we approximate \(g = 10 \, \mathrm{m/s^2}\), giving \(v_{\text{terminal}} = 1000 \, \mathrm{m/s}\), which matches option E.

For part (b), the maximum height is calculated by integrating the velocity function under air resistance. Using the differential equation for motion:  
\[
\frac{dv}{dt} = -g - \frac{k}{m} v
\]  
The solution for velocity is:  
\[
v(t) = \left[v_0 + \frac{m g}{k}\right] e^{-\frac{k t}{m}} - \frac{m g}{k}
\]  
Setting \(v = 0\) to find the time \(T\) to reach maximum height:  
\[
0 = \left[v_0 + \frac{m g}{k}\right] e^{-\frac{k T}{m}} - \frac{m g}{k}
\]  
Solving for \(T\) and integrating \(v(t)\) from \(0\) to \(T\) gives the height. Using \(g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2}\), the calculated height is approximately \(634 \, \mathrm{m}\), but this is not an option. Using \(g = 10 \, \mathrm{m/s^2}\), the height is around \(673 \, \mathrm{m}\), still not matching the options. The closest option is I: \(600 \, \mathrm{m}\).
