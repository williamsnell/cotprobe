Question:

Say the incidence of a disease D is about 5 cases per 100 people (i.e., P(D) = 0.05). Let Boolean random variable D mean a patient “has disease D” and let Boolean random variable TP stand for "tests positive." Tests for disease D are known to be very accurate in the sense that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, and the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97. What is P(D | TP), the posterior probability that you have disease D when the test is positive?

Options:

A: 0.0495
B: 0.02
C: 0.05
D: 0.1
E: 0.99
F: 0.635
G: 0.078
H: 0.25
I: 0.97

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about calculating the posterior probability P(D|TP), which means the probability that someone has disease D given that they tested positive. 

First, I remember that this is a classic case for Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

P(D|TP) = [P(TP|D) * P(D)] / P(TP)

So I need to break down each part of this formula.

From the problem, I know a few things:
- The incidence of disease D is 5 per 100 people, so P(D) is 0.05.
- The test's true positive rate is 0.99. That means if someone has the disease, the probability they test positive is 99%, so P(TP|D) = 0.99.
- The test's false negative rate would be 1 minus the true positive rate, so 1 - 0.99 = 0.01. But wait, actually, I might not need that directly here.
- The test's true negative rate is 0.97. That means if someone doesn't have the disease, the probability they test negative is 97%, so P(Negative|¬D) = 0.97. Therefore, the probability of testing positive when you don't have the disease, P(TP|¬D), is 1 - 0.97 = 0.03. Because if you don't have the disease, you have a 3% chance of testing positive.

Now, using Bayes' Theorem, I need to compute P(D|TP). To do that, I need to find each component.

I have P(TP|D) = 0.99 and P(D) = 0.05. The tricky part is finding P(TP), the total probability of testing positive. To find P(TP), I can use the law of total probability, which considers both the cases where the person has the disease and where they don't.

So, P(TP) = P(TP|D) * P(D) + P(TP|¬D) * P(¬D)

I know P(TP|D) is 0.99, P(D) is 0.05. P(TP|¬D) is 0.03, and P(¬D) is 1 - P(D) = 0.95.

Calculating each term:
- First term: 0.99 * 0.05 = 0.0495
- Second term: 0.03 * 0.95 = 0.0285

Adding them together: 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078.

Now, plug these into Bayes' formula:
P(D|TP) = (0.99 * 0.05) / 0.078 = 0.0495 / 0.078.

Let me compute that division. 0.0495 divided by 0.078. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to get rid of decimals: 49.5 / 78.

Let me do the division: 49.5 ÷ 78. Let's see, 78 times 0.6 is 46.8. Subtract that from 49.5: 49.5 - 46.8 = 2.7. Now, 2.7 divided by 78 is approximately 0.0346. So adding that to 0.6 gives 0.6346. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.6 + 0.0346 is 0.6346, which is about 0.635.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the division. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to do 0.0495 / 0.078.

Alternatively, 0.0495 ÷ 0.078 = (495/10000) ÷ (78/1000) = (495/10000) * (1000/78) = (495 * 1000) / (10000 *78) = (495,000) / (780,000) = 495/780.

Simplify that fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 15: 495 ÷15=33, 780 ÷15=52. So 33/52. Let's compute that as a decimal.

33 divided by 52: 52 goes into 33 zero times. Add a decimal point. 52 goes into 330 about 6 times (6*52=312). Subtract 312 from 330: 18. Bring down a zero: 180. 52 goes into 180 3 times (3*52=156). Subtract: 24. Bring down a zero: 240. 52 goes into 240 4 times (4*52=208). Subtract: 32. Bring down a zero: 320. 52 goes into 320 6 times (6*52=312). Subtract: 8. Bring down a zero: 80. 52 goes into 80 1 time (52). Subtract: 28. Bring down a zero: 280. 52 goes into 280 5 times (5*52=260). Subtract:20. Bring down a zero: 200. 52 goes into 200 3 times (3*52=156). Subtract:44. Bring down a zero: 440. 52 goes into 440 8 times (8*52=416). Subtract:24. Hmm, I'm seeing a repeating pattern here. So 33/52 ≈ 0.634615...

So approximately 0.6346, which is about 0.635. Looking back at the options, option F is 0.635. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

P(TP) = (0.99 * 0.05) + (0.03 * 0.95) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078. That's correct.

Then P(D|TP) = 0.0495 / 0.078 = 0.6346... So yeah, 0.635. So option F is correct.

The problem requires calculating the posterior probability P(D|TP) using Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Incidence of disease D: P(D) = 0.05.
   - True positive rate: P(TP|D) = 0.99.
   - True negative rate: P(Negative|¬D) = 0.97 → P(TP|¬D) = 0.03.
   - P(¬D) = 1 - P(D) = 0.95.

2. **Total Probability of Testing Positive (P(TP))**:
   - P(TP) = P(TP|D) * P(D) + P(TP|¬D) * P(¬D) = (0.99 * 0.05) + (0.03 * 0.95) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078.

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   - P(D|TP) = [P(TP|D) * P(D)] / P(TP) = 0.0495 / 0.078 ≈ 0.635.

Thus, the correct answer is **F: 0.635**.
