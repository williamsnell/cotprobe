Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of kilocalories required to convert one mole of methyl alcohol (CH3OH) from a solid at -98°C to vapor at 65°C. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with phase changes and temperature changes, I should consider all the steps involved. So, the process should involve several stages: heating the solid from its initial temperature to its melting point, then melting the solid into liquid, heating the liquid from the melting point to the boiling point, then vaporizing the liquid into vapor, and maybe heating the vapor a bit if needed. But wait, in this case, the initial solid is at -98°C, which is its freezing point, so I think the melting point is 0°C? Wait, no, the freezing point is -98°C, so the melting point is also -98°C because freezing and melting points are the same temperature. So, the solid will melt at -98°C. Then, the liquid will be heated to the boiling point of 65°C, and then vaporized.

Wait, the boiling point is 65°C, so that's the temperature where it turns into vapor.

So, the steps are:

1. Heat the solid from -98°C to its melting point (which is the same temperature, so that's zero heat because it's already at the melting point). Wait, no—wait, the freezing point is -98°C, so the solid is at -98°C. When you start heating it, it will first go from -98°C to 0°C, but wait, wait no. Wait, the freezing point is where it turns from liquid to solid, so the melting point is the same as the freezing point. So, the solid is already at -98°C, which is its freezing point. So to melt it, you just need to add heat to go from solid at -98°C (which is the freezing point) to liquid at -98°C, then heat the liquid up to 65°C, then vaporize it.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The freezing point is the temperature at which the solid and liquid coexist. So if the solid is at -98°C, that's its melting point. Wait, no, wait. If it's a solid at -98°C, that's its freezing point. So when you start heating it, it will first warm up from -98°C to 0°C, but wait, no, because at -98°C, that's the freezing point. So, perhaps the solid is already at the melting point, so it can start melting without heating. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

The freezing point is the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases coexist. So, at -98°C, if you have a solid, it's the melting point. So, when you start adding heat, the solid will melt at -98°C. Then, once melted, the liquid will be at -98°C, and then you can heat it up to 65°C, then vaporize it.

Wait, but the initial temperature is -98°C, which is the freezing point, so the solid is at that temperature. So, perhaps the first step is to melt the solid at -98°C, which requires heat of fusion. Then, heat the liquid from -98°C to 65°C. Then, vaporize the liquid into vapor at 65°C, which requires heat of vaporization. So, that's the three steps: heat of fusion, heat required to warm the liquid, and heat of vaporization.

Wait, but another thought: when you have a solid at its freezing point, any heat added will go into melting without changing the temperature. So, the process is:

1. Melt the solid at -98°C using heat of fusion.
2. Heat the resulting liquid from -98°C to 65°C.
3. Vaporize the liquid at 65°C using heat of vaporization.

That makes sense. So, each step contributes to the total energy required.

Now, I need to calculate each of these steps.

First, I need the mass of one mole of methyl alcohol. The molecular formula is CH3OH. Let's calculate its molar mass.

Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 4 (since there are 4 H atoms: 3 in CH3 and 1 in OH)
Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol
So, CH3OH: 12.01 + (3×1.008) + 1.008 + 16.00.

Wait, wait. Let me count the H atoms correctly. The structure is CH3OH, so it's CH3-OH. So, CH3 has 3 H, and OH has 1 H, so total 4 H.

So, molar mass = C:12.01 + H3:3×1.008 = 3.024 + O:16.00 + H:1.008 = 1.008.

Wait, that's 12.01 + 3.024 + 16.00 + 1.008. Let me add them up:

12.01 + 3.024 = 15.034

15.034 + 16.00 = 31.034

31.034 + 1.008 = 32.042 g/mol.

So, one mole is 32.042 grams.

Now, the steps:

1. Heat of fusion (melting): amount of heat required to melt the solid. Given as 22.0 cal/g.

So, for one mole (32.042 g), the heat is 22.0 cal/g × 32.042 g.

Let me compute that: 22 ×32.042. Let's see, 22 ×30=660, 22×2.042=44.924. So total is 660 +44.924=704.924 cal. So approximately 704.924 cal.

2. Heating the liquid from -98°C to 65°C. The temperature change is 65 - (-98) = 163°C. The specific heat of liquid is 0.570 cal/g°C.

So, heat required is mass × specific heat × ΔT.

Mass is 32.042 g.

So, 32.042 g × 0.570 cal/g°C × 163°C.

Let me compute that:

First, 32.042 × 0.570 ≈ let's see:

32 ×0.57 = 18.24. 0.042 ×0.57≈0.02394. So total ≈18.26394 cal/°C.

Then multiply by 163°C: 18.26394 ×163.

Hmm, 18 ×160=2880. 18 ×3=54. So 2880+54=2934. But wait, 18.26394 ×163 is more precise.

Alternatively, 18.26394 ×163 = ?

Let me compute 18.26394 ×160 = 2922.2304

18.26394 ×3 = 54.79182

Total is 2922.2304 +54.79182 = 2977.02222 cal.

So approximately 2977.02 cal.

3. Heat of vaporization: 263 cal/g. To vaporize the liquid at 65°C.

So, 32.042 g ×263 cal/g = ?

32 ×263 = 8416. 0.042 ×263 ≈11.046.

So total is 8416 +11.046 ≈8427.046 cal.

Now, sum all three steps:

704.924 + 2977.02 + 8427.046.

First, 704.924 +2977.02 = 3681.944.

Then, 3681.944 +8427.046 = 12108.99 cal.

Wait, that's 12,108.99 calories.

But the question asks for kilocalories. Since 1 kcal = 1000 cal, so divide by 1000.

12108.99 cal = 12.10899 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 10-16 kcal. Hmm, but 12.109 kcal is approximately 12.11 kcal. Looking at the options, option C is 12.09 Kcal, E is 11.09, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in molar mass calculation? Because 32.042 grams per mole seems correct for CH3OH.

Wait, another thought: when I'm heating the liquid, is the temperature change correctly calculated? Yes, from -98 to 65 is indeed 163 degrees. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Compute each step again.

1. Heat of fusion: 22.0 cal/g ×32.042 g = 22 ×32.042 = ?

22 ×32 = 704, 22 ×0.042=0.924. So 704.924 cal.

2. Heating liquid: 32.042 ×0.570 ×163.

Calculate 32.042 ×0.570 first.

32 ×0.57 = 18.24.

0.042 ×0.57 = 0.02394.

So total 18.26394.

Then 18.26394 ×163:

Let me compute 18 ×163 = 2934, 0.26394 ×163 ≈43. So 2934 +43=2977. So 2977 cal.

3. Heat of vaporization: 32.042 ×263.

32 ×263 = 8416.

0.042 ×263 ≈11.046.

Total 8416 +11.046 =8427.046 cal.

Adding all together: 704.924 +2977=3681.924; 3681.924 +8427.046=12108.97 cal.

12108.97 cal = 12.10897 kcal, which is approximately 12.11 kcal.

Looking at the options, option C is 12.09 Kcal, which is very close. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the molar mass again. Maybe I made a mistake there.

CH3OH: C=12.01, H3=3×1.008=3.024, O=16.00, H=1.008.

So 12.01 +3.024=15.034 +16.00=31.034 +1.008=32.042 g/mol. That's correct.

Another point: the specific heat is given as 0.570 cal/g°C, which I used correctly.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation for the heat of vaporization. Let me recheck that.

32.042 ×263 = ?

32 ×263 = 8416. 0.042 ×263=11.046. So 8416+11.046=8427.046 cal. Correct.

So, total is 704.924 +2977.02 +8427.046= 704.924 +2977.02 is 3681.944, plus 8427.046 gives 12108.99 cal, which is 12.109 kcal.

But the options have C as 12.09 Kcal. Hmm, but maybe I made a calculation error. Let me check the sums again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each step with more precision.

Let me compute each part more accurately.

1. Heat of fusion: 22.0 cal/g ×32.042 g.

22.0 ×32.042 = 22 ×32.042 = ?

22 ×32 = 704.

22 ×0.042=0.924.

So, 704 + 0.924 = 704.924 cal.

2. Heating the liquid:

32.042 g ×0.570 cal/g°C ×163°C.

First, 32.042 ×0.570.

Let me compute 32 ×0.57 = 18.24.

0.042 ×0.57 = 0.02394.

So, 18.24 +0.02394=18.26394 cal/°C.

Then, 18.26394 ×163.

Compute 18.26394 ×160 = 2922.2304.

18.26394 ×3 =54.79182.

Total: 2922.2304 +54.79182=2977.02222 cal.

3. Heat of vaporization: 32.042 ×263.

32 ×263 = 8416.

0.042 ×263 = 11.046.

Total: 8416 +11.046 =8427.046 cal.

Now, summing all:

704.924 +2977.02222 = 3681.94622.

3681.94622 +8427.046 = 12109. (3681.94622 +8427.046 = 12109. (Wait, 3681 +8427=12108, plus the decimals 0.94622+0.046=0.99222, so total 12108.99222 cal.)

So 12108.99222 cal = 12.10899222 kcal, approximately 12.109 kcal.

Looking at the options, option C is 12.09 Kcal, which is very close. Maybe I should check if I missed any decimal places or if the given data has some rounding.

Wait, perhaps the specific heat is given as 0.570 cal/g°C, which is three decimal places. So during the calculation, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature change. Let me check: from -98°C to 65°C is indeed 163°C, correct.

Wait, another point: when calculating the heat for heating the liquid from -98 to 65, the formula is mass × specific heat × (T_final - T_initial). So yes, 32.042 ×0.570 ×(65 - (-98))=32.042 ×0.570 ×163.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. If 12.109 is the calculated value, but the closest option is C:12.09. Wait, but maybe I made a calculation error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps miscalculating the specific heat part. Let me re-calculate 32.042 ×0.570 ×163.

32.042 ×0.570 = ?

Let me compute accurately:

32.042 ×0.570.

= (30 + 2.042) ×0.570

=30 ×0.570 + 2.042 ×0.570

=17.1 + (2 ×0.570 +0.042 ×0.570)

=17.1 + (1.14 + 0.02394)

=17.1 +1.16394 =18.26394 cal/°C.

Then, 18.26394 ×163 = ?

18.26394 ×160 =2922.2304

18.26394 ×3=54.79182

Total:2922.2304 +54.79182=2977.02222 cal.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the total is 12.109 kcal, but the options don't have that exactly. The closest is option C:12.09 Kcal. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat of vaporization.

Wait, another thought: the molar mass is 32.042 g/mol. But maybe the problem expects me to use 32 g/mol for simplicity, which would change the calculations.

Let me try that. If I take molar mass as 32 g/mol, then:

1. Heat of fusion:22 cal/g ×32 g=704 cal.

2. Heating liquid:32 ×0.570 ×163.

32 ×0.570=18.24.

18.24 ×163=?

18 ×163=2934.

0.24 ×163=39.12.

Total 2934 +39.12=2973.12 cal.

3. Heat of vaporization:32 ×263=8416 cal.

Total:704 +2973.12=3677.12 +8416=12093.12 cal.

12093.12 cal =12.09312 kcal, which is approximately 12.09 kcal.

Ah, so if I use 32 g/mol, the total is approximately 12.09 kcal, which matches option C:12.09 Kcal.

So, perhaps the problem expects using 32.042 g/mol to two decimal places, but in that case, the answer is 12.109, which is not exactly an option. But if I approximate the molar mass to 32 g/mol, it gives 12.09 kcal, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes using 32 g/mol exactly. So, the correct answer would be option C:12.09 Kcal.
</think>

To calculate the number of kilocalories required to convert one mole of methyl alcohol (CH₃OH) from a solid at -98°C to vapor at 65°C, we consider the following steps:

1. **Molar Mass Calculation**:  
   The molar mass of CH₃OH is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molar Mass} = 12.01 \, (\text{C}) + 3 \times 1.008 \, (\text{H}) + 16.00 \, (\text{O}) + 1.008 \, (\text{H}) = 32.042 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

2. **Heat of Fusion**:  
   The heat required to melt the solid at -98°C is:  
   \[
   \text{Heat of Fusion} = 22.0 \, \text{cal/g} \times 32.042 \, \text{g} = 704.924 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

3. **Heating the Liquid**:  
   The heat required to warm the liquid from -98°C to 65°C is:  
   \[
   \Delta T = 65 - (-98) = 163 \, \text{°C}, \quad \text{Heat} = 32.042 \, \text{g} \times 0.570 \, \text{cal/g°C} \times 163 \, \text{°C} = 2977.022 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

4. **Heat of Vaporization**:  
   The heat required to vaporize the liquid at 65°C is:  
   \[
   \text{Heat of Vaporization} = 263 \, \text{cal/g} \times 32.042 \, \text{g} = 8427.046 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

5. **Total Heat**:  
   Summing all the heats:  
   \[
   \text{Total Heat} = 704.924 \, \text{cal} + 2977.022 \, \text{cal} + 8427.046 \, \text{cal} = 12108.992 \, \text{cal}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilocalories:  
   \[
   \text{Total Heat} = \frac{12108.992 \, \text{cal}}{1000} = 12.109 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

6. **Approximation**:  
   If the molar mass is approximated to 32 g/mol, the total heat becomes:  
   \[
   \text{Total Heat} \approx 12.09 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

Thus, the closest option is **C: 12.09 Kcal**.

Answer: C
