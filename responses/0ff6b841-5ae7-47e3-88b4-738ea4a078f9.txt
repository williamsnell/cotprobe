Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about federal civil procedure, specifically dealing with interrogatories in a district court case. I need to figure out which of the options A through J is the correct answer. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the question again carefully. The scenario is that the plaintiff's attorney served the defendant with a summons, complaint, and 25 interrogatories. The interrogatories ask about the defendant's contentions and must be answered within 30 days. The question is asking which ground the defendant is likely to succeed on to obtain a protective order.

I remember that in federal court, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) govern discovery, including interrogatories. So, I need to recall the rules related to serving interrogatories.

Option A says the interrogatories weren't accompanied by a summons and complaint. Wait, the question states that they were served with the summons and complaint. So A is incorrect because they were accompanied, so that's not a valid reason.

Option B claims the defendant isn't required to respond to interrogatories during a federal action. That doesn't sound right. I think parties are required to answer interrogatories unless they object. So B is probably wrong.

Option C states that interrogatories can't be served until the answer to the complaint is filed. Hmm, I think that's not accurate. From what I remember, Rule 33 allows service of interrogatories after the complaint is filed, but before the answer is due. Because the plaintiff files the complaint, then the defendant has to answer or file a motion within a certain time. But I don't think the defendant has to wait until they file their answer before being served with interrogatories. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D suggests the interrogatories exceed the number permitted without court permission or party agreement. I think Rule 33(b)(2) says that a party may serve no more than 25 interrogatories without the court's permission or unless the parties agree otherwise. Oh wait, in the question, it's exactly 25. So unless there's an agreement, 25 is the limit. But the question doesn't mention any prior agreement. So if the parties haven't agreed, the plaintiff can only serve up to 25. So serving exactly 25 would be okay, but if the defendant objects on the basis that it exceeds without court permission, but since it's exactly 25, maybe that's allowed. Hmm, so D might not be the correct answer because 25 is within the limit unless there's a prior agreement.

Option E says the defendant isn't required to respond within 30 days. But Rule 33 requires the defendant to respond within 30 days after service, unless otherwise extended by the court or by written agreement. So if the interrogatories were properly served, the defendant must answer within 30 days. So E is incorrect.

Option F: the questions are excessively burdensome or expensive. Rule 26(b)(2)(E) allows a party to object if the discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive. So if the defendant can show that answering 25 interrogatories is a burden, they might get a protective order. But the question doesn't state that the questions are particularly burdensome, just that there are 25. So F is a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the best option here.

Option G: the interrogatories weren't properly served. The question says they were served, so G isn't applicable.

Option H: the questions are irrelevant. Rule 33 allows only questions that are relevant to the case. If the interrogatories ask about irrelevant matters, the defendant can object. But the question doesn't specify that the questions are irrelevant, only that they are about contentions. Contentions are generally relevant because they pertain to the defendant's version of the facts. So H might not be the right choice unless the contentions are about something irrelevant, which isn't mentioned here.

Option I: interrogatories can't be served until parties confer for initial disclosures and a discovery plan. Rule 26(f) requires the parties to confer early to discuss initial disclosures and a discovery plan. But Rule 33 allows for the service of interrogatories after the complaint is filed, even before the Rule 26(f) conference. Wait, noâ€”Rule 26(f) is about the initial conference, but interrogatories can be served before that. I think that's incorrect. So I don't think I is correct because the timing isn't an issue here.

Option J: interrogatories are only for discovering facts, not contentions. Rule 33 allows interrogatories about any matter, including the contentions of the opposing party. So J is incorrect because contentions are fair game.

Wait, going back to D. The plaintiff served 25 interrogatories. Under Rule 33(b)(2), unless the parties agree or the court orders otherwise, a party may serve no more than 25 written interrogatories. So if the parties didn't agree, 25 is the limit. So serving exactly 25 is allowed. Therefore, D is not a valid ground because 25 is permissible without court approval. So D is incorrect.

So, reviewing the options again, the most likely correct answer is either F or H. But the question is about a protective order. So F is about the burden of answering the interrogatories. If the defendant can show that answering 25 interrogatories is unduly burdensome, they might get a protective order. But the question doesn't specify any such burden, so maybe F isn't the right choice unless the number itself is considered a burden. Alternatively, if the court allows 25 without more, then F isn't applicable.

Wait, another angle: under Rule 33(b)(2), the court can allow more than 25 if the parties agree or if the court finds it's necessary. So if the plaintiff didn't get court permission and the parties didn't agree, then serving 25 would be okay. So D is incorrect because it's within the limit.

So perhaps F is the correct answer because the defendant can argue that the number of interrogatories, even if within the limit, is unduly burdensome. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the plaintiff served the interrogatories before the defendant answered the complaint, which isn't allowed. Wait, no, Rule 33 allows for service of interrogatories after the complaint is filed, even before the answer is filed. So the timing isn't an issue.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the rules again. Rule 33 allows service of interrogatories after the complaint is filed. There's no requirement to wait until the answer is filed. So C is incorrect.

So, looking again, the defendant can object if the interrogatories are burdensome. So F might be the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because the question doesn't specify that the interrogatories are burdensome, just that there are 25.

Wait, another point: if the parties have not yet met for the Rule 26(f) conference, can interrogatories be served? I think they can, but the initial conference is about planning. So I is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is F: the questions are excessively burdensome. But without specific facts, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the number of interrogatories, even at 25, is too many, but since that's allowed, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred. But I thought that wasn't the case. Let me check Rule 33. Rule 33(a)(1) says that after the complaint is filed, any party may serve written interrogatories upon any other party within 14 days after service of the complaint or within 14 days after service of a pleading directed to the party's claim or defense. So the timing is okay; the defendant can be served with interrogatories before filing their answer. So I is incorrect.

So, going back, the only other option is F. So the defendant might argue that answering 25 interrogatories is unduly burdensome, but the question doesn't state that. Alternatively, perhaps the number itself is an issue if the parties haven't agreed or the court hasn't allowed more than 25. But since 25 is allowed, D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the plaintiff served 25 without court permission, but that's allowed unless the parties agreed otherwise. So unless there's an agreement, 25 is okay. So D is not a valid ground.

Therefore, the only remaining plausible option is F: the interrogatories are excessively burdensome. But the question doesn't specify that, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I, but I don't think so.

Wait, another point: the defendant can move for a protective order under Rule 26(b)(2)(E) if the discovery is unduly burdensome. So if the defendant can show that answering 25 interrogatories is too much, they can get a protective order. So F is a possible answer.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is I, but I'm not convinced. I think F is more likely, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because 25 is the limit, but the plaintiff served 25 without court permission, which is allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is I. Rule 33(b)(1) says that a party may serve interrogatories upon any other party within 14 days after service of the complaint, so it's allowed before the parties confer. So I is incorrect because the timing isn't an issue.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is F: the interrogatories contain questions that are excessively burdensome or expensive to answer. But the question doesn't state that, so perhaps it's a trick. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the plaintiff served 25 interrogatories, which is the maximum allowed without court order or party agreement. If the defendant objects on the basis that the number exceeds without permission, but since 25 is allowed, that's not a valid ground. So D is incorrect.

Therefore, the only valid ground left is F: the questions are excessively burdensome. But since the question doesn't provide that, maybe the answer is F. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: the questions are irrelevant.

Wait, the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions, which are relevant. So H is incorrect.

So, after all this, I'm leaning towards F as the correct answer because it's a possible ground for a protective order, even though the question doesn't specify the burden. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D, but I think D is incorrect because 25 is allowed.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. The question is about which ground the defendant is likely to succeed on. So, which of these options is a valid reason for a protective order under the rules.

Looking at the options, F and H are about the content of the interrogatories, while D and I are about procedure.

I think the answer is F or H. Since the question says the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions, which are generally relevant, so H is unlikely. Therefore, F is more plausible.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is I. But I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: under Rule 33(b)(3), the court may allow the serving of interrogatories before the Rule 26(f) conference, but the conference is required within 21 days after the complaint is filed. So if the defendant hasn't yet conferred, can they object? I think the conference is about planning, not about serving interrogatories.

So, I think the correct answer is F. The defendant can argue that answering 25 interrogatories is unduly burdensome, and thus seek a protective order under Rule 26(b)(2)(E).

Wait, but the number is exactly 25, which is allowed. So the burden would be on the content or the number beyond 25. Since it's exactly 25, the burden must be on the content. So F is correct.

Therefore, the answer is F.
</think>

The question revolves around a federal district court case where the plaintiff served the defendant with 25 interrogatories. The defendant seeks a protective order, and the task is to determine the most likely ground for success. Here's the analysis:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the interrogatories were accompanied by the summons and complaint.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as defendants are required to respond to interrogatories unless they object.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as interrogatories can be served before the answer to the complaint is filed.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as 25 interrogatories are allowed without court permission or party agreement.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as the defendant is required to respond within 30 days unless otherwise extended.
- **Option F**: Plausible, as the defendant could argue the interrogatories are excessively burdensome or expensive under Rule 26(b)(2)(E).
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as the interrogatories were properly served.
- **Option H**: Unlikely, as the interrogatories concern the defendant's contentions, which are generally relevant.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as interrogatories can be served before the Rule 26(f) conference.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as interrogatories are allowed to discover both facts and contentions.

The most likely ground for a protective order is **F**, as the defendant could argue that answering the interrogatories is unduly burdensome, even though the number (25) is within the allowed limit.

**Answer: F**
