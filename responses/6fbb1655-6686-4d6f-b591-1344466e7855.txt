Alright, so I've got this question about oligopoly, and I need to figure out which condition is characteristic of it. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that oligopoly is a market structure with a small number of large sellers or firms. These firms are interdependent, meaning they consider each other's actions when making business decisions. Unlike in perfect competition, where each firm is independent, or in monopolistic competition where there are many firms and product differentiation, oligopoly has a few key players who are very aware of each other.

The question is asking about which condition is characteristic of oligopoly. The options are A through J, each describing how rival firms interact regarding prices. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says rival firms act independently of each other. Wait, in oligopoly, they don't act independently because they know their actions affect each other. So A might not be correct.

Option B states that rival firms never interact or influence each other's prices. That sounds more like perfect competition, where firms are price takers and don't influence each other. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: A rival firm matches price decreases but fails to match price increases. Hmm, this sounds familiar. I think this is related to something called price leadership, where one firm acts as a leader and others follow. If a leader lowers prices, others follow, but if the leader raises prices, others might not follow. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Option D: A rival always undercuts the prices of rivals regardless of changes. That seems a bit extreme. Undercutting would mean setting a lower price, but in oligopoly, firms might not always undercut because they might be trying to maintain prices through collusion or some sort of默契.

Option E: Matches increases but not decreases. So if one firm raises prices, others follow, but if one lowers, others don't. That's the opposite of option C. I'm not sure which is more characteristic.

Option F: Matches both increases and decreases. That sounds like collusion or perfect coordination, maybe like a cartel. But is that always the case in oligopoly? I think sometimes firms might not perfectly match, especially if they're competing.

Option G: Fails to match both. That would mean no reaction, which I don't think is typical in oligopoly because firms usually do react.

Option H: Rivals always collude to set prices. Collusion is a form of oligopoly behavior, but it's illegal in many places, and the question is about a characteristic condition, not necessarily illegal activities. Plus, not all oligopolies involve collusion.

Option I: Matches decreases but exceeds increases. So if a rival lowers prices, they match, but if the rival raises, they go even higher. That sounds like a strategy to possibly increase prices further, but I'm not sure if that's a standard oligopoly condition.

Option J: Always have the same production costs. That might be true for some oligopolies, but it's not a defining characteristic. Firms can have different costs and still be in oligopoly.

Wait, going back to the concepts. I remember something called the kinked demand curve model in oligopoly. In that model, each firm's demand curve is kinked because rivals might react differently to price changes. Specifically, if a firm raises its price above the prevailing level, rivals might not follow, leading to a sharp drop in demand. But if the firm lowers its price, rivals will match to maintain their market share.

So in that case, if a firm decreases its price, others match, but if it increases, others don't match. That would mean the firm's demand curve is more elastic on the rising side and inelastic on the falling side.

Looking back at the options, option C says a rival matches price decreases but fails to match increases. That aligns with the kinked demand model. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. Option E says matches increases but not decreases. That would be the opposite. No, because in the kinked model, when you lower, others follow; when you raise, they don't. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C. In an oligopoly, firms are interdependent, and their pricing strategies often reflect this interdependence. The kinked demand curve model illustrates that if one firm lowers its price, rivals are likely to match the decrease to maintain their market share. However, if a firm raises its prices, rivals may not follow, leading to a potential loss in demand. This behavior is characteristic of oligopoly dynamics, making option C the correct choice.

Answer: C
