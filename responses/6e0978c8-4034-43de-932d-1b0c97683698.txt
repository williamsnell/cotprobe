Okay, so I've got this problem about three researchers determining the gas constant R using different methods. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I'll think it through.

First, the question says each researcher used 1 mole of an ideal gas at 273 K. They all used the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, right? Since n is 1 mole, the equation simplifies to PV = RT, so R = PV/T.

Let me look at each researcher one by one.

The first researcher found that at 1 atm, the gas occupies 22.4 liters. So P is 1 atm, V is 22.4 L, n is 1, T is 273 K. Plugging into R = PV/(nT). Since n is 1, R = (1 atm * 22.4 L) / (273 K). I remember that 22.4 L is the molar volume at STP (standard temperature and pressure), which is 1 atm and 273 K. So R should be (22.4 L·atm)/(273 K·mol) = 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol). So the first researcher's R is 0.0821.

The second researcher found the same volume, 22.4 L, but the pressure is 760 torr. Wait, 760 torr is equal to 1 atm because 1 atm = 760 mmHg (torr). So this is the same pressure as the first researcher. So why would the R be different? Oh, wait, because the units are different. Let me calculate R for this case.

R = PV/(nT) = (760 torr * 22.4 L) / (273 K). But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. The standard R value in L·atm/(K·mol) is 0.0821, but if I'm using torr, I need to convert it to atm or adjust the units accordingly. Alternatively, I can think about whether 760 torr equals 1 atm.

Wait, 760 torr is exactly 1 atm. So P is 1 atm, same as the first researcher. So why would the second researcher get a different R? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again: R has units in terms of pressure units. So if the first researcher used atm, their R is in L·atm/(mol·K). The second researcher used torr, but since 760 torr = 1 atm, then P = 760 torr equals 1 atm. So when they compute R, it's (760 torr * 22.4 L) / (273 K) = (760 * 22.4) / 273 in units of (torr·L)/(K·mol). But torr is 1/760 atm, so 760 torr = 1 atm. So let's compute that.

R = (760 torr * 22.4 L) / (273 K * 1 mol) = (760 * 22.4) / 273 in (torr·L)/(mol·K). Let me calculate that: 760 *22.4 = 17,024. 17,024 / 273 ≈ 62.46. Hmm, but that's in torr·L/(mol·K). To convert torr to atm, since 1 atm = 760 torr, 1 torr = 1/760 atm. So R in L·atm/(mol·K) would be 62.46 * (1/760) ≈ 0.0821, same as the first researcher. Wait, but that would mean both first and second have R=0.0821. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Oh wait, maybe the second researcher didn't convert torr to atm. Let me think: If the units for P are in torr, then when calculating R, the units would be in L·torr/(mol·K). But R is usually given in L·atm. So unless they converted to atm, their R would be different. Let me compute it without converting units. So R = (760 torr * 22.4 L)/(273 K) = (760 *22.4)/(273) ≈ (17024)/273 ≈ 62.46 (L·torr)/(mol·K). Now, to express this in L·atm/(mol·K), since 760 torr = 1 atm, so 1 torr = 1/760 atm. So 62.46 (L·torr) = 62.46 * (1/760) L·atm ≈ 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So both first and second researchers would get R=0.0821. But that can't be right because the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the second researcher didn't convert the pressure to atm but kept it in torr, so their R would be in different units. Let me recalculate without unit conversion. So R = (760 torr * 22.4 L) / (273 K) = (760 *22.4)/273 = 62.46 (L·torr)/(K·mol). But if we express R in L·atm/(K·mol), then since 1 atm = 760 torr, we have to convert R accordingly. So 62.46 (L·torr) = 62.46 /760 L·atm = 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol). So both researchers 1 and 2 get R=0.0821. But looking at the options, option C says both are 0.0821, but the third researcher's R is 0.0821 cal/(mol·K), which might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something with the third researcher.

Wait, the third researcher reported the product of pressure and volume as 542 cal. So P*V = 542 cal. From PV = nRT, with n=1, T=273 K. So 542 cal = R * 273 K. So R = 542 cal /273 K ≈ 1.985 cal/(K·mol), which is approximately 1.99 cal/(mol·K). Now, I need to relate this to R in other units. Because R is a constant, but its value depends on the units used. The standard R in cal/(mol·K) is about 1.987 cal/(mol·K), which rounds to ~2.0 cal/(mol·K), so 1.99 is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what value each researcher determined for R. So the first two used R in L·atm/(mol·K), and the third used R in cal/(mol·K). 

Wait, but let me think again. The first researcher used P in atm and V in liters, so R comes out to 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). The second researcher used P in torr but since it's 760 torr = 1 atm, R would still be 0.0821. But wait, no, because the second researcher's calculation is in torr and liters. Let me see: R = (760 torr *22.4 L)/(273 K) = 62.46 (L·torr)/(mol·K). But 1 L·torr is equal to (1/760) L·atm. So 62.46 * (1/760) L·atm/(mol·K) = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), same as the first researcher. So first and second both get 0.0821.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says all three are 0.0821, but the third researcher's R is in cal. Option E says first and second are 0.0821 and the third is 1.99 cal/(mol·K). But the third researcher's R is 1.99 cal/(mol·K). So the correct R values would be: first 0.0821, second 0.0821, third 1.99. But looking at the options, option C has all 0.0821 and third is 0.0821 cal, which seems wrong because 0.0821 cal would be much smaller. So perhaps the third researcher's R is 1.99 cal/(mol·K), while first and second are 0.0821 in L·atm units. So looking at the options, option C has first and second as 0.0821, third as 0.0821 cal, which is not correct. Option E has first and second as 0.0821, third as 1.99 cal, which matches. So option E would be: first and second 0.0821 (L·atm/(K·mol)), third 1.99 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but let me check the third researcher's calculation again. PV is 542 cal. So R = PV/(nT) = 542 cal / (273 K) ≈ 1.985 cal/(mol·K), which is approximately 1.99. So the third researcher's R is 1.99 cal/(mol·K). So the first and second have R=0.0821 in L·atm units, the third has R=1.99 in cal units. So the correct option should be option E: first and second 0.0821, third 1.99. Looking at the options:

Option E: A: 0.0821, 1.99, 0.0821 cal. No, that's not it. Wait, let me check each option.

Option A: first 0.0821, second 1.99, third 0.0821 cal. No, because second researcher's R should be 0.0821.

Option B: first 1.99, second 0.0821, third 1.99. No, because first and second are both 0.0821.

Option C: all 0.0821, third 0.0821 cal. No, because third is 1.99.

Option D: first 0.0821, second 1.99, third 1.99. No, because second should be 0.0821.

Option E: first and second 0.0821, third 1.99. Yes, that's correct.

Option F: all 1.99, no.

So the correct answer should be option E.
</think>

The first researcher used pressure in atm and volume in liters, leading to R = 0.0821 (L·atm)/(K·mol). The second researcher used pressure in torr (760 torr = 1 atm), but since the pressure is equivalent to 1 atm, the calculated R is also 0.0821 (L·atm)/(K·mol). The third researcher reported the product of pressure and volume as 542 cal, which corresponds to R ≈ 1.99 cal/(mol·K). Therefore, the correct option is:

E: 0.0821 [(l-atm)/(K-mole)], 0.0821 [(l-atm)/(K-mole)], 1.99 cal/mole K.
