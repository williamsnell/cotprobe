Okay, so I've got this question about the cost of preferred stock for Lei-Feng, Inc. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that Lei-Feng's preferred stock has a par value of $100. They just paid a $10 annual dividend. The current market price is $96 per share. The tax rate is 40%, but wait, I remember that for preferred stock, the cost calculation is a bit different from, say, debt. Oh right, because preferred dividends are typically not tax-deductible like interest is. So the tax rate might not affect the cost of preferred stock. Or does it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me recall. For equity components, like common stock, the cost isn't affected by taxes because dividends aren't tax-deductible. But for debt, the interest is tax-deductible, so the after-tax cost of debt is lower. But here, the question is about preferred stock, which is a type of equity. So the tax rate shouldn't come into play for the cost of preferred stock. Therefore, maybe the tax rate is a red herring here, or perhaps it's not needed for this particular calculation.

So the formula for the cost of preferred stock (Kp) is the annual dividend divided by the current market price. That makes sense because it's similar to the required return on the stock. So Kp = D / P.

Given that D is $10 and P is $96, plugging those in: 10 divided by 96. Let me do that math. 10 / 96 equals approximately 0.104166..., which is about 10.4166%. So looking at the options, E is 10.4 percent, which is very close to that number.

Wait, but why does the question mention the tax rate then? Maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps because the firm's overall capital structure includes debt and equity, and the tax rate affects the cost of debt but not preferred stock. So when the firm calculates the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the tax rate would only apply to the debt component, not the preferred stock part. So in this case, for the component cost of preferred stock, we ignore the tax rate because it's an equity component.

So yeah, the calculation is straightforward: 10 / 96. Let me double-check that. 96 times 0.104166 is 10, right? 96 * 0.104166 â‰ˆ 10. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, E is 10.4%, which is the closest to our calculated 10.4166%. So the answer should be E.

The cost of preferred stock is calculated as the annual dividend divided by the current market price. Given that the dividend is $10 and the market price is $96, the cost is approximately 10.4166%, which rounds to 10.4%. 

Answer: E
