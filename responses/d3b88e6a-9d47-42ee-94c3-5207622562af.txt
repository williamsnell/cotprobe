Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about buying a piano with an installment plan. Let me read the question again carefully.

The piano costs $1250, and there's a 4 and a half percent tax added. Then, it's purchased on an installment plan where the first payment is 10% of the cash value. The rest is paid over 18 months, and there's a service charge of 12% added to the unpaid balance. I need to find the monthly installment and the total cost.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the tax. The piano is $1250, and the tax is 4.5%. So, I'll compute 4.5% of 1250. 

4.5% as a decimal is 0.045. So, 1250 * 0.045 equals... let's see, 1250 * 0.04 is 50, and 1250 * 0.005 is 6.25. Adding those together, 50 + 6.25 = 56.25. So the tax is $56.25.

Adding that to the original price, the total cash price is 1250 + 56.25 = $1306.25.

Next, there's a down payment of 10% of the cash value. So, 10% of 1306.25. 10% is 0.1, so 1306.25 * 0.1 = $130.625. Let's round that to $130.63 for easier calculation.

So, the down payment is $130.63. The balance after that would be 1306.25 - 130.63. Let me subtract that: 1306.25 minus 130.63 is 1175.62. So, the balance to be paid over 18 months is $1175.62.

But wait, there's a service charge of 12% added to the unpaid balance. Hmm, does that mean the service charge is calculated on the initial balance or the reduced balance? I think it's added to the unpaid balance after the down payment. So, the unpaid balance is $1175.62, and then 12% service charge is added to that.

Calculating 12% of 1175.62: 1175.62 * 0.12. Let me compute that. 1000 * 0.12 is 120, 175.62 * 0.12 is approximately 21.0744. Adding them together: 120 + 21.0744 = 141.0744. So, the service charge is about $141.07.

Adding that to the unpaid balance: 1175.62 + 141.07 = 1316.69. So, the total amount to be paid over the 18 months is $1316.69.

Now, to find the monthly installment, I need to divide this total by 18 months. So, 1316.69 / 18. Let me calculate that. 

1316.69 divided by 18. Well, 18 * 70 is 1260. Subtracting that from 1316.69 gives 56.69 left. 56.69 divided by 18 is approximately 3.149. So, adding that to 70, the monthly payment is around 73.15.

Wait, let me check that division more accurately. 18 * 73 is 1314. So, 1316.69 - 1314 = 2.69. So, 2.69 / 18 â‰ˆ 0.149. So, total is about $73.15 per month.

Looking at the options, let's see which one has around $73.10 as the monthly installment. Option H is $73.40 and $1448. Let me check the total cost.

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the total cost. Let me recalculate. The down payment is $130.63, and the total installment is 18 * 73.15 = 1316.70. Adding the down payment: 130.63 + 1316.70 = 1447.33. So, approximately $1447.33, which is close to option H's $1448.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Piano price: $1250. Tax: 4.5% of 1250 = 56.25. Total cash price: 1250 + 56.25 = 1306.25.

2. Down payment: 10% of 1306.25 = 130.625. Unpaid balance after down payment: 1306.25 - 130.625 = 1175.625.

3. Service charge: 12% of 1175.625 = 141.075. So, total balance including service charge: 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.7.

4. Monthly payment: 1316.7 / 18 = 73.15. So, approximately $73.15 per month.

5. Total cost: Down payment + installments. 130.625 + (18 * 73.15) = 130.625 + 1316.7 = 1447.325, which is about $1447.33.

Looking at the options, H is $73.40 and $1448. This is the closest. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option D is $71.10 and $1422. That seems lower. Option G is $77.50 and $1550, which is higher. So, H seems to be the correct one.

Wait, but let's check the exact figures. Service charge is 12% of the unpaid balance after down payment, which is 1175.625. So, 1175.625 * 0.12 = 141.075. Adding that gives 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.7. Divided by 18 is 73.15. So, $73.15 per month. The options have H as $73.40, which is close but not exact. Did I make a rounding error?

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places. Let's compute 12% of 1175.625 exactly.

1175.625 * 0.12 = (1175 + 0.625) * 0.12 = (1175 * 0.12) + (0.625 * 0.12) = 141 + 0.075 = 141.075.

So, the total is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.7 exactly. So, 1316.7 / 18 = 73.15.

So, the monthly payment is $73.15, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest is H, $73.40, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the service charge. Wait, the service charge is added to the unpaid balance. So, is the service charge added only once, or is it compounded monthly? The question says a service charge of 12% was added to the unpaid balance. It doesn't specify if it's compounded, so I think it's a one-time addition.

So, perhaps the correct total is $1316.7, leading to a monthly payment of $73.15, and the total cost is $1447.33. The options don't have 73.15, but H is 73.40 and 1448. That's the closest, so I think H is the intended answer.

The piano costs $1250 with a 4.5% tax, totaling $1306.25. A 10% down payment ($130.63) leaves a balance of $1175.62. A 12% service charge adds $141.08, making the total installment amount $1316.70. Divided over 18 months, the monthly payment is approximately $73.15. The total cost, including the down payment, is around $1447.33. The closest option is H: $73.40 and $1448.
