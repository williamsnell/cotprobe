<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ruby laser aimed at a target 10,000 kilometers away. The laser beam starts with a diameter of 14 mm, and I need to figure out what the diameter is when it hits the target. The wavelength given is 694.3 nm. Hmm, I think I remember something about the diffraction of light and how beams spread out over distance. Let me try to work this out step by step.

First, I remember that when a laser beam travels through space, especially over long distances, it spreads out due to diffraction. The formula for the beam's diameter after some distance is probably related to the wavelength and the original beam's characteristics. I think the formula involves the wavelength, the initial beam size, and the distance to the target. Oh right, the formula is something like the final diameter D equals (lambda * L) divided by the initial diameter d. Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again.

Oh wait, I think the correct formula is D = (lambda * L) / d. Let me check the units to make sure. Lambda is in nanometers, L is kilometers, and d is millimeters. I'll need to convert all units to meters to keep it consistent. So lambda is 694.3 nm, which is 694.3e-9 meters. L is 10,000 km, which is 10,000,000 meters. The initial diameter d is 14 mm, which is 0.014 meters.

Plugging the numbers into the formula: D = (694.3e-9 m * 10,000,000 m) / 0.014 m. Let me compute that. First, multiply 694.3e-9 by 10,000,000. 694.3e-9 * 1e7 is 694.3e-2, which is 69.43. Then, divide that by 0.014. So 69.43 / 0.014. Hmm, 69.43 divided by 0.014. Let me calculate that. 

Well, 0.014 times 4960 is about 69.44. So approximately, 69.43 / 0.014 is around 4960. So D is about 4960 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 4960 m. The options are all around 1000 to 2000 m. Hmm, did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Oh! I think the correct formula for the beam diameter after propagating a distance L is D = (lambda * L) / (pi * d/2). Because the initial beam's waist is related to the beam's radius. Alternatively, I might have confused the formula with the divergence angle formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the beam's divergence angle theta is approximately lambda / (pi * d). Then, the beam diameter after distance L would be D = 2 * L * tan(theta). Since theta is small, tan(theta) is approximately equal to theta in radians. So D ≈ 2 * L * theta ≈ 2 * L * (lambda / (pi * d)).

Let me recalculate using this corrected formula. So D = (2 * L * lambda) / (pi * d). Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 10,000,000 m * 694.3e-9 m / (pi * 0.014 m).

Let me compute the numerator first: 2 * 1e7 * 694.3e-9 = 2 * (1e7 * 6.943e-7) ) = 2 * (6.943) ≈ 13.886.

Denominator: pi * 0.014 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.014 ≈ 0.04398.

So D ≈ 13.886 / 0.04398 ≈ 315 m. Hmm, 315 meters isn't one of the options either. Wait, that can't be right because the options are much larger, like 1000 m and up.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me double-check the unit conversions. Lambda is 694.3 nm = 694.3e-9 m. L is 10,000 km = 10^4 km = 10^7 meters. Initial diameter d is 14 mm = 0.014 m.

Let me recompute D using the first formula I thought of, D = (lambda * L) / d.

So (694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m) / 0.014 m = (694.3e-2) / 0.014 = 69.43 / 0.014 = approx 4960 m. But that's 4.96 km, which isn't an option either.

Wait, the options are all about a thousand meters. Hmm. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again about diffraction. The formula for the far field beam diameter is given by D ≈ (lambda * L) / (d / 2). Because the initial beam's radius is d/2, so the formula might involve the radius.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is D = (lambda * L) / (d/2), which is (2 lambda L) / d. Let me try that. So D = (2 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m) / 0.014 m.

Compute numerator: 2 * 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 2 * 694.3e-2 = 2 * 6.943 = 13.886.

Denominator: 0.014 m.

So D = 13.886 / 0.014 ≈ 992 meters. Wait, that's about 992 m, which is close to option H: 1000 m. But option H is 1000 m. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Wait, let me compute 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 694.3 * 1e-9 * 1e7 = 694.3 * 1e-2 = 6.943.

Then multiply by 2: 13.886.

Divide by 0.014: 13.886 / 0.014 = let's compute that accurately.

0.014 × 992 = 0.014 × 1000 =14, minus 0.014 ×8=0.112 → 14-0.112=13.888. So yeah, 0.014 ×992≈13.888, which matches the numerator. So D ≈992 m, which is about 1000 m, option H.

Wait, but the initial formula I used was D = (2 λ L) / d. Wait, but wait, actually, the formula I've seen before is the beam's waist expanding, and the far field approximation is D ≈ (λ L)/(π w_0), where w_0 is the initial beam radius. So w_0 is d/2, so substituting, D= (λ L)/(π (d/2)) )= (2 λ L)/(π d).

So plugging in the numbers: D = (2 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m) / (π * 0.014 m).

Compute numerator: 2 * 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 2 * 694.3e-2 = 2 * 6.943 = 13.886.

Denominator: π * 0.014 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.014 ≈ 0.04398.

So D ≈ 13.886 / 0.04398 ≈ 315.2 m. Wait, that's about 315 m, which isn't matching any options. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: The formula for the beam diameter after propagating a distance L is D = (λ * L) / (w_0), where w_0 is the initial beam radius. So since w_0 is 7 mm (since diameter is 14 mm), that's 0.007 meters.

So D = (694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m) / 0.007 m.

Compute numerator: 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 694.3e-2 = 6.943.

Divide by 0.007: 6.943 / 0.007 = approx 991.85 m, which is about 992 m, so 1000 m, option H.

Wait, but when I used the formula with 2λL/d earlier, I got 992 m, which is about 1000 m. Then why when I used the formula with (λ L)/(π w_0) did I get 315 m? Oh, perhaps because that formula is for the divergence angle, and perhaps I'm confusing the formulas.

Alternatively, maybe the formula D = (λ L) / (d/2) is correct, where d is the initial diameter. Because when the beam propagates, the diameter increases proportionally. Let me think: the diffraction limit says that the beam can't be focused below a certain size, but for the divergence, the formula I think is D ≈ (λ L)/(d/2) → D = 2λL/d.

So with that, D = 2*694.3e-9 m *1e7 m / 0.014 m.

Compute numerator: 2 *694.3e-9 *1e7 = 2 * 694.3e-2 = 2 *6.943=13.886.

Divide by 0.014: 13.886 / 0.014 ≈992 m.

So that's about 992 m, which is approximately 1000 m, option H.

But looking at the options, option H is 1000 m. But wait, the initial calculation using 2λL/d gives 992 m, which is close to 1000, but perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Wait, maybe I should use exact numbers without approximating. Let me compute more precisely.

Compute 2*694.3e-9 m *1e7 m = 2 * 694.3e-2 m² = 2*6.943 m² = 13.886 m².

Now, divide by 0.014 m: 13.886 m² / 0.014 m = 992 m.

Hmm, that's 992 meters. Looking at the options, the closest is H: 1000 m. But wait, option E is 1410 m, which is larger. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is D = (lambda * L) / (d/2) * 1.22, because the formula for the far field diffraction uses the 1.22 factor from the Airy disk. So maybe the correct formula includes that factor.

Wait, the formula for the far field beam diameter when the beam is focused is D = (1.22 * lambda * L) / w_0, where w_0 is the initial beam radius. So w_0 is 7 mm, so 0.007 m.

So D = (1.22 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m) / 0.007 m.

Compute numerator: 1.22 * 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 1.22 * 694.3e-2 = 1.22 *6.943≈8.477.

Denominator: 0.007 m.

So D ≈8.477 / 0.007 ≈1211 m.

Wait, that's approximately 1210 m, which is option B. But wait, earlier without the 1.22 factor, I got about 992 m, which is 1000 m. Now with 1.22, it's around 1210 m. But which formula is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (lambda * L) / (d/2) → D = 2 λ L / d.

So 2*694.3e-9 *1e7 /0.014 = (13.886)/0.014=992 m.

But if the formula uses the 1.22 factor, then it's 1211 m, which is option B:1210 m.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about why the 1.22 factor is included. The 1.22 factor comes from the Airy disk's first minimum, which relates to the diffraction pattern. So when you're calculating the beam waist after propagating, you might include that factor. Alternatively, perhaps the initial formula I used without the 1.22 is correct because the beam's divergence is given by θ = λ/(π w_0), and then D = 2 L tanθ ≈ 2 L θ when θ is small.

So θ = λ/(π w_0) = 694.3e-9 / (π * 0.007) ≈694.3e-9 / (0.02199) ≈3.15e-5 radians.

Then D = 2 * L * θ ≈ 2 * 1e7 m *3.15e-5 ≈ 2 * 315 ≈630 meters. Hmm, that's about 630 m, which isn't matching any options. So I think I must be getting the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the far field beam diameter, which is D ≈ (lambda * L) / (w_0), without the 1.22 factor. Let me compute that.

w_0 is 7 mm =0.007 m.

So D = (694.3e-9 m *1e7 m) /0.007 m = (694.3e-2) /0.007 =6.943/0.007≈991.86 m. So about 992 m, which is 1000 m. So option H: 1000 m.

But wait, another source I remember says that the beam diameter after propagating L is D = (2 * lambda * L) / (pi * w_0), where w_0 is the initial beam radius. Let me compute that.

So D = (2 * 694.3e-9 *1e7) / (pi *0.007).

Compute numerator: 2 *694.3e-9 *1e7=2*694.3e-2=2*6.943=13.886.

Denominator: pi *0.007≈0.02199.

So D≈13.886/0.02199≈630 m, which again doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between beam divergence and the actual diameter due to diffraction. Let me think of it another way. The diffraction limit is such that the beam cannot be focused below a certain size, but when propagating, the beam expands. The formula for the beam's diameter after propagating a distance L is D = (lambda * L) / w_0, where w_0 is the initial beam radius.

So, with w_0=7 mm=0.007 m,

D = (694.3e-9 m *1e7 m)/0.007 m = (694.3e-2)/0.007 =6.943/0.007≈991.86 m.

So about 992 m, which is 1000 m, option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the initial diameter d instead of the radius. Let me try that. So if D = (lambda * L) / (d/2) → 2 lambda L / d.

So D = 2*694.3e-9 *1e7 /0.014 = (13.886)/0.014≈992 m. Same result as before.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 992 meters, which rounds to 1000 meters, option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1410 m, which is about 1.41 times 1000 m. Perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Did I forget to consider the refractive index or something else? No, it's in free space, so refractive index is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (lambda * L * 2) / d, which would give 2*694.3e-9 *1e7 /0.014= same as before.

Wait, but let's check the options again. The options are:

A: 1600 m

B: 1210 m

C: 1500 m

D: 1700 m

E: 1410 m

F: 2000 m

G: 1800 m

H: 1000 m

I: 1310 m

J: 1900 m

So H is 1000 m, and E is 1410. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate more accurately without approximations.

Compute D = (2 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m) / 0.014 m.

Compute 2 * 694.3e-9 = 1388.6e-9 = 1.3886e-6.

Multiply by 1e7: 1.3886e-6 *1e7=13.886.

Divide by 0.014: 13.886 /0.014= ?

Let me compute 13.886 divided by 0.014.

0.014 * 992 = 0.014*(1000-8)=0.014*1000=14 - 0.014*8=0.112 →14-0.112=13.888.

So 0.014 *992=13.888, which is just a little over 13.886. So 992 *0.014=13.888, which is 0.002 more than 13.886.

So 992 *0.014 =13.888 → 13.886 is 0.002 less. So 992 - (0.002 /0.014) → 0.002/0.014≈0.1429. So approximately 991.857 m.

So D≈991.86 m, which is about 992 m. So the closest option is H:1000 m.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the correct formula for beam diameter after propagation. I found a source that says the beam diameter D after propagating a distance L is given by D = (2 * lambda * L) / (pi * w0), where w0 is the initial beam radius. So w0 =7 mm = 0.007 m.

So D= (2 *694.3e-9 *1e7) / (pi *0.007).

Compute numerator: 2 *694.3e-9 *1e7 =2 *694.3e-2=2 *6.943=13.886.

Denominator: pi *0.007 ≈0.02199.

So D≈13.886 /0.02199≈630.5 m.

Wait, that's about 630 m, which isn't an option. So now I'm really confused. Which formula is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (lambda * L) / (d/2) → D=2 lambda L /d.

Which gives us 992 m, which is the same as before. So perhaps the correct formula is D=2 lambda L /d, which gives 992 m, so option H:1000 m.

But then why does the other formula give 630 m? Maybe I'm mixing up beam waists and something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the beam's divergence angle.

The divergence angle theta is approximately lambda/(pi*w0), where w0 is the initial beam radius. So theta = 694.3e-9 / (pi *0.007) → 694.3e-9 / (0.02199) ≈3.15e-5 radians.

Then, the beam diameter after distance L is D = 2 * L * tan(theta) ≈ 2 * L * theta, since theta is small.

So D≈2 *1e7 *3.15e-5=2*315=630 m.

Wait, that's 630 m. But that's not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually D= (lambda * L) / (d/2) → D=2 lambda L/d.

So D=2 *694.3e-9 *1e7 /0.014.

Compute 2 *694.3e-9=1.3886e-6.

Multiply by 1e7: 1.3886e-6 *1e7=13.886.

Divide by 0.014: 13.886/0.014=992 m.

So that's 992 m, which is about 1000 m. So option H:1000 m.

I think the confusion arises from the correct formula. Some sources use D=2 lambda L/d, others might include factors like pi or 1.22. But given that the options don't have 630 m, and the closest is 1000 m, I think the intended formula is D=2 lambda L/d.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 1000 m, option H.
</think>

To determine the diameter of the laser beam when it hits the target, we use the formula for beam diameter after propagating a distance \( L \):

\[
D = \frac{2 \lambda L}{d}
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda = 694.3 \, \text{nm} = 694.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)
- \( L = 10,000 \, \text{km} = 10^7 \, \text{m} \)
- \( d = 14 \, \text{mm} = 0.014 \, \text{m} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
D = \frac{2 \times (694.3 \times 10^{-9}) \times 10^7}{0.014}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \times (694.3 \times 10^{-9}) \times 10^7 = 2 \times 694.3 \times 10^{-2} = 2 \times 6.943 = 13.886
\]

Now, divide by the denominator:

\[
D = \frac{13.886}{0.014} \approx 992 \, \text{m}
\]

This result is approximately \( 992 \, \text{m} \), which rounds to \( 1000 \, \text{m} \). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**H: 1000 m**

ANSWER: H
