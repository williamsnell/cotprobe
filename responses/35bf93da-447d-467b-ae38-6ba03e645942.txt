Question:

A young person with no initial capital invests $k$ dollars per year at an annual rate of return $r$. Assume that investments are made continuously and that the return is compounded continuously.
If $r=7.5 \%$, determine $k$ so that $\$ 1$ million will be available for retirement in 40 years.

Options:

A: 5000 $
B: 3500 $
C: $3000
D: $7000
E: $5500
F: $2500
G: $7500
H:  3930 $
I: $6000
J: 4500 $

Okay, so I need to figure out how much a young person should invest each year, continuously, to reach $1 million in 40 years with a 7.5% annual return rate. Hmm, I remember that continuous investments involve some calculus, maybe integrating the continuous contributions over time with continuous compounding.

Let me think, the formula for continuous contributions is probably something like the future value of a continuous annuity. I think the formula is FV = (k / r) * (e^(rT) - 1), where FV is the future value, k is the annual contribution, r is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years.

So, given that, FV is $1,000,000, r is 7.5% which is 0.075, and T is 40 years. I need to solve for k.

Let me write down the equation:

1,000,000 = (k / 0.075) * (e^(0.075 * 40) - 1)

First, calculate e^(0.075 * 40). Let me compute 0.075 * 40. That's 3. So e^3. What's e^3? I think e is approximately 2.71828, so e^3 is about 20.0855.

So plugging that back in:

1,000,000 = (k / 0.075) * (20.0855 - 1)
1,000,000 = (k / 0.075) * 19.0855

Now, solve for k. Rearrange the equation:

k = (1,000,000 * 0.075) / 19.0855

Calculate 1,000,000 * 0.075 first. That's 75,000.

Then divide by 19.0855: 75,000 / 19.0855 ≈ ?

Let me do that division. Let's see, 19.0855 times 3 is 57.2565, which is too low. Wait, no, I'm just trying to calculate 75,000 divided by approximately 19.0855.

Alternatively, 19.0855 * 3930 ≈ 75,000? Let me check: 19.0855 * 3930. Hmm, 19 * 3930 is 74,670, and 0.0855 * 3930 is around 335. So total is about 74,670 + 335 = 74, 1005? Wait, maybe I should just compute 75,000 / 19.0855.

Let me compute 19.0855 × 3930:

First, 19 × 3930 = 74,670.

0.0855 × 3930 = approx 335.  0.08 × 3930 = 314.4, 0.0055 × 3930 ≈ 21.615. So total is 314.4 +21.615 ≈ 336.

So 74,670 + 336 = 75,006. So 19.0855 × 3930 ≈ 75,006, which is very close to 75,000. So k ≈ 3930.

Looking at the options, H is $3930. So that's the answer.

H: $3930

The correct answer is H: $3930.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

To determine the continuous investment amount \( k \) needed to accumulate \$1,000,000 in 40 years with a 7.5% annual return rate, we use the future value formula for a continuous annuity:

\[
FV = \left( \frac{k}{r} \right) \left( e^{rT} - 1 \right)
\]

Given:
- \( FV = 1,000,000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.075 \) (7.5%)
- \( T = 40 \) years

1. Calculate \( e^{rT} \):
   \[
   e^{0.075 \times 40} = e^{3} \approx 20.0855
   \]

2. Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   1,000,000 = \left( \frac{k}{0.075} \right) \left( 20.0855 - 1 \right)
   \]
   \[
   1,000,000 = \left( \frac{k}{0.075} \right) (19.0855)
   \]

3. Solve for \( k \):
   \[
   k = \frac{1,000,000 \times 0.075}{19.0855} \approx 3930
   \]

Thus, the required annual investment is approximately \$3930.
