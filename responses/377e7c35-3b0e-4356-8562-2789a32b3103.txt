Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Keynesian economics and why they started using both monetary and fiscal policies after initially rejecting monetary policy. Hmm, I remember that Keynesians were big on fiscal policy, like using government spending and taxation to manage the economy. But why did they change their minds?

The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A says the rise of monetarism influenced them. Monetarism is a theory that emphasizes the role of money supply in determining economic performance. Milton Friedman was a big proponent. If monetarism became influential, maybe Keynesians started to incorporate some of those ideas. That sounds plausible.

Option B says it's because of the unavailability of empirical research on monetary policy. That doesn't make much sense. If there wasn't much research, why would they suddenly change? Maybe the oppositeâ€”more research would drive the change. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C is about technological stagnation. I don't think that's directly related to the shift in policy preferences. It seems more about economic growth factors rather than policy effectiveness.

Option D suggests a new economic theory replaced Keynesian economics. But the question says they included both policies, not that they abandoned Keynesian ideas. So D might not be the case.

Option E says fiscal policy's ineffectiveness during high inflation. If fiscal policy wasn't working, maybe they looked for alternatives like monetary policy. But wait, I thought fiscal policy was about government spending and taxes, and maybe when that didn't work, especially in certain situations like high inflation, they turned to monetary tools. So E could be a reason.

Option F mentions lack of changes in money supply. If the money supply wasn't changing, why would they adopt monetary policy? That seems contradictory, so F might not be it.

Option G is about increased government regulation in financial markets. I'm not sure how that directly leads to including monetary policy. Maybe more regulation makes monetary policy more necessary, but I'm not certain.

Option H says failure of fiscal policy predictions and empirical research on money supply. So if fiscal policies didn't work as expected, and they saw evidence from money supply changes, they might have included monetary policy. That makes sense. Because if the initial reliance on fiscal policy didn't achieve the desired results, especially in certain economic conditions, they would look elsewhere. Plus, empirical research showing that money supply does affect the economy would make them change their minds.

Option I is the success of fiscal policy in controlling inflation. If fiscal policy was successful, why add monetary policy? That doesn't align with the question, which is about changing their minds after initial rejection of monetary policy. So I think I is not the answer.

Option J is about international trade impacting domestic monetary policy. I'm not sure how that would lead to the inclusion of both policies. It might be more about how external factors influence monetary decisions, but not necessarily why they started using both.

So, considering all this, the main reasons seem to be either H or A. The question says after the initial rejection, so why did they change? If their fiscal policies weren't working as predicted, and empirical evidence showed that monetary policy could be effective, they might change. That points to H. Alternatively, the influence of monetarism (A) might have convinced them. 

I think H is more about the failure of their own predictions and empirical evidence, which would naturally lead them to reconsider. Monetarism's rise (A) might have been a factor too, but perhaps H is the direct cause because it's about their own experiences and research showing that fiscal policy alone wasn't enough.

The correct answer is H: Failure of predictions based on fiscal policy and empirical research on effects of changes in money supply.

Answer: H
