Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option correctly describes the algebraic representation of the fitted regression line. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a regression line is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simple linear regression, which I think is what this question is about, there's just one independent variable.

The general form of a simple linear regression model is usually written as y = α + βx + u, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, α is the intercept, β is the slope, and u is the error term. The hat (ŷ) is used to denote the predicted or fitted value of y.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing up the population model and the fitted model. The population model includes the error term u, but the fitted regression line, which is based on the sample data, doesn't have the error term because it's trying to estimate the expected value of y given x. So the fitted line equation should be ŷ = α_hat + β_hat x_t. The hats are on the estimates of the parameters, right?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: ŷ_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t squared + u_t. That seems like a quadratic model because of x_t squared. But the question is about the fitted regression line, which is linear. So A is probably not correct unless it's a higher-order regression, but the question doesn't specify that. So I can rule out A.

Option B: ŷ_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t + u_t. Wait, this includes an error term u_t, but in the fitted regression line, the error term is not present because ŷ is the predicted value, not the actual y. So B might not be correct because the fitted model shouldn't have u_t. Or does it? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Option C: ŷ_t = α_hat x_t + β_hat x_t. That would be like combining the intercept and slope terms into x_t terms, but that doesn't make sense because the intercept is a constant, not multiplied by x_t. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: y_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t + u_t. Here, y_t is on the left without a hat, which suggests it's the actual observed y, not the predicted ŷ. But the question is about the fitted regression line, which is the predicted ŷ, so D might not be the right one.

Option E: ŷ_t = α_hat + β_hat. That would mean the equation is only the intercept term, which doesn't include the x variable. That can't be right because a regression line should have both intercept and slope terms unless it's forced through the origin, which isn't indicated here. So E is likely wrong.

Option F: ŷ_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t. This looks correct because it's just the intercept and slope multiplied by x_t, without any error term, which makes sense for the fitted line. So F is a strong candidate.

Option G: y_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t. Here, y_t is actual y, not the predicted ŷ. The fitted line is about ŷ, so G might not be correct unless the model is perfect, which it's not. So G is probably not the answer.

Option H: ŷ_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t + u_t. Similar to B, this has an error term in the fitted line, which I think is incorrect because the fitted line is the estimated expectation, not including the error. So H is likely wrong.

Option I: y_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t + u_t. Again, this is the actual y with error, not the fitted ŷ, so I is not the fitted line equation.

Option J: ŷ_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t + u_t + v_t. This has two error terms, which doesn't make sense. The fitted line shouldn't have any error terms, so J is incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the correct representation should be the fitted line without the error term, just the intercept and slope times x_t. That points to option F: ŷ_t = α_hat + β_hat x_t.
</think>

The fitted regression line represents the estimated relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable, excluding the error term. The correct algebraic form is \hat{y}_t = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}x_t.
