Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.
"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place."

Okay, so I need to figure out which quote from the Progressive Party Platform, 1912, best exemplifies Jacob Riis's "How the Other Half Lives." Let me start by recalling what "muckraking" is. Muckrakers were journalists who exposed social issues, often in a way that aimed to reform society. Jacob Riis's book focused on the poor living conditions in urban areas, highlighting the struggles of the working class and the inequality they faced. He used his work to bring attention to these issues with the hope of prompting social change.

Now, looking at the platform excerpt, it's a political document outlining the Progressive Party's stance. The question is asking which part of this excerpt aligns with Riis's message. So I need to find a quote that relates to social justice, equality, or the need for reform.

Let me read through each option and see which one fits best. 

Option A: "the nation's sense of justice." That's a broad statement and does relate to social justice, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Option B: "without which no republic can endure." This seems to be talking about the importance of certain principles for the survival of the government, which is relevant, but I'm not certain yet.

Option C: "establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice." This directly mentions equal opportunity and industrial justice, which are key themes in muckraking literature like Riis's. He was concerned with the living conditions and inequality in industrial areas.

Option D: "the people are the masters of their Constitution." This is more about constitutional authority and popular sovereignty, which is important but might not directly tie into the specific issues Riis addressed.

Option E: "Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest." This talks about using resources and institutions for the public good, which aligns with the idea of promoting social welfare, something Riis aimed for.

Option F: "masters of their Constitution." Similar to D, but shorter. It's about popular sovereignty, not specifically about social issues.

Option G: "set the public welfare in the first place." This is about prioritizing public welfare, which is definitely in line with muckraking and Riis's goals.

Option H: "the people must use their sovereign powers." Again, focusing on the people's authority, more about governance than specific social issues.

Option I: "an instrument of injustice." This refers to the Constitution being misused, which is a point in the platform but not directly about the social reforms Riis was pushing.

Option J: "the duty laid upon us by our fathers." This is about a legacy or responsibility, but not directly tied to the specific issues.

Now, considering Riis's focus was on exposing the harsh living conditions and advocating for social reform, the best fit would be something that emphasizes establishing equality and industrial justice. So Option C talks about "equal opportunity and industrial justice," which directly relates to the kind of reforms Riis was pushing. Alternatively, Option G is about setting public welfare first, which is also a strong contender.

But looking back, the platform excerpt mentions "establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice" in Option C, which seems to directly address the social and economic issues that Riis's book aimed to highlight. Therefore, Option C seems like the most accurate choice.

The Progressive Party Platform emphasizes the need for "equal opportunity and industrial justice," which aligns with Jacob Riis's focus on social inequality and the need for reform. This directly ties to his muckraking efforts to highlight the struggles of the working class.
