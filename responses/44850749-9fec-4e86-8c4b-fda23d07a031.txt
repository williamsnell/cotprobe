Okay, so I need to find the volume of this solid S. The base is an elliptical region defined by the equation 9x² + 4y² = 36. The cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are isosceles right triangles with the hypotenuse lying on the base. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the volume of a solid with known cross-sectional areas can be found by integrating the cross-sectional area along the axis perpendicular to the cross-sections. In this case, since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis, I'll integrate with respect to x.

The equation of the ellipse is 9x² + 4y² = 36. I think it's useful to write this in standard form. To do that, I'll divide both sides by 36:

(9x²)/36 + (4y²)/36 = 1  
Simplifying, that's x²/4 + y²/9 = 1.

So, the ellipse has a semi-major axis of length 3 along the y-axis and a semi-minor axis of length 2 along the x-axis. That means the ellipse stretches from x = -2 to x = 2 on the x-axis.

Now, the cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are isosceles right triangles. I know that an isosceles right triangle has legs of equal length and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg. But in this problem, the hypotenuse is in the base, which is the ellipse. So, the hypotenuse lies along the base, which is the ellipse, and the legs are perpendicular to the x-axis.

Wait, no, the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis, so each cross-section is a triangle whose base is along the ellipse, and the legs are in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis. Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis, each triangle will have a base along the y-direction (since the ellipse is in the xy-plane), and the height will be along the x-direction? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, maybe I should think about how the triangles are oriented. The base of each triangle is the hypotenuse, which is part of the ellipse's boundary. So, for each x, the corresponding base of the triangle is a segment on the ellipse at that x. Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis, the triangles are oriented vertically, with their base (hypotenuse) lying on the ellipse and their height extending in the y-direction? No, wait, maybe the triangles have their hypotenuse on the ellipse, and their legs perpendicular and parallel to the y-axis.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cross-sections are taken perpendicular to the x-axis, so each cross-section is a plane parallel to the y-z plane, right? So, each cross-section is a 2D figure in the y-z plane, but since the base is in the xy-plane, maybe the cross-sections are triangles in the y-z plane, with their base along the y-axis.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. For each x, the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle. The hypotenuse of this triangle lies along the base, which is the ellipse. So, the hypotenuse is a chord of the ellipse at position x. Then, the legs of the triangle are equal in length and perpendicular to each other.

Wait, let me visualize this. Imagine slicing the solid with a plane perpendicular to the x-axis at a particular x. The intersection with the solid's base is a line segment on the ellipse at that x. That line segment is the hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle. So, the hypotenuse length is the length of the ellipse's boundary at that x.

Since the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse h, the legs would each be h / √2. Because in an isosceles right triangle, h = leg * √2, so leg = h / √2. The area of such a triangle would then be (1/2) * (h / √2) * (h / √2) = (1/2) * (h² / 2) = h² / 4.

Wait, let me confirm that. Area of a triangle is (base * height)/2. For an isosceles right triangle, the base and height are equal, each being h / √2. So, area = ( (h / √2) * (h / √2) ) / 2 = (h² / 2) / 2 = h² / 4. Yes, that's correct.

So, the area A(x) of the cross-section at position x is (h(x))² / 4, where h(x) is the length of the hypotenuse at that x.

Now, what is h(x)? Since the cross-section is perpendicular to the x-axis, the hypotenuse lies along the y-axis direction. So, at a given x, the ellipse's y-values will give the endpoints of the hypotenuse.

From the ellipse equation, 9x² + 4y² = 36, solving for y gives y² = (36 - 9x²)/4, so y = ±(sqrt(36 - 9x²))/2. So, the length of the hypotenuse at position x is the distance between y = (sqrt(36 - 9x²))/2 and y = -(sqrt(36 - 9x²))/2, which is 2*(sqrt(36 - 9x²))/2 = sqrt(36 - 9x²).

Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again. At a given x, the ellipse's y-values go from y = -a to y = a, where a is sqrt( (36 - 9x²)/4 ). So, the total length along the y-axis at that x is 2a, which is 2 * sqrt( (36 - 9x²)/4 ) = sqrt(36 - 9x²).

Wait, that's correct. So, the length of the hypotenuse h(x) at position x is sqrt(36 - 9x²).

So, the area A(x) = (h(x))² / 4 = (36 - 9x²) / 4.

Wait, because (h(x))² is (sqrt(36 -9x²))² = 36 -9x². So, A(x) = (36 -9x²)/4.

So, the volume V is the integral of A(x) from x = -2 to x = 2, because the ellipse extends from x = -2 to x = 2.

So, V = ∫ from -2 to 2 of (36 - 9x²)/4 dx.

I can factor out the 1/4, so V = (1/4) ∫ from -2 to 2 (36 -9x²) dx.

Let me compute this integral.

First, let's compute ∫ (36 -9x²) dx from -2 to 2.

The integral of 36 is 36x, and the integral of -9x² is -3x³. So, evaluating from -2 to 2:

At x=2: 36*(2) -3*(2)^3 = 72 - 3*8 = 72 -24 =48.

At x=-2: 36*(-2) -3*(-2)^3 = -72 -3*(-8) = -72 +24 = -48.

So, the definite integral is [48] - [-48] = 48 +48 =96.

Now, V = (1/4)*96 =24.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again:

Options: A:48, B:42, C:18, D:24, E:30, F:54, G:12, H:60, I:72, J:36.

So, D is 24, which would be the answer.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check the steps.

1. The ellipse equation is 9x² +4y² =36, which simplifies to x²/4 + y²/9 =1. So, semi-minor axis a=2, semi-major axis b=3.

2. At each x, the y-values go from -sqrt(9*(1 - x²/4)) to +sqrt(9*(1 -x²/4)), so the length is 2*sqrt(9*(1 -x²/4)) = 2*(3)*sqrt(1 -x²/4) =6*sqrt(1 -x²/4).

Wait, wait a second, earlier I thought h(x) was sqrt(36 -9x²). Let me check again.

Wait, from 9x² +4y²=36, solving for y:

4y²=36 -9x² → y² = (36 -9x²)/4 → y= ±sqrt( (36 -9x²)/4 )= ±(sqrt(36 -9x²))/2.

So, the length along y is from -sqrt( (36 -9x²)/4 ) to +sqrt( (36 -9x²)/4 ), which is 2*(sqrt( (36 -9x²)/4 )) = 2*(sqrt(36 -9x²)/2) )= sqrt(36 -9x²). So, yes, h(x)= sqrt(36 -9x²). Therefore, h²=36-9x².

So, A(x)= (36-9x²)/4. So, integrating from x=-2 to x=2.

Wait, when I compute the integral ∫ (36 -9x²) dx from -2 to 2:

The integral is 36x - 3x³ evaluated from -2 to 2.

At x=2: 36*(2) =72; 3*(2)^3=3*8=24. So, 72 -24=48.

At x=-2: 36*(-2)= -72; 3*(-2)^3=3*(-8)= -24. So, -72 - (-24)= -72 +24= -48.

So, the definite integral is 48 - (-48)= 96.

Multiply by 1/4: 96*(1/4)=24.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the volume is 24, which is option D.
</think>

The volume of the solid is calculated by integrating the area of the isosceles right triangle cross-sections along the x-axis. Each cross-section's hypotenuse is a chord of the ellipse at position x, with length derived from the ellipse equation. The area of each triangle is proportional to the square of the hypotenuse length. Integrating this area from x = -2 to x = 2 yields the volume, which evaluates to 24.
