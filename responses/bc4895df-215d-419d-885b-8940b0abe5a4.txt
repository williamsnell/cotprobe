Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about X-linked dominant inheritance. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to remember what X-linked dominant means. From what I recall, X-linked refers to genes that are located on the X chromosome. Now, dominant means that only one copy of the gene is needed to express the trait. So, in X-linked dominant disorders, the gene is on the X chromosome and it's dominant.

In general, males have an XY sex chromosome setup, so they have only one X (from their mother) and one Y (from their father). Females have two Xs, usually one from each parent.

In X-linked recessive conditions, like hemophilia, males are more likely to be affected because they only have one X. But this is the opposite because it's dominant. So, if a male has the dominant allele, he would definitely show the trait because he doesn't have another X to mask it.

Now, looking at transmission. For X-linked dominant, females can pass the gene to both sons and daughters. Because females have two X chromosomes, if one is affected, they can pass it on. Males, on the other hand, can only pass their X to their daughters because they give their Y to sons. So, a father can't pass an X-linked gene to his son because he gives the Y. 

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Transmitted by females only to males. Wait, females can pass X-linked genes to both sons and daughters. So this isn't correct because it's not only to males. They can pass it to both, but since it's dominant, any child receiving the X with the gene will show the trait.

Option B: Transmitted by males only to females. Males can pass their X only to daughters. So if a male has the dominant gene, he can pass it to his daughter. But if the mother doesn't have it, the son can't get it from the father because the father gives Y. So males can transmit to daughters, but not to sons. So this option says only to females. But wait, the question is about X-linked dominant. In this case, a male can pass the X to his daughter, but he can't pass it to his son. So transmission from males is only to females. But wait, the option says "only to females," but females could get it from either parent. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: Female to female transmission. Yes, because females can pass their X to their daughters. So this is possible.

Option D: No male to male or female to female transmission. That doesn't sound right. Because females can transmit to daughters. So D is wrong.

Option E: Male to male transmission. No, because males don't pass X to sons. So E is wrong.

Option F: Parental consanguinity. That refers to inbreeding or close marriage, which isn't directly related to the mode of transmission of X-linked traits. So F is probably not the answer.

Option G: Male to female transmission, but not female to male. Males can pass X to daughters, and females can pass X to sons. So G isn't correct because females can pass to males (sons), not that they can't.

Option H: Transmission only by males. No, because females can also transmit X-linked genes. So H is wrong.

Option I: Both parents must carry the gene. No, not necessarily. For example, a mother could carry it and a father might not. If the father has the X-linked dominant trait, he would pass it to his daughter, but the mother might not carry it. So I think I is incorrect.

Option J: Transmission only by females. No, because males can pass it to their daughters. So J is wrong.

Wait, going back to the options. The question is about X-linked dominant. So in this case, if a mother has the gene, she can pass it to either sons or daughters. A father can only pass it to his daughters because he gives his X to daughters and Y to sons.

So, looking for a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. Which options fit?

Let me think about the modes. For X-linked dominant, both males and females can be affected. Since it's dominant, a male only needs one copy (from his mother) to show the trait. Females can get it from either parent.

So, transmission-wise, females can pass it to both sons and daughters. Males can only pass it to daughters.

Looking back at the options, which one matches this.

Option A: Transmitted by females only to males. No, because females can pass to both sons and daughters. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Transmitted by males only to females. Males can pass to daughters, but they can't pass to sons. So yes, males can only transmit to females. But the question is about a feature of X-linked dominant. So is that a correct statement?

Wait, in X-linked dominant, if a father has the trait, he must have it because he got it from his mother (since he can't get X from father). So he can pass it to his daughter, but not to his son, because he gives Y to sons. So males can transmit to daughters.

But the question is about which is a feature. So if the question is asking which is a feature, then perhaps one of the options is correct.

Option G: Male to female transmission, but not female to male. Hmm, no, because females can transmit to males (sons). So G is incorrect.

Wait, in X-linked dominant, a father can pass the X to his daughter, but a mother can pass it to both sons and daughters. So "transmitted by males only to females" (Option B) would be correct because males can only pass it to their daughters. But wait, females can also transmit to both sons and daughters.

So the feature is that males can pass it only to daughters, and females can pass it to both sons and daughters. So what is a feature of X-linked dominant?

Looking for which option is correct.

Another angle: What's the pattern of transmission in X-linked dominant.

In X-linked dominant, females can pass it to both sons and daughters. Males can pass it only to daughters.

So looking for which option matches that.

Option A: Females only to males. No, because they can pass to both.

Option B: Males only to females. Correct, because males can pass only to daughters, not sons.

Wait, but the question is about the feature of X-linked dominant. So in X-linked dominant, a male can pass the gene to his daughter, but not to his son. So the feature is that males transmit to daughters, and females can transmit to both sons and daughters.

So the feature is that males can only transmit to females, but females can transmit to both.

So looking at the options, which one describes a feature. For example, option B says males only transmit to females, which is correct because males can't transmit to sons.

But wait, another option: option G says male to female, but not female to male. But females can pass to males, so G is wrong.

Hmm, so the correct options would be:

- Males can only pass to daughters (so Option B is correct because it says transmitted by males only to females).

Wait, but the question is which is a feature of X-linked dominant. So any of these options could be correct.

Alternatively, another way: X-linked dominant is more common in females because they have two Xs. But the question is about the transmission.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option G: Male to female transmission, but not female to male. No, because females can pass to sons via their X, so G is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option again.

The question is which is a feature of X-linked dominant. So for X-linked dominant, both males and females can be affected. Males get their X from their mother. So if the mother has the gene, she can pass it to her sons and daughters. A father can only pass his X to his daughter.

So the transmission can be from either parent. So which options are correct.

Option B: Transmitted by males only to females. So if a male has the gene, he can pass it only to his daughters. So yes, that's correct. If the father has the X-linked dominant gene, he can only pass it to his daughters.

Option A: Transmitted by females only to males. No, because females can pass to both sons and daughters.

So the correct answer would be option B, because males can only transmit to females (daughters), but females can transmit to both. So the feature is that males can only pass it to daughters.

Wait, but the question is about a feature of X-linked dominant, so any of the options that correctly describe that.

Another angle: In X-linked recessive, males cannot pass the gene to their sons because they pass Y. But in X-linked dominant, males can pass the gene to their daughters.

So which option aligns with that.

Option B says transmitted by males only to females. So that's correct.

But wait, the question is which is a feature. So the correct answer is B.

X-linked dominant inheritance involves genes located on the X chromosome that are expressed in a dominant manner. In this case, females can pass the gene to both sons and daughters, while males can only pass it to their daughters (since they give their Y chromosome to sons). This means that males can only transmit the gene to females (daughters), but females can transmit it to both males (sons) and females (daughters). 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as females can transmit the gene to both sons and daughters.
- **B**: Correct, as males can only transmit the gene to females (daughters).
- **C**: Incorrect, as female-to-female transmission is possible but not exclusive.
- **D**: Incorrect, as female-to-female transmission does occur.
- **E**: Incorrect, as male-to-male transmission is not possible.
- **F**: Incorrect, as parental consanguinity is unrelated.
- **G**: Incorrect, as females can transmit to males (sons).
- **H**: Incorrect, as females can also transmit the gene.
- **I**: Incorrect, as both parents do not necessarily need to carry the gene.
- **J**: Incorrect, as males can transmit the gene to daughters.

The correct answer is **B**, as males can only transmit the gene to females (daughters) in X-linked dominant inheritance.
