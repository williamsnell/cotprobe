Okay, so I need to find the quotient when 1,248 is divided by 7. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that dividing a number by another involves seeing how many times the divisor fits into the dividend without exceeding it. The quotient is the number of times it fits, and the remainder is what's left over.

First, I should probably start by dividing 1,248 by 7 step by step. Maybe I can do this by long division. Let me try to visualize that.

So, 7 goes into 12 once (since 7*1=7), which leaves a remainder of 5. Then, bring down the 4 to make 54. How many times does 7 go into 54? Let me calculate: 7*7 is 49, and 7*8 is 56. Oh, 56 is too big because 54 is less than that. So it goes in 7 times, making 49. Subtracting 49 from 54 leaves a remainder of 5. 

Next, bring down the 8 to make 58. Now, how many times does 7 go into 58? Let's see: 7*8 is 56, which is less than 58, and 7*9 is 63, which is too big. So it goes in 8 times, making 56. Subtracting that from 58 leaves a remainder of 2.

Wait, but 1,248 divided by 7... Let me check if that makes sense. So, 7*178 is 1,246, because 7*170 is 1,190 and 7*8 is 56, so 1,190 +56=1,246. Then 1,248 minus 1,246 is 2. So the quotient is 178 with a remainder of 2. 

Looking at the options, option A is 168 remainder 2, which seems too low. Option B is 178 remainder 2, which matches what I just calculated. Option D is 178 with a remainder of 0, but since there's a remainder of 2, that's not it. So the correct answer should be B: 178 remainder 2.
