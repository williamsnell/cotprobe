Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the position of a body at t = 11 seconds. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

The body is moving in the positive x direction and passes the origin at time t = 0. Between t = 0 and t = 1 second, it has a constant speed of 24 m/s. Then, at t = 1 second, it's given a constant acceleration of 6 m/s² in the negative x direction. I need to find where it is at t = 11 seconds.

Hmm, so the motion is divided into two parts: the first second and the remaining 10 seconds after t = 1. Let me tackle each part separately.

First, from t = 0 to t = 1, the body is moving at a constant speed. Since speed is constant, there's no acceleration during this time. So, I can calculate the distance covered in this first second easily.

Distance during constant speed is just speed multiplied by time. So, that's 24 m/s * 1 s = 24 meters. Since it's moving in the positive x direction, the position at t=1 is +24 meters.

Now, starting at t = 1 second, the body is given a constant acceleration of -6 m/s². Wait, acceleration is negative, so that means it's decelerating, right? Or maybe even reversing direction if it comes to a stop.

I think I should model the motion from t=1 to t=11 seconds. That's a duration of 10 seconds. So, I can use the kinematic equations for constant acceleration.

First, let's note the initial conditions at t=1 s:

- Initial velocity (u) at t=1 is the same as the velocity during the first second, which was 24 m/s in the positive x direction. So, u = 24 m/s.
- Acceleration (a) is -6 m/s².
- Time (t) is 10 seconds.

I need to find the displacement (s) during this 10-second period. The kinematic equation for displacement when acceleration is constant is:

s = ut + 0.5 * a * t²

Plugging in the numbers:

s = (24 m/s)(10 s) + 0.5*(-6 m/s²)*(10 s)²

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: 24 * 10 = 240 meters.

Second term: 0.5 * (-6) = -3; then multiply by (10)^2 which is 100. So, -3 * 100 = -300 meters.

So, s = 240 - 300 = -60 meters.

Wait, so the displacement from t=1 to t=11 is -60 meters. That means it moved 60 meters in the negative x direction during these 10 seconds.

Now, the total position at t=11 is the position at t=1 plus this displacement. At t=1, it was at +24 m. Adding (-60 m) gives 24 - 60 = -36 meters.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the displacement.

Wait, the equation s = ut + 0.5 a t². So,

u = 24 m/s, t=10 s, a = -6 m/s².

s = 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2

24*10 is 240.

0.5*(-6) = -3. Then, 10^2 is 100. So, -3 * 100 = -300.

240 + (-300) = -60 m. That seems correct.

So, the displacement from t=1 to t=11 is -60 m. So, position at t=11 is 24 + (-60) = -36 m.

Wait, but let me think again about the direction. The acceleration is negative, so after some time, the velocity might become zero and then negative, meaning the body starts moving backward.

Is there a possibility that the body comes to rest before t=11? Because if it stops before, the displacement after stopping would be different. Let me check that.

The velocity as a function of time is v = u + a*t.

At t=1, u = 24 m/s. So, when does v become zero?

v = 0 = 24 + (-6)*t', where t' is the time since t=1.

So, 0 = 24 -6 t' → 6 t' =24 → t' =4 seconds.

So, at t=1+4=5 seconds, the velocity is zero. After that, the body will start moving in the negative direction.

So, from t=1 to t=5, it's decelerating to a stop, and from t=5 to t=11, it's accelerating (but since a is negative, it's moving backward).

I think I should break the 10 seconds into two parts: the first 4 seconds where it's slowing down to a stop, and the next 6 seconds where it's moving backward.

Wait, but when I calculated the displacement using s = ut + 0.5 a t² for t=10, I got -60 m. Let me see if that's correct by calculating the displacement in each phase.

First phase: t=1 to t=5 (4 seconds), initial velocity 24 m/s, a=-6 m/s².

Displacement s1 = ut + 0.5 a t².

s1 = 24 *4 + 0.5*(-6)*(4)^2.

24*4=96.

0.5*(-6)= -3; 4²=16. So, -3*16=-48.

So, s1=96 -48=48 meters.

So, from t=1 to t=5, it moves 48 meters further in the positive direction. So, at t=5, position is 24 + 48 = 72 meters.

Now, from t=5 to t=11, that's 6 seconds. Now, the initial velocity at t=5 is zero, and a = -6 m/s².

So, displacement s2 = ut + 0.5 a t².

u=0, t=6, a=-6.

s2=0*6 + 0.5*(-6)*(6)^2.

= 0 + (-3)*(36) = -108 meters.

So, displacement from t=5 to t=11 is -108 meters.

Wait, so the total displacement from t=1 to t=11 is s1 + s2 = 48 + (-108) = -60 meters, which matches the earlier calculation. So, the position at t=11 is 24 + (-60) = -36 meters.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options, I see option B is -36 meters. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the entire motion from t=0 to t=11, but that might complicate things because the acceleration starts at t=1. So, splitting into two parts is correct.

Wait, another way: total time is 11 seconds. From t=0 to t=1, it's moving at 24 m/s. From t=1 to t=11, 10 seconds with acceleration -6 m/s².

So, the total position is x = x1 + x2, where x1 is from t=0 to t=1, and x2 is from t=1 to t=11.

x1 = 24 m (as calculated).

x2 = ut + 0.5 a t^2, with u=24 m/s, a=-6, t=10.

x2 = 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2 = 240 - 3*100 = 240-300= -60.

So, x_total =24 + (-60) =-36 meters.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial velocity at t=1 is 24 m/s, and the acceleration is negative, so the displacement during the 10 seconds is -60 m.

Thus, the position is -36 m, which is option B.

But wait, the options given are:

A:84m

B:-36m

C:-84m

D:-72m

E:72m

F:60m

G:-60m

H:-99m

I:99m

J:36m

So, B is -36, which matches.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I split the motion into two parts, I found that from t=1 to t=5, it moved 48 meters further, making the position at t=5 72 m, then from t=5 to t=11, it moved back 108 meters, ending at 72 -108 = -36 m. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity at t=11 and integrate the motion, but I think the earlier approach is correct.

So, the answer should be B: -36 m.
</think>

The body's motion is divided into two parts: from t=0 to t=1 (constant speed) and from t=1 to t=11 (constant acceleration). 

1. **From t=0 to t=1**:  
   The body moves at a constant speed of 24 m/s for 1 second, covering a distance of:  
   \[
   x_1 = 24 \, \text{m/s} \times 1 \, \text{s} = 24 \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   At t=1, the position is \( x = 24 \, \text{m} \).

2. **From t=1 to t=11**:  
   The body has an initial velocity \( u = 24 \, \text{m/s} \), acceleration \( a = -6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and time \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \). Using the kinematic equation for displacement:  
   \[
   s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2,
   \]  
   the displacement during these 10 seconds is:  
   \[
   s = (24)(10) + \frac{1}{2}(-6)(10)^2 = 240 - 300 = -60 \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   This means the body moves 60 meters in the negative x-direction. Adding this to the position at t=1:  
   \[
   x_{\text{total}} = 24 + (-60) = -36 \, \text{m}.
   \]

Thus, the position of the body at t=11 seconds is **-36 meters**, corresponding to option B.
