Question:

It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.

Options:

A: Neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals traveling towards the dendrites only.
B: The receptors for neurotransmitters are only found on the axonal terminals.
C: The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only.
D: The synaptic vesicle is present inside the dendrites of a neuron.
E: The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.
F: The neurotransmitter degrades immediately upon release and cannot travel to the axon.
G: The dendrites actively pump the neurotransmitter back to the axon after it has been received.
H: The neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end of a neuron only.
I: The dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect of the axonal neurotransmitter.
J: The neurotransmitter can travel in both directions.

Okay, so I have this question about why the chemical transmission at a synapse is unidirectional. I remember that synapses are the connections between neurons, and they transmit signals. The question says that the neurotransmitter always goes from the presynaptic axon to the post-synaptic dendrite. I need to figure out why that's the case.

Let me think about what I know about synapses. There's the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron. The presynaptic part is where the action potential arrives at the axon terminal, causing the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the post-synaptic cell, which is usually a dendrite or cell body.

So why can't the neurotransmitters go back the other way? Maybe because the machinery for releasing neurotransmitters is only in the presynaptic part. Oh wait, I remember that the presynaptic terminals have vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. These vesicles are released when the action potential arrives. The postsynaptic side doesn't have these vesicles, so they can't release anything back.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. Option A says neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals towards the dendrites only. Hmm, the electrical signals (action potentials) do travel towards the axon terminals, not the dendrites. So A might be incorrect because it's the axon that sends signals, not receives them.

Option B says receptors are only on axonal terminals. No, that's not right. The receptors are on the post-synaptic cell, which is usually the dendrite or cell body, not the axon terminals.

Option C says the neurotransmitter is present only in the axonal end. That could make sense because the vesicles are in the axon terminals. But wait, the question is why it's unidirectional. So even if the neurotransmitter is present elsewhere, it's the release machinery that matters.

Option D says the synaptic vesicles are in the dendrites. No, vesicles are in the axon terminals of the presynaptic neuron.

Option E says axon terminals don't have machinery to release. No, they do have the machineryâ€”the vesicles and the proteins to release them. So E is incorrect.

Option F says the neurotransmitter degrades immediately. I'm not sure about that. I think they can take some time to be degraded or reabsorbed, but that's after they've acted. Not sure if this is the main reason for unidirectionality.

Option G suggests the dendrites pump the neurotransmitter back. I don't recall any mechanism like that. The postsynaptic cell doesn't release neurotransmitters, so this is probably wrong.

Option H says the neurotransmitter is present only in the dendritic end. That doesn't make sense because the presynaptic neuron holds the neurotransmitters in its axon.

Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates. That sounds a bit like an inhibitor, but I don't think that's the reason for unidirectional transmission. It's more about the direction of signal, not the type of neurotransmitter.

Option J says the neurotransmitter can travel both ways. That's not true; synapses are one-way because of the structure and vesicle location.

So going back, the main reason is that only the presynaptic neuron has the vesicles and machinery to release neurotransmitters. Therefore, the correct answer should be that the axonal terminals do have the machinery, but the postsynaptic don't. Wait, the options don't directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option E says "The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters." No, that's wrong because axon terminals do have the machinery. So maybe I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The presynaptic neuron's axon terminals have the vesicles and the proteins (like synaptotagmin) needed for exocytosis. The postsynaptic neuron doesn't have these vesicles, so they can't release neurotransmitters. So the unidirectionality is because only the presynaptic side can release them.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this? Option C says the neurotransmitter is present only in the axonal end. But that's about presence, not release capability. So if the neurotransmitter is only present there, it can't go back. But actually, the presence is because the vesicles are there. So the correct reasoning is that the machinery for release is only in the axon terminals, so they can't be released from the dendrite.

Wait, the options don't directly state that. Let me look again. Option E says "The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters." No, that's incorrect because they do possess it. So maybe none of the options directly match, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Why can't the signal go back? Because the receptors are only on the other side. The presynaptic has the vesicles, and the postsynaptic has the receptors. So the direction is because the release is one-way.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one. Because the neurotransmitter is present only in the axon end, so it can only be released that way. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe option E is incorrect because it's the opposite. 

Wait, another thought: the release of neurotransmitters is a process that requires the presynaptic neuron's machinery. The postsynaptic neuron doesn't have vesicles to release them, so they can't send signals back. So the reason is that the axon terminals have the release machinery, and the dendrites don't.

Looking at the options, none directly state that. So perhaps the best fit is option C: the neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end only. But wait, the neurotransmitter is synthesized in the cell body and transported to the axon terminals. So the presence is only there, so it can't go back. That makes sense.

Alternatively, option E is incorrect because it says the axon terminals don't have the machinery, which is wrong.

So, I think the correct answer is C. Because the neurotransmitter is present only in the axon terminals, so it can only be released from there, making transmission unidirectional.

The chemical transmission at a synapse is unidirectional because the neurotransmitter is only present in the axonal end of the presynaptic neuron. The axon terminals contain synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, which are released when an action potential arrives. The postsynaptic neuron, typically a dendrite or cell body, lacks the machinery to release neurotransmitters, ensuring that the signal travels only in one direction.

Answer: C
