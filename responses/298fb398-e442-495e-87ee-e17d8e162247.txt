Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out how much a 6-pound bag of cat food costs. The given rate is $0.47 per pound. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you're calculating the total cost for multiple pounds at a given rate, you just multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds. So in this case, it's 0.47 dollars multiplied by 6 pounds.

Let me write that down: 0.47 * 6. I can do this multiplication step by step. Maybe breaking it down will help. So, 0.47 times 6. Let's see.

I can think of 0.47 as 47 cents. So 47 cents times 6. 47 times 6 is... let me calculate. 40 times 6 is 240, and 7 times 6 is 42. So adding them together, 240 +42 is 282. So that's 282 cents. Now, converting cents back to dollars, since 100 cents is a dollar, 282 cents is $2.82.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to calculate 0.47 *6 is to multiply 6 *0.47. 6 *0.4 is 2.4, and 6 *0.07 is 0.42. Adding those together, 2.4 +0.42 equals 2.82. Yep, same result.

Looking at the options, I see option E is $2.82. So that must be the correct answer. Let me check the other options to make sure none of them match. A is $3.82, which is higher than what I got. B is $2.97, which is close but a bit higher. C is $6.47, which is way too high. D is $12.77, that's way off. E is $2.82, which matches my calculation. F is $1.47, which is half of what I got, so that's probably for 3 pounds. G is $7.47, too high. H is $8.22, nope. I is $4.67, not matching. J is $5.02, again, higher than my calculation.

So yeah, I'm confident that E is the correct answer.

The cost is calculated by multiplying $0.47 per pound by 6 pounds, resulting in $2.82.
