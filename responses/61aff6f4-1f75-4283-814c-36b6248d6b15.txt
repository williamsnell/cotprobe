Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the weight of a textbook changing with altitude. Hmm, let's see. The textbook weighs 30 N at sea level, and the question is asking what its weight would be on a mountain peak that's 6,000 meters above sea level. The Earth's radius is given as 6,400 km. I need to pick the best estimate from the options provided.

Wait, right, weight changes with distance from the center of the Earth because the gravitational force decreases as you move away. I remember the formula for gravitational force is F = G*(M*m)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, m is the object's mass, and r is the distance from the center. So, since the textbook is moving further away, its weight should decrease.

But wait, the problem says the textbook's weight is 30 N at sea level. So at sea level, the distance r is Earth's radius, which is 6,400 km, or 6,400,000 meters. The mountain is 6,000 meters above sea level, so the new distance r' would be 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6,406,000 meters.

So the new weight would be proportional to (r_initial)² over (r_final)². Because F is inversely proportional to the square of the radius. So the weight at the mountain W' = W_initial * (r_initial / r_final)^2.

Let me compute that. r_initial is 6,400,000 m, and r_final is 6,406,000 m. The difference is 6,000 m, which is a small change compared to the Earth's radius. So the ratio would be (6400/6406) squared. Let's calculate that.

Wait, maybe I can approximate this because 6,000 is much smaller than 6,400,000. So 6,406,000 is 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6,400,000 * (1 + 6,000/6,400,000) = 6,400,000 * (1 + 0.0009375). So the factor is approximately (1 + 0.0009375), so when squared, it's approximately 1 + 2*0.0009375 ≈ 1.001875. But wait, actually, the ratio is r_initial over r_final, which is 6,400,000 / 6,406,000. Let me compute that.

So 6,400,000 / 6,406,000 = (6,400,000) / (6,400,000 + 6,000) = 6,400,000 / 6,406,000. Let me compute this as 6,400,000 / (6,400,000 * (1 + 6,000/6,400,000)) ) = 1 / (1 + (6,000)/(6,400,000)).

So 6,000 / 6,400,000 = 0.0009375. So the denominator is 1 + 0.0009375 = 1.0009375. So 1/1.0009375 ≈ 0.9990625. So the ratio is approximately 0.9990625.

Now, squaring that: (0.9990625)^2 ≈ 0.998125. Because (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x for small x. Here x is 0.0009375, so 2x is about 0.001875, so 1 - 0.001875 = 0.998125.

So the weight at the mountain is approximately 30 N * 0.998125 ≈ 29.94375 N. Wait, that's almost the same as 30 N. But looking at the options, 30 N is option G. But wait, that's almost the same as sea level, but intuitively, moving up a bit should decrease the weight, but the change might be minimal here.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check. Let's compute the exact ratio. 6,400,000 / 6,406,000 = 6400 / 6406 (divided both by 1000). So 6400 ÷ 6406. Let me compute that.

Well, 6406 is 6400 + 6, so 6400/6406 = 1 / (1 + 6/6400) ) = 1 / (1 + 3/3200) ) ≈ 1 - 3/3200 + (3/3200)^2 - ... using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

So x is 3/3200 ≈ 0.0009375. So 1/(1 + 0.0009375) ≈ 0.9990625. So the square is (0.9990625)^2 = 0.998125. So 30 N * 0.998125 ≈ 29.94375 N, which is approximately 29.94 N. So that's almost the same as 30 N, but slightly less. So looking at the options, the closest would be G:30 N. But wait, the options don't have a 29.94 N. So perhaps the intended approach is to approximate the change more coarsely.

Wait, maybe another approach. The change in radius is 6 km (6,000 m) over 6,400 km, which is a fractional change of 6,000 / 6,400,000 = 0.0009375, which is about 0.09375%. So the weight would decrease by approximately twice that percentage because weight is inversely proportional to r². So the percentage decrease would be about 2 * 0.09375% = 0.1875%. So 30 N * (1 - 0.001875) = 30 * 0.998125 ≈ 29.94375 N, as before.

Wait, but none of the options is 29.94 N. The options are A:15, B:60, C:45, D:10, E:90, F:20, G:30, H:7.5, I:35, J:25.

So the closest is G:30 N. But wait, perhaps the question expects a more approximate calculation. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (6,400,000 / 6,406,000)^2 more accurately.

Compute denominator: 6,406,000 = 6,400,000 + 6,000 = 6.406e6 meters.

So ratio = (6.4e6) / (6.406e6) = 6.4 / 6.406 ≈ 0.9990625.

Now, squaring that:

(0.9990625)^2 = let's compute it step by step.

0.9990625 * 0.9990625:

First, 1 * 1 = 1.

But 0.9990625 is 1 - 0.0009375.

So (1 - 0.0009375)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0009375 + (0.0009375)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.001875 + 0.00000087890625 ≈ 0.998125 + 0.0000008789 ≈ 0.9981258789.

So approximately 0.998126.

So 30 N * 0.998126 ≈ 29.9438 N.

So the weight is roughly 29.94 N, which is almost 30 N. So the best estimate from the options would be G:30 N.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is 30 N, and J is 25 N. So maybe the question expects a more significant change, but perhaps the change is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: The formula for weight is W = (G*M*m)/(r^2). At sea level, r = R_earth. At the mountain, r = R_earth + h, where h is 6,000 m. So the weight at the mountain is W' = W * (R_earth / (R_earth + h))^2.

So plugging in the numbers:

R_earth = 6,400,000 m.

h = 6,000 m.

So R_earth + h = 6,406,000 m.

So the ratio is (6,400,000 / 6,406,000)^2 ≈ (6400/6406)^2.

Wait, 6400 / 6406 = approximately 0.9990624.

Squaring that gives ≈ 0.998125.

So W' = 30 N * 0.998125 ≈ 29.94375 N, which is very close to 30 N.

So the change is minimal, just a tiny bit less than 30 N. So the closest option is G:30 N.

Wait, but let's see if any other option is close. 29.94 is almost 30, so G is the best choice. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, but I think this is correct.

The weight of the textbook decreases slightly as it moves further from Earth's center. Using the inverse-square law of gravity, the weight at the mountain peak is approximately 29.94 N, which is nearly 30 N. The closest option is G:30 N.
