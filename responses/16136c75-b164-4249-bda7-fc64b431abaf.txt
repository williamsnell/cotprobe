Okay, so I have this problem about a parallel-plate capacitor where the dielectric's relative permittivity varies with thickness. The given equation is ε_r = 1 / [1 - (x²)/(3d²)], and I need to compute the capacitance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is usually given by C = ε₀ε_r A / d, where A is the area, d is the separation between plates, and ε_r is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant). But wait, in this case, ε_r isn't constant—it varies with x, the distance from the center, I assume. So this is a non-uniform dielectric, which complicates things.

I think I need to use integration here because ε_r changes with position. So the standard formula might not apply directly. Let me recall how to handle variable dielectrics. Oh right, when the permittivity varies with position, the capacitance requires integrating over the plates.

I remember that for a capacitor with a non-uniform dielectric, the capacitance per unit area dC is given by the integral of dC = (ε₀ ε_r(x) dx) / d. Wait, but I might be mixing up the variables. Let me think again. The formula for capacitance when the dielectric varies is often found by considering each infinitesimal slice of thickness dx, each with a local ε_r, and then integrating their contributions.

So the setup would involve slicing the capacitor into thin parallel plates, each of thickness dx, separated by a distance x (assuming x is measured from the center or one end?), and each having a permittivity ε_r(x). Since the plates are parallel, and each slice is treated as a small capacitor in series, but wait, no, each slice might actually be in parallel if the arrangement is such that each contributes additively. Wait, no, I think in this case, because the plates are uniform, each slice is a small capacitor in series? Or maybe in parallel? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, in the case of variable dielectric between plates, each infinitesimal layer is effectively a small capacitor in series with the others. Because the electric field has to go through each layer, so their capacitances would add in a series manner. So the total capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of each infinitesimal capacitance. But wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, each layer contributes a differential capacitance, and we integrate across the separation.

Let me get this straight. The total capacitance when multiple capacitors are in series is 1/C_total = sum (1/C_i). So for a continuous variation, we can model it as an infinite number of infinitesimal capacitors in series. Each infinitesimal capacitor has a thickness dx, and the distance between plates is d, but x varies from 0 to d/2 if x starts at the center, or maybe from 0 to d if it starts at one plate. Wait, the problem says the plates are separated by a dielectric whose permittivity varies with thickness. So x is varying from 0 to d.

Wait, the given ε_r is a function of x, so I think x ranges from 0 to d. Because in the equation, x^2/(3d^2), so x goes from 0 to d. So the dielectric varies from x=0 to x=d. So the plates are separated by a distance d, and the dielectric between them varies with x.

Wait, but the plates are flat, so the separation is uniform, but the dielectric's ε_r varies with x, which I think is the distance from one plate. Hmm, but sometimes x is measured from the center. Let me check the equation again. The equation is ε_r = 1 / [1 - (x²)/(3d²)]. So when x approaches d, the denominator approaches 1 - (d²)/(3d²) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. So ε_r approaches 1/(2/3) = 3/2. At x=0, ε_r is 1/(1-0) = 1. So the relative permittivity starts at 1 at x=0 and increases to 3/2 at x=d.

Wait, but if x is measured from the center, then x would go from -d/2 to +d/2, making the maximum x be d/2. Let me plug that in. Then (x²)/(3d²) would be ( (d/2)^2 ) / (3d²) ) = (d²/4) / (3d²) ) = 1/(12), so denominator becomes 1 - 1/12 = 11/12, so ε_r is 12/11 ≈ 1.09. That's a small increase, but not as much as when x=d. Hmm, but the problem says the plates are separated by the dielectric, so x is probably measured from one plate to the other, so x ranges from 0 to d.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased makes me think that x is varying across the separation between the plates, which is d. So x is from 0 to d, and the dielectric varies as a function of x along the separation. So each slice dx at position x has a permittivity ε_r(x) = 1 / [1 - (x²)/(3d²)].

So to compute the capacitance, I think I need to model each infinitesimal slice as a small capacitor in series. Because the electric field is continuous, and each slice's E field adds up. So the total capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of each infinitesimal capacitance.

Wait, no, actually, when capacitors are in series, the reciprocal of the total is the sum of the reciprocals. But in this case, we're dealing with an infinite number of infinitesimal capacitors in series. Each slice has a thickness dx, and the local ε_r is ε_r(x). So each slice's capacitance would be dC = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A dx) / d, because the formula is C = ε A / d. Wait, no, wait: for a thin plate of thickness dx, the separation is dx, so the capacitance for each slice would be C_slice = ε₀ ε_r(x) A / dx. Wait, that can't be right because as dx approaches zero, C_slice becomes large, which might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each slice as a capacitor with separation dx, and area A. So the capacitance of each slice would be C_slice = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) / dx. But then integrating these in series would give the total capacitance.

Wait, but integrating in series would involve 1/C_total = ∫ (1/C_slice) dx over the separation. But that seems a bit tricky because each C_slice depends on dx. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using the differential form of the capacitance.

Another approach I remember is that for a variable dielectric, the capacitance can be found by integrating the differential capacitance across the plates. The differential capacitance is dC = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) dx / d, where d is the total separation. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the differential capacitance is dC = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) (dx), but then the total capacitance would be the sum (integral) of dC.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the capacitor as made up of many infinitesimally thin capacitors in series, each with their own ε_r(x). So the total capacitance would be:

C_total = 1 / [ ∫ (1 / C_slice) dx ]

But each C_slice is the capacitance of a thin slice with thickness dx, area A, and permittivity ε_r(x). So C_slice = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) / dx. Wait, because the formula for capacitance is C = (ε A) / d, where d is the separation. So for each slice, d is dx, so C_slice = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) / dx.

But then 1/C_slice = dx / (ε₀ ε_r(x) A). So the integral becomes ∫ (dx / (ε₀ ε_r(x) A )) from x=0 to x=d. Therefore,

1/C_total = (1/(ε₀ A)) ∫ (dx / ε_r(x)) from 0 to d.

So,

C_total = (ε₀ A) / [ ∫ (1/ε_r(x)) dx from 0 to d ].

Hmm, that makes sense because each slice contributes an inverse term. So the integral is over the reciprocal of ε_r(x) across the separation d.

Now, given that, let's compute the integral ∫ (1/ε_r(x)) dx from 0 to d.

Given ε_r(x) = 1 / [1 - (x²)/(3d²)].

So 1/ε_r(x) = 1 - (x²)/(3d²).

So the integral becomes ∫ [1 - (x²)/(3d²)] dx from 0 to d.

Let's compute that:

∫ [1 - (x²)/(3d²)] dx = ∫ 1 dx - (1/(3d²)) ∫ x² dx.

The first integral from 0 to d is [x] from 0 to d = d.

The second integral is (1/(3d²)) * [x^3/3] from 0 to d = (1/(3d²)) * (d^3/3 - 0) )= (d^3)/(9d²) )= d/9.

So the integral becomes d - (d/9) = (9d - d)/9 = (8d)/9.

So the integral ∫ (1/ε_r(x)) dx from 0 to d is (8d)/9.

So putting it back into the capacitance formula:

C_total = (ε₀ A) / [ (8d/9) ) ] = (ε₀ A) * (9/(8d)) ) = (9 ε₀ A)/(8d).

But wait, the options have ε_va, which I think is ε₀ multiplied by the vacuum permittivity? Or perhaps ε_va is a typo, and it's supposed to be ε₀. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses ε_va as the vacuum permittivity, but that's unusual. Wait, usually ε_r is relative to ε₀, so perhaps in the problem, ε_va is ε₀.

Assuming that, then:

C_total = (9 ε_va A) / (8 d).

But wait, the options have terms like (ε_va / d) multiplied by some coefficient. So the expression I have is (9/8) (ε_va A)/d. But the options have expressions like (8/9) ε_va d, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, let me double-check my integral:

∫ [1 - (x²)/(3d²)] dx from 0 to d.

Compute term by term:

Integral of 1 dx from 0 to d is d.

Integral of (x²)/(3d²) dx is [x^3/(9d²)] from 0 to d, which is (d^3)/(9d²) )= d/9.

So the overall integral is d - d/9 = (9d - d)/9 = 8d/9. That's correct.

So the denominator is 8d/9. Thus,

C_total = (ε₀ A) / (8d/9) ) = (9 ε₀ A) / (8d).

But looking at the options, they don't have A in them, which is the area. So perhaps the problem is considering unit area, meaning A=1. But in the options, the expressions are in terms of ε_va multiplied by d or divided by d, etc.

Wait, perhaps the problem is presented in terms of per unit area, so the answer would be (9/8) (ε_va / d) per unit area. But looking at the options, option G is (9/8) (ε_va * d). That doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the separation is d, and the variable x is along the direction, but perhaps the actual integration variable is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the integral should be ∫ (1/ε_r(x)) dx, but I might have the reciprocal wrong.

Wait, ε_r(x) = 1/[1 - x²/(3d²)], so 1/ε_r(x) = 1 - x²/(3d²). So the integral is correct.

Wait, but let me think again about the setup. Another approach: the capacitance can be found using the formula C = 2πε ∫ (1/ (sqrt(μ ε)) ) ) dr, but that's for cylindrical coordinates, which doesn't apply here. So perhaps I should stick to the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct expression for the integral is ∫ (ε_r(x)) dx, but no, earlier reasoning suggests that 1/C_total involves the integral of 1/ε_r(x) dx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it using energy methods or considering Gauss's law, but I think the initial approach is correct.

Given that, the capacitance is (9 ε_va A )/(8 d). But the options don't have A in them, so perhaps the problem is considering unit area, so A=1. Then, the capacitance would be (9/8) (ε_va / d). Looking at the options, option I is (9/8) (ε_va / d). But wait, option I is listed as (9/8) {ε_va / d}.

Wait, but looking back, option I is: I: (9/8) {(\epsilon_va) / d} Farad.

Wait, but in my calculation, I have (9/8) (ε_va A)/(d). If A=1, then it's (9/8) (ε_va / d). So option I would be that. But looking at the options given, option I is (9/8) ε_va / d.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (7/5) (ε_va / 2d) F

B: (9/8) (ε_va + d) F

C: (8/9) (ε_va·d) F

D: (1/2) (ε_va·d) F

E: (3/2) (ε_va / d) F

F: (8/9) (ε_va / d) F

G: (9/8) (ε_va·d) F

H: (5/7) (ε_va / d²) F

I: (9/8) (ε_va / d) F

J: (2/3) (ε_va / d) F

So, option I is (9/8)(ε_va/d). So that's what I have.

Wait, but in my calculation, I have (9 ε_va A)/(8d). So if the problem assumes A=1, then option I matches. But given that the options don't include A, perhaps the problem is considering per unit area, or perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again: when you have a variable dielectric, the capacitance is found by integrating the differential capacitance across the plates. The differential capacitance is dC = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) dx / d, but that doesn't seem right because the formula is C = (ε A)/d, so for each slice of thickness dx, the capacitance would be dC = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) dx / d.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the formula for a capacitor is C = (ε A) / separation. So for each slice with separation dx, the capacitance would be dC = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) / dx. But that would make each slice's capacitance very large as dx approaches zero, which isn't physical. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model each slice as a capacitor in series, so the total capacitance is the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals. So,

1/C_total = ∫ (1/dC_slice) dx.

Each dC_slice is (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) dx / d. Wait, no, that's not correct because the separation for each slice is dx, so C_slice = (ε₀ ε_r(x) A) / dx. So 1/C_slice = dx / (ε₀ ε_r(x) A).

Thus,

1/C_total = ∫ (dx / (ε₀ ε_r(x) A )) from x=0 to x=d.

Which gives,

C_total = (ε₀ A) / [ ∫ (1/ε_r(x)) dx from 0 to d ].

As I did earlier. So that part seems correct.

So the integral is 8d/9, so,

C_total = (ε₀ A) * (9/(8d)).

If the problem is considering unit area, A=1, then C_total = (9/8) (ε₀ / d) = (9/8) (ε_va / d), since ε_va is ε₀.

So the correct option would be option I: (9/8) (ε_va / d) F.

But looking at the options, option I is (9/8) {(\epsilon_va) / d} Farad.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the integral was 8d/9, leading to 9/(8d) as the factor. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I is (9/8) (ε_va / d), which matches our result.

Alternatively, another possibility is that I had the integral wrong, perhaps the integral should be ∫ ε_r(x) dx, but that would give a different result. Let me test that quickly.

If I had ∫ ε_r(x) dx from 0 to d.

ε_r(x) = 1 / [1 - x²/(3d²)].

So the integral would be ∫ [1 / (1 - x²/(3d²))] dx from 0 to d.

That would require a different approach, perhaps substitution.

Let me set u = x/d, so x = u d, dx = d du.

The integral becomes ∫ [1 / (1 - (u² d²)/(3d²))] * d du from u=0 to u=1.

Simplify denominator: 1 - u²/(3) → 1 - u²/3.

So integral becomes ∫ [1 / (1 - u²/3)] * d du from 0 to 1.

Which is d ∫ [1 / (1 - u²/3)] du from 0 to 1.

The integral of 1/(1 - u²/3) du is (sqrt(3)/2) ln |(sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)u)/(sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)u)| ) evaluated from 0 to 1.

At u=1, it's (sqrt(3)/2) ln [ (sqrt(3)+sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3)-sqrt(3)) ) ] → but denominator becomes zero, which is problematic. So this suggests that the integral diverges, which can't be correct. Therefore, this approach must be wrong, so perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the integral is indeed ∫ (1/ε_r(x)) dx.

So going back, I think the correct answer is option I: (9/8)(ε_va/d) F.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor with a dielectric whose relative permittivity varies as \( \epsilon_r = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}} \), where \( x \) is the distance from one plate and \( d \) is the separation between the plates. 

To solve this, the capacitance is computed by integrating the reciprocal of the permittivity across the separation. The total capacitance is given by:

\[
C_{\text{total}} = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{\int_0^d \frac{1}{\epsilon_r(x)} \, dx}
\]

Substituting \( \epsilon_r(x) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}} \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^d \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}\right) dx
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_0^d 1 \, dx - \frac{1}{3d^2} \int_0^d x^2 \, dx = d - \frac{d}{9} = \frac{8d}{9}
\]

Thus, the capacitance is:

\[
C_{\text{total}} = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{\frac{8d}{9}} = \frac{9 \epsilon_0 A}{8d}
\]

Assuming unit area (\( A = 1 \)), the capacitance simplifies to:

\[
C_{\text{total}} = \frac{9}{8} \frac{\epsilon_0}{d}
\]

Given that \( \epsilon_{va} \) likely represents \( \epsilon_0 \), the capacitance matches option I: \( \frac{9}{8} \frac{\epsilon_{va}}{d} \) Farad.
