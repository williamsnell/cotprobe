Okay, so I've got this problem here about a Poisson process. Hmm, I remember Poisson processes from my probability class. Let me try to recall what I learned. The question is asking for the covariance function of a Poisson process and then evaluating it at specific points.

Alright, the process is N(t) with rate λ = 4. I think the covariance function for a Poisson process is something I need to remember. Wait, Poisson processes have independent increments, right? So, the covariance between N(t1) and N(t2) depends on whether t1 and t2 are the same or not.

Let me think. The covariance C_N(t1, t2) is E[N(t1)N(t2)] - E[N(t1)]E[N(t2)]. Since it's a Poisson process, the expected value E[N(t)] is λt. So, E[N(t1)] is 4t1 and E[N(t2)] is 4t2.

Now, what about E[N(t1)N(t2)]? I remember that for a Poisson process, if t1 ≤ t2, then N(t1) and N(t2) - N(t1) are independent. Oh wait, that might help. So if t1 ≤ t2, then N(t2) = N(t1) + (N(t2) - N(t1)). Since N(t1) and N(t2)-N(t1) are independent, the expectation E[N(t1)N(t2)] would be E[N(t1)(N(t1) + (N(t2)-N(t1)))]. Let me expand that.

E[N(t1)^2] + E[N(t1)(N(t2)-N(t1))]. The first term is E[N(t1)^2], which for a Poisson distribution is λt1 + (λt1)^2. Because for Poisson, Var(N(t)) = λt, and Var = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2, so E[X^2] = Var + (E[X])^2 = λt + (λt)^2.

The second term is E[N(t1)] * E[N(t2)-N(t1)] because of independence. E[N(t2)-N(t1)] is λ(t2 - t1). So putting it all together:

E[N(t1)N(t2)] = [λt1 + (λt1)^2] + [4t1 * 4(t2 - t1)].

Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check. Since t1 ≤ t2, N(t1) and N(t2)-N(t1) are independent. So E[N(t1) * N(t2)] = E[N(t1) * (N(t1) + (N(t2)-N(t1)))] = E[N(t1)^2] + E[N(t1)(N(t2)-N(t1))].

Which is E[N(t1)^2] + E[N(t1)] * E[N(t2)-N(t1)].

So, E[N(t1)^2] is Var(N(t1)) + [E(N(t1))]^2 = λt1 + (λt1)^2.

And E[N(t2)-N(t1)] is λ(t2 - t1).

So, putting it together, the expectation becomes λt1 + (λt1)^2 + λt1 * λ(t2 - t1).

Wait, let me compute that:

= λt1 + (λt1)^2 + (λ)^2 t1 (t2 - t1)
= λt1 + λ² t1² + λ² t1(t2 - t1)
= λt1 + λ² t1² + λ² t1 t2 - λ² t1²
= λt1 + λ² t1 t2.

So E[N(t1)N(t2)] = λt1 + λ² t1 t2.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Alternatively, I might have a formula for the covariance function. I remember that for a Poisson process, the covariance between N(t1) and N(t2) is λ * min(t1, t2). Because, since the increments are independent, the covariance is λ times the smaller of the two times. So, Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ min(t1, t2).

Wait, that makes sense because if t1 and t2 are both the same, the covariance is λ t, which aligns with the variance being λ t. Because when t1 = t2, the covariance is the variance, which is λ t, so yes, that would be λ min(t1, t2) when t1 = t2.

So in this case, Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = 4 * min(t1, t2).

Wait, so the covariance function C_N(t1, t2) = 4 min(t1, t2).

So, the question is asking for C_N(2,4). So, min(2,4) is 2. So, 4 * 2 = 8.

Looking at the options, E is 8. So the answer should be E.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So the covariance is λ min(t1, t2). For t1=2, t2=4, min is 2. So 4*2=8. That's option E.

I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = E[N(t1)N(t2)] - E[N(t1)]E[N(t2)].

E[N(t1)] is 4*2=8, E[N(t2)] is 4*4=16.

E[N(t1)N(t2)] is, as I computed earlier, 4*2 + (4)^2 * 2*4? Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought it was λ t1 + λ² t1 t2. Let's plug in t1=2, t2=4, λ=4.

So E[N(t1)N(t2)] = 4*2 + (4)^2 * 2*4 = 8 + 16 * 8 = 8 + 128 = 136.

Wait, that can't be right because E[N(t1)]E[N(t2)] is 8*16=128. Then Cov would be 136 - 128 = 8. That's correct.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought E[N(t1)N(t2)] = λ t1 + λ² t1 t2. So for t1=2, t2=4:

E[N(2)N(4)] = 4*2 + (4)^2 *2*4 = 8 + 16*8 = 8 + 128 = 136. Then Cov = 136 - (8)(16) = 136 - 128 = 8.

Yes, that aligns with the other approach where Cov = λ min(t1, t2) = 4*2=8.

So both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is E:8.
</think>

The covariance function for a Poisson process with rate λ is given by \( C_N(t_1, t_2) = \lambda \cdot \min(t_1, t_2) \). For \( t_1 = 2 \) and \( t_2 = 4 \), the minimum is 2. Thus, \( C_N(2, 4) = 4 \cdot 2 = 8 \).
