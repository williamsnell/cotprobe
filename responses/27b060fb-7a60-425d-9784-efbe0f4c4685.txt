Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a furniture manufacturer and how many end tables he produced in a week. Hmm. The information given is a bit tricky, but I'll break it down.

The question says: 8 employees produced 16 end tables each, 21 produced 23 each, 7 produced 27 each, and 4 produced 29 each. We need to find the total number produced during that week. The options are from A to J, but I'm supposed to pick the correct one.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the setup. Oh, wait a second. Each group of employees produces a certain number each. So, the 8 employees each made 16 end tables. Does that mean 8 times 16? Or is it that each of the 8 employees made 16 end tables? Oh, right, it's the same. So each of the 8 employees made 16 tables. So total for them would be 8 * 16.

Similarly, 21 employees each made 23 tables. So that's 21 * 23.

Same for the others. So the total tables would be the sum of each group's production.

So I need to calculate each part and add them up.

Let me do each step:

First group: 8 employees, each made 16 tables. So 8 * 16. Let me compute that. 8*10=80, 8*6=48, so 80+48=128. So 128 tables from the first group.

Second group: 21 employees, each made 23. So 21 * 23. Hmm, 20*23 is 460, plus 1*23 is 23. So 460 +23=483. So 483 tables from the second group.

Third group: 7 employees, each made 27. So 7*27. Let's see, 7*20=140, 7*7=49. So 140+49=189. So 189 tables from the third group.

Fourth group: 4 employees, each made 29. So 4*29. 4*20=80, 4*9=36. So 80+36=116. So 116 tables from the last group.

Now I need to add all these up. Let's do that step by step.

First sum: 128 + 483. Let me add 128 + 400 = 528, then add 83: 528 +83=611.

Wait, no, wait. 128 +483. Let's do it directly. 128 + 483: 128 plus 400 is 528, plus 83 is 611. So total after first two groups is 611.

Next, add 189. 611 + 189. Let's break it down. 600 +189 is 789, plus 11 is 799 + 11=800? Wait, no. Let me do it again. 611 +189. Adding 600 + 100=700, 11 +89=100; so 700+100=800. So 611+189=800.

Now, add the last group, which is 116. So 800 +116. 800 +100=900, plus 16 is 916. So total tables would be 916.

Looking at the options, option A is 916 end tables. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: 916 end tables.
