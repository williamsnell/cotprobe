Question:

A grocery store is sued by a customer for damages for injuries allegedly suffered to the face and forearms, which resulted from his collision with the store's automatic doors. The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, due to the possibility of bias.
B: admissible, as a first-hand witness account of the event.
C: inadmissible, as it lacks direct connection to the case.
D: admissible, as evidence of the store's negligence.
E: inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.
F: inadmissible, as it is hearsay evidence.
G: admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.
H: inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.
I: admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically about whether a sister's testimony is admissible in a lawsuit. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a customer was injured by the automatic doors of a grocery store. He's suing for damages. The customer says the doors were programmed to swing outward, which surprised him and led to his injury. At trial, he testified about his injuries and what happened. The store denies any safety issues and that the doors caused his injuries.

The customer's sister testified that she was with him on the day of the accident and saw the doors swing outward, hitting him. She also said that when she returned the next week, the doors had been reprogrammed to swing inward. The question is whether the sister's testimony is admissible.

I need to figure out if the sister's testimony is allowed in court. Let's look at the options.

First, the sister is a witness. She's testifying about what she saw and what happened when she came back. Now, the sister is the customer's sister, so there's a possibility of bias. She's related to the plaintiff, so she might be inclined to support him, which could affect her credibility. But bias doesn't always make testimony inadmissible; it just affects its weight, not its admissibility. So options A and F might be about bias or hearsay.

Wait, let's think about hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The sister is testifying about what she saw and what she observed the next week. Her testimony is based on her personal knowledge, so it's not hearsay. She's recounting her own observations, not repeating what someone else said. So F (inadmissible as hearsay) is probably wrong.

Option B says it's admissible as a first-hand account. That makes sense because she was there and saw the event. So B could be a contender.

Option D says admissible as evidence of negligence. Well, her testimony about the doors swinging outward could show that the store was negligent because the doors were unsafe. But the immediate issue is whether her testimony is admissible, not whether it's relevant to proving negligence. So D might be correct in terms of relevance, but the question is about admissibility first.

Option G is about tacit admissions. Tacit admissions occur when a party's statement or conduct is adopted by another, making it binding. Here, the sister's testimony about the doors being reprogrammed might suggest that the store changed the settings because they realized it was a problem. But I'm not sure if that's a tacit admission. It might be more about the store's subsequent remedial measures, which are generally inadmissible to prove negligence. Wait, but that's a different issue. The sister is not testifying about the store's actions, but about her observations. So G might not be the right choice.

Option H says irrelevant. The sister's testimony relates to how the doors were operating and a change made afterward, which could be relevant to show that the doors were indeed a hazard. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I is about lay opinion. She's not offering an expert opinion; she's just describing what she saw. So I doesn't apply.

Now, focusing on the admissibility. The sister's testimony is based on her own observations, so it's not hearsay. She's a witness with personal knowledge. So B and D are possible. But the question is about whether it's admissible. So B says it's admissible as a first-hand account, which seems correct.

But wait, the sister is the plaintiff's sister, so there's a possible bias. Could that affect admissibility? No, because bias affects credibility, not admissibility. The sister's testimony is still relevant and based on personal knowledge, so it's admissible. So the judge shouldn't rule it out just because she's related.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: admissible as a first-hand witness account of the event.

The sister's testimony is based on her personal observations and is admissible as a first-hand account of the event, despite potential bias, which affects credibility rather than admissibility.

Answer: B
