Question:

The relative rates of diffusion of NH_3(g) and HX (g) can be determined experimentally by simultaneously in-jecting NH_3(g) and HX (g), respectively, into the oppo-site ends of a glass tube and noting where a deposit of NH_4X(s) is formed. Given an 1m tube, how far from the NH_3 injection end would you expect the NH_4X(s) to be formed when HX is a) HF, b) HCl?

Options:

A: 65.00 cm for HF, 75.00 cm for HCl
B: 50.00 cm for HF, 55.00 cm for HCl
C: 40.00 cm for HF, 45.00 cm for HCl
D: 60.00 cm for HF, 70.00 cm for HCl
E: 75.00 cm for HF, 80.00 cm for HCl
F: 45.50 cm for HF, 50.23 cm for HCl
G: 47.50 cm for HF, 52.50 cm for HCl
H: 52.03 cm for HF, 59.56 cm for HCl
I: 55.00 cm for HF, 65.00 cm for HCl
J: 30.00 cm for HF, 35.00 cm for HCl

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the diffusion of gases and where a precipitate forms. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about NH3 gas and HX gas being injected into opposite ends of a glass tube. The reaction forms NH4X(s), and we're supposed to find where this precipitate forms along the tube for HX being HF and HCl, respectively.

I remember that when two gases diffuse towards each other, their rates are related to their molar masses. The concept here is Graham's law of diffusion, which states that the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. But wait, how does this relate to where the precipitate forms?

Oh right, the precipitate forms where the concentrations of NH3 and HX are equal. So the distance from each end where the concentrations are equal will determine where the precipitate appears. This is based on the principle that the ratio of the distances covered by each gas is inversely proportional to the square roots of their molar masses.

Let me think about the formula. The ratio of the distances (d1/d2) is equal to the square root of (M2/M1), where M1 and M2 are the molar masses of the two gases. Wait, no, actually, it's the square root of (M2/M1) because rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). Since d is proportional to rate, the ratio would be sqrt(M2/M1).

Wait, the problem says NH3 and HX. So for each case, HX is either HF or HCl. Let's get their molar masses.

NH3 has a molar mass of 17 g/mol (14 for N and 3*1 for H). 

HF: H is ~1, F is ~19, so 20 g/mol. HCl: H is 1, Cl is ~35.5, so about 36.5 g/mol.

So for part a), HX is HF. So the two molar masses are NH3 (17) and HF (20). 

The ratio of distances, d_NH3 / d_HF = sqrt(M_HF / M_NH3) = sqrt(20/17). Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 17 is approximately 1.176. The square root of that is about 1.084. So d_NH3 = 1.084 * d_HF.

But the total length of the tube is 1 meter, which is 100 cm. So the sum of d_NH3 and d_HF is 100 cm. Let me set variables. Let d_NH3 = x, so d_HF = 100 - x. According to the ratio, x / (100 - x) = sqrt(20/17) ≈ 1.084.

So, x = 1.084*(100 - x). Let's expand that: x = 108.4 - 1.084x. Bring the 1.084x to the left: x + 1.084x = 108.4. So 2.084x = 108.4. Divide both sides by 2.084: x ≈ 108.4 / 2.084 ≈ let's see, 108.4 divided by 2 is 54.2, but since it's 2.084, maybe around 52 cm? Let me compute more accurately. 2.084 * 52 is 108.368, which is close to 108.4. So x ≈ 52 cm. So for part a), HF, the precipitate forms about 52 cm from the NH3 end.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H for part a) is 52.03 cm. Hmm, that's really close. So that would be 52.03 cm for HF.

Now part b), HX is HCl. So HCl's molar mass is about 36.5 g/mol. So the ratio d_NH3 / d_HCl = sqrt(36.5/17). Let me compute that. 36.5/17 ≈ 2.147. The square root of that is approximately 1.465.

Again, total distance is 100 cm. So d_NH3 = x, d_HCl = 100 - x. The ratio is x/(100 - x) = 1.465. So x = 1.465*(100 - x). Expanding: x = 146.5 -1.465x. Bring terms together: x +1.465x =146.5 → 2.465x =146.5 → x =146.5 / 2.465 ≈ let me compute that. 2.465 times 59 is about 145.8, close to 146.5. So x ≈59.4 cm. Looking at the options, option H has 59.56 cm for HCl. That's really close.

So putting it together, for HF the distance is approximately 52.03 cm, and for HCl it's approximately 59.56 cm. So the answer should correspond to option H.

The problem involves determining where the precipitate NH4X(s) forms in a 1-meter glass tube when NH3(g) and HX(g) are injected from opposite ends. Using Graham's law of diffusion, the distances from the NH3 end are calculated based on the molar masses of NH3 (17 g/mol) and HX (HF: 20 g/mol, HCl: 36.5 g/mol). The ratio of distances is inversely proportional to the square roots of their molar masses. For HF, the distance is approximately 52.03 cm, and for HCl, it is approximately 59.56 cm, matching option H.

Answer: H
