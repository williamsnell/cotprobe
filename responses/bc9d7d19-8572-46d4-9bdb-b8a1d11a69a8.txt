Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 50 eV. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength relates the momentum of a particle to its wavelength. The formula is lambda = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. Right, and momentum is mass times velocity, but since I don't have the velocity, maybe I can express it in terms of kinetic energy.

The kinetic energy (KE) of the electron is given as 50 eV. Wait, electrons have charge, so I need to convert that energy into joules to work with SI units. I recall that 1 eV is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So, 50 eV would be 50 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-18 J. 

Now, the kinetic energy of a non-relativistic particle is given by KE = (1/2)mv². But since electrons are pretty light, maybe relativistic effects are negligible here. So I can proceed with the non-relativistic formula. Rearranging that, momentum p = mv = sqrt(2mKE). So p = sqrt(2 * m * KE).

Wait, I need the mass of the electron. I think it's about 9.11 x 10^-31 kg. So plugging that in, p = sqrt(2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 8.01e-18 J). Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30. Then multiply by 8.01e-18, which gives 1.46e-47. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(1.46e-47) ≈ 1.208e-23.5 kg·m/s. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the exponents. Oh wait, 1.46e-47 is 1.46 × 10^-47, so the square root would be sqrt(1.46) × 10^(-47/2) = approx 1.208 × 10^-23.5, which is about 1.208e-23.5 kg·m/s. Wait, 10^-23.5 is the same as 10^-24 * sqrt(10), which is about 3.16e-24. So p ≈ 1.208 * 3.16e-24 ≈ 3.82e-24 kg·m/s? Hmm, maybe I'm messing up the exponents. Let me try that again.

Wait, 1.46e-47 under square root: sqrt(1.46)=1.208, sqrt(1e-47)=1e-23.5. So p is approximately 1.208e-23.5. Let me compute that as a number. 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24, so 1.208 * 3.16e-24 ≈ 3.81e-24 kg·m/s. Okay, so p ≈ 3.81e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So the wavelength lambda is h/p = 6.626e-34 / 3.81e-24. Let's compute that division: 6.626 / 3.81 ≈ 1.739, and 1e-34 / 1e-24 = 1e-10. So lambda ≈ 1.739e-10 meters, which is 1.739e-10 m. To convert that to nanometers, since 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 1.739e-10 m is 0.1739 nm. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 0.17 nm, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check if I did the momentum correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic approach, but I think for 50 eV, which is not extremely high, the non-relativistic approach should be okay. Let me recompute the momentum.

Calculating p again: KE = 50 eV = 50 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-18 J. So p = sqrt(2 * m * KE) = sqrt(2 * 9.11e-31 * 8.01e-18).

Compute 2 *9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30. Multiply by 8.01e-18: 1.822e-30 *8.01e-18 = 1.46e-47. Square root of 1.46e-47 is sqrt(1.46) * sqrt(1e-47) = 1.208 * 1e-23.5. 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24, so 1.208*3.16e-24 ≈3.81e-24 kg·m/s. So p is 3.81e-24.

h is 6.626e-34. So lambda = 6.626e-34 /3.81e-24 = (6.626 /3.81) *1e-10. 6.626 /3.81 is approximately 1.739, so 1.739e-10 m is 0.1739 nm. So the closest option is G:0.17 nm.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the de Broglie wavelength for electrons is in the angstrom range. Wait, 0.17 nm is 1.7 angstroms, which makes sense for electron microscopy. But wait, let me check the calculation again because maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Another approach: Let me compute the momentum using another formula. Since KE = (p²)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2m KE). Let me plug in the numbers.

m = 9.11e-31 kg, KE=8.01e-18 J.

p = sqrt(2 * 9.11e-31 * 8.01e-18) = sqrt( (2*9.11*8.01) * 1e-49 ) because 1e-31 *1e-18=1e-49.

2*9.11=18.22; 18.22*8.01≈146. So p= sqrt(146e-49) )= sqrt(146) * 1e-24.5. sqrt(146)≈12.08, so 12.08e-24.5. 1e-24.5 is 3.16e-25. So 12.08 *3.16e-25 ≈ 3.81e-24 kg·m/s. Same as before. So p is correct.

So lambda = 6.626e-34 /3.81e-24 = 1.738e-10 m = 0.1738 nm. So the answer is approximately 0.17 nm, which is option G.

Wait, but I remember sometimes when I calculate the de Broglie wavelength using a different approach, like using eV directly. Let me try another formula I found once: lambda (in nm) ≈ 12.3 / sqrt(KE in eV). Let me plug in 50 eV: 12.3 / sqrt(50) ≈12.3 /7.071 ≈1.738 nm. Wait, that gives 1.738 nm, which is way larger than what I calculated earlier. Wait, that can't be right because electrons with higher KE have shorter wavelengths. So if KE is 50 eV, the wavelength should be shorter than 12 nm, which is what I got with this formula. Wait, but earlier I calculated 0.1739 nm, which is about 0.17 nm, but this formula gives 1.738 nm. There's a discrepancy here. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I misremembered the formula. Let me think. The formula I'm recalling is lambda (in angstroms) ≈ 12.3 / sqrt(KE in eV). Because 1 angstrom is 0.1 nm. So if I calculate 12.3 / sqrt(50) ≈1.738 angstroms, which is 0.1738 nm. That matches my earlier calculation. Oh! So I was correct the first time, and the formula gives the same answer. So the correct wavelength is approximately 0.1738 nm, which is option G: 0.17.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 50 eV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( p \) is the momentum of the electron. The momentum can be expressed in terms of the kinetic energy (\( KE \)) using the non-relativistic formula:

\[
p = \sqrt{2m \cdot KE}
\]

### Step 1: Convert Kinetic Energy to Joules
The kinetic energy is given as \( 50 \, \text{eV} \). Converting to joules:

\[
1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}, \quad \text{so} \quad 50 \, \text{eV} = 50 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 8.01 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Momentum
The mass of the electron is \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting into the momentum formula:

\[
p = \sqrt{2 \cdot m \cdot KE} = \sqrt{2 \cdot (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) \cdot (8.01 \times 10^{-18})}.
\]

First, calculate the product inside the square root:

\[
2 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}, \quad 1.822 \times 10^{-30} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-18} = 1.46 \times 10^{-47}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{1.46 \times 10^{-47}} = 1.208 \times 10^{-23.5} \, \text{kg·m/s} \approx 3.81 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Wavelength
Using \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{3.81 \times 10^{-24}} = 1.739 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}.
\]

Convert to nanometers (\( 1 \, \text{nm} = 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
\lambda = 1.739 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 0.1739 \, \text{nm}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify with Alternative Formula
Using the alternative formula for de Broglie wavelength in nanometers:

\[
\lambda (\text{nm}) \approx \frac{12.3}{\sqrt{KE (\text{eV})}},
\]

substitute \( KE = 50 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{12.3}{\sqrt{50}} \approx \frac{12.3}{7.071} \approx 1.738 \, \text{Å} = 0.1738 \, \text{nm}.
\]

### Final Answer
Both methods yield a wavelength of approximately \( 0.17 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to option **G**.
