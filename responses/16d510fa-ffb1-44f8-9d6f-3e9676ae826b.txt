Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of two infinite series: the first part is 1/e^n from n=1 to infinity, and the second part is 1/(n(n+1)) from n=1 to infinity. The options given are a bunch of numbers, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me start by breaking this down. The sum is the combination of two separate series, so I can probably compute each one individually and then add them together. That makes sense because the sum of two convergent series is just the sum of their sums.

First, let's tackle the 1/e^n part. I remember that a geometric series has the form a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ..., and it sums to a/(1 - r) when |r| < 1. In this case, the series is 1/e + 1/e^2 + 1/e^3 + ..., so the first term a is 1/e, and the common ratio r is also 1/e because each term is multiplied by 1/e to get the next one.

So, applying the geometric series formula, the sum S1 would be (1/e) / (1 - 1/e). Let me compute that. Let's see, 1/e is approximately 0.3679. So, 1 - 0.3679 is about 0.6321. Then, 0.3679 divided by 0.6321 is roughly 0.58198. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The sum S1 is (1/e) divided by (1 - 1/e). Let me compute the denominator first: 1 - 1/e ≈ 1 - 0.3679 ≈ 0.6321. Then, 1/e is approximately 0.3679, so 0.3679 / 0.6321 ≈ 0.58198. Hmm, but wait, isn't 1/(e - 1) approximately equal to 0.58198? Let me compute 1/(e - 1): e is about 2.71828, so e-1 is about 1.71828, and 1 divided by that is roughly 0.58198. So yes, that's correct. So S1 ≈ 0.58198.

Now, moving on to the second series: 1/(n(n+1)) from n=1 to infinity. I recall that this is a telescoping series. The general term can be written using partial fractions. Let me express 1/(n(n+1)) as A/n + B/(n+1). So, solving for A and B: 

1 = A(n+1) + Bn.

Setting n = -1: 1 = A(0) + B(-1) → 1 = -B → B = -1.

Setting n = 0: 1 = A(1) + B(0) → A = 1.

So, 1/(n(n+1)) = 1/n - 1/(n+1). 

Now, when we expand the series, it should telescope. Let's write out the first few terms:

For n=1: 1/1 - 1/2
n=2: 1/2 - 1/3
n=3: 1/3 - 1/4
...
n=k: 1/k - 1/(k+1)
...

When we add these up from n=1 to N, most terms cancel out. The sum becomes (1 - 1/2) + (1/2 - 1/3) + (1/3 - 1/4) + ... + (1/N - 1/(N+1))). All the middle terms cancel, leaving 1 - 1/(N+1). As N approaches infinity, 1/(N+1) approaches 0, so the sum S2 is 1 - 0 = 1.

So, S2 is exactly 1.

Now, the total sum S is S1 + S2, which is approximately 0.58198 + 1 = 1.58198.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.581, which is very close to our computed value. So, I think the answer should be D.

The sum of the two series is approximately 1.58198, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
