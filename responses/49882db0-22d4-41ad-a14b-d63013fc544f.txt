Okay, so I've got this question about how Rogers would explain the parents' attitude towards Peter becoming an artist instead of a doctor. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Rogers was a psychologist known for his work in person-centered therapy. He focused a lot on the concept of the self and how individuals maintain a coherent sense of themselves, which he called the "self-concept." He also talked about the importance of congruence between a person's experiences and their self-view.

In this scenario, Peter's family has a long tradition of all male members being doctors. So, Peter's parents likely have a strong belief that being a doctor is the expected and valued path. They claim to love him but are upset about his choice to become an artist. That seems contradictory because if they love him, why are they upset?

Rogers would probably explain this by looking at the parents' self-structure. Their self-concept includes the idea that male family members should be doctors. This is a core part of their identity and how they see themselves and their family. When Peter chooses a different path, it challenges this belief. It creates a conflict because their love for Peter is separate from their expectation that he follows the family legacy.

So, the parents' distress isn't necessarily because they don't love him, but because their expectations (or self-structure) are being threatened. Rogers would say that this incongruence between their self-concept and Peter's choice causes emotional discomfort. They might feel that their values and sense of family identity are being questioned, which is why they're upset despite their love.

Looking at the options:

A: Talks about continuing the family legacy, which is part of it, but doesn't address the self-structure aspect.

B: Directly mentions the self-structure and the threat to their value system, fitting with Rogers' theory.

C: Focuses on societal respect, which might be a factor but doesn't tie into Rogers' concepts.

D: Suggests rejection of family values, which is similar but more about rejection than the internal conflict.

E: Talent isn't addressed by Rogers in this context.

F: Social stigma is a possible reason, but again, more about external factors than internal self-structure.

G: Financial concerns are practical but not the main issue here.

H: Disvaluing the arts is a possibility, but again, not the main Rogersian explanation.

I: Contribution to family reputation is similar to A and B but more about reputation than self-structure.

J: Believing it's a phase is more about uncertainty than Rogers' concepts.

So, the best fit is B because it directly relates to the self-structure and the threat to their internalized values, which aligns with how Rogers would explain the parents' behavior.

The parents' upset stems from their self-structure, which includes the belief that male family members must be doctors. This belief is threatened when Peter chooses a different path, causing distress despite their love for him. 

Answer: B
