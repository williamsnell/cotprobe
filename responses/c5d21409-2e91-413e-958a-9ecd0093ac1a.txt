Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Mill's objections to utilitarianism. The question is asking what one of the strongest objections Mill points out is drawn from. The options are A to J, with various terms like justice, supererogation, honesty, etc.

First, I remember that John Stuart Mill was a philosopher who discussed utilitarianism, which is a theory that suggests actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they cause suffering. Mill did write about the strengths and weaknesses of this theory.

I think the key here is to recall what Mill considered a major criticism. I've heard before that Mill talked about the "higher pleasures" versus "lower pleasures," but that's more about the quality of happiness rather than a criticism. Wait, but the question is about an objection, so maybe it's something else.

Another point I remember is that Mill discussed the distinction between duty and virtue. He might have pointed out that utilitarianism can be seen as failing to account for certain moral intuitions, like justice or fairness. So perhaps the objection is related to justice.

Looking at the options, option A is justice. That seems plausible. I think Mill might have argued that utilitarianism could justify unjust actions if they lead to greater overall happiness, which people find objectionable. So the idea of justice being a strong objection makes sense.

Other options: Supererogation is about actions that go above the call of duty, but I don't think that's the main point Mill was making. Morality (D) is too broad, and ethics (J) is similar. Pleasure (H) is actually what utilitarianism is based on, so that's not an objection. Altruism (I) is about selflessness, which might be related but not the main point.

Integrity (F) and duty (G) are related to moral concepts, but I think justice is more specific and directly tied to a common criticism of utilitarianism. So I'm leaning towards A: justice.
