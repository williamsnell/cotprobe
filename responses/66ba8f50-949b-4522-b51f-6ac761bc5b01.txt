Okay, so I have this question about glass and water prisms and the smallest refracting angles that prevent any light from passing through. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let me try to think this through.

First, the question is asking for the smallest angle a prism can have such that no ray is transmitted through it. That sounds like it's related to total internal reflection. Right, because when light hits a boundary between two media, if the angle is large enough, it won't transmit but instead reflects back. But wait, prisms usually refract light, not just reflect. So maybe this is about the critical angle where total internal reflection occurs.

Wait, but prisms are typically used to refract light, so when would a prism cause no transmission? Oh, I think when the angle of the prism is so small that the light bends so much that it doesn't exit the other side. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's about the maximum angle where even the refracted ray exits. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think the key here is the critical angle for total internal reflection. The critical angle is the angle of incidence beyond which light is completely reflected, not transmitted. So for a prism, if the angle of the prism is such that the light inside reaches the critical angle when it tries to exit, then no transmission occurs.

Wait, but prisms have two different refractive indices. If the light is going from a higher index material (like glass, n=1.5) to a lower index material (like air, n=1). The critical angle would be when the light inside the prism is incident at an angle where it doesn't refract out but reflects back. So the critical angle θ_c is given by sin(θ_c) = n2/n1, where n2 is the lower index, and n1 is the higher.

Wait, n2 is the surrounding medium. So for glass (n=1.5) to air (n=1), the critical angle would be sinθ_c = 1/1.5 = 2/3. So θ_c = arcsin(2/3). Let me calculate that. What's arcsin(2/3)? I remember that sin(41°) is about 0.656, which is close to 2/3 (≈0.6667). Wait, 2/3 is about 0.6667, so maybe around 41.8 degrees? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, when you go from a higher index to a lower index, the critical angle is when the refracted angle is 90 degrees. So the formula is correct.

Wait, but how does the prism's angle play into this? The prism's apex angle is the angle between its two faces. So for a prism with apex angle A, when light enters, it's refracted, and then when it exits, it's refracted again. If the prism is too small (i.e., a small apex angle), then the light might not even reach the opposite face, but for the case where no light is transmitted, maybe the light exits at the other face without being refracted out, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The question is about the smallest angle that the prism can have so that no ray can be transmitted through it. That probably means that any incoming ray would either be reflected or undergo total internal reflection. Wait, but prisms are usually designed to refract light, so maybe the idea is that if the prism's angle is so small that even the most deviated ray (due to refraction) doesn't exit, leading to total internal reflection.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's imagine a glass prism with apex angle A. When a light ray enters the prism, it refracts towards the normal, and then when it exits, it refracts away from the normal. The condition for no transmission would be that the exiting angle is such that the light doesn't exit, i.e., it undergoes total internal reflection at the exit face.

Wait, but for that to happen, the angle of incidence at the exit face must be greater than the critical angle. So the maximum angle inside the prism that the light can have at the exit face is such that sin(theta) >= n2/n1, where n2 is the surrounding medium's refractive index.

Wait, let's clarify. The light enters the prism, refracts towards the normal, and then when it exits, it refracts away. The maximum angle that the light can make with the normal inside the prism at the exit face is determined by the prism's apex angle and the refraction at the entry face.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the maximum angle that the light can have inside the prism when exiting. If that angle is larger than the critical angle, then the light undergoes total internal reflection and doesn't exit, thus no transmission.

So, the critical angle for glass (n=1.5) to air (n=1) is θ_c = arcsin(1/1.5) ≈ 41.81 degrees. So, if the angle of incidence at the exit face is greater than 41.81 degrees, the light won't exit.

Now, the prism's apex angle A is the angle between its two faces. So, when a light ray enters the prism at the first face, it refracts towards the normal. The angle inside the prism at the entry point is determined by the angle of incidence and the refractive index.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the scenario where the prism is oriented such that the light enters at the first face, the prism's apex is opposite, and the light exits at the second face. The path depends on the apex angle A.

Wait, but for the light not to transmit, perhaps the prism's apex angle is such that the light bends so much that when it reaches the opposite face, the angle of incidence there is beyond the critical angle, causing total internal reflection. So, the maximum angle inside the prism at the exit face is determined by the prism's apex angle.

Wait, maybe I should model the ray's path. Let's say the prism has apex angle A. When a light ray enters the prism at an angle θ, it refracts towards the normal. Then, at the exit face, the angle inside the prism would be determined by the apex angle and the refraction at the entry.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum angle that the light can make inside the prism at the exit face is when the light is entering at the critical angle itself. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: The smallest possible prism angle (i.e., the smallest apex angle) that causes no transmission would be when the prism's angle is such that the light, upon entering, is refracted so that when it reaches the opposite face, the angle of incidence is exactly the critical angle. Any smaller prism angle would mean that the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, leading to total internal reflection.

So, to find the smallest apex angle A where the light just fails to exit, we can model this as when the light inside the prism at the exit face makes an angle equal to the critical angle.

Let me try to visualize this. The light enters the first face, refracts towards the normal, then travels through the prism, and upon exiting, refracts away. If the prism's apex angle is such that at the exit face, the angle of the light inside is exactly the critical angle, then it's the threshold.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the path of the light. When the light enters the prism, it makes an angle θ_i with the normal at the first face. After refraction, inside the prism, the angle is θ_r, given by Snell's law: sinθ_i = n * sinθ_r, where n is the refractive index of the prism (1.5 for glass, 1.33 for water).

Wait, no, Snell's law is n1 sinθ1 = n2 sinθ2. So when the light goes from air (n=1) into glass (n=1.5), it's n_air sinθ_air = n_glass sinθ_glass. So sinθ_glass = (sinθ_air)/1.5.

But the problem is about the smallest prism angle such that no light is transmitted. So perhaps the prism is oriented such that the light enters, refracts, and then when it reaches the opposite face, the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, causing it to reflect back.

Wait, but how is the prism's angle related to this? Let me consider a triangular prism. The apex angle is the angle between the two faces. So if the prism's apex angle is A, then when a light ray enters, it refracts towards the normal, and then, depending on A, the exit angle changes.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that after refraction at the first face, the light's angle inside the prism is such that when it reaches the opposite face, the angle of incidence is equal to the critical angle.

So, the angle inside the prism after the first refraction is θ_r. The angle between the two faces is A, so the angle that the light makes with the normal at the exit face would be θ_r + A (if I'm thinking about it right). Wait, no, maybe it's θ_r - A? Or perhaps A is the apex angle, so the change in direction is A. Hmm, perhaps I should draw a diagram mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at the exit face is determined by the apex angle and the initial refraction. Let me try to model it.

The light enters at angle θ_i (in air) and refracts to θ_r inside the prism. Then, because the prism's apex angle is A, the light's path inside the prism is deviated by angle A. So when it exits, the angle inside the prism at the exit face is θ_r + A (if A is the angle between the two faces). Wait, no, that might not be correct because the light's path inside the prism is determined by the faces. Maybe the angle at exit is θ_r + A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of the minimum angle A such that the light cannot exit. So, in the prism, the light's angle at the exit face must be greater than or equal to the critical angle for total internal reflection.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the angle of the light inside the prism at the exit face is equal to the critical angle. So, the maximum angle that the light can have at the exit face without undergoing total internal reflection is the critical angle.

Wait, so for no transmission, the angle of the light inside the prism at the exit face must be greater than or equal to the critical angle. So, the smallest A is when the light's angle at the exit face is exactly the critical angle.

So, let's model this. Let's say the light enters the prism at an angle θ_i in air. It refracts to θ_r inside the prism, given by n_air sinθ_i = n_glass sinθ_r. Since n_air is 1, sinθ_r = sinθ_i / n_glass.

Now, the prism's apex angle is A, so the light's path inside the prism is such that when it exits, the angle with the normal is θ_r + A. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Because the apex angle is the angle between the two faces, so the total deviation of the light inside the prism is A. So, the exit angle would be θ_r + A relative to the normal at the exit face.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again: when a light enters a prism with apex angle A, the deviation angle inside the prism is A. So the exit angle (relative to the normal) is θ_r (after refraction at entry) plus the prism's apex angle A.

Wait, but that's not correct either because the prism's apex angle is the angle between the two faces, so the light's path is such that the total deviation is A. So the exit angle inside the prism would be θ_r plus the angle that the prism causes. Alternatively, perhaps the exit angle is θ_r plus A.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the geometry. Let me model the prism as a triangle with apex angle A. The light enters at the first face, makes an angle θ_i with the normal, refracts to θ_r inside. Then, the path inside the prism is such that when it exits, the angle with the normal is θ_r + A.

Wait, that might not be correct because the prism's apex angle is the angle between the two faces, so the light's path is deflected by that angle. So, the exit angle inside the prism (with respect to the normal) would be θ_r + A.

Wait, but if that's the case, for the light to undergo total internal reflection at the exit face, this exit angle must be ≥ the critical angle θ_c.

So, the condition is θ_r + A ≥ θ_c.

Wait, but θ_r is given by Snell's law: θ_r = arcsin(sinθ_i / n_glass). But θ_i is the angle of incidence in air. Wait, but in this case, we're considering the worst-case scenario where the light is entering at the maximum possible angle that would still allow it to exit. Wait, maybe I should consider the maximum possible θ_i that allows the light to just escape. No, perhaps to find the minimal A where the light can't escape, regardless of θ_i.

Wait, but the question is about the smallest prism angle A such that no ray is transmitted. So perhaps the minimal A is when the maximum possible exit angle (θ_r + A) equals the critical angle θ_c. So, for any larger A, the exit angle would be larger than θ_c, leading to no transmission.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal A is when the light exits at the critical angle. So, we set θ_r + A = θ_c.

Wait, but θ_r depends on θ_i. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the approach is to consider the maximum possible angle that the light can have inside the prism at the exit face, which would be when the light is incident perpendicular to the first face (θ_i = 0), but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps when the light is incident at the maximum possible angle in air that allows it to enter the prism.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The smallest prism angle A such that no light can pass through would be when even the most deviated ray (the ray that would exit at the maximum possible angle) doesn't escape, i.e., it undergoes total internal reflection.

So, the maximum angle inside the prism at the exit face is when the light is incident at the maximum angle possible without being reflected. Wait, perhaps when the light is entering the prism at the critical angle for the exit face.

Wait, maybe the condition is that the angle inside the prism at the exit face is equal to the critical angle. So, sin(theta_exit_inside) = n_air / n_glass.

Wait, but theta_exit_inside is the angle of incidence at the exit face. So, sin(theta_exit_inside) = 1/n_glass.

So, theta_exit_inside = arcsin(1/n_glass).

Now, the angle inside the prism after refraction at the entry face is theta_r, and then the prism's apex angle A causes the light to be deviated by A. So, the exit angle inside is theta_r + A.

Wait, but that might not be accurate because the light's path inside the prism is determined by the angles. Let me think: when the light enters the prism, it refracts towards the normal, making angle theta_r. The prism's apex angle is A, so the light's path is deviated by A, so when it exits, the angle relative to the normal is theta_r + A. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

So, the condition is that theta_r + A >= theta_c.

But theta_r is given by Snell's law: sin(theta_i) = n_glass * sin(theta_r). However, theta_i is the angle of incidence in air. But to find the minimal A, perhaps we can consider the case where theta_i is 90 degrees, but that would mean the light is entering perpendicular to the first face, which might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum theta_i is when the light is entering at the maximum possible angle before it doesn't enter the prism. Wait, but that's when the light is just grazing the prism's face, which would be when theta_i is 90 degrees, but that's not practical.

Alternatively, maybe to find the minimal A, we can consider the scenario where the light is entering the prism at the smallest possible angle that would cause the exit angle to be equal to the critical angle.

Wait, perhaps the minimal A occurs when the light is entering perpendicular to the first face (theta_i = 0), so theta_r = 0 (no refraction), and then the exit angle is A. So, for the light to just fail to exit, A must be equal to theta_c. But that can't be right because, in that case, the prism's angle would be 41.8 degrees for glass, which is a very small angle, but looking at the options, the angles are all larger than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is about the maximum angle that the prism can have before light can pass through. No, the question asks for the smallest angle that prevents any transmission.

Wait, perhaps the minimal A is when the light, after refraction at the first face, is at the critical angle when it reaches the second face. So, after refraction, theta_r is such that when the prism's apex angle A is added, the total is equal to theta_c.

So, theta_r + A = theta_c.

But theta_r is determined by the angle of incidence in air, theta_i. Wait, but perhaps the maximum theta_i possible is when the light just enters the prism, which would be when theta_i is 90 degrees, but that would mean theta_r is 90 degrees as well, which isn't possible. So maybe I should think of theta_i as the angle that allows theta_r to be such that when added to A, it's equal to theta_c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the light entering the prism at an angle theta_i, refracting to theta_r, and then when it reaches the exit face, the angle inside is theta_r + A. For no transmission, theta_r + A >= theta_c.

To find the minimal A, we can set theta_r + A = theta_c, and find A.

But theta_r is given by n_air sin(theta_i) = n_glass sin(theta_r) → sin(theta_r) = (sin(theta_i)) / n_glass.

Now, to find the minimal A, perhaps we should consider the case where theta_i is as large as possible without the light reflecting at the first face. Wait, but the maximum theta_i would be when the light is just entering the prism, which would be when theta_i is 90 degrees, but that's not possible because the light would just graze the surface. So perhaps the maximum theta_i is when the light is entering at the critical angle for the first face. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the first face is from air to glass, and the critical angle there would be for glass to air, which is higher than air to glass.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think again. The minimal A is the smallest angle such that when the light enters the prism, after refraction and the prism's deviation, the angle inside at the exit face is equal to the critical angle. So, A = theta_c - theta_r.

But theta_r depends on theta_i, which is the angle of incidence in air. To find the minimal A, perhaps we take the maximum theta_i possible that allows the light to enter the prism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal A is when the light is entering the prism at the maximum possible angle that still allows it to exit without total internal reflection. Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula or a known approach. I recall that the condition for a prism to cause total internal reflection is when the apex angle A is greater than twice the critical angle. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think: For a prism, the maximum angle of deviation is when the light enters perpendicular to the face, and the deviation is A. Wait, no, the maximum deviation occurs when the light enters perpendicular to the face, and the deviation is A. So, if the deviation is A, and the light must have an angle inside the prism at the exit face greater than theta_c, then perhaps A must be greater than theta_c.

Wait, but that would suggest that the minimal A is when A = theta_c. So for glass, A = 41.81 degrees. But looking at the options, the glass prisms have angles around 80-87 degrees, which are much larger than 41.8 degrees. So that can't be right. I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the light exiting but about the light not entering. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the smallest angle A such that any ray incident on the prism is deviated by A, and the maximum deviation causes the light to undergo total internal reflection at the exit face.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The critical angle for glass to air is about 41.8 degrees. So, for the light to undergo total internal reflection at the exit face, the angle inside the prism at that face must be greater than 41.8 degrees.

So, the condition is that the angle inside the prism at the exit face is greater than or equal to 41.8 degrees. Now, the question is, what's the minimal apex angle A such that this condition holds for any ray entering the prism.

Wait, but perhaps the minimal A is when the maximum angle inside the prism at the exit face is exactly 41.8 degrees. To find this, we can model the light entering the prism at the angle that would cause the maximum exit angle.

Wait, perhaps the maximum angle inside the prism at the exit face occurs when the light enters perpendicular to the first face, i.e., theta_i = 0 degrees. In that case, theta_r = 0 degrees, and the exit angle would be A. So, to have A >= theta_c, the minimal A is 41.8 degrees. But again, the options are much larger, so I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the angle inside the prism at the exit face with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the apex angle A is the angle between the two faces, and when the light exits, the angle it makes with the normal is A plus theta_r. So, if A + theta_r >= theta_c, then no transmission.

Wait, but theta_r is given by sin(theta_r) = (sin(theta_i)) / n_glass. But if the light is entering at an angle theta_i, what's the maximum theta_i possible?

Wait, perhaps the minimal A is determined by the condition that when the light exits, the angle inside is equal to theta_c. So, A + theta_r = theta_c.

But theta_r depends on theta_i, which is the angle of incidence in air. To find the minimal A, perhaps we can consider the case where the light is entering the prism at the maximum possible angle that still allows it to enter, which would be when theta_i is such that the light is just entering the prism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal A is when the light is entering the prism at an angle such that after refraction, the angle inside plus the apex angle equals the critical angle.

Wait, perhaps I should make an equation. Let's say that after entering the prism, the light makes an angle theta_r with the normal, and the apex angle is A. So, when it exits, the angle inside is theta_r + A. For no transmission, this must be >= theta_c.

So, theta_r + A >= theta_c.

But theta_r is given by Snell's law: sin(theta_i) = n_glass * sin(theta_r) → theta_r = arcsin(sin(theta_i)/n_glass).

Now, to find the minimal A, perhaps we can set theta_r + A = theta_c and find A as A = theta_c - theta_r.

But theta_i can vary, so perhaps we need to find the maximum possible theta_r for a given A. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal A is when the light enters at the critical angle for the first face. Wait, but the critical angle for the first face (glass to air) is higher than for air to glass. Wait, no, the critical angle for glass to air is theta_c = arcsin(1/1.5) ≈ 41.81 degrees.

So, if the light is entering the glass prism at theta_i = 90 degrees, which is grazing, then theta_r would be 90 degrees, but that's not possible because the light would just reflect. So perhaps the maximum theta_i is less than that.

Wait, maybe the maximum theta_i is when the light is entering the prism at an angle such that theta_r is as large as possible without causing the exit angle to exceed theta_c.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the case where the light is entering the prism at an angle theta_i such that after refraction, the exit angle is exactly theta_c. So, theta_r + A = theta_c.

But theta_r = arcsin(sin(theta_i)/n_glass).

We can solve for A: A = theta_c - theta_r.

But this depends on theta_i. To find the minimal A, perhaps we should consider the case where theta_i is as large as possible without the exit angle exceeding theta_c.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that when the light enters the prism at the maximum possible angle that allows it to just not undergo total internal reflection at the exit face.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal A is when the light is entering the prism at theta_i = theta_c, so that after refraction, theta_r = arcsin(sin(theta_c)/n_glass).

Wait, let's compute that for glass: n=1.5, theta_c = 41.81 degrees.

So, theta_r = arcsin(sin(41.81)/1.5).

Compute sin(41.81) ≈ 0.6667. Then 0.6667 / 1.5 ≈ 0.4445. So theta_r ≈ arcsin(0.4445) ≈ 26.3 degrees.

Then, A = theta_c - theta_r ≈ 41.81 - 26.3 ≈ 15.5 degrees. But that's much smaller than the options given. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should think about the prism's apex angle causing the light to bend such that when it exits, it's at the critical angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal apex angle A is when the light exits at the critical angle, so the apex angle plus the refraction angle at entry equals the critical angle.

Wait, let me try to model it. Let's say the light enters the prism at an angle theta_i in air, refracts to theta_r inside, and then the prism's apex angle A causes the exit angle to be theta_r + A. For no transmission, theta_r + A >= theta_c.

So, for the minimal A, we can set theta_r + A = theta_c.

But theta_r = arcsin(sin(theta_i)/n_glass).

To find the minimal A, perhaps we can find the maximum possible theta_r, which occurs when theta_i is as large as possible. But the maximum theta_i is when the light is entering the prism at the critical angle for the first face, which is when the light is about to undergo total internal reflection. Wait, no, the first face is from air to glass, so the critical angle there is higher than for glass to air.

Wait, the critical angle for air to glass is when the light is going from glass to air, which is theta_c = 41.81 degrees. So, for the first face (air to glass), the critical angle is higher, so any theta_i less than that would allow the light to enter.

Wait, perhaps the minimal A is when the light is entering the prism at the maximum possible theta_i (i.e., just below the critical angle for the first face), so that theta_r is as large as possible, and then A is such that theta_r + A = theta_c.

So, let's compute that.

For glass (n=1.5), theta_c_glass_to_air = 41.81 degrees.

The maximum theta_i for entering the prism is just below the critical angle for air to glass, which is higher. Wait, no, the critical angle for air to glass is when light goes from glass to air. The critical angle for air to glass would be when the light is going from air to glass, which is when the angle inside the glass is 90 degrees. Wait, no, Snell's law for critical angle is when the refracted angle is 90 degrees, so for air to glass, the critical angle would be when the light in air is incident at 90 degrees, which would mean it's parallel to the surface, but that's not the case. Wait, no, the critical angle is when the light in the higher index medium is incident at an angle where the refracted angle in the lower index medium is 90 degrees. So, for air to glass, the critical angle would be when the light in air is incident at 90 degrees, which would mean it's parallel to the glass surface, and the refracted angle would be 0 degrees. That doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The critical angle is only applicable when going from a higher index to a lower index medium. So, when going from glass (n=1.5) to air (n=1), the critical angle is 41.81 degrees. But when going from air to glass, the critical angle isn't applicable because you're going from lower to higher index, so all incident angles will refract into the glass.

So, the maximum theta_i for entering the prism is 90 degrees (grazing incidence), but in that case, the light would refract into the glass with theta_r = arcsin(sin(90°)/1.5) = arcsin(1/1.5) ≈ 41.81 degrees.

Wait, but that's the same as the critical angle for glass to air. So, if the light enters the prism at theta_i = 90 degrees, theta_r = 41.81 degrees.

Then, the exit angle inside the prism would be theta_r + A. So, to have no transmission, this must be >= theta_c (41.81 degrees).

So, theta_r + A >= theta_c → 41.81 + A >=41.81 → A >= 0 degrees. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm adding the angles incorrectly. Because the prism's apex angle A is the angle between the two faces, so when the light enters at theta_r, the exit angle would be A - theta_r? Or perhaps A + theta_r? I'm getting confused about the geometry.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of the prism's apex angle and the refraction angle equals the critical angle. So, A + theta_r = theta_c.

In that case, A = theta_c - theta_r.

But theta_r is determined by the angle of incidence theta_i in air.

Wait, but if the light enters at theta_i = 90 degrees, then theta_r = 41.81 degrees. Then, A = 41.81 - 41.81 = 0 degrees, which is not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the minimal apex angle A is when the light, after entering, is deviated by the prism such that the exit angle is exactly the critical angle.

Wait, perhaps the minimal A is given by A = 2*theta_c. For glass, that would be about 83.6 degrees, which is close to option D (83°27'13") for glass. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option D for glass is 83°27'13", which is approximately 83.45 degrees. That's about twice the critical angle (41.81*2≈83.62). Close enough.

Similarly, for water (n=1.33), the critical angle is theta_c = arcsin(1/1.33) ≈ 48.7 degrees. So, A = 2*48.7 ≈ 97.4 degrees. Looking at the options, option D for water is 97°14'46", which is approximately 97.24 degrees. Close to our calculation.

So, option D seems to fit: 83°27'13" for glass (≈83.45) and 97°14'46" (≈97.24) for water.

Wait, but why would the minimal apex angle be twice the critical angle? Let me think. If the prism's apex angle is twice the critical angle, then when the light enters, it's refracted towards the normal, and then the prism's angle causes the exit angle to be equal to the critical angle. So, theta_r + A = theta_c.

Wait, but if A = 2*theta_c, then theta_r = theta_c - A = - theta_c. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal A is when the light is refracted at the first face to theta_r, and then the prism's apex angle A causes the light to reach the exit face at an angle of theta_r + A, which must be equal to the critical angle theta_c.

So, theta_r + A = theta_c.

But theta_r = arcsin(sin(theta_i)/n_glass).

If the light enters at theta_i = 90 degrees (grazing), then theta_r = arcsin(1/n_glass) = theta_c.

So, theta_r = theta_c, and then A = theta_c - theta_r = 0. That can't be right.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I should look for another approach. I remember that in some cases, the minimal angle for a prism to cause total internal reflection is when the apex angle is equal to twice the critical angle. So, for glass, A = 2 * 41.81 ≈ 83.62 degrees, which matches option D's glass angle of 83°27'13" (83.45 degrees). Similarly, for water, A = 2 * 48.7 ≈97.4 degrees, which matches option D's water angle of 97°14'46" (97.24 degrees).

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

The question involves determining the smallest apex angle \( A \) for a glass prism (\( n = 1.5 \)) and a water prism (\( n = 1.33 \)) such that no light is transmitted through them. This occurs when the light undergoes total internal reflection at the exit face, which happens when the angle of incidence inside the prism at the exit face equals or exceeds the critical angle \( \theta_c \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Angle Calculation**:
   - For glass (\( n = 1.5 \)):  
     \[
     \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{1.5}\right) \approx 41.81^\circ
     \]
   - For water (\( n = 1.33 \)):  
     \[
     \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{1.33}\right) \approx 48.7^\circ
     \]

2. **Condition for No Transmission**:
   - The light must undergo total internal reflection at the exit face, meaning the angle inside the prism at the exit face must be at least \( \theta_c \).  
   - The minimal apex angle \( A \) is determined by the condition that the light, after refraction at the entry face and deviation by the prism's apex angle, reaches the exit face at an angle equal to \( \theta_c \).

3. **Minimal Apex Angle**:
   - For glass, the minimal apex angle \( A \) is approximately twice the critical angle:  
     \[
     A \approx 2 \times 41.81^\circ \approx 83.62^\circ
     \]
   - For water, similarly:  
     \[
     A \approx 2 \times 48.7^\circ \approx 97.4^\circ
     \]

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - For glass, the closest match is **83° 27' 13"** (83.45°).  
   - For water, the closest match is **97° 14' 46"** (97.24°).  
   - These values align with **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The smallest refracting angle for the glass prism is **83° 27' 13"**, and for the water prism, it is **97° 14' 46"**. These match the values provided in **Option D**.
