Okay, so I have this question about which animal is the loudest on Earth. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that loudness in animals is often measured in decibels. I think some animals are known for being really loud, like whales or elephants. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers, but I'll try to recall.

Option A is the humpback whale. I know whales can be very loud, but I'm not sure if the humpback is the loudest. I think the blue whale might be even louder. Option E is the blue whale. I've heard somewhere that blue whales are the loudest animals, with calls reaching up to 190 decibels. That's way higher than most other animals.

Option B is the African elephant. Elephants do have low-frequency rumbling sounds, but I'm not sure if they're as loud as whales. Their vocalizations are around 80-90 decibels, which is loud but not the loudest.

Option D is the lion. Lions roar, which is pretty loud, maybe around 110 decibels. That's impressive, but again, not as loud as the blue whale.

Option F is the sperm whale. I'm a bit confused here because I thought sperm whales are also very loud. They use echolocation, and their clicks can be up to 140 decibels. But I'm not sure if that's the loudest.

Option G is the howler monkey. They have very loud calls, maybe up to 128 decibels. That's pretty loud, but I think it's still less than the blue whale.

Option H is the Tasmanian devil. I'm not too familiar with their loudness, but I think they can be quite noisy, especially when fighting, but I don't think they're the loudest.

Option I is the bulldog bat. Bats use echolocation, but their sounds are usually high-pitched and not that loud in human terms.

Option J is the Indian elephant, which is similar to the African elephant in terms of size and vocalizations. So, similar to option B, probably not the loudest.

Putting it all together, the blue whale seems to be the loudest with its calls reaching up to 190 decibels. The sperm whale is also loud but maybe not as loud as the blue whale. So, I think the answer is E: blue whale.

The loudest animal on Earth is the blue whale, whose calls can reach up to 190 decibels. 

Answer: E
