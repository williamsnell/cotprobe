Okay, so I've got this question about linear transformations and vector spaces. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my linear algebra class. The question is about finding the dimension of the kernel of a linear transformation T. 

Alright, the setup is that V is the space of all real 2x3 matrices, and W is the space of all real 4x1 column vectors. T is a linear transformation from V onto W. I need to find the dimension of the kernel of T. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

First, I should recall some fundamental concepts. I remember the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which says that for a linear transformation T from a vector space V to another vector space W, the dimension of the domain V is equal to the dimension of the kernel (null space) of T plus the dimension of the image (rank) of T. So, dim(V) = dim(ker T) + dim(im T).

Wait, but wait. T is onto W, which means that the image of T is all of W. So the dimension of the image, dim(im T), is equal to dim W. That makes sense.

Now, I need to find the dimensions of V and W. Let's start with V. V consists of all 2x3 real matrices. How many elements are in such a matrix? Each row has 3 entries, and there are 2 rows, so 3*2=6 entries. Since each entry is a real number, the dimension of V is 6. So dim(V)=6.

Next, W is the space of 4x1 real column vectors. That's straightforward; each vector has 4 entries, so the dimension of W is 4. So dim(W)=4.

Since T is onto, the image of T is W, so dim(im T) = 4. Now applying the Rank-Nullity Theorem: dim(V) = dim(ker T) + dim(im T). Plugging in the numbers, 6 = dim(ker T) + 4. Solving for dim(ker T), I subtract 4 from both sides: 6-4=2. So dim(ker T)=2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because sometimes it's easy to get confused between rows and columns, but in this case, V is 2x3 matrices, so 2 rows and 3 columns, which gives 6 entries. So yes, 6-dimensional. W is 4-dimensional because it's 4x1. 

So according to the theorem, 6=dim(ker T) +4, so dim(ker T)=2. Looking at the options, option E is 2. So the answer should be E.

But wait, just to make sure I'm not making any mistake. The kernel of T is all the matrices in V that T sends to the zero vector in W. Since T is onto, it doesn't necessarily make the kernel trivial. The kernel's dimension depends on the transformation, but according to the Rank-Nullity theorem, it's the domain dimension minus the rank. Since the rank here is 4 (because it's onto a 4D space), and the domain is 6D, 6-4=2. So yeah, I'm confident it's 2. So the answer is E.

The dimension of the kernel of T is 2.
