Okay, so I have this algebra problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of simplifying expressions. But I'll take it step by step. The problem is to simplify (5x + 3) minus 2 times (2x minus 4). Hmm, let's see.

First, I remember that when you have parentheses like that, you might need to distribute or expand them. So the expression is (5x + 3) minus 2*(2x - 4). I think the key here is to handle the subtraction correctly, especially since there's a negative sign before the 2. I should probably distribute that negative sign into both terms inside the parentheses after multiplying by 2.

Wait, no, wait. The expression is subtracting 2 times (2x -4), right? So it's like adding the opposite of 2*(2x -4). Let me write it down step by step.

So, starting with the original expression:
(5x + 3) - 2*(2x -4)

I need to distribute the -2 across both terms inside the parentheses. Let me do that:
First, multiply -2 by 2x, which should be -4x. Then, multiply -2 by -4, which is +8 because a negative times a negative is a positive.

So after distributing, the expression becomes:
5x + 3 -4x +8

Now, I should combine like terms. The terms with x are 5x and -4x, and the constant terms are 3 and 8.

Combining 5x -4x gives me x. Then, 3 +8 is 11.

So putting it all together, the simplified expression is x +11.

Wait, let me double-check that. Did I distribute correctly? The original expression was (5x +3) minus 2*(2x -4). So when I distribute the -2, it's -2*2x = -4x and -2*(-4) = +8. Yes, that's correct.

Then combining 5x -4x is indeed x. And 3 +8 is 11. So the final simplified form is x +11.

Looking back at the options, option B is x+11, so that should be the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just visualize it again:

Original: (5x +3) - 2*(2x -4)
After distribution: 5x +3 -4x +8
Combine like terms: (5x-4x) + (3+8) = x +11.

Yep, that's right. So the answer must be B.

The expression simplifies to x + 11.
