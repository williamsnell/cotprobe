Okay, so I've got this question about the metabolic fates of alpha-D-glucose and which process is more efficient based on the standard free energy changes. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the efficiency of a process can often be determined by looking at the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔG°. A more negative ΔG° usually indicates a more spontaneous and thus more efficient process. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if it's about the magnitude or the actual value. Oh right, because if ΔG° is negative, the process is spontaneous, so a more negative value would mean more favorable.

The question gives me two reactions, (a) and (b), and their respective ΔG° values for the products. I need to calculate the overall ΔG° for each reaction to compare which is more efficient.

Let me write down the reactions again:

Reaction (a):
α-D-glucose → 2 ethanol + 2 CO₂(g)
ΔG° for ethanol (1 M) is -43.39 kcal/mol
CO₂(g) is -94.26 kcal/mol
α-D-glucose is -219.22 kcal/mol

So, the formula for calculating ΔG° for the reaction is:
ΔG°_reaction = Σ ΔG°(products) - Σ ΔG°(reactants)

For reaction (a), the reactants are just glucose, and the products are ethanol and CO₂.

So, the products' sum would be:
2 ethanol: 2 * (-43.39) = -86.78
2 CO₂: 2 * (-94.26) = -188.52
Total for products: -86.78 + (-188.52) = -275.3

The reactants sum is just glucose: -219.22

So ΔG°_a = (-275.3) - (-219.22) = -275.3 + 219.22 = -56.08 kcal/mol

Wait, that's a negative value, so reaction (a) is spontaneous.

Now reaction (b):
6 O₂(g) + α-D-glucose → 6 CO₂(g) + 6 H₂O(l)

Given ΔG° values:
O₂(g) is presumably 0 because it's an element in its standard state.
CO₂(g) is -94.26
H₂O(l) is -56.69
Glucose is -219.22

So products sum:
6 CO₂: 6 * (-94.26) = -565.56
6 H₂O: 6 * (-56.69) = -340.14
Total products: -565.56 + (-340.14) = -905.7

Reactants sum:
α-D-glucose: -219.22
6 O₂: 6 * 0 = 0
Total reactants: -219.22

So ΔG°_b = (-905.7) - (-219.22) = -905.7 + 219.22 = -686.48 kcal/mol

That's a much more negative value than reaction (a), which was about -56.08.

Wait, but wait. Reaction (a) is producing ethanol and CO₂, whereas reaction (b) is the complete oxidation to CO₂ and water. So which one is more efficient? Since reaction (b) has a much larger negative ΔG°, it's more efficient because it releases more energy. So the more negative the ΔG°, the more efficient the process.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D: Reaction (b) because it has a more efficient (more negative) ΔG°.

To determine the more efficient utilization of α-D-glucose, we calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for each reaction:

**Reaction (a):**  
α-D-glucose → 2 ethanol + 2 CO₂(g)  
ΔG° products = 2(-43.39) + 2(-94.26) = -86.78 - 188.52 = -275.3  
ΔG° reactants = -219.22  
ΔG°_a = (-275.3) - (-219.22) = -56.08 kcal/mol  

**Reaction (b):**  
6 O₂(g) + α-D-glucose → 6 CO₂(g) + 6 H₂O(l)  
ΔG° products = 6(-94.26) + 6(-56.69) = -565.56 - 340.14 = -905.7  
ΔG° reactants = -219.22  
ΔG°_b = (-905.7) - (-219.22) = -686.48 kcal/mol  

Since ΔG°_b is more negative than ΔG°_a, reaction (b) is more efficient.
