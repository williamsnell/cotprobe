Question:

An attorney received a document at his office with an attached note from a client for whom he had just finished drafting a will. The note read as follows: "Do you think this contract of sale for my boat complies with state law? I would have talked to you in person about this, but I'm on my way out of town. I will be back next week." The attorney reviewed the document and wrote a one-page letter to the client stating that the document complied with state law. The lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a reasonable fee. The client refused to pay the attorney anything, arguing that she had never agreed to retain the attorney and that she had received nothing of value from the attorney because the sales transaction was never concluded. Assume that there is no applicable statute or rule governing the formation of attorney-client relationships in the jurisdiction. If the attorney sues the client for the $500, will the attorney be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the client did not sign a formal agreement with the attorney.
B: No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.
C: No, because the attorney did not confirm the fee before providing the service.
D: No, because the client's note did not explicitly ask for a billable service.
E: Yes, because the attorney provided a service that is usually billable.
F: Yes, because the client was aware that the attorney's services are typically charged.
G: Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.
H: No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
I: Yes, because the client benefited from the attorney's professional advice.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about whether the attorney will prevail in suing the client for $500. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: An attorney received a note from a client asking if a contract of sale for her boat complies with state law. The client was leaving town but would be back next week. The attorney reviewed the document, wrote a one-page letter saying it complies, and included a $500 bill. The client refused to pay, saying she never agreed to retain the attorney and that the sale never went through, so she didn't get anything of value.

The question is whether the attorney will likely win if he sues. The options are from A to J.

I remember that contract law requires offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent. Since there's no statute or rule governing attorney-client relationships, we'll have to rely on general contract principles.

Let's look at what happened here. The client sent a note asking for a legal opinion on the contract. The attorney responded with a letter and a bill. Did this create a contract?

The client didn't explicitly say "retain you" or "please review this for me," but she did ask for a legal opinion. The attorney provided that service. So, is there an implied agreement?

In contract law, sometimes an implied contract can exist when one party makes a request and the other provides the service. Here, the client asked for a legal review, and the attorney provided it. There's a mutual understanding, even if not explicit.

Consideration: The client didn't pay, but the attorney provided a service. The attorney's time and expertise are consideration. The client's request is the other consideration, but actually, in a professional services context, the client's request is enough to form a contract when the service is provided.

So, looking at the options:

A: No, because no formal agreement. But contracts don't need to be formal; they can be oral or implied. So A might not be correct.

B: No, because they didn't agree on essential terms. Essential terms usually include the subject matter, which here is the review, and consideration. It seems they did agree on that, so B might be incorrect.

C: No, because fee wasn't confirmed before service. The fee was included in the letter, so maybe the client knew what she was paying. But even if the fee wasn't discussed beforehand, the service was provided, so consideration exists.

D: No, because the note didn't explicitly ask for a billable service. The client's note did ask for an opinion, which is a billable service in an attorney's practice. So D might be wrong.

E: Yes, because the service is usually billable. Attorneys usually bill for such services, so providing the letter is a service that's typically chargeable. This seems correct.

F: Yes, because the client knew the services are charged. She might have known, but without an explicit agreement, does that matter? But the attorney provided the service, so F could be a reason.

G: Yes, because the attorney acted to his detriment. If the attorney relied on the client's promise and provided service, but in this case, the client didn't promise to pay, just asked for an opinion. The attorney provided the service, so maybe there's reliance, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

H: No, frustration of purpose. That doctrine applies when the purpose of the contract is frustrated, but here, the sale didn't go through, but the attorney's service was providing an opinion, which was completed. So H is probably wrong.

I: Yes, because the client benefited. She got the legal opinion, which is value, so I is correct.

So, between E, F, and I. The question is whether the attorney can recover because the client received value.

In contract law, consideration can be the performance of a service. The client asked for a legal review, the attorney provided it. So there's a contract implied from the conduct.

The options E and I both point to the attorney providing a service that's billable or the client benefiting.

Option E says because the service is usually billable. Option I says because the client benefited.

I think both are correct, but looking at the options, E and I are separate choices.

In many jurisdictions, an attorney can charge for providing legal advice, even if it's just an opinion. So E and I seem plausible.

But which one is the better answer? The question is about whether the attorney is likely to prevail. The key is whether the client accepted the service, which she did by reading the letter. So the attorney provided the service, which is typically billable, and the client didn't pay.

So, the correct reasoning would be that the client received a service that is usually billable, so the attorney can charge. Therefore, option E.

Alternatively, option I says the client benefited, which is also a consideration point. But the main issue is whether there was a contract formed. The fact that the service is billable is more about the consideration and the expectation that payment will be made.

So, I think E is correct.

The attorney provided a legal opinion in response to the client's request, which is a service typically billable in legal practice. This constitutes consideration and forms a contract, even if it was implied. Therefore, the attorney is likely to prevail.

Answer: E
