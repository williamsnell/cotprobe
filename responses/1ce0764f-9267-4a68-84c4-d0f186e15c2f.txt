Okay, so I have this question about Ross Perot and his performance in the 1996 presidential election. I'm a bit rusty on my U.S. history, but let me try to recall the details. 

Ross Perot was a third-party candidate, and I remember that he ran as the candidate for the Reform Party. The question mentions that he led the presidential race briefly in June with 39% in the polls. That's pretty significant because third-party candidates rarely top the polls, especially that high. But the question is asking what percentage of the popular vote he actually got in the end.

I think I remember that Perot's performance was somewhat underwhelming compared to the polls. Polls can sometimes be misleading, especially with third-party candidates because they might gain a lot of initial support but then lose steam as the election approaches. 

Looking at the options, the choices are A through J, with numbers ranging from 1% to 31%. I think the actual popular vote he received wasn't as high as the 39% in the polls. Maybe it was around 13% or 15%? Wait, no, I think it was lower. 

Wait, wasn't the actual vote share for Perot in 1996 around 8.8%? But that's not one of the options. Hmm. Let me think again. I might be mixing up the years. In 1992, Perot actually got around 18.9% of the vote, which was higher. But the question is about 1996. 

In 1996, the candidates were Bill Clinton (D), Bob Dole (R), and Perot. Clinton won, Dole was the main Republican, and Perot was the third-party guy. I think Perot's support was less than expected. Maybe around 8%, but the closest option is D:9 or J:13. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing it with another candidate. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes third-party candidates get around 5-7% in some elections. Let me think about the context. The Reform Party was strong in 1996, but I think Perot's actual vote percentage was about 8.8%, which is close to 9%, so option D:9. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 13%, but that seems higher than I remember. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and the correct answer is 13%. Wait, no, I think 9% is closer to what I recall. So I'm leaning towards D:9.

The correct answer is D:9.
