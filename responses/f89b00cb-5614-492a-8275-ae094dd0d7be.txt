Question:

A chef owned a summer cottage on the lake. In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that

Options:

A: the neighbor's sand business constitutes a misuse of the easement.
B: the chef's improvements to the roadbed grant him additional rights to the easement.
C: the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could "tack on" their successive use periods.
D: an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.
E: the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.
F: because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.
G: the assistant has a legal right to improve the easement for his own use.
H: the assistant is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the neighbor's sand business.
I: the assistant can claim ownership of the easement due to his long-term use of the property.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about easements. Let me start by breaking down what's happening in the scenario.

So, the chef has a summer cottage and wanted access, so he got an easement from his neighbor. The easement was a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet wide and a quarter mile long along the eastern edge of the neighbor's property. The chef then improved the road by asphaltizing it to make it easier for motor vehicles. Years later, the neighbor starts a sand business that requires heavy hauling, which destroyed the asphalt. Then, ten years after that, the chef sells the property to his assistant. After the sale, the neighbor puts up barriers blocking the assistant's access. The question is about the assistant's strongest argument against the neighbor.

The options are from A to I. I'll go through each possible answer and see which makes the most sense.

First, let's recall what an easement is. An easement is a non-possessory right to use another's land for a specific purpose. It's appurtenant, meaning it's tied to the dominant estate (the property benefiting from the easement) and the servient estate (the land burdened by the easement). Easements can be created by grant, implication, or prescription.

In this case, the easement was created by a written grant from the neighbor to the chef. So it's an express easement. Now, when the chef sold the property to the assistant, the question is whether the easement transferred to the new owner.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Neighbor's sand business constitutes misuse. Misuse usually involves using the easement in a way that's beyond the intended purpose or causing excessive damage. The neighbor's business required heavy hauling, which destroyed the road. But the question is about the assistant's rights, not whether the neighbor misused the easement. So maybe this isn't the strongest argument.

Option B: Chef's improvements grant additional rights. Improving the easement doesn't necessarily give more rights. The easement was for a right-of-way; improving it for better access doesn't expand the easement. So this might not be right.

Option C: Chef and assistant in privity, so they can tack on use periods. Tacking allows successive users to add their time to establish an easement by prescription, but this was a grant, not a prescriptive easement. So I don't think tacking applies here.

Option D: Easement appurtenant is alienable, so it passes with the dominant estate. Since the easement was appurtenant to the chef's property, when he sold it, the easement should transfer to the assistant as the new owner. This seems correct because appurtenant easements are generally transferred with the land.

Option E: Assistant is a bona fide purchaser protected by unrecorded easement. But the easement was granted in writing, so it's recorded. Also, even if it wasn't, the assistant bought the property after the easement was created, so he might not be a bona fide purchaser. Plus, the question is about the assistant having a right, not relying on recording statutes.

Option F: Easement created by implication gave prescriptive rights. No, the easement was a grant, not by implication or prescription, so this doesn't apply.

Option G: Assistant can improve the easement. The right to improve might exist, but the main issue is whether the assistant has the right to use the easement at all. The question is about obstruction, so this might not be the strongest argument.

Option H: Assistant can claim compensation for damage. The neighbor's actions (heavy hauling) destroyed the road, but the question is about removing barriers, not compensation for past damage. So this might not be the main issue.

Option I: Assistant can claim ownership due to long-term use. Using it long-term doesn't create ownership; it's still an easement, not a fee simple. So this is incorrect.

So the strongest argument seems to be D: the easement is appurtenant and thus passed with the property to the assistant. The assistant, as the new owner, has the right to the easement and the neighbor can't obstruct it.

The assistant's strongest argument is that as the new owner of the dominant estate, he inherited the appurtenant easement when the chef sold the property. Therefore, the neighbor cannot obstruct the easement.

Answer: D
