Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the current ratio for Jefferson's Clothing. Let me start by recalling what the current ratio is. I remember that the current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. The formula for it is Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities.

Looking at the question, the company has current assets of $150,000 and current liabilities of $50,000. So I think I just need to divide the current assets by the current liabilities.

Let me write that down: $150,000 divided by $50,000. Hmm, doing the math, 150 divided by 50 is 3. So the current ratio should be 3. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything else. The question also mentions capital of $200,000, but I don't think that affects the current ratio because capital is part of the equity section on the balance sheet and not a current liability. The current ratio only looks at current assets and current liabilities.

So yeah, the calculation seems straightforward. Current assets are higher than current liabilities, which is good because it means the company can cover its short-term obligations easily. 

Looking at the options, H is 3, which matches my calculation. So I'm pretty confident that H is the correct answer.

The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. For Jefferson's Clothing, this is $150,000 / $50,000 = 3. The capital figure is not relevant here as it is part of equity, not current liabilities. 

Answer: H
