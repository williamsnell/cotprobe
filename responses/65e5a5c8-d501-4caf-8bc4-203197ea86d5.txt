Alright, so I've got this question about what "Svetambara" means, and I need to pick the correct option from A to J. Let's see, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think it's related to a religious or cultural term. 

First, I remember that "Svetambara" is associated with Jainism. Jainism is an ancient Indian religion, and I think they have different sects or traditions. One of the main branches is the Svetambara, and I believe there's another called the Digambara. Wait, what's the difference between them?

From what I recall, the terms Digambara and Svetambara refer to how the monks or ascetics dress. The word "Digambara" means "sky-clad," which I think implies that they wear very minimal clothing, maybe just what they can get from the environment, hence "sky" as their cloak. On the other hand, "Svetambara" is the other main branch. 

Breaking down "Svetambara": "Sveta" likely means white, and "mbara" probably relates to being clad or dressed. So putting it together, "white-clad." That would mean they wear white clothing, which is more than just minimal. 

Wait, let me make sure. In Jainism, the Svetambara monks wear white clothes, while the Digambara monks are more裸衣 (naked), but I think they might wear something minimal like a loin cloth. So "Svetambara" would mean "white-clad," which is option J. 

Looking back at the options, J is "White-clad." That makes sense. So the answer should be J.

The term "Svetambara" in Jainism refers to the branch where monks wear white clothing, distinguishing them from the Digambara, who are more minimally clad. 

Answer: J
