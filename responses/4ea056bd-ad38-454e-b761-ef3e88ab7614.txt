Okay, I'm trying to figure out which option is NOT a defining feature of postcolonialism in security studies. Let me start by recalling what I know about postcolonialism. 

Postcolonialism is a perspective that critically examines the impacts of colonialism on contemporary politics, economics, and culture. It often challenges the narratives of the West and looks at issues from the viewpoint of formerly colonized nations. In security studies, it probably looks at how colonial histories affect current security issues, the role of non-European perspectives, and the ways global inequalities influence security.

Looking at the options:

A: Focuses on economic factors. I'm not sure if this is a primary focus. I know that postcolonialism often looks at economic structures but I'm not certain if it's the main point distinguishing it from others.

B: Not exclusively European. Yes, that's a key point. Postcolonialism incorporates non-European knowledges, so this is a defining feature.

C: Doesn't consider colonial history. Wait, postcolonialism is all about examining colonial history's impact, so this would be the opposite. If an option says it doesn't consider that, that's probably the wrong feature.

D: Doesn't consider global inequality. Again, postcolonialism addresses how global inequalities affect security, so this option might be incorrect.

E: Considers nation or community as referents. Security studies usually focus on the state as a referent, but postcolonialism might also consider communities, so this could be a feature.

F: Focus on violence. I think postcolonialism does discuss violence, especially how it's used in colonial contexts, so this is likely a feature.

G: Concentrates on bilateral issues. I don't recall postcolonialism being specifically about bilateral over multilateral; maybe it's more about broader structures, so this might not be a defining feature.

H: Disregards cultural factors. No, postcolonialism often considers cultural aspects because they're tied to identity and power dynamics, so this is incorrect.

I: Considers small wars and asymmetric conflicts. Yes, because these are relevant in postcolonial contexts where weaker states or groups face stronger ones.

So, the question is which option is NOT a defining feature. From what I gathered:

Option C says postcolonialism doesn't consider colonial history. But that's actually a key aspect of postcolonialism, so the opposite would be the case. Wait, no—if the option says it doesn't consider colonial history, that would be incorrect because postcolonialism does consider it. So the question is asking which is NOT a defining feature, meaning that option is incorrect in its description. So if the question is which is NOT a feature, then the correct answer would be the option that is false about postcolonialism.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a defining feature. So the correct answer would be the one that is not true about postcolonialism.

Looking again:

Option C says "doesn't consider the influence of colonial history." But postcolonialism does consider it. So C is not a defining feature of postcolonialism; in fact, it's the opposite. So the answer would be C.

Similarly, option D says it doesn't consider global inequality. But postcolonialism does, so D is also not a defining feature. Wait, but the question is which is NOT a defining feature. So if the options list features that are NOT part of postcolonialism, then the correct answer is the one that's incorrect.

Wait, the question is asking which option is NOT a defining feature. So which option is something that postcolonialism doesn't do. So looking for an option that describes something postcolonialism doesn't do.

A: Focuses on economic factors. I'm not sure if this is primary. Mainly, postcolonialism looks at power dynamics, including economic ones, but maybe it's not the primary focus.

C: Doesn't consider colonial history. No, postcolonialism does consider it, so that's not correct.

D: Doesn't consider global inequality. No, postcolonialism does consider it, so that's not correct.

E: Considers nation or community. Not sure, but I think it does.

F: Focus on violence. Yes.

G: Concentrates on bilateral. Not sure, but maybe not a defining feature.

H: Disregards cultural factors. No, postcolonialism considers them.

I: Considers small wars. Yes.

So the options that are incorrect (not defining features) would be C and D, but the question is which is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a defining feature, so the correct answer is the one that is not a feature. So the options that are not features are C and D.

Looking back at the options, the question is which is NOT a defining feature. So the answer is the one that is not true about postcolonialism.

So the answer should be C: Postcolonialism doesn't consider the influence of colonial history on current security issues. Because that's not true—it does consider it. So C is not a defining feature because it's the opposite.

Similarly, D says it doesn't consider global inequality, which is also not true, so D is another possible answer. But the question is which is NOT a defining feature.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a defining feature, so the correct answer is the one that is not a feature. So the answer is either C or D.

Wait, the original question is which is NOT a defining feature. So the correct answer is the option that is not a feature of postcolonialism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Postcolonialism is defined by considering colonial history (so C is wrong because it says it doesn't consider it), and it does consider global inequality (so D is wrong because it says it doesn't). So both C and D are incorrect, but the question is which is NOT a defining feature. So the answer is either C or D.

Wait, the options are:

C: Doesn't consider colonial history. So if postcolonialism does consider it, then C is not a defining feature because it's the opposite—it's a feature that postcolonialism does have. So the question is which is NOT a defining feature, so the answer is C because it's saying something that's not true.

Similarly, D says it doesn't consider global inequality, which is also false because postcolonialism does consider it. So both C and D are incorrect.

Wait, but the question asks which is NOT a defining feature. So the correct answer is the option that is NOT a feature.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate. The question is which option is NOT a defining feature. So which option describes something that postcolonialism does NOT do.

So, for example, if an option says postcolonialism focuses on economic factors, is that a defining feature? Or is it more about cultural and historical factors?

I think postcolonialism does consider economic factors, but perhaps it's not the primary focus. Alternatively, perhaps the primary focus is on the impact of colonialism, which includes economic structures.

Wait, but the question is about what distinguishes postcolonialism from other perspectives. So, for example, Realism in security studies might focus more on state power and anarchy, while postcolonialism looks at colonial legacies, cultural impacts, and global inequalities.

So looking at the options:

A: Focuses on economic factors. Is this a defining feature? Or is it more about the role of colonialism and cultural factors?

I think the defining features are more about the impact of colonialism, non-European perspectives, considering small wars, etc.

So, the options that are NOT defining features would be the ones that are more aligned with other perspectives, like Realism or Liberalism.

Looking at option A: primarily focuses on economic factors. I don't think that's a defining feature of postcolonialism; it's more about the impact of colonialism and cultural aspects.

Option E: considers nation or community group as a referent. I'm not sure. Security studies often use the state as a referent, but postcolonialism might also consider communities, so this could be a defining feature.

Option G: concentrates on bilateral rather than multilateral. I don't think that's a defining feature; postcolonialism might look at broader structures beyond just bilateral issues.

Option H: disregards cultural factors. No, postcolonialism considers them.

So the options that are NOT defining features would be the ones that are not about colonial history, cultural factors, global inequality, etc.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a defining feature. So the correct answer is the one that is not a feature.

Looking at the options again, the question is which is NOT a defining feature.

So, for example, if an option says postcolonialism focuses on economic factors (A), is that a defining feature? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the defining features are B, C is incorrect (since it's opposite), D is incorrect, etc.

I think the key is that postcolonialism does consider colonial history, so option C is incorrect and thus is NOT a defining feature. Similarly, postcolonialism does consider global inequality, so option D is also incorrect.

But the question is which one is the correct answer. The options are A to I, and I have to choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because the question is which is NOT a defining feature. So the answer is C.
</think>

The question asks which option is NOT a defining feature of postcolonialism in security studies. Postcolonialism is characterized by its focus on the impacts of colonialism, non-European perspectives, and the consideration of global inequalities, among other features. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Postcolonialism does consider economic factors, but it is not primarily defined by this focus. However, it is still a relevant aspect.
- **B**: This is a defining feature as postcolonialism incorporates non-European perspectives.
- **C**: Postcolonialism explicitly examines the influence of colonial history on current security issues. Therefore, this option is incorrect and does not represent a defining feature.
- **D**: Postcolonialism does consider global inequality, making this option incorrect as well.
- **E**: This could be a defining feature as postcolonialism often considers communities alongside nations.
- **F**: Focus on violence is a defining feature, as it critiques the use of violence in colonial and contemporary contexts.
- **G**: This is not a defining feature, as postcolonialism does not specifically focus on bilateral issues.
- **H**: Postcolonialism considers cultural factors, so this is incorrect.
- **I**: This is a defining feature as postcolonialism addresses small wars and asymmetric conflicts.

Among the options, **C** is the clearest example of something that is NOT a defining feature of postcolonialism, as it directly contradicts the perspective's focus on colonial history.

Answer: C
