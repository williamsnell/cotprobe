Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which of the given people wasn't alive in the 20th century. The options are A: Sigmund Freud, B: Ulysses S. Grant, C: Mark Twain, and D: Thomas Edison. 

First, I should probably break down each person's lifespan to see when they lived. The 20th century runs from 1901 to 2000, right? So I need to check if each person was alive during that time or not.

Starting with option A: Sigmund Freud. I remember he was a famous psychologist and the founder of psychoanalysis. I think he was born in the late 19th century and died in the mid-20th. Let me try to recall the exact years. I believe he was born in 1856 and died in 1939. So he was alive in the early 20th century, at least until 1939. That means he was definitely alive during part of the 20th century.

Next, option B: Ulysses S. Grant. He was the 18th President of the United States, I think. He served from 1869 to 1877. But when did he live? I recall that he was born in 1822 and died in 1885. So he died before the 20th century even began. Therefore, he wasn't alive during the 20th century.

Option C: Mark Twain. He's a well-known author, famous for "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn." I think he was born in the early 19th century and died in the early 20th. Let me check: he was born in 1835 and died in 1910. So he was alive during the early years of the 20th century, until 1910. That means he was alive during part of the 20th century.

Option D: Thomas Edison. He's the inventor of the phonograph and the practical electric light bulb, among other things. I think he was born in 1847 and died in 1931. So he was alive from the late 19th century through the early 20th, up until 1931. That definitely places him in the 20th century as well.

So, putting it all together: 

- Sigmund Freud: alive in the 20th century (1856-1939).
- Ulysses S. Grant: died in 1885, so not alive in the 20th century.
- Mark Twain: alive until 1910, so part of the 20th century.
- Thomas Edison: alive until 1931, so in the 20th century.

Therefore, the person who wasn't alive in the 20th century is Ulysses S. Grant, which is option B.
