Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The setup is a proton that's accelerated from rest through a potential difference V, moving in the +z direction. Then it enters a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. But despite these fields, the proton's trajectory isn't affected. Now, if the potential difference is doubled to 2V, what happens to the proton's deflection?

Hmm. I remember that when a charged particle moves through electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force comes into play. The force is given by F = q(E + v × B). For the proton to not be deflected, the net force must be zero. So, the electric force and the magnetic force must cancel each other out.

Let me break it down. The proton is moving in the +z direction. The electric field is in +x, and the magnetic field is in +y.

First, when the proton is accelerated through potential V, it gains kinetic energy. The velocity can be found using the kinetic energy equation: (1/2)mv² = qV. So, v = sqrt(2qV/m). Since the proton has charge +e, V will determine its speed.

Now, the forces on the proton as it moves into the fields. The electric force is F_e = qE in the +x direction. The magnetic force is F_m = q(v × B). Since v is +z and B is +y, their cross product v × B would be in the direction perpendicular to both. Let me recall the right-hand rule: z cross y is... Let's see, the cross product of z and y. The unit vectors are i (x), j (y), k (z). So, j × k = i, wait no, the cross product is determined by the order. The right-hand rule for z cross y: point fingers along z (up), then curl towards y (left, since y is left in standard axes). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of i, j, k. The cross product of k (z) and j (y) is i? Wait, no, the cross product j × k is i, because j is y, k is z, and their cross product is along x. But wait, wait, the cross product is (v × B), so v is along +z (k), B is along +y (j). The cross product k × j is... Let me think, the order matters. Using the right-hand rule: point index along k (z), middle along j (y). The cross product k × j would be -i (negative x direction) because j × k is i, so k × j is -i. So F_m would be q(v × B) = e * v * B in the -x direction.

So F_e is +x, F_m is -x. For no deflection, these must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So eE = e(vB) → E = vB. So that's the condition for no deflection initially.

Now, when the potential is doubled to 2V, the velocity changes. The kinetic energy becomes (1/2)mv'^2 = e*(2V) → v' = sqrt(4eV/m) = 2*sqrt(eV/m) = 2v. So velocity doubles.

Now, let's compute the new forces. F_e remains the same because E is the same. F_e = eE.

The magnetic force F_m' = e(v') × B. Since v' is still along +z, and B is +y, the cross product v' × B is the same direction as before. So direction is -x. The magnitude is e*v'*B = e*(2v)*B = 2e(vB) = 2*(eBv) = 2F_m_initial.

Wait, but initially, F_e = eE = e(vB) (since E = vB). So F_e_initial = e(vB) = F_m_initial (but opposite direction). Now, when velocity doubles, F_m' = 2e(vB) = 2F_e_initial.

So F_e is eE = e(vB) = F_f_initial. Now, F_m' is 2e(vB) = 2F_e_initial.

So the new forces are F_e = eE = e(vB) = F_initial, and F_m' = 2e(vB) = 2F_initial. But direction-wise, F_e is +x, F_m' is -x.

So net force F_net = F_e + F_m' = eE - 2e(vB). But since E = vB, eE = e(vB), so F_net = e(vB) - 2e(vB) = -e(vB).

So the net force is in the -x direction, magnitude e(vB).

This means the proton will experience a net force in the -x direction, causing it to deflect in that direction. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is deflected in the -x direction, and option D is +x. Oh wait, but let me think again.

Wait, when velocity doubles, the magnetic force becomes twice as strong as before. Since the electric force was E = vB, now the magnetic force is 2v B. So the magnetic force is now twice the initial F_m, which was equal in magnitude to F_e. So F_e is eE = e(vB) = F_m_initial. So now F_m' = 2e(vB). So the net force is F_net = F_e (e(vB)) - F_m' (2e(vB)) = -e(vB). So direction is -x.

So the proton will experience a net force in the -x direction, leading to deflection in that direction. So the answer should be option C: deflected in the -x direction.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option C is deflected in the -x direction. So that's the choice.

The proton is initially accelerated through a potential difference \( V \), giving it a velocity \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} \). Upon entering the region with electric field \( E \) in the \( +x \)-direction and magnetic field \( B \) in the \( +y \)-direction, the Lorentz force determines its trajectory. The forces are:

- **Electric force**: \( F_E = qE \) in the \( +x \)-direction.
- **Magnetic force**: \( F_B = q(v \times B) \). Using the right-hand rule, \( v \) (along \( +z \)) and \( B \) (along \( +y \)) result in \( v \times B \) pointing in the \( -x \)-direction, so \( F_B = qvB \) in the \( -x \)-direction.

For no deflection, the forces must cancel: \( F_E = F_B \), implying \( E = vB \).

When the potential is doubled to \( 2V \), the velocity doubles (\( v' = 2v \)) due to increased kinetic energy. The new forces are:

- **Electric force**: \( F_E' = qE \) (unchanged).
- **Magnetic force**: \( F_B' = q(v' \times B) = q(2vB) \), which is twice the initial magnetic force.

The net force is now \( F_{\text{net}} = F_E' - F_B' = qE - 2qvB \). Substituting \( E = vB \), \( F_{\text{net}} = q(vB) - 2q(vB) = -q(vB) \), pointing in the \( -x \)-direction. Thus, the proton is deflected in the \( -x \)-direction.
