Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about presidential elections since 1972 is the most accurate. The options are A through G, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I know.

Option A says voters increasingly vote based on a party's platform. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I remember that in the past, party loyalty was a big factor, but maybe it's changed. People might now focus more on issues or the candidate themselves rather than the party's platform. So I'm not certain if A is correct.

Option B suggests voters increasingly vote based on a candidate's gender. I don't think this is a major factor. While gender can sometimes influence votes, especially in certain contexts, it's probably not the main reason people choose a candidate. So B might not be the best choice.

Option C claims voters have become less interested in politics. I don't think that's true. In fact, with more information available and more political coverage, maybe people are more interested now. Plus, things like social media have made politics more accessible, so C might not be accurate.

Option D states voters increasingly vote based on a candidate's personal life. This makes sense because personal scandals or behaviors can affect a candidate's image. For example, issues like Bill Clinton's affair or Donald Trump's tweets could influence voters. So D could be a good option.

Option E says elections have become less competitive. I think in the US, the two-party system has made elections sometimes very competitive, especially in recent decades. While some states are more one-sided, the overall competitiveness hasn't necessarily decreased. So E might not be correct.

Option F suggests voters increasingly get their information from newspapers. I don't think so. With the rise of the internet and social media, newspapers are less of a primary source for news. So F is probably not the right answer.

Option G claims voters have become more focused on individual candidates. This seems plausible. People might pay more attention to candidates' policies, personalities, and backgrounds rather than just party lines. So G could be accurate.

Now, comparing D and G. D is about personal life influencing votes, while G is about focusing on individual candidates. Since the question is about trends since 1972, I think the shift towards focusing on individual candidates rather than parties is a notable trend. Also, while personal life does matter, the broader trend is that voters are more candidate-focused.

So I'm leaning towards option E being incorrect because elections can still be competitive. Option G seems more accurate because voters are more likely to base their decisions on the candidate's qualities rather than just the party's platform or other factors like gender.

The most accurate statement is that voters have become more focused on individual candidates. 

Answer: G
