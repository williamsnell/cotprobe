Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) is a field. The options are given from A to J, which correspond to numbers like 4, -1, 0, etc. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Z_3 is the ring of integers modulo 3, so c can be 0, 1, or 2 in Z_3. Wait, the options include numbers beyond that, but wait—maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no, actually, the options are numbers, but since we're working in Z_3, the coefficients are modulo 3. So, for example, option B is -1, which is equivalent to 2 in Z_3, right? Because -1 mod 3 is 2.

So, my first thought is that for the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(f(x)) to be a field, f(x) must be an irreducible polynomial over Z_3. Because in a finite field, the quotient ring by a maximal ideal is a field, and for polynomials over a field, irreducible polynomials generate maximal ideals. So, to get a field, the polynomial x^3 + c x^2 + 1 must be irreducible over Z_3.

Alright, so I need to check for which c in Z_3 the polynomial is irreducible. Since it's a cubic, it's irreducible over Z_3 if it has no roots in Z_3. Because if it had a root, say a in Z_3, then (x - a) would be a factor, making the polynomial reducible. So, I can check for each possible c whether the polynomial has any roots in Z_3.

Wait, but c is in Z_3, so c can be 0, 1, or 2. Let me list each possible c and then the corresponding polynomial, and then check for roots.

Let's go through each possible c:

Case 1: c = 0
Polynomial: x^3 + 1
Check if it has roots in Z_3.
Plug in x=0: 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0 mod 3
x=1: 1 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0
x=2: 8 +1=9 mod3=0 → Oh, x=2 is a root. So this polynomial factors as (x-2)(quadratic). So it's reducible. So c=0 is out.

Case 2: c = 1
Polynomial: x^3 + x^2 + 1
Check for roots:
x=0: 0 +0 +1=1≠0
x=1:1 +1 +1=3≡0 mod3. So x=1 is a root. Therefore, the polynomial factors as (x-1)(quadratic), so it's reducible. So c=1 is out.

Case 3: c=2
Polynomial: x^3 + 2x^2 + 1
Check for roots:
x=0:0 +0 +1=1≠0
x=1:1 +2 +1=4 mod3=1≠0
x=2:8 + 8 +1=17 mod3=2≠0
Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. Wait, in Z_3, x=2 is 2, so:

x=2: (2)^3 + 2*(2)^2 +1 = 8 + 8 +1 = 17. 17 mod3 is 2, because 3*5=15, 17-15=2. So 2≠0 mod3.

So for c=2, the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 +1 has no roots in Z_3. Therefore, it's irreducible, and the quotient ring is a field.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes a cubic without roots can still factor into a product of a linear and quadratic, but only if it has a root. So if it has no roots, it's irreducible. So yes, c=2 is the only one that works.

Wait, but wait another thing: Are there other possibilities? Wait, the options given include numbers beyond 0,1,2, like 4, -1, etc. But since we're in Z_3, c must be 0,1,2. So I think the answer is c=2, which corresponds to option I (since options are I:2).

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A:4
B:-1
C:0
D:1
E:-3
F:6
G:5
H:-2
I:2
J:3

So in Z_3, 4 is equivalent to 1 (since 4 mod3 is 1), -1 is 2, 0 is 0, 1 is 1, -3 is 0, 6 is 0, 5 is 2, -2 is 1, 2 is 2, 3 is 0.

Wait, so in the question, it's asking for c in Z_3, so the possible c's are 0,1,2. So the options that correspond to these are:

c=0: options C, E, F, J (since 3 is 0 mod3)
c=1: options A (4 mod3=1), D (1), H (-2 mod3=1)
c=2: options B (-1 mod3=2), I (2), G (5 mod3=2)

But wait, in my analysis, only c=2 makes the polynomial irreducible. So the valid c's are 2, which in the options are B (-1), I (2), G (5). Wait, but wait: 5 mod3 is 2, so c=5 is equivalent to c=2 in Z_3. Similarly, -1 mod3 is 2, and 2 is 2. So the possible options would be B, I, and G. But the question says "find all c in Z_3", so the answer would be c=2, but in the options, the c's are represented as 2, which is option I.

Wait, but wait again: the problem says "find all c in Z_3", so the possible c's are 0,1,2. But in the options, numbers like 4, -1, etc., are given, but we need to take their equivalence mod3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each c as per the options.

Wait, the problem is asking for c in Z_3, so c can be 0,1,2. But the options are given as integers, so perhaps the correct c's are those whose mod3 is 0,1,2. So in the options, the numbers that are 0,1,2 mod3 are:

A:4 →1

B:-1→2

C:0→0

D:1→1

E:-3→0

F:6→0

G:5→2

H:-2→1

I:2→2

J:3→0

So the possible c's are 0,1,2 in Z_3, which correspond to options C, D, H, etc., but wait, no—each option is a specific integer, but when taken mod3, they become 0,1,2.

Wait, but the question is to find c in Z_3, so c is 0,1,2. Thus, the options that correspond to c=2 are B (-1), G (5), I (2), because all these are ≡2 mod3.

But earlier, I found that only c=2 makes the polynomial irreducible. So the correct c's are those that are 2 mod3, so options B, G, I.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought only c=2 works. So perhaps the answer includes all options where c ≡2 mod3. Let me check that.

Wait, let me make a table:

For each option (c_val), compute c = c_val mod3, then check if x^3 + c x^2 +1 is irreducible over Z_3.

Option A:4 → c=1

Polynomial: x^3 + x^2 +1.

Check roots:

x=0:1≠0

x=1:1+1+1=3≡0 → has root. So reducible.

Option B:-1 →c=2

Polynomial:x^3 +2x^2 +1

Check roots:

x=0→1≠0

x=1→1 +2 +1=4≡1≠0

x=2→8 +8 +1=17≡2≠0

No roots. So it's irreducible. So option B is good.

Option C:0→c=0

Polynomial:x^3 +1

x=2→8+1=9≡0 → reducible. So C is out.

Option D:1→c=1

Same as option A. Reducible. So D is out.

Option E:-3→c=0

Same as C. Reducible. Out.

Option F:6→c=0

Same as C. Reducible. Out.

Option G:5→c=2

Same as option B. So polynomial is irreducible. So G is good.

Option H:-2→c=1

Same as A and D. Reducible. Out.

Option I:2→c=2

Same as B and G. Irreducible. Good.

Option J:3→c=0

Same as C, E, F. Reducible. Out.

So, the options that result in the polynomial being irreducible are B, G, I.

Wait, but the question says "find all c in Z_3". So in Z_3, c can be 0,1,2. But only c=2 makes the polynomial irreducible. So the correct c's are those where c ≡2 mod3, so options B (-1), G (5), I (2). But looking back at the options, each corresponds to a value, so perhaps the answer expects all such c in Z_3, so the correct ones are B, G, I. But the options are given as single letters, so perhaps the answer is option I, which is 2, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem is to find all c in Z_3 such that the quotient ring is a field. So c must be 2 in Z_3. So the answer is c=2, which is option I.

Wait, but earlier I thought that options B (-1), G (5), and I (2) all correspond to c=2 mod3, so all these options would work. But the question is to select all such c in Z_3. So perhaps the answer includes all these options. But the way the question is phrased, it says "selecting from the answer A through to J", but it's a multiple-choice question where each option is a single value, so perhaps the correct answer is the one where c=2, which is option I. Alternatively, if the answer expects all possible c's, then it's multiple options, but the way the question is structured, I think it's asking for all c in Z_3 that satisfy the condition, so the answer would include all c ≡2 mod3, which are options B, G, I.

But looking back, the initial analysis was that c must be 2 in Z_3, so the correct answer is c=2, which is option I. But I'm a bit confused because the options include multiple c's that are equivalent to 2 mod3. But the problem says "find all c in Z_3", so perhaps each of these options is a possible answer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is just option I, as it's the direct representation of 2 in Z_3.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects only one answer. Let me think again: for each c in Z_3, we check if the polynomial is irreducible. Only when c=2 is the polynomial irreducible. So the answer is c=2, which is option I. So the correct answer is option I.

To determine which values of \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) make \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) \) a field, we need the polynomial \( x^3 + cx^2 + 1 \) to be irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). A cubic polynomial over a field is irreducible if it has no roots in the field. We evaluate the polynomial for each \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) (i.e., \( c = 0, 1, 2 \)) and check for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

1. **For \( c = 0 \):**  
   Polynomial: \( x^3 + 1 \)  
   - \( x = 0 \): \( 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 1 + 1 = 2 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 2 \): \( 8 + 1 = 9 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)  
   **Root at \( x = 2 \)**; polynomial is reducible.

2. **For \( c = 1 \):**  
   Polynomial: \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \)  
   - \( x = 0 \): \( 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)  
   **Root at \( x = 1 \)**; polynomial is reducible.

3. **For \( c = 2 \):**  
   Polynomial: \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \)  
   - \( x = 0 \): \( 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \)  
   - \( x = 2 \): \( 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \equiv 2 \mod 3 \)  
   **No roots**; polynomial is irreducible.

Thus, the polynomial \( x^3 + cx^2 + 1 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) only when \( c = 2 \). In the given options, \( c = 2 \) corresponds to **option I**.
