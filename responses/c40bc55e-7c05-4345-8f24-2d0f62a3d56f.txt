Question:

A land development company was the owner of a400-acre tract of land in the Great Lakes region. Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that "the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. "After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor  land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. "At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?

Options:

A: Easement appurtenant.
B: Fee simple subject to executory limitation.
C: Leasehold estate.
D: Fee simple absolute.
E: Remainder interest.
F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.
G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
H: Fee simple determinable.
I: Life estate pur autre vie.
J: Fee simple defeasible.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step. 

So, there's a land development company that owns a 400-acre tract in the Great Lakes region. They developed two subdivisions: Eastern and Western, each 150 acres. Each subdivision was created by separate plats, but the restrictions are almost the same. The deeds for these subdivisions have a restriction that the land can only be used for single-family dwellings, and it's supposed to run with the land, binding all lot owners, heirs, and assigns.

Now, after selling most of the lots, the company sells 50 acres to a country club. The deed to the country club has some specific provisions. Let me look at those:

1. The property is restricted to being used as a country club with specific amenities like a golf course, pool, etc.
2. It can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the Eastern development, and then used according to the same restrictions as the Eastern development.
3. The restrictions are covenants running with the land, and if there's a breach, the grantor (land company) can re-enter and terminate the estate.

The question is asking what kind of interest the country club has in the 50-acre tract.

Hmm, the options are various estates and interests like fee simple, leasehold, easement, etc.

Let me recall the types of estates. A fee simple absolute is the most complete ownership, with no conditions. A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent has a possibility of reverter if a condition is broken. A fee simple determinable automatically ends if a condition occurs. An executory interest is when a future interest cuts short another estate. 

In this case, the deed says that if there's a breach, the land company can re-enter and terminate the estate. That sounds like a condition subsequent because the estate doesn't automatically end; instead, the grantor has the option to take back the land if the condition (breach) occurs. So that would be a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. 

Wait, but the deed also allows the country club to subdivide and use the land as a residential subdivision with the same restrictions. So, the country club isn't just getting a one-time use as a country club; they have some future use options. But that doesn't change the type of estate they have. The main point is the re-entry clause upon breach.

So, the country club's interest is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the land company can terminate it if the country club breaches any covenant. That would be option G.

The country club's interest is best described as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the grantor retains the right to re-enter and terminate the estate upon breach of the covenant. 

Answer: G
