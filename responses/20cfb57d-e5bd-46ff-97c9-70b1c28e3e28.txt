Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"But you, my dear Pangloss," said Candide, "how can it be that I behold you again?"
"It is true," said Pangloss, "that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us."
"Well, my dear Pangloss," said Candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"
"I am still of my first opinion," answered Pangloss, "for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."
Voltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Voltaire's Candide. Let me read through the passage again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question is about the phrase "the concatenation of universal events" that brought the men together on the ship. The options are A through J, each representing a different 18th-century fondness or tendency.

From the passage, Candide and Pangloss are on a galley ship, and Pangloss explains how he ended up there after being hanged, dissected, and whipped. He mentions that the "concatenation of universal events" brought them together. Pangloss is a philosopher, and he's still holding onto his optimistic views despite all the terrible things that happened to him. He references Leibniz, talking about pre-established harmony, plenum, and materia subtilis. These are philosophical terms associated with the idea that everything happens for the best in the universe, part of the Enlightenment thinking.

The question is asking what the 18th-century fondness illustrated by this concatenation is. So I need to figure out which option aligns with the Enlightenment's perspective, especially as Voltaire is known for satirizing certain Enlightenment ideas, particularly the optimism of Leibniz.

Looking at the options:

A: Demonstrating the unpredictability and randomness of life. This seems more like a modern existentialist idea, not necessarily the 18th-century focus.

B: Promoting the idea of a divine plan or preordained destiny. That's more of a religious concept, but the Enlightenment was more about reason and less about divine intervention.

C: Using complex language to obfuscate harsh living conditions. Well, Voltaire does use satire, but the passage here is more about Pangloss's philosophical optimism, not really about obfuscation.

D: Using the maritime setting as a metaphor for human existence. While the setting might be used metaphorically, the question is about the 18th-century fondness, which is more about the philosophical ideas they held, not the setting itself.

E: Using satire to critique social and religious institutions. While Voltaire does use satire, the specific mention here is about the concatenation of events, which ties into a broader Enlightenment idea, not just satire.

F: Using cause-and-effect to systematize human behavior. This seems related to Enlightenment thinking, which was big on cause and effect, rational systems, and understanding the world through reason. The idea that events are connected in a chain (concatenation) suggests a systematic view.

G: Demonstrating high social status through vocabulary. That's more about style than the broader philosophical idea.

H: Mocking philosophical theories through absurd scenarios. Again, Voltaire does mock, but the question is about what the concatenation illustrates as the 18th-century fondness, which would be their approach to understanding events, not just mocking.

I: Exploiting naval power. Not really relevant here; the passage isn't about naval power but about the events bringing people together.

J: Drawing universal conclusions from data. This relates to the scientific method and Enlightenment's empirical approach, but the specific term "concatenation" seems more about cause and effect in a philosophical sense.

Putting it together, the idea of events being connected in a chain (concatenation) and the Enlightenment's emphasis on rational systems and cause-and-effect would align with option F. Voltaire is illustrating how events are linked, which reflects the Enlightenment's fondness for systematizing understanding through cause-and-effect.

The passage highlights the Enlightenment's emphasis on cause-and-effect and rational systems, as seen through the "concatenation of universal events." Voltaire uses this concept to critique the optimism of philosophers like Pangloss, who adhere to Leibniz's ideas despite life's harsh realities. This reflects the 18th-century fondness for understanding events through systematic and rational connections.

Answer: F
