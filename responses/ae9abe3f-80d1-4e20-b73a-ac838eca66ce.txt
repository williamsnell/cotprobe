Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a toy car and a truck colliding. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned in class. The question says the truck's mass is double the car's mass. They want to know how the acceleration of the car compares to the truck's during the collision.

Wait, Newton's second law says F equals mass times acceleration, right? So F = ma. And when two objects collide, the force they exert on each other should be equal and opposite, according to Newton's third law. So the truck and the car exert the same force but in opposite directions.

Let me think. Let's call the mass of the car m. Then the truck's mass is 2m. The force on both would be the same in magnitude but opposite in direction because of the third law. So for the car, F = m * a_car. For the truck, F = 2m * a_truck.

But wait, the forces are the same magnitude but opposite directions. So F on car is equal in magnitude to F on truck but opposite. So m * a_car = 2m * a_truck. Wait, no, because the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite direction. So actually, F_car = -F_truck. But in terms of magnitude, they're equal.

So |F_car| = |F_truck|. So m * a_car = 2m * a_truck. So if I simplify that, a_car = 2 * a_truck. So the car's acceleration is twice that of the truck. But wait, are they in the same or opposite directions?

Because the forces are opposite, the accelerations would be in opposite directions too. Because acceleration is force divided by mass, and force is in opposite directions. So a_car is in the opposite direction compared to a_truck.

Wait, no, let me think again. When the truck hits the car, the truck accelerates in one direction, and the car accelerates in the opposite direction. So if the truck's acceleration is a, the car's is -2a? Or wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Suppose the force F is the same magnitude on both. So for the car: F = m * a_car. For the truck: F = 2m * a_truck. But since the force on the car is in the opposite direction, F_car = -F_truck. So m * a_car = - (2m * a_truck). So a_car = -2 a_truck. So the acceleration of the car is twice as big as the truck's, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but the question is asking how the acceleration of the car compares to the truck. So the car's acceleration is two times the magnitude but in the opposite direction. So looking at the options, option F says "double the magnitude and in the opposite direction." Option B is half the magnitude and opposite, which would be if the car's acceleration was a_truck / 2, but that's not the case here.

Another way: since the truck is more massive, it accelerates less. So for the same force, the car, being less massive, accelerates more. So the car's acceleration is larger in magnitude than the truck's. So the car's acceleration is double the truck's, but in the opposite direction because the force is opposite.

So the correct answer should be option F: double the magnitude and in the opposite direction.

The problem involves two colliding objects, a toy car and a toy truck, where the truck's mass is double the car's mass. To determine the relationship between their accelerations during the collision, we apply Newton's second and third laws.

Using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), and knowing that the forces between the two objects are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (Newton's third law), we set up the equations:

\[
F = m \cdot a_{\text{car}} \quad \text{and} \quad F = 2m \cdot a_{\text{truck}}
\]

Since the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, \( F_{\text{car}} = -F_{\text{truck}} \). This leads to:

\[
m \cdot a_{\text{car}} = -2m \cdot a_{\text{truck}}
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
a_{\text{car}} = -2 \cdot a_{\text{truck}}
\]

This indicates that the car's acceleration is twice the magnitude of the truck's acceleration and in the opposite direction. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**F: double the magnitude and in the opposite direction**

Answer: F
