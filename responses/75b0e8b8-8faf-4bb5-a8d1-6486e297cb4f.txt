Okay, so I have this question about a Chord-based distributed hash table (DHT) in a peer-to-peer network. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

The question says there's a DHT with a 25-node address space. That probably means the node IDs range from 0 to 24, right? Because 25 addresses would be 0 to 24 inclusive. So each node has a unique ID in that range.

Currently, there are 5 active peers with node IDs N3, N8, N15, N19, and N30. Wait, hold on. N30 is beyond 24 since the address space is 25. That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant N30 as a node ID, but that's outside the 24 limit. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps the address space is 30, but the question says 25. So perhaps N30 is a mistake. Or perhaps the address space is 30, but the question says 25. Wait, the question says 25 address space, so node IDs go up to 24. So N30 must be a typo. Maybe it's N20 or something else? Or maybe the address space is 30, but the question says 25. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the node IDs can be beyond the address space, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the node IDs are in the range 0 to 24, and N30 is a typo. Let me proceed, assuming it's a typo and perhaps N30 is actually N20, but I'm not sure. I'll have to proceed with the given information.

The question asks for the target keys (in ascending order, ignoring the node's identifier itself) for N3. So, each node in Chord is responsible for certain keys. The target keys are the keys that a node is responsible for storing. In Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys, and the number of keys each node handles depends on the total number of nodes and the number of keys. Wait, no, Chord uses consistent hashing, so each key is assigned to a node based on the key's hash modulo the number of nodes. But I think in Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys from its own ID to the next node's ID in a circular manner.

Wait, let me think again. In a Chord ring, each node is responsible for a segment of the hash space. The segments are determined by the number of nodes. So if there are M nodes, each node is responsible for M keys, right? Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Chord uses a number of buckets, and each node is responsible for a certain number of consecutive keys. So the total number of keys is M, and each node is responsible for K keys, where K is typically the square root of M, but in this case, it's a 25-node space, so maybe K is 5, since 5^2 is 25. Hmm, but wait, the number of active peers is 5, not 25. So perhaps the address space is 25, but only 5 nodes are active. So each node is responsible for a larger number of keys.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify. In Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys. The total number of keys is equal to the number of nodes in the system. Wait no, that's not right. The number of keys can be larger than the number of nodes. Each node is responsible for a range of keys. So the number of keys each node handles is determined by the total number of keys divided by the number of nodes. But in this question, it's a 25 address space, so perhaps there are 25 possible keys, each assigned to a node. But that doesn't make sense because with 5 active nodes, each node would be responsible for 5 keys.

Wait, maybe the address space refers to the number of possible node IDs, not the number of keys. So there are 25 possible node IDs (0-24), but only 5 are active. So each active node is responsible for a range of keys. The way Chord works is that each key is mapped to a node using the key's hash. The key is assigned to the node with the smallest ID that is greater than or equal to the key's hash. If there's no such node, it wraps around to the smallest node.

So, for each node, the target keys are the keys that fall into the range from the node's ID up to the next node's ID in the ring. But since the ring is circular, if a node is the largest ID, its range wraps around to the smallest node.

So, given that, let's list the active nodes: N3, N8, N15, N19, N30. Wait, N30 is beyond 24. So that's a problem. Maybe it's a typo, and it's N20 or N24. Let's assume it's N20 for now, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the correct node IDs are N3, N8, N15, N19, and N24. That would make sense because 24 is the maximum with 25 address space.

So, let's proceed with the assumption that the active nodes are N3, N8, N15, N19, and N24. Now, let's arrange them in order: 3, 8, 15, 19, 24.

Now, the nodes are arranged in a circular ring. So the next node after 24 would be 3.

Each node is responsible for the keys from its ID up to, but not including, the next node's ID. So for N3, the next node is N8. So N3's range is from 3 (inclusive) to 8 (exclusive). So the keys in this range are 3,4,5,6,7. That's five keys.

Wait, but the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself. So for N3, the target keys are the keys in the range [3,8), which includes 3,4,5,6,7. But since we ignore the node's ID (3), the target keys would be 4,5,6,7. But that's only four keys. Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the target keys include the node's ID as well. Wait, the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself, so the target keys would be the keys in the range excluding the node's own ID. So for N3, the keys are 4,5,6,7.

But looking at the options, none of them have [4,5,6,7]. The options are A to J. Let's see what each option is:

A: [6, 11, 16, 21, 1]
B: [5, 8, 12, 18, 24]
C: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
D: [4,5,7,11,19]
E: [7,14,21,28,2]
F: [4,6,9,17,22]
G: [4,9,16,20,25]
H: [3,8,15,19,30]
I: [8,15,19,30,3]
J: [5,10,15,20,25]

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the target keys are determined. Let me think again. In Chord, each node is responsible for the keys that are in the range from its own ID up to the next node's ID. So for N3, the next node is N8. So the keys are 3,4,5,6,7. But we are to ignore the node's own ID (3), so the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys, and each node is responsible for five keys in this setup (since 25 keys divided by 5 nodes is 5 per node). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are determined by the number of bits in the address space. Wait, 25 is not a power of two. So maybe the address space is 32 bits, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the number of keys each node is responsible for is the ceiling of 25/5, which is 5.

Wait, perhaps the way it's calculated is that each node is responsible for a certain number of consecutive keys, and the target keys for N3 would be the keys in its range, excluding its own ID. So let's list the ranges:

Nodes in order: 3,8,15,19,24.

- N3: 3 <= key < 8 → keys 3,4,5,6,7. Exclude 3 → 4,5,6,7.

But that's four keys, but each node should have five keys. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the address space is 30, not 25. Because the node IDs go up to 30. But the question says 25 address space. So perhaps the address space is 30, and the number of nodes is 5. So each node is responsible for 6 keys (30/5=6). Let me try that approach.

If the address space is 30, and node IDs are 0-29, but we have 5 active nodes: 3,8,15,19,30. Wait, 30 is beyond 29, so that can't be. So perhaps the address space is 30, or maybe it's a typo and the address space is 30. Alternatively, perhaps the node IDs are 0-24 (25 nodes), but the active nodes are 3,8,15,19,24. So that makes sense.

So, each node is responsible for 5 keys (25 keys /5 nodes=5 each). So for N3, the range is from 3 to 8 (exclusive), which is 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key. Wait, maybe the address space is 30, so 0-29, and there are 5 nodes. So 30/5=6 keys per node.

In that case, the nodes are 3,8,15,19,30. Wait, 30 is beyond 29, so that can't be. So perhaps the node IDs are 3,8,15,19,24. So arranged in order: 3,8,15,19,24.

Each node is responsible for 5 keys. So N3's range is 3 <= key <8 → 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys. Hmm, maybe the target keys include the next node's ID minus one. Wait, perhaps I should consider that each node is responsible for a range of K keys, where K is the number of keys per node. So with 25 keys and 5 nodes, K=5. So each node is responsible for 5 keys.

So N3's range is from 3 to 3+5=8. So keys 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. Still four keys. That's a problem because each node should have five target keys.

Wait, perhaps the way it's calculated is that the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to store, which are the keys in its range. So including its own ID. So for N3, the target keys would be 3,4,5,6,7. But the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself, so we exclude 3, leaving 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys, which doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are determined by the number of bits in the address space. For example, if the address space is 25, which is 5 bits (since 2^5=32), then each node is responsible for 2^(n-1) keys, where n is the number of bits. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the target keys for a node in Chord are the keys that are mapped to it using the consistent hashing. So, for each key k, it's mapped to the node with the smallest ID >=k. If no such node exists, it wraps around to the smallest node.

So for N3, the target keys are all keys k where N3 is the successor of k. So, the successor of k is the smallest node ID >=k. So for N3, the keys k where the successor is N3 are those where k >=3 and the next node is N8, which is 8. So the keys in [3,8) would have N3 as their successor. So the keys are 3,4,5,6,7. But the question says to ignore the node's identifier, so we exclude 3, leaving 4,5,6,7.

But again, that's four keys, and the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N3 is supposed to store, which are the keys in its range, but perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, maybe the number of keys each node is responsible for is determined by the number of bits in the node IDs. For example, if the node IDs are 5 bits (0-31), but that's not matching the 25 address space. Alternatively, perhaps the number of keys is equal to the number of nodes, so 5 keys per node.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys in the range [N, N+K), where K is the number of keys per node. For example, if K=5, then N3's range is 3-8, as before. So keys 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7.

But none of the options match this. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: [6,11,16,21,1] → These are spaced 5 apart, but starts at 6. Maybe modulo 25? 21+5=26 → 1, which wraps around. So perhaps these are every 5th key starting from 6. But I'm not sure.

Option B: [5,8,12,18,24] → 5, then 5+3=8, 8+4=12, 12+6=18, 18+6=24. Doesn't seem to follow a pattern.

Option C: [1,2,3,4,5] → These are the first five keys.

Option D: [4,5,7,11,19] → No obvious pattern.

Option E: [7,14,21,28,2] → 7,14,21,28 mod25=3, then 2. Not matching.

Option F: [4,6,9,17,22] → Spaced irregularly.

Option G: [4,9,16,20,25] → 4,9 (diff 5), 16 (diff7), 20 (diff4), 25 (diff5). Doesn't make sense.

Option H: [3,8,15,19,30] → 3,8,15,19,30 mod25=5. So 3,8,15,19,5. Not sorted.

Option I: [8,15,19,30,3] → Same as H, but different order.

Option J: [5,10,15,20,25] → 5,10,15,20,25 mod25=0. So 5,10,15,20,0. Sorted would be 0,5,10,15,20.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the ones that N3 is responsible for, which are the keys in its range [3,8), which are 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys. So perhaps the options are considering including the node's ID, making it five keys, but the question says to ignore it. Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to store, including its own ID, but the question says to ignore it. So perhaps the answer isn't directly matching, but looking at the options, perhaps option A is [6,11,16,21,1], which are spaced 5 apart, starting from 6, and wrapping around at 21+5=26→1.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are determined by the node's ID plus the number of keys per node. If each node is responsible for 5 keys, then starting at N3, the keys would be 3,4,5,6,7. But again, that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are calculated using modular arithmetic. For example, each node is responsible for keys that are congruent to its ID modulo the number of nodes. So with 5 nodes, each node is responsible for keys ≡3 mod5. So keys 3,8,13,18,23. But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, another approach: in Chord, each node has a finger table that points to other nodes. The finger table for node i includes entries for (i + 2^k) mod M, for k from 0 to log2(M). But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that N3 is supposed to store, which are the keys that map to N3. So for each key k, if the node with ID equal to (k mod M) is N3, then N3 is responsible for k. But M is 25, so k mod25 =3. So keys would be 3,28 (3+25), but since the address space is 25, 28 mod25=3. So only key 3 would map to N3. But that can't be right because each node should handle multiple keys.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the target keys are the ones that N3 is supposed to store, which are the keys in its range. So if the active nodes are 3,8,15,19,24, arranged in a circle. So the ranges are:

- 3 to 8: keys 3,4,5,6,7
- 8 to 15: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14
Wait, that's 7 keys. Hmm, perhaps each node is responsible for a certain number of keys. Let's see, 25 keys divided by 5 nodes is 5 keys per node.

So for N3, the range is 3-8, which is 5 keys:3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys. So perhaps the answer isn't matching any options, but perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the node IDs are 3,8,15,19,30, but the address space is 30, not 25. So 0-29. Then each node is responsible for 6 keys (30/5=6). So N3's range is 3-9 (exclusive), which is 3,4,5,6,7,8. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7,8. That's five keys. Do any options match this? Looking at the options:

Option A: [6,11,16,21,1] → No.

Option B: [5,8,12,18,24] → No.

Option C: [1,2,3,4,5] → No.

Option D: [4,5,7,11,19] → No.

Option E: [7,14,21,28,2] → No.

Option F: [4,6,9,17,22] → No.

Option G: [4,9,16,20,25] → No.

Option H: [3,8,15,19,30] → No.

Option I: [8,15,19,30,3] → No.

Option J: [5,10,15,20,25] → No.

Hmm, none of the options match 4,5,6,7,8. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that N3 is supposed to store, which are the keys that are in the range from its ID to the next node's ID, but including the next node's ID. Wait, no, because the next node is N8, so the range is 3<=k<8, which is up to 7.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the ones that N3 is supposed to store, which are the keys that are in the range [N3, next node's ID). So for N3, it's 3<=k<8. So keys 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys, and we need five.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys include the next node's ID. So for N3, the range is 3<=k<=8. So keys 3,4,5,6,7,8. But that's six keys, which is more than five. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the target keys are determined by the number of bits. For example, if the address space is 25, which is 5 bits, then each node is responsible for 2^(n-1) keys, where n is the number of bits. So 2^(5-1)=16 keys per node. But that can't be because 5 nodes *16 keys=80, which is way more than 25.

Alternatively, perhaps each node is responsible for a certain number of consecutive keys. For example, in a 25-node system, each node is responsible for 5 keys. So for N3, the keys are 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But again, that's four keys.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the ones that the node is supposed to store, which are the keys in its range, but the calculation is done differently. For example, if the node IDs are 3,8,15,19,24, then the ranges are:

- 3 <=k <8: 3,4,5,6,7 → 5 keys
- 8 <=k <15: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14 → 7 keys
- 15 <=k <19:15,16,17,18 →4 keys
- 19 <=k <24:19,20,21,22,23 →5 keys
- 24 <=k <3:24,0,1,2 →4 keys

Wait, that doesn't add up to 25 keys. Let's count:5+7+4+5+4=25. Yes. So each node is responsible for the keys in their range:

- N3:3-7 (5 keys)
- N8:8-14 (7 keys)
- N15:15-18 (4 keys)
- N19:19-23 (5 keys)
- N24:24,0,1,2 (4 keys)

So N3's target keys are 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys, and we need five.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys include the node's own ID. So for N3, the target keys are 3,4,5,6,7. So the answer would be [4,5,6,7], but that's four keys, and none of the options match.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option A is [6,11,16,21,1]. Let's see: 6,11,16,21,1. These are spaced 5 apart, starting from 6, then 11=6+5, 16=11+5, 21=16+5, and 21+5=26→1 mod25. So this sequence is every 5th key starting from 6. So perhaps the target keys are every 5th key, starting from the node's ID plus some offset.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are congruent to the node's ID modulo 5. So for N3, keys ≡3 mod5. So 3,8,13,18,23. Ignoring 3, the target keys would be 8,13,18,23. But that's four keys, and the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are in the range [N, N+5), which for N3 would be 3-8, as before. So keys 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7.

But none of the options match this. Let me look at option A again: [6,11,16,21,1]. These are spaced 5 apart, starting at 6. So 6,11,16,21,1. That's five keys. So perhaps the target keys are the node's ID plus 3,8,13,18,23. Wait, no, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are determined by the node's ID plus the number of keys per node, which is 5. So for N3, the keys would be 3,4,5,6,7. Ignoring 3, the target keys are 4,5,6,7. But that's four keys.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for all the target keys in the network, not just N3's. But the question specifically asks for N3's target keys.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option A: [6,11,16,21,1]. Because each key is 5 apart, starting from 6. So maybe the target keys are 6,11,16,21,1. But I'm not sure how that aligns with the node's range.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that N3 is responsible for, which are the keys in its range, but the calculation is done using a different method. For example, in some DHTs, each node is responsible for a certain number of keys, and the target keys are calculated as the node's ID plus a certain offset.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think of the answer based on the options. The only option that has five keys, spaced 5 apart, is option A and option J.

Option J: [5,10,15,20,25]. But 25 is beyond the 24 limit, so perhaps it's 0.

So option J would be [5,10,15,20,0], which are spaced 5 apart.

Alternatively, option A: [6,11,16,21,1]. These are 6,11,16,21,1.

If the address space is 25, then 21+5=26→1.

So perhaps the target keys are every 5th key starting from a certain point. For N3, perhaps the starting point is 3+3=6. So 6,11,16,21,1.

That would make option A the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the ones that are in the range [N +1, N +5), but that would start at 4 for N3.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, I think the most plausible answer is option A: [6,11,16,21,1].

The question involves determining the target keys for node N3 in a Chord-based distributed hash table (DHT) with a 25-node address space and 5 active peers: N3, N8, N15, N19, and N30 (likely a typo, assumed to be N24). Each node is responsible for a range of keys, and the target keys for N3 are those in its range, excluding its own ID.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Node IDs and Ranges**:  
   The active nodes are N3, N8, N15, N19, and N24 (assuming N30 is a typo). These nodes are arranged in ascending order: 3, 8, 15, 19, 24.  
   Each node is responsible for a range of keys from its ID up to, but not including, the next node's ID. For N3, the range is **[3, 8)**, which includes keys 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

2. **Ignoring the Node's ID**:  
   The question specifies to ignore the node's ID itself. Therefore, the target keys for N3 are **4, 5, 6, 7**. However, this results in only four keys, which does not match any of the provided options.

3. **Considering Modular Arithmetic**:  
   The target keys could also be determined using modular arithmetic. For example, keys spaced 5 apart starting from a specific point. Option A ([6, 11, 16, 21, 1]) fits this pattern, as the keys are spaced 5 apart and wrap around modulo 25 (e.g., 21 + 5 = 26 → 1).

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   Among the provided options, **Option A** ([6, 11, 16, 21, 1]) aligns with the idea of keys spaced 5 apart, starting from a point related to N3's ID. This pattern suggests the target keys are every 5th key starting from 6, which could be consistent with the DHT's design.

### Conclusion:
While the direct calculation for N3's target keys results in **[4, 5, 6, 7]**, none of the options match this. Based on the provided options and the pattern in Option A, the most plausible answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
