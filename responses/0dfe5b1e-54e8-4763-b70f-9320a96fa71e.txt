Question:

In an IPv4 datagram, the value of the total-length field is $(00 \mathrm{~A} 0)_{16}$ and the value of the headerlength (HLEN) is (5) $1_{16}$. How many bytes of payload are being carried by the datagram?

Options:

A: 220
B: 240
C: 150
D: 180
E: 100
F: 140
G: 160
H: 200
I: 260
J: 120

Okay, so I have this IPv4 datagram question here, and I need to figure out how many bytes of payload it's carrying. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that an IPv4 datagram has a header and a payload. The header is made up of several fields, and one of them is the total-length field, which tells the total length of the datagram including the header and the payload. Another field is the header length (HLEN), which indicates how long the header is.

The question says the total-length field is (00A0) in hex. I think I need to convert that to decimal to get the total length in bytes. Let me do that. Hexadecimal to decimal conversion: 00A0. A is 10 in decimal. So 00A0 is 0*16^3 + 0*16^2 + 10*16^1 + 0*16^0. That's 0 + 0 + 160 + 0 = 160. So the total length is 160 bytes.

Next, the HLEN is given as 51 in hex. Wait, wait, no, the HLEN is (5)1 in hex? Hmm, maybe I'm misreading that. Oh wait, the value is (5)1_{16}, which I think means 51 in hexadecimal. Wait, no, perhaps it's written as 5 followed by 1, making 51 in hex. Let me confirm: 51 in hex is 5*16 +1 = 80 +1 =81 in decimal. But wait, HLEN is a field that's 4 bits in the header, right? Because in the IPv4 header, the HLEN field is 4 bits, so it can only go up to 15 (since 15 in binary is 1111). So if HLEN is (5)1_{16}, that might be a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps it's written as 5 in hex, which is 5 in decimal. Because 51 in hex would be 81, which is way too big for HLEN, which is 4 bits. So maybe the HLEN is 5 in hex, which is 5 in decimal. Because 5 in hex is 5, and that makes more sense because 5 * 4 = 20 bytes for the header. Wait, wait, HLEN is the number of 4-byte words in the header. So if HLEN is 5, that would be 5 * 4 = 20 bytes. But wait, wait, no: the HLEN field is the number of 32-bit words, each being 4 bytes, so HLEN=5 would mean 5*4=20 bytes for the header. But wait, the IPv4 header is normally 20 bytes. So HLEN is 5 in hex, which is 5 in decimal, making the header length 20 bytes. That seems right.

So, the total length of the datagram is 160 bytes. The header is 20 bytes. So the payload would be the total length minus the header length. So 160 - 20 = 140 bytes.

Let me double-check the calculations. Total length is 00A0 in hex, which is 160. HLEN is 5 in hex, which is 5, so 5*4=20. 160-20=140. So the payload is 140 bytes. Looking at the options, option F is 140.

I think that's the correct answer.

The total length of the datagram is 160 bytes (00A0 in hex). The header length (HLEN) is 5 in hex, which equals 5 in decimal, representing 20 bytes (5 Ã— 4). Subtracting the header length from the total length gives 140 bytes of payload.

Answer: F
