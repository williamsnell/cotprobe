Question:

 Use the following key to translate the given formula of PL to natural, English sentences.
A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.
B: Izzy plays Minecraft.
C: Emily stops working.
D: Russell makes dinner.
E: Ashleigh stops by.
(~B • E) ⊃ D

Options:

A: If it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.
B: If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.
C: Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by entails that Russell makes dinner.
D: Russell's making dinner is a sufficient condition for Izzy not playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by.

Okay, so I've got this logic problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct translation of the given formula into a natural English sentence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the formula provided is (~B • E) ⊃ D. I remember that in logic, the symbols have specific meanings. Let me recall each part:

- ~B means "not B" or "it is not the case that B."
- "•" is the logical conjunction, which translates to "and."
- "⊃" is the implication operator, meaning "if... then..."

So putting it together, the formula is saying: If (not B and E), then D. In other words, if Izzy doesn't play Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by, then Russell makes dinner.

Now, looking at the options given:

Option A says: If it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.
Hmm, wait. That's not exactly right. The formula is ~B and E. So it's about Izzy not playing and Ashleigh stopping, not both happening. Option A seems to be talking about the negation of B and E together, which would be ~(B ∧ E), but the formula is ~B ∧ E. So Option A might be incorrect.

Option B: If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.
This seems similar to what I thought. Let me parse it. "Both not B and E" would be ~B ∧ E, which is exactly what the formula's antecedent is. So the structure is ( ~B ∧ E ) ⊃ D. So Option B is saying that if both ~B and E are true, then D happens. That seems correct.

Option C: Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by entails that Russell makes dinner.
Wait, this seems different. The formula is an implication where the antecedent is ~B and E, not B and E. So if Izzy plays Minecraft (B) and Ashleigh stops (E), then D. But our formula is the opposite in terms of B. So Option C is not matching.

Option D: Russell's making dinner is a sufficient condition for Izzy not playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by.
Hmm, this is about D being a sufficient condition. In logic, the implication is A ⊃ B, where A is the sufficient condition for B. So if D is the consequent, then the sufficient condition is the antecedent. So D being a sufficient condition would mean that if D happens, then the antecedent (~B ∧ E) happens. But our formula is the other way around: if (~B ∧ E), then D. So Option D is actually the converse and is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula is (~B ∧ E) ⊃ D. So the antecedent is ~B ∧ E, and the consequent is D. So the correct translation is that if ~B and E are true, then D is true. So the English sentence would be: If Izzy does not play Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by, then Russell makes dinner.

Looking back at the options, Option B says exactly that: "If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner." So that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it: The implication is (A) ⊃ (B), which is "If A, then B." So in this case, A is (~B ∧ E), and B is D. So the correct translation is "If (~B ∧ E), then D." Which is exactly what Option B states.

So the answer should be Option B.

The formula (~B ∧ E) ⊃ D translates to "If Izzy does not play Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by, then Russell makes dinner." Option B correctly captures this.
