Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about deriving the number average and weight average degree of polymerization. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that degree of polymerization (X) is related to molecular weight. For polymers, the number average molecular weight (M_n) is the sum of the moles of each species multiplied by their molecular weights, divided by the total moles. Similarly, the weight average (M_w) involves the total weight instead of moles.

The question gives the definitions for M_n and M_w. M_n is (ΣN_i M_i) / (ΣN_i), which makes sense because it's like taking each species' contribution by moles. M_w is a bit more complicated: (ΣW_i M_i) / (ΣW_i), but also expressed as (ΣN_i M_i²) / (ΣN_i M_i). Oh right, because W_i is N_i * M_i, so M_w can be rewritten that way.

Now, the problem is asking for similar equations for X_n (number average degree of polymerization) and X_w (weight average). So, I need to think about how X relates to M. Degree of polymerization X is typically the molecular weight divided by the molecular weight of a repeating unit. Let's say the repeating unit has molecular weight m. So, X_i = M_i / m.

But wait, in terms of derivation, I shouldn't get into specifics of m. Instead, I'll treat X_i as a value for each species. So, analogous to M_n and M_w, I need to find X_n and X_w.

Number average degree of polymerization, X_n, should be similar to M_n. So, for M_n, it's the sum of moles times M_i over total moles. So for X_n, it would be sum(N_i X_i) / sum(N_i). That seems straightforward.

For the weight average, X_w, it's like M_w. M_w is sum(W_i M_i) / sum(W_i). But W_i is N_i * M_i, so substituting, M_w becomes sum(N_i M_i²) / sum(N_i M_i). Alternatively, M_w is also expressed as sum(w_i M_i), where w_i is the weight fraction.

Applying this to X_w: X_w should be sum(W_i X_i) / sum(W_i). But let's express it in terms of N_i and X_i. Since W_i = N_i * M_i, and X_i = M_i / m, perhaps we can find another expression. Alternatively, using the same approach as M_w, X_w would be sum(N_i X_i * M_i) / sum(N_i M_i). Wait, but X_i is M_i / m, so substituting that in: sum(N_i (M_i/m) * M_i) / sum(N_i M_i). That simplifies to sum(N_i M_i² / m) / sum(N_i M_i) = (1/m) * [sum(N_i M_i²) / sum(N_i M_i)] = (1/m) * M_w. But since M_w also relates to X via X_w, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to directly write X_w as sum(W_i X_i) / sum(W_i). But since W_i = N_i M_i, and X_i = M_i / m, then W_i X_i = N_i M_i² / m. So X_w = [sum(N_i M_i² / m)] / [sum(N_i M_i)]. The denominator is m times sum(N_i M_i/m) which is m times sum(N_i X_i). Wait, no, because sum(N_i M_i) is m times sum(N_i X_i), because X_i = M_i/m. So sum(N_i M_i) = m sum(N_i X_i). Therefore, X_w = [sum(N_i M_i² / m)] / [m sum(N_i X_i)].

Wait, but M_i^2/m = (m X_i^2). Because X_i = M_i/m → M_i = m X_i → M_i² = m² X_i². So M_i²/m = m X_i². So sum(N_i M_i²/m) = sum(N_i m X_i²) = m sum(N_i X_i²).

Thus, X_w = [m sum(N_i X_i²)] / [m sum(N_i X_i)] → X_w = [sum(N_i X_i²)] / [sum(N_i X_i)].

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Because M_w is sum(N_i M_i²)/sum(N_i M_i) = [sum(N_i (m X_i)^2)] / [sum(N_i m X_i)] = [m² sum(N_i X_i²)] / [m sum(N_i X_i)] = m sum(N_i X_i²) / sum(N_i X_i). So X_w = (X_w for M) / m something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it more directly. Since X is a measure of polymerization, and for M_n and M_w, the expressions are based on N_i and W_i. For X, it's analogous but using X_i instead of M_i.

So, the number average X_n would be sum(N_i X_i) / sum(N_i), similar to M_n. The weight average X_w would be sum(W_i X_i) / sum(W_i), which can also be expressed in terms of N_i and X_i. Since W_i = N_i M_i, and X_i = M_i/m, maybe we can find an alternative expression.

Let me think about expressing X_w in terms of N_i and X_i. So, sum(W_i X_i) = sum(N_i M_i X_i) = sum(N_i M_i (M_i/m)) ) because X_i = M_i/m. So that's sum(N_i M_i² / m). The denominator sum(W_i) is sum(N_i M_i). So X_w = [sum(N_i M_i²/m)] / [sum(N_i M_i)] = [sum(N_i M_i²)]/(m sum(N_i M_i)).

But M_w is [sum(N_i M_i²)]/[sum(N_i M_i)], so X_w = M_w / m. But since M_w is m X_w, that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express X_w in terms of N_i and X_i without M_i.

Wait, another approach: since X_i = M_i/m, then M_i = m X_i. So substituting into the sum for X_w:

sum(W_i X_i) = sum(N_i M_i X_i) = sum(N_i * (m X_i) * X_i) = sum(N_i m X_i²) = m sum(N_i X_i²).

sum(W_i) = sum(N_i M_i) = sum(N_i m X_i) = m sum(N_i X_i).

So X_w = [m sum(N_i X_i²)] / [m sum(N_i X_i)] = [sum(N_i X_i²)] / [sum(N_i X_i)].

So X_w is (sum N_i X_i²)/(sum N_i X_i).

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check which option matches this.

Looking at option A: X_n = sum N_i X_i / sum N_i, and X_w = sum N_i X_i² / sum N_i X_i.

Wait, no, option A says X_w = [sum N_i X_i² / sum N_i X_i]. But according to our derivation, X_w is [sum N_i X_i²]/[sum N_i X_i]. Because the denominator is sum N_i X_i, not sum N_i X_i something else.

Wait, wait, I think my mistake is in the denominator. Let me re-derive.

Wait, X_w = sum(W_i X_i) / sum(W_i).

sum(W_i X_i) = sum(N_i M_i X_i) = sum(N_i M_i (M_i/m)) ) → sum(N_i M_i² / m) = (1/m) sum(N_i M_i²).

sum(W_i) = sum(N_i M_i).

So X_w = [sum(N_i M_i² / m)] / [sum(N_i M_i)] = [sum(N_i M_i²)]/(m sum(N_i M_i)).

But M_w is sum(N_i M_i²)/sum(N_i M_i), so X_w = M_w / m.

But since M_w = m X_w (because M_w = m X_w), wait, that seems circular. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible answer options.

Looking at the options, option A says X_n is sum N_i X_i / sum N_i, which matches what I thought for X_n. For X_w, option A says sum N_i X_i² / sum N_i X_i. Let's see: sum N_i X_i² divided by sum N_i X_i. That would be [sum N_i X_i²] / [sum N_i X_i].

Wait, but from earlier, that's exactly what X_w becomes. Because X_w = [sum N_i X_i²] / [sum N_i X_i].

So option A's X_w is [sum N_i X_i²] / [sum N_i X_i], which matches our derivation.

Looking at other options:

Option E: X_n = sum N_i X_i / sum N_i X_i^2. No, that seems off.

Option H: X_n = sum N_i X_i^2 / sum N_i X_i. No, that's for X_w perhaps.

Option F and others don't match.

Therefore, the correct option is A.

The number average degree of polymerization, \( X_n \), is analogous to the number average molecular weight, \( M_n \), and is given by:

\[
X_n = \frac{\sum N_i X_i}{\sum N_i}
\]

where \( N_i \) is the moles of the \( i \)-th species, and \( X_i \) is the degree of polymerization of the \( i \)-th species.

The weight average degree of polymerization, \( X_w \), is analogous to the weight average molecular weight, \( M_w \), and is given by:

\[
X_w = \frac{\sum W_i X_i}{\sum W_i}
\]

where \( W_i \) is the weight of the \( i \)-th species. Substituting \( W_i = N_i M_i \) and \( X_i = \frac{M_i}{m} \) (where \( m \) is the molecular weight of the repeating unit), we find:

\[
X_w = \frac{\sum N_i M_i X_i}{\sum N_i M_i} = \frac{\sum N_i M_i^2 / m}{\sum N_i M_i} = \frac{\sum N_i X_i^2}{\sum N_i X_i}
\]

Thus, the correct equations for \( X_n \) and \( X_w \) are:

\[
X_n = \frac{\sum N_i X_i}{\sum N_i}, \quad X_w = \frac{\sum N_i X_i^2}{\sum N_i X_i}
\]

These match the expressions in option A.
