Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about price elasticity of demand, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about price elasticity.

Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. If the elasticity is greater than 1, demand is elastic, meaning a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. If it's less than 1, demand is inelastic, meaning the quantity demanded doesn't change much with a price change.

The question is asking which factor makes the price elasticity of demand greater. So I need to think about the factors that affect elasticity.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: The proportion of the good of the consumer's budget is high. I remember that if a good takes up a large portion of a consumer's budget, like housing or food, demand is more elastic. People are more responsive to price changes because it's a significant expense. So this seems correct.

Option B: The number of substitute products is limited. If there are few substitutes, people can't easily switch to another product if the price goes up, so demand would be less elastic. So this would make elasticity lower, not higher. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The product is unique and has no substitutes. Similar to B, if a product is unique, there's no alternative, so demand would be inelastic. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The consumer has a high income. High-income consumers might be less responsive to price changes because the good is a smaller proportion of their income. But wait, sometimes luxury goods can be elastic because they are not necessities. Hmm, maybe this isn't the best option. I'm not sure about D.

Option E: The period of time to respond to a price change is short. If people have less time to adjust, they can't change their behavior much, so elasticity is lower. If time is longer, elasticity increases. So E would make elasticity lower, so E is incorrect.

Option F: The product has a high brand value. This might mean it's more inelastic because people are loyal to the brand, but elasticity could vary. Not sure if this is a standard factor. Maybe not the best answer here.

Option G: The product is perishable. Perishable goods might have more elastic demand because people might delay buying or find alternatives if the price changes. Or maybe not? I'm not too sure about this one. It could go either way.

Option H: The product is a luxury. Luxuries are usually elastic because they're not necessities, so people can delay buying or choose alternatives if the price changes. So H could be correct.

Option I: The product is a necessity. Necessities tend to have inelastic demand because people need them regardless of price changes. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The product has a very low cost. If the good is cheap, the percentage change in price might not affect quantity demanded much because the cost is low. So demand might be inelastic. So J is incorrect.

Now, back to the options. The question is asking when elasticity is greater, so higher elasticity.

From the options, A and H seem plausible. Let me think again. The key factors are the availability of substitutes, the proportion of income, time period, and whether it's a necessity or luxury.

Option A: High proportion of budget. Yes, if the good takes a big part of the budget, a small price change significantly affects the quantity demanded, making demand elastic. So A is correct.

Option H: Luxury goods. They are typically elastic because they're not essential. So H is also correct.

Wait, but the question is which one is correct, so perhaps both A and H are correct. But the options are separate, so I need to choose the one that's correct.

Wait, the question is phrased as "greater if," so which of the options leads to greater elasticity.

Looking back, the textbook factors are:

- If the good is a necessity, elasticity is low (inelastic).

- If the good is a luxury, elasticity is high (elastic).

- If many substitutes are available, elasticity is high.

- If the good is a large proportion of the budget, elasticity is high.

- If the time period is long, elasticity is high.

So in the options:

A: High proportion of budget → elasticity is greater (correct).

H: Luxury → elasticity is greater (correct).

So both A and H seem correct, but looking at the options, the question is which of the options is correct. Wait, but the options are from A to J, and each is a separate choice. So I need to see which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the most correct answer, and maybe more than one could be correct, but since it's a single choice, perhaps both A and H are correct, but I need to pick the one that's an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, the question says "the price elasticity of demand for a product is greater if" which factor is present.

So both A and H would make elasticity greater, but perhaps the options don't have both. So I need to check which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are designed so only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct answer is when the elasticity is higher. So A and H are both correct factors, but in the options given, perhaps only one is presented.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: high proportion → correct.

H: luxury → correct.

So if both A and H are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps in the context of the question, only one is the correct answer. Maybe the question is looking for the most direct factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering H. Let me think: luxury goods are elastic because they are not essential, so a change in price leads to a bigger change in quantity demanded. So H is correct.

So both A and H are correct, but in the options, perhaps only one is present. Let me check the options again.

The options are from A to J, and the answer should be one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and H, but in the options provided, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the options. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A: high proportion → correct.

H: luxury → correct.

So if both are correct, but the question is a single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it's a more common factor taught, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, because luxury goods have more elastic demand than necessities. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the elasticity formula. The formula is percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. So if a good is a large part of the budget, a small price change leads to a large percentage change in quantity demanded, making elasticity higher. So A is correct.

Luxury goods also have elastic demand because they are not essential, so people can delay buying or choose alternatives when prices change. So H is also correct.

But in the options given, perhaps only one of them is present. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: high proportion → correct.

H: luxury → correct.

So both A and H are correct. But since the user is asking for one answer, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is which of the following is correct, and the answer includes both A and H, but the options are presented as separate choices. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A, because it's more directly about the proportion of the budget, which is a key factor.

Wait, but the question is about which option makes elasticity greater. So both A and H are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answers are both A and H. However, since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because luxury goods are more elastic.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact factors. The main factors are:

1. Availability of substitutes: more substitutes → more elastic.

2. Time period: longer time → more elastic.

3. Proportion of income: larger proportion → more elastic.

4. Necessity vs. luxury: necessities are inelastic; luxuries are elastic.

So both A and H are correct factors that increase elasticity.

But in the options, both A and H are present, so perhaps the correct answer is both, but since it's a single-choice, maybe the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering one factor, and the correct answer is A.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because it's more directly related to the budget share, which is a key factor in elasticity.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because luxury goods have elastic demand.

But I'm not entirely sure, but I think both are correct. But since the question is to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the options are presented. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: high proportion → correct.

H: luxury → correct.

So both are correct. But since the question is a single-answer, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because it's a luxury, which is more directly elastic.

Wait, I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is both A and H. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, I'm going to go with A because it's a more straightforward factor taught in basic economics. So the answer is A.

The price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price. Factors that increase elasticity include a high proportion of the good in the consumer's budget, the presence of many substitutes, and the good being a luxury rather than a necessity. Among the options, a high proportion of the budget (Option A) directly impacts elasticity because a small price change leads to a significant percentage change in quantity demanded. Luxury goods (Option H) also have elastic demand as they are non-essential and consumers can adjust their purchases with price changes. However, since the question requires a single answer, Option A is the most direct and commonly emphasized factor.

Answer: A
