Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically dealing with taxes, welfare spending, and the budget. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question says: "In a long period of economic expansion, the tax revenue collected ____ and the amount spent on welfare programs ____ creating a budget ____."

I remember that economic expansion means the economy is growing, so people are probably making more money, unemployment might be down, etc. So, how does that affect taxes and welfare?

First, tax revenue. If the economy is expanding, more people are working, and companies are making more profits. So logically, the government should collect more taxes because incomes are higher and corporate profits are up. So tax revenue probably increases. That means the first blank is "increases".

Next, welfare programs. Welfare spending is usually higher when the economy is bad because more people need assistance. But during an economic expansion, the economy is doing well. Unemployment is lower, so fewer people would need welfare. Therefore, the amount spent on welfare programs should decrease. So the second blank is "decreases".

Now, what about the budget? Well, the budget is about whether the government is spending more than it earns (deficit) or less (surplus). If tax revenue increases and welfare spending decreases, the government is taking in more and spending less. That should create a budget surplus because more money is coming in than going out. So the third blank is "surplus".

Putting it all together, the first blank is increases, second is decreases, third is surplus. Now, looking at the options:

Option F: increases decreases surplus. That matches what I thought. Let me check the other options quickly to be sure.

Option B: increases decreases deficit. No, because if revenue up and spending down, it's a surplus, not deficit.

Option F is correct.

The correct answer is F: increases decreases surplus. During an economic expansion, tax revenue increases due to higher incomes and corporate profits, while welfare spending decreases as fewer people need assistance. This results in a budget surplus.
