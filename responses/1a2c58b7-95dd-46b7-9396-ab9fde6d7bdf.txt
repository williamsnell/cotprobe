Okay, so I need to find the square roots of the complex number A, which is given as 3.08 + j8.455. Hmm, I remember that to find square roots of complex numbers, it's often easier to convert them into polar form first because then we can take the square root more straightforwardly by taking the square root of the magnitude and halving the angle.

First, I should find the magnitude of A. The magnitude is calculated as the square root of (real part squared plus imaginary part squared). So that would be sqrt(3.08² + 8.455²). Let me compute that.

3.08 squared is approximately 3.08 * 3.08. Let me calculate that: 3*3 is 9, 0.08*3 is 0.24, 3*0.08 is another 0.24, and 0.08*0.08 is 0.0064. So adding those up: 9 + 0.24 + 0.24 + 0.0064 = 9.4864. Wait, no, that's not right because I think I'm mixing up the terms. Actually, (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². Let me do it properly: 3.08 squared is (3 + 0.08)^2 = 3² + 2*3*0.08 + 0.08² = 9 + 0.48 + 0.0064 = 9.4864.

Next, 8.455 squared. Let's see, 8 squared is 64. Then 0.455 squared is about 0.207 (since 0.45^2 is 0.2025, and 0.005^2 is negligible). But wait, 8.455 is actually 8 + 0.455. So (8.455)^2 = 8^2 + 2*8*0.455 + 0.455^2. Calculating each term: 64 + 2*8*0.455 = 64 + 7.28 = 71.28, and 0.455^2 is approximately 0.207. So total is 64 + 7.28 + 0.207 ≈ 71.487.

Now, adding the squares of real and imaginary parts: 9.4864 + 71.487 ≈ 80.9734. The magnitude |A| is the square root of this, so sqrt(80.9734). Let me estimate that. I know that 8^2 is 64 and 9^2 is 81, so sqrt(81) is 9. Therefore, sqrt(80.9734) is just a bit less than 9, maybe 8.998, which is approximately 9. So the magnitude is about 9.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check because the numbers might add up differently. 3.08 squared is 9.4864 and 8.455 squared is 71.487. Adding these gives approximately 80.9734, so sqrt(80.9734) is indeed approximately 8.998, which I can round to 9.

Next, I need to find the angle θ of A. The angle is given by the arctangent of (imaginary part / real part). So θ = arctan(8.455 / 3.08). Let me compute that ratio: 8.455 divided by 3.08. Let me see, 3.08 times 2 is 6.16, which is less than 8.455. 3.08 * 2.75 would be 3.08 * 2 = 6.16, plus 3.08 * 0.75 = 2.31, totaling 8.47. Oh, that's close to 8.455. So 8.455 / 3.08 ≈ 2.75. So θ ≈ arctan(2.75).

I remember that arctan(1) is 45°, arctan(sqrt(3)) is 60°, which is about 1.732. So 2.75 is higher than that. Maybe around 70°? Let me check: tan(70°) is approximately 2.747, which is very close to 2.75. So θ is approximately 70°. So A in polar form is approximately 9 ∠ 70°.

Now, to find the square roots, I take the square root of the magnitude and half the angle. So magnitude of square root is sqrt(9) = 3. The angles will be 70°/2 = 35° and 70° + 180° divided by 2, which is (70 + 180)/2 = 250/2 = 125°, but wait, no, because the square roots of a complex number are in opposite directions, so the two angles should be θ/2 and θ/2 + 180°. So 35° and 35° + 180° = 215°. So the square roots are 3∠35° and 3∠215°.

Looking at the options, option H is 3∠35° and 3∠215°, which matches what I calculated. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 4∠35° and 4∠215°. The magnitude would be 4, which is higher than 3, so this is incorrect.

Option B: 2∠40° and 2∠220°. Magnitude is 2, which is less than 3, so no.

Option C: 3.5∠45° and 3.5∠225°. Magnitude is 3.5, which is higher than 3, so no.

Option D: 2.8∠33° and 2.8∠213°. Magnitude is 2.8, which is less than 3. Also, 213 is close to 215 but not exact, and 33 is close to 35.

Option E: 3∠45° and 3∠225°. The magnitude is correct, but the angles are 45°, which is higher than 35°. So not correct.

Option F: 3∠40° and 3∠220°. Again, magnitude correct, but angles not matching.

Option G: 2.5∠30° and 2.5∠210°. Magnitude too low.

Option H: 3∠35° and 3∠215°. Correct, as we found.

Option I: 3∠30° and 3∠210°. Angles lower than 35°, so no.

Option J: 3∠50° and 3∠230°. Angles higher, so no.

So the correct answer should be option H.

The square roots of the complex number \( A = 3.08 + j8.455 \) are calculated by converting \( A \) to polar form. The magnitude is approximately \( 9 \), and the angle is approximately \( 70^\circ \). Taking the square root of the magnitude gives \( 3 \), and halving the angle results in \( 35^\circ \) and \( 215^\circ \). The correct option is H.

Answer: H
