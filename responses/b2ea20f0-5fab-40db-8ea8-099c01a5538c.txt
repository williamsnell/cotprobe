Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about the tax implications when a partner leaves a partnership. The setup is that Studio Partnership has three partners: Ross with 15%, Stone with 35%, and Taylor with 50%. Then on April 9, Stone sells his entire interest to Taylor. The question is whether the partnership terminated for tax purposes.

First, I remember that a partnership doesn't automatically terminate just because one partner leaves, but there are certain conditions where it might. I think the key is whether the remaining partners can continue the business. So if a partner sells their interest to another partner, does that cause the partnership to end?

I recall that for a partnership to terminate, there needs to be an event that causes the partnership to end. Common reasons include mutual agreement by all partners, withdrawal of a partner leading to dissolution, or some other cause like insolvency. But if a partner sells their interest to another existing partner, the business can still continue because the new owner (Taylor) is still part of the partnership. So the partnership doesn't necessarily terminate; it just changes who the partners are.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option D says the studio did not terminate. That seems possible. Option E says it didn't terminate but was restructured. Restructured might imply a change in the way the business operates, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. The partnership's structure is still the same; Taylor just has a bigger share now.

Other options suggest termination on various dates. Stone's departure is on April 9, so option F says terminated as of April 9. But if the partnership can continue, that shouldn't be the case. Also, the question is about tax status, and the IRS generally considers a partnership to continue unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, I think the key rule is that a partnership continues unless there's a dissolution event. Selling a partnership interest to another partner doesn't dissolve the partnership. So the partnership didn't terminate; it just had a change in ownership.

So looking at the options again, D says it didn't terminate, and E says it restructured. I think D is more accurate because the structure didn't change in a way that requires restructuring, just the ownership. Restructuring might involve changing the business model or legal structure, which isn't the case here.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D: Studio did not terminate.

The partnership does not terminate when a partner sells their interest to another existing partner, as the business can continue. The correct answer is D.

Answer: D
