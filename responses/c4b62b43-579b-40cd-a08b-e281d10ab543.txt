Okay, so I've got this question about Gauthier's claim regarding moral agreements. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking why Gauthier thinks that moral agreements that are equally favorable to all parties are desirable. The options are A through G, each giving a different reason.

First, I remember that Gauthier is a contemporary philosopher, and his work relates to moral theory. I think he's associated with something called "contractarianism," which is a theory that suggests moral principles are those that rational people would agree to under certain conditions. So, contractarianism is a type of ethical theory where the foundation of morality is based on agreements or contracts among individuals.

In contractarianism, the idea is that moral agreements are those that no party could reasonably reject. These agreements are seen as fair because they treat all parties equally. So, when Gauthier talks about moral agreements being equally favorable, he's probably emphasizing fairness and equality.

Looking at the options:

A: promote a sense of community and unity. That seems more like a utilitarian or communitarian concern, but I'm not sure if that's what Gauthier focuses on.

B: satisfy our desire for fairness. This sounds plausible because contractarianism is about fairness and mutual agreement.

C: fulfill the basic needs of all parties. That's more about meeting needs, which might relate to utilitarianism's focus on maximizing overall well-being, but not sure if that's Gauthier's main point.

D: promote the principle of equality. This is definitely a key point in contractarianism because equal treatment is central to fair agreements.

E: maximize the productivity of society. That seems more economic or maybe related to utilitarianism, which is about the greatest good for the greatest number, but not directly about fairness.

F: ensure the preservation of individual rights. This is important, but I think Gauthier's focus is more on the fairness of the agreements themselves rather than just rights preservation.

G: increase the overall happiness of society. Again, this seems more utilitarian.

So, narrowing it down, both B and D seem relevant. Contractarianism is about fairness, which relates to satisfying the desire for fairness (B). But it's also about promoting equality (D). Wait, how does Gauthier frame it? I think he argues that moral principles are those that would be agreed upon in a fair decision-making process where each party has equal consideration. So the emphasis is on equal fairness, which would satisfy the desire for fairness. But also, promoting equality is part of that.

Wait, the question is about why such agreements are desirable. Gauthier would likely say it's because they are fair and satisfy our desire for fairness. So B is about desire for fairness, while D is about the principle of equality. Which is it?

I think in contractarianism, the main point is about fairness and mutual benefit, which aligns with satisfying the desire for fairness. So B might be the answer. But I'm a bit confused because promoting equality is also a principle.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the phrasing. The question is why the agreements are desirable. Gauthier would argue that because they are fair, they satisfy our desire for fairness. So B is the reason, while D is a principle they promote, but not the reason for desirability.

Alternatively, maybe D is correct because the agreements are equally favorable, thus promoting equality. So the reason they're desirable is because they promote equality.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck between B and D. Let me think again. Contractarianism is about what rational agents would agree to, which is fair and equal treatment. So the desirability comes from the fairness and equality, which is why such agreements are good. So promoting equality (D) is the reason.

Wait, but the question is about why the agreements are desirable. So the reason is because they are fair, which satisfies our desire for fairness (B). Or is it because they promote equality (D) that they are desirable?

I think the answer is B because the desire for fairness is the motivation, while promoting equality is a consequence. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's D because promoting equality is the main reason for their desirability.

Wait, I think I need to recall Gauthier's arguments. He emphasizes that moral agreements are those that no one can reasonably reject, which implies fairness and equal consideration. So the reason they are desirable is because they satisfy our desire for fairness, making B the correct answer.

The question asks why Gauthier believes moral agreements that are equally favorable to all parties are desirable. Gauthier, a contractarian, argues that moral principles are those that rational individuals would agree to under fair conditions. These agreements are desirable because they are fair and satisfy the desire for fairness, which is central to contractarianism. While promoting equality is a consequence, the primary reason for the desirability of such agreements is their fairness, which aligns with satisfying our desire for fairness.

Answer: B
