Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer for this question about what a school psychologist should recommend. Let me read the question again carefully.

The situation is that Ms. Smith has a class of 30 students, and 26 of them have received discipline referrals. That's a lotâ€”almost the entire class. The psychologist needs to help address these problem behaviors that are disrupting learning.

The options are A through J, each suggesting a different approach. Let me go through them one by one and think about what makes the most sense.

Option A: Providing individual counseling to the 4 students who haven't been referred. Hmm, that seems odd. The problem is with the 26, not the 4. Plus, individual counseling might not address the class-wide issue effectively. It's probably not the best choice.

Option B: Assigning the 26 to in-school suspension. That sounds like a punishment, but I'm not sure if it's the most effective solution. It might remove them from the classroom, but it doesn't teach them how to behave better. It could also disrupt their learning further.

Option C: Assigning detention. Similar to B, this is a punitive measure. Detention alone might not solve the underlying issues causing the behavior. It's more about punishment than addressing the root causes.

Option D: Implementing a class-wide behavior management plan, like a response-cost raffle. This sounds promising. A response-cost raffle is a type of classroom management strategy where students earn points for good behavior, and then can exchange them for rewards. It's proactive and targets the whole class, which makes sense when most students are involved. It can create a positive environment and encourage better behavior.

Option E: Sending the 26 to an alternative school. That seems like a more severe step. It might be appropriate for students with severe behavioral issues, but if the problem is widespread, maybe a different approach would be better. Plus, removing 26 students from the class could disrupt the remaining students and the teacher's ability to manage.

Option F: School-wide assembly on proper behavior. While assemblies can raise awareness, they're usually one-time events and may not have a lasting impact. It's probably not enough on its own, especially when the problem is concentrated in one classroom.

Option G: Peer mediation program. This could help with interpersonal conflicts, but the question mentions that the problem is disrupting learning, which might include various behaviors, not just conflicts between students. So maybe not the most direct solution.

Option H: Group counseling on various skills. This is a good idea for addressing underlying issues, but again, it's more of a supportive intervention. It doesn't directly address the classroom behavior management, which is the immediate issue.

Option I: Comprehensive assessments for the 26. Assessments are useful for understanding individual issues, but if the problem is widespread, this might be too time-consuming and not the first step. It could be a later intervention after other strategies have been tried.

Option J: Individual behavior contracts for the 26. This could work, but managing 26 individual contracts might be overwhelming for the teacher and the psychologist. It's more intensive and might not be feasible in a busy school setting.

So, going back to the options, the key is that 26 out of 30 students are involved. This suggests that the problem is class-wide, not just a few individuals. Therefore, a class-wide approach would be more effective than addressing each student individually or removing them.

Option D, the response-cost raffle, seems to fit because it's a proactive, positive behavior support strategy that can be implemented for the entire class. It encourages good behavior and provides immediate feedback, which can help reduce disruptive behaviors over time.

Other options either focus on punishment or individual interventions, which might not be as effective in this case. So, I think D is the best choice.

The best recommendation is to implement a class-wide behavior management plan, such as a response-cost raffle, to address the widespread disruptive behavior in Ms. Smith's class. This approach is proactive, positive, and targets the entire class, making it more effective than individual or punitive measures.

Answer: D
