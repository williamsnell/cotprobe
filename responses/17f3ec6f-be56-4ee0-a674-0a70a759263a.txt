Question:

Is the ICJ hostile to the idea that an armed attack may arise through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force?

Options:

A: The ICJ has often supported the accumulation theory
B: The ICJ considers each instance of armed force individually, not cumulatively
C: The ICJ has never addressed this issue
D: The concept of an armed attack refers to a single attack, not multiple smaller instances of armed force
E: The ICJ has shown mixed views on the accumulation theory
F: In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory
G: The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory
H: The ICJ has consistently rejected the concept of an armed attack arising from cumulative instances
I: The ICJ has yet to make a definitive ruling on the accumulation theory
J: The ICJ ruled in favor of the accumulation theory in the Bosnia and Herzegovina case

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is hostile to the idea that an armed attack can arise from a series of smaller, cumulative instances of force. The question is about the ICJ's stance on the "accumulation theory," which suggests that multiple, less severe acts can add up to an armed attack.

First, I remember that the ICJ has dealt with cases involving the use of force and the concept of armed attack. One of the key cases is the Nicaragua v. United States case from 1986. In that case, the ICJ discussed the application of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the threat or use of force. 

In the Nicaragua case, the Court considered whether the United States' support for the Contra rebels constituted an armed attack. The United States argued that its actions were limited and not a single, significant attack. The Court, however, found that the cumulative effect of the U.S. actions did amount to a violation of Nicaragua's sovereignty. This suggests that the ICJ was open to the idea of an armed attack arising from multiple, smaller instances.

Looking at the options, option F says, "In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory." But from what I recall, the Court didn't dismiss it; instead, they accepted that the cumulative actions could constitute an armed attack. So option F seems incorrect.

Option G states, "The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory." Since the Court in Nicaragua did consider the cumulative effect, this seems accurate. They didn't reject the idea outright but acknowledged that multiple acts could add up.

Option H says the ICJ has consistently rejected the concept, which doesn't align with the Nicaragua case. Option A suggests the ICJ supported the accumulation theory often, but I don't think they've addressed it in many other cases beyond Nicaragua. So perhaps A is too strong.

Option E mentions mixed views, but Nicaragua shows they accepted it. So E might not be right. Option J refers to the Bosnia case, but I think the Bosnia case involved different issues, like genocide, not necessarily the accumulation theory. So J is probably incorrect.

Options I and C suggest the ICJ hasn't ruled definitively, but since Nicaragua dealt with it, those options are unlikely. So, putting it together, the best answer is G: The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory.

The ICJ addressed the accumulation theory in the Nicaragua case, where it accepted that cumulative actions could constitute an armed attack, indicating it was not hostile to the idea.

Answer: G
