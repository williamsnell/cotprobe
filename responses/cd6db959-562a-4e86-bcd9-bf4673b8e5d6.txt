Question:

Explain the method of copulation in the earthworms.

Options:

A: Earthworms reproduce asexually by fission.
B: Earthworms engage in internal fertilization where one worm injects sperm directly into the ovaries of the other.
C: Each earthworm fertilizes its own eggs internally without the need for a mate.
D: Earthworms attract mates through airborne pheromones and mate on the surface without physical contact.
E: Earthworms reproduce by budding, where small worms grow out of the parent's body.
F: Earthworms exchange sperm by connecting their posterior ends and then separate to lay fertilized eggs.
G: Earthworms reproduce by external fertilization in water.
H: Earthworms lay eggs without any copulation.
I: Two earthworms unite ventral surface to ventral surface with opposite anterior ends. They discharge sperm into the other's seminal receptacles. After separation, a cocoon is secreted for egg and sperm deposition.
J: Two earthworms connect at their anterior ends and exchange sperm through their mouths before separating to lay eggs independently.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to the question about how earthworms reproduce. I remember that earthworms are annelids, and they have a particular method of reproduction. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says they reproduce asexually by fission. I think that's not right because I remember earthworms are sexual, requiring two parents. Fission is more like how some other worms or creatures reproduce asexually, but earthworms usually need mates.

Option B mentions internal fertilization where one worm injects sperm into the ovaries of the other. I'm not sure about that. I think internal fertilization is more common in animals like mammals or birds, but earthworms might have a different method. I'll keep this in mind but don't think it's correct.

Option C states each worm fertilizes its own eggs internally without a mate. That doesn't make sense because if they don't need a mate, it would be asexual, and I don't think earthworms do that. So probably not C.

Option D talks about attracting mates with pheromones and mating on the surface without contact. I've heard that earthworms can come to the surface, maybe during rain, but mating without physical contact? Not sure. I think they do physically connect, so D might not be right.

Option E suggests reproduction by budding, like growing small worms from the parent. I don't recall earthworms using budding; that's more like how some invertebrates reproduce asexually. So E is likely incorrect.

Option F says they exchange sperm by connecting their posterior ends and then lay fertilized eggs. This sounds more familiar. I remember something about the tail ends touching to exchange sperm. After that, each worm lays eggs, which then develop. So F could be correct.

Option G is about external fertilization in water. I think external fertilization happens in water for many aquatic animals, but earthworms live in soil, so G doesn't seem right.

Option H claims they lay eggs without copulation. But since they do need to mate, H would mean asexual reproduction, which I don't think applies here. So H is probably wrong.

Option I describes two earthworms uniting ventral surfaces to ventral surfaces with opposite anterior ends. They discharge sperm into each other's seminal receptacles, then a cocoon forms. This rings a bell. I think earthworms pair up ventrally, exchange sperm, and then each lays eggs which are protected by a cocoon. So I might be correct.

Option J says they connect at anterior ends and exchange sperm through mouths. That sounds odd. I haven't heard of earthworms mating through their mouths. So J is likely incorrect.

Now, comparing F and I. F says they connect posterior ends and lay fertilized eggs. I says they connect ventral surfaces, opposite anterior ends, exchange sperm into receptacles, then a cocoon is made. Which is accurate?

I think the correct method is that earthworms pair up, usually on the surface, with their ventral sides together. They exchange sperm, each storing the other's in their seminal receptacles. Then they separate and each lays eggs in a cocoon. So option I seems to describe this accurately. F mentions exchanging at posterior ends but doesn't talk about the cocoon formation, which is a key part of their reproduction.

So the correct answer must be I.

The correct method of copulation in earthworms involves pairing ventral surface to ventral surface with opposite anterior ends. They exchange sperm into each other's seminal receptacles. After separation, a cocoon is secreted for the deposition of eggs and sperm. 

Answer: I
