Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to compute the product of (20)(-8) in Z_26. Hmm, Z_26 is the ring of integers modulo 26, right? So essentially, when I multiply these two numbers and then take the result modulo 26.

Wait, let me think. First, I should just multiply 20 and -8 normally. 20 times 8 is 160, so 20 times -8 must be -160. But I can't have a negative number in modulo arithmetic, so I should convert this to a positive equivalent. How do I do that again? Oh right, I add multiples of 26 until I get a positive number within the range 0 to 25.

But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can compute 20 * (-8) mod 26 directly. Let me try that. First, 20 times -8 is -160. Now, I need to find what -160 is modulo 26.

To find -160 mod 26, I can divide 160 by 26 and see how many times 26 goes into 160. Let's do that. 26 times 6 is 156, because 26*5=130, 26*6=156, and 26*7=182 which is too big. So 26*6=156. So 160-156=4. So 160 is 26*6 + 4, which means 160 mod 26 is 4. But wait, since it's negative, -160 mod 26 would be -4 mod 26. But -4 isn't positive, so I add 26 to it: -4 +26=22. So -160 mod 26 is 22.

Wait, another way: Alternatively, I could compute 20 mod 26 and -8 mod 26 first, then multiply. 20 mod 26 is just 20. -8 mod 26 is the same as 26-8=18. So now multiply 20*18. Let's calculate that. 20*18=360. Now, 360 mod 26. Let's see how many times 26 goes into 360.

Divide 360 by 26. 26*10=260, 26*13=338 (since 26*10=260, 26*3=78, so 260+78=338). 360-338=22. So 360 mod 26 is 22. So again, the result is 22.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Another approach: Since 20 and -8 are in Z_26, I can represent -8 as 18 (since 26-8=18). So 20 *18=360. Now, 360 divided by 26: 26*13=338, 360-338=22. So yes, 22 is the answer.

Looking at the options, option I is 22. So the correct answer should be I.

The product of 20 and -8 in Z_26 is computed by first converting -8 to its positive equivalent modulo 26, which is 18. Then, multiplying 20 by 18 gives 360. Taking 360 modulo 26 yields 22.
