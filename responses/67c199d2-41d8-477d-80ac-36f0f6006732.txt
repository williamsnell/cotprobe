Okay, so I need to figure out the storage requirement for this video. Let's see, the video is one hour long, in YUV format with a resolution of 1920x1080. It uses a 4:2:2 color subsampling and 8 bits per component. The frame rate is 30 frames per second. I have to calculate this in gigabytes with three significant figures.

Hmm, where do I start? I think the first step is to determine how much data each frame takes. Since it's YUV 4:2:2, the color subsampling means that the luminance (Y) has the full resolution, while the chrominance (U and V) are subsampled by half in each dimension. So, for each pixel in Y, there's a U and V for every two pixels in width. Wait, but when calculating the data per frame, I think each frame's size is based on the full resolution, but the subsampling affects the number of chroma samples.

Wait, no. Maybe I should think in terms of pixels. The resolution is 1920x1080, so each frame has 1920 * 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels. But with 4:2:2 subsampling, each Y component is at full resolution, but each U and V is at half the width. So for every 2x1 block of Y pixels, there's one U and one V. So, the number of U and V samples per frame would be (1920/2) * 1080 = 960 * 1080 = 1,036,800 each. So, Y has 2,073,600 samples, and U and V each have 1,036,800.

Each component is 8 bits, so each Y is 8 bits, each U 8 bits, each V 8 bits. So per pixel, how much data? Wait, no. Since the YUV format is 4:2:2, the data per frame is calculated as:

Total pixels per frame for Y: 1920 * 1080 = 2,073,600.

For U and V, since they're subsampled by 2:1 horizontally, each has (1920/2)*1080 = 960*1080 = 1,036,800.

So, each frame has Y, U, V. So total bits per frame would be:

Y: 2,073,600 * 8 bits
U: 1,036,800 * 8 bits
V: 1,036,800 * 8 bits

Adding them together: (2,073,600 * 8) + (1,036,800 *8) + (1,036,800 *8) = ?

Let me compute that. 2,073,600 *8 = 16,588,800 bits. Each U and V is 1,036,800 *8 = 8,294,400 bits each. So total per frame is 16,588,800 + 8,294,400 +8,294,400. Let's add them up:

16,588,800 + 8,294,400 = 24,883,200; adding another 8,294,400 gives 33,177,600 bits per frame.

Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of bytes. Since 8 bits = 1 byte, so per frame:

Y: 2,073,600 bytes
U: 1,036,800 bytes
V: 1,036,800 bytes

Total per frame: 2,073,600 + 1,036,800 + 1,036,800 = 4,147,200 bytes.

Wait, that makes more sense. So 4,147,200 bytes per frame. Now, the frame rate is 30 frames per second. So per second, it's 4,147,200 *30 = 124,416,000 bytes per second.

Wait, but let me check that math. 4,147,200 *30: 4,147,200 *30 is indeed 124,416,000 bytes/s.

Now, the video is one hour long, which is 3600 seconds. So total bytes = 124,416,000 * 3600 = ?

Let me compute that. 124,416,000 * 3600. Hmm, that's a big number. Let's break it down:

124,416,000 * 3600 = ?

Well, 124,416,000 * 3,600 = 124,416,000 * 3.6e3 = ?

Alternatively, 124,416,000 * 3,600 = (124,416,000 * 1,000) *3.6 = 124,416,000,000 *3.6 = 447,900,000,000 bytes.

Wait, that's 447.9 gigabytes? But that can't be right because the options don't go that high. The highest option is I:525, which is lower than 447.9? Wait no, 447.9 is higher than the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me redo the numbers.

Wait, I think I messed up the bits per frame. Let me think again. Another approach: the YUV 4:2:2 format has for every 2x1 block, so for each frame of 1920x1080, the Y has 1920*1080 = 2,073,600 samples. The U and V each have (1920/2)*1080 = 960*1080=1,036,800 samples each.

Each Y, U, V is 8 bits, so per frame:

Y: 2,073,600 *8 = 16,588,800 bits
U: 1,036,800 *8 = 8,294,400 bits
V: same as U, 8,294,400 bits.

Total bits per frame: 16,588,800 +8,294,400 +8,294,400 = 33,177,600 bits.

Convert bits to bytes: 33,177,600 /8 = 4,147,200 bytes per frame.

Now, 30 frames per second: 4,147,200 *30 = 124,416,000 bytes/s.

Then, 3600 seconds: 124,416,000 *3600 = ?

Wait, 124,416,000 *3,600 = 124,416,000 *3.6e3 = 447,900,000,000 bytes.

Convert to gigabytes: 447,900,000,000 /1,073,741,824 ≈ 417.3 GBytes.

Wait, because 1 GB is 1073741824 bytes (1 GiB). So 447,900,000,000 /1,073,741,824 ≈ 417.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 417. So the answer should be C:417.

The storage requirement for the video is calculated by determining the data per frame, total frames per second, and total duration. Each frame in YUV 4:2:2 format has 4,147,200 bytes. With 30 frames per second and a one-hour duration (3,600 seconds), the total storage is approximately 417 gigabytes.

Answer: C
