Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the farmer conveyed 100 acres to a landscaper. The deed had three covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. Then the landscaper sold it to a buyer using a warranty deed. Later, the buyer was evicted because of a paramount title. Now, the buyer is suing the farmer for breach of the covenants.

I remember that in real estate, covenants in a deed are promises made by the grantor (the seller) to the grantee (the buyer). These covenants can be breached if certain conditions aren't met. There are different types of covenants, and they can affect whether the grantee can sue the grantor later.

First, let's recall what each covenant means:

1. **Covenant of Seisin**: This is a promise that the grantor lawfully owns the property and has the right to convey it. If the grantor didn't actually own it, this covenant is breached.

2. **Covenant of Right to Convey**: This means the grantor has the legal authority to transfer the property. If there are issues like the grantor didn't have the right to sell, this covenant is breached.

3. **Covenant Against Encumbrances**: This ensures that there are no liens or other claims against the property when the grantee takes over. If there are hidden encumbrances, this covenant is breached.

In this case, the buyer was evicted due to a paramount title. That suggests there's another claim or ownership that takes priority over the buyer's deed. So, the problem is that when the farmer sold to the landscaper, the title wasn't clear, and that issue persisted when the landscaper sold to the buyer.

Now, the buyer is suing the farmer, not the landscaper. So, I need to think about whether the farmer is liable under the covenants in the original deed.

I remember that certain covenants run with the land, meaning they bind subsequent grantees. There's also the concept of privity. Privity refers to a direct legal relationship between the original grantor and the party suing. If there's no privity, the original grantor (farmer) might not be liable to the remote grantee (buyer).

Wait, the question is about whether the buyer can sue the farmer. The farmer conveyed to the landscaper, and the landscaper conveyed to the buyer. So, the farmer and the buyer are two steps removed. I think that's an issue because covenants are typically only enforceable between the original grantor and grantee. But some covenants can run with the land, allowing subsequent grantees to sue the original grantor.

Which covenants run with the land? The covenant of seisin and the covenant against encumbrances are real covenants that run with the land, meaning they can be enforced by subsequent grantees. The covenant of right to convey is a personal covenant and doesn't run with the land, so only the immediate grantee (landscaper) can sue for that.

In this case, the buyer is a subsequent grantee. So, if the problem is that the title was not clear (like an encumbrance or someone else having a superior title), that would relate to the covenant against encumbrances or seisin.

Wait, the buyer was evicted because of a paramount title. That suggests that when the farmer conveyed to the landscaper, the title wasn't clear, and that same issue affected the buyer. So, the farmer's deed to the landscaper had a problem that carried over.

Since the covenant against encumbrances is a real covenant, the buyer can sue the farmer. But what about the other covenants?

The covenant of seisin is also a real covenant. If the farmer didn't have good title, that would breach the covenant of seisin. So, the buyer could sue on that as well.

But wait, the buyer got the warranty deed from the landscaper. A warranty deed includes all the standard covenants, but the issue is whether the buyer can go back to the original farmer. Since the covenants of seisin and against encumbrances run with the land, the buyer can sue the farmer.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the buyer because the covenant against encumbrances was breached. Option A says the buyer for seisin and right to convey. But right to convey is a personal covenant, so the buyer can't sue for that. So, Option D might be correct because the buyer can sue for the covenant against encumbrances.

But wait, the eviction was due to a paramount title. That sounds like an issue with the title being encumbered because someone else had a better claim. So, the covenant against encumbrances would be the one breached.

Option I says the buyer because the warranty deed guarantees clear title. But the warranty deed is from the landscaper, not the farmer. The question is whether the buyer can sue the farmer based on the covenants in the farmer's deed to the landscaper.

Wait, the farmer's covenants were in the deed to the landscaper, so the landscaper is the one who could have sued the farmer. The buyer's warranty deed from the landscaper might have its own covenants, but the buyer is suing the farmer, not the landscaper.

So, the buyer can only sue the farmer if the covenants in the farmer's deed run with the land. Since seisin and against encumbrances are real covenants, the buyer can sue the farmer for those.

But wait, the answer options don't all include both. Option D is only about encumbrances. Option B says the buyer because seisin and right to convey were breached. But right to convey is personal, so the buyer can't sue for that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Farmer conveys to landscaper with covenants of seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances.

Landscaper conveys to buyer with a warranty deed, which includes all the standard covenants (seisin, right to convey, against encumbrances, quiet enjoyment, further assurance). But the buyer is suing the farmer, not the landscaper.

The covenants in the farmer's deed to the landscaper are:

1. Seisin: Farmer owns the land and can convey. If the title was bad, this is breached.

2. Right to convey: Farmer had the authority. If he didn't, breached.

3. Against encumbrances: No liens or claims. If there was a superior title, that's an encumbrance.

The buyer, as a remote grantee, can only sue the farmer if the covenants run with the land. So, seisin and against encumbrances are real covenants and do run. The right to convey is a personal covenant, so only the landscaper could sue for that.

In this case, the eviction was due to a paramount title, which would mean the farmer's title wasn't clear. So, the covenant against encumbrances was breached because there was an encumbrance (the paramount title). Also, the covenant of seisin was breached because the farmer didn't have good title.

But looking at the options, option D says the buyer because the covenant against encumbrances was breached. Option B says the buyer because seisin and right to convey were breached, but right to convey is personal, so the buyer can't sue for that. So, B is incorrect.

Option A says the buyer for seisin and right to convey. But again, right to convey is personal, so A is incorrect.

Option D seems correct because the covenant against encumbrances is a real covenant, allowing the buyer to sue the farmer.

Wait, but the eviction was due to a paramount title, which would also affect the covenant of seisin. So, the farmer breached both seisin and against encumbrances.

But the options don't have an option that includes both. Option D only mentions against encumbrances. Option B includes seisin and right to convey, which is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D because the paramount title is an encumbrance, so against encumbrances is the main breach here. Alternatively, seisin is also a breach.

Wait, the answer options don't have an option that includes both. So, maybe the correct answer is D because the primary issue is the presence of an encumbrance (the paramount title).

Alternatively, perhaps the eviction is due to the lack of seisin because the farmer didn't have good title. So, the breach of seisin would be the issue.

But looking at the options, option B says the buyer because seisin and right to convey were breached. But right to convey is personal, so the buyer can't sue for that. So, B is incorrect.

Option D says the buyer because against encumbrances was breached. That seems correct because the paramount title is an encumbrance.

Wait, but the problem says the buyer was evicted because of paramount title. That suggests that the farmer's title was defective, which would breach the covenant of seisin as well. So, the farmer is liable under both seisin and against encumbrances.

But the answer options don't have an option that includes both. So, perhaps the correct answer is D, focusing on against encumbrances.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes both. Let me check the options again.

Option A: buyer, seisin and right to convey. But right to convey is personal, so no.

Option B: buyer, seisin and right to convey. Same issue.

Option D: buyer, against encumbrances.

So, the correct answer is D because the buyer can sue the farmer for the covenant against encumbrances, which was breached by the paramount title.

But wait, another thought: the covenant against encumbrances only guarantees against encumbrances existing at the time of conveyance. If the paramount title arose after the farmer conveyed to the landscaper, perhaps it's not covered. But the question doesn't specify when the paramount title came into play. It just says the buyer was evicted because of it. So, perhaps it's assumed that the encumbrance existed at the time of the farmer's conveyance.

In that case, the farmer breached the covenant against encumbrances, so the buyer can sue.

So, the answer is D.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the buyer can sue the farmer for breach of covenants in the deed. The farmer conveyed the property to the landscaper with covenants of seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. The landscaper then conveyed the property to the buyer via a warranty deed. The buyer was later evicted due to a paramount title, indicating a defect in the title that likely existed when the farmer conveyed the property.

Key points to consider:

1. **Covenants in the Deed**:
   - **Covenant of Seisin**: Guarantees the grantor lawfully owns the property and can convey it. If the farmer did not have good title, this covenant was breached.
   - **Covenant of Right to Convey**: Ensures the grantor has the legal authority to transfer the property. This is a personal covenant and only the immediate grantee (landscaper) can sue for its breach.
   - **Covenant Against Encumbrances**: Guarantees no liens or claims against the property. A paramount title would constitute an encumbrance, breaching this covenant.

2. **Enforceability by Subsequent Grantees**:
   - The covenants of seisin and against encumbrances are real covenants that run with the land, allowing subsequent grantees (like the buyer) to sue the original grantor (farmer).
   - The covenant of right to convey is a personal covenant and does not run with the land, so the buyer cannot sue the farmer for its breach.

3. **Buyer's Claim**:
   - The buyer was evicted due to a paramount title, which indicates a defect in the title that likely existed when the farmer conveyed the property to the landscaper. This defect breaches both the covenant of seisin and the covenant against encumbrances.
   - However, the answer options do not include both covenants. The most accurate option is that the buyer can sue the farmer for the breach of the covenant against encumbrances, as the paramount title constitutes an encumbrance.

Given the options, the correct answer is that the buyer can sue the farmer for the breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

**Answer: D**
