Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about bond orders in He₂ and He₂⁺. Hmm, I remember bond order is calculated using the molecular orbital theory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out the electron configurations for He₂ and He₂⁺. Helium has an atomic number of 2, so each He atom has 2 electrons. So, He₂ would have 4 electrons in total. When they form He₂, the electrons fill molecular orbitals.

Wait, molecular orbitals for diatomic molecules like He₂ are built from the combination of atomic orbitals. The order of filling is usually sigma 2s, sigma* 2s, then sigma 2p, pi 2p (each), and pi* 2p (each). But for He, which is a noble gas, the electrons are in the 2s orbital, right?

So for He₂, which has 4 electrons. Let's list the molecular orbitals in order of increasing energy: sigma(2s), sigma*(2s), and then higher orbitals like pi(2p) and sigma(2p), but I think for He₂, the electrons won't go into the 2p orbitals because they're higher in energy and He has only 2 electrons each.

Wait, no. Each He atom has 2 electrons, so He₂ has 4 electrons. The molecular orbitals would be filled starting from the lowest. So the first orbital is sigma(2s) with a bonding orbital. Each molecular orbital can hold 2 electrons (with opposite spins). So sigma(2s) can hold 2 electrons. Then the next is sigma*(2s), which is anti-bonding, can hold another 2 electrons.

So for He₂, all 4 electrons would fill sigma(2s)² sigma*(2s)². Now, bond order is calculated as (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2. So bonding electrons here are 2, antibonding are 2. So bond order is (2-2)/2 = 0. So He₂ has a bond order of 0. That means it's a non-bonding molecule, which makes sense because He is a noble gas and doesn't typically form bonds.

Now, what about He₂⁺? He₂⁺ has one less electron than He₂. He₂ has 4 electrons, so He₂⁺ has 3 electrons. Let's fill the molecular orbitals again. The first is sigma(2s)², then sigma*(2s)¹. Because after filling sigma(2s)², the next electron goes into sigma*(2s) as an antibonding.

So bonding electrons are 2, antibonding are 1. Bond order is (2 - 1)/2 = 0.5. So He₂⁺ has a bond order of 0.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. For He₂, 4 electrons: sigma(2s)² sigma*(2s)². Bond order (2-2)/2=0. For He₂⁺, 3 electrons: sigma(2s)² and sigma*(2s)^1. So (2-1)/2=0.5. So He₂ has bond order 0, He₂⁺ has 0.5.

Looking at the options, option A says He₂ is 0 and He₂⁺ is 0.5. That's what I got. So the correct answer must be option A.

The bond order is calculated using molecular orbital theory. For He₂, there are 4 electrons, filling the molecular orbitals as σ(2s)² and σ*(2s)². The bond order is (2-2)/2 = 0. For He₂⁺, there are 3 electrons, filling σ(2s)² and σ*(2s)¹. The bond order is (2-1)/2 = 0.5. Thus, the bond order of He₂ is 0, and He₂⁺ is 0.5.
