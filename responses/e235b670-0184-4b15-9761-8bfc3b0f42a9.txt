Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a concept related to risk perception. The question says that our perception of risk is greater if we're continually reminded of it rather than just considering it at the point of purchase. I need to figure out which term this refers to from the given options.

First, I'll try to break down the question. It's talking about how the way we perceive risk changes based on how often we're reminded of it. If something reminds us of a risk repeatedly, we might feel it's riskier than if we only think about it when we're about to buy something. So, the concept here is about how the frequency of reminders affects our risk assessment.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Anchoring effect. I remember that anchoring is about how we rely too much on the first piece of information we get, which affects our decisions. Not sure if this is about reminders.

B: Price bonding. Not familiar with this term. Maybe it's related to pricing strategies?

C: Purchase context. This sounds like the situation or environment when buying something. But the question is about risk perception over time, not just the context of purchase.

D: Availability heuristic. Oh, I think this is about how easily examples come to mind. If something is more available in our memory, we think it's more likely. So if we're reminded of a risk often, it becomes more available, making us perceive it as a greater risk. This seems relevant.

E: Loss aversion. This is about disliking losses more than liking gains, so it's about the emotional response to loss, not the perception based on reminders.

F: Pricing illusion. I'm not sure what this is. Maybe related to how prices are perceived, but not directly about risk reminders.

G: Risk premium. This is a term from finance, referring to the extra return required for taking a risk. Not related to perception based on reminders.

H: Mark-up price. This is about setting a price higher than the cost, so not related to risk perception.

I: Odd number pricing. This is a pricing tactic, like using $19.99 instead of $20, but not about risk.

J: Cost fallacy. This might be incorrect beliefs about costs, but again, not about risk reminders.

So, putting it together, the concept that fits is the availability heuristic. When we're reminded of a risk often, it becomes more available in our memory, making us perceive it as more probable or significant. Therefore, the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: Availability heuristic.
