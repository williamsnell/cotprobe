Okay, so I've got this question here about firms producing fewer 35-mm cameras and more digital cameras over the past 20 years. The question is asking what this trend is an example of, with options from A to J. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that economics talks about how markets answer certain questions. The four main questions are: what to produce, how to produce, for whom to produce, when to produce, and sometimes where and why. These are often referred to as the "five Ws and one H" in some contexts.

So the question here is about the change in production from 35-mm to digital cameras. That seems like a shift in what products are being made. So I'm thinking it relates to the "what" part, which is about deciding what goods or services to produce.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the market system answering "what" cameras to produce. That fits because the companies are changing their production based on consumer demand or market trends. 

Option B is about "when," which is more about timing, like when to release a product, not so much the type of product.

Option C is "why," which would be reasons behind production, like profit motives, but the question is more about the product mix change.

Options D and F mention government regulation or central planners, which doesn't seem right because the question implies a market-driven change, not regulation.

Option E is about "where," which is location, not the type of product.

Option G is "who" should consume, which is more about distribution, not production types.

Option H is "how," which is about production methods, not what to produce.

So the correct answer should be A because the market is determining the types of cameras to produce based on demand and preferences.

The trend of firms producing fewer 35-mm cameras and more digital cameras is an example of the market system answering the question of "what" cameras should be produced. This shift reflects consumer preferences and demand, which guide production decisions in a market-driven economy.

Answer: A
