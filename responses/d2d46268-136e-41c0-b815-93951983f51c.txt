Question:

Before a proposal to merge two towns was placed on a ballot, the state attorney general issued an advisory opinion stating that the measure did not, in her opinion, violate any statutory or constitutional provisions. Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both towns. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from one of the towns initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the proposal. The suit reached the state supreme court and was found to be constitutional under both state and federal law. The plaintiffs now file a motion seeking to have thiscase reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court. The Court may

Options:

A: not hear the case, because it was decided on independent state grounds.
B: not hear the case, because the U.S. Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over state matters
C: not hear the case, but may have it remanded to federal district court.
D: hear the case because it involves a constitutional issue
E: hear the federal issues involved, but decline to rule on the state issue.
F: hear the case, but only rule on the constitutionality of the merger
G: hear the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs have a right to a federal hearing
H: rely on the advisory opinion rendered by the state attorney general and not hear the case on its merits.
I: not hear the case, because the U.S. Supreme Court does not review state supreme court decisions unless federal law is violated.
J: not hear the case, because the state supreme court's decision is final

Alright, let me try to work through this question step by step. Okay, so the question is about whether the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case that's been decided by a state supreme court. Let me break down the scenario and the legal principles involved.

First, the scenario: A proposal to merge two towns was put on the ballot. The state attorney general gave an advisory opinion that it doesn't violate any laws. Then the voters approved it. After the election but before the merger, some taxpayers sued to stop the merger, claiming it's unconstitutional. The state supreme court found it constitutional under both state and federal law. Now, the plaintiffs are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review this decision.

I remember that the U.S. Supreme Court has limited jurisdiction, meaning it can't hear just any case. The main way cases get to the Supreme Court is through its appellate jurisdiction, which involves cases where a state court has decided a legal issue, especially one involving federal law.

So, looking at the options, I think about the concept of 'federal question jurisdiction.' If a state court's decision involves the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution or federal laws, the Supreme Court can review it. But the key here is whether the state court's decision was based on federal law or state law.

In this case, the state supreme court decided the proposal was constitutional under both state and federal law. That means they addressed federal constitutional issues. So, the case does involve a federal question, which would allow the Supreme Court to take jurisdiction.

Wait, but another point is whether the state court's decision was based on independent state grounds. If the state court decided the case solely based on state law, then the Supreme Court might not have jurisdiction because it's not a federal issue. But here, the state court considered both state and federal law, so the case does involve a federal question.

Looking at the options, option D says the court may hear the case because it involves a constitutional issue. That sounds right because the case did address the constitutionality under federal law.

Option A says they can't hear it because it was decided on independent state grounds. But in this case, it wasn't decided solely on state groundsâ€”they also considered federal law. So A might not apply here.

Option I says the Supreme Court doesn't review state decisions unless federal law is violated. But here, the state court did address federal law, so the Supreme Court can review it.

Option J suggests the state's decision is final, but that's not the case because the Supreme Court can review state decisions involving federal law.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be D because the case involves a constitutional issue under federal law, allowing the Supreme Court to hear it.

The U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review cases involving federal constitutional issues. In this scenario, the state supreme court addressed both state and federal law, meaning the case involves a federal question. Therefore, the Supreme Court may hear the case.
