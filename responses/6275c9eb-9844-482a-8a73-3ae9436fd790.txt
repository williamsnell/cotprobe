Okay, so I've got this audit question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about performing interim audit procedures on accounts receivable and finding numerous unexpected errors, which changes the risk assessment. The auditor needs to respond appropriately. The options are A to H.

First, I need to recall what happens when unexpected errors are found during an interim audit. When errors are found, especially if they're unexpected, it suggests that there might be a problem with the internal controls or the financial statements. This would mean the auditor should adjust their risk assessment, probably increasing it because the accounts are more susceptible to misstatement.

So, the auditor's response should be to do more testing or more thorough testing to address the increased risk. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Send negative instead of positive confirmations. Negative confirmations are less reliable because they're more likely to be ignored, so I'm not sure if that's the best response. Maybe if there's a higher risk, using positive confirmations makes more sense because you get direct confirmation from the customers.

Option B: Use more experienced team members for year-end testing. That makes sense because more experienced auditors can handle complex issues, perform more thorough testing, and maybe catch more errors. This would help mitigate the increased risk.

Option C: Ignore the errors as they're not material. That's probably not a good idea because even if the errors aren't material, finding them might indicate a systemic issue. Ignoring them could lead to missing other errors, so the risk assessment should be updated, not ignored.

Option D: Use less experienced team members. That seems counterintuitive. If there's a higher risk, you'd want more experienced auditors, not less, to handle the more critical testing.

Option E: Decrease sampling. Decreasing sampling might lead to less coverage, which isn't good when you have increased risk. Maybe they should increase sampling or use more aggressive methods.

Option F: Perform fewer procedures to save time. That sounds risky. If you find errors, you should do more, not fewer, procedures to ensure the financials are accurate. Performing fewer could lead to missed issues.

Option G: Move detailed analytical procedures from interim to year-end. Maybe, but analytical procedures alone might not be enough if there's a high risk. They should probably do more testing, not just rely on analytical methods.

Option H: Increase the dollar threshold for vouching. That could mean they're only checking larger invoices, which might miss smaller ones. If there's a higher risk, lowering the threshold would be better to catch more discrepancies.

So, going back, the key is that the risk assessment has changed, so the auditor needs to respond with more thorough testing. Option B suggests using more experienced team members, which fits because they can perform more rigorous testing and handle the increased risk better.

I think the answer is B.

The correct response is to use more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing, as they can handle the increased risk more effectively.

Answer: B
