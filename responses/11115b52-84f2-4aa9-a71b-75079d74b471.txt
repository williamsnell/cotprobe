Question:

Describe locomotion in the amoeba.

Options:

A: Amoebas move by rolling over their surface in a continuous motion.
B: The locomotion of amoeba involves the projection of a pseudopodium, into which the inner endoplasm flows, causing the organism to advance. This process is often irregular and responsive to environmental stimulation.
C: Locomotion in amoebas is achieved through a series of rapid, snake-like slithering movements.
D: The amoeba relies on wind currents to drift from one location to another.
E: The amoeba moves by jumping from one place to another.
F: The amoeba propels itself forward using tiny hair-like structures called cilia.
G: The amoeba uses flagella for locomotion.
H: The amoeba moves by contracting and expanding its body.
I: Amoebas use jet propulsion by expelling water from their bodies to move.
J: The amoeba secretes a slime trail and glides forward with rhythmic muscle contractions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how amoebas move. I remember from biology class that amoebas are single-celled organisms, right? They don't have bones or muscles like animals do, so they must move in a different way.

I think amoebas move by changing their shape. I've heard the term "pseudopodia" before. Pseudopodia are like temporary projections of the cell membrane and cytoplasm. So maybe the amoeba extends part of its body in one direction, and then that helps it move forward.

Looking at the options, option B says something about projecting a pseudopodium and the inner endoplasm flowing into it. That sounds familiar. I think the process is called "pseudopodia propulsion." The amoeba extends a pseudopodium in the direction it wants to go, and then the rest of the cell follows, kind of like how a person crawls by stretching their arms and legs.

Option A talks about rolling over the surface. I don't think that's right because amoebas don't have a hard surface to roll on, and their movement is more about extending and contracting.

Option C mentions snake-like slithering. That makes me think of worms or snakes, but amoebas don't have segments or muscles for that kind of movement. It's more about their entire body changing shape.

Option D says they rely on wind currents. I don't think so because amoebas live in environments like ponds or soil, and while they might be carried by water, their movement isn't dependent on wind.

Option E is jumping, which sounds like a quick movement, but amoebas move very slowly and steadily, not jumping.

Options F and G talk about cilia and flagella. Those are structures with hair-like beats that some other protozoa use for movement. Amoebas don't have these structures; instead, they use pseudopodia.

Option H talks about contracting and expanding. That sounds a bit like how some other organisms move, but I think amoebas move by extending a part of their body rather than just expanding and contracting the whole cell.

Option I mentions jet propulsion by expelling water. I don't recall amoebas using that method; they're not known for such mechanisms.

Option J says they secrete a slime trail and glide with muscle contractions. Wait, amoebas don't have muscles. They move through their cytoplasm's viscosity changes, not muscles. So J might not be correct.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is B: The locomotion involves projecting a pseudopodium and the endoplasm flowing into it, causing the organism to advance. This makes sense because it's the typical way amoebas move, and it's responsive to their environment, like moving towards food or away from danger.

The correct answer is B. Amoebas move by projecting a pseudopodium, which allows them to advance in a process that is responsive to environmental stimuli.

Answer: B
