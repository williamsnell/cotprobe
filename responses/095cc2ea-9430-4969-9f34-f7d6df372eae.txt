Question:

A landlord owned a large building in the city. On January iS, the landlord leased the building to atenant for a period of 20 years at a rental of $10,000 per month. The leasehold agreement between the landlord and tenant provided that the latter was not permitted "to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. " On February 1 of the following year, the tenant leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The tenant corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the tenant. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide "by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the landlord and the tenant. "One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a health club for the balance of the term of the corporation tenant lease. The health club owner took possession of the said premises on February 1, the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation health club leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The health club has a B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. For one year, the health club paid $17,500, each month directly to the corporation. During that same period, the corporation continued to pay $15,000 each month to the tenant, while the latter paid $10,000 (each month) to the landlord. The landlord knew about the leases to the corporation and the health club and protested promptly, but took no further action, apparently satisfied as long as he received his $10,000 per month from the tenant. Thereafter, the health club abandoned the premises and stopped paying rent to the corporation. After the health club discontinued paying rent, the corporation stopped paying rent to the tenant. When the tenant failed to receive his rent, he, too, stopped paying rent to the landlord. If the landlord brings suit to recover for past rent due, which of the following is most accurate?

Options:

A: The landlord may only recover against the health club for past rent due.
B: The landlord may recover against the health club for past rent due.
C: The landlord may recover against the tenant and the health club, jointly and severally, for past rent due.
D: The landlord may recover against the health club and the corporation, but not the tenant, for past rent due.
E: The landlord may only recover against the corporation for past rent due.
F: The landlord may recover against the tenant and the corporation, jointly and severally, for past rent due.
G: The landlord may recover against the corporation for past rent due.
H: The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.
I: The landlord cannot recover against anyone for past rent due.
J: The landlord may recover against the corporation and the health club, jointly and severally,for past rent due.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this landlord-tenant question. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, the landlord leased a building to a tenant for 20 years at $10,000 a month. The lease had a condition that the tenant couldn't assign the lease to anyone except a corporation with an 'A' credit rating. Then, the tenant leased it to a corporation that didn't have an 'A' rating. So the tenant assigned the lease in violation of the original agreement.

The lease from the tenant to the corporation was for five years at $15,000 a month. Importantly, the corporation agreed to abide by all the terms of the original lease between the landlord and the tenant. That probably means they took on the same obligations as the tenant, including the assignment clause.

A year later, this corporation then leased the premises to a health club for the remaining term of their lease. The health club had a 'B' rating, which is lower than 'A,' so they didn't meet the credit requirement. The health club paid $17,500 a month to the corporation, while the corporation was still paying $15,000 a month to the tenant, who in turn paid $10,000 to the landlord. The landlord knew about these subleases but only protested and didn't do anything else because he was getting his rent. 

Then the health club stopped paying rent to the corporation, which in turn stopped paying the tenant. The tenant then stopped paying the landlord. Now, the landlord is suing to recover past rent.

So, the question is who is liable for the past rent due to the landlord? The options are A to J.

I think the key points here are about assignment and assumption of liability. The original lease between landlord and tenant had an assignment clause. The tenant assigned to the corporation, which was a breach because the corporation didn't have an 'A' rating. But the corporation agreed to abide by all terms, so maybe they are now the primary obligor? Or perhaps the tenant is still liable as the original lessee.

When the corporation then subleases to the health club, the health club is now the sub-subtenant. But the health club didn't meet the credit rating requirement either. Since the health club is a 'B' rated, they're not allowed under the original lease terms.

Now, when the health club stops paying, the corporation stops, then the tenant stops, and the landlord misses out on his rent. The landlord is suing for past rent.

I think about privity of contract. The landlord's contract is only with the original tenant. The tenant is liable for the rent unless they can pass that liability under the lease terms. But the assignment clause would typically require the landlord's consent, which wasn't given here.

Wait, but the tenant assigned to the corporation without consent. So, the tenant is still liable because the assignment without consent doesn't relieve them of their obligations. The corporation is a subtenant, so they can't be a surety unless the lease says so.

But in this case, the corporation agreed to abide by all terms, which might make them a guarantor or perhaps assume the obligations. However, the initial assignment was without the landlord's consent, so maybe the landlord can't hold the corporation liable because the assignment was invalid.

Wait, but the landlord knew about the assignment to the corporation and the health club but didn't take action, only protesting. So, if the landlord accepted rent from the tenant through the corporation, that might imply some acceptance, but not necessarily a waiver of the assignment clause.

So, the tenant is still liable because they are the primary obligor. The corporation is a secondary obligor, but only if the lease allows it. Since the tenant assigned without consent, the corporation's obligation might be secondary, meaning the landlord can go after the tenant first, and if the tenant can't pay, then maybe the corporation.

But in this case, the tenant is the one who stopped paying when the corporation did. So, the landlord could sue the tenant for the past rent because the tenant is still on the hook for the original lease. The corporation is not liable because the assignment was without consent, and the landlord didn't agree to it, so the corporation isn't liable to the landlord directly.

The health club is even further down the line. They're a sub-subtenant and not liable to the landlord unless there's a direct lease, which there isn't. So the health club isn't liable to the landlord.

So, looking at the options, H says the landlord may recover against the tenant. E says only the corporation, but I think the tenant is still liable. So the correct answer should be H.

The landlord's right to recover past rent due arises from the original lease agreement with the tenant. The tenant is the primary obligor and remains liable for the rent unless the lease terms explicitly relieve them of this responsibility, which is not the case here. The assignment of the lease to the corporation without the landlord's consent does not relieve the tenant of their obligations. While the corporation agreed to abide by the terms of the lease, their liability is secondary, and the landlord cannot directly hold them liable without explicit consent. The health club, as a sub-subtenant, has no direct contractual relationship with the landlord and is not liable. Therefore, the landlord can recover from the tenant for the past rent due.

Answer: H
