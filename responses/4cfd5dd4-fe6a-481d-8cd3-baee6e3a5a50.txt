Okay, so I have this integral to solve: the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of [sin(3t) * sin(t/π)] / t² dt. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let's see if I can break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with integrals involving products of sine functions, sometimes it's helpful to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Maybe I can use the product-to-sum formula here. The product of sines can be converted into a sum, which might make the integral easier to handle.

The product-to-sum identity for sine functions is:
sin(A) * sin(B) = [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)] / 2.

So let me apply that here. Let A = 3t and B = t/π. Then,

sin(3t) * sin(t/π) = [cos(3t - t/π) - cos(3t + t/π)] / 2.

Simplifying inside the cosines:

3t - t/π = t(3 - 1/π)
3t + t/π = t(3 + 1/π)

So the integral becomes:

(1/2) * ∫ [cos(t(3 - 1/π)) - cos(t(3 + 1/π))] / t² dt from -∞ to ∞.

Now, this integral is from -infinity to infinity, and it's an even function because cos is even, and t² is even. So I can rewrite it as twice the integral from 0 to infinity.

So now the integral is:

(1/2) * 2 * ∫ [cos(t(3 - 1/π)) - cos(t(3 + 1/π))] / t² dt from 0 to ∞.

Which simplifies to:

∫ [cos(a t) - cos(b t)] / t² dt from 0 to ∞, where a = 3 - 1/π and b = 3 + 1/π.

Wait, I think I've seen integrals of the form ∫ (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x² dx from 0 to ∞. I think there's a standard result for this. Let me recall.

I remember that ∫ (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x² dx from 0 to ∞ is equal to (π/2)(b - a), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (π/2)(a - b) depending on the order. Wait, let's think about this more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider differentiation under the integral sign or using the Laplace transform. Another approach is to recognize that ∫ (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x² dx can be evaluated using integration techniques involving the exponential function.

Wait, another thought: I know that ∫ (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x dx from 0 to ∞ is equal to (π/2)(b - a) if b > a. But wait, that's for the integral of (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x. But here we have 1/x², so maybe integrating by parts could help.

Let me try integrating by parts. Let me set u = cos(at) - cos(bt), and dv = dt/t². Then du = -a sin(at) + b sin(bt) dt, and v = -1/t.

Wait, integrating by parts:

∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

So,

∫ (cos(at) - cos(bt))/t² dt = [ (cos(at) - cos(bt)) * (-1/t) ] from 0 to ∞ - ∫ (-1/t)( -a sin(at) + b sin(bt) ) dt.

Simplifying, the first term evaluated from 0 to ∞. Let's check the limits.

As t approaches ∞, cos(at) and cos(bt) oscillate, but when multiplied by -1/t, which goes to 0. So the upper limit is 0.

As t approaches 0 from the positive side, cos(at) ≈ 1 - (a² t²)/2, and similarly for cos(bt). So cos(at) - cos(bt) ≈ [1 - (a² t²)/2] - [1 - (b² t²)/2] = [(b² - a²)/2] t². Then, when multiplied by (-1/t), it becomes - (b² - a²)/2 * t. As t approaches 0, this tends to 0. So the first term is 0 - 0 = 0.

So we're left with:

∫ (a sin(at) - b sin(bt)) * (1/t) dt from 0 to ∞.

Hmm, so now I have ∫ [a sin(at) - b sin(bt)] / t dt from 0 to ∞.

I remember that ∫ sin(kt)/t dt from 0 to ∞ is (π/2) for k > 0. So, the integral becomes a*(π/2) - b*(π/2) = (a - b)(π/2).

Putting it all together, the original integral is:

∫ [cos(at) - cos(bt)]/t² dt from 0 to ∞ = (a - b)(π/2).

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. When I did the integration by parts, I had:

∫ (cos(at) - cos(bt))/t² dt = 0 - ∫ [a sin(at) - b sin(bt)] / t dt

Which is equal to -(a ∫ sin(at)/t dt - b ∫ sin(bt)/t dt )

Each ∫ sin(kt)/t dt from 0 to ∞ is π/2 for k>0. So,

= - [ a (π/2) - b (π/2) ) ] = - (a - b) (π/2) ) = (b - a) (π/2).

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the integral is (b - a)(π/2).

So then, the original integral after applying the product-to-sum identity is:

∫ [cos(at) - cos(bt)]/t² dt from 0 to ∞ = (b - a)(π/2).

But wait, in our case, a = 3 - 1/π, and b = 3 + 1/π.

So, b - a = (3 + 1/π) - (3 - 1/π) ) = 2/π.

Thus, the integral becomes (2/π) * (π/2) ) = (2/π)(π/2) = 1.

Wait, but wait a minute: the integral after the product-to-sum was from 0 to ∞, and we had a factor of 2 from the original integral being rewritten as twice the integral from 0 to ∞. Let me check that again.

Wait, no: the original integral after product-to-sum was from -∞ to ∞, which we converted to 2 times the integral from 0 to ∞. But in the integration by parts, we found that ∫ [cos(at) - cos(bt)] / t² dt from 0 to ∞ is (b - a)(π/2). So the original integral is 2 times that, right?

Wait, no. Let me retrace.

After using the product-to-sum identity, the integral became:

(1/2) * 2 * ∫ [cos(...) - cos(...)] / t² dt from 0 to ∞.

Because the integral from -∞ to ∞ is twice the integral from 0 to ∞. So the (1/2)*2 cancels out, leaving ∫ [cos(at) - cos(bt)] / t² dt from 0 to ∞, which is (b - a)(π/2).

So the value of the integral is (b - a)(π/2).

But wait, earlier calculation gives (b - a) = 2/π, so (2/π)*(π/2) = 1.

So the integral equals 1.

Wait, but the options include 1.0 as option G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the integration by parts.

Wait, the integral after product-to-sum was:

(1/2) * [ ∫_{-∞}^∞ cos(at)/t² dt - ∫_{-∞}^∞ cos(bt)/t² dt ].

But wait, each of these integrals ∫_{-∞}^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt is problematic because 1/t² isn't even in the sense of integrability over the entire real line. Wait, actually, cos(kt) is even, and 1/t² is even, so the integral from -∞ to ∞ is 2 times the integral from 0 to ∞.

But wait, hold on: 1/t² isn't integrable near zero because it behaves like 1/t², which is not integrable at t=0. Hmm, but wait, sin functions are oscillatory, and when multiplied by 1/t², maybe the integral converges?

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ [sin(3t) sin(t/π)] / t² dt as ∫_{-∞}^∞ [sin(3t) sin(t/π)] / t² dt.

Alternatively, perhaps using integration techniques involving Fourier transforms or delta functions? Wait, maybe another approach is better.

Wait, another approach: using the identity that the Fourier transform of 1/t² is related to some distribution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution theorem.

Wait, let me think again. Another way: using the identity that ∫_{-infty}^infty (sin a t / t) (sin b t / t) dt = π/2 (|a| + |b|) if a and b have the same sign. But wait, that might not directly apply here.

Wait, but in our case, the integrand is [sin(3t) sin(t/π)] / t². Let me write it as [sin(3t)/t] * [sin(t/π)/t]. So it's the product of two sinc functions. Then, perhaps I can use the convolution theorem for Fourier transforms.

The Fourier transform of sinc(ax) is something like 1/(2a) rect(f/(2a)), where rect is the rectangular function. So, the product in the time domain would correspond to the convolution in the frequency domain. So maybe the integral becomes the convolution of the two transforms evaluated at certain points.

Wait, let's denote f(t) = sin(3t)/t and g(t) = sin(t/π)/t. Then the integral is ∫ f(t) g(t) dt from -infty to infty, which is the Fourier transform of f convolved with the Fourier transform of g, evaluated at zero? Or perhaps it's the inner product, which is the value of the inverse transforms' convolution at zero. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ∫_{-infty}^{infty} [sin(a t)/t] [sin(b t)/t] dt = π/2 (|a| + |b|) if a and b have the same sign, but I might be misremembering.

Wait, let me check: The integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ [sin(a t)/t]^2 dt is π |a|.

Similarly, ∫_{-∞}^∞ [sin(a t)/t][sin(b t)/t] dt = (π/2)(|a| + |b|) if a and b have the same sign, and (π/2)(|a| - |b|) if they have opposite signs.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the identity I used earlier.

Wait, going back: after applying the product-to-sum formula, the integral becomes ∫ [cos(a t) - cos(b t)] / t² dt from -infty to ∞, which I then converted to 2 times the integral from 0 to ∞. Then, via integration by parts, I found it to be (b - a) π/2.

Wait, but in the problem, a = 3 - 1/π and b = 3 + 1/π. So, b - a = 2/π. Therefore, the integral is (2/π) * (π/2) = 1.

So the value is 1.0, which is option G.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute a and b:

a = 3 - 1/π ≈ 3 - 0.318 ≈ 2.682
b = 3 + 1/π ≈ 3 + 0.318 ≈ 3.318

So, b - a = 2/π ≈ 0.6366.

Then, (b - a) * (π/2) = (2/π) * (π/2) = 1.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral evaluates to 1.0, which is option G.

The integral $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\sin(3t) \sin(t/\pi)}{t^2} dt$ can be simplified using the product-to-sum identity for sine functions. Applying the identity $\sin(A)\sin(B) = \frac{\cos(A-B) - \cos(A+B)}{2}$, where $A = 3t$ and $B = t/\pi$, the integrand becomes:

\[
\sin(3t) \sin(t/\pi) = \frac{\cos(t(3 - 1/\pi)) - \cos(t(3 + 1/\pi))}{2}.
\]

Substituting this into the integral, we rewrite the original integral as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos(t(3 - 1/\pi)) - \cos(t(3 + 1/\pi))}{t^2} dt.
\]

Since the integrand is even, the integral over the entire real line is twice the integral from $0$ to $\infty$:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos(t(3 - 1/\pi)) - \cos(t(3 + 1/\pi))}{t^2} dt = \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos(a t) - \cos(b t)}{t^2} dt,
\]

where $a = 3 - 1/\pi$ and $b = 3 + 1/\pi$. Using integration by parts or standard results for such integrals, we find:

\[
\int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos(a t) - \cos(b t)}{t^2} dt = \frac{\pi}{2} (b - a).
\]

Substituting $a = 3 - 1/\pi$ and $b = 3 + 1/\pi$, we compute $b - a = 2/\pi$. Thus, the integral evaluates to:

\[
\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\pi} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the integral is $1.0$, corresponding to option **G**.
