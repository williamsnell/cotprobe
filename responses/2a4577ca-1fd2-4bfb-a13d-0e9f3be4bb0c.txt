Okay, so I've got this problem here about a set A and its Lebesgue measure. The set A is defined as A = {n + sum_{p=1}^infty a_p 2^{-2p} : n is an integer, and each a_p is either 0 or 1}. I need to find the Lebesgue measure of A, and the options are from A to J, with H being 1.0, I 0.0, etc.

Hmm, first, I should recall what Lebesgue measure is. The Lebesgue measure is a way of assigning a "volume", "area", or "length" to subsets of n-dimensional space. For a set in R (the real numbers), the Lebesgue measure is basically the length of the interval if the set is an interval, or the sum of lengths if it's a union of intervals. If a set is too "small" or "scattered", its measure could be zero. If it's like an interval or union, it's positive.

Looking at the set A, it consists of numbers that are integers (n) plus a sum of terms where each term is a_p times 2^{-2p}. Since a_p is either 0 or 1, each term is either 0 or 2^{-2p} = 1/(4^p). So the sum part is like a binary expansion, but with denominators decreasing quadratically instead of exponentially.

Let me think about the structure of each element in A. Each element is n plus a sum from p=1 to infinity of a_p * (1/4)^p. So each a_p contributes a term that's either 0 or (1/4)^p. So the fractional part (the part after the integer n) is a sum of terms like 0 or 1/4, 1/16, 1/64, etc. This looks similar to a base-4 expansion, except that each digit is either 0 or 1, not 0,1,2,3.

Wait, in base 2, each digit is 0 or 1, but here we have a sum where each term is 1/(4^p), which is like the p-th digit in base 4, but limited to 0 or 1. So the fractional part is a number in [0, sum_{p=1}^\infty 1/4^p )]. Let's compute that sum: it's a geometric series with first term 1/4 and ratio 1/4. So sum is (1/4)/(1 - 1/4)) = (1/4)/(3/4) )= 1/3. So the fractional part is in [0, 1/3). So each element of A is an integer plus a number between 0 and 1/3.

So the set A is a union of intervals, each of length 1/3, centered at each integer n. Because for each integer n, the set {n + x : x âˆˆ [0, 1/3)} is an interval of length 1/3. So A is the union of all these intervals for every integer n.

Wait, but wait a second. Each a_p is 0 or 1, so the fractional part is a sum that can't exceed 1/3, as we found. So each element is exactly n plus a number in [0, 1/3). So the set A is the union over all integers n of intervals [n, n + 1/3). So each interval is length 1/3, and they are spaced 1 unit apart (since n increments by 1 each time). But wait, the next interval after [n, n + 1/3) is [n+1, n+1 + 1/3), so there's a gap of 2/3 between the end of one interval and the start of the next.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think: The interval for n is [n, n + 1/3), and the next for n+1 is [n+1, n+1 + 1/3). So the gap between n + 1/3 and n+1 is 2/3. So the total measure isn't just countably many intervals each of length 1/3, because the measure of a countable union of disjoint intervals is the sum of their lengths, but only if they are non-overlapping. But here, each interval is disjoint from the others because they're separated by 2/3. So the measure would be the sum over all n of the length 1/3 for each interval. But wait, that's an infinite sum because n ranges over all integers, which is countably infinite. So the total measure would be countably infinite times 1/3, which is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right because each individual interval is length 1/3, and the number of such intervals is countably infinite, so sum is infinite. So the Lebesgue measure of A would be infinite. So looking at the options, option F is "Infinity". But wait, wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Each interval is [n, n + 1/3), so the length is 1/3, and each n is an integer. So for each integer n, the interval is 1/3 in length. So the measure of A is the sum over all integers n of 1/3, which is indeed infinite because there are infinitely many integers. So the Lebesgue measure of A would be infinite. Therefore, the correct option is F: Infinity.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a union over all integers, the measure could be finite if each individual set is small enough. But in this case, each interval is length 1/3, and adding up 1/3 infinitely gives infinity. So yes, the measure is indeed infinite.

The set \( A \) is a union over all integers \( n \) of intervals \([n, n + \frac{1}{3})\), each of length \( \frac{1}{3} \). Since there are infinitely many such intervals, the Lebesgue measure of \( A \) is infinite.
