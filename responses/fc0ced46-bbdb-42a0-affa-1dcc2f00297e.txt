Question:

What is a derived demand?

Options:

A: A demand that is caused by changes in weather patterns
B: A demand that is directly proportional to the supply of the product
C: A demand influenced by demographic changes in the population
D: A demand that decreases with the increase of product demand
E: A demand that creates new products
F: A demand for goods that are considered luxury items
G: A demand for a product due to its complementary relationship with another product
H: A demand that is independent of other demands
I: A demand which is derived from the demand for a final product
J: A demand for a product that is a substitute for another product

Okay, I need to figure out what derived demand is from the given options. Let me think about what I remember from economics. Derived demand refers to the demand for a product that comes from the demand for another product. So, it's not directly because people want it, but because they need it for something else.

Looking at the options:

A: Weather changes causing demand. That sounds more like seasonal demand, not derived.

B: Directly proportional to supply. That's more about supply and demand relationship, not derived.

C: Demographic changes. That's about population shifts affecting demand, not derived.

D: Decreases with product demand. That seems opposite; maybe complementary, but not derived.

E: Creates new products. Innovation, not derived.

F: Luxury items. High-end goods, but not necessarily derived demand.

G: Demand due to complementary products. Hmm, complementary could tie into derived demand because if product A is used with B, demand for B could be derived from A.

H: Independent demand. No, derived is dependent.

I: Derived from the demand for a final product. Yes, this makes sense. If you want a car, you need parts, so the parts have derived demand based on the car's demand.

J: Substitute products. If something is a substitute, its demand might increase when the other is unavailable, but that's not derived.

So, the correct answer is I. Derived demand comes from the demand for another product, like parts for a car.

The correct answer is I. Derived demand arises when the demand for a product is based on the demand for another, final product.
