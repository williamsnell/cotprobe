Okay, so I've got this matrix A, and I need to find its row rank and column rank. I remember that the row rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows, and the column rank is the maximum number of linearly independent columns. And I also recall that for any matrix, the row rank is equal to the column rank, which is just called the rank of the matrix. So, if I can find one, I'll know the other too. 

Let me write down the matrix first to get a better look:

A = [
[1, 2, 3, 4, -3],
[1, 2, 0, -5, 1],
[2, 4, -3, -19, 6],
[3, 6, -3, -24, 7]
]

Hmm, it's a 4x5 matrix. So, there are 4 rows and 5 columns. The possible ranks can't exceed 4 because there are only 4 rows. So the maximum possible rank is 4, but it could be less if rows are dependent.

I think the best way to find the rank is to perform row operations to reduce the matrix to its row-echelon form. That should make it easier to see how many non-zero rows there are, which will give me the rank.

Let me start with the original matrix:

Row 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, -3]
Row 2: [1, 2, 0, -5, 1]
Row 3: [2, 4, -3, -19, 6]
Row 4: [3, 6, -3, -24, 7]

Alright, let's perform row operations. The goal is to get leading ones and zeros below them.

First, I'll use Row 1 as the pivot. Let's subtract Row 1 from Row 2:

Row 2 = Row 2 - Row 1:
[1-1, 2-2, 0-3, -5-4, 1-(-3)] = [0, 0, -3, -9, 4]

So now, the matrix looks like:

Row 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, -3]
Row 2: [0, 0, -3, -9, 4]
Row 3: [2, 4, -3, -19, 6]
Row 4: [3, 6, -3, -24, 7]

Next, I'll eliminate the elements below the first pivot (1) in Row 1. Let's subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 3:

Row 3 = Row 3 - 2*Row1:
2-2*1 = 0
4-2*2 = 0
-3 -2*3 = -3-6 = -9
-19 -2*4 = -19-8 = -27
6 -2*(-3) = 6+6 =12

So Row 3 becomes [0, 0, -9, -27, 12]

Similarly, subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 4:

Row 4 = Row4 -3*Row1:
3-3*1=0
6-3*2=0
-3 -3*3= -3-9=-12
-24-3*4= -24-12=-36
7 -3*(-3)=7+9=16

Row 4 becomes [0, 0, -12, -36, 16]

Now the matrix is:

Row1: [1, 2, 3, 4, -3]
Row2: [0, 0, -3, -9, 4]
Row3: [0, 0, -9, -27, 12]
Row4: [0, 0, -12, -36, 16]

Now, looking at the second column, the first two rows have zeros, so I'll focus on the third column for the next pivot. The pivot is at Row2, Column3 with -3. Let's make it 1 by dividing Row2 by -3:

Row2 = Row2 / (-3):
0, 0, 1, 3, -4/3

Wait, that's okay, but fractions might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can swap Row2 with another row that has a smaller number, but I think it's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make the pivot in Row2 as 1, but maybe it's easier to proceed without scaling for now.

Now, I'll use this pivot to eliminate the elements below it in Column3.

Looking at Row3: the third element is -9. So I'll add 3 times Row2 to Row3 to eliminate it:

Row3 = Row3 + 3*Row2:
0, 0, (-9) + 3*(-3) = -9-9= -18? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, Row2 after scaling is [0,0,1,3,-4/3], so 3*Row2 is [0,0,3,9,-4]. Then Row3 is [0,0,-9,-27,12]. So adding 3*Row2:

Row3: [0,0,-9+3, -27+9, 12 + (-4)] = [0,0,-6, -18, 8]

Wait, that doesn't seem right because I thought Row3's third element was -9. Let me check again.

Wait, after scaling Row2 by dividing by -3, Row2 becomes [0,0,1,3,-4/3]. So when I perform Row3 = Row3 + 3*Row2, the third element becomes -9 + 3*(1) = -6, yes. Similarly, the fourth element: -27 + 3*3 = -27 +9 = -18. Fifth element: 12 + 3*(-4/3) = 12 -4 =8. So Row3 becomes [0,0,-6,-18,8].

Now, Row4's third element is -12. So I'll add 12 times Row2 to Row4 to eliminate it:

Row4 = Row4 +12*Row2:
0, 0, (-12) +12*(1)=0,
-36 +12*3= -36+36=0,
16 +12*(-4/3)=16 -16=0.

So Row4 becomes [0,0,0,0,0].

Now the matrix looks like:

Row1: [1, 2, 3, 4, -3]
Row2: [0, 0, 1, 3, -4/3]
Row3: [0, 0, -6, -18, 8]
Row4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation for Row3. Let me check again.

Wait, after scaling Row2, Row2 is [0,0,1,3,-4/3]. So when I add 3*Row2 to Row3, which was [0,0,-9,-27,12], it becomes:

Third element: -9 +3*1= -6
Fourth element: -27 +3*3= -27+9= -18
Fifth element: 12 +3*(-4/3)=12-4=8. So Row3 is [0,0,-6,-18,8].

Now, I can also eliminate the -6 in Row3 by adding 6 times Row2 to Row3:

Row3 = Row3 +6*Row2:
Third element: -6 +6*1=0
Fourth element: -18 +6*3= -18+18=0
Fifth element:8 +6*(-4/3)=8 -8=0

So Row3 becomes [0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that's better. So now, after this operation, the matrix becomes:

Row1: [1, 2, 3, 4, -3]
Row2: [0, 0, 1, 3, -4/3]
Row3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Wait, that's better. So now, we have two non-zero rows: Row1 and Row2. So does that mean the rank is 2?

Wait, but I think I might have made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check. Because when I scaled Row2, I might have confused the steps.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me try again without scaling Row2 yet.

Original matrix after first set of operations:

Row1: [1,2,3,4,-3]
Row2: [0,0,-3,-9,4]
Row3: [0,0,-9,-27,12]
Row4: [0,0,-12,-36,16]

Now, I can take Row2 as the pivot for the second column (but actually, it's the third column now). The pivot is -3. Let's make it 1 by dividing Row2 by -3:

Row2 becomes [0,0,1,3,-4/3]

Now, I can eliminate the elements below this pivot in the third column.

Row3's third element is -9, so I can add 9 times Row2 to Row3:

Row3 = Row3 +9*Row2:

0 +0=0
0+0=0
-9 +9*1=0
-27 +9*3= -27+27=0
12 +9*(-4/3)=12 -12=0

So Row3 becomes [0,0,0,0,0]

Similarly, for Row4, its third element is -12. So I add 12 times Row2 to Row4:

Row4 = Row4 +12*Row2:

0 +0=0
0+0=0
-12 +12*1=0
-36 +12*3= -36+36=0
16 +12*(-4/3)=16 -16=0

So Row4 becomes [0,0,0,0,0]

Now, the matrix looks like:

Row1: [1,2,3,4,-3]
Row2: [0,0,1,3,-4/3]
Row3: [0,0,0,0,0]
Row4: [0,0,0,0,0]

Now, let's look at Row1. The leading 1 is in column 1. Now, I can use Row2 as the next pivot in column3. But perhaps I should also eliminate the third column elements above the pivot if possible. But in this case, only Row1 has a non-zero element in column3. Wait, no, because Row1's third element is 3. So maybe I can eliminate that by subtracting 3 times Row2 from Row1.

Row1 = Row1 -3*Row2:

1 -0=1
2 -0=2
3 -3*1=0
4 -3*3=4-9=-5
-3 -3*(-4/3)= -3 +4=1

So Row1 becomes [1,2,0,-5,1]

Now the matrix is:

Row1: [1,2,0,-5,1]
Row2: [0,0,1,3,-4/3]
Row3: [0,0,0,0,0]
Row4: [0,0,0,0,0]

Now, in this form, we have two non-zero rows, which suggests the rank is 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the rank might be higher. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the row operations. Let me recount the steps.

Wait, after the initial steps, I had:

Row1: [1,2,3,4,-3]
Row2: [0,0,-3,-9,4]
Row3: [0,0,-9,-27,12]
Row4: [0,0,-12,-36,16]

Then I divided Row2 by -3 to get [0,0,1,3,-4/3]

Then, adding 9*Row2 to Row3:

Row3: [0,0,0,0,0]

Similarly, adding 12*Row2 to Row4:

Row4: [0,0,0,0,0]

So after these operations, Rows3 and 4 are zero rows.

Then, I used Row2 as a pivot and subtracted 3*Row2 from Row1 to eliminate the third column.

Row1 becomes [1,2,0,-5,1]

So now, the non-zero rows are Row1 and Row2, so rank is 2.

Wait, but I think I might have missed something because I remember that sometimes there can be more pivots. Let me try to see if there's another pivot in a different column.

Looking at Row1 and Row2, after the operations, they are:

Row1: [1,2,0,-5,1]
Row2: [0,0,1,3,-4/3]

So, in Row1, the leading 1 is in column1, and in Row2, it's in column3. So that's two pivots, meaning rank is 2.

But wait, in the original matrix, the first two rows are:

[1,2,3,4,-3]
[1,2,0,-5,1]

If I subtract Row1 from Row2, I get:

Row2: [0,0,-3,-9,4]

Which we did, and then after scaling, it became [0,0,1,3,-4/3]

So, after these operations, we have two leading 1s, so rank 2.

But wait, let me check if Rows 1 and 2 are linearly independent. Yes, because they can't be multiples of each other.

Alternatively, maybe I should check the determinant of a 2x2 minor to confirm if the rank is at least 2. But for a 4x5 matrix, the rank can't be more than 4, and with two non-zero rows, it's 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should look for the number of non-zero rows after full row reduction.

Wait, in the reduced form, I have two non-zero rows, so the rank is 2. So row rank is 2, and column rank is also 2. But looking at the options, option E is [2,3], H is [2,2], etc.

Wait, the options are:

A: [1,1]
B: [3,4]
C: [4,4]
D: [2,4]
E: [2,3]
F: [3,3]
G: [4,2]
H: [2,2]
I: [4,3]
J: [3,2]

Wait, but according to my calculation, both row and column rank are 2, so the answer would be [2,2], which is option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I perform row operations, I might have lost some information. Let me try another approach: calculating the determinant of all 3x3 minors to see if any are non-zero, which would indicate rank 3.

Wait, but for a 4x5 matrix, the maximum rank is 4, but if all 3x3 minors are zero, then the rank is less than 3. So let's compute a 3x3 minor.

Let me pick the first three rows and first three columns:

|1 2 3|
|1 2 0|
|2 4 -3|

Compute determinant:

1*(2*(-3) - 0*4) - 2*(1*(-3) -0*2) +3*(1*4 -2*2)

=1*(-6 -0) -2*(-3 -0) +3*(4 -4)

= (-6) -2*(-3) +3*(0)

= -6 +6 +0 = 0

So determinant is zero. So this minor is zero, so rank is less than 3.

Wait, but maybe another 3x3 minor could be non-zero. Let me try another set.

Take rows 1,2,3 and columns 1,3,4:

Matrix:
Row1: [1,3,4]
Row2: [1,0,-5]
Row3: [2,-3,-19]

Compute determinant:

1*(0*(-19) - (-5)*(-3)) -3*(1*(-19) - (-5)*2) +4*(1*(-3) -0*2)

=1*(0 -15) -3*(-19 +10) +4*(-3 -0)

= (-15) -3*(-9) +4*(-3)

= -15 +27 -12 = 0

Hmm, determinant is zero again. Let me try another minor.

How about rows 1,2,4 and columns 1,2,3:

Row1: [1,2,3]
Row2: [1,2,0]
Row4: [3,6,-3]

Compute determinant:

1*(2*(-3) -0*6) -2*(1*(-3) -0*3) +3*(1*6 -2*3)

=1*(-6 -0) -2*(-3 -0) +3*(6 -6)

= (-6) -2*(-3) +3*(0)

= -6 +6 +0 =0

Still zero. Maybe another one.

Take rows 2,3,4 and columns 3,4,5:

Row2: [0, -3, -9,4] Wait, but I'm selecting columns 3,4,5, which are columns 3,4,5.

Wait, for a 3x3 minor, I need 3 rows and 3 columns. Let me try columns 3,4,5 for rows 1,2,3.

Wait, rows 1,2,3 and columns 3,4,5:

Row1: [3,4,-3]
Row2: [0,-5,1]
Row3: [-3,-19,6]

Compute determinant:

3*( (-5)*6 -1*(-19) ) -4*(0*6 -1*(-3)) + (-3)*(0*(-19) - (-5)*(-3))

=3*(-30 +19) -4*(0 +3) + (-3)*(0 -15)

=3*(-11) -4*(3) + (-3)*(-15)

= -33 -12 +45 = 0

Still zero. Hmm, maybe all 3x3 minors are zero, implying the rank is less than 3, so rank is 2.

Wait, but let me check another minor. Let's take rows 1,2,4 and columns 3,4,5.

Row1: [3,4,-3]
Row2: [0,-5,1]
Row4: [-3,-24,7]

Compute determinant:

3*( (-5)*7 -1*(-24) ) -4*(0*7 -1*(-3)) + (-3)*(0*(-24) - (-5)*(-3))

=3*(-35 +24) -4*(0 +3) + (-3)*(0 -15)

=3*(-11) -4*(3) + (-3)*(-15)

= -33 -12 +45 = 0

Again zero. Hmm, maybe all 3x3 minors are zero, so rank is 2.

Wait, but let's check for 2x2 minors. Are there any non-zero 2x2 minors? For example, take rows 1 and 2, columns 1 and 2:

|1 2|
|1 2| → determinant is 1*2 -2*1= 2-2=0.

Another minor: rows 1 and 2, columns 1 and 3:

|1 3|
|1 0| → determinant is 1*0 -3*1= -3, which is non-zero. So there is a 2x2 minor with non-zero determinant, which means the rank is at least 2.

Since no 3x3 minors are non-zero, the rank is exactly 2.

So the row rank is 2, and the column rank is also 2. Therefore, the answer should be [2,2], which is option H.
</think>

To determine the row rank and column rank of the given matrix \( A \), we perform row operations to reduce it to row-echelon form. 

Starting with the matrix:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\
1 & 2 & 0 & -5 & 1 \\
2 & 4 & -3 & -19 & 6 \\
3 & 6 & -3 & -24 & 7
\end{pmatrix}
\]

1. Subtract Row 1 from Row 2:
   \[
   R2 \leftarrow R2 - R1 \Rightarrow [0, 0, -3, -9, 4]
   \]
2. Subtract \(2 \times\) Row 1 from Row 3:
   \[
   R3 \leftarrow R3 - 2R1 \Rightarrow [0, 0, -9, -27, 12]
   \]
3. Subtract \(3 \times\) Row 1 from Row 4:
   \[
   R4 \leftarrow R4 - 3R1 \Rightarrow [0, 0, -12, -36, 16]
   \]

The matrix becomes:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\
0 & 0 & -3 & -9 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & -9 & -27 & 12 \\
0 & 0 & -12 & -36 & 16
\end{pmatrix}
\]

4. Divide Row 2 by \(-3\):
   \[
   R2 \leftarrow \frac{R2}{-3} \Rightarrow [0, 0, 1, 3, -\frac{4}{3}]
   \]
5. Add \(9 \times\) Row 2 to Row 3:
   \[
   R3 \leftarrow R3 + 9R2 \Rightarrow [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   \]
6. Add \(12 \times\) Row 2 to Row 4:
   \[
   R4 \leftarrow R4 + 12R2 \Rightarrow [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   \]

The matrix now is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & -\frac{4}{3} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

7. Subtract \(3 \times\) Row 2 from Row 1:
   \[
   R1 \leftarrow R1 - 3R2 \Rightarrow [1, 2, 0, -5, 1]
   \]

The final row-echelon form is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & -5 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & -\frac{4}{3} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

There are 2 non-zero rows, so the **row rank** is 2. Since the row rank equals the column rank, the **column rank** is also 2.

Thus, the row rank and column rank of \( A \) are \([2, 2]\).

Answer: H
