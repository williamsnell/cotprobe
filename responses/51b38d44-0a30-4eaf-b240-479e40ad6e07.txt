Question:

If, after a conditioned response has been acquired, the procedureis changed so that the CS is repeatedly presented withoutbeing followed by the UCS, what is the result ?

Options:

A: Intermittent reinforcement of the conditioned response
B: Habituation to the conditioned stimulus
C: Transformation of conditioned respondent behavior
D: Emergence of a new unconditioned response
E: No change in conditioned respondent behavior
F: Increased resistance to extinction
G: Strengthening of conditioned respondent behavior

Okay, I'm trying to answer this psychology question about conditioned responses. Let's see what the question says. So, after a conditioned response has been acquired, the procedure is changed so that the conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly presented without being followed by the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). What happens then?

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a conditioned response is learned, it's because the CS (like a bell in Pavlov's experiment) reliably predicts the UCS (like food). But what happens if the CS is presented without the UCS?

I think this is about extinction. Extinction occurs when the CS is presented multiple times without the UCS. The dog would initially salivate upon hearing the bell, but after several times without food, the salivation response would decrease. So the conditioned response weakens over time.

Looking at the options, option I is extinction of the conditioned response. That makes sense because the CS is no longer paired with the UCS, so the association starts to fade.

Other options don't fit as well. Option A talks about intermittent reinforcement, but here there's no UCS, so no reinforcement. Option B is habituation, which is about a response diminishing because of repeated exposure, but that's more about the stimulus itself, not the conditioned response. Option C is about transforming behavior, which doesn't seem right. Option D is about a new unconditioned response, which doesn't apply here. Option E says no change, but extinction is a change. Option F is about resistance to extinction, which is the opposite of what's happening. Option G is strengthening, which isn't the case here. Option H is spontaneous recovery, which is when the response comes back after extinction, but that's not what's being asked. Option J is generalization, which is when the response occurs to similar stimuli, but that's not the scenario here.

So the correct answer should be I: Extinction of conditioned respondent behavior.

The correct answer is I: Extinction of conditioned respondent behavior.

The reasoning is that when the conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), the conditioned response (CR) weakens or extinguishes because the association between CS and UCS is no longer reinforced.

Answer: I
