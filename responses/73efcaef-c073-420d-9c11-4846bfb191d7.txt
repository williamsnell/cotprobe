Question:

The board of a state university has adopted the following rule concerning residency requirements:"A student will be considered a legal resident of the state for the purpose of registering at the university if such person is over the age of 21 and has established a legal residence in the state for at least one year next preceding the last day of registration for credit. "A student moved to the state and immediately enrolled at the state university. Since he did not fulfill the university residency requirement, the student was required to pay $1,800 tuition each semester, which was $400 more than the tuition of state resident-students. In an action by the student challenging the constitutionality of the provision governing the determination of residency for the purpose of fixing a fee differential for out-of-state students in public college, the court will most likely declare the provision

Options:

A: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: constitutional, because the fee differential promotes a compelling state interest.
C: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.
D: constitutional, because it is within the university's rights to set tuition fees.
E: constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.
F: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
G: unconstitutional, because it discriminates against out-of-state students.
H: unconstitutional, because it infringes upon the student's right to education.
I: constitutional, because it serves a legitimate state interest in encouraging state residency.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with residency requirements for tuition at a state university. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about whether a certain state law or university rule is constitutional. The rule says that to be considered a legal resident, you have to be over 21 and have established a legal residence in the state for at least one year before the last day of registration. A student moved to the state, enrolled right away, and because he didn't meet the residency requirement, he had to pay higher tuition. The student is challenging the constitutionality of this provision.

First, I need to figure out which part of the Constitution this might affect. The options mention the Equal Protection Clause, Privileges and Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and others. I remember that when states impose differential fees or treatment based on residency, they often run into issues under the Equal Protection Clause because it can discriminate against non-residents.

The Equal Protection Clause is part of the Fourteenth Amendment and says that states must treat all people equally. So if a state charges out-of-state students more, they have to show that it's not just discriminating but has a legitimate reason, usually through a compelling interest and using the least restrictive means. But wait, for residency requirements in education, the standard might be different. I think the Supreme Court has held that states can charge higher tuition to out-of-state students because they're not contributing as much in state taxes, but there's a line to be careful about.

Looking at the options, option A says it's unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. Option C mentions the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2. That clause prohibits states from treating citizens of other states differently unless there's a substantial reason. So, if the residency requirement is based solely on being an out-of-state student, it might violate that. But I'm not as sure about this one.

Another angle: the Privileges and Immunities Clause (often called the "Comity" clause) in Article IV, Section 2. It says that states must grant "privileges and immunities" to citizens of other states. If the state is imposing a fee that's significantly higher for out-of-staters, maybe that's a violation. But I'm not certain how this applies in the context of higher education.

Option B talks about a compelling state interest. The state's interest in having in-state students who contribute through taxes is valid, but does it meet the 'compelling' standard? I think for strict scrutiny, which applies when a law burdens a fundamental right or suspect classification, the state needs a compelling interest. But in this case, the issue is whether the classification is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause. I think courts have generally upheld tuition differentials, especially for out-of-state students, because they're not residents and the state's universities are supported by state funds from residents.

Option E says it's constitutional because it doesn't trigger strict scrutiny. That makes sense because residency-based fees are usually subject to rational basis review, not strict scrutiny. So if the state has a legitimate reason, like the cost of providing education to those who contribute through taxes, it might pass. But wait, the Privileges and Immunities Clause might require a different analysis.

Option C: violation of Privileges and Immunities. I think the Supreme Court case of Toomer v. Witsell (1979) involved commercial fishermen from other states and whether a state could impose higher fees. But education is a different context. Another case is the Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commission of Montana (1978), where elk hunting fees were higher for non-residents. The Court said that's okay because it's a legitimate use of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, as the state has a strong interest in managing its resources and the differential wasn't excessive.

In the context of tuition, the state's interest in keeping tuition lower for its residents who fund the university through taxes is valid. So, the fee differential is based on residency, not citizenship per se, so it might not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it's about residency, which is a legitimate classification.

Wait, but the student moved to the state and enrolled immediately. The rule requires being a resident for at least a year prior. So the challenge is whether the one-year requirement is too long or discriminates against new residents. But the question is about the constitutionality of the provision as a whole, not the duration.

So, the main issue is whether the state can charge higher tuition to out-of-state students. The Supreme Court case of Dunn v. Blumstein (1972) involved Tennessee's residency requirement for voting, but it's about Equal Protection. Another case, National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Tarkanian (1990), but that's about due process in university discipline.

Wait, the key case might be the " residents" in state colleges. The Court has held that states can charge higher tuition to non-residents because they are not taxpayers supporting the state university. For example, in the case of Vlandic v. Kusick (1973), the Court upheld a tuition differential because it was based on residency, not citizenship, and the state had a legitimate interest in keeping costs lower for its residents.

So, applying this to the question, the fee differential is constitutional because it's based on residency, which is a permissible classification under the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore, the court would likely find it constitutional because it serves a legitimate state interest, not because it's a violation of equal protection.

Looking at the options again:

A: unconstitutional under Equal Protection. I don't think so because the Court has allowed residency-based tuition.

B: constitutional because of compelling interest. Maybe, but the state doesn't need a compelling interest under the rational basis test for tuition.

C: unconstitutional under Privileges and Immunities. I think this is less likely because the case law supports differential tuition as permissible.

E: constitutional because no strict scrutiny. That's correct because strict scrutiny applies to suspect classifications or fundamental rights. Residency isn't a suspect classification, so rational basis applies, and the state's interest is legitimate.

I: constitutional because it encourages residency. This also seems correct as a reason, but E is more about the standard of review.

Wait, E says "the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny." That's accurate because the state isn't infringing on a fundamental right here, so strict scrutiny isn't required. Rational basis review applies, and the state's interest in having residents pay lower tuition is legitimate.

So the correct answer would be E: constitutional because it does not trigger strict scrutiny.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a state university's residency requirement for tuition purposes. The rule mandates that students must establish residency for at least one year prior to enrollment to qualify for in-state tuition. The student in question moved to the state and enrolled immediately, thus being classified as an out-of-state student and required to pay higher tuition fees. The issue is whether this provision violates constitutional protections.

The analysis focuses on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from discriminating without a legitimate reason. However, courts have generally upheld residency-based tuition differentials under rational basis review, as states have a legitimate interest in supporting their universities through the taxes of in-state residents. The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2, which prohibits states from discriminating against out-of-state citizens, is less applicable here because the classification is based on residency, not citizenship.

The correct answer is that the provision is constitutional because it does not trigger strict scrutiny. Residency is not a suspect classification, and the state's interest in maintaining lower tuition for residents is legitimate, meeting the lower standard of rational basis review.

Answer: E
