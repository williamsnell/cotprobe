Okay, so I've got this question about the kinked demand curve, and I'm trying to figure out which option is incorrect. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the kinked demand curve model is used in oligopoly markets, where a few firms dominate. The idea is that each firm's demand curve has a kink at the point where the price equals marginal cost. This kink arises because firms expect that if one firm raises its price above marginal cost, others won't follow, leading to a loss in market share. Conversely, if a firm lowers its price below marginal cost, others are expected to follow, causing an increase in market share.

Looking at the options:

A: There is no price leader.
Hmm, I think in the kinked demand model, there isn't a single price leader. Instead, each firm assumes that others will follow their price changes. So A might be correct, but I'm not sure yet.

B: There are relatively equal shares of the market.
Yes, the model assumes that all firms have roughly the same market share. If one firm changes its price, others are expected to match it because they have significant market power themselves. So B sounds correct.

C: Price is greater than marginal costs.
I believe that in the kinked demand scenario, the price is set above marginal costs. Firms don't lower prices below marginal costs because they expect others to follow, leading to a price war. So C is correct.

D: The demand curve is of one continuous function.
Wait, the kinked demand curve has a kink, meaning it's not a smooth, continuous curve. It has a bend where the slope changes. So D would be incorrect because the demand isn't a single continuous functionâ€”it's actually two different segments meeting at the kink point.

So putting it all together, the incorrect statement is D.

The kinked demand curve model assumes oligopoly conditions with equal market shares, no price leader, and pricing above marginal costs. The demand curve itself is not a single continuous function but has a kink, making D incorrect.

Answer: D
