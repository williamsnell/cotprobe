Okay, so I have this question about cognitive-behavioral therapy, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking about the goal of CBT, and the options are from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that cognitive-behavioral therapy is a type of psychological treatment. I've heard it's used for various mental health issues like anxiety and depression. From what I know, CBT focuses on how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. The idea is that changing negative thought patterns can lead to positive changes in behavior and emotions.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

A: Enhance physical strength. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. CBT is more about mental and emotional aspects, not physical strength. Maybe something like exercise would be for physical strength.

B: Reward good behavior. While reinforcement is a concept in psychology, I don't think that's the main goal of CBT. It's more about changing thought patterns rather than just rewarding behaviors.

C: Develop artistic skills. That seems unrelated. CBT is about mental health, not about teaching art.

D: Increase emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is about understanding and managing emotions. CBT does touch on emotions, but I think the primary goal is more about changing thoughts and behaviors.

E: Maximize athletic performance. No, that's more about sports psychology, not CBT.

F: Improve memory retention. Memory isn't the main focus of CBT. It's more about how we process and respond to situations.

G: Achieve stoic wisdom. Stoicism is a philosophy about accepting the things you can't control, but I'm not sure if that's the goal of CBT. Maybe a part of it, but not the main goal.

H: Promote spiritual growth. CBT is secular and focuses on practical, evidence-based approaches, so I don't think promoting spirituality is its goal.

I: Build grit. Grit is about perseverance and passion, which might be a byproduct, but I don't think that's the primary aim of CBT.

Wait, let me think again. The main goal of CBT is to identify and change negative thought patterns that lead to unhealthy behaviors. By doing so, the person can feel better and behave more adaptively. So the goal is more about changing thoughts and behaviors to improve overall psychological health.

Looking at the options again, D is about emotional intelligence. While CBT does help with emotions, I'm not sure if increasing emotional intelligence is the primary goal. Alternatively, maybe the goal is more about developing healthier ways of thinking and behaving, which could relate to emotional intelligence but perhaps isn't the exact wording.

Wait, another thought: Stoic wisdom (G) might involve accepting things, but I don't think that's the main goal. The core of CBT is about challenging and changing cognitive distortions, not necessarily about stoicism.

So, the correct answer should be D: increase emotional intelligence? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me recall: CBT aims to help individuals identify and change maladaptive thought patterns, which can improve their emotional responses and behaviors. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions. So, by improving thoughts, CBT might indirectly increase emotional intelligence, but is that the primary goal?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is not listed. Wait, the options are A to I, so I have to choose from them. Let me check if I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: The question is about the goal. The primary goal is to identify and modify dysfunctional thought patterns and behaviors. So, the goal isn't just about emotions or behaviors; it's about the cognitive aspect. So, looking back, option D is about emotional intelligence, which is more about emotions. But the key point is that CBT is about changing thoughts and behaviors to improve emotions.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what each option really means. The options are:

A: physical strength – no.

B: reward good behavior – perhaps operant conditioning, but not CBT.

C: artistic skills – no.

D: increase emotional intelligence – maybe, but is that the goal?

E: athletic performance – no.

F: memory – no.

G: stoic wisdom – possibly, but I don't think so.

H: spiritual growth – no.

I: build grit – maybe, but not the main goal.

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is D. Because by understanding and managing emotions better, which is part of emotional intelligence, CBT can help increase that. Or perhaps the answer is G, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The term "stoic wisdom" might relate to accepting things as they are, which is a part of some CBT techniques, like accepting things you can't change. But I'm not sure if that's the main goal.

Alternatively, the goal is to help people become more emotionally intelligent so they can handle their emotions better. So, perhaps D is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to recall some CBT principles. CBT aims to help individuals identify and change negative thoughts (cognitions) that lead to negative emotions and behaviors. So, the focus is on the cognitive aspect, but the outcome is better emotional and behavioral responses.

So, perhaps the goal is to develop healthier ways of thinking and behaving, which would improve emotional intelligence. So, D might be correct.

Alternatively, the answer might be G, but I'm not sure. Wait, stoic wisdom is about enduring hardships and accepting fate. I don't think that's the main aim of CBT.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: increase emotional intelligence. Because CBT helps people understand their emotions better, which is part of emotional intelligence.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F, but that's about memory, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between D and maybe another option. Wait, the options don't include something like 'change negative thought patterns.' So, perhaps none of the options directly state that, so I have to pick the closest.

I think the best fit is D: increase emotional intelligence. So, I'll go with D.

The goal of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is primarily focused on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to emotional distress. While CBT does touch on emotions and behaviors, its main aim is to improve psychological well-being by addressing cognitive distortions. Among the given options, the closest match is to increase emotional intelligence, as CBT helps individuals better understand and manage their emotions, which aligns with enhancing emotional intelligence.

Answer: D
