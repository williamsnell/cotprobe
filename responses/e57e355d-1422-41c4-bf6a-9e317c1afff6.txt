Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me break it down step by step. The question involves a sister and a brother who own a ranch as joint tenants. The sister transfers her interest via a quitclaim deed to her friend without the brother's knowledge. I need to determine what interest, if any, the friend has.

First, I remember that joint tenancy has specific characteristics. Joint tenants have equal shares in the property, and they have the right of survivorship. This means if one dies, the other automatically inherits their share. So, each joint tenant owns an undivided half, but their interest is subject to the right of survivorship.

Now, the sister is transferring her interest through a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time, without any warranties. It doesn't guarantee that the title is clear or that the grantor has a valid interest to transfer. It's often used in informal transfers or when the grantor wants to get rid of any potential claims against the property.

But wait, in joint tenancy, can one joint tenant transfer their interest without the others' consent? I think so, but the transfer affects their own interest. When a joint tenant conveys their interest, they can transfer their own share. However, since they hold as joint tenants, the transfer might convert the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common as to the transferred interest. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

So, if the sister transfers her interest via quitclaim, she's giving away her half. But because she's a joint tenant, she can only transfer her own share. The brother's share remains unaffected. So the friend would get her half, but since they were joint tenants, what does that mean for the friend's interest?

Wait, no. When a joint tenant transfers their interest, the new owner (friend) would become a tenant in common with the other joint tenant (brother), because joint tenancy requires all holders to have the right of survivorship, which is broken when one tenant transfers their interest. So the friend would hold an undivided half interest, but without the right of survivorship because the joint tenancy is severed.

Wait, but the question is about what interest the friend has. So the friend gets the sister's half, but as a tenant in common, not as a joint tenant. So the friend would have an undivided one-half interest, but not with the right of survivorship.

Looking at the options, option E says, "An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship." That seems correct. Because the friend now holds the sister's share as a tenant in common, not a joint tenant.

Option D is about an undivided half with right of survivorship, but that's not the case because the joint tenancy was severed when the sister transferred her interest.

Option G is tenancy in common with the brother, which would imply that the friend and brother are tenants in common. But the friend only holds the sister's share. So the brother's share remains his, and the friend's share is separate. So together, they are tenants in common, each owning a half. So the friend's interest is an undivided half without right of survivorship, which is option E.

Wait, but does the friend become a tenant in common, meaning the friend and brother each have a 50% interest, but no right of survivorship. So yes, the friend's interest is an undivided one-half without right of survivorship, which is E.

Alternatively, could it be G, tenancy in common with the brother? Because now both the brother and the friend are tenants in common. But the question is asking what interest the friend has, not the nature of their ownership together. So the friend's interest is an undivided half without right of survivorship, which is E.

Wait, but the original ownership was joint tenancy. When one joint tenant transfers their interest to a third party, the joint tenancy is severed, and the grantee (friend) becomes a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenant (brother). So the friend now holds an undivided one-half interest as a tenant in common, without the right of survivorship. So the correct answer is E.

The sister and brother own the ranch as joint tenants, meaning they each have an undivided half interest with the right of survivorship. When the sister transfers her interest via a quitclaim deed to her friend, she can only transfer her own half interest. However, this transfer severs the joint tenancy, converting the friend's interest into a tenancy in common with the brother. The friend now holds an undivided one-half interest in the ranch without the right of survivorship.
