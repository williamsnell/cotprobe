Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about an electron and a proton separated by a distance of 10^10 meters. I need to find the gravitational and electrostatic potential energy at the electron's position due to the proton. Plus, figure out the work required to move the electron to a separation of 5 x 10^10 meters. The options are given from A to J, each with different values for W_G and W_E, which I assume are the work done against gravity and electric fields respectively.

First, I remember that potential energy in gravitational and electric fields can be calculated using specific formulas. Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the gravitational potential energy (U_G). The formula for gravitational potential energy between two masses is U_G = - (G * M * m) / r, where G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two objects, and r is the separation distance.

Wait, but I also remember that gravitational potential energy is usually considered as the work done to bring the two masses from infinity to a distance r. But here, the question asks for the potential energy at the position of the electron due to the proton. So, I think we can calculate it using the same formula, but I should be careful about the sign.

The masses involved are the electron and the proton. The mass of a proton is about 1.67 x 10^-27 kg, and the electron is about 9.11 x 10^-31 kg. The gravitational constant G is 6.674 x 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2.

So plugging the numbers in: U_G = G * (m_p * m_e) / r. Wait, no, wait. Actually, since the proton is much heavier than the electron, but in the formula, it's M and m, so it's (M * m) / r. Wait, but when calculating the potential energy at the electron's position due to the proton, the formula is U = - (G * M * m_e) / r. Because the proton is stationary, and the electron is at that point.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the sign. The gravitational potential energy is negative because gravity is an attractive force. So when the electron is brought closer, work is done against gravity, hence positive work would be needed. Hmm, but the question is asking for the potential energy at that position, so that's U_G.

So let's compute U_G initially when r = 10^10 m, then when r is reduced to 5e10 m, and find the work done against gravity, which would be the change in potential energy.

Wait, no, the problem is asking for the potential energy at the initial position, not the change. But wait, the second part is about the work required to move the electron to a closer distance. So maybe I need to compute the potential energy at the initial position, then the potential energy at the final position, and the work done would be the difference between these two.

Wait, but wait, work done against the field would be the change in potential energy. So if I move the electron closer, the gravitational potential energy becomes more negative, so the work done by me (against the field) would be positive.

So first, let's compute U_G_initial = - G * m_p * m_e / r_initial.

Similarly, U_G_final = - G * m_p * m_e / r_final.

The work done against gravity, W_G, would be the final potential energy minus initial potential energy. So W_G = U_G_final - U_G_initial. Since U_G_final is more negative than U_G_initial (because r is smaller), the difference would be negative minus a less negative number, which is positive. So W_G = (U_G_final - U_G_initial) = [ (-G m_p m_e / r_final) - (-G m_p m_e / r_initial) ) ] = G m_p m_e (1/r_initial - 1/r_final).

Wait, but wait, when you move closer, the potential energy becomes more negative, so the change in potential energy is negative. But the work done against the field would be positive. So I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, I could think of it as the work done by me is the energy required to bring the electron from r_initial to r_final, which would be the difference in potential energies.

Alternatively, the work done against the gravitational field is equal to the negative of the change in gravitational potential energy. Because when you move against the field, you're doing positive work, which would make the potential energy more negative. So perhaps W_G = -(U_final - U_initial) = U_initial - U_final.

Wait, let me think: the gravitational potential energy U is defined as the work done by an external agent in bringing a mass from infinity to that point without acceleration. So if I move the electron from r_initial to r_final (closer), the change in potential energy is U_final - U_initial. Since U_final is more negative, U_final - U_initial is negative. The work done by me (external work) would be equal to U_final - U_initial. Wait, no, because when you move against the gravitational force, the work you do is positive and equals the change in potential energy.

Wait, maybe I should just compute the values numerically and see.

Similarly, the electrostatic potential energy U_E is given by Coulomb's law: U_E = k_e * (q1 q2) / r. But since the electron and proton have opposite charges, the potential energy will be negative. The charges are q_e = -1.6e-19 C and q_p = +1.6e-19 C. So U_E = k_e * (q_e q_p) / r.

Again, the work done against the electric field would be the change in potential energy when moving the electron to a closer position. So W_E = U_E_final - U_E_initial, but since the electron is negative, moving closer would make the potential energy more negative, so the change would be negative, meaning work done is positive. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the initial and final potential energies and find the difference.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the potential energy at the position of the electron, so that's U_G and U_E, not the work done. Wait, no, the first part is the potential energy, and the second part is the work required to move it closer.

Wait, no, the question says: "What is the gravitational and electrostatic potential energy due to the proton at the position of the electron? How much work is required against each field to move the electron to a position of separation 5 × 10^10 m?"

So first, compute the potential energies at r = 10^10 m, then compute the work done against each field to move the electron to r = 5e10 m.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, I think it's asking for the potential energy at the initial position, then the work done to change that position.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy at the initial position (r = 1e10 m) and then the work done to move to 5e10 m, which is moving closer, so the separation is halved.

Wait, no, 5e10 is half of 1e11, but in this case, the initial is 1e10, and the final is 5e10, which is moving the electron closer by a factor of 2.

Wait, no, 10^10 m is the same as 1e10 m. So moving from 1e10 to 5e10 is moving further apart? Wait no, 5e10 is 5 x 10^10, which is larger than 1e10 (which is 1 x 10^10). Wait, no, wait: 1e10 is 10^10 meters, and 5e10 is 5 x 10^10 meters, which is a larger separation. So moving from 1e10 m to 5e10 m is moving the electron further away. Hmm, that's interesting because that would make the potential energies less negative.

Wait, but the initial separation is 1e10 m, and the final is 5e10 m, so the separation is increasing. So the potential energies would become less negative because the distance is increasing.

Wait, but the question says "move the electron to a position of separation 5 × 10^10 m." So that's moving it further away, not closer. So the work done against the fields would be the change in potential energy.

But wait, if the electron is moving from a closer position to a farther one, then the gravitational and electric potential energies would be less negative, so their change would be positive. But since the fields are attractive (gravity and electric force are both attractive here, since proton and electron have opposite charges), moving away would mean you're moving against the gravitational and electric forces? Or are you moving with them?

Wait, no, the gravitational force between the proton and electron is attractive, so moving the electron away from the proton (increasing r) would require work done against the gravitational force because the force is pulling it back. Similarly, the electric force is also attractive because proton is positive and electron is negative. So moving the electron away would require work done against both forces.

Wait, but wait, the electric force between proton and electron is attractive, so if you're moving the electron away, the force is opposite to the direction of motion, so work is done against the electric field.

Similarly, the gravitational force is also attractive, so moving the electron away would require work against gravity.

So the work done would be positive, and the potential energies would increase (become less negative), so the change in potential energy would be positive.

Let me double-check. The potential energy U is negative for both gravitational and electric cases because they're bound systems. When you move the electron away, the potential energy becomes less negative, so the change in potential energy is positive. The work done against the fields would be equal to this positive change.

So the work done W is equal to the change in potential energy, which is U_final - U_initial. Since U_final is higher (less negative) than U_initial, the difference is positive, so W is positive.

So now, I can compute the initial potential energies, then compute the final ones, subtract initial from final, and get the work done.

Let me start with the gravitational potential energy.

Gravitational potential energy at r_initial = 1e10 m:

U_G_initial = - G * (m_p * m_e) / r_initial

Given:
G = 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg²
m_p = 1.67e-27 kg
m_e = 9.11e-31 kg
r_initial = 1e10 m

Plugging in:

U_G_initial = - (6.674e-11) * (1.67e-27 kg) * (9.11e-31 kg) / (1e10 m)

Let me compute the numerator first.

Compute 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 = approx ?

6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 = Let's compute 6.674 * 1.67 ≈ 11.15, so 11.15e-38.

Wait, 6.674e-11 times 1.67e-27 equals (6.674 * 1.67) x 10^(-11-27) = approx 11.15e-38.

Then multiply by 9.11e-31 kg:

11.15e-38 * 9.11e-31 = approx 101.5e-69, which is 1.015e-67.

Then divide by 1e10 m: 1.015e-67 / 1e10 = 1.015e-77.

So U_G_initial ≈ -1.015e-77 J.

Wait, that seems really small. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 = 6.674 * 1.67 = approx 11.15, then 10^(-11) * 10^(-27) = 10^(-38). So 11.15e-38.

Then, multiply by 9.11e-31: 11.15e-38 * 9.11e-31 = (11.15 * 9.11) x 10^(-38-31) = approx 101.5 x 10^(-69) = 1.015e-67.

Then divide by 1e10: 1.015e-67 / 1e10 = 1.015e-77.

So U_G_initial ≈ -1.015e-77 J.

Now, for the gravitational potential energy at r_final = 5e10 m.

U_G_final = - G m_p m_e / r_final = - (6.674e-11) * (1.67e-27) * (9.11e-31) / (5e10)

Wait, same numerator as before, 1.015e-67, but divided by 5e10.

So 1.015e-67 / 5e10 = 2.03e-78.

So U_G_final = -2.03e-78 J.

Wait, but wait, when the distance increases, the potential energy becomes less negative, so U_G_final is higher than U_G_initial. Because initially it was -1.015e-77 J, and after moving to 5e10 m, it's -2.03e-78 J, which is higher (less negative). So the change in potential energy is from -1.015e-77 to -2.03e-78, which is an increase of approximately 0.812e-77 J.

Wait, let me compute the exact difference:

U_G_final - U_G_initial = (-2.03e-78) - (-1.015e-77) = (-2.03e-78) + 1.015e-77 = 1.015e-77 - 0.203e-77 = 0.812e-77 J = 8.12e-78 J.

But wait, this is the change in gravitational potential energy. The work done against gravity, W_G, is equal to this change. So W_G = 8.12e-78 J.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, none of them are that small. The options have W_G in the order of 1e58 J, which is way bigger than 1e-78. So I'm clearly doing something wrong here.

Wait a second, maybe I mixed up the units somewhere. Let me double-check the exponents.

Wait, G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

m_p is 1.67e-27 kg.

m_e is 9.11e-31 kg.

r_initial is 1e10 m.

So U_G_initial = - G * m_p * m_e / r_initial.

Let me compute G * m_p * m_e first.

G = 6.674e-11.

m_p = 1.67e-27.

m_e = 9.11e-31.

Multiply them: 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 = (6.674 * 1.67) * 1e-38.

6.674 * 1.67 ≈ 11.15, so 11.15e-38.

Then multiply by 9.11e-31: 11.15e-38 * 9.11e-31 = (11.15 * 9.11) * 1e-69.

11.15 * 9.11 ≈ 101.7, so 101.7e-69 = 1.017e-67.

Now, divide by r_initial = 1e10 m: 1.017e-67 / 1e10 = 1.017e-77.

So U_G_initial ≈ -1.017e-77 J.

Similarly, U_G_final at r_final =5e10 m is:

1.017e-67 / 5e10 = 2.034e-78.

So U_G_final ≈ -2.034e-78 J.

The change in potential energy is U_G_final - U_G_initial = (-2.034e-78) - (-1.017e-77) = (-2.034e-78) + 1.017e-77 = (1.017e-77 - 0.2034e-77) = 0.8136e-77 J = 8.136e-78 J.

So W_G = 8.136e-78 J. But the options are in the order of 1e58 J, which is way larger. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me check again.

Wait, 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 is 6.674 * 1.67 = approx 11.15, and the exponents are 10^-11 * 10^-27 = 10^-38. So that's 11.15e-38.

Then multiply by 9.11e-31: 11.15e-38 * 9.11e-31 = 11.15 * 9.11 = approx 101.7, and exponents: 10^-38 * 10^-31 = 10^-69. So 101.7e-69 = 1.017e-67.

Divide by 1e10: 1.017e-67 / 1e10 = 1.017e-77. Correct.

But the options are in the 1e58 range, which is way bigger. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait! Wait a minute. I think I messed up the formula. The gravitational potential energy is U = - G M m / r, yes. But wait, M is the mass of the proton, m is the mass of the electron. So perhaps I should have used the mass of the proton as M and the mass of the electron as m.

Wait, but that's what I did. m_p is 1.67e-27 kg, and m_e is 9.11e-31 kg.

Wait, but maybe I should have considered the reduced mass or something else? No, I think the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the potential energy at the electron's position due to the proton, which would be the same as what I calculated. So why is there such a huge discrepancy in the orders of magnitude?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm calculating the wrong potential energy. Wait, perhaps I should be considering the gravitational potential energy as the work done by the proton's field on the electron, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The gravitational force between a proton and an electron is extremely weak compared to the electric force. So perhaps the problem is more about the electric potential energy, but the gravitational part is just a very small number. So why are the answer options showing W_G as 1e58 J? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_G. Let me try recalculating.

Compute G * m_p * m_e:

G = 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

m_p = 1.67e-27 kg.

m_e = 9.11e-31 kg.

So G * m_p * m_e = 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 * 9.11e-31.

Let me compute step by step:

First, 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 = 6.674 * 1.67 = approx 11.15, and exponents: 10^-11 * 10^-27 = 10^-38. So 11.15e-38.

Now multiply by 9.11e-31: 11.15e-38 * 9.11e-31 = 11.15 * 9.11 ≈ 101.7, exponents: 10^-38 * 10^-31 = 10^-69. So 101.7e-69 = 1.017e-67.

Divide by r_initial = 1e10: 1.017e-67 / 1e10 = 1.017e-77. So U_G_initial ≈ -1.017e-77 J.

Hmm, same result. So the change in potential energy when moving to 5e10 m is 8.136e-78 J, as before. But the options are way larger. So I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the potential energy when the electron is at the position, which would be the potential due to the proton, but perhaps I should consider the potential energy as the work done to bring the electron from infinity to that point. But in that case, the initial potential energy at infinity would be zero, so the potential energy at r would be U = - G m_p m_e / r.

Wait, but that's what I did. So why are the answer options so different? Maybe I'm making a mistake in the masses. Wait, perhaps I should have used the mass of the proton as M and the mass of the electron as m, but perhaps the formula considers M as the mass causing the potential, and m as the test mass. So perhaps I should have used M = m_p, and m = m_e. That's what I did.

Wait, maybe I should have used the mass of the proton as part of the system, but perhaps the mass of the electron is negligible. Wait, but in the formula, both masses are used because it's the product that matters.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the potential energy as the energy required to bring the proton and electron together from infinity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the gravitational potential energy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the potential energy per unit mass or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and should try to calculate the work done using the potential energy difference correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the work done against each field as the difference in potential energies.

So for the gravitational work done:

W_G = U_G_final - U_G_initial.

Since U_G_final is higher (less negative) than U_G_initial, W_G is positive.

Similarly, for the electric potential energy:

U_E_initial = k_e * (q_p * q_e) / r_initial.

q_p = +1.6e-19 C, q_e = -1.6e-19 C.

k_e = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) / (1e10).

Wait, so that's negative. Let's compute:

(8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) / 1e10.

First, 1.6e-19 * 1.6e-19 = 2.56e-38, but with a negative sign, so -2.56e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * (-2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28.

Divide by 1e10: -2.307e-28 / 1e10 = -2.307e-38 J.

So U_E_initial ≈ -2.307e-38 J.

At r_final =5e10 m, U_E_final = (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) / 5e10.

So that's 8.988e9 * (-2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28, divided by 5e10: -2.307e-28 /5e10 = -4.614e-39 J.

So the change in electric potential energy is U_E_final - U_E_initial = (-4.614e-39) - (-2.307e-38) = (-4.614e-39 + 2.307e-38) = (2.307e-38 - 0.4614e-38) = 1.8456e-38 J.

So the work done against the electric field, W_E, is 1.8456e-38 J.

But again, the options are in the order of 1e18 J, which is way larger. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents again. Let me recompute U_E_initial.

U_E_initial = k_e * (q_p * q_e) / r_initial.

k_e = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q_p = 1.6e-19 C.

q_e = -1.6e-19 C.

r_initial = 1e10 m.

So: U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) / 1e10.

Compute numerator: 1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19 = -2.56e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * (-2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28.

Divide by 1e10: -2.307e-28 / 1e10 = -2.307e-38 J.

So U_E_initial is -2.307e-38 J.

At r_final =5e10 m:

U_E_final = (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) / (5e10) = (8.988e9 * -2.56e-38) /5e10.

Which is (-2.307e-28) /5e10 = -4.614e-39 J.

So the change in electric potential energy is U_E_final - U_E_initial = (-4.614e-39) - (-2.307e-38) = (-4.614e-39 + 2.307e-38) = (2.307e-38 - 0.4614e-38) = 1.8456e-38 J.

So W_E = 1.8456e-38 J. Again, the options are way larger. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I misread the separation distance. The initial separation is 10^10 meters, which is 1e10 m, and the final is 5e10 m. Wait, no, 5e10 is 5 x 10^10 m, which is larger than 1e10 m. So the electron is moving away, so the potential energies become less negative, which means the work done is positive, as I did before.

But the options for W_G are around 1e58 J, which is way larger than my calculation of 8e-78 J, so I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the gravitational potential energy is not calculated correctly because I swapped the masses or used the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the mass of the Earth or something else, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question is asking for the potential energy due to the proton's field at the position of the electron, which would be the same as what I calculated, but perhaps I missed a factor of 1e18 or something. Wait, let me check the exponents again.

Wait, U_G_initial is -1.017e-77 J, which is 1e-77 J. The options are in 1e58 J. That's a difference of 1e135, which is huge. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the gravitational potential energy is multiplied by Avogadro's number or something, but that doesn't make sense here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of protons and electrons in a larger system, but the problem specifies a single proton and electron.

Wait, maybe I should have used the mass of the electron as part of the system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reduced mass for the gravitational potential energy, but that's not necessary here.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is expecting the potential energy to be calculated using the formula for gravitational potential energy as U = m * g * h, but that's for near Earth's surface and not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should try recalculating the gravitational work done.

Wait, the work done against gravity would be the difference in gravitational potential energies. So W_G = U_G_final - U_G_initial.

From before:

U_G_initial = -1.017e-77 J.

U_G_final = -2.034e-78 J.

So W_G = (-2.034e-78) - (-1.017e-77) = (-2.034e-78) + 1.017e-77 = 1.017e-77 - 0.2034e-77 = 0.8136e-77 J = 8.136e-78 J.

But the options are in the order of 1e58 J, which is way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the mass of the proton as M and the mass of the electron as m, but perhaps I forgot that the gravitational constant includes factors that I'm missing. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the gravitational acceleration, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question and the gravitational work is negligible compared to the electric work, but the options include both.

Wait, but the electric work I calculated is about 1.8456e-38 J, which is also way smaller than the options provided, which are in 1e18 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when calculating the electric potential energy. Let me recalculate U_E_initial.

U_E_initial = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (1.6e-19 C * -1.6e-19 C) / (1e10 m).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) = 8.988e9 * (-2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28.

Divided by 1e10 m: -2.307e-28 / 1e10 = -2.307e-38 J.

Same as before. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the electric potential energy as U = q * V, where V is the potential due to the proton at the position of the electron.

Wait, the electric potential V at the electron's position due to the proton is V = k_e * q_p / r.

Then, the electric potential energy U_E is q_e * V = q_e * (k_e q_p / r) = (k_e q_p q_e) / r, which is the same as before.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered the number of protons and electrons in a nucleus or something else, but the problem states a single proton and electron.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the mass of the Earth or another large mass, but no, it's a proton and an electron.

Wait, I'm stuck. Both gravitational and electric potential energies I calculated are orders of magnitude smaller than the options provided. The options for W_G are around 1e58 J, which is 1e135 times larger than my calculation. Similarly, W_E in options is around 1e18 J, which is 1e56 times larger than my calculation of ~1e-38 J.

I must have made a mistake in the exponents somewhere. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1e18 in the calculation. Let me try recalculating.

Wait, gravitational potential energy:

G = 6.674e-11.

m_p = 1.67e-27 kg.

m_e = 9.11e-31 kg.

So G * m_p * m_e = 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 * 9.11e-31.

Wait, 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 = 6.674 * 1.67 = approx 11.15, and exponents: 10^-11 * 10^-27 = 10^-38. So 11.15e-38.

Multiply by 9.11e-31: 11.15e-38 * 9.11e-31 = 11.15 * 9.11 ≈ 101.7, exponents: 10^-38 * 10^-31 = 10^-69. So 101.7e-69 = 1.017e-67.

Divide by r_initial = 1e10: 1.017e-67 / 1e10 = 1.017e-77 J.

Hmm, same result. So perhaps the problem expects the potential energy to be calculated using the mass of the Earth or another large mass, but the problem clearly states a proton and an electron.

Wait, perhaps the question intended the separation to be 1e-10 m instead of 1e10 m? Because 1e-10 m is a typical atomic scale distance, whereas 1e10 m is about 10 million kilometers, which is way beyond the Earth's orbit.

If I redo the calculation with r_initial = 1e-10 m, let's see what happens.

So U_G_initial = - G * m_p * m_e / r_initial.

r_initial = 1e-10 m.

So:

G * m_p * m_e = 6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 * 9.11e-31 = 1.017e-67 (same as before).

Divide by 1e-10: 1.017e-67 / 1e-10 = 1.017e-57 J.

So U_G_initial ≈ -1.017e-57 J.

At r_final = 5e-10 m:

U_G_final = -1.017e-57 / 5e-10 = -2.034e-58 J.

Change in U_G: U_G_final - U_G_initial = (-2.034e-58) - (-1.017e-57) = (-2.034e-58 + 1.017e-57) = (1.017e-57 - 0.2034e-57) = 0.8136e-57 J = 8.136e-58 J.

Hmm, still not matching the options. The options have W_G around 1e58 J, which is 1e58. My calculation with r_initial = 1e-10 gives W_G ≈8e-58 J, which is 1e-58, but the options are 1e58, which is 10^116 times larger. So that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the mass of the nucleus or something else, but the problem states a single proton and electron.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the mass of the Earth or another large mass, but that's not what's stated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reduced mass formula. The reduced mass mu = (m_p * m_e) / (m_p + m_e), but since m_e is much smaller than m_p, mu ≈ m_e. But I don't think that affects the result significantly.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the question is asking for the potential energy at the surface of the proton, which is about 1e-15 m, but that's not what's stated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the gravitational potential energy is U = - (G * M * m) / r, but perhaps I should have used the total energy, including kinetic, but no, the question asks for potential energy.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to compute the electric potential energy again.

Electric potential energy:

U_E_initial = k_e * (q_p * q_e) / r_initial.

With r_initial =1e10 m:

U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) / 1e10.

Which is (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) / 1e10 = (-2.307e-28) / 1e10 = -2.307e-38 J.

At r_final =5e10 m:

U_E_final = (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) /5e10 = (-2.307e-28) /5e10 = -4.614e-39 J.

Change in U_E: (-4.614e-39) - (-2.307e-38) = (-4.614e-39 + 2.307e-38) = 1.8456e-38 J.

So W_E = 1.8456e-38 J.

But the options have W_E in the order of 1e18 J. So 1.8456e-38 J is way smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the electric potential energy. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the charge of the proton as +e and the electron as -e, so q_p = 1.6e-19 C, q_e = -1.6e-19 C.

So U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) / (1e10).

Which is (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) /1e10.

Compute 8.988e9 * (-2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28.

Divide by 1e10: -2.307e-28 /1e10 = -2.307e-38 J.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong sign convention, but the work done should be positive as we're moving against the field.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the magnitude, so the work done is 2.307e-38 J, but the options are way larger.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one has W_G and W_E in the correct ratio relative to each other. From my calculations, W_G is about 8e-78 J and W_E is about 1.8e-38 J. But the options have both W_G and W_E in the 1e58 and 1e18 ranges. There's a factor of 1e136 between W_G and the options. That suggests I made a mistake in the exponent somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1e18 in the calculation. Let me think: If I take my W_G of 8e-78 J and multiply by 1e136, I get 8e58 J, which matches option B (8.3e58 J) and others.

Wait, where could I have missed a factor of 1e136? That seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when calculating G * m_p * m_e.

Wait, G is 6.674e-11, m_p is 1.67e-27, m_e is 9.11e-31.

So:

6.674e-11 * 1.67e-27 = 6.674 * 1.67 = 11.15, exponents: 10^-11 *10^-27=10^-38. So 11.15e-38.

11.15e-38 *9.11e-31 = 11.15 *9.11 ≈101.7, exponents:10^-38 *10^-31=10^-69. So 101.7e-69 =1.017e-67.

Divide by r=1e10: 1.017e-67 /1e10=1.017e-77.

Wait, but 1e-77 *1e136=1e59, which is larger than the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the mass of the Earth or another large mass, but the problem specifies a proton and an electron.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the mass of the nucleus, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the mass of the Sun, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the mass of the proton as 1.67e-27 kg and the mass of the electron as 9.11e-31 kg, but perhaps I should have considered the number of particles, like per mole, but the problem doesn't state that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the gravitational potential energy in a different way, such as using the formula for gravitational potential energy between two extended objects, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the gravitational potential energy is not just between the proton and electron but in a different context, but I can't think of what else.

At this point, I'm stuck and not sure where I went wrong. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options given. The gravitational work done is much larger than the electric work done in the options, but in reality, the electric work is larger than the gravitational work by many orders of magnitude. However, in the options, both W_G and W_E are present, with W_G being around 1e58 and W_E around 1e18.

Looking at the options, option B has W_G =8.3e58 J and W_E=1.99e18 J. Option C is W_G=8.2e58, W_E=1.75e18. Option H is W_G=8.1e58, W_E=1.84e18.

Given that my calculation of W_E is about 1.8e-38 J, which is way off, but perhaps the problem intended to use a different distance, like 1e-10 m, which would make the electric potential energy much larger.

If I recalculate U_E_initial with r_initial =1e-10 m:

U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) / 1e-10.

Which is (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) /1e-10 = (8.988e9 * -2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28 /1e-10 = -2.307e-18 J.

At r_final=5e-10 m:

U_E_final = (8.988e9 * -2.56e-38) /5e-10 = (-2.307e-28) /5e-10 = -4.614e-19 J.

Change in U_E: (-4.614e-19) - (-2.307e-18) = (-4.614e-19 +2.307e-18) = 1.8456e-18 J.

So W_E =1.8456e-18 J, which is approximately 1.85e-18 J. Looking at the options, option H has W_E=1.84e18 J, which is 1e18, but I have 1.85e-18 J. So the magnitude is correct, but the exponent is off by 36 orders of magnitude. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when r is in 1e-10 m. Let me recompute U_E_initial with r_initial=1e-10 m:

U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) / (1e-10).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * (-2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28.

Divide by 1e-10: -2.307e-28 /1e-10 = -2.307e-18 J.

At r_final=5e-10 m:

U_E_final = (8.988e9 * -2.56e-38) /5e-10 = (-2.307e-28) /5e-10 = -4.614e-19 J.

Change in U_E: (-4.614e-19) - (-2.307e-18) = (-4.614e-19 +2.307e-18) = 1.8456e-18 J.

So W_E=1.8456e-18 J.

Looking at the options, option H has W_E=1.84e18 J, which is 1e18, but I have 1e-18. So perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the separation is 1e-10 m instead of 1e10 m. Then, W_E would be approximately 1.84e-18 J, but none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps the separation is 1e-10 m, and the work done is 1.84e18 J, which would require moving from 1e-10 m to 5e-10 m, but that's moving away, so the potential energy becomes less negative, which would make W_E positive as calculated.

But I'm getting W_E=1.84e-18 J, which is not matching any options. So perhaps I should consider that the problem intended the separation to be 1e-10 m, making the electric work done about 1.84e-18 J, but the options have it as 1e18 J, which is 1e18.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, when r_initial =1e-10 m, U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19 * -1.6e-19) /1e-10.

Which is (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) /1e-10.

Compute 8.988e9 * (-2.56e-38) = -2.307e-28.

Divide by 1e-10: -2.307e-28 /1e-10 = -2.307e-18 J.

At r_final=5e-10 m:

U_E_final = (8.988e9 * -2.56e-38) /5e-10 = (-2.307e-28) /5e-10 = -4.614e-19 J.

Change in U_E = (-4.614e-19) - (-2.307e-18) = (-4.614e-19 +2.307e-18) = 1.8456e-18 J.

So W_E=1.8456e-18 J.

But the options have W_E around 1e18 J. So perhaps the problem intended to use r_initial =1e-18 m instead. Let me try that.

r_initial=1e-18 m.

U_E_initial = (8.988e9) * (-2.56e-38) /1e-18 = (-2.307e-28) /1e-18 = -2.307e-10 J.

At r_final=5e-18 m:

U_E_final = (-2.307e-28) /5e-18 = -4.614e-11 J.

Change in U_E = (-4.614e-11) - (-2.307e-10) = (-4.614e-11 +2.307e-10) = 1.8456e-10 J.

So W_E=1.8456e-10 J, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the separation to be 1e-10 m, and the work done is 1.84e18 J, which would require a different calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm making a mistake and look for the option where W_E is around 1.8e18 J.

Looking at the options, option H has W_E=1.84e18 J, which is close to my hypothetical calculation if I had a mistake in the exponents. So perhaps the correct answer is option H: W_G=8.1e58 J and W_E=1.84e18 J.

But I'm not confident because my calculations don't align. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: W_G=8.3e58 J, W_E=1.99e18 J.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the gravitational work done is much larger than the electric work done, which is counterintuitive because the electric force is much stronger. But in terms of potential energy, perhaps the problem expects the gravitational work to be larger, which is not the case in reality.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the mass of the Earth or another large mass, but without more information, I can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll make an educated guess based on the closest matching option for W_E. From my calculation with r_initial=1e-10 m, W_E=1.84e-18 J, but the options have W_E=1.84e18 J, which is 1e18. So perhaps the intended answer is option H: W_G=8.1e58 J, W_E=1.84e18 J.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the gravitational and electrostatic potential energies between a proton and an electron separated by \(10^{10} \, \text{m}\) and determining the work required to move the electron to \(5 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m}\). The gravitational potential energy \(U_G\) is given by:

\[
U_G = -\frac{G M m}{r}
\]

where \(G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2\), \(M = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) (proton mass), \(m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\) (electron mass), and \(r\) is the separation distance. The electrostatic potential energy \(U_E\) is:

\[
U_E = \frac{k_e q_p q_e}{r}
\]

where \(k_e = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\), \(q_p = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\), and \(q_e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\).

### Gravitational Potential Energy
For \(r = 10^{10} \, \text{m}\):

\[
U_{G,\text{initial}} = -\frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11})(1.67 \times 10^{-27})(9.11 \times 10^{-31})}{10^{10}} \approx -1.017 \times 10^{-77} \, \text{J}
\]

For \(r = 5 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m}\):

\[
U_{G,\text{final}} = -\frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11})(1.67 \times 10^{-27})(9.11 \times 10^{-31})}{5 \times 10^{10}} \approx -2.034 \times 10^{-78} \, \text{J}
\]

The work done against gravity is the difference:

\[
W_G = U_{G,\text{final}} - U_{G,\text{initial}} \approx (-2.034 \times 10^{-78}) - (-1.017 \times 10^{-77}) \approx 8.136 \times 10^{-78} \, \text{J}
\]

### Electrostatic Potential Energy
For \(r = 10^{10} \, \text{m}\):

\[
U_{E,\text{initial}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(-1.6 \times 10^{-19})}{10^{10}} \approx -2.307 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{J}
\]

For \(r = 5 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m}\):

\[
U_{E,\text{final}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(-1.6 \times 10^{-19})}{5 \times 10^{10}} \approx -4.614 \times 10^{-39} \, \text{J}
\]

The work done against the electric field is the difference:

\[
W_E = U_{E,\text{final}} - U_{E,\text{initial}} \approx (-4.614 \times 10^{-39}) - (-2.307 \times 10^{-38}) \approx 1.8456 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{J}
\]

### Analysis of Options
The calculated values for \(W_G\) and \(W_E\) are orders of magnitude smaller than the options provided. However, based on the closest match for \(W_E\) (\(1.84 \times 10^{18} \, \text{J}\)) and the corresponding \(W_G\) (\(8.1 \times 10^{58} \, \text{J}\)), the most plausible answer is:

**H: \(W_G = 8.1 \times 10^{58} \, \text{J}, W_E = 1.84 \times 10^{18} \, \text{J}\)**

ANSWER: H
