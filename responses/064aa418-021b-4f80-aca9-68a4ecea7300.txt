Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about ImageNet and Caltech-101 datasets. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question has two statements. I need to evaluate each one and then determine which option (A to D) correctly labels them as true or false.

Statement 1 says, "ImageNet has images of various resolutions." From what I remember, ImageNet is a large dataset widely used in computer vision. I think it's known for having high-quality images, and I believe they come in different resolutions. I'm pretty sure that ImageNet includes a lot of images at varying sizes, not just one fixed resolution. So, Statement 1 should be true.

Now, Statement 2 claims, "Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet." Wait, Caltech-101 is another dataset I've heard of. I think Caltech-101 is a smaller dataset compared to ImageNet. If I recall correctly, Caltech-101 has around 80,000 images across 101 categories. On the other hand, ImageNet has millions of images, maybe around 15 million or so. So, ImageNet definitely has more images than Caltech-101. That would make Statement 2 false because Caltech-101 doesn't have more images than ImageNet.

So, putting it together: Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. Now looking at the options, option B is "True, False," which matches my evaluation. So the correct answer should be B.

The first statement is true because ImageNet includes images of various resolutions. The second statement is false because Caltech-101 has fewer images than ImageNet.

Answer: B
