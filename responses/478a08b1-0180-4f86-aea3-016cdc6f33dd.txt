D: Absolute advantage is when a country's products are in higher demand globally than another's.
E: Absolute advantage exists when one nation can produce a good more cheaply and efficiently than another.
F: Absolute advantage is when a country has a more skilled workforce than another.
G: Absolute advantage is when a country can produce a wider variety of goods than another.
H: Absolute advantage is when a country has trade agreements with more nations than another.
I: Absolute advantage is when a country has a higher GDP than another.
J: Absolute advantage is when a country has more advanced technology in all sectors than another.

Okay, so I need to figure out what absolute advantage means. I remember from my economics class that absolute advantage has something to do with production. Let me think. Absolute advantage is when a country can produce more of a good or service than another country, given the same resources. Wait, no, maybe it's about producing at a lower cost or using fewer resources. 

Looking at the options, option A says it's determined by population size. That doesn't sound right because absolute advantage isn't just about how many people you have. Option B mentions using fewer hours of labor, but does it matter if they're more efficient? I think absolute advantage is more about the total output, not just time. Option C talks about more resources, but I'm not sure if having more resources directly translates to absolute advantage.

Option D says higher global demand for products. That sounds more like comparative advantage or maybe export success, not absolute advantage. Option E says producing more cheaply and efficiently. Hmm, that might be part of it, but I think absolute advantage is more about the total output rather than the cost. Option F is about a more skilled workforce, which affects productivity but isn't the definition of absolute advantage itself.

Option G is about producing a wider variety of goods. I don't think that's it either. Option H mentions trade agreements, which relates to trade terms but not production capability. Option I is about higher GDP, which is a broader measure of economic size but not specifically about producing a particular good more efficiently. Option J is about having more advanced technology in all sectors, which would give a production edge but is more about technological superiority than the definition.

Wait, going back, absolute advantage is when a country can produce a good more efficiently, meaning using fewer resources or producing more output per unit of input. So option E says "more cheaply and efficiently," which seems close. But I think the key point is the ability to produce more, regardless of cost. Or maybe it's about producing the same amount with fewer resources. 

Oh, I think I remember now. Absolute advantage is when a country can produce a higher quantity of a good with the same amount of resources. So, for example, if Country A can produce 100 units of wheat with 100 labor hours, and Country B can only produce 50 units with the same time, then Country A has an absolute advantage in wheat production.

Looking at the options again, option B says using fewer hours of labor regardless of efficiency. That might not be correct because it's not just about time but about the total output. Option E talks about more cheaply and efficiently, which might be a factor but isn't the definition. 

Wait, maybe the correct definition is when a country can produce a good more efficiently, meaning with less input per output. So, if a country can make a good with fewer resources, that's absolute advantage. So, looking at the options, option E says "more cheaply and efficiently," which captures the idea of using resources more effectively. Alternatively, option B says using fewer hours regardless of efficiency, which seems incomplete because it doesn't account for efficiency.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Absolute advantage is about the ability to produce more output from the same inputs. So, if Country X can make 10 cars with 100 workers, and Country Y can make 8 cars with the same number of workers, then X has absolute advantage. So it's about producing more with the same resources, which is about efficiency.

Looking at the options, option E says "produce a good more cheaply and efficiently than another." That seems to fit because it's about both cost and efficiency. Option B only mentions fewer hours, which might not capture the full picture. So I think E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Absolute advantage exists when one nation can produce a good more cheaply and efficiently than another. This captures the essence of producing more output with fewer resources or at a lower cost, which is the definition of absolute advantage.

Answer: E
