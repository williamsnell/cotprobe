Question:

Select the best translation into predicate logic: Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl.

Options:

A: Bc ⊃ (Pm ⊃ Gm)
B: Cb ⊃ (Pm • Gm)
C: Bc ≡ (Pm ⊃ Gm)
D: Bc ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm)
E: Bc ≡ (Pm • Gm)
F: Cb ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm)
G: Bc ≡ (Gm • Pm)
H: Cb ⊃ (Gm ∨ Pm)
I: Bc ⊃ (Pm • Gm)
J: Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm)

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct translation of the sentence "Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl" into predicate logic. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should identify the key components of the sentence. The main clauses are:
1. "Cecilia breaks my heart" – let's represent this as Cb.
2. "Maria is either a problem or a girl." – I think this can be represented as Pm ∨ Gm, where Pm is "Maria is a problem" and Gm is "Maria is a girl."

The sentence uses "if and only if," which in logic translates to a biconditional relationship. That means both directions are true: Cb happens exactly when (Pm ∨ Gm) happens. So the structure should be Cb ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm).

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure. Let's go through them:

Option A: Bc ⊃ (Pm ⊃ Gm) – This looks like a conditional where if Bc then Pm implies Gm. Doesn't match because it's not a biconditional and the inner part is not an OR.

Option B: Cb ⊃ (Pm • Gm) – This is Cb implies both Pm and Gm. Not what we want because the original says OR, not AND.

Option C: Cb ≡ (Pm ⊃ Gm) – Again, the right side is a conditional, not an OR. So this isn't right.

Option D: Cb ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm) – This is Cb implies (Pm OR Gm). It's a one-way implication, but the original uses if and only if, which requires a biconditional.

Option E: Cb ≡ (Pm • Gm) – Biconditional but with AND, which is wrong because the original has OR.

Option F: Cb ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm) – Same as D, just a one-way implication.

Option G: Cb ≡ (Gm • Pm) – Biconditional with AND. Still incorrect because it's OR.

Option H: Cb ⊃ (Gm ∨ Pm) – Same as D and F, just using Gm before Pm, but still one-way.

Option I: Cb ⊃ (Pm • Gm) – Again, AND instead of OR, and one-way.

Option J: Cb ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm) – This is exactly what we need: a biconditional where Cb is equivalent to (Pm OR Gm).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about biconditional being Cb ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm). So looking back, the original sentence uses "if and only if," which is a biconditional. So both Cb implies (Pm ∨ Gm) and (Pm ∨ Gm) implies Cb must be true.

Looking at the options, only option J uses ≡ (equivalence) with Pm ∨ Gm. So J must be the correct answer.

The correct translation requires a biconditional relationship (if and only if) between Cb and (Pm ∨ Gm). Option J matches this structure exactly.

Answer: J
