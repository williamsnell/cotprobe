Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans and their main use. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what are simple tandem repeats (STRs)? From what I remember, STRs are short DNA sequences that are repeated multiple times in a row. They are a type of genetic marker used in various fields like forensics and genetics. I think they're also known as microsatellites.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one:

A: Studying the effects of radiation exposure. Hmm, I'm not sure how STRs relate to radiation. Maybe radiation causes mutations, but I don't recall STRs being the primary tool for studying radiation effects.

B: Identifying the presence of bacterial infections. That doesn't sound right. Bacterial infections are usually detected through other methods like culture tests or PCR, not STRs. STRs are more about human DNA analysis.

C: Solving criminal and paternity cases. This rings a bell. I remember STR analysis being used in forensic science to identify individuals because everyone's STR patterns are unique. It's also used in paternity testing, so this seems like a strong candidate.

D: Determining blood type. Blood types are determined by specific alleles like ABO antigens. STRs aren't directly related to blood type determination, so probably not D.

E: Transferring disease resistance factors into bone marrow cells. That sounds more like gene therapy, which involves modifying genes, not using STRs. STRs are for analysis, not transferring genes.

F: Estimating relationships of humans and Neanderthals. I think this would involve mitochondrial DNA or Y-chromosome studies, not STRs. STRs are more about individual identification and close relationships rather than species-level comparisons.

G: Accelerating the process of aging. No idea how STRs would relate to aging. I don't think they have any role in that.

H: Predicting the risk of genetic disorders. While STRs can indicate certain genetic variations, predicting the risk of disorders is more about specific genes or SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), not just STRs.

I: Reconstructing the relationships of humans and chimps. Again, this seems like it would involve broader evolutionary studies, possibly using mitochondrial DNA or other markers, not STRs which are more about individual variation.

J: Determining the sex of an unborn child. That's done with amniocentesis or ultrasound, not STRs. Although STRs can be used in sex determination through specific markers, it's not the primary method given the options here.

So putting it all together, the most useful application of STRs is in solving criminal and paternity cases, which is option C. STRs provide a high level of individual specificity, making them ideal for forensic analysis and parentage testing.

The correct answer is C: solving criminal and paternity cases. STRs are highly useful for identifying individuals due to their unique patterns, making them ideal for forensic analysis and paternity testing.

Answer: C
