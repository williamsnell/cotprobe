Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of lumber. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these calculations, but I'll do my best.

First, the problem says that the cost of lumber is $140 per 1,000 board feet. I need to find out how much 300 pieces of lumber will cost. Each piece has specific dimensions: 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long.

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate the volume of each piece of lumber first. Wait, no, actually, in the lumber industry, they usually measure by board feet, which is a specific unit. A board foot is 12 inches by 12 inches by 1 foot, right? So that's 144 cubic inches because 12x12x1 = 144. But wait, no, actually, a board foot is 12 inches by 12 inches by 12 inches? No, wait, no, 1 foot is 12 inches, so a board foot is 12" x 12" x 1' which is 12x12x12 inches? Wait, no, that would be 1728 cubic inches. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

No, wait, a board foot is 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 inch. Because 1 foot is 12 inches, so 12x12x1 = 144 cubic inches. So 1 board foot is 144 cubic inches. So each piece of lumber's volume in cubic inches will be calculated, and then converted to board feet by dividing by 144.

Okay, so each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long. Wait, but the thickness and width are in inches, and the length is in feet. So I need to convert everything to the same units before calculating volume.

Let me think: the length is 12 feet, which is 12 x 12 = 144 inches. So each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 144 inches long.

So the volume in cubic inches is 2 x 6 x 144. Let me calculate that: 2*6 is 12, and 12*144 is 1728 cubic inches per piece.

Now, to convert that to board feet, I divide by 144 because each board foot is 144 cubic inches. So 1728 / 144 equals... let's see: 144 goes into 1728 exactly 12 times because 144 x 12 = 1728. So each piece is 12 board feet.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 12 board feet per piece, and 300 pieces would be 300 * 12 = 3600 board feet. But the cost is $140 per 1000 board feet, so 3600 / 1000 is 3.6 units. So 3.6 * 140 equals... let me calculate that. 140 * 3 is 420, and 0.6 *140 is 84, so 420 +84 = 504. So the total cost would be $504.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I might have messed up somewhere.

Wait, each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long. So converting 12 feet to inches: 12 *12 = 144 inches. So the dimensions are 2x6x144 inches.

Volume per piece: 2 *6 *144 = 1728 cubic inches. Divided by 144 (since 1 board foot is 144 cubic inches), so 1728 /144 = 12 board feet per piece. That seems correct.

So 300 pieces would be 300 *12 = 3600 board feet. The cost is $140 per 1000 board feet, so 3600 /1000 =3.6. Multiply by 140: 3*140=420, 0.6*140=84, so 420+84=504. So the total cost is $504, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I convert everything correctly? The length is 12 feet, which is 144 inches, yes. So 2x6x144 is indeed 1728 cubic inches. Divided by 144 gives 12 board feet. So yes, each piece is 12 board feet. So 300 pieces would be 3600 board feet. At $140 per 1000, that's 3.6 *140 = 504. So the answer should be C: $504.

The cost is calculated by determining the board footage per piece, multiplying by the number of pieces, and then applying the cost per 1,000 board feet. Each piece is 12 board feet, so 300 pieces total 3,600 board feet. At $140 per 1,000, the cost is $504.

Answer: C
