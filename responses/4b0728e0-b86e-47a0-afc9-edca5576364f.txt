Okay, so I have this question about merge sort and data structures. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is asking which data structures allow merge sort to work in O(n log n) time. The options are a singly linked list, a doubly linked list, and an array. The answer choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n). That's because it splits the list into halves recursively, which is the log n part, and then it merges them, which is linear time for each level, and since there are log n levels, that's where it comes from.

Now, the question is about the data structure. So I need to think about how each of these structures (singly linked, doubly linked, array) affects the merge process.

Let me start with the array. Arrays are contiguous in memory, which is good for random access. When you split an array into halves, you can do it in O(1) time by just calculating the mid-point. Merging is efficient with arrays because you can create a new array and fill it by comparing elements from each half. So arrays definitely work well with merge sort, and the time complexity stays O(n log n).

Next, a singly linked list. Hmm. Singly linked lists have nodes where each node points to the next one. So when you split the list, you can do it by finding the midpoint. But wait, in a singly linked list, you can't easily split it into two without traversing to the midpoint, which is O(n) time. So that would add an O(n) step each time you split, which could affect the overall time complexity. Because for each level of recursion, you're doing this O(n) split, and there are log n levels. So the total time would be O(n log n) for splitting plus O(n log n) for merging. Wait, but does that push it beyond O(n log n)? Because each split is O(n), and there are log n splits. So that's O(n log n) for splitting. Then the merging process in a singly linked listâ€”how does that work? Well, merging two sorted linked lists takes O(n) time. So each merge is O(n), and again, log n levels. So overall, O(n log n) time. So the splits and merges each contribute O(n log n), but that's okay because it's within the acceptable O(n log n) time.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in an array, splitting is O(1), but in a singly linked list, it's O(n). Does that change the overall time complexity? Let me think. The total time for all splits across all levels is O(n log n), and the same for merges. So the total time is O(n log n) for splits and O(n log n) for merges, adding up to O(n log n) overall. So a singly linked list should be okay.

What about a doubly linked list? A doubly linked list has nodes that point to both the next and previous nodes. Splitting a doubly linked list would also involve O(n) time, similar to the singly linked case, because you have to find the midpoint. But wait, maybe it's easier because you can adjust the pointers without traversing as much? No, I don't think so. You still need to find the midpoint, which is O(n) time. So the same reasoning applies as with the singly linked list. So a doubly linked list would also allow merge sort to run in O(n log n) time.

Wait, but I've read somewhere that merge sort is typically implemented on arrays because it's more efficient. Why is that? Oh, right, because when using a linked list, especially a singly linked one, you have to traverse to find the midpoint each time you split. That adds some overhead. But in terms of asymptotic time complexity, it's still O(n log n). So the linked lists would work, but maybe with a higher constant factor.

So putting it all together: arrays, singly linked lists, and doubly linked lists all allow merge sort to run in O(n log n) time. So the correct answer would include all three.

Looking at the options, option D is I, II, and III. So the answer should be D.

Mergesort's time complexity of O(n log n) depends on efficiently splitting and merging the data structure. Arrays allow O(1) splitting and O(n) merging, making them ideal. Singly and doubly linked lists require O(n) time to split due to finding the midpoint, but their merging is efficient. Despite the additional overhead in splitting, all three data structures maintain O(n log n) time complexity for mergesort.
