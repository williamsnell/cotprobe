Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the average speed of a water molecule in water vapor at 25°C. Hmm, I remember that the average speed of gas molecules can be calculated using the kinetic theory of gases. I think the formula involves the temperature and the molar mass of the substance. 

Wait, right, the average speed (I think it's the root mean square speed) is given by the formula v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass. Oh wait, but wait, the problem gives me the Boltzmann constant k instead of R. So maybe I should use the formula that involves k.

I think the formula using Boltzmann's constant is v = sqrt(3kT/m), where m is the mass of a single molecule. But wait, molar mass M is the mass per mole, so to get the mass of a single molecule, I need to divide by Avogadro's number, N_A. So, m = M / N_A.

Putting it together, v = sqrt(3kT * (1/m)) which becomes sqrt(3kT * N_A / M) because m = M/N_A. Wait, no, let me get that right. Let me think: m = M / N_A, so 1/m = N_A / M. So substituting into the equation, v = sqrt(3kT * (N_A / M)).

So the formula becomes v = sqrt( (3kN_A T) / M ). Alternatively, since R = kN_A, the formula becomes v = sqrt(3RT/M), which matches what I thought earlier. So that's correct.

Now, let's plug in the numbers. The temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K (because 25 + 273.15 ≈ 298). The molar mass of water is about 18.015 g/mol, which is 0.018015 kg/mol. 

The Boltzmann constant k is given as 1.3806 × 10^-23 J/°C, and since temperature in Kelvin is absolute, it's the same as J/K. So T is 298 K.

So plugging into the formula: v = sqrt( (3 * 1.3806e-23 J/K * 298 K) / 0.018015 kg ). Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate 3 * k * T: 3 * 1.3806e-23 * 298. Let's compute that. 3 * 1.3806 is about 4.1418, multiplied by 298. Let me calculate 4.1418 * 300 = 1242.54, but since it's 298, subtract 2 *4.1418 = 8.2836. So 1242.54 - 8.2836 ≈ 1234.2564. So that's approximately 1234.26e-23 J.

Wait, wait, no: 3 * 1.3806e-23 *298 = 3 * 1.3806e-23 * 298. Let me compute 1.3806e-23 * 298 first. 1.3806 * 298 ≈ 411.1388, so 411.1388e-23 J. Then multiply by 3: 411.1388 *3 ≈ 1233.4164e-23 J, which is 1.2334164e-20 J.

Wait, but that's the numerator: 3kT. The denominator is M, which is 0.018015 kg. So the entire fraction inside the square root is (1.2334164e-20 J) / (0.018015 kg). J is kg·m²/s², so dividing by kg gives m²/s². So the units inside the sqrt are m²/s², so when we take the square root, we get m/s, which is correct.

So compute 1.2334164e-20 / 0.018015. Let's see: 1.2334164e-20 divided by 0.018015. Let me compute 1.2334164 / 0.018015, then apply the exponent. 

1.2334164 / 0.018015 ≈ let's compute 0.018015 * 68.4 = approx 1.232 (since 0.018 *68=1.224, and 0.018*68.4= 68.4 *0.018=1.2312). So approximately 68.4e-20, but wait, the actual value is 1.2334164e-20 / 0.018015 = (1.2334164 / 0.018015) * 1e-20. 

Wait, let's compute 1.2334164 / 0.018015. Let me do this division step by step. 0.018015 times 68 is 1.224, which is close to 1.2334. The difference is about 0.0094. So 68 + (0.0094 / 0.018015). 0.0094 /0.018 ≈ 0.522. So 68.522. So approximately 68.522e-20? Wait, no, because 1.2334164e-20 / 0.018015 = (1.2334164 / 0.018015) * 1e-20. Wait, that's not correct, because 1e-20 divided by 0.018015 is (1e-20) * (1/0.018015). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me compute 1.2334164e-20 divided by 0.018015: 

1.2334164e-20 / 0.018015 = (1.2334164 / 0.018015) * 1e-20. 

Compute 1.2334164 ÷ 0.018015. Let me compute that: 0.018015 * 68 = 1.224. The difference is 1.2334164 - 1.224 = 0.0094164. Now, how much more beyond 68 do I need to get 0.0094164? 

0.0094164 ÷ 0.018015 ≈ 0.522. So total is approximately 68.522. So 68.522. So 68.522 * 1e-20. Wait, but that's 6.8522e-19. Wait, no, wait: 68.522 is 6.8522e1, so 6.8522e1 * 1e-20 = 6.8522e-19. So the fraction inside the square root is 6.8522e-19 m²/s².

Wait, no, because m²/s² is the unit, so taking the square root gives m/s. So sqrt(6.8522e-19) m/s.

Compute the square root of 6.8522e-19. Let's think about sqrt(6.85e-19). Let me compute sqrt(6.85) ≈ 2.617. Then sqrt(1e-19) is 1e-9.5, which is 1e-9.5 ≈ 3.16e-10. So 2.617 * 3.16e-10 ≈ approx 8.27e-10 m/s.

Wait, that seems way too slow. Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me try again.

Compute 3kT: 3 * 1.3806e-23 J/K * 298 K = 3 * 1.3806e-23 * 298. Let's compute 1.3806e-23 *298 first. 

1.3806 * 298 ≈ 411.1388. So 411.1388e-23 J. Multiply by 3: 1233.4164e-23 J, which is 1.2334164e-20 J.

Then, divide by M (0.018015 kg): 1.2334164e-20 J / 0.018015 kg.

J = kg·m²/s², so J/kg = m²/s². So the division gives (1.2334164e-20 / 0.018015) m²/s².

Compute 1.2334164e-20 / 0.018015. Let me compute it as 1.2334164e-20 divided by 1.8015e-2. So 1.2334164e-20 / 1.8015e-2 = (1.2334164 / 1.8015) * 1e-18. 

1.2334164 ÷ 1.8015 ≈ 0.6845. So 0.6845e-18 = 6.845e-19 m²/s².

Now, take the square root of 6.845e-19 m²/s². 

The square root of 6.845e-19 is sqrt(6.845) * sqrt(1e-19). 

sqrt(6.845) ≈ 2.616. 

sqrt(1e-19) = 1e-9.5 = 3.1623e-10. 

Multiply together: 2.616 * 3.1623e-10 ≈ 8.27e-10 m/s. Wait, that's 0.000000000827 m/s, which is way too slow for a gas molecule. That can't be right because gas molecules move much faster than that.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Maybe the formula uses the molar mass in kg per mole and I messed up the units.

Wait, let's see. The correct formula is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is in K, and M is molar mass in kg/mol. Alternatively, using Boltzmann's constant: v = sqrt(3kT/m), where m is the mass of a single molecule.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use R. Let me try that approach.

So R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). M for water is 0.018015 kg/mol.

v_rms = sqrt(3 * 8.314 * 298 / 0.018015).

Compute numerator: 3 *8.314 =24.942; 24.942 *298 ≈ let's compute 24.942 *300 =7482.6, subtract 24.942 *2=49.884, so 7482.6 -49.884=7432.716.

Now divide by M: 7432.716 /0.018015≈ let's compute that.

0.018015 *412,000 = approx 7432.56 (because 0.018 *412,000 =7416, and 0.000015 *412000=6.18, so total 7416+6.18=7422.18, which is close but a bit low. Let me compute 7432.716 /0.018015.

Let me compute 7432716 /18015 (since 0.018015 =18015e-6). So 7432716 ÷ 18015 ≈ let's see.

18015 *412 = approx 18015*400=7,206,000; 18015*12=216,180 → total 7,422,180. That's close to 7,432,716. The difference is 7,432,716 -7,422,180=10,536. So 412 + (10,536/18015) ≈ 412 + 0.584 ≈412.584. So approximately 412.584.

So the value inside the square root is 412.584, so sqrt(412.584) ≈ 20.31 m/s. Wait, that's even slower than before. That can't be right because I know gas molecules move much faster than that. For example, I remember that at room temperature, gas molecules like nitrogen move at about 500 m/s. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check: the formula for rms speed is sqrt(3RT/M), yes. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is 298 K, M is 0.018015 kg/mol.

So 3 *8.314=24.942, 24.942 *298=7432.716, divided by 0.018015 gives 7432.716 /0.018015 ≈412,584. So sqrt(412,584) is about 642 m/s. Oh wait, wait a minute! Because 642^2 is 412,164, which is close to 412,584. So the sqrt is approximately 642 m/s.

Wait, but earlier when I used the Boltzmann constant approach, I got something way too small. I must have made a mistake in that approach. Let me see where I went wrong.

Ah, I think I messed up the units when using the Boltzmann constant. Let me try that approach again.

v = sqrt(3kT/m), where m is the mass of a single molecule. Molar mass M is 0.018015 kg/mol, so the mass of one molecule is m = M / N_A, where N_A is Avogadro's number, about 6.022e23 mol^-1.

So m = 0.018015 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol^-1 = 0.018015 /6.022e23 kg/molecule ≈ 2.99e-26 kg/molecule.

Now, compute 3kT/m: 3 * 1.3806e-23 J/K *298 K / (2.99e-26 kg).

Compute numerator: 3 *1.3806e-23 *298 ≈ 3 *1.3806e-23 *3e2 (approx) = 3*1.3806e-23 *300= 1.24254e-21, but more accurately, 298 is 300-2, so 3*1.3806e-23 *298=3*1.3806e-23*(300-2)=3*1.3806e-23*300 -3*1.3806e-23*2.

Which is 1.24254e-21 - 8.2836e-24 = approximately 1.24254e-21 - 0.0082836e-21 = 1.23426e-21 J.

Now divide by m (2.99e-26 kg): 1.23426e-21 / 2.99e-26 ≈ (1.23426/2.99) * 1e5 ≈ 0.412 * 1e5 ≈ 4.12e4.

So 3kT/m ≈4.12e4 m²/s². Now take the square root: sqrt(4.12e4) ≈ 203 m/s. Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier result using R which gave 642 m/s. That can't be right because I know the rms speed for gases is around hundreds of m/s, like for air around 500 m/s.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 3kT/m.

3kT = 3 *1.3806e-23 *298 = let's compute that accurately.

1.3806 *298 = let's compute 1.3806*300 =414.18, minus 1.3806*2=2.7612 → 414.18-2.7612=411.4188. So 3*411.4188e-23=1234.2564e-23 = 1.2342564e-20 J.

Now, m = M/(N_A) = 0.018015 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol^-1 = 0.018015 /6.022e23 kg/molecule ≈ 2.99e-26 kg.

So 3kT/m = 1.2342564e-20 J / 2.99e-26 kg. J is kg·m²/s², so dividing by kg gives m²/s².

So 1.2342564e-20 / 2.99e-26 = (1.2342564 / 2.99) * 1e6 ≈ 0.412 *1e6 = 4.12e5 m²/s².

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, 1.2342564e-20 divided by 2.99e-26 is (1.2342564 /2.99) * 1e6 (since 1e-20 /1e-26 =1e6).

1.2342564 ÷2.99 ≈ 0.412. So 0.412 *1e6 =4.12e5 m²/s².

Then sqrt(4.12e5) = approx 642 m/s. Oh, that's the same as before. So the correct rms speed is approximately 642 m/s.

Wait, so earlier when I used the Boltzmann approach, I must have messed up the exponents. So the correct calculation gives around 642 m/s, which matches option E: 642 m/s.

Wait, but earlier when I first tried using Boltzmann's approach, I got something around 8e-10 m/s, which was way off. So that must have been a mistake in handling the exponents.

So the correct answer should be around 642 m/s, which is option E.

To determine the average speed of a water molecule in water vapor at 25°C, we use the root mean square (rms) speed formula from the kinetic theory of gases:

\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
\]

Where:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) (universal gas constant),
- \( T = 25 + 273.15 = 298 \, \text{K} \) (temperature in Kelvin),
- \( M = 0.018015 \, \text{kg/mol} \) (molar mass of water).

### Step 1: Plug in the values
\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 298}{0.018015}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator
\[
3 \cdot 8.314 = 24.942
\]
\[
24.942 \cdot 298 = 7432.716
\]

### Step 3: Divide by the molar mass
\[
\frac{7432.716}{0.018015} \approx 412,584
\]

### Step 4: Take the square root
\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{412,584} \approx 642 \, \text{m/s}
\]

This result aligns with the known range for molecular speeds in gases at room temperature. Among the given options, the closest match is **642 m/s**.
