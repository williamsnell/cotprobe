Okay, so I have this question about matrix ranks, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have two n-by-n matrices, A and B. It's given that the rank of A is n, which means A is invertible because a square matrix is invertible if and only if its rank is equal to its dimension. So, A has full rank, which is n.

Then, the product of A and B, which is AB, has a rank of 0. Wait, rank 0? That can't be right because the rank is the dimension of the image, and if AB is a matrix with rank 0, that means AB is the zero matrix. Because if the rank is 0, the image is just the zero vector, so AB must be zero matrix.

So, AB = 0. Now, I need to find the rank of B.

But wait, A is invertible. Because rank(A) = n, so A is invertible. So, if AB = 0 and A is invertible, then I can multiply both sides by A inverse.

Let me write that down: A^{-1} AB = A^{-1} * 0. Simplifying the left side, A^{-1} A is the identity matrix, so we get IB = 0. So, IB = 0, which simplifies to B = 0. Because I is the identity matrix, and multiplying it by B gives B.

So, B is the zero matrix. Now, what's the rank of the zero matrix? The rank is 0 because the zero matrix has no linearly independent rows or columns. So, every entry is zero, so all rows (and columns) are zero vectors, which have rank 0.

Wait, but let me double-check. If A is invertible, then AB = 0 implies B must be zero. Because if A is invertible, the only solution to AB = 0 is B = 0. That's a property of invertible matrices. So, B is the zero matrix, which has rank 0.

So, looking back at the options, option A is 0.0, which is the same as 0. So the correct answer should be A.

The rank of A is n (invertible), and AB has rank 0 (zero matrix). Using A's invertibility, AB=0 implies B=0, so rank(B)=0.

Answer: A
