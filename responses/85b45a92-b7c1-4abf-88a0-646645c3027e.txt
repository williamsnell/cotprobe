Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. So, the question is about finding the molecular formula of a gas with a molecular weight of 58. The gas is 82.8% carbon and 17.2% hydrogen. Hmm, I remember that molecular formulas are based on the percentages of each element and the molecular weight. 

Alright, first step, I think I should calculate the moles of carbon and hydrogen in the compound. Since the percentages are given, I can assume a 100g sample for simplicity. So, 82.8% C means 82.8 grams of carbon, and 17.2% H means 17.2 grams of hydrogen in 100 grams of the compound.

Next, I need to convert these masses into moles. The atomic weight of carbon is about 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is about 1 g/mol. So, moles of C would be 82.8 g / 12 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 82.8 divided by 12 is 6.9 moles. Wait, 12 times 6 is 72, 12 times 6.9 is 82.8, right. So that's 6.9 moles of C.

For hydrogen, 17.2 grams divided by 1 g/mol is 17.2 moles. Okay, so now I have 6.9 moles of C and 17.2 moles of H.

The next step is to find the simplest whole number ratio of C to H. To do that, I'll divide both by the smaller number of moles. The smaller is 6.9. So, 6.9 divided by 6.9 is 1, and 17.2 divided by 6.9 is approximately 2.48. Hmm, that's not a whole number. Wait, maybe I should check my calculations again. Let me see: 17.2 / 6.9 equals... Let me calculate it more accurately. 6.9 times 2 is 13.8, and 6.9 times 2.5 is 17.25. So 17.2 is almost exactly 2.5 times 6.9. Wait, 6.9 * 2.5 is 17.25, which is very close to 17.2, so maybe it's just a rounding thing. So the ratio is approximately 1 C to 2.5 H. But that's not a whole number ratio. Hmm, that's a problem because molecular formulas require whole numbers. 

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should have taken the moles and found the ratio without assuming a 100g sample. Let me try another method.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the percentages and calculate the empirical formula. So, the empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of atoms. So, let's see: 82.8% C and 17.2% H. The total is 100%, so that's good.

Convert the percentages to grams: 82.8 g C and 17.2 g H.

Molar masses: C is 12 g/mol, H is 1 g/mol.

Moles of C: 82.8 / 12 = 6.9 moles.

Moles of H: 17.2 / 1 = 17.2 moles.

Now, divide both by the smallest mole value, which is 6.9.

6.9 / 6.9 = 1.

17.2 / 6.9 ≈ 2.489. Hmm, that's approximately 2.489, which is close to 2.5, but not a whole number. So, maybe I need to multiply both by a number to get whole numbers. Let's see: 2.489 is about 2.5, which is 5/2. So, if I multiply both by 2, I get 2 and 5. So, the ratio would be 2 C and 5 H? Wait, but that would be C2H5. Let me check: 2.489 is about 2.5, which is 5/2, so the ratio would be 1:2.5 → multiply by 2 → 2:5. So the empirical formula is C2H5.

Wait, but let me think again. Because 6.9 is approximately 7 moles of C, but let me check 6.9 times 2 is 13.8, which is 17.2. So, 6.9 * 2.5 is indeed 17.25, which is very close to 17.2. So, perhaps the actual mole ratio is 6.9 : 17.2 → which simplifies to 1 : 2.5. To get whole numbers, multiply by 2 to get 2 : 5. So the empirical formula would be C2H5.

Wait, but the molecular formula is a multiple of the empirical formula, right? The molecular weight is given as 58 g/mol. The empirical formula's molar mass is (2*12) + (5*1) = 24 +5=29 g/mol.

So, the molecular formula would be (C2H5)n, where n = molecular weight / empirical formula weight. So, 58 /29 =2. So, n is 2. So, the molecular formula is (C2H5)2 → C4H10. Wait, because (C2H5)2 is C4H10. Let me check: 2*(2*12 +5*1)=2*(24+5)=2*29=58. Yes, that matches.

So, the molecular formula is C4H10, which corresponds to option G.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have missed a step. So, the empirical formula is C2H5, molecular weight 29, the molecular formula is n=58/29=2, so C4H10. Option G is C4H10. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the molecular formula of the compound, we start by calculating the moles of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) in a 100 g sample. Given the percentages, 82.8% of the sample is carbon (82.8 g) and 17.2% is hydrogen (17.2 g). Using their respective molar masses (12 g/mol for C and 1 g/mol for H), the moles are:

\[
\text{Moles of C} = \frac{82.8}{12} = 6.9 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of H} = \frac{17.2}{1} = 17.2 \, \text{mol}
\]

Next, we find the simplest whole number ratio of C to H by dividing both by the smaller number of moles (6.9):

\[
\text{Ratio of C} = \frac{6.9}{6.9} = 1
\]
\[
\text{Ratio of H} = \frac{17.2}{6.9} \approx 2.5
\]

To convert 2.5 into a whole number, multiply both the C and H ratios by 2:

\[
\text{Empirical formula} = \text{C}_2\text{H}_5
\]

The molar mass of the empirical formula is:

\[
(2 \times 12) + (5 \times 1) = 29 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The molecular weight of the compound is given as 58 g/mol. To find the molecular formula, we determine how many times the empirical formula fits into the molecular weight:

\[
n = \frac{\text{Molecular weight}}{\text{Empirical formula weight}} = \frac{58}{29} = 2
\]

Thus, the molecular formula is:

\[
(\text{C}_2\text{H}_5)_2 = \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}
\]

This corresponds to option **G**.
