Okay, so I need to find the wavelength of light required to ionize sodium atoms. The ionization potential given is 8.17 × 10^-19 J. Hmm, I remember that ionization energy relates to the energy of the photon needed. So, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Oh right, the energy of the photon should be equal to or greater than the ionization potential for ionization to occur. So, I can set E_photon = E_ionization.

So, E_photon = hc/λ => λ = hc / E.

I should plug in the values. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.00 × 10^8 m/s.

But wait, the ionization energy is given in joules, so I can directly use that in the formula.

Let me compute hc first. So, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = let me calculate that. 6.626 * 3 is about 19.878, and the exponents are 10^-34 * 10^8 = 10^-26. So, hc ≈ 1.9878 × 10^-25 J·m.

Now, the energy E is 8.17e-19 J. So, λ = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (8.17e-19 J) = let's compute that.

Dividing the numbers: 1.9878 / 8.17 ≈ 0.243. The exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-19 = 1e-6. So, 0.243e-6 meters. Wait, because 1e-6 meters is a micrometer, but the options are in Angstroms. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, right? So, 0.243e-6 meters is 243e-9 meters, which is 2430 Angstroms because 1e-10 m is 1 Angstrom. Wait, 1e-10 m = 1 Å, so 1e-9 m is 10 Å. So 0.243e-6 m is 243e-9 m = 2430e-10 m = 2430 Å.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. So:

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

E = 8.17e-19 J.

λ = hc / E = (1.9878e-25) / (8.17e-19) = (1.9878 / 8.17) * 1e-6 m.

1.9878 / 8.17 is approximately 0.243, so 0.243e-6 m = 2.43e-7 m. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 1e-6 m is 1 micrometer, which is 1000 nanometers, but in Angstroms: 1 m = 1e10 Å, so 2.43e-7 m is 2.43e-7 * 1e10 Å = 2.43e3 Å, which is 2430 Å.

Looking at the options, option C is 2430 Å. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me re-calculate 1.9878e-25 divided by 8.17e-19. So, 1.9878 /8.17 is approximately 0.243. Then, 1e-25 /1e-19 is 1e-6. So 0.243e-6 meters is 243e-9 meters. Since 1e-9 meters is 1 nanometer, but in Angstroms, 1e-10 meters is 1 Å. So 243e-9 m = 2430e-10 m = 2430 Å. Yep, that's correct.

So the wavelength is 2430 Å, which is option C.

To determine the wavelength of light required to ionize sodium atoms, we use the relationship between the energy of a photon and its wavelength:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad \lambda = \frac{hc}{E}
\]

Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( E = 8.17 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) (ionization potential of sodium).

### Step 1: Calculate \( hc \)
\[
hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3.00 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \lambda \)
\[
\lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{8.17 \times 10^{-19}} = 0.243 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Convert to Angstroms
Since \( 1 \, \text{Å} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\lambda = 0.243 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 2430 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Final Answer
The wavelength of light required for the ionization of sodium atoms is **2430 Å**, corresponding to **option C**.
