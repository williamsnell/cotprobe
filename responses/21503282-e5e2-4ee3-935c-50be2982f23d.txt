Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to express two fractions as percentages. The fractions are 2/5 and 1/100. The options are from A to J, each giving two percentages. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's tackle 2/5. I remember that to convert a fraction to a percentage, I can multiply by 100. So, 2 divided by 5 is... wait, what's 2 divided by 5? Let me calculate that. 2 รท 5 equals 0.4. Now, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage, 0.4 ร 100 is 40%. So, 2/5 is 40%. That narrows down the options because I can look for the ones that have 40% as the first part.

Looking at the options, A is 40% and 0.25%, B is 40% and 1%, E is 40% and 0.5%. So those are the possible choices based on the first fraction.

Now, the second fraction is 1/100. Hmm, that seems straightforward. 1 divided by 100 is 0.01. To convert that to a percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives me 1%. Wait, is that right? Because 1/100 is 0.01, and 0.01 times 100 is indeed 1%. So the second percentage should be 1%.

Now I need to check which option has 40% as the first and 1% as the second. Let's see: option B is 40%, 1%, which matches. Option E is 40%, 0.5%, which doesn't match. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes? For 2/5, 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, which is 40%. Correct. For 1/100, 1 divided by 100 is 0.01, which is 1%. So yes, B is the right choice.

The first fraction, 2/5, is 40% when converted to a percentage. The second fraction, 1/100, is 1% when converted. The correct option is B: 40%, 1%.

Answer: B
