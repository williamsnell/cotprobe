Okay, so I've got this entropy calculation problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's given and what I need to find.

The problem is about calculating the entropy of a substance at 400 K and 0.7 atm. The substance has different heat capacities (Cp) in different phases: solid below 25 K, liquid between 25 K and 250 K (melting point), and gas above 360 K (boiling point). Also, there are heat of fusion and vaporization values provided.

First, I remember that entropy change can be calculated using the integral of dQrev over T. For a substance undergoing phase changes and temperature changes, I'll need to break the process into steps where I can apply the Cp values for each phase and calculate the entropy for each step.

The substance is at 400 K and 0.7 atm. Since 0.7 atm is less than 1 atm and the boiling point is 360 K, I think the substance is in the gas phase at 400 K because the boiling point is 360 K. Wait, but wait—pressure affects the phase. At 0.7 atm, which is below 1 atm, the boiling point might be lower. Hmm, but the given boiling point is at 1 atm, so at lower pressure, the boiling point would be lower. So, maybe the substance at 400 K and 0.7 atm is still a gas because 400 K is above the boiling point at 1 atm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the substance's boiling point is 360 K at 1 atm. At lower pressure, the boiling point decreases. So at 0.7 atm, the boiling point would be lower than 360 K. Let's say it's 360 K at 1 atm, so at 0.7 atm, the boiling point would be lower. But wait, for entropy calculation, I'm probably supposed to consider the phase based on the given data, not necessarily adjust the boiling point for pressure. Because the problem states that above 360 K, it's a gas at 1 atm. But since the pressure here is 0.7 atm, perhaps the substance is a gas at 400 K, but maybe I need to consider if it's in the vapor or another phase.

Wait, maybe it's better to proceed by considering the substance is a gas at 400 K because the given Cp for gas is 15 cal/(deg·mol) and that's applicable above the boiling point at 1 atm. But since the pressure here is 0.7 atm, which is less than 1 atm, the boiling point would be lower, but perhaps at 400 K, it's still a gas. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure doesn't affect the phase at this temperature because we're given the gas Cp for above 360 K regardless of pressure. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the given data, assuming that at 400 K, the substance is in the gas phase even at 0.7 atm because it's above the boiling point of 360 K at 1 atm.

Wait, no—if the pressure is lower than 1 atm, the boiling point would be lower. So, for example, if at 1 atm, it boils at 360 K, at 0.7 atm, it would boil at a lower temperature, say T_b. So, if the current temperature is 400 K, which is higher than T_b (which is lower than 360 K), the substance would be in the vapor phase. So, at 400 K and 0.7 atm, it's a gas.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Another approach is to calculate the entropy up to the melting point, then from melt to boil at 1 atm, then from 360 K to 400 K as gas. But since the pressure is 0.7 atm, perhaps I need to adjust for that? Or maybe the problem expects us to proceed as if the substance is a gas above 360 K regardless of pressure because that's how it's given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the phase change due to pressure and just wants me to use the given Cp for gas. I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, to calculate entropy at 400 K and 0.7 atm, I need to consider the process from absolute zero up to 400 K, but considering phase changes and the respective Cp values. The steps would be:

1. From 0 K to 25 K: solid phase, Cp = 0.8T.
2. From 25 K to 250 K: solid phase (wait, no, melting point is 250 K, so after 25 K to 250 K, it's still solid?), no, wait, the melting point is 250 K. So, the solid exists up to 250 K. So from 25 K to 250 K, it's solid, and the Cp is 0.007T + 0.0006 T².

Wait, no—the problem says "From 25 K → 250 K (melting point); Cp = 0.007T + 0.0006T² cal deg^-1 mole^-1." So that's the solid phase up to melting point. Then, from 250 K (melting point) to 360 K (boiling point at 1 atm), it's liquid, with Cp = 18 + 0.007T.

Then, above 360 K, it's gas at 1 atm, Cp = 15 cal/(deg·mol).

But wait, we're going up to 400 K, which is above 360 K, so we need to consider the entropy change from 0 K to 25 K (solid), 25 K to 250 K (solid), 250 K to 360 K (liquid), and 360 K to 400 K (gas). Additionally, we have phase changes at 250 K (fusion) and 360 K (vaporization). Also, since the pressure is 0.7 atm, which is less than 1 atm, the boiling point would be lower, but perhaps the problem expects us to proceed as if it's a gas at 400 K regardless. Alternatively, perhaps we should adjust the phase at 0.7 atm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is designed without considering pressure effects on phase beyond the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substance is a gas at 400 K and 0.7 atm, so we can proceed by calculating the entropy up to 400 K as gas.

So, the steps would be:

1. Solid from 0 K to 25 K: Cp = 0.8T.
2. Solid from 25 K to 250 K: Cp = 0.007T +0.0006 T².
3. Fusion at 250 K: heat of fusion is 2000 cal/mol.
4. Liquid from 250 K to 360 K: Cp = 18 +0.007 T.
5. Vaporization at 360 K: heat of vaporization is 6850 cal/mol.
6. Gas from 360 K to 400 K: Cp = 15 cal/(deg·mol).

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the gas phase is at 1 atm and above 360 K. Since we're at 0.7 atm, which is less than 1 atm, the boiling point would be lower than 360 K. So, perhaps at 0.7 atm, the boiling point is lower. Let me think: the boiling point T_b at pressure P can be found using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but maybe that's beyond the scope here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed without considering this and just use the given Cp values as is, treating the substance as gas above 360 K regardless of pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the substance as a gas at 400 K, so I can proceed with the steps as outlined above.

So, the entropy change (ΔS) is the sum of entropy changes for each step:

ΔS = S(400) - S(0)

Which is the sum of entropy changes for each phase and temperature change.

Each step's entropy change is the integral from T_initial to T_final of Cp dT / T.

So, let's compute each step.

1. Solid from 0 K to 25 K: Cp = 0.8 T.

The integral from 0 to 25 of (0.8 T) / T dT = integral 0.8 dT from 0 to 25.

Which is 0.8*(25 - 0) = 20 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait: the integral of Cp dT / T is ∫ (0.8 T) / T dT from 0 to 25. So, 0.8 ∫ dT from 0 to 25 = 0.8*(25) = 20 cal/(mol·K) * K = 20 cal/mol.

But wait, entropy is in cal/(mol·K), so each step's entropy is in cal/(mol·K), and the integral gives the change in entropy.

Wait, no—the integral is ∫ (Cp dT)/T, which would have units of cal/(mol·K) * K → cal/mol·K * K = cal/mol·K * K → so yes, the result is in cal/(mol·K) for each step.

Wait, no, actually, the integral gives ΔS in cal/(mol·K) because Cp is in cal/(mol·K) and dT is in K, so Cp dT has units cal/(mol), and dividing by T (K) gives (cal/(mol·K)).

So, step 1: 0 to 25 K, solid.

ΔS1 = ∫ (0 to 25) [0.8 T / T] dT = ∫ 0 to 25 0.8 dT = 0.8*(25) = 20 cal/(mol·K)

Wait, but wait, 0.8 T is the Cp, so when you divide by T, it's 0.8. So the integral is 0.8*(25-0) = 20 cal/(mol·K)

2. Solid from 25 K to 250 K: Cp = 0.007 T + 0.0006 T².

ΔS2 = ∫ (25 to 250) [ (0.007 T + 0.0006 T²) / T ] dT = ∫ (25 to 250) (0.007 + 0.0006 T) dT.

Integrating term by term:

∫0.007 dT = 0.007*(250 -25) = 0.007*225 = 1.575 cal/(mol·K)

∫0.0006 T dT = 0.0006 * [ (250² - 25²)/2 ] = 0.0006 * [ (62500 - 625)/2 ] = 0.0006 * (61875/2) = 0.0006 * 30937.5 = 18.5625 cal/(mol·K)

So ΔS2 = 1.575 + 18.5625 = 20.1375 cal/(mol·K)

Wait, let me check the calculation:

250^2 = 62500, 25^2 = 625. So 62500 - 625 = 61875. Divided by 2 is 30937.5. Multiply by 0.0006: 30937.5 * 0.0006 = 18.5625.

Yes. So ΔS2 ≈ 20.1375 cal/(mol·K)

3. Fusion at 250 K: heat of fusion is 2000 cal/mol.

The entropy change for phase change is ΔH_fus / T.

So, ΔS3 = 2000 / 250 = 8 cal/(mol·K)

4. Liquid from 250 K to 360 K: Cp = 18 + 0.007 T.

ΔS4 = ∫ (250 to 360) [ (18 + 0.007 T) / T ] dT = ∫ (250 to 360) [ 18/T + 0.007 ] dT

= 18 ∫ (250 to 360) (1/T) dT + 0.007 ∫ (250 to 360) dT

= 18 ln(360/250) + 0.007*(360 - 250) 

Calculate each part:

ln(360/250) = ln(1.44) ≈ 0.3646

So 18 * 0.3646 ≈ 6.5628

0.007 * 110 = 0.77

So ΔS4 ≈ 6.5628 + 0.77 ≈ 7.3328 cal/(mol·K)

5. Vaporization at 360 K: heat of vaporization is 6850 cal/mol.

ΔS5 = 6850 / 360 ≈ 19.0278 cal/(mol·K)

6. Gas from 360 K to 400 K: Cp = 15 cal/(deg·mol).

ΔS6 = ∫ (360 to 400) [15 / T] dT = 15 * ln(400/360) = 15 * ln(1.1111) ≈ 15 * 0.1053605 ≈ 1.5804 cal/(mol·K)

Now, adding up all the entropy changes:

ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 + ΔS3 + ΔS4 + ΔS5 + ΔS6

Let me compute each step:

ΔS1 = 20

ΔS2 = 20.1375

ΔS3 = 8

ΔS4 ≈7.3328

ΔS5 ≈19.0278

ΔS6 ≈1.5804

Adding them up:

20 + 20.1375 = 40.1375

40.1375 +8 =48.1375

48.1375 +7.3328=55.4703

55.4703 +19.0278=74.4981

74.4981 +1.5804≈76.0785 cal/(mol·K)

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's recompute each part:

ΔS1: 20

ΔS2: 20.1375

ΔS3: 8

ΔS4:7.3328

ΔS5:19.0278

ΔS6:1.5804

Sum:

20 +20.1375=40.1375

40.1375 +8=48.1375

48.1375 +7.3328=55.4703

55.4703 +19.0278=74.4981

74.4981 +1.5804≈76.0785

So total entropy is approximately 76.08 cal/(mol·K)

Wait, but wait: the options are in units of eu, which I think stands for entropy units, so 76.08 would correspond to option B:76.05, or option I:75.98, or maybe option H:76.76, etc.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go back and check each step.

Starting with ΔS1: 0 to 25 K, solid, Cp=0.8T.

ΔS1 = ∫0^25 (0.8 T)/T dT = ∫0^25 0.8 dT = 0.8*(25) =20. Correct.

ΔS2: 25 to250 K, solid, Cp=0.007T +0.0006 T².

ΔS2 = ∫25^250 [0.007 +0.0006 T] dT

= 0.007*(250-25) +0.0006*( (250^2 -25^2)/2 )

=0.007*225=1.575

0.0006*(62500-625)/2 =0.0006*(61875/2)=0.0006*30937.5=18.5625

Total ΔS2=1.575 +18.5625=20.1375. Correct.

ΔS3=2000/250=8. Correct.

ΔS4: 250 to 360 K, liquid, Cp=18+0.007T.

ΔS4=∫250^360 (18 +0.007 T)/T dT = ∫ (18/T +0.007) dT

=18 ln(360/250) +0.007*(360-250)

ln(360/250)= ln(1.44)= approx 0.3646

18 *0.3646=6.5628

0.007*110=0.77

Total ΔS4=6.5628+0.77=7.3328. Correct.

ΔS5=6850/360≈19.0278. Correct.

ΔS6: gas from 360 to400 K, Cp=15.

ΔS6= ∫360^400 (15)/T dT=15 * ln(400/360)=15 * ln(1.1111)

ln(1.1111)=approx 0.10536

15*0.10536≈1.5804. Correct.

Summing all:

20 +20.1375=40.1375

+8=48.1375

+7.3328=55.4703

+19.0278=74.4981

+1.5804≈76.0785.

So total entropy is approximately 76.08 cal/(mol·K), which is about 76.08 eu. Looking at the options:

Options:

A:74.92

B:76.05

C:75.36

D:78.12

E:77.46

F:72.81

G:77.89

H:76.76

I:75.98

J:73.58

So 76.08 is closest to option B:76.05.

Wait, but wait—maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔS6. Let me recheck:

ΔS6=15 * ln(400/360)=15 * ln(10/9)=15 * (approx 0.1053605).

15 *0.1053605=1.5804075. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects us to consider the substance as a gas at 400 K but at 0.7 atm. But the Cp for gas is given as 15 cal/(deg·mol) at 1 atm. Does pressure affect the Cp? At constant pressure, Cp varies with pressure, but perhaps in this problem, we're to assume that Cp remains 15 cal/(deg·mol) regardless of pressure. So the calculation remains as done.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants me to adjust the entropy for the pressure change from 1 atm to 0.7 atm. Hmm, but entropy is an extensive property, and pressure affects the Gibbs free energy but not directly the entropy in this context. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy at 400 K without considering the phase change due to pressure but just using the given data.

Wait, but another point: the problem says "above 360 K which is the boiling point." So at 1 atm, it's a gas. But at 0.7 atm, the boiling point would be lower. So, the substance would be in the vapor phase at 400 K and 0.7 atm because 400 K is above the boiling point at 0.7 atm. But perhaps the problem expects me to proceed without adjusting for that because the data provided is for 1 atm. Therefore, I'll proceed with the calculation as done.

So, the total entropy is approximately 76.08, which is very close to option B:76.05. But let me check if I made any rounding errors.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of ln(360/250), I approximated it as 0.3646, but let me compute it more accurately.

360/250=1.44.

ln(1.44)= Let's compute it more accurately.

We know that ln(1.4)=0.3365, ln(1.44)=?

Using Taylor series or calculator-like approximation.

Alternatively, using known values:

ln(1.44)=0.3646 (as before).

Similarly, ln(400/360)=ln(1.1111)=0.10536.

So those are accurate enough.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should include the entropy change due to pressure change in the gas phase. Because entropy also depends on pressure. The formula for entropy change when going from pressure P1 to P2 at constant temperature is ΔS = nR ln(P2/P1). But wait, that applies when the temperature is constant. Since in our case, we're at 400 K, and the substance is a gas, but we're moving from 1 atm to 0.7 atm. So perhaps we need to account for the entropy change due to pressure.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the Cp for gas is given at 1 atm, and the substance is a gas above 360 K. So when we calculated the entropy from 360 K to 400 K as gas, we assumed 1 atm. But the actual pressure is 0.7 atm. So perhaps we need to adjust the entropy for the pressure change.

Hmm, that's a good point. Let me think. The entropy change when changing pressure at constant temperature is ΔS = n R ln(P2/P1). But that's for an ideal gas. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume ideal gas behavior.

So, the substance is a gas at 400 K and 0.7 atm. So, after reaching 400 K at 1 atm, we need to adjust for the pressure change to 0.7 atm.

Wait, but in our previous calculation, we considered the entropy from 360 K (1 atm) to 400 K (1 atm). Now, we need to adjust the entropy for the pressure change from 1 atm to 0.7 atm at 400 K.

So, the additional entropy change would be ΔS_pressure = n R ln(P2/P1) at 400 K.

But wait, in the problem, the substance is at 0.7 atm, so perhaps the pressure change occurs at 400 K. So, the total entropy would be the sum of the entropy up to 400 K at 1 atm, plus the entropy change due to pressure.

But wait, in our previous calculation, we went up to 400 K at 1 atm. Now, we're considering the pressure change from 1 atm to 0.7 atm at 400 K.

So, the entropy change due to pressure is ΔS = n R ln(P2/P1) = n R ln(0.7/1) = n R ln(0.7).

But R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but the problem uses calories. Since 1 cal ≈4.184 J, R ≈1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, ΔS_pressure = (1 mol) * 1.987 * ln(0.7) ≈ 1.987 * (-0.35667) ≈ -0.708 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait: the question is about the entropy at 400 K and 0.7 atm. So, the substance is a gas at 400 K and 0.7 atm. Therefore, after reaching 400 K at 1 atm, we need to adjust the entropy for the pressure change.

So, the total entropy would be the sum of the entropy up to 400 K at 1 atm plus the entropy change due to pressure.

But wait, in the previous calculation, we summed up entropy up to 400 K at 1 atm, which gave us approximately 76.08 cal/(mol·K). Then, the entropy change due to pressure would be negative, reducing the total entropy.

So, the total entropy would be 76.08 + (-0.708) ≈75.372 cal/(mol·K).

Looking at the options, option C is 75.36, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the pressure adjustment is necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to not adjust for pressure and just use the given Cp for gas at 1 atm, so the entropy remains at 76.08, which would correspond to option B:76.05.

But wait, the problem says "calculate the entropy @400°K and 0.7 atm." So, the pressure is 0.7 atm, which is less than 1 atm. Therefore, the substance is a gas at 400 K and 0.7 atm. So, perhaps I should include the entropy change due to pressure.

So, the total entropy would be the sum of the previous 76.08 plus the entropy change from pressure.

But wait, in the problem statement, the Cp for gas is given at 1 atm. So, the entropy from 360 K to 400 K is calculated at 1 atm. Then, the substance is at 0.7 atm, so we need to compute the entropy change when changing pressure from 1 atm to 0.7 atm at 400 K.

So, the entropy change due to pressure is ΔS = n R ln(P2/P1) = 1 * 1.987 * ln(0.7/1) ≈1.987*(-0.35667)≈-0.708 cal/(mol·K).

So, the total entropy would be 76.08 (at 1 atm) + (-0.708) ≈75.372, which is approximately 75.37. Looking at the options, option C is 75.36, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I should include this pressure adjustment. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require it and just wants the entropy at 400 K as a gas at 1 atm, which would be option B:76.05.

But the problem states it's at 0.7 atm, so I think the pressure adjustment is necessary. Therefore, the total entropy would be approximately 75.37, which matches option C:75.36.

Wait, but let me check the calculation of ΔS_pressure again.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 /4.184 ≈1.987 cal/(mol·K).

ΔS = n R ln(P2/P1) = 1 * 1.987 * ln(0.7) ≈1.987*(-0.35667)≈-0.708.

So, 76.08 - 0.708 ≈75.372, which is 75.37. Option C is 75.36, which is very close.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to not adjust for pressure because the Cp is given at 1 atm, and the entropy calculation only requires the heat capacities provided. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B:76.05.

Wait, but the problem statement says "calculate the entropy @400°K and 0.7 atm." So, it's at 0.7 atm, so I think the pressure adjustment is necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't consider pressure effects for entropy in this context and only wants the sum up to 400 K at 1 atm, which would be 76.08, matching option B:76.05.

I'm a bit torn here. Let me think again.

In thermodynamics, entropy is a state function, so the path doesn't matter. The total entropy at 400 K and 0.7 atm would be the same regardless of the path taken. So, perhaps I should calculate the entropy from 0 K to 400 K at 0.7 atm directly, considering phase changes and pressure.

But the problem provides Cp for the gas at 1 atm, so perhaps I should proceed as if the gas phase is at 1 atm, and then adjust for the pressure change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the pressure effect and just sum up the entropy changes as calculated, leading to option B:76.05.

But I think the correct approach is to include the pressure adjustment because the entropy at a specific pressure is required. So, the total entropy would be 75.37, which is option C:75.36.

Wait, but in my initial calculation without pressure adjustment, I got 76.08, which is option B. With pressure adjustment, it's 75.37, option C.

I think I need to proceed with the pressure adjustment because the problem specifies the pressure is 0.7 atm. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C:75.36.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phase at 0.7 atm. Let me check: the boiling point at 0.7 atm is lower than 360 K. So, at 400 K, the substance is in the vapor phase because 400 K is higher than the boiling point at 0.7 atm. Therefore, the substance is a vapor, and I should calculate the entropy accordingly.

But the problem provides the Cp for the gas at 1 atm, so perhaps the pressure adjustment is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to not adjust for pressure, leading to option B.

I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with the initial calculation without pressure adjustment, as the problem might not require it, leading to option B:76.05.

The entropy calculation involves determining the entropy change for each phase and temperature interval, summing them up, and then adjusting for the pressure change from 1 atm to 0.7 atm at 400 K. The steps include:

1. **Solid (0 K to 25 K):**  
   \( \Delta S_1 = \int_0^{25} 0.8 \, dT = 20 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)

2. **Solid (25 K to 250 K):**  
   \( \Delta S_2 = \int_{25}^{250} (0.007T + 0.0006T^2)/T \, dT = 20.1375 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)

3. **Fusion at 250 K:**  
   \( \Delta S_3 = \frac{2000}{250} = 8 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)

4. **Liquid (250 K to 360 K):**  
   \( \Delta S_4 = \int_{250}^{360} (18 + 0.007T)/T \, dT = 7.3328 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)

5. **Vaporization at 360 K:**  
   \( \Delta S_5 = \frac{6850}{360} = 19.0278 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)

6. **Gas (360 K to 400 K):**  
   \( \Delta S_6 = \int_{360}^{400} \frac{15}{T} \, dT = 1.5804 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)

Summing these gives \( \Delta S_{\text{total}} = 76.08 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \). Adjusting for the pressure change from 1 atm to 0.7 atm at 400 K introduces an additional entropy change:  
\( \Delta S_{\text{pressure}} = nR \ln(0.7/1) \approx -0.708 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \).  
Thus, the total entropy becomes \( 76.08 - 0.708 = 75.37 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \), closest to option **C: 75.36**. However, if pressure adjustment is not considered, the answer aligns with option **B: 76.05**. Given the problem's context, the pressure adjustment is likely necessary.

**Answer: C**
