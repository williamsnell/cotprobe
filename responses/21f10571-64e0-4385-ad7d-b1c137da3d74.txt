Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem about garden peas and their pod shapes. Let's see, the question gives me the frequencies of the F and f genes as 0.6 and 0.4 respectively. They're in genetic equilibrium, which I think means they're in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The population is allowed to reproduce by self-fertilization for three generations, and I need to find out the genotype distribution after the third generation.

Hmm, I remember that in self-fertilization, each plant produces offspring by fertilizing itself. So each plant's genotype will produce a certain proportion of each genotype in the next generation. Since they're starting from a Hardy-Weinberg population, the initial genotype frequencies are p², 2pq, q² for FF, Ff, and ff respectively. 

Wait, wait, p is the frequency of F, which is 0.6, and q is f at 0.4. So the initial genotype frequencies would be:

FF: 0.6² = 0.36
Ff: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48
ff: 0.4² = 0.16

But wait, the question says the population is allowed to reproduce by self-fertilization. So each plant will produce offspring based on its own genotype. Because selfing affects the genotype distribution each generation.

I think in each selfing generation, the genotype frequencies shift. Let's think about how each genotype selfs.

For example, an FF plant selfing will only produce FF offspring because all gametes are F. Similarly, an ff plant will only produce ff. But an Ff plant, when selfed, produces Ff, FF, and ff in the ratio of 25% FF, 50% Ff, and 25% ff. Wait no, wait, more accurately, when Ff selfs, it's like a monohybrid cross. The expected offspring would be 25% FF, 50% Ff, and 25% ff.

But wait, in the next generation, each plant's genotype affects its own offspring. So the process is that each plant in the current generation produces the next generation. So the next generation's genotype frequencies are a weighted average based on each parent's frequency and their selfing outcome.

Let me model this step by step for each generation.

Starting with generation 0:

p = 0.6 (F), q = 0.4 (f)
Genotype frequencies:
FF: 0.36
Ff: 0.48
ff: 0.16

After one generation of selfing (generation 1):

Each FF plant produces only FF.
Each Ff plant produces 25% FF, 50% Ff, 25% ff.
Each ff plant produces only ff.

So the new genotype frequencies are calculated as:

FF = (Proportion of FF in parent) * 1 (since they only produce FF) + (Proportion of Ff in parent) * 0.25 + (Proportion of ff in parent) * 0 (since they don't contribute to FF)
Similarly,

FF = 0.36 * 1 + 0.48 * 0.25 + 0.16 * 0
FF = 0.36 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.48

Ff = 0.36 * 0 + 0.48 * 0.5 + 0.16 * 0 = 0.24

ff = 0.36 * 0 + 0.48 * 0.25 + 0.16 * 1 = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Wait, but that adds up to 0.48 + 0.24 + 0.28 = 1. So that's correct.

So generation 1: 0.48 FF, 0.24 Ff, 0.28 ff.

Now, moving to generation 2:

We take each genotype in generation 1 and compute their contributions.

FF: 0.48
Each FF plant produces only FF, so contributes 0.48 * 1 to FF in G2.

Ff: 0.24
Each Ff plant contributes 0.25 FF, 0.5 Ff, 0.25 ff. So 0.24 * 0.25 = 0.06 to FF, 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.12 to Ff, 0.24 * 0.25 = 0.06 to ff.

ff: 0.28
Each ff plant contributes only ff, so 0.28 * 1 to ff.

So G2:

FF = 0.48 * 1 + 0.24 * 0.25 + 0.28 * 0
FF = 0.48 + 0.06 + 0 = 0.54

Ff = 0.48 * 0 + 0.24 * 0.5 + 0.28 * 0 = 0 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.12

ff = 0.48 * 0 + 0.24 * 0.25 + 0.28 * 1 = 0 + 0.06 + 0.28 = 0.34

Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.54 + 0.12 + 0.34 = 1, but looking at the options, I see that option A is 0.54FF, 0.12Ff, 0.34ff. But wait, let me check the math again.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:

In G1, the genotype frequencies are:
FF: 0.48
Ff: 0.24
ff: 0.28

When each plant selfs:

FF (0.48) produces all FF → contributes 0.48 to FF in G2.

Ff (0.24) produces 25% FF, 50% Ff, 25% ff. So:
FF: 0.24 * 0.25 = 0.06
Ff: 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.12
ff: 0.24 * 0.25 = 0.06

ff (0.28) produces all ff → contributes 0.28 to ff in G2.

So summing up:

FF in G2: 0.48 (from FF) + 0.06 (from Ff) = 0.54
Ff in G2: 0.12 (only from Ff)
ff in G2: 0.28 + 0.06 = 0.34

So G2 is 0.54 FF, 0.12 Ff, 0.34 ff. Which matches option A.

But wait, the question says three generations. So we need to go to G3.

So G2 is 0.54 FF, 0.12 Ff, 0.34 ff.

Now, for G3:

Each genotype in G2 will self.

FF: 0.54 → produces only FF, so contributes 0.54 to FF in G3.

Ff: 0.12 → each produces 25% FF, 50% Ff, 25% ff.
So contributions:
FF: 0.12 * 0.25 = 0.03
Ff: 0.12 * 0.5 = 0.06
ff: 0.12 * 0.25 = 0.03

ff: 0.34 → produces only ff, contributes 0.34 to ff in G3.

Thus, G3 genotype frequencies:

FF = 0.54 (from FF) + 0.03 (from Ff) = 0.57
Ff = 0.06 (from Ff)
ff = 0.34 (from ff) + 0.03 (from Ff) = 0.37

Wait, so G3 is FF: 0.57, Ff: 0.06, ff: 0.37. That would be option F: 0.57FF + 0.06Ff + 0.37ff.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is exactly that. So the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, in G2, the Ff was 0.12, so when it selfs, it contributes:

FF: 0.12 * 0.25 = 0.03

Ff: 0.12 * 0.5 = 0.06

ff: 0.12 * 0.25 = 0.03

And the FF in G2 contributes 0.54 to FF in G3.

The ff in G2 is 0.34, which contributes 0.34 to ff in G3.

So FF in G3: 0.54 + 0.03 = 0.57

Ff in G3: 0.06

ff in G3: 0.34 + 0.03 = 0.37

Wait, but 0.57 + 0.06 + 0.37 = 1. So that's correct.

So the distribution after three generations is 0.57 FF, 0.06 Ff, 0.37 ff, which matches option F.
</think>

To determine the genotype distribution after three generations of self-fertilization, we start with the initial genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:

- **p = 0.6** (frequency of F),  
- **q = 0.4** (frequency of f).  

The initial genotype frequencies are:  
- **FF**: \( p^2 = 0.36 \),  
- **Ff**: \( 2pq = 0.48 \),  
- **ff**: \( q^2 = 0.16 \).  

### Generation 1:
Each plant self-fertilizes:  
- **FF** plants produce only **FF** offspring.  
- **Ff** plants produce offspring in the ratio:  
  \( 0.25 \, FF : 0.5 \, Ff : 0.25 \, ff \).  
- **ff** plants produce only **ff** offspring.  

The new genotype frequencies are:  
- **FF**: \( 0.36 \times 1 + 0.48 \times 0.25 + 0.16 \times 0 = 0.48 \),  
- **Ff**: \( 0.36 \times 0 + 0.48 \times 0.5 + 0.16 \times 0 = 0.24 \),  
- **ff**: \( 0.36 \times 0 + 0.48 \times 0.25 + 0.16 \times 1 = 0.28 \).  

### Generation 2:
Repeat the self-fertilization process for each genotype:  
- **FF** plants contribute \( 0.48 \) to **FF**.  
- **Ff** plants contribute:  
  \( 0.24 \times 0.25 = 0.06 \) to **FF**,  
  \( 0.24 \times 0.5 = 0.12 \) to **Ff**,  
  \( 0.24 \times 0.25 = 0.06 \) to **ff**.  
- **ff** plants contribute \( 0.28 \) to **ff**.  

The new genotype frequencies are:  
- **FF**: \( 0.48 + 0.06 = 0.54 \),  
- **Ff**: \( 0.12 \),  
- **ff**: \( 0.28 + 0.06 = 0.34 \).  

### Generation 3:
Repeat the self-fertilization process again:  
- **FF** plants contribute \( 0.54 \) to **FF**.  
- **Ff** plants contribute:  
  \( 0.12 \times 0.25 = 0.03 \) to **FF**,  
  \( 0.12 \times 0.5 = 0.06 \) to **Ff**,  
  \( 0.12 \times 0.25 = 0.03 \) to **ff**.  
- **ff** plants contribute \( 0.34 \) to **ff**.  

The final genotype frequencies after three generations are:  
- **FF**: \( 0.54 + 0.03 = 0.57 \),  
- **Ff**: \( 0.06 \),  
- **ff**: \( 0.34 + 0.03 = 0.37 \).  

The distribution matches **Option F**: \( 0.57 \, FF + 0.06 \, Ff + 0.37 \, ff \).

**Answer: F**
