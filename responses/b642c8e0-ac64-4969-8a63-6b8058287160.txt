Question:

The discovery of the element argon by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay had its origins in Rayleigh's measurements of the density of nitrogen with an eye toward accurate determination of its molar mass. Rayleigh prepared some samples of nitrogen by chemical reaction of nitrogencontaining compounds; under his standard conditions, a glass globe filled with this 'chemical nitrogen' had a mass of $2.2990 \mathrm{~g}$. He prepared other samples by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour from atmospheric air; under the same conditions, this 'atmospheric nitrogen' had a mass of $2.3102 \mathrm{~g}$ (Lord Rayleigh, Royal Institution Proceedings 14, 524 (1895)). With the hindsight of knowing accurate values for the molar masses of nitrogen and argon, compute the mole fraction of argon in the latter sample on the assumption that the former was pure nitrogen and the latter a mixture of nitrogen and argon.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the discovery of argon by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay. The question is about finding the mole fraction of argon in a sample of atmospheric nitrogen. Hmm, I remember that argon was discovered because there was a slight discrepancy in the density of nitrogen obtained from different methods, which they later attributed to the presence of argon gas.

Alright, let's break this down. The problem gives me two masses of nitrogen samples. The first is 'chemical nitrogen' with a mass of 2.2990 grams, and the second is 'atmospheric nitrogen' with 2.3102 grams. Both were measured under the same conditions, so their volumes should be the same because the same conditions mean same temperature and pressure. Since volume is the same, the number of moles would be proportional to their masses divided by molar mass. Wait, no, actually, the ideal gas law says that n = PV/RT, so if P, V, R, T are same, then n is the same for same pressure, volume, and temperature. But wait, in this case, the samples are prepared differently, so the molar amounts might be different.

Wait, wait, the key point is that Rayleigh found that the density of nitrogen from chemical reactions was slightly less than that from atmospheric air. He thought it was because atmospheric nitrogen had a different composition. So the atmospheric nitrogen sample actually contains a small amount of argon, making it slightly heavier.

So the problem states that, knowing the accurate molar masses now, we need to compute the mole fraction of argon in the atmospheric nitrogen sample. The given data is:

- Mass of chemical nitrogen (pure N2) = 2.2990 g
- Mass of atmospheric nitrogen (mixture of N2 and Ar) = 2.3102 g

I think the approach is to compare the masses assuming that the volume is the same. Since they're under the same conditions, the number of moles would be the same if the molar mass is the same. But in atmospheric nitrogen, the presence of argon increases the mass for the same number of moles.

Wait, let me think again. If both samples were nitrogen, they should have the same density, but the atmospheric sample is denser because of argon. So when Rayleigh measured atmospheric nitrogen, it was heavier because some of it was argon.

So, let's denote:

Let’s assume that the atmospheric nitrogen sample is a mixture of N2 and Ar. The mass of this mixture is 2.3102 g, and the mass of pure N2 (from chemical reaction) is 2.2990 g.

Wait, but both samples are in the same volume. So the number of moles for each sample under the same conditions would be different because their masses are different. Wait no, same volume, same temperature, same pressure implies same number of moles for ideal gases. Wait, that can't be right because if the molar masses are different, the masses would be different for same moles. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to calculate the moles of each gas and account for the presence of argon in the atmospheric sample.

Let me define some variables. Let me denote:

Let’s say the atmospheric sample has a total mass of m_total = 2.3102 g, which is a mixture of N2 and Ar. The chemical nitrogen sample is pure N2 with mass m_pure = 2.2990 g.

Assuming that both samples were prepared under the same volume, temperature, and pressure, so the number of moles should be the same if the molar mass were the same. But since atmospheric nitrogen is heavier, it has more mass for the same moles, implying that some of it is a heavier gas like argon.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is that both samples have the same number of moles. So, the moles of chemical nitrogen (n_chem) would be m_chem / M_N2, where M_N2 is the molar mass of N2.

Similarly, the atmospheric sample has moles n_atm = m_atm / M_mixture, where M_mixture is the average molar mass of the mixture.

But wait, if the volume, temperature, and pressure are same, then n_chem = n_atm. So, m_chem / M_N2 = m_atm / M_mixture.

That makes sense. Because if the number of moles is same, then mass is proportional to molar mass.

So, rearranging, M_mixture = (m_atm * M_N2 ) / m_chem.

Given that, we can calculate M_mixture.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

m_chem = 2.2990 g
m_atm = 2.3102 g
M_N2 = 28.014 g/mol (I think the problem says to use accurate values. Wait, the problem says to assume the molar masses are accurate, so perhaps we can use M_N2 = 28.014 g/mol and M_Ar=39.948 g/mol.)

So,

M_mixture = (2.3102 g * 28.014 g/mol) / 2.2990 g

Let me compute that.

First, compute numerator: 2.3102 * 28.014.

2.3102 * 28.014 = let's approximate.

28 * 2.3102 = 64.6856, but since it's 28.014, it's a bit more. Let's compute precisely:

28.014 * 2.3102:

28 * 2.3102 = 64.6856
0.014 * 2.3102 = approx 0.0323428
Total ≈ 64.6856 + 0.0323428 ≈ 64.71794

So numerator ≈ 64.71794 g²/mol.

Denominator is 2.2990 g.

So M_mixture = 64.71794 / 2.2990 ≈ let's calculate.

64.71794 ÷ 2.2990 ≈ Let's see.

2.2990 * 28 = 64.372

64.71794 - 64.372 = 0.34594

So, 0.34594 / 2.2990 ≈ 0.1507.

So M_mixture ≈ 28 + 0.1507 ≈ 28.1507 g/mol.

Wait, that's the average molar mass of the atmospheric nitrogen sample.

Now, since the mixture is N2 and Ar, the average molar mass M_mixture is:

M_mixture = (x * M_N2 + (1 - x) * M_Ar)

where x is the mole fraction of N2, and (1-x) is the mole fraction of Ar.

So,

28.1507 = x * 28.014 + (1 - x) * 39.948

Let me solve for x.

Expanding,

28.1507 = 28.014 x + 39.948 (1 - x)

28.1507 = 28.014 x + 39.948 - 39.948 x

Combine like terms:

28.1507 = (28.014 - 39.948) x + 39.948

Calculate the coefficient:

28.014 - 39.948 = -11.934

So,

28.1507 = -11.934 x + 39.948

Subtract 39.948 from both sides:

28.1507 - 39.948 = -11.934 x

-11.7973 = -11.934 x

Divide both sides by -11.934:

x = (-11.7973) / (-11.934) ≈ 0.9889.

So x ≈ 0.9889.

That's the mole fraction of N2 in the mixture. So the mole fraction of Ar is 1 - x ≈ 1 - 0.9889 = 0.0111.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.011, which matches this value.

The problem involves determining the mole fraction of argon in a sample of atmospheric nitrogen, which was found to be slightly denser than nitrogen obtained from chemical reactions. This discrepancy was due to the presence of argon. The approach involves calculating the average molar mass of the atmospheric nitrogen sample and then using it to find the mole fraction of argon.

1. **Given Data**:
   - Mass of pure nitrogen (chemical nitrogen): $m_{\text{chem}} = 2.2990 \, \mathrm{g}$
   - Mass of atmospheric nitrogen (mixture of $N_2$ and $Ar$): $m_{\text{atm}} = 2.3102 \, \mathrm{g}$
   - Molar mass of nitrogen ($M_{N_2}$): $28.014 \, \mathrm{g/mol}$
   - Molar mass of argon ($M_{Ar}$): $39.948 \, \mathrm{g/mol}$

2. **Key Assumption**:
   - The atmospheric nitrogen sample and the chemical nitrogen sample were prepared under the same conditions (same volume, temperature, and pressure), meaning they have the same number of moles.

3. **Calculation of Average Molar Mass**:
   Using the relationship $n_{\text{chem}} = n_{\text{atm}}$, the average molar mass of the atmospheric nitrogen sample is calculated as:
   \[
   M_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{m_{\text{atm}} \cdot M_{N_2}}{m_{\text{chem}}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   M_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{2.3102 \cdot 28.014}{2.2990} \approx 28.1507 \, \mathrm{g/mol}
   \]

4. **Mole Fraction of Argon**:
   The average molar mass of the mixture is related to the mole fractions of $N_2$ and $Ar$:
   \[
   M_{\text{mixture}} = x \cdot M_{N_2} + (1 - x) \cdot M_{Ar}
   \]
   Substituting $M_{\text{mixture}} = 28.1507 \, \mathrm{g/mol}$, $M_{N_2} = 28.014 \, \mathrm{g/mol}$, and $M_{Ar} = 39.948 \, \mathrm{g/mol}$:
   \[
   28.1507 = x \cdot 28.014 + (1 - x) \cdot 39.948
   \]
   Solving for $x$ (mole fraction of $N_2$):
   \[
   x \approx 0.9889
   \]
   The mole fraction of argon is:
   \[
   1 - x \approx 1 - 0.9889 = 0.0111
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   The mole fraction of argon in the atmospheric nitrogen sample is approximately $0.011$, which corresponds to option **B**.
