Alright, so I've got this question about the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to genetic relatedness, the closer the relatives, the more genes they share. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact percentages or fractions. Let me try to think this through.

First cousins are the children of siblings, right? So each parent of the cousins shares the same parents. I think the way this works is that each parent passes on half their genes to each child. So, for first cousins, they don't share the same parents, but their parents are siblings.

Let me break it down. Each person has two parents, and each parent contributes half their genes. So, when two people are siblings, they share about 50% of their genes because each gets half from each parent. But cousins are one generation apart.

Wait, so if two people are first cousins, their parents are siblings. So each cousin shares one grandparent with the other. Let me visualize this. Each cousin has two parents, and each parent has two siblings (the other cousins' parents). So, how much do they share?

I think the formula for the coefficient of relatedness is based on the number of generations apart. First cousins are two generations apart. The formula is 1/(2^n), where n is the number of generations. So for cousins, n=2, that would be 1/(2^2) = 1/4. Wait, but wait, isn't that for a parent and child? No, wait, parent and child share 50%, which is 1/2, so n=1 there.

But for first cousins, it's n=2. So 1/4? But wait, I've heard that first cousins share about 12.5% of their genes. Oh, wait, 1/8? Or is it 1/4?

Wait, I might be mixing this up. Let me think again. Each cousin's parent is a sibling, so each parent shares about 50% of their genes with the other parent. Then, each cousin gets half of their genes from each parent. So, the overlap between the cousins would be (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4, but wait, that can't be right because that's 25%, which seems high for cousins.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it differently. The coefficient of relatedness, or the proportion of genes shared, for first cousins is typically about 12.5%, which is 1/8. Because each cousin's parent is a sibling, so the parent's share 50% of their genes. Then, each cousin gets 50% from each parent, so the chance that a gene is shared is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4, but since there are two parents, it's 2*(1/4) = 1/2? No, that can't be.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that each pair of first cousins shares a set of grandparents. So each cousin has two parents, each of whom has two siblings (the other cousins' parents). So, the chance that a gene comes from the same grandparent is 1/2 for each parent, but since each cousin has two parents, it's more complex.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the formula for the proportion of shared genes between two relatives is (1/2)^(number of generations separating them). So, for siblings, it's (1/2)^1 = 1/2, which is 50%, which makes sense. For first cousins, the number of generations is 2, so (1/2)^2 = 1/4, which is 25%. But wait, that's not matching what I thought earlier about 12.5%.

I'm confused now. Maybe I'm mixing up the concept of consanguinity with cousin relations. Let me check another approach. The coefficient of relatedness (r) for first cousins is calculated as r = 1/4. Because each cousin's parent is a sibling, so each parent has a 1/2 chance of sharing a gene with the other parent. Then, each cousin gets half their genes from each parent. So, the probability that a gene is shared between cousins is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. But wait, that would be 25%, but I've read that it's actually 12.5%.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Because each cousin has two parents, and each parent has two siblings. So, the chance that a gene comes from a common grandparent is 1/2 (for each parent's side). But since each cousin has two parents, the total is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 for one parent, but since there are two parents, it's 2*(1/4) = 1/2? No, that's 50%, which can't be right.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me look for another way. The correct proportion for first cousins is 1/8, which is 12.5%. Because each cousin's parent has a 50% chance of sharing genes with the other parent, and each cousin gets half from each parent. So, the calculation is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 for one parent, but since there are two parents, it's (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2? No, that's not right either.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall that the coefficient of relatedness for first cousins is indeed 1/8. So the correct answer should be 1/8, which is option G.

The proportion of genes shared by first cousins on average is 1/8, which corresponds to option G.
