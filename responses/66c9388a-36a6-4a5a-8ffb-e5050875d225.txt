Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the diameter of a clean iron pipe. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my hydraulics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem states: the pipe is 10,000 feet long, oil is flowing at 8.93 cubic feet per second, and the head loss is 75 feet per pound. The viscosity (v) is given as 0.0001 ft²/s, and the relative roughness (epsilon) is 0.00015 ft. We need to find the diameter from the options provided.

Hmm, first, I remember that head loss in a pipe is related to the flow velocity, pipe diameter, and other factors. I think the formula we need here is the Chezy formula or maybe the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Wait, Chezy's formula is for open channels, right? So probably Darcy-Weisbach is the way to go since this is a pipe flow.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is: 

h_f = (f * L / D) * (v² / 2g)

Where:
- h_f is the head loss (75 ft lb/lb, but wait, units here might be a bit tricky. Oh, in the US system, head loss is in feet, so 75 ft)
- f is the Darcy friction factor
- L is the length of the pipe (10,000 ft)
- D is the diameter (what we're solving for)
- v is the velocity of the fluid (which I can calculate from the flow rate)
- g is acceleration due to gravity (32.2 ft/s²)

Wait, but to use this equation, I need the friction factor f. How do I find that? Oh right, using the Moody diagram, which relates f to the Reynolds number and the relative roughness (epsilon/D).

So first, I'll calculate the velocity v. Since the flow rate Q is 8.93 cfs (cubic feet per second), and Q = v * A, where A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. A for a pipe is πD²/4, so:

v = Q / (π D² /4) = (4 Q) / (π D²)

But wait, I don't know D yet, so maybe I can express things in terms of velocity and then find D.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe it's better to first find the velocity using the flow rate. But without D, that's tough. Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of velocity and then solve for D.

Wait, another approach: rearrange the Darcy-Weisbach equation to solve for D. But I still need f, which depends on D via the Reynolds number.

Hmm, perhaps I should first find the Reynolds number, which is Re = (v D) / v, where v is the kinematic viscosity. Wait, no: the Reynolds number is Re = (v * D) / ν, where ν is the dynamic viscosity. But wait, the problem gives v as 0.0001 ft²/s, which is the kinematic viscosity (ν = v = 0.0001 ft²/s). Wait no, kinematic viscosity is ν = μ/ρ, but in the equation, Re is (ρ v D) / μ, which can also be written as (v D) / ν, because ν = μ/ρ → Re = (v D) / ν.

So Re = (v * D) / ν. But I don't know D yet, so I'm stuck here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the velocity first. Let me see: since Q = 8.93 cfs, and Q = v * A = v * (π D²/4). So rearranging, v = (4 Q)/(π D²). But again, without D, I can't get v numerically yet.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of v. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the equation and solve for D.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate velocity v from Q and D: v = 4Q/(π D²)
2. Calculate Reynolds number Re = (v D) / ν → Re = (4 Q D)/(π D² ν) ) = (4 Q)/(π D ν)
3. Find friction factor f using Moody diagram based on Re and relative roughness ε/D.
4. Plug f into Darcy-Weisbach equation and solve for D.

This seems a bit circular, but perhaps I can substitute everything into the equation and solve for D.

Let me start by writing down the Darcy-Weisbach equation again:

h_f = (f * L / D) * (v² / 2g)

Substitute v from step 1: v = (4 Q)/(π D²)

So v² = (16 Q²)/(π² D^4)

Now, substitute into h_f equation:

h_f = (f * L / D) * (16 Q²)/(π² D^4 * 2g) )

Simplify:

h_f = (f * L * 16 Q²) / (2 π² D^5 g )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

h_f = (8 f L Q²) / (π² D^5 g )

Rearranging for D^5:

D^5 = (8 f L Q²) / (π² h_f g )

So D = [ (8 f L Q²) / (π² h_f g) ]^(1/5)

Hmm, but I still don't know f. So I need to find f based on Re and ε/D.

Let me compute Re in terms of D:

Re = (v D) / ν → substituting v = (4 Q)/(π D²):

Re = [ (4 Q)/(π D²) * D ] / ν = (4 Q D) / (π D² ν) ) = (4 Q)/(π D ν)

So Re = (4 Q)/(π D ν )

But I can write this as Re = (4 * 8.93) / (π D * 0.0001 )

Wait, Q is 8.93 cfs, so 4*8.93 = 35.72

So Re = 35.72 / (π D * 0.0001 )

Simplify denominator: π * D * 0.0001 ≈ 0.00031416 D

So Re ≈ 35.72 / (0.00031416 D) → Re ≈ 113,680 / D

Hmm, so Re is inversely proportional to D. Since D is in feet, and Re is unitless.

Now, the relative roughness ε/D is given as 0.00015 ft / D. So ε/D is 0.00015 / D.

Wait, but in the Moody diagram, for a given Re and ε/D, we find f. Since the pipe is clean iron, I think it's smooth or slightly rough, but let's assume it's in the smooth region where f is determined mainly by Re.

Wait, but clean iron pipes are usually in the smooth or transitional zone, so I think f can be approximated using the smooth pipe formula, where f = 64/Re for laminar flow (Re < 2100) but for turbulent flow, it's lower and varies.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Let me check Re. With D as an unknown, but let's make an initial assumption. Let's say D is around, say, 1 ft (but that's probably too big, since the options are in inches). Wait, the options are in inches, so D is in inches, but I need to convert to feet.

Wait, let me correct that: D is in feet. So if the options are in inches, I'll have to convert the answer from feet to inches at the end.

But first, perhaps I can make an initial guess for D to estimate Re and then f.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by expressing everything in terms of D.

Wait, let me try to write f in terms of Re and ε/D.

In the Moody diagram, for a given Re and ε/D, f is determined. Since ε/D is 0.00015/D, and D is in feet.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I can make an iterative approach. Let's try to proceed step by step.

Step 1: Express everything in terms of D.

We have:

h_f = (f * L / D) * (v² / 2g)

But v = 4Q/(π D²), so v² = 16 Q²/(π² D^4)

Substituting into h_f equation:

75 = (f * 10000 / D) * (16 * (8.93)^2) / (π² * D^4 * 2 * 32.2 )

Let me compute the constants:

Compute numerator: 16 * (8.93)^2 = 16 * 79.7449 ≈ 1275.9184

Denominator: π² * 2 * 32.2 ≈ (9.8696) * 64.4 ≈ 635.73

So 1275.9184 / 635.73 ≈ 2.007

So now, equation becomes:

75 = (f * 10000 / D) * (2.007 / D^4 )

Which simplifies to:

75 = (f * 10000 * 2.007) / D^5

So,

75 = (20070 f) / D^5

Rearranging,

D^5 = (20070 f) / 75 → D^5 ≈ 267.6 f

So D ≈ (267.6 f)^(1/5)

Now, I need to find f in terms of Re and ε/D.

From earlier, Re = 113680 / D

And ε/D = 0.00015 / D

So for a given D, I can compute Re and then find f from the Moody diagram.

This seems a bit tricky without a Moody diagram, but perhaps I can make an assumption about the flow regime.

Let's say D is around 1.5 ft, which is 18 inches, which is one of the options. Let me test D=1.5 ft.

Then Re = 113680 / 1.5 ≈ 75,787

That's a high Reynolds number, so the flow is definitely turbulent.

In the Moody diagram, for Re=75,787 and ε/D=0.00015/1.5=0.0001, which is 0.01%. Wait, 0.00015 ft is the absolute roughness, but relative to D=1.5 ft, ε/D=0.00015/1.5=0.0001.

Wait, 0.0001 is 0.01% of D. That's a very smooth pipe. So for Re=75,787 and ε/D=0.0001, f would be approximately 0.015 or lower.

Wait, looking at a Moody diagram, for Re=75,787 and smooth pipe (ε/D=0.0001), f is around 0.015.

Let me plug f=0.015 into the D equation.

D^5 = 267.6 * 0.015 ≈ 4.014

So D = (4.014)^(1/5). Let's compute that.

The fifth root of 4 is approximately 1.3195 ft, because 1.3^5 ≈ 3.71, and 1.32^5 ≈ 4.03. So D ≈ 1.32 ft, which is about 15.84 inches. Hmm, looking at the options, H is 15.3 in, F is 16.6 in. So maybe I'm a bit off. Let me check if f is correct.

Wait, perhaps my assumption of f=0.015 is incorrect. Let me see: for Re=75,787 and ε/D=0.0001, f is actually around 0.013 to 0.014.

Wait, maybe I should use the Swamee-Jain equation to estimate f. The Swamee-Jain formula is:

f = (-2.457 ln( ( (ε/D)^1.11 + 0.038 Re^(-0.22) ) ))^(-2/3)

Wait, but this is for the Moody chart for rough turbulent flow. Alternatively, for smooth pipes where ε/D is very small, the friction factor can be approximated as f ≈ 0.316 Re^(-1/4), but I think that's for very smooth pipes in the fully turbulent flow.

Wait, but let me try using the Swamee-Jain equation for Re=75,787 and ε/D=0.0001.

Compute ln( ( (0.0001/1.5)^1.11 + 0.038 * (75787)^(-0.22) ) )

Wait, no, wait, Swamee-Jain uses ε/D as the relative roughness, and Re as the Reynolds number.

So, let's compute:

ε/D = 0.00015 / 1.5 = 0.0001

So, compute the term inside the ln:

(ε/D)^1.11 + 0.038 * Re^(-0.22)

First, (0.0001)^1.11 ≈ ?

Well, 0.0001 is 1e-4. So (1e-4)^1.11 ≈ 1e-4.44 ≈ 3.48e-5.

Next, Re^(-0.22) = (75787)^(-0.22)

Compute ln(75787) ≈ 11.234

Multiply by -0.22: 11.234 * (-0.22) ≈ -2.471

Exponentiate: e^(-2.471) ≈ 0.084

So 0.038 * 0.084 ≈ 0.0032.

So the term inside the ln is 3.48e-5 + 0.0032 ≈ 0.0032348.

Now, ln(0.0032348) ≈ ln(0.0032) ≈ -5.806

Now, multiply by -2.457: -2.457 * (-5.806) ≈ 14.24

Then take the inverse power: f = (14.24)^(-2/3)

Compute 14.24^(1/3) ≈ 2.42, so (2.42)^2 ≈ 5.85. So f ≈ 1/5.85 ≈ 0.1708.

Wait, that's a higher f than I thought earlier. But that seems high for a smooth pipe at high Re. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation for very smooth pipes where f ≈ 0.316 Re^(-1/4).

So Re=75,787.

Re^(-1/4) = (75787)^(-0.25) ≈ 1/(75787^0.25)

Compute 75787^0.25: Let's compute sqrt(75787) ≈ 275.3, then sqrt(275.3) ≈ 16.59.

So Re^(-1/4) ≈ 1/16.59 ≈ 0.0603.

Then f ≈ 0.316 * 0.0603 ≈ 0.01906.

That seems more reasonable, around 0.019.

So let's try f=0.019.

Then D^5 = 267.6 * 0.019 ≈ 5.0844.

So D = (5.0844)^(1/5). Let's compute that.

The fifth root of 5 is about 1.379, because 1.379^5 ≈ 5.08. So D≈1.38 ft, which is 16.56 inches. Hmm, that's close to option F:16.6 in.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed D=1.5 ft, I got f=0.015, which led to D≈1.32 ft, but that didn't match any option closely. Alternatively, perhaps I should try another approach.

Wait, maybe I can set up an equation where D is the variable and solve numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the initial equation:

D^5 = (8 f L Q²) / (π² h_f g )

But f depends on Re and ε/D, which in turn depend on D. This is a bit circular, but perhaps I can make an initial guess for D, compute f, then compute D, and iterate until it converges.

Let me try this iterative approach.

First guess: Let's assume D=1.5 ft (18 inches), as before.

Compute Re = 113680 / 1.5 ≈ 75,787.

Compute ε/D = 0.00015/1.5 = 0.0001.

Use Swamee-Jain to find f.

Compute (ε/D)^1.11 = (0.0001)^1.11 ≈ 3.48e-5.

Compute Re^(-0.22) = (75787)^(-0.22) ≈ e^(-0.22 * ln(75787)).

ln(75787) ≈ 11.235. So -0.22 * 11.235 ≈ -2.4717.

e^(-2.4717) ≈ 0.084.

So 0.038 * 0.084 ≈ 0.0032.

Add to (ε/D)^1.11: 3.48e-5 + 0.0032 ≈ 0.0032348.

Take ln: ln(0.0032348) ≈ -5.806.

Multiply by -2.457: -2.457 * (-5.806) ≈ 14.23.

Take inverse to the power of (-2/3): (14.23)^(-2/3).

Compute 14.23^(1/3) ≈ 2.424. So (2.424)^2 ≈ 5.876. So f ≈ 1/5.876 ≈ 0.170.

Wait, that's a high f, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the smooth pipe approximation f ≈ 0.316 Re^(-1/4).

Re=75,787.

Re^(-1/4) ≈ (75,787)^( -0.25 ) ≈ 1/(75787^0.25 ).

Compute 75787^0.25: sqrt(sqrt(75787)).

sqrt(75787) ≈ 275.3. sqrt(275.3) ≈ 16.59.

So Re^(-1/4) ≈ 1/16.59 ≈ 0.0603.

f ≈ 0.316 * 0.0603 ≈ 0.01906.

Now, plug into D^5 = (8 f L Q²) / (π² h_f g )

Compute numerator: 8 * 0.01906 * 10,000 * (8.93)^2

8 * 0.01906 ≈ 0.1525.

(8.93)^2 ≈ 79.7449.

So numerator: 0.1525 * 10,000 * 79.7449 ≈ 0.1525 * 797,449 ≈ 121,612.

Denominator: π² * 75 * 32.2 ≈ 9.8696 * 75 *32.2.

Compute 9.8696 *75 ≈ 740.22. 740.22 *32.2 ≈ 23,831.96.

So D^5 ≈ 121,612 / 23,831.96 ≈ 5.100.

So D ≈ 5.100^(1/5).

Compute 5.100^(1/5): Let's see, 1.3^5 is 3.71, 1.4^5≈ 5.378. So 5.1 is close to 1.4^5=5.378.

So D≈1.38 ft, which is 16.56 inches, close to option F:16.6 in.

Wait, but let's check if this converges. Let's use D=1.38 ft.

Compute Re = 113680 / 1.38 ≈ 82,558.

Compute ε/D =0.00015/1.38≈0.0001087.

Now, compute f again.

Using the smooth pipe approximation: f ≈0.316*(Re)^(-1/4).

Re=82,558.

Re^(-1/4) ≈ 1/(82558^0.25).

Compute 82558^0.25: sqrt(sqrt(82558)).

sqrt(82558)=287.33. sqrt(287.33)=16.95.

So Re^(-1/4)=1/16.95≈0.05897.

f≈0.316 * 0.05897≈0.01865.

Now compute D^5:

D^5 = (8 * 0.01865 * 10,000 * 8.93^2 ) / (π² *75 *32.2 )

Compute numerator: 8 *0.01865≈0.1492.

0.1492 *10,000=1,492.

8.93^2≈79.7449.

1,492 *79.7449≈120,  1,492 * 80=119,360, minus 1,492*(0.2551)= ~380. So ≈119,360 - 380≈118,980.

Denominator: π²*75*32.2 ≈9.8696*75=740.22; 740.22*32.2≈23,832.

So D^5≈118,980 /23,832≈5.008.

So D≈5.008^(1/5)= ~1.38 ft. So it's converging to D≈1.38 ft, which is 16.56 inches, close to option F:16.6 in.

Wait, but let me check if I used the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Let me double-check.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is h_f = (f * L / D) * (v²)/(2g).

Wait, but sometimes it's written as h_f = (f * L * v²)/(2g * D). So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the Darcy factor, which includes the velocity term correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Hazen-Williams formula, but that's usually for water and has different assumptions. Since this is oil, maybe it's better to stick with Darcy-Weisbach.

Wait, another approach: Since the problem gives the head loss as 75 ft, which is the same as h_f = 75 ft.

Let me try to compute the velocity first using the flow rate and an assumed diameter, then compute Re, find f, then compute h_f and see if it matches 75 ft.

Wait, but without knowing D, that's tough. Alternatively, perhaps I can set up an equation in terms of D and solve numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for head loss in terms of flow rate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a formula that relates Q, D, h_f, etc., directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of D and solve.

But I think the iterative approach I took earlier gives D≈1.38 ft, which is approximately 16.56 inches, so option F:16.6 in.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option F is 16.6 in, which is very close to what I got.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Swamee-Jain approach, leading to a higher f, but the smooth pipe approximation gave a lower f, leading to a larger D.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact Swamee-Jain formula.

Let me try again with D=1.38 ft.

Compute Re=113680 /1.38≈82,558.

Compute ε/D=0.00015/1.38≈0.0001087.

Now, Swamee-Jain equation:

f = (-2.457 * ln( ( (ε/D)^1.11 + 0.038 * Re^(-0.22) ) ))^(-2/3)

Compute (ε/D)^1.11 = (0.0001087)^1.11.

Compute ln(0.0001087) ≈ -9.027.

Multiply by 1.11: -9.027 *1.11≈-10.02.

Exponentiate: e^(-10.02)= ~4.17e-5.

Next, compute 0.038 * Re^(-0.22).

Re=82558.

Compute ln(82558)=11.32.

Multiply by -0.22: 11.32*-0.22≈-2.49.

Exponentiate: e^(-2.49)= ~0.083.

So 0.038 *0.083≈0.003154.

Add to (ε/D)^1.11: 4.17e-5 +0.003154≈0.003196.

Take ln: ln(0.003196)= ln(3.196e-3)= ln(3.196) -3 ln(10)=1.163 -6.908≈-5.745.

Multiply by -2.457: -2.457*(-5.745)=14.06.

Now, compute f= (14.06)^(-2/3).

Compute 14.06^(1/3)= ~2.41.

Then (2.41)^2=5.808.

So f=1/5.808≈0.1722.

Wait, that's a higher f than before, but that can't be right because the pipe is very smooth.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, (ε/D)^1.11:

ε/D=0.0001087.

ln(0.0001087)= ln(1.087e-4)= ln(1.087) + ln(1e-4)=0.0845 -9.2103≈-9.1258.

Multiply by 1.11: -9.1258 *1.11≈-10.13.

e^(-10.13)= ~3.94e-5.

Next, Re=82558.

ln(82558)=11.32.

-0.22 *11.32≈-2.49.

e^(-2.49)=0.083.

0.038 *0.083≈0.003154.

Add to 3.94e-5: 0.003193.

ln(0.003193)= ln(3.193e-3)= ln(3.193) -3 ln(10)=1.1605 -6.908≈-5.7475.

Multiply by -2.457: 2.457 *5.7475≈14.07.

So f=(14.07)^(-2/3).

14.07^(1/3)= ~2.414.

(2.414)^2=5.828.

f=1/5.828≈0.1716.

Hmm, that's a higher f than the smooth pipe approximation, but perhaps for a slightly rough pipe, that's possible.

Now, plug f=0.1716 into the D equation:

D^5 = (8 * 0.1716 * 10,000 * (8.93)^2 ) / (π² *75 *32.2 )

Compute numerator:

8 * 0.1716 ≈1.3728.

1.3728 *10,000=13,728.

8.93^2≈79.7449.

13,728 *79.7449≈1,096,  13,728 *80=1,098,240; subtract 13,728*(0.2551)= ~3,503. So ≈1,098,240 -3,503≈1,094,737.

Denominator: π²=9.8696; 9.8696 *75=740.22; 740.22*32.2≈23,832.

So D^5≈1,094,737 /23,832≈45.95.

D≈45.95^(1/5).

Compute 45.95^(1/5): 2^5=32, 3^5=243. 45 is between 32 and 243, so fifth root is between 2 and 3. Let's see: 2.5^5=97.66; 2.7^5≈ 2.7*2.7=7.29; 7.29*2.7=19.683; 19.683*2.7≈53.1441; 53.1441*2.7≈143.489. So 2.7^5≈143.5. 2.5^5=97.66. 45.95 is between 2.5^5 and 2.6^5.

Compute 2.6^5: 2.6^2=6.76; 2.6^3=17.576; 2.6^4=45.6976; 2.6^5=118.8138. Hmm, 2.6^5≈118.8, which is higher than 45.95. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait: 45.95 is D^5, so D≈(45.95)^(1/5)= ~2.14 ft? That can't be right because earlier D was about 1.38 ft.

Wait, this suggests a mistake in the calculation. Earlier, when I assumed D=1.5 ft, I had D^5≈5.08, but now with f=0.1716, it's giving D^5≈45.95, which would make D≈2.14 ft, but that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me recompute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

8 * f * L * Q².

f=0.1716, L=10,000, Q=8.93.

So 8 *0.1716=1.3728.

1.3728 *10,000=13,728.

Q²=8.93^2=79.7449.

13,728 *79.7449 = ?

Let me compute 13,728 * 80 = 1,098,240.

Subtract 13,728 * (80-79.7449)=13,728 *0.2551≈3,490.

So 1,098,240 - 3,490 ≈1,094,750.

Denominator: π²=9.8696; 9.8696 *75=740.22; 740.22 *32.2= ?

Compute 740 *32=23,680; 740*0.2=148; total≈23,828.

So denominator≈23,828.

So D^5=1,094,750 /23,828≈45.94.

So D≈(45.94)^(1/5)= ~2.14 ft, which is 25.68 inches. But that's way larger than any of the options. So something's wrong here.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier when I used f=0.019, I got D≈1.38 ft, which matches the options. But when I used Swamee-Jain with f=0.1716, I get D≈2.14 ft, which is way too big. So I must have made a mistake in applying the Swamee-Jain formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should stick to the smooth pipe approximation, which gave a reasonable D≈1.38 ft, matching option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the initial equation setup again.

Wait, let me re-express the Darcy-Weisbach equation properly.

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D )

Rearranged for f:

f = (2 * g * D * h_f) / (L * v² )

Now, substituting v=4Q/(π D²), we get:

f = (2 * 32.2 * D *75 ) / (10,000 * (4*8.93/(π D²))² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*32.2*75 = 4830.

So numerator: 4830 * D.

Denominator: 10,000 * (35.72/(π D²))² → because 4*8.93=35.72.

So denominator: 10,000 * (35.72^2)/(π² D^4 )= 10,000 * 1275.9184 / (π² D^4 )

So denominator= (10,000 *1275.9184)/(π² D^4 )=12,759,184 / (9.8696 D^4 )≈1,291,000 / D^4.

So f= (4830 D) / (1,291,000 / D^4 )= (4830 D * D^4 ) /1,291,000 = (4830 D^5 ) /1,291,000.

Simplify:

4830 /1,291,000 ≈0.00374.

So f≈0.00374 D^5.

Now, using this f expression in terms of D, we can relate to Re and ε/D.

From earlier, Re= (4 Q)/(π D ν )=35.72/(π D *0.0001)=35.72/(0.00031416 D )=113,680/D.

And ε/D=0.00015/D.

Now, using the smooth pipe approximation where f≈0.316 Re^(-1/4).

So f≈0.316*(113680/D )^(-1/4 )=0.316 * D^(1/4 )*(113680)^(-1/4 ).

Compute (113680)^(1/4):

113680^(1/4)= sqrt(sqrt(113680)).

sqrt(113680)=337.18; sqrt(337.18)=18.36.

So (113680)^(-1/4)=1/18.36≈0.05446.

So f≈0.316 * D^(1/4 ) *0.05446≈0.01727 D^(1/4).

Now, from earlier, f≈0.00374 D^5.

Set them equal:

0.00374 D^5 =0.01727 D^(1/4 )

Divide both sides by D^(1/4):

0.00374 D^(19/4 )=0.01727.

So D^(19/4 )=0.01727 /0.00374≈4.614.

Now, solve for D:

D^(19/4)=4.614 → D=4.614^(4/19).

Compute 4/19≈0.2105.

So D=4.614^0.2105.

Compute ln(4.614)=1.527.

Multiply by 0.2105: 1.527*0.2105≈0.321.

Exponentiate: e^0.321≈1.378 ft.

So D≈1.378 ft, which is 16.54 inches, very close to option F:16.6 in.

So after all this, I think the correct answer is F:16.6 inches.

To calculate the diameter of the clean iron pipe, the Darcy-Weisbach equation is used to relate the head loss, flow rate, pipe length, and diameter. The equation is:

\[
h_f = \frac{f \cdot L \cdot v^2}{2g \cdot D}
\]

where:
- \( h_f = 75 \, \text{ft} \),
- \( L = 10,000 \, \text{ft} \),
- \( Q = 8.93 \, \text{cfs} \),
- \( v = \frac{4Q}{\pi D^2} \),
- \( f \) is the Darcy friction factor,
- \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \),
- \( \nu = 0.0001 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \),
- \( \epsilon = 0.00015 \, \text{ft} \).

### Step 1: Reynolds Number and Friction Factor
The Reynolds number is calculated as:
\[
\text{Re} = \frac{v \cdot D}{\nu} = \frac{\frac{4Q}{\pi D^2} \cdot D}{\nu} = \frac{4Q}{\pi D \cdot \nu}
\]
Substituting \( Q = 8.93 \, \text{cfs} \) and \( \nu = 0.0001 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \):
\[
\text{Re} = \frac{4 \cdot 8.93}{\pi D \cdot 0.0001} = \frac{113,680}{D}
\]

For a clean iron pipe, the relative roughness \( \epsilon/D = 0.00015/D \) is very small, indicating a smooth pipe. Using the smooth pipe approximation for the Darcy friction factor:
\[
f \approx 0.316 \cdot \text{Re}^{-1/4}
\]
Substituting \( \text{Re} = \frac{113,680}{D} \):
\[
f \approx 0.316 \cdot \left(\frac{113,680}{D}\right)^{-1/4}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for Diameter
Rearranging the Darcy-Weisbach equation for \( D \) and substituting \( v = \frac{4Q}{\pi D^2} \):
\[
D^5 = \frac{8 \cdot f \cdot L \cdot Q^2}{\pi^2 \cdot h_f \cdot g}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
D^5 = \frac{8 \cdot f \cdot 10,000 \cdot (8.93)^2}{\pi^2 \cdot 75 \cdot 32.2}
\]
Using \( f \approx 0.316 \cdot \left(\frac{113,680}{D}\right)^{-1/4} \), the equation is solved iteratively for \( D \). After several iterations, the diameter converges to approximately \( D \approx 1.38 \, \text{ft} \), which is \( 16.56 \, \text{inches} \).

### Final Answer:
The diameter of the pipe is closest to **16.6 inches**, corresponding to option **F**.
