Question:

Which of the following best describes a key difference between the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curve?

Options:

A: Long-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
B: Long-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.
C: Short-run aggregate supply is downward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
D: Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.
E: Long-run aggregate supply is vertical as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
F: Short-run aggregate supply is horizontal as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
G: Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
H: Short-run aggregate supply is vertical as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.
I: Long-run aggregate supply is downward sloping as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.

Okay, so I have this economics question about the aggregate supply curves. Hmm, I remember that aggregate supply can be short-run or long-run, and they have different shapes. Let me think about what I learned.

In the short run, I think the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. That's because, in the short term, firms can increase production by hiring more workers or using more materials. But why is it upward sloping? Oh right, because when the price level rises, firms can sell more at higher prices, so they produce more. But wait, why does that happen? It's because nominal wages don't adjust quickly. So if prices go up, workers' nominal wages might not change right away, so the real wage (wages divided by price level) decreases. This makes it cheaper for firms to hire workers, so they produce more. So the short-run AS curve slopes upward because of sticky wages.

Now the long run. In the long run, all factors adjust. So if prices go up, nominal wages will eventually adjust. So the real wage remains the same. Firms can't lower real wages, so they can't increase production just because the price level goes up. This means the long-run AS curve is vertical. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Or is it vertical because in the long run, the economy is at full employment, so output doesn't change with the price level. Oh right, the long-run AS is vertical because it's based on the natural rate of unemployment, so changes in the price level don't affect the quantity supplied in the long run. So the long-run curve is vertical.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see some that say upward sloping. Let me go back. The short-run AS is upward sloping because of sticky wages and prices. The long-run AS is vertical because all prices and wages adjust, so output doesn't change. So the key difference is the response of nominal wages. In the short run, they don't adjust quickly, so firms can vary production. In the long run, they do adjust, so AS becomes vertical.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: Long-run AS is upward sloping because nominal wages don't respond quickly. That's not right because in the long run, they do respond, so AS isn't upward.

Option B: Long-run AS is upward because wages respond quickly. Wait, if wages respond quickly, then in the long run, the real wage remains constant, so the quantity supplied doesn't change. So the long-run AS would be vertical, not upward. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Short-run AS is downward sloping because wages don't respond. No, short-run AS is upward sloping.

Option D: Short-run AS is upward because wages respond quickly. No, because if wages respond quickly, it's the long run.

Option E: Long-run AS is vertical because wages don't respond. That doesn't make sense because in the long run, they do respond.

Option F: Short-run is horizontal. No, it's upward sloping.

Option G: Short-run is upward because wages don't respond. Yes, that's correct. So G is a correct statement.

Option H: Short-run is vertical because wages respond quickly. No, short-run AS is upward, not vertical.

Option I: Long-run is downward sloping. No, long-run is vertical.

So the question is about the key difference. The correct difference is that in the short run, nominal wages don't adjust quickly, leading to an upward sloping AS. In the long run, they do adjust, making AS vertical.

Looking at the options, option G says that the short-run AS is upward sloping because nominal wages don't quickly respond. So that's a correct description of the short-run AS. But the question is about the key difference between the two. So the difference is that in the short run, AS is upward due to sticky wages, while in the long run, AS is vertical because wages do adjust.

Which option captures this difference? The question asks which option best describes the key difference. So perhaps the correct answer is G, which accurately describes the short-run AS, but maybe another option points to the difference.

Wait, let's look at the options again. The question is about the key difference between the two curves. So the difference is that in the short run, the AS is upward sloping because of sticky wages, while in the long run, it's vertical because wages adjust.

Looking for which option states that. Let me check each option.

Option G says short-run AS is upward because wages don't respond. So that's correct about the short run.

But the question is about the difference between the two. So perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm not entirely sure if any option directly states the difference.

Wait, let me think about each option:

The options are all statements about either short or long run AS. The question is which best describes the key difference. So the correct option should explain that in the short run, AS slopes upward due to sticky wages, and in the long run, it's vertical because wages adjust.

But the options don't pair both; each is a separate statement. So perhaps the question is asking which option correctly describes a key difference, meaning which statement is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is G, which describes the short-run AS correctly, or perhaps E, which says long-run AS is vertical because wages don't adjust. But no, in the long run, wages do adjust, so E is incorrect.

Wait, option E says long-run AS is vertical because nominal wages don't quickly respond. That's wrong because in the long run, they do respond, leading AS to be vertical.

So the correct answer must be G: Short-run AS is upward sloping because nominal wages don't quickly respond.

The key difference between the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves lies in the responsiveness of nominal wages to price level changes. In the short run, nominal wages are sticky and do not quickly adjust to price level changes, causing the aggregate supply curve to slope upward. This is because firms can increase production by hiring more workers or using more inputs when prices rise, as real wages temporarily decrease. In contrast, in the long run, nominal wages adjust fully to price level changes, leading the aggregate supply curve to become vertical, as the economy reaches full employment and output does not change with price level fluctuations.

The correct answer is **G**, as it accurately describes the short-run aggregate supply curve's upward slope due to the slow adjustment of nominal wages.

Answer: G
