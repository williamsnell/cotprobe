Question:

Singer claims that famine relief organizations direct our aid to distant refugees:

Options:

A: with a focus on quantity over quality, leading to possible misallocation.
B: very inefficiently, and are therefore not worth donating to.
C: with a high level of bureaucracy and corruption, therefore not recommended.
D: more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors.
E: extremely efficiently, making them the only viable option for aid distribution.
F: very effectively, but only in certain regions.
G: moderately efficiently, although there may be better alternatives.
H: almost as effectively as we could get it to our close neighbors.
I: effectively, but at a high operational cost.

Okay, so I have this question about famine relief organizations and where they direct our aid. The question is asking about the last part of the claim: whether they direct aid to distant refugees. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll read the question again. It says, "Singer claims that famine relief organizations direct our aid to distant refugees: " and then gives options about how they do this. So Singer is talking about where these organizations send aidâ€”distant refugees. Now, I need to think about the context. I remember that Singer, as in the philosopher Peter Singer, discusses issues related to aid distribution and often talks about the ethics of helping distant others versus those closer to us.

Wait, Singer's arguments usually focus on the idea that we have a moral obligation to help those in the greatest need, regardless of their proximity. He might argue that aid should go to where it's most needed, even if that's far away. So, in the context of famine relief, organizations might prioritize distant refugees if that's where the greatest need is, even if they are far from our own country.

Looking at the options:

A: Focus on quantity over quality, leading to misallocation. Hmm, this sounds like a possible critique, but I'm not sure if that's what Singer is saying. He might be more about the ethical obligation to help, not necessarily the efficiency or quality.

B: Very inefficiently, not worth donating. That seems negative, but I don't think Singer is saying that. He's more about the moral duty to help, regardless of efficiency.

C: High bureaucracy and corruption. Again, a negative point, but I don't recall Singer specifically pointing this out as the main issue. He might address inefficiency elsewhere, but the question is about the direction of aid.

D: More effectively than we could get it to close neighbors. That makes sense. If organizations have better infrastructure or more capacity to reach distant areas, they might distribute aid more effectively there than locally, where maybe local groups could handle it better but aren't as efficient.

E: Extremely efficiently, only viable option. That sounds too strong. I don't think Singer would say it's the only option, but maybe that they are effective.

F: Very effectively, only in certain regions. Maybe, but the question is about distant refugees in general, not specific regions.

G: Moderately efficient, with alternatives. Not sure if that's what he's saying.

H: Almost as effectively as close neighbors. This suggests similar effectiveness, but the point might be that distant aid is more effective.

I: Effectively, but high cost. Maybe, but the question is about the direction and effectiveness.

Wait, let me think again. Singer's argument is about the responsibility to aid those in greatest need, regardless of distance. So the organizations might be directing aid more effectively to distant refugees because they assess where the need is greatest. So, perhaps the idea is that these organizations can allocate aid more effectively in distant regions than locally because they have the resources and can reach areas that local organizations might not as effectively.

So, looking at option D: "more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors." That seems to fit. Singer might argue that aid organizations have the capability to distribute aid more effectively in distant regions, so they direct aid there. This would make D the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors.

**Answer: D**
