Okay, so I've got this question about a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer, and I'm trying to figure out the dimensions of the activation map after the first layer. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The input image is 32x32 with 1 color channel. The first layer uses 4 filters, each of size 5x5. The stride is 2, and there's zero-padding of width 1. I need to find the resulting activation map size, k x k, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, I remember that when you apply a convolutional filter to an image, the output dimension can be calculated using a formula. Let me recall that formula. I think it's something like: output size = (input size + 2*padding - filter size) / stride + 1. Oh wait, is that right? Because sometimes I get confused between padding and stride.

So, let's break it down. The input image is 32x32. The filter is 5x5. Stride is 2, and padding is 1. Since the padding is 1, that means we add a border of 1 pixel around the image. So the effective input size becomes (32 + 2*1) = 34 in each dimension, right? Because padding is added to both sides.

Wait, no, the padding is 1, so each side (left and right) gets 1, so total padding per dimension is 2. So the new input size for the convolution would be 32 + 2*1 = 34, but wait, actually, the formula already accounts for the padding. Let me get this straight.

The formula is: [(W - F + 2P)/S] + 1, where W is the input width, F is the filter size, P is padding, and S is the stride. Oh wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the formula is (W - F + 2P)/S + 1. Right, because you're adding padding on both sides, so W becomes W + 2P. Then the filter slides over that, and the number of steps is (W + 2P - F) divided by S, then plus 1 because you count each possible position.

So plugging in the numbers: W is 32, F is 5, P is 1, S is 2.

So, (32 + 2*1 -5) / 2 +1. Let me compute that. 32 +2 is 34. 34 -5 is 29. 29 divided by 2 is 14.5. Hmm, but since you can't have half a step, you take the floor? Or does the formula automatically account for that? Wait, in practice, when you have a stride, you can only take integer steps. So if the division isn't exact, the output dimension is the floor of (W-F+2P)/S) +1? Or wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another way: when the padding is done, the image size becomes (32 + 2*1) =34. Then, when applying a 5x5 filter with stride 2, how many steps can it take? The number of positions along one dimension is (34 -5)/2 +1. Because the filter moves in steps of 2, starting from position 0, then 2, then 4, etc., until the end. So the calculation is (34 -5) / 2 +1.

34-5 is 29. 29 divided by 2 is 14.5. But since you can't have a half step, you take the integer part. Wait, but in programming terms, when you have integer division, it's rounded down. So 29 /2 is 14 in integer division. Then add 1: 14 +1=15? Wait, no, because (34-5) is 29, and the number of steps is (29) / stride, which is 2. So 29//2 is 14, and then the number of positions is 14 +1 =15. So the output size would be 15x15.

Wait, but I'm getting 15 here. Let me check the options. Option D is 15. But wait, another way: I've heard that sometimes people use the formula: output_dim = (input_dim + 2*padding - filter_dim) // stride + 1.

So, (32 +2*1 -5) =32+2-5=29. 29 divided by stride 2 is 14.5, but since we're using integer division, it's 14, then +1 gives 15. So output is 15x15.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes people might not use the +1, but I think the formula includes it. Let me think with a small example. Suppose input is 5x5, filter is 3x3, stride 1, padding 0. Then output is (5-3+1)=3. So yes, the formula would give (5-3)/1 +1 =3. So yes, the formula is correct.

So in this problem, the output after the first layer would be 15x15, which is option D. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Let me recalculate:

W =32, F=5, P=1, S=2.

So, W + 2P =32+2=34.

Then, the number of steps along one dimension is (34 -5)/2 +1 =29/2 +1. 29 divided by 2 is 14.5, but since the filter has to fit entirely within the image, you can't have a partial step. So the number of steps is 14 full steps, but how does that translate to the number of output units?

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct as (W + 2P - F) // S +1. So (32 +2*1 -5) =34-5=29. 29//2=14, 14+1=15. So yes, 15.

So the activation map for each filter is 15x15, so k is 15. So the answer should be D.
</think>

The dimensions of the activation map after applying the first layer are calculated using the formula: 

\[
\text{output\_dim} = \frac{\text{input\_dim} + 2 \times \text{padding} - \text{filter\_size}}{\text{stride}} + 1
\]

Given the input image size of 32x32, filter size of 5x5, padding of 1, and stride of 2, the output dimension for each filter is:

\[
\text{output\_dim} = \frac{32 + 2 \times 1 - 5}{2} + 1 = \frac{29}{2} + 1 = 14.5 + 1 = 15
\]

Thus, the activation map dimensions are 15x15, making \( k = 15 \).
