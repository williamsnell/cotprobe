Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this insurance question. Barnes and Sons, Co. insured their offices with an annual premium of $130 on March 3. Then, on October 15, the carrier canceled the policy. They want to know the refund due. Hmm, I need to calculate how much of the premium they should get back because the policy was canceled before the full year was up.

First, I think I need to determine how much of the year had passed when the policy was canceled. The policy started on March 3 and was canceled on October 15. So I should count the number of months from March 3 to October 15.

Let me break it down month by month. March has 31 days, so from March 3 to March 31 is 28 days (since 31-3+1=29, but maybe I should just count the full months). Wait, maybe it's easier to count the months from March to October. So March to April is 1 month, April to May another, and so on until October.

March to April: 1 month
April to May: 2
May to June: 3
June to July:4
July to August:5
August to September:6
September to October:7

Wait, that's 7 months from March to October. But wait, the policy was active from March 3 to October 15, so that's from March to October, which is 7 months and 15 days minus the first 3 days of March. But maybe the calculation is done by the number of full months plus a partial month.

Alternatively, sometimes insurance companies prorate the premium based on the number of months the policy was in effect. So if the policy was for 12 months, and it was canceled after 7 months (March to October), then they would have paid for 7 months, so the refund would be for 5 months.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The policy started on March 3, so that's the start of the coverage period. If it's canceled on October 15, how many months have passed?

From March 3 to March 31: that's 28 days (since 31-3=28 days left in March). Then April is 30 days, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and up to October 15.

But perhaps the way to calculate this is by using the number of months from March to October. So March is the first month, April the second, up to October being the seventh month. So that's 7 months.

Wait, but the annual premium is for 12 months, so each month's cost is $130 divided by 12, which is approximately $10.8333 per month.

If the policy was in effect for 7 months, then Barnes paid for 7 months, so the refund would be for the remaining 5 months. So 5 months times $10.8333 is approximately $54.1665, which rounds to $54.17. But looking at the options, I don't see that exact amount.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact number of days from March 3 to October 15 and then find the proportion of the annual premium.

Let me count the days:

March: 31 days, so from March 3 to March 31 is 29 days (since 31-3+1=29 days? Wait, March 3 to March 31 is 29 days? Let me check: March 3 is day 1, March 4 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 29. So 29 days.

April: 30 days
May:31
June:30
July:31
August:31
September:30
October:15

So adding up the days:

March: 29
April:30 → 29+30=59
May:31 → 59+31=90
June:30 → 90+30=120
July:31 →120+31=151
August:31 →151+31=182
September:30 →182+30=212
October:15 →212+15=227 days.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the policy was active from March 3 to October 15. So the total days are from March 3 to October 15 inclusive.

Wait, but I think it's better to calculate the days from March 3 to October 15, not including the start date. So March 3 is day 0, and then each day after that counts.

So March: 31-3=28 days remaining (from March 4 to March 31)
April:30
May:31
June:30
July:31
August:31
September:30
October:15

So total days = 28 +30+31+30+31+31+30+15.

Let me add them up:

28 +30=58
+31=89
+30=119
+31=150
+31=181
+30=211
+15=226 days.

Wait, 226 days. So that's the number of days the policy was in effect.

An annual premium is for 365 days, so the proportion is 226/365.

So the amount paid by Barnes is (226/365)*130.

Let me calculate that: 226 *130 = 29,380. Then divide by 365.

29,380 ÷ 365 ≈ 80.49315. So approximately $80.49.

Wait, but that would mean Barnes paid $80.49, but the total premium is $130, so the refund would be $130 - $80.49 = $49.51.

Wait, wait, no. Because the premium is an annual charge. If the policy is canceled on October 15, the insurance company would prorate the premium based on the time the policy was in effect.

So the amount due is (days covered / 365) * annual premium. So if Barnes paid $130 on March 3, and the policy was canceled on October 15, the amount they should get back is the prorated amount for the time not covered.

Wait, but wait. When you pay an annual premium, if you cancel mid-term, you get a refund for the unused time. So the refund would be (365 - 226) days /365 * $130.

So 365 -226 = 139 days.

139/365 = approximately 0.3810.

0.3810 *130 ≈ $50.53. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are A:130, B:70, C:49.51, D:226, E:58.33, F:65, G:110.25, H:75.60, I:80.49, J:100.75.

Wait, option C is $49.51, which is close to my initial calculation. But I think I might have made a mistake in the days. Let me double-check the days calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should count the days from March 3 to October 15 inclusive. So March 3 is day 1, March 4 is day 2, ..., October 15 is day X.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's count the number of full months from March to October, which is 7 months (March is the first month, April the second, up to October as the seventh month). So 7 months out of 12.

So the prorated amount would be (7/12)*130 = $7*130/12 = $7*10.8333 ≈ $75.83. That's not matching the options either.

Wait, but perhaps the policy is canceled on October 15, so the coverage is up to October 15. So the number of months is from March to October, which is 7 months. So the amount paid is 7/12 *130 = 75.83. So the refund would be 130 -75.83 ≈ $54.17. But that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the exact days and then prorate.

Earlier, I calculated 226 days from March 3 to October 15. So 226/365 = 0.619178. So the amount paid is 0.619178 *130 ≈ $80.49. That would mean the refund is 130 -80.49 = $49.51, which is option C.

Wait, but another way: sometimes insurance policies prorate the premium on a monthly basis, not on a daily basis. So if the policy is canceled partway through a month, that month is considered a full month, but any subsequent months are not charged. So from March to October is 7 months, so the prorated amount is 7/12 *130 = $75.83. So the refund would be 130 -75.83 ≈ $54.17, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the carrier charges on a pro-rata basis but rounds to the nearest cent. Let me check 226 days: 226/365 = 0.619178. Multiply by 130: 0.619178 *130 = exactly 80.49314, which is approximately $80.49. So the refund would be 130 -80.49= $49.51, which is option C.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, if the policy is canceled mid-month, the company might charge for the full month and then prorate the remaining. So from March to October is 7 months, so 7 * (130/12) = 7*10.8333≈75.83. Then the remaining 5 months would be 5*10.8333≈54.17. So the refund would be $54.17. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is $49.51 because it's based on the exact days, leading to a refund of that amount. Looking at the options, option C is $49.51. So I think that's the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **C: $49.51**. Barnes and Sons paid an annual premium of $130 and was insured for 226 days before the policy was canceled. The refund is calculated based on the prorated portion of the premium for the remaining days of the year, resulting in a refund of $49.51.
