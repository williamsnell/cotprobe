Okay, so I need to calculate the pH of a 0.2 M NH3 solution. I remember that NH3 is a weak base, so it won't completely dissociate in water. The reaction given is NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH-. They also provided Kb as 1.8 × 10^-5. 

I think the first step is to write the expression for Kb. Kb equals [NH4+][OH-] divided by [NH3]. Since the solution is 0.2 M NH3, the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.2 M, and the concentrations of NH4+ and OH- are zero initially. 

As the reaction proceeds, some NH3 will react with water to produce NH4+ and OH-. Let's let x be the concentration of OH- produced. So, the changes would be: NH3 decreases by x, NH4+ increases by x, and OH- increases by x. 

So, the equilibrium concentrations are [NH3] = 0.2 - x, [NH4+] = x, and [OH-] = x. 

Plugging into the Kb expression:
Kb = (x)(x) / (0.2 - x) = x² / (0.2 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Now, I need to solve for x. Since Kb is small, x should be much smaller than 0.2, so maybe I can approximate 0.2 - x ≈ 0.2. Let me check that assumption later.

So, x² ≈ 1.8e-5 * 0.2 = 3.6e-6. Taking the square root of both sides, x ≈ sqrt(3.6e-6). Let me calculate that: sqrt(3.6) is about 1.897, and sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3, so x ≈ 1.897e-3 M. So [OH-] is approximately 0.001897 M.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 3.6e-6 is 0.0000036. The square root of that is sqrt(3.6) * 1e-3. Sqrt(3.6) is about 1.897, so x ≈ 0.001897 M.

Now, the pOH is the negative logarithm of [OH-]. So pOH = -log(0.001897). Let me compute that. 

I know that log(1e-3) is 3, so 0.001 is pH 3. 0.001897 is a bit higher. Let me think, log(2)=0.3010, so 0.002 would be log(2e-3)= log(2) + log(1e-3)= 0.3010 -3 = -2.6990. But I have 0.001897, which is 1.897e-3. So the log of 1.897 is about 0.278. So log(1.897e-3) is log(1.897) + log(1e-3) = 0.278 -3 = -2.722. Therefore, pOH = 2.722.

Wait, that can't be right because if [OH-] is 0.001897, then pOH is 2.722, which would make pH = 14 - 2.722 = 11.278. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 11.73, G is 11.28, so that's close to G. But wait, maybe my approximation is off because x isn't negligible compared to 0.2. Let me check the assumption.

The value of x is 0.001897, and 0.2 is 0.2 M. So 0.001897 is about 0.95% of 0.2, which is less than 5%, so the approximation is valid. So maybe the initial calculation is okay.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recalculate the pOH more accurately. The [OH-] is 1.897e-3. Let me compute log(1.897e-3) more precisely. 

I can use log(1.897) ≈ 0.278. So log(1.897e-3) = 0.278 -3 = -2.722. So pOH is 2.722, so pH is 14 - 2.722 = 11.278, which is approximately 11.28. Looking at the options, option G is 11.28. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the Kb expression? Because sometimes I might confuse Kb and Ka, but the given Kb is correct for NH3. Let me make sure: the Kb expression is correct, and I used it right.

Alternatively, maybe using a more precise calculation without the approximation would give a slightly different x. Let me try solving the equation without the approximation to see if it makes a significant difference.

The equation is x² = 1.8e-5 * (0.2 - x). So x² = 3.6e-6 - 1.8e-5 x.

Rearranging: x² + 1.8e-5 x - 3.6e-6 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=1.8e-5, c=-3.6e-6.

Discriminant D = (1.8e-5)^2 +4*(1)*3.6e-6 = 3.24e-10 + 1.44e-5 = approx 1.44e-5 + 3.24e-10 ≈ 1.44e-5 (since 3.24e-10 is negligible).

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(1.44e-5) = 0.0038.

Thus, x = [-1.8e-5 ± 0.0038]/2. Taking the positive root: ( -1.8e-5 + 0.0038 ) / 2 ≈ (0.003782) /2 ≈ 0.001891.

So x ≈ 0.001891 M, which is very close to the earlier approximation. So the approximation holds, and the pOH is about 2.722, pH≈11.28. So the answer should be G: 11.28.

To calculate the pH of a 0.2 M NH₃ solution with \( K_b = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), we start by recognizing that NH₃ is a weak base. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^-
\]

The base dissociation constant expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{NH}_4^+][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{NH}_3]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the equilibrium concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) and \(\text{NH}_4^+\). The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{NH}_3] = 0.2 - x\),
- \([\text{NH}_4^+] = x\),
- \([\text{OH}^-] = x\).

Substituting into the \( K_b \) expression:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.2 - x}
\]

Since \( K_b \) is small, we approximate \( 0.2 - x \approx 0.2 \), leading to:

\[
x^2 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.2) = 3.6 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \sqrt{3.6 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.897 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, \([\text{OH}^-] = 1.897 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\). The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.897 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.722
\]

The pH is then:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 2.722 = 11.278
\]

This value aligns closely with option G (11.28). Verifying the approximation, \( x \) is approximately 0.95% of 0.2, confirming the validity of the approximation. Therefore, the pH is:

**G: 11.28**
