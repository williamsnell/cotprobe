Question:

Rita is moving a pile of 120 rocks by hand to build a rock wall. If h represents the number of rocks that she can carry in one load, which expression represents the total number of loads needed to move the entire pile of rocks?

Options:

A: 120 −h
B: 120 +h
C: 120%h
D: h/120
E: 120h
F: h*120
G: 120/h
H: h^120
I: h-120
J: h+120

Okay, so I have this problem here where Rita is moving 120 rocks to build a wall. The question is asking which expression represents the total number of loads she needs to carry all the rocks. The options are given from A to J, and I need to figure out the right one.

Let me start by understanding the problem. Rita has a pile of 120 rocks, and she can carry a certain number of them in one load. Let's say 'h' is the number of rocks she can carry each time. The question is about the total number of trips or loads she needs to make to move all 120 rocks.

So, I think this is a division problem because she's moving rocks in batches. If she can carry 'h' rocks per load, then the total number of loads would be the total rocks divided by the number she can carry each time. That makes sense because if she can carry more rocks each time, she'll need fewer loads, and if she can carry fewer, she'll need more loads.

Let me look at the options:

A: 120 − h. That would subtract the number of rocks she can carry from the total, which doesn't seem right because it's not about how many she's left with but how many trips she needs.

B: 120 + h. Adding them together doesn't make sense here. The total number of loads shouldn't be more than the total rocks if she's carrying some each time.

C: 120%h. I'm not sure what percentage this would represent. Maybe the percentage of rocks per load, but that doesn't directly give the number of loads.

D: h/120. This is the other way around. If she can carry a fraction of a rock, which doesn't make sense because rocks are whole items. So this would give a number less than 1, which isn't possible for the number of loads.

E: 120h. Multiplying the total rocks by the number per load would give the total rocks carried, but that's not the number of loads. She's moving all 120, so this would be way too high.

F: h*120. Same as E, it's multiplication, which would be the same as 120h, so that's not right.

G: 120/h. Oh, wait, this is the division I was thinking of. If h is the number per load, then dividing the total by h gives the number of loads. For example, if h is 10, 120/10 is 12 loads. That sounds correct.

H: h^120. That's exponentiation, which would be a huge number, way too big and not relevant here.

I: h - 120. Subtracting the total rocks from her capacity per load. If h is less than 120, this would give a negative number, which doesn't make sense for loads.

J: h + 120. Again, adding them wouldn't give the number of trips needed.

So, putting it all together, the correct expression should be 120 divided by h, which is option G. That makes sense because each load is h rocks, so you divide the total by how much she can carry each time.

The correct expression is 120 divided by h, which is option G.

Answer: G
