Okay, so I have this economics question about externalities and market failure. Hmm, I remember that externalities are when the production or consumption of a good affects third parties. Positive externalities are when those effects are beneficial. So the question is asking why a positive externality leads to a market failure.

Wait, market failure occurs when the market doesn't allocate resources efficiently. In the case of positive externalities, the private costs or benefits don't account for the external benefits. So, when a good has a positive externality, consumers might not pay the full social cost because they only consider their private costs. Or wait, noâ€”externality is about the benefits to others. So if producing a good has a positive externality, like education or vaccination, the social benefit is higher than the private benefit.

In a free market, firms and consumers look at their private costs and benefits. If a good has a positive externality, the private benefit is less than the social benefit because others also gain. So the market might produce too little of the good because the private sector doesn't account for the extra benefits. That's similar to public goods, but positive externalities are not necessarily non-excludable or non-rival.

So the problem is that at the market quantity, the private decision leads to underproduction. Because without considering the externality, the private marginal benefit is less than the marginal social benefit. Therefore, the market equilibrium has a quantity lower than the socially optimal level.

Looking at the options:

A: Society produces too little. That seems correct because with positive externalities, the private sector underproduces.

B: Social benefits exceed private benefits. That's a general statement, but the question is about the market quantity causing failure.

C: Marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost. That would be the case if the good is underproduced because the benefit is higher than the cost. But wait, in the market, do they compare private costs and benefits?

D: Marginal private benefit exceeds marginal social cost. Wait, no, because in the presence of a positive externality, the social benefit is higher. So the market might produce where private MB equals private MC, but the social MB is higher.

E: Marginal social cost exceeds marginal social benefit. That sounds like the opposite situation, maybe for negative externalities. Like pollution, where the social cost is higher.

F: Private costs exceed social costs. Not sure, but positive externalities are about benefits, not costs. So probably not.

G: Private benefits exceed social benefits when producing. Wait, no, positive externalities mean that the social benefit is higher than the private benefit. So the opposite of G.

H: Private benefits from consuming exceed social benefits. Wait, if the externality is positive, the social benefits are higher. So when a consumer buys the good, their private benefit is less than the total social benefit because others also gain.

I: Marginal private cost exceeds marginal social benefit. That might be for negative externalities, where the cost is higher.

J: Society produces too much. That's more in the case of negative externalities, like pollution, where the market overproduces because firms don't account for the social costs.

So the correct answer should be A: society produces too little of the good because the private sector underproduces when there's a positive externality. The market equilibrium is at a lower quantity than the socially optimal level because the private marginal benefit doesn't account for the additional social benefits.

The correct answer is A: society produces too little of the good. This occurs because the market fails to account for the positive externality, leading to underproduction compared to the socially optimal level.

Answer: A
