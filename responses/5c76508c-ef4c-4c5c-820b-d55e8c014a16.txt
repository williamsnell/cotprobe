Okay, so I have this question about depreciation, and I need to find the book value of a machine after three years. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The company bought a machine for $1200. The depreciation method used is 20% of the declining balance. Hmm, I remember that declining balance is also called reducing balance, where each year's depreciation is calculated on the remaining book value from the previous year.

So, the formula for declining balance depreciation is: Depreciation = Book Value at the start of the year × Depreciation Rate. And the book value each year is the previous year's book value minus the depreciation for that year.

Let's break it down year by year.

Starting with Year 1:
- Initial Cost: $1200
- Depreciation Rate: 20% or 0.20
- Depreciation for Year 1: 1200 × 0.20 = $240
- So, Book Value at end of Year 1: 1200 - 240 = $960

Year 2:
- Starting Book Value: $960
- Depreciation: 960 × 0.20 = $192
- Book Value after Year 2: 960 - 192 = $768

Year 3:
- Starting Book Value: $768
- Depreciation: 768 × 0.20 = $153.60
- Book Value after Year 3: 768 - 153.60 = $614.40

Wait, let me double-check that. So each year, I'm taking 20% off the current book value.

Year 1: 1200 * 0.20 = 240, so 1200 -240=960. That's correct.

Year 2: 960 *0.20=192, so 960-192=768. Yep.

Year 3: 768 *0.20=153.60, subtract that from 768 gives 614.40.

Looking at the options, option I is $614.40. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I should make sure I'm using the right method. Declining balance can sometimes refer to double-declining, but I think in this case, it's a straight 20% each year on the book value, not double the rate. So yes, 20% each year on the declining balance.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula where each year's book value is multiplied by (1 - rate). So for each year, it's multiplied by 0.80.

So, another way to think about it: after each year, the book value is 80% of the previous year's value.

So after 3 years, it's 1200 * (0.8)^3.

Calculating that: 0.8^3 is 0.512. 1200 * 0.512 = 614.40.

Yep, same result. So that's correct. So the book value after 3 years is $614.40, which is option I.

The book value after each year is calculated by applying 20% depreciation on the declining balance. After three years, the book value is $614.40.

Answer: I
