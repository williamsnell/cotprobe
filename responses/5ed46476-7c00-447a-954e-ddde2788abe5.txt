Okay, so I've got this question about compound interest, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking for the effective rate when it's 3% compounded monthly. Hmm, I remember that effective rate is like the actual interest you pay or earn in a year, considering the compounding periods. 

Wait, the formula for effective annual rate (EAR) is something like (1 + periodic rate) raised to the number of periods minus one. So the periodic rate here would be the monthly rate, which is 3% divided by 12 months. Let me do that calculation first. 

3% as a decimal is 0.03. Divided by 12 months, that's 0.03 / 12. Let me compute that: 0.03 divided by 12 is 0.0025. So each month, the interest rate is 0.25%. 

Now, the formula for EAR is (1 + 0.0025) raised to the 12th power, minus 1. So that would be (1.0025)^12 - 1. I need to calculate that. 

I'm a bit rusty on exponentials, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, I might remember that (1 + r/n)^n approaches e^r as n approaches infinity, but since n here is 12, not super large, so maybe it's a bit less than e^0.03. But wait, e^0.03 is approximately 1.03045, so e^0.03 - 1 is about 0.03045, which is around 3.045%. 

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's calculate (1.0025)^12 step by step. 

1.0025 squared is about 1.00500625. Then, to the third power: multiply by 1.0025 again, so 1.00500625 * 1.0025 ≈ 1.007531. Hmm, maybe I should use a better method. Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest more accurately. 

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 

First, ln(1.0025) is approximately 0.002498756. Multiply that by 12: 0.002498756 * 12 ≈ 0.029985. Then, take the exponent of that: e^0.029985 ≈ 1.03045. So, subtracting 1 gives 0.03045, which is approximately 3.045%. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.0304, which is 3.04%, very close to my calculation of 3.045%. Option E is 0.031, which is 3.1%, a bit higher, but my calculation is closer to 3.045%. So the effective rate should be around 3.04%, so option B. 

Wait, maybe I should check the exact value without approximations. Let me compute (1.0025)^12 exactly. 

Alternatively, using binomial expansion or a step-by-step multiplication:

(1.0025)^12 = ?

Let me compute it step by step:

1. After 1 month: 1.0025
2. After 2 months: 1.0025 * 1.0025 = 1.00500625
3. After 3 months: 1.00500625 * 1.0025 ≈ 1.007531
4. After 4: 1.007531 * 1.0025 ≈ 1.010064
Wait, this is getting tedious, but maybe I can do a few more steps.

Alternatively, I can use the formula: (1 + 0.03/12)^12 -1. Let me compute 0.03/12 = 0.0025. So (1.0025)^12.

Using a calculator, 1.0025 to the power of 12: 

I know that (1.0025)^12 is approximately 1.03045, so subtracting 1 gives 0.03045, which is 3.045%. The options don't have 0.03045, but B is 0.0304 (3.04%) and E is 0.031 (3.1%). Since 3.045 is closer to 3.04 than 3.1, the correct answer should be B: 0.0304.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because when I compute (1.0025)^12 more accurately, perhaps it's higher. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe using a logarithm approach: the natural log of 1.0025 is approximately 0.002498756. Multiplying by 12 gives 0.029985. e^0.029985 is approximately 1.03045, so yeah, 3.045%. So the effective rate is approximately 3.045%, which would round to 3.04% if we take two decimal places, but the options have it as 0.0304, which is 3.04%. 

Looking at the options again, option B is 0.0304, which matches. So the correct answer should be B.

The effective annual rate for 3% compounded monthly is calculated using the formula (1 + 0.03/12)^12 - 1, which approximates to 0.0304 or 3.04%.
