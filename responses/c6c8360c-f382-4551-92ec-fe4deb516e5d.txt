Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the derivative f'(1) for the equation x²y² - 3y + 2x³ = 0, treating y as a function of x, f(x). The question is asking for the derivative at the point (1,1) and also at the point (1,2). The answer should be a list of two numbers, and there are several options to choose from.

Hmm, let's start by recalling how to find the derivative of an implicitly defined function. I remember that when you have an equation involving both x and y, and y is defined implicitly as a function of x, you can use implicit differentiation. That means taking the derivative of both sides with respect to x, then solving for dy/dx, which in this case would be f'(x).

The given equation is x²y² - 3y + 2x³ = 0. Okay, so I'll need to differentiate each term with respect to x.

Let me write down the equation again:

x²y² - 3y + 2x³ = 0.

Taking the derivative term by term. 

First term: d/dx [x²y²]. This is a product of two functions: x² and y². So I'll need to use the product rule here. The product rule states that d/dx [u*v] = u'v + uv'. Here, u = x², so u' = 2x. And v = y², so v' would be 2y*(dy/dx) because y is a function of x. So putting it together, the derivative of the first term is 2x*y² + x²*2y*dy/dx.

Wait, let me make sure: d/dx (x²) = 2x, and d/dx (y²) = 2y dy/dx. So yes, product rule gives 2x y² + x² * 2y dy/dx.

Second term: d/dx [-3y]. The derivative of this is -3 dy/dx.

Third term: d/dx [2x³] = 6x².

So putting all the derivatives together:

2x y² + 2x² y dy/dx - 3 dy/dx + 6x² = 0.

Now, I need to collect the terms involving dy/dx. Let's see:

The terms with dy/dx are 2x² y dy/dx and -3 dy/dx. So factoring dy/dx out:

dy/dx (2x² y - 3) + other terms = 0.

The other terms are 2x y² + 6x². So:

dy/dx (2x² y - 3) = - (2x y² + 6x²).

Therefore, dy/dx = -(2x y² + 6x²) / (2x² y - 3).

Wait, no, the equation after differentiation is:

2x y² + 2x² y dy/dx - 3 dy/dx + 6x² = 0.

So moving the non-dy/dx terms to the other side:

2x² y dy/dx - 3 dy/dx = -2x y² -6x².

Factor dy/dx from the left side:

dy/dx (2x² y -3) = -2x y² -6x².

Thus, dy/dx = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / (2x² y -3).

I can factor out a -2x from the numerator:

= -2x(y² + 3x) / (2x² y -3).

Wait, let me check the numerator:

-2x y² -6x² = -2x(y² + 3x). Yes, that's correct.

So, dy/dx = [ -2x(y² + 3x) ] / (2x² y -3).

Alternatively, I can factor a 2 from the denominator:

= [ -2x(y² + 3x) ] / [ 2(x² y - 3/2) ) ].

Wait, but maybe it's better to leave it as is for now.

So, the formula for dy/dx is:

dy/dx = [ -2x(y² + 3x) ] / (2x² y -3).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

I can factor a 2 from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -2x(y² +3x)
Denominator: 2(x² y - 3/2)

So, the 2's cancel out, leaving:

dy/dx = [ -x(y² + 3x) ] / (x² y - 3/2).

But perhaps it's better to just keep it as:

dy/dx = [ -2x(y² + 3x) ] / (2x² y -3).

Now, I need to evaluate this derivative at two points: (1,1) and (1,2). That is, when x=1, y=1 for the first point, and x=1, y=2 for the second.

Let me compute f'(1) for each case.

First, point (1,1):

x=1, y=1.

Plug into the derivative:

dy/dx = [ -2*(1)*( (1)^2 + 3*(1) ) ] / (2*(1)^2*(1) -3 )

Compute numerator:

-2*1*(1 +3) = -2*(4) = -8.

Denominator:

2*1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.

So dy/dx = (-8)/(-1) = 8.

Wait, but wait, that's 8. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 8 as the first element. Wait, the options are A: [12, -18], B: [9, -13], etc. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the differentiation. Let me go back to the differentiation step.

Original equation: x² y² -3y +2x³=0.

Differentiating term by term:

d/dx(x² y²) = 2x y² + x² * 2y dy/dx.

d/dx(-3y) = -3 dy/dx.

d/dx(2x³) =6x².

So putting it together:

2x y² + 2x² y dy/dx -3 dy/dx +6x² =0.

Now, group the dy/dx terms:

(2x² y -3) dy/dx + (2x y² +6x² ) =0.

So, moving the other terms to the right:

(2x² y -3) dy/dx = - (2x y² +6x²).

Thus, dy/dx = [ - (2x y² +6x²) ] / (2x² y -3).

Which is the same as:

dy/dx = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / (2x² y -3).

So, at point (1,1):

Numerator: -2(1)(1)^2 -6(1)^2 = -2(1) -6(1) = -2 -6 = -8.

Denominator: 2(1)^2(1) -3= 2(1) -3= 2-3= -1.

So dy/dx = (-8)/(-1) = 8.

Hmm, so for (1,1), f'(1)=8.

Now, moving to the second point, (1,2):

x=1, y=2.

Numerator: -2(1)(2)^2 -6(1)^2 = -2(4) -6(1) = -8 -6 = -14.

Denominator: 2(1)^2*(2) -3= 2*(1)*2 -3= 4-3=1.

So dy/dx= (-14)/(1) = -14.

Wait, so the derivative at (1,2) is -14.

So the list would be [8, -14]. Looking at the options, option D is [8, -14], so the answer should be D.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, for the second point:

y=2, x=1.

Numerator: -2x y² -6x² = -2*1*(4) -6*(1) = -8 -6 = -14.

Denominator: 2x² y -3 = 2*(1)^2*(2) -3=4-3=1.

So yes, dy/dx is -14/1 = -14.

So the derivatives at the two points are 8 and -14, so the list is [8, -14], which is option D.
</think>

The derivative f'(1) at the points (1,1) and (1,2) is calculated using implicit differentiation. After differentiating the given equation and solving for dy/dx, we evaluate at each point. At (1,1), f'(1) is 8, and at (1,2), f'(1) is -14. Thus, the answer is [8, -14].

Answer: D
