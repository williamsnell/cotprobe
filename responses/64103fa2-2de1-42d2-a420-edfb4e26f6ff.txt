Okay, so I have this question about essential amino acids, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about amino acids. 

First, I remember that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 standard amino acids, and some of them are essential, meaning the body can't make them on its own and must get them from the diet. The essential amino acids are: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Wait, I think that's nine of them. I might be missing one, but let's go with that for now.

The question lists several options, each with three amino acids, and asks which are all essential. So each option must have three essential amino acids for it to be the correct answer.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: leucine, methionine, threonine. Leucine is definitely essential. Methionine is also essential, and threonine is another one. So all three here are essential. That makes A a possible correct answer.

Option B: leucine, cysteine, glycine. Leucine is essential, but cysteine and glycine are not. Cysteine is non-essential because the body can make it from methionine. Glycine is also non-essential as it's synthesized from other sources. So B is out.

Option C: proline, tyrosine, serine. Proline is non-essential, as the body can synthesize it. Tyrosine is also non-essential because the body can make it from phenylalanine. Serine is not essential either. So C is incorrect.

Option D: valine, glycine, arginine. Valine is essential, but glycine and arginine are not. So D is wrong.

Option E: methionine, serine, tyrosine. Methionine is essential, but serine and tyrosine are not. So E is incorrect.

Option F: isoleucine, alanine, glycine. Isoleucine is essential, but alanine and glycine are not. So F is out.

Option G: lysine, tyrosine, cysteine. Lysine is essential, but tyrosine is non-essential (since it's derived from phenylalanine), and cysteine is also non-essential. So G is wrong.

Option H: aspartate, valine, threonine. Aspartate is non-essential, but valine and threonine are essential. However, since one is non-essential, the whole option isn't correct.

Option I: lysine, proline, arginine. Lysine is essential, but proline and arginine are not. So I is incorrect.

So, going back, the only option where all three amino acids are essential is option A: leucine, methionine, and threonine. All three are definitely essential. I think that's the right answer.

The correct answer is A: leucine, methionine, and threonine, as all three are essential amino acids.
