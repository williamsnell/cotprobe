Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
What traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?

Options:

A: That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies
B: That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation
C: That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts
D: That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this history question. The passage is about gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China. Let me read through it again carefully.

The passage says that in Western Europe during the 1200s to 1400s, early cannons were heavy and slow but effective in sieges. Governments found them useful enough to fund them and improve them over time, making them more powerful and mobile.

On the other hand, China after the mid-1300s faced mainly mobile steppe nomads. Early gunpowder weapons were too unwieldy for that kind of warfare. So instead, China focused on improving their horse archer units, which were effective against these mobile enemies.

Now the question asks what traditional view of world history this passage challenges. The options are A to D, each suggesting a different traditional view.

Let me think about each option:

A: China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies. Hmm, but the passage doesn't say China wasn't good at tech. It just explains their military focus was different because of their enemies. So maybe this isn't the view being challenged.

B: China's rigid dictatorial rule suppressed military or tech innovation. The passage doesn't talk about governance or suppression. It's more about military strategy based on enemies. So this might not be it.

C: China was hindered by religious fundamentalism in modernizing. The passage doesn't mention religion at all, so probably not C.

D: China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to tech change. Wait, the passage says Europe adopted and improved gunpowder because it fit their warfare needs, while China focused on other tactics. So maybe the traditional view is that China ignored tech, but the passage shows they didn't; they chose different military paths. So D could be the view being challenged.

Wait, the traditional view might have been that Europe advanced because China didn't adopt tech. But the passage shows China was practical, adapting based on their military needs. So the traditional view that China was slow to adopt tech because they ignored it is being challenged. So D says that China was surpassed because they turned a blind eye to tech benefits. The passage suggests they weren't blind; they chose what was effective.

Alternatively, looking at the options again, the passage might challenge the notion that China lagged in tech because of some inherent reason, like option A or D. Since the passage is about military strategy, not general tech, the traditional view being challenged is likely that China didn't take advantage of gunpowder because they were technologically stagnant. So D is about being surpassed because of ignoring tech, which the passage contradicts because China was adapting to their specific needs.

So the answer should be D.

The passage challenges the traditional view that China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of technological change. Instead, it suggests that China strategically focused on improving horse archer units due to their specific military needs, rather than ignoring technological advancements entirely.

Answer: D
