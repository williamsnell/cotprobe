Question:

At 10:00p. m. onNovember 14, a driver was operating his automobile along Main Street. As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water. Within a short time, the driver, unable to escape, drowned in his car, which rapidly filled with water. In a wrongful death action by the driver's estate against the municipal water department, the estate will most probably

Options:

A: not prevail, because the municipal water department would not be liable for the negligence of its independent contractor.
B: not prevail, because the driver was negligent for driving onto the sidewalk.
C: prevail, as the municipal water department is responsible for the safe operation of its contractors.
D: prevail, because the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly.
E: not prevail, as the municipal water department had no control over the actions of the driver or the other motorist.
F: not prevail, because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.
G: prevail, because the construction company failed to adequately warn the public of the hazard.
H: not prevail, because the accident was caused by the actions of another motorist, not the municipal water department.
I: prevail, because sovereign immunity would not attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature.
J: prevail, because the municipal water department failed to ensure that the construction company had put adequate safety measures in place.

Okay, so I have this tort law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it.

The scenario is about a driver who was operating his car at night. He was approaching an intersection when another motorist ran a red light, forcing him to swerve onto the sidewalk. There was a deep hole in the sidewalk dug by a construction company that was repairing a water main break. The construction company had put up a warning sign but no barriers. The car fell into the hole, ruptured the water main, and the driver drowned.

The question is about a wrongful death action by the driver's estate against the municipal water department. So, the estate is suing the city's water department. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I should recall the legal principles involved here. This seems like a negligence case. The key issues would be whether the municipal water department is liable for the driver's death, probably through the actions of their contractor, the construction company.

Negligence requires proving that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, causing injury, and damages resulted. Here, the construction company was doing work for the city. So, the question is about the city's liability for the contractor's actions.

I remember that in such cases, the "independent contractor" rule applies. A general rule is that a property owner isn't liable for the negligence of an independent contractor unless the owner has retained control over the work or if the work is of a type that's considered non-delegable, like certain dangerous activities.

But wait, the city contracted with the construction company. If the city didn't exercise control over the contractor's work, then the city might not be liable for the contractor's negligence. However, there are exceptions. If the contractor was performing a governmental function, maybe the city would have sovereign immunity, which is a type of immunity from suit for certain governmental actions.

Sovereign immunity typically applies to the government when performing governmental functions, like public policy-making, as opposed to proprietary functions, which are more commercial or operational. If the city was performing a proprietary function, sovereign immunity might not apply, making them liable.

In this case, the water department hired a construction company to repair a water main. That seems like a proprietary function because it's related to providing water services to the public, which is more of a business-like activity rather than a governmental policy function.

So, the city might not have sovereign immunity here because the activity is proprietary. That would mean the city could be held liable if they were negligent in their supervision or if they had a duty to ensure the contractor's work was done safely.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says the estate won't prevail because the city isn't liable for the contractor's negligence. But if the city had a duty to ensure the work was done safely, even with an independent contractor, then A might not be correct.

Option J says the estate will prevail because the city failed to ensure the contractor had adequate safety measures. This seems plausible if the city had a duty to oversee the contractorâ€™s safety practices.

Option I mentions sovereign immunity not applying to non-delegable duties. If the duty is non-delegable, the city can't transfer liability to the contractor. So, if the city had a non-delegable duty, they could be liable. But I'm not sure if repairing a water main is considered a non-delegable duty.

Option F says the estate won't prevail because sovereign immunity applies to governmental functions. But if the function is proprietary, then F might not apply.

So, putting it together: the city is responsible for the work done by their contractor if they had a duty to ensure safety. Since the construction company didn't put up barriers, just a sign, maybe that's insufficient. The city might have a duty to make sure the contractor's work doesn't create an unreasonable risk to the public.

Therefore, the estate might prevail because the city didn't ensure the contractor took adequate safety measures. So, the correct answer would be J or I.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. If the city had a non-delegable duty, then I would be correct. But is that the case here? Non-delegable duties usually involve situations where the employer can't shift liability because of the nature of the work, like if it's inherently dangerous and the employer has to ensure safety.

Alternatively, if the city had a duty to inspect or ensure that the contractor's work was done safely, then their failure to do so could make them liable.

So, if the city didn't have control but had a duty to take steps to prevent such hazards, then their failure would be negligence.

In this case, the construction company didn't put up barriers, just a sign. Maybe that's inadequate. So, if the city should have ensured that proper safety measures were in place, then the city could be liable.

Therefore, the answer might be J: the estate will prevail because the city failed to ensure the contractor had adequate safety measures.

Alternatively, if the city had sovereign immunity, then the answer would be F. But since the function is proprietary, sovereign immunity doesn't apply, so F is not correct.

Another angle: the accident was caused by another motorist running a red light. So, the driver's death was a result of the other motorist's negligence and the hole. But the estate is suing the city, not the other driver. So, the city's liability would be based on their own negligence, not the other motorist's.

But the city's negligence would be in allowing the hole with inadequate barriers, causing the accident.

So, the city's responsibility is about the construction work and the safety measures.

Therefore, the correct answer is J.

The estate will most probably prevail because the municipal water department failed to ensure that the construction company had put adequate safety measures in place, such as barriers, to protect against such hazards. The city, as the employer, had a duty to ensure the work was performed safely, even though the construction company was an independent contractor. Since the city did not fulfill this duty, it can be held liable for the resulting harm.

Answer: J
