Okay, so I've got this question about warranties, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it again. The question says that a buyer purchases an item from a merchant, and the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The question is asking which warranty can the buyer invoke, assuming there are no other warranties in place.

Hmm, I remember that when you buy something, there are different types of warranties that might apply. I think some of these are implied by law, while others are express, meaning they're explicitly stated, maybe in the contract or on the product.

So the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe. That sounds like it's not doing what it's supposed to do and could even be dangerous. I think about the warranties that cover whether a product is suitable for its intended use.

I remember something about the warranty of merchantability. I think that's an implied warranty that the product is fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. So if the product is defective and not fit, that would fall under merchantability. But wait, the question also mentions unsafe, which is a bit more about safety. Is there a specific warranty for safety?

Looking at the options, I see option C is Warranty of merchantability and I is Warranty of safety. I'm a bit confused. Does the warranty of merchantability cover safety as well? Or is safety a separate warranty?

Wait, I think merchantability includes being safe to use as intended. So if the product is defective and unsafe, the warranty of merchantability would apply. Also, I think the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) deals with this. Under UCC, a seller generally warrants that goods are merchantable, meaning they're fit for their ordinary purposes.

Then there's the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, which is a bit different. That's when the seller knows a particular use the buyer has in mind and the goods are suited for that. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify that the buyer had a particular purpose beyond the ordinary use. So maybe it's more about merchantability.

So the buyer can invoke the implied warranty of merchantability because the product is defective and not fit for its ordinary use. That would make option C the correct answer.

The correct answer is C: Warranty of merchantability. This warranty covers whether the product is fit for its ordinary purposes, which aligns with the situation where the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe.
