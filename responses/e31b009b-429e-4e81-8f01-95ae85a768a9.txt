H: (2,450, 4,050)
I: (2,800, 3,700)
J: (2,900, 3,600)

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure out the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days for a large department store. The number of customers is normally distributed with a mean of 3,250 and a standard deviation of 320. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with a normal distribution, the middle 50% corresponds to the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR covers the middle 50% of the data, from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile. So, I need to find the values that mark these two percentiles.

To find these percentiles, I'll probably need to use the z-score formula. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is. The formula is z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

But wait, I think I should find the z-scores corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles first. I remember that for the standard normal distribution, the 25th percentile is at a z-score of about -0.6745, and the 75th percentile is at +0.6745. These values are because the middle 50% is between these two z-scores.

So now, I can use these z-scores to find the corresponding X values. Let's start with the lower bound (25th percentile). Using the formula:

X_lower = μ + z_lower * σ
X_lower = 3250 + (-0.6745) * 320

Let me calculate that: 3250 minus 0.6745 times 320. 0.6745 * 320 = let's see, 0.6745 * 300 is 202.35, and 0.6745 *20 is 13.49, so total around 215.84. So 3250 - 215.84 = 3034.16. So approximately 3034.

Now for the upper bound (75th percentile):

X_upper = μ + z_upper * σ
X_upper = 3250 + 0.6745 * 320

Calculating that: 0.6745 *320 is the same as before, 215.84. So 3250 + 215.84 = 3465.84, which is approximately 3466.

So the range should be from 3034 to 3466. Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options, option B is (3034, 3466), which matches my calculations. Option A is (3100, 3400), which seems a bit off because 3100 is higher than my lower bound. Option C is (3000, 3500), which is wider than the IQR. Option D is (3200, 3300), which is much narrower. Options E through J have ranges that are either too wide or not in the correct middle 50% area.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let me recalculate the z-scores. Oh yeah, 25th percentile is about -0.6745 and 75th is +0.6745. Multiplying by 320:

Lower: 3250 - 0.6745*320 = 3250 - 215.84 = 3034.16
Upper: 3250 + 0.6745*320 = 3250 + 215.84 = 3465.84

Yes, that's correct. So option B is the right answer.

The range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is from approximately 3,034 to 3,466, corresponding to option B.

Answer: B
