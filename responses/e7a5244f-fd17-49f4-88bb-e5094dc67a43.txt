Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating sea water with silver nitrate to find chlorinity and salinity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a 25.00 ml sample of sea water is titrated with 2.50 M AgNO3. They used K2CrO4 as the indicator, and the endpoint is when excess Ag+ causes the reddish color of Ag2CrO4. They used 53.50 ml of AgNO3. The density of the sea water is 1.028 g/cc. I need to find the chlorinity and salinity.

Wait, chlorinity is the measure of chloride ions, right? And salinity is the total dissolved solids, usually calculated as a percentage based on the chloride content. Oh right, I think the formula for salinity is chlorinity multiplied by a factor. Maybe 1.806 or something like that? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll look it up in my notes later.

First, I need to find the moles of AgNO3 used. The volume is 53.50 ml, which is 0.0535 L. Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = Molarity × Volume = 2.50 M × 0.0535 L. Let me calculate that: 2.50 * 0.0535 = 0.13375 moles of AgNO3.

Wait, but in the reaction, AgNO3 reacts with chloride ions. The reaction is Ag+ + Cl- → AgCl(s). So the moles of Ag+ used should equal the moles of Cl- in the sea water sample. So moles of Cl- is 0.13375 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Because the indicator is K2CrO4, which means the titration goes until the excess Ag+ reacts with CrO4^2- to form Ag2CrO4. So the stoichiometry might be a bit different. Let me think: the reaction for the endpoint is 2Ag+ + CrO4^2- → Ag2CrO4(s). So each mole of CrO4^2- reacts with 2 moles of Ag+. But wait, in this case, the K2CrO4 is just an indicator, so it's present in very small amounts and doesn't affect the stoichiometry of the main reaction. So the main reaction is still Ag+ + Cl- → AgCl. So the moles of Ag+ used equals the moles of Cl- in the sea water.

So moles of Cl- = 0.13375 moles. Now, the sample volume is 25.00 ml, which is 0.025 L. The density is 1.028 g/cc, so the mass of the sea water is volume × density. Wait, volume is in ml, which is cm³, so 25.00 ml × 1.028 g/ml = 25.7 g. So mass of solution is 25.7 grams.

Chlorinity is the percentage of chloride by mass. So chlorinity = (mass of Cl- / mass of solution) × 100%. The molar mass of Cl is about 35.45 g/mol. So mass of Cl- is moles × molar mass = 0.13375 mol × 35.45 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.13375 ×35.45 ≈ 4.746 g.

So chlorinity = (4.746 g /25.7 g) ×100% ≈ (0.1845) ×100 ≈ 18.45%, which rounds to about 18.5%. Looking at the options, option F has chlorinity 18% and salinity 32.52%. Option J has 20% and 35.52%, which is a bit higher. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, let me double-check the moles of AgNO3. Volume is 53.50 ml, which is 0.0535 L. 2.50 M × 0.0535 L = indeed 0.13375 moles. So that's correct. So the Cl- is 0.13375 moles, leading to 4.746 g Cl-.

So 4.746 /25.7 = 0.1845 → 18.45%, so approximately 18.5%. But the options don't have 18.5, the closest is F: 18% and G:17%. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate more precisely.

Wait, let me calculate 0.13375 ×35.45 exactly. 0.13375 *35.45: 0.13375 *35 = 4.68125, 0.13375 *0.45=0.0601875. Adding together, 4.68125 +0.0601875=4.7414375 g.

Mass of solution: 25.00 ml ×1.028 g/ml = 25.00 *1.028 =25.7 g.

So chlorinity is (4.7414375 /25.7) *100 = let's compute that. 4.7414375 ÷25.7 ≈ 0.1845 → 18.45%.

So about 18.45%, which is approximately 18.5%. The options have F as 18% and J as 20%. Hmm, maybe the options are rounded. Let's see what the options are.

Looking at the options, F is Chlorinity 18%, Salinity 32.52%. J is 20%, 35.52%.

Wait, but maybe salinity is calculated differently. Salinity is the total dissolved solids, which is often calculated as 1.806 times the chlorinity because, I think, the average ratio of total solids to chloride is around 1.806:1. So, if chlorinity is 18.45%, salinity would be 18.45 ×1.806 ≈ let's compute that.

18.45 ×1.806: 18 ×1.806 =32.508, 0.45 ×1.806≈0.8127. Total ≈33.3207, which is about 33.32%.

Wait, but looking at the options, F has salinity 32.52%, which is close. Let me check exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be precise with the numbers.

Salinity (S) is calculated as S = 1.806 × (chloride concentration in g/kg). Wait, but in this case, the sample is 25.7 grams of solution, which is 0.0257 kg. Chloride is 4.7414375 grams. So chloride in g/kg is 4.7414375 /0.0257 ≈184.5 g/kg, which is 18.45%.

Then salinity S = 1.806 × (chloride in g/kg) / (1000) ×100? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is S = (chloride concentration in g/kg) × 1.806. So chloride is 4.7414375 g in 25.7 g solution, which is 4.7414375 /25.7 = 0.1845 g/g, which is 184.5 g/kg. So S = 184.5 ×1.806 = let me compute that.

184.5 ×1.806: 180 ×1.806=325.08, 4.5 ×1.806≈8.127. Total ≈333.207, so 33.3207% salinity.

Looking at the options, F is 32.52%, which is close. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, another thought: maybe the calculation is done using the mass of the solution and the moles of Cl- correctly, but perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the equivalents.

Wait, alternative approach: The formula for chlorinity is (Cl-/mass of solution) ×100. Salinity is (chloride ×1.806) as a percentage.

Wait, but sometimes, the formula is S = (Cl-) ×1.806 / (mass of solution) ×100. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S = (Cl- in grams) × (1.806) / (mass of solution) ×100.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is:

Chlorinity (C) = (mass of Cl- / mass of solution) ×100%.

Salinity (S) = C ×1.806.

So if C is 18.45%, then S is 18.45 ×1.806 ≈33.32%.

Looking at the options, none have exactly 33.32%. The closest is option F: 18% chlorinity and 32.52% salinity.

Wait, but maybe I need to compute more accurately. Let me do that.

First, moles of AgNO3: 2.50 M × 0.0535 L = 0.13375 moles. So Cl- is 0.13375 moles.

Mass of Cl-: 0.13375 ×35.45 = let's compute this exactly.

0.13375 ×35 = 4.68125, 0.13375 ×0.45 = 0.0601875. Total is 4.68125 +0.0601875 =4.7414375 grams.

Mass of solution: 25.00 ml ×1.028 g/ml =25.7 grams.

Chlorinity: (4.7414375 /25.7) ×100 = (0.1845) ×100 =18.45%.

Salinity: 18.45 ×1.806 = let's compute that precisely.

18 ×1.806 =32.508.

0.45 ×1.806 =0.8127.

Total: 32.508 +0.8127=33.3207% →33.32%.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is F:18% and 32.52%, but 33.32 is higher than 32.52. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check the moles again. 2.50 M AgNO3 ×0.0535 L =0.13375 moles. Correct.

Then Cl- is 0.13375 moles. Correct.

Mass of Cl- =0.13375 ×35.45 =4.7414375 g. Correct.

Mass of solution:25.7 g. Correct.

Chlorinity:4.7414375 /25.7 ×100 =18.45%. So about 18.45%.

Salinity:18.45 ×1.806 =33.32%.

But the options don't have this. Let me look at the options again.

Option F: Chlorinity 18%, Salinity32.52%.

Option J: 20%,35.52%.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different approach, like considering the mass of the solution as 25 ml ×1.028 g/ml =25.7 g. But perhaps the calculation is done as grams per kilogram, not grams per grams.

Wait, chlorinity is grams of Cl- per kilogram of solution. So 4.7414375 g Cl- in 25.7 g solution is 4.7414375 g Cl- in 0.0257 kg solution. So chlorinity is 4.7414375 /0.0257 ×100% → wait, that would be (4.7414375 /25.7) ×100 = same as before, 18.45%.

Wait, no, wait. Chlorinity is (Cl- in g) / (solution in kg) ×100. So 4.7414375 g Cl- / 0.0257 kg solution = (4.7414375 /25.7) ×100 = same as before, 18.45%.

Wait, so that part's correct. Then salinity is 18.45 ×1.806 ≈33.32%. Since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula for salinity. Sometimes, salinity is calculated as (chloride concentration in g/kg) × 1.806, which is the same as chlorinity ×1.806, because chlorinity is (Cl- g / solution kg) ×100, so Cl- g/kg = chlorinity. So salinity is Cl- g/kg ×1.806.

Wait, but in this case, chlorinity is 18.45% (g/kg), so salinity would be 18.45 ×1.806 =33.32%.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Maybe I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the reaction is AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3. So moles of AgNO3 = moles of NaCl = moles of Cl-.

So moles of Cl- is 0.13375, as before.

Mass of Cl- is 0.13375 ×35.45=4.7414375 g.

Mass of solution is 25.7 g.

Chlorinity: (4.7414375 /25.7) ×100 =18.45%.

Salinity: 18.45 ×1.806=33.32%.

Still, no option matches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The problem gives the volume as 25.00 ml and 53.50 ml, which suggests four significant figures. The density is 1.028 g/cc, four sig figs. The M of AgNO3 is 2.50 M, three sig figs.

So the moles of AgNO3 would be 2.50 M ×0.0535 L=0.13375, which is four sig figs.

So moles of Cl- is 0.13375, four sig figs.

Mass of Cl- is 0.13375 ×35.45=4.7414375, which is five sig figs, but considering the least is four, maybe 4.741 g.

Mass of solution:25.00 ×1.028=25.7 g, four sig figs.

Chlorinity:4.741 /25.7 ×100=18.45%→18.4% (three sig figs?), but the options are given with one decimal place, like 18%.

Wait, but option F is 18% chlorinity and 32.52% salinity. Let's compute 18.4% ×1.806=33.19%.

Hmm, but option F's salinity is 32.52%, which is less than 33.19%. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different factor for salinity. Maybe 1.806 is not the right factor, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the solution's mass is in kg, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me double-check: 53.50 ml is 0.0535 L. 2.50 M ×0.0535 L=0.13375 moles. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded, and the closest is F: 18% and 32.52%. But how?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact salinity using the precise chlorinity.

Chlorinity =18.45%.

Salinity=18.45 ×1.806=33.32%.

But the options don't have that. Maybe the problem expects us to use a different approach, like considering the equivalent weight or normality. Wait, no, because AgNO3 is a 1:1 reaction with Cl-.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula where the chloride concentration is in equivalents, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer to be approximate, so the closest option is F: Chlorinity 18%, Salinity 32.52%. But wait, 32.52% is less than 33.32%. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation for salinity again. Let me compute 18.45 ×1.806:

18 ×1.806=32.508.

0.45 ×1.806=0.8127.

Total:32.508 +0.8127=33.3207%.

Hmm, that's correct. So the salinity should be around 33.32%. But none of the options have that. The closest option is F:32.52%, which is 0.8% lower. Maybe the problem expects rounding to two decimal places, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different factor for salinity. I've heard that sometimes the factor is 1.806, but maybe it's different. Let me check: I think the formula is S = 1.806 × (Cl- concentration in g/kg). So if chlorinity is 18.45 g/kg, then S=18.45 ×1.806=33.32.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the total solids as 1.806 times the chloride, but perhaps the problem uses a different factor, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula where the mass of Cl- is calculated differently. Let me recheck that.

Moles of AgNO3 used: 2.50 M ×0.0535 L=0.13375 mol.

Molar mass of Cl is 35.45 g/mol.

Mass Cl-:0.13375 ×35.45=4.7414375 g.

Mass of solution:25.00 ml ×1.028 g/ml=25.7 g.

Chlorinity: (4.7414375 /25.7) ×100=18.45%.

Salinity:18.45 ×1.806=33.32%.

Hmm. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is F:18% and 32.52%, considering rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula where the moles of AgNO3 is not equal to moles of Cl-, but perhaps considering that the endpoint is when excess Ag+ is detected, so perhaps some of the Ag+ is in excess. But no, because the indicator is K2CrO4, which forms a precipitate with excess Ag+. So the moles of Ag+ used are just enough to precipitate all the Cl-, so the moles are equal. So that should be correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the answer to be option J:20% and 35.52%, but that would require higher chloride content, which would require more AgNO3. But in this case, the volume used is 53.50 ml, which is a significant amount, leading to a higher chloride content.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me check again.

53.50 ml is 0.0535 L. 2.50 M ×0.0535 =0.13375 moles. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the factor for salinity is different. I think the correct factor is 1.806, so perhaps the intended answer is not present, but perhaps the closest is option F:18% and 32.52%, with a slight approximation.

To determine the chlorinity and salinity of the sea water, the following steps were taken:

1. **Moles of AgNO₃ used**:  
   The volume of AgNO₃ solution used is 53.50 mL (0.0535 L), and the molarity is 2.50 M.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of AgNO₃} = 2.50 \, \text{M} \times 0.0535 \, \text{L} = 0.13375 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  
   Since the reaction between Ag⁺ and Cl⁻ is 1:1, the moles of Cl⁻ in the sea water sample are also 0.13375 moles.

2. **Mass of Cl⁻ in the sample**:  
   The molar mass of Cl is 35.45 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Cl⁻} = 0.13375 \, \text{mol} \times 35.45 \, \text{g/mol} = 4.7414375 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Mass of the sea water sample**:  
   The volume of the sea water sample is 25.00 mL (0.025 L), and the density is 1.028 g/mL.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of sea water} = 25.00 \, \text{mL} \times 1.028 \, \text{g/mL} = 25.7 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Chlorinity**:  
   Chlorinity is the percentage of Cl⁻ by mass.  
   \[
   \text{Chlorinity} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Cl⁻}}{\text{Mass of sea water}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4.7414375}{25.7} \right) \times 100 \approx 18.45\%.
   \]

5. **Salinity**:  
   Salinity is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Salinity} = \text{Chlorinity} \times 1.806.
   \]  
   Substituting the chlorinity:  
   \[
   \text{Salinity} = 18.45 \times 1.806 \approx 33.32\%.
   \]

6. **Comparison with options**:  
   The calculated chlorinity (18.45%) and salinity (33.32%) do not match any option exactly. However, the closest match is **Option F**: Chlorinity 18%, Salinity 32.52%, which aligns with the rounded values.

ANSWER: F
