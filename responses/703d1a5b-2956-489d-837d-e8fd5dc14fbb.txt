Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the value of an expression involving cosines of angles α, β, and γ. The given equations are a bit complicated, so I'll try to break them down step by step.

First, let's write down the given equations:

1. a = b cos γ + c cos β
2. b = c cos α + a cos γ
3. c = a cos β + b cos α

And we're told that a² + b² + c² > 0, which probably means that at least one of a, b, c is non-zero. The expression we need to find is cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ.

Hmm, that expression looks familiar. I think it's similar to the formula for cos(α + β + γ) or something with trigonometric identities. Wait, no, actually, I remember that cos(A + B + C) has a more complicated expansion. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the square of the sum of cosines. Let me think.

Wait, the expression cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ. That reminds me of the formula for (cos α + cos β + cos γ)² minus something. Let me expand (cos α + cos β + cos γ)²:

(cos α + cos β + cos γ)² = cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ + 2 cosα cosγ + 2 cosβ cosγ.

Hmm, not quite the same as the given expression. The given expression is cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ. So it's different by the terms involving products of two cosines.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of vectors or geometry. The given equations look like vector projections. Let me consider a, b, c as components of a vector in some coordinate system. Or perhaps think of them as edges of a triangle or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's a system of linear equations. Let me try to write them in matrix form. Let's see:

From equation 1:
a = b cos γ + c cos β
Which can be written as:
a = 0*a + cosγ * b + cosβ * c

Similarly, equation 2:
b = cosα * c + cosγ * a
So:
b = cosγ * a + 0*b + cosα * c

Equation 3:
c = cosβ * a + cosα * b
So:
c = cosβ * a + cosα * b + 0*c

So in matrix form, this is:

[ a ]   [ 0    cosγ   cosβ ] [ a ]
[ b ] = [ cosγ  0    cosα ] [ b ]
[ c ]   [ cosβ  cosα   0  ] [ c ]

Wait, that's interesting. So the system can be written as a matrix equation:

M * [a; b; c] = [a; b; c]

Where M is the matrix:
[ 0    cosγ   cosβ ]
[ cosγ  0    cosα ]
[ cosβ  cosα   0  ]

So this implies that (M - I) * [a; b; c] = 0, where I is the identity matrix. Since we have a non-trivial solution (because a² + b² + c² > 0), the determinant of (M - I) must be zero.

So let's compute the determinant of (M - I):

|M - I| = | -1    cosγ   cosβ |
          | cosγ  -1    cosα |
          | cosβ  cosα   -1 |

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row:

-1 * | -1   cosα |     - cosγ * | cosγ   cosα |     + cosβ * | cosγ   -1 |
          | cosα   -1 |             | cosβ    -1 |             | cosβ   cosα |

Calculating each minor:

First minor: | -1   cosα |
             | cosα  -1 |
= (-1)(-1) - (cosα)(cosα) = 1 - cos²α.

Second minor: | cosγ   cosα |
              | cosβ    -1 |
= (cosγ)(-1) - (cosα)(cosβ) = -cosγ - cosα cosβ.

Third minor: | cosγ   -1 |
             | cosβ   cosα |
= (cosγ)(cosα) - (-1)(cosβ) = cosγ cosα + cosβ.

Putting it all together:

|M - I| = (-1)(1 - cos²α) - cosγ (-cosγ - cosα cosβ) + cosβ (cosγ cosα + cosβ)

Let me expand each term:

First term: -1*(1 - cos²α) = -1 + cos²α.

Second term: -cosγ*(-cosγ - cosα cosβ) = cosγ*(cosγ + cosα cosβ) = cos²γ + cosα cosβ cosγ.

Third term: cosβ*(cosγ cosα + cosβ) = cosβ cosγ cosα + cos²β.

So adding all three terms together:

(-1 + cos²α) + (cos²γ + cosα cosβ cosγ) + (cosβ cosγ cosα + cos²β)

Simplify:

-1 + cos²α + cos²γ + cos²β + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ.

Because the terms with cosα cosβ cosγ appear twice (once from the second term and once from the third term).

So the determinant is:

-1 + (cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ) + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ.

But we know that the determinant must be zero because the system has a non-trivial solution. So:

-1 + (cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ) + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ = 0.

Rearranging:

cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ = 1.

So the value of the expression is 1. Looking at the options, D is 1.0.

The given equations can be represented as a matrix equation, leading to a determinant condition that simplifies to the desired expression equaling 1.
