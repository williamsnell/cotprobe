Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the magnetic intensity H given an electric field E. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let me think through this step by step.

The given electric field is E = jA cos(ω(t - z/c)). Wait, j is the unit vector in the y-direction, right? So E is oscillating in the y-direction. I remember that in electromagnetic waves, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. Since this wave is propagating in the z-direction (because it's a function of z), the magnetic field should be in either the x or the negative x direction, depending on the phase.

I think Maxwell's equations come into play here. Specifically, Faraday's Law. Faraday's Law in differential form says that the curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. But since we're dealing with H instead of B, I should probably use the version involving H. Oh right, the relation between B and H is B = μ₀ H, where μ₀ is the permeability of free space.

Wait, maybe I should use the integral form of Maxwell's equations. Let's see. The curl of E is -dB/dt. So, in phasor form or sinusoidal form, the time derivative would be straightforward.

Alternatively, for plane waves in free space, the relation between E and H is that E = c H × direction, where c is the speed of light. Wait, no, more precisely, the wave equations relate E and H, and their directions are perpendicular.

Let me think. Since E is in the y-direction, and the wave is propagating in +z, then H should be in the x-direction, but I'm not sure about the sign. Because the cross product of E and the direction of propagation (z) should give the direction of H. Wait, the Poynting vector is E × H, which gives the direction of wave propagation. Since the wave is in +z, E × H should point in +z. So if E is in y, then H must be in x because y × x = -z, but wait, that's not right. Wait, cross product:

Wait, unit vectors: i is x, j is y, k is z.

E is in j direction. The wave is moving in +z. The Poynting vector S is E × H, and it should point in +z. So E (j) × H (let's say in x, which is i) would be j × i = k, which is correct because it's +z. So H must be in the x-direction. So looking at the options, which have H in x (i) or z (k) or y (j)?

Looking back at the options, options B, C, F, G, I, J have various directions. Let me see:

Option B: H= (i A / c μ₀) cos[ω(t - z/c)]
Option C: H= (k A / c μ₀) cos[ω(t - z/c)]
Option D: H= (k A / c μ₀) sin[ω(t - z/c)]
Option G: H= (-i A / c μ₀) sin[ω(t - z/c)]
Option I: H= (i A / c μ₀) sin[ω(t - z/c)]
Option F: H= (j A / c μ₀) cos[...], but that's same direction as E, which can't be right because E and H are perpendicular.

So H must be in x or z. From the cross product, H should be along x (i direction) because E is j and wave is z. So options B, G, I are in i or -i.

Wait, but the phase is also important. The electric field is cos, and H is either sin or cos. Let's think about the time derivatives.

Faraday's Law: curl E = -μ₀ ∂B/∂t. Since B = μ₀ H, that becomes curl E = -μ₀ ∂(μ₀ H)/∂t → curl E = -μ₀² ∂H/∂t.

Wait, maybe using the wave equation approach. For a plane wave in free space, E and H are related by E = c H × direction (where direction is the unit vector of propagation). Here, the propagation is in +z, so direction is k.

So E = c (H × k). Let's compute H × k. H is in x (i), so H × k = i × k = j. Wait, no. Wait, cross product of i × k is -j. So E = c (H × k) → j A cos(...) = c (H × k). So H × k = (A/c) j cos(...).

Wait, H is in i. So H × k = i × k = j? Wait no, wait cross product order matters. i × k = j? Let me double-check the cross product rules:

i × j = k
j × k = i
k × i = j

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the correct cross products are:

i × j = k
j × k = i
k × i = j

Wait, no, another way: i × j = k, j × i = -k. So i × k would be j? Let me think: in the right-hand rule, fingers along i, curl towards k. The thumb points in the direction of i × k. So i points along x, k along z. Curling x into z, the thumb would point in the direction perpendicular to both. Wait, maybe it's better to write it down.

The cross product of i × k:

i (x), k (z). The cross product i × k is j (y) because when you point index (i) towards x, middle (k) towards z, your thumb points in y. So i × k = j.

Wait, but j is the y direction, which is the direction of E. So E = c (H × k) → j A cos(...) = c (H × k) = c (i × k) = c j.

Wait, but that would imply that E = c H × k → H × k = E / c → H × k = (j A cos(...)) / c.

But since H is in i, then H × k = i × k = j. So H × k = (A/c) j cos(...).

So from E = c (H × k), we have:

j A cos(...) = c (H × k) → j A cos(...) = c (i × k) → j A cos(...) = c j (since i × k = j). So H would have to satisfy H × k = (A/c) j cos(...).

Wait, but if H is in i, then H × k = i × k = j. So this would mean j = (A/c) j cos(...), which is not possible unless the time dependence is considered. Wait, perhaps I should express H in terms of E.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation E = c H × direction, where direction is the unit vector of propagation. Since the wave is propagating in +z, direction is k. So E = c (H × k).

We can write H × k = E / c.

Since E is in j, H × k must also be in j. So H × k = j (something).

H is in i, so H = H_i i. So H × k = (H_i i) × k = H_i (i × k) = H_i j.

So H × k = H_i j.

Set equal to E / c: E is j A cos(ω(t - z/c)), so E/c = (j A / c) cos(...).

Thus, H_i j = (j A / c) cos(...) → H_i = A/(c) cos(ω(t - z/c)).

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, none of the options have H as cos. Wait, the options have various functions. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the given E is cos, and H would be either sin or cos, depending on the derivative. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of Maxwell's equations.

Faraday's Law: curl E = -dB/dt. But B = μ₀ H, so curl E = -μ₀ dH/dt.

For a plane wave in z-direction, the curl of E in the y-direction (since E is in y) would involve the derivative in z. So let me compute curl E.

In Cartesian coordinates, curl E has components:

(∂E_z/∂y - ∂E_y/∂z) i + (∂E_x/∂z - ∂E_z/∂x) j + (∂E_y/∂x - ∂E_x/∂y) k.

Since E is only in y (E = j E_y), and propagates in z, E depends on z and t as cos(ω(t - z/c)).

So E_y = A cos(ω(t - z/c)).

So the only non-zero component of E is E_y.

Thus, curl E would have components:

- ∂E_y/∂z in the i direction,

and the other terms are zero because E_x and E_z are zero, and their derivatives are zero.

So curl E = ( - ∂E_y/∂z ) i.

But curl E = -μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

So:

- ∂E_y/∂z i = -μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

Simplify:

∂E_y/∂z i = μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

Now, E_y = A cos(ω(t - z/c)).

So ∂E_y/∂z = -A ω (1/c) sin(ω(t - z/c)).

So,

[ -A ω (1/c) sin(ω(t - z/c)) ] i = μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

Multiply both sides by -1:

A ω (1/c) sin(...) i = -μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

So,

∂H/∂t = - [A ω/(c μ₀)] sin(...).

Integrate with respect to time to find H. The integral of sin is -cos, so:

H = [A ω/(c μ₀)] ( cos(ω(t - z/c)) ) / ω ) + constant.

Wait, let me do it properly. ∂H/∂t = (A ω/(c μ₀)) (-sin(...)) ?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me re-do:

From above,

∂E_y/∂z = - (A ω / c) sin(ω(t - z/c)).

So,

- (A ω / c) sin(...) i = μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

So,

∂H/∂t = [ - (A ω / (c μ₀)) ] sin(...).

Integrate both sides with respect to time:

H = ∫ [ - (A ω / (c μ₀)) sin(ω t - ω z/c) ] dt.

Let me make substitution u = ω(t - z/c), so du = ω dt → dt = du/ω.

So,

H = - (A ω)/(c μ₀) ∫ sin(u) (du/ω) ) = - (A)/(c μ₀) ∫ sin(u) du = - (A)/(c μ₀) (-cos(u)) + const.

So,

H = (A)/(c μ₀) cos(u) + const.

Substitute back u = ω(t - z/c):

H = (A)/(c μ₀) cos(ω(t - z/c)) + const.

But wait, when you take the derivative of cos, you get -sin, so the time derivative would be - (A ω)/(c μ₀) sin(...), which matches the earlier expression. So the integration gives the correct sign.

Wait, but looking back, when we integrated ∂H/∂t = - (A ω/(c μ₀)) sin(...), the integral is H = (A/(c μ₀)) cos(...) + C. But we can assume that at t=0, H is zero (or some condition), so the constant C would be zero.

Hmm, but wait, the options don't have cos in H except for options B, C, F, etc. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option F: H= (j A / c μ₀) cos(...), which is j direction, same as E, which can't be right because E and H should be perpendicular.

Options B: H= (i A / c μ₀) cos(...). That's i direction, which is correct.

Option I: H= (i A / c μ₀) sin(...). That would be in i direction but with sin.

Wait, but according to our calculation, H has a cos term. So which option matches that? Option B is cos, and option I is sin.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me check the signs again.

From Faraday's Law, we have:

curl E = - ∂B/∂t.

But B = μ₀ H, so:

curl E = - μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

We found that curl E in the i direction is - ∂E_y/∂z i = - [ - (A ω/c) sin(...) ] i = (A ω/c) sin(...) i.

So,

(A ω/c) sin(...) i = - μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

Thus,

∂H/∂t = - (A ω)/(c μ₀) sin(...).

Integrate this:

H = ∫ - (A ω)/(c μ₀) sin(ω(t - z/c)) dt.

Which becomes:

H = (A)/(c μ₀) cos(ω(t - z/c)) + constant.

Assuming the constant is zero, H = (A)/(c μ₀) cos(ω(t - z/c)).

So H is in the i direction (x), because all the terms are along i.

Looking at the options, which have H in i direction and cos?

Option B: H= (i A / c μ₀) cos(...).

That's exactly what we have. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave is propagating in +z, and the Poynting vector should be in +z. The Poynting vector S is E × H. E is in j, H is in i, so j × i = k, which is correct. So the direction is correct.

But wait, the options for B is H= (i A / c μ₀) cos(...). So the coefficient is (A)/(c μ₀). But let me think about whether the coefficient is correct.

Another way to approach this is through the relation E = c (H × k). So H × k = E / c.

We have E = j A cos(ω(t - z/c)), so E/c = j (A/c) cos(...).

H must be in i, so H × k = i × k = j.

Thus, H × k = j = E/(c).

So H must be such that H × k = E/(c).

Which implies H = (E/(c)) × (k × something), but perhaps it's easier to see that since H is in i, and H × k = j, which is E/(c), then H = (E/(c)) × (1/(i × k)).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that H × k = E/c.

H is in i, so H × k = i × k = j. So j = E/c → E must be in j, which it is. So H is i times some coefficient.

The magnitude of H would be (E_y)/(c), because E = c (H × k), and H × k is j H_i, so E_y = c H_i → H_i = E_y / c.

But E_y is A cos(...), so H_i = (A cos(...)) / c.

Thus, H = (i A cos(...)) / c.

But considering units, H has units of A/m. E has units V/m. Since c has units m/s, and μ₀ is in H/m (H is Wb/A), let's check the option coefficients.

Option B: (i A)/(c μ₀) cos(...).

But according to our relation, H should be (A cos(...))/(c). So unless I've missed a μ₀ somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Maxwell's equation. Let me go back. The correct relation is E = c H × k, but that's in free space, and c = 1/√(μ₀ ε₀). So perhaps the correct relation includes μ₀.

Wait, more accurately, for a plane wave in free space, the relation is E = c (μ₀ H × k), because B = μ₀ H, and E = c B × k.

Wait, let me think again. The Maxwell equation for plane waves gives E and B perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. The relation is E = c B × k̂, where k̂ is the direction of propagation.

Since B = μ₀ H, then E = c μ₀ H × k̂.

So,

E = c μ₀ (H × k).

We can rearrange this to find H:

H × k = E/(c μ₀).

Taking the cross product with k, the inverse would involve the cross product with k again. So H = (E × k̂ )/(c μ₀).

Wait, let me do it properly.

We have E = c μ₀ (H × k).

So,

H × k = E/(c μ₀).

To solve for H, we can take the cross product of both sides with k:

(H × k) × k = E × k/(c μ₀).

Using vector triple product identity: (A × B) × C = B (A·C) - A (B·C).

So,

H × (k × k) - k × (k · H) = E × k/(c μ₀).

But k × k is zero, and k · H is the component of H along k, which is zero because H is in i direction (perpendicular to k). So,

- k × (k · H) = 0, so left side is H × 0 - 0 = 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, since H is in i direction, and k is in z, then H × k = i × k = j.

So,

j = E/(c μ₀).

Which implies that E must be in j direction, which it is.

So,

E = j A cos(...) = (c μ₀) (H × k) = c μ₀ j H_i.

So,

j A cos(...) = c μ₀ j H_i.

Cancel j:

A cos(...) = c μ₀ H_i.

Thus,

H_i = A / (c μ₀) cos(...).

So, H = (i A)/(c μ₀) cos(ω(t - z/c)).

Which matches option B.

Wait, but earlier via Maxwell's equation, we got H proportional to cos. But looking at the options, option B is exactly this. So the answer should be option B.

To determine the magnetic intensity \( \mathbf{H} \) in free space for the given electric field \( \mathbf{E} = jA \cos(\omega (t - z/c)) \), we use Maxwell's equations and the wave relationships between \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{H} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Direction of \( \mathbf{H} \):**
   - The electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) is in the \( y \)-direction (\( j \)).
   - The wave propagates in the \( z \)-direction.
   - The Poynting vector \( \mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H} \) must point in the \( z \)-direction.
   - Using the right-hand rule, \( \mathbf{H} \) must be in the \( x \)-direction (\( i \)) because \( j \times i = k \).

2. **Relation Between \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{H} \):**
   - For electromagnetic waves in free space, \( \mathbf{E} = c (\mathbf{H} \times \mathbf{k}) \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - Substituting \( \mathbf{H} = H_i \mathbf{i} \) and \( \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{k} \), we find \( \mathbf{H} \times \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{i} \times \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{j} \).
   - Thus, \( \mathbf{E} = c \mu_0 \mathbf{H} \times \mathbf{k} \), leading to \( H_i = \frac{E_y}{c \mu_0} \).

3. **Expression for \( \mathbf{H} \):**
   - Given \( E_y = A \cos(\omega (t - z/c)) \), substituting into \( H_i = \frac{E_y}{c \mu_0} \) gives:
     \[
     H_i = \frac{A}{c \mu_0} \cos(\omega (t - z/c)).
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \mathbf{H} = \frac{i A}{c \mu_0} \cos(\omega (t - z/c)) \).

4. **Matching with Options:**
   - The correct option must have \( \mathbf{H} \) in the \( x \)-direction (\( i \)) and proportional to \( \cos(\omega (t - z/c)) \).
   - Option **B** matches this form: \( \mathbf{H} = \frac{i A}{c \mu_0} \cos(\omega (t - z/c)) \).

### Conclusion:
The magnetic intensity \( \mathbf{H} \) is given by **Option B**.

Answer: B
