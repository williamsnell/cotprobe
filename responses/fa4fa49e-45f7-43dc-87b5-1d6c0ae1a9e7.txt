Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates. Hmm, I remember that the rate equation tells us how the rate of a reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants. The question gives me the rate equation for the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen. The reaction is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. The rate is given as k [H₂]² [H₂O]. I need to find the overall order of this rate equation.

Wait, I think the overall order is the sum of the exponents in the rate law. So for each reactant's concentration, we take the exponent and add them up. Let me break it down.

The rate equation is rate = k [H₂]^2 [H₂O]. So [H₂] has an exponent of 2, and [H₂O] has an exponent of 1. Adding those together: 2 + 1 = 3. So the overall order should be third order.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Order of reaction is about the dependence on concentrations. Each concentration's exponent adds to the total order. So for [H₂]^2, that's second order in H₂, and first order in H₂O. Together, 2+1=3, so third order overall.

Looking at the options, option B is third order overall. So the answer should be B.

The rate equation is given as rate = k [H₂]² [H₂O]. The overall order of the reaction is the sum of the exponents in the rate law. For [H₂], the exponent is 2, and for [H₂O], the exponent is 1. Adding these gives 2 + 1 = 3. Therefore, the overall order of the reaction is third order.

Answer: B
