Question:

A woman owned land in fee simple absolute. The woman conveyed the land to a friend "for life," and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?

Options:

A: The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.
B: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.
C: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable and her will transferred her entire estate.
D: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because the quitclaim deed from the daughter transferred any interest she might have had in the land.
E: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a contingent remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
F: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
G: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor.
H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.
I: The friend has a life estate and the local charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will transferred her entire estate.
J: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will devised her entire estate to a local charity.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let's take it step by step.

First, the woman owned land in fee simple absolute. She conveyed it to her friend "for life," and when the friend died, it was to go to her neighbor "and her heirs." So, I think this creates a life estate in the friend and a remainder in the neighbor. The remainder is to the neighbor and her heirs, which sounds like a vested remainder because it's given to a specific person (the neighbor) and their heirs. But wait, the remainder could be either vested or contingent depending on whether the interest is certain to vest.

Then, the neighbor dies. She left a will that devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. So, her will overrides the intestacy laws, right? So instead of the land going to her daughter, it goes to the charity. But wait, does this affect the remainder that was created when the woman conveyed the land?

One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. So, the daughter is trying to transfer any interest she might have inherited from her mother. But since the neighbor's will gave everything to the charity, the daughter didn't inherit anything. So, maybe the quitclaim deed doesn't do anything because the daughter had no interest to convey.

Now, considering the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP). The original conveyance was to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. The RAP looks at the possibility of a vesting beyond a life in being. The neighbor's heirs could include anyone, potentially even someone not alive yet. So, if the neighbor's heirs could include people who are not yet born, that creates a possibility of vesting too remotely. Wait, but the remainder was given to the neighbor and her heirs. The neighbor's own death ends her interest, but her heirs take at that point. So, the interest in the heirs is a remainder that might be subject to RAP because it's contingent on how long the neighbor's heirs live.

Wait, no. The remainder was to the neighbor and her heirsâ€”so the neighbor's interest is a life estate, and then the heirs get the fee simple. But the problem is that the heirs could be anyone, including those not yet born. So, the remainder could vest beyond the perpetuity period, making it void under RAP. If that's the case, then the neighbor's remainder is invalid, and the woman would have a reversion.

But let me think again. The original conveyance was to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. The neighbor's interest is not a life estate; it's a remainder. The RAP applies to remainders. If the remainder is subject to RAP and could vest beyond a life in being, it's void.

The neighbor's heirs could include people who are not yet born, so the interest might not vest within the lives of those alive at the creation of the interest. So the remainder to the neighbor's heirs is invalid under RAP. Therefore, the neighbor's interest is void, and the woman would have a reversion. But wait, the neighbor's interest was a remainder. If that's void, then the woman's estate reverts back to her upon the friend's death because the remainder is invalid.

But wait, the neighbor died, and her will transferred her estate to the charity. But if the neighbor's interest was invalid under RAP, she never had a remainder. So when she died, she didn't have any interest to transfer. Therefore, her will devising her entire estate to the charity doesn't affect the land because she didn't own any interest in it.

Then, the daughter tried to convey any interest she might have. Since the neighbor's remainder was void, the daughter didn't inherit anything because the neighbor didn't have an interest to pass on. So the daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend also doesn't transfer anything.

So, the friend has a life estate, the woman has a reversion, and the charity and daughter have nothing. But looking at the options, option A says the friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion because the neighbor's remainder was void. That seems to fit.

Wait, but another angle: when the woman conveyed to the neighbor and her heirs, the neighbor's interest was a remainder. If that's invalid under RAP, the gift fails, and the next in line would be the woman's reversion. So yes, the woman's reversion would take effect.

But another possibility is that the remainder was to the neighbor and her heirs, making it a vested remainder subject to open (since the number of heirs isn't fixed). That could be problematic under RAP because the vesting could happen beyond the perpetuity period. So the RAP would void the remainder, leaving the woman with a reversion.

So the friend has a life estate, the woman has a reversion, and the neighbor's attempted transfer via her will doesn't affect anything because she had no interest. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The woman conveyed the land to her friend for life, with a remainder to the neighbor and her heirs. The remainder to the neighbor's heirs is subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) because it could vest beyond a life in being, making it void. As a result, the woman retains a reversion. The neighbor's will devising her estate to the charity is ineffective because her remainder was void, and she had no interest to transfer. The daughter's quitclaim deed also conveys nothing because she inherited no interest. Thus, the friend holds a life estate, and the woman holds a reversion.
