Okay, so I have this fluid mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow. The problem involves a liquid flowing past a flat plate, and I need to find the boundary layer thickness, shear stress, and shear force per unit width. 

First, I'll note down the given information:

- Density (rho) = 62.4 lb/ft³
- Viscosity (mu) = 7.5 × 10^-4 lb/ft-s
- Free-stream velocity (U) = 12 ft/s
- Distance from leading edge (x) = 2 inches. Hmm, I need to convert inches to feet because all other units are in feet. So 2 inches is 2/12 = 0.1667 ft.

Alright, part a asks for the laminar boundary layer thickness. From what I remember, for laminar flow over a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness (delta) at a distance x is given by the Blasius solution. The formula is:

delta = ( (2 * mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2) * 0.389, I think. Wait, wait, let me get that right. Oh right, the formula is delta = ( (x * U) / (nu) )^(1/2) * (0.389), where nu is the kinematic viscosity.

Wait, kinematic viscosity nu is mu/rho. So I should calculate nu first.

Let me compute nu: mu is 7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s), and rho is 62.4 lb/ft³. So nu = mu/rho = (7.5e-4) / 62.4. Let me calculate that.

7.5e-4 divided by 62.4. Let's see, 7.5e-4 is 0.00075. 0.00075 / 62.4 is approximately 0.000012016 ft²/s. Wait, that seems really small. Let me check the calculation:

0.00075 ÷ 62.4 = 0.00075 / 62.4 ≈ 1.2016e-5 ft²/s. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the formula for delta is sqrt( (x * U) / nu ) multiplied by 0.389. Let me plug in the numbers:

x = 0.1667 ft, U = 12 ft/s, nu = 1.2016e-5 ft²/s.

So x*U = 0.1667 * 12 = 2.0004 ft²/s.

Then (x*U)/nu = 2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 ≈ let's compute that. 2.0004 divided by 0.000012016.

Well, 2 / 0.000012 is approximately 166666.6667. So (xU/nu) is about 166666.67. Taking the square root of that: sqrt(166666.67) is around 408.248 ft^(-0.5). Wait, no, wait. Wait, x is in ft, U in ft/s, nu in ft²/s. So x*U has units ft²/s, divided by nu (ft²/s) gives a dimensionless number. So sqrt(166666.67) is about 408.248. Then multiply by 0.389.

So delta = 408.248 * 0.389 ≈ let's calculate 408 * 0.389. 400 * 0.389 = 155.6, 8 * 0.389 = 3.112, so total approx 158.712 ft. Wait, that can't be right because 0.1667 ft is only 2 inches, and the boundary layer shouldn't be that thick. I must have messed up the units somewhere. Wait, no, because 0.389 is a dimensionless factor, so the units should come out right. Wait, but 408.248 is a number without units, so delta would be in ft. But 158 ft is way too big for a boundary layer at 2 inches from the leading edge. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me check again. Let me recalculate (x*U)/nu. x is 0.1667 ft, U 12 ft/s. So x*U = 2.0004 ft²/s. nu is 1.2016e-5 ft²/s. So 2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 = let's compute this more accurately.

2.0004 / 0.000012016 = 2.0004 ÷ 0.000012016 ≈ 166,400 (exact value can be calculated using a calculator, but perhaps I'm miscalculating).

Wait, 0.000012016 is 1.2016e-5. So 2 / 1.2016e-5 = 2 / 0.000012016 ≈ 166,400. Hmm, so sqrt(166,400) is about 408. So delta = 408 * 0.389 ≈ 158.7 ft. That's impossible because at x=0.1667 ft (2 inches), the boundary layer can't be 158 ft thick. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the formula is delta = ( ( (2 * mu * x) / (rho * U) ) )^(1/2), without the 0.389 factor. Or perhaps I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the formula is delta = ( ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) ) )^(1/2) * something else.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is delta = 5.99 x (x * U / nu )^(1/2) * (mu/(rho U))^(1/2). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh right, the Blasius solution gives delta as:

delta = ( ( ( (x * U) / nu ) ) )^(1/2) * 0.389

Wait, so that's correct. But let me check the numbers again.

Wait, nu = mu/rho = 7.5e-4 / 62.4 = let me calculate this more accurately.

7.5e-4 is 0.00075. 0.00075 divided by 62.4 equals approximately:

0.00075 ÷ 62.4 = 0.000012016 (so 1.2016e-5 ft²/s). Correct.

Then x = 0.1667 ft, U = 12 ft/s.

x*U = 0.1667 * 12 = 2.0004 ft²/s.

(x*U)/nu = 2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 ≈ let's compute 2 / 0.000012 = 166,666.6667.

So sqrt(166,666.67) ≈ 408.248.

Multiply by 0.389: 408.248 * 0.389 ≈ 158.7 ft.

That's impossible, so I must have made a mistake. Maybe the units are wrong. Wait, 2 inches is 0.1667 ft, yes. But the boundary layer at 2 inches can't be 158 ft. That doesn't make sense. I must have used the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, the formula is correct, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, mu is given as 7.5 × 10^-4 lb/(ft·s), and rho is 62.4 lb/ft³. So nu = mu/rho = (7.5e-4) / 62.4 = 1.2016e-5 ft²/s, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (x*U)/nu. Let me compute it again:

x = 0.1667 ft, U=12 ft/s. So x*U = 0.1667 * 12 = 2.0004 ft²/s.

Divide by nu (1.2016e-5 ft²/s):

2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 = 2.0004 / 0.000012016 ≈ 166,400.

Wait, 2.0004 ÷ 0.000012016 is approximately 166,400.

Square root of 166,400 is 408. So 408 * 0.389 ≈ 158.7 ft. That's the same result as before, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is delta = ( ( (x * U) / nu ) )^(1/2) * 0.389. But that gives the same result.

Hmm, maybe I should check if I used the correct units for nu. Wait, yes, all in ft and seconds.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the units are in imperial, and sometimes the formula uses different units. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate using different units, like inches, but no, the formula should be unit-agnostic as long as all units are consistent.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the dynamic viscosity differently. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I should use the formula delta = ( (2 * mu * x) / (rho * U^2) )^(1/2) * something. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should check the Blasius solution again. The Blasius solution gives the boundary layer thickness as delta = ( (x * U) / nu )^(1/2) * 0.389. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute (x*U)/nu again.

x = 0.1667 ft, U=12 ft/s. So x*U=2.0004 ft²/s.

nu = 1.2016e-5 ft²/s.

(x*U)/nu = 2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 = 2.0004 / 0.000012016 ≈ 166,400.

Square root of 166,400 is 408. So 408 * 0.389 ≈ 158.7 ft. That's impossible, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponent in mu. Wait, mu is 7.5 × 10^-4 lb/(ft·s). So that's 0.00075 lb/(ft·s). Correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is delta = ( (x * U) / nu )^(1/2) * 0.389, but if x is in inches, I should convert to feet. Wait, no, I did convert x to feet already.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this numerically again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Reynolds number first. Reynolds number Re_x = (rho * U * x) / mu.

Re_x = (62.4 lb/ft³) * (12 ft/s) * (0.1667 ft) / (7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s)).

Let me compute the numerator: 62.4 * 12 = 748.8, 748.8 * 0.1667 ≈ 123.81.

Denominator: 7.5e-4 = 0.00075.

So Re_x = 123.81 / 0.00075 ≈ 165,080.

Wait, that's a high Reynolds number. For laminar flow, Re_x should be less than around 1e5 or so. Wait, but 165,080 is higher than 1e5, so maybe the flow is turbulent, but the question specifies laminar. Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes laminar flow, so maybe I should proceed.

Wait, but the boundary layer thickness formula for laminar flow (Blasius) is applicable for Re_x << 1e6, so maybe the problem is designed to ignore that. Let's proceed.

So, delta = 0.389 * sqrt(x * U / nu). So x*U=2.0004, nu=1.2016e-5.

x*U/nu = 2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 ≈ 166,400.

sqrt(166,400)=408.

delta=0.389*408≈158.7 ft. That's way too big, which can't be correct. So I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula delta = ( (2 * mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2). Let me try that.

So, (2 * mu * x) = 2 * 7.5e-4 * 0.1667 ≈ 2 * 0.00075 * 0.1667 ≈ 0.00025.

rho * U = 62.4 * 12 = 748.8.

So (2mu x)/(rho U) = 0.00025 / 748.8 ≈ 3.34e-7.

Take square root: sqrt(3.34e-7) ≈ 5.78e-4. So delta≈5.78e-4 ft. That's 0.000578 ft, which is about 0.0069 inches. That seems more reasonable, but I'm not sure if this is the correct formula.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me check which formula is correct.

Upon checking, the correct formula for boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is indeed delta = ( (x * U) / nu )^(1/2) * 0.389.

But according to that, I'm getting delta=158.7 ft, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute x*U/nu correctly.

x=0.1667 ft, U=12 ft/s, nu=1.2016e-5 ft²/s.

x*U = 0.1667 *12 = 2.0004 ft²/s.

Divide by nu: 2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 = 2.0004 / 0.000012016 ≈ 166,400.

Square root of 166,400 is 408.

Multiply by 0.389: 408 * 0.389 ≈ 158.7 ft.

That can't be right. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula delta = ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2) * something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the boundary layer thickness in terms of the Reynolds number. The formula is delta = ( (x * U) / nu )^(1/2) * (0.389), which I've been using.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of nu. Let me check again.

mu = 7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s), rho=62.4 lb/ft³.

nu = mu / rho = 7.5e-4 / 62.4 = let's compute that exactly.

7.5e-4 = 0.00075.

0.00075 ÷ 62.4 = 0.000012016 (exactly 1.2016e-5). Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the units are in lb and ft, and I should use the correct units for the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the boundary layer thickness in inches instead of feet.

Wait, delta comes out in feet. 158.7 ft is 158.7 *12 = 1904.4 inches, which is way too big. That can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula delta = ( ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) ) )^(1/2) * something. Let me try that.

mu * x = 7.5e-4 * 0.1667 ≈ 0.000125.

rho * U = 62.4 * 12 = 748.8.

(mu x)/(rho U) = 0.000125 / 748.8 ≈ 1.668e-7.

Square root: sqrt(1.668e-7) ≈ 4.086e-4.

Multiply by 0.389: 4.086e-4 * 0.389 ≈ 1.59e-4 ft. That's 0.000159 ft, which is about 0.0019 inches. That seems more reasonable.

Wait, but which formula is correct? I think the correct formula is delta = ( (x * U) / nu )^(1/2) * 0.389, but I'm getting an impossible result. Alternatively, perhaps I should use delta = ( (2 * mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2), which gives me 5.78e-4 ft, which is 0.000578 ft or 0.00694 inches. That seems more plausible.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me look it up: The Blasius solution gives the boundary layer thickness as delta = ( (x * U) / nu )^(1/2) * 0.389. So that's the correct formula.

But with the numbers I'm using, I'm getting an impossible result. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert x to inches for the calculation, but that should not matter because the units are consistent within the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (x*U)/nu.

Wait, let me try calculating (x*U)/nu again.

x = 0.1667 ft, U=12 ft/s, so x*U=2.0004 ft²/s.

nu = 1.2016e-5 ft²/s.

2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 = 2.0004 / 0.000012016 ≈ let me compute this using a calculator approach.

0.000012016 goes into 2.0004 how many times? Let's see:

0.000012016 * 166,400 = 2.0004 (since 1e5 * 0.000012016 = 1.2016, so 1.2016 * 166.4 = 200.04). So yes, 2.0004 / 0.000012016 ≈ 166,400.

So sqrt(166400) is 408. So delta = 408 * 0.389 ≈ 158.7 ft.

That's impossible, so I must have made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the Reynolds number.

Wait, Re_x = (rho * U * x) / mu = (62.4 * 12 * 0.1667) / (7.5e-4) ≈ (62.4 * 12 * 0.1667) = 62.4 * 2 = 124.8. So 124.8 / 0.00075 = 166,400. So Re_x = 166,400.

Wait, that's a very high Reynolds number, which suggests the flow is turbulent, but the problem states it's laminar. So perhaps the problem assumes that the flow is laminar despite the high Re. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but if Re is 166,400, which is way above the critical Reynolds number for laminar flow (which is around 5e5 for a flat plate, I think), so actually, the flow should be turbulent. But the problem specifies laminar boundary layer, so perhaps I should proceed with the given formula.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula for delta is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for delta is:

delta = ( ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) ) )^(1/2) * 0.389 * sqrt(2).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula delta = ( (mu*x)/(rho*U) )^(1/2) * something.

Wait, let me think differently. The formula for delta is derived from the momentum equation, and it's given by:

delta = ( (2 * mu * x) / (rho * U^2) )^(1/2) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula delta = ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2) * (something). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity profile and find where the velocity is 0.99 U, but that seems more involved.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given answer options have delta around 0.002 to 0.004 ft, which is about 0.024 to 0.048 inches. That seems more reasonable.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try using the formula delta = ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2) * something.

Let me compute (mu * x)/(rho * U):

mu = 7.5e-4, x=0.1667, rho=62.4, U=12.

So (7.5e-4 * 0.1667) = 0.000125.

Divide by (62.4 * 12) = 748.8.

So (mu x)/(rho U) = 0.000125 / 748.8 ≈ 1.668e-7.

Take square root: sqrt(1.668e-7) ≈ 4.086e-4.

Multiply by 0.389: 4.086e-4 * 0.389 ≈ 1.59e-4 ft, which is 0.000159 ft or 0.0019 inches. That's about 0.002 ft, which matches option C's a) 0.002 ft.

Wait, but earlier using the Blasius formula, I got 158 ft, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximate formula without the 0.389 factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is delta = sqrt( (2 mu x)/(rho U) ), which would be sqrt( (2 * 7.5e-4 * 0.1667)/(62.4 * 12) ).

Compute numerator: 2 * 7.5e-4 = 1.5e-3. 1.5e-3 * 0.1667 ≈ 2.5e-4.

Denominator: 62.4 *12 = 748.8.

So (2 mu x)/(rho U) = 2.5e-4 / 748.8 ≈ 3.34e-7.

Square root: sqrt(3.34e-7) ≈ 5.78e-4 ft, which is 0.000578 ft or 0.00694 inches, which is about 0.00058 ft, close to option A's a) 0.0022 ft, but not quite. Hmm.

Wait, but the options have a) as 0.0022, 0.001, 0.002, etc. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the Blasius formula and accept that perhaps the calculation is correct, but the answer is not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact formula again.

Blasius formula: delta = 0.389 * sqrt( x * U / nu )

nu = mu/rho = 7.5e-4 /62.4 = 1.2016e-5.

x*U = 0.1667 *12 = 2.0004.

x*U/nu = 2.0004 / 1.2016e-5 ≈ 166,400.

sqrt(166,400) = 408.

delta = 0.389 *408 ≈158.7 ft. Impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the units of mu. Let me check: mu is given in lb/(ft·s). Is that correct? Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with the dynamic viscosity in different units, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually delta = ( ( (mu * x) ) / (rho * U) )^(1/2) * (0.389). Let me compute that.

(mu*x) = 7.5e-4 * 0.1667 ≈ 0.000125.

(rho*U) = 62.4 *12 = 748.8.

(mu*x)/(rho*U) = 0.000125 /748.8 ≈1.668e-7.

sqrt(1.668e-7) ≈4.086e-4.

Multiply by 0.389: 4.086e-4 *0.389 ≈1.59e-4 ft ≈0.000159 ft ≈0.0019 inches. That's about 0.00016 ft, which is 0.00016 ft. None of the options have that. The closest is option J's a) 0.0012 ft, which is 0.0144 inches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula without the 0.389 factor. Let me compute sqrt(x*U/nu) without the 0.389.

sqrt(166,400)=408 ft. That's way too big.

Wait, I'm stuck. The options have a) values around 0.001 to 0.004 ft, which is about 0.012 to 0.048 inches. But according to the Blasius formula, I'm getting 158 ft, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the dynamic viscosity (mu) differently. Let me check again.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is delta = ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2) * 0.389 * sqrt(2).

Wait, let me compute that.

(mu*x)=7.5e-4 *0.1667=0.000125.

(rho*U)=62.4*12=748.8.

(mu*x)/(rho*U)=0.000125/748.8=1.668e-7.

sqrt(1.668e-7)=4.086e-4.

Multiply by 0.389 * sqrt(2)=0.389*1.414≈0.551.

So delta=4.086e-4 *0.551≈2.253e-4 ft≈0.000225 ft, which is about 0.0027 inches. That's about 0.000225 ft, which is not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: a) 0.002 ft. Let me consider that.

If I take delta=0.002 ft, which is 0.024 inches, that seems reasonable.

But according to the Blasius formula, I'm getting 158 ft, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is delta = ( (mu * x) / (rho * U) )^(1/2) * 0.389.

Which would be 4.086e-4 *0.389≈1.59e-4 ft≈0.000159 ft, which is 0.0019 inches. That's about 0.00016 ft, which is not in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I must choose from the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to part b and c to see if the numbers match any option.

Part b asks for shear stress. The formula for shear stress in laminar flow is tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta).

Wait, but I don't have delta yet. Alternatively, tau can be calculated using tau = (rho * mu * U^2) / (2 delta^2). Wait, no, perhaps another formula.

Alternatively, from the boundary layer theory, the shear stress at a point in the boundary layer is given by tau = mu * dU/dy evaluated at y=delta. But in laminar flow, the velocity profile is U(y) = U * tanh(sqrt(y * U / (2 mu)) * x). Hmm, perhaps that's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the shear stress can be calculated using the formula tau = (rho * mu * U^2) / (2 delta^2).

Wait, but I don't have delta yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can express shear stress in terms of the boundary layer parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the shear stress can be calculated using tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta).

Wait, if I take delta as 0.002 ft (option C's a)), then:

tau = (7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s)) * 12 ft/s / (2 * 0.002 ft) = (0.009) / (0.004) = 2.25 lb_f/ft². But looking at the options, option C's b) is 0.227 lb_f/ft², which is much lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is tau = (mu * U) / (delta).

If delta is 0.002 ft, then tau = 0.00075 *12 /0.002 = 0.009 /0.002=4.5 lb_f/ft². But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is tau = (mu * U) / (2 * delta). So 0.00075 *12 / (2*0.002) = 0.009 /0.004=2.25 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the shear stress formula is tau = (rho * U^2) / (Re_x * x) * something. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between shear stress and the boundary layer parameters.

Wait, another approach: the shear stress can be found using tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta). But I don't have delta yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can express delta in terms of x, U, and nu.

Wait, delta = 0.389 * sqrt( x U / nu ). So delta^2 = (0.389)^2 * (x U / nu).

So delta^2 = (0.1513) * (x U / nu).

Then, tau = (mu U) / (2 delta) = (mu U) / (2 * 0.389 * sqrt(x U / nu)).

But mu/nu = rho, so mu = rho * nu.

So tau = (rho nu U) / (2 * 0.389 * sqrt(x U / nu)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (rho nu U) / (2 * 0.389 * sqrt(x U) / sqrt(nu)) )

= (rho nu U * sqrt(nu)) ) / (2 * 0.389 * sqrt(x U) )

= (rho * nu^(3/2) * U ) / (2 * 0.389 * sqrt(x U) )

Simplify U/sqrt(U) = sqrt(U).

So:

= (rho * nu^(3/2) * sqrt(U) ) / (2 * 0.389 * sqrt(x) )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute tau using the formula tau = (rho * U^2) / (Re_x * x). Wait, Re_x = (rho U x)/mu.

So tau = (rho U^2) / ( (rho U x)/mu * x ) ) = (rho U^2 * mu) / (rho U x^2) ) = (mu U) / x^2.

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Alternatively, perhaps I should use tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta), but without delta, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation that tau = (rho * U^2) / (Re_x * x) * (1/2). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute tau using the formula tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta). If I take delta as 0.002 ft (option C's a)), then:

tau = (7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s) * 12 ft/s) / (2 * 0.002 ft) = (0.009) / (0.004) = 2.25 lb_f/ft². But looking at the options, option C's b) is 0.227 lb_f/ft². That's an order of magnitude lower. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula tau = (mu * U) / (delta).

If delta is 0.002 ft, then tau = (0.00075 *12)/0.002 = 0.009 /0.002=4.5 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The shear stress in laminar flow is given by tau = (rho * mu * U^2) / (2 delta^2). If delta is 0.002 ft, then:

rho=62.4 lb/ft³, mu=7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s), U=12 ft/s.

So tau = (62.4 * 0.00075 * 144) / (2 * (0.002)^2).

Compute numerator: 62.4 *0.00075=0.0468. 0.0468 *144=6.7488.

Denominator: 2*(0.002)^2=2*0.000004=0.000008.

So tau=6.7488 / 0.000008=843,600 lb_f/ft². That's way too high. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta). Let me compute that with delta=0.002 ft.

mu=0.00075, U=12, so 0.00075 *12=0.009.

Divide by (2 *0.002)=0.004.

0.009 /0.004=2.25 lb_f/ft². Again, no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of delta from the Blasius formula, which is 158.7 ft, which would make tau= (0.00075*12)/(2*158.7)=0.009 /317.4≈0.0000283 lb_f/ft². That's way too low and not matching any options.

I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps the shear stress can be calculated using the formula tau = rho * U * (U/2) = 0.5 * rho * U^2. But that would be 0.5 *62.4 *144=0.5 *62.4 *144= 0.5 *8985.6=4492.8 lb_f/ft², which is way too high and doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for shear stress in a boundary layer, which is tau = (mu * U) / (2 * delta). But without the correct delta, I can't get the right tau.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options to see which one has a reasonable delta and tau combination.

Looking at the options:

Option C: a) 0.002 ft, b) 0.227 lb_f/ft².

Let me compute tau using delta=0.002 ft.

tau = (mu * U) / (2 * delta) = (0.00075 *12)/(2*0.002) = (0.009)/(0.004)=2.25 lb_f/ft². But option C's b) is 0.227, which is much lower. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is tau = (mu * U) / (delta). Let me compute that: 0.00075 *12 /0.002=0.009 /0.002=4.5 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is tau = (mu * U) / (2 * delta). So 2.25 lb_f/ft². But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using delta from option C, which is 0.002 ft.

Compute tau: (mu * U) / (2 * delta) = (0.00075 *12)/(2*0.002)=0.009 /0.004=2.25 lb_f/ft². But option C's b) is 0.227, which is an order of magnitude lower. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula tau = mu * U / (2 * delta).

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula without the 2. So tau = mu * U / delta.

Then, tau=0.00075 *12 /0.002=0.009 /0.002=4.5 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula tau = (rho * mu * U^2) / (2 * delta^2).

With delta=0.002 ft:

rho=62.4 lb/ft³, mu=0.00075 lb/(ft·s), U=12 ft/s.

So, tau = (62.4 *0.00075 *144)/(2*(0.002)^2).

Compute numerator: 62.4*0.00075=0.0468. 0.0468*144=6.7488.

Denominator: 2*(0.002)^2=2*0.000004=0.000008.

So tau=6.7488 /0.000008=843,600 lb_f/ft². That's way too high, so I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. In laminar flow, the shear stress at the plate is tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta). If delta is 0.002 ft, then tau= (0.00075 *12)/(2*0.002)=0.009 /0.004=2.25 lb_f/ft². But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use tau = (mu * U) / (delta). So 0.00075*12 /0.002=4.5 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula tau = (rho * U^2) / Re_x. Re_x is (rho U x)/mu = (62.4 *12 *0.1667)/0.00075≈166,400.

So tau = (62.4 *144)/166,400≈ (8985.6)/166,400≈0.054 lb_f/ft². That's close to option C's b) 0.227 lb_f/ft², but not quite.

Wait, perhaps I should use tau = (rho * U^2) / (2 Re_x). So 8985.6 / (2*166,400)=8985.6/332,800≈0.02699 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

I'm clearly stuck here. Let me try to compute the shear force per unit width, part c, to see if that helps.

Part c asks for shear force per unit width, which is F = tau * delta * U. Or perhaps F = integral of tau over the boundary layer thickness. Wait, in laminar flow, the shear force per unit width is given by F = 0.5 * rho * U^2 * delta. Or perhaps F = (rho * U^2 * delta^2) * something.

Alternatively, perhaps the shear force per unit width is F = (tau * delta) * U. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the shear force per unit width is F = 0.5 * rho * U^2 * delta. Let me compute that.

If delta is 0.002 ft, rho=62.4 lb/ft³, U=12 ft/s.

Then F=0.5 *62.4 *144 *0.002=0.5 *62.4 *144 *0.002=0.5 *62.4 *0.288=0.5 *17.952=8.976 lb_f/ft. But option C's c) is 0.0757 lb_f/ft, which is much lower. So this approach is not working.

Alternatively, perhaps F = (mu * U^2) / (2 delta). So with delta=0.002 ft:

F= (0.00075 *144)/(2*0.002)= (0.108)/(0.004)=27 lb_f/ft. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps F = (mu * U) / delta. So 0.00075*12 /0.002=4.5 lb_f/ft. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula F = (0.5 * rho * U^2) * delta. So 0.5*62.4*144*0.002=0.5*62.4*144*0.002= same as before, 8.976 lb_f/ft. Not matching.

I'm clearly not getting the right approach here. Let me try to find an alternative method.

Perhaps I should use the exact Blasius solution, but I'm getting an impossible delta. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the given options are incorrect, but I have to choose from them.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula for delta is delta = sqrt( (2 mu x)/(rho U) ). Let me compute that.

mu=7.5e-4, x=0.1667, rho=62.4, U=12.

So 2 * mu *x = 2 *0.00075 *0.1667≈0.00025.

Divide by rho *U=62.4*12=748.8.

So (2mu x)/(rho U)=0.00025/748.8≈3.34e-7.

Square root: sqrt(3.34e-7)=5.78e-4 ft≈0.000578 ft≈0.00694 inches. That's about 0.00058 ft. None of the options have that, but option J's a) is 0.0012 ft, which is 0.0144 inches, closer but still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to use the formula without the 0.389 factor, giving delta=5.78e-4 ft≈0.000578 ft. But the closest option is J's a) 0.0012 ft.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, a) 0.002 ft, b) 0.227 lb_f/ft², c) 0.0757 lb_f/ft.

If I take delta=0.002 ft, then:

tau = (mu * U)/(2 delta) = (0.00075 *12)/(2*0.002)=0.009/0.004=2.25 lb_f/ft². But option C's b) is 0.227, which is an order of magnitude lower. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check mu again. mu=7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s). Is that correct? Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for tau is tau = (mu * U) / (delta). So with delta=0.002 ft, tau=0.00075 *12 /0.002=4.5 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta). So 2.25 lb_f/ft². But option C's b) is 0.227, which is 2.25 /10. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert delta to inches. delta=0.002 ft=0.024 inches. Let me compute tau again.

mu=7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s)=7.5e-4 *12 lb/(in·s)=0.009 lb/(in·s).

U=12 ft/s=144 in/s.

delta=0.024 in.

So tau=(mu * U)/(2 delta)=(0.009 lb/(in·s) *144 in/s)/(2 *0.024 in)= (1.296)/(0.048)=27 lb_f/in². That's 27 psf, which is 27 lb_f/ft² (since 1 psi=144 psf). So 27 lb_f/ft². But none of the options have that.

Wait, but if I use the formula tau = (mu * U) / (2 delta), and delta in inches, then:

mu=7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s)=7.5e-4 *12 lb/(in·s)=0.009 lb/(in·s).

U=12 ft/s=144 in/s.

delta=0.024 in.

tau=(0.009 *144)/(2*0.024)= (1.296)/(0.048)=27 lb_f/in²=27 psf=27 lb_f/ft². Again, not matching any option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C, even though my calculations don't match perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most reasonable delta from the options is around 0.002 ft, which is option C's a). Then, for shear stress, option C's b) is 0.227 lb_f/ft². Let me check if that makes sense.

If delta=0.002 ft, then using tau = (mu * U)/(2 delta)= (0.00075 *12)/(2*0.002)=0.009/0.004=2.25 lb_f/ft². But option C's b) is 0.227, which is exactly 2.25 /10. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should convert mu from lb/(ft·s) to lb/(in·s). Let me try that.

mu=7.5e-4 lb/(ft·s)=7.5e-4 *12 lb/(in·s)=0.009 lb/(in·s).

U=12 ft/s=144 in/s.

delta=0.002 ft=0.024 in.

Then tau=(mu * U)/(2 delta)= (0.009 *144)/(2*0.024)= (1.296)/(0.048)=27 lb_f/in²=27 psf=27 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula tau = (mu * U)/(delta) without the 2, giving 4.5 lb_f/ft². Still not matching.

I think I've exhausted all options and must conclude that the correct answer is option C: a) 0.002 ft, b) 0.227 lb_f/ft², c) 0.0757 lb_f/ft.
</think>

To solve the problem, the boundary layer thickness, shear stress, and shear force per unit width were calculated using the given parameters:

- **Density (ρ)** = 62.4 lb/ft³  
- **Viscosity (μ)** = 7.5 × 10⁻⁴ lb/(ft·s)  
- **Free-stream velocity (U)** = 12 ft/s  
- **Distance from leading edge (x)** = 2 inches = 0.1667 ft  

### Part (a): Laminar Boundary Layer Thickness  
The boundary layer thickness (δ) is determined using the Blasius solution formula:  
\[
\delta = 0.389 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{x \cdot U}{\nu}}
\]
where \( \nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho} = \frac{7.5 \times 10^{-4}}{62.4} = 1.2016 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \).  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\delta = 0.389 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.1667 \cdot 12}{1.2016 \times 10^{-5}}} = 0.389 \cdot \sqrt{166,400} \approx 0.389 \cdot 408 \approx 158.7 \, \text{ft}.
\]
This result is unreasonably large, suggesting a potential error in the formula or units. Reassessing the options, the most plausible thickness is **0.002 ft**.

### Part (b): Shear Stress  
The shear stress (τ) is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\tau = \frac{\mu \cdot U}{2 \cdot \delta}.
\]
Using \( \delta = 0.002 \, \text{ft} \):  
\[
\tau = \frac{7.5 \times 10^{-4} \cdot 12}{2 \cdot 0.002} = \frac{0.009}{0.004} = 2.25 \, \text{lb}_f/\text{ft}^2.
\]
However, the closest option is **0.227 lb_f/ft²**, indicating a possible discrepancy in the approach.

### Part (c): Shear Force per Unit Width  
The shear force per unit width (F) is given by:  
\[
F = \tau \cdot \delta \cdot U.
\]
Using \( \tau = 0.227 \, \text{lb}_f/\text{ft}^2 \) and \( \delta = 0.002 \, \text{ft} \):  
\[
F = 0.227 \cdot 0.002 \cdot 12 = 0.005448 \, \text{lb}_f/\text{ft}.
\]
The closest option is **0.0757 lb_f/ft**, suggesting a mismatch in calculations.

### Conclusion  
Given the inconsistencies and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **Option C**, which aligns with the plausible boundary layer thickness and shear stress values.

**Answer: C**
