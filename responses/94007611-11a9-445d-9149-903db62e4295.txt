Okay, so I've got this question about the length of an E. coli chromosome compared to the cell itself. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question says the DNA molecule has about 4.5 million mononucleotide units. Each of these is spaced 3.4 Å apart. So, I think I need to calculate the total length of the DNA by multiplying the number of units by the spacing between them. 

Wait, 4.5 million is 4.5 x 10^6, right? And each unit is 3.4 Å. So, the total length in Ångströms would be 4.5e6 * 3.4. Let me do that math. 4.5 * 3.4 is... let's see, 4 * 3.4 is 13.6, and 0.5 * 3.4 is 1.7, so together it's 15.3. So 15.3e6 Å. But wait, that's 15.3 million Å. 

Wait, no, wait. 4.5e6 multiplied by 3.4 is 4.5 * 3.4 = 15.3, so 15.3e6 Å. So 15,300,000 Å. But I think I should convert that into meters because the size of the E. coli cell is probably in micrometers or something. 

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 15.3e6 Å is 15.3e6 * 1e-10 meters. Let's compute that. 15.3e6 is 1.53e7. So 1.53e7 * 1e-10 = 1.53e-3 meters, which is 1.53 millimeters. Hmm, that seems too long. Wait, E. coli is like a few micrometers long, right? So maybe I'm making a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of nanometers or micrometers instead. Let me try another approach. Since 1 Å is 0.1 nanometers, so 3.4 Å is 0.34 nm. So each mononucleotide unit contributes 0.34 nm. So for 4.5 million units, the length would be 4.5e6 * 0.34e-9 meters. Wait, because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters. So 0.34 nm is 0.34e-9 m. 

Calculating that: 4.5e6 * 0.34e-9 = (4.5 * 0.34) * 1e6 * 1e-9. 4.5 * 0.34 is 1.53. Then 1e6 * 1e-9 is 1e-3. So 1.53 * 1e-3 meters, which is 0.00153 meters, or 1.53 millimeters. Wait, that's the same as before. But E. coli is about 2 micrometers long, right? Wait, no, wait. I think E. coli is about 1-2 micrometers in length. So 1.53 mm is 1530 micrometers. So the DNA is 1530 micrometers long, and the cell is about 2 micrometers. So the ratio would be 1530 / 2 = 765 times as long. 

Wait, but that would make the answer F: 765 times as long. But let me double-check. Oh wait, wait a minute. Wait, the problem statement says the molecular weight is 2.80e9, but maybe that's a distractor because the question is about length, not molecular weight. So I can ignore the MW for this calculation. 

So the steps again: 4.5e6 units, each 3.4 Å apart. 3.4 Å is 3.4e-10 meters. So 4.5e6 * 3.4e-10 m. Let's compute 4.5 * 3.4 = 15.3. Then 1e6 * 1e-10 = 1e-4. So 15.3e-4 meters is 0.00153 meters, which is 1.53 mm. 

Wait, but E. coli's length is about 2 micrometers, so 1.53 mm is 1530 micrometers. So 1530 / 2 = 765. So the DNA is 765 times longer than the cell. So the correct option is F: 765 times as long as the cell.

The total length of the E. coli chromosome is calculated by multiplying the number of mononucleotide units (4.5 million) by the spacing between each unit (3.4 Å). Converting the spacing to meters (3.4 Å = 3.4 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) and performing the calculation gives a length of approximately 1.53 mm. Comparing this to the length of the E. coli cell (approximately 2 micrometers), the ratio is 1530 micrometers (DNA) divided by 2 micrometers (cell), resulting in the DNA being 765 times as long as the cell.

Answer: F
