Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options is a characteristic of a developed country. Let me go through each option one by one and see which makes sense.

Option A says over 50% of the workforce is in agriculture. I remember that in developed countries, most people work in industries other than farming. Like, they have more services, technology, and manufacturing. So A is probably not correct.

Option B is high political instability. I think developed countries usually have stable governments. Places like the USA, Japan, or Germany are known for their political stability. So B doesn't sound right either.

Option C says most people live in rural areas. I thought that in developed countries, the majority live in cities because urbanization is higher there. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D says women are held in an inferior place. Many developed countries have strong gender equality laws and high female workforce participation. So D probably isn't a characteristic.

Option E is lower levels of literacy and education. No, developed countries usually have high literacy rates and invest a lot in education systems. So E is not the answer.

Option F mentions high birth and death rates. I think birth rates are actually lower in developed countries, sometimes even below replacement level. Death rates might be higher due to an aging population, but I'm not sure. Maybe F isn't the best choice.

Option G says main diseases are related to age and lifestyle. That makes sense because in developed countries, people live longer, so diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are more common. So G could be a correct characteristic.

Option H is dominance of subsistence economy. Subsistence economies are more common in developing countries where people produce what they need. Developed countries have more market economies, so H is probably not right.

Option I talks about limited access to clean water and sanitation. Developed countries generally have good infrastructure, so access to clean water and sanitation is widespread. So I is incorrect.

So after going through all the options, G seems to fit because developed countries have populations that are older and face health issues related to lifestyle and age.

The correct answer is G: Main disease related to age and lifestyle.
