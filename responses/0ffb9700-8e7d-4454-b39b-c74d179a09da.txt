Okay, so I need to figure out how much interest Paul paid on his loan. Let's see, he took a loan of $384.75 for 60 days at 6% interest. Hmm, I think this is a simple interest problem because it's a short-term loan, probably calculated using the simple interest formula.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is the time in years. Right, so first, I need to make sure all the units match. The rate is given as 6%, which I should convert to a decimal, so that's 0.06. The time is 60 days, but since the rate is annual, I need to convert days into years. There are 365 days in a year, so 60 days is 60/365 years. Let me calculate that: 60 divided by 365 is approximately 0.1644 years.

Now, plugging the numbers into the formula: P is $384.75, R is 0.06, and T is 0.1644. So I = 384.75 * 0.06 * 0.1644. Let me compute each step. First, 384.75 multiplied by 0.06. Let's see, 384.75 * 0.06 is 23.085. Then, multiply that by 0.1644. So 23.085 * 0.1644. Hmm, let me do that multiplication.

Calculating 23.085 * 0.1644: Let's break it down. 23 * 0.1644 is about 3.7792. Then, 0.085 * 0.1644 is approximately 0.014. Adding those together gives roughly 3.7792 + 0.014 = 3.7932. So the interest is approximately $3.79.

Looking at the options, the closest amount is option F: $2.75, option H: $2.50, option I: $4.50, etc. Wait, $3.79 isn't exactly matching any of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I should check my time calculation. 60 days is a bit more than 1/6 of a year because 365 divided by 6 is about 60.83, so 60 days is roughly 60/365 = 0.1644. That seems right. Alternatively, sometimes people use 360 days for certain loan calculations, like banker's years. Let me try that. If T is 60/360 = 0.1667 years. Let's recalculate with that.

I = 384.75 * 0.06 * (60/360). Let's compute: 384.75 * 0.06 is 23.085 as before. Then, 23.085 * (1/6) is approximately 3.8475. So about $3.85. Looking at the options, option B is $3.85. That's one of the choices. So maybe that's the correct answer.

Wait, but why did I get $3.79 when using 365 days and $3.85 using 360 days? The correct approach might depend on whether the interest calculation uses 360 days or 365. In banking, sometimes they use 360 days for simplicity, especially for short-term loans. So perhaps the intended answer here is $3.85, which is option B.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider another approach. Let me check if the interest is calculated daily. The daily interest rate would be 6% divided by 365 days. So 0.06 / 365 = approximately 0.00016438 per day. Then, multiply by 60 days: 0.00016438 * 60 ≈ 0.0098628. Then multiply by the principal: 384.75 * 0.0098628 ≈ 3.80. So again, around $3.80, which isn't exactly an option, but closer to $3.85 if using 360 days.

Wait, the options don't have $3.80, but option C is $4.15, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as 6% per annum, but the time is considered as 60 days, so maybe using a different method. Let me see, perhaps the formula is (P * R * T) / 365, which would be (384.75 * 6 * 60) / (365 * 100). Let's compute that.

384.75 * 6 = 2308.5. Multiply by 60: 2308.5 * 60 = 138,510. Then divide by 365*100=36,500. So 138,510 / 36,500 ≈ 3.80. Again, about $3.80. Not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated using exact days. Let me think, perhaps the rate is 6% annually, so the daily rate is 0.06/365. Let's compute that precisely. 0.06 / 365 = 0.0001643835616 per day. Multiply by 60 days: 0.0001643835616 * 60 = 0.009863013696. Now, multiply by $384.75: 384.75 * 0.009863013696 ≈ 3.80.

Still, around $3.80. The closest option is B: $3.85, which is $3.85. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using 360 days, which would give exactly $3.85. Let me check that: 60/360 = 1/6. So 384.75 * 0.06 = 23.085. 23.085 * (1/6) = 3.8475, which rounds to $3.85. So option B.

But wait, the options don't have $3.85 as correct? Let me look again. The options are: A:5.75, B:3.85, C:4.15, D:5.00, E:1.15, F:2.75, G:7.25, H:2.50, I:4.50, J:6.00.

So yes, option B is $3.85. So I think that's the correct answer. Maybe the question assumes a 360-day year for calculation purposes.

The interest is calculated using the simple interest formula: I = P * R * T. Converting the annual interest rate of 6% to a decimal gives 0.06. The time of 60 days is converted to years using either 365 or 360 days. Using 360 days (common in banking) results in T = 60/360 = 0.1667. Plugging these into the formula: I = 384.75 * 0.06 * 0.1667 ≈ $3.85. Therefore, the closest option is B.

Answer: B
