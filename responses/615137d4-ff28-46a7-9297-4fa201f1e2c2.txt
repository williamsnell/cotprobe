Question:

A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of temperatures to 39.4°C (102.9°F) for 8 days. Examination shows anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis bilaterally, a strawberry tongue, an erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet.

Options:

A: Intravenous penicillin
B: Oral amoxicillin
C: Oral aspirin
D: Oral ibuprofen
E: Intravenous azithromycin
F: Intravenous corticosteroids
G: Intravenous prednisone
H: Intravenous immune globulin
I: Oral isoniazid
J: Intravenous vancomycin

Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. So, the patient is a 4-year-old boy with a high fever for 8 days. The symptoms mentioned include anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis bilaterally, a strawberry tongue, an erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what these symptoms point to.

First, the high fever lasting for a week or more is concerning. The lymphadenopathy in the neck makes me think of something like strep throat or maybe a viral infection. The conjunctivitis being nonexudative suggests it's not bacterial, like from chlamydia or something, but more likely viral. The strawberry tongue is classic for scarlet fever, which is caused by group A Streptococcus. The rash is erythematous and truncal, which aligns with scarlet fever's rash, and the edema in hands and feet, especially if it's circumferential, could be signs of a more severe condition.

Putting this together, I'm thinking about Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is characterized by a prolonged fever, rash, strawberry tongue, and extremity edema. It's a vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications like coronary artery aneurysms.

Now, the question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications. From what I remember, the treatment for Kawasaki disease typically involves high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is option H. The reason IVIG is used is to reduce the immune response and prevent the development of aneurysms and other vascular complications.

Looking at the other options to make sure I'm not missing something: 

A: IV penicillin – That's more for bacterial infections like strep, but since this seems to be a viral or immune-mediated condition, penicillin might not be effective here.

B: Oral amoxicillin – Same reasoning as penicillin. Unless there's evidence of a bacterial infection, like strep, but the symptoms don't clearly point to that, especially with the rash and edema.

C: Oral aspirin – Aspirin is used for fever and pain, but in Kawasaki, high-dose IVIG is the standard treatment, not oral aspirin. Plus, aspirin is avoided in children due to Reye's syndrome risk.

D: Oral ibuprofen – Again, for fever and inflammation, but not the main treatment for Kawasaki.

E: IV azithromycin – That's an antibiotic for chlamydia or other bacterial infections. Doesn't fit here.

F: IV corticosteroids – These can be used in some cases if IVIG fails, but they're not the first-line treatment.

G: IV prednisone – Same as F, not the initial choice.

H: IV immune globulin – Yes, this is the standard treatment.

I: Oral isoniazid – For tuberculosis prophylaxis, not relevant here.

J: IV vancomycin – For severe bacterial infections, not applicable.

So, the correct answer should be H: Intravenous immune globulin.

The symptoms described are consistent with Kawasaki disease, which is a systemic vasculitis affecting children. The key symptoms include prolonged fever, strawberry tongue, erythematous rash, and edema of the hands and feet. Kawasaki disease requires prompt treatment to prevent complications such as coronary artery aneurysms. The standard treatment is high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which modulates the immune response and reduces the risk of vascular complications. 

The other options are not appropriate because they either address unrelated conditions or are not the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease. 

Answer: H
