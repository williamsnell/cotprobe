Okay, so I've got this question about who was on the $500 bill. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the historical figures on old U.S. currency, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about U.S. bills and the people featured on them.

I know that the $1 bill has George Washington, the first president. The $2 bill has Thomas Jefferson, who was the third president. The $5 bill is Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president. The $10 bill is Alexander Hamilton, but wait, he's not an option here. The $20 bill features Andrew Jackson, the seventh president. The $50 bill is Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th president. The $100 bill is Benjamin Franklin, a Founding Father and statesman.

Wait, the question is about the $500 bill. I'm trying to remember if I've ever seen a $500 bill. I think they're not commonly used anymore, but they were in circulation at some point. I'm pretty sure the $500 bill features someone else. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A: Calvin Coolidge, B: Abraham Lincoln, C: George Washington, D: Benjamin Franklin, E: Andrew Jackson, F: William McKinley, G: Thomas Jefferson, H: John Adams, I: Ulysses S. Grant, J: Aaron Burr.

From what I remember, the $500 bill was actually featuring a statesman or a president. I think it was someone like James Madison or maybe someone else, but those aren't in the options. Wait, let me think again. I believe the $500 bill had William McKinley on it. McKinley was the 25th president, and I think he was on the $500 bill. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another denomination.

Wait, another thought: the $500 bill had a portrait of someone else. Let me see... I think it was actually William McKinley. He was on the $500 bill, and Grover Cleveland was on the $1000 bill. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it was James Madison or James Buchanan, but those aren't options here.

Looking back at the options, F is William McKinley. So based on that, I think the answer is F.
