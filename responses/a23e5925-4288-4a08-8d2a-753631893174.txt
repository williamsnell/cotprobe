Okay, so I've got this problem here. Lucy is counting by 2s, starting at 2 and stopping at 50. I need to figure out which number she would not count. Let's break this down step by step.

First, when someone counts by 2s, they're essentially listing even numbers. So starting at 2, the sequence would be 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on, up to 50. That makes sense because each step adds 2 to the previous number.

Now, looking at the options given: A is 24, B is 4, C is 22, D is 2, E is 11, F is 38, G is 50, H is 48, and I is 34. I need to check each of these to see if they fit into the sequence of even numbers from 2 to 50.

Let's go through them one by one.

A: 24. That's even, so yes, Lucy would count it.
B: 4. Also even, definitely in the sequence.
C: 22. Even, so yes.
D: 2. That's the starting point, so yes.
E: 11. Hmm, 11 is odd. Since Lucy is counting by 2s, she would only say even numbers. So 11 wouldn't be in her count.
F: 38. Even, so yes.
G: 50. That's the stopping point, so yes.
H: 48. Even, yes.
I: 34. Even, so included.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The sequence is 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 50. All numbers in this sequence are even. So any odd number in the options is the one she wouldn't count. Looking back, E is 11, which is odd. So that's the number she wouldn't count.

I think that's it. So the answer should be E.

The answer is E.
