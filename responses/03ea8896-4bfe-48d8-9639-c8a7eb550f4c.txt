Question:

A developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural part of the county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. The franchise right created for public utilitycompanies would most likely be an example of a(an)

Options:

A: restrictive covenant.
B: license.
C: real covenant.

E: covenant running with the land.
F: profit à prendre.

Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about property law. Let me read through the question again and break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is about a developer who owns a large rural area and drafts a general development plan. This plan includes restrictions and limitations that apply to all future owners and their heirs, assigns, and lessees. One of the restrictions is a franchise right for public utility companies along a 10-foot strip behind each lot, giving them ingress and egress rights. Another restriction is that no house or structure can be built on that strip.

The question is asking what kind of legal instrument this franchise right is. The options include various terms like restrictive covenant, license, real covenant, etc. I need to figure out which one fits best.

First, I should recall what each of these terms means.

A restrictive covenant is a type of covenant that limits the use of land. It's a private agreement that runs with the land, binding future owners. They typically appear in deeds and are used to impose rules on how property can be used.

A license is usually a personal, revocable privilege to use land. It's not tied to the land itself but to the person holding it. Licenses don't typically run with the land to successors.

A real covenant is another term for a covenant that runs with the land. It's a binding agreement that extends beyond the original parties to subsequent owners. It can be either negative (restricting use) or positive (requiring some action).

An equitable servitude is similar to a real covenant but arises from a court's interpretation of promissory estoppel or other equitable principles when strict legal requirements for a covenant aren't met. It's enforceable against successors even if it wasn't in the deed.

A covenant running with the land is a general term for covenants that bind future owners. It's essentially the same as a real covenant but without the distinction between real and equitable.

A profit à prendre is the right to take resources from another's land, like minerals or crops. It's a type of easement.

An easement in gross is a right to use land for a specific purpose, not tied to ownership of adjacent land. It can be personal to an individual or for a company.

An easement appurtenant benefits another parcel of land and is tied to it. It requires two parcels: the dominant estate and the servient estate.

So, looking at the problem, the developer created a franchise right for utilities along a strip, allowing ingress and egress. This sounds like an easement because it's a right to use another's land for a specific purpose. But is it an easement in gross or appurtenant?

Easements appurtenant benefit another parcel, like a neighboring property. Here, the franchise benefits public utility companies, which aren't necessarily tied to a specific parcel. So it might be an easement in gross.

Wait, but the problem also mentions that the restrictions are imposed on all future owners, and the restrictions include that no structures can be built on the strip. So the franchise right is a right of way for utilities, which is a classic easement. Since it's given to utility companies, not a specific landowner, it's an easement in gross.

But another angle: the question is about what the franchise right is an example of. The options include "easement in gross" as option G. Alternatively, it could be an equitable servitude or a restrictive covenant.

Wait, a restrictive covenant is a type of covenant that runs with the land, typically imposing a limitation. Here, the restriction is that no structures can be built on the strip, which is a negative covenant. But the franchise right itself is more of a permission to use the land for utilities.

So the franchise right is an easement in gross because it's a right given to a company (not a particular parcel) to use the land for a specific purpose. It's not a covenant but an easement.

Alternatively, could it be an equitable servitude? Equitable servitudes are used when there's a restriction on land use that's intended to benefit another parcel, but in this case, it's more about granting an easement to a utility company.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The franchise right is a grant of an easement, allowing the utility companies to use that strip. So the franchise right is the easement. Since the easement is granted to the utility company (not to a particular parcel of land), it's an easement in gross.

So looking at the options, G is "easement in gross." That seems to fit.

But wait, another thought: the franchise right is part of the restrictions in the development plan, which are enforceable against future owners. So it's a covenant that runs with the land, right? Because the restrictions bind all subsequent owners.

Ah, so perhaps the franchise right is a restrictive covenant. Wait, no. The franchise right is the easement, but the restriction that no structures can be built is a restrictive covenant.

Wait, the question is about the franchise right being an example of what. So the franchise right is an easement in gross, while the restriction is a covenant.

So the correct answer would be G: easement in gross.
</think>

The franchise right created for public utility companies along a 10-foot strip of land is best described as an easement in gross. This is because it grants a specific right to use the land for a particular purpose (ingress and egress for utilities) to a company, not to a specific parcel of land. Therefore, it fits the definition of an easement in gross.

Answer: G
