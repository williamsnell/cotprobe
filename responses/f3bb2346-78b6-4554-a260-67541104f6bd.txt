Question:

Edward's Electronics had a March 1 inventory of $42,000, with a planned inventory of $36,000 for March 31. The store plans sales for the month of $22,000, with an additional $2,000 in planned markdowns. The store already has a $6,000 commitment to purchase inventory during the month. What is the store's open-to-buy?

Options:

A: $30,000
B: $6,000
C: $14,000
D: $48,000
E: $8,000
F: $60,000
G: $18,000
H: $12,000
I: $20,000

Okay, so I've got this question about Edward's Electronics and their inventory planning. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's see. The question is asking for the store's open-to-buy. From what I remember, open-to-buy is like the amount the company is allowed to spend on purchasing inventory during a specific period, right? It's calculated based on their budget and existing commitments.

So, the given data is:

- March 1 inventory: $42,000
- Planned inventory for March 31: $36,000
- Planned sales for March: $22,000
- Planned markdowns: $2,000
- Existing commitment to purchase inventory: $6,000

Wait, I think the formula for open-to-buy is something like: Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Markdowns) - (Beginning Inventory - Ending Inventory). Or maybe it's a bit different. Let me think again.

No, wait. I think the formula is: Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Markdowns) + (Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory). Or perhaps, the open-to-buy is the amount they can purchase beyond their existing commitment. Hmm, I might be mixing things up.

Let me try to break it down. The idea is that the company needs to have enough inventory to cover sales and markdowns, but they also have a starting inventory and a target ending inventory. So, the purchases they need to make would be based on these factors.

First, let's figure out the total inventory needed for March. The total inventory needed would be the beginning inventory plus any additional purchases, minus markdowns and sales. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the equation: 

Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - (Sales + Markdowns)

So, rearranged, Purchases = Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory + Sales + Markdowns.

Wait, that sounds right. Because you start with the beginning inventory, add what you purchase, then subtract the items sold and those marked down (since markdowns reduce the value of inventory).

So, plugging in the numbers:

Purchases = Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory + Sales + Markdowns
Purchases = $36,000 - $42,000 + $22,000 + $2,000

Let me calculate that:

36,000 - 42,000 = -6,000

Then, -6,000 + 22,000 = 16,000

16,000 + 2,000 = 18,000

So, Purchases needed are $18,000. But wait, the store already has a $6,000 commitment to purchase. So, the open-to-buy would be the total purchases minus the existing commitment.

Wait, but I'm confused. Is the $6,000 part of the total purchases, or is it separate? Let me think again.

The question says the store has a $6,000 commitment to purchase during the month. So, that's already a planned purchase. So, the total purchases needed are $18,000, and they've already committed to $6,000. So, the open-to-buy would be the remaining amount they can purchase beyond that commitment.

Wait, no. Open-to-buy is the amount they are allowed to purchase beyond their existing commitments, right? Or is it the total they can spend, including the committed amount? I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it this way: The open-to-buy is the amount they can purchase without exceeding their budget, considering their sales, markdowns, and inventory levels.

Wait, another approach: The open-to-buy is calculated as the planned sales plus markdowns minus the beginning inventory plus the ending inventory. Or maybe it's the difference between what they need to spend and what they've already committed to spend.

Let me try another formula. Open-to-Buy (OTB) is usually calculated as:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Markdowns) - (Beginning Inventory - Ending Inventory)

Wait, that makes sense because:

The company starts with some inventory, sells some, marks some down, and needs to restock. So, the amount they need to restock is (Sales + Markdowns) because those reduce the inventory. But they also have a beginning inventory, and they want to end with a certain ending inventory. So, the net change in inventory is (Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory). 

So, the total inventory needed to be purchased is (Sales + Markdowns) + (Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory). Because they start with Beginning Inventory, and then they have to cover Sales and Markdowns, and also adjust for the change in inventory.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Purchases = (Sales + Markdowns) + (Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory)

So, using that:

Purchases = ($22,000 + $2,000) + ($36,000 - $42,000)
Purchases = $24,000 + (-$6,000)
Purchases = $18,000

So, the total purchases needed are $18,000. But the store has already committed to purchasing $6,000 during the month. So, the open-to-buy would be the remaining amount they can purchase, which is $18,000 - $6,000 = $12,000.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the open-to-buy includes the committed amount or is separate. Alternatively, perhaps open-to-buy is the total they can purchase, including the committed amount, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another perspective: The open-to-buy is the amount available to purchase beyond the existing commitment. So, if the total required is $18,000 and they've already committed $6,000, then the open-to-buy is $12,000.

Looking at the options, H is $12,000. So, that would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it as the difference between the inventory needed and what they have.

The beginning inventory is $42,000, ending inventory is $36,000. So, the net change is -$6,000. That means they need to purchase enough to cover sales and markdowns, but also let their inventory go down by $6,000.

So, Sales are $22,000, Markdowns $2,000. Total reduction in inventory is $24,000. But their inventory only goes down by $6,000, so they don't need to replace all of that. Therefore, the required purchases would be $24,000 (sales + markdowns) + (ending - beginning) which is -$6,000. So, 24,000 -6,000 is 18,000. So, total purchases needed are $18,000. Since they have a $6,000 commitment, the open-to-buy is $18,000 - $6,000 = $12,000.

So, the answer should be H: $12,000.

To determine Edward's Electronics' open-to-buy for March, we use the formula:

**Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Markdowns) + (Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory)**

Plugging in the values:

- Planned Sales = $22,000  
- Markdowns = $2,000  
- Ending Inventory = $36,000  
- Beginning Inventory = $42,000  

Calculations:  
1. **Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory** = $36,000 - $42,000 = -$6,000  
2. **Planned Sales + Markdowns** = $22,000 + $2,000 = $24,000  
3. **Total Purchases Needed** = $24,000 + (-$6,000) = $18,000  

The store has a $6,000 existing commitment, so the **open-to-buy** is:  
$18,000 (Total Purchases Needed) - $6,000 (Existing Commitment) = $12,000  

**Answer: H**
