Okay, so I've got this telescope problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about telescopes. I remember that telescopes usually have two lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece. The objective lens is typically a convex lens, and the eyepiece is a concave lens. But wait, wait, in this question, the focal lengths are given as 5 cm and 1 cm. Oh, right, the objective lens has a longer focal length than the eyepiece. So the 5 cm must be the objective, and the 1 cm the eyepiece.

The question is part a and part b. Let me tackle part a first. It says, what should be the distance between the lenses if the initial object and the final virtual image are both very far away. Hmm, when objects are very far away, I think that means they're at infinity. In telescopes, when the object is at infinity, the image formed by the objective lens is at its focal point, right? Because for a convex lens, when the object is at infinity, the image forms at the focal point, which is real and inverted.

So the objective lens has a focal length f1 of 5 cm. The eyepiece has a focal length f2 of 1 cm. Wait, but wait, concave lens has negative focal length? Or does the sign depend on the type? Oh, in optics, the objective lens (convex) has positive focal length, and the eyepiece (concave) has negative. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the eyepiece is a diverging lens, so its focal length is negative. So f2 would be -1 cm, not +1. Or does it depend on convention? Hmm, I might be mixing up conventions here.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. In the Gaussian lens formula, the sign conventions are such that for a converging lens (convex), the focal length is positive, and for a diverging lens (concave), it's negative. So yes, the objective is +5 cm, and the eyepiece is -1 cm. But wait, wait, sometimes in telescopes, the eyepiece is treated as a magnifier, so maybe I should be careful with the signs.

Wait, but when the object is at infinity, the image formed by the objective is at f1, which is 5 cm. Then this image acts as the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece, being a concave lens, would form a virtual image at its focal point, but since it's negative, the focal point is virtual. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that for a telescope, when the object is at infinity, the distance between the lenses (the separation) is equal to the sum of their focal lengths. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a simple two-lens telescope, the separation between the lenses is approximately equal to the sum of their focal lengths? Or is it the difference? Hmm, I think it's the sum because the objective's image is at f1, and the eyepiece's focal length is negative (since it's a diverging lens), so the total separation is f1 + |f2|. Let me confirm.

Wait, another approach: The image formed by the objective is at f1, which is 5 cm. Then, this image is at a distance of f1 = 5 cm from the objective. The eyepiece is a diverging lens, so for an object at a distance u from it, the image is formed at a distance v where 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Here, the object for the eyepiece is at u = separation between lenses - f1. Wait, no, maybe the separation is s = f1 + |f2|. Because if the image from the objective is at f1, and the eyepiece is placed such that the object is at a distance s - f1 from it. But wait, maybe I should model it more carefully.

Let me think: The objective is at position 0, and the eyepiece is at position s. The object is at infinity, so the image from the objective is at f1 (5 cm) in front of the objective. Now, the eyepiece is a concave lens with focal length f2 = -1 cm. The object for the eyepiece is at s - f1 (since the image from the objective is at 5 cm, and the eyepiece is at s cm from the objective, so the distance between the image and the eyepiece is s -5 cm). Wait, but for a concave lens, any object beyond the focal point (which is virtual) would form a virtual image on the same side. Hmm, but when the object is at infinity, the image formed by the eyepiece would be at its focal point. Wait, but for a concave lens, the focal length is negative, so the image would be at f2, which is -1 cm. But that's a virtual image on the same side as the object. So, the total separation would need to be such that the image from the eyepiece is at f2 from it.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the telescope's magnification. The magnification M is given by M = -(f1) / (f2), where f1 is positive (objective) and f2 is negative (eyepiece). So M = -(5 cm) / (-1 cm) = 5. So the magnification would be positive, meaning upright image, but I'm not sure about that right now. Let me get back to the separation.

Wait, the separation s between the two lenses in a telescope when the object is at infinity (so the image is at f1) and the eyepiece's image is at its focal point. So the separation s should be f1 + |f2|, because the eyepiece's focal length is negative. So s = 5 cm + 1 cm = 6 cm. So the distance between the lenses should be 6 cm. Looking at the options, option I is 6 cm, 5 times. So part a) would be 6 cm.

Wait, but let me think again because sometimes in some conventions, the separation is f1 - f2, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because f2 is negative, so f1 - f2 would be adding. For example, if f2 is -1 cm, then f1 - f2 = 5 - (-1) = 6 cm. So yes, that gives s = 6 cm.

So for part a), the answer is 6 cm, which is option I, but let me check the options again. The options are from A to J, and option I is 6 cm, 5 times. So that's part a) done.

Now for part b), the magnification. As I thought earlier, the magnification M is given by M = -(f1)/(f2). Since f1 is 5 cm and f2 is -1 cm, M = -(5)/(-1) = 5. Wait, but wait, the magnification is usually negative if the image is inverted, but in some cases, telescopes can have upright images. Wait, but no, in telescopes, the image is inverted because the objective forms a real image, and the eyepiece, being a diverging lens, forms a virtual image, which is inverted. So the magnification should be negative. So M = -5 times. But looking at the options, I see option I says 5 times, which is positive, but the options don't have a negative 5. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option I is 6 cm, 5 times. So maybe the magnification is positive, but that would imply an upright image, which is unusual for a telescope. Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the magnification formula for a telescope is M = -(f1)/(f2). So f1 is 5 cm, f2 is -1 cm. So M = -(5)/(-1) = 5. So positive 5, but that would mean the image is upright. But in reality, telescopes invert the image because the objective produces a real inverted image, and the eyepiece, being a diverging lens, produces a virtual image that's upright, so the overall magnification is positive. Wait, no, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, the objective is a converging lens, so when the object is at infinity, it forms a real image at f1 (5 cm), inverted. Then the eyepiece is a diverging lens; when the object is at f1 from the eyepiece, which is s - f1 = 6 cm -5 cm =1 cm. So the object is at 1 cm from the eyepiece, which is at its focal point (since the eyepiece has a focal length of -1 cm). So for a concave lens, when the object is at the focal point (u = f), the image is virtual and at infinity. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then the image wouldn't be usable. Hmm, maybe I messed up.

Wait, perhaps I should use the lens formula for the eyepiece. The eyepiece has focal length f2 = -1 cm. The object distance u for the eyepiece is s - f1, because the image from the objective is at f1, which is 5 cm, and the eyepiece is at a separation s = 6 cm. So the distance from the eyepiece to the image is s - f1 = 6 -5 =1 cm. So u =1 cm.

Now, using 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f = -1 cm, u =1 cm.

So 1/(-1) = 1/1 + 1/v => -1 = 1 + 1/v => 1/v = -2 => v = -0.5 cm.

So the image is 0.5 cm behind the eyepiece, which is a virtual image. The magnification for the eyepiece is m = v/u = (-0.5)/1 = -0.5.

Wait, but that's just the magnification from the eyepiece. The overall magnification is the product of the magnifications of the objective and the eyepiece. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire system.

Alternatively, the overall magnification M of the telescope is given by M = (f1) / (f2), where f2 is negative. So M = 5 / (-1) = -5. But that would imply an inverted image with magnification 5 times. Wait, but the options don't have -5, so perhaps the magnification is considered as positive for the purpose of the question, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but the options don't have a negative magnification in the options for part b). Let me check the options again. The options list magnification as, for example, A: -1 time, B:2 times, etc. So option I is 6 cm, 5 times. So that's a positive 5 times. But according to the calculation, the magnification is -5 times. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall magnification formula again. The magnification of a telescope when the object is at infinity is M = - (f1)/(f2), where f1 is positive and f2 is negative. So in this case, M = -(5)/(-1) = 5. So positive 5 times, implying upright image. But wait, that can't be right because telescopes usually invert the image. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the formula is M = -(f1)/(f2), and since f2 is negative, M becomes positive. So magnification is 5 times, upright. But that's contrary to what I thought earlier. So perhaps the correct answer is 5 times. So part a) is 6 cm, part b) is 5 times. So the answer would be option I.

The problem involves a telescope made of two lenses: an objective lens with a focal length of 5 cm and an eyepiece with a focal length of 1 cm. The goal is to determine the distance between the lenses and the magnification when the object and the final image are both very far away (at infinity).

### Part (a): Distance Between Lenses
When the object is at infinity:
1. The objective lens (convex, focal length \( f_1 = 5 \, \text{cm} \)) forms a real image at its focal point, 5 cm from itself.
2. The eyepiece (concave, focal length \( f_2 = -1 \, \text{cm} \)) acts as a diverging lens. The separation between the lenses (\( s \)) must ensure that the image formed by the objective lens acts as the object for the eyepiece.
3. The separation \( s \) is given by the sum of the absolute focal lengths of the objective and the eyepiece:  
   \[
   s = f_1 + |f_2| = 5 \, \text{cm} + 1 \, \text{cm} = 6 \, \text{cm}.
   \]
Thus, the distance between the lenses is **6 cm**.

### Part (b): Magnification
The magnification \( M \) of a telescope when the object is at infinity is given by:
\[
M = -\frac{f_1}{f_2}.
\]
Substituting \( f_1 = 5 \, \text{cm} \) and \( f_2 = -1 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
M = -\frac{5}{-1} = 5.
\]
The magnification is **5 times**, and the image is upright.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **I: 6 cm, 5 times**.
