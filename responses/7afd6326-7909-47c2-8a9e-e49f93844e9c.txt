Okay, so I need to figure out what collective bargaining is and why it's important to labor. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. 

Collective bargaining is a process where workers come together as a group, usually through a union, to negotiate terms of employment with their employer. It's different from individual bargaining because it's done collectively. The idea is that by having a unified voice, workers can negotiate better conditions, wages, and benefits.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's a legal dispute between employees and employers. I don't think that's right because collective bargaining is more about negotiation rather than a dispute. Disputes are usually when there's a conflict, but bargaining is a structured process to reach agreements.

Option B claims it's a system where employers seek concessions from unions. That seems backwards. While employers might try to get concessions, collective bargaining is initiated by the workers to negotiate with the employers, not the other way around. So B doesn't sound correct.

Option C describes it as a form of employment contract. No, collective bargaining is the process that leads to the contract, not the contract itself. So C is incorrect.

Option D states it's a way for workers to demand higher wages. While higher wages can be a result, collective bargaining is broader than just wage demands. It includes other terms like working conditions, benefits, and more. So D is too narrow.

Option E says it's where individual employees negotiate separately. No, collective bargaining is the opposite; it's done as a group, not individually. So E is wrong.

Option F refers to governmental intervention. I don't think that's accurate. While governments might have laws about collective bargaining, the process itself is between workers and employers, not government intervention. So F is incorrect.

Option G says it's about setting industry standards by government. That sounds more like regulations or labor laws, not collective bargaining. So G is not the answer.

Option H describes it as the approach labor organizations use to negotiate with employers. This aligns with what I know. Unions or labor organizations negotiate on behalf of workers, so H seems correct.

Option I claims it's a strategy for employers to dictate terms without negotiation. That's the opposite of collective bargaining, which is about negotiation. So I is incorrect.

Option J says it's a unilateral decision by employers. Again, that's not collective bargaining; it's more like employer-only decision making, which is the opposite of negotiation. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be H because it accurately describes collective bargaining as the process where labor organizations negotiate with employers.

The correct answer is H: Collective bargaining is the approach used by labor organizations to negotiate with employers or their representatives.

Answer: H
