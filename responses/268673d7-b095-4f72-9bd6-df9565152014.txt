Okay, so I need to figure out what the correct definition of "learning" is from the given options. Let's go through each option one by one to understand them better.

Option A says learning is a change in behavior without practice or experience. Hmm, that doesn't sound right because usually, learning involves some kind of practice or experience. If it's without those, then it's not really learning, more like instinct maybe.

Option B is an involuntary physiological response to environmental changes. That sounds more like a reflex, like how your hand pulls back from a hot stove. Learning is more about gaining knowledge or skills through experience, so B might not be the right choice.

Option C states it's a temporary change in behavior. Temporary doesn't fit with learning because learning is supposed to be lasting, right? You don't forget how to ride a bike once you've learned.

Option D says it's a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from practice or experience. This sounds familiar. I remember in psychology, learning is often defined as a lasting change in behavior based on experience. So D could be a strong candidate.

Option E is a decrease in response to repeated stimuli, which is more like habituation, a form of learning, but it's just a decrease in response, not the whole definition of learning. So E might be part of learning but not the full picture.

Option F is a periodic shift in thinking that resets every few years. That doesn't make much sense. Learning is ongoing and not something that resets periodically. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G claims learning is acquiring skills through genetics. No, that's not right. Genetic inheritance is more about traits you're born with, not skills you learn through experience.

Option H is a short-term adaptation without lasting effects. Again, learning is about lasting changes, so H doesn't fit.

Option I defines learning as memorizing facts and information. While memorization is a part of learning, it's not the entire picture. Learning includes skills, understanding, and more than just facts.

Option J suggests downloading information directly to the brain, which is more sci-fi and not the real definition of learning. So J isn't correct.

Putting it all together, the best fit seems to be Option D. It captures the idea of a lasting change in behavior due to practice or experience, which aligns with the psychological definition of learning.

The correct answer is D. Learning is best defined as a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from practice or experience.

Answer: D
