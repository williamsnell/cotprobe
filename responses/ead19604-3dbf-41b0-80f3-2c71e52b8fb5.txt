Okay, so I have this physics problem here about heat transfer between two pieces of copper. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says there are two 50 kg pieces of copper. One is at 175°C, and the other is at 40°C. They're in contact, so heat will flow from the hotter to the cooler one until they reach thermal equilibrium. I need to find the final temperature and the amount of heat transferred.

I remember that when two objects are in thermal contact and isolated from their surroundings, the heat lost by the hotter object equals the heat gained by the cooler one. So, the heat lost by the 175°C copper (q_hot) should be equal to the negative of the heat gained by the 40°C copper (q_cold). So, q_hot = -q_cold.

The formula given is q = m * C_p * ΔT. Here, m is mass, C_p is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. The C_p for copper is given as 385 J/kg·K. Both masses are the same, 50 kg each, so that might simplify things.

Let me denote the final temperature as T_f. So, the hotter piece will cool down from 175°C to T_f, and the cooler piece will warm up from 40°C to T_f.

Now, setting up the equations:

q_hot = m * C_p * (T_initial_hot - T_final)
q_cold = m * C_p * (T_final - T_initial_cold)

Since q_hot = -q_cold, I can write:

m * C_p * (175 - T_f) = m * C_p * (T_f - 40)

Wait, but since q_hot is positive (losing heat) and q_cold is negative (gaining heat), I think it's better to set them as:

m*C_p*(T_f - 40) = m*C_p*(175 - T_f)

Because the heat lost by hot is the same as the heat gained by cold. So, the equation simplifies to:

(175 - T_f) = (T_f - 40)

Wait, no, because both m and C_p are same, so they cancel out. So:

50 kg * 385 J/kg·K * (175 - T_f) = 50 kg * 385 J/kg·K * (T_f - 40)

The 50 and 385 cancel out, so:

175 - T_f = T_f - 40

Let me solve for T_f:

175 + 40 = T_f + T_f
215 = 2*T_f
T_f = 107.5°C

Wait, that's not possible because 107.5 is between 40 and 175, which makes sense. So the final temp is 107.5°C.

Now, I need to find the heat transferred. Let's calculate the heat lost by the hotter piece. q_hot = m*C_p*(175 - 107.5)

So, 50 kg * 385 J/kg·K * (175 -107.5) = 50 * 385 * 67.5

Wait, 175 -107.5 is 67.5°C, which is the same as 67.5 K change because it's a difference.

Calculating:

50 * 385 = 19,250. Then 19,250 * 67.5.

Hmm, let's compute that. 19,250 * 60 = 1,155,000. 19,250 * 7.5 = 144,375. So total is 1,155,000 + 144,375 = 1,299,375 J. Which is 1299.375 kJ. Since the hotter piece is losing heat, q_hot is positive, but the problem probably wants the heat transferred as a positive number, but sometimes the sign indicates direction. The question says 'amount of heat transferred', so maybe just the magnitude. Wait, looking at the options, the heat is given as negative. So, probably because it's heat lost from the hot piece.

Wait, but when you calculate q for the hot piece, it's positive (losing heat), and the cold piece gains heat, which would be positive as well. Wait no, because in the formula, q is the heat flow into the system. So for the hot piece, it's losing heat, so q is negative. But the problem says 'heat flow between the two pieces' is given by q = mC_pΔT. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the total heat lost by the hot piece is equal to the heat gained by the cold piece in magnitude. So the amount transferred is 1,299,375 J, which is 1299.375 kJ, approximately 1299.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option H is 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ. The negative sign probably indicates the direction of heat flow, which is from the hot to the cold piece. So the heat transferred is -1299.4 kJ, but the actual amount is 1299.4 kJ.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the amount of heat transferred between the two. So perhaps the answer is 1299.4 kJ, but since the hot piece loses that amount, the q for the hot is negative. So in the options, H is the correct one: 107.5°C and -1299.4 kJ.

The two pieces of copper exchange heat until they reach the same final temperature. Using the principle of conservation of energy, the heat lost by the hotter piece equals the heat gained by the cooler piece. The final temperature is calculated to be 107.5°C, and the heat transferred is approximately -1299.4 kJ, indicating the direction of heat flow. 

Answer: H
