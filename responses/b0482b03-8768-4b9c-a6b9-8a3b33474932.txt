Okay, so I have this question about Jaina traditions, and I need to figure out who the caityavasis were. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Jainism has different terms for different groups of people involved in the faith. There are monks, nuns, lay followers, and so on. The question is about the caityavasis, so I need to recall what that term refers to.

I think the term "caitya" might be related to a place where Jains gather, maybe like a temple or a sacred site. Wait, in some contexts, caitya can refer to a Jain temple or a hall within a temple. So if that's the case, "caityavasis" would be people who live in or around such a place.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Monks who lived in forests. I think monks often live in forests, but I'm not sure if that's specific to caityavasis.

Option B: Jain kings who patronized the faith. Kings might support Jains, but that doesn't seem directly related to the term caityavasis.

Option C: Orthodox interpreters of the scriptures. That sounds more like scholars or teachers, maybe pandits, rather than caityavasis.

Option D: Monks who performed public acts of penance. Monks do perform penances, but again, is that specific to caityavasis?

Option E: Women ascetics who lived in communities. Ascetics are people who practice severe self-discipline, but I'm not sure if they specifically live in communities as caityavasis.

Option F: Lay followers who lived in cities. Lay followers are definitely a part of Jainism, but I'm not sure if they're called caityavasis.

Option G: Temple-dwelling renouncers. Hmm, temple-dwelling makes sense because caitya relates to temples. Renouncers are people who have renounced worldly life, often monks or nuns. So maybe caityavasis are monks or nuns living in temples.

Option H: Ascetics who lived in isolation. Ascetics can live in isolation, but again, not sure if that's the same as caityavasis.

Option I: Householders who supported renouncers. Householders are laypeople who support monks, but I don't think they're called caityavasis.

Option J: Practitioners of the highest form of asceticism. The highest asceticism would be very strict, perhaps like the top monks, but maybe not specifically tied to caitya temples.

Putting this together, I think caityavasis refers to monks or nuns who live in or around the temple. So looking at the options, G says "Temple-dwelling renouncers." That fits because they're renouncers (monks/nuns) who live in temples (caitya). 

Wait, but I should double-check. In Jainism, monks and nuns often live in temporary shelters or travel, but some might stay in temples. Alternatively, maybe caityavasis are laypeople who live near temples and help maintain them. But the term "renouncer" suggests someone who has left the householder life, so likely monks or nuns. So G seems right.

The term "caityavasis" refers to temple-dwelling renouncers in Jaina traditions. These are monks or nuns who live in or around Jain temples, known as caityas, and are dedicated to their spiritual practices.
