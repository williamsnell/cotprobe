Okay, so I need to find the index of refraction for a glass with a dielectric constant of 2.5. Hmm, I remember that the index of refraction (n) is related to the dielectric constant (K), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think it's something like n squared equals K or maybe n is the square root of K. Let me think more clearly.

Wait, I recall that for non-conducting materials, the electric susceptibility (χ) is related to the dielectric constant, K, by the equation K = 1 + χ. And the index of refraction n is given by n = sqrt(1 + χ). So if K = 2.5, then χ would be K - 1, which is 1.5. Then n would be the square root of 1.5.

Calculating sqrt(1.5), I know that sqrt(1) is 1 and sqrt(1.44) is 1.2, so sqrt(1.5) should be a bit more than 1.2. Let me try calculating it. 1.2 squared is 1.44, 1.22 squared is around 1.4884, 1.24 squared is about 1.5376. Since 1.5 is between 1.4884 and 1.5376, the square root should be between 1.22 and 1.24. Maybe approximately 1.225.

Looking at the options, the closest one is F: 1.58. Wait, that's higher than what I thought. Did I make a mistake? Oh wait, no, maybe the formula is different. Another thought: perhaps the index of refraction is directly equal to the dielectric constant? That would make n=2.5, which is option C. But wait, I'm not sure. I think that's only true for certain materials or under specific conditions. More accurately, I remember that for linear isotropic materials, n = sqrt(εr), where εr is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant). So since K is 2.5, n would be sqrt(2.5).

Wait, sqrt(2.5) is about 1.581, because 1.58 squared is approximately 2.496, which is close to 2.5. So n is approximately 1.58, which corresponds to option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought K = 1 + χ and n = sqrt(1 + χ), which would mean n = sqrt(K). So yes, using K=2.5, n should be sqrt(2.5)=~1.58, so option F.

The index of refraction (n) for a material is related to its dielectric constant (K) by the formula \( n = \sqrt{K} \). Given \( K = 2.5 \), we calculate \( n = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.58 \). Among the options, the closest value is F: 1.58.

Answer: F
