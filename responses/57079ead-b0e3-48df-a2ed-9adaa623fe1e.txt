Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about calculus concepts, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one and analyze them based on what I remember from my calculus classes.

Starting with option A: "If f′(c) ≠ 0, then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c))." Hmm, wait. I think this is the other way around. If the derivative at a point is zero, that's when we might have a local extremum, like a max or min. But if f'(c) is not zero, that means the function isn't stationary there, so there can't be a local extremum at that point. So A is false.

Option B: "If f′(c) = 0, then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c))." This sounds familiar. I remember that a critical point (where derivative is zero) is a candidate for max or min, but it's not always the case. For example, the function could have a saddle point or a point of inflection there. So while it's possible, it's not a guarantee. So B is false because it's not necessarily true.

Moving on to C: "If f is differentiable at x = c, then f is continuous at x = c." I'm pretty sure this is a fundamental theorem. Differentiability implies continuity because if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be smooth enough to be continuous there. So C is true. Let me keep this in mind but check the others to be sure.

Option D: "If f(x) is discontinuous at x = c, then f might be differentiable at x = c." Wait, that doesn't make sense. If a function isn't continuous at a point, it can't be differentiable there. Differentiability requires continuity, so if it's discontinuous, the derivative doesn't exist. So D is false.

E: "If f is differentiable at x = c, then f′(c) might or might not exist." Wait, that's contradictory. If f is differentiable at c, by definition, f'(c) does exist. So saying it might or might not exist is incorrect. So E is false.

F: "If f(x) is continuous at x = c, then the graph of f has a minimum or maximum at (c, f(c))." No, continuity at a point doesn't imply anything about minima or maxima. For example, f(x) = x is continuous everywhere but has no min or max at any point. So F is false.

G: "If f(x) is continuous at x = c, then f′(c) exists." Hmm, no. Continuity is necessary but not sufficient for differentiability. Just because a function is continuous at a point doesn't mean it's differentiable there. Like |x| at x=0 is continuous but not differentiable. So G is false.

H: "If f′′(c) = 0, then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c, f(c))." I think inflection points occur where the concavity changes, which is when f''(c) = 0 and the concavity actually changes. But just f''(c)=0 isn't enough; you need to check the sign changes. So H is false.

I: "If f′(c) = 0, then f(x) is constant for all x." That's definitely not true. For example, f(x) = x^3 has f'(0)=0, but it's not a constant function. So I is false.

J: "If f′′(c) ≠ 0, then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c, f(c))." No, because f''(c) not equal to zero implies that if f''(c) changes sign, there's an inflection point. But if f''(c) doesn't change sign, it's just concave up or down, not an inflection point. So J is false.

So, after going through each option, the only one that's true is option C: If f is differentiable at x = c, then f is continuous at x = c.

The correct answer is C because differentiability implies continuity.
