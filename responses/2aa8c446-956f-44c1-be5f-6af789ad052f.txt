Question:

Using the speed of sound at sea level as approximately 750 miles per hour, what is the velocity of a jet plane traveling at Mach Number 2.2?

Options:

A: 1900 mph
B: 1750 mph
C: 1320 mph
D: 1200 mph
E: 1800 mph
F: 1650 mph
G: 1500 mph
H: 2100 mph
I: 2200 mph
J: 2000 mph

Okay, so I have this question about Mach numbers and the speed of a jet plane. Hmm, I remember that Mach number is a way to express the speed of an object relative to the speed of sound. Mach 1 is the speed of sound, Mach 2 is twice that, and so on. 

The question says that the speed of sound at sea level is approximately 750 miles per hour. So, if a jet is traveling at Mach 2.2, I need to calculate its velocity. 

Wait, right, Mach number is just the object's speed divided by the speed of sound. So the formula should be Mach = Velocity / Speed of Sound. To find the velocity, I rearrange that to Velocity = Mach Ã— Speed of Sound.

So plugging in the numbers: Mach 2.2 times 750 mph. Let me do that multiplication. 2 times 750 is 1500, and 0.2 times 750 is 150. Adding those together, 1500 + 150 equals 1650. 

Looking at the options, F is 1650 mph. So that should be the correct answer. I think I did that right. Let me double-check: 2.2 * 750. 750 times 2 is 1500, 750 * 0.2 is 150, so total 1650. Yep, that's correct.

The velocity of the jet plane at Mach 2.2 is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound (750 mph) by 2.2, resulting in 1650 mph. 

Answer: F
