Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the strongest base in liquid ammonia. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that in a given solvent, the strongest base is the one that can most effectively accept protons. In liquid ammonia, the solvent itself is NH3, so the base should be something that's a strong enough base to deprotonate another species in this environment.

I recall that the basicity of a species is related to how well it can stabilize the resulting conjugate acid. So the more stable the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. In ammonia, the solvent can act as a base by accepting a proton, forming NH4+.

Looking at the options, let's go one by one.

Option A: NH2−. That's the amide ion, which is known to be a strong base. It's commonly used in deprotonating compounds in liquid ammonia. So that's a possibility.

Option B: NH3. That's the solvent itself. It can act as a base, but I think it's weaker compared to something like NH2− because it's less likely to deprotonate another NH3 molecule.

Option C: NH+. Hmm, that's the ammonium ion. That's actually the conjugate acid of NH3. So as a base, it's not strong because it's more likely to donate a proton than accept one. So C is probably not the strongest base.

Option D: N2H4. That's hydrazine. I'm not too sure about its basicity in ammonia. Hydrazine is a weak base in water, but in ammonia, maybe it can act as a base. However, I'm not certain if it's stronger than NH2−.

Option E: N2H5. That's something like a higher hydride species. Wait, N2H5 doesn't seem right because the valency might not allow that. Maybe it's a typo, but I'm not sure. Not sure about this one.

Option F: NH4+. That's the conjugate acid of NH3. So it's a weak base, more likely to act as an acid. So F is probably not the strongest base.

Option G: NH3+. I don't think that's a common ion. Maybe it's some kind of charged species, but I'm not sure about its basicity. It might be unstable or not commonly found acting as a base in ammonia.

Option H: NH4−. Wait, that's an unusual ion. I don't think that's a standard base. More likely, that's an acid or a salt. Maybe not relevant here.

Option I: NH5+. Hmm, that seems like a high positive charge. I'm not sure if that's a real species. Maybe it's a typo or something else. Probably not a strong base.

Option J: NH2+. That's the ammonium ion with a positive charge, but wait, NH2+ is actually the ammonium ion, right? Or maybe it's another form. Wait, no, NH2+ is the ammonium ion (NH4+ minus two hydrogens?), but I'm getting confused. Wait, no, NH2+ is actually the ammonium ion, but wait, that's not right. Wait, NH4+ is the ammonium ion. So maybe J is NH2+, which is a different species. But I'm not sure about its basicity.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the species. Let me think again. 

In liquid ammonia, the solvent is NH3. The strongest base would be the one that can most easily deprotonate another molecule. The amide ion (NH2−) is a strong base because it can deprotonate NH3 to form NH2− and NH4+. So that's option A.

Other bases like NH3 itself can act as a base, but they're weaker because they don't deprotonate as readily. So the strongest base is likely NH2−, which is option A.

The strongest base in liquid ammonia is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which can effectively accept a proton to form NH₄⁺. Among the options, NH₂⁻ (Option A) is the most basic as it readily deprotonates NH₃. Other options, such as NH₃ (Option B) and NH₄⁺ (Option F), are weaker bases or even acidic. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A
