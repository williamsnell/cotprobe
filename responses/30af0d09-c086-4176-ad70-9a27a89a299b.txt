Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons being accelerated to produce X-rays. Hmm, I remember that when electrons are accelerated through a potential difference, they gain kinetic energy. The question is asking for the speed of the electrons after they're accelerated through 25,000 volts.

Wait, right, the formula I think I need is the one that relates the electric potential energy to the kinetic energy. Oh yeah, the work done by the electric field is equal to the change in kinetic energy. So, the potential energy (PE) is equal to charge times voltage, right? And since the electron starts from rest, all that energy goes into kinetic energy (KE).

So, the equation should be:
qV = (1/2)mv²

Where:
- q is the charge of the electron,
- V is the voltage,
- m is the mass of the electron,
- v is the speed we're trying to find.

Let me write down the values I know. The charge of an electron, q, is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. The voltage V is 25,000 volts. The mass of an electron, m, is about 9.109 x 10^-31 kilograms.

Plugging these into the equation:
(1.602e-19 C) * (25,000 V) = 0.5 * (9.109e-31 kg) * v²

Let me calculate the left side first. 1.602e-19 multiplied by 25,000. 25,000 is 2.5e4. So 1.602e-19 * 2.5e4 = ?

Multiplying 1.602 by 2.5 gives 4.005, and then the exponents: 10^-19 * 10^4 = 10^-15. So the left side is 4.005e-15 Joules.

Now the equation becomes:
4.005e-15 J = 0.5 * 9.109e-31 kg * v²

Let me solve for v². First, divide both sides by 0.5 * 9.109e-31.

So, v² = (4.005e-15) / (0.5 * 9.109e-31)

Calculating the denominator: 0.5 * 9.109e-31 = 4.5545e-31.

So, v² = 4.005e-15 / 4.5545e-31.

Let me compute that division. 4.005 / 4.5545 is approximately 0.879. Then, 1e-15 divided by 1e-31 is 1e16. So, 0.879e16 is 8.79e15.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. 4.005e-15 / 4.5545e-31 is (4.005 /4.5545) * 1e( -15 - (-31) )= (0.879) * 1e16 = 8.79e15.

So, v squared is 8.79e15. Then take the square root to find v.

v = sqrt(8.79e15) m²/s².

Calculating the square root: sqrt(8.79e15) = sqrt(8.79) * sqrt(1e15).

Sqrt(8.79) is approximately 2.965, and sqrt(1e15) is 1e7.5, because (1e7.5)^2 = 1e15.

Wait, 1e7.5 is equal to 10^(7.5) = 10^7 * 10^0.5 ≈ 1e7 * 3.1623 ≈ 3.1623e7.

So, 2.965 * 3.1623e7 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 3 * 3.1623e7 is about 9.4869e7, but since 2.965 is a bit less than 3, maybe around 9.36e7.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 2.965 * 3.1623 ≈ ?

2.965 *3 =8.895, 2.965 *0.1623: 0.1623*3=0.4869, 0.1623*0.965= approx 0.1565. So total is 0.4869 + 0.1565= 0.6434. So 8.895 + 0.6434≈9.5384.

So, 9.5384e7 m/s. That's approximately 95,384,000 m/s.

Looking at the options, option G is 95,000,000.0, which is close. So the answer should be G.

To determine the speed of electrons accelerated through a 25,000-volt potential difference, we use the energy conservation principle. The electric potential energy gained by the electrons is converted into kinetic energy. The equation is:

\[
qV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Where:
- \( q = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (charge of an electron),
- \( V = 25,000 \, \text{V} \),
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of an electron),
- \( v \) is the speed of the electron.

First, calculate the potential energy:
\[
qV = (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \times 25,000 = 4.005 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J}
\]

Next, solve for \( v^2 \):
\[
v^2 = \frac{2qV}{m} = \frac{2 \times 4.005 \times 10^{-15}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}} \approx 8.79 \times 10^{15}
\]

Take the square root to find \( v \):
\[
v = \sqrt{8.79 \times 10^{15}} \approx 9.5 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

This corresponds to approximately \( 95,000,000 \, \text{m/s} \), which matches option G.
