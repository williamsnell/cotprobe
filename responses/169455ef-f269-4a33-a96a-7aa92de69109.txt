Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the loss of head in a pipe. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says the pipe is 1/4 inch in diameter and 16 feet long. Water is flowing at half the critical velocity, and the critical velocity is when the Reynolds number is 2500. The viscosity is given as 1.01 centipoise, which converts to 0.679 × 10^-3 lbm/ft-sec.

Hmm, I remember that the Reynolds number (Re) is important for determining whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. The formula for Re is (v * d) / mu, where v is velocity, d is diameter, and mu is viscosity.

Since the critical velocity is at Re=2500, that's the point where flow transitions from laminar to turbulent. But here, the flow is at half the critical velocity. So I think I need to find the critical velocity first, then take half of that to get the actual velocity.

Let me calculate the critical velocity. Re = 2500 = (v_critical * d) / mu. Solving for v_critical: v = (Re * mu) / d. Wait, the diameter is 1/4 inch, which I should convert to feet because the other units are in feet and seconds. 1/4 inch is 0.25/12 feet, which is approximately 0.02083 feet.

Plugging in the numbers: Re = 2500 = (v * 0.02083) / 0.679e-3. Wait, no, mu is 0.679 × 10^-3 lbm/(ft·sec). So mu = 0.000679 lbm/(ft·sec). Let me check that again.

So for Re_critical: 2500 = (v_critical * d) / mu → v_critical = (2500 * mu) / d.

Calculating that: 2500 * 0.000679 = 1.6975. Then divide by 0.02083 (diameter in ft). 1.6975 / 0.02083 ≈ 81.44 ft/s. So the critical velocity is about 81.44 ft/s.

But the flow is at half this velocity, so v = 81.44 / 2 ≈ 40.72 ft/s.

Wait, that seems really high for water flow. Maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the units. Oh wait, viscosity is given in lbm/(ft·sec). I think the formula for Re when using these units is correct, but maybe I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 0.679e-3 is 0.000679, right? So 2500 = (v * 0.0208333) / 0.000679. Let me compute (v * 0.0208333) = 2500 * 0.000679. 2500 * 0.000679 is 1.6975. So v = 1.6975 / 0.0208333 ≈ 81.44 ft/s. Hmm, that's correct but seems high for pipe flow. Maybe it's correct because the critical velocity is where transition occurs.

Wait, but water's critical velocity might be different, but I think the problem gives Re=2500 as the critical point, so I should go with that. So v is 40.72 ft/s.

Now, I need to find the loss of head. I think the formula for head loss in a pipe is H = (f * v^2 * L) / (2g), where f is the friction factor, v is velocity, L is length, and g is acceleration due to gravity.

But wait, f depends on the Reynolds number and whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Since the flow is at half the critical velocity, which is Re=2500, but wait, if v is half of critical, then Re_actual = (v * d) / mu = (40.72 * 0.0208333) / 0.000679. Let me compute that: 40.72 * 0.0208333 ≈ 0.848. Then 0.848 / 0.000679 ≈ 1248. So Re is around 1248, which is below 2500, so it's in the laminar flow region.

Wait, but in the laminar flow region, the friction factor f is 64/Re. Because for laminar flow, f = 64 / Re. So f = 64 / 1248 ≈ 0.0513.

Okay, so now I can use the head loss formula. H = (f * v^2 * L) / (2g). Let me plug in the numbers.

v is 40.72 ft/s. L is 16 ft. g is 32.174 ft/s².

So v squared is (40.72)^2 ≈ 1658.3.

Then f * v² * L = 0.0513 * 1658.3 * 16.

Let me compute that:

0.0513 * 1658.3 ≈ 84.95. Then 84.95 *16 ≈ 1359.2.

Then divide by (2*32.174) which is 64.348.

So H ≈ 1359.2 / 64.348 ≈ 21.11 ft.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in inches and much lower. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check all units again.

Wait, the pipe diameter is 1/4 inch, which is 0.25 inches. I converted that to feet as 0.25/12 ≈ 0.0208333 ft. That's correct.

Viscosity is given as 0.679e-3 lbm/(ft·sec). That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of velocity. Let me recalculate v_critical.

Re = (v * d)/mu → v = (Re * mu)/d.

So Re=2500, mu=0.000679 lbm/(ft·sec), d=0.0208333 ft.

v = (2500 * 0.000679) / 0.0208333 = (1.6975) / 0.0208333 ≈ 81.44 ft/s.

Half of that is 40.72 ft/s. That seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm using the wrong formula for head loss. There's another formula when using the Hazen-Williams equation, but I think in this case, since we're in laminar flow, the f is 64/Re, so the formula should be correct.

Wait, but 21.11 ft loss of head seems way too high. The options are in inches, like up to 7.5 inches. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, maybe I forgot to convert the units correctly. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the head loss formula gives H in feet. So 21.11 ft is 253.32 inches. That's way off. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of f. Let me recheck.

Re_actual is 1248, so f = 64 / 1248 ≈ 0.0513. That seems right.

Wait, but if I'm getting H as 21 ft, which is impossible, maybe I did something wrong in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the head loss using the formula H = (v^2 * f * L) / (2g). Let me recalculate that.

v^2 = (40.72)^2 ≈ 1658.3 ft²/s².

f = 0.0513.

L =16 ft.

So numerator: 0.0513 * 1658.3 * 16 ≈ 0.0513 * 26532.8 ≈ 1359.2.

Denominator: 2*32.174 ≈ 64.348.

So H ≈ 1359.2 / 64.348 ≈ 21.11 ft. That's the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I made a mistake in the velocity calculation.

Wait, perhaps the critical velocity is when Re=2500, and the actual velocity is half that, so Re_actual would be 1250. Let me check that again.

Wait, if v is half of v_critical, then Re_actual = (v * d)/mu = (v_critical/2 * d)/mu = Re_critical / 2 = 1250. So Re is 1250, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use the head loss formula for laminar flow, which is H = (128 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5 * 2g). Wait, no, that's not right. The standard formula is H = (f * v² * L)/(2g), and f=64/Re for laminar flow.

Alternatively, another way to write head loss in laminar flow is H = (128 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5) * (1/(2g)).

Wait, maybe I should try that approach.

So H = (128 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5 * 2g).

Let me plug in the numbers:

mu = 0.000679 lbm/(ft·sec)

L=16 ft

v=40.72 ft/s

d=0.0208333 ft.

g=32.174 ft/s².

So H = (128 * 0.000679 * 16 * (40.72)^2) / ( (0.0208333)^5 * 2*32.174 )

Wait, this seems complicated, but let's compute step by step.

First, compute numerator: 128 * 0.000679 = 0.086792.

Then multiply by 16: 0.086792 * 16 ≈ 1.388672.

Next, multiply by v^2: v^2 is 40.72^2 ≈ 1658.3. So 1.388672 * 1658.3 ≈ 2306.1.

Denominator: (0.0208333)^5. Let's calculate that.

0.0208333^2 = 0.000434028.

^3 = 0.000434028 *0.0208333 ≈ 0.000008993.

^4 = 0.000008993 *0.0208333 ≈ 0.0000001873.

^5 ≈ 0.00000000391.

Then multiply by 2*32.174 = 64.348.

So denominator is 0.00000000391 * 64.348 ≈ 2.512e-8.

So H = 2306.1 / 2.512e-8 ≈ ?

Wait, 2306.1 divided by 2.512e-8 is a huge number. Let me compute that.

2306.1 / 2.512e-8 = 2306.1 / 0.00000002512 ≈ 9.18e13. That can't be right. I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should check the formula again. Oh wait, the formula for head loss in laminar flow is H = (128 * mu * L * v^2) / (d^5 * 2g). Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute each part more carefully.

Compute numerator: 128 * mu = 128 * 0.000679 = 0.086792.

Multiply by L: 0.086792 *16 = 1.388672.

Multiply by v^2: v^2 = (40.72)^2 ≈ 1658.3. So 1.388672 * 1658.3 ≈ 2306.1.

Denominator: d^5 = (0.0208333)^5.

Calculating (0.0208333)^5:

0.0208333^2 = 0.000434027.

^3 = 0.000434027 *0.0208333 ≈ 0.000008993.

^4 = 0.000008993 *0.0208333 ≈ 0.0000001873.

^5 ≈ 0.0000001873 *0.0208333 ≈ 0.00000000391.

Multiply by 2g: 2*32.174=64.348.

So denominator = 0.00000000391 * 64.348 ≈ 2.512e-8.

So H = 2306.1 / 2.512e-8 ≈ 9.18e11 ft. That's way off. Clearly, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is H = (f * L * v^2) / (2g * d), but I think I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, the Darcy-Weisbach equation is H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d), where f is the friction factor, L is pipe length, v is velocity, d is diameter.

Wait, no, the Darcy-Weisbach equation is H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d). Wait, no, I think it's H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d). Let me check.

Wait, actually, the correct formula is H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d), where f is dimensionless, L is length in feet, v in ft/s, etc. So let me try that.

So f = 64 / Re = 64 /1250 ≈ 0.0512.

So H = (0.0512 * 16 * (40.72)^2) / (2 *32.174 * 0.0208333).

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.0512 *16 = 0.8192.

v^2 = 40.72^2 ≈ 1658.3.

So 0.8192 *1658.3 ≈ 1359.2.

Denominator: 2*32.174=64.348.

Multiply by d=0.0208333: 64.348 *0.0208333 ≈ 1.344.

So H = 1359.2 / 1.344 ≈ 1012.3 ft. That's still way too high. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the loss of head is in inches, so maybe I messed up the unit conversions. Let me try to compute everything in inches.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't convert diameter to feet. Let me try keeping diameter in inches and adjust the units accordingly.

Wait, but viscosity is given in lbm/(ft·sec), so I need to keep units consistent. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula in terms of inches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula H in feet and then convert to inches by multiplying by 12.

Wait, let me try the Darcy-Weisbach formula again, but more carefully.

H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d).

f = 0.0512.

L=16 ft.

v=40.72 ft/s.

d=0.0208333 ft.

g=32.174 ft/s².

So numerator: f * L * v² = 0.0512 *16 * (40.72)^2.

Compute step by step:

0.0512 *16 = 0.8192.

v^2=40.72^2≈1658.3.

So 0.8192 *1658.3 ≈ 1359.2.

Denominator: 2g * d = 2*32.174 *0.0208333.

2*32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.0208333≈1.344.

So H = 1359.2 / 1.344 ≈ 1012.3 ft.

That's way too high, so I must have made a mistake in the velocity or Re calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity. Let me recheck that.

At critical velocity, Re=2500. So v_critical = (Re * mu) / d.

mu=0.000679 lbm/(ft·sec).

d=0.0208333 ft.

v_critical = (2500 * 0.000679) / 0.0208333.

Calculating numerator: 2500 * 0.000679 = 1.6975.

Divide by 0.0208333: 1.6975 / 0.0208333 ≈ 81.44 ft/s. That's correct.

So actual velocity is half of that: 40.72 ft/s.

Wait, but 40 ft/s seems very high for a 1/4 inch pipe. Maybe I'm confusing the units for viscosity. Wait, 1 centipoise is 0.001 Pa·s. But in English units, 1 Pa·s is approximately 0.208864 lbm/(ft·s). So 1 centipoise is 0.000208864 lbm/(ft·s). But the problem says viscosity is 1.01 centipoise, which is 1.01e-3 Pa·s. So converting to lbm/(ft·s): 1.01e-3 * 0.208864 ≈ 0.000211 lbm/(ft·s). But the problem says it's 0.679e-3 lbm/(ft·s), which is 0.000679. So I think I used the correct value.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the wrong formula for head loss. Maybe in this case, since it's laminar flow, the head loss can also be expressed as H = (32 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5 * g).

Wait, let me try that. So H = (32 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5 * g).

Plugging in the numbers:

mu=0.000679, L=16, v=40.72, d=0.0208333 ft, g=32.174.

So numerator:32 * 0.000679 *16 * (40.72)^2.

32 *0.000679 ≈ 0.021728.

0.021728 *16 ≈ 0.347648.

v^2=1658.3.

0.347648 *1658.3 ≈ 576.5.

Denominator: d^5 * g = (0.0208333)^5 *32.174.

As before, (0.0208333)^5 ≈ 0.00000000391.

Multiply by 32.174: 0.00000000391 *32.174 ≈ 1.258e-7.

So H = 576.5 / 1.258e-7 ≈ 4.584e9 ft. That's way too high, so I must be making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula H = (128 * mu * L * v^2) / (d^5 * g).

Wait, 128 is for a full pipe? Let me try that.

128 *0.000679=0.086792.

0.086792 *16≈1.388672.

1.388672 *1658.3≈2306.1.

Denominator: (0.0208333)^5≈0.00000000391.

0.00000000391 *32.174≈1.258e-7.

H=2306.1 /1.258e-7≈18,315,000 ft. That's impossible.

I'm clearly doing something wrong here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flow regime correctly. At Re=1250, it's in the laminar flow, so f=64/Re=0.0512.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula H = (f * L * v^2) / (2g * d), which is the Darcy-Weisbach formula.

Let me compute that again.

f=0.0512, L=16, v=40.72, d=0.0208333, g=32.174.

H= (0.0512 *16 *40.72²) / (2 *32.174 *0.0208333).

Compute numerator: 0.0512 *16=0.8192.

40.72²=1658.3.

0.8192 *1658.3≈1359.2.

Denominator: 2*32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.0208333≈1.344.

So H=1359.2 /1.344≈1012.3 ft. That's way off. The options are in inches, so maybe I messed up the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should express the head loss in inches instead of feet. Since 1 ft = 12 inches, H in inches would be 1012.3 *12 ≈ 12,147.6 inches. That's way too high.

I must have made a fundamental mistake in the approach. Let me start over.

Alternative approach: For laminar flow, H = (128 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5). Let me compute this.

mu=0.000679 lbm/(ft·s).

L=16 ft.

v=40.72 ft/s.

d=0.0208333 ft.

So H = (128 * 0.000679 *16 *40.72²) / (0.0208333^5).

Calculate numerator:

128 *0.000679=0.086792.

0.086792 *16=1.388672.

40.72²=1658.3.

1.388672 *1658.3≈2306.1.

Denominator:

0.0208333^5≈0.00000000391.

So H=2306.1 /0.00000000391≈5.897e11 ft. That's 5.897e11 ft. Which is 5.897e11 *12≈7.076e12 inches. Impossible.

I must be missing something here. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, the formula for head loss in laminar flow is H = (128 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5) * (1/(2g))?

Wait, no, the standard formula for head loss due to viscous flow (laminar) is H = (128 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5 * 2g). So perhaps I forgot to divide by 2g.

Let me try that.

H = (128 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5 * 2g).

So now, H = (128 * 0.000679 *16 *40.72²) / ( (0.0208333)^5 * 2 *32.174 ).

Compute numerator: same as before, 128 *0.000679=0.086792.

0.086792 *16=1.388672.

1.388672 *1658.3≈2306.1.

Denominator: (0.0208333)^5≈0.00000000391.

Multiply by 2 *32.174=64.348.

Denominator=0.00000000391 *64.348≈2.512e-8.

So H=2306.1 /2.512e-8≈9.18e11 ft. Still way too high.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the critical velocity formula differently.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the critical velocity is when the flow transitions, but the actual velocity is half of that, so Re=1250. So f=64/1250=0.0512.

Then using H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d).

Wait, let me compute that again.

f=0.0512.

L=16.

v=40.72.

d=0.0208333.

g=32.174.

So numerator: 0.0512 *16=0.8192.

v²=1658.3.

0.8192 *1658.3≈1359.2.

Denominator: 2 *32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.0208333≈1.344.

So H=1359.2 /1.344≈1012.3 ft. That's 1012.3 ft. That's way too high.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity. Let me check the critical velocity again.

Re=2500 = (v *d)/mu → v= (2500 * mu)/d.

mu=0.000679.

d=0.0208333.

v= (2500 *0.000679)/0.0208333 = (1.6975)/0.0208333≈81.44 ft/s.

Half of that is 40.72 ft/s. Correct.

Wait, but maybe the actual velocity is not 40.72 ft/s but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem states that the velocity is half the critical velocity, but perhaps the critical velocity is when the flow is at a certain state, but I'm using it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity as v= (Re * mu)/d, but with Re=2500 for the critical point, then half that velocity.

Wait, let me try to compute the head loss in another way. Maybe using the Manning formula or Chezy's formula, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the flow rate and then use the head loss formula.

Wait, flow rate Q = A * v, where A is the cross-sectional area.

A=π*(d/2)^2 = π*(0.0208333/2)^2 ≈ π*(0.01041665)^2 ≈ 3.318e-4 ft².

Q=3.318e-4 *40.72 ≈ 13.52e-3 ft³/s.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Hazen-Williams equation, which is H = (10.663 * (C)^2 * L * (v)^1.85) / d^4.34), but I don't have C, the roughness coefficient, and it's usually for turbulent flow. Plus, I'm not sure if that's applicable here since we're in laminar flow.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the formula for head loss in terms of the velocity and the pipe diameter without considering the exact flow regime, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the friction factor. Let me try using the correct formula for head loss in laminar flow.

For laminar flow, H = (32 * mu * L * v²) / (d^5 * g). Let me compute that.

mu=0.000679.

L=16.

v=40.72.

d=0.0208333.

g=32.174.

So H = (32 *0.000679 *16 *40.72²) / ( (0.0208333)^5 *32.174 ).

Compute numerator: 32 *0.000679=0.021728.

0.021728 *16=0.347648.

40.72²=1658.3.

0.347648 *1658.3≈576.5.

Denominator: (0.0208333)^5≈0.00000000391.

Multiply by 32.174: 0.00000000391 *32.174≈1.258e-7.

H=576.5 / 1.258e-7≈4.584e9 ft. Still way too high.

I'm clearly making a mistake somewhere. Let me think differently. Maybe I should use the pipe's diameter in inches and adjust the units accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should convert everything to inches. Let me try that.

1 ft =12 in. So L=16 ft =192 inches.

v=40.72 ft/s =40.72 *12=488.64 in/s.

d=0.25 inches.

mu=0.000679 lbm/(ft·s) =0.000679 lbm/(12 in·s) =0.000679 /12 ≈5.658e-5 lbm/(in·s).

Wait, but I'm not sure about that conversion. Maybe it's better to keep d in feet.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach: The loss of head (h) can be calculated using the formula h = (v^2 * f * L) / (2g * d), where f is the friction factor.

Given that, let me compute f =64/Re, Re=1250, so f=0.0512.

So h = (40.72^2 *0.0512 *16) / (2 *32.174 *0.0208333).

Compute numerator: 40.72^2=1658.3.

1658.3 *0.0512≈84.95.

84.95 *16≈1359.2.

Denominator: 2 *32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.0208333≈1.344.

So h=1359.2 /1.344≈1012.3 ft.

That's 1012.3 ft, which is 12,147.6 inches, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should use the head loss formula in terms of inches. Let me try to compute h in inches.

Wait, since h is in feet, to convert to inches, multiply by 12.

h =1012.3 ft *12 =12,147.6 inches. That's way beyond any of the options, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternative idea: Maybe the velocity is not 40.72 ft/s but much lower. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the actual velocity.

Wait, the problem says the flow is at half the critical velocity. Critical velocity is at Re=2500, so v_critical= (2500 * mu)/d.

mu=0.000679.

d=0.0208333 ft.

v_critical= (2500 *0.000679)/0.0208333 ≈81.44 ft/s.

Half of that is 40.72 ft/s. Correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use the formula for head loss in terms of pressure, but I don't have pressure data.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute Re again correctly.

Re = (v *d)/mu.

v=40.72 ft/s.

d=0.0208333 ft.

mu=0.000679.

So Re= (40.72 *0.0208333)/0.000679 ≈ (0.848)/0.000679 ≈1248.

So f=64/1248≈0.0513.

Then H = (0.0513 *16 *40.72²) / (2*32.174 *0.0208333).

Compute numerator:0.0513 *16=0.8208.

40.72²=1658.3.

0.8208 *1658.3≈1360.5.

Denominator:2*32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.0208333≈1.344.

So H=1360.5 /1.344≈1012.3 ft.

Same result as before. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for head loss when the flow is at the critical velocity, but that doesn't make sense because the flow is at half that.

Wait, perhaps the critical velocity is when Re=2500, and the actual velocity is half, so Re=1250, which is still laminar. So f=64/1250=0.0512.

H = (0.0512 *16 *40.72²) / (2*32.174 *0.0208333).

Same numbers: H=1012.3 ft.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach, like using the velocity head or something else.

Wait, velocity head is (v^2)/(2g). Let me compute that.

v=40.72 ft/s.

v²/(2g)= (40.72^2)/(2*32.174)=1658.3/(64.348)≈25.77 ft.

That's the velocity head. But that's just part of the head loss. The actual head loss would be higher because of friction.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that helps. Maybe I should compare it with the options. The options are up to 7.5 inches, which is about 0.625 ft. My calculation is giving me 1012 ft, which is way off. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the head loss formula in terms of the pipe's diameter in inches. Let me try that.

Convert all units to inches:

d=0.25 inches.

L=16 ft=192 inches.

v=40.72 ft/s=488.64 in/s.

mu=0.000679 lbm/(ft·s)=0.000679 lbm/(12 in·s)=0.00005658 lbm/(in·s).

g=32.174 ft/s²=386.08 in/s².

Re= (v*d)/mu = (488.64 *0.25)/0.00005658 ≈ (122.16)/0.00005658 ≈ 2,158,000. That can't be right. Wait, no, that's way higher than before, which doesn't make sense because Re should be 1250. I must have messed up the unit conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not convert units and instead use the correct formula.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for a different approach or recall that the answer is one of the options provided. Let me think about possible mistakes.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the actual velocity as 40.72 ft/s but made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the formula requires the diameter in inches, but I used it in feet. Let me try that.

If I keep d in inches, say 0.25 inches, and convert other units accordingly.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the head loss formula. Let me try to compute H in inches directly.

Wait, let me try to compute H in inches using the Darcy-Weisbach formula with all units in feet and then convert to inches.

H (ft) = (0.0512 *16 *40.72²) / (2*32.174 *0.0208333) ≈1012.3 ft.

Convert to inches: 1012.3 *12≈12,147.6 inches. That's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d), but perhaps I missed a unit conversion. Let me compute the units:

f is dimensionless.

L in ft.

v in ft/s.

d in ft.

g in ft/s².

So H will be in ft.

But I get H=1012.3 ft, which is way beyond the options. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the actual velocity is correct. Let me think again: v=40.72 ft/s.

That's 40.72 ft/s in a 1/4 inch pipe. That's extremely high, more than the speed of sound in water, which is about 4800 ft/s. Wait, no, 40 ft/s is possible, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the flow rate and see if it makes sense.

Flow rate Q = A * v = π*(0.0208333/2)^2 *40.72 ≈3.318e-4 *40.72≈0.01352 ft³/s.

That's a reasonable flow rate for such a small pipe.

But I'm still stuck on the head loss calculation. Maybe I should accept that I made a mistake and look for the correct approach.

Alternative approach: Use the formula for head loss in terms of the friction factor and the velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula H = (f * v² * L) / (2g), but without dividing by d. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula H = (f * L * v²) / (2g * d).

Wait, let me compute that again.

f=0.0512.

L=16.

v=40.72.

d=0.0208333.

g=32.174.

H = (0.0512 *16 *40.72²) / (2 *32.174 *0.0208333).

Compute numerator:0.0512 *16=0.8192.

40.72²=1658.3.

0.8192 *1658.3≈1359.2.

Denominator:2*32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.0208333≈1.344.

So H=1359.2 /1.344≈1012.3 ft.

Same result. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the head loss using the formula H = (v^2 * f * L) / (2g), but without considering the diameter, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is H = (v^2 * f * L) / (d * 2g).

Wait, that's the same as before. I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The options are A to J, with H being 4.2 in, which is around 0.35 ft.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the actual H is around 0.35 ft, which is 4.2 inches. So the answer might be H:4.2 in.

To calculate the loss of head in the pipe, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the Critical Velocity**:  
   The critical velocity corresponds to a Reynolds number \( R_e = 2500 \). Using the formula:  
   \[
   R_e = \frac{v \cdot d}{\mu}
   \]  
   where \( d = 0.02083 \, \text{ft} \) (diameter in feet), \( \mu = 0.000679 \, \text{lbm/ft·sec} \), and solving for \( v \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{critical}} = \frac{R_e \cdot \mu}{d} = \frac{2500 \cdot 0.000679}{0.02083} \approx 81.44 \, \text{ft/s}.
   \]

2. **Determine the Actual Velocity**:  
   The flow is at half the critical velocity:  
   \[
   v = \frac{v_{\text{critical}}}{2} = \frac{81.44}{2} \approx 40.72 \, \text{ft/s}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Reynolds Number for Actual Flow**:  
   Using the actual velocity, the Reynolds number is:  
   \[
   R_e = \frac{v \cdot d}{\mu} = \frac{40.72 \cdot 0.02083}{0.000679} \approx 1248.
   \]  
   Since \( R_e < 2500 \), the flow is laminar.

4. **Determine Friction Factor**:  
   For laminar flow, the friction factor \( f \) is given by:  
   \[
   f = \frac{64}{R_e} = \frac{64}{1248} \approx 0.0513.
   \]

5. **Calculate Head Loss Using Darcy-Weisbach Formula**:  
   The head loss \( H \) is calculated using:  
   \[
   H = \frac{f \cdot L \cdot v^2}{2g \cdot d},
   \]  
   where \( L = 16 \, \text{ft} \), \( g = 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), and \( d = 0.02083 \, \text{ft} \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   H = \frac{0.0513 \cdot 16 \cdot (40.72)^2}{2 \cdot 32.174 \cdot 0.02083}.
   \]  
   Numerator:  
   \[
   0.0513 \cdot 16 = 0.8208, \quad 40.72^2 = 1658.3, \quad 0.8208 \cdot 1658.3 \approx 1360.5.
   \]  
   Denominator:  
   \[
   2 \cdot 32.174 = 64.348, \quad 64.348 \cdot 0.02083 \approx 1.344.
   \]  
   Head loss:  
   \[
   H = \frac{1360.5}{1.344} \approx 1012.3 \, \text{ft}.
   \]  
   Converting to inches:  
   \[
   H = 1012.3 \cdot 12 \approx 12,147.6 \, \text{inches}.
   \]  
   This result is inconsistent with the options provided, suggesting a mistake in the approach or units.

6. **Revisiting the Options**:  
   Given the mismatch between the calculated result and the provided options, and considering the plausible range of the answer, the most reasonable choice based on the options is **H: 4.2 in**.
