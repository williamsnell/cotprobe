Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Yi Yin sacrificed to the former king, and presented the heir-king reverently before the shrine of his grandfather. . . . Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.
"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.
"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple."

Okay, so I've got this question about an excerpt from the Shu Jing, which is an ancient Chinese text. The question is about what a particular phrase tells us about the ruler. The options are A through J, each describing a different characteristic of the ruler.

First, I'll read through the provided excerpt carefully. The passage talks about Yi Yin sacrificing to the former king and presenting the heir-king before the shrine. He describes the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor to instruct the young king. There's a lot of emphasis on virtue and the actions of the former kings of Xia and Shang.

I notice that the text mentions the former kings of Xia cultivating their virtue and avoiding calamities from Heaven. It talks about the spirits of hills and rivers being in tranquility, and birds and beasts enjoying their existence. But when their descendant didn't follow, Heaven sent calamities, using their ruler who had favor. The attack on Xia is linked to orgies in Ming Tiao, which I think refers to some kind of dissipation or misconduct.

Then, the Shang king is praised for his sagely prowess and for replacing oppression with generosity and gentleness. The current king is entering the inheritance of this virtue, and the success depends on how he starts his reign. There's a warning about Heaven's ways: blessings for the good, miseries for the evil. If the king isn't virtuous, it will ruin the ancestral temple.

The key phrase the question is asking about is not directly provided, but the entire excerpt is the context. The question is about what this tells us about the ruler. So I need to analyze the ruler's characteristics from the text.

Looking at the options:

A: Weak leader. Doesn't seem right because the ruler is being advised to be virtuous, implying he has the capability to lead.

B: Killed by natural disasters. The text talks about Heaven sending calamities but doesn't say the ruler was killed by them.

C: Absolute monarch. The ruler is described as the heir-king and having the Mandate, which relates to the Mandate of Heaven, but the text doesn't explicitly say he's absolute.

D: Not of noble birth. The text mentions the Meritorious Ancestor and the Shang king, but there's no indication the ruler isn't noble.

E: Benevolent ruler. The Shang king is said to have replaced oppression with generosity and gentleness, which sounds benevolent.

F: Tyrant. Opposite of E; the Shang ruler is portrayed positively, not as a tyrant.

G: Disregarded teachings. The ruler is being instructed, so he might be following them, not disregarding.

H: Lost the gods' blessing. The Xia ruler lost favor, but the Shang ruler is favored.

I: Exiled. There's no mention of the ruler being exiled.

J: Mandate of Heaven. This is a significant concept in Chinese thought, where the ruler's legitimacy comes from Heaven. The text talks about Heaven sending calamities when virtue is lacking and favor when it's present. The Shang king is favored, so he has the Mandate.

So, the ruler is described as having the favor of Heaven, which is the Mandate of Heaven. This concept is central in Chinese political thought, where a ruler's right to rule is based on their virtue and whether they have Heaven's approval.

Therefore, the correct answer is J: He had the Mandate of Heaven.

The ruler in the excerpt is described as having the favor of Heaven, which aligns with the concept of the Mandate of Heaven. This indicates that the ruler's legitimacy and authority are justified by divine approval, contingent on their virtue and governance. 

Answer: J
