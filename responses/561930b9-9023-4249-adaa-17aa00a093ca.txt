Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing alcohol solutions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking how many gallons of a 74% alcohol liquid I need to mix with 5 gallons of a 90% alcohol solution to get a mixture that's 84% alcohol. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when mixing solutions, the total amount of alcohol before and after mixing should be the same. So, I can set up an equation based on that idea.

First, let's define the unknown. Let's say the number of gallons of the 74% solution is x. So, x gallons at 74% alcohol. The other part is 5 gallons at 90% alcohol. When I mix them, the total volume will be x + 5 gallons.

Now, the amount of pure alcohol in each solution is calculated by multiplying the volume by the concentration. So, for the first solution, it's 0.74 * x, and for the second, it's 0.90 * 5. The total alcohol in the mixture will be the sum of these two, which should equal the alcohol in the final mixture.

The final mixture is 84% alcohol, so the total alcohol is 0.84 * (x + 5). So, putting it all together, the equation would be:

0.74x + 0.90*5 = 0.84(x + 5)

Let me compute the numbers. 0.90 *5 is 4.5. So, the equation becomes:

0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84x + 0.84*5

Wait, 0.84*5 is 4.2, right? So, the equation simplifies to:

0.74x + 4.5 = 0.84x + 4.2

Hmm, now I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 0.74x from both sides to get:

4.5 = 0.10x + 4.2

Then, subtract 4.2 from both sides:

0.3 = 0.10x

Wait, that's 0.3 equals 0.10x. So, x is 0.3 divided by 0.10, which is 3. So, x is 3 gallons. Let me check the options. Option A is 3 gallons, so that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if I mix 3 gallons of 74% with 5 gallons of 90%, what's the total alcohol?

3 * 0.74 = 2.22 gallons
5 * 0.90 = 4.5 gallons
Total alcohol: 2.22 + 4.5 = 6.72 gallons

Total volume: 3 +5 =8 gallons
8 * 0.84 = 6.72 gallons. Yep, that matches. So, 3 gallons is correct. So the answer is A.

To solve the problem, we set up an equation based on the total alcohol before and after mixing. Let x be the gallons of the 74% solution. The equation is:

0.74x + 0.90(5) = 0.84(x + 5)

Simplifying, we find x = 3 gallons. Verifying, the mixture yields the correct 84% alcohol concentration.

Answer: A
