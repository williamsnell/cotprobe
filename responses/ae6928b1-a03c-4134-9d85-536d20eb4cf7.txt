Question:

An avid stamp collector had amassed a large and valuable collection. Many of his stamps were extremely rare and highly coveted. On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. "The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed "$75,000," instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?

Options:

A: The price term is $78,000, and it is unenforceable due to the secretary's mistake.
B: The price term is $75,000, and the cousin must pay an additional $3,000 due to the secretary's error.
C: The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.
D: The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.
E: The price term is $75,000, but the court may adjust the price to $78,000 if the cousin knew of the mistake.
F: The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.
G: The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.
H: The price term is $75,000, but the collector can demand the correct price of $78,000 due to the secretary's error.
I: The price term is $78,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because the collector signed the contract without noticing the mistaken price.
J: The price term is $78,000, but the court will reform the price to $75,000, because of the secretary's mistake.

Alright, so I have this question about contract law, specifically dealing with offer, acceptance, and mistakes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: There's a stamp collector who wants to sell his collection to his cousin. He dictated a letter offering to sell it for $78,000 but his secretary mistyped it as $75,000. The collector signed the letter without noticing the mistake. The cousin received the letter on December 3 and sent an acceptance on December 5.

The question is about the price term and its legal effect. The options are A through J.

I remember that in contract law, a contract is formed when there's an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Here, the offer was made by the collector, and the cousin accepted it. So the contract exists.

Now, the issue is about a unilateral mistake. The collector intended to offer $78,000 but the secretary typed $75,000. The collector didn't notice the typo and signed the letter. The cousin received the offer with $75,000 and accepted it.

So, the key here is whether this mistake affects the enforceability of the contract. I think that if one party makes a mistake in the contract terms, and the other party didn't know about it, the contract can usually be enforced as written unless it's a mutual mistake or if there's a remedy like reformation.

In this case, the mistake was made by the collector's secretary. The collector didn't know about it because he didn't notice. So it's the collector's mistake. The cousin, upon receiving the offer, didn't know about the intended $78,000; they accepted the $75,000 offer.

Under contract law, a unilateral mistake by one party doesn't generally affect the enforceability of the contract unless the mistake is material and the other party had knowledge of it or was negligent in not discovering it.

Here, the secretary's error was a unilateral mistake. The collector didn't know, and the cousin didn't know either. So the contract was formed with the price at $75,000. Now, the question is whether the price is enforceable or if the contract can be reformed.

I think that if both parties have agreed to the terms as written, and there's no mutual mistake, the contract stands. But if the mistake is unilateral and the other party didn't know, the contract is enforceable as written. However, the party who made the mistake can sometimes seek reformation of the contract to correct the error.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the price is $75,000 and it's enforceable. That sounds correct because the contract was formed with that price, and the mistake was unilateral without the other party knowing.

Option E says the court may adjust to $78,000 if the cousin knew of the mistake, but the cousin didn't know. So E isn't correct.

Option F says the court will reform to $78,000 for mistake in integration. Integration refers to the parol evidence rule, which I don't think applies here. The mistake was in the written document, but it's a unilateral mistake, so reformation is possible if the court deems it appropriate, but it's not automatic.

Option H suggests the collector can demand the correct price, but that's not standard unless the contract is reformed. Without the other party's knowledge, the collector would have to seek reformation, not just demand the higher price.

Option D says either party can rescind due to mutual mistake. But it's not mutual; only the collector made the mistake. So D is incorrect.

Option G seems to be the best choice because the contract is enforceable at $75,000. Unless the court reforms it, which requires a showing that the mistake was material and that reformation is appropriate, but the question doesn't indicate that the court would do so. The options don't suggest that the court will adjust unless certain conditions are met, like the other party knowing, which isn't the case here.

So, the price term is $75,000, and it's enforceable. The answer is G.
</think>

The contract was formed with the price term as $75,000, as that was the amount offered in the letter accepted by the cousin. The mistake was unilateral, made by the collector's secretary, and the cousin was unaware of it. Under contract law, the contract is enforceable as written unless the court reformed it, which isn't indicated here. Therefore, the price term is $75,000 and enforceable.

Answer: G
