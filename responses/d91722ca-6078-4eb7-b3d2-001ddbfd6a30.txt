Question:

Find the number of single rolls required to paper a room 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high, allowing for a 10% waste of paper. A single roll consists of 36 square feet of paper. Make allowance for openings, which include one window 3 feet by 8 feet and one door 4 feet by 9 feet.

Options:

A: 17 rolls
B: 20 rolls
C: 16 rolls
D: 23 rolls
E: 14 rolls
F: 19 rolls
G: 18 rolls
H: 21 rolls
I: 15 rolls
J: 22 rolls

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many rolls of paper I need to cover a room. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, the room dimensions are 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high. I'm assuming we're talking about papering the walls, right? So the area to cover would be the total wall area minus any areas that don't need papering, like windows and doors. 

So, the first thing I should calculate is the total area of all the walls. Since the room is a rectangular box, there are four walls. Two walls are 18 feet long and 10 feet high, and the other two are 12 feet wide and 10 feet high. 

Calculating each pair:
- For the longer walls: 2 walls * (18ft * 10ft) = 2 * 180 = 360 sq ft.
- For the shorter walls: 2 walls * (12ft * 10ft) = 2 * 120 = 240 sq ft.
Adding them together gives 360 + 240 = 600 sq ft. 

But wait, I need to subtract the areas of the window and the door because those don't need paper. The window is 3ft by 8ft, so that's 24 sq ft. The door is 4ft by 9ft, which is 36 sq ft. So total area to subtract is 24 + 36 = 60 sq ft. 

Subtracting that from the total wall area: 600 - 60 = 540 sq ft.

But there's also a 10% waste factor. So I need to add 10% of 540 to account for the waste. 10% of 540 is 54, so the total area becomes 540 + 54 = 594 sq ft.

Each roll is 36 sq ft, so to find the number of rolls needed, I divide the total area by the roll size. 594 / 36 = 16.5. But you can't have half a roll, so you'd need to round up. That would be 17 rolls. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate the wall areas:

Long walls: 2*(18*10)=360
Short walls: 2*(12*10)=240
Total: 600. Then subtract 60 for the window and door, giving 540. Then 10% waste is 54, so total 594. Divided by 36, that's 16.5, so 17 rolls. 

But looking at the options, option A is 17. So that should be the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should consider if the doors and windows are subtracted before or after the waste. Wait, the problem says to make allowance for openings first, then allow for 10% waste. So yes, I did it right by subtracting the openings first, then adding the waste. 

So yeah, the answer should be 17 rolls, which is option A.

To determine the number of rolls required, first calculate the total wall area:  
- Two walls: \(2 \times (18 \text{ ft} \times 10 \text{ ft}) = 360 \text{ sq ft}\)  
- Two walls: \(2 \times (12 \text{ ft} \times 10 \text{ ft}) = 240 \text{ sq ft}\)  
- Total wall area: \(360 + 240 = 600 \text{ sq ft}\)  

Subtract the areas of the window and door:  
- Window: \(3 \text{ ft} \times 8 \text{ ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}\)  
- Door: \(4 \text{ ft} \times 9 \text{ ft} = 36 \text{ sq ft}\)  
- Total to subtract: \(24 + 36 = 60 \text{ sq ft}\)  
- Adjusted area: \(600 - 60 = 540 \text{ sq ft}\)  

Add 10% waste:  
- Waste: \(540 \times 0.10 = 54 \text{ sq ft}\)  
- Total area including waste: \(540 + 54 = 594 \text{ sq ft}\)  

Divide by the area of one roll:  
- Rolls needed: \(594 / 36 = 16.5\), rounded up to 17 rolls.
