Question:

You want to cluster 7 points into 3 clusters using the k-Means Clustering algorithm. Suppose after the first iteration, clusters C1, C2 and C3 contain the following two-dimensional points: C1 contains the 2 points: {(0,6), (6,0)} C2 contains the 3 points: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)} C3 contains the 2 points: {(5,5), (7,7)} What are the cluster centers computed for these 3 clusters?

Options:

A: C1: (3,3), C2: (6,6), C3: (12,12)
B: C1: (6,6), C2: (12,12), C3: (12,12)
C: C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)
D: C1: (1,1), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)
E: C1: (0,0), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)
F: C1: (6,0), C2: (4,4), C3: (7,7)
G: C1: (3,3), C2: (2,2), C3: (7,7)
H: C1: (2,2), C2: (5,5), C3: (7,7)
I: C1: (0,0), C2: (48,48), C3: (35,35)
J: C1: (0,6), C2: (2,2), C3: (5,5)

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this k-Means Clustering problem. I've got 7 points that are divided into 3 clusters after the first iteration. My task is to find the cluster centers for each of these clusters. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in k-Means, the cluster center is the mean of all the points in that cluster. So for each cluster, I need to calculate the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of all the points in that cluster.

Let me list out the points in each cluster again to make sure I have them right.

Cluster C1 has two points: (0,6) and (6,0).
Cluster C2 has three points: (2,2), (4,4), (6,6).
Cluster C3 has two points: (5,5) and (7,7).

I think I should compute the mean for each cluster separately.

Starting with C1. The points are (0,6) and (6,0).

For the x-coordinates: 0 and 6. The average would be (0 + 6)/2 = 3.
For the y-coordinates: 6 and 0. The average would be (6 + 0)/2 = 3.
So the center for C1 is (3,3).

Moving on to C2. The points are (2,2), (4,4), and (6,6).

Calculating the x-coordinates: 2, 4, 6. The sum is 2+4+6 = 12. Divided by 3 gives 4.
Y-coordinates: 2,4,6. Sum is 12, divided by 3 is 4.
So C2's center is (4,4).

Now for C3. The points are (5,5) and (7,7).

X-coordinates: 5 and 7. Average is (5+7)/2 = 6.
Y-coordinates: 5 and 7. Average is 6.
So C3's center is (6,6).

Putting it all together, the centers are C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6). Now I'll check the options to see which one matches.

Looking at option C: C1 is (3,3), C2 is (4,4), C3 is (6,6). That matches exactly what I calculated. Let me make sure no other options fit.

Option F has C1 as (6,0), which isn't the mean. Option E is wrong because C1 is (0,0), which doesn't make sense. Option J has C2 as (2,2), which is incorrect. So option C is definitely the correct one.

To determine the cluster centers after the first iteration of the k-Means algorithm, we calculate the mean of the x and y coordinates for each cluster.

- **Cluster C1**: Points are (0,6) and (6,0).  
  Mean x: (0 + 6)/2 = 3  
  Mean y: (6 + 0)/2 = 3  
  Center: (3,3)

- **Cluster C2**: Points are (2,2), (4,4), and (6,6).  
  Mean x: (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4  
  Mean y: (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4  
  Center: (4,4)

- **Cluster C3**: Points are (5,5) and (7,7).  
  Mean x: (5 + 7)/2 = 6  
  Mean y: (5 + 7)/2 = 6  
  Center: (6,6)

The cluster centers are (3,3), (4,4), and (6,6), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
