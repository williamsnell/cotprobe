Question:

A driver and passenger were driving to work in the former's automobile one morning. As they were traveling at a speed of 20 m. p. h. (which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, "Look at that car upside down. " The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will

Options:

A: recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.
B: recover only a portion of damages, because both the driver and the owner of the abandoned auto were negligent.
C: recover nothing, because he was distracted while driving.
D: recover all of his damages, because the owner of the abandoned auto was negligent.
E: recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.
F: recover all of his damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard.
G: recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.
H: recover nothing, because he was driving at a speed that didn't allow him to stop in time.
I: recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.

Okay, so I've got this tort law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a driver and passenger who were driving to work. They were going at 20 mph, which is under the speed limit. Then the passenger points out an overturned car on the side of the road. The driver turns to look and, while doing so, doesn't see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire on the highway about 200 feet ahead. He crashes into the back of it and gets injured.

The jurisdiction has a comparative negligence statute, which I remember means that if both parties are at fault, their damages are apportioned based on their percentage of negligence. So, each party can be held responsible for their own share of the damages.

The question is asking what the most likely result is when the driver sues the owner of the abandoned auto. The options are from A to I, each suggesting different outcomes.

First, I need to identify the negligence elements here. Negligence requires duty, breach, causation (both cause in fact and proximate cause), and damages.

So, the owner of the abandoned vehicle probably had a duty to ensure that their vehicle wasn't a hazard on the road. If the car was parked on the highway with a flat tire, that could be considered a breach of that duty because it created a risk for other drivers.

Now, did the owner's negligence cause the driver's crash? The driver was looking at the overturned car pointed out by the passenger, which distracted him. So, the question is whether the distraction was a cause of the crash.

In terms of cause in fact, the owner's abandoned vehicle was there, and the driver crashed into it. So, that's a factual cause. But proximate cause is about foreseeability. Could the owner have foreseen that leaving the car on the highway would cause others to crash? Probably yes, because any driver might not see an obstruction in the road, especially if they're distracted.

But wait, the driver was also negligent. He was looking at the overturned car, which the passenger pointed out. So, the driver took his eyes off the road, which led to not seeing the abandoned vehicle in time.

Under comparative negligence, both parties' negligence will be compared. So, if the driver was 20% negligent and the owner was 80%, the driver would recover 80% of his damages.

Looking at the options:

A: Recover nothing because passenger's act was a supervening cause. Hmm, supervening cause would mean it breaks the chain of causation. The passenger pointing out the car was a new cause, but I don't think it's a supervening cause because the driver's act of looking was a response to it, which is foreseeable. So, probably not A.

B: Recover only a portion because both were negligent. This seems possible because comparative negligence would apply, so both are at fault. The driver was looking away, and the owner left the car there. So, the damages would be split, and the driver would get part of the damages. So B is a possibility.

C: Recover nothing because he was distracted. That's more about contributory negligence, but this is comparative negligence, so he isn't barred entirely. He just has his damages reduced. So C is probably incorrect.

D: Recover all because owner was negligent. But the driver was also negligent, so he can't recover all. So D is wrong.

E: Recover only a portion because the car was in plain view. The visibility might be a factor, but the main issue is both parties' negligence. So E might not be the best choice.

F: Recover all because it was a traffic hazard. Again, the driver's own negligence plays a role, so he can't recover all. So F is incorrect.

G: Recover all because a dangerous condition was created. Similar to F, the driver's own actions contributed, so G is likely wrong.

H: Recover nothing because speed didn't allow stopping. The driver was under the speed limit, so his speed was legal. Plus, the issue is distraction, not speed. So H doesn't seem right.

I: Recover nothing because had last clear chance. This refers to when the defendant had the last clear chance to prevent the injury but failed. Here, the owner left the car, and the driver had the last chance to avoid it. But in comparative negligence, even if the plaintiff was negligent, they can still recover, just reduced. So I think I is incorrect because it's more about contributory negligence, which isn't the case here.

So, the best answer is B: recover only a portion because both were negligent. The driver was looking away, but the owner's negligence in leaving the car on the highway also contributed.
</think>

The most likely result is that the driver will recover only a portion of his damages because both the driver and the owner of the abandoned auto were negligent. Under the jurisdiction's comparative negligence statute, the driver's recovery will be reduced based on his own percentage of fault, which in this case was caused by his distraction. 

Answer: B
