Okay, so I've got this question about the reserve ratio and money creation. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that the reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks must keep as reserves. The rest can be lent out. When a bank gets a deposit, they can only lend out a portion based on this ratio. 

The question says the reserve ratio is 10%, so that means the bank has to keep 10% of any deposit as reserves. The new customer deposits $500. So first, I think the bank keeps 10% of that, which is $50, right? Because 10% of 500 is 50. That leaves $450 that the bank can lend out. 

But wait, how does this lead to money creation? Oh right, when the bank lends out money, those loans get spent and deposited again in other banks, which then also keep a portion as reserves and lend out the rest. This process continues, creating more money in the economy.

The formula for the maximum money created is the deposit divided by the reserve ratio. So here, the deposit is $500, and the reserve ratio is 10% or 0.1. So 500 divided by 0.1 equals $5,000. That makes sense because each time the money is lent, it's multiplied by the inverse of the reserve ratio.

Wait, let me double-check. The initial deposit is $500. The bank keeps $50, lends $450. Then, that $450 gets deposited elsewhere, so the next bank keeps 10% of that, which is $45, and lends out $405. This continues, each time reducing the amount by 10% and adding the rest to the money supply. So the total money created is the sum of all these lendable amounts plus the initial deposit?

Wait, no, actually, the formula is that the total money created is the initial deposit multiplied by 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So 500 * (1/0.1) = 500 * 10 = 5000. Yeah, that's correct. So the maximum amount of money created would be $5,000.

Looking at the options, option A is $5,000. So I think the answer is A.

The reserve ratio is 10%, meaning the bank must keep 10% of deposits as reserves. When a customer deposits $500, the bank keeps $50 and can lend out $450. This lending process repeats, creating more money. The formula for maximum money created is the initial deposit divided by the reserve ratio: $500 / 0.1 = $5,000.
