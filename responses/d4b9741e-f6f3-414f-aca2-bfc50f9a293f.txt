Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about message confidentiality. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about what the transmitted message must make sense to only the intended. So, message confidentiality is about ensuring that only the intended recipient can understand the message, right? That makes sense because if it's confidential, others shouldn't be able to read it.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the right one. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Network Provider. Well, the network provider is the company that carries the data, like your internet service provider. But they handle the transmission, not the decryption. Do they need to understand the message? Probably not, because encryption should prevent them from knowing the content. So maybe not A.

Option B: Relay station. That's like a device that passes along signals, maybe in a cellular network. Again, it's just a middleman for the signal, not the intended receiver. So probably not B.

Option C: Receiver. Oh, that makes sense. The receiver is the intended party who should be able to read the message. So if the message is encrypted, only the receiver with the correct decryption key can understand it. That seems right.

Option D: Sender. Wait, the sender sends the message, so they should know what they sent. But confidentiality is about the receiver being the only one who can read it, not the sender. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: Interceptor. That's someone who intercepts the message, like an eavesdropper. But in confidentiality, we want to prevent interceptors from understanding the message. So E is not the intended.

Option F: Translator. Not sure what that is. Maybe someone who translates languages? Doesn't fit here. Probably irrelevant.

Option G: Router. Routers direct data packets, but they don't process the content. So they shouldn't understand the message, so G is out.

Option H: Third-party eavesdropper. Similar to E, this is someone listening in. We don't want them to make sense of the message, so H is not the intended.

Option I: Modulor. I'm not sure what a modulor is. Maybe a typo for something else, but I don't think it's relevant here.

Option J: Decoder. A decoder is a tool or device, not a person. The message should make sense to the intended person, not just any decoder. So J isn't the right choice.

So putting it all together, message confidentiality ensures that only the intended receiver can understand the message. Therefore, the correct answer should be C: Receiver.

The transmitted message must make sense only to the intended receiver to ensure confidentiality. The correct answer is C.

Answer: C
