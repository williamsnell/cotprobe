Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically involving an offer and acceptance. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Calvin Poultry Co. offering to sell Chickenshop 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound with specified delivery terms. Then Chickenshop accepted the offer with a slight twist: they accepted but added a condition about the city scale weight certificate. I need to figure out what this means in terms of contract formation.

First, I remember that in contract law, acceptance must be absolute and unqualified to form a valid contract. If the acceptance includes any modifications or conditions, it might be considered a counteroffer or a conditional acceptance, which would not form a binding contract.

So Calvin's offer is clear: 20,000 pounds at 40 cents per pound, with certain delivery terms. Chickenshop's response says they accept but mention "per city scale weight certificate." I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it seems like they're adding a condition about how the weight is measured. Maybe they want the weight certified by the city, which could affect the payment or delivery.

Now, if Chickenshop's acceptance includes a condition or adds a term, this could be a counteroffer. Because when the acceptor adds something to the offer, it's not just an acceptance anymore; it's a new proposal, which means no contract was formed. Instead, it's a counteroffer, and the original offeror (Calvin) would have to accept this new terms for a contract to exist.

Looking at the options:

A: Counteroffer, no contract. This seems possible because Chickenshop added a term.

B: Contract formed but terms need clarification. Not sure, but I think if there's an addition, it's not just terms needing clarification but a counteroffer.

C: Rejection and no contract. No, because they accepted, just with a condition.

D: Acceptance but terms subject to change. No, because if it's a condition, it's not just subject to change but a modification.

E: Conditional acceptance, not a counteroffer. Hmm, maybe. But conditional acceptance might still be a counteroffer if it's a material change.

F: Contract formed but not binding. Unlikely, because if it's a counteroffer, there's no contract yet.

G: Contract on Chickenshop's terms. No, because their terms weren't accepted.

H: Breach of contract. No, because no contract was formed yet.

I: Contract formed but terms negotiable. No, because again, if it's a counteroffer, no contract exists.

So the key is whether Chickenshop's reply is an acceptance or a counteroffer. Since they added a condition (city scale weight certificate), it's a modification, which makes it a counteroffer. Therefore, no contract was formed yet. So the correct answer should be A: a counteroffer, no contract.

The correct answer is that Chickenshop's reply constitutes a counteroffer, meaning no contract was formed.
