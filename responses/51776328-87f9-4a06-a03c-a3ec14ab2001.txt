Okay, so I need to figure out which FORTRAN function correctly computes the Poisson distribution given by the formula P(X) = e^(-m) * m^X / X! where X and m are integers. The question gives me multiple options, labeled A through J, and I have to pick the right one.

First, I'll start by understanding the formula. The Poisson probability is the product of three parts: e raised to the negative m (e^-m), m raised to the power of X (m^X), and then divided by the factorial of X (X!). So the function P should compute each of these parts correctly.

Looking at the options, each is a FORTRAN function with different expressions. I'll go through each option to see which matches the formula.

Option A:
FUNCTION P(X,M) INTEGER X
Y = FLOAT(M)
P = EXP(M) * M ** X / FACT(X)
RETURN
END

Hmm, wait. The formula has e^-m, but this option uses EXP(M), which is e^m. That's incorrect because it's positive instead of negative. So A is wrong.

Option B:
FUNCTION P(X,M) INTEGER X, M
P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X)
RETURN
END

This looks promising. EXP(-M) is e^-m, M**X is m^X, and divided by FACT(X) which is X!. So B seems correct, but I'll check others to be sure.

Option C:
P = EXP(-M) / (M ** X * FACT(X))

Wait, that's e^-m divided by (m^X * X!), which is the same as e^-m * (1/(m^X * X!)). But the correct formula is e^-m multiplied by m^X and divided by X!. So C is actually e^-m / (m^X X!) which is wrong. So C is incorrect.

Option D:
Y = FLOAT(M)
P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X)

Here, Y is M converted to float. But since M is an integer, and in FORTRAN, using it as an exponent with ** might require it to be a real number. However, M**X is the same as Y**X if Y is M converted. But wait, in the formula, it's m^X. So using M**X is correct because M is integer. But why convert M to Y? Maybe because EXP expects a real number. Wait, no, EXP in FORTRAN takes a real argument. So M is integer, so when you pass it to EXP(-M), it's okay because M is an integer, and in FORTRAN, integer can be used in math functions which implicitly convert to real. So perhaps this is unnecessary. But the main issue is that the formula in D is EXP(-Y) * M^X / X!, but Y is M, so it's same as B. Wait, but in D, M is integer, so M**X is okay. So why is D different from B? Because in B, it's M as integer, and D converts M to Y, which is same as M. So functionally, D and B are the same, but B doesn't convert M to Y. So which is correct? Well, both compute the same value, but the code in B is more straightforward. So why would D be an option? Maybe because it's trying to use Y as a float, but M is integer. Wait, but in the formula, m is a real number? Or is m an integer? The question says m is an integer variable. So m is integer, but when you raise it to X, which is also integer, it's okay. So D seems correct as well, but I'm confused because B also looks correct.

Wait, let me think again. The function in B doesn't convert M to Y, but uses M directly. But in the Poisson formula, m is an integer, but when you compute m^X, it's an integer, but when multiplied by e^-m, which is a real number, the result is real. So in FORTRAN, as long as M is treated as a real when needed, it's fine. But in B, M is integer, but when used in M**X, it's treated as integer, but when passed to EXP(-M), M is treated as integer. Wait, no: in FORTRAN, if M is integer, then -M is integer, but EXP expects a real argument. So perhaps M should be converted to real before using in EXP. Because if M is, say, 5, then EXP(-5) is correct, but if M is a large integer, but the question says m is small enough. So perhaps in B, using M directly is correct.

Wait, but in B, M is integer, and when used in EXP(-M), it's treated as real. Because in FORTRAN, when you pass an integer to a function expecting real, it's implicitly converted. So B's code should be correct.

But in D, Y is FLOAT(M), which is same as M as real. So in D, the code is P = EXP(-Y) * M**X / FACT(X). But Y is M as real, so EXP(-Y) is same as EXP(-M). M**X is same as Y**X only if X is positive, which it is. But M is integer, so M**X is integer, but when multiplied by EXP(-Y), which is real, it becomes real. So D's code is correct as well. So why are both B and D options?

Wait, but looking back, the question specifies that X and m are integer variables, and that terms won't exceed real variable size. So for the exponent, m is integer, but when used in EXP(-m), it's okay because it's converted to real.

So both B and D compute the same value. But wait, in D, M is used as M**X, which is integer, but in B, M is used as M**X, same thing. So why are both options present?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X)

Option D: P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X), where Y is FLOAT(M).

But in terms of computation, EXP(-M) when M is integer is same as EXP(-Y) because Y is M as real. So both B and D compute the same P. But why would both be options? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in FORTRAN, when M is integer, M**X is computed as integer, which could cause integer overflow if M and X are large, but the question says terms won't exceed real variable size, so it's okay.

Wait, but in the formula, the denominator is X!, which is an integer, but when divided into a real number (from e^-m * m^x), the result is real. So the function P should return a real number. But in the options, some functions declare P as real, others not.

Looking at the options:

Option B: The function P is being assigned a real value, but in FORTRAN, if P is not declared as real, it's integer. So if the function returns an integer, but the calculation is a real, that would be wrong. Wait, but in the options, the function P is an implicit real? Or is it an integer?

Wait, in FORTRAN, variables that are not declared are considered as integer. So in option B, P is not declared as real, which would cause it to be integer. But the formula requires a real number. So that would be wrong. Oh, but wait, the function is a function returning a real value, right? Because it's used as a probability, which must be a real. So the function should have a real return type.

Looking back at the options, some functions have 'REAL X' or 'INTEGER X'.

Wait, let me read the function definitions again.

Option B starts with FUNCTION P(X,M) INTEGER X, M. So X and M are integers. The return value of the function is not explicitly stated, but in FORTRAN, the return type defaults to real if the expression is real. So in option B, the expression is EXP(-M) * M**X / FACT(X). EXP returns a real, M is integer, so M**X is integer, but when multiplied by a real (EXP returns real), the result is real. Then divided by FACT(X), which is integer but when divided by a real, the result is real. So the function P in B would return a real value. But in FORTRAN, unless the function is declared as REAL, it defaults to integer. Wait, no, in FORTRAN, a function's return type is determined by the data type of the return statement. So if the return statement is P = something real, then the function returns real. So in option B, since P is assigned a real value, the function returns real.

Wait, but in FORTRAN, functions can be declared with an explicit type. For example, REAL FUNCTION P(...) would return real. But in the options, some functions don't declare the return type, implying it's integer. So if the function returns a real value but is declared as integer, it's wrong.

Wait, looking at option B: the function is written as FUNCTION P(X,M) INTEGER X, M. So the function's return type is not specified, which in FORTRAN defaults to integer. But the calculation is a real number, which would cause a type mismatch. So option B is incorrect because it returns an integer, but the Poisson probability is a real number.

Ah, that's a crucial point I missed earlier. So option B is wrong because it returns an integer, but P should be a real.

Wait, but in the options, some functions have 'REAL X' or 'INTEGER X'. For example, option D starts with INTEGER X, Y = FLOAT(M), etc.

Wait, perhaps the function's return type is determined by the variables. Let me think again.

In FORTRAN, the default return type for a function is real if the expression is real, else integer. So in option B, since the expression is real, the function returns real. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the function's type is determined by the data type of the result in the return statement. So if the return statement is P = something real, then the function returns real.

But in any case, perhaps the more correct approach is to look for the correct formula regardless of the return type, assuming that the function is correctly declared elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the key issue is the formula: whether it correctly implements e^-m * m^x / x!.

Looking at option D again: Y is FLOAT(M), so Y is m as real. Then P = EXP(-Y) * M^X / FACT(X). But M^X is integer, and when multiplied by EXP(-Y) (real), it becomes real. Divided by FACT(X) (integer), which is same as multiplying by 1/FACT(X), which is real. So the formula is correct.

But wait, in D, M is integer and Y is M converted to real. So M^X is integer, but in the formula, it's m^X where m is integer. So M^X is correct. So the formula in D is correct.

But in option B, the formula is also correct in terms of the mathematical expression. But the problem is with the function's return type. However, if the function is declared as REAL, then it's correct. But in option B, the function is declared as INTEGER X, M. The function's return type isn't specified, so it defaults to real if the expression is real. Wait, no, in FORTRAN, the function's return type is determined by the data type of the variable it's assigned to. So if P is declared as real, the function returns real. But in option B, P is not declared as real; the function's return type is not specified, leading to it being integer, which is incorrect for the Poisson probability.

So perhaps the correct option is D, because it converts M to Y as a real, ensuring that EXP(-Y) is correctly computed as e^-m, and then M^X is integer, but when multiplied by a real, it becomes real. Then divided by FACT(X), which is integer, but the division makes it real. So the function returns real, which is correct.

Wait, but in option D, the function is declared as INTEGER X, so X is integer, but Y is FLOAT(M). So the function's return type is determined by the expression. Since all operations result in real, the function returns real, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is in option B, but it's wrong because it returns integer. So the correct option must be D.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says that X and m are integer variables, and that the function uses the available function FACT(n) for n! So the main points are:

1. The formula must be e^-m * m^X / X!.
2. The function must compute this correctly.

Looking at option B:

P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X)

This is correct in terms of the formula. But as I thought earlier, the function's return type is integer, which is wrong. Unless the function is declared as real, which in the option it's not.

In option D:

Y = FLOAT(M)
P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X / FACT(X)

This is also correct in terms of the formula, and since Y is real, EXP(-Y) is correct. The function's return type would be real, which is correct.

But wait, what about option G?

Option G:
FUNCTION P(X,M) REAL X Y = FLOAT(M) P = EXP(-Y) * Y ** X RETURN END

Wait, this is P = e^-y * y^x. But the formula requires e^-m * m^x / x! So option G is missing the division by x! So G is incorrect.

Option J:
P = EXP(-Y) * M / X / FACT(X)

This is e^-y * M/(X * FACT(X)). That's not the same as e^-m * m^x / x! So J is wrong.

Looking back, the correct formula is in option B and D, but with the issue of return type.

Wait, what about option I?

Option I:
P = EXP(-Y) / (M ** X * FACT(X))

Which is e^-y divided by (m^x * x!), which is the inverse of the correct formula. So I is wrong.

Option E:
P = EXP(Y) * M ** X / FACT(X)

That's e^y * m^x / x!, which is wrong.

Option F:
P = EXP(Y) / (M ** X / FACT(X))

Which is e^y divided by (m^x /x!) which is e^y * x! / m^x. Not correct.

Option H:
P = EXP(-Y) * M ** X * FACT(X)

That's e^-y * m^x * x!, which is the opposite of the correct formula.

So the only options that have the correct numerator and denominator are B and D.

But B uses M as integer in EXP(-M), which is acceptable because M is integer, but in FORTRAN, when passed to EXP, it's converted to real. So EXP(-M) is correct.

But the issue is the return type. So in option B, the function's return type is integer, which is wrong. But in option D, the function's return type is real, which is correct.

Wait, but in option B, the function's return type is not specified as real, so it defaults to integer. That's incorrect because the Poisson probability is a real number.

So the correct option is D because it correctly uses Y as a real for the exponential, and the formula is correct with real return type.

Wait, but in option D, M is used as integer in M**X. So M is integer, and X is integer, so M**X is integer. Then, when multiplied by EXP(-Y), which is real, the result is real. Then divided by FACT(X), which is integer, but the division makes it real. So the formula is correct.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought B was correct, but realized that the function's return type would be integer, which is wrong. So D is better because it ensures that Y is real, and the function returns real.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct if the function is declared as real, but in the option, it's not.

Wait, the option B function is written as:

FUNCTION P(X,M) INTEGER X, M
P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X)
RETURN
END

In this case, the function's return type is not specified, so default is integer. But the calculation is a real number, which would cause the function to return a real value, but the function is declared as integer. That's a type mismatch error. So option B is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is D, which correctly uses Y as a real for the exponential, and the formula is correct, and the function returns real.
</think>

The correct FORTRAN function must compute the Poisson probability formula \( P(X) = e^{-m} \cdot m^X / X! \). The analysis of each option reveals that:

- **Option B** correctly implements the formula but fails because the function's return type defaults to integer, which is incorrect for a probability (a real number).
- **Option D** correctly implements the formula and ensures the return type is real by converting \( M \) to a real variable \( Y \) for the exponential calculation, making it the correct choice.
