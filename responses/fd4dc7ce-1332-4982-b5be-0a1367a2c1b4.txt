Okay, so I've got this question about cystic fibrosis incidence rates in different populations and when they mate. Hmm, I remember that cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder, specifically an autosomal recessive disease. That means you need two copies of the defective gene to show the disease, right? If only one copy, you're a carrier but don't get the disease.

The question says that in Caucasians, the incidence is about 1 in 2,000 births, and among nonwhites, it's 1 in 250,000. So first, I need to figure out the rate when a Caucasian mates with a non-Caucasian. Then, if their offspring mates randomly, what's the new incidence?

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I need to find the carrier frequencies first. Because incidence is the probability of being born with the disease, which is q² for a recessive disease, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele.

So for Caucasians: incidence is 1/2000, which is the disease rate (q²). So q for Caucasians would be sqrt(1/2000). Let me compute that. 1/2000 is 0.0005. The square root of 0.0005 is approximately 0.02236, so about 2.236%.

For non-Caucasians: incidence is 1/250,000, which is 0.000004. So q² is 0.000004. Taking square root, q is sqrt(0.000004) = 0.002, which is 0.2%.

Now, when a Caucasian (q=0.02236) mates with a non-Caucasian (q=0.002), what's the chance their child has the disease? Well, each parent can contribute either a normal allele (Q) or the recessive (q). Since the disease is recessive, the child needs two q's to have the disease.

Wait, but the parents are from different populations. So the father is Caucasian, so his alleles are Q and q (with q=0.02236), and the mother is non-Caucasian, so her alleles are Q and q (with q=0.002).

Wait, no, actually, each parent has two alleles. But when mated, the child gets one allele from each parent. So the possible combinations for the child's genotype are:

- Q (from Caucasian parent) and Q (from non-Caucasian)
- Q (C) and q (NC)
- q (C) and Q (NC)
- q (C) and q (NC)

But the disease occurs only if both alleles are q. So the probability of the child having the disease is the probability that both parents contribute a q.

So for the Caucasian parent, the chance of passing q is 0.02236, and for the non-Caucasian parent, it's 0.002. So the probability the child has CF is (0.02236) * (0.002) = 0.00004472, which is approximately 0.004472%, or 1 in about 22,373 births. Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The probability that each parent is a carrier. Wait no, wait: wait, the incidence is the actual occurrence of the disease, so the q is the frequency of the recessive allele in each population.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the probability that each parent is a carrier, but wait no, the parents are from different populations, so the allele frequencies are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the cross between a Caucasian and a non-Caucasian, and we're to calculate the probability that their child has CF.

Wait, but in reality, each parent can only contribute one allele. So the father, being Caucasian, has a q of 0.02236, and the mother, as non-Caucasian, q=0.002. So the child would have CF only if both parents give a q. So 0.02236 * 0.002 = 0.00004472, which is 4.472e-5, so 1 in 22,373. Hmm, but looking at the options, option I says 1 in 22,000 and then 1 in 6,700. That's close to 22k. So perhaps the first part is 1 in 22k.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation. 0.02236 is approximately 1/44.75 (since 1/44.75 ≈ 0.02236). And 0.002 is 1/500. So multiplying 1/44.75 * 1/500 = 1/(44.75 *500) ≈ 1/22,375. So yes, 1 in about 22,375, which is roughly 1 in 22,000. So the first part of the answer would be approximately 1 in 22,000, which is option I's first part.

Now for the second part: if these offspring mate randomly, what's the incidence? So the new generation's q would be the average of the parents' q's, but wait, no, each individual's q is either from the parents. Alternatively, perhaps all the offspring are carriers or affected?

Wait, the children of Caucasian and non-Caucasian parents would have a certain q frequency in the population. Let me think: if the incidence in the first cross is 1 in 22,375, then the frequency of q in the offspring would be the probability that a child is a carrier plus twice the probability of being affected (since each affected has two q's). Wait, no, actually, the frequency of the q allele in the population would be the sum of the alleles contributed by each child.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the allele frequency in the new population after the first cross, then compute the incidence when they mate randomly.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simpler. The first part is the incidence rate when a Caucasian (q=0.02236) mates with a non-Caucasian (q=0.002). So the incidence is 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele. Wait, no, wait: for a child to have CF, they need two recessive alleles. So the probability is q_Cauchy * q_nonCaucasian.

Wait, no, each parent passes one allele. So the child's genotype is determined by one allele from each parent. So the chance the child has CF is (q_Cauchy) * (q_nonCaucasian) = 0.02236 * 0.002 = 0.00004472, which is 1 in about 22,375, so approximately 1 in 22,000. So the first part is 1 in 22,000, which matches option I's first part.

Now, the second part: if these offspring mate randomly, what is the incidence? So we're assuming that the next generation is formed by these mixed offspring mating randomly. So first, we need to find the allele frequency in this new group.

The initial cross produces children who are either carriers or affected. The frequency of the q allele in the new population would be the average of the q's from each parent. Wait, no, actually, each child has one allele from each parent. So the frequency of q in the new population would be the average of the q frequencies of the parents. But wait, the parents are the children from the first cross, so their q frequency would be the same as the rate at which q occurs in them.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's assume that all children from the first cross (Caucasian x non-Caucasian) are now part of a population that will mate randomly. So the allele frequency q in this new population would be the average of the q's of the parents, but each parent is from the first cross. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the first cross produces a population where each individual has a certain q frequency. Let me think: each child from the first cross has a 0.02236 chance of getting a q from the Caucasian parent and a 0.002 chance from the non-Caucasian parent. So each child has a 0.02236 + 0.002 = 0.02436 chance of having a q allele? Wait, no, that's not right. Because each child gets one allele from each parent, so the probability that a child has a q allele is the probability of getting q from either parent. So it's the sum of the probabilities of getting q from each parent, but without double-counting the cases where both are q.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to calculate the allele frequency in the offspring. The frequency of q in the offspring would be the sum of the q's contributed by each parent. For each child, the chance they have a q from the Caucasian parent is 0.02236, and from the non-Caucasian parent is 0.002. So the total q frequency in the offspring is (0.02236 + 0.002) / 2 = (0.02436)/2 = 0.01218. Wait, that can't be right, because each child gets one allele from each parent, so the total q in the population would be the average of the two parents' q frequencies. But the parents are from different populations, so their q's are different.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the allele frequency in the offspring. Each child has a 0.02236 chance of getting q from the Caucasian parent and a 0.002 chance from the non-Caucasian parent. So for each child, the probability of having a q allele is (0.02236 + 0.002) / 2, because each parent contributes one allele. Wait, no, that's not correct. Each child gets one allele from each parent, so the total number of q alleles per child is either 0, 1, or 2.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as a Hardy-Weinberg scenario. The parents are from two different populations with different q frequencies. When they mate, the offspring's q frequency is a combination. So the overall q frequency in the next generation would be the average of the parents' q frequencies, assuming equal numbers of each parent type.

Wait, but in this case, all matings are between a Caucasian and a non-Caucasian, so the new population's q frequency would be the average of the two parents' q frequencies.

Wait, so q_new = (q_Caucasian + q_nonCaucasian)/2 = (0.02236 + 0.002)/2 = 0.01218. So q_new is approximately 0.01218.

Then, the incidence of CF in this new population, which is q_new squared, would be (0.01218)^2 ≈ 0.0001483, which is about 1 in 6,746 births. Wait, because 1/0.0001483 ≈ 6,746. So the incidence would be approximately 1 in 6,700, which matches the second part of option I.

So putting it together, the incidence when a Caucasian and non-Caucasian mate is about 1 in 22,000, and when their offspring mate randomly, the incidence becomes about 1 in 6,700. So the correct option is I: 1 in 22,000; 1 in 6,700.
</think>

To determine the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) when a Caucasian mates with a non-Caucasian and when their offspring mate randomly, we use the principles of Mendelian genetics and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

### Step 1: Calculate allele frequencies
- **Caucasian population**: The incidence of CF is 1 in 2,000, so \( q^2 = \frac{1}{2000} = 0.0005 \). Solving for \( q \), the frequency of the recessive allele, gives \( q = \sqrt{0.0005} \approx 0.02236 \) (or 2.236%).
- **Non-Caucasian population**: The incidence of CF is 1 in 250,000, so \( q^2 = \frac{1}{250,000} = 0.000004 \). Solving for \( q \) gives \( q = \sqrt{0.000004} = 0.002 \) (or 0.2%).

### Step 2: Incidence in offspring of a Caucasian and non-Caucasian mating
When a Caucasian (\( q = 0.02236 \)) mates with a non-Caucasian (\( q = 0.002 \)), the child will have CF only if both parents contribute the recessive allele \( q \). The probability of this happening is:

\[
\text{Probability of CF} = q_{\text{Caucasian}} \times q_{\text{non-Caucasian}} = 0.02236 \times 0.002 = 0.00004472
\]

This corresponds to an incidence of approximately \( 1 \) in \( \frac{1}{0.00004472} \approx 22,375 \), or roughly \( 1 \) in \( 22,000 \).

### Step 3: Incidence when offspring mate randomly
If the offspring of Caucasian and non-Caucasian matings form a new population that mates randomly, the frequency of the recessive allele \( q \) in this population is the average of the allele frequencies of the two parent populations:

\[
q_{\text{new}} = \frac{q_{\text{Caucasian}} + q_{\text{non-Caucasian}}}{2} = \frac{0.02236 + 0.002}{2} = 0.01218
\]

The incidence of CF in this new population is then:

\[
q_{\text{new}}^2 = (0.01218)^2 \approx 0.0001483
\]

This corresponds to an incidence of approximately \( 1 \) in \( \frac{1}{0.0001483} \approx 6,746 \), or roughly \( 1 \) in \( 6,700 \).

### Final Answer
The incidence of CF in offspring of Caucasian and non-Caucasian matings is approximately \( 1 \) in \( 22,000 \), and if these offspring mate randomly, the incidence becomes approximately \( 1 \) in \( 6,700 \).
