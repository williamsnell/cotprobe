Okay, so I have this question about interest rates, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking: What rate of interest would produce $12 on $1,200 in 90 days? The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated using simple interest formula. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest (in decimal form), and t is the time in years.

Wait, so the time here is 90 days. I need to convert that into years because the interest rate is usually annual. There are 360 days in a year for these calculations, I think. So 90 days would be 90/360 = 0.25 years.

The principal P is $1,200, and the interest I is $12. I need to find the rate r.

So plugging into the formula: 12 = 1200 * r * 0.25.

Let me compute that. First, 1200 multiplied by 0.25 is 300. So the equation becomes 12 = 300 * r.

To solve for r, I divide both sides by 300. So r = 12 / 300.

Calculating that, 12 divided by 300 is 0.04. To express that as a percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives 4%.

Looking at the options, J is 4%, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the time conversion. Sometimes, people use 365 days instead of 360, but in finance, especially for short periods like 90 days, 360 is common. So 90/360 is definitely 0.25.

Another way to check: if the rate was 4%, then for a year, the interest would be 1200 * 0.04 = $48. But since it's only 90 days, which is a quarter of the year, the interest would be 48 / 4 = $12. That matches the given interest, so yes, 4% is correct.

The correct rate is 4%, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
