Okay, so I have this question about vegans and vitamin B12 deficiency. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about vitamin B12 and vegans.

Vitamin B12 is essential for the body, right? It's involved in nerve function, blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. The main sources of B12 are animal products like meat, fish, dairy, and eggs. So vegans, who don't eat any animal products, might have a higher risk of deficiency.

Now, the question is asking what proportion of vegans is likely to be deficient. The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 3% to 85%. I need to figure out which one is correct.

I remember reading that B12 is produced by bacteria and is typically found in animal foods. Since vegans avoid these, they might not get enough unless they take supplements or fortified foods. But how many vegans actually become deficient?

I think some studies have shown that a significant portion of vegans are deficient. Like, maybe around 20-80%? Wait, no, that's a big range. Let me try to narrow it down.

I've heard that without supplementation, many vegans end up deficient. Maybe around 66%? That's one of the options. Or perhaps higher. I recall reading that up to 80% of vegans are deficient, but that's not one of the options. The closest is D:85%, but that seems high.

Alternatively, maybe it's about 1 in 3 vegans, which would be 33%, but that's not an option either. Wait, the options include J:32%, which is close. But I'm not sure if it's exactly 33%.

Another angle: some sources say that after a few years of a vegan diet without B12, deficiency is more likely. But what's the average? I think it's more than 30%, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I remember a study that found around 40% of vegans are deficient, but that's not an option. The options don't have 40, so maybe I'm thinking of a different number. Alternatively, maybe the correct figure is around 66%, which is option A. Or perhaps the proportion is higher.

I also recall that some experts suggest that a significant majority, maybe 50% or more, are deficient. Let me think about what I've read. Oh, I think the number is around 66%, so option A.

Wait, but another thought: some sources say that without supplementation, about 75% of vegans are deficient. That's option F. Hmm, that's a possibility. I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.

Alternatively, maybe it's lower. Some say that with proper education about fortified foods or supplements, the deficiency rate can be lower, but many vegans might not be aware. So perhaps the rate is higher than 50%.

Wait, I think the correct answer is around 66%, so option A. But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: maybe it's about 85%, which is D. But that seems too high. I think the more accurate figure is around two-thirds, which is 66%.

The question asks about the proportion of vegans likely to be deficient in vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, which vegans avoid, increasing their risk of deficiency. Studies suggest that a significant portion of vegans are deficient if they don't supplement their diet. After considering various sources and figures, the most plausible answer is that approximately two-thirds of vegans are likely deficient.

Answer: A
