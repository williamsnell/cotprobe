The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
You are the United States,
you are the future invader
of the native America that has Indian blood,
that still prays to Jesus Christ and still speaks Spanish.
. . .
you are Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar.
You think that life is fire,
that progress is eruption,
that wherever you shoot
you hit the future.
No.
. . .
But our America, that has had poets
since the ancient times of Netzahualcoyotl,
. . .
that consulted the stars, that knew Atlantis
whose resounding name comes to us from Plato,
that since the remote times of its life
has lived on light, on fire, on perfume, on love,
America of the great Montezuma, of the Inca,
the fragrant America of Christopher Columbus,
Catholic America, Spanish America,
the America in which noble Cuauhtémoc said:
"I'm not in a bed of roses", that America
that trembles in hurricanes and lives on love,
it lives, you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul.
And it dreams. And it loves, and it vibrates, and it is the daughter of the sun.
Be careful. Viva Spanish America!
There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion.
Roosevelt, one would have to be, through God himself,
the-fearful rifleman and strong hunter,
to manage to grab us in your iron claws.
And, although you count on everything, you lack one thing: God!

Okay, so I've got this question about a poem by Ruben Dario, "To Roosevelt," and I need to figure out what events might have inspired him to write it. The poem seems to be addressed to Theodore Roosevelt, and it's pretty intense. Let me break it down.

First, the poem refers to the U.S. as an invader of "native America" with Indian blood, still praying to Jesus and speaking Spanish. That makes me think it's about the U.S. expanding into Spanish-speaking regions, probably in Latin America. The imagery is strong—calling the U.S. "Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar" suggests a powerful, perhaps conquering figure. The poet warns that the U.S. might underestimate the strength and resilience of Spanish America, mentioning figures like Montezuma and Columbus, and invoking a sense of pride and resistance.

Now, looking at the options, I need to think about events around 1904 when the poem was written. Let me go through each option:

A: U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution. That was in the late 18th-early 19th century. By 1904, the U.S. had some involvement, but I'm not sure if that's the main prompt here. The poem seems more focused on Latin America's response to U.S. expansion.

B: Panama’s independence. Panama was part of Colombia, and the U.S. supported its independence to build the Panama Canal. This happened around 1903, so that's close in time. The poem's warning about the U.S. might relate to this intervention.

C: Mexican Revolution. That started in 1910, a bit after 1904, so maybe not the prompt for this poem. Plus, the poem seems to be more about general U.S. expansion rather than specific to Mexico.

D: Embargo of Cuba after Castro’s revolution. That's way later, 1950s-60s. Not relevant here.

E: Annexation of Texas. That was in the 1840s. By 1904, it was a done deal, but perhaps the poem reflects ongoing tensions, but I'm not sure if that's the prompt.

F: Monroe Doctrine. Established in 1823, so that's way before. The poem is more about specific contemporary events, not a historical policy.

G: Discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram. That was during WWI, 1917. Not relevant to 1904.

H: Louisiana Purchase. In 1803, so way earlier. Again, not the prompt.

So narrowing down, the most likely events around 1904 would be U.S. involvement in Panama, possibly the construction of the Panama Canal, which the U.S. began in 1904. The poem warns against the U.S. trying to control or dominate, which fits with the idea of the U.S. intervening in Panama. Alternatively, it could be about the general U.S. imperialism and expansion in the early 20th century, but the Panama Canal project was a big deal around that time.

Another angle is that the poem was published in 1904, so it's likely responding to recent U.S. actions. The Panama Canal was a major project, so the U.S. might have been seen as overreaching, prompting Dario to warn against such interventions.

So, considering all this, I think the prompt is most likely the U.S. involvement in Panama's independence, which was happening around that time.

The poem reflects concerns about U.S. expansion and imperialism in Latin America. Given the context and the timeframe of 1904, the U.S. involvement in Panama, particularly the support for Panama's independence from Colombia to facilitate the construction of the Panama Canal, was a significant event. This intervention likely prompted the poet to warn against the U.S. overreach and the impact on Spanish America.
