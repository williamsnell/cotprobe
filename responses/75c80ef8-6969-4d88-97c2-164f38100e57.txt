Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an astronaut landing on a planet, and I'm supposed to figure out how much he'll weigh there. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says the planet has twice the mass and twice the radius of Earth. The astronaut's weight on Earth is 800 N. I need to find his weight on this new planet.

Hmm, I remember that weight is calculated using the formula W = m * g, where m is mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But on different planets, the gravity changes based on the planet's mass and radius. Oh right, the formula for gravitational acceleration is g = G * (M / R²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the planet's mass, and R is its radius.

So, on Earth, the astronaut's mass can be found by dividing his weight by Earth's gravity. Let's call Earth's gravity g_earth. So m = W_earth / g_earth. But wait, I don't actually need to calculate the mass because I can compare the gravity of the two planets.

The new planet has mass M_new = 2M_earth and radius R_new = 2R_earth. So, plugging into the gravity formula, g_new = G * (2M_earth) / (2R_earth)². Let me compute that denominator: (2R_earth)^2 is 4R_earth². So g_new = (2G M_earth) / (4 R_earth²) = (2/4) * (G M_earth / R_earth²) ) = (1/2) g_earth.

Wait, so the gravity on the new planet is half of Earth's gravity. Because doubling the mass would increase gravity, but doubling the radius would decrease it by the square, so 2/(2^2)=2/4=0.5. So overall, the gravity is half.

So if the astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, where g is 9.8 m/s², his mass is 800 / 9.8 ≈ 81.63 kg. But on the new planet, the gravity is half, so his weight would be mass times (g_earth / 2). So W_new = m * (g_earth / 2) = (800 N) * (1/2) = 400 N.

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, since the gravity is halved, the weight should be half of 800 N, which is 400 N. So looking at the options, option F is 400 N. That makes sense.

I think that's right. So the answer should be F: 400 N.

The astronaut's weight on the new planet is half of his Earth weight, so 400 N.

Answer: F
