Okay, so I've got this question about voting behavior in the United States, and I need to figure out which statement doesn't accurately describe it. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says that registered voters between 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than those under 21. I remember that generally, older voters tend to have higher turnout rates. Younger people, especially those under 21, might not be as engaged, so A seems accurate.

Option B claims that a registered voter with a GED is less likely to vote than a high school dropout. Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. I thought that having some education, even a GED, might correlate with higher civic engagement. Maybe high school dropouts, who didn't finish school, might have lower voting rates. So B might not be accurate. I'll keep that in mind.

Option C states that registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than primary elections. That makes sense because general elections are for higher offices (like president) and usually have higher stakes, so more people turn out. primaries are often for selecting party candidates and can have lower turnout, especially if the race isn't very contested. So C is probably correct.

Option D says more women have voted in every presidential election since 1980. I think that's true. I've heard that women's voter turnout has been higher than men's in recent decades. So D is likely accurate.

So, focusing back on B. If a person has a GED, they've completed high school equivalency, which might suggest they have the education necessary for civic participation. High school dropouts, without that, might be less likely to vote. So B's statement seems reversed. It should be that the GED holder is more likely to vote than a dropout. Therefore, B is the incorrect statement.
