Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about goods, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: "These goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk." The options are A through J, each representing a different type of good.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are different classifications of goods, like staple, specialty, luxury, etc. Let me try to break down each part of the question.

First, the goods are bought infrequently. That means people don't purchase them very often. So I'm thinking about what types of goods fit that. For example, things like appliances or furniture are bought infrequently because they last a long time.

Next, they are used repeatedly. So these are items that people use many times over. Durable goods come to mind because they have a long lifespan and are used repeatedly. Non-durable goods, on the other hand, are used up quickly, like food or toiletries.

The third point is high consumer risk. High risk usually means that the purchase is significant, either in cost or the potential for dissatisfaction. Think about things like major appliances, home electronics, or big-ticket items. People are more cautious about these purchases because they're expensive or because the product's performance could have a big impact on their satisfaction.

Let me go through each option:

A: Staple goods. These are everyday items that people buy regularly, like groceries. Doesn't fit because they're bought frequently.

B: Specialty goods. These are unique or differentiated products for which consumers are willing to make a special effort to purchase. They might be bought infrequently, but I'm not sure about the other points.

C: Luxury goods. These are high-end items that people don't buy often, but they might be used once or as a special item. However, the question mentions "used repeatedly," which might not fit luxury goods as they might be more for display or occasional use.

D: Perishable goods. These are items that spoil quickly, like food. Theyâ€™re bought frequently and not used repeatedly, so probably not.

E: Impulse goods. These are purchased on the spot without much thought, like candy. Bought frequently, so no.

F: Durable goods. These are long-lasting and can be used many times. They're often bought infrequently because they last a long time. Also, purchasing them can involve high risk because they're expensive and the decision is significant. This seems to fit all three points.

G: Non-durable goods. These are short-term, like paper towels. Bought frequently and not used repeatedly, so no.

H: Services. These are intangible and can vary, but the question is about goods, not services, so probably not.

I: Unsought goods. These are items that people don't know they need until they're reminded, like insurance. They might be bought infrequently, but I'm not sure about the other points.

J: Complementary goods. These are items used together with others, like a printer and ink. They might be bought when needed, but not necessarily infrequently or with high risk.

Putting it all together, durable goods fit all three criteria: bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve high consumer risk. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: Durable goods.

F: Durable goods.
