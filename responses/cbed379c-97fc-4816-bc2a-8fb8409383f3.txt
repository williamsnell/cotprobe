Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question asking which of the options is not in Nevada. Let me think through each option one by one. I'm not super familiar with all the places, but I'll try my best.

Option A: Liberace Museum. I remember hearing that Liberace was a famous entertainer, and I think his museum is in Las Vegas, which is in Nevada. So A is in Nevada.

Option B: Pikes Peak. Hmm, I'm not sure where Pikes Peak is. I think Pikes Peak is associated with the song "America the Beautiful," which mentions its purple mountains. Wait, isn't Pikes Peak in Colorado? Yeah, that's right. So B is not in Nevada. That might be the answer, but let me check the others to be sure.

Option C: Hoover Dam. I'm pretty sure the Hoover Dam is on the border of Nevada and Arizona. It's a big dam on the Colorado River, so it's definitely in Nevada. So C is in Nevada.

Option D: Death Valley National Park. I know Death Valley is a national park, and I think it's in California. But wait, isn't part of it in Nevada too? Or maybe it's entirely in California? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Death Valley is actually the hottest and lowest place in North America, and I believe it's mostly in California, with a small part in Nevada. So D is in Nevada, but maybe that's not the case. Hmm, I might need to double-check that. Wait, no, I think Death Valley is mainly in California, with a small portion in Nevada. So D is in Nevada but maybe not entirely. But the question is about being in Nevada, so if any part is in Nevada, then it's in Nevada. So D is in Nevada.

Option E: Lake Mead. Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the U.S., right? I think it's on the Colorado River, near Las Vegas, so definitely in Nevada. So E is in Nevada.

Option F: Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. I've heard of Red Rock Canyon; it's known for its red rock formations and is a popular outdoor activity spot. I believe it's located west of Las Vegas, so that's in Nevada. So F is in Nevada.

Option G: Fremont Street Experience. Fremont Street is in downtown Las Vegas, famous for its lights and the casinos. So G is in Nevada.

Option H: Mount Charleston. Mount Charleston is a mountain range in Nevada, I think near Las Vegas. So H is in Nevada.

So, going back, the options are A through H. The only one that's not in Nevada is B: Pikes Peak, which is in Colorado. The others are all in Nevada. So the answer should be B.

The answer is B because Pikes Peak is in Colorado, not Nevada.
