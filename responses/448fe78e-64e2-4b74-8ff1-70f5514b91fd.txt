<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electrical engineering, but I'll try to work through it carefully.

So, the question is about a generator with specific parameters, and we need to find the number of pole-face conductors in each pole of a compensating winding. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, let's list out the given data:

- The generator is a 2,500-kW, 600-volt, 16-pole machine.
- It has a lap-wound armature with 2,360 conductors.
- The pole faces cover 65% of the entire circumference.

The question is asking for the number of pole-face conductors per pole in the compensating winding. Hmm, I remember that compensating windings are used in generators to reduce armature reaction effects, especially in large machines. They are usually placed in the pole faces and connected in series with the armature.

Wait, so I think the key here is to find how many conductors are placed in each pole's face area. Since it's a lap-wound armature, the armature conductors are connected in parallel, but I'm not sure if that affects the compensating winding directly.

I recall that in a generator, the number of conductors per pole (in the armature) can be calculated using the formula:

Number of conductors per pole, Z_p = (Total conductors) / (P * A)

Where P is the number of poles, and A is the number of parallel paths. Wait, but for a lap winding, A equals P. So in this case, A = 16. So Z_p = 2360 / (16 * 16)? Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the armature has 2,360 conductors. For a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles P. So A = P = 16. So the number of conductors per pole, Z_p, is total conductors divided by (P * A). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, in a lap winding, each conductor in parallel paths is part of the same pole. So the number of conductors per pole would be total conductors divided by the number of poles. Because each pole has a certain number of conductors in its armature. Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the concepts here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the number of conductors per pole in the armature first. Let me try that.

The total number of conductors in the armature is 2360. Since it's a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles P, which is 16. So each pole has a certain number of conductors.

Wait, but in a lap winding, each pole has Z_p conductors, and the total conductors Z = Z_p * A. So Z_p = Z / A. So Z_p = 2360 / 16 = 147.5. Hmm, that's a fractional number, which doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me check again. The formula for the number of conductors per pole in a lap winding is Z_p = Z / (A). Since A is the number of parallel paths, which in lap winding is equal to the number of poles P. So Z_p = 2360 / 16 = 147.5. But you can't have half a conductor. That suggests perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the armature's conductors per pole. Let me think again: in a lap winding, each pole has A conductors, since A is the number of parallel paths, which equals the number of poles. Wait, no, perhaps each pole has multiple conductors. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of conductors per pole in the armature as Z_p = Z / P. So 2360 /16 = 147.5. But that's not possible. Hmm. Maybe the question isn't directly about the armature's conductors but about the compensating winding.

Wait, the question is about the compensating winding. So perhaps the compensating winding has a certain number of conductors per pole. I think the compensating winding is usually placed in the pole face and connected in series with the armature. But how many conductors does each pole have in the compensating winding?

I remember that the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is given by Zc = (Total conductors in compensating winding) / P. But I don't know the total number of compensating conductors. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can find it another way.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking about the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding based on the coverage of the pole faces. The pole faces cover 65% of the entire circumference. So perhaps the number of conductors per pole is 65% of the total number of conductors per pole in the armature.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is a fixed percentage of the total conductors per pole in the armature. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is determined by the coverage percentage. So if pole faces cover 65% of the circumference, perhaps that translates to 65% of the conductors per pole being in the pole face.

Wait, but the question is about the compensating winding, not the armature. Wait, perhaps the total number of conductors in the compensating winding is a certain percentage of the armature's conductors. Or maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is given by the formula:

Zc = (Total conductors in compensating winding) / P.

But I don't know the total. Maybe I can calculate it based on the armature's parameters.

Wait, perhaps the compensating winding's total conductors are the same as the armature's conductors, but that doesn't make sense because the armature is the main winding.

Alternatively, maybe the compensating winding has a certain number of conductors per pole, say Zc, and the total conductors in the compensating winding would be Zc * P.

But without more data, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is equal to the number of armature conductors per pole multiplied by the coverage percentage. So Zc = Z_p * (coverage percentage).

Wait, but earlier we had Z_p as 147.5, which can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage percentage affects how many conductors are placed in the pole faces.

Wait, the coverage is 65%, so perhaps the number of conductors in the pole face per pole is 65% of the total conductors per pole. So if the armature has Z_p conductors per pole, then the compensating winding would have 0.65 * Z_p conductors per pole.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.

1. Calculate the number of conductors per pole in the armature (Z_p).

Since it's a lap wound armature, Z_p = Z / P = 2360 / 16 = 147.5. But that's a fractional number, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the formula I'm using is incorrect. Another approach: in a lap winding, the number of conductors per pole (Z_p) is equal to the total number of conductors divided by the number of poles. So Z_p = 2360 /16 = 147.5. Hmm, that's the same result. But you can't have half a conductor. So perhaps the problem uses a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the armature is 2360 / (16 * 2) = 73.75. Wait, why 2? Because each pole has two brushes or something? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing up delta and lap windings.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in a lap winding is Z_p = Z / (P * A), where A is the number of parallel paths. But in a lap winding, A = P, so Z_p = Z / (P^2). So 2360 / (16^2) = 2360 / 256 ≈ 9.22. That doesn't seem right either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the compensating winding. The compensating winding is usually placed in the pole faces and is connected in series with the armature. The number of conductors in the compensating winding is usually a fraction of the armature's conductors.

Wait, but the question specifies that the pole faces cover 65% of the entire circumference. So perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is 65% of the total conductors per pole in the armature.

Wait, but earlier I couldn't get a whole number for armature conductors per pole. Maybe I should proceed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is calculated by taking the total number of conductors in the compensating winding and dividing by the number of poles. But I don't know the total.

Wait, maybe the compensating winding has the same number of conductors per pole as the armature. But that can't be right because the armature has more conductors.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is a small number, like 5 or 10, which matches the options given.

Wait, the options are from 3 to 14. So perhaps the answer is around 5 or 6. Let me think.

Another approach: The number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding (Zc) can be calculated as Zc = (Total number of armature conductors) * (Coverage percentage) / (Number of poles). Wait, is that right?

Wait, coverage percentage is 65%, so 0.65.

So Zc = (2360) * 0.65 / 16.

Let's calculate that: 2360 * 0.65 = 1534. Then 1534 /16 ≈ 95.875. That's way too high. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coverage. Maybe the coverage percentage refers to the area each pole face occupies relative to the total armature. So perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is 65% of the number of armature conductors per pole.

So Zc = 0.65 * Z_p.

But earlier, Z_p was 147.5, so 0.65 * 147.5 ≈ 96. That's way higher than the options given. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the coverage percentage is used differently. Perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is 65% of the total number of conductors in the armature. Wait, 65% of 2360 is 1534. Then per pole it's 1534 /16 ≈ 95.875. Again, too high.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is given by the formula:

Zc = (Z_armature) * (Coverage percentage) / (Number of poles).

So Zc = 2360 * 0.65 /16.

As before, that's 1534 /16 ≈ 95.875. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage percentage is 65%, meaning that 65% of the conductors are in the pole face. So the number of pole-face conductors per pole is 65% of the total conductors. So Zc = 0.65 * 2360 = 1534. Then per pole, 1534 /16 ≈ 95.875. Again, same result.

But the options are much lower, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of conductors per pole in the pole face area, not the total. So maybe it's the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding, which is a small number.

Wait, in practice, the compensating winding per pole might have a few conductors, like 5 or 6. Looking at the options, D is 5, H is 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is calculated as (Total conductors) * (Coverage percentage) / (Number of poles). Let's try that again.

2360 * 0.65 = 1534. Then 1534 /16 ≈95.875. No, that's too high.

Wait, maybe the coverage percentage is per pole. So each pole's face covers 65% of the circumference. So the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding would be 65% of the total conductors per pole in the armature.

But earlier, Z_p was 147.5, so 65% is about 96. Still too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is simply the total conductors multiplied by the coverage percentage, divided by the number of poles.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the compensating winding has a different number of conductors, say, 5 per pole. But how?

Wait, another approach: The compensating winding is usually a small number of conductors per pole. Maybe it's 5. Let me look at the options. Option D is 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is calculated as (Total number of conductors) * (Coverage percentage) / (Number of poles). But that gives a high number. Maybe I should divide by something else.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is the same as the number of parallel paths in the armature. Since the armature is lap wound, A = P =16. So perhaps the compensating winding has 16 conductors per pole. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options don't include 16, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of pole-face conductors is the number of armature conductors per pole multiplied by the coverage percentage.

So Zc = Z_p * 0.65.

If Z_p is 147.5, then Zc = 147.5 * 0.65 ≈96. Again, too high.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another formula or approach.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is given by:

Zc = (Total armature conductors) * (Coverage percentage) / (Number of poles).

So Zc = 2360 * 0.65 /16 ≈95.875. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage percentage is not applied to the total conductors, but to the number per pole.

Zc = Z_p * 0.65 = 147.5 * 0.65 ≈96. Still too high.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about standard practice.

In large generators, the compensating winding is placed in the pole face and is usually a small number of conductors per pole. So the options given are all small numbers. So perhaps the correct answer is 5 or 6.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. The number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is usually given by:

Zc = (Z_armature) * (C) / (P)

Where C is the coverage percentage. So:

Zc = 2360 * 0.65 /16 ≈95.875. Not matching.

But that's too high. So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's Zc = (Z_armature) * (C) / (P * 2), because each pole has two sides or something.

So Zc = 2360 * 0.65 / (16 *2) ≈2360 *0.65=1534; 1534/32≈47.9375. Still too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage percentage is per pole. So each pole's face covers 65% of the total circumference, so the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is 65% of the total conductors per pole in the armature.

Wait, but armature conductors per pole is Z_p =2360 /16=147.5. 65% of that is 96. Still too high.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is determined by the formula:

Zc = (Z_armature) * (C) / (P * A)

Where A is the number of parallel paths. But A=16, so:

Zc=2360 *0.65/(16*16)=2360*0.65=1534; 1534/(256)=≈6.007. Oh! That's approximately 6. So the number would be 6 conductors per pole.

Looking at the options, H is 6. So the answer would be H:6 conductors.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me check the steps again.

Zc = (Z_armature * C) / (P * A)

Since A=P=16,

Zc = (2360 * 0.65) / (16*16) = 1534 / 256 ≈6.007. So approximately 6 conductors per pole.

Yes, that seems to fit. So the correct answer would be H:6 conductors.
</think>

To determine the number of pole-face conductors in each pole of a compensating winding for the given generator, the following steps are taken:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Total power rating: 2,500 kW
   - Voltage: 600 V
   - Number of poles (P): 16
   - Total conductors in the armature (Z): 2,360
   - Pole-face coverage: 65% of the circumference.

2. **Objective**:
   Calculate the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding (Zc).

3. **Approach**:
   The compensating winding is placed in the pole faces and is connected in series with the armature. The number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding can be calculated using the formula:

   \[
   Z_c = \frac{Z \times \text{Coverage Percentage}}{P \times A}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( Z \) = Total number of armature conductors = 2,360
   - \( P \) = Number of poles = 16
   - \( A \) = Number of parallel paths in the armature. For a lap-wound armature, \( A = P = 16 \).
   - Coverage Percentage = 65% = 0.65.

4. **Calculation**:
   Substituting the values into the formula:

   \[
   Z_c = \frac{2360 \times 0.65}{16 \times 16} = \frac{1534}{256} \approx 6.007
   \]

   Rounding to the nearest whole number, \( Z_c \approx 6 \) conductors per pole.

5. **Conclusion**:
   The number of pole-face conductors in each pole of the compensating winding is **6**.
