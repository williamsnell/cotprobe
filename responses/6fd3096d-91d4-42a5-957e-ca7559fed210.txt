Okay, so I've got this problem here about photometers and candle intensities. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my photometry, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says there's a standard 48-candle lamp placed 36 inches from a photometer screen. Another lamp with an unknown intensity is placed 45 inches away and produces the same illuminance on the screen. I need to find the unknown lamp's luminous intensity.

Wait, I remember that illuminance (which is measured in lux) depends on the luminous intensity of the source and the distance from it. The formula I think is E = I / (d^2), where E is illuminance, I is intensity in candles, and d is the distance in meters or feet? Wait, but the units here are inches. Hmm, maybe I should convert them to feet or just keep consistent units.

Wait, the formula is actually E = I * (1/d²), right? Or maybe E = I * (1/d²), since illuminance decreases with the square of the distance. Oh right, because it's an inverse square law. So the farther away you are, the less light you get.

So if both lamps produce the same illuminance on the screen, their E values are equal. So I can set up the equation: I₁ / d₁² = I₂ / d₂². Because E1 = E2, so I1/(d1²) = I2/(d2²).

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The formula is E = I / (4πd²), but when comparing two different setups, the 4π would cancel out because it's the same for both. So I can just say I1/d1² = I2/d2².

Wait, no, maybe it's E = I / (d²), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it written as E = (I) / (4πd²), but I think for this problem, since we're comparing two lamps at different distances, the 4π would cancel out when taking the ratio. So maybe I can ignore it for this purpose.

So, the setup is: I1 is 48 candles, d1 is 36 inches. I2 is what we're trying to find, d2 is 45 inches.

So, setting up the equation: I1 / d1² = I2 / d2².

Plugging the numbers in: 48 / (36)^2 = I2 / (45)^2.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate 36 squared and 45 squared.

36^2 = 36 * 36. Let's see, 30*30=900, 6*30=180, 30*6=180, and 6*6=36. So 900 + 180 + 180 + 36 = 1296.

45^2 is 45*45. 40*40=1600, 40*5=200, 5*40=200, 5*5=25. So 1600 + 200 + 200 +25 = 2025? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 45^2 is 2025, yes.

So, 48 / 1296 = I2 / 2025.

Let me compute 48 divided by 1296. Hmm, 48 ÷ 1296. Well, 1296 ÷ 48 is... let's see: 48*27 is 1296 because 48*25=1200, plus 48*2=96, so 1200+96=1296. So 48 ÷ 1296 = 1/27.

So, 1/27 = I2 / 2025.

Now, solving for I2: I2 = (1/27) * 2025.

2025 ÷ 27. Let me calculate that. 27*70=1890. 2025-1890=135. 27*5=135. So 70+5=75. So 2025 ÷27 =75.

So I2 is 75 candles. Wait, but wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way: 48 candles at 36 inches gives the same illuminance as I2 candles at 45 inches.

So using the inverse square law, the ratio of intensities would be (d1/d2)^2. Wait, no, wait. Because E is proportional to I/(d²), so if E1 = E2, then I1/d1² = I2/d2².

So I2 = I1 * (d2²/d1²).

So I2=48 * (45²/36²).

Calculating 45² is 2025, 36² is 1296.

So 45/36 is 5/4, because 45 ÷ 9=5, 36 ÷9=4. So (5/4)^2 is 25/16.

So I2=48*(25/16) = 48*(25)/16.

48 ÷16 is 3. So 3 *25=75.

Yes, that's correct. So the unknown lamp's intensity is 75 candles.

Looking at the options, option G is 75 candles.

The problem involves determining the luminous intensity of an unknown lamp that, when placed 45 inches from a photometer screen, produces the same illuminance as a standard 48-candle lamp placed 36 inches away. Using the inverse square law for illuminance, we set up the equation \( \frac{I_1}{d_1^2} = \frac{I_2}{d_2^2} \), where \( I_1 = 48 \) candles, \( d_1 = 36 \) inches, and \( d_2 = 45 \) inches. Solving for \( I_2 \) gives \( I_2 = 75 \) candles.
