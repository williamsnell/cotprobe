Okay, so I've got this problem about a steel wire carrying a current, and I need to find the centerline temperature. Hmm, let me start by understanding the given data.

The wire is bare steel with a thermal conductivity (k) of 13 Btu/hr·ft·°F. The current is 1000 amps. The diameter is 0.75 inches, which I should convert to feet because the other units are in feet. Oh wait, 0.75 inches is 0.75/12 feet, which is 0.0625 ft. So the radius is half that, 0.03125 ft.

The air temperature is 70°F, and the surface heat transfer coefficient (h) is 5.0 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. The electrical resistance per foot is 0.0001 ohms. So, the wire's resistance per unit length is given.

I think I need to calculate the heat generated due to the current and then find the temperature distribution in the wire. Since it's a steady-state condition, the heat generated by the current should equal the heat dissipated by convection and radiation.

Wait, but for a long thin wire, maybe we can model it as a cylinder. The heat transfer from the wire to the air will be by convection. So the equation would involve the heat generated per unit length and the heat lost per unit length due to convection.

Let me recall the formula for heat transfer by convection: Q = h * A * (T_w - T_air). But since this is per unit length, I should express it accordingly.

The heat generated per unit length (Q_gen) is I² * R, where I is current and R is resistance per unit length. So Q_gen = (1000)^2 * 0.0001. That would be 1,000,000 * 0.0001 = 100 Btu/hr per foot. Wait, that seems high. Wait, 1000^2 is 1,000,000, multiplied by 0.0001 gives 100. So yes, 100 Btu/hr per foot.

Now, the heat lost per unit length (Q_loss) should equal Q_gen. So,

Q_loss = h * (2πr) * (T_center - T_air)

Because for a cylinder, the surface area per unit length is 2πr. So,

100 = 5 * 2π * 0.03125 * (T_center - 70)

Let me compute that. 2π is approximately 6.2832. Multiply by 0.03125: 6.2832 * 0.03125 = approximately 0.19635. Then multiply by 5: 5 * 0.19635 = ~0.98175.

So,

100 = 0.98175 * (T_center -70)

Divide both sides by 0.98175: 100 / 0.98175 ≈ 101.86. So,

101.86 = T_center - 70

Add 70 to both sides: T_center ≈ 171.86°F. Wait, that's way lower than any of the options given. The options start at 330°F and go up to 600°F. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for conduction in the wire. Oh right, because the heat generated is in the center, it has to conduct through the wire to the surface, and then convect away. So the temperature distribution isn't uniform; it's higher at the center.

So I need to model the temperature profile considering both conduction and convection. For a steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction in a cylinder (wire), the temperature distribution can be found using the formula that relates the centerline temperature to the surface temperature and the heat transfer conditions.

The formula for the centerline temperature (Tc) in a long cylinder with internal generation is:

Tc = Ts + (Q'' / (2πk)) * ln(r/R) * (1/h * (1/(2r)))^{-1} ?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the relation involving the thermal resistance. The total thermal resistance is the sum of the conduction resistance from center to surface and the convection resistance from surface to air.

The conduction resistance (R_cond) for a cylinder is ln(r/R)/(2πkL), but since we're considering per unit length, L=1 ft, so R_cond = ln(r/R)/(2πk). Wait, r is the radius, R is the same as r? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing variables. Let me think again.

The formula for conduction resistance in a cylinder is R_cond = ln(ro/r_i)/(2πkL), where ro is outer radius, r_i is inner radius. But in this case, since it's a solid cylinder with radius r, the conduction from center to surface is R_cond = ln(ro/r_i)/(2πkL). But if the wire is solid and we're considering from center (r_i=0) to surface (ro=r), then ln(ro/r_i) becomes ln(r/0), which is undefined. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, no, maybe I should consider the average or another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula used when the heat is generated uniformly is different.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula for the centerline temperature when there's internal heat generation. The formula is:

Tc = [ (h A / (2πk L)) + (Q'' / (2πk L)) * ln(r/R) ] * something?

Wait, perhaps I should approach it using the overall heat transfer equation.

The heat generated per unit length is Q_gen = I² R = 1000² * 0.0001 = 100 Btu/hr·ft.

The heat lost per unit length is Q_loss = h * 2πr (Tw - Ta), where Tw is the surface temperature.

But at the same time, the heat must conduct from the center to the surface. So the conduction equation is:

Q = (2πk L) * (Tc - Ts) * (ln(ro/r_i)/(ro - r_i)) ) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the formula for the temperature of a uniformly heated cylinder with convection cooling.

I remember that for a long cylinder with uniform heat generation, the centerline temperature can be calculated using:

Tc = Ts + (Q'' / (2πk)) * ln(ro/r_i) * (1/(h / (2πr)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total thermal resistance is the sum of conduction and convection resistances.

The conduction resistance (R_cond) from center to surface is R_cond = ln(ro/r_i)/(2πkL). But since it's a solid cylinder, ro = r_i = r? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of it wrong. Maybe R_cond is expressed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

R_total = R_cond + R_conv

Where R_conv = 1/(h A) = 1/(h * 2πr L) per unit length.

Wait, let's think in terms of per foot length.

So, R_conv = 1/(h * 2πr), because area per foot is 2πr, and h is given per square foot.

So R_conv = 1/(5 * 2π * 0.03125) = 1/(5 * 0.19635) ≈ 1/(0.98175) ≈ 1.0186 °F/Btu.

Now, R_cond is the resistance due to conduction from center to surface. For a cylinder, the conduction resistance is R_cond = ln(ro/r_i)/(2πk), but since it's a solid cylinder, perhaps r_i is zero, which would cause ln(r/0) to be infinity. That can't be right. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, for a solid cylinder, the formula for the centerline temperature with uniform heat generation is:

Tc = Ts + (Q'' / (2πk)) * ln(ro/r_i) / (h/(2πr)) )

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a standard formula.

I recall that for a long cylinder with uniform heat generation and convection cooling, the centerline temperature can be found using:

Tc = Ts + ( (Q'' ) / (2πk) ) * ln(ro/r_i) * (1/(h/(2πr))) )

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Tc = Ts + ( (Q'' ) / (2πk) ) * ( ln(r/R) ) * (1/(h/(2πr))) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the energy balance. The heat generated per unit length is Q_gen = 100 Btu/hr·ft.

This heat must be conducted from the center to the surface, then convected away.

So, the conduction equation is:

Q_gen = (2πk L) * (Tc - Ts) / (ln(ro/r_i) / (ro - r_i)) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for steady-state temperature in a cylinder with internal generation.

The formula I found online before is:

Tc = Ts + ( (Q'' ) / (2πk) ) * ln(ro/r_i) * (1/(h/(2πr))) )

Wait, let me think of it as:

The heat conducted from center to surface is Q = (2πk L) * (Tc - Ts) / (ln(ro/r_i)/(ro - r_i)))

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Tc = Ts + ( (Q'' ) / (h * 2πr) ) * ( ln(ro/r_i) ) )

Wait, let me try to derive it.

The heat generated per unit length is Q'' = 100 Btu/hr·ft.

The heat conducted from the center to the surface must equal the heat convected away.

The conduction equation for a cylinder is:

Q = (2πk L) * (Tc - Ts) * (ln(ro/r_i))/(ro^2 - r_i^2)

But since it's a solid cylinder, r_i is zero, so ro = r. But that makes ro^2 - r_i^2 = r^2, and ln(ro/r_i) approaches infinity because r_i approaches zero. That can't be right, so maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps for a solid cylinder, the formula is:

Q = (2πk L) * (Tc - Ts) * (1/(2r)) )

Wait, that seems familiar. Because for a solid cylinder, the average radius is r/2, and the formula might be simplified.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is Tc = Ts + ( (Q'' ) / (2πk) ) * (1/(h/(2πr))) )

Wait, that would be Tc = Ts + (Q'' / (2πk)) * (2πr / h) ) = Ts + (Q'' * r)/(k h)

Let me plug the numbers in.

Q'' is 100 Btu/hr·ft, r is 0.03125 ft, k is 13, h is 5.

So,

Tc = 70 + (100 * 0.03125) / (13 * 5)

Calculate numerator: 100 * 0.03125 = 3.125

Denominator: 13 *5 = 65

So 3.125 /65 ≈ 0.04808

So Tc ≈70 + 0.04808 ≈ 70.048°F. That can't be right because the options are much higher. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer from conduction is Q = (2πk L) * (Tc - Ts) * (1/(2r)) )

Wait, that would mean Q = (2πk L)/(2r) (Tc - Ts) → Q = (πk L)/r (Tc - Ts)

Since L is 1 ft, Q = (π *13 *1)/(0.03125) (Tc -70)

Which is Q = (13π)/(0.03125) (Tc -70) → 13π ≈40.84, divided by 0.03125 is 1301.04.

So Q = 1301.04 (Tc -70)

But Q must equal the heat loss, which is also Q = h * 2πr (Tc -70). Wait, no, because Ts is the surface temperature, not the center. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as:

The heat generated per unit length is I² R = 100 Btu/hr·ft.

This heat must conduct from the center to the surface and then convect away.

So the total resistance is R_total = R_cond + R_conv.

R_conv is 1/(h * 2πr) = 1/(5 * 2π *0.03125) = 1/(5 * 0.19635) ≈ 1/0.98175 ≈1.0186 °F/Btu.

R_cond is the resistance for conduction from center to surface. For a cylinder, R_cond = ln(ro/r_i)/(2πk L). But since it's a solid cylinder, r_i approaches 0, which makes ln(ro/r_i) approach infinity. That can't be right, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe for a solid cylinder, the formula is R_cond = (1/(2πk)) * ln(ro/r_i) * (1/(L)), but again, with r_i=0, it's problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a solid cylinder where the conduction resistance is R_cond = (ln(ro/r_i))/(2πk L). But with r_i=0, this becomes infinite, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the temperature profile using the formula for a cylinder with uniform heat generation and convection cooling. The formula for the centerline temperature is:

Tc = Ts + ( (2 * Q'' * r² ) / (h * k) ) * (1/(1 + (2 r h)/(k)) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the centerline temperature in a long cylinder with uniform heat generation and convection:

Tc = (h * Ts + 2 Q'' r² ) / (h + 2 Q'' r² )

Wait, let me check the units. Q'' is in Btu/hr·ft², h is Btu/hr·ft²·°F, r is in ft.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Tc = Ts + ( (2 Q'' r² ) / (h k) ) * (1/(1 + (2 r h)/(k)) )

But I'm not confident. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

Q'' is 100 Btu/hr·ft, but wait, no, Q'' is the heat flux, which would be Q_gen per unit area, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the surface temperature first.

The heat generated per unit length is 100 Btu/hr·ft.

The heat lost per unit length is h * 2πr (Tw - Ta), where Tw is the surface temperature.

So,

100 = 5 * 2π * 0.03125 * (Tw -70)

Compute 5 * 2π *0.03125: 5 * 6.2832 *0.03125 ≈5 * 0.19635 ≈0.98175

So,

100 = 0.98175 (Tw -70)

Tw -70 = 100 / 0.98175 ≈101.86 → Tw ≈171.86°F

But this is the surface temperature. Now, the centerline temperature will be higher because heat has to conduct from the center to the surface.

The conduction equation for a cylinder is:

(Tc - Tw) = ( (Tw - Ta) * ln(ro/r_i) ) / (2πk L )

Wait, but again, with r_i=0, ln(ro/r_i) is infinite. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model the temperature profile as varying logarithmically. The general solution for steady-state heat conduction in a cylinder with uniform heat generation is:

T(r) = A ln(r) + B

Applying boundary conditions: at r = r (surface), T(r) = Tw, and at r approaching 0, the heat flux is finite (since current is flowing, the temperature gradient can't be infinite). So,

At r = r: T(r) = A ln(r) + B = Tw

At r →0: The derivative dT/dr = A/r should be finite, which implies A=0. Therefore, T(r) = B, which would be uniform. But that can't be right because we have heat generation, so the temperature must vary.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the heat generated per unit length is I² R = 100 Btu/hr·ft, and the heat loss is h * 2πr (Tw -70). But since the wire's center is hotter than the surface, I need to relate Tw and Tc.

Wait, perhaps I should assume that the heat conducted from the center to the surface is equal to the heat lost by convection.

So,

Q_cond = Q_conv

Q_cond = (2πk L) * (Tc - Tw) * (1/(ln(ro/r_i)))

But since r_i=0, ln(ro/r_i) is infinite, which suggests that the conduction resistance is infinite, which can't be right. So perhaps I should use a different formula.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the centerline temperature in a solid cylinder with uniform heat generation:

Tc = ( (h Ts) + (2 Q'' r²) ) / (h + 2 Q'' r² )

Wait, let's try that.

h =5, Ts=70, Q''=100, r=0.03125 ft.

Compute numerator: 5*70 + 2*100*(0.03125)^2

5*70=350

(0.03125)^2=0.0009766

2*100*0.0009766=0.19532

So numerator=350 +0.19532≈350.195

Denominator:5 + 2*100*0.0009766=5 +0.19532≈5.19532

So Tc=350.195/5.19532≈67.4°F

That's lower than the surface temperature, which doesn't make sense because the center should be hotter. So this formula must be incorrect.

I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the centerline temperature in a long cylinder with internal heat generation and convection:

Tc = Ts + ( (2 * Q'' * r²) ) / (h * k )

Let me try that.

Q'' is 100 Btu/hr·ft², r=0.03125 ft, h=5, k=13.

So,

(2 * 100 * (0.03125)^2 ) / (5 *13 )

Calculate numerator: 2 *100=200; (0.03125)^2=0.0009766; 200 *0.0009766≈0.1953

Denominator:5*13=65

So,

Tc =70 + (0.1953/65) ≈70 +0.003005≈70.003°F, which is impossible because the wire is generating heat.

Clearly, I'm making a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should start over.

Alternative approach:

1. Calculate the heat generated per unit length: I² R = (1000)^2 * 0.0001 = 100 Btu/hr·ft.

2. The heat must be conducted from the center to the surface and then convected away.

3. The conduction from center to surface can be modeled using the formula for a cylinder:

Q = (2πk L) * (Tc - Ts) * (ln(ro/r_i))/(ro^2 - r_i^2)

But since r_i approaches 0, this becomes undefined. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the temperature gradient in the wire. The heat transfer equation for a cylinder is:

d²T/dr² + (2/r) dT/dr = (Q_gen)/(k)

Integrating this with boundary conditions: at r=R (surface), T = Tw; and at r=0, the derivative dT/dr is finite to avoid infinite temperature.

The solution is:

T(r) = (Q_gen/(4k)) * r² + C ln(r) + D

Applying boundary conditions:

At r=0, dT/dr must be finite → C=0.

So,

T(r) = (Q_gen/(4k)) r² + D

At r=R (surface), T(R) = Tw = (Q_gen/(4k)) R² + D

But wait, I think I'm missing something because we also have convection at the surface. So the boundary condition at the surface should include the convection.

So, the correct boundary condition at the surface is:

- (k) dT/dr(R) = h (T(R) - Ta)

Because the heat flux due to conduction equals the convective heat transfer.

So, let's set up the equations.

The general solution is T(r) = A r² + B ln(r) + C

But considering the boundary condition at r=0, the logarithmic term must be zero to avoid infinite temperature, so B=0.

Thus, T(r) = A r² + C

Applying the boundary condition at r=R:

dT/dr = 2A R

The conduction condition at r=R:

- k dT/dr(R) = h (T(R) - Ta)

So,

- k (2A R) = h (A R² + C - Ta)

And at r=R, T(R) = A R² + C = Tw

So,

Tw = A R² + C

From the conduction equation:

-2A k R = h (A R² + C - Ta)

But since C = Tw - A R²,

-2A k R = h (Tw - Ta)

We also have the heat generation equation:

The total heat generated per unit length is Q = ∫ (from 0 to R) 2πr (dT/dr) k dr = I² R

So,

Q = ∫0^R 2πr * (2A) k dr = 2π * 2A k ∫0^R r dr = 4π A k (R²/2) = 2π A k R²

Set this equal to Q=100:

2π A k R² = 100 → A = 100 / (2π k R²)

Now, let's substitute A into the conduction equation.

From conduction:

-2A k R = h (Tw - Ta)

Substitute A:

-2*(100/(2π k R²)) *k R = h (Tw - Ta)

Simplify:

- (100 / (π R)) ) = h (Tw - Ta)

Wait, but this gives a negative value on the left, which doesn't make sense because Tw should be higher than Ta. Perhaps I made a sign error.

Wait, the equation is:

-2A k R = h (Tw - Ta)

Substituting A:

-2*(100/(2π k R²)) *k R = h (Tw - Ta)

Simplify:

- (100/(π R)) = h (Tw - Ta)

But this would imply Tw < Ta, which is impossible because the wire is generating heat. So I must have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

+k dT/dr(R) = h (Tw - Ta)

Because the heat flux out of the wire is positive when Tw > Ta.

So, the correct condition is:

k dT/dr(R) = h (Tw - Ta)

Thus,

k * 2A R = h (Tw - Ta)

Now, substituting A:

A = 100 / (2π k R²)

So,

k * 2*(100/(2π k R²)) * R = h (Tw - Ta)

Simplify numerator:

k * 2 * 100 / (2π k R²) * R = (100 / (π R)) )

So,

100/(π R) = h (Tw -70)

R is the radius, which is 0.03125 ft.

So,

100/(π *0.03125) ≈ 100 / 0.09817 ≈1018.6

So,

1018.6 =5*(Tw -70)

Divide both sides by5:

Tw -70 ≈203.72 → Tw≈273.72°F

Now, we can find A:

A =100/(2π *13*(0.03125)^2 )

Calculate denominator:

2π ≈6.2832; 13*6.2832≈81.6816; (0.03125)^2≈0.0009766

So,

Denominator=81.6816 *0.0009766≈0.07966

Thus,

A=100/0.07966≈1255.9

Now, T(r) = A r² + C

At r=R (0.03125 ft):

Tw = A R² + C → C= Tw - A R²

We have Tw≈273.72, A≈1255.9, R=0.03125

R²=0.0009766

So,

A R²=1255.9 *0.0009766≈1.225

Thus,

C=273.72 -1.225≈272.495

Now, the centerline temperature is at r=0, so T(0)=C=272.495°F. But wait, that's lower than the surface temperature, which doesn't make sense because the center should be hotter. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, because as r increases, T(r) increases because A is positive. Wait, no, T(r)=A r² + C. If A is positive, then T increases with r. But that would mean the surface is hotter, which contradicts the current situation because the wire is generating heat internally. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Looking back, when I set up the equation for heat generation, I had:

Q = ∫ (from 0 to R) 2πr (dT/dr) k dr = I² R

dT/dr = 2A r

So,

Q = ∫0^R 2πr *2A r *k dr = 4π A k ∫0^R r² dr =4π A k (R³/3)

Set equal to 100:

4π A k (R³/3) =100 → A= (100 *3)/(4π k R³)

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation of A. Let me recalculate A correctly.

So,

A= (100 *3)/(4π *13*(0.03125)^3 )

Compute denominator:

4π≈12.566; 12.566 *13≈163.358; (0.03125)^3≈0.000030518

So denominator=163.358 *0.000030518≈0.004982

Thus,

A=300 /0.004982≈60,175.3

Now, back to the conduction condition:

k *2A R =h (Tw -70)

Substitute A:

13 * 2 *60,175.3 *0.03125 =5*(Tw -70)

Calculate left side:

13 *2=26; 26 *60,175.3≈1,564,558; 1,564,558 *0.03125≈48,900.0

So,

48,900 =5*(Tw -70)

Divide by5: Tw -70=9,780 → Tw=9,850°F, which is way too high and doesn't match any options. Clearly, I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me double-check all the steps.

Wait, when calculating Q, the heat generated per unit length is I² R =1000^2 *0.0001=100 Btu/hr·ft.

The integral for Q should be correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for T(r).

Wait, the correct general solution for steady-state heat conduction in a cylinder with uniform heat generation is:

T(r) = (Q''/(4k)) r² + C + D ln(r)

But with the boundary condition that at r=0, the temperature gradient is finite, so D=0.

Thus, T(r) = (Q''/(4k)) r² + C

But Q'' is the heat flux, which I'm not sure I'm calculating correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should express Q'' as the heat generated per unit volume, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the centerline temperature in a long cylinder:

Tc = ( (h Ts) + (4 Q_gen r² )/(k) ) / ( h + 4 Q_gen r² /k )

Wait, let me try that.

h=5, Ts=70, Q_gen=100 Btu/hr·ft, r=0.03125 ft, k=13.

Compute numerator:5*70 + (4*100*(0.03125)^2)/13

5*70=350

(4*100)=400; (0.03125)^2=0.0009766; 400*0.0009766≈0.39064; 0.39064/13≈0.03005

So numerator=350 +0.03005≈350.03005

Denominator:5 + (4*100*(0.03125)^2)/13 =5 +0.03005≈5.03005

Thus,

Tc≈350.03005 /5.03005 ≈69.58°F, which is even lower, which can't be right.

I'm clearly stuck and making mistakes. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the temperature drop from center to surface is small, and uses an approximate formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is around 560°F, which is option B. But I'm not confident.

After struggling through this, I think the correct approach involves calculating the surface temperature using convection and then using the conduction equation to find the centerline temperature.

Surface temperature Tw:

Q = h * 2πr (Tw -70) →100 =5 *2π*0.03125*(Tw-70)

Compute 5*2π*0.03125≈5*0.19635≈0.98175

So,

100=0.98175*(Tw-70) →Tw-70≈101.86 →Tw≈171.86°F

Now, using the conduction equation from center to surface:

Q = (2πk L) * (Tc - Tw) / (ln(r/R)) 

Wait, but R is the same as r, so ln(r/R)=ln(1)=0, which is undefined. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for a solid cylinder with internal heat generation and convection is:

Tc = ( (h Ts) + (4 Q r² )/(k) ) / (h + (4 Q r²)/k )

Plugging in the numbers:

h=5, Ts=70, Q=100, r=0.03125, k=13.

Compute numerator:5*70 + (4*100*(0.03125)^2)/13 →350 + (4*100*0.0009766)/13 →350 + (0.39064)/13 ≈350 +0.03005≈350.03005

Denominator:5 + (4*100*(0.03125)^2)/13 →5 +0.03005≈5.03005

So,

Tc≈350.03005/5.03005≈69.58°F, which can't be right because the surface temperature is 171.86°F.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the resistance in the wire leads to a higher temperature, and the correct answer is around 560°F, which is option B.

To determine the centerline temperature of the steel wire, we analyze the heat generated due to the current and the heat dissipated through convection. The heat generated per unit length of the wire is calculated as:

\[
Q_{\text{gen}} = I^2 R = (1000)^2 \times 0.0001 = 100 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}.
\]

The heat dissipated per unit length is given by convection:

\[
Q_{\text{loss}} = h \cdot 2\pi r \cdot (T_{\text{center}} - T_{\text{air}}),
\]

where \( h = 5.0 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2 \cdot \degree F \), \( r = 0.03125 \, \text{ft} \), and \( T_{\text{air}} = 70^\circ \text{F} \). Substituting the values:

\[
100 = 5 \cdot 2\pi \cdot 0.03125 \cdot (T_{\text{center}} - 70).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
100 = 0.98175 \cdot (T_{\text{center}} - 70),
\]

\[
T_{\text{center}} - 70 = \frac{100}{0.98175} \approx 101.86,
\]

\[
T_{\text{center}} \approx 171.86^\circ \text{F}.
\]

However, this result is inconsistent with the provided options, as it suggests a much lower temperature than expected. Revisiting the analysis, the heat generated must also account for conduction from the center to the surface. Using the formula for the centerline temperature in a cylinder with uniform heat generation and convection:

\[
T_{\text{center}} = \frac{h \cdot T_{\text{air}} + \frac{4 \cdot Q_{\text{gen}} \cdot r^2}{k}}{h + \frac{4 \cdot Q_{\text{gen}} \cdot r^2}{k}},
\]

where \( Q_{\text{gen}} = 100 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft} \), \( r = 0.03125 \, \text{ft} \), \( k = 13 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft} \cdot \degree F \), and \( h = 5.0 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2 \cdot \degree F \). Substituting:

\[
T_{\text{center}} = \frac{5 \cdot 70 + \frac{4 \cdot 100 \cdot (0.03125)^2}{13}}{5 + \frac{4 \cdot 100 \cdot (0.03125)^2}{13}}.
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
5 \cdot 70 = 350,
\]
\[
\frac{4 \cdot 100 \cdot (0.03125)^2}{13} = \frac{4 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.0009766}{13} \approx 0.3005,
\]
\[
\text{Numerator} = 350 + 0.3005 \approx 350.3005.
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
5 + 0.3005 \approx 5.3005.
\]

Thus:

\[
T_{\text{center}} \approx \frac{350.3005}{5.3005} \approx 66.09^\circ \text{F}.
\]

This result is still inconsistent with the options, indicating a flaw in the approach. Considering the significant heat generation and the need for a higher centerline temperature, the correct answer is likely **560°F**, as it aligns with the expected range for such conditions.
