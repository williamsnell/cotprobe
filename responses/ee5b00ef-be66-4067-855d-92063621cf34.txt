Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about group theory and modular arithmetic. I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, pick the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by looking at Statement 1: "For n > 1, the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n." Hmm, I remember that a group requires closure, associativity, an identity element, and inverses for each element.

Wait, but wait, is that always the case? I think it depends on whether n is prime or composite. Oh right! If n is prime, then the set {1,2,...,n-1} under multiplication modulo n does form a group because every element has a multiplicative inverse. But if n is composite, like 4 or 6, then not every element in the set will have an inverse modulo n. For example, take n=4. The set is {1,2,3}. Let's see: 2*2=4 mod4=0, which isn't in the set. So 2 doesn't have an inverse in this set because there's no x such that 2x ≡1 mod4. So for composite n, the set isn't a group under multiplication modulo n.

So Statement 1 says "for n>1," which includes both primes and composites. Since it's not true for all n>1, Statement 1 is false. Because, for example, n=4 doesn't satisfy the condition. So Statement 1 is False.

Now onto Statement 2: "There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1." So this is asking if 63 and 100 are coprime. Because if they are, then 63 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 100, and x would be that inverse.

Let me check the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 63 and 100. The prime factors of 63 are 7*3*3, and 100 is 2^2*5^2. They share no common prime factors, so gcd(63,100)=1. That means 63 and 100 are coprime, so there exists an integer x such that 63x ≡1 mod100. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but the options also mention what kind of x it is. Let me think. So x is the inverse of 63 mod100. Let's find x. I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Let me compute gcd(63,100) and find x and y such that 63x +100y =1.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:

100 divided by 63 is 1 with remainder 37. So 100 = 1*63 +37.

63 divided by 37 is 1 with remainder 26. So 63=1*37 +26.

37 divided by 26 is 1 with remainder 11. So 37=1*26 +11.

26 divided by 11 is 2 with remainder 4. So 26=2*11 +4.

11 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 3. So 11=2*4 +3.

4 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 1. So 4=1*3 +1.

3 divided by 1 is 3 with remainder 0. So gcd is 1.

Now, working backward to express 1 as a combination:

1 = 4 - 1*3

But 3 = 11 - 2*4, so substitute:

1 = 4 -1*(11 -2*4) = 3*4 -1*11

But 4 =26 -2*11, so substitute:

1 =3*(26 -2*11) -1*11 =3*26 -7*11

Now, 11=37 -1*26, substitute:

1=3*26 -7*(37-26) =3*26 -7*37 +7*26 =10*26 -7*37

And 26=63 -1*37, substitute:

1=10*(63 -37) -7*37 =10*63 -10*37 -7*37 =10*63 -17*37

Then, 37=100 -1*63, substitute:

1=10*63 -17*(100 -63) =10*63 -17*100 +17*63 =27*63 -17*100.

So the equation is 27*63 -17*100 =1. Therefore, x=27 is a solution. So 63*27 ≡1 mod100.

So x is 27, which is less than 100. Also, 27 is an odd number. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, Statement 2 is True, so options A, C, E, F, H, J could be possible. Now, looking at the additional info:

Option C says True and x is an odd number. 27 is indeed odd. So that holds.

Option E says x is a prime number. 27 is not prime, it's 3^3. So E is wrong.

Option F: x is a multiple of 7. 27 divided by 7 is about 3.857, so no. 27 mod7 is 6. So F is wrong.

Option H: True, but nothing about x. So if the question requires more about x, H might not fit unless the option just says True, which it does in H as the second part, but the first option (Statement1) is False, so H can't be the answer.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

The options are structured as:

A: False, True

B: False, False and x<100

C: False, True and x is odd

D: True, True and x>100

E: False, True and x is prime

F: True, True and x is multiple of7

G: True, False and x is multiple of10

H: True, True

I: False, False

J: True, False

So since Statement1 is False and Statement2 is True, the possible options are A, C, E, I (if Statement2 were False, but it's True, so only A, C, E, H, etc., but H has both True, which is not the case for Statement1.

So from the options, A is False, True.

C is False, True and x is odd. Since x is 27, which is odd, C is correct.

E is False, True and x is prime, which is wrong.

So the correct option would be C, because Statement1 is False, Statement2 is True, and x is an odd number.

Wait, but let me confirm x. Another way to find x is by trial. Since 63 mod100 is 63, so we need a number x where 63x ends with 1 in the last two digits.

Let me try x=27: 63*27=1701 → 01 mod100, yes. So x=27 is correct.

So yes, x is 27, which is odd and less than 100. So option C says False, True and x is odd.

So the correct answer would be option C.
</think>

The first statement is false because the set {1,2,...,n-1} under multiplication modulo n is only a group when n is prime. The second statement is true because 63 and 100 are coprime, so an inverse x exists. The inverse x=27 is odd and less than 100.
