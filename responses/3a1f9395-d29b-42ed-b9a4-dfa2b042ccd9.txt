Question:

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

Options:

A: Both severing the dorsal and ventral roots cause increased sensation and reflex action.
B: Severing the dorsal root causes loss of motor function, severing the ventral root causes enhanced sensation.
C: Both severing the dorsal and ventral roots lead to complete paralysis of the affected part.
D: Severing the dorsal root causes enhanced movement, severing the ventral root has no effect.
E: Severing the dorsal root causes loss of sensation and reflex action, severing the ventral root causes inability to move the affected part.
F: Severing the dorsal root has no effect, severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation.
G: Severing the dorsal root causes paralysis, severing the ventral root causes heightened sensitivity.
H: Severing the dorsal root causes involuntary twitching, severing the ventral root causes loss of reflex action.
I: Severing the dorsal root causes increased reflex action, severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation.
J: Severing the dorsal root has no effect, severing the ventral root causes paralysis.

Okay, so I've got this question about the effects of severing the dorsal and ventral roots of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my neuroanatomy, but let me try to work through this.

First, I remember that the spinal cord has these roots—dorsal and ventral. The dorsal root, I think, is related to sensory functions. So when a nerve enters the spinal cord, the part that brings in sensory information comes in through the dorsal root. That makes sense because the dorsal root probably carries the sensory (afferent) fibers. On the other hand, the ventral root is for motor functions, sending out signals to muscles, so that's where the efferent fibers go. So the ventral root is responsible for movement and motor control.

If the dorsal root is severed, that should affect the sensory part. So the rat wouldn't be able to feel anything from that part of the leg. But wait, what about reflex actions? Reflexes are quick responses that don't go through the brain. They involve the spinal cord processing the sensory input and sending the motor response. So if the sensory part (dorsal root) is cut, the reflexes might not work because the signal can't get in. So cutting the dorsal root would cause loss of sensation and reflex actions.

Now, if the ventral root is severed, that's the motor part. So the muscles wouldn't receive the signals from the spinal cord. That would mean the rat can't move the leg—that's paralysis. But wait, what about sensation? The sensory part is still intact because the dorsal root wasn't cut, so the rat would still feel sensations but wouldn't be able to move in response. So without the ventral root, no motor function, but sensation remains.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E says: Severing the dorsal root causes loss of sensation and reflex action, severing the ventral root causes inability to move the affected part. That fits with what I was thinking. The dorsal cut affects sensation and reflexes, and the ventral cut affects movement.

Let me quickly check other options to make sure. Option B says the opposite for the ventral—enhanced sensation? No, that doesn't make sense. Option I talks about increased reflex when dorsal is cut, which contradicts because without the sensory input, reflexes wouldn't happen. Option G says dorsal causes paralysis, which is more about the ventral. So E seems correct.

The correct answer is E. Severing the dorsal root disrupts sensory input and reflexes, while severing the ventral root impairs motor function. 

Answer: E
