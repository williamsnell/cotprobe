Okay, so I have this question about plant growth directions and the terms related to tropisms. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down.

The question says a plant grows opposite to gravitational force. So, I remember that tropisms are growth responses to stimuli. The main types are geotropism, phototropism, chemotropism, hydrotropism, and thigmotropism, each dealing with gravity, light, chemicals, water, and touch respectively.

Positive geotropism would mean the plant grows in the direction of gravity. Like roots usually growing downward. But the question says the plant grows opposite, so that's against gravity. So maybe it's negative geotropism? Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a 'negative geotropism' option. Let me check the options again.

The options are A to J. Let me go through them. Option F is positive geotropism, which isn't what we want. Option G is negative gravitropism. Wait, gravitropism is another term for geotropism. So negative gravitropism would mean growing away from gravity. That fits because the plant is moving opposite to gravity.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Geotropism is about gravity. If a plant grows against gravity, that's negative geotropism, which is the same as negative gravitropism. So looking at the options, G is negative gravitropism. That should be the answer.

Let me make sure. Other options: positive phototropism is growing towards light, which is not this case. Negative phototropism would be away from light. Chemotropism is about chemicals, so not relevant here. Hydrotropism is water, thigmotropism is touch. So yeah, the correct term is negative gravitropism, which is option G.

The plant growing opposite to gravity is an example of negative gravitropism, which is option G.

Answer: G
