Okay, so I've got this problem about a self-excited generator, and I need to find the resistances of the armature and field circuits. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about generators.

The problem says it's a 10-kW, 250-V self-excited generator. So, first off, I should probably calculate the rated current. Since power (P) is voltage (V) times current (I), I can use P = V * I. Wait, but wait, is that for a motor or a generator? Oh right, same basic formula applies for generators when delivering power.

So, the rated load would be when it's operating at its maximum capacity. So P is 10 kW, which is 10,000 W. The voltage V is 250 V. So the rated current I would be P divided by V. Let me calculate that: I = 10,000 / 250 = 40 A. So the rated current is 40 A.

Next, the problem states that the armature-circuit voltage drop is 5% of the terminal voltage. The terminal voltage is given as 250 V, so 5% of that is 0.05 * 250 = 12.5 V. So the armature voltage drop is 12.5 V.

The armature circuit resistance R_a can be found using Ohm's Law: V = I * R. But wait, which current do I use here? Since it's delivering rated load, I think it's the armature current at rated load. So I'm assuming the armature current I_a is the same as the rated current, which is 40 A. So R_a = V_drop / I_a = 12.5 V / 40 A. Let me compute that: 12.5 / 40 is 0.3125 ohms. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.3125. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: in a self-excited generator, the field current is part of the armature circuit, right? So when the generator is self-excited, the field current is supplied by the armature. So the total current in the armature circuit would be the sum of the load current and the field current. But in this problem, maybe they've simplified it by considering that the armature current is approximately equal to the rated load current, especially since the field current is given as 5% of the rated load current. Let me check that.

The problem says the shunt-field current is 5% of the rated load current. So 5% of 40 A is 2 A. So the field current I_f is 2 A. Now, since it's a shunt field, the field resistance R_f is E_shunt = V_shunt / I_shunt. Wait, but wait, the field voltage would be the same as the terminal voltage, right? Because the field is connected in parallel with the load. So the field voltage is 250 V, so R_f = 250 V / 2 A = 125 ohms. Hmm, that's one of the options. Looking at option D, the field resistance is 125 Ω. So that's looking promising.

But going back to the armature resistance. Earlier, I calculated R_a as 0.3125 Ω, but none of the options have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the armature current is 40 A. Because in a self-excited generator, the armature current is I_a = I_load + I_field. So I_a = 40 A (load) + 2 A (field) = 42 A. So perhaps I should use 42 A instead of 40 A for the armature current when calculating R_a.

So R_a would be 12.5 V / 42 A ≈ 0.2976 Ω, which rounds to approximately 0.298 Ω. Looking at the options, option D has 0.298 Ω for the armature and 125 Ω for the field. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. The voltage drop is 5% of terminal voltage, so 12.5 V. The armature current is 40 A (load) plus 2 A (field), totaling 42 A. So R_a is 12.5 / 42 = ~0.2976 Ω. That's option D.

So the armature resistance is approximately 0.298 Ω, and field resistance is 125 Ω. So the correct option is D.

To solve the problem, calculate the armature and field resistances of a 10-kW, 250-V self-excited generator.

1. **Rated Load Current**:  
   Using \( P = V \times I \), the rated current is \( I = \frac{10,000}{250} = 40 \, \text{A} \).

2. **Armature Voltage Drop**:  
   The armature voltage drop is \( 5\% \) of the terminal voltage:  
   \[
   V_{\text{drop}} = 0.05 \times 250 = 12.5 \, \text{V}.
   \]

3. **Armature Resistance**:  
   The armature current includes both the load current and the field current. The field current is \( 5\% \) of the rated load current:  
   \[
   I_f = 0.05 \times 40 = 2 \, \text{A}.
   \]  
   Thus, the total armature current is:  
   \[
   I_a = I_{\text{load}} + I_f = 40 + 2 = 42 \, \text{A}.
   \]  
   Using Ohm's Law:  
   \[
   R_a = \frac{V_{\text{drop}}}{I_a} = \frac{12.5}{42} \approx 0.298 \, \Omega.
   \]

4. **Field Resistance**:  
   The field voltage is equal to the terminal voltage, and the field current is \( 2 \, \text{A} \). Using Ohm's Law:  
   \[
   R_f = \frac{V_{\text{field}}}{I_f} = \frac{250}{2} = 125 \, \Omega.
   \]

From the calculations, the armature resistance is approximately \( 0.298 \, \Omega \), and the field resistance is \( 125 \, \Omega \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: Armature Circuit Resistance: 0.298 Ω, Field Circuit Resistance: 125 Ω**
