Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the value of 1/m + 1/n where m and n are the roots of the quadratic equation 2x² + 15x + 16 = 0. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots (m + n) is equal to -b/a, and the product of the roots (mn) is c/a. Yeah, that's from Vieta's formulas, I think. So maybe I can use that here.

Let me write down what I know. The equation is 2x² + 15x + 16 = 0. So, comparing to ax² + bx + c = 0, a is 2, b is 15, and c is 16.

So, the sum of the roots, m + n, should be -b/a, which is -15/2. That's -7.5. And the product of the roots, mn, is c/a, which is 16/2, so that's 8. Got that.

Now, the question is asking for 1/m + 1/n. Hmm, how do I express that in terms of m + n and mn? Oh, right! 1/m + 1/n is the same as (n + m)/(m*n). Because if I find a common denominator, it's (n + m)/(mn). So, that's the formula I need.

So, substituting the values I have: m + n is -15/2, and mn is 8. So, 1/m + 1/n = (m + n)/(mn) = (-15/2)/8.

Wait, let me compute that. Dividing by 8 is the same as multiplying by 1/8. So, (-15/2) * (1/8) = (-15)/(16). Let me check that calculation again. 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, so 7.5 times 8 is 60, but since it's negative, it's -60/16. Oh wait, no, that's not right. I think I messed up the calculation. Let me do it step by step.

Wait, (-15/2) divided by 8 is the same as (-15/2) multiplied by (1/8). So that's (-15 * 1)/(2 * 8) = -15/16. Right, so -15 divided by 16 is -0.9375. So, 1/m + 1/n equals -15/16, which is -0.9375.

Let me check the options given. The options are labeled A to J, and the values are various decimals. Looking through the options, I see option G is -0.9375. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recap:

1. The quadratic equation is 2x² +15x +16=0.
2. Sum of roots, m + n = -b/a = -15/2.
3. Product of roots, mn = c/a = 16/2 = 8.
4. 1/m +1/n = (m +n)/(mn) = (-15/2)/8 = (-15/2)*(1/8) = -15/16.
5. -15/16 is equal to -0.9375, which is option G.

Yeah, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that G is the right answer.

The value of \( \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} \) is found using the sum and product of the roots. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum is \( -\frac{15}{2} \) and the product is 8. Thus, \( \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{-15/2}{8} = -\frac{15}{16} = -0.9375 \).

Answer: G
