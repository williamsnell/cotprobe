<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about vapor pressure of ethyl alcohol at different temperatures, and I need to figure out what it is at 19.0°C based on the given data points. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me two data points: at 34.9°C, the vapor pressure is 0.132 atm, and at 63.5°C, it's 0.526 atm. I need to find the vapor pressure at a lower temperature, 19.0°C. Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure generally increases with temperature, so since 19°C is lower than both given points, the vapor pressure should be lower than 0.132 atm. Looking at the options, that would narrow it down to A (0.3), C (0.08), D (0.025), E (0.2), G (0.0545), or maybe others, but let me check.

Wait, actually, 19°C is lower than 34.9°C, so the vapor pressure should be less than 0.132 atm. So options A (0.3) and E (0.2) and others above 0.132 are out. So possible answers are C (0.08), D (0.025), G (0.0545), etc. 

I think vapor pressure doesn't just linearly increase with temperature, but it follows the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which is ln(P) = -ΔHvap/R (1/T) + C, where ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, R is the gas constant, and C is a constant. So, maybe I can use these two points to estimate ΔHvap and then calculate P at the new temperature.

Let me write down the two equations:

For T1 = 34.9°C = 307.9 K, P1 = 0.132 atm
For T2 = 63.5°C = 336.5 K, P2 = 0.526 atm

Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P1) = (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T1) + C
ln(P2) = (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T2) + C

Subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate C:

ln(P2) - ln(P1) = (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)

Let me compute ln(P2/P1) = ΔHvap/R * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

So, ln(0.526/0.132) = [ΔHvap/(8.314 J/mol·K)] * (1/307.9 - 1/336.5)

First, calculate 0.526 / 0.132. Let me see, 0.526 ÷ 0.132 ≈ 4.0. Because 0.132 * 4 = 0.528, which is close to 0.526, so ln(4) is about 1.386.

Now, calculate 1/T1 - 1/T2:
1/307.9 ≈ 0.003246
1/336.5 ≈ 0.002973
Difference is 0.003246 - 0.002973 = 0.000273 per K.

So, 1.386 = (ΔHvap / 8.314) * 0.000273

Solving for ΔHvap:

ΔHvap = (1.386 * 8.314) / 0.000273

Let me calculate numerator: 1.386 *8.314 ≈ 11.53

Denominator: 0.000273

So ΔHvap ≈ 11.53 / 0.000273 ≈ 42,250 J/mol → 42.25 kJ/mol.

Wait, that seems a bit high. I thought ethanol's ΔHvap was around 35-40 kJ/mol, so maybe okay.

Now, using this ΔHvap, I can find P at T3 = 19.0°C = 292.15 K.

Using Clausius-Clapeyron again:

ln(P3) = (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T3) + C

But I can use one of the existing equations to find C. Let's take the first equation:

ln(0.132) = (-42250 / 8.314)(1/307.9) + C

Wait, let me compute each part.

First, compute (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T3):

ΔHvap = 42250 J/mol
R =8.314 J/mol·K
So, (-42250 /8.314) ≈ -5079.5 K

Then, 1/T3 = 1/292.15 ≈ 0.003423 K^-1

Multiply them: -5079.5 * 0.003423 ≈ -17.36

So, ln(P3) = -17.36 + C

Now, find C using the first equation at T1:

ln(0.132) = (-42250 /8.314)(1/307.9) + C

Compute (-42250/8.314) ≈ -5079.5 K, so 1/307.9 ≈ 0.003246 K^-1 → -5079.5 * 0.003246 ≈ -16.45

So, ln(0.132) ≈ -16.45 + C → C = ln(0.132) + 16.45

Compute ln(0.132): ln(0.132) ≈ -2.028

So, C ≈ -2.028 + 16.45 ≈ 14.422

Now, back to ln(P3) = -17.36 + 14.422 ≈ -2.938

So, P3 = e^(-2.938) ≈ e^-2.938 ≈ 0.0528 atm.

Looking at the options, G is 0.0545 atm, which is close. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but maybe I made a calculation error somewhere. Let me check the steps again.

Another approach: Using the two-point form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

The formula is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1)

Wait, earlier I think I may have miscalculated the denominator. Let me re-express it correctly.

Actually, the correct form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ]

Wait, no: the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ] / (1)

Wait, no, because when you subtract the two equations:

ln(P2) - ln(P1) = (ΔHvap/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ]

So, yes, that's correct.

So, then I have:

ln(0.526/0.132) = (ΔHvap / 8.314) [ (1/307.9) - (1/336.5) ) ]

0.526/0.132 ≈ 4.0, ln(4) ≈ 1.386.

1/307.9 ≈ 0.003246, 1/336.5≈0.002973; difference is 0.000273.

So, 1.386 = (ΔHvap /8.314)*0.000273.

So ΔHvap = (1.386 * 8.314) / 0.000273 ≈ (11.53) / 0.000273 ≈ 42,250 J/mol, so 42.25 kJ/mol.

Using this, then for T3=292.15 K:

ln(P3) = (-42250 /8.314) * (1/292.15) + C

Wait, but I can also use the linear form. Alternatively, perhaps using the Antoine equation would be better, but I think the Clausius approach is the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I can use the two points to estimate the vapor pressure at 19°C by assuming linearity, even though it's an approximation. Let me see. The temperatures are 34.9°C (307.9 K), 63.5°C (336.5 K), and we're looking for 19°C (292.15 K).

But vapor pressure doesn't increase linearly with temperature. So a linear interpolation might not be accurate, but let me try it just to see where it points.

The change in pressure from 34.9 to 63.5°C is 0.526 - 0.132 = 0.394 atm over a temperature increase of 63.5 -34.9 = 28.6°C.

So, per degree, that's 0.394 / 28.6 ≈ 0.01378 atm per °C.

But from 34.9 to 19°C is a decrease of 15.9°C. So, the decrease in pressure would be 15.9 * 0.01378 ≈ 0.219 atm. So, subtracting from 0.132 gives 0.132 -0.219 ≈ -0.087 atm, which doesn't make sense because pressure can't be negative. So this linear approach isn't valid. So, I shouldn't use linear interpolation.

Thus, going back to the Clausius method, which gave me approximately 0.0528 atm, which is about 0.053 atm. The closest option is G: 0.0545 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponent. Let me recheck the calculation for ln(P3):

ln(P3) = (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T3) + C

We found C as 14.422.

Wait, no, correction: earlier steps may have miscalculations. Let me double-check the calculation of C.

From the first data point:

ln(P1) = (-ΔHvap/R)(1/T1) + C

So, ln(0.132) ≈ -2.028 = (-42250 /8.314)(1/307.9) + C

Compute (-42250 /8.314) ≈ -5079.5 K

1/307.9 ≈ 0.003246 → -5079.5 * 0.003246 ≈ let's compute 5079.5 * 0.003246:

5079.5 * 0.003 = 15.2385

5079.5 * 0.000246 ≈ approx 5079.5 * 0.0002 = 1.0159, and 5079.5 *0.000046≈ 0.2338. So total ≈ 1.0159 +0.2338≈1.25. So total ≈15.2385 +1.25≈16.4885.

So, -5079.5 *0.003246 ≈ -16.4885.

Thus, ln(0.132)= -2.028 = (-16.4885) + C → C = -2.028 +16.4885≈14.4605.

Now, for T3=292.15 K:

ln(P3)= (-42250/8.314)*(1/292.15) + C

Compute (-42250 /8.314) ≈-5079.5 K.

1/292.15≈0.003423 K^{-1}.

So, -5079.5 *0.003423 ≈ let's calculate:

5079.5 *0.003=15.2385

5079.5 *0.000423= approx 5079.5 *0.0004=2.0318, and 5079.5 *0.000023≈0.1168. So total≈2.0318+0.1168≈2.1486.

So, total ≈15.2385 +2.1486≈17.387, so the product is -17.387.

Thus, ln(P3)= -17.387 + C → C is 14.4605 → ln(P3)= -17.387 +14.4605≈-2.9265.

So, P3= e^{-2.9265} ≈ e^-2.9265.

What's e^-2.9265? Let's compute:

e^2.9265 is about e^3 is 20.085, but 2.9265 is a bit less than 3. Let me compute e^2.9265.

We know that ln(18)=2.890, ln(19)=2.944. So 2.9265 is between ln(18) and ln(19), closer to ln(19). So e^2.9265≈ approx 18.7. So e^-2.9265 ≈1/18.7≈0.0535 atm.

So, about 0.0535 atm, which is approximately 0.054 atm, matching option G (0.0545 atm).

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent. Let me compute e^-2.9265.

Using a calculator approach:

We can compute ln(0.05) = -2.9957, ln(0.052)= around -2.945.

Wait, let me compute e^-2.9265:

Let me compute 2.9265:

We can approximate e^-2.9265.

We know that e^-3≈0.0498.

But 2.9265 is 0.0735 less than 3. So, using the Taylor expansion around x=3:

e^{-(3 - 0.0735)} = e^-3 * e^{0.0735}.

e^{0.0735} ≈1 +0.0735 + (0.0735)^2/2 + (0.0735)^3/6 ≈1 +0.0735 +0.00272 +0.00028 ≈1.0765.

So, e^-2.9265≈ e^-3 *1.0765≈0.0498 *1.0765≈0.0535.

Yes, so P3≈0.0535 atm, which is close to option G (0.0545 atm).

Thus, the correct answer should be G.

To determine the vapor pressure of ethyl alcohol at 19.0°C, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates vapor pressure to temperature. Given the data points at 34.9°C (0.132 atm) and 63.5°C (0.526 atm), we calculate the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) and then predict the vapor pressure at 19.0°C.

### Step 1: Calculate ΔHvap
Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]
Substitute the given values:
- \(P_1 = 0.132 \, \text{atm}, \, T_1 = 307.9 \, \text{K}\)
- \(P_2 = 0.526 \, \text{atm}, \, T_2 = 336.5 \, \text{K}\)
- \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\)

\[
\ln\left(\frac{0.526}{0.132}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{8.314} \left(\frac{1}{307.9} - \frac{1}{336.5}\right)
\]
\[
\ln(4.0) \approx 1.386 = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{8.314} \times 0.000273
\]
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{1.386 \times 8.314}{0.000273} \approx 42,250 \, \text{J/mol} = 42.25 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Predict vapor pressure at 19.0°C
Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again for \(T_3 = 292.15 \, \text{K}\):
\[
\ln(P_3) = -\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{T_3} + C
\]
First, calculate \(C\) using the data at \(T_1\):
\[
\ln(0.132) = -\frac{42250}{8.314} \cdot \frac{1}{307.9} + C
\]
\[
-2.028 = -16.4885 + C \implies C \approx 14.4605
\]

Now, calculate \(\ln(P_3)\):
\[
\ln(P_3) = -\frac{42250}{8.314} \cdot \frac{1}{292.15} + 14.4605
\]
\[
\ln(P_3) = -17.387 + 14.4605 \approx -2.9265
\]
\[
P_3 = e^{-2.9265} \approx 0.0535 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Conclusion
The calculated vapor pressure at 19.0°C is approximately \(0.0535 \, \text{atm}\), which matches the closest option, **G: 0.0545 atm**.

Answer: G
