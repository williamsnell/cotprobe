Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about dropping hay bales from a plane. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The rancher drops hay bales from a plane that's flying horizontally at 160 km/hr. The height is 80 meters above the ground. She wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle, so she doesn't hit them. The question is asking how far behind the cattle she should push the bales out of the airplane. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I think I remember that when you drop something from a moving plane, it's a projectile motion problem. The key here is that the hay bales will have both horizontal and vertical motion. The horizontal velocity is the same as the plane's speed because there's no air resistance mentioned, so they should move together horizontally. The vertical motion is influenced by gravity.

First, I should probably convert the plane's speed from km/hr to m/s because the height is given in meters and the answer needs to be in meters. Let me recall the conversion factor: 1 km is 1000 meters, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 160 km/hr is equal to (160 * 1000) / 3600 m/s. Let me calculate that.

160 * 1000 = 160,000. Then divided by 3600. Let me do that division: 160,000 ÷ 3600. Well, 3600 goes into 160,000 about 44.444 times because 44 * 3600 = 158,400. So 160,000 - 158,400 = 1,600. 1,600 ÷ 3600 is approximately 0.444. So the speed is approximately 44.444 m/s. Let me write that down as v₀x ≈ 44.444 m/s.

Now, the hay bales are dropped from a height of 80 meters. I need to find out how long it takes for them to hit the ground. That's the time for the vertical motion. The vertical motion is under gravity, so I can use the equation:

h = (1/2) * g * t²

Where h is the height (80 m), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and t is the time. I'll solve for t.

Rearranging the equation: t = sqrt(2h / g)

Plugging in the numbers: t = sqrt(2*80 / 9.8) = sqrt(160 / 9.8). Let me compute that. 160 divided by 9.8 is approximately 16.3265. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(16.3265) ≈ 4.04 seconds. So the time it takes for the bales to reach the ground is about 4.04 seconds.

Wait, I should double-check that calculation. 2*80 is 160. 160 / 9.8 is about 16.3265. The square root of 16.3265 is indeed roughly 4.04 seconds. That makes sense because if you drop something from 80 meters, it takes a few seconds to fall.

Now, with the time known, I can find out how far the hay bales travel horizontally. Since the horizontal velocity is constant, the distance will be v₀x * t.

So, the horizontal distance (range) is 44.444 m/s * 4.04 s. Let me calculate that. 44.444 * 4 is 177.776, and 44.444 * 0.04 is approximately 1.77776. Adding them together gives about 179.553 meters. So the hay bales will land about 179.55 meters from the point directly below the plane where they were dropped.

But wait, the rancher wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So she needs to adjust where she releases the bales so that when they land, they are 30 meters behind. That means the bales should land 30 meters behind the current position of the cattle. So, the plane is moving, and she needs to release the bales in such a way that the horizontal distance from the release point to the landing point is 30 meters behind the cattle.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The plane is moving forward at 44.444 m/s. When she drops a bale, it will land at a point that's ahead of the release point by the distance the plane travels during the time the bale is falling. But she wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So maybe the cattle are at some point, and she wants the bales to land 30 meters behind that point. Therefore, she needs to release the bales in front of the cattle so that when the bales fall, they end up 30 meters behind.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the bales land 30 meters behind the point where the plane was when released. Wait, no, I think the problem says the bales should land 30 meters behind the cattle. So, perhaps the cattle are at a certain position, and the plane is moving towards them, but she wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle's position.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's imagine the plane is flying along a path. The rancher wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So, when she releases the bales, the plane is at some point, and the bales will fall to the ground at a point that's a certain distance ahead. But she wants that point to be 30 meters behind the cattle's current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the plane is moving towards the cattle, and she wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle's current position. So, the distance from the release point (where the plane is) to the landing point (30 meters behind the cattle) must be such that the bales land there.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the displacement. Let me clarify:

When the hay bale is released, it has an initial horizontal velocity equal to the plane's speed. The time it takes to fall is 4.04 seconds. So, the horizontal distance it travels while falling is v₀x * t. This is the distance from the release point to where the bale lands.

If the rancher wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle, perhaps the distance from the release point to the landing point should be 30 meters. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the plane is moving forward, so the bale would land ahead of the release point. So if she wants it 30 meters behind, she would have to release it in front of the point where she wants it to land. Wait, no, perhaps the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the bales need to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the distance from the release point (on the plane) to the landing point is the horizontal distance, which is v₀x * t. She wants that landing point to be 30 meters behind the cattle, which are at a certain position. So, perhaps the release point is in front of the cattle, so that when the bale falls, it lands 30 meters behind.

Wait, maybe I should model it differently. Let's say the cattle are at position X. The rancher wants the bales to land at position X - 30 meters. The plane is moving forward, so when she releases the bale at position X, it will land at X + (v₀x * t). But she wants it to land at X - 30. That doesn't make sense because the plane is moving forward, so the bale would land ahead of X.

Wait, perhaps the plane is moving towards the point where the cattle are. Let me think: the plane is moving forward, and the bale is released when the plane is at some point. The bale will land ahead of that point. But the rancher wants it to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So, perhaps the plane is moving towards the position where the cattle are, and she releases the bale such that when the bale lands, it's 30 meters behind the cattle's current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the bales are supposed to land 30 meters behind the point where the plane was when it released them. So, the bale's horizontal displacement is 30 meters behind where it was released, which would require the plane to slow down or something, but that's not the case here. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the bales are supposed to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the distance from the point where the cattle are to where the bales land is 30 meters. Therefore, the bales should land at a point 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the bales are released from the plane, and due to the plane's forward motion and the time it takes for the bales to fall, the horizontal distance from the release point to the landing point is such that the landing point is 30 meters behind the cattle.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider that the bales will land at a point that is (v₀x * t) meters ahead of the release point. The rancher wants that point to be 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the distance between the release point and the landing point is (v₀x * t), and she wants that to be equal to the distance from the release point to the position 30 meters behind the cattle.

Wait, maybe I should model it this way: Let’s say the rancher wants the bales to land at a point that is 30 meters behind the cattle. The distance from the release point (on the plane) to the landing point is (v₀x * t). So, if the release point is at a certain position relative to the cattle, then the landing point will be (v₀x * t) meters ahead of the release point. She wants this landing point to be 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the release point must be such that when you add (v₀x * t) meters, it equals the position 30 meters behind the cattle.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the displacement. Let's imagine the cattle are at position X. The rancher releases the bale when the plane is at position Y. The bale lands at position Z = Y + (v₀x * t). She wants Z = X - 30. So, Y + (v₀x * t) = X - 30. Therefore, Y = X - (v₀x * t) - 30. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps Y is where the plane is when it releases the bale, and Z is where the bale lands. She wants Z to be 30 meters behind the cattle, which are at position X. So, Z = X - 30. Therefore, Y + (v₀x * t) = X - 30. So, Y = X - (v₀x * t) - 30. Hmm, not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the bales are supposed to land 30 meters behind the point where the plane was when released. So, the horizontal displacement would be negative 30 meters, but that's impossible because the plane is moving forward, so the bales would land ahead, not behind.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

"She wanted the bales of hay to land 30 m behind the cattle so as to not hit them. How far behind the cattle should she push the bales out of the airplane?"

Wait, perhaps the bales should land 30 meters behind the cattle, meaning that the distance from the cattle to the landing point is 30 meters. So, the bales need to land 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the plane is moving towards the cattle, and she needs to release the bales in such a way that when they land, they are 30 meters behind the cattle.

Let me try to model this. Let's say the position of the cattle is at point C. The rancher is flying the plane towards the cattle. She wants to release the bale such that when it lands, it's at point L, which is 30 meters behind C (i.e., L = C - 30 meters). The plane is moving at velocity v₀x, so when she releases the bale at position P, the bale will land at point L, which is 30 meters behind C. The time it takes for the bale to fall is t, so the horizontal distance from P to L is v₀x * t. So, P + v₀x * t = L. But L is 30 meters behind C. So, P + v₀x * t = C - 30.

But she wants to know how far behind the cattle she should push the bales out. Wait, perhaps she needs to release the bales from a point that's a certain distance behind the cattle so that when they fall, they land 30 meters behind. Wait, no, because the plane is moving forward. If she releases the bales when the plane is behind the cattle, the bales would land further ahead, possibly past the cattle. But she wants them to land 30 meters behind.

Alternatively, perhaps she needs to release the bales when the plane is in front of the point where she wants the bales to land. Because if she releases the bales when the plane is at point X, the bales will land at X + (v₀x * t). She wants X + (v₀x * t) = C - 30. So, X = C - 30 - (v₀x * t).

Wait, that might make sense. So, the position where she releases the bales (X) is such that when the bale lands, it's at C - 30. So, the distance from X to C - 30 is (v₀x * t). Therefore, X is at C - 30 - (v₀x * t). But that would mean she releases the bales when the plane is (v₀x * t + 30) meters behind the point where she wants them to land. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, let me think again. The bale is released from the plane at point X, which is moving forward at v₀x. The bale will land at X + (v₀x * t). She wants X + (v₀x * t) = C - 30. So, X = C - 30 - (v₀x * t). So, the release point X is (v₀x * t + 30) meters behind the desired landing point. Therefore, she needs to release the bales (v₀x * t + 30) meters behind the point where she wants them to land. Wait, but the point where she wants them to land is 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the release point is (v₀x * t + 30) meters behind the landing point, which is C - 30. So, the release point is (v₀x * t + 30) meters behind C - 30. That would make the release point X = (C - 30) - (v₀x * t + 30) = C - 30 - v₀x * t - 30 = C - 60 - v₀x * t. Hmm, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance she needs to push the bales out of the airplane is how far behind the cattle she should release them. So, she wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle, which are at position C. So, the bales need to land at C - 30. The plane is moving at v₀x, so when she releases the bales at position X, they will land at X + (v₀x * t) = C - 30. So, X = C - 30 - (v₀x * t). Therefore, the distance from X to C is (C - (C - 30 - v₀x * t)) ) = 30 + v₀x * t. So, the plane needs to be 30 + (v₀x * t) meters behind the point where she wants the bales to land (C - 30) when she releases them. Therefore, she should release the bales 30 + (v₀x * t) meters behind the landing point, which is 30 meters behind the cattle.

Wait, but the question is asking how far behind the cattle she should push the bales out of the airplane. So, the release point is X, and the landing point is L = C - 30. The distance from X to L is (v₀x * t), so X = L - (v₀x * t). But L is 30 meters behind C, so X = C - 30 - (v₀x * t). Therefore, the distance from X to C is (C - X) = (C - (C - 30 - v₀x * t)) ) = 30 + v₀x * t meters. So, she needs to release the bales 30 + (v₀x * t) meters behind the cattle. 

Wait, that can't be right because that would mean she's releasing the bales further behind, but the plane is moving forward, so the bales would land further ahead. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me approach it differently.

Suppose the rancher wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle. The bales are released from the plane, which is moving forward at v₀x. The time to fall is t. The horizontal distance the bales travel after release is (v₀x * t). Therefore, the bales will land (v₀x * t) meters ahead of the release point. She wants this landing point to be 30 meters behind the cattle. So, if the release point is R, the landing point is R + (v₀x * t) = C - 30. Therefore, R = C - 30 - (v₀x * t). 

So, the release point R is (v₀x * t + 30) meters behind the desired landing point (C - 30). Therefore, the distance from R to C is (C - R) = (C) - (C - 30 - v₀x * t) ) = 30 + v₀x * t meters. 

So, the rancher needs to release the bales 30 + (v₀x * t) meters behind the cattle. That makes sense because the plane is moving forward, so she needs to release them earlier (behind) so that when they land, they are 30 meters behind.

Wait, let me compute the numbers. Earlier, I found that t ≈ 4.04 seconds, and v₀x ≈ 44.444 m/s. So, v₀x * t ≈ 44.444 * 4.04 ≈ 179.55 meters. So, the distance she needs to push the bales out is 30 + 179.55 ≈ 209.55 meters behind the cattle. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 209.55. The closest option is D: 210 m. So, maybe that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. If she releases the bales 210 meters behind the cattle, then the bales will land 210 + 179.55 meters behind the release point. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the horizontal distance from the release point to the landing point is 179.55 meters. So, if she releases the bales 210 meters behind the cattle, the landing point would be 210 + 179.55 = 389.55 meters behind the cattle, which is way more than 30 meters. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me think again. The bales are released from the plane, which is moving at 44.444 m/s. The time to fall is 4.04 seconds, so the bales will land 44.444 * 4.04 ≈ 179.55 meters ahead of the release point. She wants the landing point to be 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the release point must be such that when the bales land 179.55 meters ahead, that point is 30 meters behind the cattle. So, the release point is (179.55 meters behind the landing point). Since the landing point is 30 meters behind the cattle, the release point is 179.55 meters behind the landing point, which is 30 meters behind the cattle. Therefore, the release point is 179.55 + 30 = 209.55 meters behind the cattle. So, she needs to release the bales 209.55 meters behind the cattle, which is approximately 210 meters. That would make the answer D: 210 m.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because if she releases them 210 meters behind, the bales would land 179.55 meters ahead of that, which would be 210 - 179.55 = 30.45 meters behind the release point. But she wants them to land 30 meters behind the cattle, which is 210 meters behind the release point. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the bales need to land 30 meters behind the cattle, which are at position C. The bales are released from the plane at position R. The distance from R to the landing point L is (v₀x * t) meters. She wants L to be at C - 30. So, R + (v₀x * t) = C - 30. Therefore, R = C - 30 - (v₀x * t). So, the distance from R to C is (C - R) = (C) - (C - 30 - (v₀x * t)) ) = 30 + (v₀x * t). So, the rancher needs to release the bales 30 + (v₀x * t) meters behind the cattle. 

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. Since (v₀x * t) is approximately 179.55 meters, adding 30 gives 209.55 meters, which is about 210 meters. So, the answer should be D:210 m.
</think>

To determine how far behind the cattle the rancher should release the hay bales, we analyze the projectile motion of the bales. The plane flies horizontally at 160 km/hr (approximately 44.444 m/s), and the bales are dropped from a height of 80 m. The time it takes for the bales to fall is calculated using the vertical motion equation:

\[
t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 80}{9.8}} \approx 4.04 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

The horizontal distance the bales travel during this time is:

\[
d = v_{0x} \cdot t = 44.444 \cdot 4.04 \approx 179.55 \, \text{meters}.
\]

The rancher wants the bales to land 30 meters behind the cattle. Therefore, the bales must be released such that their landing point is 30 meters behind the cattle. Since the bales travel 179.55 meters horizontally after release, the release point must be:

\[
30 + 179.55 = 209.55 \, \text{meters}
\]

behind the cattle. Rounding to the nearest option, the correct answer is:

**D: 210 m**

The rancher should release the bales 210 meters behind the cattle to ensure they land 30 meters behind the cattle.

Answer: D
