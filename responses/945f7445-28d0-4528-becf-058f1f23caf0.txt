Question:

A researcher is experimenting with nerve transmission using neurons from a giant squid. At the beginning of the experiment, the axon is at rest and has a threshold measured at –70 mV at 37oC. The axon receives one stimulus that triggers one action potential in the axon. Subsequent stimuli are much stronger. Which of the following statements explains what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon?

Options:

A: The frequency of the action potential increases.
B: The strength of the action potential decreases.
C: The axon becomes depolarized to +50 mV.
D: The axon becomes depolarized to –30 mV.
E: The strength of the action potential becomes greater.
F: The axon becomes hyperpolarized to –100 mV.
G: The frequency of the action potential decreases.
H: The axon becomes hyperpolarized to –90 mV.
I: The axon becomes hyperpolarized to –50 mV.
J: The axon remains at rest at –70 mV despite the stimuli.

Okay, so I have this question about nerve transmission in giant squid neurons. Hmm, I remember that neurons have resting potentials and action potentials. The question says that the axon is at rest with a threshold of –70 mV at 37°C. So, the resting potential is usually around –70 mV, right?

The experiment starts with a stimulus that triggers one action potential. But then the subsequent stimuli are much stronger. I need to figure out what happens when several strong stimuli are applied.

Wait, when a neuron receives a stimulus that's above the threshold, it fires an action potential. The action potential is a rapid depolarization, so the membrane potential goes up, like to around +30 mV or so. But once it fires, there's a refractory period. During the absolute refractory period, the neuron can't fire again no matter how strong the stimulus is. Then, during the relative refractory period, it's harder to get another action potential, but possible with a stronger stimulus.

But in this case, the stimuli are much stronger. So, does that affect how the action potentials behave? Well, the strength of the action potential itself doesn't change because the strength is determined by the sodium and potassium channels opening, not the strength of the stimulus. So the action potential's amplitude should stay the same. So options B and E are about the strength, but E says the strength becomes greater, which I don't think is right. B says the strength decreases, which I also don't think happens.

Now, the frequency of the action potentials. If the stimuli are strong, maybe they can overcome the refractory period more quickly. So the neuron might fire more frequently because each action potential doesn't take as long, or the refractory period is shorter? Wait, no. The refractory period is a fixed time after each action potential where the neuron can't respond, regardless of stimulus strength. So stronger stimuli can't make the absolute refractory period shorter, but maybe the relative refractory period could be. So, perhaps after the first action potential, the next stimulus comes in before the refractory period is over. But wait, the question says "several strong stimuli" are applied after the first one. So if each stimulus is strong enough, maybe it can cause another action potential after the previous one's refractory period ends.

Alternatively, maybe the strong stimuli cause the axon to depolarize more, but that's not how it works. The action potential is a all-or-none response. Once the threshold is reached, the action potential goes to the same maximum, so the strength doesn't change.

So looking at the options, the frequency would depend on how quickly the next action potential can be initiated. Since the stimuli are stronger, but each action potential still needs to go through its cycle, perhaps the frequency increases because each subsequent stimulus is strong enough to overcome any lingering effects of the refractory period.

Wait, no. The absolute refractory period is when the membrane is in the process of repolarizing and can't fire again. So even with strong stimuli, during that time, no action potential occurs. Once the absolute refractory period is over, the relative refractory period begins, where a stronger stimulus can trigger another action potential. So if the stimuli are strong enough, perhaps the frequency increases because each subsequent stimulus can cause an action potential once the refractory period has passed.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: the strength of the stimulus affects whether the action potential occurs, but once it does, the action potential's characteristics are fixed. So the strength of the action potential (options B and E) remains the same, so those can be eliminated.

So the options left are A, G, about frequency, and the others about membrane potential. The question is about what happens when several strong stimuli are applied. If the axon is repeatedly depolarized, after each action potential, it goes back to resting. But each time, the same threshold must be reached. So the axon would fire each time the stimulus is strong enough, leading to a higher frequency of action potentials.

So the frequency increases. So option A: The frequency of the action potential increases.

Wait, but if the stimuli are much stronger, does that cause any other effects? Like depolarization beyond the resting potential? No, because the resting potential is –70. After firing, the axon returns to –70. So the axon doesn't stay depolarized or hyperpolarized unless something else is happening, like continuous stimulation without enough time for recovery.

Alternatively, if the stimuli are so strong that they cause the membrane to depolarize beyond the threshold repeatedly, but the action potentials are all-or-none. So each time the stimulus is applied, if it's above threshold, an action potential occurs. So the frequency increases because each time, the strong stimulus leads to an action potential once the refractory period is over.

So the correct answer should be A: The frequency of the action potential increases.

When a giant squid axon is at rest with a threshold of –70 mV, a stimulus above this threshold triggers an action potential. The action potential is an all-or-none response, meaning its amplitude is fixed and determined by the sodium and potassium channel dynamics, not the stimulus strength. Therefore, the strength of the action potential remains constant, eliminating options B and E.

The question focuses on the effect of several strong stimuli. After an action potential, the axon enters a refractory period, during which it cannot respond to additional stimuli. The absolute refractory period is a fixed duration where no new action potential can initiate, regardless of stimulus strength. However, once the absolute refractory period ends, the relative refractory period begins, where a stronger stimulus can trigger another action potential. Since the stimuli in this case are much stronger, they can overcome the relative refractory period more effectively, leading to an increase in the frequency of action potentials.

Options C, D, F, H, I, and J describe changes in membrane potential or remaining at rest, which are incorrect because the axon returns to its resting potential of –70 mV after each action potential. Option G suggests a decrease in frequency, which contradicts the effect of strong stimuli. Therefore, the correct answer is that the frequency of the action potential increases.
