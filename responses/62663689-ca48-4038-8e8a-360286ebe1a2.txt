Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to estimate the product of 4,286 multiplied by 390. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the best estimate. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll try to break down both numbers into simpler forms to make multiplication easier. Estimation usually involves rounding numbers to their nearest tens, hundreds, or thousands. Let's see, 4,286 is close to 4,300 because 4,286 is just 14 less than 4,300. Similarly, 390 is almost 400 since it's only 10 less than 400.

So, if I round 4,286 up to 4,300 and 390 up to 400, then my multiplication becomes 4,300 × 400. Let me calculate that: 4,300 times 400. Hmm, 4,000 times 400 is 1,600,000. Then, 300 times 400 is 120,000. Adding those together, 1,600,000 + 120,000 equals 1,720,000.

Wait, but I rounded both numbers up. So my estimate is actually higher than the actual product. The original numbers are slightly less than 4,300 and 400, so the real product should be a bit less than 1,720,000. Let me check: 4,286 is 4,300 minus 14, and 390 is 400 minus 10. To get a more accurate estimate, maybe I should adjust for the rounding.

Alternatively, I could consider rounding 4,286 down to 4,200 and 390 down to 380. Let me try that. 4,200 × 380. Hmm, 4,000 × 380 is 1,520,000, and 200 × 380 is 76,000. Adding those gives 1,596,000. 

But wait, 4,286 is closer to 4,300 than to 4,200, and 390 is closer to 400 than to 380. So maybe my initial estimate of 1,720,000 is better, but since both were rounded up, the actual product is between 1,596,000 and 1,720,000.

Looking at the answer options, the choices are:

A: 120,000  
B: 12,000,000  
C: 1,200,000  
D: 16,000  
E: 1,600  
F: 12,000  
G: 160,000  
H: 1,600,000  
I: 1,200  
J: 16,000,000

So, I need to see which of these is closest to my estimates. My first estimate was 1,720,000, which is higher than 1,600,000 (option H) and 1,720k is between H (1.6M) and J (16M). But wait, J is 16,000,000, which is way too high. So H is 1.6M, which is actually pretty close to my upper estimate.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used a different method. Maybe I can approximate 4,286 as 4,000 and 390 as 400. That would make it 4,000 × 400 = 1,600,000, which is exactly option H. But that's a rougher estimate. Alternatively, 4,286 is 4.286 thousand, and 390 is 0.39 thousand. So 4.286 × 0.39 = let's see, 4 × 0.39 is 1.56, and 0.286 × 0.39 is approximately 0.111. Adding those gives around 1.671, so 1.671 thousand × thousand is 1,671,000. That's about 1.67 million, which is close to 1.6 million (option H) and 1.7 million isn't one of the options. So H is 1.6M, which is the closest.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider another approach. Let's calculate 4,000 × 390 first. That's 4,000 × 400 = 1,600,000, minus 4,000 × 10 = 40,000, so 1,600,000 - 40,000 = 1,560,000. Then, 286 × 390. Let's break that down: 200 × 390 = 78,000, and 86 × 390. 80 × 390 = 31,200, and 6 × 390 = 2,340. So 31,200 + 2,340 = 33,540. Adding that to the 78,000 gives 111,540. Now, add that to the 1,560,000: 1,560,000 + 111,540 = 1,671,540.

So the actual product is approximately 1,671,540. Looking at the options, the closest one is H: 1,600,000.

Wait, but option H is 1.6 million, which is about 71,540 less than the actual product. Is there a closer option? Let me check the options again. The options are A through J, with H being 1.6M, and J is 16M, which is way too high. So the next higher option is H, and the next lower would be C: 1.2M, which is much lower. So the best estimate is H.

The best estimate for 4,286 × 390 is approximately 1,600,000, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
