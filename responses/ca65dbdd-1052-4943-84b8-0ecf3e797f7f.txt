Okay, so I have this physics problem about a flywheel and rotational kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that rotational kinetic energy is given by the formula (1/2) I ω², where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity in radians per second. Right.

The problem states the flywheel has a mass of 30 kg and a radius of gyration of 2 meters. I think the radius of gyration (k) is related to the moment of inertia. Oh wait, the formula for moment of inertia when given the radius of gyration is I = m k². So I can calculate I using that.

Let me jot that down. I = m * k². So m is 30 kg, k is 2 m, so I = 30 * (2)^2. That would be 30 *4, which is 120 kg·m². Got that.

Next, I need to find the angular velocity ω. The problem says it's turning at 2.4 revolutions per second. But ω is in radians per second. I remember that one revolution is 2π radians. So ω = 2.4 rev/s * 2π rad/rev.

Calculating that: 2.4 * 2π = 4.8π rad/s. Let me compute that numerically. 4.8 * π is approximately 4.8 * 3.1416. Let me see, 4 * 3.1416 is about 12.5664, and 0.8 *3.1416 is around 2.5133. Adding those together, 12.5664 + 2.5133 = 15.0797 rad/s. So ω ≈ 15.0797 rad/s.

Now plug everything into the kinetic energy formula. KE = (1/2) * I * ω². So that's 0.5 * 120 * (15.0797)^2.

First, calculate (15.0797)^2. Let's see, 15^2 is 225. 0.0797^2 is negligible, but I'll compute it more accurately. Alternatively, I can approximate it as 15.08 squared. Hmm, 15^2 is 225. Then 2*15*0.08 = 2.4, and 0.08^2 is 0.0064. So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So 15.08² = (15 + 0.08)^2 = 225 + 2*15*0.08 + 0.08² = 225 + 2.4 + 0.0064 ≈ 227.4064. Wait, but 15.08 is actually 15 + 0.08, so 15.08 squared is 227.4064. Alternatively, using a calculator approach, 15.08 * 15.08:

15 *15 =225
15*.08=1.2, so 15 *15.08 = 225 + 1.2*15 = 225 +18=243? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should compute it as (15 + 0.08)^2.

Wait, 15.08 * 15.08:

= (15 + 0.08) * (15 + 0.08)
= 15*15 + 15*0.08 + 0.08*15 + 0.08*0.08
= 225 + 1.2 + 1.2 + 0.0064
= 225 + 2.4 + 0.0064 = 227.4064.

So ω² ≈ 227.4064 rad²/s².

Now, KE = 0.5 * 120 * 227.4064.

Let me compute 0.5 * 120 first, which is 60.

So 60 * 227.4064 = ?

Let me compute 60 * 200 = 12,000.

60 * 27.4064 = ?

27.4064 * 60: 27 *60=1620, 0.4064*60≈24.384. So total 1620 +24.384=1644.384.

Adding to 12,000, total KE ≈ 12,000 + 1,644.384 = 13,644.384 Joules.

Looking at the options, option G is 13643.74 J, which is very close to this value. So I think the correct answer is G.

The rotational kinetic energy is calculated using the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \). The moment of inertia \( I = m k^2 = 30 \times 2^2 = 120 \, \text{kg·m}^2 \). The angular velocity \( \omega = 2.4 \times 2\pi \approx 15.0797 \, \text{rad/s} \). Substituting these values, \( KE = 0.5 \times 120 \times (15.0797)^2 \approx 13,644.38 \, \text{J} \), which matches option G.

Answer: G
