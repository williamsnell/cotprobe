Okay, so I've got this question about migration and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking about the tendency for migration to decrease with distance. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to remember what I know about migration patterns. Migration can be influenced by various factors, both push and pull. Push factors are things that make people leave their current location, like lack of jobs or political instability. Pull factors are the attractions that bring people to a new place, such as better job opportunities or climate.

But the question isn't about push or pull factors directly; it's about the tendency decreasing with distance. So I'm thinking this relates more to how far people are willing to move. I remember something about distance decay in geography. Distance decay refers to the idea that the farther away a place is, the less influence it has. In migration terms, this would mean that people are more likely to move to places that are closer rather than farther away.

Looking at the options, E is "distance decay." That seems to fit. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. 

Option A is push factors, which is about why people leave, not why they might stop moving further. Option B is geographic isolation, which is more about being cut off geographically, not directly about migration decreasing with distance. Option C is migration diffusion, which I think is about how migration spreads over time, not about distance. Option D is spatial distribution, which is more about where things are located rather than the pattern of movement. Option F is demographic transition, which relates to changes in population structure over time, not distance. Option G is pull factors, which again is about attracting people, not the distance effect. Option H is gravity model, which I think is a model used to predict the movement of people or goods based on factors like population and distance. Option I is migration selectivity, which might refer to who is more likely to migrate, not the distance aspect. Option J is friction of distance, which I think is the idea that as distance increases, certain costs or difficulties (friction) make movement less likely.

So, while friction of distance (J) also relates to the idea that distance affects migration, the term "distance decay" (E) is more directly about the decrease in migration rates as distance increases. Therefore, the correct answer should be E: distance decay.

The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called distance decay, which directly relates to the concept that as distance increases, the likelihood of migration decreases. 

Answer: E
