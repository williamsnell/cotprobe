Okay, so I've got this physics question here about waves on a pond. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on wave concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is: A rock drops onto a pond with a smooth surface. A few moments later, the wave produced by the rock's impact arrives at the shore, touching the ankles of a wading child. Which observation shows that the portion of the wave hitting the child carries less energy than when it was first created?

The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when a wave travels, especially in a medium like water, it can lose energy due to factors like friction and the spreading out of the wave. So the energy of the wave should decrease as it moves away from the source. When the wave hits the shore, it probably dissipates even more energy, maybe causing turbulence or splashing.

The question is specifically about the energy when the wave hits the child's ankles compared to when it was first created. So, the wave has traveled some distance, and we're looking for an effect that indicates lower energy.

Let me think about each option:

A: The wave has become more turbulent. Turbulence usually means more mixing and energy loss, right? But I'm not sure if increased turbulence directly correlates with less energy in the wave. Turbulence might be a result of the wave interacting with the shore or obstacles, not necessarily a direct measure of energy loss in the wave itself.

B: The wave has split into multiple smaller waves. This could happen due to interference or reflection when the wave hits the shore. But does that mean the energy is less? Well, energy can be distributed among the smaller waves. So maybe, but I'm not certain if this is the best indicator of the wave's energy decrease.

C: The wave pulse’s width has become greater. Wait, the pulse width increasing. I think that when a wave spreads out, like in a circular wave, the amplitude decreases because the same energy is spread over a larger area. So a wider wave would have a smaller amplitude, meaning less energy. Because energy is related to the square of the amplitude. So if the width increases, the amplitude (height) decreases, leading to less energy.

D: The wave's height has become greater. That doesn't make sense. When a wave travels, it usually loses energy, causing the height to decrease, not increase. Unless there's some focusing, but that's not the case here. So D is probably incorrect.

E: The wave is moving more slowly. Wave speed in water is generally determined by the medium and the wave type. For deep water waves, speed depends on depth and wavelength. If the wave slows down, maybe because it's in shallower water, but I'm not sure if that's directly because of energy loss. The speed change is more about the medium than energy; energy loss would affect amplitude, not speed as much.

F: The wave pulse’s width has become smaller. That would mean the wave is more localized, maybe higher amplitude, which would imply more energy. But since the wave is traveling, it should spread out, increasing width, not decreasing. So F is probably incorrect.

G: The wave's speed has increased. That seems unlikely. As waves approach the shore, they usually slow down because water depth decreases. So G is probably wrong.

H: The wave’s height has become smaller. Height relates to amplitude, and energy is proportional to the square of amplitude. So if the height is smaller, the energy is less. That seems like a good indicator. But wait, the question is about the portion of the wave hitting the child. So when the wave arrives at the shore, it's probably breaking or doing something else. But the height being smaller would directly indicate less energy.

I: The temperature of the water has changed. That seems unrelated. Unless the energy is being dissipated as heat, but that's a very indirect effect and probably negligible on the timescale mentioned. So I don't think this is the right answer.

J: The wave's color has changed. Color relates to wavelength, and I'm not sure how that ties into energy loss. Maybe if the wave is refracting or reflecting, but I don't think color change is a direct indicator of energy loss.

Now, looking back at the options, both C and H seem relevant. Let's think again: the question is about the energy when the wave hits the child. The wave has traveled some distance, so it has spread out. So the width (C) has increased, which would mean the amplitude is lower because the same energy is spread over a larger area. So the energy per unit area is less, leading to lower energy in the portion that hits the child.

Alternatively, H says the wave's height has become smaller. That also indicates lower amplitude, which correlates with lower energy. So both C and H are pointing towards lower energy.

But the question is about the portion hitting the child. So when the wave arrives at the shore, it's probably a smaller height. But the spreading (wider pulse) would also contribute to lower energy per unit area at the point of impact.

Wait, but when the wave is spreading out, the part that reaches the child is a small portion. So the amplitude of that part would be lower because the energy is spread out. So the width (C) increasing would mean each part has less energy. So the height (H) would be smaller.

But wait, the wave's height as a whole would decrease, but when it hits the shore, it's the part that's reaching the child's ankles. So perhaps the height has decreased, making H the correct answer.

Alternatively, the wave's pulse width being greater (C) could mean that each part of the wave has a lower amplitude because the energy is spread over a larger area. So the energy per unit area is less.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused now. Let me clarify: the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude. If the wave spreads out, the amplitude decreases because the same energy is distributed over a larger area. So the height (amplitude) decreases, which is option H. Alternatively, the pulse width (which I think refers to the spatial extent of the wave) increases, which is option C.

Wait, but the question is about the portion of the wave that hits the child. So it's not about the entire wave's height, but the part that reaches the child. So maybe the wave has spread out, so each part has less energy. That would be indicated by the pulse width becoming greater (C). Or the height (H) being smaller.

I think both C and H could be correct, but looking back at the options, the question is about the portion hitting the child. So the part that hits the child would have less energy, which could be because the wave's height is smaller (H), or because the wave is wider, so each part has less energy (C).

Wait, but the question is about the energy carried by the portion hitting the child. So if the wave is wider, each part (like the part that reaches the child) has less energy because the total energy is spread over a larger area.

So the correct observation would be that the wave pulse's width has become greater (C), meaning each part has less energy.

Alternatively, the height has become smaller (H), which also indicates less energy.

Wait, but the question is about the portion that hits the child. So perhaps the height of that specific portion is lower. Or maybe the spreading is the main factor.

I think the main factor here is the spreading of the wave, which causes the amplitude to decrease. So the wave's width increases, leading to lower energy in each part. So option C would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The energy of the wave when it's created is higher. As it travels, it spreads out, so the amplitude decreases, and the wave's height decreases. So the height being smaller (H) is a direct measure of lower energy.

Alternatively, the width increasing (C) is about the spatial extent. The wave becomes broader, so each point in the wave has less energy because the same energy is spread over a larger area.

So both H and C could be correct, but which one is the best answer?

The question is which observation provides evidence that the portion hitting the child carries less energy. So the child's ankles are hit by a part of the wave. If the wave's height is smaller when it reaches the shore, that part has less energy. Alternatively, if the wave is wider, each part (like the part hitting the child) has less energy.

I think both H and C are correct, but looking at the options, the answer is probably H. Because the height being smaller directly relates to the energy of the wave. The energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude (height). So if the height is smaller, the energy is less.

Wait, but the wave's height might not be the same everywhere. When the wave spreads, the height decreases because the same energy is spread over a larger area. So the height being smaller would indicate lower energy in that portion.

But the question is about the portion hitting the child, which is a small part of the wave. If the wave has spread out, the part that hits the child would have a smaller amplitude, leading to a lower height. So H would be correct.

Alternatively, the pulse width (C) increasing would mean the wave is broader, but the part hitting the child would still have a certain height. So maybe H is the better answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm mixing up the concepts of pulse width and amplitude. Let me clarify: the pulse width refers to how wide the wave is in space, while the height is the amplitude. So if the wave spreads out, the width increases, but the amplitude (height) at any point decreases.

So the observation that the wave's height has become smaller (H) would directly indicate that the energy is less because energy depends on the amplitude squared. So H is the correct answer.

Wait, but the answer options are given, and the correct answer is H. But I'm a bit unsure because I thought C was also a possibility. But I think H is the better choice because the height directly relates to amplitude and energy.

The question asks which observation indicates that the portion of the wave hitting the child’s ankles carries less energy than when the wave was first created. When a wave travels, it spreads out and loses energy due to factors like friction and dispersion. This energy loss causes the wave’s amplitude to decrease, which is directly related to the wave’s height. The energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude, so a smaller height implies less energy. 

Option C suggests the wave pulse’s width has become greater, which indicates spreading but does not directly measure the energy loss of the specific portion hitting the child. Option H, on the other hand, directly correlates with the energy loss, as a smaller height means lower amplitude and thus less energy. Therefore, the best answer is:

**H**

H
