Okay, so I've got this question about chemical substances released by organisms. The question is asking what these substances are called when they cause a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species. The options are A to I, with various terms like auxins, neurotransmitters, enzymes, etc.

Hmm, let me think. I remember from my biology classes that there are different types of chemicals that organisms release. Some are for communication, others for growth, or maybe for defense. The key here is that these chemicals affect others of the same species.

Wait, auxins are plant hormones, right? They help with cell elongation and stuff. So A is probably not the answer.

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals in the nervous system, like between neurons and muscles. But those are more about communication within an organism, not between different individuals. So B might not be it either.

Enzymes are catalysts that speed up reactions. They don't really cause a response in other organisms or even other individuals of the same species. They just help reactions happen. So C is out.

Hormones are chemicals released by endocrine glands that regulate various bodily functions. They can affect other individuals if they're released into the environment, but usually, hormones are more about internal regulation. Wait, but I think pheromones are a type of hormone, but no, pheromones are specifically for communication between individuals.

Pheromones! Right, pheromones are chemicals released by animals to influence the behavior of other animals, usually of the same species. For example, ants release pheromones to trail other ants, or animals marking their territory. So E seems like a strong candidate.

Cytokines are signaling molecules in the immune system. They help cells communicate, especially in immune responses. But again, these are more internal, not between individuals. So F is probably not it.

Antigens are substances that cause an immune response. They are usually foreign to the organism, like bacteria or viruses. So G doesn't fit because the question is about substances from the same species.

Proteins are a broad category, and while some of the options are proteins (like enzymes, neurotransmitters), the question is about a specific term for these signaling chemicals. So H is too general.

Antibodies are proteins that fight pathogens. They're part of the immune system and not related to communication between individuals. So I is out.

So putting it all together, the answer must be E: pheromones. They're the chemicals released by organisms to elicit a response in others of the same species.

The correct answer is E: pheromones. These are chemicals released by organisms to influence the behavior or physiological responses of others in the same species.
