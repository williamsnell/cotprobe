Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I need to figure out the correct pretax income for Mill Co. after some errors were found. Let's see what the problem says.

Mill Co. reported a pretax income of $152,500. But during the audit, two errors were discovered. The first is that the ending inventory was overstated by $30,000. The second is that depreciation expense was understated by $64,000. I need to adjust the original income to find the correct amount.

Hmm, I remember that in accounting, ending inventory is part of the cost of goods sold (COGS). If the ending inventory is overstated, that means COGS is higher than it should be because COGS is calculated as beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. COGS = beginning inventory + purchases - ending inventory. So if ending inventory is overstated (higher than it should be), then COGS is actually lower. Because you subtract a bigger number, which makes COGS smaller. But wait, that's not right. Let me double-check.

Suppose ending inventory is overstated by $30k. So the reported ending inventory is higher than the true amount. So COGS would be calculated as beginning + purchases - overstated ending. But the correct COGS should be beginning + purchases - (ending - 30k). So the reported COGS is (beginning + purchases - overstated ending) = (beginning + purchases - (actual ending +30k)) = (beginning + purchases - actual ending) -30k. So the reported COGS is 30k less than it should be. Because the ending inventory was overstated, COGS is understated by 30k. Wait, that's getting confusing. Let me think differently.

If ending inventory is higher than it should be, that means that the cost of goods sold is lower because you're subtracting a larger number. So if you have more ending inventory, you must have sold less, so COGS is lower. So the reported COGS is understated by $30k. Because the ending inventory was overstated, the COGS is less than it should be. So that means the income is higher than it should be. Because COGS is part of the expenses. So if COGS is understated, that leaves more profit, making pretax income higher.

Wait, but in reality, the ending inventory is too high, which would mean that the company has more inventory than it should, so the cost of goods sold should have been higher. Because if you have more ending inventory, you must have sold less, so COGS is lower. So the reported COGS is lower, which inflates the income. So the original income is too high because they didn't expense enough for COGS. Therefore, to correct it, we need to decrease the income by the amount of the overstatement in COGS.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try with an example. Suppose the correct ending inventory is $100, but they reported $130. So they have $30 extra in ending inventory. COGS is calculated as beginning inventory + purchases - ending inventory. So if ending is higher, COGS is lower. So their COGS is $30k less than it should be. That means their reported COGS is lower, so their expenses are lower, making income higher. So the original income was overstated because they didn't record enough COGS.

So to correct that, we need to subtract the $30k from the income. Because the actual COGS should have been higher by $30k, which would reduce the income.

Now, the second error is depreciation expense was understated by $64,000. Depreciation is an expense, so if it's understated, that means they didn't record enough depreciation. So their expenses are lower, and thus their income is higher than it should be. To correct this, we need to add $64k to the expenses, which will reduce the income by $64k.

So putting it together, the original income is $152,500. But both errors made the income too high. So we need to adjust it down by both $30k (from inventory) and $64k (from depreciation). So total adjustment is $30k + $64k = $94k. So new income is 152,500 - 94,000 = 58,500? Wait, that seems too low. Let me check again.

Wait, no. Let me clarify each error's impact.

First error: Ending inventory overstated by $30k. As above, this leads to COGS being understated by $30k. So the reported COGS is too low, which makes the income too high. Therefore, the correct adjustment is to subtract $30k from the reported income because the income was overstated by that amount.

Second error: Depreciation expense understated by $64k. Since depreciation is an expense, understating it means they didn't record enough expense. So their net income is higher than it should be. Therefore, we need to subtract $64k from the income to correct this.

So the original income is $152,500. We need to subtract both $30k and $64k. So total adjustment is $94k. So 152,500 - 94,000 = 58,500. Wait, but looking at the options, H is $58,500. But that seems quite low. Let me check if I got the direction right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the direction wrong for the inventory. Let me think again. If ending inventory is overstated, COGS is understated. So the reported COGS is lower than it should be. That would make income higher than it should be. So to correct, we need to increase COGS by $30k, which would reduce income by $30k.

Similarly, depreciation was understated, so we need to increase depreciation by $64k, which would reduce income by another $64k. So total reduction is 30k +64k=94k. So 152,500 -94,000=58,500. So the correct income is $58,500, which is option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is $58,500. But let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $208,500

B: $118,500

C: $98,500

D: $168,500

E: $128,500

F: $78,500

G: $186,500

H: $58,500

I: $148,500

J: $246,500

So H is $58,500. That seems low, but according to the calculations, that's correct.
</think>

The correct pretax income is calculated by adjusting the overstated ending inventory and understated depreciation expense. The overstated ending inventory increases the reported pretax income by $30,000, and the understated depreciation expense increases it by $64,000. Subtracting both adjustments from the original income gives $58,500.

Answer: H
