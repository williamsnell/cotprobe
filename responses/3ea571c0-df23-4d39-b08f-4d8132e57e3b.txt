The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?

Options:

A: Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
B: No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
C: No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
D: Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a declaratory judgment action. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a law student and two friends were handing out fliers at a mall, protesting U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who told them to stop or face arrest. The next day, they came back and continued, and the police warned them again. The law student left to avoid arrest, but his friends were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering. Now, the law student is suing in federal court for a declaratory judgment about the constitutionality of the statutes. The question is whether the federal court will dismiss his case based on Supreme Court precedent.

The options are from A to J, but the given options are A through D. The question is about whether the court will dismiss his action.

First, I remember that a declaratory judgment is a statement by the court about the constitutionality of a statute without resolving the underlying case. It's often used when someone wants an advance ruling without waiting for a prosecution.

I think the key issue here is whether the law student has standing to bring this action. For standing, he needs to show that he's suffered an injury in fact, that's concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, not hypothetical. Also, the court should be able to provide a remedy.

In this case, the law student was present both days when the police warned them. The police arrested his companions, and he left to avoid arrest. So, he might fear being arrested if he continues. But he's not currently facing prosecution; the arrests were for his companions. 

I remember the case of Ex parte Young, which allows federal courts to enjoin state officials from enforcing unconstitutional statutes. But that's about injunctive relief, not declaratory. For declaratory relief, the standards are similar but not identical.

In the past, courts have sometimes dismissed declaratory judgment actions when the plaintiff's fears of prosecution are too speculative. For example, if the plaintiff hasn't been threatened and there's no indication that prosecution is imminent, the court might find the claim premature.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes, because it interferes with state prosecutions and equity. I think this relates to the Anti-Injunction Act, which generally prohibits federal courts from interfering with state criminal prosecutions. But declaratory judgments are allowed in some circumstances, so I'm not sure if A is correct.

Option B says no, because the plaintiff can seek declaratory relief even without a current threat. I'm not sure about this because without a real threat, maybe it's not ripe.

Option C says no, because the law student can show a genuine threat based on his friends' arrests and warnings. This seems plausible because he's been warned and his friends were arrested, suggesting that enforcement is possible against him too.

Option D says yes, because his fears are speculative. But if he was warned and his friends were arrested, that might make his fear more than speculative.

Wait, in the case of Frothingham v. Mellon, the Supreme Court held that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge a tax because the injury was too remote. Similarly, in this case, the law student's friends were arrested, but he wasn't. So, does that mean his fear is too speculative?

Alternatively, in cases where someone has been threatened with prosecution, they can bring a declaratory judgment. For example, in the case of a person who is told they're under investigation or given warnings, courts have allowed declaratory relief.

Here, the law student received warnings, and his friends were arrested. That could indicate that he is at risk if he continues. So, maybe his fear is genuine and imminent, giving him standing.

But wait, in the past, the Supreme Court has said that a person must show more than a mere fear of a future prosecution; there needs to be a threat of enforcement. For example, in the case of California v. Carney, the court held that a person who had been cited once could bring a challenge, but if there's no immediate threat, it might be dismissed.

In this case, the police have warned them twice, and the companions were arrested. So, the law student has a plausible fear that if he continues, he might be arrested. That could make his claim ripe for declaratory relief.

So, looking at the options again:

A: Dismiss for interfering with state prosecutions. I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The question is about whether he can get a declaratory judgment, not about interfering with ongoing prosecutions.

B: He can seek declaratory relief without a current threat. I'm not sure; maybe without a current threat, it's not ripe.

C: He can show a genuine threat because his friends were arrested and he was warned. This seems more likely correct because the prior warnings and arrests support his claim of imminent enforcement.

D: Dismiss because fears are speculative. But given the prior actions, the fears aren't speculative.

So, I think the correct answer is C: No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him.

The law student has received warnings from the police and his companions were arrested, which supports a genuine threat of enforcement if he continues his actions. This makes his fear of future arrest more than speculative, providing him with standing to seek a declaratory judgment. Therefore, the federal district court is unlikely to dismiss his action.

Answer: C
