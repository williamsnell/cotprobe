Okay, so I have this question about the mean translational kinetic energy of a single ideal gas molecule in electron volts (eV). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

I remember that for an ideal gas, the average translational kinetic energy per molecule depends on the temperature. The formula, I think, is (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. But wait, the question doesn't give a specific temperature. Oh, wait, maybe it's assuming a standard temperature, like room temperature, which is usually around 300 K. Or perhaps it's a standard value they expect us to know.

Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K. So if I have that, and I plug it into the formula, I can find the mean energy.

So, K = (3/2) * k * T. Let's assume room temperature, maybe 300 K. So plugging the numbers in:

K = (3/2) * (8.617e-5 eV/K) * 300 K.

Calculating that: 3/2 is 1.5. Multiply by 8.617e-5 gives 1.5 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 1.29255e-4. Then multiply by 300: 1.29255e-4 * 300 ≈ 0.0387765 eV.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.038. That's close. Alternatively, if the temperature is taken as 298 K, which is about 25 degrees Celsius, let me recalculate quickly.

At 298 K: 1.5 * 8.617e-5 * 298 ≈ 1.5 * (8.617e-5 * 298). Let's compute 8.617e-5 * 298 first. 8.617 * 298 = let's see, 8.617 * 300 is about 2585.1, subtract 8.617*2=17.234, so 2585.1-17.234=2567.866. So 2567.866e-5 is 0.02567866. Then multiply by 1.5: 0.02567866 * 1.5 ≈ 0.038518. So approximately 0.0385 eV, which still rounds to 0.038, so option D.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that at room temperature, the average kinetic energy is about 0.03 eV. So that matches option D. Let me think if I'm missing anything else.

Another thought: Are we considering the translational part only? Oh yes, because the question specifies translational kinetic energy. For a monatomic gas, the total kinetic energy is all translational, but for diatomic or polyatomic, the formula is different. But the question says "single ideal gas molecule," so I think the formula (3/2)kT still holds because it's translational only. Or wait, no, the (3/2)kT is the translational part for any ideal gas molecule regardless of being diatomic or not. Because for diatomic, the total energy includes rotational and vibrational, but the translational part is still (3/2)kT.

So yeah, that formula should be correct. So with T around 300 K, we get about 0.038 eV, which is option D.

The mean translational kinetic energy of a single ideal gas molecule is given by the formula \( \frac{3}{2}kT \), where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin. Assuming a standard room temperature of approximately \( 300 \, \text{K} \), the calculation yields:

\[
K = \frac{3}{2} \times 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \times 300 \, \text{K} \approx 0.0387765 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This value closely matches option D, \( 0.038 \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
