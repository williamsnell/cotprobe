Answer:
    
<think>
Alright, so I have this problem about finding the all-day efficiency of a transformer. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the transformer is 5 kVA, which I think stands for kilovolt-amperes. It's supplying a lighting load. 

The problem says it operates at full load for 1% of the day. Wait, 1% of 24 hours is... let me calculate that. 24 hours times 1% is 0.24 hours. Then, it runs at half load for 1 and a half hours. So that's 1.5 hours. The rest of the day, which must be 24 minus 0.24 minus 1.5, so 24 - 1.74 = 22.26 hours, the transformer is idle, meaning no load.

The iron loss is given as 200 watts. Iron loss, I remember, is the loss in the transformer when it's under no load, right? It's also called core loss because it's due to the magnetic losses in the core. And the full-load copper loss is 200 watts. Copper loss is the I²R loss, which depends on the current through the windings. At full load, the current is maximum, so that's when copper loss is highest.

Efficiency is generally calculated as (Output Power) / (Input Power) times 100%. But since we're dealing with all-day efficiency, I need to calculate the total output energy and total input energy over the entire day and then find the efficiency.

Let me outline what I need to do:

1. Calculate the total output energy for the day.
2. Calculate the total input energy for the day.
3. Divide the total output by total input and multiply by 100 to get the efficiency percentage.

First, let's handle the output energy. The transformer's output power depends on its load. When it's at full load, it's delivering 5 kVA. But since it's a transformer, the output power in kilovolt-amperes is the same as the input, assuming ideal conditions (no losses). Wait, but for efficiency, I think I need to consider the actual power delivered, which would be the output power minus the losses. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Wait, no. Efficiency is Output Power divided by Input Power. So, Output Power is the power delivered to the load, and Input Power is the power taken from the source, which includes both the output and the losses.

So, the output power when the transformer is loaded is the power delivered. At full load, the output power is 5 kVA, but wait, that's apparent power (kVA). For efficiency, we should consider real power (kW), which depends on the power factor. But the problem doesn't mention the power factor, so maybe we can assume it's unity (cosθ = 1). That would make the real power equal to the apparent power. So, 5 kVA = 5 kW when power factor is 1. But wait, transformers usually have a certain power factor, but without that info, maybe I can proceed with kVA as the power.

Wait no, that's not right. Power in transformers is typically given in kVA, which is the apparent power. To get real power (kW), we need the power factor. Since it's a lighting load, I think the power factor is around 0.8 or 0.9. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify it. Maybe I can assume it's unity for simplicity. Or perhaps it's better to proceed using kVA for both input and output, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all power in watts, so I can work with that.

Wait, the iron loss is 200 watts, and the copper loss at full load is 200 watts. So when the transformer is at full load, the total losses are 200 (iron) + 200 (copper) = 400 watts. So the input power at full load would be Output Power + Losses. But wait, the output power at full load is 5 kVA, which is 5000 VA. But VA isn't watts, so I need to convert that to watts. If I assume a power factor of 1, then 5000 VA = 5000 W. So Input Power = Output Power + Losses = 5000 + 400 = 5400 W. So efficiency at full load would be (5000 / 5400) * 100 ≈ 92.59%.

But wait, the problem is asking for all-day efficiency, not the efficiency at different loads. So I need to calculate the total output energy and the total input energy over the entire day.

Let me structure it:

Total Output Energy = (Full Load Power * Time at Full Load) + (Half Load Power * Time at Half Load) + (No Load Power * Time at No Load)

But at no load, the transformer isn't delivering any power to the load, so Output Power is zero. So only the first two terms matter.

But what's the Output Power at half load? At half load, the kVA would be 2.5 kVA, assuming the kVA scales with load. So if the full load is 5 kVA, half load is 2.5 kVA. Again, assuming power factor of 1, that's 2500 W. So Output Power at half load is 2500 W.

Now, the time periods: 0.24 hours at full load, 1.5 hours at half load, and 22.26 hours at no load.

So, Total Output Energy = (5000 W * 0.24 h) + (2500 W * 1.5 h) + (0 W * 22.26 h) = (1200 Wh) + (3750 Wh) = 4950 Wh. That's 4.95 kWh.

Now, the input energy. Input Energy = Output Energy + Total Losses.

Wait, no. The input energy is the sum of the output energy plus the losses during each period. So I need to calculate the losses during each period.

Losses consist of iron loss and copper loss. Iron loss is constant regardless of load (assuming it's the same as no load condition), but copper loss depends on the load.

At full load: copper loss is 200 W. So total loss is 200 (iron) + 200 (copper) = 400 W.

At half load: copper loss would be (I²R at half load). Since copper loss is proportional to I², and at full load it's 200 W, at half load, the current is half, so I² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 times. So copper loss at half load is 200 * 0.25 = 50 W. So total loss at half load is 200 (iron) + 50 (copper) = 250 W.

At no load: copper loss is zero because current is zero. So total loss is just iron loss, 200 W.

So now, calculate the input energy for each period.

At full load (0.24 h): Input Power = Output Power + Losses = 5000 W + 400 W = 5400 W. Input Energy = 5400 W * 0.24 h = 1296000 Wh = 1296 kWh.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5400 W is 5.4 kW. 5.4 kW * 0.24 h = 1.296 kWh.

Similarly, at half load (1.5 h): Input Power = Output Power + Losses. Output Power is 2500 W, Losses are 250 W. So Input Power is 2500 + 250 = 2750 W. Input Energy = 2750 W * 1.5 h = 4125 Wh = 4.125 kWh.

At no load (22.26 h): Input Power is just iron loss, 200 W. So Input Energy = 200 W * 22.26 h = 4452 Wh = 4.452 kWh.

So total Input Energy = 1.296 kWh + 4.125 kWh + 4.452 kWh = 9.873 kWh.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1.296 + 4.125 is 5.421, plus 4.452 is 9.873. But the Output Energy was 4.95 kWh. So efficiency would be Output / Input = 4.95 / 9.873 ≈ 0.501, which is about 50%. But that's not one of the options. The options are 75%, 90%, 80%, 68.5%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of input energy. Let me double-check.

Wait, the input energy is the sum of the output energy plus the total losses. Alternatively, for each period, input energy is (output power + losses) multiplied by time.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the input energy as the sum over each time period of (output power + losses during that period) multiplied by time.

Let me try that again.

Full load period:
Output Power: 5000 W
Losses: 400 W
Time: 0.24 h
Input Energy: (5000 + 400) * 0.24 = 5400 * 0.24 = 1296 Wh = 1.296 kWh

Half load period:
Output Power: 2500 W
Losses: 250 W
Time: 1.5 h
Input Energy: (2500 + 250) * 1.5 = 2750 * 1.5 = 4125 Wh = 4.125 kWh

No load period:
Output Power: 0 W
Losses: 200 W
Time: 22.26 h
Input Energy: (0 + 200) * 22.26 = 200 * 22.26 = 4452 Wh = 4.452 kWh

Total Input Energy: 1.296 + 4.125 + 4.452 = 9.873 kWh
Total Output Energy: 5000 * 0.24 + 2500 * 1.5 = 1200 + 3750 = 4950 Wh = 4.95 kWh

Efficiency = (4.95 / 9.873) * 100 ≈ 50.1%. Hmm, that's not matching any options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of copper loss at half load. Let me think again. The copper loss at full load is I²R = 200 W. At half load, the current is half, so I² is (I/2)^2 = I²/4. So copper loss is 200 / 4 = 50 W. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that the actual output power isn't just the kVA times the time, but that the transformer's output power is at the secondary side, and the input is at the primary side. Wait, but for the purpose of efficiency, it's Output Power divided by Input Power, so I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the losses differently. Because when the transformer is at no load, the iron loss is 200 W, which is the same regardless of the load. So maybe I should compute the total losses as:

Total Iron Loss = 200 W * total time = 200 * 24 = 4800 Wh
Total Copper Loss = copper loss at full load * time at full load + copper loss at half load * time at half load + 0 * no load time.

So:

Copper Loss = (200 * 0.24) + (50 * 1.5) + (0 * 22.26) = 48 + 75 + 0 = 123 Wh

Total Losses = Iron Loss + Copper Loss = 4800 + 123 = 4923 Wh = 4.923 kWh

Total Output Energy = 5000 * 0.24 + 2500 * 1.5 = 1200 + 3750 = 4950 Wh = 4.95 kWh

So total Input Energy = Output + Losses = 4.95 + 4.923 = 9.873 kWh. Which is the same as before. So efficiency is 4.95 / 9.873 ≈ 50%, which still doesn't match any options.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the output power. Let's think again. The transformer is 5 kVA, but when it's at full load, the output power is 5 kVA, but that's apparent power. The real power depends on the power factor. Since it's a lighting load, maybe the power factor is 0.8 or 0.9.

Let me assume a power factor of 0.8 for the lighting load. So at full load, real power is 5 kVA * 0.8 = 4 kW. At half load, the power factor might be the same, so 2.5 kVA * 0.8 = 2 kW.

Now, let's recalculate the Output Energy:

Full load: 4000 W * 0.24 h = 960 Wh
Half load: 2000 W * 1.5 h = 3000 Wh
Total Output Energy = 960 + 3000 = 3960 Wh = 3.96 kWh

Now, the Input Energy. Let's calculate losses again.

At full load: copper loss 200 W, iron loss 200 W. Input Power = 4000 + 400 = 4400 W. Input Energy = 4400 * 0.24 = 1056 Wh = 1.056 kWh

At half load: copper loss 50 W, iron loss 200 W. Input Power = 2000 + 250 = 2250 W. Input Energy = 2250 * 1.5 = 3375 Wh = 3.375 kWh

At no load: copper loss 0, iron loss 200 W. Input Energy = 200 * 22.26 = 4452 Wh = 4.452 kWh

Total Input Energy = 1.056 + 3.375 + 4.452 = 8.883 kWh

Efficiency = (3.96 / 8.883) * 100 ≈ 44.5%. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the power factor assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the output power as 5 kVA, not considering the power factor. Let me try without considering power factor, so output power is 5 kVA = 5000 W, and half load is 2500 W.

Then, Output Energy is 5000 * 0.24 + 2500 * 1.5 = 1200 + 3750 = 4950 Wh = 4.95 kWh.

Input Energy:

Full load: (5000 + 400) * 0.24 = 5400 * 0.24 = 1296 Wh
Half load: (2500 + 250) * 1.5 = 2750 * 1.5 = 4125 Wh
No load: 200 * 22.26 = 4452 Wh
Total Input Energy = 1296 + 4125 + 4452 = 9873 Wh = 9.873 kWh

Efficiency = 4950 / 9873 ≈ 0.501, or 50.1%, which is about 50%, but that's not an option. The closest option is D: 68.5%, but that's not close to 50.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem states: "the transformer would, in a normal day's run, operate at full load 1% hours and perhaps at half load 1(1/2) hours? during the rest of the day there would be no load on the transformer."

Wait, 1% of a day is 0.24 hours, which is 14.4 minutes. Then 1.5 hours at half load, and the rest 22.26 hours at no load.

Wait, but the problem says "1% hours"—maybe that's a typo and should be 1 hour? Or perhaps it's 1% of the day? Because 1% of 24 hours is 0.24 hours. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total time. Let me check.

Total time: 0.24 + 1.5 + 22.26 = 24 hours exactly. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating copper loss at half load. Let me double-check.

At full load, copper loss is 200 W. At half load, the current is half, so I² is (I/2)^2 = I²/4. So copper loss is 200 / 4 = 50 W. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is to calculate the annual efficiency, but no, it's all-day.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the average efficiency, but that's similar to what I did.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the periods when the transformer is under load, but that doesn't make sense because the question says "all-day" efficiency, which should include all periods.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm adding the output and the losses, but efficiency is Output / (Output + Losses). So for each time period, I should compute (Output during that period) / (Output + Losses during that period), then find the weighted average.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me try that.

So, for each period, calculate the efficiency during that time, then find the total efficiency based on the time spent.

But that's more complicated. Let me consider each time period.

First, full load for 0.24 hours:

Efficiency = Output Power / Input Power = 5000 W / (5000 + 400) = 5000 / 5400 ≈ 0.9259 or 92.59%

Energy saved: 5000 * 0.24 = 1200 Wh, and Input Energy is 5400 * 0.24 = 1296 Wh.

Similarly, for half load:

Efficiency = 2500 / (2500 + 250) = 2500 / 2750 ≈ 0.9091 or 90.91%

Energy: Output is 2500 * 1.5 = 3750 Wh, Input is 2750 * 1.5 = 4125 Wh.

For no load:

Efficiency = 0 / 200 = 0%. But during no load, the transformer is consuming 200 W, but delivering nothing, so efficiency is zero.

Now, total Output Energy is 1200 + 3750 = 4950 Wh.

Total Input Energy is 1296 + 4125 + (200 * 22.26) = 1296 + 4125 + 4452 = 9873 Wh.

Efficiency = 4950 / 9873 ≈ 50.1%.

Hmm, same result. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for annual efficiency, but the problem says "all-day" efficiency. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the efficiency differently, perhaps using average load.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the periods when the transformer is under load, but that doesn't make sense for all-day efficiency.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transformer's efficiency as the average over the day, but that's what I did.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using kVA as kW, but that's incorrect. Let me correct that.

At full load, the output is 5 kVA. Assuming a power factor of 0.8, the real power is 5 * 0.8 = 4 kW. So Output Power is 4000 W.

Similarly, at half load, the output is 2.5 kVA, real power is 2.5 * 0.8 = 2000 W.

So Output Energy:

Full load: 4000 * 0.24 = 960 Wh
Half load: 2000 * 1.5 = 3000 Wh
Total Output: 3960 Wh

Now, Input Energy:

Full load: (4000 + 400) * 0.24 = 4400 * 0.24 = 1056 Wh
Half load: (2000 + 250) * 1.5 = 2250 * 1.5 = 3375 Wh
No load: 200 * 22.26 = 4452 Wh
Total Input: 1056 + 3375 + 4452 = 8883 Wh

Efficiency: 3960 / 8883 ≈ 0.445, or 44.5%. Still not matching any options.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to calculate the annual efficiency, but the question is about all-day.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the periods when the transformer is under load, but that's not the case. The question includes all periods.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that during no load, the transformer's input power is zero? No, that's not correct. During no load, the transformer still has iron losses, so it's consuming 200 W.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total losses and total output, then find efficiency as (total output) / (total input).

Total Output: 5 kVA * 0.24 h + 2.5 kVA * 1.5 h = (5 * 0.24) + (2.5 * 1.5) = 1.2 + 3.75 = 4.95 kVAh. But that's apparent power, not real power. So I'm back to the same issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the power factor, treating kVA as kW. Let me try that.

So, Output Power:

Full load: 5000 W
Half load: 2500 W

Output Energy: 5000 * 0.24 + 2500 * 1.5 = 1200 + 3750 = 4950 Wh

Losses:

Full load: 400 W * 0.24 h = 96 Wh
Half load: 250 W * 1.5 h = 375 Wh
No load: 200 W * 22.26 h = 4452 Wh
Total Losses: 96 + 375 + 4452 = 4923 Wh

Total Input Energy: 4950 + 4923 = 9873 Wh

Efficiency: 4950 / 9873 ≈ 50.1% → ~50%

But again, no option matches. The options are 75%, 90%, 80%, 68.5%. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the copper loss at full load is 200 W, and the iron loss is 200 W. So when the transformer is at no load, the copper loss is zero, and iron loss is 200 W.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly. So maybe the problem is intended to ignore the copper loss at half load and consider only iron loss? No, that doesn't make sense because copper loss depends on load.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that copper loss at half load is the same as at full load, which would be incorrect, but let's try.

If copper loss at half load is 200 W, then:

At half load, total loss is 200 (iron) + 200 (copper) = 400 W.

So Input Power at half load would be 2500 + 400 = 2900 W.

So Input Energy:

Full load: 5400 * 0.24 = 1296 Wh
Half load: 2900 * 1.5 = 4350 Wh
No load: 200 * 22.26 = 4452 Wh
Total Input: 1296 + 4350 + 4452 = 9998 Wh ≈ 9.998 kWh

Output Energy: 5000 * 0.24 + 2500 *1.5 = 1200 + 3750 = 4950 Wh

Efficiency: 4950 / 9998 ≈ 49.5%. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the transformer's efficiency is calculated based on the load periods only, ignoring the no-load periods. Let me try that.

So, time under load is 0.24 + 1.5 = 1.74 hours.

Total Output Energy: 4950 Wh

Total Input Energy during load:

Full load: 5400 * 0.24 = 1296 Wh
Half load: 2750 * 1.5 = 4125 Wh
Total Input during load: 1296 + 4125 = 5421 Wh

Efficiency during load: 4950 / 5421 ≈ 91.3%. But that's not the all-day efficiency.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the average efficiency as (total output) / (total input), which would be 4.95 kWh / 9.873 kWh ≈ 50%, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another approach. Perhaps the problem is intended to find the average efficiency over the day, considering the transformer's losses.

Another approach: calculate the efficiency for each time period, then find the weighted average based on the time spent.

So:

1. Full load: 0.24 h, efficiency ≈92.59%
2. Half load: 1.5 h, efficiency≈90.91%
3. No load: 22.26 h, efficiency=0%

Weighted average efficiency = (0.24/24)*92.59% + (1.5/24)*90.91% + (22.26/24)*0%

Calculate each term:

0.24/24 = 0.01 → 0.01 *92.59 ≈0.9259
1.5/24=0.0625 → 0.0625 *90.91≈5.6819
22.26/24≈0.9275 → 0.9275 *0=0

Sum: 0.9259 +5.6819 ≈6.6078%

That's about 6.6%, which is way off the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm. I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is intended to calculate the efficiency based on the transformer's losses over the day, not the actual power delivered.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the transformer's losses are only the iron loss when it's not loaded. So during full load and half load, the losses include both iron and copper, but during no load, only iron loss.

So, total losses:

Full load: 400 W *0.24 h = 96 Wh
Half load:250 W*1.5 h=375 Wh
No load:200 W*22.26 h=4452 Wh
Total Losses=96+375+4452=4923 Wh

Transformer's input power is Output Power + Losses.

But Output Power depends on the load. So:

Full load: Output=5000 W, Losses=400 W, Input=5400 W
Half load: Output=2500 W, Losses=250 W, Input=2750 W
No load: Output=0 W, Losses=200 W, Input=200 W

Total Input Energy:

Full load:5400 *0.24=1296 Wh
Half load:2750 *1.5=4125 Wh
No load:200 *22.26=4452 Wh
Total Input=1296+4125+4452=9873 Wh

Total Output=5000*0.24 +2500*1.5 =1200+3750=4950 Wh

Efficiency=4950/9873≈50.1% → 50%

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "the full-load copper loss (I²R) is 200 watts." So copper loss at full load is 200 W. At half load, copper loss is (I/2)^2 R = (I² R)/4 = 200 /4=50 W. So that's correct.

Iron loss is 200 W, constant.

So, I think my calculations are correct, but the answer isn't matching any options. The closest option is D:68.5%, but I'm not sure how to get that.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the annual efficiency, but the question is about all-day. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the no-load periods, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to find the efficiency at full load and half load, then average them, but that's not all-day efficiency.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the average efficiency based on the transformer's losses as a percentage of its capacity. Let me think.

Transformer's losses per day:

Iron loss: 200 W *24 h=4800 Wh
Copper loss:200 W *0.24 h (full load) +50 W *1.5 h (half load)=48 +75=123 Wh
Total losses:4800+123=4923 Wh

Transformer's input power is Output + losses. Output is 5 kVA when loaded.

But I'm stuck. I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't get an answer matching the options. Perhaps the intended answer is D:68.5%, but I'm not sure how to reach that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the transformer's efficiency at each load and then find the weighted average.

Efficiency at full load:5000/(5000+400)=5000/5400≈92.59%
Efficiency at half load:2500/(2500+250)=2500/2750≈90.91%
Efficiency at no load:0/(0+200)=0%

The time fractions:

Full load:0.24/24=0.01
Half load:1.5/24≈0.0625
No load:22.26/24≈0.9275

Weighted average efficiency=0.01*92.59 +0.0625*90.91 +0.9275*0≈0.9259 +5.6819 +0≈6.6078%. No, that's way too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the no-load periods, but that's not correct for all-day efficiency.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the formula for all-day efficiency.

All-day efficiency is calculated as:

η_all-day = (Total Output Energy) / (Total Input Energy) × 100%

Total Output Energy = P_out1 * t1 + P_out2 * t2
Total Input Energy = P_in1 * t1 + P_in2 * t2 + P_in3 * t3

Where P_in = P_out + Losses.

I think I've done that correctly. So unless I'm making a mistake in calculating the losses, I'm not seeing how to get to the options provided.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that during no load, the transformer doesn't consume any power, which is incorrect, but let's try that.

If during no load, input power is zero, then:

Total Input Energy:

Full load:5400 *0.24=1296 Wh
Half load:2750 *1.5=4125 Wh
No load:0 *22.26=0
Total Input=1296+4125=5421 Wh

Output Energy=4950 Wh

Efficiency=4950/5421≈91.3%. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the time periods and just calculate the efficiency at the given loads, but that's not all-day.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to see if 68.5% is possible. Let me think: 68.5% is option D. How could that happen?

Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is considering the transformer's efficiency as the average of its efficiencies at full and half load, weighted by the time spent.

Efficiency at full load:92.59%
Efficiency at half load:90.91%

Time fractions: 0.24/24=1%, 1.5/24=6.25%, 22.26/24=92.75%

So weighted efficiency: (1% *92.59) + (6.25% *90.91) + (92.75% *0) ≈0.9259 +5.6819≈6.6078%, which is too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the transformer is only loaded for 1% of the day, which is 0.24 hours, and the rest is no load. So:

Efficiency during loaded time:92.59%
Efficiency during no load:0%

So average efficiency= (0.24/24)*92.59% + (23.76/24)*0% ≈(0.01)*92.59≈0.9259%, which is way too low.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the intended answer is D:68.5%, but I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations, but I've checked them multiple times.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the transformer's efficiency is calculated as (Total Output Power)/(Total Input Power) without considering the time periods, but that's not correct. Let me try that.

Total Output Power:5000 +2500=7500 W
Total Input Power:5400 +2750 +200=8350 W
Efficiency=7500/8350≈0.8976 or 89.76%. Closest option is B:90%. But that's not considering the time periods, which is incorrect.

Wait, but that's just the ratio of total output to total input without considering how long each period lasted. So it's not the correct approach, but perhaps the problem expects that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the average efficiency as (average output)/(average input). Let's see:

Average Output Power: (5000*0.24 +2500*1.5 +0*22.26)/24 = (1200 +3750 +0)/24 =4950/24≈206.25 W
Average Input Power: (5400*0.24 +2750*1.5 +200*22.26)/24 = (1296 +4125 +4452)/24 =9873/24≈411.375 W
Efficiency=206.25/411.375≈0.501 or 50.1%

Again, same result.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only way to get to one of the options is to assume that the problem is expecting an answer of approximately 80%, which is option C. But I'm not sure how to get there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the no-load periods and calculate the efficiency based only on the loaded periods. Let's try that.

Total Output during load:4950 Wh
Total Input during load:1296 +4125=5421 Wh
Efficiency=4950/5421≈91.3% → closest option is B:90%, but that's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the transformer's efficiency is the average of full load and half load efficiencies, which would be (92.59 +90.91)/2≈91.75%, still not matching.

I'm really stuck. I think the intended answer is D:68.5%, but I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of losses.

Wait, perhaps the copper loss at half load is 100 W instead of 50 W. Let me check.

If copper loss at half load is 100 W, then:

At half load, copper loss=100 W, total loss=200+100=300 W.

Input Power=2500 +300=2800 W.

Input Energy=2800 *1.5=4200 Wh

Total Input Energy:

Full load:5400 *0.24=1296 Wh
Half load:2800 *1.5=4200 Wh
No load:200 *22.26=4452 Wh
Total Input=1296 +4200 +4452=9948 Wh

Output Energy=5000*0.24 +2500*1.5=1200+3750=4950 Wh

Efficiency=4950/9948≈49.7%. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the copper loss at half load is 150 W.

If copper loss=150 W, total loss=350 W.

Input Power=2500+350=2850 W

Input Energy=2850 *1.5=4275 Wh

Total Input=1296 +4275 +4452=10023 Wh

Efficiency=4950/10023≈49.4%. Still not matching.

I'm really not sure. I think I have to go with my initial calculation of approximately 50%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D:68.5%, but I'm not sure how to reach it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the copper loss at half load.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the copper loss is proportional to the square of the load current, but the load current at half load is half of full load, so copper loss is (I/2)^2 R = I² R /4 = 200 /4=50 W. So that's correct.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll have to go with the calculation I did earlier, which leads me to 50%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D:68.5%, but I'm not sure.

To determine the all-day efficiency of the transformer, we analyze its operation over a 24-hour period. The transformer operates at full load for 1% of the day (0.24 hours), half load for 1.5 hours, and no load for the remaining 22.26 hours. The iron loss is constant at 200 W, while the copper loss depends on the load.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Output Energy**:
   - At full load (5 kVA, assuming power factor = 1):  
     \( 5000 \, \text{W} \times 0.24 \, \text{h} = 1200 \, \text{Wh} \)
   - At half load (2.5 kVA, assuming power factor = 1):  
     \( 2500 \, \text{W} \times 1.5 \, \text{h} = 3750 \, \text{Wh} \)
   - Total Output Energy:  
     \( 1200 + 3750 = 4950 \, \text{Wh} \)

2. **Input Energy**:
   - At full load:  
     \( (5000 + 400) \, \text{W} \times 0.24 \, \text{h} = 5400 \times 0.24 = 1296 \, \text{Wh} \)
   - At half load:  
     \( (2500 + 250) \, \text{W} \times 1.5 \, \text{h} = 2750 \times 1.5 = 4125 \, \text{Wh} \)
   - At no load:  
     \( 200 \, \text{W} \times 22.26 \, \text{h} = 4452 \, \text{Wh} \)
   - Total Input Energy:  
     \( 1296 + 4125 + 4452 = 9873 \, \text{Wh} \)

3. **Efficiency**:
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Total Output Energy}}{\text{Total Input Energy}} \times 100 = \frac{4950}{9873} \times 100 \approx 50.1\%
   \]
