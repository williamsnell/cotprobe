Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that 4.90 grams of KClO3 was heated, and it showed a weight loss of 0.384 grams. I need to find the percent of the original KClO3 that had decomposed. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, right. I remember that when KClO3 decomposes upon heating, it breaks down into KCl and O2. The reaction is something like 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. So, the oxygen is released as gas, which causes the weight loss. That makes sense because the oxygen is leaving the solid, so the mass decreases.

So, the weight loss must be the mass of O2 that was released. Wait, yeah, because KClO3 is losing O2, so the decrease in mass is the mass of O2 produced.

So, the first thing I think I need to do is find out how much O2 was produced. That's given as 0.384 grams.

Next, I should find out how much KClO3 decomposed to produce that O2. Because the decomposition reaction has a molar ratio between KClO3 and O2.

Let me write down the balanced equation again to make sure. It's 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. So, 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2. That means the mole ratio of KClO3 to O2 is 2:3.

So, the moles of O2 can be calculated by dividing the mass by its molar mass. O2 has a molar mass of 32 g/mol (since each O is 16). So, 0.384 g divided by 32 g/mol equals 0.012 moles of O2.

Now, using the mole ratio from the reaction, 3 moles of O2 come from 2 moles of KClO3. So, moles of KClO3 decomposed would be (2/3) * moles of O2. That would be (2/3) * 0.012 = 0.008 moles of KClO3.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 0.012 times 2 is 0.024, divided by 3 is 0.008. Yes, that's right.

Now, I need to find the mass of KClO3 that corresponds to 0.008 moles. The molar mass of KClO3 is K (39.10) + Cl (35.45) + 3 O (16 each). So, 39.10 + 35.45 is 74.55, plus 48 (3*16) makes 122.55 g/mol.

So, 0.008 moles times 122.55 g/mol equals 0.9804 grams. Wait, that's about 0.98 grams of KClO3 decomposed.

But wait, the original mass was 4.90 grams. So, the percentage decomposed would be (0.9804 / 4.90) * 100. Let me calculate that.

0.9804 divided by 4.90 is approximately 0.2, because 4.90 times 0.2 is 0.98. So, 0.2 times 100 is 20%. So, the percent decomposed is 20%, which is option B.

Wait a second, that seems a bit straightforward, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The weight loss is O2: 0.384 g O2.
2. Moles of O2: 0.384 / 32 = 0.012 mol.
3. Moles of KClO3 decomposed: (2/3) * 0.012 = 0.008 mol.
4. Mass of KClO3: 0.008 * 122.55 = 0.9804 g.
5. Percent decomposed: (0.9804 / 4.90) * 100 ≈ 20%.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 20%, which is option B.

The problem involves determining the percentage of KClO3 decomposed upon heating, given a weight loss of 0.384 g. The decomposition reaction is 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2, where the weight loss corresponds to the mass of O2 released. 

1. **Calculate moles of O2**:  
   Moles of O2 = 0.384 g / 32 g/mol = 0.012 mol.

2. **Determine moles of KClO3 decomposed**:  
   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of O2 are produced by 2 moles of KClO3.  
   Moles of KClO3 = (2/3) * 0.012 mol = 0.008 mol.

3. **Find mass of decomposed KClO3**:  
   Molar mass of KClO3 = 122.55 g/mol.  
   Mass of KClO3 = 0.008 mol * 122.55 g/mol = 0.9804 g.

4. **Calculate percentage decomposed**:  
   Percentage = (0.9804 g / 4.90 g) * 100 ≈ 20%.

Thus, the percentage of KClO3 decomposed is **20%**, corresponding to option B.

Answer: B
