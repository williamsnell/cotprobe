Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out how many ways a group of 10 people can be split into three different committees with 3, 4, and 3 people respectively. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with dividing people into groups, combinations are involved because the order within the groups doesn't matter. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether I should use permutations or combinations here, and whether I need to adjust for any overcounting.

Let me start by breaking it down. The group has 10 people, and I need to split them into three committees. The committees are of sizes 3, 4, and 3. So, the first committee will have 3 people, the second 4, and the third another 3. I think the key here is that the order of selecting these committees matters because they are different committees. Or does it? Wait, are the committees distinguishable? The problem says "3 different committees," so I think they are. That probably means that assigning people to Committee A, B, and C matters, so the order does matter in that sense.

But wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify the names of the committees, just that they are different. Hmm, maybe I should assume they are distinguishable based on their sizes. Since two committees have the same size (both 3), maybe I need to account for that to avoid overcounting. Because if two groups are the same size, swapping their members would result in the same grouping, but since they are different committees, maybe that's okay. Wait, no, because they are different committees, so the assignment to each committee is unique. So perhaps I don't need to worry about dividing by anything for the same-sized groups.

Let me think step by step. First, the number of ways to choose the first committee of 3 people from 10. That's 10 choose 3, which is C(10,3). Then, from the remaining 7 people, I choose 4 for the next committee, which is C(7,4). Finally, the last 3 people automatically form the last committee, which is C(3,3) = 1.

So the total number of ways would be C(10,3) * C(7,4) * C(3,3). Let me calculate each of these:

C(10,3) = 120. Because 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10*9*8)/(3*2*1) = 120.

C(7,4) = 35. Because 7! / (4! *3!) = (7*6*5*4)/(4*3*2*1) = 35.

C(3,3) = 1.

So multiplying these together: 120 * 35 = 4200. Then 4200 *1 = 4200.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 4200. So that's one possibility. But wait, I'm not sure if I need to adjust for the fact that the two committees of size 3 are indistinct. Because if I swap the two committees of 3, it's the same grouping. So do I need to divide by 2! to account for that?

Let me think. Because the problem says "3 different committees," but two of them have the same size, so if the committees are not labeled (like Committee 1, Committee 2), then swapping the two size-3 committees wouldn't create a new arrangement. But in the problem, are the committees labeled or just considered different because of their sizes or something else?

Wait, the problem says "3 different committees of 3, 4, and 3 people, respectively." So the sizes are different in the sense that two are 3 and one is 4. So the committees are different based on their sizes. Therefore, the two committees of size 3 are distinguishable because one is paired with the committee of 4. So I don't need to divide by 2! because the groups are considered different based on their size relative to other groups.

Wait, maybe they are considered the same if you just switch the two 3-person committees. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify any labels, so perhaps the order in which we choose the committees doesn't matter beyond their sizes. So maybe the initial approach overcounts because the two committees of 3 are identical in size, and so swapping their members would result in the same grouping, but since they are different committees, perhaps it's not overcounted.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first choose the committee of 4, then the two committees of 3. Because the committee of 4 is unique, so its order is fixed, and the other two can be arranged in any way. Let me see.

Wait, another way to think about this: the total number of ways to split into groups where two groups are the same size is calculated by first choosing the group that's different, and then partitioning the rest. So in this case, the group of 4 is unique, so we can first choose that group, then split the remaining 6 into two groups of 3.

So the calculation would be C(10,4) * C(6,3) * C(3,3). But wait, that's C(10,4) * C(6,3) = 210 * 20 = 4200, same as before. But then, because the two groups of 3 are indistinct, do we need to divide by 2! ?

Wait, because if we have two groups of the same size, the order in which we choose them doesn't matter, so we should divide by 2! to correct for overcounting. So the total would be (C(10,4) * C(6,3) * C(3,3)) / 2!.

Wait, but when I did the first approach, I didn't divide and got 4200, which is one of the options. But this approach would suggest dividing by 2, giving 4200 / 2 = 2100, which is option E.

Hmm, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?

Let me try to clarify the problem. The problem says "split into 3 different committees of 3,4,3." So the committees are different based on their sizes. So the committee of 4 is distinct, and the two committees of 3 are not. Therefore, when I choose the 4-person committee first, then the remaining 6 are split into two groups of 3. Since the two groups of 3 are indistinct, I need to divide by 2!.

So the calculation would be [C(10,4) * C(6,3)] / 2! = (210 * 20) / 2 = (4200)/2 = 2100.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier approach where I didn't divide by 2 and got 4200. So which is correct?

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the committees as distinct because they're labeled as different committees (like Committee A, B, C), but the problem statement doesn't specify labels, just that they're different. So perhaps the correct approach is to not divide by 2! because the committees are considered different based on their size. Therefore, the answer would be 4200.

Wait, but let me think again. When you have groups of the same size, the order in which you select them doesn't matter, so you have to adjust for that. For example, if you have two groups of size 3, selecting group X first and then group Y is the same as selecting group Y first and then group X. So in that case, you would divide by 2!.

So in the first approach, where I selected the first group of 3, then the group of 4, then the last 3, I didn't account for the fact that the two groups of 3 are indistinct, leading to overcounting by a factor of 2!.

So the correct approach is to first select the unique group (the group of 4), then split the remaining 6 into two groups of 3, and since those two are indistinct, divide by 2!.

So the calculation would be [C(10,4) * C(6,3)] / 2! = (210 * 20)/2 = 2100.

Alternatively, another approach: the total number of ways to partition 10 people into groups of sizes 3,4,3 is [10!]/[3!4!3!] divided by the number of ways to arrange the groups that are the same size. Since there are two groups of 3, we divide by 2!.

So the formula would be (10!)/(3!4!3!2!) = ?

Let me compute that: 10! is 3628800. 3! is 6, 4! is 24, another 3! is 6, and 2! is 2.

So denominator is 6 * 24 * 6 * 2 = 6*24=144, 144*6=864, 864*2=1728.

So 3628800 / 1728 = let's compute that.

3628800 ÷ 1728: 

Well, 1728 * 2000 = 3,456,000 which is more than 3,628,800. Wait, wait, 1728 * 2100 = ?

Wait, maybe divide step by step.

First, 3628800 ÷ 1728.

Let me compute 3628800 ÷ 1728:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 3628.8 ÷ 1.728.

Alternatively, compute 3628800 ÷ 1728:

1728 × 2000 = 3,456,000

Subtract from 3,628,800: 3,628,800 - 3,456,000 = 172,800.

Now, 1728 × 100 = 172,800.

So 2000 + 100 = 2100.

So 3628800 ÷ 1728 = 2100.

So that gives 2100, which is option E.

So the correct answer is E: 2100.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated without dividing by 2!, I got 4200, which is option H. So which is correct?

I think the key is whether the two groups of 3 are considered distinct. Since they are committees, they are different because they are part of the split, but since they are the same size, the order in which you assign them doesn't matter. So you have to divide by 2! to account for the overcounting.

Therefore, the correct calculation is 2100, which is option E.
</think>

The problem involves splitting 10 people into three committees of sizes 3, 4, and 3. To calculate the number of ways, we first choose the unique committee of 4, then split the remaining 6 into two groups of 3. Since the two groups of 3 are indistinct, we divide by 2! to avoid overcounting. The formula is [C(10,4) * C(6,3)] / 2! = 2100.

Answer: E
