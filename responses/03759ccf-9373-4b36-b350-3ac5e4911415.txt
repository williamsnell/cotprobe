Okay, so I need to find the maximum height of a model rocket given its trajectory. The trajectory is given by the function c(t) = (80t, 200t - 4.9t²). Hmm, wait, this is a parametric equation where the x-component is 80t and the y-component is 200t - 4.9t². Since I'm looking for the maximum height, I should focus on the y-component because that's the vertical position.

Right, the rocket's height at any time t is y(t) = 200t - 4.9t². To find the maximum height, I remember that for a quadratic function like this, the vertex gives the maximum or minimum point. Since the coefficient of t² is negative (-4.9), the parabola opens downward, which means the vertex will be the maximum point.

The general form of a quadratic equation is y = at² + bt + c. In this case, a is -4.9 and b is 200. The time t at which the maximum height occurs is given by the vertex formula: t = -b/(2a). Plugging in the values, that would be t = -200/(2*(-4.9)).

Let me calculate that. The denominator is 2*(-4.9) which is -9.8. So t = -200 / (-9.8) = 200/9.8. Let me compute that division. 200 divided by 9.8. Hmm, 9.8 times 20 is 196, so 20 is about 200/9.8 ≈ 20.408 seconds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 9.8 times 20 is 196, so 200 - 196 is 4, so 4/9.8 is approximately 0.408. So t ≈ 20.408 seconds.

Wait, that seems a bit high for a model rocket's flight, but maybe it's correct. Anyway, moving on. Now, I need to plug this value of t back into the y(t) equation to find the maximum height.

So y(t) = 200t -4.9t². Let me compute each term. First, 200 * t. So 200 * 20.408 is 4081.6 meters? That can't be right. Wait, that seems way too high for a model rocket. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, 200t with t≈20.408 would be 200*20.408 = 4081.6 meters. Then subtract 4.9*(20.408)^2.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me check the calculations again because maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating t. Let me re-calculate t. t = -b/(2a), where a = -4.9 and b = 200. So t = -200/(2*(-4.9)) = -200 / (-9.8) = 200/9.8. Let me compute 200 divided by 9.8 accurately.

Let's see: 9.8 * 20 = 196.0, so 196 is 20 * 9.8. 200 - 196 = 4, so 4 / 9.8 ≈ 0.408163. So t ≈ 20.408163 seconds. That's correct.

Now, let's compute y(t) at t=20.408163. So y = 200*(20.408163) -4.9*(20.408163)^2.

First, 200 * 20.408163 = 4081.6326 meters.

Next, compute (20.408163)^2. Let's calculate that. 20^2 is 400. 0.408163^2 is approximately 0.1665. Cross terms: 2*20*0.408163 ≈ 16.3265. So total is 400 + 16.3265 + 0.1665 ≈ 416.493. So (20.408163)^2 ≈ 416.493.

Now, 4.9 times that is 4.9 * 416.493. Let me compute that. 4 * 416.493 = 1665.972. 0.9 * 416.493 = 374.8437. Adding them together: 1665.972 + 374.8437 = 2040.8157 meters.

So y(t) is 4081.6326 - 2040.8157 = 2040.8169 meters. That's approximately 2041 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 2041. So the maximum height is 2041 meters.

Wait, but that seems extremely high for a model rocket. Typically, model rockets don't go that high. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me double-check the equation.

The trajectory is c(t) = (80t, 200t -4.9t²). So the y-component is 200t -4.9t². That would be the height as a function of time. The maximum occurs at t=200/(2*4.9) = 200/9.8 ≈20.408 seconds, which gives y ≈2041 meters. Hmm, but maybe the units are in feet? Wait, no, the problem states distance in meters. So perhaps it is correct.

Wait, but 2041 meters is about 6700 feet, which is very high for a model rocket. Maybe the problem has a typo, but I should proceed with the given numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate y(t) at t=20.408163.

Compute 200t: 200 * 20.408163 ≈ 200 * 20.408163 = 4081.6326.

Then, 4.9t²: 4.9 * (20.408163)^2.

Calculating (20.408163)^2:

20.408163 * 20.408163.

Let me compute it step by step.

20 * 20 = 400.

20 * 0.408163 = 8.16326.

0.408163 * 20 = 8.16326.

0.408163 * 0.408163 ≈ 0.16656.

So adding up:

400 + (8.16326 + 8.16326) + 0.16656.

Which is 400 + 16.32652 + 0.16656 ≈ 416.49308.

So 4.9 * 416.49308 ≈ 4.9 * 416.49308.

Compute 4 * 416.49308 = 1665.97232.

0.9 * 416.49308 ≈ 374.843772.

So total is 1665.97232 + 374.843772 ≈ 2040.816092.

So y(t) = 4081.6326 - 2040.816092 ≈ 2040.8165 meters, which is approximately 2041 meters. So option C is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider another approach. Maybe the maximum height can be found using the formula for projectile motion. The maximum height formula is (v₀² sin²θ)/(2g). But in this case, the equation is given as y(t) = 200t -4.9t². So the initial vertical velocity is 200 m/s, and the acceleration due to gravity is 4.9 m/s² (half of 9.8, which is standard). So the maximum height would be (v₀²)/(2g), where v₀ is 200 m/s. So (200)^2 / (2*4.9) = 40000 / 9.8 ≈4081.63265 meters. Wait, that's the same as the first term in y(t). But wait, that's not correct because when I calculated the y(t) at t=20.408, I got 2041 meters, which is exactly half of 4081.63. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait a second, I think I'm confusing something. Let me clarify. The maximum height in projectile motion is (v₀² sin²θ)/(2g), but in this case, the equation is y(t) = v₀ t - (1/2) g t², which would be the case for straight up motion (θ=90 degrees), so sinθ =1. So the maximum height would be (v₀)^2/(2g). So plugging in v₀=200 m/s, (200)^2/(2*9.8) = 40000/(19.6) ≈2040.816 meters, which matches the earlier calculation. So that's correct.

So I think my initial calculation was correct, and the maximum height is approximately 2041 meters, which is option C.

To find the maximum height of the rocket, we analyze the vertical component of the trajectory, \( y(t) = 200t - 4.9t^2 \). The maximum height occurs at the vertex of this quadratic function, which is given by \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -4.9 \) and \( b = 200 \), so:

\[
t = \frac{-200}{2 \times -4.9} = \frac{200}{9.8} \approx 20.408 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Substituting \( t \approx 20.408 \) back into \( y(t) \):

\[
y(20.408) = 200 \times 20.408 - 4.9 \times (20.408)^2.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
200 \times 20.408 \approx 4081.6 \, \text{meters},
\]
\[
(20.408)^2 \approx 416.493, \quad 4.9 \times 416.493 \approx 2040.816 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Thus:

\[
y(20.408) = 4081.6 - 2040.816 \approx 2040.8 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the maximum height is approximately \( 2041 \) meters, which corresponds to option C.
