Okay, so I've got this question here about measuring the length of a block of wood. The true length is given as 1.010 cm. Three measurements were taken: 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. The question is about whether these measurements are precise, accurate, both, neither, or some combination. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to remember what accurate and precise mean in the context of measurements. Accuracy refers to how close a measured value is to the true or accepted value. So, if the true length is 1.010 cm, a measurement of 1.0 cm would be very accurate. Precision, on the other hand, refers to how close multiple measurements are to each other. So, if all three measurements are very close, like 1.0, 1.0, 1.1, they would be precise, even if they're not accurate.

Looking at the measurements given: 1.4, 1.2, and 0.9 cm. Let's compare each to the true value of 1.010 cm. 

1.4 cm is 0.39 cm away from the true value. That's a big difference. 1.2 cm is 0.19 cm away, which is better, but still not great. 0.9 cm is 0.11 cm less than the true value. So all three are off by varying amounts. 

Now, looking at the measurements relative to each other: 1.4, 1.2, and 0.9. The differences between them are 0.2 cm between 1.4 and 1.2, 0.3 cm between 1.2 and 0.9, and 0.5 cm between 1.4 and 0.9. These are significant differences. So, the measurements aren't close to each other, meaning they're not very precise.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. I might be getting this mixed up. Precision is about how close the measurements are to each other, regardless of whether they're close to the true value. So even if all measurements are way off but close to each other, they'd be precise. But in this case, the measurements are spread out, so they're not precise. 

So, the measurements aren't accurate because they're all quite far from the true value, and they're not precise because they're spread out. That would mean they're neither accurate nor precise. 

Looking at the options, option F says they're neither precise nor accurate. That seems to fit. But let me check other options to make sure I'm not missing something. 

Option A says they're somewhat precise and somewhat accurate. But the measurements are not close to each other or the true value, so that's not right. Option B says exceptionally accurate but not precise. But since they're not close to the true value, they can't be accurate. Option C says precise but not accurate, but they're not precise either. Option D says accurate and slightly precise. Again, the measurements aren't accurate. Option E says both, which isn't the case. Option G says slightly precise but very accurate. Not matching. Option H says very precise but slightly accurate. No, they're not precise. Option I says accurate but not precise. No, they're not accurate. Option J says exceptionally precise but not accurate. Also no, they're not precise.

So yeah, option F must be the correct answer. The measurements are neither precise nor accurate.

The measurements of 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm are neither precise nor accurate compared to the true length of 1.010 cm. They are spread out and not close to each other, indicating a lack of precision, and they deviate significantly from the true value, indicating a lack of accuracy.

Answer: F
