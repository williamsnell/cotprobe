Question:

Briefly describe motor development in the adolescent.

Options:

A: Adolescent's motor development is marked by a decrease in the length of limbs and slower motor performance.
B: Adolescent's motor development sees a reduction in rapid growth, a decrease in physical strength, and an increase in reaction time.
C: Adolescent's motor development includes a plateau in physical strength, no significant growth, and unchanging reaction times.
D: Adolescent's motor development leads to a decline in coordination and motor skills due to rapid limb growth.
E: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by a rapid increase in physical activity but no significant changes in strength or motor performance.
F: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by decreased physical strength and slower reaction time.
G: Adolescent's motor development involves a decrease in physical activity and longer reaction time.
H: Adolescent's motor development is defined by minimal changes in physical strength and limb length, with no improvement in motor performance.
I: Adolescent's motor development is marked by a steady decline in both growth and physical activity levels.
J: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by increased physical strength, rapid growth, increased length of limbs, accelerated speed of motor performance, and shorter reaction time.

Alright, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about motor development in adolescents. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall what motor development entails. Motor development refers to the growth and changes in an individual's ability to move and control their body. In adolescence, which is typically between 10-19 years old, there are significant physical changes happening.

I remember that during puberty, there's a growth spurt. Boys and girls experience increases in height and weight, so their limbs get longer. This growth spurt usually means that their bodies are developing larger muscles and bones. So, motor performance, like speed and coordination, should improve because their bodies are getting more developed.

Looking at the options:

Option A says a decrease in limb length and slower motor performance. That doesn't sound right because adolescents grow taller. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B mentions a reduction in rapid growth, decrease in physical strength, and longer reaction times. Wait, reduction in rapid growth? Adolescence is when growth is rapid, so this seems opposite. Maybe B is incorrect.

Option C talks about plateau in strength and no significant growth. No, because strength increases during puberty, especially in males. So C is likely wrong.

Option D says decline in coordination due to rapid limb growth. But I think coordination improves, not declines, because motor skills develop as the body grows. So D might not be correct.

Option E says increased physical activity but no changes in strength. That seems unlikely because activity might influence strength, but the main point is that strength does increase during adolescence. So E might not be the best choice.

Option F claims decreased strength and slower reaction times. I don't think strength decreases; it should increase. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says decreased physical activity and longer reaction time. Adolescents are usually more active, so G doesn't fit.

Option H says minimal changes in strength and no improvement in motor performance. No, because strength and motor skills do improve.

Option I talks about a steady decline in growth and activity. That's not right since both growth and activity can vary but generally don't decline steadily.

Option J states increased physical strength, rapid growth, longer limbs, faster motor performance, and shorter reaction times. This sounds accurate. Adolescents do grow rapidly, their strength increases, their motor skills improve, and reaction times get quicker because their nervous system is maturing.

Wait, let me double-check. Reaction time decreases because the brain's processing speed improves. Yes, so J seems to cover all the correct aspects: increased strength, growth, longer limbs, faster motor performance, and quicker reactions.

So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J because it accurately describes the adolescent's motor development, which includes increased physical strength, rapid growth, longer limbs, faster motor performance, and quicker reaction times.
