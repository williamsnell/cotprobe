Okay, so I've got this question about the worldwide prevalence of obesity. I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that obesity is a significant global health issue. The prevalence varies by region, but I think the question is asking for a general worldwide figure. I recall hearing that a large percentage of the global population is overweight or obese, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number.

I remember that in some reports, around 30% of the world's population is considered overweight or obese. But wait, sometimes these statistics can be a bit confusing because they might include both categories. Obesity is a subset of being overweight, so maybe the question is specifically about obesity, not just being overweight.

Wait, no, the question says "prevalence of obesity," so it's specifically about obesity, not just being overweight. That's an important distinction. So I need to focus on the percentage of the population that is obese, not just those who are overweight.

I think the World Health Organization (WHO) has some data on this. From what I remember, WHO reports that globally, about 13% of adults are considered obese. That's a figure I've heard before in health classes or news articles. So 13% is the prevalence of obesity worldwide among adults.

Looking at the options, option C is 13%, so that must be the correct answer. Let me quickly review the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A is 30%, which is probably the percentage of people who are overweight, including obesity. Options like E (40%) and F (35%) seem too high. Option I is 25%, which I don't think is correct. So yeah, 13% sounds right for obesity specifically.

The worldwide prevalence of obesity is approximately 13%, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
