Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here asking which country is actively trying to preserve the purity of their native language from contamination by English or other languages. The options are A through F: Brazil, Australia, Japan, United States, India, and South Africa.

Hmm, let's break this down. I need to think about each country and their stance on language preservation. I remember that some countries have official policies or movements to protect their native languages from being overwhelmed by more dominant languages like English.

Starting with Brazil (A). I know that Brazil's official language is Portuguese, and I think there's a strong emphasis on maintaining it. There might be policies or institutions promoting the use of Portuguese to keep it pure. For example, I recall that the Academia Brasileira de Letras exists to regulate the Portuguese language in Brazil, so that's a point in favor of Brazil.

Next, Australia (B). Australia has several indigenous languages, but English is the main language. I don't think Australia is trying to preserve the purity of English from other languages; instead, there are efforts to revitalize indigenous languages. But the question is about the purity of the native language, which in Australia's case, English is the primary one. I'm not sure if Australia is actively trying to keep English pure or is more focused on supporting other languages.

Japan (C). Japanese is the main language there. I know that Japan has a strong cultural identity, and they might be protective of their language. But I'm not certain about specific policies aimed at preventing English from contaminating Japanese. They do use a lot of loanwords, especially from English, which are adapted into Japanese (like "sakura" for English words). So maybe Japan isn't as proactive in preserving the purity as others.

United States (D). The US has English as its primary language, but it's a country with many languages spoken. The US doesn't have an official language at the federal level, so I don't think there's a concerted effort to preserve English's purity. Instead, there's more focus on accommodating various languages and cultures.

India (E). India has a rich linguistic diversity with 22 officially recognized languages. Hindi and English are widely used. India promotes its regional languages, but I'm not sure if they're trying to keep them pure from English influence. English is widely used there, especially in business and education, so maybe there's more focus on coexistence rather than purity.

South Africa (F). South Africa has 11 official languages, including English. They promote multilingualism, so I don't think they're trying to keep English pure. Instead, they might be more focused on supporting their native languages and using English as a common language alongside others.

So, putting it together, Brazil seems to have the most active efforts to preserve the purity of their native language. The presence of the Academia Brasileira de Letras and policies promoting Portuguese suggest that they're actively working to maintain the language's purity. Other countries like Japan or India might use English more without necessarily trying to keep their languages pure from it.

The correct answer is A: Brazil. Brazil actively preserves the purity of its native language, Portuguese, through institutions like the Academia Brasileira de Letras, which regulates and promotes the language. Other countries listed either focus on multilingualism or do not have similar preservation efforts. 

Answer: A
