Okay, so I need to figure out what Hume says about reason. I remember that Hume was a Scottish philosopher, and he had some pretty strong views on the relationship between reason and passion. Let me think.

From what I recall, Hume believed that reason is not the driving force behind our actions. Instead, he thought that our passions and emotions are what really motivate us. So, reason must play a different role here.

I think he said that reason is like a slave to the passions. That means reason doesn't lead us; instead, it serves our passions. So, when we make decisions, it's not that we use reason to direct our passions, but rather that reason helps us figure out the best way to satisfy our passions.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says reason should direct our passions. That sounds like reason is in charge, which might not be what Hume said. He probably thought the opposite.

Option B suggests reason operates independently of passions. If reason were independent, that would mean it's separate from emotions, but Hume might see them as intertwined, with reason serving passion.

Option C says reason should be suppressed by passions. That could be close, but I think Hume didn't say reason is suppressed but rather that it serves passion.

Option G says reason should serve our passions. That matches what I was thinking earlier. Reason is there to help our passions, not lead them.

Other options don't seem right. For example, E says validate passions, which is a bit different. F is contradict, which would be the opposite of serving. H says intensify, which isn't quite it. I is rationalize, which might be a bit off. J is extinguish, which is the opposite of what Hume would say.

So, the correct answer should be G: should serve our passions.

The correct answer is G: should serve our passions.
