Okay, so I've got this AdaBoost question here, and I need to figure out whether the two statements are true, partially true, or false. I'm a bit rusty on AdaBoost, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's recall what AdaBoost does. AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers into a strong one. It does this by iteratively adjusting the weights of the training examples based on the performance of the current weak classifier.

Statement 1: In AdaBoost, the weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor.

Hmm, from what I remember, AdaBoost adjusts the weights in a specific way. After each iteration, the weights of the examples that were misclassified are increased so that the next classifier pays more attention to them. The formula I think is something like D_t+1(i) = D_t(i) * (1/(1 - e_t)) for misclassified examples, where e_t is the error rate of the current classifier. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. I think the exact formula is D_t+1(i) = D_t(i) * alpha_t if the example was misclassified, and D_t(i) / alpha_t otherwise. Here, alpha_t is usually set to something like (1 - e_t)/(e_t) or similar. So the multiplicative factor isn't the same for all misclassified examples; rather, it's a factor that depends on the error rate of the current classifier. Wait, no, actually, all misclassified examples get multiplied by the same factor. So Statement 1 says they "go up by the same multiplicative factor." That would be correct because each misclassified example's weight is multiplied by a factor that's the same for all of them. So Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but let me double-check. AdaBoost's update rule for the weights is: for each example, if it's misclassified by the current weak classifier, its weight is multiplied by a factor greater than 1. This factor is the same for all misclassified examples, right? Because alpha_t is the same for all. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: In AdaBoost, the weighted training error e_t of the tth weak classifier on training data with weights D_t tends to increase as a function of t.

Wait, this seems a bit tricky. The weighted training error e_t is the error calculated using the current weights D_t. So e_t is the probability of misclassifying a randomly selected example according to the current weights.

In AdaBoost, each subsequent weak classifier is trained on the updated weights, which give more weight to the examples that were misclassified by the previous classifier. So as t increases, the error e_t... Hmm. Let's think. The first classifier will have some error e_1. Then, the weights are adjusted so that the next classifier sees more emphasis on the misclassified examples. Intuitively, the error e_t should decrease because each step focuses on the harder examples. But wait, the question says e_t tends to increase as t increases. That would mean each new weak classifier has a higher error than the previous one on the weighted data.

Wait, that doesn't sound right because AdaBoost's process is designed to reduce the overall error. The weighted error e_t is the error rate for the current step. Each time, the algorithm selects a classifier with a lower error. Wait, no, e_t is the error on the weighted data for the t-th classifier. So after each step, the weighted error e_t should be lower. Or does it sometimes increase? Let me think again.

The AdaBoost algorithm selects the weak classifier with the minimal weighted error. So each e_t is the minimal possible for that step. So e_t shouldn't increase. For example, the first classifier might have a high e_1, but then subsequent e_t would be lower because the algorithm focuses on the harder examples. Wait, no, that's not right either. Because the initial weights are uniform, e_1 is the error rate on the uniform weights. Then, D_2 increases the weights of misclassified examples, so the next classifier is trained on a distribution that's harder, so e_2 could be higher than e_1? Or not necessarily?

Wait, no, because the algorithm selects the weak classifier with the minimal possible e_t for each step. So e_t is the minimum possible given the current weights. So, in that case, e_t would be non-increasing. Because each subsequent classifier is better on the current weighted data. So the weighted error e_t should decrease or stay the same, not increase. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So looking at the options, the correct pair would be True for Statement 1 and False for Statement 2. Now, looking at the options:

Options:

H: True, True

I: True, False

J: False, True

So the correct answer is I: True, False.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me think again about Statement 2. The question says e_t tends to increase as t increases. If e_t is the weighted error for the t-th classifier, does it increase with t?

Let me think about the first few steps. Suppose in the first step, the error is e_1. Then, the weights are adjusted. The next classifier is trained on these weights, so it's harder to get a lower error. But the algorithm selects the classifier with the minimal possible error for the current weights. So e_2 is the minimal possible, which could be lower than e_1. So e_t should not necessarily increase. So Statement 2 is incorrect. So the answer is I: True, False.

The first statement is true because AdaBoost uniformly increases the weights of misclassified examples by the same multiplicative factor. The second statement is false because the weighted training error tends to decrease, not increase, as t increases.
