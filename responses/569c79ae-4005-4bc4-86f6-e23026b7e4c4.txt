Okay, so I've got this problem about fluid flow, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says that water flows through a 1-inch diameter pipe. The kinematic viscosity of water is given as 0.1 × 10^-4 ft²/s. We need to calculate the largest flow rate for which the flow will definitely be laminar. The critical Reynolds number (Re)_c is approximately 2100.

Hmm, I remember that laminar flow is when the flow is smooth and the Reynolds number is below a certain critical value. Once the Reynolds number exceeds this, the flow becomes turbulent. So the largest flow rate for laminar flow would be just below the critical Reynolds number, right? So we need to calculate the flow rate when Re equals 2100.

The formula for Reynolds number is Re = (v * D) / ν, where v is the velocity, D is the diameter, and ν is the kinematic viscosity. Rearranging this to solve for velocity, v = (Re * ν) / D.

Wait, but we need the flow rate, which is Q = A * v, where A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The area of a pipe is π*(D/2)^2, right? So putting it all together, Q = A * v = π*(D/2)^2 * (Re * ν) / D. Simplifying that, the D in the numerator and denominator might cancel out some terms.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Convert the diameter from inches to feet because the viscosity is in ft²/s. Oh wait, 1 inch is 1/12 feet. So D = 1/12 ft.

2. Calculate the Reynolds number Re = 2100.

3. Solve for velocity v using Re = (v * D) / ν. So v = (Re * ν) / D.

4. Compute the area A = π*(D/2)^2.

5. Finally, Q = A * v.

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, D = 1 inch = 1/12 ft ≈ 0.0833 ft.

ν = 0.1 × 10^-4 ft²/s = 1 × 10^-5 ft²/s.

Calculating v:

v = (2100 * 1e-5) / (1/12) = (2100 * 1e-5) * 12 = (2100 * 12) * 1e-5.

2100 * 12 is 25,200. So 25,200 * 1e-5 = 0.252 ft/s.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 2100 multiplied by 1e-5 is 0.021. Then divided by (1/12) is the same as multiplying by 12. So 0.021 * 12 = 0.252 ft/s. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, calculate the area A. D is 1/12 ft, so radius r is D/2 = 1/24 ft.

A = π * (1/24)^2 = π * (1/576) ≈ 3.1416 / 576 ≈ 0.005454 ft².

Then Q = A * v = 0.005454 * 0.252 ≈ 0.001373 ft³/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them is exactly this. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let's redo it carefully.

Compute v:

v = (Re * ν) / D = (2100 * 1e-5) / (1/12).

Compute numerator: 2100 * 1e-5 = 0.021.

Divided by (1/12) is 0.021 * 12 = 0.252 ft/s. Correct.

Area A: π*(D/2)^2 = π*(0.0833/2)^2 = π*(0.04165)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.001736 ≈ 0.005454 ft².

Then Q = 0.005454 * 0.252 = let's compute that.

0.005454 * 0.252:

0.005454 * 0.2 = 0.0010908

0.005454 * 0.05 = 0.0002727

0.005454 * 0.002 = 0.0000109

Adding them up: 0.0010908 + 0.0002727 = 0.0013635; plus 0.0000109 is 0.0013744 ft³/s.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are:

A: 1.08e-3

B: 1.18e-3

C: 1.05e-3

D: 1.38e-3

E: 1.28e-3

F: 1.22e-3

G: 1.68e-3

H: 1.58e-3

I: 1.48e-3

J: 1.98e-3

Wait, my calculation gives approximately 0.0013744, which is 1.3744e-3. Looking at the options, D is 1.38e-3, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Another approach: Let's compute everything in inches to see if that changes anything, but probably not since units are consistent in the formula.

Wait, no, because the units for viscosity are in ft²/s, so we need to keep everything in ft.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let's compute it again.

D = 1 inch = 1/12 ft ≈ 0.08333 ft.

Radius r = 0.08333 / 2 = 0.041665 ft.

Area A = π * r² = π * (0.041665)^2.

Calculating 0.041665 squared: 0.041665 * 0.041665 ≈ 0.001736 ft².

Then A = π * 0.001736 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.001736 ≈ 0.005454 ft². Correct.

Velocity v = 0.252 ft/s.

So Q = 0.005454 * 0.252 = let me compute this more accurately.

0.005454 * 0.252:

First, 0.005 * 0.252 = 0.00126.

Then, 0.000454 * 0.252 = 0.000114528.

Adding them together: 0.00126 + 0.000114528 ≈ 0.001374528 ft³/s.

That's 1.3745e-3, which rounds to approximately 1.375e-3. The closest option is D: 1.38e-3.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1.28e-3, which is a bit lower. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me check the Reynolds number formula again. The correct formula is Re = (v * D) / ν, correct. So yes, v = Re * ν / D.

Another possible mistake: Did I use the correct diameter? Yes, 1 inch is 1/12 ft.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the radius instead of diameter somewhere, but no, the formula uses diameter.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the volume flow rate formula correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the flow rate directly without calculating velocity. Let's try another approach.

Flow rate Q = (Re * ν * π * (D/2)^2) / D.

Wait, that's because Q = A * v = π*(D/2)^2 * (Re * ν / D).

Simplify:

Q = π*(D²/4) * (Re * ν) / D = π*(D * Re * ν) / 4.

So Q = (π * D * Re * ν) / 4.

Plugging in the numbers:

D = 1/12 ft, Re = 2100, ν = 1e-5 ft²/s.

So Q = (π * (1/12) * 2100 * 1e-5) / 4.

Compute numerator: π * (1/12) * 2100 * 1e-5.

Calculate step by step:

1. (1/12) * 2100 = 2100 / 12 ≈ 175.

2. 175 * 1e-5 = 0.00175.

3. Multiply by π: 0.00175 * π ≈ 0.005497787.

4. Divide by 4: 0.005497787 / 4 ≈ 0.001374447 ft³/s.

Which is again approximately 1.3744e-3, so 1.374e-3, which aligns with option D: 1.38e-3.

So I think the correct answer is D.

To determine the largest flow rate for which the flow remains laminar, we use the critical Reynolds number, \( R_e_c \approx 2100 \). The formula for Reynolds number is:

\[
R_e = \frac{v \cdot D}{\nu}
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity, \( D \) is the diameter, and \( \nu \) is the kinematic viscosity. Rearranging for velocity:

\[
v = \frac{R_e \cdot \nu}{D}
\]

The flow rate \( Q \) is given by:

\[
Q = A \cdot v
\]

where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. For a pipe, \( A = \pi \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 \).

### Step 1: Convert diameter to feet
The diameter \( D \) is 1 inch, which is \( \frac{1}{12} \, \text{ft} \approx 0.0833 \, \text{ft} \).

### Step 2: Calculate velocity
Given \( R_e = 2100 \) and \( \nu = 0.1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \):

\[
v = \frac{2100 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-5}}{0.0833} = \frac{0.021}{0.0833} \approx 0.252 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate cross-sectional area
\[
A = \pi \left( \frac{0.0833}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \cdot (0.04165)^2 \approx 3.1416 \cdot 0.001736 \approx 0.005454 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate flow rate
\[
Q = A \cdot v = 0.005454 \cdot 0.252 \approx 0.001374 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \approx 1.374 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The closest option to \( 1.374 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \) is **D: \( 1.38 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \)**.

**Answer:** D
