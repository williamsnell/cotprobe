Question:

Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
~K ≡ L / (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and L is false
B: Valid. Counterexample when K is true and L is false
C: Valid. No counterexamples exist
D: Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false
E: Invalid. Counterexample when K and L are true
F: Invalid. Multiple counterexamples exist
G: Valid
H: Invalid. Counterexample when L is false and K is true
I: Invalid. Counterexample when both K and L are false

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given logical argument is valid or invalid. The argument is: ~K ≡ L / (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L). Hmm, I think I should start by understanding what each part of this means.

First, the premise is ~K ≡ L. The conclusion is (K ∧ L) ∨ (K ∧ ~L). Wait, let me make sure I'm parsing this correctly. The premise is a biconditional statement, which means that ~K is equivalent to L. So whenever ~K is true, L is true, and whenever ~K is false, L is false. Alternatively, since ~K ≡ L is the same as (L ↔ ~K), which can also be written as (K ↔ ~L) because of contraposition. Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again: the biconditional ~K ≡ L is equivalent to L ≡ ~K, which means whenever K is false, L is true, and when K is true, L is false.

Now, the conclusion is (K ∧ L) ∨ (K ∧ ~L). Let me simplify that. Since both terms have K in them, I can factor that out: K ∧ (L ∨ ~L). But L ∨ ~L is always true, so the conclusion simplifies to K ∧ True, which is just K. So the conclusion is K.

Wait, so the argument becomes: If ~K is equivalent to L, then K. So the argument is: ~K ≡ L → K.

Now, to check if this is a valid argument, I need to see if whenever the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Alternatively, I can construct a truth table for the premise and the conclusion and check if there's any row where the premise is true but the conclusion is false. If such a row exists, the argument is invalid; otherwise, it's valid.

Let me construct the truth table step by step. There are two variables: K and L, each can be true or false, so four rows total.

1. K = True, L = True
2. K = True, L = False
3. K = False, L = True
4. K = False, L = False

Now, let's compute each part for each row.

First, compute the premise: ~K ≡ L. Let's compute ~K first.

Row 1: K=T → ~K=F; L=T → F ≡ T? F ≡ T is F because F and T are not the same. So premise is F.

Row 2: K=T → ~K=F; L=F → F ≡ F is T. So premise is T.

Row 3: K=F → ~K=T; L=T → T ≡ T is T. So premise is T.

Row 4: K=F → ~K=T; L=F → T ≡ F is F. So premise is F.

Now, the conclusion is K, as we simplified earlier.

Let's see each row:

Row 1: Premise F, Conclusion T → doesn't affect validity because the premise must be T for the argument to be considered.

Row 2: Premise T, Conclusion T → OK, no problem.

Row 3: Premise T, Conclusion F → Oh, wait, K is F in this row, so conclusion is F. But the premise is T here. That means when the premise is true, the conclusion is false. So this is a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

Wait, let me double-check Row 3. K=F, L=T.

Premise: ~K ≡ L → ~F is T, so T ≡ T is T.

Conclusion: K is F. So in this case, when the premise is true, the conclusion is F. So this is a situation where the argument doesn't hold, making it invalid.

So the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when K is F and L is T. Let me check the options to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false. That matches our Row 3 scenario.

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when L is false and K is true. That's Row 2, but in Row 2, the conclusion is T, so that's not a counterexample.

Option E: Counterexample when both K and L are true. That's Row 1, but in that case, the premise is F, so it's not a counterexample.

Option A: Counterexample when K=T and L=F. That's Row 2 where premise is T and conclusion is T, so not a counterexample.

Option I: Both K and L are false. That's Row 4, where premise is F, so no.

Option D is the correct counterexample because in that case, the premise is T, but the conclusion is F.

The argument is invalid, and the counterexample occurs when K is false and L is true.
