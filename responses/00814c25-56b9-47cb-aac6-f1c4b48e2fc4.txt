Question:

A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. " The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?

Options:

A: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.
B: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.
C: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
D: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best defense the farmer has against the tenant's lawsuit for specific performance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the facts: The farmer leased a 40-acre tract to the tenant for seven years, starting in 2000. The lease has a provision where the tenant can buy 10 acres at the end for $150k. Before the lease was signed, the farmer orally promised to survey the 10 acres. But during the lease, the tenant started building an irrigation ditch without the farmer's knowledge. Then, when the tenant told the farmer he wanted to exercise the option, the farmer refused because he never surveyed the land.

The tenant sued for specific performance, which usually means the tenant wants the farmer to honor the option agreement. The question is, what's the farmer's best defense?

Looking at the options:

A: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.
B: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.
C: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
D: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule prevents introducing prior or contemporaneous agreements that contradict a written contract. Here, the oral promise to survey was made before the lease, which is a written contract. But the lease already includes the option to purchase. So the parol evidence rule might prevent the tenant from introducing the oral promise to survey as a term of the lease. But does that affect the enforceability of the option itself? The option is in the lease, so the parol evidence rule wouldn't make the option unenforceable. So maybe A is not the best defense.

Option B: Failure to survey as excusal. The lease didn't require the farmer to survey; the oral promise was separate. So the farmer didn't breach any term of the lease by not surveying. The option to purchase is a separate part of the lease, so failure to survey wouldn't excuse the farmer from fulfilling the option. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Indefinite description. The description is 10 acres, which is specific. Indefiniteness would be a problem if, say, the description wasn't clear enough to identify the land. But 10 acres is definite. So C might not be the issue here.

Option D: Separate consideration. For an option to be enforceable, it usually requires consideration. The lease itself is consideration for the option because the tenant is leasing the property, and in exchange, has the option to buy. But if the option was a promise without any consideration, it might not be enforceable. However, in this case, the option was part of the lease agreement, so the lease itself serves as consideration. So D might not apply because the option likely had consideration.

Wait, but the oral promise to survey—was that a separate consideration issue? The lease included the option, so the consideration is there. The oral promise was a separate promise, but it wasn't part of the option agreement. So the option itself had consideration (the lease). Therefore, D isn't the best defense.

Going back to Option A: The parol evidence rule. The oral promise to survey could be excluded under the parol evidence rule because the lease is a written contract that doesn't mention the survey. So the tenant can't use the oral promise to add that as a term. But the option is in the lease, so the parol evidence rule doesn't affect the option's enforceability. So A might not be the right defense.

Wait, another angle: If the option was part of the lease, then the parol evidence rule doesn't apply because it's not contradicting the written lease. The oral promise was about something else, the survey, which isn't part of the lease terms. So A isn't the right defense because the option is enforceable.

Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider. The question is about the farmer's defense against specific performance. Specific performance is an equitable remedy, so the court looks at factors like whether the remedy is appropriate.

But the main issue here is whether the option is enforceable. Let's think about consideration. The lease provided consideration for the option because the tenant is leasing the land, and in exchange, gets the option to buy. So D is wrong because there was consideration.

So the farmer's best defense would be that the option lacks consideration, but that's not correct because the lease provided it. So maybe the correct defense is that the farmer didn't breach any duty because the lease didn't require him to survey.

Wait, but the tenant is suing for specific performance of the option. The farmer's defense would be that the option isn't enforceable. If the option is part of the lease, it's enforceable because there was consideration (the lease). So what other defenses are there?

Looking again, perhaps the issue is the survey. The farmer didn't survey, but the lease didn't require him to. The tenant built an irrigation ditch without the farmer's knowledge. But that's a separate issue—does that affect the option? Maybe the tenant's actions could be a breach, but that's not the farmer's defense here.

Wait, the question is about the farmer's defense. He's refusing to perform because he didn't survey. But the lease didn't require him to survey. The oral promise was separate. So the failure to survey doesn't excuse the farmer from the option because the lease didn't include that as a condition.

Alternatively, maybe the option is unenforceable because it lacks consideration. But no, the lease provided consideration.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the option is a unilateral contract. For an option, the consideration is the payment or some act by the option holder. Here, the tenant's consideration would be the $150k at the end. But in the lease, the consideration is the rent and use of the land, and the option is a promise in exchange for that. So D isn't correct.

So going back, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the parol evidence rule makes the oral promise irrelevant, so the option stands as written.

Wait, perhaps the option is enforceable because it's in writing (the lease), and the oral promise about the survey is separate. So the farmer can't use the survey as a defense because the lease doesn't require it. So the tenant can get specific performance because the option is valid.

Wait, but the question is what's the farmer's best defense. So if the option is unenforceable because there's no consideration, that would be a good defense. But in this case, the lease provided consideration. So D is incorrect.

Alternatively, if the lease didn't require the survey, then the farmer's failure to survey doesn't affect the option. So the farmer can't use that as a defense.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the option was an oral promise, but in real estate, contracts must be in writing under the statute of frauds. But the lease itself includes the option, so it's written. So that's not an issue.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: Parol evidence rule. The lease was written. The oral promise was about the survey, which isn't part of the lease. So the parol evidence rule would prevent the tenant from introducing that oral promise as a term of the lease. But the option is part of the lease, so the parol evidence rule doesn't affect it. So A isn't the correct defense because the option is enforceable.

Option B: Failure to survey excused. The lease didn't require the farmer to survey, so this doesn't apply. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Indefinite description. The 10 acres is specific enough. So C is incorrect.

Option D: No separate consideration. The lease provided consideration for the option, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the option wasn't supported by separate consideration beyond the lease. But in option contracts, the consideration is usually the payment of the option fee or something. Here, the option is part of the lease, so the consideration is the lease itself. So D is wrong.

So, if all options A-D are incorrect, but I must choose the best one. Wait, perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the best defense is that the description is too indefinite, but I don't think so.

Wait, the lease says "10 acres of the tract." The tract is 40 acres, so the 10 acres might be too vague. But the tenant can identify 10 acres, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the description is sufficient because it's 10 acres of the 40-acre tract. So C isn't correct.

I'm getting more confused. Let me think differently. The tenant is suing for specific performance of the option. The option is part of the lease. The lease is enforceable. The farmer's best defense would be that the option is unenforceable. Why? Maybe because there's no consideration. But in the lease, the consideration is the rent and the lease itself. So the option is supported by consideration.

Wait, perhaps the option is a unilateral contract. For an option, the consideration is the payment of the option price. But in this case, the option is exercisable at the end, so the consideration is the lease itself. So D is incorrect.

Wait, another angle: The lease includes the option, so it's a valid contract. The farmer's failure to survey doesn't affect the option because it's a separate promise. So the farmer can't use that as a defense. Therefore, the best defense would be that the option was unenforceable due to lack of consideration, but that's not correct because the lease provided consideration.

I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is D. Because the option didn't have separate consideration, but the lease itself is the consideration. So D is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the parol evidence rule applies because the oral promise about the survey was made before the lease, and the lease didn't mention it. So the tenant can't introduce that oral promise, making the option enforceable as written. So A is incorrect because the option is enforceable.

Wait, but the farmer's defense isn't about the option being unenforceable, but about why he can refuse. Maybe the tenant didn't fulfill some condition, but the lease didn't require the survey.

Alternatively, perhaps the description is too indefinite. But 10 acres is specific enough.

I'm going in circles. Maybe the correct answer is A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the best defense is that the option lacks consideration, which is D. But I think the lease provided the necessary consideration.

Wait, maybe the option was an oral agreement. Under the statute of frauds, an option to buy land must be in writing. But the lease includes the option, so it's written. So that's not an issue.

I think I've exhausted all options. I'm probably overcomplicating this. The best defense is that the option was unenforceable due to lack of consideration. So D.

The question revolves around the enforceability of the option agreement within the lease and the farmer's best defense against the tenant's suit for specific performance. The key points of analysis are as follows:

1. **Option Agreement and Consideration (Option D)**: For an option to be enforceable, consideration is typically required. In this case, the lease itself serves as consideration for the option, as the tenant is leasing the property in exchange for the right to purchase. Therefore, the option is supported by consideration, making Option D incorrect.

2. **Parol Evidence Rule (Option A)**: The oral promise to survey the 10-acre tract was made before the lease was executed and is not mentioned in the written lease. Under the parol evidence rule, this oral promise cannot contradict the written lease. However, the option to purchase is explicitly stated in the lease, so the parol evidence rule does not affect its enforceability. Thus, Option A is not the best defense.

3. **Failure to Survey (Option B)**: The lease does not include a covenant requiring the farmer to survey the 10-acre tract. The oral promise to survey was a separate, unenforceable promise and does not relieve the farmer of obligations under the lease, including the option agreement. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.

4. **Indefiniteness of Description (Option C)**: The description of the property as "10 acres of the tract" is specific enough to identify the land. Indefiniteness is not an issue here, making Option C incorrect.

After analyzing all options, the best defense is that the option agreement was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration. While the lease itself provided consideration, the option's enforceability hinges on whether it was supported by adequate consideration beyond the lease terms. However, this reasoning ultimately does not hold, as the lease itself serves as sufficient consideration for the option.
