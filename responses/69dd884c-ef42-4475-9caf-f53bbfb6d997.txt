Okay, so I've got this question about convertible debentures, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is: A $500 par-value convertible debenture is selling at $520. The conversion ratio is 20. What is the conversion price?

Hmm, I need to find the conversion price. I remember that the conversion price is related to the conversion ratio and the price of the debenture. Let me think about what I know.

First, a convertible debenture is like a bond that can be converted into a certain number of shares of the company. The par value is the face value, which is $500 here. The selling price is $520, which is a bit higher than the par value, but I'm not sure if that matters directly for the conversion price.

The conversion ratio is given as 20. I think the conversion ratio tells you how many shares you get for each debenture. So, if you have one debenture, you can convert it into 20 shares of the company. That makes sense.

Wait, but I need the conversion price, not the ratio. The conversion price is the price per share that the debenture can be converted into. So if the ratio is 20, and the par value is $500, maybe I can find the price per share by dividing the par value by the ratio?

Let me calculate that. Par value is $500, and the ratio is 20. So 500 divided by 20 is... 25. So that would make the conversion price $25 per share. Because each share would be worth $25 when converted.

Wait, but does the selling price of $520 affect this? Because the market price is higher than the par value. I'm not sure. Conversion price is usually based on the par value, not the current market price. Because the conversion price is fixed when the debenture is issued, right? So even if the market price is higher, the conversion price stays the same unless there's some adjustment feature, which the question doesn't mention.

So, using the par value of $500 and a ratio of 20, the conversion price is $500 / 20 = $25. Looking at the options, E is $25.00. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but just to double-check: conversion ratio is the number of shares per debenture, and conversion price is the price per share. So yes, if you divide the par value by the ratio, you get the price per share. So 500 / 20 = 25. So E is correct.

The conversion price is calculated by dividing the par value of the debenture by the conversion ratio. Here, $500 divided by 20 equals $25.00.

Answer: E
