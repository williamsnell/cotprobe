Question:

The predominant cell type infected by HIV is CD4^+ cells. The mostimportant of these are the T-helper cells. (Review the immunogeneticschapter for a description of T_H-cells.) As the diseaseprogresses through latency into AIDS-related complexand finally full-blown AIDS, the absolute number of CD4^+ cells (i.e., T_H-cells) decreases.The rate of T_H-cell deletionincreases as the patient enters ARC. As the number ofT_H-cells decreases, the ratio of CD4^+ to CD8^+ cells inverts, goingfrom about 2:1 to less than 1:2. Why is the T_H-cell sucha devastating target ?

Options:

A: T_H-cells are auxiliary cells that enhance the phagocytic function of macrophages without affecting lymphocytes.
B: T_H-cells are necessary for the proper functioning of the specific immune system, that is, for cytotoxic T-cells (T_c) and most B-cells.
C: T_H-cells are necessary for the functioning of only B-cells
D: T_H-cells are primarily involved in the production of mucus as a barrier against pathogens.
E: T_H-cells are the primary cell type that produces histamine in response to allergens.
F: T_H-cells are necessary for the maintenance of the skin's barrier function.
G: T_H-cells are only involved in the initial recognition of pathogens, without influencing the adaptive immune response.
H: T_H-cells are necessary for the functioning of non-specific immune system
I: T_H-cells are responsible for the production of antibodies against only non-pathogenic antigens.
J: T_H-cells are not necessary for the immune system

Okay, so I have this question about HIV and T-H cells, and I need to figure out why T-H cells are such a devastating target for the virus. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that HIV specifically targets CD4+ T-cells, which are also known as T-H or helper T cells. These cells are crucial for the immune system. But why exactly are they so important? The question mentions that as the disease progresses, the number of CD4+ cells decreases, leading to a reversal in the CD4 to CD8 ratio. So, their loss has a significant impact on the immune system.

Looking at the options, each one explains a different role of T-H cells. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says T-H cells are auxiliary for macrophages but don't affect lymphocytes. Wait, I think T-H cells actually play a big role in activating other immune cells, including B-cells and cytotoxic T cells. So maybe A isn't right because it downplays their role beyond just macrophages.

Option B states T-H cells are necessary for the specific immune system, specifically for cytotoxic T cells and most B-cells. That sounds familiar. I remember that T-H cells help activate these cells by providing signals and cytokines. Without T-H cells, the adaptive immune response can't function properly. This seems correct.

Option C says they're only for B-cells. No, because I know they also support cytotoxic T cells, so C is too narrow.

Option D mentions mucus production as a barrier. That doesn't sound right. Mucus is more related to mucosal immunity, which I don't think is the main role of T-H cells here.

Option E talks about histamine and allergies. No, that's more about mast cells and basophils, not T-H cells.

Option F says they maintain the skin barrier. That's more about epidermal cells or maybeæœ— phocytes, not T-H cells.

Option G suggests they're only involved in initial recognition. Wait, no, T-H cells are actually involved in the adaptive immune response, which is more specific and comes into play after the initial recognition. So G is incorrect.

Option H says they're necessary for the non-specific immune system. Hmm, non-specific is like innate immunity, which doesn't require T-H cells. So H is wrong.

Option I claims they produce antibodies against non-pathogenic antigens. No, B-cells make antibodies, not T-H cells. Plus, T-H cells help B-cells but don't produce antibodies themselves.

Option J says they're not necessary. That's obviously wrong because without T-H cells, the immune system can't function, which is why HIV leads to such severe immune deficiency.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B because T-H cells are essential for the specific immune system, particularly for activating cytotoxic T-cells and most B-cells. Without them, the body can't mount an effective defense against many pathogens, which is why their depletion is so devastating in HIV/AIDS.

The T_H-cells, or CD4^+ T-cells, play a critical role in the immune system by supporting the specific immune response. They are essential for activating cytotoxic T-cells and most B-cells, enabling the adaptive immune system to function properly. When HIV infects and destroys these cells, the body loses its ability to mount effective defenses against pathogens, leading to severe immune compromise. This explains why the depletion of T_H-cells is so devastating in HIV/AIDS progression.

Answer: B
