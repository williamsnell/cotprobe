Okay, so I have this physics problem here about springs and work. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the problem says that 2 Joules of work is needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of 30 cm to 42 cm. I need to find how far beyond its natural length a force of 30 N will keep the spring stretched.

First, I remember that when dealing with springs, Hooke's Law is usually involved. Hooke's Law states that the force needed to stretch a spring is proportional to the extension, so F = kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the natural length.

But wait, the problem also mentions work done. Work done on the spring when stretching it is related to the potential energy stored in the spring. The formula for the elastic potential energy (work done) is W = (1/2)kx². Right, because the work done is the integral of force over distance, and since F = kx, the integral from 0 to x gives (1/2)kx².

So in the first part of the problem, the spring is stretched from 30 cm to 42 cm. That means the extension x is 42 cm - 30 cm = 12 cm. Wait, but in meters, that's 0.12 m. The work done here is 2 J. So I can set up the equation: 2 J = (1/2)k*(0.12 m)². Let me solve for k.

Calculating that: 2 = 0.5 * k * (0.12)^2. Let's compute 0.12 squared: that's 0.0144. So 2 = 0.5 * k * 0.0144. Multiplying 0.5 and 0.0144 gives 0.0072. So 2 = k * 0.0072. To find k, divide both sides by 0.0072: k = 2 / 0.0072. Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 0.0072 is the same as 2 * (1000/7.2) ≈ 277.777... So k ≈ 277.78 N/m. Hmm, that seems right.

Now, the second part asks how far beyond its natural length a force of 30 N will keep the spring stretched. Using Hooke's Law again, F = kx. Here, F is 30 N, and k is 277.78 N/m. So x = F/k = 30 / 277.78. Let me compute that: 30 ÷ 277.78 ≈ 0.108 meters. Converting that to centimeters, it's 10.8 cm. Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 10.8 cm. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have mixed up units.

Wait, 0.108 meters is 10.8 cm. So the extension is 10.8 cm beyond the natural length. But let me just make sure I didn't make any math errors. Let me recalculate the spring constant.

Given W = 2 J, x = 0.12 m. So W = 0.5*k*x² → 2 = 0.5 * k * (0.12)^2 → 2 = 0.5 * k * 0.0144 → 2 = 0.0072k → k = 2 / 0.0072 = 277.777... That's correct.

Then, F = 30 N. So x = F/k = 30 / 277.777 ≈ 0.108 m, which is 10.8 cm. So that's option F. But wait, looking back at the options, option F is 10.8 cm. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because in the options, option J is 16.2 cm, which is 1.62 times 10.8. Did I miss a step?

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate x. Let me compute 30 divided by 277.777 more carefully. 277.777 is approximately 277.7778. So 30 ÷ 277.7778. Let me compute 277.7778 × 0.1 = 27.77778, which is less than 30. Then, 277.7778 × 0.108 = let's see, 277.7778 × 0.1 is 27.77778, 277.7778 × 0.008 is 2.2222224. So total is about 27.77778 + 2.222222 = 30. So 0.108 m is correct. So 10.8 cm is the correct answer. So the answer should be F. But wait, looking at the options again, the options are A:13.5, B:18.0, C:8.4, D:12.0, E:14.4, F:10.8, G:20.4, H:9.6, I:21.6, J:16.2.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Did I mix up the work formula correctly? Because sometimes I confuse the work done with the force. The work done is the integral of F dx from 0 to x, which is indeed (1/2)kx². So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the work-energy principle differently. Let me try another approach. The work done is 2 J to stretch the spring 12 cm. So 2 J = 0.5 * k * (0.12)^2. Solving for k gives me 277.78 N/m, as before.

Then, using F = kx, x = F/k. So 30 N / 277.78 N/m ≈ 0.108 m, which is 10.8 cm. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be option F: 10.8 cm.

The problem involves calculating the extension of a spring when a force of 30 N is applied, given that 2 J of work is required to stretch the spring from its natural length of 30 cm to 42 cm. Using the work-energy principle, the spring constant \( k \) is determined to be approximately 277.78 N/m. Applying Hooke's Law, the extension \( x \) when a force of 30 N is applied is calculated to be 10.8 cm.
