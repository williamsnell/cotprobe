Question:

What are some of the cues used by animal in migrating?

Options:

A: Animals use the temperature changes as cues.
B: Animals use the color of the surroundings as cues.
C: Animals use the noises from the environment as cues.
D: Animals navigate by following other migrating animal species exclusively.
E: Animals rely solely on the memory of previous migration paths.
F: Animals use the taste of the local vegetation as a primary cue.
G: Animals depend on the guidance of human-made structures for migration.
H: Animals use the phase of the moon as the sole cue for migration.
I: Animals exclusively use the position of the sun at noon for migration.
J: Animals use several cues in their migrations such as scent, celestial cues, and the earth's magnetic field.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about animal migration cues, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by understanding the question. It's asking what cues animals use during migration, and there are ten options labeled A to J.

First, I should recall what I know about animal migration. From what I remember, migration is a behavior that animals use to move from one place to another, often seasonally. The cues or signals they use can be various, and different animals might rely on different ones. Some common ones I've heard about include things like the position of the sun, the stars, Earth's magnetic fields, temperature changes, and maybe even the Earth's magnetic field for navigation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Animals use temperature changes as cues. That makes sense because temperature can indicate seasonal changes, which might trigger migration. For example, birds might start migrating when it gets colder.

Option B: Animals use the color of the surroundings as cues. I'm not so sure about this. While some animals might use visual cues, color changes might not be the primary or most reliable cue for large-scale migrations. It seems a bit less likely compared to other options.

Option C: Animals use the noises from the environment as cues. Noises could be important, like how birds might use calls, but I'm not certain if this is a primary cue for migration. It might play a role but maybe not the main one.

Option D: Animals navigate by following other migrating animal species exclusively. I don't think animals rely solely on following others. They probably use a mix of internal and external cues, so this might not be the best answer.

Option E: Animals rely solely on the memory of previous migration paths. While memory is important, relying solely on it seems unlikely because if they only used memory, they couldn't adapt to changes in their environment, like new obstacles or changes in habitat.

Option F: Animals use the taste of the local vegetation as a primary cue. Taste doesn't seem like a primary cue for migration. It's more about where to stop for food rather than the direction or timing of migration.

Option G: Animals depend on the guidance of human-made structures for migration. This seems incorrect. While some animals might use human structures like lighthouses or bridges, it's not a primary cue for most migrants.

Option H: Animals use the phase of the moon as the sole cue for migration. The moon can influence tides, which might affect some coastal migrants, but it's probably not the sole cue for most animals.

Option I: Animals exclusively use the position of the sun at noon for migration. While the sun is a key navigational tool, relying solely on its position at noon seems too narrow. They probably use other cues too, like stars at night or the Earth's magnetic field.

Option J: Animals use several cues in their migrations such as scent, celestial cues, and the earth's magnetic field. This rings a bell. I remember reading that animals use a combination of multiple cues. For example, birds might use the Earth's magnetic field for direction, celestial navigation using the sun and stars, and possibly scents or other sensory information to guide their migrations.

Putting it all together, the question is about cues used, and the best answer seems to be J because it encompasses multiple methods, which aligns with what I know about animal migration. They don't rely on just one cue but a variety, making option J the most comprehensive and correct choice.

The correct answer is J, as animals use a combination of cues like scent, celestial navigation, and the Earth's magnetic field during migration.

Answer: J
