Okay, so I have this question about the demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm's product. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that in perfect competition, there are a lot of firms and each one is selling a homogeneous product. So, each firm is just a price taker, right? They can't influence the market price because if they try to set a higher price, customers will just buy from other firms. 

Now, the question is about the demand curve. I think the demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic. Wait, no, wait. Perfectly elastic would mean that any small increase in price leads to zero quantity demanded. But in reality, for a perfectly competitive firm, the demand curve is actually horizontal at the market price. That's because the firm can sell as much as it wants at the market price, but if it tries to raise the price even a little, no one will buy from them. So, the demand is perfectly elastic, but I'm mixing up the terms here.

Wait, perfectly elastic means the curve is horizontal, right? So, for a perfectly competitive firm, their demand curve is horizontal, which is perfectly elastic. That makes sense because they can sell any quantity at the market price but can't sell anything above that.

Looking at the options, option C says perfectly elastic. Option G says perfectly elastic and equal to the market demand curve. Wait, no, in perfect competition, the firm's demand curve is just a horizontal line at the market price. The market demand curve is downward sloping because as price increases, the quantity demanded by the whole market decreases. So the firm's demand isn't equal to the market demand curve, which is different. So option C is correct because it's perfectly elastic, but option G is wrong because it's not equal.

Another way to think: the firm's demand is a horizontal line (perfectly elastic) at the market price, while the market demand is a downward-sloping curve. So the correct answer should be C: perfectly elastic.

The demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic because the firm is a price taker and can sell any quantity at the market price. 

Answer: C
