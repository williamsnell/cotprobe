Question:

Biologists around the world have increased efforts at conservation. Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?

Options:

A: The correlation coefficient is -0.57.
B: The correlation coefficient is -0.84.
C: The correlation coefficient is 0.57.
D: The correlation coefficient is 0.71.
E: The correlation coefficient is 0.84.
F: The correlation coefficient is 0.29.
G: The correlation coefficient is -1.00.
H: The correlation coefficient is 1.00.
I: The correlation coefficient is -0.29.
J: The correlation coefficient is -0.71.

Okay, so I've got this question about correlation coefficients, and I'm a bit rusty on my stats, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a study found that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests. Hmm, I remember that when a variable explains a certain percentage of variation, that's related to the square of the correlation coefficient. Oh right! The coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation (r²). So if 71% of the variation is explained, that means r² is 0.71.

Wait, so to find r, I need to take the square root of 0.71. Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.71 is approximately 0.843. So r is about 0.84. Now, is it positive or negative?

The question states that more calls happen when there are more birds. So as the number of calls increases, the number of nests also increases. That's a positive relationship. So the correlation should be positive. Looking at the options, the positive ones are C (0.57), D (0.71), E (0.84), H (1.00), and F (0.29), I (−0.29), J (−0.71) are negative. So the correct r should be around 0.84, which is option E.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option D is 0.71, which is the r squared value, not the r itself. So no, D is incorrect. Option E is 0.84, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.

Answer: E
