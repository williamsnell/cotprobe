Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the standard Gibbs energy of formation of phenol at 298 K. Hmm, I remember that Gibbs energy of formation is related to the enthalpy of formation and entropy, but wait, I need to recall the exact formula. Oh right, the equation is ΔG°f = ΔH°f - TΔS°f. But wait, do I have the right values for these?

Wait, the question gives the standard enthalpy of combustion, not the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, so I need to find the enthalpy of formation first using the combustion data. Let me think about the combustion reaction.

Phenol (C6H5OH) when it combusts, it reacts with oxygen to produce CO2 and H2O. The balanced equation should be something like C6H5OH(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l). Let me balance that.

Carbon: 6 on the phenol side, so 6 CO2 on the product side.
Hydrogen: 6 (since phenol has 6 H in C6H5OH?), wait, wait. C6H5OH is C6H6O, so 6 H's? Wait, phenol is C6H5OH, so formula is C6H6O, right? So when it burns, each molecule has 6 H, so produces 3 H2O, since each H2O has 2 H, so 3 H2O gives 6 H. Okay, so H2O is 3 moles.

Oxygen: Let's count. On the reactant side, phenol has 1 O, and O2 is O. On product side, CO2 has 2 O each times 6, so 12 O from CO2, and H2O has 1 O each times 3, so 3 O. Total O in products is 15. On reactant side, phenol has 1 O, so O2 must supply 14 O. Since each O2 is 2 O, number of O2 moles is 14/2 =7.

So the balanced equation is: C6H5OH(s) + 7 O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l).

The enthalpy of combustion is given as -3054 kJ/mol. This is the ΔH for the combustion reaction. But I need the enthalpy of formation, ΔHf°, of phenol.

The formula for calculating ΔH°f (phenol) is based on the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The standard enthalpy change for a reaction is ΔH° = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants). So rearranged, ΔH°f(phenol) = [Σ ΔH°f(products)] - ΔH°(combustion) - [Σ ΔH°f(reactants except phenol)].

Wait, actually, the combustion reaction is the formation of CO2 and H2O from phenol and O2. So the enthalpy change is ΔH°combustion = [sum products] - [sum reactants]. So ΔH°combustion = [6ΔHf°(CO2) + 3ΔHf°(H2O)] - [ΔHf°(C6H5OH) + 7ΔHf°(O2)].

But O2 is in its standard state, so ΔHf°(O2) = 0. So the equation becomes -3054 kJ/mol = [6*(−393.5) + 3*(−285.8)] − [ΔHf°(C6H5OH)].

Wait, I think the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2(g) is about -393.5 kJ/mol and for H2O(l) it's about -285.8 kJ/mol. Let me plug those numbers in.

So, 6*(-393.5) = -2361 kJ, and 3*(-285.8) = -857.4 kJ. Adding them gives -2361 -857.4 = -3218.4 kJ. 

So ΔH°combustion = (-3218.4) - [ΔHf°(C6H5OH)] = -3054 kJ. So rearranging:

-3218.4 - ΔHf°(C6H5OH) = -3054. 

So, -ΔHf°(C6H5OH) = -3054 + 3218.4 = 164.4. 

Thus, ΔHf°(C6H5OH) = -164.4 kJ/mol. Wait, wait, wait. Because:

Wait, the equation is:

-3054 = [sum products] - [sum reactants] = (-3218.4) - [ΔHf°(phenol) + 0].

So:

-3054 = (-3218.4) - ΔHf°(phenol). 

So, rearranged:

ΔHf°(phenol) = (-3218.4) - (-3054) = -3218.4 + 3054 = -164.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, that seems right. So the standard enthalpy of formation of phenol is approximately -164.4 kJ/mol.

Now, I need the Gibbs energy of formation, which is ΔGf°. For that, I use the equation:

ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔSf°.

Wait, but wait, ΔSf° is the standard molar entropy of the substance. Or is it the entropy change for the formation reaction? Hmm, no, I think I need the entropy change for the formation reaction. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the Gibbs energy of formation is calculated using the standard Gibbs free energy of formation, which is given by:

ΔGf° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants).

But since the standard Gibbs free energies of formation of elements in their standard states are zero, for the formation reaction, which is the reverse of combustion. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the relation between ΔG°, ΔH°, and TΔS°.

Alternatively, since I can calculate ΔG° for the combustion reaction first, then find ΔGf°(phenol).

Wait, the standard Gibbs energy of reaction (ΔGrxn°) can be calculated using ΔGrxn° = ΔHrxn° - TΔSrxn°.

But wait, the question gives the standard molar entropy of phenol, S°(C6H5OH) = 144.0 J/K/mol. So I need to find the entropy change for the combustion reaction.

For the combustion reaction: C6H5OH(s) + 7 O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l).

The entropy change ΔS° is [6*S°(CO2) + 3*S°(H2O)] - [S°(C6H5OH) + 7*S°(O2)].

S° values: O2(g) is 205.0 J/K/mol. CO2(g) is 213.7 J/K/mol. H2O(l) is 69.9 J/K/mol. Phenol is 144.0 J/K/mol.

So plug in the numbers:

6*213.7 = 1282.2 J/K, 
3*69.9 = 209.7 J/K.
Sum products: 1282.2 + 209.7 = 1491.9 J/K.

Reactants: 144.0 (phenol) + 7*205.0 = 144 + 1435 = 1579 J/K.

So ΔS° = 1491.9 - 1579 = -87.1 J/K. Oh, that's negative, which makes sense for a solid forming gases, but in this case, because H2O is liquid, the entropy might decrease.

Wait, but let me confirm the numbers:

CO2(g): 213.7 J/K/mol
H2O(l): 69.9 J/K/mol
O2(g): 205.0 J/K/mol
C6H5OH(s): 144.0 J/K/mol.

So:

Products entropy: 6*213.7 + 3*69.9 = 6*213.7 is 1282.2, 3*69.9 is 209.7. Total 1491.9 J/K.

Reactants entropy: 1*144.0 + 7*205.0 = 144 + 1435 = 1579 J/K.

So ΔS° = 1491.9 - 1579 = -87.1 J/K.

Wait, that's correct. So ΔS° is -87.1 J/K, which is -87.1 * 1e-3 kJ/K.

Now, the temperature is 298 K, so TΔS° = 298 * (-87.1e-3) = let's calculate that.

298 * 0.0871 = let's see: 300 * 0.0871 ≈ 26.13, but since it's 298, which is 2 less, so 26.13 - (2*0.0871)= 26.13 - 0.1742 = 25.9558. But since ΔS is negative, it's -25.9558 kJ.

Wait, actually, no, because 87.1 J/K is 0.0871 kJ/K. So 298 * (-0.0871) = let's compute:

298 * 0.0871 = approximately 298 * 0.08 = 23.84, 298 * 0.0071 ≈ 2.1178. Sum is ≈25.9578. So with the negative sign, it's -25.9578 kJ.

So TΔS° = -25.9578 kJ.

Now, the enthalpy change for combustion is ΔH° = -3054 kJ/mol.

So the Gibbs energy change for combustion is ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° = (-3054) - (-25.9578) = -3054 +25.9578 = -3028.0422 kJ/mol.

But wait, I'm supposed to find the Gibbs energy of formation of phenol. So the formation reaction is the reverse of the combustion reaction. Let me clarify.

The combustion reaction is: C6H5OH(s) + 7 O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l), ΔG° = -3028.04 kJ/mol.

The formation reaction would be the reverse: 6 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l) → C6H5OH(s) + 7 O2(g).

The ΔG° for this reverse reaction is +3028.04 kJ/mol.

But that's the ΔG° for the formation of phenol from its elements. So the standard Gibbs energy of formation of phenol is 3028.04 kJ/mol? That can't be right because the options are negative. Wait, no, because I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no, because the question is asking for the standard Gibbs energy of formation, which is defined as the change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So the formation reaction is:

C6H5OH(s) → 6 C (graphite) + 3 H2(g)/2 + 1/2 O2(g).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The correct formation reaction is:

6 C(graphite) + 3 H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → C6H5OH(s).

So the ΔGf° is the Gibbs energy change for this reaction.

But I have the ΔG° for the combustion reaction, which is the reverse of the formation. So the ΔG° for combustion is -3028.04 kJ/mol. Therefore, the ΔG° for the formation reaction is the negative of that, which is +3028.04 kJ/mol. But that's a positive value, and the options are all negative. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the Gibbs energy of combustion. Let me double-check the calculation.

ΔG° for combustion is ΔH° - TΔS°. ΔH° is -3054 kJ/mol, TΔS° is (298 K)(-87.1 J/K/mol) = -25.9578 kJ/mol. So ΔG° = (-3054) - (-25.9578) = -3054 +25.9578 = -3028.0422 kJ/mol. So that's correct.

But that's the Gibbs energy for the combustion reaction. So the formation reaction is the reverse, so ΔGf° = +3028.04 kJ/mol. But all the options are negative. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate ΔGf° directly using the formula ΔGf° = ΔHf° - T*S°f? Wait, but wait, no, that's not correct. Because S°f is the standard molar entropy of phenol. Wait, no, S°f is the entropy change for the formation reaction.

Wait, no. The standard molar entropy (S°) of a substance is the entropy of 1 mole of that substance in its standard state. So for the formation reaction, the entropy change is:

ΔS° = [S°(products)] - [S°(reactants)].

The products of the formation reaction (6 C, 3 H2, 1/2 O2) would have their own S° values. So maybe I should compute ΔS° for the formation reaction and then calculate ΔG°f using ΔG°f = ΔH°f - TΔS°f.

But that might be another approach. Let me try that.

The formation reaction is:

6 C(graphite) + 3 H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → C6H5OH(s).

The entropy change for this reaction is:

ΔS° = [S°(C6H5OH)] - [6*S°(C) + 3*S°(H2) + (1/2)*S°(O2)].

S° values:
C(graphite): 5.74 J/K/mol
H2(g): 130.7 J/K/mol
O2(g): 205.0 J/K/mol
C6H5OH(s): 144.0 J/K/mol.

So:

ΔS° = 144.0 - [6*5.74 + 3*130.7 + (1/2)*205.0].

Calculating each term:

6*5.74 = 34.44
3*130.7 = 392.1
(1/2)*205.0 = 102.5

Sum of reactants entropy: 34.44 + 392.1 + 102.5 = 529.04 J/K.

So ΔS° = 144.0 - 529.04 = -385.04 J/K = -385.04e-3 kJ/K.

Now, TΔS° = 298 K * (-385.04e-3 kJ/K) = let's compute 298 * (-385.04) / 1000.

298 * 385.04 ≈ let's compute 300 * 385 = 115500, but minus 2*385=770, so 115500-770=114730. But it's 385.04, so approximately 114730 + (0.04*298)=114730 + 11.92 ≈114741.92 J. Since it's negative, it's -114.74192 kJ.

So TΔS° = -114.74192 kJ.

Now, ΔHf° is -164.4 kJ/mol, as calculated earlier.

So ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔS° = (-164.4) - (-114.74) ≈ (-164.4) + 114.74 ≈ -49.66 kJ/mol.

Hmm, that's approximately -50 kJ/mol, which matches option C: -50 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, in the combustion approach, I got ΔGf°(combustion) as -3028 kJ/mol, which would make the formation reaction's ΔG°f as +3028 kJ/mol, which contradicts the options. So perhaps the second approach is correct.

Wait, let me recheck the second approach. The formation reaction is 6 C + 3 H2 + 1/2 O2 → C6H5OH(s).

So ΔGf° is the Gibbs energy for this reaction, which I calculated as:

ΔHf° = -164.4 kJ/mol,

ΔS° = -385.04 J/K = -385.04e-3 kJ/K.

So ΔGf° = (-164.4) - (298)(-0.38504) = (-164.4) + (298 * 0.38504).

Calculating 298 * 0.38504:

0.38504 ≈ 0.385,

298 * 0.385 = let's compute:

300 * 0.385 = 115.5,

But it's 298, so 115.5 - (2 * 0.385) = 115.5 - 0.77 = 114.73.

So 298 * 0.38504 ≈ 114.74.

So ΔGf° = (-164.4) + 114.74 ≈ (-164.4) + 114.74 = -49.66 kJ/mol, which rounds to approximately -50 kJ/mol.

So the correct answer should be option C: -50 kJ/mol.
</think>

To calculate the standard Gibbs energy of formation of phenol at 298 K, we use the relationship:

\[
\Delta G_f^\circ = \Delta H_f^\circ - T\Delta S_f^\circ
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of phenol
The combustion reaction of phenol is:

\[
\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}(s) + 7\mathrm{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 6\mathrm{CO}_2(g) + 3\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(l)
\]

The standard enthalpy of combustion is given as \(-3054 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\). Using the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{combustion}} = \left[6\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{CO}_2) + 3\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})\right] - \left[\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}) + 7\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{O}_2)\right]
\]

Since \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{O}_2) = 0\), we rearrange to solve for \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH})\):

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}) = \left[6\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{CO}_2) + 3\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})\right] - \Delta H^\circ_{\text{combustion}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{CO}_2) = -393.5 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}, \quad \Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}) = -285.8 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}) = \left[6(-393.5) + 3(-285.8)\right] - (-3054)
\]

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}) = -3218.4 + 3054 = -164.4 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the entropy change for the formation reaction
The formation reaction is:

\[
6\mathrm{C}(graphite) + 3\mathrm{H}_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}(s)
\]

The entropy change is:

\[
\Delta S^\circ = S^\circ(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}) - \left[6S^\circ(\mathrm{C}) + 3S^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2) + \frac{1}{2}S^\circ(\mathrm{O}_2)\right]
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
S^\circ(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}) = 144.0 \, \mathrm{J/K/mol}, \quad S^\circ(\mathrm{C}) = 5.74 \, \mathrm{J/K/mol}, \quad S^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2) = 130.7 \, \mathrm{J/K/mol}, \quad S^\circ(\mathrm{O}_2) = 205.0 \, \mathrm{J/K/mol}
\]

\[
\Delta S^\circ = 144.0 - \left[6(5.74) + 3(130.7) + \frac{1}{2}(205.0)\right]
\]

\[
\Delta S^\circ = 144.0 - \left[34.44 + 392.1 + 102.5\right] = 144.0 - 529.04 = -385.04 \, \mathrm{J/K/mol}
\]

Convert to \(\mathrm{kJ/K/mol}\):
\[
\Delta S^\circ = -385.04 \times 10^{-3} = -0.38504 \, \mathrm{kJ/K/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Gibbs energy of formation
Using the equation:

\[
\Delta G_f^\circ = \Delta H_f^\circ - T\Delta S_f^\circ
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = -164.4 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}, \quad T = 298 \, \mathrm{K}, \quad \Delta S_f^\circ = -0.38504 \, \mathrm{kJ/K/mol}
\]

\[
\Delta G_f^\circ = -164.4 - (298)(-0.38504)
\]

\[
\Delta G_f^\circ = -164.4 + 114.74 = -49.66 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The standard Gibbs energy of formation of phenol at 298 K is approximately \(-50 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\), which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
