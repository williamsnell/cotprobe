Question:

Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle.

Options:

A: Cardiac muscle has a metabolism similar to smooth muscle, designed for quick, short bursts of activity.
B: Cardiac muscle cells are multinucleated and arranged in a non-striated pattern.
C: Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle. It is striated, has numerous nuclei per cell, is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and its metabolism is designed for endurance.
D: Cardiac muscle lacks intercalated discs, which differentiates it from skeletal and smooth muscle.
E: Cardiac muscle does not have any similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle
F: Cardiac muscle is innervated by the somatic nervous system, similar to skeletal muscle.
G: Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle
H: Cardiac muscle has a metabolism designed for speed and strength
I: Cardiac muscle is not striated and has a single nucleus per cell, similar to smooth muscle.
J: Cardiac muscle is identical to smooth muscle in both structure and function.

Okay, so I have this question about comparing cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle. I'm a bit rusty on my muscle types, but I'll try to think through it. Let me start by recalling what I know about each type of muscle.

First, there are three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Each has different structures, functions, and locations.

Skeletal muscle is the one we voluntary control, like when we move our arms or legs. It's striated, meaning it has those visible stripes because of the arrangement of the contractile fibers. Skeletal muscle cells are long and multinucleated, having multiple nuclei along their length. They get their nervous input from the somatic nervous system, which is why we can move them on command. They're also designed for activities that require strength and speed, like running or lifting.

Smooth muscle, on the other hand, is involuntary. It's found in places like the stomach, blood vessels, and respiratory tract, helping with functions like digestion and regulating blood flow. Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped and have a single nucleus each. They're non-striated, so no visible stripes. Their metabolism is more suited for slow, sustained contractions, like the slow, rhythmic movements of the intestines. They're controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

Then there's cardiac muscle, which is specific to the heart. The heart is a organ that's always working, so the muscle here needs to be efficient and sustainable. Cardiac muscle cells are also striated, like skeletal muscle, which means they have those stripes. That's interesting because smooth isn't. So that's a point where cardiac is similar to skeletal.

I remember that cardiac muscle cells are usually mononucleated, having one nucleus each, unlike skeletal which has multiple. But wait, I think some sources say they can have two nuclei. So maybe that's not a big difference. Also, cardiac muscle has these structures called intercalated discs, which are unique to it. These discs help the heart contract in a synchronized way, ensuring that the muscle cells all fire together efficiently.

The innervation part: skeletal is controlled by the somatic nervous system, while smooth and cardiac are under the autonomic. So cardiac is similar to smooth in that sense. But wait, the question is about comparing to both. So in the options, if one says cardiac is innervated by autonomic, that's accurate.

Metabolism-wise, skeletal muscles are glycolytic, relying on quick energy for bursts of activity. Smooth muscles are more oxidative, using slower processes. But cardiac muscles, since they work non-stop, need a steady supply of energy. They have a high capacity for aerobic respiration, making them efficient for endurance rather than short, quick bursts.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Cardiac has metabolism similar to smooth, quick activity. Hmm, smooth is slow, so this might not be right. Also, cardiac isn't for quick bursts; it's steady, so maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: Cardiac cells are multinucleated and non-striated. No, I thought they're usually mono- or maybe bi-nucleated and they are striated. So B is wrong.

Option C: Cardiac shows characteristics of both. Striated, numerous nuclei? Wait, no, they have one or maybe two, not numerous. So maybe C is incorrect. Or wait, do they have numerous? Maybe I'm wrong. Let me think. No, I think each cardiac cell has one nucleus, so C's part about numerous nuclei is wrong.

Option D: Cardiac lacks intercalated discs. No, that's the opposite. They have them, so D is incorrect.

Option E: No similarities. That's wrong, since they share some traits like being striated and autonomic control.

Option F: Innervated by somatic. No, cardiac uses autonomic, so F is wrong.

Option G: Similar to skeletal but not smooth. Partially true, but it's also similar to smooth in some aspects, so maybe G is not the best answer.

Option H: Metabolism for speed and strength. No, cardiac is for endurance, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Not striated, single nucleus, similar to smooth. No, cardiac is striated and has one or two nuclei, so I is wrong.

Option J: Identical to smooth. No, because smooth isn't striated, so J is wrong.

Wait, so looking back, option C says cardiac has numerous nuclei. But I thought each has one. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me check my notes. Oh, wait, some sources say that during development, cardiac cells can have two nuclei, but generally, they're mononucleated. So option C's statement about numerous nuclei is incorrect. So C's first part about striated is correct, but the nuclei part might be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. So the correct characteristics of cardiac muscle: it's striated (like skeletal), has intercalated discs, is involuntary (autonomic), and has a metabolism suited for endurance, not quick bursts.

Looking at the options again, which one matches these points.

Option C says: It is striated, has numerous nuclei, innervated by autonomic, has intercalated discs, metabolism for endurance.

Wait, the part about numerous nuclei might be wrong. But maybe I'm confusing. Let me think: smooth has one nucleus, skeletal has multiple, and cardiac has one. So if option C says numerous, that's incorrect. So C is wrong.

Wait, but the other options don't fit as well. Let's see:

Option C is the only one that combines aspects from both skeletal and smooth. It's striated (like skeletal), autonomic (like smooth), has intercalated discs, which are unique to cardiac. So the only issue is the number of nuclei. If option C says "numerous nuclei" like skeletal, that's incorrect because cardiac has one. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, then which option is correct? Let me reread all options.

Option C: striated, numerous nuclei, autonomic, intercalated discs, endurance metabolism.

But if numerous nuclei is wrong, then C is wrong. So which option is correct?

Looking again, perhaps the correct answer is C, because it's the only one that correctly identifies that cardiac shares some features with both, except for the nuclei part. Or maybe the 'numerous' part is a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing multinucleated with numerous. Maybe in some cases, like in pathological conditions, they can have more, but generally, they have one. So the statement in C is incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer isn't C. Let me look for another option.

Option G: similar to skeletal but not smooth. That's partially true, but cardiac is also similar to smooth in being involuntary. So the question is about comparing to both, so the correct option should show that.

Wait, maybe option C is correct despite the nuclei part. Let me see the exact wording. Option C says "has numerous nuclei per cell." But if each has only one, then that's wrong. So perhaps C is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the nuclei. Let me think: skeletal muscles are multinucleated because they're long and have multiple nuclei. Cardiac muscle cells are shorter and usually have one nucleus, but I've read that some can have two. So "numerous" would be incorrect. So option C is wrong in that part.

Hmm, but the other options don't seem to fit as well. Let me think again. Maybe option C is correct except for the nuclei, but perhaps the question considers "numerous" as correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the nuclei count.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the other aspects. Let's think: which option correctly lists multiple correct characteristics?

Option C says: striated (correct), numerous nuclei (maybe incorrect), autonomic (correct), intercalated discs (correct), endurance metabolism (correct). So four correct points and one possibly wrong. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, as it's the only option that combines aspects from both skeletal and smooth. Maybe the nuclei part is a mistake, but the other aspects are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the best fit is C.

Wait, another approach: think about each option's correctness.

Option C: "has numerous nuclei per cell." If 'numerous' is incorrect, then C is wrong. But perhaps in the question, the option is correct. Maybe I'm wrong about the nuclei count.

Wait, let me think: skeletal muscle is multinucleated, with many nuclei. Cardiac is typically uninucleated, but some sources say they can have two. So "numerous" is definitely not correct for cardiac. So option C is incorrect.

Hmm, so perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at option G: "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle." That's not accurate because cardiac shares some traits with smooth, like autonomic control.

Option H: metabolism for speed and strength. No, it's the opposite.

Option C is the only one that combines aspects from both, except for the nuclei part. So maybe the answer is C, and perhaps the 'numerous' is a mistake, but it's the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, and I should go with that.

The question compares cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle. Cardiac muscle is striated, controlled by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and is designed for endurance. It typically has one nucleus per cell, unlike skeletal muscle, which is multinucleated. Smooth muscle is non-striated, has a single nucleus, and is also autonomic but designed for slow, sustained contractions.

Option C states that cardiac muscle is striated, has numerous nuclei, is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and has an endurance metabolism. While most aspects are correct, the claim that cardiac muscle has "numerous nuclei" is inaccurate, as it usually has one nucleus. Despite this error, Option C is the best fit as it captures the hybrid nature of cardiac muscle, combining features from both skeletal and smooth muscles.

Answer: C
