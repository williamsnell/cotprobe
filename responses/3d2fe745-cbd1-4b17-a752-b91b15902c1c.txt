Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. It involves an equilibrium reaction and finding the ratio of two concentrations. Hmm, sounds like a buffer solution problem maybe?

The reaction given is CO₂ + 2H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + HCO₃⁻. I remember that CO₂ in water forms carbonic acid, which then dissociates into H+ and HCO3⁻. So this is the first dissociation step of carbonic acid, I think. The K_a given is 4.3 × 10^-7, and the pH is 7.40. They want the ratio of [HCO3⁻] to [CO2].

Wait, K_a is for the reaction where CO₂ reacts with water to form HCO3⁻ and H+. So the expression for K_a should be [H+][HCO3⁻]/[CO₂] = 4.3e-7.

Right, and because pH is 7.40, the [H+] concentration is 10^-7.4. Let me calculate that. 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.4 is about 0.398, so 1e-7 * 0.398 ≈ 3.98e-8 M. Wait, wait, no, actually, 10^-7.4 is the same as 10^(-7 -0.4)=10^-7 * 10^-0.4. 10^-0.4 is approximately 0.398, so [H+] ≈ 3.98e-8 M.

Wait, but wait, the K_a expression is K_a = [H+][HCO3^-]/[CO2]. So rearranging that, [HCO3^-]/[CO2] = K_a / [H+]. Because if I multiply both sides by [CO2], I get [HCO3^-] = (K_a [CO2])/[H+]. So the ratio [HCO3^-]/[CO2] is K_a / [H+].

So plugging in the numbers: K_a is 4.3e-7, and [H+] is 3.98e-8. So 4.3e-7 divided by 3.98e-8. Let me compute that.

4.3e-7 / 3.98e-8 = (4.3 / 3.98) * (1e-7 / 1e-8) = approximately (1.08) * 10 = 10.8.

Wait, let me compute 4.3 / 3.98 more accurately. 3.98 is approximately 4, so 4.3/4 is 1.075. So 1.075 * 10 is 10.75. Oh, that's one of the options. Option B is 10.75.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the [H+] calculation. Because pH is 7.40, so [H+] = 10^-7.40 exactly. Let me compute that more accurately.

10^-7.40 is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.40). 10^(-0.40) is the same as 1/(10^0.40). 10^0.4 is about 2.5118864315 because 10^0.3 ≈ 2, 10^0.4 is about 2.51. So 1/2.511886 ≈ 0.398. So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.398 = 3.98e-8 M.

So the ratio is (4.3e-7) / (3.98e-8) ≈ (4.3 / 0.398) * (1e-7 / 1e-8) → Wait, no, perhaps I should compute 4.3e-7 divided by 3.98e-8.

4.3e-7 = 4.3 * 1e-7
3.98e-8 = 3.98 * 1e-8

Dividing them: (4.3 / 3.98) * (1e-7 / 1e-8) = (approx 1.08) * 10 = 10.8. But earlier I thought it was 10.75 because 4.3/3.98 is about 1.08 when I'm approximating. Wait, maybe I should compute 4.3 / 3.98 more accurately.

3.98 * 1.08 = 4.3? Let's check: 3.98 * 1.08 = 3.98*(1 +0.08)=3.98 + 0.3184=4.2984. Which is very close to 4.3. So 4.3 /3.98 ≈ 1.08. So 1.08 * 10 = 10.8. But wait, if I do it more precisely, maybe it's 10.75.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more exact numbers. Let me compute 4.3 divided by 3.98 exactly.

3.98 times 1.08 is 4.2984. That's very close to 4.3, so 4.3/3.98 ≈ 1.08.

So 1.08 * 10 is 10.8. But wait, looking at the options, B is 10.75 and C is 8.35, etc. So perhaps I'm a bit off.

Wait another approach: maybe I should compute [HCO3^-]/[CO2] = K_a / [H+].

Wait, no, K_a = [H+][HCO3^-]/[CO2], so rearranging gives [HCO3^-]/[CO2] = K_a/[H+].

So K_a is 4.3e-7, [H+] is 1e-7.40.

Let me compute [H+] precisely. pH=7.40, so [H+] = 10^-7.40 = precisely, using a calculator, 10^-7.40 is approximately 3.9811e-8 M.

So 4.3e-7 divided by 3.9811e-8.

Let me compute that: 4.3e-7 / 3.9811e-8 = (4.3 / 3.9811) * 10.

4.3 / 3.9811 ≈ 1.08. So 1.08 *10 = 10.8.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 4.3 / 3.9811.

3.9811 * 1.08 = 4.2994. Which is 4.2994, just under 4.3. So 4.3 -4.2994=0.0006. So 0.0006 /3.9811 ≈ 0.00015.

So 1.08 + 0.00015 ≈ 1.08015. So 1.08015 *10 = 10.8015. So approximately 10.80.

Looking at the options, B is 10.75 and D is 11.20. Hmm, but I get around 10.8, which isn't exactly an option. Option B is 10.75, which is a bit lower. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps K_a is for the reaction as written, but sometimes, people might use the second dissociation of carbonic acid. Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, carbonic acid (H2CO3) dissociates in two steps:

1. H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3^- (K_a1 ≈ 4.3e-7)
2. HCO3^- ⇌ H+ + CO3^2- (K_a2 ≈ 4.8e-11)

In this problem, the reaction given is CO2 + 2H2O ⇌ H3O+ + HCO3^-. Which is the same as H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3^-, so K_a is 4.3e-7, correct.

So my approach is correct. So why am I not getting an option that's exactly 10.8? Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:5.90
B:10.75
C:8.35
D:11.20
E:6.80
F:12.45
G:4.50
H:9.60
I:7.25
J:14.00

Hmm, 10.8 is not an option, but B is 10.75 and D is 11.20. Maybe I made a mistake in the [H+] calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate [H+] more accurately. Let's compute 10^-7.40 precisely.

Using a calculator, 10^-7.40 is equal to 10^(−7) × 10^(−0.40). 10^−0.40 is the same as 1/(10^0.40). Let's compute 10^0.40 more accurately.

10^0.40: Let's compute it.

We know that log10(2.511886) ≈ 0.4, because 10^0.4 ≈ 2.511886. So 10^0.40 = 2.51188643150958. Therefore, 10^-0.40 = 1 / 2.51188643150958 ≈ 0.398117095.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.398117095 = 3.98117095e-8 M.

So now, K_a =4.3e-7, [H+]=3.98117095e-8.

So [HCO3^-]/[CO2] = (4.3e-7) / (3.98117095e-8) = ?

Let me compute 4.3e-7 divided by 3.98117e-8.

4.3e-7 = 430e-9
3.98117e-8 = 39.8117e-9

So 430e-9 / 39.8117e-9 = 430 / 39.8117 ≈ 10.8.

Wait, 430 divided by 39.8117 is approximately 10.8 because 39.8117 ×10=398.117, and 39.8117 ×10.8 = 398.117 + (39.8117 ×0.8)=398.117 +31.849=429.966, which is very close to 430. So 430/39.8117 ≈10.8.

So the ratio is approximately 10.8, but the options don't have that. The closest is B:10.75 and D:11.20. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 4.3 / 3.98117095.

Let me do this division step by step.

3.98117095 ×1.08 = ?

3.98117095 ×1 =3.98117095
3.98117095 ×0.08=0.318493676
Adding them:3.98117095 +0.318493676=4.299664626.

Which is very close to 4.3, so 3.98117095 ×1.08=4.299664626.

The difference between 4.3 and 4.299664626 is 0.000335374.

So how much more than 1.08 do we need to multiply 3.98117095 to get exactly 4.3?

Let me compute 0.000335374 /3.98117095 ≈0.0000842 approximately.

So 1.08 +0.0000842=1.0800842.

So 3.98117095 ×1.0800842 ≈4.3.

Therefore, 4.3 /3.98117095≈1.0800842.

So [HCO3^-]/[CO2] =1.0800842 ×10=10.800842.

So approximately 10.80. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is written as CO2 + 2H2O ⇌ H3O+ + HCO3^-, which means the K_a is [H3O+][HCO3^-]/[CO2][H2O]^2. But since H2O is a pure liquid, its concentration is taken as 1, so K_a = [H+][HCO3^-]/[CO2].

Wait, that's correct. So my approach is right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the activity coefficients or something else, but I think in this problem we can ignore that and proceed with concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the K_a value. The problem states K_a is 4.3e-7, which matches the first dissociation of carbonic acid. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 10.8. The closest higher option is D:11.20, and lower is B:10.75.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate 4.3e-7 divided by 3.98117e-8.

4.3e-7 is 430e-9.

3.98117e-8 is 39.8117e-9.

So 430 /39.8117= ?

Let me compute 39.8117 ×10=398.117.

430-398.117=31.883.

So 31.883 /39.8117 ≈0.7999, so approximately 0.8.

So 10 +0.8=10.8.

So 430 /39.8117≈10.8. So 10.8 is the ratio.

But since the options don't have 10.8, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait another angle: the reaction is CO2 + 2H2O ⇌ H3O+ + HCO3^-.

Wait, but in terms of H2CO3, it's H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3^-. So K_a is 4.3e-7.

Alternatively, sometimes K_a is given for the reaction H2CO3 ⇌ HCO3^- + H+, which is the same as what's here.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Because the problem is about the ratio of HCO3^- to CO2, which is the same as the ratio of conjugate base to acid in a buffer solution.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the base is HCO3^-, and the acid is CO2 (since it can donate a proton to become HCO3^-).

So pH = pKa + log([HCO3^-]/[CO2]).

We can rearrange this to find [HCO3^-]/[CO2] = 10^(pH - pKa).

Given pH is 7.40, pKa is log(4.3e-7)= ?

Compute pKa: log(4.3e-7)= log(4.3) + log(1e-7)= ~0.6335 + (-7)= -6.3665.

So pH - pKa =7.40 - (-6.3665)=7.40 +6.3665=13.7665.

So [HCO3^-]/[CO2]=10^13.7665.

Wait, that can't be right because that's a huge number, but that's not matching any of the options either. Wait, wait, that can't be correct because 10^13.76 is enormous, but the options are all single digits or up to 14. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of pKa. K_a is 4.3e-7, so pKa is -log(4.3e-7).

Let me compute that correctly. log(4.3e-7)= log(4.3) + log(1e-7)= 0.6335 -7 = -6.3665.

So pKa=6.3665? Wait, no, wait: pKa is -log(K_a), which is -log(4.3e-7)=6.3665. Because log(4.3e-7)= log(4.3)+log(1e-7)=0.6335-7= -6.3665. So pKa is 6.3665.

Wait, no, wait a second: Wait, pKa is defined as -log(K_a). K_a is 4.3e-7, so pKa is 7 - log(4.3). Because log(4.3e-7)= log(4.3) + log(1e-7)= log(4.3) -7. So pKa is -(log(4.3) -7)=7 - log(4.3).

Compute that: log(4.3)=0.6335. So pKa=7 -0.6335=6.3665.

So now, pH is 7.40.

So pH - pKa=7.40 -6.3665=1.0335.

So [HCO3^-]/[CO2]=10^(1.0335)=10^(1 +0.0335)=10^1 *10^0.0335≈10 *1.08=10.8.

Wait, that's the same answer as before. So the ratio is approximately 10.8. But the options don't have 10.8. Hmm.

Wait, but in the options, B is 10.75, which is very close to 10.8. So perhaps the correct answer is B:10.75.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 10^0.0335 more accurately.

10^0.0335: Let me compute that using logarithm tables or a calculator.

We know that ln(10^0.0335)=0.0335 * ln(10)=0.0335 *2.302585≈0.0772.

So e^0.0772 ≈1 +0.0772 + (0.0772^2)/2 + (0.0772^3)/6.

Compute each term:

0.0772 ≈0.0772

(0.0772)^2=0.00596, divided by 2 is 0.00298.

(0.0772)^3≈0.00046, divided by 6 is ~0.000077.

Adding up: 1 +0.0772=1.0772; +0.00298=1.07918; +0.000077≈1.07926.

Wait, no, that's for e^0.0772. But 10^0.0335= e^(0.0335 * ln10)=e^0.0772≈1.08.

Wait, so 10^0.0335≈1.08, making the ratio 10 *1.08=10.8.

But the options don't have 10.8, but B is 10.75, which is 0.05 less. Maybe the exact calculation would bring it down a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value of 10^0.0335 is 1.08, so the ratio is 10.8. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 10.75, option B.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact calculation using more precise methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use [H+] as 1e-7.4, which is 3.98e-8, leading to 4.3e-7 /3.98e-8 = (4.3/3.98)*10= approx 10.8, but perhaps the answer is rounded to 10.75.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_a expression. Let me check.

The reaction is CO2 + 2H2O ⇌ H3O+ + HCO3^-.

The K_a expression is [H3O+][HCO3^-]/([CO2][H2O]^2). But since H2O is a pure liquid, its concentration is taken as 1, so effectively, K_a = [H+][HCO3^-]/[CO2].

Yes, that's correct.

So I think the correct ratio is approximately 10.8, but since the options don't have that, the closest one is B:10.75.
</think>

To determine the ratio of the concentrations of bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) to carbon dioxide (CO₂), we start with the equilibrium reaction:

\[
\text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftarrows \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{HCO}_3^-
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_a \) is given as \( 4.3 \times 10^{-7} \), and the pH is \( 7.40 \). The \( K_a \) expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{CO}_2]}
\]

Rearranging to find the ratio \( \frac{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{CO}_2]} \):

\[
\frac{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{CO}_2]} = \frac{K_a}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]

The \([\text{H}^+]\) is calculated from the pH:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.40} \approx 3.98 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{CO}_2]} = \frac{4.3 \times 10^{-7}}{3.98 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 10.8
\]

This calculation yields a ratio of approximately \( 10.8 \). However, the closest option provided is \( 10.75 \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
