Okay, so I have this question about whether the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard Gaussian distribution is log-concave. Hmm, I remember that log-concave means that the logarithm of the function is concave. But wait, is that for the PDF or the CDF?

The standard Gaussian distribution has a PDF given by (1/√(2π)) e^(-t²/2). I think I've heard that the Gaussian distribution is log-concave because its PDF is a product of exponentials, which makes the log of the PDF a concave function. But the question is about the CDF, F(x), which is the integral of the PDF from -infty to x.

So, does the CDF being the integral of a log-concave PDF make it log-concave? I'm not entirely sure. I think that the log-concavity of the CDF depends on the properties of its derivatives. The CDF's derivative is the PDF, which is log-concave. But log-concavity of F(x) would require that ln(F(x)) is concave.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second derivative of ln(F(x)). If the second derivative is negative, then ln(F(x)) is concave, so F(x) is log-concave.

But let me try to compute it. Let's denote F(x) as the CDF. Then, the first derivative is f(x), the PDF. The second derivative of ln(F(x)) would be [F''(x)/F(x)] - [F'(x)]^2 / F(x)^2. Simplifying, that's [F''(x) F(x) - (F'(x))^2 ] / F(x)^2.

Now, F''(x) is the derivative of f(x), which is the derivative of the Gaussian PDF. The Gaussian PDF's derivative is -x e^(-x²/2) / √(2π). So F''(x) = -x f(x). Plugging back into the numerator: [(-x f(x)) F(x) - (f(x))^2 ].

So the numerator becomes f(x) [ -x F(x) - f(x) ]. Since f(x) is always positive, the sign of the numerator depends on (-x F(x) - f(x)). 

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is always negative. For x positive, F(x) approaches 1, so -x F(x) is negative, and subtracting f(x) makes it even more negative. So for positive x, the numerator is negative, making the entire expression negative, so the second derivative of ln(F(x)) is negative, implying concavity.

But what about negative x? Let's say x is very negative. Then F(x) is near 0, and -x is positive. So -x F(x) is positive because x is negative. Let's see: x is negative, so -x is positive, F(x) is small but positive. So -x F(x) is positive. Then subtracting f(x), which is positive, but will (-x F(x) - f(x)) be positive or negative?

Wait, when x is negative and large in magnitude, f(x) is very small because the Gaussian tails decay rapidly. So maybe -x F(x) dominates, making the numerator positive. Then the second derivative would be positive, which would mean that ln(F(x)) is convex there, implying that F(x) is not log-concave everywhere.

Wait, but wait. If the second derivative is positive in some regions and negative in others, then ln(F(x)) isn't concave everywhere. So F(x) wouldn't be log-concave overall.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Maybe I should look for whether F(x) is log-concave, which requires that F''(x) F(x) >= [F'(x)]^2. Because for a function to be log-concave, F''(x)/F(x) <= [F'(x)]^2 / F(x)^2, which would imply F''(x) F(x) <= [F'(x)]^2. Wait, no, wait. The condition for log-concavity is that the function is equal to exp of a concave function. So the function F(x) is log-concave if ln(F(x)) is concave, which requires that the second derivative of ln(F(x)) is <= 0.

So, from before, the second derivative of ln(F(x)) is [F''(x) F(x) - (F'(x))^2 ] / F(x)^2. For this to be <=0, the numerator must be <=0. So F''(x) F(x) - (F'(x))^2 <=0.

We know that F'(x) = f(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^(-x²/2).

F''(x) is the derivative of f(x), which is -x f(x).

So F''(x) F(x) = (-x f(x)) F(x).

So the numerator becomes (-x f(x) F(x)) - (f(x))^2.

So:

F''(x) F(x) - (F'(x))^2 = -x f(x) F(x) - (f(x))^2.

Factor out f(x):

= f(x) [ -x F(x) - f(x) ].

Since f(x) is positive, the sign depends on [ -x F(x) - f(x) ].

So when is [ -x F(x) - f(x) ] <=0?

Let's consider x positive. Then -x is negative. F(x) is between 0 and 1. So -x F(x) is negative. f(x) is positive, so -x F(x) - f(x) is negative - negative = negative? No, wait: -x F(x) is negative, and subtracting f(x) makes it more negative. So overall, the numerator is negative, so the second derivative is negative, which is good for log-concavity.

But for x negative, let's say x is -a where a>0. Then F(x) is F(-a) which is 1 - F(a) because the Gaussian is symmetric. So F(-a) = 1 - F(a). Now, F(-a) is small when a is large.

So let's compute [ -x F(x) - f(x) ] when x is negative. Let x = -a, a>0.

So:

= -(-a) F(-a) - f(-a)
= a (1 - F(a)) - f(a) (since f(-a)=f(a)).

Now, for large a, F(a) approaches 1, so 1 - F(a) is very small. a (1 - F(a)) is of order a e^{-a²/2} because the tail probability decays exponentially. And f(a) is approximately (1/√(2π)) e^{-a²/2}.

So, a (1 - F(a)) ≈ a * (1/(√(2π))) e^{-a²/2} (from the approximation for tails of Gaussian). So:

a (1 - F(a)) ≈ (a / √(2π)) e^{-a²/2}.

And f(a) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-a²/2}.

So the expression becomes approximately:

(a / √(2π)) e^{-a²/2} - (1/√(2π)) e^{-a²/2} = [a - 1]/√(2π) e^{-a²/2}.

For a >1, [a -1] is positive, so this expression is positive. Thus, when a>1, the term [ -x F(x) - f(x) ] is positive, making the numerator positive, so the second derivative of ln(F(x)) is positive, which implies that ln(F(x)) is convex there, meaning F(x) is not log-concave in that region.

Therefore, the CDF of the standard Gaussian isn't log-concave everywhere because for x sufficiently negative, the function's log is convex, not concave.

The question asks whether the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard Gaussian distribution is log-concave. To determine this, we analyze the second derivative of the logarithm of the CDF, \( \ln(F(x)) \). For \( F(x) \) to be log-concave, \( \ln(F(x)) \) must be concave, which requires its second derivative to be non-positive.

The CDF of the standard Gaussian distribution is \( F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2} \, dt \), and its first derivative is the probability density function (PDF), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} \). The second derivative of \( F(x) \) is \( F''(x) = -x f(x) \).

The second derivative of \( \ln(F(x)) \) is given by:

\[
\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \ln(F(x)) = \frac{F''(x) F(x) - (F'(x))^2}{F(x)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( F''(x) = -x f(x) \) and \( F'(x) = f(x) \), the numerator becomes:

\[
F''(x) F(x) - (F'(x))^2 = -x f(x) F(x) - (f(x))^2.
\]

Factoring out \( f(x) \), we get:

\[
f(x) \left[ -x F(x) - f(x) \right].
\]

Since \( f(x) > 0 \), the sign of the numerator depends on \( -x F(x) - f(x) \). For \( x > 0 \), \( -x F(x) \) is negative, and subtracting \( f(x) \) makes the expression negative, ensuring the second derivative is negative, indicating concavity. However, for \( x < 0 \), particularly for large negative \( x \), \( F(x) \) approaches 0, and the term \( -x F(x) \) becomes positive. For sufficiently large negative \( x \), this term dominates, making the numerator positive and the second derivative positive, implying convexity.

Thus, \( \ln(F(x)) \) is not concave everywhere, meaning \( F(x) \) is not log-concave.
