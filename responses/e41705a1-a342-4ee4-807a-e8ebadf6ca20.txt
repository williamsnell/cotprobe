Okay, so I've got this pump problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see. The question is about a model pump and a similar pump that's required to do a different job. 

Alright, the model pump has an impeller diameter of 6 inches. When running at 1200 rpm, it delivers 2 cubic feet per second (cfs) against a head of 16 feet. Now, they want a similar pump to discharge 40 cfs at 600 rpm. I need to find the diameter of this pump and the head it will develop. The options are from A to J, each with different diameters and heads.

Hmm, similar pumps... So, I think this involves similarity laws in pumps. From what I remember, pumps that are geometrically similar follow certain scaling laws for flow rate, head, and power. 

The key thing is that for similar pumps, the flow rate (Q) scales with the cube of the impeller diameter (D), the head (H) scales with the square of the diameter, and the power (P) scales with the fifth power of the diameter. But wait, in this problem, the speed (rpm) is changing as well. So I need to account for both the scaling of the impeller and the change in speed.

Let me write down the given data:

Model pump:
- Diameter, D1 = 6 inches. Wait, but the options are in feet. Oh, right, 6 inches is 0.5 feet.
- Speed, N1 = 1200 rpm
- Flow rate, Q1 = 2 cfs
- Head, H1 = 16 ft

Required pump:
- Speed, N2 = 600 rpm
- Flow rate, Q2 = 40 cfs
- Find D2 and H2.

First, I think I should consider the effect of speed and scaling on the flow rate. Since the pumps are similar, the flow rate depends on both the impeller diameter and the speed. The formula for flow rate in similar pumps is Q ∝ D^3 * N. So, Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1)^3 * (N2/N1).

Plugging in the known values:

40 / 2 = (D2/0.5)^3 * (600 / 1200)

Simplify that:

20 = (D2/0.5)^3 * 0.5

Multiply both sides by 2:

40 = (D2/0.5)^3

So, (D2/0.5)^3 = 40 → D2/0.5 = cube root of 40.

What's the cube root of 40? Let me think. Cube of 3 is 27, cube of 4 is 64. So 3.419 approximately. Because 3.4^3 is about 39.3, close enough.

So D2 = 0.5 ft * 3.419 ≈ 1.7095 ft. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 1.71 ft. That's looking good.

Now, for the head. Head in similar pumps scales with (D)^2 and also with the square of the speed. So H ∝ D^2 * N^2. So the formula would be H2/H1 = (D2/D1)^2 * (N2/N1)^2.

We have H1 =16 ft, D2 is 1.71 ft, D1 is 0.5 ft, N2=600, N1=1200.

So H2 = 16 * ( (1.71 / 0.5)^2 ) * (600/1200)^2.

Calculate each part step by step.

First, (1.71 / 0.5) = 3.42. Squared is 3.42^2 ≈ 11.6964.

Second, (600/1200) = 0.5, squared is 0.25.

Multiply all together: 16 * 11.6964 * 0.25.

16 * 11.6964 = 187.1424. Then 187.1424 * 0.25 = 46.7856 ft. So approximately 46.8 ft.

Looking at the options, option C gives a diameter of 1.71 ft and a head of 46.8 ft. That matches exactly.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Did I mix up any steps?

Flow rate equation: Q2/Q1 = (D2/D1)^3 * (N2/N1). So 40/2 = 20 = (D2/0.5)^3 * 0.5. So 20 = (D2^3)/(0.5^3) *0.5 → 20 = (D2^3)*(0.5^3)^-1 *0.5. Wait, maybe I should write it as (D2/0.5)^3 * (600/1200) = 20.

Yes, that's correct. So (D2/0.5)^3 * 0.5 =20 → (D2/0.5)^3 =40 → D2=0.5 * cube root(40) ≈0.5 *3.419≈1.7095 ft, which rounds to 1.71 ft.

Head calculation: H2 = H1 * (D2/D1)^2 * (N2/N1)^2.

Yes, that's right. So 16 * (3.42)^2 * (0.5)^2 →16 *11.6964 *0.25=46.7856≈46.8 ft.

So the correct answer should be option C: Diameter 1.71 ft, Head 46.8 ft.

The problem involves a model pump with an impeller diameter of 6 inches (0.5 ft), operating at 1200 rpm, delivering 2 cfs against a head of 16 ft. A similar pump is required to discharge 40 cfs at 600 rpm. Using pump similarity laws, the flow rate scales with the cube of the impeller diameter and the speed, while the head scales with the square of both the diameter and the speed.

For the flow rate:
\[
\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \left(\frac{D_2}{D_1}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{N_2}{N_1}
\]
\[
\frac{40}{2} = \left(\frac{D_2}{0.5}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{600}{1200}
\]
\[
20 = \left(\frac{D_2}{0.5}\right)^3 \cdot 0.5
\]
\[
\left(\frac{D_2}{0.5}\right)^3 = 40 \implies \frac{D_2}{0.5} = \sqrt[3]{40} \approx 3.419
\]
\[
D_2 = 0.5 \cdot 3.419 \approx 1.71 \, \text{ft}
\]

For the head:
\[
\frac{H_2}{H_1} = \left(\frac{D_2}{D_1}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)^2
\]
\[
H_2 = 16 \cdot \left(\frac{1.71}{0.5}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{600}{1200}\right)^2
\]
\[
H_2 = 16 \cdot (3.42)^2 \cdot (0.5)^2
\]
\[
H_2 = 16 \cdot 11.6964 \cdot 0.25 \approx 46.8 \, \text{ft}
\]

Thus, the diameter is approximately 1.71 ft, and the head is approximately 46.8 ft.
