Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the size of a steel rectangular column that's hinged at both ends. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that the column is 16 inches long, and it's supporting a compressive load of 15,000 pounds. We need to find the dimensions of the column, given that the breadth is three times the thickness. The options are given from A to J, each with different dimensions.

First, I remember that for columns, the critical factor is whether it's long or short, which determines if it's a long column (where Euler's formula applies) or a short column (where the Rankine-Google formula might be used). Since the column is hinged at both ends, it's effectively a pin-ended column, which is the most ideal condition for buckling. So, I think we're dealing with Euler's formula here.

Euler's formula for the critical load (Pcr) is given by:

Pcr = (π² * E * I) / (L²)

Where:
- E is the modulus of elasticity
- I is the moment of inertia
- L is the length of the column

But wait, the problem mentions a factor of safety of 2.5. That means the actual load the column is designed to handle should be higher than the critical load. So the maximum allowable load (P_allow) would be Pcr divided by the factor of safety.

So, the formula becomes:

P_allow = Pcr / n = (π² * E * I) / (n * L²)

We need to ensure that the compressive load (15,000 lbs) does not exceed this allowable load. So,

15,000 lbs ≤ (π² * E * I) / (n * L²)

Given:
- E = 30 × 10^6 psi
- L = 16 inches
- n = 2.5
- Load P = 15,000 lbs
- Elastic limit = 40,000 psi (but I'm not sure if this is needed yet)

The column is rectangular, so its cross-sectional area is A = breadth * thickness. The breadth is 3 times the thickness, so let me denote thickness as t. Then, breadth b = 3t. So, A = 3t * t = 3t².

The moment of inertia I for a rectangular section is given by:

I = (b * t³)/12

Substituting b = 3t,

I = (3t * t³)/12 = (3t^4)/12 = t^4 / 4.

So now, substituting I into the allowable load formula:

P_allow = (π² * E * (t^4 /4)) / (n * L²)

Let me plug in the numbers:

E = 30e6 psi
L = 16 in
n = 2.5
P_allow = 15,000 lbs

So,

15,000 = (π² * 30e6 * (t^4 /4)) / (2.5 * (16)^2)

Wait, let me compute the denominator and numerator separately.

First, compute the denominator: 2.5 * (16)^2 = 2.5 * 256 = 640.

Now the equation becomes:

15,000 = (π² * 30e6 * t^4 /4 ) / 640

Simplify the denominator:

= (π² * 30e6 * t^4) / (4 * 640)
= (π² * 30e6 * t^4) / 2560

So,

15,000 = (π² * 30e6 * t^4) / 2560

Multiply both sides by 2560:

15,000 * 2560 = π² * 30e6 * t^4

Calculate 15,000 * 2560:

15,000 * 2560 = 38,400,000

So,

38,400,000 = π² * 30e6 * t^4

Divide both sides by (π² * 30e6):

t^4 = 38,400,000 / (π² * 30e6)

Compute π²: approximately 9.8696

So,

t^4 = 38,400,000 / (9.8696 * 30e6)
t^4 = 38,400,000 / (296,088,000)
t^4 ≈ 0.12966

Take the fourth root to find t:

t ≈ (0.12966)^(1/4)

Hmm, let's compute that. The fourth root of 0.12966.

Let me think: 0.12966 is approximately 0.12966.

Let me compute the square root first: sqrt(0.12966) ≈ 0.36. Then sqrt(0.36) is 0.6.

Wait, wait. Let me check:

0.36^4 = (0.36)^2 * (0.36)^2 = 0.1296 * 0.1296 ≈ 0.016796, which is way smaller than 0.12966. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.12966^(1/4).

Let me compute ln(0.12966) ≈ -2.042.

Divide by 4: -0.5105.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.5105) ≈ 0.600.

Wait, 0.6^4 = 0.6 *0.6=0.36; 0.36*0.36=0.1296. Oh! So 0.6^4 is 0.1296, which is very close to 0.12966.

So, t ≈ 0.6 inches.

So, the thickness (t) is approximately 0.6 inches.

Then, the breadth is 3 times that, so b = 3 * 0.6 = 1.8 inches.

So, the dimensions would be 1.8 inches by 0.6 inches, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let's do the math again step by step.

We have:

P_allow = (π² * E * I) / (n * L²)

We set P_allow to 15,000 lbs.

I = (b t³)/12 = (3t * t³)/12 = (3t^4)/12 = t^4 /4.

So,

15,000 = (π² * 30e6 * (t^4 /4)) / (2.5 * 16^2)

Calculate denominator: 2.5 * 256 = 640.

So,

15,000 = (π² * 30e6 * t^4) / (4 * 640)
= (π² * 30e6 * t^4) / 2560

Multiply both sides by 2560:

15,000 * 2560 = π² * 30e6 * t^4

15,000 * 2560 = 38,400,000.

So,

38,400,000 = π² * 30e6 * t^4

Divide both sides by π² * 30e6:

t^4 = 38,400,000 / (π² * 30e6)
= 38,400,000 / (9.8696 * 30,000,000)
= 38,400,000 / 296,088,000
≈ 0.12966.

So,

t^4 ≈ 0.12966 → t ≈ (0.12966)^(1/4) ≈ 0.6 inches.

Therefore, breadth is 1.8 inches, and thickness is 0.6 inches. That's option B.

Wait, but let me check if any other option is close. Option F is 2x0.6, but that's a different aspect ratio. Our calculation shows that the breadth is 1.8 and thickness 0.6, so option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the elastic limit is a factor. The elastic limit is 40,000 psi, which is the yield strength. The stress should be below this. So, the stress in the column should be less than 40,000 psi.

Let me calculate the stress to ensure that.

The stress (σ) is P/A.

A = 3t * t = 3t².

With t = 0.6 inches, A = 3*(0.6)^2 = 3*0.36 = 1.08 in².

So, σ = 15,000 / 1.08 ≈ 13,888.89 psi, which is well below 40,000 psi. So, that's okay.

Wait, but perhaps I should also check the maximum stress when the column is at its critical load. Because sometimes, the factor of safety is applied to the stress, not just the load.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the maximum stress the material can take, considering the factor of safety.

The elastic limit (yield strength) is 40,000 psi. So, the allowable stress would be 40,000 / 2.5 = 16,000 psi.

So, the stress in the column should not exceed 16,000 psi.

Stress σ = P/A = 15,000 / A ≤ 16,000.

So, A ≥ 15,000 / 16,000 = 0.9375 in².

So, the cross-sectional area A must be at least 0.9375 in².

But A = 3t². So,

3t² ≥ 0.9375 → t² ≥ 0.3125 → t ≥ sqrt(0.3125) ≈ 0.559 inches.

But wait, earlier calculation gave t ≈ 0.6 inches, which is above 0.559. So that's okay.

But perhaps I should use this method to see if any of the options meet this area requirement.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 1.8 x 0.6 → A = 1.8 * 0.6 = 1.08 in² → which is above 0.9375, so acceptable.

Option F: 2 x 0.6 → A=1.2 in² → also acceptable.

Option G: 2 x 0.7 → A=1.4 in².

Option H: 1.75 x 0.65 → A=1.125 in².

Option C: 2.25 x 0.8 → A=1.8 in².

Wait, but perhaps I should approach it using both methods to see which gives a more accurate result.

Wait, but the first method using Euler's formula gives us t=0.6, so option B. But the second method (stress-based) gives a minimum area of 0.9375 in², which is met by several options, including B, F, G, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem might require using both the critical load and the stress condition. Because sometimes, the column could fail due to yielding before it reaches the critical load, so we need to ensure that the stress is within the allowable limit.

Wait, let me compute the critical load using Euler's formula and compare it to the applied load.

Using Euler's formula:

Pcr = (π² * E * I) / L²

I = t^4 /4.

So,

Pcr = (π² * 30e6 * t^4 /4 ) / (16)^2
= (π² * 30e6 * t^4 ) / (4 * 256)
= (π² * 30e6 * t^4 ) / 1024

We have Pcr, and the applied load is P =15,000 lbs. But since we're using a factor of safety, the allowable load is Pcr / n, so:

P_allow = Pcr / n = (π² * 30e6 * t^4 ) / (n * 1024)

We set P_allow = 15,000.

So,

15,000 = (π² * 30e6 * t^4 ) / (2.5 * 1024)

Compute denominator: 2.5 * 1024 = 2560.

So,

15,000 = (π² * 30e6 * t^4 ) / 2560

Multiply both sides by 2560:

38,400,000 = π² * 30e6 * t^4

Which brings us back to the same equation as before. So, t ≈ 0.6 inches.

So, the stress in this case would be σ =15,000 / (3*(0.6)^2) =15,000 / (3*0.36) =15,000 /1.08 ≈13,888 psi, which is well below the allowable 16,000 psi.

So, the dimensions from Euler's method give us a stress that's within the allowable limit.

But I'm a bit confused because the stress-based method gives a lower required area, but the Euler method gives a specific t. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use Euler's formula since it's a pin-ended column and we're dealing with critical load.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B: 1.8 in. x 0.6 in.
</think>

To determine the dimensions of the steel column, we use Euler's formula for the critical load:

\[
P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 30 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \)
- \( L = 16 \, \text{in} \)
- \( n = 2.5 \) (factor of safety)
- \( P = 15,000 \, \text{lbs} \)
- Breadth \( b = 3t \) (where \( t \) is thickness)

The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular section is:

\[
I = \frac{b t^3}{12} = \frac{3t \cdot t^3}{12} = \frac{t^4}{4}
\]

Substituting into the formula for allowable load:

\[
P_{allow} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{n L^2} = \frac{\pi^2 \cdot 30 \times 10^6 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4}}{2.5 \cdot 16^2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
15,000 = \frac{\pi^2 \cdot 30 \times 10^6 \cdot t^4}{2560}
\]

\[
t^4 = \frac{38,400,000}{\pi^2 \cdot 30 \times 10^6} \approx 0.12966
\]

\[
t \approx \sqrt[4]{0.12966} \approx 0.6 \, \text{in}
\]

Thus, the breadth \( b = 3t = 1.8 \, \text{in} \).

The dimensions are \( 1.8 \, \text{in} \times 0.6 \, \text{in} \), corresponding to **Option B**.
