Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Epicurus thought about death. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I remember that Epicurus had some specific ideas about the nature of the universe and the self. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that Epicurus was a Greek philosopher, and he was part of the Hellenistic period. He founded a school of philosophy called Epicureanism. From what I recall, Epicurus focused a lot on happiness and living a life of moderation. He believed that the purpose of life was to attain eudaimonia, which is often translated as happiness or flourishing.

Now, about death. Epicurus had some pretty unique views, especially regarding the soul and the afterlife. I remember that he was a materialist, meaning he believed that everything is made up of atoms and void. So, the soul isn't something separate; it's part of the physical world. If that's the case, then what happens to the soul after death?

Epicurus taught that the soul was made of finer particles than the body, but it was still material. When the body dies, the atoms disperse, right? So, the soul wouldn't survive death because it's just another collection of atoms. That means death is the end of consciousness and sensation.

Wait, but some people might confuse this with other philosophers. For example, Stoicism also deals with death, but I think they had a different take. The Stoics were more about accepting the natural order and not fearing death, but they didn't necessarily say it's the end of everything. Epicurus, on the other hand, was more about the absence of sensation after death.

So, looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: the greatest harm. That sounds more like a view from someone who fears death, but Epicurus didn't think it was a harm because you don't experience it. So A is probably not right.

Option B: an illusion. I don't think Epicurus said death is an illusion. He was more about the physical reality of it.

Option C: transformation into a higher being. That sounds more like a religious or Platonic idea, not Epicurean.

Option D: part of the cycle of rebirth. Reincarnation isn't something Epicurus talked about; he didn't believe in an afterlife, so D is out.

Option E: state of eternal suffering. No, he didn't think death was something you'd suffer eternally because he believed it's the end.

Option F: ultimate bliss. Again, that's more like a positive afterlife, which he didn't believe in.

Option G: deprivation of all sensation. Oh, that makes sense. Since death ends the soul, which is made of atoms, there's no sensation anymore. So G seems right.

Option H: final stage of life's journey. Maybe, but the question is about what death is, not the journey.

Option I: beginning of the afterlife. No, because he didn't believe in an afterlife.

Option J: necessary for enlightenment. I don't think so; Epicurus focused on the here and now, not on enlightenment through death.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be G: the deprivation of all sensation.

Epicurus, a Hellenistic philosopher, viewed death as the end of life where the soul, composed of finer atoms, disperses upon the body's death. This results in the cessation of all sensation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: the deprivation of all sensation.
