Question:

The police received an anonymous tip informing them that a pharmacist was engaged in the illegal manufacture of synthetic cocaine. As part of its investigation, the police placed an electronic tracking device on the pharmacist's car. The tracking device was attached to the underbody of the pharmacist's car while it was parked outside his home. The police did not secure a warrant before installing the device. By means of the tracking device, the police were able to trail the pharmacist's movements. The police followed the pharmacist every day for almost a month. Finally, one day the police tracked the pharmacist's car to a vacant warehouse on the outskirts of town. While the pharmacist was inside the building, the police peered in the window and saw drug paraphernalia and equipment used in the manufacture of synthetic cocaine. Based on these observations, the police secured a search warrant and gained entry into the building. Once inside, the police arrested the pharmacist and confiscated a large quantity of synthetic cocaine that had just been produced. At his trial for illegal possession and manufacture of a controlled dangerous substance, the pharmacist moves to suppress the cocaine confiscated by the police. The pharmacist's motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police acted in good faith when placing the tracking device.
B: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to track the pharmacist's movements.
C: granted, because the pharmacist had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his car.
D: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to place the tracking device on the pharmacist's car.
E: denied, because the police could have discovered the location of the warehouse simply by following the pharmacist's car.
F: denied, because the evidence would have inevitably been discovered.
G: denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.
H: granted, because the police invaded the pharmacist's privacy by peering into the warehouse window.
I: granted, because the information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.
J: granted, because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure and the Fourth Amendment, which deals with unreasonable searches and seizures. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that the police received an anonymous tip about a pharmacist making synthetic cocaine. They placed a tracking device on his car without a warrant. They tracked him for almost a month, eventually finding him at a warehouse. They saw drug paraphernalia through the window and got a search warrant. The pharmacist is trying to suppress the evidence, so the issue is whether the evidence should be excluded because it was obtained illegally.

I remember that the Fourth Amendment generally requires a warrant for searches and seizures, but there are exceptions. Also, anything obtained through an illegal search is considered "fruit of the poisonous tree" and can be suppressed unless an exception applies.

First, I need to consider whether placing the tracking device on the car was a search or seizure. The Supreme Court has ruled on cases like United States v. Jones, where they said attaching a GPS to a car is a search because it involves a physical invasion of the property. So, placing the device without a warrant would likely be illegal.

But wait, in some cases, the government's actions might not require a warrant. For example, if the tracking device is placed in a public place, maybe the expectation of privacy is lower. But in this case, the car was parked outside his home, so it's on private property, I think. So attaching the device without a warrant would be a search.

If the tracking was illegal, then the information obtained from it might be suppressible. But the police used that information to get a search warrant. So the question is whether the evidence obtained under the warrant is tainted by the initial illegality.

The "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine says that evidence obtained through an illegal search is inadmissible. But there are exceptions, like the independent source rule or if the police would have inevitably discovered the evidence without the illegal search.

In this case, the police tracked the pharmacist for a month, leading them to the warehouse. They then saw paraphernalia through the window. So the question is whether the information about the warehouse location was obtained through the illegal tracking.

If the tracking was illegal, then the police's knowledge of the warehouse location might be tainted. However, if they would have found the warehouse through other means, maybe the evidence isn't suppressed. But the problem is that the tracking was the main way they found the warehouse. The police couldn't have known where to go without the tracking device.

Alternatively, maybe the use of the tracking device without a warrant is the issue. The police didn't have a warrant, so the tracking was illegal. That makes the subsequent observations (seeing the paraphernalia) potentially tainted.

But wait, once they arrived at the warehouse, they observed the paraphernalia through the window. Was that observation a separate search? Observing through a window where someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy might be a search. But if the window was visible from a public area, maybe not. The question says they "peered in the window," which suggests it's not a public space, so that might be an invasion of privacy, making the observation an illegal search.

But the main issue is the tracking device. So the initial tracking was without a warrant, which was a search. The information from the tracking led them to the warehouse, and then they saw the paraphernalia, which was used to get the search warrant.

If the tracking was illegal, then the information about the warehouse location was obtained illegally, and the evidence from the warehouse might be suppressed because it's the fruit of that illegal search.

Looking at the options:

A: Denied because police acted in good faith. Good faith is more about whether the warrant was valid, but here there was no warrant. So A might not be the right reason.

B: Denied because of reasonable suspicion. But the issue is whether they needed a warrant, not just reasonable suspicion. So B might not be correct.

C: Granted because of privacy in the car. As per Jones, placing the device is a search. So C could be correct, but the issue is whether the tracking was illegal, making the subsequent evidence suppressible.

D: Granted because no warrant was obtained. That's exactly what happened. They attached the device without a warrant, so D seems correct.

E: Denied because they could have found the warehouse by following the car. But without the tracking, they wouldn't have known where he went each day. So E doesn't seem correct.

F: Denied because it would have inevitably been discovered. The inevitable discovery exception requires that the evidence would have been found by lawful means. Here, the police likely wouldn't have known about the warehouse without the tracking, so F might not apply.

G: Denied because under 30 days. The duration isn't the issue here; it's the lack of a warrant. So G is probably incorrect.

H:Granted because they peered into the window. That might be an invasion of privacy, but the main issue is the tracking device. So H is correct but only if the window peering is considered a search. But the question is about the tracking leading to the observations.

I:Granted because the search warrant was based on illegal info. If the tracking was illegal, then the info from it tainted the warrant. So I is a possibility.

J:Granted as fruit of an illegal search. This seems to fit because the initial tracking was illegal, making the later evidence inadmissible.

Wait, but the question is about the motion to suppress the cocaine. The cocaine was found after a search warrant. If the tracking was illegal, then the information about the warehouse was obtained illegally, which was used to get the warrant. So the warrant itself might be based on tainted information, making the search under it illegal. Hence, the evidence would be suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.

So looking at the options, D says granted because no warrant for the tracking device. That's correct in that the tracking was illegal. But the question is whether the evidence should be suppressed because the initial search was illegal, leading to the warrant.

I think the correct answer is I or J, because the search warrant was based on information obtained illegally. Alternatively, D is about the initial tracking, but the issue is whether the tracking's illegality affects the subsequent warrant.

Wait, the Fourth Amendment violation occurs at the time of the tracking. The police used that information to get the warrant, which might make the warrant itself invalid because it's based on illegal info. So the search under the warrant would be tainted, leading to the evidence being suppressed. That would be option I or J.

Option J says granted as the fruit of an illegal search. The illegal search was the tracking, so the evidence from the warehouse is the fruit of that. So J would be correct.

Alternatively, option I says the warrant was based on illegally obtained info. So I is also correct.

Wait, but the initial tracking was a search. The information from the tracking led them to the warehouse, where they observed the paraphernalia. The warrant was based on that observation, not directly on the tracking data. So the question is whether the observation was tainted by the tracking.

If the police wouldn't have known about the warehouse without the tracking, then the observation would be the fruit of the illegal search. So the warrant application was based on info obtained through an illegal search, making the warrant invalid, and thus the evidence should be suppressed.

So the correct answer would be I: granted because the information for the warrant was illegally obtained.

Wait, but the observations at the warehouse were made by the police after arriving there. If they arrived there because of the tracking, which was illegal, then the observations might be considered tainted. Alternatively, if the observations were made in public (like through the window where they had a right to be), then maybe the observations are okay.

But the question states that the police "peered in the window." If the window was in a private area, that might be an invasion of privacy, but if they were in a public space, it's not. The scenario doesn't specify, but I think the key point is the tracking device's illegality.

So the main issue is whether the tracking was illegal. Since it was, the information about the warehouse's location was obtained illegally, which led to the warrant. Therefore, the warrant was based on tainted information, making the search under it illegal. Hence, the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options, I and J both relate to this. I says the warrant info was illegally obtained. J says the evidence is fruit of an illegal search.

I think J is broader because the initial search (tracking) was illegal, and the evidence is its fruit. So J would be the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the evidence obtained by the police should be suppressed due to an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment. The police placed a tracking device on the pharmacist's car without a warrant, which was determined to be a search. This illegal search provided the information leading to the discovery of the warehouse, where the police observed paraphernalia and obtained a search warrant. The key issue is whether the evidence obtained from the warehouse is tainted by the initial illegal tracking.

The tracking device's placement without a warrant was an illegal search under *United States v. Jones*. This illegality taints the information used to locate the warehouse, which in turn affects the validity of the search warrant. The evidence obtained from the warehouse is considered the "fruit of the poisonous tree," making it inadmissible unless an exception applies. Since the police would not have discovered the warehouse without the illegal tracking, the inevitable discovery exception does not apply.

The correct answer is **J**, as the evidence is the fruit of an illegal search, and thus the motion to suppress should be granted.
