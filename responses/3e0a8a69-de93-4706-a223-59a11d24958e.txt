Question:

The Business Education Department of Edison High School bought 24 new typewriters at a cost of $350 each. Assuming that the estimated life of the typewriters is four years, after which they are expected to have a disposal value of $75 each, (a) what is the annual depreciation for each typewriter, using the straight-line method (depreciation)? (b) The monthly depreciation for each? (c) The annual rate of depreciation for each during the first year? (d) The book value of each at the end of the third year?

Okay, so I need to solve this problem about depreciation for typewriters. Let me read the question again carefully.

The Business Education Department bought 24 typewriters at $350 each. The estimated life is four years, and each has a disposal value of $75 after four years. There are four parts to the question: (a) annual depreciation per typewriter, (b) monthly depreciation, (c) annual depreciation rate for the first year, and (d) book value at the end of the third year.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on depreciation methods, but I think I can figure this out. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with part (a), the annual depreciation using the straight-line method. Straight-line depreciation is calculated by taking the cost minus the salvage value, then dividing by the useful life. So for each typewriter, the cost is $350, and the salvage value is $75 after four years.

So, the depreciable amount per typewriter is $350 - $75 = $275. Then, divide that by 4 years to get the annual depreciation. Let me calculate that: $275 divided by 4 equals... 275 รท 4 is 68.75. So the annual depreciation per typewriter is $68.75. 

Looking at the options, let's see which option has $68.75 for part (a). Option D says $68.75 for (a). Option E is $62.50, which is less, so that's not it. Option C is $72.50, which is higher. So I think D is a candidate.

Moving on to part (b), the monthly depreciation. Since the annual is $68.75, I can divide that by 12 to get the monthly amount. Let's compute 68.75 รท 12. Hmm, 12 times 5 is 60, leaving 8.75. 8.75 รท 12 is approximately 0.729. So adding up, each month is roughly $5.73. Let me check the options for part (b). Option D's part (b) is $5.73, which matches my calculation.

Now part (c), the annual rate of depreciation for the first year. The depreciation rate is usually calculated based on the initial cost. The rate would be (annual depreciation / original cost) * 100. So $68.75 / $350 * 100. Let me compute that: 68.75 รท 350 equals approximately 0.1964, which is about 19.64%. Looking at the options, option D's part (c) is 19.6%, which is close enough. 

Finally, part (d), the book value at the end of the third year. Book value is calculated as original cost minus accumulated depreciation. Accumulated depreciation after three years is annual depreciation multiplied by 3. So 68.75 * 3 = $206.25. Subtracting that from $350 gives 350 - 206.25 = $143.75. So the book value is $143.75. Checking the options, option D's part (d) is $143.75, which matches.

Let me just cross-verify with the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Option E has a lower depreciation rate, but our calculations are higher, so D seems correct. Other options like C have higher values, but our figures align with D's numbers.

The correct answer is D: $68.75, $5.73, 19.6%, $143.75.
