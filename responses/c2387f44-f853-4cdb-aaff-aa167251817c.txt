Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about sound waves. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the maximum displacement of a sinusoidal sound wave given some parameters. I remember that sound waves involve pressure variations and displacement, so I think I need to relate these two somehow.

Alright, the problem states that the maximum pressure variations are about 3.0 × 10^-2 Pascals above and below atmospheric pressure. The frequency is 1000 Hz. We're in air at normal conditions, so the speed of sound is 344 m/s, and the bulk modulus is 1.42 × 10^5 Pa. The answer needs to be in units of 10^-8 meters, I guess, because the options are all numbers followed by 10^-8.

Wait, the question says, "the corresponding maximum displacement if the frequency is 1000 Hz." So I need to find the maximum displacement (s), which I think is related to the pressure variation (ΔP). I remember there's a formula that connects these.

I think the formula for the maximum displacement (s_max) in a sound wave is s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ)^(1/2), where β is the bulk modulus and ρ is the density of air. Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it written as s_max = (ΔP) / (k * ρ), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the wave equation.

Another approach: The speed of sound (v) in a medium is given by v = sqrt(β / ρ), right? So β is the bulk modulus, which is given as 1.42e5 Pa. I need to find the density (ρ) of air. Oh wait, the problem says it's at normal atmospheric pressure and density. I think the standard density of air is about 1.2 kg/m³. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure ρ is 1.2 kg/m³.

So, the speed of sound is given as 344 m/s. Let me check if that matches with β and ρ. Let's compute sqrt(β/ρ) to see if it gives 344. So β is 1.42e5 and ρ is 1.2.

Calculating beta over rho: 1.42e5 / 1.2 ≈ 118333.333... Then sqrt(118333.33) is approximately sqrt(118333) ≈ 344 m/s. Yes, that matches. So that's correct.

Now, back to the displacement. I think the formula for maximum displacement s_max is related to the pressure variation. The formula I recall is s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ)^(1/2), but wait, that would be ΔP divided by the speed of sound, because v = sqrt(β/ρ), so sqrt(β/ρ) is v. So s_max = ΔP / v. Is that right?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Maybe I should think in terms of wave properties. The pressure variation ΔP is related to the displacement s. For a sinusoidal wave, the pressure variation is proportional to the derivative of the displacement with respect to time, multiplied by some factors. But perhaps a simpler approach is to use the relation between pressure amplitude and displacement amplitude.

I think the formula is ΔP = (β/ρ) * (ds/dt). But that's for the time derivative of displacement, which relates to velocity. Alternatively, maybe I should use the equation of motion for sound waves. Another approach: the intensity or the relation between pressure and displacement.

Wait, another way: the maximum displacement s_max can be found using the formula s_max = (ΔP) * (1/(k * ρ)), where k is the wave number. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ)^(1/2) * something. Alternatively, perhaps s_max = (ΔP) / (ρ * v^2). No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should look up the formula or derive it.

Wait, I remember that the maximum displacement is given by s_max = (ΔP) / (ω * ρ * c), where ω is the angular frequency and c is the speed of sound. Let me check: ω is 2πf, so ω = 2π * 1000 = 2000π rad/s.

So putting that into the formula, s_max would be (ΔP) / (ω * ρ * c). Let's plug in the numbers. ΔP is 3.0e-2 Pa. ω is 2000π, ρ is 1.2 kg/m³, c is 344 m/s.

So s_max = (3.0e-2) / (2000π * 1.2 * 344). Let me compute the denominator first. 2000 * π ≈ 6283.185. Then 6283.185 * 1.2 ≈ 7539.822. Then 7539.822 * 344 ≈ let's see, 7539 * 344 ≈ 7500 * 344 = 2,580,000, plus 39*344≈13,416, so total≈2,593,416. So denominator is approximately 2.593e6.

So s_max ≈ 3e-2 / 2.593e6 ≈ 1.156e-8 meters. That's 1.156 × 10^-8 m. Looking at the options, option I is 0.8, J is 1.2, so 1.2 would be close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: The formula for s_max is (ΔP) / (ρ * v^2). Let me check that. So with ΔP = 3e-2 Pa, ρ=1.2 kg/m³, v=344 m/s. So v squared is 344^2 ≈ 118,336 m²/s².

So s_max would be 3e-2 / (1.2 * 118336) = 3e-2 / (141999.2) ≈ 2.113e-8 meters, which is about 2.11e-8 m. That would be 2.11 × 10^-8 m, so 2.11 in the options would be 2.1, which isn't one of the options. Hmm. The options have E as 2.0, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ). Because β = bulk modulus, which is equal to ρ * v^2. So beta / rho is v squared. So, then s_max would be ΔP / (v^2). Wait, that would be 3e-2 / (344)^2 = 3e-2 / (118,336) ≈ 2.538e-7 m, which is 2.538e-7 m, which is 25.38e-8 m, but none of the options are around 25. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait another approach: The maximum displacement can be found using the formula s_max = (ΔP) / (ρ * c^2). Let me compute that. So 3e-2 Pa divided by (1.2 kg/m³ * (344)^2). 344^2 is 118,336, so 1.2 * 118336 ≈ 141,999.2. So 3e-2 / 141,999.2 ≈ 2.113e-7 m, which is 2.113 × 10^-7 m, or 21.13 × 10^-8 m. That's 21.13e-8 m, which is way higher than the options given, which are all single digits. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (k * ρ * c), where k is the wave number. The wave number k is 2πf / c. So k = (2π * 1000) / 344 ≈ 6283.19 / 344 ≈ 18.26 m^-1.

So then s_max = ΔP / (k * ρ * c) = (3e-2) / (18.26 * 1.2 * 344). Let's compute the denominator: 18.26 * 1.2 ≈ 21.912, then 21.912 * 344 ≈ 7534. So denominator is about 7534. So s_max ≈ 3e-2 / 7534 ≈ 3.98e-6 m, which is 39.8e-7 m, or 3.98e-6 m, which is 3.98 ×10^-6 m, which is 39.8 × 10^-8 m. So that would be approximately 3.98 ×10^-8 m, which is 3.98e-8 m. Looking at the options, H is 3.0, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, maybe I should recheck the formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Another approach: The maximum displacement s_max is related to the maximum pressure ΔP by the equation ΔP = -β * (ds/dt). But that's for the time derivative. Integrating that, I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the displacement to the pressure using the equation of motion.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes: The displacement amplitude s_max is given by s_max = (ΔP) / (ω^2 * ρ), where ω is the angular frequency. Let's try that. ω is 2πf = 2000π ≈ 6283.19 rad/s.

So s_max = (3e-2) / ( (6283.19)^2 * 1.2 ). First, compute (6283.19)^2: approx 6283^2 = (6.283e3)^2 ≈ 39,478,000 (since 6.283^2 ≈ 39.478, so 39.478e6). So 39.478e6 * 1.2 ≈ 47.374e6. So s_max ≈ 3e-2 / 47.374e6 ≈ 6.33e-11 m, which is 6.33 ×10^-11 m. That's way too small and not matching any options. So this formula must be wrong.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the relation between pressure and displacement in a sound wave. I remember that for a sinusoidal wave, the pressure variation ΔP is proportional to the derivative of displacement with respect to time, multiplied by the bulk modulus and other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ)^(1/2) * something. Wait, I think I'm confusing this with another formula. Maybe it's better to approach this using the wave equation.

The wave equation relates the pressure and displacement. The equation is ΔP = -β * (d²s/dx²), but that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum displacement can be found using the amplitude of the wave.

Another approach: The intensity of the wave can be expressed in terms of displacement amplitude. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, I think I've found the correct formula now. The maximum displacement (s_max) is given by s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ)^(1/2) * (1/(2πf)). Wait, why would that be? Because the maximum displacement relates to the pressure variation divided by the speed of sound and multiplied by the wavelength over 2π. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another idea: The maximum displacement can be found using the formula s_max = (ΔP) / (ρ * (v)^2). Let me try that again. v is 344 m/s, ρ is 1.2 kg/m³. So v squared is 344^2 = 118,336 m²/s². So 1.2 * 118,336 = 141,999.2. So ΔP is 3e-2 Pa. So s_max = 3e-2 / 141,999.2 ≈ 2.113e-7 m, which is 2.113 ×10^-7 m, or 21.13 ×10^-8 m. But the options are up to about 5.4, so that can't be right. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β) * (something). Since β is 1.42e5 Pa.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall that the maximum displacement s_max is related to the amplitude of the wave. The amplitude of the wave (s_max) can be found from the pressure variation using s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ) * (1/(2πf)). Wait, not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. The pressure variation in a sound wave is related to the rate of change of displacement. The formula is ΔP = -β * (d²s/dt²). But for a sinusoidal wave, s = s_max * sin(kx - ωt), so the second derivative with respect to time is -ω² s_max sin(kx - ωt). So, ΔP = β ω² s_max sin(kx - ωt). The maximum value of ΔP is β ω² s_max. So, setting ΔP_max = β ω² s_max.

So, solving for s_max, we get s_max = ΔP_max / (β ω²). That makes sense. Let me compute that.

ΔP_max is 3.0e-2 Pa. β is 1.42e5 Pa. ω is 2πf = 2000π rad/s. So ω squared is (2000π)^2 = 4e6 * π² ≈ 4e6 * 9.8696 ≈ 3.94784e7 rad²/s².

So s_max = (3e-2) / (1.42e5 * 3.94784e7). Let me compute the denominator first: 1.42e5 * 3.94784e7 ≈ (1.42 * 3.94784) * 1e12 ≈ 5.6216 * 1e12 ≈ 5.6216e12.

So s_max ≈ 3e-2 / 5.6216e12 ≈ 5.337e-15 m. Wait, that's way too small. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, no, let me check the formula again. From the wave equation, ΔP = -β (d²s/dt²). For a sinusoidal wave, s = s_max sin(kx - ωt), so d²s/dt² = -ω² s_max sin(kx - ωt). So ΔP = β ω² s_max sin(kx - ωt). Therefore, the maximum pressure variation is ΔP_max = β ω² s_max. So s_max = ΔP_max / (β ω²).

Hmm, but plugging in the numbers gives s_max ≈ 5.337e-15 m, which is 5.337e-15 m, which is 0.5337e-14 m. That's way too small and not matching any options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute the denominator: 1.42e5 Pa multiplied by (2000π)^2. Let me compute (2000π)^2 again. 2000 is 2e3, so squared is 4e6. π squared is about 9.8696. So 4e6 * 9.8696 is 3.94784e7. So 1.42e5 * 3.94784e7 = 1.42e5 * 3.94784e7.

Let me compute 1.42 * 3.94784 ≈ 5.6216. So 5.6216e5+7 = 5.6216e12. So denominator is 5.6216e12. So 3e-2 divided by 5.6216e12 is approximately 5.337e-15 m. That's correct, but way too small. So perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β * ω²), but maybe I missed a factor of (1/ω) somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β * ω²) * something else.

Wait, maybe another approach: The maximum displacement can be found using the relation between the intensity and the displacement. The intensity I is (1/2) ρ ω² s_max². But I'm not sure if that helps because I don't have the intensity here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the pressure to the particle velocity. The particle velocity v_p is given by v_p = ω s_max. The pressure variation is related to the time derivative of the particle velocity. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another formula I found: The maximum displacement s_max is given by s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ)^(1/2) * (1/(ω)). Because β/ρ is v squared, so sqrt(β/ρ) is v. So s_max = (ΔP) / (v * ω).

Wait, let's try that. So s_max = (3e-2 Pa) / (344 m/s * 2000π rad/s).

Compute denominator: 344 * 2000π ≈ 344 * 6283.19 ≈ let's see, 344 *6000=2,064,000, 344*283.19≈344*280=96,320 plus 344*3.19≈1,094. So total ≈ 2,064,000 + 96,320 = 2,160,320 + 1,094 ≈ 2,161,414. So denominator ≈ 2.1614e6.

So s_max ≈ 3e-2 / 2.1614e6 ≈ 1.387e-8 m, which is 1.387 ×10^-8 m. So that's approximately 1.39e-8 m. Looking at the options, J is 1.2 and E is 2.0. Hmm, 1.39 is closer to 1.4, which isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should use s_max = (ΔP) / (β * ω²). Let me try that again. So ΔP = 3e-2 Pa, β=1.42e5 Pa, ω=2000π=6283.19 rad/s.

So ω squared is (6283.19)^2 ≈ 3.9478e7 rad²/s².

So s_max = 3e-2 / (1.42e5 * 3.9478e7) = 3e-2 / (5.6216e12) ≈5.337e-15 m, which is way too small. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try to find another way. I think I've heard that the maximum displacement can be found using s_max = (ΔP) / (ρ v^2). Let me try that.

So, ΔP is 3e-2 Pa. ρ is 1.2 kg/m³. v is 344 m/s.

So s_max = 3e-2 / (1.2 * 344^2). Compute denominator: 344^2 = 118,336. 1.2 * 118,336 = 141,999.2.

So s_max = 3e-2 / 141,999.2 ≈ 2.113e-7 m, which is 2.113 ×10^-7 m, or 21.13 ×10^-8 m. But none of the options are close to 21. So perhaps this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β) * (1/(2πf)). Let me try that.

So, β is 1.42e5 Pa, f is 1000 Hz.

So 1/(2πf) = 1/(6283.19) ≈ 1.5915e-4 s.

So s_max = (3e-2) / (1.42e5) * 1.5915e-4.

Compute denominator: 1.42e5 * 1.5915e-4 ≈ 1.42e5 * 1.5915e-4 = (1.42 * 1.5915) * 1e1 ≈ 2.257 *10 = 22.57.

So s_max ≈ 3e-2 / 22.57 ≈ 1.33e-3 m, which is 1.33e-3 m = 1.33e-3 m, which is 1.33e-3 m = 13.3e-4 m, which is 13.3e-4 m. That's 1.33e-3 m, which is 1.33 ×10^-3 m, or 1330e-6 m, which is way bigger than the options. So this must be wrong.

I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the wave equation again. The wave equation is:

ΔP = -β ∇² s

But for a sinusoidal wave in one dimension, ∇² s = d²s/dx² = -(k^2) s, where k is the wave number. So ΔP = β k² s. But for maximum displacement, s_max, the maximum ΔP is ΔP_max = β k² s_max.

So solving for s_max gives s_max = ΔP_max / (β k²). Now, k is 2πf / v. So k = 2π *1000 /344 ≈ 18.26 m^-1.

So k squared is (18.26)^2 ≈ 333.3 m^-2.

So s_max = 3e-2 Pa / (1.42e5 Pa * 333.3 m^-2) = 3e-2 / (4.733e7) ≈ 6.34e-10 m, which is way too small, 6.34e-10 m. Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let's re-express it. From the wave equation, for a sinusoidal wave, s(x,t) = s_max sin(kx - ωt). Then, the pressure variation is ΔP = -β (d²s/dt²) = -β (-ω² s_max sin(kx - ωt)) = β ω² s_max sin(kx - ωt). So the maximum pressure variation is ΔP_max = β ω² s_max. So s_max = ΔP_max / (β ω²).

But when I plug the numbers in, I get s_max ≈ 5.337e-15 m, which is way too small. So I must be missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formulas. Let me try to find another way. Another approach: The peak displacement s_max can be found using the formula s_max = (ΔP) / (ρ v^2). Let's try that again.

So, ΔP = 3e-2 Pa, ρ=1.2 kg/m³, v=344 m/s.

So s_max = 3e-2 / (1.2 * (344)^2) = 3e-2 / (1.2 * 118,336) = 3e-2 / (141,999.2) ≈ 2.113e-7 m, which is 2.113e-7 m, or 21.13e-8 m. The options don't have anything near that, so perhaps this is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β * v). Let me compute that. β=1.42e5 Pa, v=344 m/s.

So s_max = 3e-2 / (1.42e5 * 344) = 3e-2 / (4.8928e7) ≈ 6.14e-10 m, which is 6.14e-10 m, which is 0.614e-9 m. Again, not matching any options.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the units. The displacement is in meters, and the options are given in 1e-8 meters. So, for example, option J is 1.2, which would be 1.2e-8 m.

Let me think about the formula for s_max again. Another possible formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (ρ * (v * ω)). So let's try that. ω is 2πf = 2000π rad/s.

So s_max = 3e-2 / (1.2 * 344 * 2000π). Compute denominator: 1.2 * 344 ≈ 412.8, then 412.8 * 2000 ≈ 825,600, then 825,600 * π ≈ 2,592,600. So denominator ≈ 2.5926e6.

So s_max ≈ 3e-2 / 2.5926e6 ≈ 1.157e-8 m, which is approximately 1.16e-8 m. So that's about 1.16 ×10^-8 m, which would correspond to option J:1.2.

Wait, that seems to match one of the options. So maybe that's the correct approach. So the formula s_max = ΔP / (ρ v ω) gives me approximately 1.16e-8 m, which rounds to 1.2e-8 m, so option J.

But I need to make sure that this formula is correct. Let me think again. The formula I used is s_max = ΔP / (ρ v ω). Where does this come from?

Well, considering that the pressure variation ΔP is related to the time derivative of displacement. The particle velocity is v_p = ω s_max. The acceleration is a = dv_p/dt = -ω² s_max. The pressure variation ΔP is given by ΔP = -β a, so ΔP = β ω² s_max. So s_max = ΔP / (β ω²). But earlier, this gave a very small value, which didn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the wave's energy or other properties. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (2 β ω). Let me try that.

So s_max = 3e-2 / (2 * 1.42e5 * 2000π). Compute denominator: 2 *1.42e5=2.84e5. 2.84e5 * 2000π≈2.84e5 *6283.19≈1.786e9. So s_max ≈3e-2 / 1.786e9≈1.68e-11 m, which is way too small.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different formula. Another approach: Using the relationship between the sound intensity and the displacement. The intensity I is given by I = (1/2) ρ ω² s_max². But without knowing the intensity, this might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula again. From my notes, the maximum displacement s_max can be found using s_max = (ΔP) / (β / ρ) * (1/(2πf)). Because β/ρ is v^2, so v = sqrt(β/ρ). Then, 1/(2πf) is the period T. So s_max = (ΔP) / (v^2) * T. Let me compute that.

T is 1/f = 0.001 seconds. v is 344 m/s.

So v squared is 344^2 = 118,336 m²/s².

So s_max = (3e-2) / 118,336 * 0.001 ≈ (3e-2) / (118,336 * 0.001) ≈3e-2 / 118.336 ≈2.538e-4 m, which is 2.538e-4 m, which is 253.8e-6 m, or 2.538e-4 m. That's 2.538 ×10^-4 m, which is 25.38 ×10^-5 m. That's way larger than the options given, which are in 10^-8 m. So this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (β * f). Let me compute that. β is 1.42e5 Pa, f is 1000 Hz.

So s_max = 3e-2 / (1.42e5 * 1000) =3e-2 / 1.42e8 ≈2.112e-10 m, which is 2.112e-10 m, which is 0.2112 ×10^-8 m. That's 0.21e-8 m, which is close to option I (0.8), but not quite. So perhaps this is wrong.

I'm really confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the formula is s_max = (ΔP) / (2πρ v f). Let's compute that.

So, s_max = 3e-2 / (2π *1.2 *344 *1000). Compute denominator: 2π ≈6.283, 1.2 *344=412.8, 412.8 *1000=412,800. So 6.283 *412,800 ≈2,593,706.4.

So s_max ≈3e-2 / 2.5937e6 ≈1.156e-8 m, which is approximately 1.16e-8 m. That's close to option J:1.2. So this seems promising.

But where did this formula come from? Let me think. I think it's derived from the wave equation considering the displacement amplitude in terms of pressure and other parameters. So perhaps the correct formula is s_max = ΔP / (2π ρ v f).

Alternatively, perhaps it's s_max = (ΔP) / (β * 2π f). Let me check that. β=1.42e5, f=1e3.

So denominator is 1.42e5 *2π *1e3 ≈1.42e5 *6.283e3 ≈8.913e8.

So s_max ≈3e-2 /8.913e8 ≈3.366e-11 m, which is way too small.

Hmm, but earlier when I used s_max = (ΔP)/(ρ v ω), I got approximately 1.16e-8 m, which is option J:1.2. So perhaps that's the correct approach.

Wait, let me recheck that formula. s_max = (ΔP) / (ρ v ω). So ΔP=3e-2, ρ=1.2, v=344, ω=2000π.

So denominator: 1.2 *344 *2000π ≈1.2 *344 =412.8; 412.8 *2000=825,600; 825,600 * π≈2,593,000. So denominator≈2.593e6.

So s_max ≈3e-2 /2.593e6 ≈1.157e-8 m. So that would be approximately 1.16e-8 m, which is 1.16×10^-8 m. So the option closest would be J:1.2.

So I think the correct answer is J:1.2.

To determine the maximum displacement \( s_{\text{max}} \) of a sinusoidal sound wave given the maximum pressure variation \( \Delta P \), frequency \( f \), speed of sound \( v \), and bulk modulus \( \beta \), we use the relationship:

\[
s_{\text{max}} = \frac{\Delta P}{\rho v \omega}
\]

where \( \omega = 2\pi f \) is the angular frequency, and \( \rho \) is the density of air (assumed to be \( 1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)).

### Given:
- \( \Delta P = 3.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{Pa} \)
- \( f = 1000 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( v = 344 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( \rho = 1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
- \( \beta = 1.42 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \)
- \( \omega = 2\pi f = 2000\pi \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( \omega \):
   \[
   \omega = 2000\pi \approx 6283.19 \, \text{rad/s}
   \]

2. Compute the denominator \( \rho v \omega \):
   \[
   \rho v \omega = 1.2 \times 344 \times 6283.19 \approx 2.593 \times 10^6
   \]

3. Compute \( s_{\text{max}} \):
   \[
   s_{\text{max}} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{-2}}{2.593 \times 10^6} \approx 1.157 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}
   \]

4. Convert to the given unit \( 10^{-8} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   s_{\text{max}} \approx 1.16 \, 10^{-8} \, \text{m}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The maximum displacement corresponds to approximately \( 1.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} \), which matches **Option J**.
