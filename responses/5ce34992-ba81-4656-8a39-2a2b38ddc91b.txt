Question:

A plaintiff sued a department store for injuries she sustained when she slipped and fell in the store. At trial, the plaintiff proposes to testify that, when the store manager rushed to the scene, he said to the plaintiff, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects. How should the court rule on the admissibility of the store manager's testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is inadmissible, because it is considered a hearsay exception for statements of personal or family history.
B: The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.
C: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party.
E: The testimony is admissible in its entirety, because it is considered a party admission.
F: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.
G: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as a res gestae statement.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it violates the rule against hearsay, with no applicable exceptions.
I: The testimony about the water is inadmissible, but the statement about paying for the ambulance and hospital bill is admissible as an admission of guilt.
J: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about hearsay exceptions, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a plaintiff sued a department store after slipping and falling. At trial, she wants to testify about what the store manager said when he came to the scene. The manager said, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry—the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects, and the question is about the admissibility of this testimony.

Hmm, so I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. If the statement isn't an exception, it's inadmissible. So here, the manager is the opposing party's agent, right? Because the store is the defendant, and the manager acts on their behalf. 

I think there's an exception for admissions against interest. Specifically, a statement by a party's agent or employee concerning a matter within their authority, made during the employment relationship. So the manager's statement would be an admission of the party-opponent, which falls under the hearsay exception at FRE 801(d)(2).

Wait, but I also recall that offers to pay medical expenses are sometimes treated differently. Like, if someone offers to pay for your medical bills, that can be an admission of liability, but it's not always clear. I think in some cases, those statements are considered offers of compromise and are inadmissible unless certain conditions are met.

Looking at the statement, the manager says two things: first, apologizing about the water on the floor, and second, offering to pay for the ambulance and hospital bill. The first part about the water seems like an admission of negligence—admitting that water was there, which caused the fall. The second part is an offer to pay medical expenses.

I remember that under the Federal Rules, an offer to pay medical expenses is admissible as an exception if it's made by the opposing party. It's an admission against interest because it's a statement acknowledging liability. So both parts might be admissible as party admissions.

Wait, but some sources say that offers to pay medical expenses are not admissible unless they are made by the party against whom it's offered and concern the liability for the injury. Oh, but in this case, the manager is speaking on behalf of the store, so it counts as a party admission.

Alternatively, I think there's a rule that an offer to pay medical expenses is inadmissible if it's made by the tortfeasor to the injured person. But that might be under the old common law; under the Federal Rules, it's more about whether it's an admission. So perhaps both parts are admissible.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The first part, "I'm sorry about the water on the floor," is a statement by the manager, an agent, about the condition of the store. That's clearly an admission against the store's interest, so it's admissible under 801(d)(2)(D), which includes statements by a party's agent concerning a matter within their authority.

The second part is an offer to pay the bills. I think this is also an admission because it's a statement by the store's agent, acknowledging that the store is responsible. So it's not just an offer of payment but an admission of liability. Therefore, both parts should be admissible as party admissions.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes offers to pay are considered offers of compromise and thus inadmissible. But under the Federal Rules, an offer to pay medical expenses is an exception. Specifically, under 409, an offer to compromise is inadmissible, but that applies when the offer is made to settle a claim. So if the manager is making an offer to pay as part of a settlement discussion, then it's inadmissible. But if it's a statement offered to prove liability, it might be admissible as an admission.

Alternatively, under 801(d)(2)(C), a statement is admissible if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent concerning a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed. So both statements fit that.

Therefore, the entire testimony should be admissible because both parts are party admissions. So looking at the options:

Option D says the testimony is admissible in its entirety as a statement of an opposing party. Option E says it's admissible as a party admission. Option B says the part about the water is admissible, but the rest isn't. But I think both are admissible.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the offer to pay. Let me check. Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. So the manager's offer to pay the bills is within his authority, so it's an admission.

Therefore, the entire testimony should be admissible. So looking at the options, option D says "the testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party." Alternatively, option E says it's admissible as a party admission, but E says "because it is considered a party admission," which is correct, but E is more specific.

Wait, the options are:

D: Admissible in its entirety as a statement of an opposing party.

E: Admissible in its entirety because it's a party admission.

So both D and E seem correct, but I think E is more precise because it's specifically about party admissions. But looking back, the question is whether the testimony is admissible in its entirety.

Wait, but the manager's statement about paying for the hospital bill might be an offer to pay, which under some rules could be inadmissible. Let me think again.

Under the Federal Rules, an offer to pay medical expenses is admissible as a party admission, because it's a statement by the opposing party's agent concerning liability. So the statement is admissible under 801(d)(2).

Therefore, the entire testimony is admissible. So the correct answer is either D or E. D says it's a statement of the opposing party, while E says it's a party admission.

I think E is more accurate because it's specifically a party admission, which is a subset of opposing party statements. So the correct answer should be E.

The testimony is admissible in its entirety as a party admission.
