<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about oxygen diffusing through nitrogen and then a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Hmm, I remember that diffusion rates can be calculated using Fick's Law. Let me think through this step by step.

First, for part (I), it's a straightforward Fick's Law application. The formula is J = (-D * dxP/dx) / (1 + (Z_A/Z_B)*y_A), but since nitrogen is non-diffusing, Z_A/Z_B is the ratio of molar masses. Wait, oxygen is A and nitrogen is B. The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol and N2 is 28 g/mol. So Z_A/Z_B is 32/28 ≈ 1.1429.

The partial pressures are 13500 and 6000 N/m², which is a drop of 7500 N/m² over a distance of 2.2 mm. Wait, 2.2 mm is 0.0022 meters. So the gradient dxP/dx is (6000 - 13500) / 0.0022. Let me calculate that: ( -7500 ) / 0.0022 ≈ -3,409,091 N/m² per meter. But since we take the absolute value for the rate, it's about 3.409e6 N/m² per meter.

Now, plugging into Fick's Law: J = (D * |dxP/dx|) / (1 + (Z_A/Z_B)y_A). Wait, what's y_A here? Since y_A is the mole fraction of A in the mixture. But in part (I), the non-diffusing gas is pure N2, so y_A would be the mole fraction of O2 in the mixture. Wait, no: wait, in Fick's Law, when the non-diffusing gas is B, the formula is J = (D * |ΔP|) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A)), where x is the distance between the two points. Wait, or is it J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A))? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_A))).

Wait, another approach: Fick's first law is J = -D * (dC/dx) where C is concentration. But concentration can be expressed in terms of partial pressure. Alternatively, using the form J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_A))).

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_A)), where y_A is the mole fraction of A in the mixture. But in part (I), the non-diffusing gas is pure N2, so the mixture is just O2 and N2. Wait, but in that case, the total pressure is 1e5 N/m², and the partial pressure of O2 is given. Let me see: the partial pressure of O2 is 13500 N/m² at one point and 6000 at another. But wait, the total pressure is 1e5 N/m², so the mole fraction of O2 at each point is y_A = P_A / P_total.

Wait, but if the non-diffusing gas is N2, then its mole fraction is y_B = (P_total - P_A)/P_total. But in this case, the total pressure is fixed, so the mole fraction of O2 is y_A = P_A / P_total. But I'm not sure if that's the case because the partial pressure varies along the path. Hmm, maybe I should consider the average y_A.

Alternatively, perhaps in the steady state, the concentration gradient is determined by the partial pressures, and the formula simplifies. Let me think again.

The formula for the diffusion flux J (in kmol/m²·sec) is given by J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_avg)), where y_avg is the average mole fraction of A in the medium. Since the problem doesn't specify varying y, perhaps it's the average of the two y values.

Wait, but in the first part, the non-diffusing gas is pure N2, so the mixture is only O2 and N2. So at each point, the mole fraction y_A = P_A / P_total. So at the first point, y_A = 13500 / 1e5 = 0.135, and at the second point, y_A = 6000 / 1e5 = 0.06. So the average y_A is (0.135 + 0.06)/2 = 0.0975.

Now, Z_A/Z_B = 32/28 ≈ 1.1429. So 1 + (1.1429)(0.0975) ≈ 1 + 0.1115 ≈ 1.1115.

Now, D is given as 1.81e-5 m²/sec. The distance x is 0.0022 m. The pressure difference ΔP is 13500 - 6000 = 7500 N/m².

So putting it all into J: J = (1.81e-5 m²/s) * (7500 N/m²) / (0.0022 m * 1.1115).

Wait, but wait: the units for J. The result will be in (m²/s) * (N/m²) / (m * unitless) = (N·m²)/(m²·s·m) ) → simplifying units.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the units. Let me double-check: D is m²/s, ΔP is N/m², x is m, and the denominator is unitless. So J would be (m²/s) * (N/m²) / (m * unitless) ) = (N·m²)/(m²·s·m) ) → simplifying, N/(s·m). But we need to convert this to kmol/(m²·sec).

Wait, perhaps I should convert the pressure difference into concentration terms. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula in terms of partial pressures and the other variables.

Wait, another approach: the formula for J is J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_A)), and the result is in kmol/m²·sec.

So let's compute step by step:

ΔP = 7500 N/m²

x = 0.0022 m

D = 1.81e-5 m²/s

Z_A/Z_B = 32/28 ≈ 1.1429

Average y_A: (0.135 + 0.06)/2 = 0.0975

So denominator term: 1 + (1.1429)(0.0975) ≈ 1 + 0.1115 ≈ 1.1115

Now, J = (1.81e-5) * 7500 / (0.0022 * 1.1115)

Compute numerator: 1.81e-5 * 7500 = 1.81e-5 * 7.5e3 = 1.81 * 7.5e-2 = 0.13575

Denominator: 0.0022 * 1.1115 ≈ 0.0024453

So J = 0.13575 / 0.0024453 ≈ 55.48 (units? Let me check: 1.81e-5 m²/s * N/m² → (m²/s)(N/m²) )= (N·m²)/(m²·s) )= N/(s). Wait, but we need kmol/(m²·s). Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor.

Wait, maybe I should consider that 1 kmol is 1000 mol, and using the ideal gas law, P = RT(n/V), so n/V = P/(RT). So perhaps the flux J is in terms of kmol/m²·sec.

Wait, maybe I should express the pressure in terms of concentration. Let me think: the concentration c_A is P_A/(RT), where R is the gas constant in appropriate units. But since we're dealing with partial pressures and the same temperature, perhaps the ratio can be simplified.

Wait, maybe the formula I'm using already accounts for this, so perhaps I need to multiply by (1/(R T)) or something. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for J in terms of partial pressures is J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A)) * (1/(R T)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh right, Fick's first law in terms of partial pressures for gases is given by J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A)), and the result is in kmol/(m²·sec) when using the right units.

Wait, let me check the units again. D is m²/s, (P1-P2) is N/m², x is m. So (m²/s) * (N/m²) = (N·m²)/(m²·s) )= N/(s). Then dividing by x (m) gives N/(m·s). Hmm, that doesn't seem right for kmol/(m²·s). I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have an additional factor to convert pressure to concentration. Let me think: The concentration c_A = P_A/(R T). So the flux J would be in terms of concentration per time, so J = -D * dc_A/dx. So dc_A/dx = (1/(R T)) * dP_A/dx. So J = (D/(R T)) * dP_A/dx.

Wait, so perhaps the correct formula is J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * R T) / (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A).

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, and I just need to proceed with the calculation and see which option matches.

Let me proceed with the numbers:

J = (1.81e-5 m²/s * 7500 N/m²) / (0.0022 m * 1.1115) ≈ (0.13575) / 0.0024453 ≈ 55.48.

Wait, but 55.48 what? It must be in kmol/m²·sec. Wait, perhaps I need to convert N/(m·s) to kmol/(m²·s). Let me think.

1 N = 1 kg·m/s². So N/(m·s) = kg/(m²·s). But how does that relate to kmol?

Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT → n/V = P/(RT). So perhaps the flux J is in mol/(m²·s), and then multiplied by 1e-3 to get kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, let me try this approach. The flux in mol/(m²·s) is J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A)) * (1/(R T)).

Given that R is 8314 J/(kmol·K) [since 8.314 J/mol·K * 1e3 = 8314 J/kmol·K], and T is 0°C = 273.15 K.

So R*T = 8314 * 273.15 ≈ let's calculate that: 8314 * 273 ≈ 8314 * 270 = 2,244,780, plus 8314*3=24,942 → total ≈ 2,269,722 J/kmol.

Wait, but J is in m²/s, pressure in N/m², so let me compute everything step by step.

Compute J in mol/(m²·s):

J = (D * (P1-P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A) * R T)

Plugging in the numbers:

D = 1.81e-5 m²/s

ΔP =7500 N/m²

x=0.0022 m

1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_avg = 1.1115

R=8314 J/(kmol·K)

T=273.15 K

So,

J = (1.81e-5 * 7500) / (0.0022 * 1.1115 * 8314 * 273.15)

First compute numerator: 1.81e-5 *7500 = 0.13575

Denominator: 0.0022 * 1.1115 ≈ 0.0024453

Multiply by R*T: 0.0024453 * 8314 * 273.15

Wait, 8314 * 273.15 ≈ let's compute 8314 * 273 = 8314*(200+73) = 8314*200=1,662,800; 8314*73= 605,  8314*70=582,  8314*3=24,942 → so 582,  8314*73= 8314*(70+3) = 581,980 + 24,942 = 606,922. So total R*T ≈ 1,662,800 + 606,922 = 2,269,722 J/kmol.

So denominator becomes 0.0024453 * 2,269,722 ≈ let's compute:

0.0024453 * 2,269,722 ≈ approximately 5,548. (Let me compute 2,269,722 * 0.0024453 ≈ 2,269,722 * 0.002 = 4,539.444; 2,269,722 * 0.0004453 ≈ approx 1016. So total ≈ 4,539 + 1,016 ≈ 5,555.)

So J ≈ 0.13575 / 5,555 ≈ 2.446e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, that's approximately 2.45e-5 kmol/(m²·sec). Looking at the options, option A is 2.40e-5 and 2.45e-5 for part I and II. So part I would be around 2.45e-5, but wait, the options are I and II, so part I is the first number. Hmm, but let me check my calculation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recalculate the denominator:

0.0022 m * 1.1115 = 0.0022 * 1.1115 ≈ 0.0024453.

Then, 0.0024453 m * 8314 J/(kmol·K) * 273.15 K.

Wait, no, it's 0.0024453 * 8314 * 273.15.

Compute 8314 * 273.15 ≈ 2,269,722 J/kmol as before.

Then 0.0024453 * 2,269,722 ≈ 5,548 (as before).

So J ≈ 0.13575 / 5,548 ≈ 2.446e-5 kmol/m²·s.

So part (I) would be approximately 2.45e-5 kmol/(m²·sec). Looking at the options, option A is (2.40e-5, 2.45e-5), option C is (2.50e-5, 2.55e-5), etc.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the non-diffusing gas is N2, the effective diffusivity is adjusted by the mole fraction.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the diffusion rate when the non-diffusing gas is B is J = (D_AB * (P_A1 - P_A2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A)) ), where D_AB is the given diffusivity.

So using D_AB = 1.81e-5 m²/s, and y_A is the average mole fraction.

Wait, but perhaps y_A is (P_A1 + P_A2)/(2 * P_total). Let me compute that: (13500 + 6000)/(2*1e5) = 19500/(2e5) = 0.0975. So same as before.

So J = (1.81e-5 * 7500) / (0.0022 * (1 + 1.1429*0.0975)) → same as before, so J ≈ 2.45e-5.

But looking at the options, option A's first value is 2.40e-5, which is close but a bit lower. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute denominator:

0.0022 * 1.1115 = 0.0024453.

Then, 0.0024453 * R*T = 0.0024453 * 8314 * 273.15.

Compute R*T: 8314 * 273.15 ≈ 8314 * 273 = 2,269,722 plus 8314*0.15 = 1,247.1 → total ≈ 2,270,969.1 J/kmol.

So 0.0024453 * 2,270,969.1 ≈ let's compute:

0.0024453 * 2,270,969.1 ≈ 2,270,969.1 * 0.002 = 4,541.9382

Plus 2,270,969.1 * 0.0004453 ≈ approx 1,015.2.

Total ≈ 4,541.9382 + 1,015.2 ≈ 5,557.138.

So J = 0.13575 / 5,557.138 ≈ 2.444e-5 kmol/m²·s.

So approximately 2.44e-5, which is close to 2.45e-5. Looking at the options, option A's first part is 2.40e-5, which is a bit lower, but perhaps I made a mistake in the average y_A.

Wait, perhaps I should not take the average y_A but use y_A at one point. Let me see: if I take y_A at the point where P_A is 13500, y_A = 0.135, then 1 + 1.1429*0.135 ≈ 1 + 0.1543 ≈ 1.1543.

So denominator term would be 1.1543.

Then J = (1.81e-5 * 7500) / (0.0022 * 1.1543 * 8314 * 273.15).

Wait, but this would give a different result. Let me compute this:

Denominator: 0.0022 * 1.1543 ≈ 0.00243946.

Multiply by R*T (2,270,969.1): 0.00243946 * 2,270,969.1 ≈ 5,539.7.

So J = 0.13575 / 5,539.7 ≈ 2.449e-5 ≈ 2.45e-5.

Same result. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 2.45e-5 for part (I), which would match option A's second part as 2.45e-5, but wait, the options list part (I) as the first number and part (II) as the second. So if part (I) is 2.45e-5, then looking at the options, option A's first number is 2.40e-5, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach without considering the average y_A. Maybe the formula doesn't require averaging y_A but uses it as a constant. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the initial y_A.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the mole fraction of the non-diffusing gas, which is y_B = (P_total - P_A)/P_total. So at each point, y_B = (1e5 - P_A)/1e5.

Wait, but in the formula, it's (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) y_A). So perhaps I should calculate y_A at each point and integrate, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that y_A is constant along the path, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the variation in y_A and use the average value, which we did. So proceeding with J ≈ 2.45e-5 kmol/m²·sec.

Looking at the options, option A has 2.40e-5 and 2.45e-5. So part (I) would be 2.45e-5, which is option A's second value, but the first part is 2.40e-5. That doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_B)), where y_B is the mole fraction of the non-diffusing gas. Wait, that would be different. Let me think.

Wait, the formula is J = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_A)). Because y_A is the mole fraction of A in the mixture. So I think I was correct earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. Let me think about the units of J:

D is m²/s.

(P1-P2) is N/m².

x is m.

So (m²/s) * (N/m²) = (N·m²)/(m²·s) )= N/(s·m).

But we need kmol/(m²·s). So perhaps I need to convert N/(s·m) to kmol/(m²·s) using the ideal gas law.

We know that P = nRT → n/V = P/(RT). So 1 N/m² = (1/(R T)) * (mol/m³).

Wait, perhaps 1 N = 1 kg·m/s², and R is in J/(kmol·K) = (kg·m²)/(s²·kmol·K).

So perhaps the conversion factor is (1/(R T)) in kmol/(m²·N).

Let me compute 1/(R T): R = 8314 J/(kmol·K), T=273.15 K.

1/(8314 * 273.15) ≈ 1/(2,270,969) ≈ 4.404e-7 kmol/(N·m²).

So J in kmol/(m²·s) would be (N/(s·m)) * 4.404e-7 kmol/(N·m²).

Wait, let me compute:

J (kmol/m²·s) = (N/(s·m)) * (4.404e-7 kmol/(N·m²)) )

= (4.404e-7 kmol) / (m²·s).

So let's compute J:

From earlier, J in N/(m·s) was 55.48.

So J = 55.48 * 4.404e-7 ≈ 2.445e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Which matches our earlier calculation of approximately 2.45e-5.

So part (I) is 2.45e-5 kmol/m²·s.

Looking at the options, the first part of option A is 2.40e-5, but option C's first part is 2.50e-5, which is higher. Hmm, but none of the options have 2.45e-5 as the first part. Wait, option A's first part is 2.40e-5, and the second is 2.45e-5. So perhaps part (I) is 2.45e-5, which would correspond to option A's second value. But the question is part (I) and (II), so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the non-diffusing gas is a mixture, the effective diffusivity changes.

Wait, part (II) is when the non-diffusing gas is a mixture of N2 and CO2 in a 2:1 volume ratio. So the mole fractions would be y_B = 2/3 and y_C = 1/3. But how does this affect the formula?

In part (II), the non-diffusing gas is a mixture of N2 and CO2. So the effective diffusivity would be calculated based on the mixture's properties.

Wait, the formula for the diffusion rate when the non-diffusing gas is a mixture is more complex. The general formula is J = (D_AB * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/(Z_B + Z_C)) (y_B + y_C)))).

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula J = (D_AB * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_avg) y_A)), where Z_avg is the average molar mass of the non-diffusing gas.

Wait, the non-diffusing gas is a mixture of N2 and CO2 in a 2:1 volume ratio. So their mole fractions are y_N2 = 2/3 and y_CO2 = 1/3.

The average molar mass Z_avg = (y_N2 * Z_N2 + y_CO2 * Z_CO2) = (2/3 * 28 + 1/3 * 44) g/mol.

Calculating: (2/3 *28) = 18.6667, (1/3 *44)=14.6667 → total Z_avg = 33.333 g/mol = 0.033333 kmol/kg.

Wait, but wait, molar mass is in g/mol, so Z_avg = 33.333 g/mol.

Now, Z_A is 32 g/mol, Z_avg = 33.333 g/mol.

So Z_A/Z_avg = 32/33.333 ≈ 0.96.

Now, the formula becomes J = (D_AB * (P1 - P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_avg) * y_A)).

Here, D_AB is given as 1.81e-5 m²/s, but wait, the problem states that D_O2-N2 is 1.81e-5, and D_O2-CO2 is 1.85e-5. But when the non-diffusing gas is a mixture, the effective diffusivity D_AB' is a weighted average based on the volume ratios.

Wait, perhaps the effective diffusivity D in a mixture of B and C is D_AB = (y_B D_AB_N2 + y_CO2 D_AB_CO2).

Since the non-diffusing gas is a mixture of N2 and CO2 in a 2:1 ratio by volume, their mole fractions are y_B = 2/3, y_C = 1/3.

So D_AB' = y_B * D_AB_N2 + y_C * D_AB_CO2 = (2/3)*1.81e-5 + (1/3)*1.85e-5.

Calculating: (2/3)*1.81e-5 ≈ 1.2067e-5, (1/3)*1.85e-5 ≈ 6.1667e-6. Sum ≈ 1.2067e-5 + 6.1667e-6 ≈ 1.8233e-5 m²/s.

Now, using this D_AB' = 1.8233e-5 m²/s.

Then, Z_A/Z_avg = 32/33.333 ≈ 0.96.

Now, y_A is the mole fraction of O2 in the mixture, which is the same as in part (I), since the total pressure is the same and the partial pressures of O2 haven't changed. Wait, no, the partial pressures are the same as in part (I), so y_A is still the average of 0.135 and 0.06, which is 0.0975.

So 1 + (0.96)*(0.0975) ≈ 1 + 0.0936 ≈ 1.0936.

Now, J = (1.8233e-5 * 7500) / (0.0022 * 1.0936 * R * T).

Wait, but again, perhaps I should compute it as:

J = (D_AB' * (P1-P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_avg) * y_A)) ) * (1/(R T)).

But I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the same approach as part (I), using the new D_AB' and the new Z_avg.

So J = (1.8233e-5 * 7500) / (0.0022 * 1.0936 * 8314 * 273.15).

Compute numerator: 1.8233e-5 *7500 = 0.1367475.

Denominator: 0.0022 * 1.0936 ≈ 0.00240592.

Multiply by R*T ≈ 2,270,969.1.

So denominator total: 0.00240592 * 2,270,969.1 ≈ 5,462.4.

So J ≈ 0.1367475 / 5,462.4 ≈ 2.503e-5 kmol/m²·s.

So part (II) is approximately 2.50e-5.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 2.50e-5 and 2.55e-5.

So part (I) would be 2.45e-5 and part (II) 2.50e-5. But looking at the options, option C's first value is 2.50e-5, which doesn't match part (I). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating D_AB'. Let me recalculate D_AB':

D_AB' = (2/3)*1.81e-5 + (1/3)*1.85e-5 = (1.81e-5 * 2 + 1.85e-5) / 3 = (3.62e-5 + 1.85e-5)/3 = 5.47e-5 /3 ≈ 1.8233e-5. That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the harmonic mean or another method for the diffusivity in a mixture. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for D_AB' is not a simple average but involves the volume fractions differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula for effective diffusivity when the non-diffusing gas is a mixture is D_AB' = (y_B D_AB_N2 + y_C D_AC_CO2) / (y_B + y_C). But in this case, since it's a binary mixture, and the non-diffusing gas is a mixture, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D_AB' = (D_AB_N2 * D_AB_CO2)^(1/2), but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the diffusion coefficient in a mixture of non-diffusing gases. The effective diffusivity for A in a mixture of B and C can be given by:

1/D_AB' = (y_B / D_AB_N2) + (y_C / D_AB_CO2).

So,

1/D_AB' = (2/3)/1.81e-5 + (1/3)/1.85e-5.

Compute each term:

(2/3)/1.81e-5 ≈ 0.6667 / 1.81e-5 ≈ 3.683e4.

(1/3)/1.85e-5 ≈ 0.3333 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 1.799e4.

Sum: 3.683e4 + 1.799e4 ≈ 5.482e4.

So D_AB' = 1/(5.482e4) ≈ 1.824e-5 m²/s.

Which is very close to the earlier calculation of 1.8233e-5. So that seems correct.

So part (II) J ≈ 2.503e-5 kmol/m²·s.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: 2.50e-5 and 2.55e-5.

So part (I) is 2.45e-5, which isn't listed as the first value in any option. The closest option is A, where part (I) is 2.40e-5 and part (II) is 2.45e-5. But that would only fit if part (I) were 2.40e-5 and part (II) 2.45e-5, but our calculations show part (II) as 2.50e-5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (I). Let me recheck part (I):

In part (I), the non-diffusing gas is pure N2, so Z_avg = 28 g/mol.

So Z_A/Z_avg = 32/28 ≈ 1.1429.

Average y_A = 0.0975.

So denominator term: 1 + 1.1429 * 0.0975 ≈ 1 + 0.1115 ≈ 1.1115.

So J = (1.81e-5 * 7500) / (0.0022 * 1.1115 * R*T).

Compute denominator: 0.0022 * 1.1115 = 0.0024453.

Multiply by R*T ≈ 2,270,969.1 → 0.0024453 * 2,270,969.1 ≈ 5,550.

So J = (1.81e-5 *7500) / (5,550) = (0.13575) / 5,550 ≈ 2.446e-5 kmol/m²·s.

So part (I) is approximately 2.45e-5.

Looking at the options, the only option where part (I) is close to 2.45e-5 is option A, but its first value is 2.40e-5 and the second is 2.45e-5. But part (I) is the first value in the option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the (1 + (Z_A/Z_B)y_A) term, leading to J = D*(P1-P2)/(x*R*T).

Let me compute that:

J = (1.81e-5 *7500) / (0.0022 * 8314 * 273.15).

Denominator: 0.0022 *8314 *273.15 ≈ 0.0022 * 2,270,969 ≈ 5,000.

So J ≈ (1.81e-5 *7500) /5,000 = (0.13575)/5,000 ≈ 2.715e-5 kmol/m²·s.

But that's not matching any options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the non-diffusing gas is pure N2, the formula simplifies to J = (D * (P1-P2)) / (x * R T).

So J = (1.81e-5 * 7500) / (0.0022 * 8314 * 273.15).

Compute denominator: 0.0022 *8314 ≈ 18.2908. 18.2908 *273.15 ≈ 5,000.

So J ≈ (1.81e-5 *7500) /5,000 ≈ (0.13575)/5,000 ≈ 2.715e-5.

But that's option F's first value, 2.70e-5. But I'm not sure if this approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should stick with my initial approach, which gave part (I) as 2.45e-5 and part (II) as 2.50e-5. Since option C has 2.50e-5 as the first value and 2.55e-5 as the second, but that doesn't match our calculation for part (I). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for part (I) without averaging y_A. Let me use y_A = 0.135 at the first point.

Then, denominator term: 1 + (32/28)*0.135 ≈ 1 + 1.1429*0.135 ≈ 1 + 0.1543 ≈ 1.1543.

So denominator: 0.0022 *1.1543 ≈ 0.002439.

Multiply by R*T ≈ 2,270,969 → 0.002439 *2,270,969 ≈ 5,539.

So J = (1.81e-5 *7500) /5,539 ≈ 0.13575 /5,539 ≈ 2.449e-5 kmol/m²·s.

Same as before. So part (I) is 2.45e-5, which isn't directly listed as the first value in any option. The closest is option A, which has 2.40e-5 and 2.45e-5, but that would mean part (I) is 2.40e-5 and part (II) is 2.45e-5, which doesn't align with our part (II) calculation of 2.50e-5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (II). Let me recalculate part (II):

D_AB' =1.8233e-5 m²/s.

Z_A/Z_avg =32/33.333≈0.96.

y_A=0.0975.

Denominator term:1 +0.96 *0.0975≈1+0.0936=1.0936.

So J = (1.8233e-5 *7500)/(0.0022 *1.0936 * R*T).

Compute denominator:0.0022 *1.0936≈0.0024059.

Multiply by R*T≈2,270,969 → 0.0024059 *2,270,969≈5,462.

So J=(1.8233e-5 *7500)/5,462 ≈ (0.13675)/5,462 ≈2.503e-5 kmol/m²·s.

So part (II) is approximately 2.50e-5.

Looking at the options, option C is (2.50e-5, 2.55e-5), which matches part (II) but not part (I). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, where part (I) is 2.50e-5 and part (II) is 2.55e-5. But according to our calculations, part (I) is 2.45e-5 and part (II) is 2.50e-5. None of the options perfectly match, but option A's second value is 2.45e-5, which would fit part (I), and part (II) is 2.50e-5, which is option C's first value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of part (I). Let me try using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is J = (D * (P1-P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_A)).

But let me compute without considering R and T, perhaps using the flux formula in terms of molar concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula J = (D * (P1-P2)) / (x * (1 + (Z_A/Z_B) * y_A)).

But without considering R and T, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the flux in molar units without converting to kmol, so the result would be in mol/(m²·s), which would then be converted to kmol by dividing by 1e3.

Wait, but earlier calculations included R and T, so perhaps the initial approach was correct.

Given that, I think the correct answers are part (I) ≈2.45e-5 and part (II)≈2.50e-5, but none of the options exactly match. However, option A's second value is 2.45e-5, and option C's first is 2.50e-5. But the options list part (I) first, so perhaps the intended answer is option A, assuming part (I) is 2.40e-5 and part (II) is 2.45e-5. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in part (I).

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2.50e-5 and 2.55e-5. But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 2.40e-5 and 2.45e-5.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the closest option. Since part (I) is approximately 2.45e-5 and part (II) is 2.50e-5, the closest option is A for part (I) and C for part (II), but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option A, with part (I) as 2.40e-5 and part (II) as 2.45e-5.

But given the calculations, I think the correct answers are 2.45e-5 and 2.50e-5, which would correspond to option A's second value and option C's first value, but since the options are paired, perhaps the intended answer is option A.
</think>

At steady state conditions, the diffusion rate of oxygen (A) through nitrogen (B) and a mixture of nitrogen (B) and carbon dioxide (C) was calculated using Fick's Law. For part (I), where the non-diffusing gas is pure nitrogen, the diffusion rate was determined to be approximately **2.45 × 10⁻⁵ kmol/m²·sec**. For part (II), where the non-diffusing gas is a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in a 2:1 volume ratio, the diffusion rate was calculated to be approximately **2.50 × 10⁻⁵ kmol/m²·sec**.

Given the options provided, the closest match to the calculated values is **Option A**, where part (I) is **2.40 × 10⁻⁵ kmol/m²·sec** and part (II) is **2.45 × 10⁻⁵ kmol/m²·sec**. While the calculated values slightly differ, this option aligns most closely with the results.

**Answer: A**
