Question:

A 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation comes to the emergency department because of pain in his right thigh and shaking chills during the past 3 days. He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of "greenish fluid" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3 . In addition to beginning antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Application of a pressure bandage
B: Intravenous fluid resuscitation
C: Recommencement of lithium carbonate treatment
D: Transfer to a burn center
E: Thrombolytic therapy
F: Immediate surgical amputation
G: Physical therapy consultation
H: Psychiatric consultation
I: Topical silver sulfadiazine
J: Incision and drainage

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best next step for this patient. Let me go through the information step by step.

The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation. He came to the emergency department with pain in his right thigh and shaking chills for the past three days. He burned his thigh with a cigarette lighter six days ago. This morning, he soaked it in hot water and massaged it, which caused a lot of greenish fluid to drain. He used to take lithium carbonate but stopped three months ago after losing his job. His other medical history is unremarkable.

Vital signs: Temp is 39.2°C (102.5°F), which is high. Pulse is 170/min, which is really fast. Resps are 18/min, and BP is 120/60 mm Hg. On exam, his right thigh is edematous, with multiple burn sites that look white and have exudate. There's erythema around the burns and red streaks going up the thigh. Palpation shows fluctuance. Labs: Hgb 14 g/dL, which is normal, and leukocytes 19,000/mm³, which is high, indicating infection.

So, the main issue here is an infected burn. He has cellulitis with possible abscess formation because of the fluctuance and the greenish fluid draining. The fact that he stopped lithium is important because lithium can affect the skin's healing, but I'm not sure how relevant that is here. The key is the infection and the possibility of deeper tissue involvement.

The question is, what's the most appropriate next step after starting antibiotics? The options are A through J.

Looking at the options:

A: Pressure bandage. Usually used for burns to reduce edema, but if there's an infection with abscess, pressure might not be the next step. Maybe for burns, but not sure.

B: IV fluid resuscitation. His BP is 120/60, which is a bit low but not critically so. He's tachycardic, which could be from fever or infection. Without signs of shock, maybe not the first step, but could be considered if he's dehydrated.

C: Restart lithium. Probably not relevant here since the issue is infection, not his mental state or medication compliance.

D: Transfer to burn center. He has burns, but they're self-inflicted and not life-threatening. However, if the infection is severe and not responding, maybe. But the question is about the next step after antibiotics.

E: Thrombolytics. That's for clots, like pulmonary embolism or heart attacks. Doesn't seem relevant here.

F: Immediate amputation. That's a drastic step. Unless there's necrosis or gangrene, which isn't mentioned, this seems too extreme.

G: Physical therapy. Probably not needed immediately; the issue is infection, not mobility.

H: Psychiatric consult. He has a history of self-mutilation, but he's in the ER with a severe infection, so maybe after the infection is controlled.

I: Topical silver sulfadiazine. It's used for burns to prevent infection, but he already has an infection. It might help but isn't the immediate next step if IV antibiotics are started.

J: Incision and drainage. This seems likely because the fluctuance suggests an abscess. Cutting and draining the infected area would help in treating the infection.

So, the key points are that he has cellulitis and possible abscess. Antibiotics are started, but incision and drainage would be the next step to physically remove the infected fluid and reduce the pressure. Without that, the antibiotics might not be effective enough, and the infection could spread.

I think the answer is J: Incision and drainage.
</think>

The patient presents with a severe infection following self-inflicted burns, evidenced by high fever, tachycardia, erythema, red streaks, and fluctuance at the burn sites. The most appropriate next step after initiating antibiotic therapy is to perform incision and drainage to address the abscess and reduce infection spread. 

Answer: J
