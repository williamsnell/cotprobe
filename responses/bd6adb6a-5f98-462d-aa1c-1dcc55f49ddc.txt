Okay, so I've got this math problem here about seating guests at a wedding. There are 190 guests, and each circular table seats exactly 8 people. The question is asking for the least number of tables needed to seat everyone. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 20 up to 30. Hmm, let's think through this carefully.

First, I remember that when you need to find out how many groups you can make, you usually divide the total number by the group size. So in this case, I'd take the total guests, which is 190, and divide by the number of seats per table, which is 8. Let me do that calculation: 190 รท 8.

Let me work that out. 8 times 20 is 160, right? So 190 minus 160 is 30. Then, 8 times 3 is 24, so 30 minus 24 is 6. So 190 divided by 8 is 23.75. Wait, that's a decimal. But you can't have a fraction of a table, so you have to round up because even a partial table means you need another whole table.

So 23.75 tables, but since you can't have a quarter of a table, you round up to the next whole number, which would be 24. But wait, let me check because sometimes these problems might have a trick. Let me think again: 24 tables times 8 seats each would give 24*8=192 seats. But there are only 190 guests, so that's 2 extra seats. But is there a way to use fewer tables?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check 23 tables. 23*8=184. That's 184 seats, but we have 190 guests. 190-184=6 guests left. So 6 guests can't be seated because each table needs exactly 8. So we can't just have 23 tables because 6 guests would be left without a seat. Therefore, we need another table for those 6, making it 24 tables in total.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says each table seats exactly 8 people. So if I have 23 tables, that's 184 seats, but 190-184=6 guests. Since each table must have exactly 8, those 6 can't be seated at a table alone. So we'd need a 24th table to seat those 6, but that table would only have 6 people, which is less than 8. But the problem doesn't specify that each table must be full, just that each table seats exactly 8 people. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted that.

Wait, the wording says "each table seats exactly 8 people." That might mean that each table must have exactly 8 seated, not that each table can seat up to 8. So if that's the case, then we can't have a table with fewer than 8. So in that case, those remaining 6 can't be seated, so we need another table, making it 24 tables because each table needs to have exactly 8 people. But wait, 24 tables would seat 24*8=192, which is more than 190, but since each table must have exactly 8, you can't have a partial table. So, 24 is the answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, 24 is option G. But let me check the options again to be sure. The options are A:30, B:27, C:20, D:26, E:22, F:28, G:24, H:23, I:21, J:25.

Wait, H is 23, which I initially thought might not be enough because 23*8=184, which leaves 6 guests. Since each table must seat exactly 8, those 6 can't be seated, so we need another table, making it 24. Therefore, the correct answer should be G:24.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, they might allow tables to have fewer than the maximum, but each must have at least a certain number. But the problem says "exactly 8," so each table must have 8, no more, no less. Therefore, we can't have 23 tables because 23*8=184, leaving 6 guests who can't be seated. So we have to go to 24 tables, which can seat all 190 guests, with 2 seats left empty. So the minimal number is 24.

Wait, but wait another thing: 190 divided by 8 is 23.75. So that's 23 full tables and 0.75 of another. But since each table needs exactly 8, you can't have a fraction, so you have to round up to 24. So the answer is 24, which is option G.

To determine the least number of circular tables needed to seat all 190 guests, where each table seats exactly 8 people, we perform the division:

190 รท 8 = 23.75

Since we cannot have a fraction of a table and each table must seat exactly 8 people, we must round up to ensure all guests are seated. Therefore, 24 tables are required.

Answer: G
