Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which company holds an annual self-named 'Bake-Off'. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably think about what a 'Bake-Off' is. It's like a competition where people bake things, right? Companies that are known for baking products might host such events. I remember hearing about baking competitions, maybe ones that are sponsored by certain brands.

Looking at the options:

A: Duncan Hines – I know they make cake mixes and stuff. Maybe they have a bake-off? Not sure.

B: Pepperidge Farm – They do a lot of crackers and maybe some baked goods. Not sure about a bake-off.

C: General Mills – They own a lot of brands, like Betty Crocker. Wait, Betty Crocker is one of their products. I think Betty Crocker has a bake-off. Let me think more.

D: Sara Lee – They have a line of baking products, but I'm not sure about a bake-off.

E: Quaker Oats – They're more known for oatmeal and granola. Maybe not a bake-off.

F: Kellogg's – They have a lot of breakfast cereals, but I don't recall a bake-off.

G: Keebler – They make cookies and such, but again, not sure about a bake-off.

H: Pillsbury – Oh wait, Pillsbury has a famous bake-off! I think they've been doing it for years. It's called the Pillsbury Bake-Off. I remember seeing it on TV or hearing about it in the past. They host it annually, and people submit their recipes using Pillsbury products.

I: Nabisco – They make cookies like Oreo, but I don't think they have a bake-off.

J: Betty Crocker – As I thought earlier, Betty Crocker is a brand under General Mills, and they do have a bake-off. But isn't the Pillsbury one more well-known? Or maybe both have them? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the Pillsbury Bake-Off is the more famous one. Betty Crocker might have a similar event, but perhaps it's not as prominent. Let me think again. Pillsbury has definitely been hosting a bake-off for a long time, maybe since the 1940s or something. They have different categories each year where participants use Pillsbury products to create recipes.

So, considering all that, the correct answer should be H: Pillsbury. But let me double-check. Betty Crocker is a brand that General Mills owns, and they do have their own bake-off contests, but I'm not sure if it's as widely known as Pillsbury's. The question is about the company that holds an annual self-named 'Bake-Off'. So Pillsbury's is called the Pillsbury Bake-Off, and Betty Crocker's might be called the Betty Crocker Food Championship or something else. Therefore, Pillsbury is the one that holds the annual self-named event.

The company that holds an annual self-named 'Bake-Off' is Pillsbury, known for hosting the Pillsbury Bake-Off, a long-standing event where participants create recipes using Pillsbury products.

Answer: H
