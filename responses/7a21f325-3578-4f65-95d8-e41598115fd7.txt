Options:

A: a[i] < max || a[i] > max
B: a[i] == max
C: TRUE
D: FALSE
E: a[i] <= max

G: a[i] != max
H: a[i] >= max
I: !(max != a[i])
J: !(a[i] == max)

Okay, so I have this boolean expression to simplify: a[i] == max || !(max != a[i]). Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I know that boolean expressions can often be simplified using logical equivalences. Let me look at each part of the expression separately.

The first part is a[i] == max. That's straightforwardâ€”it checks if a[i] is equal to max.

The second part is a bit trickier: !(max != a[i]). So, that's the negation of (max != a[i]). Wait, if we have max not equal to a[i], and then we negate that, it becomes true when max is equal to a[i]. So, !(max != a[i]) is equivalent to (max == a[i]). Oh, right! Because if max isn't equal to a[i], then negating it would make it true only when they are equal.

So now, the entire expression is (a[i] == max) || (max == a[i]). Wait a minute, that's the same as saying (a[i] == max) OR (a[i] == max). Because both parts are the same condition. So, in boolean logic, when you have X || X, it's just X. Because if X is true, the whole thing is true, and if X is false, it's false.

So, simplifying that, the entire expression reduces to just (a[i] == max). Because both parts are the same, so ORing them doesn't change the outcome.

Now, looking at the options, option B is a[i] == max. That should be the simplified version.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. The original expression is a[i] == max OR not (max != a[i]). Another way to think about it is using De Morgan's laws. The negation of (max != a[i]) is (max == a[i]). So, the expression becomes (a[i] == max) OR (a[i] == max), which is just (a[i] == max). Yep, that makes sense.

So, the correct answer should be option B.

The boolean expression `a[i] == max || !(max != a[i])` can be simplified by recognizing that `!(max != a[i])` is equivalent to `a[i] == max`. Thus, the expression becomes `a[i] == max || a[i] == max`, which simplifies to `a[i] == max`.

Answer: B
