Okay, so I've got this question about generators and induced EMF. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that when a generator is driven at 1200 rpm, the generated EMF is 125 volts. Then there are two parts: part (a) asks what the EMF would be if the field flux is decreased by 10% while keeping the speed the same. Part (b) is about reducing the speed to 1100 rpm with the field flux unchanged.

I remember that the generated EMF (E) in a generator depends on a few factors. The formula I think is E = (P * φ * N) / 60, where P is the number of poles, φ is the flux per pole, and N is the speed in rpm. Wait, but sometimes it's written differently, maybe E = k * φ * N, where k is some constant based on the machine's construction. So I think the key here is that E is directly proportional to both the flux (φ) and the speed (N).

So for part (a), when the flux decreases by 10%, φ becomes 0.9φ. Since speed is the same, N remains 1200. So the new EMF would be 0.9 times the original EMF. The original E was 125 V, so 0.9 * 125 = 112.5 V. That seems straightforward.

For part (b), the speed decreases to 1100 rpm, so N is now 1100/1200 of the original, which is about 0.9167 times. The flux is unchanged, so the new EMF should be (1100/1200) * 125. Let me calculate that: 1100 divided by 1200 is 11/12, which is approximately 0.9167. Multiply that by 125: 125 * 11/12 = (125 * 11)/12. 125*11 is 1375, divided by 12 is approximately 114.5833 volts. Let me round that to two decimal places: 114.58 V, which is close to 114.6 V. Wait, but looking at the options, let me see what they have for part (b).

Looking at the options, option I is (a) 112.5, (b) 114.6. That fits what I calculated. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: (a) 112.5, (b) 125. No, part (b) would require a lower speed, so (b) should be lower than 125. So A is out.

Option B: (a) 113, (b) 116. Hmm, part (a) is 10% decrease, which should be exactly 125 *0.9=112.5, not 113. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: (a)100, which is way too low. No.

Option D: (a) 125, which doesn't make sense because flux decreased, so E should go down. So D is out.

Option E: (a)120, which is a 10% decrease? Let's see: 125 -12.5=112.5, so E's (a) is 120, which is a 4% decrease, not 10%. So E is incorrect.

Option F: (a)110, which is a bigger decrease than needed. 125-15=110, which would be a 12% drop, but we only decreased flux by 10%, so F's (a) is wrong.

Option G: (a) 118.75, which is 125 * 0.95, that's a 5% decrease, not 10%. So G is incorrect.

Option H: (a)115, which would be a 8% decrease (125-10=115), but we need 10%, so 125*0.9=112.5. So H's (a) is wrong.

Option I: As I thought earlier, (a) 112.5, (b) ~114.58, which matches my calculations. So I is a candidate.

Option J: (a)107.5, which is a 14% drop, too much. So J is out.

So the correct answer should be option I: (a) 112.5 volts, (b) approximately 114.6 volts.

The generated EMF in a generator is directly proportional to both the field flux (φ) and the speed (N). 

For part (a), decreasing the flux by 10% while keeping the speed constant results in the EMF being 0.9 times the original value:  
0.9 × 125 V = 112.5 V.

For part (b), reducing the speed to 1100 rpm (from 1200 rpm) while keeping the flux constant results in the EMF being (1100/1200) times the original value:  
(1100/1200) × 125 V ≈ 114.58 V, which rounds to 114.6 V.

The correct answer is option I: (a) 112.5 volts, (b) 114.6 volts.
