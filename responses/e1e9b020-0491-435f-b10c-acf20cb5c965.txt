Question:

The rational-economic model of decision-making is based on the assumption that:

Options:

A: decision-makers can predict the outcome of their decisions with 100% accuracy.
B: individuals are better than groups at making decisions, especially under stressful conditions.
C: decision-makers place more emphasis on the costs of certain decisions than on other consequences of their decisions.
D: decision-makers will always choose the alternative that yields the greatest personal benefit.
E: decision-makers are incapable of making rational decisions due to cognitive limitations.
F: decision-makersâ€™ knowledge about possible alternatives is always incomplete.
G: decision-makers prioritize the immediate benefits of a decision over its long-term consequences.
H: decision-makers often base their decisions on the opinions of others, rather than on a thorough analysis of the options.
I: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.
J: decision-makers are influenced by their emotions and personal biases when making decisions.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the rational-economic model of decision-making. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking what the rational-economic model is based on. The options are A through J. Let me recall what I know about this model. From what I remember, the rational model assumes that decision-makers have perfect rationality, meaning they make decisions that maximize their self-interest. They have complete information, perfect memory, and the ability to process all information without any cognitive limitations. So, in this model, people are seen as rational actors who aim to make the best possible decision for themselves.

Looking at the options:

Option A says decision-makers can predict outcomes with 100% accuracy. Well, I think the rational model does assume they have perfect information, which would include knowing all possible outcomes. So A seems related, but wait, the question is about the assumption of the model, which is that they're perfectly rational, including having complete info.

Option B suggests individuals are better than groups under stress. I'm not sure if this is part of the model. The model is more about individual decision-making as rational, not necessarily comparing groups versus individuals. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C talks about emphasizing costs over other consequences. Hmm, the model does involve cost-benefit analysis, but I don't think it's specifically about costs more than other consequences. It's about considering all consequences, so C might not be the best fit.

Option D says they choose the alternative with the greatest personal benefit. That sounds close. The rational model is about maximizing personal gain, so D could be a contender.

Option E claims decision-makers can't make rational decisions due to cognitive limits. Wait, the rational model assumes they can make perfectly rational decisions, so E is the opposite of what the model states. So E is incorrect.

Option F says their knowledge is always incomplete. No, because the rational model assumes complete information, so F is wrong.

Option G talks about prioritizing immediate benefits over long-term. That's more of a behavioral economics concept, like hyperbolic discounting, not the rational model. The rational model would consider all future consequences with perfect foresight, so G is not correct.

Option H suggests decisions are based on others' opinions rather than analysis. That's more about social or group decision-making, not the rational model which is individual and analytical. So H is out.

Option I states they have complete info about all alternatives. Yes, that's a key assumption of the rational model. So I is a strong contender.

Option J says emotions and biases influence decisions. The rational model assumes no biases or emotions; decisions are purely based on logical analysis. So J is incorrect.

Now, the question is about the assumption. The rational model assumes decision-makers have complete information (I) and choose the option with the greatest personal benefit (D). Wait, but I think the model's main assumption is that they have complete and perfect information, so they can evaluate all alternatives and pick the best one. So the primary assumption is about the information being complete, which is option I.

Wait, but another angle: the rational model's assumption is that people make decisions to maximize their utility, using all available information. So the core assumption is that they have complete information (I) and can process it perfectly, leading them to choose the best option (D). But the question is asking which is the assumption, so perhaps it's about the information aspect.

Wait, looking back, the options: D is about the choice, I is about the information. The question is about the model's assumption, so the key is that decision-makers have complete info (I) and can make optimal decisions.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the rational model is described as assuming perfect rationality, which includes complete info and the ability to process it. So the primary assumption is about having complete information. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the model is also called the 'rational expectations' model, where people are assumed to make decisions based on all available info, which aligns with I.

So I think the correct answer is I: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.

The rational-economic model of decision-making assumes that decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions. This aligns with the assumption of perfect rationality, where individuals are seen as rational actors aiming to maximize their self-interest with perfect information.

Answer: I
