Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Parker Bros discounting a draft. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these calculations, but I'll do my best.

First, the draft is for $3500, with a 6% interest rate, dated April 5, and due in 6 months. Then, it was discounted on August 20 at 6.5%. Also, there's a 1/3% collection fee. I need to find the proceeds.

Alright, let's start by understanding the timeline. The draft was dated April 5 and is due 6 months later. So, adding 6 months to April 5 would take us to October 5. But the discounting happened on August 20, which is before the maturity date. So, the period from August 20 to October 5 is the time we'll use for discounting.

Wait, no, actually, when you discount a bill before its maturity, you calculate the interest from the discount date to the maturity date. So, I need to find out how many days are between August 20 and October 5.

Let me figure out the number of days. April has 30 days, so April 5 to April 30 is 25 days. Then May has 31, June 30, July 31, August 20 is up to the 20th. Wait, no, we're starting from August 20 to October 5.

Wait, no, the draft was discounted on August 20, so the period from August 20 to October 5 is the period for which the discount will be applied.

Let me count the days:

August 20 to August 31: that's 11 days (since 31-20=11, but including the 20th? Wait, no, if you're counting from the 20th to the 31st, that's 11 days (20th is day 1, 21 is 2, ..., 31 is 11). Wait, no, actually, from August 20 to August 31 is 11 days because 31-20=11, but sometimes when counting periods, you include both start and end dates. Hmm, maybe it's better to use the formula for the number of days between two dates.

Alternatively, I can use the formula: days = (end date - start date) + 1. Wait, no, that might not always be correct because if the start and end are same day, it's 1 day. But in this case, let's see:

From August 20 to August 31: 31 - 20 = 11 days. Then, September has 30 days, and October 1 to 5 is 5 days. So total days from August 20 to October 5 would be 11 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) +5 (Oct) = 46 days.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because from August 20 to October 5 is more than a month. Let me check again.

Wait, August has 31 days, so from August 20 to August 31: that's 12 days (including the 20th). Wait, no, if you're going from day 20 to day 31, that's 12 days (20,21,...,31). Then September is 30 days, and October 1-5 is 5 days. So total is 12 +30 +5 =47 days.

Wait, but sometimes when calculating interest, the start date is included, so maybe it's 47 days. Hmm, but sometimes banks might not count the start date. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use an online day calculator, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed with 47 days for now.

Wait, let me double-check. August 20 to August 31: 31-20=11 days, but including the 20th, that's 12 days. Then September has 30, and October 1-5 is 5, so 12+30+5=47 days. Yes, that seems right.

So, the discount period is 47 days.

Now, the discount rate is 6.5%. But wait, the draft was originally at 6%, but the discounting is at 6.5%. So, the bank is applying a higher rate when discounting.

The formula for the discount is: (Face Value) * (Discount Rate) * (Time in years).

First, I need to convert 47 days into years. Since a year is 360 days in banking calculations (I think, or sometimes 365, but I'm not sure. Wait, in US banking, they often use 360 days for interest calculations, especially for short-term notes. So, I'll go with 360 days per year.

So, time in years is 47/360 ≈ 0.130555... years.

The discount amount would be Face Value * Rate * Time.

Face value is $3500.

So, discount = 3500 * 6.5% * (47/360).

Wait, 6.5% as a decimal is 0.065.

So, discount = 3500 * 0.065 * (47/360).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3500 * 0.065 = ?

3500 * 0.06 = 210.

3500 * 0.005 = 17.5.

So total is 210 +17.5 = 227.5.

Then, 227.5 * (47/360).

Let me compute 227.5 * 47 first.

227.5 * 40 = 9,100.

227.5 *7 = 1,592.5.

Total is 9,100 +1,592.5=10,692.5.

Then, divide by 360: 10,692.5 / 360 ≈ 29.701388...

So, the discount is approximately $29.70.

Wait, but the options have a B: $29.94. Hmm, maybe my day count is off.

Alternatively, maybe I should use 365 days in a year, but I'm not sure. Let me check that.

If I use 365 days, then time is 47/365 ≈ 0.128767 years.

So, discount = 3500 * 0.065 * 0.128767.

Compute 3500 *0.065 = 227.5 as before.

227.5 * 0.128767 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 227.5 *0.128767.

Well, 227.5 *0.1=22.75

227.5 *0.02=4.55

227.5 *0.008=1.82

227.5 *0.000767≈0.175.

Adding up: 22.75 +4.55=27.3; +1.82=29.12; +0.175≈29.295.

So, approximately $29.30. Still close to $29.70 and $29.30. Hmm, but the options have B as $29.94, which is close to 30. Maybe I made a mistake in the day count.

Wait, perhaps the period is 46 days instead of 47. Let me check the days again.

From August 20 to August 31: 31-20=11 days, but including both start and end, that's 12 days.

Then September:30 days, October:5 days.

Total:12+30+5=47 days.

Wait, but sometimes when calculating interest, the start date is excluded. So, maybe it's 46 days. Let me try that.

If it's 46 days, then time is 46/360 ≈ 0.127778 years.

Discount = 3500 *0.065 * (46/360).

3500 *0.065 = 227.5.

227.5 * (46/360) = ?

46/360 = 0.127778.

227.5 *0.127778 ≈ ?

227.5 *0.1=22.75

227.5 *0.02=4.55

227.5 *0.007778≈1.766.

Adding up:22.75 +4.55=27.3; +1.766≈29.066.

So about $29.07. Hmm, but the options have B:29.94, which is higher. Maybe I'm using the wrong day count.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated using the exact number of days between August 20 and October 5.

Let me use a different approach: count the days from August 20 to October 5.

August: 31 days. So from August 20 to August 31: 31-20=11 days, but including the 20th, that's 12 days.

September:30 days.

October:5 days.

Total:12 +30 +5=47 days.

So, 47 days is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the discount is calculated using 365 days a year instead of 360. Let me try that.

So time is 47/365 ≈ 0.128767 years.

Discount =3500 *0.065 *0.128767.

As before, that's approximately 29.30.

Hmm, but the options don't have 29.30. Wait, option J is 3563.04, which is close to 3500 minus 36.96. Wait, 3500 - 36.96=3463.04, but that's not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the interest on the draft first, then subtract the discount and the collection fee.

Wait, no, the discount is on the face value. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the maturity value first, then subtract the discount and the fee.

Wait, the draft has a 6% interest rate for 6 months. So the maturity value is 3500*(1 + 0.06*(6/12))=3500*(1.03)=3500*1.03=3605.

Wait, that's option G:3605. But wait, that's the maturity value. But the draft was discounted on August 20, which is before the maturity date. So the bank would discount the maturity value, not the original face value.

Wait, no, when you discount a bill, you calculate the present value based on the discount rate and the time until maturity. So the maturity value is 3500*(1 +0.06*(6/12))=3500*1.03=3605. Then, the bank discounts this 3605 at 6.5% over 47 days, and then subtracts the 1/3% collection fee.

Wait, but no, perhaps the discount is calculated on the face value, not the maturity value. I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

When a bill is discounted, the bank calculates the interest on the face value, not the maturity value. So, the discount amount is based on the face value, the discount rate, and the time until maturity.

So, the discount amount is 3500 * 0.065 * (47/360) ≈ 3500 *0.065 *0.130555≈3500 *0.0084858≈29.70.

Then, the proceeds would be face value minus discount, so 3500 -29.70≈3470.30. Then, subtract the collection fee of 1/3% of that amount.

Wait, no, the collection fee is a percentage of the proceeds, I think. Or is it a percentage of the discounted amount? I'm not sure. Let me read the question again.

The bank charged a 1/3% collection fee. So, I think it's 1/3% of the discounted amount (proceeds).

So, the steps would be:

1. Calculate the discount amount on the face value: 3500 * (6.5%) * (47/360) ≈29.70.

2. Subtract the discount from face value: 3500 -29.70=3470.30.

3. Subtract the collection fee, which is 1/3% of 3470.30.

1/3% is 0.0033333.

So, collection fee=3470.30 *0.0033333≈11.567.

So, total proceeds=3470.30 -11.567≈3458.73.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: $3400.00

B: $29.94

C: $3650.00

D: $3450.00

E: $3550.00

F: $3575.00

G: $3605

H: $3500

I: $3625.00

J: $3563.04

Hmm, 3458.73 is closest to option D:3450, but it's off by about $8.73. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated on the maturity value, not the face value.

Let me try that approach.

Maturity value is 3500*(1 +0.06*(6/12))=3500*1.03=3605.

Then, discount this at 6.5% for 47 days.

So, discount amount=3605 *0.065*(47/360).

Compute that: 3605 *0.065=234.325.

Then, 234.325 * (47/360)= 234.325 *0.130555≈30.60.

So, the discounted amount is 3605 -30.60=3574.40.

Then, subtract the collection fee of 1/3% on 3574.40.

1/3% is 0.0033333, so 3574.40 *0.0033333≈11.9147.

So, proceeds=3574.40 -11.9147≈3562.49.

Looking at the options, J is 3563.04, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but why did I get two different results based on whether I discount the face value or the maturity value? I think the correct approach is to discount the face value because the draft's interest hasn't been applied yet at the discount date. Wait, no, the draft is a 6% interest for 6 months, so the maturity value is 3605, but when you discount it before maturity, you use the maturity value as the principal for discounting.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The draft is a 6% simple interest note for 6 months. So, the interest is calculated on the face value, and the maturity value is 3500 + interest.

When the draft is discounted, the bank calculates the present value based on the maturity value. So, the discount is applied to the maturity value, not the face value.

So, the discount would be on 3605 at 6.5% for 47 days.

So, discount amount=3605 *0.065*(47/360).

As before, that's 3605 *0.065=234.325.

Then, 234.325 * (47/360)=234.325 *0.130555≈30.60.

So, discounted amount=3605 -30.60=3574.40.

Then, collection fee is 1/3% of 3574.40: 3574.40 *0.0033333≈11.9147.

So, proceeds=3574.40 -11.9147≈3562.49, which rounds to approximately $3562.49.

Looking at the options, J is $3563.04, which is very close. So, the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me check the day count again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days.

From August 20 to October 5.

August has 31 days, so from August 20 to August 31 is 12 days (including the 20th). September has 30 days, October 1-5 is 5 days. Total=12+30+5=47 days. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the calculation uses 365 days in a year, let's redo the discount calculation with 365 days.

Discount amount=3605 *0.065*(47/365).

47/365≈0.128767.

So, 3605 *0.065=234.325.

234.325 *0.128767≈30.18.

So, discounted amount=3605 -30.18=3574.82.

Collection fee=3574.82 *0.0033333≈11.916.

Proceeds=3574.82 -11.916≈3562.904, which is approximately $3562.90, which rounds to $3563.00, matching option J: $3563.04.

So, the correct answer is J.
</think>

The proceeds after discounting and subtracting the collection fee are calculated by first determining the number of days between August 20 and October 5, which is 47 days. The discount rate is 6.5%, and the collection fee is 1/3%. 

1. **Calculate the maturity value of the draft**:  
   The draft is for $3500 at 6% interest for 6 months.  
   Maturity value = $3500 × (1 + 0.06 × 0.5) = $3500 × 1.03 = $3605.

2. **Calculate the discount amount**:  
   The discount rate is 6.5% for 47 days.  
   Time in years = 47/365 ≈ 0.128767.  
   Discount amount = $3605 × 0.065 × 0.128767 ≈ $30.18.

3. **Subtract the discount**:  
   Discounted amount = $3605 - $30.18 ≈ $3574.82.

4. **Calculate the collection fee**:  
   Collection fee = $3574.82 × (1/3%) ≈ $11.916.

5. **Final proceeds**:  
   Proceeds = $3574.82 - $11.916 ≈ $3562.90, which rounds to $3563.04.
