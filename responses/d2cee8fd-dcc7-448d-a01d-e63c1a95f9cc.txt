Okay, so I need to figure out which attachment pattern is most associated with child abuse and neglect. I remember that attachment theory has different types, like secure, avoidant, ambivalent, and disorganized. 

Child abuse and neglect can really affect a child's attachment style. I think when a child doesn't get their emotional needs met, they might develop an insecure attachment. But I'm not sure which specific type that would be.

I recall that there's something called disorganized attachment. This happens when a child's primary caregiver is either unavailable or frightening, causing the child to show contradictory behaviors. They might approach the caregiver but then pull away, or show fear when the caregiver tries to comfort them.

I also remember reading that disorganized attachment is often linked to later emotional and behavioral problems. It makes sense that if a child is abused or neglected, their attachment would be disorganized because their caregiver isn't providing the consistent, responsive care needed for a secure attachment.

Looking at the options, B is disorganized/disoriented, which sounds similar to what I was thinking. There's also F: disorganized/avoidant, but I think disorganized is a broader category that can include avoidant behaviors as part of it, but the primary association is with disorganized attachment.

Wait, but I should double-check. Secure attachment is A, which is the opposite of what we're looking for. Distant/ambivalent (C) and distant/disengaged (D) don't quite fit either. Insecure/avoidant (E) is another type, but I think that's more about the child avoiding closeness, which is different from the disorganized patterns seen in abuse.

So, putting it all together, the most associated pattern with abuse and neglect is likely disorganized/disoriented, which is option B.

The attachment pattern most associated with child abuse and neglect is disorganized/disoriented, as it reflects the child's contradictory and fearful responses due to inconsistent or harmful caregiving. 

Answer: B
