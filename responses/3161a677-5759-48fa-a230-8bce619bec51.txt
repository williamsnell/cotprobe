The hunter turned, causing the rifle to be pointed at the hiker. The hiker felt sure that he was going to get shot, but the gun did not go off. The hiker asserts a claim for assault against the hunter. In his action, the most likely result is that the hiker will

A: recover, if the hiker can prove negligence on the hunter's part.
B: recover, if the hunter knew the hiker was there when he turned.
C: recover, because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at him.
D: recover, if the hiker feared for his life.
E: not recover, if the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.
F: not recover, unless the hiker can prove the hunter saw him.
G: not recover, if the hiker failed to make his presence known to the hunter.
H: recover, because the hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about assault. Let me start by understanding the scenario. There's a hiker on a trail who comes around a bend and sees a hunter standing next to the trail, looking the other way. The hunter turns and points the rifle at the hiker. The hiker thought he was going to get shot, but nothing happened. Now, the hiker is suing for assault.

Alright, I remember that assault involves intentional infliction of fear of imminent harmful or offensive contact. So, the key elements are intent, a reasonable belief of imminent harm, and the offensive contact doesn't have to happen, just the apprehension of it.

The question is about whether the hiker can recover for assault. The options are A through I. Let me go through each option to see which one fits.

Option A says the hiker can recover if he proves negligence. Wait, but assault is intentional tort, not negligence. So negligence wouldn't be the right basis here. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Recover if the hunter knew the hiker was there when he turned. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify if the hunter knew. The hiker felt sure he was going to get shot, but the hunter might not have seen him. Maybe the hiker didn't make his presence known. So knowing might be a factor, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option C: Recover because the rifle was pointed directly at him. Pointing a gun can be an assault if it causes reasonable fear. But just pointing might not always be enough without the intent. So maybe, but let's see other options.

Option D: Recover if the hiker feared for his life. Well, fear is a part of it, but it has to be reasonable and caused by the defendant's actions. So the fear alone isn't enough; it has to be due to the intentional act.

Option E: Not recover if the hunter didn't intend to shoot. Wait, but in assault, the intent is to cause apprehension, not necessarily to carry it out. So even if the hunter didn't intend to shoot, if his actions caused the hiker to fear being shot, that could still be assault. So E might be incorrect because intent to shoot isn't required, just intent to cause fear.

Option F: Not recover unless the hiker can prove the hunter saw him. Well, the hiker came around the bend and saw the hunter. The hunter turned and pointed the rifle. So the hiker did make his presence known by being there, but did the hunter see him? If the hunter didn't see him, maybe he didn't intend. But the hiker's presence is known by being there, so whether the hunter saw him is a factor, but I'm not sure if it's a strict requirement.

Option G: Not recover if the hiker failed to make his presence known. The hiker was on the trail, came around a bend, and saw the hunter. The hunter turned and pointed the rifle. So the hiker's presence was known by his being there. Unless the hiker was hiding or didn't approach, but in the scenario, he was on the trail. So G might not apply because the hiker was visible.

Option H: Recover because the hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary. That doesn't seem relevant. The issue is the act of pointing the gun, not carrying it. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: Not recover unless the hunter intended to scare the hiker. But intent in assault is about causing fear, not necessarily the specific intent to scare. So if the hunter's act caused fear, it might be assault regardless of intent to scare. So I think I is incorrect because the intent is to cause apprehension, not specifically to scare.

Putting it together, the key elements are that the hunter's act caused the hiker to fear imminent harm, and that the fear was reasonable. The fact that the gun was pointed directly at him (Option C) seems important. Pointing a gun can create a reasonable fear of being shot, so that might be enough for assault. But I also need to check other options.

Wait, option E says not recover if the hunter didn't intend to shoot. But in assault, the defendant's intent is to cause fear, not necessarily to carry out the act. So even if the hunter didn't intend to shoot, if his actions (pointing the gun) caused fear, that's assault. So E is incorrect because the lack of intent to shoot doesn't matter; the intent to cause fear does.

So the correct answer should be that the hiker can recover because the rifle was pointed directly at him, which would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent harm. So Option C.

The correct answer is C: recover, because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at him. Pointing a gun can create a reasonable fear of imminent harm, satisfying the elements of assault.
