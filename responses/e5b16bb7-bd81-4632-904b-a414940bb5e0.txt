Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aircraft in level flight. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the effective lift area of the aircraft. Let me jot down what I know from the problem statement.

The aircraft is flying at 250 km/h. That's the speed, V. The air is at standard conditions, which I think means standard temperature and pressure, so maybe I can use standard air density. The lift coefficient is 0.4, and the drag coefficient is 0.0065. The mass of the aircraft is 850 kg.

Wait, but since it's in level flight, that probably means the lift force equals the weight of the aircraft, right? Because if it's not accelerating up or down, the net force is zero, so lift must balance weight.

So, first, I'll need to calculate the lift force. The formula for lift force is L = 0.5 * rho * V² * A * Cl, where rho is air density, V is speed, A is the area, and Cl is the lift coefficient. But since the mass is given, I can find the weight, which equals the lift force.

Weight (W) is mass (m) times gravity (g). So W = m * g. Let's compute that: m is 850 kg, and g is approximately 9.81 m/s².

Calculating W: 850 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 8348.5 N. So the lift force L is 8348.5 N.

Now, I need to find the effective lift area A. The formula rearranged for A would be A = L / (0.5 * rho * V² * Cl).

Wait, but I need the air density, rho. At standard conditions, I think rho is about 1.225 kg/m³. I remember that from standard sea level conditions.

Next, I need to convert the speed from km/h to m/s because the units need to be consistent. V is 250 km/h. To convert, I multiply by 1000 m/km and divide by 3600 s/h. So 250 * 1000 / 3600 = approximately 69.444 m/s.

Now plug all the numbers into the formula for A.

So A = L / (0.5 * rho * V² * Cl) = 8348.5 / (0.5 * 1.225 * (69.444)^2 * 0.4).

Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, calculate V squared: (69.444)^2 ≈ 69.444 * 69.444. Let me compute that: 69 * 69 is 4761, but more accurately, 69.444^2 is approximately 4824.37 m²/s².

Next, multiply by rho: 1.225 kg/m³ * 4824.37 m²/s² = 1.225 * 4824.37 ≈ 5928.85 kg/(m·s²).

Then multiply by Cl: 0.4 * 5928.85 ≈ 2371.54 kg/(m·s²).

Now multiply by 0.5: 0.5 * 2371.54 ≈ 1185.77 kg/(m·s²).

So the denominator is approximately 1185.77.

Now A = 8348.5 / 1185.77 ≈ let me calculate that.

Dividing 8348.5 by 1185.77. Let me see: 1185 * 6 is 7110, 1185*7 is 8295. So 7 times 1185 is 8295, which is just slightly less than 8348.5. The difference is about 53.5. So 7 plus 53.5/1185 ≈ roughly 7.045.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 8348.5 ÷ 1185.77.

Let me do this division properly.

1185.77 * 7 = 8299.39. Subtract that from 8348.5: 8348.5 - 8299.39 = 49.11.

So 49.11 / 1185.77 ≈ approximately 0.0414.

So total A ≈ 7.0414 m².

Looking at the options, option B is 7.03 m², and option A is 7.10. So my calculation is around 7.04, which is closer to 7.03. But wait, maybe my calculations were a bit off due to rounding. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating V squared. Let me recheck that.

V = 250 km/h = 250 * 1000 m / 3600 s. So 250,000 / 3600 ≈ 69.444 m/s. Correct.

V squared is (69.444)^2. Let me compute it more accurately. 69.444 squared.

69.444 * 69.444: 69^2 = 4761. 0.444 * 69.444 * 2 = approximately 63.444. 0.444^2 ≈ 0.197. So total would be 4761 + 63.444 + 0.197 ≈ 4824.641 m²/s². So that's correct.

Then, 0.5 * rho * V² * Cl = 0.5 * 1.225 * 4824.641 * 0.4.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.5 * 1.225 = 0.6125.

Then, 0.6125 * 4824.641 ≈ let me calculate that. 4824.641 * 0.6 is 2894.785, and 0.0125 * 4824.641 ≈ 60.308. Adding them: 2894.785 + 60.308 ≈ 2955.093.

Then, multiply by Cl (0.4): 2955.093 * 0.4 = 1182.037.

So the denominator is approximately 1182.04.

Now, A = 8348.5 / 1182.04 ≈ let's compute that.

1182.04 * 7 = 8274.28. Subtract from 8348.5: 8348.5 - 8274.28 = 74.22.

So 74.22 / 1182.04 ≈ approximately 0.0628.

So total A ≈ 7.0628 m².

Hmm, that's about 7.06 m². Looking at the options, option B is 7.03, option A is 7.10. So perhaps my initial approximation was a bit off, but with more precise calculation, it's about 7.06, which isn't exactly matching any option. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should consider more precise values for V and other terms. Let me recompute V more accurately.

250 km/h = 250,000 m / 3600 s = approximately 69.4444444 m/s.

So V squared is (69.4444444)^2 = 4824.427 m²/s².

Now, 0.5 * rho = 0.5 * 1.225 = 0.6125.

Multiply that by V squared: 0.6125 * 4824.427 = let me compute that.

0.6 * 4824.427 = 2894.656.

0.0125 * 4824.427 = 60.30534.

Adding them gives 2894.656 + 60.30534 = 2954.961.

Now multiply by Cl (0.4): 2954.961 * 0.4 = 1181.9844.

So denominator is 1181.9844.

Now, lift force L is 8348.5 N.

So A = 8348.5 / 1181.9844 ≈ let's compute this division.

Let me see, 1181.9844 * 7 = 8273.8908.

Subtract from 8348.5: 8348.5 - 8273.8908 = 74.6092.

Now, 74.6092 / 1181.9844 ≈ 0.0631.

So total A ≈ 7.0631 m².

Hmm, that's about 7.06 m². But the options don't have exactly that. The closest option is B:7.03 and A:7.10.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula. Oh, wait, the problem gives drag coefficient, but I didn't use it. Did I miss that?

Wait, the question is about lift area, so maybe the drag coefficient is a distractor or perhaps I'm supposed to consider it. Wait no, because for level flight, lift equals weight, and drag equals thrust. But the problem gives the drag coefficient; perhaps that's used for something else. Wait, but the question is about lift area, so perhaps I don't need it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the required lift and then the area.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula correctly. Let me write it again.

L = 0.5 * rho * V^2 * A * Cl.

So A = L / (0.5 * rho * V^2 * Cl).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute each part again.

Compute V: 250 km/h = 69.4444444 m/s.

V squared: (69.4444444)^2 = 4824.427 m²/s².

0.5 * rho = 0.5 * 1.225 = 0.6125 kg/m³.

Multiply that by V squared: 0.6125 * 4824.427 = 2954.961 kg/(m·s²).

Multiply by Cl (0.4): 2954.961 * 0.4 = 1181.9844.

So denominator is 1181.9844.

Lift force L is m * g = 850 * 9.81 = let me compute that exactly.

850 * 9.81 = (800 *9.81) + (50 *9.81) = 7848 + 490.5 = 8338.5 N.

So A = 8338.5 / 1181.9844 ≈ let's compute that.

1181.9844 × 7 = 8273.8908.

Subtract from 8338.5: 8338.5 - 8273.8908 = 64.6092.

Now, 64.6092 / 1181.9844 ≈ approximately 0.0546.

So total A ≈ 7.0546 m², which is approximately 7.05 m².

Looking at the options, the closest is B:7.03 and A:7.10.

Hmm, perhaps I made a rounding error somewhere. Let me check if the mass was 850 kg and g is 9.81 m/s². Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using a different value for rho. Let me check: standard sea level air density is 1.225 kg/m³, yes.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise calculation for V.

Wait, 250 km/h is exactly 250,000 m / 3600 s = 69.4444444... m/s.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the calculation to avoid rounding errors.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute A using the exact values without approximating.

Let me try that.

Compute V: 250,000 / 3600 = 69.4444444 m/s.

V squared: (69.4444444)^2 = 4824.42703 m²/s².

0.5 * rho = 0.5 * 1.225 = 0.6125.

Multiply by V squared: 0.6125 * 4824.42703 = 2954.960956.

Multiply by Cl (0.4): 2954.960956 * 0.4 = 1181.984382.

So denominator is 1181.984382.

Lift force L is 850 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 8338.5 N.

So A = 8338.5 / 1181.984382 ≈ let's compute this.

Using a calculator approach: 8338.5 ÷ 1181.984382 ≈ let's see.

1181.984382 × 7 = 8273.890674.

Subtract from 8338.5: 8338.5 - 8273.890674 = 64.609326.

Now, 64.609326 ÷ 1181.984382 ≈ 0.05464.

So A ≈ 7.05464 m².

Rounded to two decimal places, that's approximately 7.05 m².

Looking at the options, option B is 7.03 m², which is very close. The slight difference might be due to rounding during calculations or perhaps using a slightly different value for g or rho.

Wait, perhaps I should try using g as exactly 9.8 m/s² instead of 9.81 to see if that changes the result.

If g is 9.8 m/s², then L = 850 * 9.8 = 8330 N.

So A = 8330 / 1181.984382 ≈ let's compute that.

1181.984382 × 7 = 8273.890674.

Subtract from 8330: 8330 - 8273.890674 = 56.109326.

56.109326 ÷ 1181.984382 ≈ 0.04747.

So A ≈ 7.04747 m² ≈ 7.05 m².

Still around 7.05, which is closer to 7.03 than to 7.10, but perhaps the intended answer is option B:7.03.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the dynamic pressure and solving for area.

Wait, dynamic pressure q is 0.5 * rho * V².

q = 0.5 * 1.225 * (69.444)^2 ≈ 0.5 * 1.225 * 4824.427 ≈ 0.6125 * 4824.427 ≈ 2954.96 N/m².

Lift force L = 8338.5 N.

So A = L / (Cl * q) = 8338.5 / (0.4 * 2954.96).

Compute denominator: 0.4 * 2954.96 ≈ 1181.984.

So A = 8338.5 / 1181.984 ≈ 7.05 m².

Same result as before.

So among the options, the closest is B:7.03, but my calculation is 7.05. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question asks for effective lift area. Effective lift area sometimes refers to the area that produces lift, which might involve considering factors like襟翼 or other aerodynamic devices, but I don't think that's the case here. The problem probably just wants the standard wing area.

Alternatively, perhaps the lift coefficient given is for a different configuration, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the way I calculated the denominator. Let me double-check.

Denominator: 0.5 * rho * V^2 * Cl.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute everything with more precise numbers.

Let me use more accurate values:

g = 9.80665 m/s².

So L = 850 * 9.80665 = let's compute that.

850 * 9.80665: 800 *9.80665=7845.32, 50*9.80665=490.3325. Total: 7845.32 + 490.3325 = 8335.6525 N.

So L = 8335.6525 N.

Now, V = 250,000 / 3600 = 69.4444444 m/s.

V^2 = (69.4444444)^2 = 4824.42703 m²/s².

0.5 * rho = 0.5 * 1.225 = 0.6125 kg/m³.

Multiply by V^2: 0.6125 * 4824.42703 = 2954.960956 kg/(m·s²).

Multiply by Cl (0.4): 2954.960956 * 0.4 = 1181.984382.

So denominator is 1181.984382.

A = 8335.6525 / 1181.984382 ≈ let's compute.

1181.984382 × 7 = 8273.890674.

Subtract from 8335.6525: 8335.6525 - 8273.890674 = 61.761826.

Now, 61.761826 / 1181.984382 ≈ 0.05228.

So A ≈ 7.05228 m² ≈7.05 m².

Still around 7.05. The options are B:7.03 and A:7.10. Maybe the intended answer is B, considering possible rounding differences.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the speed was given in the wrong unit. Did I mess up km/h to m/s?

Wait, 250 km/h is correct as 69.444 m/s. Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for rho, like 1.2 kg/m³. Let me try that.

If rho =1.2 kg/m³,

Denominator: 0.5 *1.2 *4824.427 *0.4 = 0.6 *4824.427 *0.4 = 0.6*0.4=0.24; 0.24 *4824.427≈1157.862.

A = 8335.6525 / 1157.862 ≈7.197 m². That's around 7.20, which is option C.

Wait, but standard air density is 1.225, not 1.2. So maybe the problem expects using 1.2 for simplicity. If that's the case, then the answer would be around 7.20, which is option C.

But the options include C as 7.20 m².

Wait, but the question says "standard conditions," which typically use rho =1.225. But perhaps the problem expects using rho=1.2 for easier calculation.

Let me check with rho=1.2.

So denominator: 0.5 *1.2=0.6.

0.6 *4824.427=2894.656.

Multiply by Cl=0.4: 2894.656*0.4=1157.862.

A=8335.6525 /1157.862≈7.197≈7.20 m².

So option C is 7.20 m².

But earlier with rho=1.225, I got around 7.05, which isn't exactly an option. But with rho=1.2, it's 7.20, which is option C.

Wait, but the problem states "standard conditions," which I'm pretty sure uses rho=1.225. So perhaps the intended answer is 7.03, option B, but my calculation with rho=1.225 gives 7.05, which isn't exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the formula.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem uses the formula where lift is equal to (density * V^2 / 2) * Area * Cl, but I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the drag coefficient is a red herring, but the question is about lift area, so it might not be needed.

Wait, perhaps I should try to see what option B would be with rho=1.225.

If option B is 7.03, let's see what A would be.

Compute A as 7.03 m².

Then, compute lift: 0.5 *1.225 * (69.444)^2 *7.03 *0.4.

Compute denominator: 0.5 *1.225=0.6125.

0.6125 * (69.444)^2=0.6125 *4824.427≈2954.96.

Multiply by Cl=0.4: 2954.96 *0.4=1181.984.

Multiply by A=7.03: 1181.984 *7.03≈8311.65 N.

But the actual lift needed is 8335.65 N. So 8311 is a bit less. So perhaps the correct A is a bit higher than 7.03 to reach 8335.

Similarly, at A=7.05, lift would be 1181.984 *7.05≈8337 N, which matches the required lift.

So perhaps the intended answer is 7.03, but my calculation with rho=1.225 gives around 7.05, which is not an option. But option B is 7.03.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a rounded value for V or other terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different formula, such as considering that lift is also affected by the aspect ratio or other factors, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the lift coefficient is given correctly. The problem states lift coefficient is 0.4, which seems reasonable.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation with more precise steps.

Compute L = m * g = 850 *9.81=8348.5 N.

Compute V = 250,000 /3600 =69.4444444 m/s.

V squared=4824.42703 m²/s².

0.5 * rho=0.6125.

Multiply by V squared: 0.6125 *4824.42703=2954.960956.

Multiply by Cl=0.4: 2954.960956 *0.4=1181.984382.

A = 8348.5 /1181.984382≈7.05 m².

So with exact calculation, it's 7.05. The options don't have that, but option B is 7.03, which is just 0.02 less. Perhaps the problem expects rounding to two decimal places, but why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using V in km/h without converting to m/s. Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Lift equation uses m/s.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the formula with V in km/h, but that's unlikely because the units wouldn't work out. The lift equation requires velocity in m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the dynamic pressure in a different way. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem uses the formula for lift as L = Cl * (rho * V^2 / 2) * A. That's the same as I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using V in km/h, but that would require changing the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the speed is given in km/h, and I should use the value in that unit, but the formula requires m/s, so that's why I converted it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recompute it.

Denominator: 0.5 * rho * V^2 * Cl.

0.5 *1.225=0.6125.

0.6125 * V^2=0.6125 *4824.427=2954.961.

2954.961 *0.4=1181.9844.

Yes, that's correct.

So A=8348.5 /1181.9844≈7.05 m².

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is 7.03, but my calculation is 7.05. Maybe the problem expects us to round to two decimal places, but 7.05 would round to 7.05, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the options were approximated, and 7.03 is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I divided correctly.

Wait, 8348.5 ÷1181.9844.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

Compute 1181.9844 ×7=8273.8908.

Subtract from 8348.5: 8348.5-8273.8908=74.6092.

Now, compute 74.6092 ÷1181.9844.

74.6092 ÷1181.9844 ≈0.0631.

So total A=7.0631 m².

Wait, that's about 7.06, which is closer to 7.05.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B:7.03, but my calculation is 7.05.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses rho=1.225 kg/m³ but with V in km/h not converted correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using V in m/s without converting, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using an approximate value for V, like 70 m/s instead of 69.444.

Let me try that.

If V=70 m/s, V squared=4900 m²/s².

Denominator: 0.5 *1.225 *4900 *0.4.

0.5 *1.225=0.6125.

0.6125 *4900=3001.25.

Multiply by 0.4: 3001.25 *0.4=1200.5.

A=8348.5 /1200.5≈6.95 m², which is option I.

But that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using V=69 m/s.

V=69 m/s, V squared=4761.

Denominator:0.5 *1.225=0.6125.

0.6125 *4761=2922.5625.

Multiply by 0.4: 2922.5625 *0.4=1169.025.

A=8348.5 /1169.025≈7.14 m², which is close to option C:7.20.

Hmm, but that doesn't align with the exact calculation.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this, and the closest option is B:7.03, but my calculation is 7.05. Alternatively, perhaps option B is the intended answer, and the slight discrepancy is due to rounding in the problem's numbers.
</think>

To calculate the effective lift area of the aircraft, we start by noting that the aircraft is in level flight, meaning the lift force equals the weight of the aircraft. The weight \( W \) is given by:

\[
W = m \cdot g = 850 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 8348.5 \, \text{N}
\]

The lift force \( L \) is equal to the weight, so \( L = 8348.5 \, \text{N} \). The formula for lift force is:

\[
L = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot V^2 \cdot A \cdot C_l
\]

Rearranging for \( A \), the effective lift area:

\[
A = \frac{L}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot V^2 \cdot C_l}
\]

### Step 1: Convert speed to m/s
The speed is given as \( 250 \, \text{km/h} \), which converts to:

\[
V = 250 \cdot \frac{1000}{3600} = 69.444 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( V^2 \)
\[
V^2 = (69.444)^2 = 4824.427 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Air density
At standard conditions, \( \rho = 1.225 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the denominator
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot V^2 \cdot C_l = 0.5 \cdot 1.225 \cdot 4824.427 \cdot 0.4
\]

First, calculate \( 0.5 \cdot 1.225 = 0.6125 \).

\[
0.6125 \cdot 4824.427 = 2954.961
\]

\[
2954.961 \cdot 0.4 = 1181.9844
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( A \)
\[
A = \frac{8348.5}{1181.9844} \approx 7.05 \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 6: Compare with options
The calculated value of \( A \approx 7.05 \, \text{m}^2 \) is closest to option **B: 7.03 m²**, considering possible rounding differences or approximations in the problem setup.
