Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the pH and percent hydrolysis of a sodium acetate solution. Let's see, the solution is 0.1 M NaC₂H₃O₂. I remember that sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

First, I'll jot down what I know. Sodium acetate dissociates completely in water into Na+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ (which is the acetate ion). The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will undergo hydrolysis: C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H2O ↔ HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻.

The problem gives me K_w = 1.0 × 10^-4 and K_diss = 1.8 × 10^-5. Wait, K_diss is usually the dissociation constant for the acid, which is K_a for acetic acid. So K_a = 1.8 × 10^-5. Since K_w = K_a * K_b, I can find K_b for the acetate ion.

Calculating K_b: K_b = K_w / K_a = (1.0 × 10^-4) / (1.8 × 10^-5) ≈ 5.555... × 10^-1. Hmm, that's about 0.5556.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, K_w is 1e-4, which is 1.0 × 10^-4, and K_a is 1.8 × 10^-5. So dividing those gives (1e-4)/(1.8e-5) = (10e-5)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.555... So K_b is approximately 5.556 × 10^-1? That seems high, but okay, maybe because K_w is given as 1e-4, which is unusual because normally K_w is 1e-14 at 25°C. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, in the problem statement, K_w is provided as 1.0 × 10^-4, which is probably at a different temperature, like maybe 50°C or something. So I'll proceed with that.

So, K_b for acetate is 5.556 × 10^-1? Wait, that's like 0.5556. That's a very large K_b, which makes sense because if K_a is 1.8e-5 and K_w is 1e-4, then K_b would be (1e-4)/(1.8e-5) ≈5.555e-1. So, yes.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction of acetate is:

C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H2O ↔ HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.1 M. At equilibrium, let's let x be the concentration of OH⁻ produced. So the change would be:

[C₂H₃O₂⁻] = 0.1 - x
[HC₂H₃O₂] = x
[OH⁻] = x

The expression for K_b is:

K_b = [HC₂H₃O₂][OH⁻] / [C₂H₃O₂⁻] = x² / (0.1 - x) ≈ 0.5556

Wait, but x is likely to be much smaller than 0.1, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. So the equation simplifies to x² / 0.1 = 0.5556 → x² = 0.5556 * 0.1 → x² = 0.05556 → x = sqrt(0.05556) ≈ 0.2357 M.

Wait, but wait, if x is about 0.2357, and the initial concentration is 0.1 M, that would mean 0.2357 > 0.1, which can't be possible because you can't have more product than the reactant. So my assumption that x is small is invalid here. Hmm, that complicates things.

So I need to solve the quadratic equation accurately. Let's set it up:

x² / (0.1 - x) = 0.5556

Multiply both sides by (0.1 - x):

x² = 0.5556 * (0.1 - x)

x² = 0.05556 - 0.5556 x

Bring all terms to one side:

x² + 0.5556 x - 0.05556 = 0

This is a quadratic equation: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=0.5556, c=-0.05556.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Plugging in the values:

b² = (0.5556)^2 ≈ 0.3086

4ac = 4 * 1 * (-0.05556) ≈ -0.2222

So the discriminant is 0.3086 + 0.2222 = 0.5308.

sqrt(0.5308) ≈ 0.7286.

So x = [-0.5556 ± 0.7286]/2

We take the positive root because concentration can't be negative.

x = ( -0.5556 + 0.7286 ) / 2 → (0.173) / 2 ≈ 0.0865 M.

Wait, that's about 0.0865 M. So [OH⁻] is 0.0865 M.

Wait, but wait, that's still a significant portion of the initial 0.1 M. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, when I set up the equation, I think I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck:

x² = 0.5556 (0.1 - x) → x² = 0.05556 - 0.5556 x → x² + 0.5556 x - 0.05556 = 0.

Wait, that's correct. So the quadratic is correct.

So b is 0.5556, so yes, the calculation was correct. So x≈0.0865 M.

So [OH⁻] = 0.0865 M. Then pOH is -log(0.0865). Let's calculate that.

pOH = log(1/[OH⁻]) = log(1/0.0865) ≈ log(11.556) ≈ 1.063.

So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.063 ≈ 12.937. Wait, that can't be right because none of the options have a pH around 13. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check K_b. K_b = K_w / K_a = (1.0e-4) / (1.8e-5) = (10e-5)/(1.8e-5) = 10/1.8 ≈5.5556. So that's correct.

Then the quadratic equation: x²/(0.1 - x) = 5.5556.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try using the approximation method again, perhaps I'm missing something.

If I assume x is not negligible, but maybe the initial assumption was wrong, but the quadratic solution gives x=0.0865 M, which is about 86.5% of 0.1 M. That's a lot, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but wait, if [OH⁻] is 0.0865 M, then pOH is about 1.06, so pH is 12.94. But looking at the options, the highest pH is 11.88 (option G). So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K_b. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, K_b is K_w / K_a = (1e-4)/(1.8e-5) ≈5.5556e-1.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this using the hydrolysis equation again.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of OH- can be found using the formula for a weak base. The formula is:

[OH⁻] = sqrt( (K_b * C) )

But that's only when K_b is small, so the approximation holds. But in this case, K_b is 0.5556, which is quite large, so the approximation x << C doesn't hold.

Wait, but in the quadratic solution, I got x ≈0.0865 M, which gives [OH⁻]=0.0865 M, pOH=1.06, pH=12.94. But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh, wait, the problem says K_w = 1.0e-4. Normally, K_w is 1e-14 at 25°C, but here it's given as 1e-4, which is much larger. So the solution is at a higher temperature, perhaps around 90°C, because K_w increases with temperature. So in this case, the solution is more conductive, but that doesn't change the approach, just the values.

Wait, but perhaps I should check the hydrolysis again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the given K_diss is the dissociation constant of the conjugate acid, which would be K_a for acetic acid. So perhaps K_a is 1.8e-5, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate the quadratic solution.

So, x² +0.5556 x -0.05556 =0.

Discriminant D = (0.5556)^2 +4*1*0.05556 = 0.3086 + 0.22224 ≈0.5308.

sqrt(D)=~0.7286.

x= [ -0.5556 +0.7286 ] /2 → (0.173)/2=0.0865 M.

So [OH⁻]=0.0865 M, as before.

pOH= -log(0.0865)=1.063, pH=14-1.063=12.937.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 13. The highest pH is 11.88 (option G). So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in K_b. Let me recheck.

K_b = K_w / K_a = (1.0e-4)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e-1.

Yes, that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the K_diss given is K_b, not K_a? Wait, the problem says K_diss=1.8e-5. Oh, wait, K_diss could be the dissociation constant of the base, but that's not standard notation. Usually, K_a is for the acid, K_b for the base.

Alternatively, perhaps K_diss refers to K_a. Let me assume that K_diss is K_a for acetic acid, which is 1.8e-5. So K_b = K_w / K_a = (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)=0.5555.

Wait, but that brings me back to the same issue.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the hydrolysis of acetate. The hydrolysis reaction is C2H3O2^- + H2O ↔ HC2H3O2 + OH^-. The K for this reaction is K_b = [HC2H3O2][OH^-]/[C2H3O2^-].

So, with initial concentration 0.1 M acetate, and change x, the equilibrium concentrations are [HC2H3O2]=x, [OH^-]=x, [C2H3O2^-]=0.1 -x.

So, K_b = x²/(0.1 -x) =0.5555.

But when I solved this earlier, I got x≈0.0865 M. But that gives a pH of 12.94, which isn't among the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should try the approximation again, but this time without assuming x is small.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that K_b is large, so the solution is strongly basic, and perhaps the hydrolysis is more than 5% of the initial concentration, so the approximation x << C doesn't hold. But in that case, the quadratic solution is the way to go.

Wait, but according to the quadratic solution, x is 0.0865 M, which is 86.5% of 0.1 M. That seems very high. Maybe I should check the math again.

Wait, let me re-calculate the quadratic equation:

x² +0.5556 x - 0.05556 =0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-0.5556 ± sqrt( (0.5556)^2 +4*1*0.05556 ) ] /2.

Calculate the discriminant:

(0.5556)^2 = 0.5556 * 0.5556 ≈ 0.5556² → let's compute:

0.5 *0.5=0.25, 0.05*0.5=0.025, 0.0056*0.5=0.0028. Hmm, perhaps better to compute 5556 *5556:

But perhaps it's easier to compute 0.5556^2:

= (5556e-4)^2 = (5556)^2 *1e-8.

5556^2 = (5000 +556)^2 = 5000² + 2*5000*556 +556² =25,000,000 +5,560,000 + 309,136 =30,869,136.

So 0.5556^2=30,869,136e-8 = 0.30869136.

Then 4ac =4*1*0.05556=0.22224.

So discriminant D=0.30869136 +0.22224=0.53093136.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(0.53093136)=approx 0.7286.

So x= [ -0.5556 +0.7286 ] /2 → (0.173)/2=0.0865.

Same as before. So x=0.0865 M.

So [OH⁻]=0.0865 M → pOH= -log(0.0865) ≈1.063 → pH=14-1.063=12.937.

But the options don't have anything close to that. The highest pH is 11.88 (option G). So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given K_w is 1e-4, so the water is more ionized, but that affects H+ and OH- concentrations, but the calculation should still hold.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should calculate the percent hydrolysis, which is (x / initial concentration) *100. So x=0.0865, initial is 0.1. So percent hydrolysis is (0.0865/0.1)*100=86.5%. But that's way higher than any of the options provided. The highest option is E: 0.95%, which is way lower. So that suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up K_a and K_b. Let me think again. K_b is K_w / K_a. If K_a is 1.8e-5, then K_b is (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)= ~5.555e-1, as before.

Wait, but perhaps the problem states that K_diss is the dissociation of the base, so K_b=1.8e-5. Wait, the problem says K_diss=1.8e-5. Hmm, that could be K_b. Because sometimes K_diss refers to the base's dissociation. So perhaps K_b=1.8e-5, and K_w=1e-4.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "Assume K_w=1.0 × 10^-4 and K_diss=1.8 × 10^-5."

Hmm, K_diss is usually K_a for the acid or K_b for the base. If it's K_b for acetate, then K_b=1.8e-5. Then K_a would be K_w / K_b = (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)= ~5.555e1=55.55.

Wait, but that would make the acetate a stronger base, which would lead to a higher pH. Wait, no, wait: if K_b is 1.8e-5, that's a small K_b, meaning the base isn't very strong. So that would lead to a lower pH, perhaps around 9 or 10.

Wait, maybe I should try this approach. Let's assume that K_diss is K_b for acetate, so K_b=1.8e-5.

Then, the hydrolysis equation is C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H₂O ↔ HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻.

K_b = [HC₂H₃O₂][OH⁻]/[C₂H₃O₂⁻] =1.8e-5.

Initial concentration of acetate is 0.1 M. Let x be the concentration of OH⁻ produced.

So, [C₂H₃O₂⁻]=0.1 -x ≈0.1 (assuming x is small).

[HC₂H₃O₂]=x.

[OH⁻]=x.

So K_b ≈x²/(0.1)=1.8e-5 → x²=1.8e-5 *0.1=1.8e-6 → x= sqrt(1.8e-6)= approx 0.001342 M.

So [OH⁻]=0.001342 M → pOH= -log(0.001342)≈2.87 → pH=14-2.87=11.13.

Wait, that's close to option A: pH=10.88, but not quite. Also, percent hydrolysis would be (0.001342/0.1)*100=1.342%, which is about 1.34%, but none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option B is pH=10.88, % hydrolysis=0.85%. Option A: pH=10.88, 0.75% hydro. Option E: pH=11.38, 0.95%. Option G: pH=11.88, 0.85%. Hmm.

Wait, but if K_b=1.8e-5, then x=0.001342, which is 0.1342% hydrolysis, not 1.34%, because 0.001342 is 0.1342% of 0.1 M. Wait, no: (0.001342/0.1)*100 = 1.342%. Oh wait, no: 0.001342 is 0.1342% of 1 M, but since the initial is 0.1 M, the percent is (0.001342 /0.1)*100=1.342%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming K_diss is K_b.

Alternatively, perhaps K_diss is K_a, as I originally thought. But that led to a pH of ~12.94, which isn't present. So maybe the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The formula is pH = pK_b + log(C), but wait, no: for weak bases, pH = ½ (pK_b - log C). Wait, no, that's for when the base is weak and the concentration is low.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the pH of a solution of a weak base is:

pOH = (pK_b - log C)/2.

Wait, let me think. For a weak base B-:

B- + H2O ↔ BH + OH^-.

The expression is K_b = [BH][OH^-]/[B-].

Assuming x is small, [B-] ≈ C, so K_b ≈x²/(C) → x= sqrt(K_b * C).

So [OH^-]=sqrt(K_b * C).

pOH = ½ (pK_b - log C).

Wait, no, because pOH = -log [OH^-] = -log (sqrt(K_b * C)) ) = -0.5 * log (K_b * C) ) = 0.5 ( -log K_b - log C ) → pOH=0.5 ( -log K_b - log C ) → pOH=0.5 ( pK_b' - log C ), where pK_b' is -log K_b.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

pH = pK_b + log ( [B-] ) / ( [BH] )

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me try using the exact quadratic approach again but with K_b=1.8e-5.

So, with K_b=1.8e-5, the equation is:

x²/(0.1 - x) =1.8e-5.

Assuming x is small, 0.1 -x ≈0.1 → x²=1.8e-5 *0.1=1.8e-6 → x= ~0.001342 M.

So [OH-]=0.001342 → pOH=2.87 → pH=11.13. But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is E: pH=11.38, which is higher than 11.13. Maybe the approximation isn't accurate enough because x isn't that small. Let's see.

Using the quadratic equation:

x²/(0.1 -x) =1.8e-5 → x²=1.8e-5*(0.1 -x).

→ x²=1.8e-6 -1.8e-5 x.

→ x² +1.8e-5 x -1.8e-6=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-1.8e-5 ± sqrt( (1.8e-5)^2 +4*1*1.8e-6 ) ]/(2*1).

Calculate discriminant:

(1.8e-5)^2=3.24e-10.

4*1*1.8e-6=7.2e-6.

So D=3.24e-10 +7.2e-6=7.2000324e-6 ≈7.20003e-6.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(7.20003e-6)=approx 0.002683.

So x= [ -1.8e-5 +0.002683 ] /2 → (0.002683 -0.000018)/2 → 0.002665/2=0.0013325 M.

So [OH-]=0.0013325 → pOH=2.874 → pH=14-2.874=11.126.

Still around 11.13. So the pH is approximately 11.13, but the options don't have this. The closest is option E: pH=11.38, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that I've made a mistake in K_b. Let me try again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem intended K_diss as the dissociation of the acid, so K_a=1.8e-5, and K_b=K_w/K_a= (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e-1, as originally thought. But that gave a pH of ~12.94, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: pH=10.88, % hydro=0.85%.

Option D: pH=10.38, % hydro=0.65%.

Option E: pH=11.38, % hydro=0.95%.

Option G: pH=11.88, % hydro=0.85%.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try using K_b=5.555e-1 and see if any option fits.

Wait, but with K_b=5.555e-1, the quadratic solution gave [OH-]=0.0865 M, which is 86.5 mM. So pOH=1.063 → pH=12.937. None of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the setup. Maybe I shouldn't have used K_b=K_w/K_a, but perhaps it's the other way around. Oh wait, no. K_b is K_w / K_a.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing K_a and K_b. Let me think again: for a conjugate acid-base pair, K_a (acid) * K_b (base) = K_w.

So if K_a=1.8e-5, then K_b=K_w/K_a= (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e-1.

Wait, that's correct. So I'm confident that K_b=5.555e-1.

So the correct approach is to proceed with that K_b, leading to [OH-]=0.0865 M and pH=12.94, but that's not among the options. So perhaps the problem had a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the given constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the given K_diss is K_b, not K_a. Let me try assuming that K_diss=1.8e-5 is K_b.

So K_b=1.8e-5, K_a=K_w/K_b= (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e1=55.555.

Wait, that seems high for K_a, but let's proceed.

Then, the hydrolysis equation is:

C2H3O2^- + H2O ↔ HC2H3O2 + OH^-

K_b=1.8e-5.

So initial concentration of acetate is 0.1 M. Let x be [OH^-]=x.

At equilibrium, [C2H3O2^-]=0.1 -x, [HC2H3O2]=x, [OH^-]=x.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.1, so 0.1 -x ≈0.1.

Then K_b=x²/(0.1) → x²=1.8e-5 *0.1=1.8e-6 → x=sqrt(1.8e-6)= ~0.001342 M.

So [OH-]=0.001342 → pOH=2.87 → pH=11.13.

But again, this isn't matching any option. The closest option is E: pH=11.38, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the given K_diss is K_a, and K_b is calculated as K_w/K_a= (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e-1. So I'm back to the initial approach, which gives pH=12.94, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one makes sense based on typical calculations.

Wait, option B is pH=10.88, which is around pK_b + log(C). Wait, pK_b is -log(K_b)= -log(5.555e-1)= -(-0.255)=0.255? Wait, no, wait: K_b=5.555e-1=0.5555.

pK_b= -log(0.5555)= ~0.255.

So pH would be pK_b + log([B-]/[BH]) → but in this case, since it's a base, perhaps the pH is pK_b + log(C), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the pH of a weak base.

The formula is pH = (pK_b - log C)/2.

Wait, if K_b=5.555e-1 and C=0.1 M,

pK_b= -log(0.5555)=0.255.

So pH= (0.255 - (-1)) /2 → (0.255 +1)/2=1.255/2=0.6275. That can't be right because that's an acidic pH, but sodium acetate is a base.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. For weak bases, the pH is calculated as:

pOH = (pK_b + log C)/2 → pH=14 - (pK_b + log C)/2.

Wait, let's try that. pK_b=0.255, log C=log(0.1)= -1.

So pOH=(0.255 + (-1))/2= (-0.745)/2= -0.3725. That can't be right because pOH can't be negative.

Hmm, that approach isn't working. Maybe I should stick with the quadratic solution, even though it doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended K_a=1.8e-5 and K_w=1e-14, but the user provided K_w=1e-4. Let me try that.

If K_w=1e-14, then K_b= (1e-14)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e-10.

Then, K_b=5.555e-10.

So, the hydrolysis equation is:

x²/(0.1 -x)=5.555e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.1 -x≈0.1 → x²=5.555e-10 *0.1=5.555e-11 → x= sqrt(5.555e-11)= ~7.45e-6 M.

So [OH-]=7.45e-6 → pOH=5.13 → pH=8.87.

Looking at the options, option I is pH=8.88, which is very close. The percent hydrolysis would be (7.45e-6 /0.1)*100=0.00745%, which is about 0.0075%. But option I has 1.75% hydrolysis. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact quadratic:

x² +5.555e-10 x -5.555e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x=[-5.555e-10 ± sqrt( (5.555e-10)^2 +4*1*5.555e-11 ) ]/(2*1).

Compute discriminant:

(5.555e-10)^2=3.086e-19.

4*1*5.555e-11=2.222e-10.

So D=3.086e-19 +2.222e-10=2.222e-10 (since 3e-19 is negligible).

sqrt(D)=~4.714e-5.

So x=[ -5.555e-10 +4.714e-5 ] /2 → approx (4.714e-5)/2=2.357e-5 M.

[OH-]=2.357e-5 → pOH=4.627 → pH=9.373.

Looking at the options, option J is pH=9.38, which matches. The percent hydrolysis is (2.357e-5/0.1)*100=0.02357%, which is about 0.024%, but option J has 1.25% hydrolysis. So that's not matching either.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. It seems like none of the approaches are matching the options, which suggests I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express everything in terms of the given data. Let me try a different approach.

Given:

- 0.1 M NaC₂H₃O₂ → acetate ion concentration is 0.1 M.

- K_a for acetic acid =1.8e-5.

- K_w=1e-4.

We can find K_b for acetate as K_b= K_w/K_a= (1e-4)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e-1.

Now, the acetate ion reacts with water:

C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H₂O ↔ HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻.

Let x be the concentration of OH⁻ produced. So:

[OH^-]=x.

[HC₂H₃O₂]=x.

[C₂H₃O₂^-]=0.1 -x.

So K_b= x²/(0.1 -x)=5.555e-1.

Assuming x is not negligible, we can't neglect it. So solving the quadratic:

x² +5.555e-1 x -5.555e-2=0.

Wait, K_b= x²/(0.1-x)=0.5555 → x²=0.5555*(0.1 -x) → x²=0.05555 -0.5555 x → x² +0.5555 x -0.05555=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x=[-0.5555 ± sqrt( (0.5555)^2 +4*1*0.05555 )]/2.

Calculate discriminant:

0.5555²=0.3086.

4*0.05555=0.2222.

So D=0.3086+0.2222=0.5308.

sqrt(D)=~0.7286.

x= [ -0.5555 +0.7286 ] /2 → (0.1731)/2=0.08655 M.

So [OH-]=0.08655 M → pOH= -log(0.08655)=1.063 → pH=14-1.063=12.937.

Again, the same result. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem intended K_diss as K_a, but even then, the pH doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the answer options again. Option B is pH=10.88, which is about pK_b + log(C). Wait, if K_b=1.8e-5, then pK_b=4.74. log(0.1)= -1. So pH= pK_b + log(C) → 4.74 + (-1)=3.74, which doesn't make sense because it's acidic, but sodium acetate is a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is pH=14 - (pK_b - log C)/2.

Wait, let me try that. pK_b=4.74 (if K_b=1.8e-5).

So pH=14 - (4.74 - (-1))/2 → 14 - (5.74/2)=14-2.87=11.13.

Which is close to option E: pH=11.38, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is pOH= (pK_b + log C)/2.

So pOH=(4.74 + (-1))/2=3.74/2=1.87 → pH=14-1.87=12.13. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should just pick the option that's closest to my calculated pH when K_b=1.8e-5, which is pH=11.13. The closest option is E: pH=11.38, but that's 0.25 higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me try calculating using K_b=1.8e-5 and exact quadratic.

Equation: x² +1.8e-5 x -1.8e-6=0.

Solutions:

x = [ -1.8e-5 ± sqrt( (1.8e-5)^2 +4*1*1.8e-6 ) ]/(2).

Discriminant D= (3.24e-10) +7.2e-6=7.2000324e-6.

sqrt(D)= ~0.002683.

x=( -1.8e-5 +0.002683 )/2 → (0.002683-0.000018)/2=0.002665/2=0.0013325 M.

pOH= -log(0.0013325)=2.874 → pH=11.126.

So pH≈11.13. But option E is 11.38, which is higher. Maybe I should check if there's a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something, but that's beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is option B: pH=10.88, which would correspond to a different K_b.

Wait, perhaps let's try to find which option fits with the given K_b=5.555e-1.

Wait, if pH=10.88, then pOH=3.12 → [OH-]=7.78e-4 M.

Using K_b= [HC2H3O2][OH^-]/[C2H3O2^-]=x²/(0.1 -x)=5.555e-1.

So x= [OH-]=7.78e-4.

Then x²= (7.78e-4)^2≈6.05e-7.

So 6.05e-7 ≈5.555e-1*(0.1 -7.78e-4).

5.555e-1*(0.1 -0.000778)=5.555e-1 *0.099222≈0.05523.

But 6.05e-7 ≈0.000000605, which is much smaller than 0.05523. So that's not matching. So option B doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct pH when K_b=5.555e-1 is around 12.94, which isn't an option. When K_b=1.8e-5, the pH is around 11.13, which also isn't an option. The only option close to 11.13 is E: 11.38, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given K_w is 1e-14, and the problem had a typo. Let me try that quickly.

If K_w=1e-14, then K_b= (1e-14)/(1.8e-5)=5.555e-10.

Then, x²/(0.1)=5.555e-10 → x= sqrt(5.555e-11)=7.45e-6 M.

pOH=5.13 → pH=8.87. Closest option is I: 8.88, but percent hydrolysis is (7.45e-6/0.1)*100=0.00745%, which isn't listed.

Given all this, I'm probably making a mistake somewhere, but I can't figure it out right now. Among the options, perhaps the correct one is option B: pH=10.88, % hydro=0.85%, but I'm not confident.
</think>

The problem involves determining the pH and percent hydrolysis of a 0.1 M NaC₂H₃O₂ solution, given \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \) and \( K_{\text{diss}} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \). Sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na⁺ and C₂H₃O₂⁻, where the acetate ion undergoes hydrolysis:

\[
\text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2 + \text{OH}^-
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Identify Constants**:
   - \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \)
   - \( K_{\text{diss}} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), which is interpreted as \( K_a \) for acetic acid.

2. **Calculate \( K_b \) for Acetate**:
   Using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \):
   \[
   K_b = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-4}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.555 \times 10^{-1}
   \]

3. **Set Up the Hydrolysis Equation**:
   Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) at equilibrium:
   \[
   K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.1 - x}
   \]
   Solving this quadratic equation:
   \[
   x^2 + 0.5555x - 0.05555 = 0
   \]
   Using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-0.5555 + \sqrt{(0.5555)^2 + 4(0.05555)}}{2}
   \]
   The positive root gives \( x \approx 0.0865 \, \text{M} \), so \( [\text{OH}^-] = 0.0865 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH**:
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0865) \approx 1.063 \)
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - 1.063 \approx 12.937 \)

5. **Percent Hydrolysis**:
   \[
   \text{Percent Hydrolysis} = \frac{x}{0.1} \times 100 = \frac{0.0865}{0.1} \times 100 \approx 86.5\%
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- The calculated pH (\( \approx 12.94 \)) and percent hydrolysis (\( \approx 86.5\% \)) do not match any of the provided options.
- Assuming \( K_{\text{diss}} \) might instead represent \( K_b \), recalculating with \( K_b = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \):
  - \( K_a = \frac{K_w}{K_b} \approx 55.55 \)
  - Solving the hydrolysis equation with \( K_b = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \) gives \( [\text{OH}^-] \approx 0.001342 \, \text{M} \), leading to \( \text{pH} \approx 11.13 \).
  - Percent hydrolysis is \( \approx 1.34\% \), which also does not match any option.

### Conclusion:
The closest option to the calculated pH when \( K_b = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \) is **B: pH = 10.88, % Hydrolysis = 0.85%**, though the match is not exact. Given the provided options, **B** is the most reasonable choice.
