Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing and accounting principles. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about what an auditor should do when there's a change in accounting principles, but the effect on comparability isn't material. The options are A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that when accounting principles change, it's important to assess whether that change affects the comparability of the financial statements. If the effect is material, the auditor has to be more concerned because it could affect users' ability to compare the statements over time. But if it's not material, the approach might be different.

I think about the different types of audit opinions. A qualified opinion is when the auditor finds a significant issue but still thinks the financials are mostly accurate. Adverse opinion is when there's a major problem. But the question says the effect isn't material, so maybe the opinion doesn't need to be qualified or adverse.

Looking at the options, A suggests a qualified opinion. Since the effect is not material, I don't think a qualified opinion is necessary. E talks about an adverse opinion, which seems too strong for a non-material change.

Option B says refer to the note in the financial statements. I recall that changes in accounting principles are often disclosed in the notes. So the auditor might not need to mention it in their report if it's already there. But I'm not sure if the auditor has to explicitly state something or just rely on the notes.

Option C is about explicitly stating whether the change conforms with GAAP. I think the auditor should ensure that the change is in accordance with GAAP, but does that require a specific statement in the audit report? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option D suggests detailing the change in the notes. That sounds similar to B, but perhaps more involved. The question is about what the auditor should do, so if the client has already included it in the notes, maybe the auditor doesn't need to add more in the report.

Option F is about restating prior years. If the effect isn't material, restating might not be necessary. I think restatement is usually for material changes to maintain comparability.

Option G says to discontinue the audit. That doesn't make sense; a change in principles alone shouldn't stop the audit unless it's a major issue.

Option H says not to refer to the change in the auditor's report. If the change is properly disclosed in the notes, maybe the auditor doesn't need to mention it again. That could be a possibility.

Option I is about an emphasis-of-matter paragraph. I think that's used when the auditor wants to highlight something important, like a change in accounting principle, even if it's not material. But I'm not sure if that's necessary if the notes already cover it.

Option J requires the client to disclose in a separate financial statement, which seems extreme for a non-material change.

Putting this together, if the change isn't material, the auditor might not need to issue a qualified opinion. They might rely on the notes of the financial statements to disclose the change. So, the correct action would be to refer to the note in the financial statements, which is option B. Alternatively, if the change is properly handled in the notes, the auditor might not need to mention it in their report, which would be option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the auditor has a responsibility to consider whether the financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP. If there's a change, even if not material, the auditor should ensure it's properly disclosed. So maybe the answer is H, meaning the auditor doesn't need to refer to it in their report if it's already in the notes.

Alternatively, maybe the auditor should explicitly state in the report whether the change conforms with GAAP, which is option C. But I'm not sure if that's required for non-material changes.

I think the key here is that if the effect isn't material, the change is still something the auditor should note. But if it's properly disclosed in the notes, the auditor might not need to include it in their report. So perhaps the correct answer is H: Not refer to the change in the auditor’s report.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the auditor must assess the impact of the change. If it's not material, they might not need to issue a qualified opinion. They might also need to make sure the financial statements include the necessary disclosures. So, if the client has included the change in the notes, the auditor can refer to that in their report, which might be option I (emphasis-of-matter) or B (refer to the note).

But the question is about what the auditor should do. So if the change is in the notes, the auditor should mention that they've considered it, perhaps in the notes to the financial statements. Or maybe the auditor doesn't need to do anything beyond the standard procedures because it's non-material.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall the rules. According to auditing standards, when a change in accounting principle is made and it's not material, the auditor should ensure that the financial statements disclose the change and its effects. If the effects are not material, the prior year's statements might not need restatement, and the change can be disclosed in the notes.

So the auditor's report would typically include a reference to the notes, but unless there's a specific issue, they might not need to add a separate paragraph. Alternatively, if the change is properly disclosed, the auditor might not need to mention it in their report beyond the standard "see the notes" statement.

Wait, but option H says "Not refer to the change in the auditor’s report." So if the change is in the notes, the auditor doesn't need to refer to it in their report. That makes sense because the notes already cover it.

Alternatively, maybe the auditor should explicitly state whether the change is in accordance with GAAP, which is option C. But I'm not sure if that's required for non-material changes.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that if the effect isn't material, the auditor doesn't need to issue a qualified opinion. They should ensure the change is disclosed properly. If the client has done that in the notes, the auditor can rely on that and not mention it in their report.

So the correct answer would be H: Not refer to the change in the auditor’s report.
