Okay, so I'm faced with this multiple-choice question about electric and magnetic fields, and I need to figure out which statement is false. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again: "Which of the following statements about electric and magnetic fields is FALSE?" So my task is to find the incorrect statement among options A to J.

I'll go through each option one by one, analyzing each statement based on what I remember from physics.

Option A: "A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." Hmm, I know that the electric field direction is the direction a positive charge would move if it's free to do so. So that part seems correct. For the magnetic field part, the force on a moving charge is given by the Lorentz force law, F = q(v × B). If the charge is moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force would be maximum, causing it to move in a circular path, not along the field. Wait, no, the direction of motion is perpendicular to B, but the force is perpendicular to both v and B. So a positive charge moving perpendicular to B would experience a force perpendicular to its motion, making it curve. So the statement says it moves perpendicular to B. Wait, no, the motion is perpendicular, but the force direction is perpendicular to both. So the charge doesn't move along B, but its velocity is perpendicular to B. The statement seems correct because the charge's movement is perpendicular to B. So A might be correct.

Option B: "All charges experience a force in an electric field, but only moving charges can experience a force in a magnetic field." I remember that electric fields exert forces on all charges regardless of motion—yes, F = qE. For magnetic fields, F = q(v × B). So only moving charges (where v isn't zero) experience a magnetic force. So B is correct.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because in a magnetic field, only moving charges feel a force. So if a charge is stationary (v=0), F=0. So C is saying all charges feel a magnetic force, which is false because stationary charges don't. So C is incorrect. But I should check other options to make sure.

Option D: "A charge moving along the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving along the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." Electric force F = qE. If moving along E, the direction is same as E, so F is in that direction—charge experiences a force. For magnetic, if moving along B, then v is parallel to B. So v × B would be zero, so no force. So D is correct.

Option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, electric force is in the direction of E, regardless of motion. So if a charge is moving, the electric force could be in any direction relative to velocity, not necessarily parallel. Wait, no—if the charge is moving in any direction, the electric force is along E. So the statement says all moving charges experience a force parallel to E. That's correct because E's force is always along E. But wait, for magnetic fields, the force is perpendicular to B and v. So if a charge is moving along E, then the electric force is along E, and if the magnetic field is in some direction, the magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B. But the statement says the magnetic force is perpendicular, which is correct. So E might be correct. But wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The statement says both: force is parallel to E and perpendicular to B. So for any moving charge, electric force is along E, and magnetic force is perpendicular to B. So yes, E is correct.

Option F: "A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field." No, because F = q(v × B). If v=0, F=0. So F is incorrect. Wait, but earlier I thought C was incorrect. Wait, let me check again. So F says stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field. That's false because a stationary charge has v=0, so no force. So F is incorrect. But I thought earlier that C was incorrect. Let me proceed.

Option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, stationary charges in an electric field do experience a force along E. So that's correct. For magnetic fields, stationary charges have v=0, so F=0. So the statement says they experience a force perpendicular to B, which is zero force. So the statement is incorrect because stationary charges don't feel any magnetic force. So G is false.

Wait, let me clarify. The statement says all stationary charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B. But for stationary charges, the magnetic force is zero. So the statement is incorrect because it's claiming a force, but there's none. So G is false.

Wait, but I thought F was false as well. Let me see: F says a stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field. Which is false because they can't. So both F and G are incorrect? Hmm, but the question asks which is the false statement, so perhaps only one is the answer.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is to find the false statement.

Wait, let me go back.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." Wait, that's incorrect because in an electric field, all charges (moving or not) experience a force. So the second part of C is wrong. The first part says all charges feel a force in a magnetic field, which is wrong because only moving charges do. So C is incorrect.

Option F: "A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field." Which is incorrect because F=0. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, stationary charges in E do feel a force along E. So the first part is correct. The second part says they feel a force perpendicular to B, but since they're stationary, v=0, so F=0. So the statement is incorrect because they don't feel any magnetic force. So G is false.

Option H: "A charge moving perpendicular to the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." Hmm. Electric field: F = qE, so regardless of the direction of movement, the force is along E. So moving perpendicular to E would mean the velocity is perpendicular, but the force is still along E. So the charge experiences a force. For the magnetic part, if moving perpendicular to B, then v is perpendicular to B. So F = q(v × B) would be perpendicular to both, which means the force is in the plane perpendicular to both v and B. So the charge does experience a force. Therefore, H's statement is incorrect because it says a charge moving perpendicular to B won't experience a force, which is wrong. So H is false.

Option I: "Electric and magnetic fields do not interact with each other." I know that in reality, they are related; changing electric fields produce magnetic fields and vice versa, as per Maxwell's equations. So I is false.

Option J: "A negative charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a negative charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, in an electric field, a negative charge moves opposite to E. So J's first part is incorrect. The second part, moving perpendicular to B: the force is perpendicular to both v and B, so the charge would experience a force, causing it to move in a circular path, but the statement says it moves perpendicular to B. Wait, the direction of movement is perpendicular to B. So J's statement is correct about the magnetic part. But the first part is wrong because a negative charge moves opposite to E. So J is false because the first part is incorrect.

Wait, but let me recheck each option.

So, the options I'm considering as possibly false are: C, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, let's make a list:

A: Correct.

B: Correct.

C: Incorrect because not all charges feel a magnetic force (only moving ones). So C is false.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Incorrect; stationary charges don't feel magnetic force.

G: Incorrect; stationary charges don't feel any magnetic force, so the second part is wrong.

H: Incorrect; moving perpendicular to B does result in a force.

I: Incorrect; fields do interact.

J: Incorrect; negative charge moves opposite to E.

Wait, but the question is to pick the false statement. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The question is to find the FALSE statement.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." So the first part is incorrect because only moving charges feel a magnetic force. The second part is correct because all charges (moving or not) feel electric force. So C is false.

Option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, the electric force is along E, so moving charges do experience a force along E. The magnetic force is always perpendicular to B and v. So E is correct.

Option F: "A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field." No, because F=0. So F is false.

Option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Stationary charges do feel electric force along E, so that's correct. But they don't feel any magnetic force, so the second part is incorrect. So G is false.

Option H: "A charge moving perpendicular to the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." The first part is correct because electric force is along E. The second part is incorrect because moving perpendicular to B does result in a force. So H is false.

Option I: "Electric and magnetic fields do not interact with each other." This is false because they do interact, as per Maxwell's equations.

Option J: "A negative charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a negative charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." The first part is wrong because negative charges move opposite to E. The second part is correct. So J is false.

So, which of these is the correct answer? The question asks which statement is FALSE. So all except the correct options are false, but the answer is the one that's presented as false.

Wait, but the options are A-J, and only one is the correct answer. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis. Let me try to find which one is the false statement.

Wait, the question is to choose the FALSE statement. So I need to find which option is incorrect.

Let me go back and check each option again.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." The first part is wrong. Only moving charges feel a magnetic force. So C is incorrect.

Option F: "A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field." Wrong, because it can't. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." The first part is correct (they feel electric force), but the second part is wrong (they feel no magnetic force). So G is incorrect.

Option H: "A charge moving perpendicular to the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." The first part is correct, the second part is wrong. So H is incorrect.

Option I: "Electric and magnetic fields do not interact with each other." Incorrect, because they do interact. So I is incorrect.

Option J: "A negative charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a negative charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." The first part is wrong (it moves opposite to E). The second part is correct. So J is incorrect.

So now I'm a bit confused because several options seem incorrect. But the question expects only one correct answer. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating some options. Let me check each one carefully.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." The first part is wrong. So C is false.

Option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Electric force is along E, correct. Magnetic force is perpendicular to B and v, correct. So E is correct.

Option F: "A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field." No, F is zero. So F is false.

Option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." They do feel electric force (correct), but no magnetic force. So the second part is wrong. So G is false.

Option H: "A charge moving perpendicular to the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." Moving perpendicular to E still feels electric force (correct). Moving perpendicular to B does feel magnetic force (so second part is wrong). So H is false.

Option I: "Electric and magnetic fields do not interact with each other." False, as they do interact. So I is false.

Option J: "A negative charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a negative charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." The first part is wrong, the second correct. So J is false.

But the question is to find the FALSE statement, so all these options (C, F, G, H, I, J) are false. But that can't be right because the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding some options.

Let me try to see which option is definitely false.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the statement says all charges feel magnetic force, which is wrong. Only moving charges do. So C is false.

Another option is E. Let me think again about E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." So moving charges in an electric field feel F along E, which is correct. In a magnetic field, the force is perpendicular to both v and B. So if a charge is moving in any direction, the magnetic force is perpendicular to B. So E's statement about the magnetic force being perpendicular is correct. So E is correct.

Wait, but the first part of E says "parallel to an electric field." So if a moving charge is in an electric field, the force is along E, which is correct. So E is correct.

So perhaps the false statement is option C, F, G, H, I, or J.

But given the options, the most likely answer is option C, because it incorrectly states that all charges feel a magnetic force.

Alternatively, option G says all stationary charges experience a force in the magnetic field, which they don't. So G is incorrect.

Wait, option G says: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." So for stationary charges, the magnetic force is zero. So the statement is incorrect because the second part is wrong. So G is false.

But wait, the first part is correct: stationary charges do feel electric force along E. So G is partially correct but wrong in the second part. So G is false.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option again.

The options are:

A: Correct.

B: Correct.

C: False.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: False.

G: False.

H: False.

I: False.

J: False.

But the question expects only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps option E is correct, but let me think: All moving charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B. So for E, the electric part is correct, and the magnetic part is correct. So E is correct.

Wait, but the magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B, not necessarily the direction of B. So if a charge is moving in any direction, the magnetic force is perpendicular to B and v. So E's statement is correct.

So perhaps the false statements are C, F, G, H, I, J.

But the question has only one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps option H is correct. Let me check H again.

Option H: "A charge moving perpendicular to the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." The first part is correct: moving perpendicular to E still feels electric force along E. The second part is wrong because moving perpendicular to B does feel a magnetic force. So H is false.

Similarly, option I is definitely false because electric and magnetic fields do interact.

But the question is about which is the FALSE statement, so the correct answer is the one that is wrong.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which claims all charges feel a magnetic force, which is false.

Alternatively, option F is false because stationary charges can't feel magnetic force.

But perhaps the question is designed to have only one false statement. Let me think again.

Wait, the original question is from a multiple-choice exam, so the answer is likely one of the options. I think the most obvious false statement is option C, because it's saying all charges feel a magnetic force, which is incorrect.

Another possibility is option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Since stationary charges don't feel any magnetic force, the second part is wrong. So G is false.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find the answer quickly.

The answer is option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." The first part is wrong, so C is the false statement.
</think>

The question asks which statement about electric and magnetic fields is false. After analyzing each option, the key points are as follows:

- **Option C** is false because it incorrectly claims that all charges experience a force in a magnetic field. In reality, only moving charges experience a magnetic force.
- **Option F** is false because stationary charges do not experience a magnetic force.
- **Option G** is false because stationary charges do not experience any magnetic force, making the second part of the statement incorrect.
- **Option H** is false because moving perpendicular to a magnetic field does result in a force.
- **Option I** is false because electric and magnetic fields do interact with each other.
- **Option J** is false because a negative charge moves opposite to the electric field, not in the direction of it.

However, the most direct and clear false statement is **Option C**, as it explicitly contradicts the principle that only moving charges experience a magnetic force.

**Answer: C**
