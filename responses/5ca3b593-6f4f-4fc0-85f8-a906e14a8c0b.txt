Question:

When the atria contract, only 30% of the ventricular space becomes filled. How does the additional 70% become filled? Describe the process of the cardiac cycle in general.

Options:

A: Ventricular filling is achieved through nervous stimulation.
B: 70% of the ventricular filling occurs during diastole due to passive flow as the atrial pressure is greater than the ventricular pressure.
C: The additional 70% is filled by the gravitational force when the body is in a specific position.
D: The remaining ventricular space is filled by pulmonary backflow during inhalation.
E: Ventricular filling is supplemented by the contraction of auxiliary heart chambers.
F: Ventricular filling is completed by muscular constriction of the ventricles.
G: Ventricular filling for the remaining 70% is regulated by hormonal changes during the cardiac cycle.
H: Ventricular filling occurs during systole due to active flow.
I: The remaining 70% of ventricular filling is due to contraction of the atria.
J: The last 70% of ventricular filling is aided by the opening and closing of the semilunar valves.

Okay, so I have this question about the cardiac cycle, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question says that when the atria contract, only 30% of the ventricular space becomes filled. Then it asks how the remaining 70% is filled and to describe the process of the cardiac cycle in general.

Hmm, I remember that the heart has a cycle with two main phases: systole and diastole. Systole is when the heart muscles contract, and diastole is when they relax. 

So during the cardiac cycle, the atria contract first, which is part of atrial systole. When the atria contract, they push blood into the ventricles. But this only fills about 30% of the ventricles. I think the rest must happen when the ventricles start to contract, but wait, no, the ventricles are still in diastole at that point.

Wait, during the cardiac cycle, after the atria contract, the ventricles are in their diastole phase. So when the ventricles are relaxed, they start to fill more. I think this is called ventricular diastole. So during this time, the ventricles passively fill because the pressure in the atria is higher than in the ventricles, right? So as the atria contract, they push blood into the ventricles, and when the atria relax, the ventricles continue to fill because the pressure gradient allows more blood to flow in.

So the 70% must come from the ventricles filling passively during this phase. That would mean that during diastole, when the ventricles are relaxed, blood flows in because the atrial pressure is higher than the ventricular pressure. So the additional 70% is due to passive flow during diastole.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Nervous stimulation. I don't think so. The filling is passive, not due to nerves.

Option B: 70% during diastole due to passive flow because atrial pressure is greater. This sounds right because when the atria contract, they push blood into the ventricles, and during diastole, the ventricles relax, allowing more blood to flow in as the atrial pressure is higher.

Option C: Gravitational force. That's probably not the case unless the body is in a specific position, but the question doesn't mention that, so I don't think this is the general answer.

Option D: Pulmonary backflow during inhalation. I'm not sure, but I think that's related to the flow during breathing, but not the main reason for ventricular filling.

Option E: Auxiliary heart chambers. I don't think humans have auxiliary chambers; maybe some animals do, but not us.

Option F: Muscular constriction. That would be during systole, but the filling is during diastole.

Option G: Hormonal regulation. I don't recall hormones playing a role in immediate ventricular filling.

Option H: Filling during systole due to active flow. No, because during systole, the ventricles are contracting, which would eject blood, not fill.

Option I: Atrial contraction again. Wait, the 30% is from atrial contraction. The question says the atria contract and fill 30%, so the remaining 70% isn't from the atria.

Option J: Semilunar valves opening and closing. That's more about ejection, not filling. The semilunar valves open during systole when the ventricles contract and push blood into the arteries.

So the correct answer should be option B. It explains that the additional 70% is filled passively during diastole because the atrial pressure is higher than the ventricular pressure, allowing blood to flow in when the ventricles are relaxed.

The correct answer is B. During diastole, the ventricles relax, and the atrial pressure being higher than the ventricular pressure allows for passive flow, filling the remaining 70% of the ventricular space.

Answer: B
