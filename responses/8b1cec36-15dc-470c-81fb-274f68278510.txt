Okay, so I need to figure out the molarity of a sulfuric acid solution. Hmm, let me start by recalling what molarity is. Molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution, right? So I'll need to find the number of moles of H2SO4 and then divide that by the volume in liters.

The problem gives me 10.0 grams of sulfuric acid. Oh wait, the molecular weight (MW) is provided as 98.1 g/mol. So I can calculate moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight.

Let me jot that down. Moles = mass / MW. So that's 10.0 grams divided by 98.1 g/mol. Let me do that division. 10 divided by 98.1 is approximately 0.1019 moles. Rounded to three significant figures, that would be 0.102 moles.

Next, I need to consider the volume of the solution. The volume given is 500 ml, which is 0.5 liters. So to find molarity, I divide the moles by the volume in liters.

Molarity = moles / liters. So that's 0.102 moles divided by 0.5 liters. Let me calculate that: 0.102 / 0.5 equals 0.204 M. Wait, no, wait a second. 0.102 divided by 0.5 is actually 0.204? Let me check the math again. Oh, because 0.5 goes into 0.102 twice, 0.102 * 2 is 0.204. So yeah, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.204 M. So that should be the right answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 10 grams divided by 98.1 is about 0.1019, which is 0.102 moles. Divided by 0.5 liters gives 0.204 M. Yep, that looks right.

To calculate the molarity of the sulfuric acid solution:

1. **Determine the moles of H₂SO₄**:  
   Moles = mass / molecular weight = 10.0 g / 98.1 g/mol ≈ 0.1019 mol ≈ 0.102 mol.

2. **Convert the volume to liters**:  
   500 mL = 0.5 L.

3. **Calculate molarity**:  
   Molarity = moles / liters = 0.102 mol / 0.5 L = 0.204 M.

The correct answer is **A: 0.204 M**.
