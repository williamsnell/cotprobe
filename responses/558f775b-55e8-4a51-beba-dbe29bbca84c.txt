Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the root mean square (rms) speed of gases. I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the rms speed of hydrogen (H₂) at a fixed temperature T is 1600 m/s. I need to find the rms speed of oxygen (O₂) at the same temperature. The options are A to J, so I'll figure out the right one.

First, I remember that the rms speed of a gas depends on its molar mass and the temperature. The formula for rms speed is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass of the gas.

Since the temperature is the same for both gases, the ratio of their rms speeds should depend on the square roots of their molar masses. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is proportional to sqrt(1/M), right? So higher molar mass means lower rms speed.

Hydrogen has a much lower molar mass than oxygen. Let me get the molar masses straight. Hydrogen (H₂) has a molar mass of about 2 grams per mole (since each H atom is 1 g/mol and there are two). Oxygen (O₂) has a molar mass of 32 g/mol because each O atom is 16 g/mol and there are two.

So the molar mass of H₂ is 2 g/mol, and for O₂ it's 32 g/mol. Now, since temperature is the same, the ratio of their rms speeds would be sqrt(M_H / M_O), because v_rms is proportional to sqrt(1/M). So v_H / v_O = sqrt(M_O / M_H)?

Wait no, let me correct that. The formula for rms speed is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), so when comparing two gases at the same T, v1/v2 = sqrt(M2/M1). Because v is inversely proportional to sqrt(M), so if M2 is larger, v2 is smaller.

So in this case, v_H is 1600 m/s, and I need to find v_O. Let me set up the ratio:

v_H / v_O = sqrt(M_O / M_H)

Because v is proportional to sqrt(1/M), so v_H is sqrt(3RT/M_H) and v_O is sqrt(3RT/M_O). So their ratio would be sqrt(M_O / M_H).

Wait, no: Let me think again. Oh right, because v_rms is proportional to 1/sqrt(M). So if I have two gases, A and B, then (v_A)/(v_B) = sqrt(M_B / M_A).

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. Let me denote v_H as the rms speed of hydrogen, and v_O as that of oxygen.

v_H = sqrt(3RT/M_H)
v_O = sqrt(3RT/M_O)

So the ratio v_H / v_O = sqrt( (3RT/M_H) ) / sqrt( (3RT/M_O) )

Simplify that: sqrt( (M_O)/(M_H) ) because when you divide the two, the 3RT cancels out, and you have sqrt(M_O/M_H).

So v_H / v_O = sqrt(M_O / M_H )

We can rearrange this to find v_O: v_O = v_H * sqrt(M_H / M_O )

So plugging in the numbers: M_H is 2 g/mol, M_O is 32 g/mol.

So M_H / M_O = 2/32 = 1/16.

So sqrt(1/16) is 1/4.

So v_O = v_H * (1/4) = 1600 m/s * 1/4 = 400 m/s.

Wait, that would make the answer 400 m/s, which is option A. But wait, is that right? Because oxygen is much heavier, so its rms speed should be much lower than hydrogen's. Let me double-check.

Hydrogen's rms speed is 1600 m/s, which is quite high because it's a light gas. Oxygen, being much heavier, should have a lower speed. So 400 m/s makes sense. But wait another thing: I might have made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, let's re-express the formula correctly. The rms speed is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M). So if M doubles, v_rms decreases by sqrt(2). In this case, M for O₂ is 16 times that of H₂ (since 32/2 =16). So the sqrt(16)=4, so v_rms of O₂ is 1600 /4=400 m/s.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be A:400 m/s.

The root mean square (rms) speed of a gas is given by the formula \( v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \), where \( M \) is the molar mass of the gas. Since the temperature \( T \) is constant for both hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂), the ratio of their rms speeds depends on the square root of the inverse of their molar masses. 

For hydrogen, \( M_{\text{H}_2} = 2 \, \text{g/mol} \), and for oxygen, \( M_{\text{O}_2} = 32 \, \text{g/mol} \). The ratio of their rms speeds is:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{H}_2}}{v_{\text{O}_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{O}_2}}{M_{\text{H}_2}}}
\]

Substituting the molar masses:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{H}_2}}{v_{\text{O}_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{32}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( v_{\text{O}_2} \):

\[
v_{\text{O}_2} = \frac{v_{\text{H}_2}}{4} = \frac{1600}{4} = 400 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the rms speed of oxygen at the same temperature is 400 m/s.
