Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation, and I need to figure out the book value of the tiger cage after three years using the declining balance method. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the declining balance method is a type of accelerated depreciation where the depreciation rate is applied to the book value of the asset each year. Unlike straight-line depreciation, which uses a fixed amount each year, the declining balance uses a percentage of the current value.

The formula for calculating the book value each year is: 
Book Value = Original Cost Ã— (1 - Depreciation Rate)^Number of Years

Wait, or is it that each year, the book value is reduced by the depreciation, so it's a bit more involved. Oh right, because each year the depreciation is calculated on the current book value, not the original cost.

The original cost of the cage is $1,950. The depreciation rate is 15% per year. So each year, the book value will be multiplied by (1 - 0.15) which is 0.85.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Year 1**: Depreciation = 15% of $1,950. Let me calculate that. 15% of 1950 is 0.15 * 1950. Hmm, 10% is 195, 5% is 97.5, so 195 +97.5= 292.5. So depreciation is $292.50. Subtract that from original cost: 1950 - 292.5 = 1657.50.

2. **Year 2**: Now, the book value is $1,657.50. Applying 15% depreciation: 15% of 1657.50. Let's compute 0.15 * 1657.50. 10% is 165.75, 5% is 82.875. So 165.75 +82.875=248.625. So depreciation is $248.625. Subtracting from the book value: 1657.50 - 248.625 = 1408.875.

3. **Year 3**: Now, the book value is $1,408.875. Applying 15% depreciation: 0.15 * 1408.875. Let me compute that. 10% is 140.8875, 5% is 70.44375. So 140.8875 +70.44375=211.33125. So depreciation is $211.33125. Subtracting from the book value: 1408.875 - 211.33125 = 1197.54375.

Hmm, so after three years, the book value is approximately $1,197.54. Looking at the options, option C is $1,197.54.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Let me recalculate each step more accurately.

Year 1:
Depreciation = 15% of 1950 = 1950 * 0.15 = 292.50.
Book Value after Year 1: 1950 - 292.50 = 1657.50.

Year 2:
Depreciation = 15% of 1657.50. 1657.50 * 0.15.
Let me compute 1657.50 * 0.15:
1657.50 * 0.1 = 165.75,
1657.50 * 0.05 = 82.875,
Adding together: 165.75 +82.875 = 248.625.
Book Value after Year 2: 1657.50 -248.625 = 1408.875.

Year 3:
Depreciation =15% of 1408.875.
Compute 1408.875 * 0.15.
1408.875 *0.1 =140.8875,
1408.875 *0.05=70.44375,
Adding: 140.8875 +70.44375 = 211.33125.
Book Value after Year 3: 1408.875 -211.33125 = 1197.54375.

Which is approximately $1,197.54 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Looking at the options, option C is $1,197.54, so that must be the correct answer.

The book value of the tiger cage after 3 years using the declining balance method is calculated as follows:

- **Year 1**: Depreciation = 15% of $1,950 = $292.50.  
  Book Value after Year 1 = $1,950 - $292.50 = $1,657.50.

- **Year 2**: Depreciation = 15% of $1,657.50 = $248.625.  
  Book Value after Year 2 = $1,657.50 - $248.625 = $1,408.875.

- **Year 3**: Depreciation = 15% of $1,408.875 = $211.33125.  
  Book Value after Year 3 = $1,408.875 - $211.33125 = $1,197.54375.

Rounded to the nearest cent, the book value is $1,197.54.

**ANSWER: C**
