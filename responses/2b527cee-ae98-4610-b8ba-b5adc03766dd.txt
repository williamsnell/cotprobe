Options:

A: Infants are only capable of learning through direct reinforcement.

C: Infants learn primarily through imitation of adult behavior from birth.
D: Infants learn exclusively through observation and do not require interaction.
E: Infants have the ability to learn abstract concepts within the first few months of life.
F: Infants cannot learn until they are capable of reaching and exploring their environment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what infants are capable of learning. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I need to think it through carefully.

The question is asking about the learning capabilities of infants. The options are A to J. Let me go through each option one by one to understand them better.

Option A says infants are only capable of learning through direct reinforcement. Hmm, direct reinforcement would be like when a baby learns because they get a reward each time they do something. I remember that reinforcement is a key concept in behaviorism, where desired behaviors are repeated because they are rewarded. But I'm not sure if infants only learn through this. Maybe they also learn other ways, like through imitation or exploration.

Option B: Infants learn behaviors which are life maintaining and those which provide them with the opportunity to explore their environment. This sounds plausible. Life-sustaining behaviors, like eating or sleeping, are essential. Also, exploring their environment is a big part of infant development. They learn to reach for objects, crawl, etc., which helps them explore. So B seems like a good candidate.

Option C states infants learn primarily through imitation of adult behavior from birth. I know that imitation is a key aspect of learning in infants, especially in the first year. But do they start from birth? I think newborns can imitate facial expressions almost immediately, but is it the primary way they learn? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the only way. So C could be a contender, but I'm not certain yet.

Option D says infants learn exclusively through observation and don't require interaction. That doesn't sound right. Infants definitely interact a lot, like through crying, cooing, reaching for things. They need interaction to learn, so D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Infants can learn abstract concepts within the first few months. Abstract concepts seem complex. I think infants can recognize patterns and maybe some object permanence, but abstract concepts like math or language might come later. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Infants cannot learn until they can reach and explore their environment. That doesn't make sense because even before they can reach, they're learning through other means, like listening, watching, and responding to sounds. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Infants can only learn after they develop language skills. No, that's not true. Babies learn before they can talk, like through motor skills, recognizing faces, and understanding cause and effect. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Infants are incapable of responding to secondary reinforcers. Secondary reinforcers are things like praise or tokens. I think infants do respond to these, even if they don't understand the words yet. They might learn to smile when spoken to, which is a form of responding to a secondary reinforcer. So H is likely wrong.

Option I: Infants only learn through classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is about associations, like the famous Pavlov's experiment. While infants do form associations, like learning to associate a bottle with feeding, they also learn through other methods like operant conditioning and imitation. So I is too restrictive.

Option J: Infants are born with all the knowledge and don't need to learn. That's definitely not true. Infants develop and learn throughout their early years, so J is incorrect.

Now, going back to the options. The question is about the learning infants are capable of. Option B talks about life-sustaining behaviors and exploration. Option C is about imitation, which is a big part, but maybe not the primary. Option B seems broader, covering both survival needs and exploration, which are fundamental learning aspects for infants.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B: Infants learn behaviors which are life maintaining and those which provide them with the opportunity to explore their environment.

Answer: B
