Question:

Ricardo's theory of distribution assumed that the supply of land was fixed, while the country's population and cap-ital stock were constantly increasing. On the basis of these assumptions, he predicted eventual stagnation of the economy. How would this happen according to Ricardo?

Options:

A: The increasing population results in a surplus of land.
B: Landlords decrease rent prices to encourage more farming, leading to an economic boom.
C: The increasing population leads to increased demand for land, which eventually leads to a decline in profits, resulting in economic stagnation and decline.
D: The fixed supply of land has no impact on the economy, as technological advancements ensure sustained productivity.
E: Capital stock diminishes over time, leading to a reduction in the workforce and a stagnant economy.
F: The constant increase in capital stock leads to a technological revolution that offsets any negative effects of a fixed supply of land.
G: Landlords invest their incomes leading to economic growth.
H: The fixed supply of land leads to increased innovation in agriculture, which results in perpetual economic expansion.
I: The fixed supply of land leads to a decrease in demand.
J: The increasing population leads to a decrease in wages, which in turn increases the overall savings and investment, resulting in economic growth.

Okay, I need to figure out how Ricardo's theory of distribution leads to economic stagnation based on the given assumptions. So, Ricardo's theory assumes that the supply of land is fixed. That means the amount of land available doesn't change over time. Meanwhile, the country's population and capital stock are both increasing. 

I remember Ricardo talked about the diminishing returns from land. As more people and more capital are used on a fixed land supply, each additional unit of labor or capital adds less to production. This could lead to lower profits for those who own the land. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Increasing population results in surplus land. That doesn't make sense because if population increases, demand for land would go up, not surplus. So A is likely wrong.

Option B: Landlords decrease rent to encourage farming, leading to a boom. Ricardo's theory isn't about landlords lowering rents; instead, rents might rise because land is scarce. So B seems incorrect.

Option C: Population increase leads to higher demand for land, causing a decline in profits and stagnation. This sounds plausible because with fixed land and more people, each unit of land becomes more valuable, so landlords can raise rents. This would eat into profits, especially for laborers, leading to lower investment and economic stagnation. C seems correct.

Option D: Fixed land has no impact because tech keeps things productive. Ricardo's theory doesn't rely on technology; it's more about the fixed resource. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Capital stock diminishes. But the question says capital is increasing, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Capital increase leads to tech revolution offsetting land issues. Again, Ricardo's model doesn't consider tech advancements as a mitigating factor. So F is likely wrong.

Option G: Landlords invest incomes leading to growth. Ricardo's theory focuses more on how landlords' increased rents reduce profits for others, leading to stagnation, not necessarily growth through investment. So G might not be the right choice.

Option H: Innovation in agriculture leads to perpetual expansion. Ricardo's theory doesn't emphasize innovation as a solution; it's more about the fixed land leading to problems. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: Fixed land leads to decreased demand. That doesn't align with Ricardo's idea of increasing population and demand for land. So I is wrong.

Option J: Population increase leads to lower wages and higher savings, causing growth. But Ricardo would argue that lower wages (due to land scarcity) would reduce the incentive to invest, leading to stagnation, not growth. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be C. Ricardo predicted that as population and capital grow with a fixed land supply, the demand for land would rise, leading to higher rents and a decline in profits, resulting in economic stagnation.

The correct answer is C. Ricardo's theory posits that with a fixed land supply and increasing population and capital, demand for land rises, leading to higher rents and declining profits, causing economic stagnation.

Answer: C
