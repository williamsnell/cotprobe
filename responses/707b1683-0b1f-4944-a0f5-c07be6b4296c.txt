Question:

Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?

Options:

A: 608
B: 960
C: 2321
D: 211
E: 500
F: 512
G: 11
H: 1000
I: 2048
J: 150

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Anton has two species of ants, A and B. On Day 0, the total number of ants is 30. By Day 5, it's 3281. We need to find how many are Species A on Day 5.

First, I need to model the growth of each species. The problem says Species A doubles every day, and Species B triples every day. So, let's denote the number of Species A on Day 0 as A₀ and Species B as B₀.

So, on Day 0, A₀ + B₀ = 30.

On Day 5, the number of A will be A₀ * 2^5, and B will be B₀ * 3^5. The total on Day 5 is 3281.

So, the equations are:
1. A₀ + B₀ = 30
2. (A₀ * 32) + (B₀ * 243) = 3281

Because 2^5 is 32 and 3^5 is 243.

Now, let's substitute. From equation 1, B₀ = 30 - A₀. Plug that into equation 2.

32A₀ + 243*(30 - A₀) = 3281.

Let me compute that:

32A₀ + 243*30 - 243A₀ = 3281

Calculate 243*30: 243 * 30 is 7290.

So, 32A₀ + 7290 - 243A₀ = 3281.

Combine like terms: (32A₀ - 243A₀) + 7290 = 3281.

That's (-211A₀) + 7290 = 3281.

Subtract 7290 from both sides: -211A₀ = 3281 - 7290.

3281 - 7290 is ... Let's see, 7290 - 3281 = 4009, so it's -4009.

So, -211A₀ = -4009.

Divide both sides by -211: A₀ = (-4009)/(-211) = 4009/211.

Let me compute 211 * 19 = 211*20=4220 minus 211=4009. So 211*19=4009. So A₀=19.

So, on Day 0, Species A was 19, Species B was 11 (since 30-19=11).

Now, on Day 5, Species A is 19 * 32 = 608.

Wait, 19*32: 20*32=640, minus 1*32=32, so 608.

So the answer should be 608, which is option A.

The number of Species A on Day 5 is calculated by finding the initial count of A (19) and multiplying by 2^5 (32), resulting in 608.

A: 608
