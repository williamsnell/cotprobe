Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative. I remember that Kant talked a lot about treating humanity as an end in itself, not just a means to an end. The question is asking about the two very general goals we're obligated to adopt under this principle.

The first goal mentioned in the question is promoting the morally permissible ends of others. That makes sense because Kant emphasizes that we should respect others' autonomy and help them achieve their own goals, as long as those goals are moral.

Now, the second part is where I need to think. The options are A through I. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: increasing social status. That doesn't seem right. Kant's ideas are more about moral imperatives, not about social climbing. Plus, increasing status is more of a personal goal and might not be universally applicable.

Option B: self-perfection. I'm not sure. Kant does talk about the moral law within, but self-perfection might be more about personal development. I'm not certain if this is the second goal here.

Option C: achieving inner peace. That sounds more like a personal state of mind, maybe related to happiness, but I don't think that's directly tied to Kant's imperative. The imperative is about actions and duties, not inner states.

Option D: achieving personal goals. Hmm, this is similar to promoting others' ends, but the wording is different. The question specifies "others" for the first goal, so maybe this isn't the right fit.

Option E: promoting social harmony. That could be a result of following Kant's principles, but I'm not sure if it's a direct goal. It seems more like a byproduct rather than an obligation.

Option F: self-sacrifice. That might be an extreme interpretation. Kant is about acting from duty, but self-sacrifice might not be necessary unless it's required by the moral law.

Option G: maximizing personal benefits. Definitely not, because that would be a self-centered approach, which Kant would oppose. The categorical imperative is about universalizing maxims, not personal gain.

Option H: producing happiness. While Kant does discuss happiness in some contexts, the categorical imperative is more about duties and respect for humanity, not directly about producing happiness as a goal.

Option I: attaining moral superiority. That sounds like a personal achievement, but Kant's focus is on the duty to act morally, not on attaining superiority over others.

Wait, I think I remember that in Kant's formulations, the Humanity formulation leads us to treat humanity as an end in itself, which includes both respecting others' ends and also self-improvement or self-perfection as a way to fulfill one's own moral duty. So maybe option B, self-perfection, is the second goal. Because promoting others' ends and also striving to perfect oneself morally are the two sides of the imperative.

Alternatively, sometimes Kant's imperative is phrased as two principles: one about helping others and one about self-improvement. So I think the answer is B: self-perfection.

The correct answer is B: self-perfection. Kant's Humanity formulation of the categorical imperative obligates us to respect the moral ends of others and to strive for self-perfection, ensuring that our actions are guided by a sense of duty and moral law.

Answer: B
