Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and potential differences. Hmm, I remember that electric fields are related to electric potential, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think through this.

The problem says that the electric field varies with the radius r from the origin by the equation Er = -6r² + 4r + 3. And I need to find the potential difference between the origin (which is r=0) and the point (3,4). Wait, the point (3,4) doesn't specify r, but since it's given in 2D, I think I should find the distance from the origin to that point. Right, because electric field here depends on the radial distance, so r is the magnitude of the position vector.

So first, I need to find the value of r for the point (3,4). The distance from the origin is the square root of (3² + 4²) which is sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5 meters. So r goes from 0 to 5 meters.

I recall that the potential difference V between two points is given by the integral of the electric field from the initial point to the final point. The formula is V = -∫ E · dr from r_initial to r_final. Since the electric field is radial and the path is along the radius, I can treat this as a one-dimensional integral. So E is in the radial direction, and dr is also radial. Therefore, the dot product simplifies to just E times dr.

Wait, but wait, electric field E is a vector, but in this problem, Er is given as a function of r, so I think it's already the radial component. So the integral becomes the integral of E(r) dr from r=0 to r=5.

So the potential difference V is the integral from 0 to 5 of E(r) dr, but with a negative sign. So V = - ∫ (from 0 to 5) [ -6r² +4r +3 ] dr.

Let me compute that integral step by step.

First, integrate term by term:

The integral of -6r² dr is (-6)*(r³/3) = -2r³.

The integral of 4r dr is 4*(r²/2) = 2r².

The integral of 3 dr is 3r.

So putting it all together, the integral from 0 to 5 is [ -2r³ + 2r² + 3r ] evaluated from 0 to 5.

Now plugging in r=5:

-2*(125) + 2*(25) + 3*(5) = -250 +50 +15 = (-250 +65) = -185.

At r=0, all terms are zero. So the integral from 0 to5 is -185 - 0 = -185.

Then, the potential difference V is the negative of this integral. So V = - (-185) = +185 V.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the signs. The formula is V = - ∫ E · dr. So the integral of E(r) dr from 0 to5 is -185, so V = - (-185) = +185 V.

Looking at the options, option B is 185 V. So the potential difference is 185 V.

Wait, but wait, another way to think: the potential difference is the work done per unit charge against the field. So if the integral gives a negative value, the potential change is positive. Let me make sure I did the integration correctly.

Wait, let me recalculate the integral:

E(r) = -6r² +4r +3.

Integral from 0 to5:

∫ E(r) dr = ∫ (-6r² +4r +3) dr from 0 to5.

Compute each term:

∫-6r² dr = (-6)*(r³/3) = -2r³.

∫4r dr = 4*(r²/2) = 2r².

∫3 dr =3r.

So the integral is (-2r³ + 2r² +3r) from 0 to5.

At r=5:

-2*(125) = -250.

2*(25) = 50.

3*5=15.

Sum: -250 +50= -200; -200+15= -185.

So the integral is -185. Then, V = - integral = 185 V.

So the correct answer should be B: 185 V.

The electric field is given as \( E(r) = -6r^2 + 4r + 3 \) in N/C, and the potential difference between the origin (r=0) and the point (3,4) is to be calculated. The radial distance \( r \) to the point (3,4) is calculated as \( r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 \, \text{m} \).

The potential difference \( V \) is found by integrating the electric field along the radial path from 0 to 5 meters, using the formula:

\[
V = -\int_{0}^{5} E(r) \, dr = -\int_{0}^{5} (-6r^2 + 4r + 3) \, dr.
\]

Breaking the integral into terms:

\[
\int (-6r^2) \, dr = -2r^3, \quad \int 4r \, dr = 2r^2, \quad \int 3 \, dr = 3r.
\]

Combining these, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{5} (-6r^2 + 4r + 3) \, dr = \left[ -2r^3 + 2r^2 + 3r \right]_{0}^{5}.
\]

Evaluating at \( r = 5 \):

\[
-2(125) + 2(25) + 3(5) = -250 + 50 + 15 = -185.
\]

At \( r = 0 \), the integral is 0. Thus, the integral from 0 to 5 is \( -185 \). The potential difference is the negative of this result:

\[
V = -(-185) = 185 \, \text{V}.
\]

Thus, the potential difference is **185 V**, corresponding to option **B**.
