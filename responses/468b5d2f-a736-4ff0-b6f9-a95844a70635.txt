Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the multiplier effect. I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking what the multiplier effect is, and there are ten options labeled A through J. I remember that the multiplier effect has something to do with how an initial change in spending leads to a larger overall change in the economy. It's often discussed in the context of Keynesian economics, where increased investment or government spending can lead to more income and consumption, creating a chain reaction.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The ratio of urban to suburban workers in an economy. Hmm, that sounds more like a demographic or geographic distribution, not directly related to the multiplier effect.

Option B: The ratio of urban to rural workers. Similar to A, this seems to be about worker distribution rather than economic multiplier effects.

Option C: The addition of non-urban jobs created by the rural economy. Wait, that's adding jobs outside the city due to rural activities. I'm not sure how this ties into the multiplier effect, which is usually about how investments or spending ripple through the economy.

Option D: The ratio of non-basic workers to basic workers in an urban economy. Non-basic and basic workers—maybe this refers to workers in essential vs. non-essential sectors. I'm not sure how this relates to the multiplier effect. It might be more about structural economics.

Option E: The subtraction of rural jobs created by the urban economy. This seems to suggest that urban areas are causing rural job losses, which doesn't fit with the idea of a multiplier effect, which is usually about positive growth.

Option F: The addition of basic workers to a rural economy that has added more non-basic workers. This seems like it's talking about employment growth in rural areas, but again, not directly about the multiplier effect.

Option G: The addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy. So urban areas creating rural jobs. That could be a form of multiplier effect, where economic activities in cities lead to more jobs in rural areas, but I'm not certain if this is the standard definition.

Option H: The addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers. So maybe when basic industries grow, they create more non-basic jobs. That could be a multiplier effect within the urban economy, but I'm not sure if this is the correct term.

Option I: The ratio of city workers to farm workers. Again, this seems like a ratio of worker distribution rather than an economic multiplier effect.

Option J: The elimination of non-basic workers from an urban economy that has lost basic workers. This seems more like a negative scenario, perhaps a recession, but not the multiplier effect itself.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up some concepts. The multiplier effect is about how an initial increase in spending leads to a larger total increase in output. For example, if the government builds a road, the construction workers spend their money, which leads to more spending in other sectors, and so on, multiplying the initial investment.

In terms of urban economics, I remember something about the urban-rural multiplier. Maybe it's about how economic activities in cities can have a larger impact on the surrounding rural areas. So when urban areas grow, they might create jobs in rural areas as well, leading to a multiplier effect beyond just the urban sector.

Looking back at the options, Option G says "the addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy." That seems to fit with the idea that urban growth leads to more rural jobs, thus a multiplier effect where urban activities have a broader impact.

Alternatively, Option H talks about adding non-basic workers in the urban economy because of more basic workers. That could also be a multiplier effect within the urban area itself. For example, if a city gets a new factory (basic industry), it might create jobs in services (non-basic), which in turn create more jobs elsewhere.

Wait, but the standard multiplier effect is a general concept, not specifically tied to urban vs rural. However, the question seems to present the multiplier effect in the context of urban and rural economics.

I think I might have confused the terms. Let me try to recall. The urban-rural multiplier effect refers to how an increase in economic activity in urban areas leads to a greater increase in rural areas. So if urban areas produce more, it might require more resources from rural areas, leading to job creation there as well.

So in that case, Option G would be correct because it's about rural jobs being added due to the urban economy.

Alternatively, Option H is about non-basic workers in the urban economy due to more basic workers. That could be an internal urban multiplier effect. For example, building more factories (basic) leads to more service jobs (non-basic) in the city.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between G and H. Let me think about what the multiplier effect entails. It's about the chain reaction. So if urban basic workers increase, their spending might lead to more demand for services, creating non-basic jobs. So H could be a correct description of part of the multiplier effect within the urban economy.

But the question is about the multiplier effect in general, or in the context given. The options are a bit unclear. Let me see the options again.

Option H: The addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers.

That sounds like a direct result of the multiplier effect. When basic workers are added, their spending leads to increased demand, which creates more non-basic jobs. So H seems to describe an urban multiplier effect.

Option G is about urban creating rural jobs, which is also a multiplier effect but in a different context.

Wait, the question is asking for the definition of the multiplier effect. The standard multiplier effect is a general concept, but in urban economics, it's often applied to how urban activities affect the surrounding areas.

I think the correct answer is H because it's about how adding basic workers leads to more non-basic workers in the urban economy, which is a classic multiplier effect scenario. For example, investment in manufacturing (basic) leads to growth in services (non-basic), which then leads to even more growth.

Alternatively, if the question is about the multiplier effect in the context of urban vs rural, then G would be correct. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I remember that the urban multiplier effect refers to the additional impact of urban activities on the rural areas. So when urban areas expand, they might increase demand for rural goods, leading to rural job creation. So Option G would be correct in that case.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think of a real-world example. If a city builds a new airport (a basic industry), it might require more goods and services, which could lead to more jobs not just in the city but also in nearby rural areas, like in agriculture or transportation. So the urban economy's expansion leads to rural job creation, which is the multiplier effect across regions.

In that case, Option G would be the correct answer because it's about the addition of rural jobs due to the urban economy.

Alternatively, if the multiplier effect is within the urban area, then H would be correct. But the options don't specify, so I need to pick the best fit.

Wait, the options are about definitions. Let me try to recall the textbook definition. The multiplier effect is the phenomenon where an initial increase in spending leads to a larger increase in overall economic output. In the context of urban and rural economics, it can refer to how urban growth affects rural areas.

So, in that context, the multiplier effect would be the addition of rural jobs due to urban activities, which is Option G.

Alternatively, another source I recall mentions that the urban multiplier effect refers to the fact that each dollar spent in an urban area generates more economic activity than the same dollar spent in a rural area because of higher productivity and concentration of economic activities. But that's more about the size of the multiplier rather than the definition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The multiplier effect is about how an initial change leads to a larger overall change. So, in the context of urban and rural, if urban areas invest, it can create jobs in rural areas, leading to a multiplier effect where the initial investment has a larger impact.

So, looking at the options, H is about non-basic workers in the urban economy due to more basic workers—this is an internal urban multiplier. G is about rural jobs created by urban economy, which is an external multiplier.

The question is asking for the multiplier effect. The standard definition is about the chain reaction leading to a larger impact. So both H and G could be examples of the multiplier effect, but in different contexts.

Wait, the options don't specify context. So the question is general. The multiplier effect is about the addition of non-basic workers when more basic workers are added, as in H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H. Because the multiplier effect in an urban economy is when an increase in basic workers (like manufacturing) leads to an increase in non-basic workers (like services), thus multiplying the initial increase.

So I'm leaning towards H being the correct answer.

The multiplier effect refers to how an initial change in spending leads to a larger overall economic impact. In the context of urban economics, this can manifest in two ways: an internal urban multiplier effect, where an increase in basic workers (e.g., manufacturing) leads to more non-basic workers (e.g., services) within the urban economy, and an external urban-rural multiplier effect, where urban activities create jobs in rural areas.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H** describes the addition of non-basic workers in the urban economy due to more basic workers, which aligns with the internal urban multiplier effect.
- **Option G** refers to the addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy, which fits the external urban-rural multiplier effect.

While both H and G describe aspects of the multiplier effect, the question asks for the definition of the multiplier effect itself. The internal urban multiplier effect, as described in H, is a classic example of how the multiplier effect operates within an urban economy. Therefore, the best answer is:

H

Answer: H
