Okay, so I need to figure out which situation is represented by the expression 6 x 2. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the expression 6 multiplied by 2 means adding six two times, or six groups of two, or two groups of six. So it's about a total amount that results from multiplying these two numbers.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Rocco read six books in two months. That sounds like six books over two months, so maybe six divided by two, but the expression is multiplication. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B: Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days. So each day he hiked six miles, and he did that for two days. So that's 6 miles/day x 2 days, which is 12 miles total. So that would be 6 x 2, right? Because it's two days of six miles each.

Option C: Rocco spent six hours on homework for two days. Similar to B, but here it's six hours each day for two days. So that's 6 x 2 = 12 hours total. So this could also be represented by 6 x 2.

Wait, so both B and C involve multiplying 6 by 2. So I need to see which one is the correct scenario based on the options.

Option D: Rocco has six siblings and two of them are girls. That's more about parts of a group, not multiplication. It's like 2 out of 6, which is a ratio, not multiplication.

Option E: Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans. So maybe each can has three? But the expression is 6 x 2. So if he had two cans with six each, that would be 12, but the total is six. So that's not matching.

Option F: Rocco had six shirts and washed two of them. That's about selecting two out of six, which is subtraction or maybe division, but not multiplication.

Option G: Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles. That's addition: 6 + 2 = 8 miles.

Option H: Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them. Again, subtraction: 6 - 2.

Option I: Rocco had six apples and ate two of them. Subtraction again: 6 - 2.

So, back to options B and C. Both involve 6 x 2, but the question is which situation is represented by the expression. The expression is just 6 multiplied by 2, without any context of total or per day.

In option B, he hiked six miles each day for two days. So that's two days multiplied by six miles per day. So 6 x 2 = 12 miles total. That fits.

In option C, he spent six hours each day for two days. So that's 6 x 2 = 12 hours total. So that also fits.

Wait, so both B and C could be represented by 6 x 2. But looking back at the options, the question is which situation could be represented by that expression, so perhaps both are correct, but I need to see if the options are unique.

Wait, the options are A to I, each with a different scenario. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the expression is 6 x 2. So it's 6 multiplied by 2, which could be either 6 times 2 days (so 12) or 2 times 6 miles (12). Both B and C are correct in the sense that they involve 6 x 2.

But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is B, because hiking six miles each day for two days is a common scenario where you multiply distance by number of days. Similarly, option C is about time spent each day.

Wait, but the question is about which situation could be represented by 6 x 2. So both B and C are possible, but I need to see which one is among the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps only one of them is correct. Let me read the options again carefully.

Option B: hiked six miles each day for two days. So that's 6 per day times 2 days. So 6 x 2 = 12 total miles. So yes, that's represented by the expression.

Option C: spent six hours on homework for two days. So that's 6 hours per day times 2 days. So 6 x 2 = 12 hours. So that also fits.

Hmm, so both B and C are correct. But looking at the options, the answer must be one. Maybe the intended answer is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me check the other options again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option E: six tennis balls in two cans. If each can had three, that would be 3 x 2 = 6, which is not 6 x 2. So E is not correct.

Option F: six shirts, washed two. That's 6 - 2, so not multiplication.

Options D, H, I are subtraction or division.

Options G is addition.

So the only options left are B and C. But the question is which one is represented by 6 x 2. So both B and C involve multiplying 6 by 2, but perhaps the way the options are phrased, only one is correct.

Wait, the expression is 6 x 2. So in B, it's 6 miles/day multiplied by 2 days, which is 12 miles. In C, it's 6 hours/day multiplied by 2 days, which is 12 hours. So both situations involve 6 x 2, but perhaps the intended answer is B because it's a more common scenario where you think of multiplying per day by days.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C because the expression is 6 x 2, which could mean 6 hours each day for two days, so 6 multiplied by 2.

Wait, but the question is about which situation is represented by the expression. Both B and C are correct, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A through I, and I think only one is correct. Maybe the answer is B, because the expression 6 x 2 represents the total miles, which is the result of 6 x 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C because it's about the time spent each day, but the expression is 6 x 2. I'm a bit confused because both B and C seem correct, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B because it's about the total distance, whereas C is about total time. But both involve 6 x 2.

Wait, maybe the answer is B because it's more straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C because the expression is 6 multiplied by 2 days. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B because the expression 6 x 2 is used to calculate the total distance, which is 12 miles. So Rocco hiked 6 miles each day for two days, so 6 x 2.

Alternatively, in option C, he spent 6 hours each day for two days, so 6 x 2 = 12 hours.

So both B and C are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is B because it's a more common example.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is B. Let me check the options again.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C because the expression is 6 x 2, which is the number of hours, not the distance.

Wait, but both are correct. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The expression is 6 multiplied by 2. So any situation where 6 is multiplied by 2.

In B, it's 6 miles per day times 2 days. So 6 x 2.

In C, it's 6 hours per day times 2 days. So 6 x 2.

So both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is B because it's more about the multiplication of a quantity over a number of times, making the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because the expression 6 x 2 is used to find the total miles, which is 12.

But wait, the question is asking which situation could be represented by the expression 6 x 2. So it's about the scenario that matches the multiplication, not necessarily the result.

So both B and C are correct, but I think the answer is B because the expression is 6 multiplied by 2, which is the number of days. So Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days, so 6 x 2.

But I'm not entirely sure, but I think the answer is B.

The expression \(6 \times 2\) represents a situation where six of something is done two times or two of something involving six. Among the options, both **B** and **C** fit this pattern:

- **B**: Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days. This involves \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles in total.
- **C**: Rocco spent six hours on homework for two days. This involves \(6 \times 2 = 12\) hours in total.

However, the intended answer is likely **B**, as it is a more common example of a situation represented by the expression \(6 \times 2\).

Answer: B
