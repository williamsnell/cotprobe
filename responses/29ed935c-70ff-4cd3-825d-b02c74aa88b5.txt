Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the mass and weight of the air in a living room and comparing it to an equal volume of water. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me break this down.

First, the room dimensions are 4.0 m by 5.0 m, and the ceiling is 3.0 m high. So, to find the volume of the room, I'll multiply length by width by height. That should give me the volume in cubic meters. Let me write that out: Volume = 4 * 5 * 3. Hmm, 4 times 5 is 20, and 20 times 3 is 60. So the volume is 60 cubic meters.

Next, I need to find the mass of the air in this volume. I remember that air density isn't something I can just pull out of thin air, so I should probably look up the standard density of air at 20 degrees Celsius. Wait, from what I recall, the density of air at 20°C is approximately 1.2041 kg per cubic meter. Let me just confirm that because getting the right density is crucial here. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the mass of the air would be the density multiplied by the volume. That's mass = density * volume. Plugging in the numbers: 1.2041 kg/m³ * 60 m³. Let me calculate that. 1.2 * 60 is 72, and 0.0041 * 60 is about 0.246. Adding them together gives roughly 72.246 kg. So the mass of the air is approximately 72.25 kg.

But wait, the question asks for the mass and weight of the air. Oh, right, weight is the force due to gravity, which is mass times gravitational acceleration. The standard g is 9.81 m/s². So weight = mass * g. Calculating that: 72.25 kg * 9.81 m/s². Let me do this multiplication. 70 kg * 9.81 is 686.7 N, and 2.25 kg * 9.81 is about 22.08 N. Adding them gives 686.7 + 22.08 = 708.78 N. But wait, the options are in units of 10^5 N, so I think I might have messed up the scaling. Let me check the problem again. Oh, no, wait, the units for the options are in 10^5 N. So I need to express the weight in terms of 10^5 N. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 708 N is way less than 10^5 N. Maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are given as numbers, and the unit is 10^5 N. Oh, that must mean the answer is in terms of 10^5 newtons. So, for example, if the weight was 1000 N, it would be 0.01 *10^5 N, so the option would be 0.01. But wait, my calculation gave 708.78 N, which is 0.0070878 *10^5 N, approximately 0.0071 *10^5. But looking at the options, the numbers are all around 3.6, 4.8, etc. That can’t be right. Wait, maybe I messed up the volume. Let me double-check the volume.

Wait, 4m by 5m by 3m is indeed 60 m³. So that's correct. Air density at 20°C is about 1.204 kg/m³. So mass is 72.246 kg. Weight is 72.246 *9.81 = 708.7 N, which is 0.007087 *10^5 N. But none of the options are close to 0.007. So maybe I misunderstood the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mass and weight of the air and the mass and weight of an equal volume of water. Oh, right, the question says to find both the mass and weight of the air and the same for water. So perhaps I need to compare the two.

Wait, the problem says: "the mass and weight of the air [...] and the mass and weight of an equal volume of water." So I think I need to compute both. Let me proceed.

So for the air, as I did, mass is about 72.25 kg, weight is ~708.7 N. For water, the density is much higher. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³. So the mass of water would be 60 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ = 60,000 kg. That's 60,000 kg. The weight would be 60,000 kg *9.81 m/s² = 588,600 N. In terms of 10^5 N, that's 5.886 *10^5 N, which is 5.886 when expressed as a multiple of 10^5. So 5.886 is approximately 5.9, which is option F.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and the first part is about the air, then the water. Hmm, but the way the question is phrased, it's unclear whether the answer requires both values or just one. Let me read the question again: "Find the mass and weight of the air [...] and the mass and weight of an equal volume of water." So perhaps the answer requires both, but the options only have single numbers. Alternatively, perhaps each part (air and water) is a separate calculation, and the options are for each, but the way the options are presented, each is a single value. Hmm, maybe the question is only asking for one of them. Wait, looking back, the question says "the mass and weight of the air [...] and the mass and weight of an equal volume of water." So perhaps the problem wants both, but since the options are single numbers, maybe it's referring to the weight of the water, which is 5.9 *10^5 N, which would be option F. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the mass of the water in terms of 10^5 kg? No, because the options are in 10^5 N. So let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the weight of the air and the weight of the water, and the options are for each. But I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the problem.

The room has a volume of 60 m³. The mass of the air is about 72.25 kg, weight ~708.7 N, which is 0.007087 *10^5 N, which is 0.0071 approximately, but that's not among the options. The mass of water is 60,000 kg, weight 588,600 N, which is 5.886 *10^5 N, approximately 5.9, which is option F.

So perhaps the question is asking for the weight of the water, which would be option F, 5.9. But wait, the options don't specify which one, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for both the mass and weight of the air and the same for water, but perhaps the options are combining both, or maybe I'm supposed to compute the mass of the water in kg, but expressed in terms of 10^5 kg? Wait, no, because the options are in 10^5 N. So perhaps the question is only about the weight of the water, which is 5.9, option F.

Wait, but looking back, the question says "mass and weight of the air [...] and the mass and weight of an equal volume of water." So perhaps I'm to compute both the air and the water, but the options are in 10^5 N, so I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate the weight of the air and the weight of the water, and the options are for each, but perhaps the way the options are presented, it's just one value. Wait, looking at the options again, the numbers are all single values, so perhaps the question is only asking for one of them. Let me re-read the question.

"Find the mass and weight of the air [...] and the mass and weight of an equal volume of water." So perhaps the problem is asking to compute both, but the options are providing possible answers, maybe for each separately. But the way the options are presented, each is a single value, so perhaps the question is asking for the weight of the air and the weight of the water, and the options are for each, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the weight of the air and the weight of the water, and the options are for each, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for the weight of the air, but that would be 0.007, which isn't an option. So I'm probably misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mass and weight of the air, and the mass and weight of the water, but the options are in 10^5 N. So perhaps the answer is for the air's weight, but that's 0.007, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the options are for the mass of the water in kg, but that would be 60,000 kg, which is 60 *10^3 kg, but the options are in 10^5 N, which doesn't fit. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the volume. Let me check: 4 m *5 m = 20 m², times 3 m height is 60 m³. That's correct. So the volume is 60 m³.

Air density at 20°C is 1.2041 kg/m³, so mass of air is 1.2041 *60 = 72.246 kg. Weight is 72.246 *9.81 = 708.7 N, which is 0.007087 *10^5 N, approximately 0.0071. But that's not among the options. So perhaps the question is about the mass of the water. Wait, water's mass is 60,000 kg, which is 60 metric tons. But the options are in 10^5 N, so perhaps I'm supposed to express the weight of the water in 10^5 N. 60,000 kg *9.81 m/s² = 588,600 N, which is 5.886 *10^5 N, so approximately 5.9, which is option F.

But wait, the options are single numbers, so perhaps the answer is 5.9, which is option F. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mass of the water, which is 60,000 kg, but expressed in 10^5 kg, that's 0.6 *10^5 kg, but the options are in N. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the mass of the air and the mass of the water, but in 10^5 kg. Air's mass is 72.25 kg, which is 0.0007225 *10^5 kg, or 0.0007225, but that's not an option. Water's mass is 60,000 kg, which is 0.6 *10^5 kg, but again, the options are in 10^5 N, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. The problem statement says, "the unit: 10^5 N." So each option is a value multiplied by 10^5 N. So for example, if the weight is 708 N, that's 0.00708 *10^5 N, which would be 0.00708. But none of the options are that low. So perhaps the problem is asking for the weight of the water, which is 588,600 N, which is 5.886 *10^5 N, approximately 5.9, which is option F. So the answer would be F:5.9.

Wait, but the question also mentions the mass and weight of the air. So perhaps the options are for both, but the way it's phrased, maybe the question is only about the water. Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute both and see which option matches. But the options are single numbers, so perhaps the question is only asking for one of them. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the mass of the air and the mass of the water, both in 10^5 kg, but that doesn't seem right because the options are in N. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the weight of the air and the weight of the water, and the options are for each, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the weight of the air, but that's 0.007, which isn't an option. So I'm probably misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the mass of the air and the mass of the water, but in terms of 10^5 kg. So air's mass is 72.25 kg, which is 0.0007225 *10^5 kg, which is 0.0007225, but that's not an option. Water's mass is 60,000 kg, which is 0.6 *10^5 kg, but that's not an option either. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the mass of the air and the mass of the water, but in 10^5 kg, and the options are for each. But again, the options are numbers, so perhaps the answer is for the water's weight, which is 5.9, option F.

Wait, let me try to structure this again:

- Volume = 4 *5 *3 =60 m³.

- Density of air at 20°C: 1.2041 kg/m³.

- Mass of air: 1.2041 *60 ≈72.25 kg.

- Weight of air: 72.25 *9.81 ≈708.7 N → 0.007087 *10^5 N → ~0.0071.

- Density of water: 1000 kg/m³.

- Mass of water: 60 *1000 =60,000 kg.

- Weight of water:60,000 *9.81=588,600 N →5.886 *10^5 N →≈5.9.

So the weight of the water is approximately 5.9 *10^5 N, which is option F.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F:5.9.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the volume of the living room by multiplying its dimensions:  
\[
\text{Volume} = 4.0 \, \text{m} \times 5.0 \, \text{m} \times 3.0 \, \text{m} = 60 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Next, we determine the mass of the air using its density at \(20^\circ \text{C}\), which is approximately \(1.2041 \, \text{kg/m}^3\):  
\[
\text{Mass of air} = 1.2041 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 60 \, \text{m}^3 = 72.25 \, \text{kg}
\]

The weight of the air is then calculated using \(g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\):  
\[
\text{Weight of air} = 72.25 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 708.7 \, \text{N}
\]
Expressed in units of \(10^5 \, \text{N}\), this is approximately \(0.0071 \times 10^5 \, \text{N}\), which is not among the provided options.

For water, we use its density (\(1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)) to find its mass:  
\[
\text{Mass of water} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 60 \, \text{m}^3 = 60,000 \, \text{kg}
\]

The weight of the water is:  
\[
\text{Weight of water} = 60,000 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 588,600 \, \text{N}
\]
Expressed in units of \(10^5 \, \text{N}\), this is approximately \(5.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{N}\), corresponding to option F.

Thus, the correct answer is:

F: 5.9  
\boxed{F}
