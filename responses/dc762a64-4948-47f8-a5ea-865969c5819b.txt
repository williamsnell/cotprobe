Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question says that a certain solution has a pH of 3.89 at 0°C, and I need to find the pOH and the hydroxide ion concentration [OH^-]. The options are from A to J, each giving a pOH value and a corresponding [OH^-].

Hmm, I remember that pH and pOH are related in water solutions. The basic formula I know is pH + pOH = 14, but wait, isn't that only at 25°C? Oh right, because at different temperatures, the ion product of water (Kw) changes. So at 0°C, the Kw is different. I think Kw changes with temperature, so the sum of pH and pOH might not be 14 anymore.

Wait, what's Kw at 0°C? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I recall that at 25°C, Kw is 1e-14, but at lower temperatures, like 0°C, Kw is actually higher. I think it's around 1.17e-14 or something like that. Wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh, right, I remember now: at 0°C, Kw is approximately 1.14 × 10^-14. Or was it 1.17? I might get that wrong, but I'll proceed with 1.14e-14 for now.

So, the solution is at 0°C, so I can't use the usual pH + pOH =14 rule. Instead, I need to calculate pOH using Kw. The formula is Kw = [H+][OH^-]. Since pH is given, I can find [H+], then use Kw to find [OH^-], and then calculate pOH from that.

Given pH is 3.89. So [H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-3.89. Let me calculate that. 10^-3 is 0.001, and 10^-0.89 is about... Let's see, 10^-0.89 is approximately 0.133. So [H+] is roughly 1.33e-4 M.

Wait, let me get that more accurately. 10^-3.89 is equal to 10^(-4 + 0.11) = 10^-4 * 10^0.11. 10^0.11 is about 1.288. So [H+] ≈ 1.288e-4 M. Approximately 1.29e-4 M.

Now, using Kw = [H+][OH^-], so [OH^-] = Kw / [H+]. Plugging in the numbers: Kw is 1.14e-14, [H+] is 1.29e-4.

So [OH^-] = (1.14e-14) / (1.29e-4). Let me compute that. 1.14 / 1.29 is approximately 0.8837. And 1e-14 / 1e-4 is 1e-10. So the result is approximately 0.8837e-10, which is 8.837e-11 M.

Wait, but let me do the division more precisely. 1.14 divided by 1.29. Let me compute 1.29 * 0.88 is 1.1352. So 1.29 * 0.8837 ≈ 1.14. So yes, 0.8837 times 1.29 is about 1.14. So [OH^-] is approximately 8.837e-11 M.

Now, the pOH is calculated as -log[OH^-]. So pOH = -log(8.837e-11). Let's compute that.

Log(8.837e-11) is log(8.837) + log(1e-11). Log(8.837) is about 0.946, and log(1e-11) is -11. So total is -0.946 -11 = -11.946. Wait, no, wait: wait, wait, no. Wait, the pOH is -log(8.837e-11). So log(8.837e-11) is log(8.837) + log(1e-11). Log(8.837) is approximately 0.946, so log(8.837e-11) is 0.946 -11 = -10.054. So pOH is 10.054.

Wait, that can't be right because if pH is 3.89, and pOH is about 10.05, then pH + pOH = 13.94, which is less than 14, which makes sense because Kw is higher than 1e-14, so pH + pOH >14? Wait, no, wait. Wait, Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1.14e-14. So at 25°C, Kw=1e-14, pH + pOH=14. At 0°C, Kw is higher, so pH + pOH = log(Kw) + 14? Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because at 0°C, Kw is 1.14e-14, which is higher than 1e-14. So, the product [H+][OH^-] is higher, so for pure water at 0°C, pH would be about 6.97, because [H+]=sqrt(1.14e-14)≈1.07e-7, so pH≈6.97, same as pOH.

But in this problem, the solution's pH is 3.89. So [H+] is 1.29e-4, which is higher than 1e-7, so it's an acidic solution. Thus, the [OH^-] would be lower than 1e-7, so pOH would be higher than 7.

Wait, but according to my calculation, pOH is about 10.05, which is correct because at pH 3.89, [H+] is high, so [OH^-] is low, making pOH high.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again because I might have made a mistake in the [OH^-] calculation.

So, [OH^-] = Kw / [H+] = 1.14e-14 / 1.29e-4.

Let me compute that. 1.14e-14 / 1.29e-4 = (1.14 / 1.29) * 1e-10.

1.14 divided by 1.29 is approximately 0.8837. So 0.8837e-10 is 8.837e-11 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 8.84e-11 M.

Then, pOH = -log(8.84e-11) = ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

Log(8.84) is about 0.946, so log(8.84e-11) is 0.946 -11 = -10.054. So pOH is 10.054, which rounds to about 10.05.

Looking at the options, option J is pOH=10.05, [OH^-]=8.9e-11. That's very close to my calculated 8.84e-11, which is about 8.9e-11 when rounded.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option E is pOH=11.05, [OH^-]=8.9e-12. Option J is pOH=10.05, [OH^-]=8.9e-11. Option D is pOH=11.89, [OH^-]=1.3e-12. Option B is pOH=11.05, [OH^-]=8.9e-10, which is way larger than my calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in Kw. Let me check the exact value of Kw at 0°C. I remember that Kw increases as temperature decreases. At 0°C, I think Kw is approximately 1.14 × 10^-14. Some sources say it's 1.17e-14. Let me confirm: according to some tables, at 0°C, Kw is about 1.18 × 10^-14. So maybe I should use 1.18e-14.

So, recalculating [OH^-] with Kw=1.18e-14.

[OH^-] = 1.18e-14 / 1.29e-4.

1.18 / 1.29 is approximately 0.9147. So 0.9147e-10 = 9.147e-11 M.

So [OH^-] ≈9.15e-11 M.

Then, pOH = -log(9.15e-11) = ?

Log(9.15) is about 0.9617, so log(9.15e-11) is 0.9617-11 = -10.0383. So pOH≈10.038, which rounds to 10.04.

Looking at the options, option J is pOH=10.05, [OH^-]=8.9e-11. Close, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value of Kw is 1.14e-14 as I first thought.

Wait, maybe the options use a different Kw value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another approach: since Kw is [H+][OH^-] = 1.14e-14 at 0°C.

Given pH=3.89, [H+] = 10^-3.89.

Compute [H+] accurately: 3.89 is the pH, so [H+] = 1.29e-4 M as before.

Then [OH^-] = 1.14e-14 / (1.29e-4) = (1.14 / 1.29) * 1e-10.

1.14 / 1.29 ≈ 0.8837, so [OH^-] ≈ 8.837e-11 M.

So pOH = -log(8.837e-11) = ?

Log(8.837) ≈0.946, so log(8.837e-11)=0.946 -11 = -10.054. So pOH≈10.05.

Looking at the options, option J is pOH=10.05 and [OH^-]=8.9e-11. That's very close to my calculation.

Wait, but another option is option E: pOH=11.05 and [OH^-]=8.9e-12. That's a much lower concentration and higher pOH. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Kw. Let me check another source. I think Kw at 0°C is approximately 1.17 × 10^-14. Let's try that.

So [OH^-] = 1.17e-14 / 1.29e-4 = 1.17 / 1.29 * 1e-10.

1.17 / 1.29 ≈0.9069. So [OH^-]≈9.069e-11 M.

pOH = -log(9.069e-11) = log(9.069) -11.

Log(9.069)≈0.957, so pOH≈10.043, which is about 10.04. So option J (10.05) is still the closest.

But wait, none of the options have pOH=10.04, but option J is 10.05, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

But wait, looking at the options again, option J is pOH=10.05, [OH^-]=8.9e-11. Wait, 8.9e-11 is close to our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the equation pH + pOH = pKw, where pKw is the negative log of Kw. So pKw = -log(Kw) = -log(1.14e-14) = approximately 13.89.

So pH + pOH = pKw → 3.89 + pOH =13.89 → pOH=10.00.

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, because pKw is the sum of pH and pOH. So if Kw=1.14e-14, then pKw= -log(1.14e-14)=14 - log(1.14)=14 -0.0569=13.9431≈13.94. So pH + pOH =13.94.

So pH=3.89 → pOH=13.94 -3.89=10.05.

Ah, that's a better approach. So pOH=10.05. Then, [OH^-]=10^(-pOH)=10^-10.05≈8.91e-11 M.

So that gives pOH=10.05 and [OH^-]=8.91e-11 M, which matches option J.

So the correct answer should be option J: pOH=10.05, [OH^-]=8.9 × 10^-11.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the relationship between pH, pOH, and the ion product of water (Kw) depends on the temperature. At 0°C, Kw is approximately \(1.14 \times 10^{-14}\), which is higher than the \(1.0 \times 10^{-14}\) at 25°C. This means that the sum of pH and pOH is not exactly 14 but is instead equal to \( \text{pKw} = -\log(\text{Kw}) \). 

First, calculate \( \text{pKw} \):
\[
\text{pKw} = -\log(1.14 \times 10^{-14}) \approx 13.94
\]

Given the pH of 3.89, we use the relationship:
\[
\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = \text{pKw}
\]
\[
3.89 + \text{pOH} = 13.94
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = 13.94 - 3.89 = 10.05
\]

Next, calculate the hydroxide ion concentration \([OH^-]\) using the formula:
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = 10^{-\text{pOH}}
\]
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = 10^{-10.05} \approx 8.9 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{M}
\]

Finally, compare the calculated values (\(\text{pOH} = 10.05\) and \([OH^-] = 8.9 \times 10^{-11}\)) with the provided options. Option J matches these values exactly.
