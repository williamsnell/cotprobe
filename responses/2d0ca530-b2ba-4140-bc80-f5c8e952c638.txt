Question:

A truck driver from State A and a bus driver from State B were involved in a collision in State B that injured the truck driver. The truck driver filed a federal diversity action in State B based on negligence, seeking $100,000 in damages from the bus driver. What law of negligence should the court apply?

Options:

A: The court should apply the federal common law of negligence.
B: The court should consider the negligence law of both State A and State B and apply the law that the court believes most appropriately governs negligence in this action.
C: The court should apply the negligence law of the state with the highest population.
D: The court should apply international negligence law.
E: The court should apply the negligence law of the state where the truck driver's company is headquartered.
F: The court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.
G: The court should apply the negligence law of State A, the truck driver's state of citizenship.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law and jurisdiction. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a truck driver from State A and a bus driver from State B. They collide in State B, and the truck driver is injured. He files a federal diversity action in State B, claiming negligence and seeking $100k in damages.

First, I remember that diversity jurisdiction allows cases to be heard in federal court if the parties are from different states and the amount in controversy is over a certain threshold. Here, it's definitely a diversity case because the truck driver is from State A and the bus driver is from State B, so they're citizens of different states.

Now, the main issue is about which state's negligence law the court should apply. I think this relates to choice of law, specifically determining the applicable law in a federal diversity case.

I recall that in federal courts, when there's diversity jurisdiction, the substantive law (which includes the negligence rules) is determined by the state where the case is brought. So in this case, since the case is filed in State B, the court should apply State B's negligence law.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: isn't there a principle that when a case is brought in federal court under diversity, the choice of law is determined by the state where the action is brought, but also considering the states' interest. Or is there another rule?

Oh right, I think it's the "borrowing" rule. Federal courts in diversity cases often borrow the choice-of-law rules from the forum state. So, the court would look at how State B's courts would choose the applicable law.

Alternatively, I've heard of the "most significant relationship" test from the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, which considers various factors like where the tort occurred, where the parties are from, etc.

But wait, in the context of federal diversity cases, the court applies the forum state's choice of law rules. So if the case is in State B, the court would apply State B's choice of law rules to decide whether to use State A or State B's negligence law.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that. That makes sense because the federal court would follow the forum state's (State B) choice of law rules.

Option G suggests applying State A's law, which is where the truck driver is from, but that's probably not correct unless State B's choice of law rules dictate that.

Option E is about the truck driver's company's headquarters, which doesn't seem relevant here because the question is about the individual's state of citizenship, not the company's location.

Option C is about population, which doesn't make sense as a basis for choice of law.

Options A and D are about federal or international law, which I don't think apply here because negligence is a state law issue, and without specific federal tort law, the court would use state law.

So the correct approach is that the federal court applies the choice of law rules of State B. Thus, the court would determine which state's negligence law a State B court would apply and then apply that law. That points to option F.

Wait, but another angle: when the action is based on diversity, the forum state's law (in this case, State B) is used. So, the court would apply State B's negligence law. But wait, is that always the case? Or does the forum state's choice of law determine whether to use their own or another state's law?

Hmm, no. The forum state's choice of law rules decide which state's law applies. So if the case is in State B, the court applies State B's rules to decide between State A and State B's law.

So the correct answer would be F because the court looks at how State B's courts would choose the applicable law.

The question involves a federal diversity case where the court must determine which state's negligence law to apply. Under diversity jurisdiction, federal courts typically apply the forum state's choice of law rules. Here, the case is brought in State B, so the court looks at how State B's courts would decide the applicable law. This means the court will apply the negligence law that a State B court would choose, based on factors like where the tort occurred and the parties' states of citizenship. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: The court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.

Answer: F
