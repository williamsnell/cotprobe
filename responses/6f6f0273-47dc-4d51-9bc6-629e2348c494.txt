Question:

There has been a great deal of news media coverage regarding the problem of underage drinking. Many high school and college students have been purchasing fraudulent driver's licenses with phony birthdates showing "proof' of being 21 years of age or older. As a consequence, many teenagers are able to purchase alcoholic beverages at liquor stores, restaurants, and bars. The situation is becoming especially alarming on many college campuses. A magazine article reported that the majority of freshmen between the ages of 18 and 19 at many colleges had illegally purchased evidence of phony "proof. "With underage drinking reaching epidemic proportions, Congress enacted a statute establishing a federal commission to monitor and curtail alcoholic beverage sales to underage drinkers. To implement the program on a national scale, the bill required each state to pass legislation establishing a local "watchdog" agency to facilitate compliance with congressional intent. A state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the federal statute. The law is likely to be held

Options:

A: valid, because the Twenty First Amendment grants the federal government the power to control the sale and consumption of alcohol.
B: valid, because the federal government has the power to regulate all activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
C: valid, because the establishment of a state watchdog agency under the auspices of a federal regulatory scheme is consistent with the provisions of the Twenty First Amendment.
D: valid, because the sale of alcoholic beverages has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.
E: invalid, because it violates the Tenth Amendment's reservation of powers to the states.
F: invalid, because it violates the fundamental principles of state sovereignty embodied by the Eleventh Amendment.
G: invalid, because the federal government cannot force states to implement federal regulations.
H: invalid, because it infringes on the state's right to regulate activities within their own borders.
I: invalid, because the federal government may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.
J: valid, because the federal government has the authority to regulate issues of national concern.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this federal statute about underage drinking is constitutional. The question is about whether the law is valid or invalid, and there are ten options from A to J. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: Congress passed a law creating a federal commission to monitor and reduce the sale of alcohol to underage drinkers. To implement this, each state had to pass its own legislation to set up a "watchdog" agency. Now, a state is suing, claiming the statute is unconstitutional.

I remember from my studies that the Constitution gives certain powers to the federal government and reserves others to the states. This is about state sovereignty and the division of powers. The key here is whether the federal government can force states to create these agencies.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's valid because the 21st Amendment gives the federal power over alcohol. The 21st Amendment does deal with alcohol, like allowing states to regulate it, but I'm not sure if it gives the federal government direct control. I think the 21st Amendment mainly allows states to have authority, but the feds can still regulate in some ways.

Option B talks about regulating activities that affect interstate commerce. The federal government has broad power under the Commerce Clause. Selling alcohol to minors could affect interstate commerce because it might impact the market and transportation of alcohol across states. But wait, the issue here is whether the federal law can require states to set up their own agencies. That might be a different issue.

Option C is about the Twenty First Amendment and state cooperation. It says the establishment of state watchdogs under federal schemes is okay under the 21st Amendment. I'm not sure if the 21st Amendment allows the feds to require states to do this. The 21st Amendment did repeal Prohibition and gave states some control, but I don't remember it allowing the feds to commandeer state agencies.

Option D says it's valid because alcohol sales affect interstate commerce. That's similar to B but phrased differently. It's about the impact, but again, the main issue is the states being forced to create agencies.

Option E claims it's invalid because it violates the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states. The Tenth Amendment says that any powers not given to the federal government are reserved for the states. If the federal government is forcing states to do something, that might infringe on state powers. So E is a possibility.

Option F mentions the Eleventh Amendment and state sovereignty. The Eleventh Amendment is more about states not being sued by others, like in federal courts. So I think F might not be the right answer here because the issue is about the federal government's authority over the states, not about suing them.

Option G says it's invalid because the feds can't force states to implement federal regulations. This sounds familiar. There's a principle called "coercion" where the federal government can't make states pass certain laws. For example, in cases like Printz v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government can't commandeer state executives to enforce federal laws. So G seems like a strong contender.

Option H talks about infringing on state's right to regulate. That's similar to E and G. It's about states having the authority to regulate within their borders, and the federal law might be overstepping.

Option I says it's invalid because the feds can't compel state legislatures to enact their programs. That aligns with G and H. The idea is that the federal government can't force state legislatures to pass specific laws. This is about state sovereignty and the concept of preemption, but more about the federal government dictating state laws.

Option J says it's valid because the federal government can regulate national concerns. Under the commerce clause, the feds can regulate if it's a matter of national concern. Underage drinking and alcohol sales could be seen as such. However, the issue here is not just regulation by the feds, but requiring states to set up their own agencies. So even if the federal law is valid on its own, requiring states to implement it might be the problem.

So, putting it together: The core issue is whether the federal statute can require states to pass their own legislation and create agencies. This touches on the concept of federalism and state sovereignty. The Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government cannot force states to adopt federal regulations through their own laws. For example, in New York v. United States (1992), the Court held that the federal government couldn't require states to enact certain waste disposal regulations. Similarly, in McCulloch v. Maryland, the Court said the federal government can't be taxed by states and that states can't prevent the federal government from exercising its powers, but the states aren't required to implement federal laws.

Looking back at the options, I think G and I are the main contenders. G says the federal government can't force states to implement federal regulations. I says it's invalid because the federal government can't compel state legislatures to enact a program. Both seem correct, but perhaps I is more precise because it's about compelling state legislatures, which is exactly what the statute is doing.

Wait, but in the scenario, the federal law "required each state to pass legislation establishing a local watchdog agency." That means the federal government is mandating that states pass their own laws. So the question is whether the federal government can do that. The Supreme Court has said no, especially in cases like South Carolina v. United States (1912), where the Court struck down a federal law that required states to pass child labor laws, saying it was an unconstitutional exercise of authority over the states.

So, the statute is invalid because the federal government cannot compel states to pass their own legislation. This would make option I correct.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option G says it's invalid because the federal government can't force states to implement federal regulations. Option I says it's invalid because the feds can't compel state legislatures to enact a federal program. Both seem correct, but perhaps the wording is important. Option I is more specific about compelling state legislatures, which is exactly what the statute does.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is I. But another angle: the 21st Amendment allows states to regulate alcohol. So the federal law is trying to influence state regulation. But the problem is the methodâ€”mandating state action.

Wait, but the 21st Amendment says that the federal government can't prohibit alcohol, and states have the right to regulate. But does it give the federal government the power to require state action? I think not. So the issue is not about the 21st Amendment's substance but about the method of requiring state laws.

So the statute is invalid because the federal government can't force states to create their own agencies. So the answer is either G or I. Which one is more accurate?

In Printz v. United States, the Court struck down parts of the Brady handgun law that required state officials to perform background checks, saying it was an unconstitutional commandeering. Similarly, if the federal statute requires states to pass laws, that's a problem.

So the correct reason is that the federal government cannot compel states to pass legislation. Therefore, option I is correct.

The question revolves around whether a federal statute requiring states to establish "watchdog" agencies to monitor underage drinking is constitutional. The core issue is whether the federal government can compel states to pass their own legislation. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers to the states, and the Supreme Court has ruled against the federal government forcing states to implement federal regulations. In cases like *Printz v. United States* and *South Carolina v. United States*, the Court struck down laws that required states to adopt federal mandates. Therefore, the statute is invalid because the federal government cannot compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.

Answer: I
