Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about corn height and polygenes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about two races of corn. One averages 48 inches, the other 72 inches. When they're crossed, the F1 generation's average height is 60 inches. That makes sense because 60 is exactly the midpoint between 48 and 72. So, the average of the parents is 60, which the F1 matches.

Now, when they look at 500 F1 plants, only two are 48 and two are 72. The rest are in between. So, the F1 plants don't show much variation, which suggests that the traits are blending, but wait, in Mendelian genetics, blending isn't typical except in certain cases like with quantitative traits. Oh right, this is about polygenes, which control traits that have a range of variation rather than being simply dominant or recessive.

Polygenes are multiple genes that each contribute a small amount to the trait. So each gene might add a little bit to the height. Since the F1 plants are averaging 60, which is the mean of the parents, but there's some variation, but not too much. The variation in F1 suggests that the extreme parents (48 and 72) are rare, which probably means that each gene has a small effect.

So, how do we figure out how many polygenes are involved and how much each contributes? Let's think about the total difference between the two parent races. The difference is 72 - 48 = 24 inches. Now, if each polygene contributes a certain amount, say 'x' inches, then the total number of genes multiplied by x should equal the total difference.

But wait, the F1 average is exactly halfway, 60. So the parents are 48 and 72, which are 24 apart. So each parent might have a certain number of dominant or recessive alleles contributing to the height. If the F1 is the average, it's like each gene in the F1 is contributing the average of the parents' alleles.

Wait, but since it's polygenic, each gene contributes a little. So if each gene adds 'a' inches when present, then the parents would have different numbers of these additive genes.

Let me think: Let's say each gene contributes 'a' inches. The tall parent (72) has more 'a's than the short parent (48). Let's denote the number of polygenes as 'n'. So the tall parent would have more dominant alleles, maybe n times a equals 72 minus the average? Wait, no, perhaps each gene's effect is additive, so total effect is sum of individual contributions.

Wait, the average of the parents is (48 + 72)/2 = 60. So the F1 average is 60. But the F1 plants have some variation, but most are around 60. The two extremes are 48 and 72, which probably come from homozygous recessive and dominant for all the polygenes.

Wait, but in reality, each gene might have two alleles, each contributing a certain amount. So, for each gene, say the allele adds 'a' inches when present. The tall parent would have all dominant alleles, so n*a = 72. The short parent would have all recessive, so 0*a = 48? That can't be right because 72 = n*a and 48 would have 0*a, but that would imply 48 is the minimum, but 72 is the maximum.

Wait, maybe each gene contributes a certain amount when present. So for each gene, the dominant allele adds 'a' and the recessive adds 'b'. But if it's additive, perhaps each dominant allele adds some value, and recessive adds less. So the total height would be the sum across all genes of the alleles present.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene has two alleles, each contributing a certain amount. Let's say each gene's dominant allele contributes 'd' inches, and the recessive contributes 'r' inches. So for each gene, the two parents would have either two dominants (DD), two recessives (rr), or some combination, but since the parents are pure lines, probably homozygous.

Wait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to think that each gene contributes a certain amount, say each gene contributes 'x' inches when present. So the tall parent has n*x = 72, and the short parent has 0*x = 48? That can't be because 72 and 48 are the max and min. Wait, that can't work because 72 -48=24, which would be the total contribution from all genes.

So, if each gene contributes x inches, then n*x =24 inches. Because the difference between the parents is 24, and each gene accounts for x. So n = 24 / x.

But the F1 plants average 60, which is the mid-point. So each gene in the F1 would be contributing an average of each parent's alleles. So for each gene, the F1 would have one dominant and one recessive, so the average per gene is (x + 0)/2 = x/2, perhaps? Or maybe each gene's effect is additive, so each F1 has one dominant and one recessive, so each contributes 0.5x.

Wait, but if each gene's effect is additive, then the F1 would have a contribution per gene of (dominant + recessive)/2. If the dominant allele contributes x and the recessive 0, then each F1 would get x/2 per gene. So the total for F1 would be n*(x/2) = 60 inches.

But the tall parent has n*x =72, and the short has 0. So let's write the equations:

Tall parent: n*x =72
F1 average: n*(x/2) =60
Short parent: 0 =48 (but this doesn't make sense unless 48 is the base).

Wait, perhaps the base (like the minimum) is 48, and each gene adds x inches. So the tall parent has n*x =24 (because 72-48=24), and the F1 would have on average (n*x)/2 =12. So 48 +12=60. That makes sense.

So if each gene adds x inches, then:

n * x =24 (since 72-48=24)
And F1: n*(x/2)=12 → 48+12=60.

So from n*x=24, we can express x=24/n.

But the F1 plants' variation is minimal, which suggests that each gene's contribution is small, so n is large. Because if each gene contributes a small amount, the F1's variation would be around the mean, with not too many extremes.

In the problem, when they looked at 500 F1 plants, only two were 48 (probably homozygous recessive for all genes) and two were 72 (homozygous dominant). The rest are in between. So the number of possible combinations would depend on the number of genes. With more genes, the distribution would be more normal, and extreme phenotypes would be rare.

So how to find n and x?

We have n*x=24. And the F1's average is 60, which is 48 +12, so the additive effect from the F1's genes is 12. So 12= n*(x/2) → 12= (n*x)/2 → but n*x=24, so 12=24/2=12. So the equations are consistent.

But how do we find n and x? Well, the problem is asking for the number of polygenes and how much each contributes.

Looking at the options, each option gives a different n and x.

Let's see the options:

A: 11 genes, 2.2 each → 11*2.2=24.2, which is close to 24.

B:3 genes, 8 each →24, exactly.

C:5 genes,4.8 →5*4.8=24.

D:6 genes,4 →6*4=24.

E:12*2=24.

F:8*3=24.

G:7 *3.4=23.8≈24.

H:4*6=24.

I:9*2.7=24.3≈24.

J:10*2.4=24.

Wait, all options have n*x=24 except perhaps some rounding. So how do we pick between them?

The question is about the number of polygenes and the contribution per gene.

In real genetics, polygenes usually have many genes contributing small amounts. So a larger n and smaller x makes sense. Because with more genes, each gene's effect is smaller, leading to a smoother distribution and more normal distribution of traits, which matches the problem's description where only a few plants are at the extremes.

So among the options, A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J all have n*x=24. We need to choose the one with the highest n, which would give the smallest x.

Looking at the options:

A:11 genes, 2.2 each.

C:5,4.8.

D:6,4.

E:12,2.

F:8,3.

G:7,3.4.

H:4,6.

I:9,2.7.

J:10,2.4.

The highest n is E with 12 genes, each contributing 2 inches. That would be the case where each gene adds 2 inches, and 12 genes make up the 24-inch difference.

Wait, but let me think again. If each gene contributes 2 inches, then the tall parent has 12*2=24, so 48+24=72. That makes sense. The F1 would have on average 6 (since each gene contributes 1 inch on average), so 48+6=54? Wait, that doesn't fit because the F1 average is 60.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the base is 48, and each gene adds x. So the F1 would have n*(x/2) added to 48. So n*(x/2)=12 inches, because 48+12=60.

But n*x=24 (the difference between parents). So n*x=24, and n*(x/2)=12. So from the first equation, x=24/n. Substituting into the second: n*(24/(2n))=12 → 12=12. So it's consistent.

So any n that divides 24 would work, but the question is which n is more likely. Since the F1 has minimal variation, we expect many genes with small contributions. So higher n is better.

Looking at the options, E has 12 genes, each contributing 2 inches. That's a possible answer.

Another option is J:10 genes, 2.4 each. 10*2.4=24, yes.

Which is more likely? The question says the F1 plants don't vary much, so more genes would lead to less variance, as each gene's contribution is smaller.

But the options give E and J as possibilities. Let's check their x values.

E: 2 inches per gene.

J:2.4 inches per gene.

Wait, but more genes would mean each contributes less, so E with 12 genes (each 2 inches) might be better than J with 10 genes (each 2.4), because 12 is more than 10, leading to smaller contributions per gene.

Wait, but in the options, E is 12 genes, 2 inches each. So 12*2=24. That fits.

But wait, the problem states that in the F1, two plants are 48 and two are72, which suggests that the extreme phenotypes are possible, but rare. If each gene is contributing 2 inches, then a plant would need to have all 12 genes being recessive to be 48, and all dominant to be 72. So the probability of that happening is (0.5)^12 for each extreme, which is very rare, matching the observation of only two plants at each extreme out of 500.

So E seems plausible.

Wait, but let's check another option. Option J is 10 genes, 2.4 each. So 10*2.4=24.

In that case, the F1's average would be 10*(2.4/2)=12 inches above the base, so 48+12=60. That matches.

The probability of a plant being all recessive would be (0.5)^10, which is about 1 in 1024. So in 500 plants, we'd expect about 0.488 plants to be 48 inches. But the problem says two plants were 48. Hmm, that's a bit higher than expected with 10 genes. Let's see: 500*(1/1024) ≈0.488, so less than one. But the problem says two, which is more than that.

If we have 12 genes, the probability is (0.5)^12=1/4096. So in 500 plants, expected number is 500/4096≈0.122, so about 0.12, which is less than one. But the problem reports two, which is a bit more. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of polygenes is determined by how much each contributes, considering that the F1's variation is minimal.

Wait, maybe another approach. The F1 plants show a continuous distribution, but the extremes are rare. The fact that only a few are at the extremes suggests that the number of genes is such that the chance of all being recessive or dominant is low.

The more genes, the lower the probability of being all recessive or all dominant. So with more genes, the extremes are rarer, which matches the problem's data (only two 48 and two 72 in 500).

So 12 genes (option E) would make the extremes even rarer than 10 genes. So if 12 genes, the probability is (1/2)^12≈0.00024, so in 500 plants, about 500*0.00024=0.12, which is less than 1. But the problem has two at each extreme. So maybe 12 genes are too many, leading to too few extremes.

Alternatively, 10 genes (option J) would have a probability of (1/2)^10=0.000976. 500*0.000976≈0.488, so about 0.488, which is roughly half a plant. But the problem has two, which is about four times higher than expected.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the number of genes is determined by how much each contributes to the F1's average.

Wait, let's think differently. The F1 average is 60, which is the average of the parents. Each gene contributes x/2 on average. So the sum of all contributions is n*(x/2)=12 inches above the short parent's 48.

So n*(x/2)=12 → n*x=24.

And n*x=24, as before.

So any pair where n*x=24 is possible. Now, looking at the options, which one makes sense in terms of the F1's variation.

Another thought: the variance in the F1 generation. The variance is determined by the number of genes and the effect size. With more genes, the variance per gene is smaller, leading to a tighter distribution around the mean.

But perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the F1 average is the mean of the parents, and the variation is minimal, it suggests that each gene contributes a small amount, so more genes are involved.

Looking at the options, E is 12 genes, each 2 inches. That seems plausible because 12 is a reasonable number of genes for a polygenic trait, and each contributes a small amount.

Alternatively, option J is 10 genes, each 2.4 inches. That's also possible, but 2.4 is larger than 2, which would mean fewer genes could account for the same total difference.

But the question is about how many polygenes are involved. Typically, polygenic traits involve many genes, each with small effects. So 12 genes (E) or 10 genes (J) are both plausible, but 12 is higher.

Wait, but the problem states that the F1's height doesn't vary much, which aligns with more genes, each contributing less, leading to a narrower distribution around the mean.

So I think the correct answer is E: Twelve polygenes, 2 inches each.
</think>

The problem involves two races of corn with average heights of 48 inches and 72 inches. When crossed, the F1 generation averages 60 inches, which is the midpoint between the parents. The F1 plants show minimal variation, with only two plants at each extreme (48 and 72 inches) out of 500. This suggests a polygenic inheritance pattern, where multiple genes contribute small amounts to the trait.

The total difference between the parents is 24 inches (72 - 48). If each gene contributes \( x \) inches, the number of polygenes \( n \) satisfies \( n \cdot x = 24 \). The F1 average of 60 inches implies that each gene contributes an average of \( x/2 \) inches, as the F1 plants inherit one allele from each parent. Thus, \( n \cdot (x/2) = 12 \), confirming \( n \cdot x = 24 \).

To determine the number of polygenes and their contribution, the options are analyzed. All options satisfy \( n \cdot x = 24 \), but the number of genes and the size of each contribution vary. Polygenic traits typically involve many genes with small effects, so a higher \( n \) and smaller \( x \) are more plausible. Among the options, **E (12 genes, 2 inches each)** fits this pattern, as it involves the largest number of genes, each contributing a small amount. This also aligns with the observation of minimal variation in the F1 generation, as more genes reduce the likelihood of extreme phenotypes.

Thus, the most reasonable answer is:

**E: Twelve polygenes, 2 inches each.**
