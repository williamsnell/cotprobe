Question:

A large island is devastated by a volcanic eruption. Most of the horses die except for the heaviest males and heaviest females of the group. They survive, reproduce, and perpetuate the population. Since weight is highly heritable and the distribution of weights approximates a binomial distribution, the offspring of the next generation would be expected to have

Options:

A: a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population
B: the same mean weight as members of the original population
C: a lower mean weight compared with their parents
D: the same mean weight as their parents
E: a lower mean weight compared with members of the original population
F: a greater range of weights compared to the original population
G: a weight distribution skewed towards lighter weights

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about natural selection and population genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that a large island is hit by a volcanic eruption, and most of the horses die except for the heaviest males and females. These survivors then reproduce and continue the population. The key points here are that weight is highly heritable and that the weight distribution follows a binomial distribution. I need to figure out what the offspring of the next generation would look like in terms of their mean weight compared to the original population.

First, I remember that natural selection acts on the variation present in a population. In this case, the survivors are the heaviest individuals—both males and females. So, if only the heaviest survive and reproduce, the genes related to being heavier are passed on to the next generation.

Now, thinking about heritability: since weight is highly heritable, the offspring will tend to have weights similar to their parents. That means the next generation's average weight should be higher than the original population because the parents are the heaviest. 

Wait, but the question mentions that the distribution approximates a binomial distribution. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. A binomial distribution is typically used for binary outcomes, like success or failure, but maybe in this context it's referring to a distribution with a certain shape, perhaps not as extreme as a normal distribution. Or perhaps it's just a way to say that the weights are distributed in a certain manner, maybe with a bell curve.

In any case, if the parents are the heaviest, their offspring will on average be heavier than the original population. Because the survivors have higher weights, their genes will contribute more to the gene pool of the next generation. So the mean weight of the next generation should be higher than the original.

Looking at the options:

A says higher mean than original—this seems likely.
B says same mean as original—unlikely, because the parents are heavier.
C says lower than their parents—no, the parents are the heaviest, so the offspring would be similar.
D same as parents—maybe, but since the parents are a subset, perhaps the mean would stay same, but I think it's higher.
Wait, but wait. The original population's mean was based on all horses, including lighter ones. The survivors are heavier than the original mean. So their offspring would have a mean based on the survivors' mean, which is higher. So the next generation's mean would be higher than the original.

So options A and E are about comparison to the original. E says lower, which doesn't make sense because the parents are heavier. So the next generation's mean should be higher.

Wait, but let me think again. The parents are a subset of the original population—those that survived. If the original population had a certain mean, the survivors (the heaviest) would have a mean higher than the original. Their offspring would inherit genes for higher weight, so the next generation's mean would be higher than the original. So the answer should be A.

But wait, another angle: if the population was under selection, the mean could shift. In directional selection, the mean moves towards the advantageous trait, which in this case is higher weight. So the next generation's mean would be higher.

Wait, but I thought that if you have a binomial distribution, maybe it's a discrete trait, but weight is a continuous trait. Hmm, maybe the binomial part is a distractor here. The key is that the survivors are heavier, so their offspring will have higher average.

So putting it all together, the answer is A: a higher mean weight compared with the original population.

The question involves a volcanic eruption that devastates a population of horses, leaving only the heaviest males and females to survive and reproduce. Weight is highly heritable, and the distribution of weights approximates a binomial distribution. The key is to determine the mean weight of the next generation compared to the original population.

Since the survivors are the heaviest individuals, their genes for higher weight are passed on to their offspring. This indicates that the next generation's mean weight will be influenced by the survivors' higher weights. The original population's mean weight includes all horses, including lighter ones, whereas the survivors' mean weight is higher. Therefore, the offspring of the next generation are expected to have a higher mean weight compared to the original population.

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Correct, as the next generation's mean weight will be higher than the original population.
- **B**, **C**, **E**, and **G**: These options suggest no increase or a decrease in mean weight, which contradicts the scenario where only the heaviest survive.
- **D**: Suggests the same mean as the parents, but since the parents are a subset with higher weights, the next generation's mean will be higher than the original population.
- **F**: Refers to the range of weights, which is not directly addressed in the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the next generation's mean weight will be higher than the original population.

Answer: A
