Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with a defendant's attorney trying to prevent the prosecution from questioning a witness about a prior conviction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario is about a robbery trial. The defendant's attorney wants to call a witness, and it's relevant that nine years ago, this witness was convicted of misdemeanor battery. The attorney has filed a motion to disallow the prosecution from bringing up this prior conviction. The question is whether this motion will likely be granted or denied, and why.

I remember that in criminal trials, the credibility of witnesses is a key factor. Both the defense and the prosecution can attack a witness's credibility if it's relevant. So, the defense is trying to call this witness, and the prosecution probably wants to impeach the witness's credibility by bringing up the prior conviction because it could make the witness seem less trustworthy.

Now, the issue here is whether the prosecution can inquire about this prior misdemeanor. I think the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) come into play here. Specifically, FRE 609 deals with the impeachment of a witness by evidence of a criminal conviction. Under 609(a), a witness's prior conviction can be used to impeach their credibility if the conviction is for a crime that's a felony or is a crime of dishonesty, regardless of whether it's a felony or misdemeanor. 

Wait, but battery is usually a misdemeanor. So, does a misdemeanor count? Let me think. Under FRE 609(a)(2), the rule applies to any crime for which the witness was convicted, whether it's a felony or misdemeanor, but only if the conviction is admissible. However, the rule also says that a witness may be impeached by any evidence of a prior conviction, but the court has discretion to exclude it if it's more prejudicial than probative.

So, the defense is trying to prevent the prosecution from asking about this prior conviction. The motion is to disallow that questioning. The question is whether the court will grant or deny that motion.

If the prior conviction is a misdemeanor, does it fall under 609? Because 609(a)(2) says that any conviction (felony or misdemeanor) can be used to impeach, but the court can exclude it if the prejudice outweighs the probative value. So, the court has discretion.

In this case, the witness is being called by the defense. The prosecution wants to impeach the witness. The defense is arguing that the prosecution shouldn't be allowed to do so. So, the motion is to exclude the prosecution from bringing up the prior conviction.

The options given are from A to I. Let's look at them.

Option A: Denied because the conviction is relevant to credibility. That seems correct because prior convictions are generally relevant to credibility, but I think the court has discretion under 609 to exclude it if it's more prejudicial than probative.

Option B: Denied because the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party. That's true in general, but again, the court can limit how it's attacked. So just because it can be attacked doesn't mean the court must allow it.

Option C:Granted because the prejudice to the defendant outweighs the probative value. Wait, but the witness is a defense witness. So, the prejudice would be to the defense if the witness's credibility is damaged. The defendant's credibility is at stake because their witness could be impeached, but the question is whether the prosecution can do that. The court would weigh whether the prior conviction's probative value (in impeaching the witness) outweighs the prejudice to the defense.

Option D:Denied because it's a matter of public record. Well, prior convictions are public, but that's more about whether the conviction can be used, not necessarily about whether the court allows it. So this might not be the main reason.

Option E:Granted as a matter of right. I don't think so because the motion is about excluding evidence, which is usually discretionary unless there's a clear rule.

Option F:Denied because the motion wasn't timely. The question doesn't mention anything about the timing, so I can probably ignore this unless it's relevant.

Option G:Denied because less than 10 years have passed. I'm not sure about a 10-year rule off the top of my head. Maybe some states have a rule about the time since conviction, but under federal law, FRE 609 doesn't impose a time limit. So this might not be the case.

Option H:Granted because the witness's past has no bearing. That's not true because prior convictions do bear on credibility.

Option I:Granted because the conviction isn't related. Well, battery is a crime that could relate to credibility, even if it's a misdemeanor.

So, the key points are: the prosecution can impeach the witness with prior convictions under FRE 609, but the court can exclude it if the prejudice outweighs the probative value.

In this case, the prior conviction is a misdemeanor battery. The question is whether the court will exclude it. The defense's motion is to disallow the prosecution from questioning about it.

If the court finds that the probative value (impeaching the witness) is outweighed by the prejudice (the witness's credibility being damaged, which could harm the defense's case), then the motion would be granted. But if the court thinks it's still more probative than prejudicial, it would be denied.

Looking at the options, option C says the motion will be granted because the prejudice to the defendant outweighs the probative value. But wait, the defendant is the one calling the witness, and if the witness's credibility is impeached, that would harm the defendant's case. So the prejudice is to the defense, but the court is considering whether the probative value (impeachment) is worth the prejudice.

Option A says the motion is denied because the conviction is relevant to credibility. That's a correct statement, but the court can still exclude it under 609(b) if it's more prejudicial than probative.

So, the court's decision hinges on whether they think the prior conviction's use is more harmful than helpful. If the court decides that it's not necessary or that it would unfairly prejudice the defendant, they might grant the motion.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, under 609(a), any prior conviction can be used, but the court can exclude it if it's a misdemeanor not involving dishonesty or was more than 10 years ago. Wait, no, 609(a)(2) allows for any prior conviction, regardless of being a felony or misdemeanor, to be used to impeach. So the fact that it's a misdemeanor doesn't change that it's admissible, but the court can still exclude it if it's more prejudicial than probative.

So, the court may deny the motion unless the prejudice outweighs the probative value. But in this case, the prior conviction is for battery, which is a crime that could affect credibility, but it's a misdemeanor. So the court might still allow it, making the motion denied.

Wait, but the defense is moving to disallow the prosecution from questioning. So if the court finds that the prior conviction is admissible, the motion would be denied. If the court finds it inadmissible, the motion would be granted.

So, which is more likely? Well, under 609, the prior conviction is admissible for impeachment unless the court finds it's more prejudicial than probative. So unless there's a strong reason to exclude it, the motion would likely be denied.

Looking at the options, option A says denied because the conviction is relevant to credibility. That seems correct because prior convictions are generally relevant, so the court would deny the motion unless it's excluded under 609(b).

Alternatively, option C says granted because prejudice outweighs probative value. That would depend on the court's discretion. But the question is about what the motion will likely be. I think the default is that the court allows it, so the motion is denied.

So, option A says the motion is denied because the conviction is relevant to credibility. That seems correct because prior convictions are relevant for impeachment.

The question revolves around whether the prosecution can impeach a defense witness with a prior misdemeanor conviction for battery. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 609, prior convictions are generally admissible for impeachment purposes, but the court has discretion to exclude them if the prejudice outweighs the probative value. 

In this case, the defense is arguing that the prosecution should not be allowed to question the witness about the prior conviction. The key consideration is whether the court will grant or deny the motion based on the balance between the probative value (impeaching the witness) and the potential prejudice to the defense.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that the motion is denied because the conviction is relevant to the witness's credibility. Prior convictions are typically relevant for impeachment, and the court would likely deny the motion unless there is a strong reason to exclude it.
- **Option C** suggests the motion is granted because the prejudice outweighs the probative value. While this is a possibility under 609, the question asks what the motion "will likely" be. Given that prior convictions are generally admissible, the motion is more likely to be denied.
- Other options either misstate the law or are irrelevant to the specific issue.

Given the general rule that prior convictions are admissible for impeachment unless excluded by the court, the motion is likely to be denied.
