Okay, so I've got this question about traces of matrices and their properties. I'm a bit rusty on linear algebra, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question states: Suppose A and B are n×n matrices with real entries. Which of the following are true? The options are I, II, III.

Let me break down each statement one by one.

Statement I: The trace of A² is nonnegative.

Hmm, the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. Now, A² is A multiplied by itself. I remember that the trace has some properties, like trace(AB) = trace(BA), but what about trace(A²)? 

Wait, A² is a square of the matrix A. The trace of A² is the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues of A, because for a matrix, the trace of A^k is the sum of the k-th powers of its eigenvalues. So if λ is an eigenvalue of A, then λ² is an eigenvalue of A². So trace(A²) would be the sum of λ² for each eigenvalue λ of A.

But wait, the eigenvalues can be complex, right? Oh, but A has real entries, so its complex eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs. So when you square them, like (a + bi)² = a² - b² + 2abi, and (a - bi)² = a² - b² - 2abi. Adding them together, the imaginary parts cancel out, so each pair contributes 2*(a² - b²) to the trace. 

But what's the real part? Well, each squared term, whether real or complex, contributes something. But wait, if A is a real matrix, its eigenvalues can be real or come in complex conjugate pairs. So when you square each eigenvalue, the trace is the sum of all these squared eigenvalues. 

But wait, could the sum be negative? Let me think of an example. Suppose A is a diagonal matrix with entries -1 and 1. Then A² would be diagonal with 1 and 1. The trace is 2, which is positive. Another example: if A is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues i and -i. Then A² would have eigenvalues (-1) and (-1), because (i)^2 = -1. So the trace would be -2, which is negative. 

Wait, but wait, can a real matrix have eigenvalues i and -i? Yes, because for real matrices, complex eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs. So in that case, the trace of A² would be (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is negative. That would make statement I false. But wait, is that correct?

Hold on, let me check. Let's take a specific matrix. Consider A = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]. This is a real matrix, and its eigenvalues are i and -i because the characteristic equation is λ² + 1 = 0. So A² is [[-1, 0], [0, -1]], so the trace is -2. So yes, trace(A²) can be negative. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true. So I is false.

Wait, but earlier I thought that trace(A²) is the sum of squares of eigenvalues, but in this case, the sum is -2, which is negative. So statement I is false. So I can eliminate options that have I as true, like A, B, C, D, E, H, etc.

But wait, the initial analysis was that statement I is false because I found a counterexample where trace(A²) is negative. So I can't choose any option that includes I as true.

Now, statement II: If A² = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.

A² = A implies that A is an idempotent matrix. Idempotent matrices have eigenvalues 0 and 1 because if you take A² = A, then (A - I)A = 0, so the eigenvalues satisfy λ² = λ, which gives λ=0 or λ=1.

So the trace of A is the sum of its eigenvalues, each of which is either 0 or 1. So the trace is nonnegative because it's a sum of non-negative numbers (0 and 1). So statement II is true.

Statement III: The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.

I remember that trace(AB) is not generally equal to trace(A) * trace(B). Let me think of a counterexample.

Take A as a 2x2 matrix with trace(A) = a, and B as another 2x2 matrix with trace(B) = b. Let's see what trace(AB) is.

Alternatively, take specific matrices. Let A be [[1, 0], [0, 0]], so trace(A) = 1. Let B be [[0, 0], [0, 1]], so trace(B) = 1. Then AB is [[0,1],[0,0]], so trace(AB) = 0. But trace(A)*trace(B) = 1*1=1. So trace(AB) = 0 ≠ 1. Therefore, statement III is false.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Alternatively, let A and B both be identity matrices. Then AB is identity, and trace(AB) = n, while trace(A) = n and trace(B) = n, so their product is n², which is larger than n for n>1. So in that case, trace(AB) is not equal to the product of the traces. Hence, statement III is false.

So now, evaluating the statements:

I: False

II: True

III: False

Looking back at the options:

The options are A through J. The statements are:

I: False

II: True

III: False

So which option matches this? Let's see the options:

A: All of them - no

B: I, II, III - no

C: I only - no

D: I and III only - no

E: II, III, I - no

F: III only - no

G: II only - yes, because II is true, I and III are false.

H: I and II only - no, because I is false

I: II and III only - no, because III is false

J: None of them - no, because II is true.

So the correct answer is G: II only.

The analysis shows that only statement II is true, while I and III are false.
