Okay, so I have this problem here about Grady and his little brother Noah riding their bikes. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says Grady rides 60% faster than Noah. Hmm, I remember that when something is 60% faster, it means his speed is 160% of the other person's speed. So if Noah's speed is, say, N mph, then Grady's speed would be N plus 60% of N, which is 1.6 * N. That makes sense because 60% faster means adding 60% of the original speed to itself.

Next, the problem states that Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in two hours. Wait, so both of them are riding for two hours, but Grady covers 12 extra miles. I need to find out how fast Noah is riding. 

Let me assign variables to make this clearer. Let's let N be Noah's speed in mph. Then Grady's speed is 1.6 * N. 

Now, distance is speed multiplied by time. So in two hours, Noah would have ridden a distance of N * 2, which is 2N miles. Similarly, Grady would have ridden 1.6N * 2, which is 3.2N miles. 

The difference between the distances they rode is 12 miles. So, Grady's distance minus Noah's distance equals 12. That gives me the equation:

3.2N - 2N = 12

Let me compute that. 3.2N minus 2N is 1.2N. So:

1.2N = 12

To find N, I divide both sides by 1.2. 

N = 12 / 1.2

Hmm, what's 12 divided by 1.2? Let me think. 12 divided by 1 is 12. Divided by 1.2, it's like dividing by 6/5, so multiplying by 5/6. So 12 * (5/6) is 10. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, that can't be right. Let me double-check. 

Alternatively, 1.2 times 10 is 12, because 1.2 * 10 = 12. So N equals 10. So Noah's speed is 10 mph. 

Let me cross-verify. If Noah is 10 mph, then Grady is 1.6 * 10 = 16 mph. In two hours, Noah rides 20 miles, Grady rides 32 miles. The difference is 32 - 20 = 12 miles. That matches the problem statement. 

So the correct answer should be option I, which is 10. 

Wait, looking back at the options, option I is 10. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is I.

Grady's speed is 1.6 times Noah's speed. Let N be Noah's speed. Grady rides 3.2N miles in 2 hours, Noah rides 2N miles. The difference is 1.2N = 12 â†’ N = 10. 

Answer: I
