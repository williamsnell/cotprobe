Okay, so I've got this problem about a satellite's path given by parametric equations, and I need to find the upward velocity at t=1. Hmm, parametric equations usually involve x and y as functions of a parameter, which here is t. The equations are x = 4 cos(t) + cos(12t) and y = 4 sin(t) + sin(12t). 

Wait, velocity. Right, velocity in parametric equations is found by taking the derivatives of x and y with respect to t. So the velocity vector is (dx/dt, dy/dt). But the question is asking for the upward velocity, which I think refers to the vertical component, so that would be dy/dt evaluated at t=1.

Alright, let's start by finding dy/dt. The equation for y is y = 4 sin(t) + sin(12t). Taking the derivative with respect to t, dy/dt = 4 cos(t) - 12 cos(12t). Wait, because the derivative of sin(at) is a cos(at), right? So for 4 sin(t), the derivative is 4 cos(t), and for sin(12t), it's 12 cos(12t), but because it's positive in y, the derivative is +12 cos(12t). Wait no, wait, let me think again. Wait, yes, because the derivative of sin(12t) is 12 cos(12t). So dy/dt should be 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the function is y =4 sin t + sin(12t). So derivative is dy/dt = 4 cos t + 12 cos(12t) * (d/dt)(12t) which is 12 cos(12t). So yes, dy/dt = 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a negative sign, like if it's sin(kt), the derivative is k cos(kt). So here, since it's 4 sin(t), the derivative is 4 cos(t). And sin(12t) differentiates to 12 cos(12t). So yes, dy/dt is 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t).

Now, I need to evaluate this at t=1. So plugging t=1 into dy/dt. Let me compute 4 cos(1) + 12 cos(12*1), which is 4 cos(1) + 12 cos(12).

I need to calculate these values. Let me get my calculator out. Wait, but I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can approximate or remember some values.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator function or think about the values.

Wait, cos(1 radian): I remember that cos(0) is 1, cos(π/2) is 0, so 1 radian is approximately 57 degrees. The cosine of 57 degrees is roughly 0.54. Let me check: cos(1) ≈ 0.5403.

Similarly, cos(12 radians). Wait, 12 radians is a lot more than 2π, which is about 6.283. So 12 is about 1.91 full rotations. Let me see, 12 radians is 12 - 2π*1 = 12 -6.283=5.717, then 5.717 - 2π≈5.717 -6.283= -0.566 radians. So cos(12) is the same as cos(-0.566) because cosine is even. Cos(-0.566)=cos(0.566). 0.566 radians is about 32.4 degrees. Cos(32.4 degrees) is approximately 0.844. So cos(12)≈0.84385.

So now, plugging back in: 4 * 0.5403 ≈ 2.1612. And 12 * 0.84385 ≈ 10.1262.

Adding them together: 2.1612 +10.1262 ≈12.2874.

Wait, but wait a second, the options include 12.287 as option I. But the question is about upward velocity, which is dy/dt, so according to my calculation, it's approximately 12.287. So the answer would be option I.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 12.287 is a high value. Let me see, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating cos(12). Let me recompute cos(12 radians).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute cos(12) more accurately. Let me compute 12 mod 2π. 2π≈6.283185307.

12 divided by 6.283185307 is about 1.9101, so 1.9101 * 2π= about 12 radians. So to find cos(12), I can subtract 2π once: 12 - 2π ≈5.7168 radians. Then 5.7168 - 2π≈5.7168-6.2832≈-0.5664 radians. So cos(-0.5664)=cos(0.5664). Now, 0.5664 radians is about 32.4 degrees, and cos(32.4 degrees) is indeed approximately 0.844. So 12 * 0.844≈10.128.

So 4 cos(1)=4 *0.5403≈2.1612, plus 12 cos(12)=12*0.844≈10.128. Sum is 2.1612 +10.128≈12.2892, which is approximately 12.287, matching option I.

Wait, but the upward velocity being 12.287 seems high. Let me check if I took the correct derivative. The parametric equation for y is y =4 sin(t) + sin(12t). So dy/dt=4 cos(t) +12 cos(12t). Yes, that's correct. So the derivative at t=1 is 4 cos(1) +12 cos(12). So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 12.287. So that's the answer.

To find the upward velocity of the satellite at \( t = 1 \), we need to compute the derivative of the \( y \)-component of the parametric equation with respect to \( t \). The parametric equation for \( y \) is given by:

\[
y = 4 \sin(t) + \sin(12t)
\]

Taking the derivative with respect to \( t \):

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = 4 \cos(t) + 12 \cos(12t)
\]

Next, evaluate this derivative at \( t = 1 \):

\[
\frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{t=1} = 4 \cos(1) + 12 \cos(12)
\]

Using approximations for the cosine values:
- \( \cos(1) \approx 0.5403 \)
- \( \cos(12) \approx 0.84385 \) (since \( 12 \) radians is equivalent to \( -0.5664 \) radians modulo \( 2\pi \), and \( \cos(-0.5664) = \cos(0.5664) \approx 0.84385 \))

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{t=1} = 4(0.5403) + 12(0.84385) \approx 2.1612 + 10.1262 \approx 12.2874
\]

Thus, the upward velocity at \( t = 1 \) is approximately \( 12.287 \), which corresponds to option I.
