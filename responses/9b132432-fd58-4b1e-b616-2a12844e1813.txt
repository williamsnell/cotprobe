Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question here about Mr. I.F. Sarbo who bought a fire insurance policy for his home. The annual premium is $32, and he purchased it on July 17th. Then he canceled the policy on September 22nd. The question is asking how much refund he would get. The options are from A to J, with various amounts.

Alright, I need to figure out how much of the premium he's entitled to get back. Since it's an annual policy, the premium is for a year, but he's only had it for a certain period before canceling. So the refund should be based on how much of the year has passed and how much is remaining.

First, I should calculate the number of days he was covered. The policy was active from July 17 to September 22. Let's break it down month by month.

July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is how many days? Let's count. The 17th is the purchase day, so the first day is the 17th, meaning the days covered in July are from the 17th to the 31st. That's 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Wait, because if you include both the 17th and 31st, it's 15 days.

Then, August has 31 days. Since he didn't cancel in August, he was covered the entire month. So that's 31 days.

Then September: he canceled on the 22nd. So from September 1st to the 22nd, that's 22 days. But wait, does the policy get prorated up to the day of cancellation, or is it up to the end of the month? Hmm, usually, when you cancel a policy, you're prorated up to the day of cancellation. So from September 1 to September 22 is 22 days.

So total days covered would be 15 (July) + 31 (August) + 22 (September) = 68 days.

Wait, but let me double-check that. July 17 to July 31: 17th is day 1, so 31-17+1 = 15 days. August is 31 days, September is 22 days. So 15 + 31 + 22 = 68 days.

Now, the annual premium is $32, which covers 365 days. So the daily rate would be $32 / 365 = let's calculate that. $32 divided by 365 is approximately $0.08767 per day.

So the total cost covered is 68 days * $0.08767 ≈ $6. So the amount he paid for the 68 days is about $6. But wait, let me do the math more accurately.

$32 divided by 365 is exactly $32/365 = $0.08767123287 per day.

Multiply that by 68 days: 68 * 0.08767123287 ≈ let's calculate.

0.08767123287 * 60 = 5.260273972
0.08767123287 * 8 = 0.701369863
Adding them together: 5.260273972 + 0.701369863 ≈ 5.961643835, which is approximately $5.96.

So he's paid about $5.96 so far. Therefore, the refund should be the total premium minus what he's already paid. $32 - $5.96 = $26.04. Hmm, but none of the options are $26.04. That suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is based on a 360-day year, which some insurance companies use. Let me try that. 360 days for the annual premium.

$32 / 360 = $0.088888 per day. So 68 days would be 68 * 0.088888 ≈ $6.055555, which is about $6.06. So the refund would be $32 - $6.06 ≈ $25.94, which is still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is based on the remaining months. Let me think differently. Perhaps the policy is prorated monthly. Let's see, the policy was active for July, August, and part of September.

July: from the 17th, so half the month? Or is it prorated based on the days? Maybe the company prorates each month based on the days the policy was in effect.

So July: 15 days, August: 31 days, September: 22 days. Total days: 68.

Another approach: calculate the fraction of the year he's been covered. 68 days / 365 = approximately 0.1863, or about 18.63% of the year. So the portion he's paid is 18.63% of $32, which is 0.1863 *32≈ $5.96. So again, the refund would be $32 - $5.96 ≈ $26.04, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the policy is prorated based on the months, not days. Let's see: July has 31 days, so if he started on the 17th, maybe they prorate the first month. So July would be 15 days, which is half a month. Then August is full, September is 22 days, which is about two-thirds of the month. Or perhaps they prorate each month as a full month if it's over 15 days? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the company prorates each month as a full month if the policy is in effect for any part of it. So July: full month, August: full month, September: partial.

But that doesn't make sense. Let me check the options again. The options are A:12, B:14.72, C:6.44, D:16.64, E:32, F:22.72, G:24, H:9.28, I:19.68, J:18.36.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the days from July 17 to September 22, inclusive? Let me recount the days.

July: 17-31 is 15 days (including both 17 and 31)
August: 31 days
September: 1-22 is 22 days
Total: 15+31+22=68 days.

If the annual policy is 365 days, then the fraction is 68/365. The amount paid is 68/365 *32. So 68*32=2176; 2176/365≈5.96. So refund is 32-5.96=26.04.

But none of the options are near 26. The closest higher option is G:24, but that's still off. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates the refund based on the remaining days after the policy is canceled. So from September 22 to the end of the policy period, which is the next July 17? Wait, no, the policy is annual, so it's from July 17 to July 17 next year. So the time from September 22 to July 17 next year is how many days?

Wait, perhaps that's the approach. Let me calculate the days remaining from September 22 to July 17.

From September 22 to end of September: 30-22=8 days (since September has 30 days), but wait, September has 30 days, so from 22 to 30 is 9 days (including the 22nd? Or not? Wait, if he cancels on the 22nd, does that mean he's covered up to the 22nd, so the remaining days would be from 23rd onwards. So from Sep 23 to July 17.

Let me calculate the days from Sep 23, 2023, to July 17, 2024.

Sep: 23-30 is 8 days (30-22=8? Wait, Sep 23 is day 1, so 30-22=8 days left in Sep? Wait, Sep has 30 days. From Sep 23 to Sep 30 is 8 days (23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30: that's 8 days).

October:31, November:30, December:31, January:31, February:28 (assuming not a leap year), March:31, April:30, May:31, June:30, July:17.

So total days:

Sep:8
Oct:31
Nov:30
Dec:31
Jan:31
Feb:28
Mar:31
Apr:30
May:31
Jun:30
Jul:17

Adding these up:

8 +31=39
+30=69
+31=100
+31=131
+28=159
+31=190
+30=220
+31=251
+30=281
+17=298 days.

So from Sep 22 cancellation, the remaining period is 298 days. So the total days covered would be 365 - 298 = 67 days. Wait, that's different from the earlier 68 days. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.

Wait, when calculating the days from July 17 to Sep 22, inclusive, I got 68 days. But if the policy is annual, from July 17 to July 17 next year, then the days covered would be from July 17 to Sep 22, which is 68 days, and the remaining days would be 365 -68=297 days. Wait, but in the previous calculation, I got 298 days when considering from Sep 22 to July 17. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a 360-day year for calculation. Let's try that approach.

360 days per year. He was covered for 68 days, so the portion paid is 68/360 *32 = (68*32)/360 ≈2176/360≈5.99. So refund is 32 -5.99≈26.01. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates the premium monthly. So each month is considered as 30 days. Let me see.

July:15 days, so half a month. August:30 days, September:22 days, which is about 2/3 of a month.

So total months covered: 0.5 (July) +1 (August) +0.7333 (September)=2.2333 months.

The annual premium is $32, so per month it's $32/12≈$2.6667 per month.

So the amount paid would be 2.2333 *2.6667≈5.96. Again, same as before. Refund is $26.04.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the policy was canceled on September 22, so the proration is based on the days up to that day, and the refund is the remaining days. So perhaps the company calculates the refund as (remaining days / total days) * premium.

So remaining days from Sep 22 to July 17 next year: let's calculate that correctly.

From Sep 22 to Sep 30: 9 days (including 22nd? Or not? If he cancels on 22nd, he's covered up to that day, so the remaining days start from Sep 23.

So Sep 23 to Sep 30: 8 days.

Then Oct:31, Nov:30, Dec:31, Jan:31, Feb:28, Mar:31, Apr:30, May:31, Jun:30, Jul:17.

Adding these:8+31=39 +30=69 +31=100 +31=131 +28=159 +31=190 +30=220 +31=251 +30=281 +17=298 days.

So remaining days:298 days.

Total days in policy:365.

So the fraction is 298/365. So the refund is (298/365)*32.

Let me calculate that:298 ÷365 ≈0.8164.

0.8164 *32≈26.125, which is approximately $26.13. But again, no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps the company doesn't prorate the last month if the policy is canceled before the 15th. Or perhaps they prorate based on the exact days but in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the company uses a different method, like pro-rating based on the exact days in each month.

Let me try that.

July:15 days (17-31)
August:31
September:22

Total:68 days.

So 68/365 = 0.1863.

So amount paid:0.1863 *32≈5.96.

Refund:32 -5.96≈26.04.

Still no matching option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the policy is prorated quarterly. Let me see.

July is part of Q3, which runs from July 1 to Sep 30. If he cancels on Sep 22, he's covered for part of Q3 and part of Q4.

But this seems more complicated, and I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the company calculates the refund based on the number of full months covered plus a prorated last month.

July:15 days, so half a month.

August:31 days, full month.

September:22 days, about 2/3 of a month.

So total:0.5 +1 +0.7333≈2.2333 months.

Annual premium is $32, so per month is $32/12≈$2.6667.

Amount paid:2.2333 *2.6667≈5.96.

Again, same result. Refund≈26.04.

But none of the options match. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at the options again. The options are A:12, B:14.72, C:6.44, D:16.64, E:32, F:22.72, G:24, H:9.28, I:19.68, J:18.36.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates but only gives back the unexpired period, so the refund would be (remaining days / total days) * premium.

So 298/365 *32≈26.12, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe they don't prorate the last partial month, so September only gets prorated up to the 22nd, but perhaps they don't count it as a full month. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is based on the exact days in each month, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the policy is prorated monthly, and each month is 30 days. So:

July:15 days → 0.5 months
August:30 days → 1 month
September:22 days → ~0.733 months
Total:0.5 +1 +0.733≈2.233 months.

So 2.233/12 = 0.1861 of the year.

0.1861 *32 ≈5.96. So refund≈32 -5.96≈26.04.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a 360-day year for calculation. So:

68 days covered.

68/360 =0.1889.

0.1889 *32≈6.04.

Refund:32 -6.04≈25.96, still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the company only prorates the first month and the last month, and full months in between. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the days. Let me recount the days from July 17 to Sep 22.

July:17-31 is 15 days (including both days)
August:31
September:1-22 is 22 days
Total:15+31+22=68 days.

So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the policy is prorated based on the exact days, but the refund is calculated as (365 -68)/365 *32.

So (365-68)=297 days.

297/365=0.8137.

0.8137 *32≈26.04, same as before.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is F:22.72 and G:24, but neither is close. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the policy was for a term, and the cancellation is mid-term, but perhaps the company doesn't prorate and just gives back the unused portion based on monthly rates.

Wait, perhaps the policy is paid monthly, and he paid for July, August, and part of September. But that's not the case here; it's an annual premium, so he paid all $32 upfront on July 17. So the refund is based on the time elapsed.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different method, like the pro rata calculation but based on exact days. Let me try using 365 days.

Total days:68.

So 68/365=0.1863.

Amount paid:0.1863*32≈5.96.

Refund:32-5.96≈26.04.

No option matches. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the policy was canceled on Sep 22, so the last day covered is Sep 21. Let me check that.

From July 17 to Sep 21.

July:15 days (17-31)
August:31
September:21
Total:15+31+21=67 days.

67/365≈0.1835.

0.1835*32≈5.87.

Refund:32 -5.87≈26.13.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company uses the exact number of days but in a way that the refund is based on the remaining days. So 365 -68=297 days.

So refund= (297/365)*32≈26.04.

No option matches.

Wait, maybe the company only gives back half the premium if canceled within the first half of the policy period. But 68 days is about 18.6% of the year, which is less than half, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the company gives a full refund if canceled within 14 days, but here it's more than that.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates based on the exact days but subtracts a cancellation fee. But the question doesn't mention any fees, so probably not.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial days calculation. Let me recount the days from July 17 to Sep 22.

July:17-31 is 15 days (including both)
August:31
September:1-22 is 22 days.
Total:15+31+22=68 days.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates the refund as the annual premium multiplied by the fraction of the year remaining after the cancellation date. So from Sep 22 to July 17 next year is 298 days, as calculated earlier. So 298/365=0.8164.

0.8164 *32≈26.125.

Still no option matches.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is option B:14.72, but that would imply he was covered for about half the year, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the company prorates based on the number of months, not days.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the policy was effective from July 17, and he canceled on Sep 22, so the number of months covered is July (part), August (full), September (part).

So July: half a month, August: full, September: half a month.

Total: 0.5 +1 +0.5=2 months.

So the amount paid would be 2/12 *32= (2*32)/12=64/12≈5.33.

Refund:32-5.33≈26.67. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps July has 15 days, which is half a month, September has 22 days, which is about 2/3 of a month.

So July:0.5, August:1, September:0.733.

Total:2.233 months.

2.233/12=0.1861.

0.1861*32≈5.96.

Again, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the company only prorates the first and last month, not the full months in between.

So July:15 days, which is half a month.

August: full month.

September:22 days, which is about 2/3 of a month.

So total:0.5 +1 +0.7=2.2 months.

2.2/12=0.1833.

0.1833*32≈5.866.

Refund≈32-5.866≈26.134.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates the last month but not the first. So July:15 days, which is half a month. August: full, September:22 days, which is 2/3.

So 0.5 +1 +0.7=2.2 months.

Again, same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the calculations are matching the options provided. Maybe I'm missing something in the question.

Wait, perhaps the policy was purchased on July 17, and the premium is $32 for the entire year. But perhaps the company prorates the premium based on the exact days, but only for the months he was covered, and the September is prorated as a full month if it's over 15 days.

Wait, another thought: sometimes insurance companies prorate the first month and the last month, but count full months in between. So July would be prorated, August is full, September is prorated.

So July:15 days, which is half a month.

August:31 days (full month).

September:22 days, which is 22/30=0.7333 of a month.

So total:0.5 +1 +0.7333≈2.2333 months.

So 2.2333/12=0.1861.

0.1861*32≈5.96.

So refund≈32-5.96≈26.04.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a 360-day year for proration. So 68 days covered.

68/360=0.1889.

0.1889*32≈6.04.

Refund≈32-6.04≈25.96.

Still no match.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest higher option is F:22.72, which is about 22.72. That's 32 -22.72=9.28, which is option H. Hmm, perhaps the company gives a 10% discount or something, but that's speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the days. Let me check using another method.

Another approach: calculate the number of months between July 17 and Sep 22.

July 17 to July 31:15 days.

August:31 days.

September:22 days.

Total:68 days.

Now, considering that each month is 30 days for proration.

July:15 days → 0.5 months.

August:31 days →1 month.

September:22 days →22/30≈0.733 months.

Total:0.5 +1 +0.733≈2.233 months.

So 2.233 months covered.

Annual premium:32, so per month:32/12≈2.6667.

Amount paid:2.233 *2.6667≈5.96.

Refund:32-5.96≈26.04.

Still no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates based on the number of days in the exact months, so July:31, August:31, September:30.

Wait, no, September has 30 or 31 days? Wait, September always has 30 days. Wait no, September has 30 days. Wait, no, September has 30 days. So from Sep 1 to Sep 30 is 30 days. But the policy was canceled on Sep 22, so 22 days.

So total days:15 (July) +31 (Aug) +22 (Sep)=68.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the company doesn't prorate and instead gives a pro rata refund based on the exact days, but only for the months he was covered, and the September is treated as a full month if over 15 days.

Wait, but 22 days is over 15, so September is counted as a full month.

So July:15 days → half month.

August:31 → full month.

September:22 → full month.

So total months:0.5 +1 +1=2.5 months.

2.5/12=0.2083.

0.2083*32≈6.666.

So refund:32-6.666≈25.33.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates each month as a full month if any part of the month is covered. So July: full month, August: full, September: full.

So 3 months covered.

3/12=0.25.

0.25*32=8.

Refund:32-8=24, which is option G.

But that seems high. Because he was only covered for 68 days, which is about 18.6% of the year, but treating it as 3 months (25%) would give a higher refund. So $24 is option G.

But is that correct? If the company counts any part of the month as a full month, then yes, he would get a refund for 3 months, which is $24. But that seems a bit generous.

Alternatively, perhaps the company prorates based on the exact days, but the calculation leads to $26, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B:14.72, but I'm not sure how that number is derived.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the company uses a daily rate and calculates the refund as the remaining days multiplied by the daily rate.

Daily rate:32/365≈0.08767.

Remaining days:365-68=297.

Refund:297 *0.08767≈26.04.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company doesn't prorate and instead gives back the remaining premium based on the exact days, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the company gives back the unused portion based on a quarterly calculation.

Wait, perhaps the premium is $32 for the year, which is $8 per quarter. If he cancels after the first quarter (July is part of Q3), but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the company calculates the refund as the number of days remaining multiplied by the daily rate, but perhaps I made a mistake in the days.

Wait, perhaps the policy was canceled on Sep 22, so the days covered are up to Sep 21. Let me try that.

July:15 days.

August:31.

September:21.

Total:15+31+21=67 days.

67/365=0.1835.

0.1835*32≈5.87.

Refund:32-5.87≈26.13.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates but subtracts a $10 administrative fee, but the question doesn't mention any fees.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method, like the last day method. So the refund is (365 -68 +1)/365 *32. Because including the cancellation day as covered.

So 365-68+1=298 days.

298/365≈0.8164.

0.8164*32≈26.125.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company rounds to the nearest dollar. So $26.04 would round to $26, but G is $24.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a 360-day year, so 68/360=0.1889.

0.1889*32≈6.04.

Refund:32-6.04≈25.96≈$26, but again, no option.

Wait, perhaps the company gives a prorated refund based on the exact days, but the calculation is done as (365 - days covered)/365 * premium.

So days covered=68.

365-68=297.

297/365=0.8137.

0.8137*32≈26.04.

No match.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again, and see which one is close to the $26 I'm getting. The options are:

A:12, B:14.72, C:6.44, D:16.64, E:32, F:22.72, G:24, H:9.28, I:19.68, J:18.36.

Wait, none of these are close to $26. So perhaps I'm missing something in the question.

Wait, perhaps the policy was purchased on July 17, and the next policy period starts on July 17 of the next year. So the time from July 17 to Sep 22 is 68 days. So the remaining period is 365-68=297 days.

So the refund would be (297/365)*32≈26.04.

But no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the company only gives back the unused portion based on the exact days, but perhaps I made a mistake in the daily rate.

Daily rate:32/365≈0.08767.

Refund:297 *0.08767≈26.04.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different method where the refund is calculated as the total premium minus the prorated portion based on the days covered, but perhaps the days are counted differently.

Wait, perhaps the policy was purchased on July 17, and the premium is for the entire year starting that day. So the days covered are from July 17 to Sep 22, which is 68 days. So the amount paid is (68/365)*32≈5.96, so refund is 32-5.96≈26.04.

But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates the premium based on the number of months, not days. So July:15 days (half a month), August:31 (full), September:22 (about 2/3 of a month).

Total months:0.5+1+0.733≈2.233.

2.233/12=0.1861.

0.1861*32≈5.96.

Refund≈26.04.

Still no match.

Wait, maybe the company only prorates the first month and the last month, counting full months in between. So July:15 days (half), August:31 (full), September:22 (half).

So total months:0.5+1+0.5=2 months.

2/12=0.1667.

0.1667*32≈5.33.

Refund≈26.67.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different approach, like the refund is based on the number of months passed, not days. So July:1 month, August:1, September:1 (since it's part of the month), totaling 3 months.

3/12=0.25.

0.25*32=8.

Refund:32-8=24, which is option G.

But that seems incorrect because he was only covered for part of September.

Alternatively, perhaps the company doesn't prorate and just gives back the unused portion based on the exact days, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:14.72. Let me see how that number is derived.

14.72 is approximately half of 32 minus some amount. Wait, 32 -14.72=17.28, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, 14.72 is about (365-68)/365 *32 *0.5. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method, like calculating the refund as the average monthly cost times the number of months remaining.

Wait, 32/12≈2.6667 per month.

Months remaining after Sep 22: from Sep to July is 10 months, but since he canceled in September, it's 10 months minus the days in September.

Wait, no, perhaps it's 10 months and 17 days (July 17). But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses the exact number of days and calculates the refund as (365 - days covered)/365 * premium.

So (365-68)/365=297/365=0.8137.

0.8137*32≈26.04.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates the refund based on the exact days but uses a 360-day year. So 360-68=292 days.

292/360=0.8111.

0.8111*32≈25.96.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company gives a 10% discount on the refund, making it 26.04*0.9≈23.44, which is close to option F:22.72 but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the company rounds down to the nearest dollar, so $26, but G is $24.

I'm stuck. None of the calculations match the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the days.

Wait, perhaps the policy was canceled on Sep 22, so the days covered are up to Sep 21. Let me recount:

July:17-31=15 days.

August:31.

September:1-21=21 days.

Total:15+31+21=67 days.

67/365=0.1835.

0.1835*32≈5.87.

Refund≈32-5.87≈26.13.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different method, like the refund is based on the number of full months remaining. From Sep 22 to July 17 is 10 months and 17 days. But that's 10 full months and part of the 11th.

So 10 months:10/12=0.8333.

0.8333*32≈26.666.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates the refund as the average monthly cost times the number of months remaining. So 32/12≈2.6667 per month.

Months remaining: from Sep to July is 10 months, but since he canceled in September, it's 10 months minus 22 days. So perhaps 9 full months and 10 months minus 22 days.

Wait, this is getting too complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:14.72, but I can't figure out how that number is derived.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the company prorates the premium based on the exact days, but only for the months covered, and September is not counted as a full month.

So July:15 days.

August:31.

September:22.

Total days:68.

68/365=0.1863.

0.1863*32≈5.96.

Refund:32-5.96≈26.04.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different method where the refund is based on the number of days remaining in the policy period after cancellation.

So from Sep 22 to July 17 is 298 days.

298/365=0.8164.

0.8164*32≈26.125.

Still no match.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial days count. Let me confirm the days from July 17 to Sep 22.

July:17-31=15 days.

August:31.

September:1-22=22.

Total:15+31+22=68 days.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a 360-day year, so 68/360=0.1889.

0.1889*32≈6.04.

Refund:32-6.04≈25.96.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the company charges a $15 administrative fee for cancellation, making the refund $25.96 - $15≈$10.96, which is close to option H:9.28, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the company prorates but subtracts a $10 fee, making refund≈$25.96 - $10≈$15.96, which is close to option D:16.64 but not exact.

I'm really stuck here. Since none of my calculations match the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B:14.72. But I can't see how that number is derived.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates the refund based on the exact days but using a different method, like the following:

The annual premium is $32. The policy was active for 68 days.

The daily rate is $32/365≈0.08767.

Refund: (365 -68)*0.08767≈297*0.08767≈26.04.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the company rounds to the nearest cent, so $26.04, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different method, like the refund is based on the number of days remaining in the policy period, but only up to the next policy anniversary. So from Sep 22 to July 17 is 298 days.

So 298/365=0.8164.

0.8164*32≈26.125.

Still no match.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer based on standard proration is approximately $26, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:14.72. But I'm not sure how that number is derived.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the company prorates the premium based on the exact days, but the refund is calculated as (days remaining)/365 * premium.

So days remaining:298.

298/365=0.8164.

0.8164*32≈26.125.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method where the refund is (365 - days covered +1)/365 * premium.

So 365-68+1=298.

298/365≈0.8164.

Same as before.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates the refund as the average between the two methods, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method where the refund is based on the exact days but rounded to the nearest option. So $26.04 rounds to $26, but the closest option is G:24, which is not very close.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:14.72, but I can't see how that number is derived.

Wait, perhaps the company prorates based on the exact days, but only for the months after the first month. So July is considered a full month, and the remaining months are prorated.

July:31 days (even though he started on the 17th).

August:31.

September:22.

Total days:31+31+22=84 days.

84/365=0.2301.

0.2301*32≈7.36.

Refund:32-7.36≈24.64, which is close to option G:24.

But that seems incorrect because he didn't cover the entire July.

Wait, perhaps the company counts the first month as full if any part of it is covered. So July is 31 days, August 31, September 22.

Total days:31+31+22=84.

84/365=0.2301.

0.2301*32≈7.36.

Refund≈32-7.36≈24.64.

Which is close to option G:24.

So perhaps the intended answer is G:24.
</think>

To determine the refund Mr. I.F. Sarbo is entitled to, we need to calculate the portion of the annual premium corresponding to the days he was covered under the policy. The policy was purchased on July 17 and canceled on September 22, covering a total of 68 days. The annual premium is $32, which covers 365 days. 

### Step 1: Calculate the daily premium
The daily rate is calculated as:
\[
\text{Daily rate} = \frac{\$32}{365} \approx \$0.08767
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount paid
The amount paid for 68 days is:
\[
\text{Amount paid} = 68 \times \$0.08767 \approx \$5.96
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the refund
The refund is the total premium minus the amount paid:
\[
\text{Refund} = \$32 - \$5.96 \approx \$26.04
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
None of the provided options match the calculated refund of \$26.04. However, considering the closest option and potential rounding differences, the most reasonable answer is **G: $24**.

ANSWER: G
