Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. The question is about a convex 3D object with k pentagonal faces and m hexagonal faces. All the faces are regular, and I need to find the value of k from the given options.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. I remember that for convex polyhedrons, Euler's formula applies. Euler's formula states that the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces equals 2. So, V - E + F = 2. That's a crucial starting point.

The object has two types of faces: pentagons and hexagons. So, the total number of faces F is k + m, right? Because each face is either a pentagon or a hexagon.

Now, each face contributes a certain number of edges. But wait, each edge is shared by two faces. So, if I count all the edges from all the faces, I'll be counting each edge twice. Therefore, the total number of edges E can be calculated as (5k + 6m)/2. Because each pentagon has 5 edges and each hexagon has 6 edges, but each edge is shared, so we divide by 2.

Next, let's think about the vertices. Each face is a regular polygon, so each vertex is where multiple edges meet. In a convex polyhedron, each vertex is the meeting point of at least three edges. Wait, but in a regular convex polyhedron, like a Platonic solid, each vertex is the same, but here we have different faces. So maybe I should consider the arrangement of the faces around each vertex.

Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe I can approach it using Euler's formula. Let me write down what I have so far.

F = k + m

E = (5k + 6m)/2

V = ? Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I can express V in terms of the faces. Each face contributes as many vertices as it has edges, but each vertex is shared by multiple faces.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the number of vertices by considering the arrangement. Wait, perhaps using the formula that relates the number of faces, edges, and vertices, but I need another equation to connect these variables.

Wait, maybe I can relate the number of vertices. Each vertex is where a certain number of edges meet. In a convex polyhedron with regular faces, each vertex is typically where three faces meet (like in a soccer ball pattern), but I'm not sure if that's the case here. So maybe each vertex is the meeting point of three edges, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that the sum of all face degrees equals twice the number of edges. Wait, that's what I did for E, so maybe that's not helpful here.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the number of face corners. Each pentagonal face has 5 corners, each hexagonal face has 6. So, the total number of corners is 5k + 6m. But each actual vertex is shared by multiple faces. If I assume that each vertex is where three faces meet (which is common in convex polyhedrons), then each vertex contributes three corners. So, the total number of vertices V would be (5k + 6m)/3. Because each corner is a vertex, and each vertex is part of three faces.

Wait, but is that always the case? I think in some cases, like in a cube, each vertex is where three squares meet, so yes. But in a tetrahedron, each vertex is where three triangles meet. So perhaps this is a valid assumption for a convex polyhedron with regular faces.

So, V = (5k + 6m)/3.

Now, plugging into Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

Substituting the expressions:

(5k + 6m)/3 - (5k + 6m)/2 + (k + m) = 2.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's compute it step by step.

First, let me compute each term.

V = (5k + 6m)/3

E = (5k + 6m)/2

F = k + m

So, V - E + F = [(5k +6m)/3] - [(5k+6m)/2] + (k + m) = 2.

Let me find a common denominator to combine the terms. The denominators are 3, 2, and 1. The least common multiple is 6.

So, multiply each term by 6 to eliminate denominators:

6*(5k+6m)/3 - 6*(5k+6m)/2 + 6*(k + m) = 6*2

Simplify each term:

6/3 = 2, so first term becomes 2*(5k +6m) = 10k +12m.

6/2 = 3, so second term becomes 3*(5k +6m) =15k +18m.

Third term: 6*(k +m) =6k +6m.

So the equation becomes:

(10k +12m) - (15k +18m) + (6k +6m) = 12.

Let's compute each part:

10k +12m -15k -18m +6k +6m.

Combine like terms:

(10k -15k +6k) + (12m -18m +6m) = (1k) + (0m) = k.

So, k = 12.

Wait, that's interesting. So, according to this, k equals 12. So the number of pentagonal faces is 12.

Let me check if this makes sense. So, if k=12, then let's think about possible m.

Wait, but I don't know m yet. Let me see if this is consistent with known polyhedrons.

Wait, the most common example of a convex polyhedron with pentagonal and hexagonal faces is a soccer ball pattern, which is a truncated icosahedron. But wait, how many pentagons does that have?

Wait, a truncated icosahedron has 12 pentagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces. Because when you truncate an icosahedron, each of the 12 vertices becomes a pentagon, and each of the original 20 faces becomes a hexagon. So, in that case, k=12 and m=20.

Wait, but in the question, the options include 12 as option D. So, the answer would be D:12.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the equation led me to k=12 regardless of m. That seems a bit odd, but perhaps it's correct because the equation derived only involves k and m, but the way the terms canceled out left k=12.

Let me go through the steps again to verify.

Starting with Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

Expressed in terms of k and m, we have:

V = (5k +6m)/3

E = (5k +6m)/2

F = k + m

So, plugging into Euler's formula:

(5k +6m)/3 - (5k +6m)/2 + (k + m) = 2.

Multiply each term by 6 to eliminate denominators:

2*(5k +6m) -3*(5k +6m) +6*(k +m) =12.

Compute each part:

2*(5k +6m) =10k +12m

3*(5k +6m)=15k +18m

6*(k +m)=6k +6m

So:

10k +12m -15k -18m +6k +6m =12.

Adding like terms:

(10k -15k +6k) = (1k)

(12m -18m +6m) = 0m

So, the equation is k = 12.

Okay, that seems correct. So, k must be 12, regardless of m. So the answer is D:12.

The problem involves determining the number of pentagonal faces (k) in a convex 3D object with regular pentagonal and hexagonal faces. Using Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2), we express the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) in terms of k and m (the number of hexagonal faces). 

1. **Faces (F):** F = k + m.
2. **Edges (E):** Each pentagon contributes 5 edges and each hexagon contributes 6, but each edge is shared by two faces, so E = (5k + 6m)/2.
3. **Vertices (V):** Each vertex is shared by three faces, so V = (5k + 6m)/3.

Substituting these into Euler's formula:

\[
\frac{5k + 6m}{3} - \frac{5k + 6m}{2} + (k + m) = 2
\]

Simplifying this equation leads to k = 12. This result is consistent with known polyhedrons like the truncated icosahedron, which has 12 pentagonal faces.
