Okay, so I need to find the remainder when 25^1059 is divided by 23. Hmm, I remember something about modular arithmetic and maybe Fermat's little theorem could help here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, 25 and 23 are both numbers. Since 23 is a prime number, Fermat's little theorem might apply. Fermat's theorem says that if p is a prime and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. Here, p is 23, so p-1 is 22. So, for any a not divisible by 23, a^22 ≡ 1 mod 23.

Wait, but 25 is bigger than 23. Maybe I should find 25 mod 23 first to simplify this. Let's calculate 25 divided by 23. 23 goes into 25 once with a remainder of 2. So 25 ≡ 2 mod 23. That means 25^1059 ≡ 2^1059 mod 23.

Now the problem reduces to finding 2^1059 mod 23. Using Fermat's theorem, since 2 and 23 are coprime, 2^22 ≡ 1 mod 23. So, 2^22k ≡ 1^k ≡ 1 mod 23 for any integer k.

So, I can write 1059 as a multiple of 22 plus some remainder. Let me divide 1059 by 22 to find how many times 22 goes into 1059 and what the remainder is.

Calculating 22 times 48 is 1056, because 22*40=880, 22*8=176, so 880+176=1056. Then 1059 - 1056 is 3. So 1059 = 22*48 + 3. Therefore, 2^1059 = (2^22)^48 * 2^3.

Since 2^22 ≡ 1 mod 23, this becomes (1)^48 * 2^3 mod 23. Which simplifies to 1 * 8 mod 23. So 2^1059 ≡ 8 mod 23.

Therefore, 25^1059 ≡ 8 mod 23. Looking at the options, I see option I is 8. So the answer should be I.
