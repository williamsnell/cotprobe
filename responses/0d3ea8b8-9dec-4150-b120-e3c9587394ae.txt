Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a chamber containing 5 lbm of an ideal gas. The initial temperature is 100°F. Then, the gas undergoes a reversible isobaric process where 500 Btu of heat are added. I need to find the final temperature, and I'm given some properties of the gas: R is 0.0641 Btu/lbm-°R, and k is 1.147. The options are A to D, with temperatures ranging from 200°F to 500°F.

Hmm, I remember that for an isobaric process, the pressure remains constant. Since it's a reversible isobaric process, I think the work done can be calculated using the formula W = PΔV, but since the process is isobaric and we're dealing with an ideal gas, maybe I can use the ideal gas law to relate the changes in temperature and volume. But wait, the problem gives me the heat added, so maybe I should use the first law of thermodynamics here.

The first law states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat added (Q) minus the work done (W), so ΔU = Q - W. But for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So ΔU = m * c_v * ΔT. But wait, I don't have c_v given here. Oh, but I do have R and k. Maybe I can relate these to find c_v or c_p.

I remember that for an ideal gas, the relation between specific heats is c_p = c_v + R. Also, the ratio k is c_p / c_v. So if k is given as 1.147, then k = c_p / c_v. Let me write that down: k = c_p / c_v.

Since c_p = c_v + R, I can substitute. So c_p = c_v * k. Wait, no, let's think again. If k = c_p / c_v, then c_p = k * c_v. And since c_p = c_v + R, substituting gives k * c_v = c_v + R. Let me solve for c_v.

k * c_v = c_v + R → (k - 1) * c_v = R → c_v = R / (k - 1).

Wait, I can compute that. R is 0.0641 Btu/lbm-°R, and k is 1.147. So k - 1 is 0.147.

So c_v = 0.0641 / 0.147. Let me calculate that. 0.0641 divided by 0.147. Hmm, let me do that: 0.0641 / 0.147 ≈ 0.4362 Btu/lbm-°R.

Wait, that seems right. Now, the specific heat at constant volume cv is approximately 0.4362 Btu/lbm-°R.

Now, the heat added Q is 500 Btu. But wait, in an isobaric process, the heat added is related to both the change in internal energy and the work done. Alternatively, I can use the formula for Q in an isobaric process.

I think the formula for heat added during an isobaric process is Q = m * c_p * ΔT. Because at constant pressure, the heat added is m*c_p*ΔT. Let me confirm that. Yes, because for constant pressure, the heat transfer is Q = m c_p (T2 - T1).

So, rearranging, ΔT = Q / (m * c_p).

I have Q as 500 Btu, m is 5 lbm, and c_p is k * c_v, which we can compute as 1.147 * 0.4362 ≈ 0.502 Btu/lbm-°R.

Wait, let me compute that. 1.147 * 0.4362: 1 * 0.4362 is 0.4362, 0.147 * 0.4362 ≈ 0.0641. So adding them, 0.4362 + 0.0641 ≈ 0.5003. So c_p ≈ 0.5003 Btu/lbm-°R.

Wait, that's interesting because R is 0.0641, and c_p = R/(k-1) + R? Wait, no, earlier we found c_p = k * c_v, and c_v was R/(k-1). So yes, c_p = R/(k-1) * k = R*k/(k-1). Let me check that: R = 0.0641, k=1.147, so 0.0641 * 1.147 / (0.147). Let me compute that.

First, 0.0641 * 1.147 ≈ 0.0641 * 1 = 0.0641, 0.0641 * 0.147 ≈ 0.0094. So total ≈ 0.0735. Then 0.0735 divided by 0.147 ≈ 0.5003. So yes, c_p is approximately 0.5003 Btu/lbm-°R.

Now, using Q = m c_p (T2 - T1) → T2 = T1 + Q/(m c_p).

Plugging in the numbers: Q is 500 Btu, m is 5 lbm, c_p is 0.5003.

So T2 = 100°F + (500) / (5 * 0.5003). Let's compute the denominator: 5 * 0.5003 ≈ 2.5015. So 500 / 2.5015 ≈ 199.8°F. So T2 ≈ 100 + 199.8 ≈ 299.8°F, which is approximately 300°F.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, calculation of c_v: R/(k-1) = 0.0641 / (1.147 - 1) = 0.0641 / 0.147 ≈ 0.4362 Btu/lbm-°R.

Then c_p = k * c_v = 1.147 * 0.4362 ≈ 0.5003 Btu/lbm-°R.

Then, Q = m c_p (T2 - T1) → 500 = 5 * 0.5003 * (T2 - 100).

So 500 = 2.5015 * (T2 - 100).

Divide both sides by 2.5015: 500 / 2.5015 ≈ 199.86.

So T2 - 100 ≈ 199.86 → T2 ≈ 299.86°F, which is roughly 300°F, so option D.

Wait, but I should make sure that the temperature units are okay. Since R is given in Btu/lbm-°R, which is consistent with Fahrenheit degrees because the °R is Rankine, but in this case, since we're dealing with a difference in Fahrenheit, the calculation should still hold because the size of a degree Fahrenheit is the same as a degree Rankine when considering temperature differences.

Wait, but let me think again. The gas constant R is given as 0.0641 Btu/lbm-°R. So when using it in equations, the temperature should be in absolute terms, like Rankine. Wait, but in the calculation above, I used Fahrenheit temperatures. Could that be a problem?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because when you use R in imperial units, the temperature must be in absolute terms, i.e., Rankine (°R), not Fahrenheit. So perhaps I made a mistake by using Fahrenheit directly.

Wait, let me clarify. The gas constant R is given in Btu/lbm-°R, which implies that the temperature must be in absolute units. So, for example, if T1 is 100°F, I should convert that to Rankine: 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 °R.

Similarly, T2 would be in Rankine. So perhaps I should redo the calculation using Rankine.

Wait, but then the heat transfer Q is given in Btu, which is consistent with the imperial system.

So, let's try this again, converting temperatures to Rankine.

T1 = 100°F = 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 °R.

We need to find T2 in °R, then convert back to °F.

Using Q = m c_p (T2 - T1).

So, 500 Btu = 5 lbm * 0.5003 Btu/lbm-°R * (T2 - 559.67).

Compute 5 * 0.5003 = 2.5015.

So, 500 = 2.5015 * (T2 - 559.67).

Divide both sides by 2.5015: 500 / 2.5015 ≈ 199.86.

So, T2 - 559.67 = 199.86 → T2 = 559.67 + 199.86 ≈ 759.53 °R.

Now, convert back to Fahrenheit: 759.53 - 459.67 ≈ 299.86°F, which is approximately 300°F, so option D.

So, even after converting to Rankine, I still get the same result. Therefore, the final temperature is approximately 300°F, which is option D.

To determine the final temperature of the gas after the isobaric heat addition, we use the relationship for heat transfer during a constant pressure process:

\[
Q = m c_p (T_2 - T_1)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate Specific Heat at Constant Pressure (\(c_p\))
Given:
- \(R = 0.0641 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ\text{R}\)
- \(k = 1.147\)

For an ideal gas, \(k = \frac{c_p}{c_v}\), and \(c_p = c_v + R\). Substituting \(c_v = \frac{R}{k - 1}\):

\[
c_v = \frac{0.0641}{1.147 - 1} = \frac{0.0641}{0.147} \approx 0.4362 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ\text{R}
\]

\[
c_p = k \cdot c_v = 1.147 \cdot 0.4362 \approx 0.5003 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ\text{R}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for Final Temperature (\(T_2\))
Rearranging the heat transfer equation:

\[
T_2 = T_1 + \frac{Q}{m c_p}
\]

Given:
- \(Q = 500 \, \text{Btu}\)
- \(m = 5 \, \text{lbm}\)
- \(T_1 = 100^\circ\text{F}\)
- \(c_p = 0.5003 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ\text{R}\)

Substitute the values:

\[
T_2 = 100 + \frac{500}{5 \cdot 0.5003} = 100 + \frac{500}{2.5015} \approx 100 + 199.86 \approx 299.86^\circ\text{F}
\]

### Step 3: Verify Using Absolute Temperatures
Convert \(T_1\) to Rankine:

\[
T_1 = 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 \, \text{°R}
\]

Using the same heat transfer equation:

\[
500 = 5 \cdot 0.5003 \cdot (T_2 - 559.67)
\]

\[
T_2 - 559.67 = \frac{500}{2.5015} \approx 199.86
\]

\[
T_2 = 559.67 + 199.86 = 759.53 \, \text{°R}
\]

Convert back to Fahrenheit:

\[
T_2 = 759.53 - 459.67 \approx 299.86^\circ\text{F}
\]

### Final Answer:
The final temperature of the gas is approximately \(300^\circ\text{F}\), corresponding to **Option D**.
