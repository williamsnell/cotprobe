Alright, so I've got this question here about Attentional Load Theory, and I need to figure out which option correctly describes it. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Attentional Load Theory is related to how our attention works, especially when we're focusing on one thing while other stimuli are present. I think it's about how the things we ignore affect the processing of what we're focusing on.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says, "The degree to which an attended stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the ignored stimulus." Hmm, that sounds a bit off. I recall that the theory is more about how the ignored stuff affects the attended stuff, but I'm not sure if it's the processing of the ignored that affects the attended. Maybe I'll come back to this.

Option B claims it's based on the number of tasks being performed simultaneously. That doesn't ring a bell. I think it's more about the cognitive resources when attention is divided, not necessarily the number of tasks. So probably not B.

Option C talks about the unity of actions limiting attentional resources. I don't remember this being a key point of the theory. It might be more related to some other concept, maybe Gestalt principles or something else. So I'll skip C.

Option D states, "The capacity of attentional resources is determined by the complexity of the ignored stimulus." Wait, that seems a bit off. I think the capacity isn't about the ignored but more about how much attention is available. Maybe D is not correct.

Option E: "Selective attention causes a delay in the processing of an ignored stimulus." I don't think this is right. I remember reading that when you ignore something, it's not necessarily delayed but might be processed less, not delayed. So E might not be it.

Option F says attentional resources are limitless. That's definitely wrong. I've heard that attention is limited, so F is incorrect.

Option G: "There is a general limit to the extent of attentional resources." This makes more sense. I think the theory posits that attention has limited capacity, so G could be correct.

Option H: "The degree to which an ignored stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus." Wait, this seems like the opposite of what I thought earlier. So if you're attending to something that requires a lot of processing, it might take away resources from the ignored stimuli. So the ignored's processing depends on the attended's processing. Hmm, maybe H is correct, but I'm not sure.

Option I: "Selective attention facilitates inhibition of return." Inhibition of return is a different concept, about not looking back at something once you've moved your attention. I don't think that's directly tied to attentional load theory, so I'll rule out I.

Option J: "The extent of processing required by the ignored stimulus influences the processing of the attended stimulus." Oh, this sounds familiar. I think the theory suggests that when you're ignoring something, the processing of what you're attending to can be affected by how much effort the ignored stimulus requires. So if the ignored is complex, it might take up more attentional resources, leaving less for the attended. So J seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought G might be correct, but J seems to directly address the relationship between attended and ignored stimuli. Let me think again. The question is about what Attentional Load Theory posits. From what I remember, the theory suggests that the amount of attention available for processing an attended stimulus can be limited by the processing demands of the ignored stimulus. So when the ignored stimulus is more complex, it takes up more cognitive resources, leaving less for the attended one. That aligns with option J.

But wait, I also thought about option H. H says the ignored's processing depends on the attended's processing. That would mean if you're attending to something that requires a lot, the ignored is processed less. But I think it's the other way around: the ignored's complexity affects the attended's processing. So J is correct.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is **J**. Attentional Load Theory posits that the extent of processing required by the ignored stimulus influences the processing of the attended stimulus. 

Answer: J
