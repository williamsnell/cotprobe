Question:

What are the psychoanalytic and behavioral theoriesof dissociativedisorders?

Options:

A: Behavioral theory posits that dissociative disorders are caused by genetic predispositions, while psychoanalytic theory suggests they stem from early attachment issues.
B: Dissociative disorders are caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain
C: Behavioral theory suggests dissociative disorders arise from reinforcement of certain behaviors, and psychoanalytic theory sees them as a manifestation of ego defense mechanisms.
D: Dissociative reactions are a result of unresolved childhood trauma
E: Dissociative disorders, according to behavioral theory, are the result of observational learning, while psychoanalytic theory links them to the death drive (Thanatos).
F: Psychoanalytic theory suggests dissociative disorders are learned behaviors, while behavioral theory suggests they are a form of self-punishment.
G: Psychoanalytic theory considers dissociative disorders as a byproduct of cognitive dissonance, whereas behavioral theory sees them as a consequence of classical conditioning.
H: Psychoanalytic theory attributes dissociative disorders to the failure of the Oedipus complex, while behavioral theory attributes them to the extinction of conditioned responses.
I: Psychoanalytic theory views dissociative reactions as instances of massive repression of unacceptable urges, usually relating back to the infantile sexual wishes. Behavioral theory views dissociative reactions as an avoidance response used to escape stressful stimuli.
J: Dissociative reactions are a result of social and environmental factors

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychoanalytic and behavioral theories of dissociative disorders. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what dissociative disorders are. From what I remember, they involve disruptions in the integration of memory, identity, perception, behavior, and consciousness. Examples include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, and depersonalization-derealization disorder. These disorders often stem from trauma or stress.

Now, the question is asking about the theories from both psychoanalysis and behaviorism. Let's break down each theory.

Starting with psychoanalytic theory. Freud's ideas come to mind. He believed that dissociative disorders were related to repression of unacceptable thoughts or memories, often stemming from early childhood experiences. He talked about the unconscious mind and how repressed memories could surface in different ways. In the context of dissociative disorders, I think he might have seen them as a way the mind copes with trauma by splitting off or dissociating parts of the self or memories. I remember something about massive repression, especially of sexual or aggressive urges from the infantile stage. So, dissociation is a defense mechanism to keep those unacceptable thoughts out of conscious awareness.

Now, looking at behavioral theory. Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and learning processes. Behavioral theories for dissociative disorders might suggest that these behaviors are learned responses to certain stimuli. For example, classical conditioning could play a role. If a person associates a particular situation with trauma, they might dissociate as a way to avoid the stress or pain. Alternatively, operant conditioning could explain it as an escape response that is reinforced when it successfully avoids negative stimuli. So, dissociation might be a learned way to cope with anxiety or fear.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Behavioral is genetic, psychoanalytic is early attachment. Hmm, I don't think so. Behavioral isn't about genetics; it's about learned behaviors. Psychoanalytic might touch on early attachment, but the question is about theories of dissociative disorders.

Option B: Chemical imbalance. That's more of a biomedical perspective, not specifically psychoanalytic or behavioral. So probably not.

Option C: Behavioral is reinforcement, psychoanalytic is ego defense. That sounds plausible. Reinforcement aligns with behaviorism, and ego defense mechanisms are part of psychoanalysis. Ego defense mechanisms like repression fit with the idea of dissociation as a defense.

Option D: Childhood trauma. While true that trauma is a cause, this is more about etiology than the theories themselves. The question asks about the theories, so D might be a contributing factor but not the theory explanation.

Option E: Behavioral as observational learning, psychoanalytic as death drive. I'm not too sure about the death drive (Thanatos) being linked here. Observational learning is more about modeling behaviors, which might not directly explain dissociation.

Option F: Psychoanalytic as learned, behavioral as self-punishment. That seems off because psychoanalysis isn't about learned behaviors in the same way. They focus on unconscious processes.

Option G: Cognitive dissonance and classical conditioning. Cognitive dissonance isn't a psychoanalytic concept; it's more cognitive-behavioral. So G might mix up theories.

Option H: Oedipus complex and extinction. Oedipus is more about family dynamics, and extinction is a behavioral concept (like in operant conditioning). Not sure this fits dissociative disorders directly.

Option I: Psychoanalytic as repression of infantile sexual wishes, behavioral as avoidance to escape stress. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Psychoanalysis would see dissociation as repression, and behaviorism as an avoidance response, which is a type of operant conditioning where the behavior (dissociation) escapes stress, reinforcing it.

Option J: Social and environmental factors. More about causes than theories.

So, looking back, the correct answer should explain both theories. Psychoanalytic would point to repression or defense mechanisms, and behavioral would tie it to learning, perhaps reinforcement or avoidance.

Between options C and I. Option C says behavioral is reinforcement (which is correct) and psychoanalytic is ego defense (also correct). But I think the more precise answer is I, where psychoanalytic is about massive repression of infantile sexual wishes, and behavioral is about avoiding stress.

Wait, but option C says "reinforcement of certain behaviors" and "defense mechanisms." That's correct but perhaps too broad. Option I is more specific, linking it to repression and avoidance, which are more directly relevant to dissociation.

So, I think the answer is I.

The psychoanalytic theory views dissociative disorders as a result of massive repression of unacceptable urges, often linked to infantile sexual wishes, while the behavioral theory sees dissociative reactions as an avoidance response used to escape stressful stimuli. 

Answer: I
