Question:

A state's constitution reserves to the people of each municipality in the state the power of referendum with respect to all questions that the municipality is authorized to control by legislation. A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a water park on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city's charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the commission rejected the developer's subsequent application for "recreational area" approval for the proposed water park on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. Assume that while the action was pending in the state court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum. Which would be the most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance?

Options:

A: The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment.
B: The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.
C: The referendum procedure is not applicable in this context as it is only for state-wide legislation.
D: The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
E: The referendum procedure is a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: The referendum procedure is valid only if it is not influenced by external factors.
G: The referendum procedure is unconstitutional as it infringes on the rights of property owners.
H: The referendum procedure is only applicable in cases of major legislative changes, not zoning changes.
I: The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against publicpolicy.

Okay, so I've got this constitutional law question about referendums and zoning changes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a state's constitution allows municipalities to have the power of referendum on any questions they're authorized to control by legislation. So, each city can decide whether to use referendums for certain issues. In this case, the city amended its charter by popular vote to require that any changes in land use approved by the city council must be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. 

A developer applied for a zoning change for a water park, and both the planning commission and city council approved it. But then the commission rejected the developer's application for "recreational area" approval because the council's rezoning hadn't been submitted to a referendum. Later, while the court case was pending, the proposed zoning change was defeated in the referendum.

The question is asking which constitutional law rule applies to the referendum procedure in this context.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out if the referendum procedure is constitutional or not. Let's go through each option.

Option A says the procedure violates due process under the 14th Amendment. Due process usually involves notice and an opportunity to be heard. But referendums are a part of the democratic process, so I'm not sure if a referendum itself would be a due process violation. It might if it's applied retroactively or without notice, but here it seems the process was followed.

Option B claims the procedure is arbitrary and capricious, which would make it an unlawful delegation of legislative power. Arbitrary actions are usually problems if they don't follow proper procedures or are not based on rational grounds. However, referendums are a legitimate way for the public to have a say, so I don't think it's arbitrary. Plus, this seems more about separation of powers than delegation.

Option C says the referendum isn't applicable because it's only for state-wide legislation. But the question is about a municipal ordinance, so this might not be correct. The state's constitution allows municipalities to have referendums on their own legislation.

Option D states that the referendum procedure is a democratic instrument and doesn't violate the due process clause. This makes sense because referendums are a form of direct democracy. As long as the process is fair and applied generally, it shouldn't be unconstitutional under due process. 

Option E suggests it's a violation of equal protection. Equal protection would require that similarly situated individuals are treated the same. Unless the referendum treated the developer differently, I don't see an equal protection issue here. The process was applied equally to all zoning changes, so this might not apply.

Option F says the procedure is valid only if not influenced by external factors. But the question doesn't mention any external influence, so this option might not be the best fit. It's more about the validity in general rather than conditions.

Option G claims it infringes on property rights. The developer's property was affected, but under the Takings Clause, there must be just compensation. However, a referendum isn't a taking; it's a regulatory action. So unless it's a total taking without compensation, which isn't the case here, this might not hold. Plus, the question is about the procedure's constitutionality, not the outcome for the property.

Option H says referendums are only for major changes, not zoning. But zoning is a significant aspect of land use regulation. Municipalities often use referendums for zoning changes, so I don't think this is correct. The state allows municipalities to use referendums on legislation they control, which includes zoning.

Option I states the procedure is invalid against public policy. I'm not sure what specific public policy would make referendums on zoning invalid. There's a long history of using referendums in local governance, so this seems unlikely unless there's a specific policy against it, which isn't mentioned here.

Putting it all together, the key issue is whether a referendum procedure for zoning changes is constitutional. The 14th Amendment's due process clause requires that laws are applied fairly. Referendums are a legitimate part of the democratic process, so they don't inherently violate due process. Therefore, option D seems correct because it aligns with the idea that referendums are a democratic tool and don't infringe on constitutional rights like due process.

The most applicable rule is that the referendum procedure, as a democratic instrument, does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
