Question:

Which of the following statements about proteolysis is correct?


Options:

A: Proteolysis does not involve enzymatic processes.
B: Proteolysis only occurs in animal cells.
C: All tissue proteins undergo catabolism at more or less the same rate.
D: The rate of tissue protein catabolism is more or less constant throughout the day.
E: Proteolysis can only occur in the presence of light.
F: Proteolysis is the process of protein synthesis, not breakdown.
G: All proteins are catabolised at the exact same time.
H: All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin.
I: Ubiquitin is only attached to proteins that are to be synthesized, not catabolised.
J: Lysosomal enzymes provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about proteolysis, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about proteolysis.

Proteolysis is the process by which proteins are broken down into smaller peptides and amino acids. From what I remember, this process is regulated and involves specific enzymes. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Proteolysis does not involve enzymatic processes. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I know that proteases, which are enzymes, are involved in breaking down proteins. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Proteolysis only occurs in animal cells. No, I think proteolysis happens in all kinds of cells, including plant and bacterial cells. So B is wrong.

Option C: All tissue proteins undergo catabolism at more or less the same rate. That seems unlikely. Different proteins have different turnover rates. For example, some enzymes are broken down quickly, while structural proteins might last longer. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The rate of tissue protein catabolism is more or less constant throughout the day. I'm not sure about this. I think the body's metabolism varies, so maybe protein breakdown isn't constant. Like, during fasting, protein breakdown might increase. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: Proteolysis can only occur in the presence of light. That doesn't make sense. Proteolysis happens in darkness too; light isn't a requirement. So E is wrong.

Option F: Proteolysis is the process of protein synthesis, not breakdown. No, that's backwards. Proteolysis is breakdown, while synthesis is anabolism. So F is incorrect.

Option G: All proteins are catabolised at the exact same time. No, proteins are catabolized at different times depending on their role. Some are broken down more quickly than others. So G is wrong.

Option H: All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin. Wait, I remember that ubiquitin tags mark proteins for degradation by the proteasome. But is it all proteins? I think most are, but maybe some are exceptions, like some proteins in peroxisomes or other pathways. But H might be correct.

Option I: Ubiquitin is only attached to proteins that are to be synthesized, not catabolised. No, that's the opposite. Ubiquitin tags mark proteins for breakdown, not synthesis. So I is wrong.

Option J: Lysosomal enzymes provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism. I know that proteasomes are another main pathway for protein degradation. So J is incorrect because it's not the only mechanism.

So, looking back, H seems correct because ubiquitination is a key process in marking proteins for breakdown. But wait, do all proteins get tagged? I think most do, but maybe some go through alternative pathways without ubiquitin. I'm not entirely sure, but H is the best option among the choices given.
