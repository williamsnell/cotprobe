Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cell voltage. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The reaction given is H2(g) + 2AgCl(s) + 2H2O → 2Ag(s) + 2H3O+(aq) + 2Cl^-(aq). I need to find the cell voltage at 25°C with specific activities given.

First, I remember that the standard cell potential (E°) can be calculated using the standard free energies of formation (ΔGf°) of the products and reactants. The formula is ΔG° = -nFE°, where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), and E° is the standard cell potential.

Wait, but wait, actually, ΔG° is the change in Gibbs free energy, which is related to the cell potential by ΔG° = -nFE°. Since I have the ΔGf° for each substance, I can calculate the overall ΔG° for the reaction and then find E°.

Let me list out the given data:

- ΔGf°(AgCl(s)) = -109.7 kJ/mol
- ΔGf°(H2O(l)) = -237.2 kJ/mol
- ΔGf°(H3O+ + Cl^- (aq)) = -368.4 kJ/mol

Wait, wait, the last one is for the aqueous ions? Or is it the standard formation for the (H3O+ + Cl^-) combination? I think it's the standard free energy for the ions in solution, perhaps as HCl dissolved.

The reaction is written as H2(g) + 2AgCl(s) + 2H2O → 2Ag(s) + 2H3O+ + 2Cl^-. So, the products are Ag(s), H3O+ (aq), and Cl^- (aq). The reactants are H2(g), AgCl(s), and H2O(l).

To find the standard ΔG°, I need to calculate the sum of the ΔGf° of products minus the sum of reactants.

Let's write down each component:

Reactants:
- H2(g): Since it's an element in its standard state, ΔGf° is 0.
- 2AgCl(s): Each has ΔGf° = -109.7 kJ/mol. So total is 2*(-109.7) = -219.4 kJ.
- 2H2O(l): Each has ΔGf° = -237.2 kJ/mol. So total is 2*(-237.2) = -474.4 kJ.

Products:
- 2Ag(s): Elements in standard state, ΔGf°=0 each. So total is 0.
- 2H3O+ (aq) + 2Cl^- (aq): The ΔGf° given is for H3O+ + Cl^- as a pair, so each unit is -368.4 kJ/mol. Wait, no, the given ΔGf is for the combination (H3O+ + Cl^-) as a single entity? Or per mole? The problem states it's -368.4 kJ per mole. So each mole of (H3O+ + Cl^-) has that ΔGf°. Since we have 2 moles of H3O+ and 2 of Cl^-, which together make 2 moles of (H3O+ + Cl^-), the total would be 2*(-368.4) = -736.8 kJ.

Wait, but does that make sense? Because each mole of H3O+ and Cl^- comes from HCl, which dissociates into H3O+ and Cl^- in water. So their formation would involve the formation of HCl. Alternatively, the ΔGf° given is for the (H3O+ + Cl^-) pair as a whole. So for 2 moles, it's 2*(-368.4) = -736.8 kJ.

So now, the overall ΔG° for the reaction is:

ΔG° = [Sum of products] - [Sum of reactants]
= [0 (Ag) + (-736.8) (H3O+ + Cl^-)] - [0 (H2) + (-219.4)(AgCl) + (-474.4)(H2O)]
= (-736.8) - [ (-219.4) + (-474.4) ]
= (-736.8) - (-693.8)
= (-736.8) + 693.8
= -43 kJ.

Wait, that's -43,000 J because 1 kJ is 1000 J.

Now, using ΔG° = -nFE°, we can solve for E°.

n is the number of moles of electrons transferred. Let's look at the reaction to see the electron transfer.

Looking at AgCl(s) being reduced to Ag(s). The reaction for AgCl is:

AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^-(aq)

So each mole of AgCl gains one electron. Since there are 2 moles of AgCl, that's 2 moles of electrons gained (reduction).

H2(g) is being oxidized. The reaction for H2 is:

H2(g) → 2H3O^+ + 2e^-

Wait, no, the oxidation of H2 would produce H+ ions. Let me think: H2 is oxidized to H+ (or H3O+). So each H atom loses one electron. So for one mole of H2, which has 2 H atoms, it loses 2 electrons. So 1 mole of H2 → 2 H3O+ + 2 e^-

But in the overall reaction, 1 mole of H2 is consumed, so it's losing 2 electrons (oxidation). Since the cell reaction involves oxidation and reduction, the electrons from oxidation (H2) are used in the reduction (AgCl).

So total electrons transferred: 2 (from H2) → but in the reaction, 2 moles of AgCl are reduced, each taking 1 e^-, so total 2 e^- needed. So n=2.

So n=2.

Now, ΔG° = -n F E°.

Rearranging, E° = -ΔG°/(n F).

ΔG° is -43,000 J (since it's -43 kJ).

So E° = -(-43,000 J) / (2 * 96485 C/mol)
= 43,000 / (2 * 96485)
Calculate that:

43,000 ÷ (192,970) ≈ 0.223 V.

Wait, that's about 0.223 V. But wait, that's the standard cell potential. But the problem isn't under standard conditions because the activities are given as 0.01 for H3O+ and Cl^-.

Oh right, the question says the reaction is run under non-standard conditions. So I can't stop at E°. I need to calculate the actual cell potential using the Nernst equation.

Wait, so the standard cell potential E° is 0.223 V, but under non-standard conditions, E will be different. So I need to apply the Nernst equation.

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q, where Q is the reaction quotient based on activities.

Alternatively, since we're at 25°C (298 K), the equation can be written as E = E° - (0.0592 V/n) log Q.

Wait, but I might have to consider the cell as written. Let me think about the cell setup.

In the reaction, H2 is the anode (oxidation), and AgCl is the cathode (reduction). So the cell voltage would be E_cathode - E_anode.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to write the cell as two half-reactions.

Anode (oxidation): H2 → 2H3O+ + 2e^-
Cathode (reduction): AgCl + e^- → Ag + Cl^-

Wait, but each AgCl takes one electron, so for 2 moles, it's 2e^-.

So the overall reaction is the sum of these two half-reactions.

Now, using the Nernst equation for each half-reaction.

But perhaps it's easier to write the overall reaction and calculate Q.

The reaction quotient Q is based on the concentrations (activities) of the products over reactants, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

The reaction is:

H2(g) + 2AgCl(s) + 2H2O → 2Ag(s) + 2H3O+ + 2Cl^-

So, the expression for Q would be:

Q = [ (activity of H3O+ ) * (activity of Cl^-) ]^2 / ( activity of H2 * (activity of AgCl)^2 )

But since AgCl is a solid, its activity is 1, and H2 has activity 1 (as given, activity is unity). So Q becomes:

Q = ( [H3O+] [Cl^-] )^2 / (1 * 1^2 ) = ( [H3O+][Cl^-] )^2.

Given that [H3O+] and [Cl^-] are each 0.01, their product is 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.0001. Then squared, that's (0.0001)^2 = 1e-8.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The reaction is 2 H3O+ and 2 Cl^- produced. So in the denominator, the reactants are H2 (activity 1) and AgCl (activity 1 each, solid), and H2O is a pure liquid, so activity 1.

So the numerator is [H3O+]^2 [Cl^-]^2, and the denominator is activity of H2 (1) times activity of AgCl^2 (1^2) times activity of H2O^2 (1^2).

So Q = ([H3O+][Cl^-])^2.

Given [H3O+] = 0.01 and [Cl^-] = 0.01, their product is 0.0001. Squared, that's (0.0001)^2 = 1e-8.

So Q = (0.01)^2 * (0.01)^2 = (0.0001)^2 = 1e-8.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check that.

Wait, no. The reaction is producing 2 H3O+ and 2 Cl^-, so their activities are each 0.01. So [H3O+]^2 [Cl^-]^2 = (0.01)^2 * (0.01)^2 = (0.01)^4 = 1e-8.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, using the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (0.0592 V / n) * log Q.

n is the number of electrons transferred, which is 2.

So plugging in the numbers:

E = 0.223 V - (0.0592 / 2) * log(1e-8)

log(1e-8) is log(10^-8) = -8.

So,

E = 0.223 V - (0.0296) * (-8) 

= 0.223 + (0.0296 *8)

0.0296 *8 = 0.2368

So E = 0.223 + 0.2368 = 0.4598 V, approximately 0.460 V.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.459 V, which matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

E° was calculated as 0.223 V. Then, (0.0592 / 2) is 0.0296 V. Multiply by log(1e-8)=-8, so 0.0296 * (-8) = -0.2368. So E = 0.223 - (-0.2368) = 0.223 +0.2368=0.4598 V.

Yes, that's correct. So the cell voltage is approximately 0.459 V, which is option F.
</think>

The problem involves determining the cell voltage for a reaction under non-standard conditions using the Nernst equation. The reaction provided is:

\[
\text{H}_2(g) + 2\text{AgCl}(s) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2\text{Ag}(s) + 2\text{H}_3\text{O}^+(\text{aq}) + 2\text{Cl}^-(\text{aq})
\]

Given data includes the standard free energy of formation for AgCl(s), H₂O(l), and (H₃O⁺ + Cl⁻)(aq). The activities of H₃O⁺ and Cl⁻ are 0.01, while the activity of H₂ is unity.

### Step 1: Calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°)
The standard Gibbs free energy change is calculated using:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \sum \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

- **Reactants**:
  - 2AgCl(s): \( 2 \times (-109.7) = -219.4 \, \text{kJ} \)
  - 2H₂O(l): \( 2 \times (-237.2) = -474.4 \, \text{kJ} \)
  - H₂(g): \( 0 \, \text{kJ} \) (element in standard state)

- **Products**:
  - 2Ag(s): \( 0 \, \text{kJ} \) (element in standard state)
  - 2(H₃O⁺ + Cl⁻)(aq): \( 2 \times (-368.4) = -736.8 \, \text{kJ} \)

\[
\Delta G^\circ = (-736.8) - [(-219.4) + (-474.4)] = -736.8 + 693.8 = -43.0 \, \text{kJ} = -43,000 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the standard cell potential (E°)
Using the relation \( \Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ \), where \( n = 2 \) (moles of electrons transferred) and \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \):

\[
E^\circ = \frac{-\Delta G^\circ}{nF} = \frac{-(-43,000)}{2 \times 96485} = \frac{43,000}{192,970} \approx 0.223 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the Nernst equation
The Nernst equation is:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q
\]

The reaction quotient \( Q \) is:

\[
Q = \frac{[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+][\text{Cl}^-]^2}{\text{activity of H}_2 \times (\text{activity of AgCl})^2}
\]

Since AgCl and H₂O are solids and liquids, their activities are 1. Given \( [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = [\text{Cl}^-] = 0.01 \):

\[
Q = (0.01)^2 \times (0.01)^2 = (0.0001)^2 = 1 \times 10^{-8}
\]

Substitute into the Nernst equation:

\[
E = 0.223 - \frac{0.0592}{2} \log(1 \times 10^{-8})
\]

\[
\log(1 \times 10^{-8}) = -8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = 0.223 - (0.0296)(-8) = 0.223 + 0.2368 = 0.4598 \, \text{V}
\]

### Final Answer:
The cell voltage is approximately **0.459 V**, corresponding to option **F**.

**Answer:** F
