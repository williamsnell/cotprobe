Okay, so I've got this question about the CPU and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking which special purpose storage location both the ALU and the control section of the CPU use. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the CPU has two main parts: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and the Control Unit. The ALU handles the arithmetic and logic operations, while the Control Unit manages the instructions and coordinates the overall operation of the computer.

The question is about a storage location that's used by both these sections. So, I'm thinking about what kind of storage locations are inside the CPU. I know that registers are small storage units within the CPU used to hold data and instructions temporarily. Registers are crucial because they allow the CPU to work with data quickly since they're part of the CPU and not the slower main memory.

Looking at the options, option C is Registers. I'm pretty sure that both the ALU and the Control Unit use registers. For example, the ALU might use registers to hold the operands for arithmetic operations, and the Control Unit might use registers to store instruction pointers or flags.

Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A is Multiplexers, which are used to select between multiple input signals, not storage. Option B is Memory Cache, which is a type of memory, but it's usually external to the CPU, not a storage location within both sections. Option D is Flip-Flops, which are parts of memory circuits but probably not the answer here. Option E is Buffers, which are used for temporary storage but typically for communication between components, not internal storage. Option F is Decoders, which decode instructions, but they don't store data. Option G is Encoders, which convert data into codes, not storage. Option H is Latches, which are used to store data but are more basic than registers. Option I is Accumulators, which are a type of register, but they're specific to ALU operations, not the control section. Option J is Transistors, which are building blocks but not storage locations.

So, putting it all together, both the ALU and Control Unit use registers as their special storage locations. The answer should be C: Registers.

The correct answer is C: Registers.

Both the ALU and control section of the CPU utilize registers as their special purpose storage locations.

Answer: C
