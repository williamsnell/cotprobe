Okay, so I need to calculate Buzz Reinhaus's total earnings for the week. Let's see, he worked 63 hours in total. His regular rate is $2.60 per hour. He was paid time and a half for 15 hours and double time for 9 hours. 

Hmm, right, time and a half means 1.5 times the regular rate, and double time is 2 times the regular rate. So I should break down his pay into three parts: regular hours, time and a half, and double time.

Wait, but how many regular hours did he work? Because he worked 63 hours in total, but 15 were time and a half, and 9 were double time. So the regular hours must be 63 minus 15 minus 9. Let me do that math: 63 -15 is 48, minus 9 is 39. So he worked 39 regular hours.

Now, let's calculate each part:

Regular pay: 39 hours * $2.60/hour. Let me compute that. 39 * 2.60. Well, 40 hours would be 40*2.60= $104. But since it's 39, that's 104 minus 2.60, which is $101.40.

Time and a half pay: 15 hours * 1.5 * $2.60. So first, 1.5 * 2.60 = $3.90 per hour. Then 15 * 3.90. Let me calculate that. 10 hours would be 39, and 5 hours would be half of that, so 19.5. So 39 +19.5 = $58.50.

Double time pay: 9 hours * 2 * $2.60. So 2 *2.60 is $5.20 per hour. Then 9 *5.20. Let's compute that: 10 hours would be 52, so 9 is 52 -5.20, which is $46.80.

Now, adding all these together: $101.40 (regular) + $58.50 (time and a half) + $46.80 (double time).

Let's add 101.40 and 58.50 first. 101 +58 is 159, and 0.40 +0.50 is 0.90, so that's $159.90. Then add 46.80 to that. 159.90 +46.80. 150+40 is 190, 9.90 +6.80 is 16.70. So 190 +16.70 is $206.70.

Wait, but let me check the math again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when adding up, it's easy to slip.

Regular pay: 39 *2.60. Let's compute 39 *2 =78, and 39*.60=23.4. So 78+23.4=101.40. Correct.

Time and a half: 15 *1.5*2.60. 15 *1.5 is 22.5 hours at regular rate, but wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, no, the pay is 1.5 times the rate. So 15 hours * (1.5 *2.60). So 1.5*2.60 is 3.90. 15*3.90. Let me do it as 10*3.90=39, 5*3.90=19.5, total 58.50. Correct.

Double time: 9 *2*2.60 =9*5.20. 9*5=45, 9*.20=1.80, so 45+1.80=46.80. Correct.

Adding 101.40 +58.50 =159.90, then +46.80. 159.90 +46.80: 159 +46 is 205, 0.90 +0.80 is 1.70, so total 206.70. That matches one of the options. Looking at the options, option B is $206.70. So the answer should be B.

Buzz Reinhaus worked 39 regular hours at $2.60, 15 time and a half hours at $3.90, and 9 double time hours at $5.20. Calculating each part: 39×2.60=101.40, 15×3.90=58.50, 9×5.20=46.80. Total earnings: 101.40 +58.50 +46.80 = $206.70.
