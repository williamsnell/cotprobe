Question:

In an automobile accident case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by driving at an excessive speed. The defendant's attorney calls its first witness, who was standing along the side of the road when the plaintiff's and defendant's cars collided. The defendant's attorney asks the witness: "Is it a fact that in your estimation, plaintiff was traveling at a speed of 45 m. p. h. in a 35 m. p. h. speed zone at the time of the accident?" The plaintiff objects. The trial judge should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because the judge may take judicial notice of the speed limit within the jurisdiction.
B: overrule the objection if the witness has already been shown to be an experienced driver who was able to estimate the approximate speed of moving vehicles.
C: sustain the objection if the witness has not been qualified as an expert witness.
D: sustain the objection, because the witness is not an adverse witness.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about evidence law, specifically regarding a witness's testimony about speed. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is an automobile accident case where the defendant is claiming that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by speeding. The defendant's attorney called a witness who was standing by the road when the accident happened. The attorney is asking the witness if, in their estimation, the plaintiff was going 45 mph in a 35 mph zone. The plaintiff objects, and we need to determine what the trial judge should do.

First, I remember that in evidence law, lay witnesses can sometimes give opinions if they're based on their perception and helpful to understanding the testimony. But there are rules about when such opinions are allowed. Specifically, a lay witness can testify to their opinion about speed if they have some basis, like experience, to make that estimation.

I think about the rules of evidence, like Federal Rule of Evidence 701, which says that a lay witness's opinion must be based on their perception, helpful to understanding the testimony, and not based on specialized knowledge that would require expert testimony. So, if the witness is an experienced driver and can estimate speed, their opinion might be allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A suggests the judge may take judicial notice of the speed limit. But I don't think judicial notice is about the speed limit itself; it's more about facts that are generally known or can be taken as correct. So the witness's opinion on speed isn't something the judge can just take notice of, unless maybe the speed limit is a fact the judge knows, but the witness's estimation is their own perception.

Option B says overrule if the witness is an experienced driver who can estimate speed. That seems to align with what I was thinkingâ€”lay opinion based on personal experience is acceptable.

Option C says sustain if the witness isn't an expert. But wait, the issue isn't whether the witness is an expert; it's whether their opinion is admissible as a layperson. So if the witness is a layperson with the right experience, their opinion should be allowed, so sustaining the objection here would be incorrect.

Option D mentions the witness isn't an adverse witness. I don't think that's relevant here. The question is about whether the testimony is appropriate, not about the witness's status as adverse.

So putting it together, the judge should overrule the objection if the witness has the necessary experience to estimate speed. That points to option B.

The trial judge should overrule the objection if the witness has been shown to be an experienced driver who is capable of estimating the approximate speed of moving vehicles. This is because lay witnesses can provide opinions based on their perception and personal experience, as long as their testimony is helpful to understanding the case and does not require specialized knowledge. 

Answer: B
