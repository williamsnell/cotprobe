Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mr. Atlas proceeds after discounting his note. Let's break this down step by step. 

First, the note is for $45,000, and he's discounting it 120 days before it's due. The bank's discount rate is 6%. I remember that when you discount a note, the bank subtracts the discount from the face value of the note to give you the proceeds. 

I think the formula for calculating the discount is something like the face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time. But wait, time needs to be in years, right? Because interest rates are usually annual rates. So 120 days... how do I convert that into years?

Well, there are 360 days in a year, I think, when using simple interest calculations. So 120 days would be 120/360, which simplifies to 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 years. 

So the discount amount would be $45,000 * 6% * (120/360). Let me compute that. 6% as a decimal is 0.06. So 45,000 multiplied by 0.06 is 2,700. Then multiply that by 1/3. 2,700 divided by 3 is 900. So the discount is $900.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. The formula for the discount is indeed Face Value * Rate * Time. Time is 120/360 = 1/3. So yes, 45,000 * 0.06 * (1/3) equals 900.

So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount. That's 45,000 - 900 = 44,100. Looking at the options, A is 44,100. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the time is calculated differently. If the bank uses 365 days in a year, 120/365 is about 0.3288. Let me try that. 45,000 * 0.06 = 2,700. 2,700 * 0.3288 ≈ 887.76. So the discount would be about $887.76, and the proceeds would be 45,000 - 887.76 ≈ 44,112.24. But none of the options are close to that. The options are all in whole numbers, so maybe 360 days is the correct approach.

Wait, another thought: sometimes banks might use exact days or banker's years (360 days). Since the question doesn't specify, I think it's standard to use 360 days for such calculations. So I'll stick with my original calculation.

So the discount is $900, and the proceeds are $44,100. Looking at the options, A is $44,100. Hmm, but wait, another way to think about this is using the simple interest formula to find the discount. Let me write it out again:

Discount = Principal × Rate × Time
= 45,000 × 0.06 × (120/360)
= 45,000 × 0.06 × (1/3)
= 45,000 × 0.02
= 900.

Yes, that's correct. So the proceeds are $45,000 - $900 = $44,100, which is option A. But wait, looking at the options, option E is $43,500, which is way lower. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

Wait, 45,000 multiplied by 0.02 is 900, correct. So 45,000 minus 900 is 44,100. So option A. But I'm a bit confused because another approach might consider the discount rate differently. Maybe I should use the formula for the present value of a simple interest note, which is similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the proceeds, which is the amount Mr. Atlas receives, so it's face value minus the discount. So yes, 44,100. So option A. But wait, looking at the options again, another option is J: 43,950. Did I miscalculate the time?

Wait, perhaps the time is 120 days, which is 4 months. If the rate is 6% annually, then monthly rate is 0.5% (6% /12). So 4 months would be 4*0.5% = 2%. So discount is 45,000 * 2% = 900. Same result. So proceeds are 44,100. So A is correct.

But wait, in the options, A is 44,100, which is the first option. So I think that's the right answer.

The correct answer is A: $44,100.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine the Discount Amount:**
   - Face Value (Principal) = $45,000
   - Discount Rate = 6% annually
   - Time = 120 days
   - Convert days to years: 120/360 = 1/3 year
   - Discount = Principal × Rate × Time = 45,000 × 0.06 × (1/3) = $900

2. **Calculate Proceeds:**
   - Proceeds = Face Value - Discount = 45,000 - 900 = $44,100

**Answer: A**
