Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about a term related to hare, and I need to figure out which option is correct. The question is: "Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without regard for whether people’s interests are pursued by them as:"

Hmm, first off, I'm trying to think if "hare" is a term I'm familiar with in this context. I've heard "hare" before in phrases like "harebrained," which means someone is acting rashly or without much thought. But I'm not sure if that's related here.

Wait, maybe it's referring to a specific concept or theory. I remember hearing about something called "hare" in the context of ethics or political theory. Let me think. Oh, right! There's a term called "hare Krishnamurti," but I don't think that's it. Or maybe it's part of a different concept.

Alternatively, could "hare" be a typo or mishearing? Like, maybe it's "Hare Krishna," but that's a religious movement, not related to endorsing ideals without considering people's interests. Or perhaps it's "Hare" as a name, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe it's referring to a political or philosophical term. There's a term called "hare" in voting systems, like the Hare system, which is a highest averages method for proportional allocation. But that doesn't seem to fit the context of ideals and people's interests.

Alternatively, could it be related to the concept of "hare-kidney" or something in biology? That doesn't make sense here. Maybe it's a term from a specific book or theory that I'm not recalling.

Let me look at the options again. The choices are A through H: fanatics, irrationalists, purists, non-pragmatists, radicals, amoralists, maniacs, immoralists. Hmm, so the term "hare" refers to someone who endorses ideals without considering whether people's interests are being pursued. So, the person is focused purely on ideals, possibly ignoring practical outcomes.

Thinking about the options, "fanatics" are people who are excessively enthusiastic about a cause, sometimes without considering others' views. "Purists" are people who stick to pure principles without compromise. "Non-pragmatists" would be those who don't use practical methods, perhaps idealistic. "Radicals" are people who support fundamental changes, sometimes without considering the consequences.

Wait, I think I've heard the term "hare" used in the context of political theory. There's a method called the "Hare system" in voting, but that's not it. Alternatively, in some contexts, "hare" is associated with someone who acts without considering the consequences, like a harebrained person. But harebrained is more about being rash or silly.

Alternatively, maybe it's a misremembered term. I think the actual term is "idealist" or "utopian," but those aren't options here. Wait, perhaps it's "hare" as in someone who is a "purist," because purists focus on ideals without considering practicality.

Wait, I think I remember a concept where someone is so focused on ideals that they don't care about the practical effects. That's a "purist," someone who adheres strictly to principles without considering outcomes. So, the answer might be C: purists.

Alternatively, could it be "non-pragmatists" (D)? Because pragmatists focus on practical effects, so non-pragmatists wouldn't. But I'm not sure if "hare" refers to that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the question. It says "hare refers to people who endorse ideals without regard for whether people’s interests are pursued." So, they're focused on ideals, not on whether those ideals actually benefit people.

So, the term is someone who is focused on ideals regardless of practical outcomes. That fits with "purists," who stick to pure principles without compromise. So, I think the answer is C: purists.

The term "hare" in this context refers to someone who endorses ideals without considering whether pursuing those ideals aligns with people's interests. This aligns with the concept of a "purist," who adheres strictly to principles without compromising for practical outcomes.
