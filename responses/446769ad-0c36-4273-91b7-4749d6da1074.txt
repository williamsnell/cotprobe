Okay, so I have this history question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking why Britain imposed new taxes on their American colonies. The options are A through D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the American colonies were under British rule, and there was a lot of tension between them. Taxation was a big issue that led to the American Revolution. But why did Britain start taxing them more?

Option A says it was to increase the wealth of King George III. Well, I know that the king's personal wealth wasn't the main reason. The British government, especially under Prime Minister George Grenville, was looking to increase revenue, not just the king's pocket. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B mentions the growing costs of war with France. Oh, wait, I think around that time, Britain was involved in the Seven Years' War, also known as the French and Indian War in America. After the war, Britain had a lot of debt, so they wanted the colonies to help pay for it. That makes sense because I remember the Proclamation of 1763 and the taxes like the Stamp Act were passed after the war to raise money. So B seems like a strong possibility.

Option C is anger at America's growing prosperity. While the colonies were growing and becoming more economically independent, I don't think Britain was jealous of their prosperity. More likely, it was about money and control rather than jealousy. So C doesn't sound right.

Option D is pressure from rich merchants. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe some merchants wanted more control or better trade policies, but I don't recall the main reason for taxation being merchant pressure. It was more about the national debt and defense costs after the war.

Putting it all together, the main reason was the high costs after fighting the war with France, so the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: The growing costs of war with France. After the Seven Years' War (1756â€“1763), also known as the French and Indian War in America, Britain incurred significant debt and sought to offset these costs by taxing the colonies. This led to the implementation of taxes like the Stamp Act and other measures that eventually contributed to the tensions leading up to the American Revolution.

Answer: B
