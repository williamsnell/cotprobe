Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a social psychology phenomenon. The question is asking which term describes when like-minded groups take more extreme positions than the individuals in the group. The options are A to J, and I need to figure out the correct answer.

Let me start by understanding the question. It's about groups where people who already agree with each other end up taking more extreme stances when they come together. I remember that in group settings, sometimes the group's decisions or opinions can be more extreme than what individuals would hold on their own.

Looking at the options, I need to recall what each term means.

Option A: Group polarization. I think this is when a group's stance becomes more extreme than the individuals' because they discuss and reinforce each other's views. That seems to fit the question.

Option B: Deindividuation. That's when people lose their sense of individuality in a group, often leading to disinhibited behavior. Not exactly about taking more extreme positions, more about losing self-awareness.

Option C: Group escalation. I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe it's about increasing conflict or intensity in groups, but I'm not certain if it's the same as polarization.

Option D: Conformity pressure. This is about people changing their views to fit in with the group, which can lead to groupthink, but I think it's a bit different from polarization.

Option E: Groupthink. That's when a group makes decisions without considering alternative viewpoints, leading to poor decisions. But it's more about the process than the extremity of positions.

Option F: Shared identity effect. This might relate to how group identity influences behavior, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about taking more extreme positions.

Option G: Group conformity. Similar to D, it's about conforming to the group, but again, not exactly the same as polarization.

Option H: Social facilitation. This is about how the presence of others can improve or impair task performance, not about opinion extremity.

Option I: Social amplification. I think this refers to how social interactions can amplify certain behaviors or emotions, but not specifically about group opinions becoming more extreme.

Option J: Collective bias. This might refer to biases held by the group as a whole, but I'm not sure if it's the same as polarization.

So, going back, group polarization seems to fit because it's about groups becoming more extreme in their views when they discuss and reinforce each other's positions. I've heard of the concept where two like-minded people end up more extreme than either of them individually. That's group polarization.

I should double-check the other options. Deindividuation is more about losing individuality, so probably not. Group escalation I'm not as familiar with, but I think it's more about increasing conflict rather than opinion extremity. Groupthink is more about poor decision-making due to not considering alternatives.

Yes, so the answer is A: group polarization.

The correct answer is A: group polarization. This term describes the phenomenon where like-minded groups take more extreme positions than the individuals within the group due to the reinforcement of shared views during discussions.

Answer: A
