Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about camera lenses and diffraction limits. Hmm, I remember that when you stop down a lens (make the aperture smaller), there comes a point where diffraction starts to degrade image quality. The question is asking how far the lens can be stopped down before that happens.

The given parameters are a focal length of 50 mm and a diameter of 25 mm. The resolution is 200 lines per mm. Wait, lines per mm, so that's the number of line pairs per millimeter that the lens can resolve. I think the formula for the diffraction limit is related to the wavelength of light and the aperture size. 

I recall that the resolving power is given by the Rayleigh criterion, which is roughly (1.22 * λ) / (2 * D), where λ is the wavelength and D is the diameter of the aperture. But wait, the resolution is given as 200 lines/mm, so each line is a pair, meaning the spacing is 1/(200) mm per line pair. Or wait, maybe the spacing is 1/(2 * 200) mm, because each line pair consists of two lines. No, wait, the resolution is the number of line pairs per mm, so the spacing between each pair is 1/200 mm. So the formula for the Rayleigh criterion would be (1.22 * λ) / (D) equals the minimum resolvable feature, which is the spacing between the lines. 

Wait, no, the Rayleigh criterion is about the angular resolution, so maybe I need to relate it to the focal length as well. Oh right, the formula for the diffraction limit in terms of the spatial frequency is that the maximum spatial frequency (like the resolution) is (1.22 * λ)/(D). But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The resolving power R is given by R = (1.22 * λ)/(D), where R is the number of lines per millimeter. Wait, no, maybe R is in cycles per mm, so for 200 lines/mm, that's 100 cycles/mm, because each cycle is a pair. Wait, no, actually, lines/mm is line pairs per mm. So R is 200 line pairs/mm, which is 200 cycles/mm. So R = 200 lines/mm = 200 cycles/mm. So R = (1.22 * λ) / D. So rearranging this, D = (1.22 * λ) / R.

But wait, I think the wavelength λ is typically around 550 nm for green light, which is 0.55 micrometers or 550e-9 meters. So let's plug in the numbers. D equals (1.22 * 550e-9 m) divided by R, which is 200 lines/mm. Wait, but units here might be tricky. Let's convert everything into mm.

Wait, 550 nm is 0.55 micrometers, which is 0.00055 mm. So 550e-9 meters is 0.00055 mm. So D = (1.22 * 0.00055 mm) / (200 lines/mm). Let me calculate that. 1.22 * 0.00055 is approximately 0.000671. Then divide by 200, which is 0.000671 / 200 = 0.000003355 mm. Wait, that can't be right because that's 3.355e-6 mm, which is 3.355 micrometers. That seems way too small. Did I mess up the units?

Wait, perhaps I should express R in cycles per millimeter. Since 200 lines/mm is equivalent to 100 cycles/mm because each cycle is a pair of lines. Oh wait no, lines per mm is line pairs per mm, so 200 line pairs/mm is 200 cycles/mm. So R is 200 cycles/mm.

So D = (1.22 * λ) / R. Let me compute that again. λ is 550 nm = 0.55 micrometers = 0.00055 mm. So D = (1.22 * 0.00055 mm) / 200. Let's compute 1.22 * 0.00055 = 0.000671 mm. Then 0.000671 mm divided by 200 is 0.000003355 mm, which is 3.355e-6 mm, which is 3.355 micrometers. That's way too small compared to the lens diameter of 25 mm. That doesn't make sense because the current aperture is 25 mm, and diffraction at that size would probably not limit until a much smaller aperture. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait another approach: the resolving power R (in lines/mm) is given by R = (115 * D) / (λ * 1000), because 1.22 * 250 = ~305, but wait, perhaps I should look up the formula again. Alternatively, the formula is often written as R = (1.22 * D) / λ, where R is in cycles/mm, D is the diameter in mm, and λ in mm.

Wait, let me get the formula correct. The Rayleigh criterion for the resolving power is R = (1.22 * D) / λ, where R is in line pairs per millimeter (so 200 in this case), D is the aperture diameter in mm, and λ is the wavelength in mm.

So rearranging, D = (R * λ) / 1.22. Wait, that makes more sense. So D equals (R times lambda) divided by 1.22.

So R is 200 line pairs/mm, λ is 550 nm, which is 550e-9 meters, or 0.00055 mm. So D = (200 * 0.00055 mm) / 1.22. Let's compute that: 200 * 0.00055 = 0.11 mm. Then 0.11 / 1.22 ≈ 0.09016 mm. Wait, that's about 0.09 mm, which is 90 micrometers. But the current diameter is 25 mm, so if the maximum D before diffraction limits is 0.09 mm, that would mean the lens can't be stopped down beyond that. But that doesn't make sense because 0.09 mm is way smaller than 25 mm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I have the formula inverted. Because when you stop down the lens (reduce the aperture), the diffraction becomes more significant. So the maximum D (aperture) before diffraction is when the resolving power equals the given R. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum aperture size that allows the resolution to be R. So when D increases, the resolving power R increases as well, because R = (1.22 * D) / λ. So to find the maximum D that still maintains R, but that doesn't make sense because as D increases, R increases, meaning better resolution. So perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum D (aperture) that just allows the resolution to be 200 lines/mm. But wait, no, the problem is asking how far the lens can be stopped down, meaning how small can D get before R drops below 200. So we're looking for the D where R equals 200; beyond that, R would be lower, leading to worse resolution.

Wait, but if R = (1.22 * D) / λ, then for R=200, D = (200 * λ) / 1.22. So plugging in λ=550e-9 m, which is 0.00055 mm. So D = (200 * 0.00055 mm) / 1.22 ≈ (0.11 mm) / 1.22 ≈ 0.09016 mm, which is about 90 micrometers. But the current diameter is 25 mm, which is way larger than 90 micrometers. So this suggests that the lens can be stopped down all the way down to 0.09 mm before diffraction limits the resolution. But that can't be right because 0.09 mm is 90 micrometers, which is a very small aperture, but the options given are much larger, like 2 mm, 3 mm, up to 12 mm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in units.

Wait, wait, maybe I should use the formula in terms of millimeters correctly. Let me re-calculate. λ is 550 nm = 0.55 micrometers = 0.00055 mm. So R = (1.22 * D) / λ, where R is in lines/mm, D in mm, λ in mm.

So plugging in R = 200:

200 = (1.22 * D) / 0.00055

So D = (200 * 0.00055) / 1.22

200 * 0.00055 = 0.11

0.11 / 1.22 ≈ 0.09016 mm, which is 90 micrometers. But the current aperture is 25 mm, so stopping down to 90 micrometers would be a much smaller aperture, but the options are way larger than that. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait another approach: Maybe the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D * f), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the formula for the diffraction limit in terms of the f-number? Because f-number is related to the aperture. The f-number is f/D. So the f-number is 50 mm / D. So if I can find the f-number where diffraction limits resolution, I can find D.

Alternatively, the diffraction limit formula for the smallest feature resolvable is (1.22 * λ * f) / D. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula that relates the maximum aperture diameter D for a given resolution. Let me think again. The Rayleigh criterion says that the minimum resolvable feature is approximately (1.22 * λ * f) / D. So the feature size is (1.22 * λ * f) / D. But the resolution is given as 200 lines/mm, which means the spacing between lines is 1/(2*200) mm, because each line pair is two lines. Wait, no, 200 lines/mm is 200 line pairs per mm, so the spacing is 1/(200) mm per line pair. Because each line pair is a dark and light line, so the spacing between the centers of each line pair is 1/(200) mm, which is 5 micrometers.

So the feature size (d) is 5 micrometers. So according to the Rayleigh criterion, d = (1.22 * λ * f) / D.

Wait, but let's get the units right. λ is in mm, f is in mm, D is in mm.

So d = (1.22 * λ * f) / D.

We can rearrange for D: D = (1.22 * λ * f) / d.

Plugging in the numbers:

λ = 550 nm = 0.00055 mm.

f = 50 mm.

d = 1/(200) mm = 0.005 mm.

So D = (1.22 * 0.00055 mm * 50 mm) / 0.005 mm.

Let me compute that:

1.22 * 0.00055 = 0.000671.

0.000671 * 50 = 0.03355.

0.03355 / 0.005 = 6.71 mm.

So D ≈ 6.71 mm.

Wait, but the current lens diameter is 25 mm. So the maximum D before diffraction limits the resolution is 6.71 mm. So the lens can be stopped down (aperture reduced) until D reaches 6.71 mm. But wait, the question is asking how far the lens can be stopped down before diffraction begins to limit the image quality. So the maximum stopping down would be when D is as small as possible, but before the resolution drops below 200 lines/mm. So the minimum D is 6.71 mm. So the lens can be stopped down to approximately 6.71 mm.

Looking at the options, option H is 6 mm, which is close. So the answer would be H:6 mm.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

So d = (1.22 * λ * f) / D → D = (1.22 * λ * f) / d.

λ = 550e-9 m = 0.00055 mm.

f = 50 mm.

d = 1/(200) mm = 0.005 mm.

So D = (1.22 * 0.00055 * 50) / 0.005.

Compute numerator: 1.22 * 0.00055 = 0.000671.

0.000671 * 50 = 0.03355.

Divide by 0.005: 0.03355 / 0.005 = 6.71 mm.

Yes, that seems correct. So the maximum D before diffraction limits is 6.71 mm, so the lens can be stopped down to approximately 6.7 mm. Among the options, H is 6 mm, which is the closest.

To determine how far the lens can be stopped down before diffraction effects limit the image quality, we use the Rayleigh criterion for resolution. The resolving power \( R \) is given as 200 lines/mm, which corresponds to a feature size \( d = \frac{1}{200} \, \text{mm} = 0.005 \, \text{mm} \). The focal length \( f \) is 50 mm, and the wavelength of light \( \lambda \) is approximately 550 nm (\( 0.00055 \, \text{mm} \)).

The Rayleigh criterion relates these quantities to the aperture diameter \( D \) as:

\[
d = \frac{1.22 \cdot \lambda \cdot f}{D}
\]

Rearranging for \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{1.22 \cdot \lambda \cdot f}{d}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
D = \frac{1.22 \cdot 0.00055 \, \text{mm} \cdot 50 \, \text{mm}}{0.005 \, \text{mm}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
1.22 \cdot 0.00055 = 0.000671
\]

\[
0.000671 \cdot 50 = 0.03355
\]

Now divide by \( d = 0.005 \, \text{mm} \):

\[
D = \frac{0.03355}{0.005} \approx 6.71 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the lens can be stopped down to approximately \( 6.71 \, \text{mm} \) before diffraction limits the resolution. Among the given options, the closest value is **6 mm**.
