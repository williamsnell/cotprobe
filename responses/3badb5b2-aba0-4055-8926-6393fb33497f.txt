Okay, so I've got this question about an induction motor, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: An induction motor carries a rotor current per phase of 10 amperes when loaded until the slip is 5 percent. The rotor effective resistance is 0.1 ohms per phase. I need to determine the internal power developed per phase. The options are from A to J, with some values in ohms and watts.

Hmm, I remember that in induction motors, the rotor's resistance plays a role in calculating various parameters like current, voltage, and power. The slip is given as 5%, which I think is the ratio of the difference between the synchronous speed and the actual speed of the rotor to the synchronous speed. But I'm not entirely sure how that directly affects the power calculation.

Wait, the formula for power in an electrical component is usually P = I²R, right? Oh, but wait, that's for resistive loads. Since the rotor has resistance, maybe that's applicable here. But I should double-check.

So, the rotor current per phase is 10 A, and the resistance per phase is 0.1 ohms. If I use P = I²R, that would be (10)^2 * 0.1. Let's calculate that: 100 * 0.1 equals 10 watts. Oh, but wait, 10 watts is one of the options, option H. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach here.

Wait, but I think I might be missing something about the slip in this calculation. The slip is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. Does that affect the power? Or is the slip used elsewhere, like in calculating the torque or something else?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the rotor current with something else. Let me think again about the basics of induction motors. The rotor's current is related to the slip. The rotor's induced EMF is E = 4.44 * K * φ2 * R2, where K is the voltage factor and φ2 is the rotor flux. But perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, the rotor's current is I2, and the resistance per phase is R2. The power per phase would be I2² * R2. But wait, that's the same as what I did earlier. So 10^2 * 0.1 = 10 W, which is option H. But I've seen some formulas where the power is also considering the slip, like the mechanical power being something else, but the question is about the internal power developed per phase.

Wait, another thought: the slip affects the rotor speed, but for the power calculation based on resistance, maybe the slip doesn't directly affect the power since it's purely resistive. So perhaps it's just I²R. But I'm not entirely confident because sometimes when slip changes, the rotor resistance's effective value might change, but in this problem, the resistance is given as 0.1 ohms per phase, so maybe it's fixed.

Wait, another angle: The rotor's current is 10 A, and the resistance is 0.1 ohms. So the power per phase would be I²R. So that's 10^2 * 0.1 = 10 W. So that would be option H. But wait, let me check if the slip affects the current.

Wait, no, the current in the rotor is given as 10 A per phase. The slip might affect other parameters, but the current is provided, so perhaps the calculation is straightforward.

But wait, another thought: The internal power developed per phase is the power dissipated in the rotor's resistance, which is I²R. So that would be 10^2 * 0.1 = 10 W. So the answer would be H: 10 watts.

But looking at the options, I see that option C is 95 W, G is 190 W, etc. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the slip affects the rotor's induced EMF and thus the current, but in this problem, the current is given, so perhaps the calculation is correct as is.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the slip when calculating the rotor's voltage. Because the rotor's induced EMF is E2 = s * E1, where s is the slip. But E1 is the stator's induced EMF, which might not be directly given here. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem gives the rotor current and resistance. So perhaps the power is just I²R, regardless of the slip. So 10^2 * 0.1 = 10 W. So option H. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the slip affects the effective voltage, which in turn affects the current. But the current is given as 10 A, so maybe that's the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the power output, not the power dissipated. But that's a different calculation. The power output would involve torque and speed, but the question specifically asks for internal power developed per phase, which probably refers to the power dissipated as heat in the rotor's resistance.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the power developed as mechanical power, but that would involve the torque and speed. But I don't think that's the case here because the question mentions the rotor's effective resistance, so it's about electrical power dissipation.

So, I think the correct approach is to calculate I²R, which gives 10 W. So the answer should be H: 10 watts.

The problem involves calculating the internal power developed per phase in an induction motor. The rotor current per phase is given as 10 A, and the rotor resistance per phase is 0.1 ohms. The slip is 5%, but since the rotor current is provided directly, the slip does not affect the calculation of power dissipated in the rotor's resistance. Using the formula for power in a resistive load, \( P = I^2 R \), the power per phase is calculated as:

\[
P = (10)^2 \times 0.1 = 10 \, \text{watts}.
\]

Thus, the internal power developed per phase is 10 watts.
