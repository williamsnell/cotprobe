Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is about finding the derivative of a function g(x) at x=1. The function is given as g(x) = 1 / (1 + x^(3/2)). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that to find the derivative g'(x), I need to use differentiation rules. Since g(x) is a function of x, I think I can use the chain rule here. The chain rule is used when we have a composition of functions, which is definitely the case here because the denominator is another function of x.

Let me write down the function again: g(x) = 1 / (1 + x^(3/2)). This can also be written as g(x) = (1 + x^(3/2))^-1. That might make it easier to apply the power rule and the chain rule.

So, applying the chain rule, the derivative of g(x) with respect to x would be the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. The outer function here is something raised to the power of -1, and the inner function is (1 + x^(3/2)).

The derivative of the outer function, treating the inner as a single variable, is -1*(inner function)^-2. Then, I need to multiply that by the derivative of the inner function. The inner function is 1 + x^(3/2), so its derivative is the derivative of 1 plus the derivative of x^(3/2).

The derivative of 1 is 0, so that part is easy. The derivative of x^(3/2) is (3/2)*x^(1/2) because I bring down the exponent, multiply by x to the power of (3/2 -1), which is (1/2). So putting that together, the derivative of the inner function is (3/2)*x^(1/2).

Putting it all together, the derivative g'(x) should be:

g'(x) = -1*(1 + x^(3/2))^(-2) * (3/2)*x^(1/2)

Simplify that a bit. So that's:

g'(x) = - (3/2) * x^(1/2) / (1 + x^(3/2))^2

Okay, now I need to evaluate this derivative at x=1. Let's plug in x=1 into the expression.

First, calculate each part:

x^(1/2) when x=1 is sqrt(1) which is 1.

x^(3/2) when x=1 is (1)^(3/2) which is 1 as well.

So the denominator becomes (1 + 1)^2 = (2)^2 = 4.

The numerator is (3/2) * 1 = 3/2.

So putting it together:

g'(1) = - (3/2) / 4

Simplify that. 3/2 divided by 4 is the same as 3/(2*4) = 3/8.

But since there's a negative sign, it's -3/8. Now, converting 3/8 to decimal, 3 divided by 8 is 0.375. So -3/8 is -0.375.

Looking at the options, option A is -0.375, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I apply the chain rule correctly? Yes, I took the outer function's derivative, then multiplied by the inner function's derivative. The exponents: yes, 3/2 minus 1 is 1/2, so that's correct. Plugging in x=1: yes, all terms become 1 where needed. So the calculation seems right. I think I'm confident that the answer is A.

The derivative of g(x) is calculated using the chain rule, resulting in g'(x) = -(3/2)x^(1/2)/(1 + x^(3/2))Â². Evaluating at x=1 gives g'(1) = -3/8 = -0.375.

Answer: A
