Okay, so I have this question about inventory valuation methods, specifically FIFO and LIFO, and how switching from FIFO to LIFO affects ending inventory and income tax payable during a period of inflation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

First, I remember that FIFO stands for First-In, First-Out. That means the oldest inventory items are recorded as sold first. In a period of inflation, prices are rising, so the older items are cheaper. When you sell them, the cost of goods sold (COGS) would be lower because you're using the older, lower prices. That would leave the ending inventory higher because the remaining items are the newer, more expensive ones.

On the other hand, LIFO is Last-In, First-Out. So, the most recently purchased items are sold first. In inflationary times, those recent purchases are at higher prices. So COGS would be higher because you're using the newer, higher prices. This would make the ending inventory lower because the older, cheaper items remain in inventory.

Wait, but the question is about what happens when the company converts from FIFO to LIFO. So before conversion, they were using FIFO. Let's think about the impact of changing methods.

If they were using FIFO, their ending inventory would be higher because they kept the more expensive items. When they switch to LIFO, their ending inventory would be lower because they now report the older, cheaper items as sold, leaving the newer, higher-priced items in inventory. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because with LIFO, you're selling the last-in, which are the higher-priced items, so the ending inventory would consist of the older, lower-priced items, making it lower than before. Wait, but when you switch from FIFO to LIFO, how does that affect the reported ending inventory?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the effect on the financials. Let's say during inflation, using FIFO leads to higher ending inventory because the cost of goods sold is lower. When switching to LIFO, the cost of goods sold increases (because you're using higher prices), so net income goes down. If net income is lower, taxable income is lower, so income tax payable would be lower.

Wait, but the question is about the ending inventory and income tax payable under LIFO compared to FIFO during inflation. So, under FIFO in inflation, ending inventory is higher, and income tax is higher because net income is higher. When switching to LIFO, ending inventory would be lower, and net income would be lower, so tax would be lower.

Wait, but the question is asking what happens when they switch. So, using LIFO would result in lower ending inventory and lower income tax payable compared to FIFO in inflation. So, the ending inventory is lower, and income tax is lower.

Looking at the options, the question is phrased as: During inflation, Mast's ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO would be higher or lower than FIFO? So, both would be lower than FIFO.

Wait, but let me think again. If inflation is high, and you're using LIFO, the ending inventory is valued at the oldest costs, which are lower. So ending inventory is lower than FIFO's ending inventory. Since COGS is higher, net income is lower, leading to lower taxable income and thus lower income tax payable. So both ending inventory and income tax payable are lower with LIFO than FIFO in inflation.

So the answer would be that ending inventory is lower and income tax is lower. Looking at the options, which option says both are lower? Let's check the options.

Options:
A: Same Higher
B: Same Lower
C: Lower Higher
D: Lower Lower
E: Same Same
F: Higher Higher
G: Lower Same
H: Higher Same
I: Higher Lower
J: No change in either

So D is Lower Lower. So the answer should be D: Lower Lower.

The correct answer is D: Lower Lower.
