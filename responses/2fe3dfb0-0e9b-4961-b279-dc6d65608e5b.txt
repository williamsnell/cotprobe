Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the heat transfer coefficient in a pipe. Hmm, let me see. The question gives me the flow rate of water, the temperature, and the pipe's specifications. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that water is moving at 2.5 × 10^-4 m³/sec through a (1/2) inch schedule 80 pipe. The temperature is 350 K. I need to find the heat transfer coefficient, which I think is the Nusselt number or something related to convective heat transfer. Wait, no, the heat transfer coefficient is usually denoted as h, and it's related to Nusselt by h = Nu * λ, where λ is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.

So, I'll need to find the Nusselt number and the thermal conductivity of water at 350 K. Let me jot down what I know:

- Volumetric flow rate, Q = 2.5e-4 m³/s
- Pipe size: ½ inch schedule 80. I need the inner diameter of the pipe to find the cross-sectional area and the velocity. 

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact dimensions of a schedule 80 pipe. I remember that for a ½ inch schedule 80 steel pipe, the outer diameter is 0.875 inches, and the wall thickness is about 0.249 inches. So the inner diameter would be outer diameter minus twice the wall thickness. Let me calculate that.

Outer diameter, D_out = 0.875 inches. Wall thickness, t = 0.249 inches. So inner diameter, D_in = D_out - 2*t = 0.875 - 2*0.249 = 0.875 - 0.498 = 0.377 inches. To convert that to meters: 0.377 inches * 0.0254 m/inch ≈ 0.0095278 m. So radius r = D_in/2 ≈ 0.0047639 m.

Next, the cross-sectional area A = π r². Plugging in r: A ≈ 3.1416 * (0.0047639)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.0000227 ≈ 7.11e-5 m².

Now, the velocity v = Q / A. Q is 2.5e-4 m³/s. So v = 2.5e-4 / 7.11e-5 ≈ 3.516 m/s. That seems reasonable.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the units somewhere. Let me double-check. ½ inch is 0.5 inches. Schedule 80's dimensions: I think the inner diameter for ½ in. Sch 80 is actually 0.540 inches, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the inner diameter from standard pipe dimensions. Oh wait, I think the standard inner diameter for ½ inch schedule 80 is 0.540 inches, so D_in = 0.540 inches. Let me recalculate that.

0.540 inches equals 0.013716 meters. So radius r = 0.006858 m. Then area A = π*(0.006858)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.00004705 ≈ 1.477e-4 m². Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 0.540 inches is 0.013716 meters? No, wait, 1 inch is 0.0254 meters, so 0.540 inches is 0.540 * 0.0254 ≈ 0.013716 m. So radius is half of that, 0.006858 m. Area A = π*(0.006858)^2 ≈ 3.1416*(0.00004705) ≈ 0.0001477 m², which is 1.477e-4 m².

Now, velocity v = Q / A = 2.5e-4 / 1.477e-4 ≈ 1.692 m/s. That seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the pipe dimensions. I think another source says that for a ½ inch schedule 80 pipe, the inner diameter is 0.540 inches. So I'll go with that.

Next, I need to find the thermal conductivity λ of water at 350 K. I remember that λ for water varies with temperature. At around 350 K, which is about 77°C, the thermal conductivity is roughly 0.639 W/m-K. Let me confirm that. Yes, I think that's correct.

Now, to find the Nusselt number. For turbulent flow in a pipe, the Nusselt number can be calculated using the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is Nu = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^0.3, where Re is the Reynolds number and Pr is the Prandtl number.

First, calculate Re. Reynolds number is (v * D_in) / ν, where ν is the kinematic viscosity.

I need the kinematic viscosity of water at 350 K. From tables, at 77°C, ν is approximately 0.650e-6 m²/s. Let me confirm: yes, around 0.650e-6 m²/s.

So Re = (v * D_in) / ν = (1.692 m/s * 0.013716 m) / 0.650e-6 m²/s.

Wait, D_in in meters is 0.013716 m. So v*D_in = 1.692 * 0.013716 ≈ 0.02317 m²/s. Then Re = 0.02317 / 0.650e-6 ≈ 35646. So Re ≈ 35,646.

Next, the Prandtl number for water at 350 K. Pr is approximately 6.11. Let me check: yes, around 6.1 at that temperature.

Now, plug into Dittus-Boelter: Nu = 0.023 * (35646)^0.8 * (6.11)^0.3.

First, calculate (35646)^0.8. Let's see: 35646 is about 3.5646e4. Taking ln(3.5646e4) ≈ ln(35646) ≈ 10.48. Multiply by 0.8: 8.384. Then exp(8.384) ≈ 4700. Wait, no, wait: 35646^0.8 is the same as e^(0.8 * ln(35646)).

Wait, ln(35646) ≈ 10.48. 0.8 * 10.48 = 8.384. e^8.384 ≈ e^8 is 2980, e^8.384 is about 4700. So 35646^0.8 ≈ 4700.

Next, (6.11)^0.3. Let's calculate that. Let's take natural log: ln(6.11) ≈ 1.81. Multiply by 0.3: 0.543. e^0.543 ≈ 1.72.

So Nu ≈ 0.023 * 4700 * 1.72. Let's compute step by step.

0.023 * 4700 = 108.1.

108.1 * 1.72 ≈ 186.2.

So Nu ≈ 186.2.

Now, the heat transfer coefficient h = Nu * λ. λ is 0.639 W/m-K.

h = 186.2 * 0.639 ≈ let's compute that.

186 * 0.6 = 111.6, 186 * 0.039 ≈ 7.254. So total ≈ 118.85 W/m²-K.

Wait, that's about 119, but looking at the options, the closest is 10,060 (D), but that's way higher. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the volumetric flow rate is 2.5e-4 m³/s. I used that to calculate velocity. Let me recalculate the velocity.

Wait, using the correct inner diameter: 0.540 inches is 0.013716 m. Radius r = 0.006858 m. Area A = π * r² = π * (0.006858)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.00004705 ≈ 1.477e-4 m².

Then velocity v = Q / A = 2.5e-4 / 1.477e-4 ≈ 1.692 m/s. That seems correct.

Reynolds number Re = (v * D_in) / ν. ν is 0.650e-6 m²/s. So v*D_in = 1.692 * 0.013716 ≈ 0.02317 m²/s. Re = 0.02317 / 0.650e-6 ≈ 35646. Correct.

Pr is 6.11. So Dittus-Boelter: Nu = 0.023 * (35646)^0.8 * (6.11)^0.3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me calculate (35646)^0.8 correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as (Re)^0.8 = (35646)^0.8.

Let me use logarithms. ln(35646) ≈ 10.48. 0.8 * 10.48 = 8.384. e^8.384 ≈ 4700. So 35646^0.8 ≈ 4700.

(6.11)^0.3: ln(6.11) ≈ 1.81. 0.3 * 1.81 ≈ 0.543. e^0.543 ≈ 1.72.

So 0.023 * 4700 * 1.72 = 0.023 * 4700 = 108.1, then 108.1 * 1.72 ≈ 186.2.

So h = 186.2 * 0.639 ≈ 118.8 W/m²-K. But the options are all in the thousands, like 9,450, 10,000, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units for the pipe diameter. Let me double-check the pipe dimensions.

Wait, perhaps the pipe is ½ inch nominal diameter, but the actual inner diameter is different. Maybe I should use the nominal diameter to find the inner diameter. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct inner diameter for a ½ inch schedule 80 pipe.

Wait, from some references, the inner diameter for ½ inch schedule 80 is 0.540 inches, which is what I used earlier. So that part seems correct.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong kinematic viscosity. Let me check ν at 350 K. At 77°C, ν is around 0.650e-6 m²/s, which seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use dynamic viscosity instead. Wait, no, the formula uses kinematic viscosity.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the flow is laminar, so the Nusselt number would be different. Let me check the Reynolds number: Re ≈ 35,646, which is well above 2100, so it's definitely turbulent. So Dittus-Boelter applies.

Wait, but the calculated h is around 119 W/m²-K, which is not matching any of the options. The options are all in the 9,000 to 10,500 range. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the thermal conductivity at a different temperature or unit conversion error.

Wait, let me check the thermal conductivity again. At 350 K (77°C), λ_water ≈ 0.639 W/m-K. Correct.

Wait, maybe I confused the pipe diameter. Alternatively, perhaps the flow rate is given in m³/h instead of m³/s? Let me check the problem statement again. It says 2.5 × 10^-4 m³/sec, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the outer diameter instead of inner diameter. Let me try that.

If I mistakenly used outer diameter of 0.875 inches (0.022226 m) instead of inner diameter, then the area would be A = π*(0.011113)^2 ≈ 3.801e-5 m². Then velocity v = 2.5e-4 / 3.801e-5 ≈ 6.576 m/s. Then Re = (6.576 * 0.022226) / 0.650e-6 ≈ (0.1461) / 0.650e-6 ≈ 224,769. Then Nu = 0.023*(224769)^0.8*(6.11)^0.3.

(224769)^0.8: ln(224769)=12.32, 0.8*12.32=9.856, e^9.856≈ 18,000. So 0.023*18,000=414. Then 414*(1.72)=712. So h=712*0.639≈455 W/m²-K. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, not matching. So that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flow is actually in the fully turbulent regime but with a lower Re. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different formula, like the Colburn factor or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the thermal conductivity at a different temperature. Let me see: if I take λ as 0.64 W/m-K, which is close to what I had, but maybe that's not the issue.

Wait, another thought: Could the flow rate be in m³/h instead of m³/s? Let me check: 2.5e-4 m³/s is 900 m³/h (since 1 s=3600 s/h). That seems high for a ½ inch pipe. Wait, no, 2.5e-4 m³/s is 0.00025 m³/s. To convert to m³/h, multiply by 3600: 0.00025 *3600=0.9 m³/h. That seems more reasonable.

Wait, but I used 2.5e-4 m³/s correctly earlier. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Moody diagram approach, but that's more complicated and requires iterative calculations, which I can't do mentally.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Nusselt number. Let me recalculate the Dittus-Boelter equation.

Re = 35,646.

Pr = 6.11.

So Nu = 0.023 * (35646)^(0.8) * (6.11)^(0.3).

Let me compute each part again.

(35646)^(0.8):

Take natural log: ln(35646) ≈ 10.48.

0.8 * 10.48 = 8.384.

e^8.384 ≈ e^8 is 2980. e^0.384 ≈ 1.467. So 2980 * 1.467 ≈ 4378. So (35646)^0.8 ≈ 4378.

(6.11)^(0.3):

ln(6.11)=1.81.

0.3 * 1.81=0.543.

e^0.543≈1.72.

So Nu = 0.023 *4378 *1.72.

Compute 0.023 *4378 = 100.694.

Then 100.694 *1.72 ≈ 173.2.

So Nu ≈ 173.2.

h = Nu * λ = 173.2 * 0.639 ≈ let's compute.

170 *0.639=108.63.

3.2 *0.639≈2.0448.

Total ≈108.63 + 2.0448 ≈110.67 W/m²-K.

Still around 110, which is not matching the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't using the Dittus-Boelter equation. Maybe it's using a different method, like the heat transfer formula with velocity and other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient using the formula h = (Q_dot)/(A * ΔT), but I don't have ΔT here. So that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler and uses the formula h = 0.023 * (v * D / ν)^(0.8) * Pr^(0.3) * λ, but I think that's what I did.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem expects the use of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for flow rate, but that's for pressure drop, not heat transfer. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the thermal conductivity at a different temperature. Let me check: if λ is 0.639 W/m-K, but maybe at 350 K it's higher. Wait, at higher temperatures, thermal conductivity of water decreases, actually. Hmm, no, that can't be right. Wait, at higher temperatures, the thermal conductivity increases a bit. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Let me check: at 25°C, λ is about 0.61 W/m-K, and at 100°C, it's about 0.622 W/m-K. So at 350 K (77°C), λ is around 0.639 W/m-K, which I used correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Prandtl number. Let me check: Pr for water at 350 K is indeed around 6.11. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use a different formula. For example, for smooth tubes, sometimes the Nusselt number is given as 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.3. So that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the effect of the pipe's material, but I think that's not needed here since the problem is about the fluid's heat transfer.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the flow rate was given as m³/h, not m³/s. Let me recalculate with that assumption.

If Q is 2.5e-4 m³/s, that's 0.9 m³/h. But if it's 2.5e-4 m³/s, that's correct. Alternatively, if it's 2.5e-4 m³/h, that would be 6.94e-8 m³/s, which would give a much lower velocity, which doesn't make sense because the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps the flow rate is 2.5e-4 m³/s, which is correct, but maybe I should use the outer diameter. Let me try that.

Outer diameter D_out = 0.875 inches = 0.022226 m. Radius r = 0.011113 m. Area A = π*(0.011113)^2 ≈ 3.801e-5 m².

Velocity v = 2.5e-4 / 3.801e-5 ≈ 6.576 m/s.

Re = (6.576 * 0.022226) / 0.650e-6 ≈ (0.1461) / 0.650e-6 ≈ 224,769.

Nu = 0.023*(224769)^0.8*(6.11)^0.3.

(224769)^0.8: ln(224769)=12.32, 0.8*12.32=9.856, e^9.856≈18,000.

So Nu = 0.023 *18,000 *1.72 ≈ 0.023 *18,000=414, 414*1.72≈712.

h=712 *0.639≈455 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Oh! Wait a minute. The options are in thousands, like 9,000 to 10,000. My calculation is about 110, which is way lower. So I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the outer diameter instead of inner diameter? No, because that gave me 455, which is still lower than the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the flow is in the transition region, so Dittus-Boelter isn't accurate. But Re is 35,646, which is well into the turbulent flow.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, like the natural convection, but the flow is forced, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the thermal resistance and relate it differently. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem expects the use of the formula h = 0.023 * (v * D_in / ν)^0.8 * Pr^0.3 * λ, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (35646)^0.8. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Using a calculator, 35646^0.8 = e^(0.8 * ln(35646)).

ln(35646)=10.48.

0.8 *10.48=8.384.

e^8.384= e^8 * e^0.384.

e^8≈2980. e^0.384≈1.467.

So 2980 *1.467≈4378.

So (35646)^0.8≈4378.

Then 4378 *1.72≈7546.

Then 0.023 *7546≈173.5.

h=173.5 *0.639≈110.5 W/m²-K.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different method, like the use of the thermal resistance in series or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of the thermal conductivity of the pipe material, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer coefficient is for the pipe wall, but the problem states 'within the pipe,' which I think refers to the fluid's convective coefficient.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the pipe is made of a material with high thermal conductivity, and the calculation involves the pipe's conductivity, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think it's just the fluid's h.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step where the heat transfer is calculated via another method, like using the flow rate and temperature change. But without knowing the temperature difference, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the mass flow rate instead of volumetric flow rate, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the velocity calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate the area.

Inner diameter D_in=0.540 inches=0.013716 m. Radius r=0.006858 m.

Area A=π*(0.006858)^2= π*(0.00004705)=0.0001477 m².

Velocity v=2.5e-4 / 0.0001477≈1.692 m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Another thought: Maybe the problem expects the use of the thermal conductivity at a different temperature, perhaps 300 K. Let me check λ at 300 K. At 300 K (27°C), λ_water≈0.610 W/m-K. Using that, h=173.5 *0.610≈105.8 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the thermal conductivity at 350 K as 0.64 W/m-K. So 173.5 *0.64≈110.88 W/m²-K.

No, still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flow is in a different regime or that the pipe has a certain roughness. But without that data, I can't adjust Re.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3 * λ, which is the same as what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the units for flow rate are correct. The problem states 2.5 × 10^-4 m³/sec, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure drop, but that's unrelated to heat transfer.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of the velocity and other factors, but I can't think of another formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the surface area and then relate it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the flow is fully developed and use the appropriate Nusselt number correlation, but I think I did that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Prandtl number. Let me confirm: Pr for water at 350 K is approximately 6.11. Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for (35646)^0.8 and (6.11)^0.3.

Let me compute (35646)^0.8 more accurately.

Using a calculator: 35646^0.8 ≈ 4378.

And (6.11)^0.3 ≈ 1.72.

So Nu=0.023 *4378 *1.72 ≈ 0.023 *7546 ≈ 173.5.

h=173.5 *0.639≈110.5 W/m²-K.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the thermal conductivity at a different temperature, but I can't think of any other way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass flow rate instead of volumetric. Let me try that.

Mass flow rate m_dot = ρ * Q, where ρ is density of water at 350 K. At 350 K, ρ ≈ 974 kg/m³.

So m_dot = 974 * 2.5e-4 ≈ 0.2435 kg/s.

But I don't see how that helps without more information.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = (m_dot * c_p * ΔT) / (A * ΔT), but without ΔT, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = (v * λ) / (r), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is referring to the heat transfer coefficient per unit length, but I think the options are per m².

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer coefficient is for the entire pipe length, but I think the options are per square meter.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like h = 0.018 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^0.3 * λ, but that would give a lower h.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different flow regime, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pipe is not smooth, but the problem doesn't provide any info on roughness.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I should use the thermal conductivity at a different temperature, but I can't find a reason for that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^0.3 * λ * (D_in / D_out), but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the outer diameter in the calculation of Re, but that would lead to a higher Re and thus higher h, which might match the options.

Let me try that.

Outer diameter D_out=0.875 inches=0.022226 m.

Then Re = (v * D_out) / ν = (1.692 * 0.022226) / 0.650e-6.

v*D_out=1.692 *0.022226≈0.03756 m²/s.

Re=0.03756 / 0.650e-6≈57,784.

Then Nu=0.023*(57784)^0.8*(6.11)^0.3.

(57784)^0.8: ln(57784)=10.965. 0.8*10.965=8.772. e^8.772≈6,600.

(6.11)^0.3≈1.72.

So Nu=0.023 *6600 *1.72=0.023 *11,352≈261.1.

h=261.1 *0.639≈166.4 W/m²-K.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inner diameter for Re but outer diameter for something else, but I don't think that makes sense.

Another angle: Perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer in a double pipe or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the velocity is in the wrong units. Let me check: velocity is in m/s, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * Pr^0.3 * λ * (D_in / 2), but that would give h in terms of diameter, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the thermal conductivity in a different unit, like kJ instead of W, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is in imperial units, but the options are in metric. Let me check.

Wait, the flow rate is given in m³/s, and the options are in W/m²-K, which is metric. So probably not.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the thermal conductivity in a different way, but I can't think of how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for thermal resistance of the pipe wall, but that's not indicated.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the formula h = (v * λ) / (D_in), but that would be h = (1.692 * 0.639) / 0.013716 ≈ (1.078) / 0.013716 ≈ 78.5 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * (v * D_in / ν)^0.8 * Pr^0.3 * λ, which is what I did, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in exponents.

Wait, let me recalculate Nu with more precise numbers.

Re=35,646.

Pr=6.11.

Compute (Re)^0.8: 35,646^0.8.

Using calculator: 35,646^0.8 ≈ 4378.

(Pr)^0.3:6.11^0.3≈1.72.

So Nu=0.023 *4378 *1.72=0.023 *7546≈173.5.

h=173.5 *0.639≈110.5 W/m²-K.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3 * λ, which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different flow condition, like mixed convection, but without data, I can't proceed.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the problem is using the formula for the heat transfer coefficient in a different way, perhaps considering the pipe's length or other factors, but I don't have that info.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the thermal conductivity at a different temperature. Let me check: If I take λ as 0.64 W/m-K, which is close to what I had, the result is still around 110 W/m²-K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different type of flow, like annular flow, but that's not indicated.

At this point, I'm stuck. My calculation gives around 110 W/m²-K, but the options are all in the thousands. I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the thermal conductivity of the pipe material, like steel, instead of water. Steel's λ is about 43 W/m-K. Let's try that.

h = 173.5 *43 ≈7,460 W/m²-K. That's close to option D:10,060, but not exact. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states 'heat transfer coefficient within the pipe,' which should relate to the fluid, not the pipe material. So that's probably not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the thermal conductivity is in the opposite direction, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient, which includes the pipe wall and fluid, but without knowing the pipe wall thickness and its conductivity, I can't calculate that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula altogether, like the one for heat exchangers, but without more data, I can't apply that.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^0.3 * λ * (D_in / 2), which would be incorrect, but let's see.

D_in/2 is r=0.006858 m.

So h=0.023 *35646^0.8 *6.11^0.3 *0.639 *0.006858.

But that would make h extremely small, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. The formula is h = Nu * λ, where Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3.

I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the thermal conductivity in a different unit, like kJ/(m·K), but that would be 0.639 kJ/(m·K), which is the same as 639 W/(m·K), which is way too high. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere in the calculation. Let me check: If I mistakenly took λ as 639 W/m-K instead of 0.639, then h=173.5 *639≈110,000 W/m²-K, which is way higher than the options. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3 * λ * 1000, but that would make h=110,500 W/m²-K, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Re.

Wait, Re = (v * D_in) / ν.

v=1.692 m/s.

D_in=0.013716 m.

v*D_in=1.692 *0.013716≈0.02317 m²/s.

ν=0.650e-6 m²/s.

Re=0.02317 /0.650e-6≈35646. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the thermal conductivity at a different temperature, say 300 K, which is 0.61 W/m-K. Then h=173.5 *0.61≈105.8 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for natural convection, but the flow is forced, so that's not applicable.

At this point, I'm stuck. My calculation doesn't match any of the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different method, like using the thermal resistance formula or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer coefficient is calculated using the formula h = (v * λ) / (D_in), which would be h= (1.692 * 0.639)/0.013716 ≈1.078/0.013716≈78.5 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3 * λ * 1000, which would give h=110,500 W/m²-K, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different exponent, like Nu=0.023 * Re^0.5 * Pr^0.3, but that would give a lower Nu.

Let me try that.

Nu=0.023*(35646)^0.5*(6.11)^0.3.

(35646)^0.5≈188.8.

(6.11)^0.3≈1.72.

So Nu=0.023*188.8*1.72≈0.023*324.8≈7.47.

h=7.47 *0.639≈4.77 W/m²-K. No, that's way too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using Nu=0.023 * Re^0.6 * Pr^0.3.

(35646)^0.6: ln(35646)=10.48, 0.6*10.48=6.288, e^6.288≈528.

So Nu=0.023*528*1.72≈0.023*906≈20.84.

h=20.84*0.639≈13.26 W/m²-K. Still too low.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with a temperature difference, but without knowing the temperature difference, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula h = (m_dot * c_p * ΔT) / (A * ΔT), but that simplifies to h = m_dot * c_p / A, which isn't helpful without ΔT.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula h = (v * λ) / (D_in / 2), which would be h = (1.692 * 0.639)/(0.006858) ≈1.078/0.006858≈157.3 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^0.3 * λ * (D_in / 2), but that would give h=0.023 *4378 *1.72 *0.639 *0.006858, which is way too small.

At this point, I'm really stuck. My calculation gives around 110 W/m²-K, but the options are all much higher. I must have made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps the problem expects the use of a different formula or data. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is using the thermal conductivity in a different way or that the flow is in a different regime.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of the flow rate and the pipe's surface area, but without knowing the temperature difference, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^0.3 * λ * 1000, which would give h=110,500 W/m²-K, but that's way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different fluid with a higher thermal conductivity. If λ were 1 W/m-K, h=173.5 *1=173.5 W/m²-K, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different pipe size. Let me think: If the pipe were 1 inch instead of ½ inch, the inner diameter would be larger, leading to a lower velocity and higher Re, which would increase h.

Let me try that.

1 inch schedule 80 pipe: inner diameter D_in= 1.040 inches=0.02642 m.

Radius r=0.01321 m.

Area A=π*(0.01321)^2≈5.45e-4 m².

Velocity v=2.5e-4 /5.45e-4≈0.459 m/s.

Re=(0.459 *0.02642)/0.650e-6≈0.01215 /0.650e-6≈18,692.

Pr=6.11.

Nu=0.023*(18692)^0.8*(6.11)^0.3.

(18692)^0.8: ln(18692)=9.835, 0.8*9.835=7.868, e^7.868≈2600.

(6.11)^0.3≈1.72.

So Nu=0.023 *2600 *1.72≈0.023 *4496≈103.4.

h=103.4 *0.639≈65.8 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a 3/4 inch pipe, but without knowing, I can't proceed.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in my approach, but I can't figure it out. Perhaps the correct answer is around 10,000 W/m²-K, which is option D:10,060. But I don't see how to get there with the given data. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Re or Nu. Maybe I should recalculate Re.

Re = (v * D_in) / ν.

v=1.692 m/s.

D_in=0.013716 m.

v*D_in=1.692 *0.013716≈0.02317 m²/s.

ν=0.650e-6 m²/s.

Re=0.02317 /0.650e-6≈35,646. Correct.

So I think I did everything correctly, but the result doesn't match. Perhaps the correct answer is E:9,900, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different formula, but I can't think of any.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^0.3 * λ * 1000, which would give h=110,500 W/m²-K, but that's way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different flow regime, like laminar flow, but Re is 35,646, which is turbulent.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different fluid with a higher Prandtl number. If Pr were higher, say 10, then Nu would be higher.

Let me try Pr=10.

Nu=0.023 *35646^0.8 *10^0.3.

35646^0.8≈4378.

10^0.3≈2.

So Nu=0.023 *4378 *2≈0.023 *8756≈201.4.

h=201.4 *0.639≈128.5 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different fluid, but without knowing, I can't proceed.

In conclusion, I think I must have made a mistake in my approach, but I can't identify where. Given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess. The closest option to my calculation is not present, so perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the formula for the heat transfer coefficient in a pipe with a different velocity, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flow rate is given as m³/h, not m³/s. Let me try that.

If Q is 2.5e-4 m³/s, that's 0.9 m³/h. If it were 2.5e-4 m³/h, that would be 6.94e-8 m³/s, which would make velocity extremely low, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the heat transfer coefficient in terms of the flow rate and the pipe's cross-sectional area, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = (v * λ) / (D_in / 2), which would be h= (1.692 * 0.639)/(0.006858)≈1.078/0.006858≈157.3 W/m²-K. Still not matching.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that I made a mistake in my approach, but I can't figure it out. Given the options, I'll have to choose the closest one, but none of them are close to my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D:10,060, but I can't see how to reach it.

The problem involves calculating the heat transfer coefficient \( h \) for water flowing through a ½ inch schedule 80 pipe. The given data includes a volumetric flow rate of \( Q = 2.5 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} \), water temperature of \( 350 \, \text{K} \), and pipe specifications. The goal is to determine \( h \) using the Dittus-Boelter equation, which relates the Nusselt number \( \text{Nu} \) to the Reynolds number \( \text{Re} \) and Prandtl number \( \text{Pr} \).

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Pipe Dimensions**:  
   The inner diameter of a ½ inch schedule 80 pipe is \( D_{\text{in}} = 0.540 \, \text{inches} = 0.013716 \, \text{m} \). The radius is \( r = 0.006858 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Cross-Sectional Area**:  
   Using the inner diameter, the cross-sectional area is \( A = \pi r^2 \approx 1.477 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 \).

3. **Velocity Calculation**:  
   The velocity \( v \) is calculated as \( v = \frac{Q}{A} \approx 1.692 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. **Reynolds Number (\( \text{Re} \))**:  
   The kinematic viscosity \( \nu \) of water at \( 350 \, \text{K} \) is \( 0.650 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s} \).  
   \[
   \text{Re} = \frac{v D_{\text{in}}}{\nu} \approx \frac{1.692 \times 0.013716}{0.650 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 35,646
   \]

5. **Prandtl Number (\( \text{Pr} \))**:  
   The Prandtl number for water at \( 350 \, \text{K} \) is \( \text{Pr} \approx 6.11 \).

6. **Nusselt Number (\( \text{Nu} \))**:  
   Using the Dittus-Boelter equation:  
   \[
   \text{Nu} = 0.023 \cdot \text{Re}^{0.8} \cdot \text{Pr}^{0.3}
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \text{Re}^{0.8} \approx 4378, \quad \text{Pr}^{0.3} \approx 1.72
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Nu} \approx 0.023 \cdot 4378 \cdot 1.72 \approx 173.5
   \]

7. **Heat Transfer Coefficient (\( h \))**:  
   The thermal conductivity \( \lambda \) of water at \( 350 \, \text{K} \) is \( 0.639 \, \text{W/m-K} \).  
   \[
   h = \text{Nu} \cdot \lambda \approx 173.5 \cdot 0.639 \approx 110.5 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{-K}
   \]

8. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated \( h \) is approximately \( 110.5 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{-K} \), which does not match any of the provided options (all in the range of \( 9,000 \) to \( 10,500 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{-K} \)). This suggests a potential error in the approach or missing information in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch and the lack of clarity in the approach, the most reasonable choice based on the provided options is **D: 10,060 W/m²-K**, though the calculation does not directly support this value.

**Answer: D**
