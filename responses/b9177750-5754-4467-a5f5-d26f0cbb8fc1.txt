Okay, so I've got this question about the maximum effective aperture of a short dipole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that a dipole antenna has certain radiation characteristics. The question mentions a short dipole, so I think that refers to a dipole where the length is much shorter than the wavelength. Short dipoles are often used in specific applications because their radiation patterns are somewhat omnidirectional, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the effective aperture.

The given radiation resistance is R_r = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) * (β²)/(6π) ohms. Wait, β is the phase constant, right? I think β is equal to 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength. Oh, but wait, in some contexts, β is written as k, which is 2π/λ. So, maybe β here is the same as k. Let me confirm: yes, β is the phase propagation constant, so β = 2π/λ.

So, substituting β into the equation for R_r, we get R_r = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) * ( (2π/λ)^2 ) / (6π ). Let me compute that step by step.

First, (β)^2 is (2π/λ)^2, which is 4π²/λ². Then, dividing that by 6π gives (4π²)/(6π λ²) )= (4π)/(6 λ² )= (2π)/(3 λ² ). So R_r simplifies to sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) multiplied by that.

Wait, but sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) is the intrinsic impedance of free space, which I remember is approximately 377 ohms. Let me write that down: η₀ = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) ≈ 377 Ω.

So R_r = η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ²) ). Wait, but wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me double-check the expression. The given R_r is sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) multiplied by (β²)/(6π). So substituting β=2π/λ, we have:

R_r = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) * ( (2π/λ)^2 ) / (6π )

Let me compute that numerator: (2π/λ)^2 = 4π²/λ². Divided by 6π gives (4π²)/(6π λ²) )= (4π)/(6 λ²) )= (2π)/(3 λ² ). So R_r = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) * (2π)/(3 λ² )

Wait, but sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) is η₀, so R_r = η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ² )

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think about units. Radiation resistance should have units of ohms. η₀ is in ohms, and 1/λ² is per square wavelength, so the units would indeed be ohms. So that seems correct.

Now, the question is about finding the maximum effective aperture (A_eff). I remember that the effective aperture is related to the radiation resistance and the input impedance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh wait, the effective aperture is given by A_eff = (λ²) / (4π) * (R_r) / (η₀) )? Or wait, maybe it's A_eff = (λ²)/(4π) * (R_r / η₀) )? No, wait, I think the formula is A_eff = (λ²) / (4π) * (R_r / η₀) ) , but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I think it's A_eff = (λ²) / (4π) * (R_r / η₀) ) multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach: The effective aperture of an antenna is related to its radiation resistance and the input impedance. For a dipole antenna, the effective aperture (A_eff) can be found using the formula A_eff = (λ²)/(4π) * (R_r / η₀) ). Let me see if that makes sense. So, substituting R_r from earlier:

R_r = η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ² )

So, R_r / η₀ = (2π)/(3 λ² )

Then A_eff = (λ²)/(4π) * (2π)/(3 λ² ) )

Simplify that: The λ² cancels out in numerator and denominator, so we have (1)/(4π) * (2π)/3 ) = (2π)/(12π) )= 2/(12) )= 1/6.

Wait, that would give A_eff = (1/6) λ². But looking at the options, none of them have 0.1667 λ². Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for A_eff.

Wait, another thought: The effective aperture for a dipole is often given as A_eff = (λ²)/(2π) * (R_r / η₀) ). Let me try that. So,

A_eff = (λ²)/(2π) * (R_r / η₀ )

But R_r is η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ² )

So R_r / η₀ = (2π)/(3 λ² )

Putting that into A_eff:

A_eff = (λ²)/(2π) * (2π)/(3 λ² ) ) = (λ² * 2π ) / (2π * 3 λ² ) ) = (1)/(3). So A_eff = (1/3) λ² ≈ 0.333 λ².

But looking at the options, option H is 0.319 λ², which is close but not exactly 1/3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the standard formula for a dipole's effective aperture. For a half-wave dipole, the effective aperture is (λ²)/(2π), but wait, wait. No, that's for a lossless half-wave dipole. But this is a short dipole, which is different.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of radiation resistance and the relation to effective area. The radiation resistance R_r is given, and the effective aperture A_eff is related to R_r by A_eff = (λ²)/(4π) * (R_r / η₀) ).

Wait, let me check a textbook formula. I think the effective aperture (or effective area) A_eff is given by:

A_eff = (λ^2) / (4π) * (R_r / η₀ )

So substituting R_r as given:

R_r = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) * (β²)/(6π) = η₀ * (β²)/(6π )

So R_r / η₀ = (β²)/(6π )

Now, substituting β = 2π/λ,

(R_r / η₀ ) = ( (2π/λ)^2 ) / (6π ) = (4π²)/(λ² * 6π ) )= (4π)/(6 λ² ) )= (2π)/(3 λ² )

So A_eff = (λ²)/(4π) * (2π)/(3 λ² ) )= (λ² * 2π ) / (4π * 3 λ² ) )

Simplify: λ² cancels, π cancels, so (2)/(12) )= 1/6.

So A_eff = 1/6 λ² ≈ 0.1667 λ².

Looking at the options, option E is 0.169 λ², which is very close. Hmm, but wait, that would make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: The radiation resistance R_r for a short dipole is given by R_r = (2π² a²)/(λ²) * η₀, where 'a' is the length of the dipole. Wait, but the question gives R_r in terms of β, so perhaps I should stick with the given expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for effective aperture is A_eff = (R_r * λ²) / (4π η₀ ). Let me compute that.

From earlier, R_r = η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ² )

So,

A_eff = (R_r * λ²) / (4π η₀ ) ) = [ η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ² ) * λ² ] / (4π η₀ )

Simplify: η₀ cancels, λ² cancels, so numerator is η₀ * 2π /3, denominator is 4π η₀.

So,

A_eff = (2π)/(3) / (4π ) )= (2π )/(3 *4π ) )= 2/(12) )= 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

So 0.1667 λ², which is approximately 0.167 λ². Looking at the options, option E is 0.169 λ², which is the closest.

But wait, another thought: Maybe I should consider that the maximum effective aperture is when the dipole is at its resonant condition, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me recheck.

Given R_r = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) * (β²)/(6π )

Since sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) is η₀ = 377 Ω,

R_r = η₀ * (β²)/(6π )

But β = 2π/λ,

So,

R_r = η₀ * ( (2π/λ)^2 )/(6π )

= η₀ * (4π²)/(λ² * 6π )

= η₀ * (4π)/(6 λ² )

= η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ² )

So R_r = η₀ * (2π)/(3 λ² )

Now, the effective aperture A_eff is given by:

A_eff = (λ²) / (4π) * (R_r / η₀ )

Substituting R_r,

A_eff = (λ²/(4π)) * [ (η₀ * 2π)/(3 λ² ) ) / η₀ ]

The η₀ cancels,

= (λ²/(4π)) * (2π)/(3 λ² )

Simplify: λ² cancels,

= (1/(4π)) * (2π/3 )

= (2π)/(12 π )

= 2/12 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

So 0.1667 λ², which is approximately 0.167 λ².

Looking at the options, option E is 0.169 λ². That's very close. So I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

The radiation resistance \( R_r \) of a short dipole is given as \( R_r = \sqrt{\mu_0 / \epsilon_0} \cdot (\beta^2) / (6\pi) \), where \( \beta = 2\pi / \lambda \). Substituting \( \beta \), we find \( R_r = \eta_0 \cdot (2\pi) / (3\lambda^2) \), where \( \eta_0 = \sqrt{\mu_0 / \epsilon_0} \) is the intrinsic impedance of free space. The effective aperture \( A_{\text{eff}} \) is related to \( R_r \) by \( A_{\text{eff}} = (\lambda^2) / (4\pi) \cdot (R_r / \eta_0) \). Substituting \( R_r \), we calculate \( A_{\text{eff}} = 0.1667 \lambda^2 \). Among the options, the closest value is \( 0.169 \lambda^2 \).
