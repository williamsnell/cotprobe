Okay, so Mr. Hendricks took a $5,000 mortgage from the bank, right? The interest rate is 5% per year, and he's supposed to pay it in semiannual installments over twenty years. The question is asking how much interest is due every six months.

Hmm, let me think. Since it's a fixed mortgage with semiannual payments, the interest is probably calculated on the remaining principal each period. Wait, but the question is just about the interest due each six months, not the payment amount. Or maybe it is? Wait, no, the question says "how much interest is due every six months." So perhaps it's just the interest portion each period without considering the principal reduction.

Wait, but in a fixed mortgage, usually each payment covers both principal and interest. So the interest part would decrease over time as the principal is paid down. But wait, the question might be simplifying things. Maybe they're just asking for the interest for the first period, without considering the amortization. Because if it's fixed, the installments are fixed, but the interest portion would change each time.

Wait, no, the term "fixed mortgage" here probably refers to a fixed interest rate, not the payment. So the interest rate is fixed at 5% per annum. Since the payments are semiannual, each period is six months. So the interest for each six-month period would be 5% divided by 2, which is 2.5% per period.

So 2.5% of $5,000 is 0.025 * 5000 = $125. So the interest due every six months would be $125. Looking at the options, option I is $125. But wait, wait a secondâ€”am I missing something? Because in reality, with amortizing loans, each payment includes both principal and interest, and the interest portion decreases each period. But the question here seems to be asking for the interest due each period, which might actually be the simple interest calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total interest over the life, but no, it's every six months. So maybe the first interest payment is $125, but then each subsequent period's interest is calculated on the reduced principal. But the question is about how much interest is due every six months, implying each payment's interest component, not the total.

Wait, but the problem says "fixed mortgage, agreeing to pay 5% interest yearly, in semiannual installments." So perhaps the interest is simple interest, and each six-month period's interest is 2.5% of the principal. So $5,000 * 2.5% = $125. So the interest due each six months is $125. That would make the answer I: $125.

But wait, let me double-check. If it's a fixed-rate mortgage with semiannual payments, the payments are fixed, but the interest portion changes. But the question is only asking for the interest due each six months, which might just be the portion of the interest for that period. So yes, 5% annually divided by two is 2.5% per period, which is $125. So I think the answer is I: $125.

The interest due every six months is calculated by taking the annual interest rate of 5% and dividing it by two, resulting in 2.5% per period. Applying this to the principal amount of $5,000 gives 0.025 * 5000 = $125.
