Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Word2Vec and neural networks. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false, then select the correct option from A to D.

Statement 1: "Word2Vec parameters were not initialized using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine." Hmm. I remember that Word2Vec is a model used to learn word embeddings, right? The way it's trained is usually through two layers: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. I think the parameters here refer to the weights between these layers.

Now, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. They are often used for initializing the weights in models because they can capture the distribution of the input data. Wait, does Word2Vec use RBMs for initialization? I'm not too sure. I think Word2Vec typically uses either a uniform distribution or some other method to initialize the weights, not RBMs. Or maybe it's the other way aroundâ€”like in some models, RBMs are used to pre-train weights before fine-tuning with another method. But I don't recall Word2Vec specifically using RBMs for initialization. So maybe Statement 1 is true because Word2Vec doesn't use RBMs to initialize its parameters.

Statement 2: "The tanh function is a nonlinear activation function." Oh yeah, I definitely remember activation functions. The tanh function, or hyperbolic tangent, is a common activation function. It's S-shaped and outputs values between -1 and 1. Importantly, it's nonlinear, which is crucial for neural networks to learn complex patterns. So yes, Statement 2 is definitely true.

Wait, but let me make sure about the first statement. I think in some implementations, like in skip-gram or CBOW models, the initial weights might be set randomly, maybe using a uniform distribution or something else, but not RBMs. RBMs are used more in other contexts, like in deep belief networks or for pre-training. So I'm pretty confident Statement 1 is true.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true. That would make the answer D: True, True.

The first statement is true because Word2Vec does not use Restricted Boltzmann Machines for initializing its parameters. The second statement is true as the tanh function is a nonlinear activation function. 

Answer: D
