Okay, so I've got this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking: When a claim is supported only by asserting that unidentified experts accept the claim, which fallacy has the arguer committed?

The options are A through J, and I need to choose the right one.

First, I should recall what each of these fallacies means. Let me list them out as I remember:

A: Snob appeal - This is when someone appeals to the prejudices of a particular class or group, often implying that a certain behavior is acceptable because a high-status person does it.

B: Appeal to popularity - This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something is true because many people believe it. It's the idea that if many people agree, it must be correct.

C: Post hoc ergo propter hoc - This is the fallacy of assuming that because one event followed another, the first caused the second.

D: Appeal to anonymous authority - This happens when the arguer cites an authority who isn't identified, or whose expertise isn't clear, to support a claim.

E: Straw man - This is when an arguer misrepresents an opponent's position to make it easier to attack.

F: Ad vericundiam - I think this is Latin for "appeal to reverence" or "appeal to authority." It's when someone appeals to the authority of a person or group to support their argument. But wait, isn't this similar to other options?

G: False dichotomy - This is when an argument presents only two options when more possibilities exist, forcing the listener to choose between them.

H: Slippery slope - This is the argument that a small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of events with negative consequences, without providing evidence for that chain.

I: Ad hominem - This is attacking the person instead of the argument, often by suggesting that their character or circumstances make their argument invalid.

J: Appeal to tradition - This fallacy argues that something is correct or acceptable simply because it's traditional.

Now, the question says the arguer supports their claim by asserting that unidentified experts accept it. So they're citing experts, but the experts aren't identified. That makes me think of "appeal to anonymous authority."

Wait, but option F is "ad vericundiam," which is about appealing to authority in general. So if the experts are unidentified, it's a specific form of ad vericundiam. Or is it a different fallacy?

I think I remember that "appeal to anonymous authority" is a specific type of ad vericundiam. Because ad vericundiam can be any appeal to authority, whether identified or not. So if the authority isn't identified, then the fallacy is more specifically "appeal to anonymous authority."

Looking back at the options, D is "appeal to anonymous authority." So the arguer is committing fallacy D.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about when the experts are unidentified. So the arguer is appealing to the authority of experts, but since they're not named or identified, it's D. If they were named experts, it might be ad vericundiam, but since they're anonymous, it's D.

So the answer should be D: appeal to anonymous authority.

The arguer cites unidentified experts, which falls under the fallacy of appeal to anonymous authority.

Answer: D
