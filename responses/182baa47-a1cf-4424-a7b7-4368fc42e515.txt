Okay, I need to figure out which statements about gonorrhea are true. Let's go through each option one by one.

A: always causes severe pain and discomfort. I remember that gonorrhea can sometimes have symptoms, but sometimes people don't notice them or they're mild. So maybe this isn't always the case. So A might not be correct.

B: can be treated with antibiotics. Yes, I'm pretty sure gonorrhea is caused by bacteria, so antibiotics should work. This sounds true.

C: can be completely prevented with the use of condoms. Condoms reduce the risk, but they aren't 100% effective because they don't cover all areas. Plus, there's the risk of breakage. So C probably isn't correct.

D: only affects men. No, women can get it too. It's a common STI for both sexes. So D is wrong.

E: infections are limited to genital areas. I think gonorrhea can also affect the throat or eyes if the bacteria are spread that way, especially during oral sex. So E isn't true.

F: is a viral infection. No, it's bacterial, specifically Neisseria gonorrhoeae. So F is false.

G: is a form of herpes. Herpes is a different family of viruses, so G is incorrect.

H: is asymptomatic in only a small percentage of those infected. Wait, I think most people with gonorrhea don't show symptoms, especially women. So H might be the opposite; maybe it's asymptomatic in a larger percentage. So H is probably false.

I: can be cured with over-the-counter medication. I don't think you can get antibiotics OTC easily, and even if you could, it's important to get a proper diagnosis. So I is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B: can be treated with antibiotics.
