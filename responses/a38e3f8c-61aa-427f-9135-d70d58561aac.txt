Okay, so I've got this question about how many ways there are to arrange 6 pairs of parentheses such that they're balanced. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with Catalan numbers, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think it through.

First, I know that balanced parentheses are a classic combinatorial problem. The number of ways to correctly match n pairs of parentheses is given by the nth Catalan number. Catalan numbers... yeah, they come up in a lot of problems like this, including things like tree structures and valid expressions.

So, the formula for the nth Catalan number is C_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). Right? So for 6 pairs, that would be C_6. Let me calculate that.

Wait, what's the 6th Catalan number? I think I remember that C_0 is 1, C_1 is 1, C_2 is 2, C_3 is 5, C_4 is 14, C_5 is 42, and C_6 is 132. Oh, wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check the sequence.

Catalan numbers go like this: 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, etc. So yeah, C_0=1, C_1=1, C_2=2, C_3=5, C_4=14, C_5=42, C_6=132. So for 6 pairs, it's 132. Looking at the options, D is 132. So that's the answer?

But wait, let me go through the formula to make sure I didn't just remember it wrong. The formula is C_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). So for n=6, that's (1/7) * (12 choose 6).

Calculating (12 choose 6): 12! / (6! * 6!) = (12×11×10×9×8×7)/(6×5×4×3×2×1) = let's see.

12×11=132, ×10=1320, ×9=11880, ×8=95040, ×7=665,280. Then denominator is 720 (6! = 720).

So 665,280 / 720 = let's see. Divide 665280 by 720. 720 × 900 is 648,000, which leaves 17,280. 720 ×24=17,280. So total is 900+24=924. So (12 choose 6)=924.

Then C_6 = (1/7)*924 = 132. Yep, that checks out. So the answer is D:132.
