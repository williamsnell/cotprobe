Okay, so I have this question about unilateral brain damage, specifically to the left hemisphere. I need to figure out which of the options is least likely to result in an inability. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the left hemisphere is typically the dominant one for language and logical functions in most people, especially if they're right-handed. So damage there would likely affect those areas. But let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Use process of elimination for multiple-choice questions. Hmm, process of elimination is a logical thinking task. If the left hemisphere is damaged, which is the dominant one, maybe this would be affected. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's more about reasoning, which could be impaired.

Option B: Interpret visual cues. Visual interpretation can be done by both hemispheres, but the left might handle more analytical aspects. However, people with left damage might have some visual issues, like neglecting the left side in their visual field. But I'm not certain if this is the least likely.

Option C: Read a map. Maps require spatial reasoning, which is often handled by the right hemisphere. Wait, if the left hemisphere is damaged, would that affect reading a map? Or is it the right that's more spatial? So maybe this is less affected, making it the least likely inability.

Option D: Perform mathematical calculations. Math is usually a left hemisphere function, so damage here would likely impair this ability. So this would be something they can't do, so it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option E: Write a coherent sentence. Writing is definitely a left hemisphere task, so damage here would cause issues. So E is something they can't do, so it's not the answer.

Option F: Perform physical tasks with the right side of the body. The right side is controlled by the left hemisphere. So if the left hemisphere is damaged, the right side's motor functions would be affected. So F is something they can't do, making it not the answer.

Option G: Memorize vocabulary words. Vocabulary is a language function, so left damage would affect this. So G is something they can't do, not the answer.

Option H: Construct a daily schedule. Scheduling is a planning and organizational task, which the left hemisphere handles. So H would be affected, making it not the answer.

Option I: Understand spoken language. Again, left hemisphere is key for language processing, so I is something they can't do, making it not the answer.

Wait, so the question is asking which is least likely to result in an inability. So the correct answer is the one that's least affected.

From the options, options C (reading a map) and B (interpreting visual cues) are more related to the right hemisphere. But wait, the right hemisphere is more about spatial and visual processing. So if the left is damaged, the right might still function, so the person might still be able to interpret visual cues and read a map.

But wait, the question is about the left hemisphere being dominant. So if the left is damaged, the right hemisphere might take over some functions, but for specialized tasks like reading a map, which is more spatial, it's less likely to be impaired. So the least likely inability would be reading a map (option C) or interpreting visual cues (option B).

Wait, but the question is about the least likely inability. So which of these is least likely to be affected by left hemisphere damage?

Alternatively, maybe the right hemisphere handles some aspects. So if the left is damaged, the right can still handle some visual tasks. So the person might still be able to interpret visual cues and read a map, making those the least likely to result in inability.

Looking back, the options are:

A: process elimination (left-damaged, so maybe can't do it)
B: interpret visual cues (right handles, so can do)
C: read a map (right handles, so can do)
D: math (left, can't)
E: write (left, can't)
F: right physical tasks (left controls, can't)
G: memorize vocab (left, can't)
H: schedule (left, can't)
I: understand spoken (left, can't)

So the least likely are B and C. Which one is more about the right hemisphere? Reading a map is definitely spatial, more right hemisphere. So the person can still do that. So the answer is C.

Wait, but the options are A to I. The question is asking which is least likely to result in inability. So the correct answer is C: read a map.

The left hemisphere is typically dominant for language, logic, and analytical tasks. Damage to it would impair functions like writing, speaking, and mathematical calculations. However, tasks related to spatial reasoning, such as reading a map, are primarily handled by the right hemisphere. Therefore, unilateral damage to the left hemisphere is least likely to result in an inability to read a map.

Answer: C

The least likely inability is reading a map, as it relies more on the right hemisphere. 

Answer: C
