Question:

A newborn infant is examined by a doctor, who determines that the child has syphilis. Explain how the child con-tracted syphilis .

Options:

A: The baby contracted it from a contaminated surface.
B: The baby acquired the infection through kissing or close contact with an infected person.
C: The infant contracted the disease from another infant.
D: The child inherited the disease as an autosomal recessive trait from the parents.
E: The child contracted the disease from a blood transfusion shortly after birth.
F: The infant was vaccinated with a contaminated needle.
G: An infected mother can transmit the organism by placental transfer to the fetus during the first four months of pregnancy or as the fetus passes through the infected vagina during birth.
H: The infant developed the disease due to exposure to the bacterium in the hospital environment after birth.
I: The baby contracted it through breastfeeding from an infected mother.
J: The baby was born with it due to a genetic mutation.

Answer:

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how a newborn infant contracted syphilis. The question is asking me to explain how the child got it. Let's go through the options one by one.

First, I know syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It's typically spread through direct contact with sores during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. But since this is about a newborn, I have to think about transmission during birth or from the mother.

Option A says the baby got it from a contaminated surface. I don't think that's right because syphilis isn't usually spread that way. It's more about direct contact with the bacteria.

Option B mentions kissing or close contact. Well, kissing can spread syphilis if there are sores in the mouth, but in the case of a newborn, the mother would be the primary source, not another person. So maybe, but I'm not sure if this is the main route for newborns.

Option C says another infant. That seems unlikely because syphilis isn't typically spread between infants unless there's direct contact, which in a hospital setting is possible but not the primary way for a newborn to contract it.

Option D talks about an autosomal recessive trait. Syphilis isn't a genetic disease, so this can't be right.

Option E is from a blood transfusion after birth. Blood transfusions can transmit infections, but syphilis is rare in blood products because they're screened. Plus, the newborn would have received blood after birth, but the question is about how the child got it, and the mother is the primary source.

Option F is a contaminated needle during vaccination. That's a possibility for transmission, but again, the primary way for a newborn is from the mother, not a vaccination.

Option G says the mother can transmit it via placental transfer during the first four months or during birth. This sounds familiar because I remember that syphilis can cross the placenta, especially in the first trimester, and also during delivery when passing through the infected birth canal. So this seems correct.

Option H suggests exposure in the hospital after birth. While hospitals can have bacteria, syphilis in a newborn is more likely to be from the mother, not the environment after birth.

Option I is through breastfeeding from an infected mother. Syphilis can be transmitted through breast milk, but I think it's less common than transmission during pregnancy or delivery. However, it's still a possible route.

Option J is a genetic mutation. No, syphilis isn't caused by a mutation; it's an infection.

So, the main ways a newborn gets syphilis are from the mother during pregnancy (placental transfer) or during birth (vaginal delivery through an infected area). Option G directly addresses both these methods, making it the correct answer. Option I is possible but not as direct as G. Options B and H are less likely because they don't involve the mother's transmission directly.

The correct answer is G: An infected mother can transmit the organism by placental transfer to the fetus during the first four months of pregnancy or as the fetus passes through the infected vagina during birth.

Answer: G
