Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangle's area and estimating the maximum error using differentials. Hmm, let's see. The rectangle has a length of 30 cm and a width of 24 cm. The measurements have an error of at most 0.1 cm in each. I need to find the maximum error in the calculated area.

First, I remember that the area of a rectangle is given by multiplying its length and width, so A = l * w. Here, l is 30 cm and w is 24 cm. Without any errors, the area would be 30 * 24, which is 720 cm². But since there's an error in each measurement, I need to find how that affects the area.

I think using differentials is the way to go here. Differentials are used for approximating small changes in a function based on small changes in its variables. So, the differential of the area, dA, would give me the approximate change in area due to small changes in length (dl) and width (dw).

The formula for differentials in this case should be dA = (∂A/∂l) * dl + (∂A/∂w) * dw. Let's compute the partial derivatives.

The partial derivative of A with respect to l is ∂A/∂l = w, since A = l * w. Similarly, the partial derivative of A with respect to w is ∂A/∂w = l.

So plugging in the values, ∂A/∂l = 24 cm and ∂A/∂w = 30 cm.

The maximum error in each measurement is 0.1 cm, so dl = 0.1 cm and dw = 0.1 cm.

Now, putting it all into the differential formula:
dA = (24)(0.1) + (30)(0.1) = 2.4 + 3.0 = 5.4 cm².

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the maximum error in the area is approximately 5.4 cm². Looking at the options, option B is 5.4 cm². So that should be the answer.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The differentials method gives the maximum possible error when both length and width have their maximum errors. So yeah, the answer must be B.

The area of a rectangle is calculated as \( A = l \times w \). Given \( l = 30 \, \text{cm} \) and \( w = 24 \, \text{cm} \), the area is \( 720 \, \text{cm}^2 \). Using differentials to estimate the maximum error, we have \( dA = \left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial l} \right) dl + \left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial w} \right) dw \). The partial derivatives are \( \frac{\partial A}{\partial l} = 24 \) and \( \frac{\partial A}{\partial w} = 30 \). With \( dl = dw = 0.1 \, \text{cm} \), the maximum error is \( dA = (24)(0.1) + (30)(0.1) = 5.4 \, \text{cm}^2 \). 

The answer is B.
