Okay, so I've got this question here about converting a concentration from parts per million (ppm) to milligram percent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the maximum safe concentration of fluoride ion in drinking water is 2.0 ppm. I need to express this in milligram percent. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I should remember what ppm means. Parts per million is a unit of concentration. It can be expressed in different ways, like ppm by mass, volume, or other measures, but I think in this context, it's mass per volume, maybe mg per liter or something similar.

Wait, ppm can sometimes be confusing because it can be expressed as mg/kg, mg/L, etc. But in water, I think ppm is often considered as mg/L because water is a liquid, and mass and volume are more directly related.

So, 1 ppm would be 1 mg per liter of water. Because 1 liter of water weighs about 1 kg, so ppm by mass is the same as mg per liter. So 2.0 ppm would be 2.0 mg per liter.

But the question asks for milligram percent. Milligram percent, mg%, is a way of expressing concentration where the percent is based on mass. So mg% would be the mass of the solute in milligrams per 100 grams of solution, I think. Or wait, is it per 100 grams of solvent or solution? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, let me clarify. Percent concentration can be a bit tricky. There are different types: weight/volume (%), volume/volume, weight/weight, etc. But mg% would typically be weight/weight, meaning milligrams of solute per 100 grams of solution. Or wait, sometimes it's per 100 grams of solvent? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think in terms of ppm and mg%.

Wait, ppm can be ppm by mass. So if ppm is by mass, then 1 ppm is 1 mg per 1 kg. Because 1 kg is 1,000,000 mg, so 1 ppm would be 1 mg in 1,000,000 mg. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 ppm is 1 part per million, so if the solution is, say, 1 kg, then 1 ppm would be 1 mg in 1 kg, because 1 kg is 1,000,000 grams, and 1 ppm would be 1 gram in a million grams, which is 1 mg in 1 kg. So yeah, 1 ppm by mass is 1 mg/kg, or 1 mg per 1,000 grams.

Wait, but the question is about converting ppm to mg%. So, what's mg%? Let me think. If mg% is milligrams per 100 grams of solution, then we can calculate that.

So, if the concentration is 2.0 ppm by mass, that means there are 2.0 milligrams of fluoride in 1,000,000 mg of solution. Wait, no, wait, 1 ppm is 1 mg per 1,000,000 mg. So 2.0 ppm is 2.0 mg per 1,000,000 mg of solution.

But I need to express this as mg%. So mg% is mg per 100 grams. Wait, 1,000,000 mg is 1000 grams, right? Because 1000 mg = 1 gram. So 1,000,000 mg is 1000 grams, which is 1 kg. So 2.0 mg per 1000 grams.

So, per 1000 grams, it's 2 mg. So per 100 grams, it would be (2 mg / 1000 grams) * 100 grams. That would be 0.2 mg per 100 grams, which is 0.2 mg%. Wait, so 2 mg per 1000 grams is the same as 0.2 mg per 100 grams, so 0.2 mg%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think in terms of ppm to mg%.

If ppm is parts per million, and mg% is mg per 100 grams, then since 1 ppm is 1 mg per 1,000,000 mg, which is 1 mg per 1000 grams (because 1,000,000 mg = 1000 grams). So 1 ppm = 1 mg / 1000 grams = 0.1 mg / 100 grams. So 1 ppm = 0.1 mg%.

Wait, that can't be right because 1 ppm would then be 0.1 mg%, but looking at the options, 0.002 mg% is option B, 0.02 is D, 0.2 is F, and 2 is A, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the conversion. Let me approach this differently.

Let me consider that ppm is mg per liter, and mg% is mg per 100 grams. But wait, 1 liter of water weighs approximately 1 kg, or 1000 grams. So if ppm is mg per liter, then 2 ppm is 2 mg per liter, which is 2 mg per 1000 grams. So that's 0.2 mg per 100 grams. So 0.2 mg% is 0.2 mg per 100g, which would match option F: .20 mg%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer might be option H: 2.0 mg%, but that doesn't align with this calculation. Wait, am I mixing up ppm by mass and ppm by volume?

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the definition of ppm. ppm can be expressed in different ways, but in water, when we talk about ppm, it's often ppm by mass, which is equivalent to mg per liter because 1 liter of water is about 1 kg, so 1 mg per liter is 1 ppm.

So 2.0 ppm would be 2 mg per liter, which is 2 mg per 1000 grams of water. So per 100 grams, that's 0.2 mg. So 0.2 mg per 100 grams is 0.2 mg%, which is 0.20 mg%, so option F.

Wait, but let me think again. If 2 ppm is 2 mg per liter, and 1 liter is 1000 grams, then 2 mg per 1000 grams is 0.2 mg per 100 grams. So yes, that's 0.2 mg%, which is option F.

But wait, another way: ppm is mg per kg, so 2 ppm is 2 mg/kg. Since 1 kg is 1000 grams, 2 mg/kg is the same as 0.2 mg per 100 grams, because 2 mg per 1000 grams is 0.2 mg per 100 grams. So that's 0.2 mg%.

So the correct answer should be F: .20 mg%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is ".20 mg %", which is 0.20 mg%. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about 2 mg per liter being 2 mg/kg, which is 0.2 mg% because 2 mg per kg is 0.2 mg per 100g. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer should be F: .20 mg%.

The maximum safe concentration of fluoride ion in drinking water is given as 2.0 ppm (parts per million). To convert this to milligram percent (mg%), we start by understanding that ppm by mass is equivalent to mg per kilogram of water. Since 1 liter of water weighs approximately 1 kg, 2.0 ppm corresponds to 2.0 mg per liter or 2.0 mg per 1000 grams of water.

To express this in mg%, we calculate the concentration per 100 grams of water. Since 2.0 mg is present in 1000 grams, dividing by 10 gives 0.2 mg per 100 grams. Therefore, the concentration is 0.2 mg%, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
