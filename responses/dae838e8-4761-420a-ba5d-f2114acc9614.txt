Question:

Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?

B: 1/64
C: 1/8
D: 15/64
E: 7/64
F: 3/8
G: 25/64
H: 9/64
I: 1/2
J: 1/16

Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure out the chance that at least one of the variables X or Y is greater than 3. Both X and Y are independent and have the same probability distribution where the probability that X equals n is 1/(2^n) for each positive integer n. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving "at least one," it's often easier to calculate the complement probability and then subtract it from 1. The complement of "at least one of X or Y is greater than 3" is "both X and Y are less than or equal to 3." So, I'll start by finding the probability that a single variable (say X) is ≤3, then use that to find the probability for both X and Y, since they're independent.

Let me calculate P(X ≤3). That's the sum of probabilities from n=1 to n=3. So,

P(X=1) = 1/2^1 = 1/2
P(X=2) = 1/2^2 = 1/4
P(X=3) = 1/2^3 = 1/8

Adding these up: 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = (4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8) = 7/8. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 1/2 is 4/8, plus 2/8 is 6/8, plus 1/8 is 7/8. So P(X ≤3) is 7/8? That can't be right because 1/2 +1/4 is 3/4 (6/8), plus 1/8 is 7/8. Hmm, but wait, the sum of the probabilities for n=1 to infinity should be 1, right? Let me check that. Sum from n=1 to ∞ of 1/2^n is a geometric series with first term 1/2 and ratio 1/2, so sum is (1/2)/(1 - 1/2) )= 1. So that's correct.

Wait, but if P(X ≤3) is 7/8, then the probability that X >3 is 1 - 7/8 = 1/8. Similarly for Y, same thing.

But wait, the problem is asking for P(X >3 or Y >3). Since X and Y are independent, the probability that both are ≤3 is P(X ≤3) * P(Y ≤3) = (7/8) * (7/8) = 49/64.

So the probability that at least one is greater than 3 is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 49/64 = (64/64 -49/64) = 15/64.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, the complement is both X and Y ≤3. So yes, (7/8)^2 = 49/64. Then 1 - 49/64 is 15/64. So the answer should be D:15/64.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recalculate P(X ≤3):

P(X=1) = 1/2
P(X=2) = 1/4
P(X=3) = 1/8

Sum: 1/2 + 1/4 is 3/4, plus 1/8 is 7/8. So yes, that's correct. Then, for two variables, since they're independent, multiply the probabilities: (7/8) * (7/8) = 49/64. So 1 - 49/64 is indeed 15/64. So the correct answer is D.

The probability that at least one of X or Y is greater than 3 is 15/64.
