D: MFC = MC, MVC increases with each additional unit produced
E: MFC = MC, MVC = 0
F: MFC increases as output increases, MVC = MC

Okay, so I've got this economics question about marginal costs, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking about the differences between Marginal Fixed Cost (MFC), Marginal Variable Cost (MVC), and Marginal Total Cost (MC). The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in economics, costs are divided into fixed and variable. Fixed costs are those that don't change with the level of output, like rent or salaries. Variable costs change as output changes, like materials or labor. So, marginal costs are the additional costs incurred by producing one more unit.

Marginal Fixed Cost (MFC) would be the additional fixed cost from producing one more unit. But wait, fixed costs don't change with output, right? So, if you increase production, fixed costs stay the same. That means the marginal fixed cost for each additional unit should be zero because you're not adding any new fixed costs when you produce more. So MFC is zero.

Then there's Marginal Variable Cost (MVC), which is the additional variable cost from producing one more unit. Since variable costs do change with output, each additional unit adds some cost. So MFC is zero, and MVC is the actual cost added per unit.

Now, Marginal Total Cost (MC) is the total cost of producing one more unit. That would include both fixed and variable costs. But since MFC is zero, MC should just equal MVC. So MC = MFC + MVC, but since MFC is zero, MC = MVC.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says MFC=0, MVC=MC. That makes sense because if MFC is zero, then MC would be equal to MVC. So option A seems correct.

Option B says MFC decreases as output increases, which doesn't make sense because MFC is zero regardless of output. So B is wrong.

Option C says MFC=MVC and MC increases as output decreases. That doesn't seem right because MFC is zero, and MC should increase or behave differently based on variable costs, not necessarily when output decreases.

Option D says MFC=MC, which would mean MFC is not zero, which contradicts what I know. So D is wrong.

Option E says MFC=MC and MVC=0. That's the opposite of what we have, because MVC isn't zero; it's the variable cost part.

Option F says MFC increases with output and MVC=MC. I thought MFC is zero, so F is wrong.

Option G says all three are equal, which can't be right because MFC is zero, so unless MC and MVC are also zero, which isn't the case.

Option H says MFC=0, MVC increases with each additional unit, and MC equals MFC + MVC. Wait, so H is saying MC = 0 + increasing MVC. That would mean MC increases as output increases, which makes sense because each additional unit adds more variable cost. But the option says MC = MFC + MVC, which is correct because MC is the sum of both. However, looking at the first part, MFC=0, and MVC increasesâ€”so when you produce more, each additional unit's variable cost might change. Wait, but in economics, for marginal costs, the variable cost per unit might actually decrease if there are economies of scale, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the variable cost per unit is constant, then MVC is a flat number. But I think the key point is that MFC is zero, and MC equals MVC, so H's third part is correct, but does the option say that? H says MC = MFC + MVC, which is correct because MC is the sum. So H could also be a contender. Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought option A was correct because it says MFC=0 and MVC=MC. But let me think again.

Wait, in reality, MC is the total marginal cost, which is MFC + MVC. But since MFC is zero, MC=MVC. So option H says that MC = MFC + MVC, which is correct because MFC is zero, so it's the same as saying MC = MVC. So H seems correct too. Hmm, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: MFC=0, MVC=MC. So in this case, MFC is zero, and MVC equals MC. That's correct because MC is MFC + MVC, and MFC is zero. So A is correct.

Option H: MFC=0, MVC increases with each additional unit produced, and MC = MFC + MVC. So H is also correct in that MC is MFC + MVC. But does MVC increase with each additional unit? That depends on the cost structure. If variable costs per unit are constant, then MVC is the same for each additional unit. If variable costs per unit increase (which is unusual, but possible), then MVC would increase. More commonly, in the short run, variable costs per unit might decrease due to spreading fixed costs, but marginal variable cost could be constant or even decrease. Alternatively, in the long run, variable costs might have increasing or decreasing marginal costs. But I think in basic economics, we often assume that variable costs have constant marginal costs, so MVC is the same for each additional unit. Therefore, option H's statement that MVC increases with each additional unit might not be correct unless the cost curve is increasing.

Wait, but the question is about the definitions, not the behavior of the costs. So MFC is zero, and MC equals MVC. So the correct answer would be the option that states MFC=0 and MVC=MC, which is option A.

Wait, but in option H, the third part is correct because MC is the sum. So H's statement is accurate in that MC = MFC + MVC, but MFC is zero. So H's first part is correct, and the third part is correct. However, the second part says MVC increases with each additional unit. That might not always be the case; it depends on whether variable costs per unit increase, which isn't specified here. So I think the correct answer is A because it directly states that MFC is zero and MVC equals MC, without making any claims about how MVC changes with output.

Alternatively, perhaps option H is correct because it correctly defines how MC is composed. Let me think again. The question is about the differences between MFC, MVC, and MC. So MC is the sum of MFC and MVC. Since MFC is zero, MC equals MVC. So, looking at the options:

Option A: MFC=0, MVC=MC. So yes, that's correct.

Option H: MFC=0, MVC increases with each additional unit, and MC = MFC + MVC. So H is also correct in structure but adds an assumption about MVC increasing, which isn't necessarily always true.

Therefore, the correct answer is A because it correctly states the relationships between the marginal costs without making any assumptions about the behavior of MVC beyond the definitions.
</think>

The correct answer is **A**. Marginal Fixed Cost (MFC) is zero because fixed costs do not change with output. Marginal Variable Cost (MVC) is the additional cost of producing one more unit, and Marginal Total Cost (MC) is the sum of MFC and MVC. Since MFC is zero, MC equals MVC. Therefore, the correct option is:

**A: MFC = 0, MVC = MC**
