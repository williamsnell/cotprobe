Question:

What external strategies do elites employ?

Options:

A: Elites may also use economic strategies, such as the manipulation of currency or the imposition of sanctions, to maintain their power and control.
B: An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.
C: Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.
D: An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.

Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about external strategies employed by elites. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking, "What external strategies do elites employ?" And then it gives four options labeled A through D. I have to choose the correct one.

First, I should recall what I know about elites and their strategies. Elites are usually the powerful groups in society, often with influence over politics, economy, etc. When they employ external strategies, they might be looking to maintain their power or influence on a larger scale.

Looking at the options:

Option A says elites may manipulate currency or impose sanctions. That sounds plausible because economic strategies are common tools for influencing other countries or maintaining control. For example, currency manipulation can affect a country's economy, and sanctions can pressure governments.

Option B talks about weak states using private military companies. But the question is about elites, not necessarily weak states. Plus, it's about force multipliers, which might be more about military strategies than economic or control strategies.

Option C mentions weak states avoiding alliances because of conditions. Again, this seems more about weak states' foreign policies rather than strategies elites use. Also, the focus is on democratization and penalties, which might not directly tie into the main strategies elites use externally.

Option D is about expelling foreign workers and restricting borders. This seems related to internal control rather than external strategies. Restricting migrants and refugees is more of a domestic policy to manage internal threats, not so much an external strategy to influence other regions or maintain power globally.

So, focusing back on the question, the external strategies would likely involve actions that affect other countries or international relations. Option A suggests economic tools like currency manipulation and sanctions, which are external because they impact other nations' economies and policies. Elites can use these to pressure other countries or gain economic advantages, which fits as an external strategy.

Option B, while correct in itself, refers more to weak states using mercenaries, which doesn't directly answer what elites do externally. Options C and D are more about internal policies or reactions to internal threats rather than external strategies.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A.
