Question:

Mr. Johnson, who already has a $20,000 annual salary, has purchased land for $8,000 and a house on the land for $50,000. He expects to sell the property in ten years. For the first 3 years, Johnson expects rent income from the property to be $7,000 and expenses to be $2,700. For the next 7 years, revenue will be $10,000 and expenses, $3,500. Johnson will deduct a 2% depreciation allowance on the building from his taxable incomes. If Johnson sells this property after 10 years for $61,500, what percent of his $58,000 investment will he have gained or lost from the rental and sales incomes? The current interest rate is 7%. The tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary, are: Income Rate On the first $4,00033.44% = 0.3344 On the second $4,00037.84% = 0.3784 On the third $4,00041.36% = 0.4136 On the fourth $4,00044% = 0.44 On the fifth $4,00046.64% = 0.4664

Options:

A: 2.9%
B: 1.84%
C: -1.5%
D: 2.5%
E: 4.2%
F: 5.7%
G: -0.3%
H: 0.89%
I: 3.1%
J: -2.2%

Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage gain or loss Mr. Johnson has on his investment. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial investment. Mr. Johnson bought land for $8,000 and a house for $50,000, so the total investment is $8,000 + $50,000 = $58,000. He expects to sell the property after ten years for $61,500. So, the selling price is $61,500. But the question is about the gain or loss percentage relative to his investment of $58,000.

Wait, but I think I need to consider more factors because the options are percentages, which suggests that taxes and other incomes/expenses might affect the net gain or loss. So, I shouldn't just look at the selling price minus the initial cost. I also need to account for the rental income, expenses, depreciation, and taxes over the ten years.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the net rental income for each period, considering expenses.
2. Deduct depreciation from the taxable income.
3. Calculate the taxes on the rental income.
4. Sum up all the cash flows (rental income after taxes, expenses, depreciation, and the selling price).
5. Determine the total gain or loss by comparing the total cash flows to the initial investment.
6. Calculate the percentage gain or loss based on the initial investment.

Let me start by breaking down the rental periods.

First 3 years:
- Rent income: $7,000 per year
- Expenses: $2,700 per year
So, net rental income each year is $7,000 - $2,700 = $4,300 per year. Over 3 years, that's 3 * $4,300 = $12,900.

Next 7 years:
- Rent income: $10,000 per year
- Expenses: $3,500 per year
Net rental income each year is $10,000 - $3,500 = $6,500 per year. Over 7 years, that's 7 * $6,500 = $45,500.

Total net rental income over 10 years: $12,900 + $45,500 = $58,400.

But wait, there's also depreciation. He's allowed a 2% depreciation on the building each year. The building cost is $50,000, so depreciation per year is 2% of $50,000 = $1,000. So, each year for 10 years, he can deduct $1,000.

Depreciation total: 10 * $1,000 = $10,000.

Now, the taxable income from rentals. His salary is $20,000, so any income above that is taxable. But wait, the rental income is separate, right? So, the rental income is taxable, but his salary is not part of the equation here. Wait, the question says: "tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary." So, the $20,000 salary is not taxed; only the rental and sales income over that are taxed.

Wait, but the rental income is $58,400 over 10 years. Plus, when he sells the property, he'll have a selling price of $61,500. But the cost basis for depreciation is $50,000 for the building. The land is $8,000, but land doesn't depreciate. So, when he sells, the selling price minus the adjusted basis (original cost minus depreciation) would be the gain.

Wait, but I think I need to calculate the taxable income from the sale as well. Let me clarify.

First, let's calculate the taxes on the rental income. Each year's rental income (after expenses) is part of his taxable income. But wait, his salary is $20,000, and the rental income is additional. So, the rental income is taxed at the given rates.

So, the rental income per year for each period:

First 3 years: $4,300 net per year. So, each year's taxable rental income is $4,300, but since his salary is $20,000, he's taxed on the rental income as additional income.

Wait, but the tax rates are applied to the rental income above the salary. So, the rental income is taxed at the given rates, regardless of the salary. Wait, the problem says: "tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary." So, the rental income is taxed on the amount above $20,000? Or is the rental income taxed separately, with the $20,000 salary not affecting the rental income tax?

Wait, I think the rental income is taxed at the given rates on the amounts above the salary. So, if his salary is $20,000, and his rental income is, say, $4,300, then the taxable amount is $4,300, because it's above the salary. Wait, no, that can't be right because $4,300 is less than $20,000. Wait, no, the rental income is in addition to the salary, so the tax is applied to the rental income regardless of the salary. Wait, perhaps the $20,000 is his base, and any income above that is taxed, but the rental income is separate. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says: "tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary." So, the rental and sales income are taxed on the amounts that exceed $20,000. So, if his total income is salary plus rental plus sale, and anything above $20,000 is taxed.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. It says the tax rates are applied to the rental and sales income above the $20,000 salary. So, the rental income and the sale income are considered as separate from the salary, and each is taxed based on the amount above $20,000.

Wait, no, perhaps the rental and sales income are each taxed based on their own amounts, but the $20,000 is a threshold. So, for each, the first $20,000 is not taxed, and anything above is taxed at the given rates. But that seems a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the $20,000 is a personal exemption, and any rental and sales income is taxed as follows: the first $4,000 taxed at 33.44%, the next $4k at 37.84%, etc., but this seems to be a marginal tax rate structure.

Wait, the tax rates are applied to the rental and sales income above the $20k salary. So, for example, if his rental income for a year is $4,300, then since $4,300 is less than $20k, he doesn't pay any tax on it. Wait, that can't be right because the rental income is additional to the salary. So perhaps, the rental income is taxed on the amount that exceeds $20k, but that's not possible because rental income is additional. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the $20k is his salary, and any rental income and sales income are added to it. So, the total income is $20k + rental + sale. Then, the tax is applied to the total income, but the problem says the tax rates are applied to the rental and sales income above the salary. So, perhaps the tax is applied only to the rental and sales income, not the salary. So, the rental and sales income are taxed as per the given rates, regardless of the salary.

Wait, the problem says: "the tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary." So, the rental and sales income are taxed on their amounts above the $20k salary. So, if his rental income is, say, $4,300, then the taxable amount is $4,300, as it's above the salary. Wait, no, that can't be, because the salary is $20k, and the rental income is separate. So, perhaps the rental and sales income are taxed as follows: for each, the amount above $20k is taxed at the given rates. But that doesn't make sense because the rental income is likely less than $20k.

Wait, perhaps the $20k is the amount that is not taxed, and any income from rental and sales beyond that is taxed. So, if the rental and sales income together exceed $20k, the excess is taxed. But that seems a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the $20k is his salary, and any rental income and sales income are added to it, but only the amount above $20k is taxed. So, for example, if his rental income is $58,400 over 10 years and the sale is $61,500, then the total additional income is $58,400 + $61,500 = $119,900. Then, the tax is applied to this $119,900, but only the part above $20k is taxed. Wait, but that would mean the first $20k is tax-free, and the rest is taxed. But that would mean the taxable amount is $119,900 - $20,000 = $99,900. Then, apply the tax rates to $99,900.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps each rental income and the sale are taxed separately, each on their amount above $20k.

Wait, the problem says: "tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary." So, for each of these incomes (rental and sale), the amount that's above the $20k salary is taxed. So, for each, the taxable amount is the income minus $20k, but only if the income exceeds $20k. But that can't be right because the rental income per year is $4,300, which is less than $20k, so no tax. Similarly, the sale is $61,500, which is more than $20k, so the taxable amount is $61,500 - $20,000 = $41,500.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because the rental income is spread over 10 years, so each year's rental income is $4,300, which is less than $20k, so no tax on that. But the sale is a one-time income of $61,500, so the taxable amount would be $61,500 - $20,000 = $41,500.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the rental income and sale income are each taxed on the amounts above the $20k, but the salary is a separate income. So, the rental income is $58,400 over 10 years, which is $5,840 per year average. Since that's less than $20k, perhaps no tax on the rental income. The sale is $61,500, which is more than $20k, so taxable amount is $61,500 - $20,000 = $41,500.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the $20k is a threshold, and any income from rental and sales that exceeds $20k is taxed. So, the total of rental and sale income is $58,400 + $61,500 = $119,900. Then, the taxable amount is $119,900 - $20,000 = $99,900. Then, apply the tax rates to $99,900.

Alternatively, perhaps each income (rental and sale) is taxed separately. So, for each, the amount above $20k is taxed. But the rental is $58,400, which is over $20k, so taxable amount is $58,400 - $20,000 = $38,400. The sale is $61,500 - $20,000 = $41,500. Then, each is taxed at the given rates.

But I think that's not correct because the problem states that the tax rates are applied to the rental and sales income above the $20k salary. So, the $20k is a personal allowance, and any rental or sales income beyond that is taxed. So, for each, the amount above $20k is taxed.

But wait, the rental income is $58,400 over 10 years. So, per year, that's about $5,840. So, each year, the rental income is $5,840, which is less than $20k, so no tax. The sale is a one-time income of $61,500, which is more than $20k, so taxable amount is $41,500.

But that seems inconsistent because the rental income is spread over 10 years, so each year's rental income is under $20k, so no tax. Only the sale would be taxed on the amount above $20k.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the $20k is a threshold, and any rental and sales income that exceeds it is taxed. So, the total rental and sale income is $58,400 + $61,500 = $119,900. Then, the taxable amount is $119,900 - $20,000 = $99,900. Then, apply the tax rates to $99,900.

But I think I need to clarify: the problem says "tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary." So, for each of these incomes, the amount that exceeds the salary is taxed. So, if the rental income is $58,400, which is over $20k, the taxable amount is $58,400 - $20,000 = $38,400. Similarly, the sale is $61,500, so taxable amount is $61,500 - $20,000 = $41,500. Then, each taxable amount is taxed at the given rates.

Wait, but that would mean two separate taxable amounts: $38,400 from rental and $41,500 from sale. But I think that's not correct because the sale is a one-time income, and the rental is spread over 10 years. So, perhaps the taxes are calculated per year for rental and then once for the sale.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to structure this.

First, let's calculate the total rental income before taxes and depreciation: $58,400.

Then, depreciation is $10,000, so the taxable rental income is $58,400 - $10,000 = $48,400.

Wait, no. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it reduces taxable income. So, the taxable rental income each year is net rental income minus depreciation. Wait, no, depreciation is an expense that reduces taxable income. So, for each year, the taxable income is (rental income - expenses) - depreciation.

Wait, let me clarify:

Each year, the rental income is:

First 3 years: $7,000 rent - $2,700 expenses = $4,300 net income.

Then, depreciation is $1,000, so taxable income is $4,300 - $1,000 = $3,300 per year for 3 years.

Next 7 years: $10,000 rent - $3,500 expenses = $6,500 net income per year.

Depreciation is $1,000, so taxable income is $6,500 - $1,000 = $5,500 per year for 7 years.

So, total taxable rental income over 10 years:

3 years * $3,300 = $9,900

7 years * $5,500 = $38,500

Total: $9,900 + $38,500 = $48,400.

Now, the tax on this $48,400. The tax rates are applied as follows:

The first $4,000 taxed at 33.44%, next $4k at 37.84%, next $4k at 41.36%, next $4k at 44%, and the fifth $4k at 46.64%.

So, let's calculate the tax on $48,400.

Breakdown:

- First $4,000: 33.44%
- Next $4,000: 37.84% (total $8,000)
- Next $4,000: 41.36% (total $12,000)
- Next $4,000: 44% (total $16,000)
- Next $4,000: 46.64% (total $20,000)
- Remaining: $48,400 - $20,000 = $28,400 taxed at 46.64%?

Wait, no, the tax brackets are for each $4,000:

1. 0-4k: 33.44%
2. 4k-8k: 37.84%
3. 8k-12k: 41.36%
4. 12k-16k:44%
5. 16k-20k:46.64%
6. Above 20k: ?

Wait, the problem only specifies the tax rates for the first five $4k brackets. It doesn't specify what happens beyond that. So, perhaps beyond $20k, the tax rate is the same as the last bracket, which is 46.64%? Or maybe it's a flat rate beyond that. The problem doesn't specify, so I might have to assume that the rate continues at 46.64% for the remaining amount.

So, let's compute the tax on $48,400.

$48,400 is $20k + $28,400.

So:

- First $4,000: 33.44% → $4,000 * 0.3344 = $1,337.60
- Next $4,000: 37.84% → $4,000 * 0.3784 = $1,513.60
- Next $4,000: 41.36% → $4,000 * 0.4136 = $1,654.40
- Next $4,000:44% → $4,000 * 0.44 = $1,760
- Next $4,000:46.64% → $4,000 * 0.4664 = $1,865.60
- Remaining: $48,400 - $20,000 = $28,400. Assuming this is taxed at 46.64% → $28,400 * 0.4664 = let's calculate.

Wait, but actually, the tax brackets are applied progressively. So, for each portion within each bracket, the tax is applied at that rate.

So, for $48,400:

- Up to $4k: $4k at 33.44% → $1,337.60
- $4k–$8k: $4k at 37.84% → $1,513.60
- $8k–$12k: $4k at 41.36% → $1,654.40
- $12k–$16k: $4k at 44% → $1,760
- $16k–$20k: $4k at 46.64% → $1,865.60
- $20k–$48,400: $28,400 at 46.64% → $28,400 * 0.4664 = let's compute.

$28,400 * 0.4664 = ?

Well, 28,400 * 0.4 = 11,360

28,400 * 0.0664 = 28,400 * 0.06 = 1,704; 28,400 * 0.0064 = 181.76 → total 1,704 + 181.76 = 1,885.76

So total for this bracket: 11,360 + 1,885.76 = $13,245.76

Now, sum all the tax amounts:

$1,337.60 + $1,513.60 = $2,851.20

+ $1,654.40 → $4,505.60

+ $1,760 → $6,265.60

+ $1,865.60 → $8,131.20

+ $13,245.76 → $21,376.96

So, total tax on rental income: $21,376.96.

Now, let's calculate the tax on the sale income. The sale is $61,500. Since the salary is $20k, the amount above is $61,500 - $20,000 = $41,500. So, the taxable amount is $41,500.

Applying the same tax rates:

$41,500 is:

- First $4k: 33.44% → $1,337.60
- Next $4k: 37.84% → $1,513.60
- Next $4k:41.36% → $1,654.40
- Next $4k:44% → $1,760
- Next $4k:46.64% → $1,865.60
- Remaining: $41,500 - $20,000 = $21,500 taxed at 46.64% → $21,500 * 0.4664

Compute $21,500 * 0.4664:

21,500 * 0.4 = 8,600

21,500 * 0.0664 = let's compute:

21,500 * 0.06 = 1,290

21,500 * 0.0064 = 137.6

Total: 1,290 + 137.6 = 1,427.6

So, total for this portion: 8,600 + 1,427.6 = $10,027.6

Now, sum all the tax amounts for the sale:

$1,337.60 + $1,513.60 = $2,851.20

+ $1,654.40 → $4,505.60

+ $1,760 → $6,265.60

+ $1,865.60 → $8,131.20

+ $10,027.6 → $18,158.80

So, total tax on sale income: $18,158.80.

Now, let's sum up all the cash flows.

Initial investment: $58,000 (outflow)

Rental cash flows after taxes:

Total rental income before taxes: $58,400

Minus depreciation: $10,000 → $48,400 taxable.

But after taxes, the net rental cash flow is $48,400 (taxable income) minus taxes paid: $21,376.96 → $48,400 - $21,376.96 = $27,023.04.

Plus, the sale proceeds after taxes: $61,500 (gross) minus tax on sale: $18,158.80 → $61,500 - $18,158.80 = $43,341.20.

Also, we need to consider the initial expenses and depreciation. Wait, but depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it doesn't affect cash flow. So, the cash flows are:

- Initial outflow: $58,000

+ Rent received each year: $7,000 for first 3 years, $10,000 for next 7 years.

But wait, the rent is received, but expenses are paid. So, net cash flow from rent is $4,300 per year for first 3, $6,500 for next 7.

So, total net rental cash flow: $12,900 + $45,500 = $58,400.

But we have to subtract the taxes paid on rental income, which is $21,376.96.

So, net rental cash flow after taxes: $58,400 - $21,376.96 = $37,023.04.

Plus, the sale proceeds after taxes: $43,341.20.

So, total cash flows:

Initial outflow: -$58,000

Net rental cash flow after taxes: +$37,023.04

Sale proceeds after taxes: +$43,341.20

Total cash flow: -$58,000 + $37,023.04 + $43,341.20 = let's compute.

$37,023.04 + $43,341.20 = $80,364.24

$80,364.24 - $58,000 = $22,364.24

So, net gain is $22,364.24.

Now, the percentage gain relative to the initial investment of $58,000 is:

(22,364.24 / 58,000) * 100 = ?

Let me compute:

22,364.24 ÷ 58,000 ≈ 0.3856 → 38.56%

Wait, that can't be right because the options are way lower. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the cash flows. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the net rental cash flow after taxes is $27,023.04, and the sale proceeds after taxes is $43,341.20.

Total inflows: $27,023.04 + $43,341.20 = $70,364.24

Minus initial investment: $58,000

Net gain: $70,364.24 - $58,000 = $12,364.24

Percentage gain: (12,364.24 / 58,000) * 100 ≈ 21.32%

But that's not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the tax on the sale. Because the sale is a capital gain, perhaps it's taxed differently. Wait, the problem mentions that the tax rates are applied to the rental and sales income, so perhaps the sale is treated as ordinary income, not capital gain. So, my earlier approach is correct.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again.

Rental income after taxes: $48,400 taxable, tax paid $21,376.96 → net rental income after taxes: $27,023.04.

Sale proceeds: $61,500, tax on sale is $18,158.80 → net sale proceeds: $43,341.20.

Total cash inflows: $27,023.04 + $43,341.20 = $70,364.24.

Total cash outflow: $58,000.

Net gain: $70,364.24 - $58,000 = $12,364.24.

Percentage gain: 12,364.24 / 58,000 ≈ 21.32%.

But the options don't have this. The closest is E:4.2%, but that's way off. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm including the depreciation in the wrong way. Let me go back.

Wait, the depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it reduces taxable income but doesn't affect the cash flow. So, the rental cash flow is net rental income (after expenses) plus depreciation, because depreciation is added back to cash flow.

Wait, no. The net rental income is rent - expenses = $4,300 for first 3 years, $6,500 for next 7. So, total net rental income is $58,400.

But depreciation is $1,000 per year, so total depreciation is $10,000. Since depreciation is a non-cash expense, it doesn't affect the actual cash flow, but it reduces taxable income. So, the taxable income is $58,400 - $10,000 = $48,400.

Wait, but the cash flow from operations is $58,400 (net rental income) because depreciation doesn't affect it. Then, taxes are based on taxable income of $48,400, which is $21,376.96. So, cash flow after taxes would be $58,400 - $21,376.96 = $37,023.04.

Then, the sale proceeds are $61,500, but taxed at $18,158.80, so net proceeds are $43,341.20.

Total cash inflows: $37,023.04 + $43,341.20 = $80,364.24

Minus initial investment: $58,000

Net gain: $80,364.24 - $58,000 = $22,364.24

Percentage gain: 22,364.24 /58,000 ≈ 38.56%. That's way higher than the options. So, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the tax application.

Wait, perhaps the tax is applied to the rental and sales income above the $20k salary, meaning that the total of rental and sale income is considered, and anything above $20k is taxed. So, total rental is $58,400, sale is $61,500. Total = $119,900. Taxable amount is $119,900 - $20,000 = $99,900.

Then, tax on $99,900 is calculated as:

$99,900 is:

- First $4k: 33.44% → $1,337.60
- Next $4k: 37.84% → $1,513.60
- Next $4k:41.36% → $1,654.40
- Next $4k:44% → $1,760
- Next $4k:46.64% → $1,865.60
- Remaining: $99,900 - $20,000 = $79,900 → taxed at 46.64% → $79,900 * 0.4664 = ?

Wait, but that would be a huge tax. Let me compute that.

$79,900 * 0.4664 = ?

Well, 80,000 * 0.4664 = 37,312. So, 79,900 would be slightly less, say ≈37,300.

So, total tax would be:

$1,337.60 + $1,513.60 = $2,851.20

+ $1,654.40 → $4,505.60

+ $1,760 → $6,265.60

+ $1,865.60 → $8,131.20

+ $37,300 → $45,431.20

So, total tax is ≈$45,431.20.

Then, total income before tax: $119,900

Minus tax: $45,431.20 → net income: $74,468.80

Initial investment: $58,000

Gain: $74,468.80 - $58,000 = $16,468.80

Percentage gain: 16,468.80 /58,000 ≈28.39%. Still not matching options.

Hmm, I'm clearly making a mistake in the tax calculation approach. Let me try another angle.

Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the net cash flow, considering all cash inflows and outflows, including taxes and depreciation.

Let me outline the cash flows properly:

1. Initial Investment: -$58,000 (land + house)

2. Year 1-3:

   - Rent received: $7,000/year
   - Expenses: -$2,700/year
   - Net cash flow: $4,300/year
   - Depreciation: non-cash expense, so it reduces taxable income but doesn't affect cash flow.

   Taxable income each year: $4,300 (net rental) - $1,000 (depreciation) = $3,300

   Tax on $3,300: since it's above the salary of $20k? Wait, no, the salary is $20k, and the rental income is $4,300, which is less than 20k, so perhaps no tax. Wait, but the tax rates apply to rental and sales income above the salary. So, if the rental income is $4,300, which is less than $20k, then no tax on that. So, tax for these years is zero.

3. Year 4-10:

   - Rent received: $10,000/year
   - Expenses: -$3,500/year
   - Net cash flow: $6,500/year
   - Depreciation: -$1,000/year (non-cash)

   Taxable income each year: $6,500 - $1,000 = $5,500

   Tax on $5,500: since it's above $20k? No, because $5,500 is less than $20k, so no tax.

Wait, this can't be right because then there's no tax on the rental income. But the problem says the tax rates apply to rental and sales income above the salary. So, perhaps the rental income is taxed on the amount above $20k. But since the rental income is $4,300 and $6,500, which are both below $20k, there's no tax on the rental income. Only the sale income is above $20k, so it's taxed.

So, let's recast the cash flows:

Initial investment: -$58,000

Year 1-3:

   Net rental cash flow: $4,300/year × 3 = $12,900

Year 4-10:

   Net rental cash flow: $6,500/year ×7 = $45,500

Total rental cash flow: $12,900 + $45,500 = $58,400

Sale at year 10:

   Proceeds: $61,500

   Tax on sale: $61,500 - $20,000 = $41,500 taxable

   Tax on $41,500:

   Breakdown:

   - First $4k: 33.44% → $1,337.60
   - Next $4k:37.84% → $1,513.60
   - Next $4k:41.36% → $1,654.40
   - Next $4k:44% → $1,760
   - Next $4k:46.64% → $1,865.60
   - Remaining: $41,500 - $20,000 = $21,500 → taxed at 46.64% → $21,500 × 0.4664 = $10,027.60

   Total tax: $1,337.60 + $1,513.60 + $1,654.40 + $1,760 + $1,865.60 + $10,027.60 = let's compute:

   1,337.60 + 1,513.60 = 2,851.20

   +1,654.40 → 4,505.60

   +1,760 → 6,265.60

   +1,865.60 → 8,131.20

   +10,027.60 → 18,158.80

So, tax on sale: $18,158.80

Sale proceeds after tax: $61,500 - $18,158.80 = $43,341.20

Now, let's sum up all cash flows:

Initial investment: -$58,000

Rental cash flows: +$58,400

Sale proceeds after tax: +$43,341.20

Total cash flows: (-58,000) +58,400 +43,341.20 = (-58,000 + 58,400)=400 +43,341.20=43,741.20

Net gain: $43,741.20 - $58,000 = -$14,258.80

Wait, that can't be right because the sale proceeds after tax are $43k, which is more than the initial investment. So, I must have messed up the signs.

Wait, initial investment is -$58k. Then, rental cash flows are +58.4k, sale is +43.341.20.

So, total: -58,000 +58,400 = 400 +43,341.20 = 43,741.20.

So, net gain is 43,741.20 -58,000 = -14,258.80? That can't be, because 43k is more than 58k.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial investment is 58k, and the total cash received is 58.4k (rental) +43.341.20 (sale) = 101,741.20. So, 101,741.20 -58,000 =43,741.20 gain.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the net gain is $43,741.20.

Wait, but that would mean a gain of 43,741.20 /58,000 ≈75.41%. But the options don't have that.

I must have made a mistake. Let me recast:

Total cash inflows:

Rental: $58,400

Sale: $43,341.20

Total: $58,400 + $43,341.20 = $101,741.20

Minus initial investment: $58,000

Net gain: $101,741.20 - $58,000 = $43,741.20

Percentage gain: 43,741.20 /58,000 ≈75.41%. Not matching options.

Hmm, clearly, I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me try a different method, perhaps using the time value of money to discount the cash flows, considering the 7% interest rate.

Yes, the question mentions the current interest rate is 7%, so we need to calculate the net present value (NPV) to find the gain or loss.

So, let's calculate the NPV of all cash flows.

Initial investment: Year 0: -$58,000

Rental cash flows:

Years 1-3: $4,300/year

Years 4-10: $6,500/year

Sale proceeds at Year 10: $61,500 (gross), but after tax: $43,341.20 as calculated earlier.

So, cash flows:

Year 0: -58,000

Year 1: +4,300

Year 2: +4,300

Year 3: +4,300

Year 4: +6,500

Year 5: +6,500

Year 6: +6,500

Year 7: +6,500

Year 8: +6,500

Year 9: +6,500

Year 10: +6,500 (rental) +43,341.20 (sale) = +49,841.20

Now, calculate the NPV using 7% discount rate.

NPV formula: NPV = sum of (CF_t / (1 + r)^t )

Let me compute each cash flow's present value:

Year 0: -58,000 /1.07^0 = -58,000

Year 1: 4,300 /1.07 = 4,018.69

Year 2:4,300/(1.07)^2=4,300/1.1449≈3,754.79

Year 3:4,300/(1.07)^3≈4,300/1.225043≈3,512.68

Year 4:6,500/(1.07)^4≈6,500/1.31083≈4,956.86

Year 5:6,500/(1.07)^5≈6,500/1.40255≈4,632.57

Year 6:6,500/(1.07)^6≈6,500/1.50362≈4,320.80

Year 7:6,500/(1.07)^7≈6,500/1.60563≈4,047.72

Year 8:6,500/(1.07)^8≈6,500/1.71382≈3,793.40

Year 9:6,500/(1.07)^9≈6,500/1.83846≈3,536.42

Year 10:49,841.20/(1.07)^10≈49,841.20/2.01376≈24,753.56

Now, sum all the present values:

Year 0: -58,000

Year 1: +4,018.69

Year 2: +3,754.79 → total so far: -58,000 +7,773.48 = -50,226.52

Year 3: +3,512.68 → -50,226.52 +3,512.68 = -46,713.84

Year 4: +4,956.86 → -46,713.84 +4,956.86 = -41,756.98

Year 5: +4,632.57 → -41,756.98 +4,632.57 = -37,124.41

Year 6: +4,320.80 → -37,124.41 +4,320.80 = -32,803.61

Year 7: +4,047.72 → -32,803.61 +4,047.72 = -28,755.89

Year 8: +3,793.40 → -28,755.89 +3,793.40 = -24,962.49

Year 9: +3,536.42 → -24,962.49 +3,536.42 = -21,426.07

Year 10: +24,753.56 → -21,426.07 +24,753.56 = +3,327.49

So, NPV ≈$3,327.49

This is a positive NPV, meaning a gain. The percentage gain is NPV / initial investment.

Percentage gain: (3,327.49 /58,000) *100 ≈5.735%.

Looking at the options, F is 5.7%, which is close. So, the answer is F.
