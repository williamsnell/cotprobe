Okay, so I've got this question about Gamma Co., a medical products manufacturer. The question is asking about their profit margin on sales. The data given is a 10% return on assets and an asset turnover of 4:1. I'm a bit rusty on my financial ratios, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what each of these terms means. Return on assets (ROA) is a financial metric that shows how much profit a company makes for each dollar of its assets. It's calculated by dividing net profit (or net income) by total assets. So, ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets.

Asset turnover, on the other hand, measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as Sales divided by Total Assets. So, Asset Turnover = Sales / Total Assets.

The question is asking for the profit margin on sales, which is also known as the net profit margin. This ratio shows how much of each sale translates into profit. It's calculated by dividing Net Profit by Sales. So, Profit Margin = Net Profit / Sales.

Wait, but we don't have the actual numbers, just the ratios. So I need to connect these ratios together to find the profit margin. Let me think about how these ratios relate to each other.

I remember that ROA can be broken down into the product of the profit margin and the asset turnover. So, ROA = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover. This makes sense because ROA is about how much profit you get per dollar of assets, and asset turnover is how much sales you get per dollar of assets. So multiplying the two gives you the profit per dollar of assets.

So, if I rearrange that formula to solve for the profit margin, it would be:

Profit Margin = ROA / Asset Turnover.

Given that, I can plug in the numbers from the question. Gamma Co.'s ROA is 10%, which is 0.10, and the asset turnover is 4:1, which is 4.

So, Profit Margin = 0.10 / 4 = 0.025. To express that as a percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.025 × 100 = 2.5%. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 2.5%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the options. The options are A to I, and looking back, option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%. Oh, right, because 0.025 is the decimal form, not the percentage. So the correct answer would be 2.5%, which is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. ROA is 10%, which is 0.10. Asset turnover is 4, so 0.10 divided by 4 is indeed 0.025. That's correct. So the profit margin is 2.5%, which is option C.

Gamma Co.'s profit margin on sales can be calculated using the relationship between ROA, asset turnover, and profit margin. The formula is:

Profit Margin = ROA / Asset Turnover.

Given:
- ROA = 10% = 0.10
- Asset Turnover = 4:1 = 4

Plugging in the values:
Profit Margin = 0.10 / 4 = 0.025, which is 2.5%.

The correct answer is C: 0.025.
