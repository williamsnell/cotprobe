C: (∀x)(Lx ⊃ ~Rx)
D: (∃x)(~Lx • Rx)
E: ~(∀x)(Lx • Rx)
F: (∃x)(Lx • ~Rx)
G: ~(∃x)(Lx • Rx)
H: (∃x)(Lx ⊃ ~Rx)
I: ~(∀x)(~Lx ⊃ Rx)
J: ~(∃x)(Lx ⊃ Rx)

Okay, so I have this question about translating the sentence "Not all lobsters are red" into predicate logic. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

First, I remember that in predicate logic, "all" translates to a universal quantifier, which is ∀. So the original statement "All lobsters are red" would be ∀x (Lx → Rx), where Lx means "x is a lobster" and Rx means "x is red." 

But the given sentence is the negation of that. So instead of saying that every lobster is red, it's saying it's not the case that every lobster is red. That means I need to negate the entire statement.

I recall that the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement. So ¬(∀x P(x)) is equivalent to ∃x ¬P(x). Applying that here, ¬(∀x (Lx → Rx)) becomes ∃x ¬(Lx → Rx).

Now, I need to figure out what ¬(Lx → Rx) means. I remember that an implication like A → B is logically equivalent to ¬A ∨ B. So Lx → Rx is the same as ¬Lx ∨ Rx. The negation of that would be ¬(¬Lx ∨ Rx), which by De Morgan's laws becomes Lx ∧ ¬Rx.

So putting it together, the negation of the original statement becomes ∃x (Lx ∧ ¬Rx). This reads as "There exists an x such that x is a lobster and x is not red."

Now looking at the options:

Option F is (∃x)(Lx • ~Rx), which seems to match exactly what I derived. The other options don't fit. For example, Option A is the negation of the universal statement, but it's written as ~(∀x)(Lx ⊃ Rx), which is correct in terms of negation but not simplified. Wait, no, actually, the question is about the best translation. So between A and F, which is better? 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The original statement is "Not all lobsters are red," which is equivalent to saying "There exists at least one lobster that is not red." That's exactly what F says: ∃x (Lx ∧ ~Rx). 

Option A is ~(∀x)(Lx → Rx), which is also correct because it's the direct negation. So both A and F are correct in a sense, but the question is asking for the best translation. In predicate logic, it's often preferable to express statements in their simplest form, using existentials rather than negated universals. So F is the more direct and simplified version. 

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

The sentence "Not all lobsters are red" is best translated into predicate logic as ∃x (Lx ∧ ~Rx), which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
