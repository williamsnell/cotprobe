Okay, so I have this problem about B Corporation's total profit function, and I need to find the marginal profit and the output quantities. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the total profit function is given as π = -3000 - 2400Q + 350Q² - 8.333Q³. I remember that marginal profit is the derivative of the total profit with respect to Q. So, to find the marginal profit, I need to take the first derivative of π with respect to Q.

Let me compute that. The derivative of a constant is zero, so the -3000 goes away. The derivative of -2400Q is -2400. For the 350Q² term, the derivative is 2*350Q = 700Q. And the derivative of -8.333Q³ is 3*(-8.333)Q², which is -25Q². So putting it all together, the marginal profit (π') should be:

π' = -2400 + 700Q - 25Q².

Wait, that seems right. So that's part a done.

Now part b is to determine the output quantities. I think this refers to the quantities where marginal profit is zero or possibly where profit is maximized. Since profit is a cubic function with a negative coefficient on Q³, it's a downward cubic, so the maximum profit occurs at a certain point. But I'm not entirely sure, maybe I should find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero.

So setting π' = 0:

-2400 + 700Q -25Q² = 0.

Let me rearrange this equation to make it easier to solve. Multiply both sides by -1 to get:

25Q² -700Q + 2400 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:

25Q² -700Q + 2400 = 0.

To make it simpler, maybe divide all terms by 25. Let's see:

25Q²/25 = Q², 700/25 is 28, and 2400/25 is 96. So the equation becomes:

Q² -28Q +96 = 0.

Wait, that's a simpler quadratic. Let me check if that's correct. Oh wait, 25*28 is 700, yes. And 25*96 is 2400. So yes, correct.

Now I can solve for Q using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is Q² -28Q +96 = 0. The quadratic formula is Q = [28 ± sqrt( (-28)^2 -4*1*96 )]/(2*1).

Calculating discriminant D: 28² is 784. 4*1*96 is 384. So D = 784 - 384 = 400.

Square root of 400 is 20. So,

Q = [28 ±20]/2.

So two solutions:

First solution: (28 +20)/2 = 48/2 =24.

Second solution: (28-20)/2=8/2=4.

So Q=24 and Q=4 are the critical points.

But wait, in the context of profit, these are the points where marginal profit is zero. But since the profit function is a cubic with a negative leading coefficient, the function will have a local maximum and a local minimum. So we need to determine which of these is the maximum and which is the minimum.

The second derivative will help. Let me compute the second derivative of π.

We had the first derivative π' = -2400 +700Q -25Q².

So the second derivative π'' is 700 -50Q.

At Q=4: π'' =700 -50*4=700-200=500. Since it's positive, this point is a local minimum.

At Q=24: π''=700 -50*24=700-1200= -500. Negative, so this is a local maximum.

Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at Q=24 units. But wait, the question in part b says "determine its output quantities". So maybe it's asking for both the points where marginal profit is zero, which are 4 and 24.

But looking at the options, the possible answers are pairs of numbers. Let me check the options.

Options are A to J, each with two numbers. For example, option E is 24 and 4 units. That matches our results: 24 is the maximum, and 4 is the minimum.

Wait, but the question says "determine its output quantities", so perhaps it's asking for the quantity that maximizes profit, which is 24, and perhaps another point? Or maybe it's just the two critical points.

Looking at the options, option E is 24 and 4 units. So that seems to fit.

Wait, but the problem says a) compute marginal profit, which I did, and b) determine output quantities. So the output quantities where marginal profit is zero are 4 and 24. So the answer should be 24 and 4, which is option E.

The marginal profit is calculated as the derivative of the total profit function, resulting in π' = -2400 + 700Q - 25Q². To find the output quantities where marginal profit is zero, solve the quadratic equation -2400 + 700Q - 25Q² = 0, which simplifies to Q² - 28Q + 96 = 0. Solving this gives Q = 24 and Q = 4. Since the second derivative at Q=24 is negative (indicating a maximum) and at Q=4 is positive (indicating a minimum), the relevant output quantities are 24 and 4 units.
