Okay, so I've got this question about cleavage symmetry in early cell divisions. The question is asking what kind of cleavage happens when the divisions occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis. Hmm, I remember that cleavage refers to the way cells divide in early embryos, and it affects the symmetry and the body plan.

The options are A to J. Let me think about each term. Rotational cleavageâ€”I'm not sure about that. Radial cleavage is when the cells divide along the polar axis, creating a radial pattern, like spokes on a wheel. Transverse cleavage would be divisions that are perpendicular to the polar axis, maybe cutting across it. Holoblastic cleavage refers to the type where all the yolk is divided, like in most frogs. Concentric cleavage is when layers form around a central point, which I think happens in some invertebrates. Superficial cleavage is when only the outer layers divide, like in some arthropods. Bilateral cleavage leads to symmetry along a plane, like left and right. Spiral cleavage is when divisions are at an angle, creating a spiral pattern, which I think is seen in some molluscs. Meroblastic cleavage is when only part of the yolk is divided, like in birds or reptiles. Oblique cleavage sounds like divisions at an angle, not straight.

Wait, the question says the cleavage is at an oblique angle to the polar axis. So that would mean the divisions are diagonal, not perpendicular or parallel. Spiral cleavage involves divisions that are at an angle, creating a spiral. So that would fit. Alternatively, oblique cleavage is directly described as at an oblique angle, so maybe option J. But I'm a bit confused because I thought spiral cleavage is a specific type of oblique division leading to a spiral pattern.

So the question is about the term used when the angle is oblique. If spiral cleavage is a form of oblique cleavage, then the answer could be either H or J. Wait, but the options list 'oblique cleavage' as J, which seems to directly describe the angle. So the correct term would be oblique cleavage, making J the answer.

The question asks about cleavage symmetry when divisions occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis. Among the options, "oblique cleavage" directly describes divisions at such an angle, making it the correct answer.

Answer: J
