Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is asking me to find the K_b and pK_b for the acetate ion, CH3COO^-. They've given me the ionization constant of acetic acid, CH3COOH, which is K_a = 1.75 × 10^-5, and K_w is 1.00 × 10^-14. The options are from A to J, each giving different values for K_b and pK_b.

Hmm, right. I remember that for weak acids and their conjugate bases, the ionization constants are related through K_w. Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, I think I need to find K_b using K_a and K_w.

Wait, the formula I learned is K_a * K_b = K_w. Is that right? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For a conjugate acid-base pair, the product of their ionization constants equals K_w. So if the acid is HA, then A^- is the base. So K_a for HA and K_b for A^- should multiply to K_w.

Yes, so K_a (for the acid) times K_b (for the conjugate base) equals K_w, which is 1e-14.

Given that, I can rearrange the formula to solve for K_b. So K_b = K_w / K_a.

Let me plug in the numbers. K_w is 1.00 × 10^-14, and K_a is 1.75 × 10^-5.

So K_b = (1.00 × 10^-14) / (1.75 × 10^-5).

Let me calculate that. 1e-14 divided by 1.75e-5.

First, 1 divided by 1.75 is approximately 0.5714. Then, 1e-14 divided by 1e-5 is 1e-9. So 0.5714 × 1e-9 is approximately 5.714 × 10^-10.

So K_b is about 5.71 × 10^-10.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see. Option B says K_b = 5.71 × 10^-10, pK_b = 9.244. Option A is 5.71e-9, which is larger than my calculation, so not that. Option C is even smaller, 5.71e-11. So B seems correct for K_b.

Now, pK_b is the negative logarithm of K_b. So pK_b = -log(K_b).

Let me compute that. K_b is 5.71e-10.

So log(5.71e-10) = log(5.71) + log(1e-10).

Log(5.71) is about 0.756, because log(5)=0.69897, and log(6)=0.77815. So 5.71 is closer to 5.7, which is about 0.756.

So log(5.71e-10) = 0.756 - 10 = -9.244.

Wait, wait, no. Because log(1e-10) is -10, so log(5.71e-10) = log(5.71) + (-10) = 0.756 -10 = -9.244.

But wait, pK_b is -log(K_b), so pK_b is -(-9.244) = 9.244.

So pK_b is 9.244, which matches option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the K_b calculation. Did I do that correctly? 1e-14 divided by 1.75e-5.

Yes, because 1e-14 ÷ 1e-5 = 1e-9. Then 1e-9 divided by 1.75 is approximately 0.571e-9, which is 5.71e-10. Correct.

So option B has K_b as 5.71e-10 and pK_b as 9.244. That seems right.

Looking at the other options, for example, option E says K_b is 5.71e-10, pK_b is 14 - log(5.71e-10). Wait, 14 minus log(K_b) would be 14 - (something around 9.244) which is around 4.756. That doesn't make sense because pK_b should be around 9, so E's pK_b is incorrect.

Option A has K_b as 5.71e-9, which is 10 times larger than what I calculated, so that's wrong.

So the correct answer must be option B.

To determine the base ionization constant \( K_b \) and \( pK_b \) for the acetate ion (\( CH_3COO^- \)), we use the relationship between \( K_a \) (for acetic acid, \( CH_3COOH \)) and \( K_b \) via the water ionization constant \( K_w \). 

Given:
- \( K_a = 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \)
- \( K_w = 1.00 \times 10^{-14} \)

The formula is:
\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
K_b = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-14}}{1.75 \times 10^{-5}} = \frac{1}{1.75} \times 10^{-9} \approx 5.71 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Next, calculate \( pK_b \) using:
\[
pK_b = -\log(K_b)
\]

\[
\log(5.71 \times 10^{-10}) = \log(5.71) + \log(10^{-10}) \approx 0.756 - 10 = -9.244
\]
\[
pK_b = -(-9.244) = 9.244
\]

Thus, \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \) and \( pK_b = 9.244 \), which matches option B.
