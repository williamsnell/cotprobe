B: Only chemicals can cause cancer
C: Only inherited genetics can cause cancer
D: Only lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise can cause cancer

Alright, so I've got this question about whether viruses can cause cancer. I remember from my biology classes that various factors contribute to cancer development, like radiation, chemicals, and even genetics. But wait, can viruses also play a role?

I think I've heard something about certain viruses being linked to cancers. Maybe like the HPV virus? I believe HPV is connected to cervical cancer. There's also the Epstein-Barr Virus, which I think is associated with some types of lymphomas. Oh right, and Hepatitis B is linked to liver cancer. So these are examples where viruses are indeed implicated.

So the question is asking if viruses can be a cause, and the options are E (Yes) and F (No). From what I remember, the answer should be yes because several viruses are known to contribute to cancer development. They might not cause it directly in every case, but they definitely increase the risk or are direct causes in specific cancers.

Looking at the options again, E says "Yes, viruses can be a cause of cancer." That makes sense because viruses like HPV and EBV are established causes. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: Yes, viruses can be a cause of cancer. Viruses like HPV, EBV, and Hepatitis B are known to contribute to cancer development.

Answer: E
