Okay, so I have this problem where I need to approximate the area under the curve y = f(x) between x=0 and x=8 using the Trapezoidal rule with n=4 subintervals. The function f(x) is given at specific points: f(0)=3, f(2)=7, f(4)=11, f(6)=9, and f(8)=3. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Trapezoidal rule is a numerical integration method used to approximate the definite integral of a function. The formula for the Trapezoidal rule when n subintervals are used is:

∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx ≈ (Δx/2) [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + ... + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(xₙ)]

Where Δx is the width of each subinterval, calculated as (b - a)/n. In this case, a is 0 and b is 8, and n is 4. So Δx would be (8 - 0)/4 = 2. That makes sense because the given points are every 2 units apart.

So, the points are at x=0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. That's 5 points, which fits with n=4 subintervals (since n+1 points are needed). 

Now, applying the formula: 

The formula says to take the first and last terms once and all the middle terms multiplied by 2. So, let's list out the values:

f(x₀) = f(0) = 3

f(x₁) = f(2) =7

f(x₂) = f(4)=11

f(x₃) = f(6)=9

f(x₄)=f(8)=3

So, plugging into the formula:

Sum = f(0) + 2*f(2) + 2*f(4) + 2*f(6) + f(8)

Calculating each term:

f(0) = 3

2*f(2) = 2*7=14

2*f(4)=2*11=22

2*f(6)=2*9=18

f(8)=3

Now, adding them all together: 3 +14 +22 +18 +3.

Let me compute that:

3 +14 is 17.

17 +22 is 39.

39 +18 is 57.

57 +3 is 60.

So the sum inside the brackets is 60.

Now, multiply this by Δx/2, which is (2)/2=1.

So, the approximate integral (area) is 60 * 1 = 60.

Looking at the options, option B is 60.0.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me re-add the sum:

3 (from f(0)) + 14 (2*7) = 17.

17 +22 (2*11) = 39.

39 +18 (2*9) = 57.

57 +3 (f(8)) = 60. Yes, that's correct.

So the area is 60.0, which is option B.

The area under the curve is approximated using the Trapezoidal rule with n=4 subintervals. The function values are given at x=0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Applying the Trapezoidal formula, the sum of the function values with appropriate coefficients is calculated to be 60. Multiplying by Δx/2 (which is 1) gives the area as 60.0.

Answer: B
