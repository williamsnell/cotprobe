Question:

After her husband died in a hospital, a widow directed the hospital to send her husband's body to a funeral home for burial. The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress. She has sued the hospital. Is the hospital likely to be held liable to the widow?

Options:

A: No, because the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm.
B: No, because the hospital's mistake was not intentional.
C: Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress. 
D: Yes, because the hospital was responsible for the correct identification and handling of the body.
E: Yes, because hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses.
F: No, because the widow did not suffer any physical harm.
G: No, because the widow did not witness the cremation.
H: No, because the widow was not physically present at the time of the incident.
I: Yes, because the hospital should have double-checked the identity of the body before sending it for cremation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it carefully. The situation is that a widow's husband died in a hospital. She told the hospital to send his body to a funeral home for burial. But the hospital made a mistake—they sent the wrong body to be cremated instead. When she found out, she suffered serious emotional distress and sued the hospital. The question is whether the hospital is likely liable.

Hmm, I remember that in tort law, negligence is about whether the defendant owed a duty, breached that duty, caused harm, and whether damages resulted. So, did the hospital breach a duty here?

The hospital was handling the body, which is a sensitive task. They probably have a duty to correctly identify and handle the body. They misidentified it, leading to cremation instead of burial. That seems like a breach of their duty.

But wait, the widow didn't suffer physical harm. She's suing for emotional distress. I'm trying to recall if emotional distress can be a basis for liability without physical harm. I think there's something about negligent infliction of emotional distress. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

In some cases, like if someone witnesses a traumatic event, they can claim emotional distress. But here, the widow wasn't present when the body was mishandled; she was informed later. So maybe the fact that she wasn't physically present affects the claim.

I think there's a distinction between emotional distress that's a foreseeable result of negligence (like in cases where someone's close relative is injured) and distress that's more attenuated. In this case, the widow's distress comes from the wrongful handling of her husband's body, which is a direct result of the hospital's negligence. So maybe that's enough.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because no bodily harm. But I think emotional distress can sometimes be compensable without physical harm. So maybe A is wrong.

B: No, because not intentional. But negligence isn't about intent; it's about breach of duty. So B might not be the right reason.

C: Yes, because the handling was especially likely to cause distress. That sounds plausible because handling a corpse negligently, especially in a way that's irreversible like cremation, is likely to cause emotional harm to the family.

D: Yes, because responsible for correct handling. That's a duty issue. The hospital had a duty, so if they breached it, they could be liable. So D seems correct too.

E: Yes, strict liability. I don't think hospitals are strictly liable for this kind of mistake. It's more about negligence, so E might not be correct.

F: No, because no physical harm. Similar to A. But as I thought earlier, emotional distress can be a damage in negligence, so F might be incorrect.

G: No, because she didn't witness it. I think some jurisdictions require witnessing the event, but others consider the distress caused by the event regardless of witnessing. So G might not be the right answer.

H: No, because not present. Again, this relates to witnessing. If she wasn't present, maybe the distress isn't as direct. But I'm not sure if presence is required for emotional distress in this context.

I: Yes, because they should have double-checked. This points to the breach of duty—failure to verify the identity. So I is correct.

So which options are correct? The question is whether the hospital is likely liable. Both C and D and I seem to support liability.

Wait, the question is about negligence. So the key elements are duty, breach, causation, and damages. The duty here is to handle the body correctly. The breach was the misidentification. The cause was that the body was sent for cremation, leading to the widow's distress. Damages are her emotional distress.

But can she recover for emotional distress without physical harm? I think in some jurisdictions, yes, if the distress is a foreseeable result of the negligence. Here, mishandling a corpse is likely to cause emotional distress to a widow.

So looking at the options, C says yes because the handling was especially likely to cause distress. I think that's correct. D says yes because of the duty, which is also correct. I says yes because they should have double-checked, which is also correct.

Wait, but the options are only to choose one. The correct answer would be one of these.

In some cases, courts have held that negligently mishandling a corpse can be grounds for liability for emotional distress. So options C, D, and I all point towards yes.

But let's think again. The question is whether the hospital is likely to be held liable. So the correct answer would be one of the 'Yes' options.

Between C, D, and I.

Option C: Yes, because the negligent handling was especially likely to cause distress.

Option D: Yes, because responsible for correct handling.

Option I: Yes, because they should have double-checked.

So which one is the best choice.

I think the reasoning in C and D are both correct, but C focuses on the foreseeability of emotional distress, which is a key element in negligence for damages.

Alternatively, D focuses on the duty, which is also important. But the question is about liability, so the duty is there, but the damages would be the emotional distress.

So perhaps C is the better answer because it directly addresses why the handling was negligent and why it caused distress.

Alternatively, I is also a good reason, but it's more about the breach—failing to double-check.

But in terms of the question, the correct answer is likely C or D.

Wait, in some jurisdictions, the negligent handling of a corpse can be a basis for emotional distress damages. So the correct answer is yes, because the handling was especially likely to cause distress. So option C.

Alternatively, option I is about the duty to check, which is part of the breach. So maybe I is also correct, but the question is whether they're liable, not whether they breached.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe the correct answer is C because it's about the foreseeability of the emotional distress, which is a key element in the damages part of negligence.

But another angle: The hospital's duty was to correctly identify and handle the body. They breached that duty. The widow's distress was a foreseeable result. So D also points to that.

Wait, the question is about liability. So the duty and breach are part of establishing liability, but the damages (emotional distress) are also necessary.

So perhaps the correct answer is C, because it's about the handling causing the distress, which is the damage part.

Alternatively, D is about the duty, which is necessary for liability. So both C and D are correct in their reasoning, but the question is about whether they're liable, which would involve all elements.

But looking at the options, I need to pick one. The best answer is likely C because it directly addresses the cause of the emotional distress due to the negligent handling, making the hospital liable.
</think>

The hospital is likely to be held liable to the widow because the negligent handling of her husband's body, which caused his cremation instead of burial, was especially likely to result in serious emotional distress. This emotional distress is a foreseeable harm stemming from the hospital's breach of their duty to correctly identify and handle the body. 

Answer: C
