Okay, so I've got this problem here about a steel shaft transferring power through gears. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says the shaft is transferring 50 horsepower (hp) to another parallel shaft using gears. The gears are equally spaced from the shaft bearings. The gear has a diameter of 5 inches and revolves at 1000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The pressure angle is 25 degrees. I need to find the force exerted on each bearing.

Alright, so I remember that when a shaft is transmitting power through gears, the force on the shaft is related to the torque. Torque is calculated from the power and the rotational speed. But wait, I think the formula for torque is Torque (T) equals power divided by angular velocity. But units are important here because horsepower is in hp, and I need to convert that to something usable, like foot-pounds or inch-pounds.

Let me jot down the formula: Torque (T) = (Power) / (ω), where ω is the angular velocity in radians per second. But first, I need to convert horsepower to watts or another unit I can work with. Oh wait, I remember that 1 horsepower is approximately 550 foot-pounds per second. So 50 hp would be 50 * 550 = 27,500 foot-pounds per second.

But wait, torque is in foot-pounds, and I have the gear diameter in inches. Hmm, maybe it's better to convert everything to inches for consistency. Let me think: 1 foot is 12 inches, so a foot-pound is 12 inch-pounds. So 27,500 foot-pounds per second is 27,500 * 12 = 330,000 inch-pounds per second.

Now, the angular velocity ω is 1000 rpm. To convert rpm to radians per second, I multiply by (2π radians) / (60 seconds). So ω = 1000 * (2π/60) ≈ 1000 * 0.1047 ≈ 104.72 radians per second.

So now, torque T = Power / ω. Wait, but power is in inch-pounds per second, and torque will be in inch-pounds. So T = (330,000 inch-lb/s) / (104.72 rad/s) ≈ 330,000 / 104.72 ≈ 3153.7 inch-pounds. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. Because when we use the formula T = (Power) / ω, the power should be in torque multiplied by angular velocity. Wait, but power in horsepower needs to be converted correctly. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, I recall that the formula for power transmitted by a shaft is P = (T * ω) / 60, where P is in horsepower, T is torque in foot-pounds, and ω is in rpm. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me double-check.

Wait, the correct formula to convert horsepower to torque is T (in foot-pounds) = (P * 60 * 550) / (2π * N), where N is the speed in rpm. Because 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s, so P (hp) = (T * ω) / 550, where ω is in rad/s. Alternatively, since ω in rpm is (2πN)/60, substituting that in, we get T = (P * 60 * 550) / (2πN).

Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me try that.

So, T = (50 hp * 60 * 550 ft-lbf/s) / (2π * 1000 rpm). Wait, but that would give me torque in foot-pounds. Let me compute that.

First, 50 * 60 = 3000, and 3000 * 550 = 1,650,000. Then, denominator is 2π * 1000 ≈ 6283.185. So T ≈ 1,650,000 / 6283.185 ≈ 263.2 foot-pounds.

Wait, that's torque in foot-pounds. But the gear is 5 inches in diameter, which I think is the pitch diameter. But I'm not sure how that ties in yet.

Wait, the problem involves a gear, so perhaps I should consider the force on the shaft due to the gear. The force transmitted by the gear teeth can be calculated using the formula F = (T * 2) / (d * sin(θ)), where θ is the pressure angle. Wait, is that right? Or maybe F = (2T) / (d * sinθ), where d is the pitch diameter.

Wait, let me think. The force on each gear tooth is related to the torque. The torque is the force multiplied by the radius (d/2), but since there are multiple teeth, the total force would be considering the number of teeth. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the force per tooth and then sum them up, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating it. Let me try to find the force on each bearing. The shaft has gears equally spaced from the bearings, so the force from the gears would cause bending on the shaft. I think the force on each bearing is related to the torque and the diameter of the gear.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the force transmitted by the gear is F = (2T) / (d * sinθ), where d is the diameter of the gear. Let me plug in the numbers I have.

I have T in foot-pounds, which is 263.2 ft-lb. But I need to convert that to inch-pounds because the diameter is in inches. So 263.2 ft-lb * 12 = 3158.4 inch-lb.

So T = 3158.4 inch-lb.

Now, F = (2 * 3158.4) / (5 * sin(25°)). Let me compute that.

First, compute sin(25°). Using a calculator, sin(25) ≈ 0.4226.

So F ≈ (2 * 3158.4) / (5 * 0.4226) = (6316.8) / (2.113) ≈ 2990.5 pounds.

Wait, that's a lot of force. But the options are around 500-800 lbs. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should not convert the torque to inch-pounds. Let me try again without converting.

Wait, T is 263.2 ft-lb. Since 1 ft = 12 inches, 263.2 ft-lb = 263.2 * 12 = 3158.4 inch-lb.

So F = (2 * 3158.4) / (5 * sin(25°)).

So F ≈ 6316.8 / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 6316.8 / 2.113 ≈ 2990.5 lbs.

That's way higher than the options given. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Alternatively, the force on the bearing might be the total force from both sides, but perhaps I should consider that the shaft is supported by two bearings, so the force per bearing would be half of that total force. Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the torque is calculated differently. Let me go back. The shaft is transferring 50 hp, and the gear is 5 inches in diameter, 1000 rpm. Let me try another approach to compute the torque.

The formula for power transmitted by a shaft is P = T * ω, where P is in watts, T in Nm, and ω in rad/s. But since we're working in imperial units, let's stick to that.

Alternatively, another formula is T (in foot-pounds) = (P (hp) * 60 * 550) / (2π * N), where N is rpm.

So T = (50 * 60 * 550) / (2π * 1000) = (50 * 60 * 550) / (6283.185) ≈ (1,650,000) / 6283.185 ≈ 263.2 foot-pounds.

So that's correct. Now, torque T is 263.2 ft-lb.

Now, the gear has a diameter of 5 inches, so radius r is 2.5 inches.

The force on the gear can be found by F = T / r. But wait, that's only if the force is applied at the radius. But gears have a certain pressure angle, so maybe I need to adjust for that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is F = (2T) / (d * sinθ), where d is diameter, θ is pressure angle.

Wait, let me check that. The force on each tooth is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but considering all teeth, but perhaps the total force on the shaft is given by that.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to find another approach. The force on the bearing would be due to the bending moment caused by the gear's force. The shaft is supported by two bearings, so the moment at each bearing would be due to the force applied by the gear.

Wait, perhaps the formula is F = (1.5 * T) / (d * sinθ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ).

Wait, let me think in terms of the force. The torque on the shaft is caused by the force applied by the gear. Torque is force times radius, so T = F * r. But the radius r is d/2, so T = F * (d/2). Therefore, F = (2T) / d.

But that's without considering the pressure angle. The pressure angle affects the force because the contact is at an angle. So perhaps the actual force is F = (2T) / (d * sinθ).

Ah, that makes sense because the contact is at an angle θ, so the normal force would be F = (2T) / (d * sinθ).

So let's compute that.

T is 263.2 ft-lb, which is 263.2 * 12 = 3158.4 inch-lb.

d is 5 inches.

θ is 25 degrees, so sin(25) ≈ 0.4226.

So F = (2 * 3158.4) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ (6316.8) / (2.113) ≈ 2990.5 lbs.

Again, that's way higher than the options given, which are around 600-800 lbs. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not be converting the torque to inch-pounds. Let me try without converting.

T is 263.2 ft-lb. So F = (2 * 263.2) / (5 * sin(25°)).

But wait, that would be in ft-lb divided by inches, which doesn't make sense. Units are inconsistent. I must convert T to inch-pounds.

So T = 263.2 ft-lb * 12 = 3158.4 inch-lb.

So F = (2 * 3158.4) / (5 * 0.4226) = 6316.8 / 2.113 ≈ 2990.5 lbs.

That's still way too high. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is F = (T) / (r * sinθ), where r is the radius. Let me try that.

r = d/2 = 2.5 inches.

So F = (3158.4) / (2.5 * 0.4226) ≈ 3158.4 / 1.0565 ≈ 2990.5 lbs. Same result.

Hmm, not matching the options. Maybe I should think about the power transmitted differently. Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that relates horsepower to torque and speed correctly.

Wait, another approach: The power transmitted by the shaft is 50 hp. The formula for power is P = (T * N) / 5252, where T is torque in foot-pounds and N is rpm. So solving for T, T = (P * 5252) / N.

So T = (50 * 5252) / 1000 ≈ (262600) / 1000 ≈ 262.6 foot-pounds. That's close to what I had before, so that's correct.

Now, torque T is 262.6 ft-lb. The gear diameter is 5 inches, so the radius is 2.5 inches. The force on the gear can be found by F = T / r, but considering the pressure angle.

Wait, but the force F is at an angle θ from the radial line. So the component of F that contributes to the torque is F * sinθ. So T = F * r * sinθ.

Rearranging, F = T / (r * sinθ).

So F = (262.6 ft-lb * 12 in/ft) / (2.5 in * sin(25°)).

Wait, because torque is in ft-lb, let's convert it to inch-lb: 262.6 * 12 = 3151.2 inch-lb.

So F = 3151.2 / (2.5 * 0.4226) ≈ 3151.2 / 1.0565 ≈ 2984 lbs.

Again, same high number. But the options are much lower, so I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Another thought: the force transmitted by the gear is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but perhaps the 2 is not needed. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ). Let me try that again.

T = 3151.2 inch-lb. So F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.113 ≈ 2984 lbs.

No, same result. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach entirely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the bending moment on the shaft due to the force from the gear. The shaft is between two bearings, so the force from the gear creates a bending moment. The maximum bending stress occurs at the center, and the force on each bearing would be the reaction force.

Wait, but without knowing the length between the bearings, I can't compute the bending moment. The problem doesn't provide the distance between the bearings, so maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the force on each bearing is simply the force transmitted by the gear, divided by two since there are two bearings. But that would make F = 2984 / 2 ≈ 1492 lbs, which is still higher than the options.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the formula for the force on the shaft due to the gear.

Wait, I found a reference that says the force on the shaft can be calculated by F = (2T) / (d * sinθ), where T is torque, d is diameter, θ is pressure angle.

So using that, F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.113 ≈ 2984 lbs.

But this is still way higher than the options. Maybe I'm missing a factor, like the number of teeth or something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the torque is being shared between multiple teeth on the gear. The formula might actually involve the number of teeth (Z), so F = (2T) / (Z * d * sinθ). But the problem doesn't specify the number of teeth, so maybe it's assuming a single tooth, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the pitch diameter differently. Wait, maybe I should use the pitch diameter correctly. The pitch diameter (d) is given as 5 inches, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation. Let me double-check.

Power P = 50 hp. Speed N = 1000 rpm.

Using the formula P = (T * N) / 5252, so T = (50 * 5252) / 1000 ≈ 262.6 ft-lb. Correct.

Wait, but maybe the formula should account for the fact that the force is transmitted through the gear, and the actual force on the shaft is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula that relates horsepower to the force and speed directly.

Wait, another formula: P (hp) = (F * v) / 33000, where F is force in pounds, and v is velocity in feet per minute.

Velocity v = π * d * N / 60, where d is diameter in feet and N is rpm.

Wait, let's compute v.

d = 5 inches = 5/12 feet ≈ 0.4167 ft.

N = 1000 rpm.

v = π * 0.4167 * 1000 / 60 ≈ (3.1416 * 0.4167 * 1000) / 60 ≈ (1302.05) / 60 ≈ 21.701 ft/min.

Now, using P = (F * v) / 33000.

So 50 = (F * 21.701) / 33000 → F = (50 * 33000) / 21.701 ≈ 1,650,000 / 21.701 ≈ 76039.8 lbs.

That's way too high. So that can't be right. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (F * v) / 550, since 1 hp is 550 ft-lbf/s. But v in ft/min: so to convert to per second, divide by 60.

So P (hp) = (F (lbs) * v (ft/s)) / 550.

v (ft/s) = π * d (ft) * N (rpm) / 60.

So v = π * (5/12) * 1000 / 60 ≈ π * 0.4167 * 16.6667 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.4167 * 16.6667 ≈ let's compute:

0.4167 * 16.6667 ≈ 6.944 ft/min. Then, 3.1416 * 6.944 ≈ 21.798 ft/min. Then, v in ft/s is 21.798 / 60 ≈ 0.3633 ft/s.

Now, P = (F * 0.3633) / 550 = 50.

So F = (50 * 550) / 0.3633 ≈ 27500 / 0.3633 ≈ 75660 lbs. That's even higher, which doesn't make sense. I must be using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the torque and the angle. Maybe the force is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but perhaps I'm missing a gear ratio factor or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the force on the shaft due to the gear's torque, considering the angle.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is F = (2T) / (d * sinθ). Let me try that again.

T = 262.6 ft-lb = 3151.2 inch-lb.

d=5 inches.

sin(25°)=0.4226.

So F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.113 ≈ 2984 lbs.

But the options are much lower. So I'm either missing a key factor or using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the torque is not the same as the gear's torque. Wait, the shaft is transferring 50 hp through gears, but the gear's torque might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the torque is being transmitted through the gear, so the shaft's torque is equal to the gear's torque.

Wait, maybe I should consider the pitch diameter correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a simplified formula without considering the pressure angle, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: The force on the gear can be found using F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), and then the force on each bearing would be F, but perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the force per bearing as F, not considering any other factors.

But again, that gives 2984 lbs, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the torque calculation. Using P = T * ω, where P is in watts, T in Nm, ω in rad/s. But since we're in imperial units, maybe I should use the formula P (hp) = (T (ft-lb) * N (rpm)) / 5252.

So T = (P * 5252) / N = (50 * 5252) / 1000 ≈ 262.6 ft-lb. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the diameter in feet instead of inches. Let me try that.

d = 5 inches = 5/12 ≈ 0.4167 feet.

So F = (2 * T) / (d * sinθ) → (2 * 262.6) / (0.4167 * 0.4226) ≈ 525.2 / 0.1765 ≈ 2979 lbs. Still too high.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Oh wait, perhaps the shaft is a journal bearing, and the force is calculated using the formula F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but perhaps the problem is using the diameter in a different way or there's a factor I'm missing.

Alternatively, maybe the pressure angle affects the force inversely, so perhaps I should use cosθ instead of sinθ. Let me try that.

So F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * cos(25°)).

cos(25) ≈ 0.9063.

So F ≈ 6302.4 / (5 * 0.9063) ≈ 6302.4 / 4.5315 ≈ 1390 lbs. Still higher than the options.

Wait, but maybe the formula is F = T / (r * sinθ), where r is in inches.

So T is 3151.2 inch-lb.

r = 2.5 inches.

So F = 3151.2 / (2.5 * 0.4226) ≈ 3151.2 / 1.0565 ≈ 2984 lbs.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Maybe the formula is F = (T * 2) / (d * tanθ), because the force is along the line of action, which is at an angle θ.

Wait, that's possible. Let me try that.

tan(25°) ≈ 0.4663.

So F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4663) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.3315 ≈ 2702.5 lbs. Still too high.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I should try to find another way. Perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the force based on the gear's circumference speed or something else.

Wait, another thought: The force on the bearings would be the component of the gear's force that's radial. So perhaps F = T / (r * sinθ), but maybe I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The options are around 600-800 lbs. So perhaps the correct force is around 675 lbs or so.

Wait, perhaps the formula is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but using T in foot-pounds without converting to inches.

So T = 262.6 ft-lb.

F = (2 * 262.6) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 525.2 / 2.113 ≈ 248.5 ft-lbs. Wait, that can't be right because units don't match.

Wait, maybe I should not convert T to inch-pounds. Let me try that.

T = 262.6 ft-lb.

d = 5 inches.

So F = (2 * 262.6) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 525.2 / 2.113 ≈ 248.5. But units are ft-lb divided by inches, which is lb·ft/inch. Not correct.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different approach entirely. Perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it.

Wait, perhaps the force on each bearing is simply the torque divided by the radius. So F = T / r.

T = 262.6 ft-lb = 3151.2 inch-lb.

r = 2.5 inches.

So F = 3151.2 / 2.5 ≈ 1260.48 lbs. Still too high.

Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the force on each bearing, which would be half of the total force if there are two bearings. So 1260 / 2 ≈ 630 lbs. That's close to option C (620) or E (675). Hmm.

Alternatively, considering the pressure angle, maybe F = T / (r * sinθ).

So F = 3151.2 / (2.5 * 0.4226) ≈ 3151.2 / 1.0565 ≈ 2984 lbs. Then, divided by two, that's 1492 lbs, which isn't matching.

Wait, but perhaps the force on each bearing is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), and then divided by two because there are two bearings.

So F_per_bearing = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) / 2 ≈ 6302.4 / 2.113 / 2 ≈ 2984 / 2 ≈ 1492 lbs. Still too high.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a simpler formula. I found a reference that says the force on the shaft can be calculated as F = (2T) / (d * sinθ). So perhaps that's the way to go, and then the force per bearing is F/2.

So F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.113 ≈ 2984 lbs total. Then per bearing, it's 2984 / 2 ≈ 1492 lbs. Still way off.

Wait, but the options are around 600-800. Maybe the torque is being calculated incorrectly. Let me check the torque calculation again.

Power P = 50 hp.

Speed N = 1000 rpm.

Torque T = (P * 5252) / N = (50 * 5252) / 1000 ≈ 262.6 ft-lb. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the diameter in feet, not inches. Let me try that.

d = 5 inches = 5/12 ≈ 0.4167 feet.

So F = (2 * 262.6) / (0.4167 * 0.4226) ≈ 525.2 / 0.1765 ≈ 2976 lbs. Still too high.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but with d in inches and T in inch-pounds.

So T = 3151.2 inch-lb.

d = 5 inches.

sinθ = 0.4226.

F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.113 ≈ 2984 lbs.

Again, same result.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the diameter as the radius. Let me try that.

If d is 5 inches, radius r = 2.5 inches.

F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ same as before, 2984 lbs.

No, that doesn't help.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem is using a different formula, such as F = (T * 2) / (d * cosθ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure angle is 20 degrees instead of 25, but the problem says 25°, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but I made a calculation mistake.

Let me recalculate F.

F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) = 6302.4 / 2.113 ≈ 2984.5 lbs.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to divide this by 2 because there are two bearings, so 2984.5 / 2 ≈ 1492.25 lbs. Still too high.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the torque is being transmitted through the gear, but the force on the shaft is not the same as the gear's force. Perhaps the force on the shaft is less due to some efficiency factor, but the problem doesn't mention efficiency, so I can't assume that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula F = (T) / (r * sinθ), without the 2. Let me try that.

F = 3151.2 / (2.5 * 0.4226) ≈ 3151.2 / 1.0565 ≈ 2984 lbs. Same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Maybe the gear is on the same shaft, so the force is transmitted directly, and the bearing force is calculated differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the force due to the gear's weight, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another approach: The force on the bearing is the force exerted by the gear on the shaft. The torque is T, so F = T / r, where r is the radius. But without considering the angle, perhaps.

So F = 3151.2 / 2.5 ≈ 1260.48 lbs. Divided by two bearings, that's 630.24 lbs, which is close to option C (620) or E (675). Hmm.

But why would the pressure angle not matter in this case? Maybe I'm supposed to ignore it, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the force is F = T / (r * sinθ), so F = 3151.2 / (2.5 * 0.4226) ≈ 2984 lbs. Then, per bearing, 2984 / 2 ≈ 1492 lbs. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but using T in foot-pounds and d in inches without converting units properly.

So F = (2 * 262.6) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 525.2 / 2.113 ≈ 248.5. But that's in foot-pounds per inch, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way. Let's consider the options given. The closest to my earlier 630 lbs is option C (620) and E (675). Maybe due to rounding, the correct answer is around 675, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the actual force is less because I'm not considering the correct formula. Let me try to calculate using the formula F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but without converting torque to inch-pounds.

Wait, T is 262.6 ft-lb.

So F = (2 * 262.6) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 525.2 / 2.113 ≈ 248.5.

But that's in ft-lb per inch, which is incorrect. So that can't be right.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is F = (T * 2) / (d * tanθ), using the tangent of the pressure angle. Let's try that.

tan(25) ≈ 0.4663.

F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4663) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.3315 ≈ 2702.5 lbs. Still too high.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the closest option based on the initial approach, even though it doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation.

Wait, let me try to compute the torque again using P = T * ω.

P = 50 hp = 50 * 550 = 27500 ft-lbf/s.

ω = 1000 rpm = 1000 * 2π / 60 ≈ 104.72 rad/s.

So T = P / ω = 27500 / 104.72 ≈ 262.6 ft-lb. Correct.

Now, F = (2 * T) / (d * sinθ) = (2 * 262.6) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 525.2 / 2.113 ≈ 248.5 ft-lbf/inch. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but the units are in inch-pounds. So F would be in pounds.

So T = 262.6 ft-lb = 3151.2 inch-lb.

F = (2 * 3151.2) / (5 * 0.4226) ≈ 6302.4 / 2.113 ≈ 2984 lbs.

But again, that's way too high. Maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, like dividing by 2 because of two bearings. 2984 / 2 ≈ 1492 lbs. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Maybe the correct formula is F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ), but the problem is asking for the total force on both bearings, not per bearing. So 2984 lbs total, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula F = (T * 2) / (d * sinθ) and then dividing by the number of teeth, but without knowing the number of teeth, I can't do that.

I think I've exhausted all the approaches I can think of, and I'm not getting an answer that matches the options. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the closest calculation I have, which was around 630 lbs when I divided by two. So looking at the options, E is 675, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: 675 lbs.

To determine the force exerted on each bearing, the torque transmitted by the shaft is calculated using the formula:

\[ T = \frac{P \cdot 5252}{N} \]

where \( P = 50 \, \text{hp} \) and \( N = 1000 \, \text{rpm} \). This gives:

\[ T = \frac{50 \cdot 5252}{1000} \approx 262.6 \, \text{ft-lb} \]

Converting torque to inch-pounds:

\[ T = 262.6 \cdot 12 \approx 3151.2 \, \text{in-lb} \]

The force exerted on the shaft due to the gear is calculated using the formula:

\[ F = \frac{2T}{d \cdot \sin(\theta)} \]

where \( d = 5 \, \text{inches} \) and \( \theta = 25^\circ \). Substituting the values:

\[ F = \frac{2 \cdot 3151.2}{5 \cdot \sin(25^\circ)} \]

Using \( \sin(25^\circ) \approx 0.4226 \):

\[ F = \frac{6302.4}{2.113} \approx 2984 \, \text{lbs} \]

Since the shaft is supported by two bearings, the force on each bearing is approximately half of the total force:

\[ F_{\text{bearing}} = \frac{2984}{2} \approx 1492 \, \text{lbs} \]

However, this result is significantly higher than the provided options. Reassessing the problem, it is possible that the force per bearing is calculated directly without dividing by two, or that the formula used does not account for the same factors. Based on the closest plausible value and the options provided, the most reasonable answer is:

**E: 675 lbs**

Answer: E
