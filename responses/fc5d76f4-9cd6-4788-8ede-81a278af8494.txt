Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear fission, specifically about the form in which the energy is released when a uranium nucleus undergoes fission. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that fission is the process where a heavy nucleus, like uranium-235, splits into two or more smaller nuclei, called fission fragments. This process also releases neutrons, and of course, energy. The question is asking what form this released energy primarily takes.

I think the energy released in nuclear reactions can be in various forms, but I need to figure out which is the primary one here. Let me look at the options provided.

Option A is the energy of alpha particles. Alpha particles are helium nuclei, so I know they're charged particles. But wait, in fission, I don't think alpha particles are a major product. I mean, fission usually releases neutrons and fission fragments, but maybe some other particles too. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B is electromagnetic waves. That would be like gamma rays or X-rays. I think that's part of the energy released, but is it the primary form? I'm not too certain. I remember that in fission, a lot of energy is released in the form of kinetic energy, but some is also in the form of electromagnetic radiation.

Option C is gamma radiation. Gamma rays are high-energy photons emitted during nuclear reactions. They are definitely part of the energy release, but is that the main part? I don't think so because I remember that most of the energy goes into the kinetic energy of the products.

Option D says all of these about equally. That seems unlikely because I think each form contributes differently. The main forms are usually kinetic energy and some gamma radiation, not all equally.

Option E is potential energy. I don't think so. The energy would be more about kinetic since the nucleus is split into moving parts.

Option F is thermal energy. Thermal energy is related to heat, which is a form of energy, but I'm not sure if that's the primary form. Maybe some energy is converted into heat, but I don't think it's the majority.

Option G is the kinetic energy of fission fragments. That sounds familiar. When the nucleus splits, the two fragments move apart quickly, and their motion would be kinetic energy. I think this is a major part of the released energy. I remember from classes that most of the energy in fission goes into the kinetic energy of the fragments.

Option H is energy of created protons. Wait, protons are part of the nucleus, but in fission, you don't create new protons, you split existing ones. So I don't think this is correct.

Option I is energy of beta particles. Beta particles are electrons or positrons emitted during beta decay, which is a different process. I don't think beta particles are a primary product of fission, though some might be emitted later as the fragments stabilize.

Option J is the kinetic energy of ejected neutrons. That's definitely a part of it because when a neutron causes fission, more neutrons are released. But I think the number of neutrons is fewer compared to the fission fragments, so their kinetic energy might not be the primary form.

So putting it all together, the primary energy released is the kinetic energy of the fission fragments. Therefore, the correct answer should be option G.

When a uranium nucleus undergoes fission, the energy released is primarily in the form of the kinetic energy of the fission fragments. These fragments move rapidly after the split, carrying away most of the energy released. Other forms of energy, such as gamma radiation and the kinetic energy of ejected neutrons, contribute to the total energy but are not the primary form. 

Answer: G
