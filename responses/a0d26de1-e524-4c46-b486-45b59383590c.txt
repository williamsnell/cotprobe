Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what collusion is. I've heard the term before, but I'm not exactly sure what it entails. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to see which makes the most sense.

Option A: A business strategy to maximize profits. Hmm, that sounds too broad. Business strategies can vary widely, and while collusion might have profit motives, I don't think that's the exact definition.

Option B: A financial arrangement where investors pool their funds for a joint venture. That sounds more like a partnership or joint investment, not specifically collusion.

Option C: An economic policy that encourages competition among businesses. No, collusion is probably the opposite of encouraging competition. It's more about working together in a way that reduces competition.

Option D: A marketing technique. Marketing techniques are about promoting products, which doesn't seem related to collusion.

Option E: A partnership where two companies legally share resources and profits. This sounds like a legitimate business partnership, but collusion might involve something more underhanded or illegal.

Option F: An informal agreement between employees to improve workplace conditions. That's more about labor relations, not businesses colluding in the market.

Option G: A legal framework for merging two or more companies into a single corporate entity. Merging companies is more about mergers and acquisitions, not collusion.

Option H: A legal agreement between companies. This is close, but I think collusion is more about secret agreements that might be illegal, not just any legal agreement.

Option I: The practice whereby several firms get together and secretly agree upon how their market should be divided or what prices should be charged. This rings a bell. Collusion is when companies secretly agree to fix prices, divide markets, or otherwise act in concert to reduce competition. This seems like the correct definition.

Option J: A government policy to regulate monopolies. That's about government intervention, not collusion, which is more about private agreements between companies.

Putting it all together, Option I seems to fit the definition of collusion best. It involves secret agreements to control market behavior, which is what I remember from economics and business terms.
