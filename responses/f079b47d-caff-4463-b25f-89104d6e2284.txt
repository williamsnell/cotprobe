Question:

A purchaser orally agreed with the seller to buy seller's house for $100,000. The purchaser gave the seller a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the check served as a form of acceptance of the offer.
B: Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.
C: Yes, because the seller cannot revoke an offer once a down payment has been made.
D: No, because the oral agreement was not legally binding without the seller's signature on the offer form.
E: No, because the offer was not accepted  prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.
F: Yes, because the written offer and check constituted a legally binding contract.
G: Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.
H: No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.
I: No, because the seller had not yet cashed the check, indicating no formal acceptance of the offer.
J: No, because the post-dated check does not constitute a legally binding agreement.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real estate law, specifically dealing with contracts and specific performance. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The scenario is that a purchaser and a seller orally agreed to buy the seller's house for $100,000. Then, the purchaser gave the seller a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. Before the seller signed the offer or deposited the check, he got another offer for his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser to cancel the deal, and now the purchaser is suing for specific performance, claiming that the oral agreement, the written offer, and the check form an enforceable agreement.

I need to determine whether the purchaser will likely prevail. Let's look at the options provided and see which one fits.

First, I should recall some contract law basics. For a contract to be enforceable, there generally needs to be an offer, acceptance, consideration, and sometimes a written form if it's under the Statute of Frauds. In real estate, the Statute of Frauds requires that sales of land be in writing to be enforceable. So, an oral agreement alone might not be enough.

In this case, the initial agreement was oral. Then, the purchaser gave a written offer and a post-dated check. But the seller hadn't yet signed the offer or cashed the check. So, when did the acceptance happen?

Acceptance typically occurs when the offer is accepted in the manner specified by the offeror. Here, the written offer was presumably the offer, and the acceptance would be the seller's signature. The check is a down payment, which could be seen as part of the consideration, but if it's post-dated, it's not yet cashed. So, was there an acceptance before the seller revoked the offer?

The key issue is whether the oral agreement, along with the written offer and check, created a binding contract. The seller revoked the offer before any formal acceptance and before cashing the check.

Under the common law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance. So, if the seller revoked before the offer was accepted (i.e., before signing), then the offer was no longer open, and there was no binding contract formed. The post-dated check might not count as acceptance because it's not a clear acceptance in the form required.

So, the purchaser's argument is that the oral agreement, plus the written offer and check, formed a binding agreement. But without the seller's acceptance (signature), the written offer wasn't accepted yet. The oral agreement alone wouldn't be sufficient because real estate is under the Statute of Frauds, requiring a written agreement.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the check was acceptance. But a check isn't usually considered acceptance unless it's clearly intended as such. It's more of a deposit.

Option B suggests the oral agreement and the check as consideration. But the consideration would be the down payment, but without a written contract, the oral part might not be enforceable.

Option C says yes because the seller can't revoke once a down payment is made. But if the offer hasn't been accepted yet, revocation is allowed.

Option D says no because the oral agreement isn't binding without the seller's signature. That seems correct because real estate needs a written agreement, and the offer wasn't accepted yet.

Option E says no because the offer wasn't accepted yet, so the seller had the right to revoke. This aligns with the idea that revocation before acceptance is permissible.

Option F says yes because the written offer and check are a binding contract. But again, without acceptance (signature), the offer isn't accepted yet.

Option G says yes because there was a meeting of the minds. But without a written contract, especially in real estate, it's not enforceable.

Option H says no because specific performance doesn't apply to residential real estate. But I think specific performance is allowed in real estate cases, so this might not be correct.

Option I says no because the seller didn't cash the check, so no formal acceptance. That seems relevant because acceptance usually requires some action, like signing, not just giving a check.

Option J says no because the post-dated check isn't a legally binding agreement. That's true, but the main issue is whether the offer was accepted.

So, putting it together: The oral agreement isn't enough for real estate. The written offer wasn't accepted yet because the seller didn't sign. The check is a deposit, but doesn't constitute acceptance. Therefore, the contract wasn't formed, so the purchaser can't get specific performance.

Looking at the options, E and I seem relevant. Option E says no because the offer wasn't accepted, so the seller could revoke. I says no because the check wasn't cashed, indicating no acceptance.

But which one is correct? The key is whether the check is a form of acceptance. If the seller didn't cash it, maybe not. Also, the written offer wasn't accepted.

So, the correct answer might be E or I. But E seems to align with the idea that the offer wasn't accepted, so the seller could revoke. Alternatively, I says no because the seller didn't cash the check, implying no acceptance.

Wait, in contract law, the acceptance has to be communicated. If the offer requires a written acceptance, then the seller's act of signing would be the acceptance. Since the seller didn't sign or accept, the offer was still open until revoked. The purchaser gave the check, but that's not acceptance unless the offer specified that a check constitutes acceptance. If it's a post-dated check, it's not yet cashed, so maybe it's not acceptance.

So, the seller called and revoked before any acceptance. Therefore, the offer was revoked before acceptance, so no contract was formed. Therefore, the purchaser can't enforce specific performance.

Looking back at the options, E says "No, because the offer was not accepted — prior to acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone." That seems correct.

Alternatively, I says "No, because the seller had not yet cashed the check, indicating no formal acceptance of the offer." But the check alone might not be enough to constitute acceptance unless it's a down payment that's considered as an act of acceptance. But generally, the offer requires a signature.

I think E is the better answer because the offer wasn't accepted yet, so the seller could revoke it. The post-dated check doesn't count as acceptance unless the offer terms state so, which isn't indicated here.

The key issue in this scenario is whether a binding contract was formed between the purchaser and the seller. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. In real estate, the Statute of Frauds requires a written agreement to be enforceable. While the parties had an oral agreement, the written offer and check are crucial to determining acceptance.

The seller revoked the offer before signing the written offer or cashing the check. Under contract law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance. Acceptance typically requires an affirmative act, such as signing the offer, which did not occur here. The post-dated check, though given by the purchaser, does not constitute acceptance unless explicitly stated in the offer. Therefore, the offer was revoked before acceptance, and no binding contract was formed.

The purchaser's claim for specific performance fails because there was no enforceable agreement. The oral agreement alone is insufficient for real estate, and the written offer was not accepted. Thus, the correct answer is:

E: No, because the offer was not accepted — prior to acceptance, the seller had the right to sell to anyone.

Answer: E
