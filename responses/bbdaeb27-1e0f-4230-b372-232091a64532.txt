Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the horsepower output, torque, and efficiency of a shunt motor. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The given data is: I_l = 19.8 amperes, E_l = 230 volts, Balance reading = 12 lbs corrected for zero, Brake arm = 2 ft, Speed = 1100 r/min.

I remember that for motor performance tests, we typically use the power equation and torque equation. Let me jot down the formulas I think are relevant.

First, the power input (P_in) to the motor can be calculated using P = V * I. So, P_in = E_l * I_l. That should give me the input power in watts, which I can then convert to horsepower.

Then, the torque (T) can be found using the brake equation. The formula is T = (F * D) / 6.283, where F is the force applied on the brake, and D is the diameter of the brake drum. Wait, but the problem gives me the brake arm length, which is 2 ft. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the torque can also be calculated using the force and the lever arm. So T = F * L, where L is the lever arm length. But wait, in some contexts, especially when using a dynamometer, the torque is calculated as T = (F * D) / (2 * π), where D is the diameter. Alternatively, sometimes it's T = (F * L) where L is the length of the brake arm. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the balance reading is 12 lbs corrected for zero, and the brake arm is 2 ft. So I think the torque is calculated as T = F * L, where F is the force (12 lbs) and L is the lever arm (2 ft). So T = 12 lb * 2 ft = 24 lb-ft. That seems straightforward.

But wait, sometimes torque is calculated using the formula T = (F * D) / (2 * π), where D is the diameter of the brake drum. But I don't have D here. Alternatively, maybe the 12 lbs is the force applied, and the 2 ft is the arm, so torque is 12 * 2 = 24 lb-ft. That seems right.

Next, the speed is given as 1100 r/min. To find the power output (P_out), I can use the formula P = T * ω, where ω is the angular velocity in radians per second. To convert rpm to rad/s: ω = (π * 1100) / 30 ≈ 115.2 rad/s.

So P_out = 24 lb-ft * 115.2 rad/s. Wait, but units need to be consistent. Let me double-check the units. Torque in lb-ft and angular velocity in rad/s gives power in horsepower? Or maybe I should convert to watts first.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for power in horsepower: P = (T * speed) / 5252. Because 5252 is the conversion factor from lb-ft * rpm to horsepower.

Using that formula, P_out = (24 lb-ft * 1100 rpm) / 5252. Let me calculate that.

24 * 1100 = 26,400. Divided by 5252: 26,400 / 5252 ≈ 5.029 hp. So approximately 5.03 hp.

Now, the input power P_in is E_l * I_l. E_l is 230 volts, I_l is 19.8 amps. So P_in = 230 * 19.8 = let's calculate that.

230 * 20 = 4600, minus 230*0.2=46, so 4600 - 46 = 4554 watts. To convert watts to horsepower, since 1 hp ≈ 745.7 watts, P_in = 4554 / 745.7 ≈ 6.105 hp.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if P_in is about 6.1 hp and P_out is about 5.03 hp, then efficiency would be (5.03 / 6.105) * 100 ≈ 82.4%.

Looking at the options, let's check the torque first. I calculated 24 lb-ft, which matches options A, E, I, J. Then power output is about 5.03 hp, which is in options B, E, I.

Wait, let me recalculate the input power. 230 V * 19.8 A = 230 * 19.8. Let me compute that accurately: 200 * 19.8 = 3960, 30 * 19.8=594. So total is 3960 + 594 = 4554 watts, which is correct. 4554 / 745.7 ≈ 6.105 hp.

So efficiency is (5.03 / 6.105) * 100 ≈ 82.4%. That matches options A, E, I, J with 82.4%.

Looking at the options:

A: 6.03 hp, 24 lb. ft., 82.4% → P_in is 6.03, P_out 5.03, which would make efficiency 5.03/6.03 ≈ 83.4%, but I got 82.4%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in P_in. Let me recheck. 230 * 19.8 is indeed 4554 W, which is 4554 / 745.7 ≈ 6.105 hp. So P_out is 5.03 hp. So efficiency is 5.03 / 6.105 ≈ 82.4%.

Looking back, option E is 5.03 hp, 24 lb. ft., 80.4% → no, efficiency is 80.4% which doesn't match.

Option I: 5.03 hp, 24 lb. ft., 82.4% → yes, that matches.

Wait, but option I is present. Let me check all options:

Option I: 5.03 hp, 24 lb. ft., 82.4% → yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking back, the torque I calculated is 24 lb-ft, which matches options A, E, I, J. Then P_out is 5.03, which matches options B, E, I, and F. Efficiency is 82.4%, which is options A, I, and J.

So the correct option is I: 5.03 hp, 24 lb. ft., 82.4%.

The calculations yield a torque of 24 lb-ft, an output power of approximately 5.03 hp, and an efficiency of 82.4%. Among the options, the correct one is I.
