Okay, so I've got this problem here about property taxes in Centerville. Let me read it again and figure out what I need to do. Alright, the tax rate is 11 and a half percent, which is 11.5%. A property was taxed $1,794, and the assessment rate is 30%. I need to find the expected market value of the property.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. So, I remember that tax is usually calculated based on the assessed value of the property. The assessed value is based on the market value, adjusted by the assessment rate. Oh wait, right, the tax is calculated on the assessed value, not the market value. So, the formula I think is Tax = Assessed Value * (tax rate). And the assessed value is Market Value multiplied by the assessment rate.

Wait, so putting it together: Tax = (Market Value * Assessment Rate) * Tax Rate. So, the formula would be: Tax = Market Value * (Assessment Rate) * (Tax Rate). Oh wait, no, actually, the tax rate is applied to the assessed value, which is Market Value multiplied by the assessment rate. So the equation is Tax = (Market Value * Assessment Rate) * Tax Rate. So, rearranged to solve for Market Value, it's Market Value = Tax / [(Assessment Rate * Tax Rate)].

Wait, let me double-check that. The tax is (Market Value * Assessment Rate) * Tax Rate. So, yes, solving for Market Value: Market Value = Tax / (Assessment Rate * Tax Rate). Or, alternatively, Market Value = Tax / (AssessRate * TaxRate). That makes sense.

So, plugging in the numbers: Tax is $1,794. Assessment rate is 30%, which is 0.3. Tax rate is 11.5%, which is 0.115.

So, Market Value = 1794 / (0.3 * 0.115). Let me compute that.

First, calculate 0.3 * 0.115. 0.3 * 0.1 is 0.03, 0.3 * 0.015 is 0.0045. So adding those gives 0.0345. So, 1794 divided by 0.0345.

Hmm, let me do that division. 1794 ÷ 0.0345. Let me think about how to compute that. Maybe I can think of it as 1794 * (1/0.0345). Alternatively, approximate it.

Alternatively, let me compute 1794 ÷ 0.0345. Let me do it step by step.

First, 0.0345 is approximately 0.035. So 1794 ÷ 0.035. Let me compute that.

0.035 * 52000 = 1820, which is a bit higher than 1794. Let me try 52000 * 0.035 = 1820. So 1820 - 1794 = 26. So 52000 - (26/0.035) — wait, that's probably not the right way. Alternatively, 1794 = 0.0345 * Market Value.

So, Market Value = 1794 / 0.0345.

Let me compute that division. 0.0345 is the same as 345e-5. So 1794 divided by 345e-3. Wait, no, 0.0345 is 3.45e-2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write it as:

1794 ÷ 0.0345 = (1794 × 1000) ÷ 3.45 = 1,794,000 ÷ 3.45.

Hmm, 3.45 goes into 1,794,000 how many times? Let me see.

Alternatively, approximate 1,794,000 ÷ 3.45. Let me divide both numerator and denominator by 1.5 to make it easier. Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should do 3.45 × 52,000 = ?

3.45 * 52000: let's compute that. 52,000 * 3 = 156,000. 52,000 * 0.45 = 23,400. So total is 156,000 +23,400=179,400. Oh wait, but we have 1,794,000 as the numerator. Hmm, that's 10 times larger. So 3.45 * 52,000 * 10 = 3.45 * 520,000 = 179,400 * 10 = 1,794,000. So that would be 520,000 / 0.0345 is 520,000 * (1 / 0.0345) = 520,000 * 29.23 (since 1/0.0345 is approximately 29.23). So 520,000 * 29.23 ≈ 520,000 * 29.23 = let me compute that.

Wait, 520,000 * 29.23 = 520,000 * 29 + 520,000 * 0.23.

520,000 *29 = 15,080,000.

520,000 *0.23= 115,600.

Total: 15,080,000 + 115,600 = 15,195,600. But wait, our numerator is 1,794,000, which is less than 15,195,600. Oh wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think:

We have: 0.0345 × Market Value = 1,794.

So, Market Value = 1,794 / 0.0345.

Let me compute 1,794 ÷ 0.0345.

Well, 0.0345 is 3.45e-2. So 1,794 ÷ 3.45e-2 = 1,794 / 0.0345.

Let me compute 1,794 ÷ 0.0345.

Another way: 0.0345 is 345/10,000. So 1,794 ÷ (345/10,000) = 1,794 * (10,000/345 ) = (1,794 *10,000 ) /345.

Compute 1,794 *10,000 = 17,940,000.

Divide by 345: 17,940,000 / 345.

Let's compute that. Let's see how many times 345 goes into 17,940,000.

Well, 345 * 52,000 = 345 *50,000 = 17,250,000. Then 345*2000=690,000. So 345*52,000=17,940,000. So 17,940,000 ÷345=52,000.

So, Market Value is 52,000.

Looking at the options, option I is $52,000. So the answer should be option I, which is 52,000.

The tax rate is 11.5%, and the assessed value is determined by the market value multiplied by the assessment rate of 30%. The formula to find the market value is:

Market Value = Tax / (Assessment Rate × Tax Rate)

Plugging in the values:

Market Value = $1,794 / (0.3 × 0.115)  
Market Value = $1,794 / 0.0345  
Market Value = $52,000  

Thus, the expected market value of the property is $52,000.
