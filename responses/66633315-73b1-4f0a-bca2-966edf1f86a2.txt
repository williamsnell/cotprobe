Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about induction motors, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding each part of the question and then see which option fits all the answers.

The question has four parts: (a), (b), (c), and (d). I'll tackle each one individually and then check the options to see which set of answers matches all four.

Starting with part (a): Calculate the synchronous speed of an eight-pole induction motor with a 60-cycle supply. I remember that the synchronous speed formula is Ns = (120 * f) / p, where f is the frequency and p is the number of poles. So plugging in the numbers, f is 60 cycles, p is 8. 

Ns = (120 * 60) / 8. Let's compute that. 120 * 60 is 7200. Divided by 8, that's 900 RPM. So part (a) answer is 900.

Next, part (b): Synchronous speed of a four-pole motor with 60 cycles. Using the same formula, Ns = (120 * 60) / 4. 120*60 is 7200, divided by 4 is 1800 RPM. So part (b) is 1800.

Moving on to part (c): The rotor speed of a six-pole, 50-cycle motor is 960 rpm. I need to find the percent slip. Slip (s) is given by the formula s = (Ns - Nr) / Ns * 100%. First, calculate Ns. 

Ns = (120 * 50) / 6. 120*50 is 6000, divided by 6 is 1000 RPM. The rotor speed (Nr) is 960. So s = (1000 - 960)/1000 * 100% = (40)/1000 *100 = 4%. So part (c) is 4%.

Now part (d): Speed of a 60-cycle, 14-pole motor with slip s=0.05. Slip is given, so we can find the rotor speed. The formula is Nr = Ns * (1 - s). First, compute Ns: (120*60)/14. 120*60=7200, divided by 14. Let me do that division. 7200 /14 is approximately 514.2857 RPM. Now, slip is 0.05, so Nr = 514.2857 * (1 - 0.05) = 514.2857 * 0.95. Let me calculate that: 514.2857 * 0.95. 

Hmm, 500 * 0.95 is 475, and 14.2857 *0.95 is about 13.57. So total is approximately 475 +13.57=488.57 RPM. So around 488.57, which we can approximate as 489. Looking at the options, the closest is 488 or 480. Let me check the options.

Looking back at the options, each option has four numbers. Let's see which option has 900, 1800, 4, and around 488.

Option H: 900, 1800, 4, 488. That matches all four parts. So the correct option is H.

The correct answer is H, as it satisfies all four parts of the question with the calculated values.

Answer: H
