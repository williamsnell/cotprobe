Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about Carruthers' view on our duties to animals. I'm not super familiar with Carruthers' work, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking what Carruthers says about our duties to animals. The options are A through J, each describing different characteristics. I remember that Carruthers is a philosopher who writes about ethics, particularly animal ethics. From what I recall, he's discussed the nature of duties we have towards animals.

I think I've heard that he argues against some of the more radical positions, like those who say we have absolute duties to animals. Instead, he might suggest that our duties are more conditional. So, if that's the case, then the duties aren't absolute but depend on certain conditions.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: conditional and complex. That sounds plausible because if duties are conditional, they depend on circumstances. Also, 'complex' might mean they involve various factors, not just one simple rule.

B: absolute and fundamental. This would mean our duties are always binding, no matter what. I don't think Carruthers supports this because he's more moderate.

C: direct and secondary. Direct duties are those owed to the animals themselves, not as a means to another end. Secondary might mean they're not the main focus, but I'm not sure.

D: negotiable and fluctuating. That seems too vague and doesn't fit with what I remember about Carruthers' structured approach.

E: indirect but fundamental. Indirect would mean our duties are because of something else, like human interests, which doesn't fit if he believes in direct duties.

F: direct and basic. This suggests the duties are primary and straightforward, but I think Carruthers adds more complexity, like conditions.

G: perfect (rather than imperfect). Perfect duties are clear and overriding, which might not capture the conditional aspect.

H: primary but not imperative. Primary means important, but not imperative (not necessarily followed) â€“ not sure if this matches.

I: indirect and derivative. Again, if duties are indirect, they're based on other things, which doesn't align with direct duties.

J: nonexistent. Definitely not; Carruthers does believe we have duties to animals.

So, considering all this, option A seems the best fit because it suggests that our duties are conditional and complex, which aligns with Carruthers' moderate and nuanced view.

According to Carruthers, our duties to animals are best described as conditional and complex, reflecting a nuanced and moderate approach rather than absolute or direct duties.
