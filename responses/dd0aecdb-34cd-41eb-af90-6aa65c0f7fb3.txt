Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the heat of reaction for the combustion of methane. Hmm, I remember that the heat of reaction is calculated using the heats of formation of the reactants and products. The formula is ΔH reaction equals the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus the sum of the reactants. Right?

The reaction given is the combustion of methane, which I think is CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l). Wait, actually, the problem provides some heats of formation, so I need to make sure I use those correctly.

Looking at the data provided:

- C(s) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g), ΔHf = 18,240 cal/g mol. Oh, wait, that's the heat of formation of methane. So the ΔHf for CH4 is 18,240 cal/g mol. But wait, if it's a formation reaction, that means it's the formation from elements in their standard states. So the ΔHf for CH4 is indeed 18,240 cal/g mol.

Wait, but I think that's actually the value for the formation of CH4, so when I use it in the reaction, I'll have to consider whether it's multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficient.

Then, the heat of formation for CO2(g) is 94,450 cal/g mol. That's the ΔHf for CO2. Since carbon dioxide is a product, I'll add that.

And for water, the heat of formation is 68,370 cal/g mol, but that's for 2 H2O(l). Wait, no, let me check. The reaction given is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O(l), ΔHf = 68,370 cal/g mol. So that's the heat of formation for 2 moles of H2O. So per mole, it would be 68,370 / 2 = 34,185 cal/g mol. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the reaction as written.

Wait, no, the standard heats of formation are per mole of the substance. So for H2O(l), the ΔHf is 68,370 cal/g mol when forming two moles. So per mole, it's half of that, which is 34,185 cal/g mol. Alternatively, I can just use 68,370 cal/g mol for 2 moles in the reaction.

But to clarify, the standard heats of formation are given, so I should use them as is. Let me write down all the relevant data:

- CH4(g): ΔHf = 18,240 cal/g mol
- CO2(g): ΔHf = 94,450 cal/g mol
- H2O(l): ΔHf = 68,370 cal/g mol (for 2 moles, but I think it's per mole, so 34,185 per mole. Wait, no, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O(l) with ΔHf = 68,370. So for 2 moles of H2O, it's 68,370 cal/g mol. So per mole, it's 34,185 cal/g mol.

Wait, no, wait a second. The heat of formation is per mole of the product. So for the reaction 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O(l), the ΔHf is 68,370 cal/g mol for 2 moles of H2O. So each mole of H2O would have a ΔHf of 68,370 / 2 = 34,185 cal/g mol. But since the standard heat of formation is per mole, that's correct.

Wait, but when looking up standard heats of formation, they're usually given per mole. So perhaps the data here is for 2 moles. Wait, the problem gives it as 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O(l), ΔHf = 68,370 cal/g mol. So for 2 moles of H2O, the ΔHf is 68,370. So each mole is 34,185 cal/g mol.

But wait, actually, in the standard notation, the heats of formation are per mole of the compound formed. So for H2O, the standard ΔHf is -68,370 cal/g mol (if it's exothermic), but I need to check the sign.

Wait, no, the problem states the heats of formation as given. So for each reaction, the ΔHf is the value provided. So for the formation of CH4, it's 18,240. For CO2, it's 94,450. For 2 H2O, it's 68,370.

Wait, but in the combustion reaction, we have 1 mole of CH4, 2 moles of O2 (but O2 is an element in its standard state, so ΔHf is zero), 1 mole of CO2, and 2 moles of H2O.

Wait, so the reaction is: CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l).

So to calculate ΔH reaction, I need to sum the ΔHf of the products and subtract the sum of the ΔHf of the reactants.

So for the products: CO2(g) has ΔHf = 94,450 cal/g mol, and 2 moles of H2O(l) have ΔHf = 68,370 cal/g mol (because the reaction is 2 H2O, so that's 68,370 cal total).

So sum of products: 94,450 + 68,370 = 162,820 cal/g mol.

Reactants: CH4(g) has ΔHf = 18,240 cal/g mol. O2 is in standard state, so ΔHf = 0.

So sum of reactants: 18,240 + 0 = 18,240 cal/g mol.

Thus, ΔH reaction = sum(products) - sum(reactants) = 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal/g mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the ΔHf for CH4 is given as 18,240, which is the formation from elements. So when CH4 is a reactant, its ΔHf is subtracted. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The data given for H2O is for 2 H2O, so 68,370 cal/g mol. So 2 moles of H2O contribute 68,370. So when I sum the products, it's 94,450 (CO2) + 68,370 (2 H2O) = 162,820.

Then subtract the reactants: 18,240 (CH4) + 0 (O2) = 18,240.

So 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal/g mol.

Looking at the options, D is 144,580. So the answer should be D.

The heat of reaction for the combustion of methane is calculated using the heats of formation of the reactants and products. The reaction is:

CH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(l)

Using the given heats of formation:
- ΔHf for CH₄(g) = 18,240 cal/g mol
- ΔHf for CO₂(g) = 94,450 cal/g mol
- ΔHf for 2 H₂O(l) = 68,370 cal/g mol

The sum of the heats of formation of the products is:
ΔH_products = 94,450 (CO₂) + 68,370 (2 H₂O) = 162,820 cal/g mol

The sum of the heats of formation of the reactants is:
ΔH_reactants = 18,240 (CH₄) + 0 (O₂) = 18,240 cal/g mol

The heat of reaction is:
ΔH_reaction = ΔH_products - ΔH_reactants = 162,820 - 18,240 = 144,580 cal/g mol

The correct answer is:

D: 144,580 cal/g mol CH₄
