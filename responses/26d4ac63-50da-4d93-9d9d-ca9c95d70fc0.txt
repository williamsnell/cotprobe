Question:

Hydrangea flowers have one gene for flower color. Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?

Options:

A: The flower color is a result of genetic drift within the population.
B: In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.
C: The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.
D: The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.
E: The flower color is a result of multiple alleles interacting.
F: The flower color is a result of the plant's age.
G: The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.
H: The flower color is determined by the type of pollinators in the area.
I: The flower color is determined by the amount of sunlight the plant receives.
J: The flower color changes due to genetic mutation over time.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about hydrangea flowers and their color. The question states that hydrangeas have one gene for flower color, but plants of the same variety can have flowers ranging from blue to pink. The color varies depending on the type of soil they're grown in. I need to pick the best explanation from the given options.

First, let me break down what's being said. Hydrangeas have one gene that determines flower color, but the expression of that gene leads to different colors based on the soil. So it's not about different genotypes because they're the same genetic variety. It's the environment—soil type—that affects the color. Hmm, so this sounds like an example of phenotypic plasticity, where the environment influences the expression of a trait.

Looking at the options:

A: Genetic drift. That's about random changes in allele frequencies, not about environmental effects. So probably not A.

B: Environment alters trait expression. That fits because soil pH affects the availability of certain minerals, like aluminum, which in turn affects flower color. So B seems relevant.

C: Polygenic inheritance. No, because it's just one gene mentioned.

D: Codominant alleles depending on environment. Not sure, but codominance is when both alleles are expressed, regardless of environment. The soil's effect here is more about modifying the expression, not codominance.

E: Multiple alleles interacting. Again, only one gene is involved, so E might not be right.

F: Plant's age. The question doesn't mention age affecting color, so F is probably not it.

G: Incomplete dominance. That's a blending of traits, but again, the variation is due to environment, not blending of alleles.

H: Pollinators. I don't think pollinators determine color in this case; it's about soil.

I: Sunlight. Maybe, but the question specifies soil type, not sunlight. So I is possible, but B is more direct.

J: Genetic mutations. No, mutations are changes in the DNA, but the plants are same variety, so it's not mutation over time.

So between B and I. The question says soil type, not sunlight. So soil pH affects the availability of certain elements. For hydrangeas, the pH determines if the aluminum in the soil is available for uptake. High pH (alkaline) leads to pink flowers, low pH (acidic) leads to blue. So the environment (soil) is altering the expression of the flower color gene.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.

The phenomenon described involves hydrangea flower color varying due to soil type, which affects the environment in which the plant grows. This is best explained by the environment altering the expression of the flower color trait.

Answer: B
