Question:

The following amino acids are all essential components of the diet:


Options:

A: leucine, methionine and threonine
B: leucine, cysteine and glycine
C: proline, tyrosine and serine
D: valine, glycine and arginine
E: methionine, serine and tyrosine
F: isoleucine, alanine and glycine
G: lysine, tyrosine and cysteine
H: aspartate, valine and threonine
I: phenylalanine, arginine and isoleucine
J: lysine, proline and arginine

Answer:

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which option correctly lists essential amino acids that are all essential components of the diet. I remember that essential amino acids are those that the body can't synthesize on its own, so they must come from food. There are 9 essential amino acids in total for humans: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. I think sometimes people don't count histidine as essential because the body can make a small amount, but I'm not sure about that. I'll go with the standard 9 for this question.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that has three essential amino acids. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: leucine, methionine, threonine. All three are definitely essential. So this could be a correct answer.

Option B: leucine, cysteine, glycine. Cysteine is actually a non-essential amino acid because the body can make it from methionine. Glycine is also non-essential. So B is out.

Option C: proline, tyrosine, serine. Proline is non-essential, as is serine. Tyrosine is considered conditionally essential but not always, so I think C isn't right.

Option D: valine, glycine, arginine. Valine is essential, but glycine and arginine are non-essential. So D is incorrect.

Option E: methionine, serine, tyrosine. Methionine is essential, but serine and tyrosine are non-essential. So E is out.

Option F: isoleucine, alanine, glycine. Isoleucine is essential, but alanine and glycine are not. So F isn't the answer.

Option G: lysine, tyrosine, cysteine. Lysine is essential, but tyrosine and cysteine are non-essential. So G is incorrect.

Option H: aspartate, valine, threonine. Aspartate is non-essential, so H is wrong.

Option I: phenylalanine, arginine, isoleucine. Phenylalanine and isoleucine are essential, but arginine is non-essential. So I is partially correct but not all three.

Option J: lysine, proline, arginine. Lysine is essential, but proline and arginine are not. So J is out.

Wait, but in option I, arginine is non-essential, so only two are essential. So the correct answer must be option A because all three are essential.

The correct answer is **A** because leucine, methionine, and threonine are all essential amino acids that must be obtained through the diet. 

Answer: A
