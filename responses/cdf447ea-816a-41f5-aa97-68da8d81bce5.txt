Okay, so I have this question about Gigabit Ethernet LANs and how noise affects the number of frames destroyed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says the average frame size is 1000 bytes. I know that in networking, frames are the data packets sent over the network. Gigabit Ethernet is fast, so I'm guessing the data rate is 1 Gbps. Wait, what's the exact speed? I think Gigabit is 1,000,000,000 bits per second, right? Yeah, because 1 Gbps is 1e9 bits/s.

Next, the noise duration is 2 milliseconds. I need to find out how many frames are destroyed during this noise. So, the idea is that during the 2ms of noise, the network can't send data, so any frames that would have been sent during that time are lost or destroyed.

Wait, but how do I calculate the number of frames? I think I need to find out how much data is being transmitted in a second, then see how much is lost in 2ms.

So, let's start with the data rate. 1 Gbps is 1,000,000,000 bits per second. To make it easier, maybe convert that to bytes because the frame size is in bytes. Since 1 byte is 8 bits, the data rate in bytes per second is 1e9 / 8 = 125,000,000 bytes/s. So that's 125 MB/s.

Now, the noise is 2 milliseconds. Oh wait, I need to convert that to seconds. 2 milliseconds is 0.002 seconds. So the amount of data that could have been sent during 2ms is the data rate multiplied by time. That would be 125,000,000 bytes/s * 0.002 s = 250,000 bytes. So 250 KB.

But wait, the average frame size is 1000 bytes. So how many frames would that be? If each frame is 1000 bytes, then the number of frames destroyed is total bytes lost divided by frame size. So 250,000 bytes / 1000 bytes/frame = 250 frames.

Looking at the options, J is 250. So the answer should be J.

The number of frames destroyed is calculated by determining the data rate in bytes per second, multiplying by the noise duration, and dividing by the frame size. This results in 250 frames destroyed.

Answer: J
