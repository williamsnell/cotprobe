Question:

How can the public debt exert an inflationary pressure on the economy?

Options:

A: Public debt increases the value of the currency, leading to deflationary pressure.
B: Public debt leads to higher interest rates, which decrease investment and spending.
C: Public debt can exert inflationary pressure by increasing consumption spending and representing a backlog in buying power that may be converted at inconvenient times.
D: Public debt reduces consumption spending.
E: Public debt is typically cancelled out by equivalent levels of private debt, neutralizing inflationary effects.
F: Public debt leads to a decrease in government spending.
G: Public debt reduces the money supply, causing deflation.
H: Public debt is directly converted into foreign aid, decreasing domestic money circulation.
I: Public debt causes an automatic increase in taxation, reducing disposable income.
J: Public debt encourages savings over consumption, leading to lower inflation.

Okay, so I have this question about how public debt can exert an inflationary pressure on the economy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that public debt refers to the money a government owes, usually to other countries or institutions. Now, inflationary pressure is when there's too much money chasing too few goods, leading to higher prices. So how does public debt cause that?

Looking at the options:

Option A says public debt increases the value of the currency, leading to deflation. Wait, higher currency value usually means imports are cheaper, which can cause deflation, not inflation. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Public debt leads to higher interest rates, decreasing investment. Higher interest rates can slow down investment, which might reduce economic activity, possibly leading to lower inflation or even deflation. So B doesn't seem to explain inflationary pressure.

Option C: Public debt increases consumption spending and represents a backlog that may be converted at inconvenient times. Hmm, if the government is spending more because of debt, that could increase demand. If they borrow and spend, it's like injecting more money into the economy. If this exceeds the economy's capacity, it can cause inflation. So C sounds plausible.

Option D says public debt reduces consumption spending. That doesn't make sense because if the government is spending more (like through debt), it would likely increase consumption, not reduce it. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Public debt is canceled out by private debt. I'm not sure about this. Maybe if private debt increases, it could offset, but I don't think it necessarily neutralizes inflation. It might depend on how each debt affects the economy. So E might not be the best choice.

Option F: Public debt leads to decreased government spending. Wait, if the government is in debt, they might cut spending, which would reduce demand, leading to deflation, not inflation. So F doesn't seem right.

Option G: Public debt reduces money supply, causing deflation. No, public debt usually increases the money supply when the government borrows and spends. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Public debt is converted into foreign aid, reducing domestic money. If the government sends money abroad, that could reduce the domestic money supply, leading to deflation. So H doesn't explain inflation.

Option I: Public debt causes higher taxes, reducing disposable income. Higher taxes would likely reduce spending, leading to lower inflation or even deflation. So I is not the answer.

Option J: Public debt encourages savings over consumption. More savings would mean less spending, which would decrease inflation. So J is not correct.

Putting it all together, the best option seems to be C. When the government takes on public debt, it might increase spending, which can boost consumption. If this spending is excessive or not matched by production, it can create inflationary pressure. Also, if there's a backlog in buying power, people might spend more when prices are higher, exacerbating inflation.

The correct answer is C. Public debt can lead to increased government spending, which boosts consumption and may cause inflation if demand outpaces supply. Additionally, deferred spending could contribute to inflation when prices rise.

Answer: C
