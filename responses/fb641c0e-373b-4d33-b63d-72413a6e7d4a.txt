Okay, so I've got this question about choosing the right measure of general cognitive abilities for a nonverbal adolescent. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the question is asking about a nonverbal adolescent. That means the test should be suitable for someone who might not have strong verbal skills, maybe someone who's not as comfortable with language-based tests. So the test should rely more on nonverbal components or be adaptable for nonverbal communication.

Looking at the options, I need to think about each test. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–IV (WISC-IV). I know this is a widely used test for children. It has verbal and nonverbal components, like the Processing Speed and Visual Spatial Indexes. But is it the most appropriate? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit because it still has verbal parts, which might be a barrier for a nonverbal adolescent.

Option B: Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children–II (KABC-II). This one focuses more on cognitive abilities without heavy reliance on verbal skills. It uses a problem-solving approach, which might be good for nonverbal kids. It includes tasks like following directions and reasoning, which could be better suited. But I'm not entirely sure if it's the best option.

Option C: Cognitive Assessment System–II (CAS-II). The CAS is known for assessing cognitive abilities through problem-solving tasks. It has four main areas: verbal reasoning, nonverbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and short-term memory. Since it includes nonverbal reasoning, this could be a strong candidate. But does it work well for adolescents? I think it's designed for ages 7 to 21, so yes, adolescents are included.

Option D: Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ IV). This test has a lot of subtests and can be flexible. It includes both verbal and nonverbal measures, like the Nonverbal Reasoning Battery. It's comprehensive, but is it the most appropriate? Maybe, but it's quite extensive and might not be the most streamlined choice for a nonverbal focus.

Option E: Differential Ability Scales–II (DAS–II). This test is designed to assess cognitive abilities with an emphasis on nonverbal and verbal components. It's suitable for a wide age range, including adolescents. The Nonverbal Problem Solving section might be particularly useful here. It's a good option, but I'm not certain if it's the best.

Option F: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence–IV (WPPSI-IV). This is for younger children, up to age 7. So it's not suitable for adolescents, who are older. So I can probably rule this one out.

Option G: Ravens Progressive Matrices. Oh, I remember this one. It's a nonverbal test that assesses abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills. It's been around for a long time and is often used for its nonverbal nature, which would make it very appropriate for a nonverbal adolescent. It doesn't rely on language, so that's a big plus.

Option H: Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales–5. This is a classic test that includes verbal and nonverbal components. The latest edition has a more adaptive approach, but again, it still has verbal parts which might be challenging. However, it's comprehensive and reliable.

Option I: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–IV (WAIS-IV). This is for adults, so unless the adolescent is very mature, it might not be the best fit. Plus, it's more verbally oriented, which could be a problem.

Option J: Leiter–R. The Leiter International Performance Scale Revised is a nonverbal test that assesses cognitive abilities through performance-based tasks. It's designed for individuals from 2 to 85+ years old and doesn't rely on language, making it suitable for nonverbal individuals. That sounds like a strong contender.

So, considering all this, the best options seem to be G (Raven's PM), J (Leiter-R), and maybe C or E. 

Raven's PM is quick and nonverbal but might be more of a specific test of reasoning rather than a comprehensive cognitive assessment. The Leiter-R is comprehensive and nonverbal, designed for a wide age range, including adolescents. The Cognitive Assessment System (CAS-II) includes nonverbal reasoning but still has verbal components. 

Wait, the question specifies the "most appropriate for use with a nonverbal adolescent." So the test should be nonverbal. So between G, J, and maybe E or B.

KABC-II (Option B) is another good option because it's less verbally dependent. It's structured around cognitive processes like simultaneous and successive processing. But it might still have some verbal elements, though perhaps less than WISC.

Leiter-R (Option J) is entirely nonverbal and covers a broad range of cognitive abilities without relying on language. It's specifically designed for individuals who may have difficulties with verbal communication, which fits the scenario perfectly.

So, putting it all together, the best options are likely J (Leiter-R) because it's nonverbal and comprehensive, or G (Raven's) if a more specific reasoning test is needed. However, since the question asks for a measure of general cognitive abilities, Leiter-R would be more appropriate as it assesses a broader range of abilities without verbal demands.

The most appropriate measure for a nonverbal adolescent would be the Leiter–R (Option J), as it is a nonverbal test designed to assess general cognitive abilities through performance-based tasks, making it suitable for individuals with limited verbal skills.
