Okay, so I have this problem about markup percentages in two departments of a store, and I need to find the average markup on sales for both departments. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that markup is the amount added to the cost of a product to set its selling price. But wait, in this case, the problem gives the markup percentages, which I think are based on the cost. But wait, sometimes markup can be expressed as a percentage of sales or cost. Oh right, markup on cost means that the percentage is based on the cost price. So if the markup is 30%, that means the selling price is 130% of the cost.

But wait, the question is about the average markup on sales. Oh, right, markup can also be expressed as a percentage of the selling price, which is markup on sales. So I need to compute the average markup on sales for both departments combined.

Let me think. To find the average markup on sales, I can't just take the average of 30% and 25% because that would be a simple average, but I think I need a weighted average based on their sales.

So, for each department, I need to calculate the total markup in dollars and then find the total markup across both departments. Then divide that by the total sales to get the average markup percentage.

Wait, let me clarify. Markup on cost is (Selling Price - Cost)/Cost * 100%. Markup on sales is (Selling Price - Cost)/Selling Price * 100%. So the problem mentions that the markup is 30% in the radio department and 25% in the tube department. But it's not clear whether these are markup on cost or markup on sales. Oh, wait, the question specifically says "markup on sales," so I think those percentages are already the markup on sales. Wait no, the question says "the markup in the radio department is 30%." Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: "The markup in the radio department of the R.L. Electronics store is 30%. Its sales for this past month were $15,000. The markup in the tube department is 25% and its sales for the month were $40,000. Find the average markup on sales for the two departments."

Oh, so the markup percentages are given, but I'm not sure if they're markup on cost or on sales. Wait, the way it's phrased, "markup in the department is 30%", that usually refers to markup on cost. Because markup is typically calculated based on cost. But let me think again because the question is asking for the average markup on sales. So perhaps I need to compute the markup on sales for each department and then average them.

Wait, no. Maybe the given markup percentages are already markup on cost, and I need to find the markup on sales for each department and then compute the average based on sales.

Let me clarify this. Suppose a department has a markup of 30% on cost. So Selling Price = Cost + 30% of Cost = 1.3 * Cost. Therefore, the markup on sales would be (Markup / Selling Price) * 100% = (0.3 Cost) / (1.3 Cost) = 3/13 ≈ 23.08%.

Wait, so if the markup on cost is 30%, the markup on sales is about 23.08%. Similarly, if the markup on cost is 25%, then the markup on sales would be 25/(100+25) = 25/125 = 0.2, which is 20%.

Wait, but if the problem states that the markup is 30% and 25%, and the question is about markup on sales, perhaps the given 30% and 25% are markup on cost, and I need to find the markup on sales for each, then compute the weighted average based on their sales.

Alternatively, if the given 30% and 25% are already markup on sales, then the average would be (30 + 25)/2 = 27.5%, which is option C. But that seems too straightforward, and the options include 27.5% as option C. But I'm not sure if that's correct because markup is usually on cost, not on sales.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this methodically.

First, let's define:

Markup on cost (MCo) = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost * 100%

Markup on sales (MSo) = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price * 100%

Given that, if a department has a markup of 30% on cost, then:

Selling Price (SP) = Cost + 30% of Cost = 1.3 * Cost

Then, MSo = (0.3 * Cost) / (1.3 * Cost) = 0.3 / 1.3 ≈ 0.2308 or 23.08%

Similarly, for a 25% markup on cost:

SP = 1.25 * Cost

MSo = (0.25 * Cost) / (1.25 * Cost) = 0.25 / 1.25 = 0.2 or 20%

But wait, the problem says the markup is 30% and 25%. So perhaps the markup is already on sales. Let me see.

If the markup is on sales, then:

MSo = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price * 100% = given percentage.

So, for the radio department, MSo =30%, which means:

( SP - C ) / SP = 0.3 → SP - C = 0.3 SP → C = SP - 0.3 SP = 0.7 SP → So C = 0.7 SP.

Similarly, for the tube department, MSo=25% → C = 0.75 SP.

Wait, but that's if the markup is on sales. But in that case, the markup percentages given are on sales, and the average would be a simple average if we're considering it that way. But the problem might be asking for the average markup on sales across both departments, which would require calculating the total markup in dollars and then dividing by total sales.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total markup in dollars for each department and then find the average based on total sales.

So, for the radio department:

Sales = $15,000, markup is 30%. If this is markup on cost, then:

SP = 1.3 * Cost → Cost = SP / 1.3 = 15,000 / 1.3 ≈ $11,538.46

Markup amount = 15,000 - 11,538.46 ≈ $3,461.54

Similarly, for the tube department:

Sales = $40,000, markup is 25% on cost.

SP = 1.25 * Cost → Cost = 40,000 / 1.25 = $32,000

Markup amount = 40,000 - 32,000 = $8,000

Total markup = 3,461.54 + 8,000 ≈ $11,461.54

Total sales = 15,000 + 40,000 = 55,000

Average markup on sales = (11,461.54 / 55,000) * 100 ≈ 20.84%

Wait, that's not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is on sales, meaning that the markup is a percentage of the selling price. So for each department, the markup amount is (Markup percentage) * Sales.

So, for radio: 30% of 15,000 = 0.3 * 15,000 = $4,500

Tube: 25% of 40,000 = 0.25 *40,000 = $10,000

Total markup = 4,500 +10,000 = $14,500

Total sales = 55,000

Average markup on sales = (14,500 /55,000) *100 ≈ 26.36%

Ah, that's option A:26.36%. So that's the correct approach.

Wait, so if the markup is given as a percentage of sales, then the markup amount is just that percentage multiplied by sales. Then, the total markup is the sum of both, and the average is total markup divided by total sales.

So the calculation is:

Radio: 30% of 15,000 = 4,500

Tube:25% of40,000=10,000

Total markup=14,500

Total sales=55,000

Average markup= (14,500 /55,000)*100= (14,500 ÷55) = 263.636... ≈26.36%

So the answer is A:26.36%.
</think>

The markup percentages given are assumed to be based on sales. Therefore, the markup amount for each department is calculated as a percentage of their respective sales. The total markup is the sum of both departments' markups, and the average markup on sales is calculated by dividing the total markup by the total sales and multiplying by 100.
