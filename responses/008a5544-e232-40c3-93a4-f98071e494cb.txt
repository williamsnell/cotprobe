Okay, so I've got this question about chemical reactions and determining which option indicates that a reaction is spontaneous. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking which of the given options shows that a reaction is spontaneous. I remember that spontaneity in a reaction is often determined by the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔG°. If ΔG° is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. Wait, but looking at the options, option B says ΔG° is greater than zero. That would mean it's not spontaneous, right? So B isn't the right answer because a positive ΔG means non-spontaneous.

Option A talks about ΔH° being greater than zero, which means the reaction is endothermic. But endothermic doesn't necessarily mean it's spontaneous. Some endothermic reactions can be driven by entropy, but on its own, a positive ΔH doesn't indicate spontaneity. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option C says the reaction occurs without any input of energy. Wait, isn't that the definition of a spontaneous process? Spontaneous reactions can happen on their own without external energy input. But wait, some reactions might require a small initial energy input to start but then proceed spontaneously. For example, lighting a match (input) causes a fire (which is exothermic and continues spontaneously). So does C mean that the reaction doesn't require any energy at all, ever? Or just that it doesn't need a continuous input? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe C is correct, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option D is about ΔS° being greater than zero. A positive entropy change (ΔS° > 0) is favorable, but it doesn't guarantee spontaneity on its own because the Gibbs free energy also depends on enthalpy. For instance, if ΔH is highly positive and ΔS is only slightly positive, the reaction might not be spontaneous. So D alone isn't sufficient to indicate spontaneity.

Option E is ΔS° less than zero. That's unfavorable, so E is out.

Option F says Keq is greater than one. Keq relates to the position of equilibrium. If Keq is large, it means more products are present at equilibrium. But a reaction being at equilibrium doesn't necessarily mean it's spontaneous. It just means it's at a point where the forward and reverse rates are equal. So F might be a factor, but it's not a direct indicator of spontaneity. Plus, Keq depends on temperature, so a high Keq at one temperature doesn't automatically mean the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions.

Option G is exothermic. Exothermic reactions release heat, which is favorable, but again, not all exothermic reactions are spontaneous. For example, some might have a negative ΔG but others might not. So G isn't the sole indicator.

Option H states that at equilibrium, there are more products than reactants. That's similar to F, indicating a high Keq. But as I thought earlier, equilibrium doesn't define spontaneity. The reaction could be reversible, but whether it's spontaneous depends on ΔG°, not just the position of equilibrium.

Option I is Keq less than one. That would mean more reactants are present at equilibrium, which is the opposite of F. But again, it's about equilibrium, not spontaneity.

Wait, going back to option C: the reaction occurs without any input of energy. Spontaneous reactions do happen without needing a continuous input of energy. For example, rusting of iron is spontaneous and doesn't need energy input once it starts. But wait, isn't that only under certain conditions? Like, for a reaction to be spontaneous, it can have a positive ΔG under non-standard conditions but negative under standard? Or is it about the Gibbs free energy change being negative?

I think I might have confused myself. Let me clarify: a reaction is spontaneous if ΔG° is negative. So which option relates to that? None of the options directly mention ΔG being negative, but option C talks about the reaction occurring without input. That sounds like the definition of spontaneous. But wait, not all reactions that don't require energy are spontaneous. For example, some reactions might require a catalyst, which is an energy input, but once started, they proceed on their own. So if the reaction can occur without any input, that would align with spontaneity.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the formula ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. For a reaction to be spontaneous, ΔG° must be negative. So if ΔG° is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. Looking at the options, none directly mention ΔG being negative. The closest is option C, which seems to describe a spontaneous process.

Wait, but option C says "the reaction occurs without any input of energy." Does that mean it can happen on its own, which aligns with being spontaneous? Or does it mean that no energy is used at all, which might not be entirely accurate because some reactions require activation energy but proceed spontaneously once started.

Hmm. Another angle: spontaneous processes can happen either with or without energy input, as long as the overall ΔG is negative. For example, burning wood is spontaneous and releases heat, so it doesn't require continuous energy input. So in that case, the reaction can occur without needing an external energy source, making option C correct.

Alternatively, if a reaction requires a small initial energy input to overcome activation energy but then proceeds spontaneously, would that fit option C? The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "without any input of energy," which might be interpreted as no energy at all, which isn't correct because activation energy is needed. But perhaps the intended meaning is that once started, it doesn't need further input, making it spontaneous.

Given that, I think option C is the correct answer because it's the most direct indicator of a spontaneous reaction.

The correct answer is C. A spontaneous reaction occurs without any input of energy, meaning it can proceed on its own once initiated, aligning with the definition of spontaneity in thermodynamics.
