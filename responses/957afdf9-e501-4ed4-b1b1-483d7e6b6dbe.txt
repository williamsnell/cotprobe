Okay, so I've got this problem about an effusion cell and I need to find out how much the mass of the solid decreases in an hour. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me a few pieces of data. The effusion cell has a circular hole with a diameter of 1.50 mm. The molar mass of the solid is 300 g/mol, and its vapor pressure at 500 K is 0.735 Pa. I need to find the mass loss over 1 hour, which is 3600 seconds.

I remember that effusion has something to do with the rate at which gas molecules escape through a small hole. The formula I think is related to Graham's law, but perhaps more accurately, it's the effusion rate formula which involves the area of the hole, the pressure, the molar mass, and maybe temperature and the gas constant.

Wait, the formula for the rate of effusion (mass loss per time) is given by:

mass loss rate = (P * A) / (sqrt(M * R T))

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh right, the effusion rate can be calculated using the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R T)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to start from the kinetic theory approach. The effusion rate depends on the root mean square velocity of the gas molecules and the area of the hole.

The effusion rate formula is derived from the kinetic theory of gases. The formula for the rate of effusion is:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R T)

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of moles escaping per second.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the number of molecules escaping per unit time and then convert that into mass.

Let me try that. So, the number of molecules escaping per second (N_dot) can be found using the formula:

N_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T))

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the correct formula.

I think the effusion formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the area, pressure, and velocity.

The effusion equation is derived from the flux of molecules through the hole. The flux (number per area per time) is given by (1/4) * n * v_avg, where n is the number density and v_avg is the average velocity.

Wait, more accurately, the effusion rate (number of molecules per second) is given by:

N_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for the molar flux, which is:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T))

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the effusion rate in terms of pressure, area, molar mass, and temperature.

I think the formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R T)

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the units. P is in Pascals (Pa), which is kg/(m·s²). A is area in m². M is molar mass in kg/mol, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is kg·m²/(s²·mol·K), and T is in K.

Let me plug in the units to see if they work out for m_dot, which should be in kg/s.

So, numerator is Pa * m² = (kg/(m·s²)) * m² = kg·s⁻¹.

Denominator is sqrt( (kg/mol) * (kg·m²/(s²·mol·K)) * K )

Let me compute inside the square root:

M * R * T = (kg/mol) * (kg·m²/(s²·mol·K)) * K ) = (kg²·m²)/(s²·mol²).

So sqrt(M R T) is sqrt( kg²·m²/(s²·mol²) ) = kg·m/(s·mol).

So denominator is kg·m/(s·mol).

So overall, m_dot = (kg·s⁻¹) / (kg·m/(s·mol)) ) = (kg·s⁻¹ * s·mol) ) / (kg·m) ) = (mol)/(m).

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the molar flux, which is the number of moles per second per area, but then multiply by the area to get moles per second.

Wait, another approach: The effusion equation is often given by:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π)

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula for the rate of effusion as:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Let me recall that the effusion rate (mass per second) can be calculated using:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T) * (1/ sqrt(2 * π))

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mean velocity and the number of molecules.

The average velocity v_avg is sqrt(3RT/M), but sometimes it's also expressed as sqrt(8RT/(π M)).

Wait, the root mean square velocity is sqrt(3RT/M), but the average velocity is a bit different. Let me think: the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the average speed as sqrt(8RT/(π M)).

So, the average speed v_avg = sqrt(8 R T / (π M)).

Okay, now the effusion rate is the number of molecules passing through the area per second. The flux (number per area per second) is (1/4) * n * v_avg, where n is the number density.

Number density n = P/(R T).

So flux = (1/4) * (P/(R T)) * v_avg.

Putting in v_avg:

flux = (1/4) * (P/(R T)) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)) )

Simplify that:

flux = (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)) )

= (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T)

= (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T)

= (1/4) * P * sqrt(8/(π M)) / sqrt(R T)

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's square it properly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

n = P/(R T) → number per m³.

v_avg = sqrt(8 R T/(π M)) → m/s.

Flux (number per m² per second) = (1/4) * n * v_avg.

So flux = (1/4) * (P/(R T)) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)) )

Simplify:

= (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T)

= (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T)

= (1/4) * P * sqrt(8/(π M)) ) / sqrt(R T) * sqrt(R T)

Wait, because sqrt(R T) is sqrt(R T), so 1/(R T) * sqrt(R T) is 1/(sqrt(R T)).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to square the terms:

flux = (1/4) * (P/(R T)) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M))

= (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T)

= (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T)

= (1/4) * P/(sqrt(R T)) ) * sqrt(8/(π M))

Because sqrt(R T) * 1/(R T) is 1/(sqrt(R T)).

So flux = (1/4) * P * sqrt(8/(π M)) / sqrt(R T)

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Let me compute it numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the mass loss rate using the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T * π/2 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look for a standard formula.

Wait, I recall that the rate of effusion (mass per second) is given by:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(M * R * T) * sqrt(2 * π))

So, perhaps I can use that.

Given that, let's list the given values:

- Diameter of the hole, d = 1.50 mm → radius r = 0.75 mm = 0.75e-3 m.

Area A = π r² = π * (0.75e-3)^2 = π * (5.625e-7) ≈ 1.767e-6 m².

Wait, let me calculate that:

r = 1.50 mm / 2 = 0.75 mm = 0.75e-3 m.

A = π * (0.75e-3)^2 = π * 0.5625e-6 ≈ 1.767145867e-6 m².

Next, P = 0.735 Pa.

M = 300 g/mol → convert to kg/mol: 0.300 kg/mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 500 K.

Now, plug into the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)

Compute the denominator first:

sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)

= sqrt(2 * π * 0.300 kg/mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 500 K )

Compute inside the square root:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

6.2832 * 0.300 = 1.88496

1.88496 * 8.314 ≈ let's compute that:

1.88496 * 8 = 15.07968

1.88496 * 0.314 ≈ approx 0.594.

So total ≈ 15.07968 + 0.594 ≈ 15.67368.

Then multiply by 500 K:

15.67368 * 500 = 7836.84.

So inside the sqrt is 7836.84.

sqrt(7836.84) ≈ 88.53 kg^0.5/(mol^0.5) ??? Wait, let me check the units again.

Wait, M is in kg/mol, R is J/(mol·K) which is kg·m²/(s²·mol·K), T is K.

So M * R * T has units:

kg/mol * kg·m²/(s²·mol·K) * K = kg²·m²/(s²·mol²).

Multiply by 2π, which is dimensionless, so the unit inside sqrt is kg²·m²/(s²·mol²).

The square root gives kg·m/(s·mol).

So denominator is sqrt(...) = 88.53 kg·m/(s·mol).

Now, numerator is P * A = 0.735 Pa * 1.767e-6 m².

Pa is kg/(m·s²), so:

0.735 kg/(m·s²) * 1.767e-6 m² = 0.735 * 1.767e-6 kg/s.

Calculate 0.735 * 1.767e-6:

0.735 * 1.767 ≈ 1.297.

So 1.297e-6 kg/s.

So m_dot = (1.297e-6 kg/s) / 88.53 kg·m/(s·mol)

Wait, let me compute the units:

kg/s divided by (kg·m/(s·mol)) ) → (kg/s) * (s·mol)/(kg·m)) = mol/(m).

Hmm, that doesn't make sense for m_dot which should be kg/s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π)

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Wait, let me recompute with that.

So denominator is sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T).

As before, 2 * π ≈6.2832.

M = 0.300 kg/mol.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 m²·kg/(s²·mol·K).

T=500 K.

So:

2 * π * M * R * T = 6.2832 * 0.300 * 8.314 * 500.

Compute step by step:

6.2832 * 0.300 = 1.88496.

1.88496 * 8.314 ≈ let's compute:

1.88496 * 8 = 15.07968.

1.88496 * 0.314 ≈ 0.594.

Total ≈ 15.07968 + 0.594 ≈ 15.67368.

Multiply by 500: 15.67368 * 500 = 7836.84.

So sqrt(7836.84) ≈ 88.53.

So denominator is 88.53.

Numerator P*A is 0.735 * 1.767e-6 ≈ 0.735 * 1.767e-6 ≈ 1.297e-6 kg/s.

Wait, no, wait: 0.735 Pa * 1.767e-6 m².

Pa is kg/(m·s²), so kg/(m·s²) * m² = kg·m/s².

Wait, no, kg/(m·s²) * m² = kg·m/s²? No, wait:

kg/(m·s²) * m² = kg·m/(s²).

Wait, but mass loss rate should be in kg/s, so perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π)) )

But that would give units:

kg/(m·s²) * m² / sqrt( kg/mol * J/(mol·K) * K )

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so M * R * T has units kg/mol * kg·m²/(s²·mol·K) * K = kg²·m²/(s²·mol²).

Multiply by 2π (dimensionless), so sqrt gives kg·m/(s·mol).

So m_dot's units are (kg/(m·s²) * m²) / (kg·m/(s·mol)) )

= (kg·m/s²) * m² → Wait, no, let's compute numerator units:

P is kg/(m·s²), A is m².

So P*A is (kg/(m·s²)) * m² = kg·m/s².

Denominator is sqrt(M * R * T * 2π) which has units kg·m/(s·mol).

So m_dot = (kg·m/s²) / (kg·m/(s·mol)) ) = (kg·m/s²) * (s·mol)/(kg·m)) ) = mol/s.

Wait, that can't be right because m_dot should be mass per time, not moles per time.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing a molar mass factor. Because m_dot is in kg/s, and the denominator gives mol/s, then m_dot would be moles per second times molar mass.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me rethink.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) * (1/M_molar)

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of molecules and then convert to mass.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the number of moles escaping per second and then multiply by molar mass to get mass loss per second.

Let me try that approach.

Number of moles per second, n_dot, is given by:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Wait, but M here is molar mass in kg/mol, right?

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

where M is molar mass in kg/mol.

Then, mass loss rate m_dot = n_dot * M.

Wait, that makes sense. Because n_dot is moles per second, and M is kg/mol, so m_dot = n_dot * M → kg/s.

Wait, let me check the units:

n_dot = (kg/(m·s²) * m²) / sqrt(kg/mol * J/(mol·K) * K) )

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so inside the sqrt:

M * R * T = kg/mol * (kg·m²/(s²·mol·K)) * K ) = kg²·m²/(s²·mol²).

sqrt(M R T) → kg·m/(s·mol).

So n_dot = (kg·m/s²) / (kg·m/(s·mol)) ) = (kg·m/s²) * (s·mol)/(kg·m) ) = mol/s.

Then m_dot = n_dot * M → (mol/s) * (kg/mol) ) = kg/s.

Yes, that works.

So let's compute n_dot first.

n_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)

P = 0.735 Pa = 0.735 kg/(m·s²).

A = π*(0.75e-3)^2 ≈ 1.767e-6 m².

M = 0.300 kg/mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 m²·kg/(s²·mol·K).

T =500 K.

Compute denominator sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T):

Compute 2 * π = 6.2832.

M * R * T = 0.300 * 8.314 * 500.

0.300 * 8.314 ≈ 2.4942.

2.4942 * 500 ≈ 1247.1.

Multiply by 6.2832: 1247.1 *6.2832 ≈ let's see, 1247 *6 ≈7482, 1247*0.2832≈353. So total ≈7482 +353≈7835.

So denominator sqrt(7835) ≈88.52.

So n_dot = (0.735 * 1.767e-6) / 88.52.

Compute numerator: 0.735 *1.767e-6 ≈ 1.297e-6.

So n_dot ≈1.297e-6 / 88.52 ≈1.465e-8 mol/s.

Then, m_dot = n_dot * M = 1.465e-8 mol/s * 0.300 kg/mol = 4.395e-9 kg/s.

Convert kg/s to mg/h:

First, kg/s to mg/s: 4.395e-9 kg/s = 4.395e-6 mg/s (since 1 kg = 1e6 mg).

Then, multiply by seconds in an hour: 3600 s.

So mass loss per hour = 4.395e-6 mg/s * 3600 s = 4.395e-6 *3600 ≈0.015822 mg.

Wait, that's about 15.822 micrograms, which is 0.0158 mg, which is way too small. But looking at the options, the smallest is 8 mg, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in milligrams, and 0.015 mg is way off. So I must have messed up the formula or the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for n_dot. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

n_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * m * R * T), where m is the molar mass in kg/mol.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the molar mass in the denominator as M, but perhaps I should have used the molar mass in a different way.

Wait, another approach: The effusion rate can also be calculated using the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) * sqrt( (2 * π * M) / (R * T) )^{-1}

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe the formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (2 * π * M) / (R * T) )) )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (8 * M * R * T) / (π) )) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's try using the effusion formula which relates to the molar flux.

The molar flux (n_dot) is given by:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the molar flux is:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * m * R * T)) ), where m is the molar mass in kg/mol.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units earlier. Let me try plugging in the numbers again carefully.

Compute n_dot:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

P = 0.735 kg/(m·s²)

A = 1.767e-6 m²

M = 0.300 kg/mol

R =8.314 m²·kg/(s²·mol·K)

T=500 K

Compute denominator:

sqrt(2 * π * 0.300 *8.314 *500 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

2 * π ≈6.2832

6.2832 *0.300 =1.88496

1.88496 *8.314 ≈15.6737

15.6737 *500 =7836.85.

sqrt(7836.85) ≈88.53.

So denominator is 88.53.

n_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) / 88.53.

Calculate numerator: 0.735 *1.767e-6 ≈1.297e-6.

So n_dot ≈1.297e-6 /88.53 ≈1.465e-8 mol/s.

Then, m_dot =n_dot * M =1.465e-8 *0.300 =4.395e-9 kg/s.

Convert kg/s to mg/h:

4.395e-9 kg/s =4.395e-6 mg/s (since 1 kg =1e6 mg).

Multiply by 3600 s/hour:

4.395e-6 mg/s *3600 s ≈0.01582 mg/hour.

Wait, that's about 0.0158 mg, which is 15.8 micrograms. But none of the options are that small. The options start at 8 mg, so I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π)) ) * sqrt( (2 * π) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(M * R * T)) ) * (1/ sqrt(2 * π)) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (M * R * T) / (2 * π) )) )

Wait, maybe I'll try using the formula from effusion theory where the mass loss rate is:

m_dot = (P * A) * sqrt( (2 * π * M) ) / (R * T) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me try another approach.

I think the correct formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (2 * π * M * R * T) )) )

So using that, let me recompute.

Compute denominator:

sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T) = sqrt(2 * π * 0.300 *8.314 *500)

As before, inside the sqrt is 7836.85, so sqrt is ~88.53.

So m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) /88.53.

As before, 0.735 *1.767e-6 ≈1.297e-6.

1.297e-6 /88.53 ≈1.465e-8 kg/s.

m_dot =1.465e-8 kg/s =1.465e-5 mg/s.

Multiply by 3600 s/hour: 1.465e-5 *3600 ≈0.05274 mg/hour.

Still way too small. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula for m_dot is (P * A) / sqrt( (M * R * T) ) * something. Maybe I'm missing a factor of sqrt(2) or something.

Wait, another approach: The effusion rate can be calculated using the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(M * R * T * π/2)) )

Which would be m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (M R T π)/2 )) )

So let me compute that.

Denominator: sqrt( (0.300 *8.314 *500 * π)/2 )

Compute inside:

0.300 *8.314 ≈2.4942.

2.4942 *500 ≈1247.1.

1247.1 * π ≈3916.5.

3916.5 /2 ≈1958.25.

sqrt(1958.25) ≈44.25.

So denominator is44.25.

m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) /44.25.

Calculate numerator: 0.735 *1.767e-6 ≈1.297e-6.

1.297e-6 /44.25 ≈2.93e-8 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour:

2.93e-8 kg/s =2.93e-5 mg/s.

Multiply by 3600 s: 2.93e-5 *3600 ≈1.055 mg/hour.

Still way too small.

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I should try a different approach, perhaps using the effusion formula in terms of the area, pressure, and molar mass.

Wait, I found a formula online (though I can't access it now) that says the mass loss rate is:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π)

Which is similar to what I tried earlier. Let me compute that again.

Compute denominator:

sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T) = sqrt(2 * π *0.300 *8.314 *500 )

As before, inside sqrt is 7836.85, so sqrt is ~88.53.

m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) /88.53 ≈1.465e-8 kg/s.

Again, same result as before, which gives 0.0158 mg/hour.

That's way too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Maybe I should use the effusion formula which is:

m_dot = (P * A) * sqrt( (2 * π * M) / (R * T) )^{-1}

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (2 * π * M) / (R * T) )) )

Which would be:

m_dot = (P * A) * sqrt( (R * T) / (2 * π * M) ) )

Let me compute that.

Compute sqrt( (R*T)/(2 * π * M) )

R*T =8.314 *500 ≈4157.

2 * π ≈6.2832.

6.2832 * M=6.2832 *0.300≈1.88496.

So (R*T)/(2 * π * M) =4157 /1.88496 ≈2204.5.

sqrt(2204.5)≈46.96.

So m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) *46.96.

Compute numerator:

0.735 *1.767e-6 ≈1.297e-6.

Multiply by 46.96: 1.297e-6 *46.96 ≈6.08e-5 kg/s.

Convert kg/s to mg/hour:

6.08e-5 kg/s =60.8 mg/s.

Multiply by 3600 s/hour: 60.8 *3600 ≈218,880 mg/hour.

Wait, that's way too high. 218,880 mg is 218 grams per hour, which is way more than the options given, which are in the 8-32 mg range.

So that can't be right either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The molar mass is 300 g/mol, so 0.3 kg/mol.

The effusion formula for the mass loss rate is:

m_dot = (P * A) * sqrt( (2 * π * M) ) / (R * T) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt( (M * R * T) * 2 * π )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (M * R * T) ) * sqrt(2 * π) )

Which is the same as before.

But the result is still too small.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units correctly.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use the molar mass in g/mol instead of kg/mol. Let me try that.

So M =300 g/mol =0.3 kg/mol.

Wait, but I already did that. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach.

The effusion rate can be calculated using the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) * sqrt( (2 * π * M) ) / (R * T)

Wait, but let me compute that.

Compute sqrt(2 * π * M) = sqrt(2 *3.1416 *300 g/mol).

Wait, wait, M is 300 g/mol, which is 0.3 kg/mol.

So 2 * π *0.3 ≈1.88496.

sqrt(1.88496)≈1.373.

Then, R*T=8.314 *500≈4157.

So m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) *1.373 /4157.

Calculate numerator: 0.735 *1.767e-6≈1.297e-6.

Multiply by 1.373: 1.297e-6 *1.373≈1.783e-6.

Divide by 4157: 1.783e-6 /4157≈4.29e-10 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour: 4.29e-10 kg/s =4.29e-7 mg/s.

Multiply by 3600: 4.29e-7 *3600≈1.544e-3 mg/hour, which is 0.001544 mg/hour. Even smaller, which can't be right.

I must be missing something here. Let me try to find a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π) )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of molecules escaping per second and then multiply by the molar mass to get mass.

Number of molecules per second, N_dot = (P * A) / sqrt( (2 * π * m * R * T) ), where m is the mass of one mole (molar mass * Avogadro's number).

Wait, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

N_dot = (P * A) / sqrt( (2 * π * M * R * T) )

Then, m_dot = N_dot * (M * N_A) / N_A, where M is molar mass in kg/mol.

Wait, no, that might not make sense. Alternatively, m_dot = N_dot * (molar mass) / (Avogadro's number).

Wait, let me think: N_dot is molecules per second.

Each molecule has mass m = M/(N_A), where M is molar mass in kg/mol, and N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol⁻¹).

So m_dot = N_dot * (M/(N_A)) )

So let me compute N_dot first.

N_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T )

Compute denominator sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T ) = sqrt(2 * π *0.3 *8.314 *500 ) = sqrt(7836.85) ≈88.53.

N_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) /88.53 ≈1.465e-8 molecules/s.

Then, m_dot = N_dot * (M / N_A )

M =0.3 kg/mol.

N_A =6.022e23 mol⁻¹.

So, m_dot =1.465e-8 * (0.3 /6.022e23) kg/s.

0.3 /6.022e23 ≈4.98e-25 kg/molecule.

So m_dot =1.465e-8 *4.98e-25 ≈7.29e-33 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour: 7.29e-33 kg/s =7.29e-27 mg/s.

Multiply by 3600 s: 7.29e-27 *3600 ≈2.624e-23 mg/hour.

That's way too small. I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for effusion in terms of the molar mass in g/mol instead of kg/mol. Let me try that.

M =300 g/mol =0.3 kg/mol.

Wait, no, that's the same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the molar flux (n_dot) which is:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Where M is in g/mol, but then convert it to kg/mol. Wait, no, units must be consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (2 * π * M) / (R * T) )) )

Wait, I'm getting too confused. Maybe I should look for an example.

Wait, I found a resource that says the formula for the rate of effusion in terms of pressure, area, molar mass, and temperature is:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π)

So using that:

m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) / sqrt(0.3 *8.314 *500 *2 * π )

Compute denominator inside sqrt:

0.3 *8.314≈2.4942.

2.4942 *500≈1247.1.

1247.1 *2 * π ≈1247.1 *6.2832≈7836.85.

sqrt(7836.85)≈88.53.

So m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) /88.53 ≈ same as before, 1.465e-8 kg/s.

Which gives 0.0158 mg/hour. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the molar mass in g/mol. Let me try that.

So M =300 g/mol =0.3 kg/mol.

Wait, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have M in kg/mol. So I'm doing that already.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of the area again.

Area A = π*(d/2)^2 = π*(0.75e-3 m)^2 = π*(0.75e-3)^2.

0.75e-3 m is 0.75 mm.

So 0.75e-3 m squared is (0.75e-3)^2 = 0.5625e-6 m².

Multiply by π: 0.5625e-6 *3.1416 ≈1.767e-6 m². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass loss using the formula:

m = P * A * t / sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π)

So m = (0.735 *1.767e-6 *3600) / sqrt(0.3 *8.314 *500 *2 * π )

Compute numerator:0.735 *1.767e-6 =1.297e-6.

Multiply by 3600:1.297e-6 *3600≈4.669e-3.

Denominator: sqrt(0.3 *8.314 *500 *2 * π )=sqrt(7836.85)≈88.53.

So m≈4.669e-3 /88.53 ≈5.276e-5 kg.

Convert kg to mg:5.276e-5 kg =52.76 mg.

Wait, that's about 53 mg, which isn't one of the options either.

Wait, but the options are up to 32 mg. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try another approach.

Let me use the formula for effusion in terms of the molar mass in g/mol, pressure in Pascals, area in m², R=8.314 J/mol·K, and T in K.

The formula for the molar flux (n_dot) is:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Where M is in kg/mol.

Then, the mass loss rate is m_dot = n_dot * M.

So let's compute n_dot:

n_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6) / sqrt(2 * π *0.3 *8.314 *500 )

Denominator: sqrt(2 * π *0.3 *8.314 *500 )=sqrt(7836.85)=88.53.

n_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6)/88.53 ≈1.465e-8 mol/s.

m_dot =1.465e-8 mol/s *0.3 kg/mol=4.395e-9 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour:

4.395e-9 kg/s =4.395e-6 mg/s.

Multiply by 3600 s:4.395e-6 *3600≈0.0158 mg/hour.

That's 0.0158 mg, which is way too small. Clearly, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the molar mass in g/mol and adjust the units accordingly.

Let me try that.

Let M =300 g/mol =0.3 kg/mol.

Wait, same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (2 * π * M * R * T) / (M_molar) )) )

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula where M is in g/mol and adjust R accordingly.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K).

Wait, since 1 J =1 m³·Pa.

Hmm, perhaps I should use R in different units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where M is in g/mol, R=8.314 J/(mol·K), and T in K.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try using the formula from the ideal gas law.

Wait, another approach: The number of moles in the vapor at equilibrium is given by the ideal gas law, but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the escape velocity and flux.

The flux is given by (1/4) * n * v_avg, where n is the number density.

n = P/(R*T).

v_avg = sqrt(8 R T/(π M)).

So flux = (1/4) * (P/(R T)) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)) )

= (1/4) * P/(R T) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T)

= (1/4) * P/(sqrt(R T)) ) * sqrt(8/(π M)).

So flux = (P * sqrt(8/(π M)) )/(4 sqrt(R T)).

Then, the number of moles per second is flux * A * (1/N_A), since flux is molecules/(m²·s).

Wait, no, flux is molecules/(m²·s), so multiply by area A to get molecules/s, then divide by Avogadro's number to get moles/s.

So n_dot = flux * A = (P * sqrt(8/(π M)) )/(4 sqrt(R T)) ) * A.

Then, m_dot =n_dot * M.

So m_dot = (P * sqrt(8/(π M)) )/(4 sqrt(R T)) ) * A * M.

Simplify:

m_dot = (P * A * sqrt(8/(π M)) * M )/(4 sqrt(R T)) )

= (P * A * sqrt(8 M/(π)) )/(4 sqrt(R T)) )

= (P * A * sqrt(8/(π)) * sqrt(M) )/(4 sqrt(R T)) )

= (P * A * sqrt(8 M/(π)) )/(4 sqrt(R T)) )

Alternatively,

m_dot = (P * A * sqrt(8/(π)) )/(4 sqrt(R T)) ) * sqrt(M).

Hmm, perhaps I can compute this.

Compute each part:

P =0.735 kg/(m·s²).

A =1.767e-6 m².

sqrt(8/π) =sqrt(2.546)≈1.595.

4 remains as denominator.

sqrt(R T) =sqrt(8.314 *500 )=sqrt(4157)=64.48.

sqrt(M)=sqrt(0.3)=0.5477.

Now, compute numerator:

0.735 *1.767e-6 *1.595 ≈0.735 *1.767e-6 ≈1.297e-6; 1.297e-6 *1.595≈2.066e-6.

Denominator:4 *64.48≈257.92.

So m_dot = (2.066e-6) *0.5477 /257.92.

Compute numerator:2.066e-6 *0.5477≈1.131e-6.

Divide by 257.92:1.131e-6 /257.92≈4.388e-9 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour:4.388e-9 kg/s =4.388e-6 mg/s.

Multiply by 3600 s:4.388e-6 *3600≈0.0158 mg/hour.

Again, same result as before. I'm clearly stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the effusion formula might involve the square of the molar mass, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

m_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt( (2 * M * R * T) / π )) )

Let me compute that.

Denominator: sqrt(2 *0.3 *8.314 *500 / π )

= sqrt( (2 *0.3 *8.314 *500 ) /3.1416 )

Compute inside:

2 *0.3=0.6.

0.6 *8.314≈4.9884.

4.9884 *500≈2494.2.

2494.2 /3.1416≈794.0.

sqrt(794)≈28.18.

So m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6 ) /28.18.

Numerator:0.735 *1.767e-6≈1.297e-6.

Divide by28.18:1.297e-6 /28.18≈4.602e-8 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour:4.602e-8 kg/s=4.602e-5 mg/s.

Multiply by3600:4.602e-5 *3600≈0.1657 mg/hour.

Still way too small.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m_dot = (P * A) * sqrt( (2 * π * M) / (R * T) )^{-1}

Which would be:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt( (2 * π * M) / (R * T) )

= (P * A) * sqrt( (R * T) / (2 * π * M) )

Compute sqrt( (8.314 *500)/(2 * π *0.3) )

= sqrt(4157/(1.88496)) )=sqrt(2204.5)=46.96.

So m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6 ) *46.96.

Calculate:

0.735 *1.767e-6≈1.297e-6.

1.297e-6 *46.96≈6.08e-5 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour:6.08e-5 kg/s=60.8 mg/s.

Multiply by3600:60.8 *3600=218,880 mg/hour.

That's way too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Maybe I should use the formula from kinetic theory where the effusion rate is based on the root mean square speed.

The root mean square speed is v_rms = sqrt(3 R T / M).

The number of molecules escaping per second is (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) ).

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me try to find the mass loss using the effusion formula from another source.

I found that the mass effusion rate is given by:

m_dot = (P * A) / sqrt(M * R * T * 2 * π )

So using that:

m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6 ) / sqrt(0.3 *8.314 *500 *2 * π )

Compute denominator:

0.3 *8.314=2.4942.

2.4942 *500=1247.1.

1247.1 *2 * π≈7836.85.

sqrt(7836.85)=88.53.

m_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6 ) /88.53 ≈1.465e-8 kg/s.

Convert to mg/hour:1.465e-8 kg/s =1.465e-5 mg/s.

Multiply by3600:1.465e-5 *3600≈0.05274 mg/hour.

Still way too small.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the molar mass in g/mol. Let me try that.

M =300 g/mol =0.3 kg/mol.

Wait, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should use M in g/mol and adjust R accordingly.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K) =8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K).

Wait, maybe I should use M in g/mol and R in cm³·bar/(mol·K), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but that complicates units further.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything to consistent units.

Let me try using M in kg/mol, R in J/(mol·K), and T in K.

Wait, I did that already.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the number of moles in the vapor and then find the effusion rate, but that seems more complicated.

Another idea: Perhaps the pressure given is in Pascals, but I should convert it to a different unit. Let me check.

0.735 Pa is correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula where pressure is in mmHg or torr. Let me try that.

1 Pa ≈0.0075006 mmHg.

So 0.735 Pa ≈0.735 *0.0075006≈0.005513 mmHg.

Wait, perhaps using mmHg would make the calculation easier, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles in a certain volume, but that might not help directly.

Wait, another approach: The molar flux is given by:

n_dot = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Then, the number of moles per hour is n_dot * 3600.

Mass loss per hour is n_dot * M * 3600.

So let's compute that.

n_dot = (0.735 *1.767e-6 ) /88.53 ≈1.465e-8 mol/s.

Mass loss per second:1.465e-8 mol/s *0.3 kg/mol =4.395e-9 kg/s.

Mass loss per hour:4.395e-9 kg/s *3600 s ≈1.582e-5 kg/hour.

Convert kg to mg:1.582e-5 kg =15.82 mg/hour.

Ah, that's about 15.8 mg/hour. Looking at the options, option C is 16 mg, which is close.

Wait, but earlier calculations kept giving me around 0.0158 mg/hour, but when I considered that m_dot is 4.395e-9 kg/s and multiplied by 3600, I get:

4.395e-9 *3600 =1.582e-5 kg/hour =15.82 mg/hour.

Yes, that makes sense. So the mass loss is approximately 15.8 mg, which rounds to 16 mg. So the answer should be option C:16 mg.
</think>

To determine the mass loss of the solid in the effusion cell over 1 hour, we use the effusion formula:

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{P \cdot A}{\sqrt{2 \pi M R T}}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Diameter of the hole**: \( d = 1.50 \, \text{mm} = 0.75 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)
- **Radius of the hole**: \( r = \frac{d}{2} = 0.75 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)
- **Area of the hole**: 
  \[
  A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.75 \times 10^{-3})^2 \approx 1.767 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2
  \]
- **Molar mass**: \( M = 300 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/mol} \)
- **Vapor pressure**: \( P = 0.735 \, \text{Pa} \)
- **Temperature**: \( T = 500 \, \text{K} \)
- **Gas constant**: \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)
- **Time**: \( t = 1 \, \text{h} = 3600 \, \text{s} \)

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
\[
\sqrt{2 \pi M R T} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \pi \cdot 0.3 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 500}
\]
1. Compute inside the square root:
   \[
   2 \cdot \pi \cdot 0.3 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 500 \approx 7836.85
   \]
2. Take the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{7836.85} \approx 88.53
   \]

### Step 2: Compute the numerator
\[
P \cdot A = 0.735 \cdot 1.767 \times 10^{-6} \approx 1.297 \times 10^{-6}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the mass loss rate
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{1.297 \times 10^{-6}}{88.53} \approx 1.465 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{kg/s}
\]

### Step 4: Convert to mass loss per hour
\[
\text{Mass loss per hour} = \dot{m} \cdot t = (1.465 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot 3600 \approx 5.274 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg/h}
\]
Convert to milligrams:
\[
5.274 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg/h} = 52.74 \, \text{mg/h}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mass of the solid decreases by approximately **16 mg** in 1 hour, which corresponds to option **C**.

C
