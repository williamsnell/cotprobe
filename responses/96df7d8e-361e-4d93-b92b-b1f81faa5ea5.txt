Okay, so I've got this question about Rawls and the Principle of Permissible Opting (POP) regarding social primary goods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Rawls, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that Rawls is all about justice and fairness, especially his idea of the original position and the veil of ignorance. The POP is part of his theory, right? So, the idea is that people in the original position, behind the veil of ignorance, would choose principles that maximize their own advantage, but without knowing their place in society.

Social primary goods are things like income, wealth, education, and opportunities. These are the basics that people need to function in society. Now, the question is asking which option aligns most with what Rawls says the POP would choose in terms of these goods.

Looking at the options:

A: Wealth over a compassionate society. Wait, Rawls isn't about maximizing wealth for some over others. His theory emphasizes fairness and equality. So choosing wealth over compassion might not be it. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

B: Equality over power. Equality sounds more in line with Rawls. He talks about the difference principle, which allows for inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged. So, maybe this is a good option. If the POP opts for equality, that aligns with Rawls' principles.

C: Unselfish. I'm not sure. The POP is about self-interested choices behind the veil, so being unselfish doesn't quite fit. They're choosing for themselves, not others, but in a way that's fair.

D: Protect the disabled. That seems more about specific groups, but I'm not sure if that's the primary focus of POP regarding primary goods. It might be a part of it, but maybe not the most direct choice.

So, going back to Rawls' two principles: first, equal basic liberties, and second, the difference principle regarding social goods. The difference principle allows inequalities only if they improve the situation of the worst-off. So, in terms of primary goods, the POP would want to ensure that the least advantaged have enough, which ties into equality.

Therefore, option B seems to fit better because it's about equality over power. The POP would prefer equality in the distribution of primary goods to maximize their own advantage, knowing they could be in any position in society.

The Principle of Permissible Opting (POP) in Rawls' theory suggests that individuals in the original position, behind the veil of ignorance, would choose principles that maximize their own advantage while ensuring fairness. Social primary goods, such as income, wealth, and opportunities, are central to this decision-making process. Rawls emphasizes equality and fairness, particularly through his difference principle, which allows for inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Choosing wealth over a compassionate society contradicts Rawls' focus on fairness and equality.
- **B**: Equality over power aligns with Rawls' principles, as the POP would prioritize fairness to ensure the least advantaged are benefited.
- **C**: The POP is self-interested, not unselfish, so this doesn't fit.
- **D**: Protecting the disabled is important but not the primary focus of POP regarding social primary goods.

Given Rawls' emphasis on equality and the difference principle, the most consistent choice is **B**.

Answer: B
