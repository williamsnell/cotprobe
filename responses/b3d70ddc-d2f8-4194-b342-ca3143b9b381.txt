Okay, so I've got this question about the food resource base of post-Pleistocene Europe. Hmm, I remember that the Pleistocene era was the time of the ice ages, and it ended around 10,000 years ago. After that, Europe went through some significant changes. I think the question is asking about the main feature of their food resources during that period.

The options are A through D. Let's go through them one by one. Option A is dependence on megafauna. Megafauna refers to large animals like mammoths or big game. During the Pleistocene, humans probably relied a lot on these large animals because they were abundant. But wait, after the Pleistocene, especially into the Holocene, the climate changed. It became warmer, and the megafauna started to decline or go extinct. So maybe dependence on megafauna was less prominent then. So A might not be the right answer.

Option B is hunting and gathering. I know that during the Paleolithic period, which is before the Neolithic, people were hunter-gatherers. But the question is about post-Pleistocene Europe. The Neolithic Revolution started around that time, introducing agriculture. So while hunting and gathering was still a part of their diet, it wasn't the most prominent feature anymore because farming was becoming more established. So B might not be the best choice.

Option C is dependence on fur-bearing animals. I'm not too sure about this. Fur-bearing animals would be important for clothing, but the question is about food resources. I don't think fur was a primary food source. So maybe C isn't the right answer.

Option D is diversity. That makes sense because after the Pleistocene, the environment became more varied. With the end of the ice age, forests and different ecosystems developed. This would have led to a wider variety of food sources available, like plants, smaller animals, fish, etc. So the food base would have been more diverse than before when it was more reliant on megafauna. That seems plausible.

Putting it together: Post-Pleistocene Europe saw a shift from large game to a broader diet including plants, smaller animals, and eventually agriculture. So the most prominent feature would be diversity in their food resources. Therefore, the answer should be D.

The most prominent feature of the food resource base of post-Pleistocene Europe was its diversity. After the Pleistocene, the climate warmed, leading to the decline of megafauna and the development of varied ecosystems. This shift allowed for a broader diet including plants, smaller animals, and eventually the rise of agriculture. 

Answer: D
