Okay, so I've got this question about general partnerships, and I need to figure out which option the partner isn't entitled to. Let me think through this carefully.

First, I remember that in a general partnership, all partners are involved in the management and have certain rights. So, option A says "To review accounting records." I think partners usually have the right to look at the books because they're all responsible for the business. So A is probably something they can do.

Option B is "To participate in management." General partners are definitely involved in managing the business. They make decisions together, so B seems like something they're entitled to. So B is not the answer.

Option C is "To be liable only for personal negligence." Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I know that in general partnerships, partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. That means each partner can be held responsible for the entire debt, not just their share. So if one partner is negligent, all partners can be sued for that. So being liable only for personal negligence doesn't sound right. Wait, but if a partner is negligent, they might be liable for their own actions, but others could also be liable. So, the question is asking what the partner is not entitled to. So if a partner is negligent, they can't just be liable only for their own part; others might also be held responsible. So the partner isn't entitled to being liable only for personal negligence. That makes sense because in a general partnership, each partner is fully liable, not just for their own actions but for the others as well.

So putting it all together, the answer should be C.

The partner in a general partnership is not entitled to being liable only for personal negligence because they are jointly and severally liable for the partnership's obligations.
