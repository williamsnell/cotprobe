Okay, so I've got this biology question here about variation, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement about variation is true, with options A through D. I remember that variation can be genetic or environmental, but the options here seem to focus more on genetic aspects. Let me break down each option one by one.

Option A: "All phenotypic variation is the result of genotypic variation." Hmm. Phenotypic variation refers to the observable differences between organisms, like height or color. Genotypic variation is the variation in their genetic makeup. But wait, isn't phenotypic variation also influenced by environmental factors? Like, two plants with the same genotype might have different heights if one gets more sunlight. So if that's the case, not all phenotypic variation comes from genotype. So A might not be correct.

Option B: "All genetic variation produces phenotypic variation." Wait, genetic variation is changes in the DNA, like mutations or recombination. But sometimes genetic variations might not result in a noticeable phenotype. For example, a silent mutation where the amino acid doesn't change, or variations in non-coding regions. So not all genetic variation leads to a phenotypic change. So B might not be true either.

Option C: "All nucleotide variability results in neutral variation." Neutral variation refers to genetic changes that don't affect the fitness of the organism, meaning they don't provide an advantage or disadvantage. But nucleotide variability can also lead to advantageous or deleterious mutations. So if a nucleotide change affects the protein structure, it might be selected for or against. So C is probably false because not all nucleotide variability is neutral.

Option D: "All new alleles are the result of nucleotide variability." New alleles arise from changes in the DNA sequence, which is nucleotide variability. So when a mutation occurs, like a point mutation changing a single nucleotide, that creates a new allele. So D seems correct because new alleles are indeed the result of nucleotide changes.

Wait, let me double-check. Option A: I think phenotypic variation can come from both genotype and environment, so A is wrong. Option B: genetic variation doesn't always produce phenotypic changes, so B is wrong. Option C: not all nucleotide changes are neutral, so C is wrong. Option D: yes, new alleles are from nucleotide changes. So D is the correct answer.
