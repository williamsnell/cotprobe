Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the phase velocity and the index of refraction of a medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the medium has a relative permittivity of 25 and a relative permeability of unity. That means the relative permittivity (εr) is 25 and the relative permeability (μr) is 1, right? Because "unity" means one.

Wait, I remember that the index of refraction, n, is related to these two. Oh right, n equals the square root of (εr * μr). Since μr is 1, it's just sqrt(25). Let me calculate that. 25 under the square root is 5. So the index of refraction should be 5. That's part (b) done.

Now, part (a) is about the phase velocity. Phase velocity, v_p, is given by the formula v_p equals the speed of light in a vacuum (c) divided by the index of refraction (n). Oh wait, no, wait—I think it's c divided by n, but wait another moment. Or is it the other way around? No, no, I think I'm mixing it up. The phase velocity formula is v_p = c / n. Wait, no, wait, no, that's the group velocity sometimes. Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, the general formula for phase velocity in a medium is v_p = c * sqrt(μr * εr). Because the phase velocity is c divided by the square root of (μr * εr), right? Because the speed in a medium is c over the square root of the product of relative permeability and permittivity. Alternatively, since n = sqrt(μr εr), then v_p is c/n. Oh right, because n is sqrt(μr εr), so v_p = c/(sqrt(μr εr)).

Wait, so if μr is 1 and εr is 25, then sqrt(1*25) is 5. So v_p would be c divided by 5. What's c? I think it's approximately 3.0 × 10^8 meters per second. So dividing that by 5 gives 6.0 × 10^7 meters per second, which is 0.6 × 10^8 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option D says 0.6e8 m/s and index 5. That seems right.

But wait, another thought: sometimes people get confused between phase velocity and group velocity. But the question specifically asks for phase velocity, so I think I'm correct.

So for part (a), phase velocity is 0.6e8 m/s, and part (b) index is 5. So the correct option should be D.

The medium has a relative permittivity (εr) of 25 and a relative permeability (μr) of 1. 

For the index of refraction (n), it is calculated as:
\[
n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r \cdot \mu_r} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 1} = 5
\]

For the phase velocity (v_p), it is given by:
\[
v_p = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{5} = 0.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **D: 0.6 × 10^8 meters/sec, 5**.
