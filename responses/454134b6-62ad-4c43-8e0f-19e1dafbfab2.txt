Question:

Options:

A: The central limit theorem states that the mean of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximately follow a normal distribution.
B: If the population is uniformly distributed, then as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to a normal distribution.

D: If the population is normally distributed, then as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to a normal distribution.
E: The central limit theorem states that the median of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximately follow a normal distribution.
F: The central limit theorem refers to something else.
G: The central limit theorem states that as the sample size increases, the median of the sample means becomes closer to the median of the population.
H: No matter how the population is distributed, as the sample size increases, the mean of the sample means becomes closer to the mean of the population.
I: Regardless of the distribution of the population, the variance of the sample means will converge to the variance of the population as the sample size increases.
J: The central limit theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximately follow a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original measurement distribution.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option correctly states the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). I remember from my stats class that CLT is a fundamental concept, but I need to recall the exact statement.

Let me go through each option one by one to see which fits.

Option A says the mean of a large number of i.i.d. variables with finite mean and variance will approximate a normal distribution. That sounds familiar. I think CLT is about the distribution of sample means approaching normality, regardless of the population distribution.

Option B mentions the population being uniformly distributed. Wait, CLT applies even if the population isn't normal, right? So B seems too specific to uniform distribution, which isn't the general case.

Option C talks about the standard deviation of sample means approaching the population SD divided by the square root of n. That's more about the standard error, which is related but not the full CLT statement. CLT is about the shape of the distribution, not just the standard deviation.

Option D says if the population is normal, then as sample size increases, the sample mean distribution becomes normal. Well, if the population is already normal, the sample means will also be normal regardless of sample size. So D isn't capturing the essence of CLT, which is about the case when the population isn't normal.

Option E mentions the median instead of the mean. CLT is about the mean, not the median. So E is incorrect.

Option F says CLT refers to something else. I don't think so because the question is about identifying CLT, so F is probably wrong.

Option G talks about the median of sample means. Again, CLT is about the mean, not the median. So G is out.

Option H states that as sample size increases, the mean of sample means approaches the population mean. That's the Law of Large Numbers, not CLT. So H is incorrect.

Option I says variance of sample means converges to population variance. Again, that's about the standard error and LLN, not CLT.

Option J mentions the sum of variables following a normal distribution regardless of the original distribution. I thought CLT is about the average (mean) approaching normal, not the sum. The sum would actually have a variance that grows with n, so the distribution might not be normal. Wait, no—CLT usually refers to the mean. So J is talking about the sum, which might be incorrect.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. CLT typically states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches normal as n increases, regardless of the population distribution, provided the variables are i.i.d. with finite mean and variance.

So looking back, Option A says exactly that about the mean. Option J talks about the sum, which might be a different version, but I'm pretty sure CLT is about the mean.

Wait, but sometimes CLT is stated for the sum as well, because the mean is sum divided by n. So for large n, the sum would be approximately normal with mean nμ and variance nσ². But the way J is phrased, "sum ... regardless of original distribution" is correct because as n increases, the sum's distribution becomes normal. But I thought the standard CLT is about the mean. Hmm, now I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is asking for the central limit theorem. Both A and J could be correct, depending on how it's phrased. Let me check my notes.

From what I recall, the standard CLT is about the sample mean. So A is correct. J is talking about the sum, which is a form of CLT as well, but perhaps it's more specific. Wait, actually, the Lindey-Levy CLT states that the sum (properly standardized) converges to a normal distribution. So both A and J might be correct, but the question is which is the central limit theorem.

Wait, the question is about the CLT, and the options are A through J. The options are trying to test understanding.

Option A: Mean of sample means approaches normal.

Option J: Sum approaches normal.

Which one is the correct CLT statement? I think both are correct, but the standard statement is about the mean. Because when you take the mean, you're scaling the sum by 1/n, so the variance becomes σ²/n, leading to a normal distribution as n increases.

So the correct answer should be A, because it's about the mean of the sample, which is the standard CLT.

But wait, option J says the sum of variables follows normal regardless of the original distribution. That's also correct because the sum, when standardized, converges to normal. So which one is the answer?

Wait, the question is which is the CLT. Both A and J are correct in their own way. But I think the most standard statement is about the sample mean, so A is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: Mean of a large number of i.i.d. variables will approximately follow a normal distribution.

Option J: Sum of a large number of i.i.d. variables will follow a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution.

Wait, the original variables have finite mean and variance. So both are correct, but the question is about the mean.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think of the textbook definitions.

The Central Limit Theorem states that, given certain conditions, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. So that's A.

Option J is talking about the sum, which is another version, but perhaps less commonly referred to as the CLT. So I think A is the correct answer.

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that, given certain conditions, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is best captured by Option A, which accurately describes the mean of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with finite mean and variance approximating a normal distribution. While Option J also touches on a related aspect of the CLT regarding the sum of variables, the standard and most commonly referenced form of the CLT pertains to the mean, making Option A the correct choice.

Answer: A
