Question:

A 55-year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6 weeks. He had a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a Î²-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?

Options:

A: Decreasing myocardial contractility
B: Dilating the coronary arteries
C: Peripheral vasodilation
D: Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient with chest pain, and I need to figure out why a beta-blocker would help. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The patient is a 55-year-old man with substernal chest pain for six weeks, especially when he exerts himself. He had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) two months ago. He's taking nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He's a heavy smoker, two packs a day for 30 years. On exam, his heart sounds are normal, and there's no sign of carotid or femoral bruits, which are sounds that could indicate blockages in those arteries.

So, the question is asking why treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (beta-blocker) would improve his symptoms. The options are A through D.

First, I should recall what beta-blockers do. Beta-blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline (epinephrine) on the heart. They slow down the heart rate, reduce the force of the heart's contractions, and decrease the workload on the heart. This can help in several ways: reducing blood pressure, decreasing the heart's oxygen demand, and preventing arrhythmias.

Now, the patient's history is important. He had a heart attack two months ago. That suggests he has coronary artery disease (CAD). His current symptoms of chest pain on exertion could be angina, which is a sign that his heart isn't getting enough blood flow, possibly due to CAD.

He's taking nitroglycerin, which is a nitrate that dilates (expands) coronary arteries, increasing blood flow to the heart muscle. Aspirin is an antiplatelet, preventing blood clots, which is standard after a heart attack.

Beta-blockers are often used in the management of angina and after a heart attack. They help reduce the heart's workload, which in turn reduces the need for oxygen. So, if the heart isn't demanding as much oxygen, it might help alleviate the chest pain he's experiencing, especially during exertion when oxygen demand increases.

Looking at the options:

A: Decreasing myocardial contractility
Beta-blockers do decrease the strength of the heart's contractions. This would reduce the heart's workload and oxygen consumption. That sounds plausible.

B: Dilating the coronary arteries
Dilating coronary arteries is what nitroglycerin does. Beta-blockers don't primarily dilate coronary arteries; they reduce the heart's workload. So B is less likely.

C: Peripheral vasodilation
Vasodilation in the periphery would lower blood pressure, which could help the heart. But beta-blockers don't primarily cause peripheral vasodilation; they mainly affect the heart. Maybe in some cases, but it's not their main mechanism here.

D: Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs
That's the role of aspirin, an antiplatelet. Beta-blockers don't function this way, so D is probably incorrect.

So the main mechanism is A: Decreasing myocardial contractility, which reduces the heart's oxygen demand and can relieve angina symptoms.

I should also think about other possibilities. The patient's smoking is a risk factor, but that's more about continuing to cause vascular damage, not directly related to the mechanism of beta-blockers.

In summary, the beta-blocker's main effect here is to reduce the heart's workload and oxygen use, which would help his chest pain during exertion. So the correct answer is A.
</think>

The patient, a 55-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction and angina symptoms, would benefit from beta-blockers due to their ability to reduce myocardial contractility. This decreases the heart's oxygen demand, alleviating chest pain during exertion. Nitroglycerin and aspirin address other aspects of his condition, but beta-blockers specifically target reducing cardiac workload. 

Answer: A
