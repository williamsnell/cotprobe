Okay, so I've got this problem here about oxygen collected over water, and I need to figure out the volumes after drying and the volume of the water vapor removed. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the question says 200 mL of oxygen is collected over water at 25°C and 750 torr. Then it's dried at the same conditions, and I need to find the new volume. Also, the volume of the water vapor removed when it's kept at the same conditions.

Wait, when a gas is collected over water, the total pressure is the sum of the gas pressure and the water vapor pressure. Oh right, Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. So the oxygen is mixed with water vapor, and the total pressure is 750 torr. The vapor pressure of water at 25°C is given as 28.3 torr. So the partial pressure of oxygen must be the total minus the water vapor pressure.

So, P_total = P_O2 + P_H2O. Therefore, P_O2 = 750 - 28.3 = 721.7 torr. But wait, the collected volume is 200 mL under these conditions. Now, when the oxygen is dried, the water vapor is removed, so the pressure becomes just the oxygen's partial pressure, 721.7 torr, right?

But wait, no. Wait, when you dry the oxygen, you're removing the water vapor, so the pressure of the oxygen alone would be at 721.7 torr, but the total pressure in the container would drop because the vapor was part of it before. But no, wait, when you dry it, the volume changes because the pressure changes. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says after drying, the oxygen is at the same temperature and pressure conditions as before, which is 25°C and 750 torr. Wait, no, that's the original conditions. Wait, when you dry it, the pressure might change because the water vapor is removed. Or maybe the total pressure is adjusted. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Wait, when you collect the oxygen over water, the total pressure is 750 torr. When you dry it, you remove the water vapor, so the oxygen's pressure becomes the total pressure. Because after drying, the only gas present is oxygen. So the pressure of the oxygen would then be 750 torr again, because the total pressure is the same as before drying? Or does the pressure change?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of the ideal gas law. The initial volume is 200 mL at 750 torr, with a mix of O2 and H2O vapor. After removing H2O, the volume of O2 would change because the pressure might change if the amount of gas changes.

Wait, but the temperature is constant at 25°C. So we can use Boyle's Law, which states that P1 * V1 = P2 * V2 at constant temperature.

Wait, but which pressure are we considering? Initially, the pressure is 750 torr for the mixture. After drying, the pressure is just the oxygen's pressure, which is 721.7 torr (since 750 - 28.3 = 721.7). So the initial P1 is 750 torr, V1 is 200 mL. After drying, P2 is 721.7 torr, and we need to find V2.

So according to Boyle's Law, since temperature is constant, P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. So V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1.

Plugging in the numbers: V2 = (750 / 721.7) * 200 mL.

Let me calculate that: 750 / 721.7 is approximately 1.0394. Multiplying by 200 mL gives about 207.88 mL. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the moles of oxygen. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Since temperature and amount of oxygen are constant, P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

Wait, but in the initial state, the pressure of O2 is 721.7 torr, and the volume is 200 mL. After drying, the pressure of O2 would be the same as the total pressure, 750 torr, because the only gas present is O2 now. So P_initial (O2) is 721.7 torr, and V_initial is 200 mL. After drying, P_final (O2) is 750 torr. So using Boyle's Law again: V_final = V_initial * (P_initial / P_final) = 200 * (721.7 / 750) = 200 * 0.962266... ≈ 192.45 mL. Oh, that makes sense. So the volume after drying is about 192.45 mL.

Now, the second part is the volume of water vapor removed. The water vapor was initially in the 200 mL sample. The pressure of the water vapor is 28.3 torr, and the volume is 200 mL at 750 torr. When it's removed, what volume does it occupy at 25°C and 750 torr? Or wait, does it stay at the same temperature and pressure?

Wait, the problem says "what volume will be occupied by the water vapor removed from the oxygen if it is maintained at 25°C and 750 torr." So, the vapor is collected at those conditions. So the water vapor's pressure is 28.3 torr, and the temperature is 25°C. But wait, the pressure when it's removed—does it stay the same, or does it change?

Wait, when the water vapor is removed, it's now a separate gas. But when the problem says "maintained at 25°C and 750 torr," that's the conditions under which the vapor is measured. So the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is 28.3 torr, but when the vapor is collected, it's at 750 torr. Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the vapor's partial pressure is 28.3 torr, so when it's removed, the volume it occupies at the same temperature (25°C) but at the same pressure as before, which is 750 torr.

Wait, but wait, if the vapor was originally at 28.3 torr in a 200 mL container at 750 torr total pressure, when it's removed, how much volume would it occupy if it's maintained at 750 torr and 25°C? Because the vapor would expand to a larger volume if the pressure is kept the same as before, but wait, no, because when you remove it, you're taking that vapor and putting it somewhere else at 750 torr. So the initial pressure of the vapor was 28.3 torr in the same container of 200 mL. But when you isolate that vapor, it's at 750 torr, same as before. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the vapor pressure depends on temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ideal gas law for the water vapor. The number of moles of water vapor can be found from the initial conditions. Let me calculate that.

The initial pressure of water vapor is 28.3 torr. Using PV = nRT, n = PV/(RT). But since we're only interested in the volume when the vapor is removed and kept at 25°C and 750 torr, perhaps the volume can be found using the same number of moles, but under different conditions.

Wait, but wait, when the vapor is removed, the number of moles remains the same, right? Because we're just separating it. So the initial state of the vapor is P1 = 28.3 torr, V1 = 200 mL, T1 = 25°C. After removal, it's P2 = 750 torr, T2 = 25°C, V2 = ?

So using the combined gas law: (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. But since T1 and T2 are the same (25°C), they cancel out. So P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Therefore, V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1.

Plugging in the numbers: V2 = (28.3 / 750) * 200 mL. Let's calculate that. 28.3 divided by 750 is approximately 0.03773. Multiply by 200 mL gives about 7.546 mL. So approximately 7.55 mL.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the vapor pressure is 28.3 torr, which is the partial pressure. So when the vapor is removed, if it's maintained at 750 torr, that would imply that the pressure of the vapor alone is 750 torr, which might not be correct. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, no, the vapor was initially at 28.3 torr as part of the total pressure. When you remove it, you collect it separately, so its pressure is now 750 torr, same as before because that's the pressure it's maintained at. So the calculation I did earlier for the volume of the vapor would be correct, giving around 7.55 mL.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 192.45 mL and 7.55 mL. That matches what I calculated. So the dried oxygen would be about 192.45 mL, and the removed water vapor would be 7.55 mL. So the answer should be F.

The problem involves determining the volume of oxygen after drying and the volume of water vapor removed. Initially, oxygen is collected over water at 25°C and 750 torr, with the water vapor pressure at 28.3 torr. Using Dalton's Law, the partial pressure of oxygen is calculated as:

\[
P_{\text{O}_2} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 750 - 28.3 = 721.7 \, \text{torr}.
\]

When the oxygen is dried, the water vapor is removed, and the oxygen's pressure becomes the total pressure (750 torr). Using Boyle's Law (\(P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2\)) for the oxygen:

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{P_1}{P_2} = 200 \cdot \frac{721.7}{750} \approx 192.45 \, \text{mL}.
\]

For the water vapor, its initial partial pressure is 28.3 torr in a 200 mL container. When removed, the vapor is maintained at 25°C and 750 torr. Using the relationship \(P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2\) for the vapor:

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{P_1}{P_2} = 200 \cdot \frac{28.3}{750} \approx 7.55 \, \text{mL}.
\]

Thus, the dried oxygen occupies approximately 192.45 mL, and the removed water vapor occupies 7.55 mL. The correct answer is:

**F: 192.45ml and 7.55ml**

Answer: F
