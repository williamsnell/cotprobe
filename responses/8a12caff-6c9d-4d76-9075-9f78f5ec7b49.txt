Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about a CPA's obligations when they discover an error after filing tax returns. Let me break it down step by step.

The question states that a CPA prepares income tax returns for a client. After the client signs and mails the returns, the CPA finds an error. According to Treasury Circular 230, what must the CPA do?

First, I need to recall what Treasury Circular 230 says about CPAs and their responsibilities regarding tax returns. I remember that Circular 230 sets the rules for practice before the IRS, including duties related to tax return accuracy and correcting mistakes.

So, the CPA has already prepared and the client signed and mailed the return. Now, the CPA found an error. What's the proper course of action?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Resign and cooperate with the successor. That seems more about ending the engagement, but not necessarily the first step when an error is found.

Option B: Prepare an amended return immediately and send to the client. That makes sense because an error needs correction, but does the CPA have to wait for the client to sign again?

Option C: Inform the client's legal counsel. I'm not sure if that's required. It might depend on the severity, but I don't recall that being a first step.

Option D: Prepare an amended return within 30 days. I think there's a time frame for amending returns, but I'm not certain it's 30 days. I believe the IRS allows filing an amended return within a certain period, but I'm not sure if it's 30 days from discovery or from the original filing date.

Option E: Advise the client promptly. This sounds like a good first step. The CPA should inform the client so they can take action, but perhaps there's more required than just advising.

Option F: Take responsibility and pay additional taxes. I'm not sure if the CPA is liable to pay; maybe the client is responsible for the tax implications, but the CPA should correct the error.

Option G: Document the error. Yes, CPAs are required to keep records, so documenting is important, but it's probably not the primary action needed here.

Option H: Charge an additional fee. That doesn't seem right; the CPA should correct the mistake without charging extra unless it's part of the service agreement.

Option I: Inform the IRS directly. I don't think the CPA should notify the IRS without the client's consent, as the client is the taxpayer.

Option J: Ignore the error. No, definitely not. CPAs have a duty to correct their mistakes.

Now, focusing on the main obligations. Under Circular 230, a CPA must correct errors promptly. If the return has already been filed, the CPA should inform the client and assist in amending it. So, the CPA should advise the client immediately about the error (Option E) and then take steps to correct it, like preparing an amended return.

Wait, does the CPA have to prepare the amended return themselves? Or can they advise the client to do it? I think the CPA should prepare it because they are the ones who made the error, so they have a responsibility to correct it.

But looking at the options, Option E is about advising the client, and Option B is about preparing the amended return. However, the question is what the CPA must do according to Circular 230. I think the CPA is required to inform the client promptly (Option E) and then take steps to correct it, which would involve preparing an amended return.

But the options are singular actions. The question asks what the CPA "must" do. So, the primary action is to inform the client, which is E. However, another option might be more specific.

Wait, looking again, Option B says "immediately" prepare an amended return and send it to the client. But the client has already signed and mailed the original. Can the CPA just send an amended one without the client's signature? Or does the client need to sign again?

I think the CPA should inform the client first (Option E), then prepare the amended return, have the client sign, and file it. So the initial step is to advise the client.

Alternatively, some sources say that under Circular 230, if the CPA discovers an error after the return is filed, they must promptly inform the client and take steps to correct it, which would include preparing an amended return.

But the options don't have both E and B as correct. The question is which one is the required action.

Wait, I think the key is that the CPA must promptly advise the client of the error. That's a clear requirement. So E is correct. Additionally, they would then prepare the amended return, but the question is asking what they must do according to Circular 230, which is to inform the client.

The correct answer is E: Promptly advise the client of the error. According to Treasury Circular 230, when a CPA discovers an error after a tax return has been filed, they must promptly inform the client to ensure the mistake is corrected. While preparing an amended return is necessary, the primary obligation is to advise the client immediately.

Answer: E
