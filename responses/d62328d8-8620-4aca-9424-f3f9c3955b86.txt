Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about fruit flies. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the question is about mapping distance between two genes: black body and cinnabar eyes. I remember that mapping distance in genetics refers to the percentage of crossing over between two genes on a chromosome. It's usually measured in map units, where 1 map unit equals 1% recombination.

So, the setup is that a homozygous wild-type fly was mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. Then the F1 was mated to another fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. The offspring results are given: 90 wild-type, 92 black and cinnabar, 9 black with wild-type eyes, and 9 wild-type body with cinnabar eyes.

Wait, let me break this down. The parents are a wild-type (homozygous, so genotype BB cn+ cn+?) and a black, cinnabar fly (bb cn cn). So when they mate, the F1 would get B from one parent and b from the other, but wait, no—wait, the wild-type is BB, and the other is bb. So the F1 would be Bb for body color. Similarly, for the eye color, the wild-type is cn+ cn+, and the other is cn cn, so F1 would be cn+ cn. So the F1 is Bb cn+ cn.

Wait, but wait, the F1 is described as heterozygous. Then this F1 is mated to a black and cinnabar fly, which is bb cn cn. So the cross is Bb cn+ cn (F1) × bb cn cn.

I need to figure out the possible gametes each parent can produce. Let's think about the parents' genotypes.

Parent 1 (F1): Bb cn+ cn. So for body color gene, it's B and b. For eye color, it's cn+ and cn. Assuming these two genes are on the same chromosome (as the question is about map distance), the F1's genotype would be B cn+ and b cn. So when it produces gametes, without crossing over, it would give B cn+ and b cn gametes. But if there's a crossover between these two genes, it can produce B cn and b cn+ gametes.

Parent 2: bb cn cn. So for each gene, the gametes would be b and cn.

So the possible gametes from F1 are: B cn+ and b cn, plus any recombinant gametes. The possible gametes from the other parent (bb cn cn) are all b and cn.

Wait, but let me double-check. The F1 is Bb for body and cn+ cn for eyes. So the F1's genotype is B cn+ on one chromosome and b cn on the other. So when it produces gametes, without crossing over, each gamete gets either B cn+ or b cn. But if there's a crossover between B and cn+, the gametes would be B cn and b cn+.

So the gametes from F1 are:

- B cn+ (no crossover)
- b cn (no crossover)
- B cn (crossover)
- b cn+ (crossover)

Assuming the two genes are linked, the recombination frequency depends on the map distance. Let me denote the map distance as m (in map units). So the probability of crossover is m/100.

The gamete types and their frequencies would be:

- B cn+ : (100 - m)/2%
- b cn : (100 - m)/2%
- B cn : m/2%
- b cn+ : m/2%

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in a heterozygote, each gamete gets one allele from each homolog. So the F1's gametes would be:

- B cn+ : (100 - m)/2%
- b cn : (100 - m)/2%
- B cn : m/2%
- b cn+ : m/2%

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the F1 fly's gamete production. Let me model the F1 as having chromosomes: one with B and cn+, the other with b and cn. So when gametes are formed, without crossing over, each gets either B cn+ or b cn. If there's a crossover, the gametes would be B cn and b cn+.

So the probability of each gamete type is:

- B cn+ : (100 - m)/2%
- b cn : (100 - m)/2%
- B cn : m/2%
- b cn+ : m/2%

Because without crossing over, the gametes are 50% each, and with crossing over, they're 50% each of the recombinant types.

Now, the other parent is bb cn cn. So this parent can only contribute b and cn. So the gametes from this parent are:

- b (for body) and cn (for eyes).

So when we cross F1 × bb cn cn, the offspring's genotype for each gene depends on the combination of gametes.

Let me tabulate the possible offspring:

F1 gamete | Parent gamete | Body genotype | Eye genotype
--- | --- | --- | ---
B cn+ | b cn | Bb | cn+ cn
b cn | b cn | bb | cn cn
B cn | b cn | Bb | cn cn
b cn+ | b cn | Bb | cn+ cn

Wait, no, let me double-check. For each gene, the F1 gamete provides one allele, and the parent provides another.

For body:

- F1 gamete B: combines with parent's b → Bb (wild-type)
- F1 gamete b: combines with parent's b → bb (black)
- F1 gamete B: same as above
- F1 gamete b: same as above

For eyes:

- F1 gamete cn+: combines with parent's cn → cn+ cn (wild-type)
- F1 gamete cn: combines with parent's cn → cn cn (cinnabar)
- F1 gamete cn: same as above
- F1 gamete cn+: same as above

Wait, no, let me get this correctly. The parent has genotype bb cn cn. So gametes are each b and cn.

So for each offspring:

1. If F1 gamete is B cn+:
   - Body: B (from F1) + b (from parent) → Bb (wild-type)
   - Eyes: cn+ (from F1) + cn (from parent) → cn+ cn (wild-type)

2. If F1 gamete is b cn:
   - Body: b + b → bb (black)
   - Eyes: cn + cn → cn cn (cinnabar)

3. If F1 gamete is B cn:
   - Body: B + b → Bb (wild-type)
   - Eyes: cn + cn → cn cn (cinnabar)

4. If F1 gamete is b cn+:
   - Body: b + b → bb (black)
   - Eyes: cn+ + cn → cn+ cn (wild-type)

Wait, no, wait. The F1 gamete for B and b refers to the body gene, and for cn+ and cn refers to the eye gene. So each gamete carries one allele for each gene.

So the possible offspring combinations are:

- From F1 gamete B cn+ and parent gamete b cn:
   Body: B + b → Bb (wild-type)
   Eyes: cn+ + cn → cn+ cn (wild-type)
   So phenotype: wild-type.

- From F1 gamete b cn and parent gamete b cn:
   Body: b + b → bb (black)
   Eyes: cn + cn → cinnabar
   Phenotype: black and cinnabar.

- From F1 gamete B cn and parent gamete b cn:
   Body: B + b → Bb (wild-type)
   Eyes: cn + cn → cinnabar
   Phenotype: wild-type body, cinnabar eyes.

- From F1 gamete b cn+ and parent gamete b cn:
   Body: b + b → bb (black)
   Eyes: cn+ + cn → cn+ cn (wild-type)
   Phenotype: black body, wild-type eyes.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the results are:

90 wild-type (probably both traits wild)
92 black and cinnabar (both recessive)
9 black and wild-type eyes
9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes

Wait, so that's:

- Wild-type: 90
- Black and cinnabar:92
- Black and wild-type:9
- Wild-type and cinnabar:9

So that's roughly a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but not exactly. Let me check. The total is 90 +92 +9+9 = 200.

If the ratio is approximately 90:92:9:9, which is roughly 1:1:1:1, but slightly off. Hmm, but wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in how the phenotypes are categorized. Let me re-examine.

The F1 is Bb cn+ cn. So when mated to bb cn cn, the possible F2 phenotypes are:

- Wild-type body (Bb) and wild-type eyes (cn+ cn): from B cn+ gamete (no crossover) × b cn → Bb cn+ cn.

- Black body (bb) and cinnabar eyes (cn cn): from b cn gamete (no crossover) × b cn → bb cn cn.

- Wild-type body (Bb) and cinnabar eyes (cn cn): from B cn gamete (crossover) × b cn → Bb cn cn.

- Black body (bb) and wild-type eyes (cn+ cn): from b cn+ gamete (crossover) × b cn → bb cn+ cn.

So the phenotypic ratio expected would be based on the gamete frequencies.

The gamete frequencies are:

- B cn+ : (100 - m)/2%
- b cn : (100 - m)/2%
- B cn : m/2%
- b cn+ : m/2%

So the offspring phenotypes would be:

- Wild-type (B cn+): [(100 - m)/2%] × 1 (since the other parent contributes b and cn)
   So this is (100 - m)/2% chance.

- Black and cinnabar (b cn): [(100 - m)/2%] × 1
   So same as above.

- Wild-type body, cinnabar eyes (B cn): [m/2%] × 1
   So m/2%.

- Black body, wild-type eyes (b cn+): [m/2%] × 1
   So m/2%.

So the expected ratio is:

[(100 - m)/2 : (100 - m)/2 : m/2 : m/2] → which simplifies to (100 - m) : (100 - m) : m : m → or, combining the first two and last two, (100 - m + m) : (100 - m + m) ? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me re-express this.

The F2 phenotypic ratio is:

Wild-type : Black & Cinnabar : Wild-type body & Cinnabar : Black & Wild-type

Which corresponds to:

(100 - m)/2 : (100 - m)/2 : m/2 : m/2

Simplify this by dividing each term by (1/2):

(100 - m) : (100 - m) : m : m

So the ratio is (100 - m) : (100 - m) : m : m → which can be grouped as [(100 - m) + m] : [(100 - m) + m] → 100 : 100, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the four categories are in the ratio (100 - m) : (100 - m) : m : m, which simplifies to (100 - m) : m for the first two and the last two.

Wait, but looking at the observed data:

Wild-type:90

Black & Cinnabar:92

Wild-type body & Cinnabar:9

Black & Wild-type:9

So the observed ratio is approximately 90:92:9:9, which is roughly (90+92): (9+9) → 182:18 → which is about 10:1, but that doesn't match the expected. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the expected ratio is in a 3:3:1:1 ratio, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the recombinant frequency and use that to find the map distance.

Wait, the recombinant phenotypes are the ones where the alleles have been exchanged: so black with wild-type eyes and wild-type body with cinnabar eyes. These are the two recombinant phenotypes. The other two (wild-type and black & cinnabar) are the parental types.

In the observed data, the parental types are 90 and 92, which sum to 182. The recombinant types are 9 and 9, summing to 18.

So the recombinant frequency (RF) is (18)/(182 + 18) ) × 100 = (18/200)*100 = 9%.

Wait, but that can't be right because 18 out of 200 is 9%, which would make the map distance 9 map units. Looking at the options, H is 9 map units.

But wait, let me make sure. The map distance is the same as the recombination frequency, right? So if recombinant gametes are 9%, then the map distance is 9 map units.

But wait, another approach: the number of recombinant offspring is 9 +9=18. The total is 200. So recombinant frequency is 18/200 = 0.09, or 9%.

So the map distance should be 9 map units. Looking at the options, H is 9.

Wait, but let me think again. The F1 fly is Bb cn+ cn. So the gametes it produces are B cn+ (non-recombinant), b cn (non-recombinant), B cn (recombinant), and b cn+ (recombinant). The recombinant gametes are B cn and b cn+. The percentage of recombinant gametes is m, which would lead to recombinant offspring.

So the recombinant gametes from F1 are m% in total. So the recombinant offspring would be (m/2) + (m/2) = m% of the total.

Wait, in the offspring, the recombinant phenotypes are 9 each, so 18 total. So 18/200 = 9% is RF. So m is 9.

Thus, the map distance is 9 map units. So the answer should be H: Nine map units.

The question involves determining the map distance between the genes for black body (b) and cinnabar eyes (cn) in fruit flies. The F1 generation from a cross between a homozygous wild-type fly (BB cn⁺ cn⁺) and a black, cinnabar-eyed fly (bb cn cn) is heterozygous (Bb cn⁺ cn). This F1 fly is then mated to a black, cinnabar-eyed fly (bb cn cn), producing offspring with the following phenotypes: 90 wild-type, 92 black and cinnabar, 9 black with wild-type eyes, and 9 wild-type body with cinnabar eyes.

To calculate the map distance, we analyze the recombinant offspring. Recombinant phenotypes are those where the alleles for body color and eye color are exchanged: black with wild-type eyes and wild-type body with cinnabar eyes. The total number of recombinant offspring is 9 + 9 = 18. The total number of offspring is 200. The recombinant frequency (RF) is:

\[
RF = \frac{\text{Number of recombinant offspring}}{\text{Total number of offspring}} \times 100 = \frac{18}{200} \times 100 = 9\%.
\]

The map distance is equal to the recombinant frequency, so the map distance between the black body and cinnabar eye genes is **9 map units**.
