Okay, so I have this question about selecting a manager, and I need to figure out the correct answer from options A to J. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question is asking about the selection procedures one would use to choose a manager. I need to discuss my answer, but for now, I'll focus on evaluating the given options to see which one makes the most sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Marital status, Place of birth, Favorite color. Hmm, these seem irrelevant. Marital status doesn't indicate managerial skills. Place of birth is about geography, not abilities. Favorite color is personal preference, so this doesn't make sense for selection.

Option B: Personality test results, Social media presence, Volunteer work history. Personality tests can give insights into traits, which is useful. Social media presence might show how they present themselves publicly, but it's a bit intrusive. Volunteer work history shows community involvement, which is positive but maybe not the top criteria.

Option C: Social maturity and breadth, Intelligence, Motivation and drive for achievement, Human relations development, Leadership style. This sounds comprehensive. Social maturity relates to how well they handle social interactions. Intelligence is crucial for decision-making. Motivation drives their performance. Human relations development shows they can work with others. Leadership style indicates how they manage teams. All these factors are relevant for a manager.

Option D: Height and weight, Zodiac sign, Shoe size. These are clearly irrelevant. Physical attributes and astrology don't predict management abilities.

So, considering all options, Option C includes qualities that are essential for a manager. They need to be intelligent, motivated, have good social skills, understand human relations, and have a solid leadership style. These factors directly impact their ability to lead and manage effectively.

I think the answer is C because it covers the necessary competencies for a managerial role, unlike the other options which include irrelevant or less important factors.
