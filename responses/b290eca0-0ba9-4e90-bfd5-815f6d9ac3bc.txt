Okay, so I have this question about Saudi Arabia's military spending as a percentage of their GDP in 2017. I'm a bit rusty on my exact numbers, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that Saudi Arabia is a major player in the Middle East and has a big military presence. They've been involved in various conflicts and have a large defense budget. I think their spending is quite significant compared to other countries, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact percentage.

I recall that globally, military spending varies widely. The US, for instance, spends a much higher percentage, like around 3-4% of GDP. But Saudi Arabia is different because they're in a region with a lot of geopolitical tensions. I've heard terms like "Saudi military expenditure" before, but I don't remember the exact figure.

I think about GDP percentages. If the options include 1%, 6%, 15%, 0.5%, 12%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 8%, and 2%, I can try to eliminate some. 15% seems high. The US is around 4%, so 15% would be triple that, which might be too much for a country's entire GDP. But maybe for a smaller country, it's possible. I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember reading that Saudi Arabia's military spending is a significant chunk of their budget. Maybe around 10% or so. But I'm not certain. Let me think about other sources. I've heard that in the past decade, Saudi Arabia has increased its military spending due to regional threats, like from Iran. So maybe their spending has gone up.

Another angle: I know that the Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, spend a larger portion of their GDP on defense compared to other regions. For example, I think Israel's is around 6-7%. So maybe Saudi Arabia is in that ballpark or a bit higher.

Looking at the options again, 10% is an option (H), and 8% is also there (I). I'm trying to remember if it's 10% or 8%. I think I've heard that in 2017, Saudi Arabia's military expenditure was about 10% of their GDP. That seems plausible because they're a major spender in that region.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes GDP figures can be tricky because they're based on PPP or nominal terms. But the question is about the share, so it's a percentage, so it should be consistent regardless of that.

I also remember that in 2017, Saudi Arabia was dealing with some internal issues and economic challenges, like low oil prices. But despite that, their military spending remained high because of security concerns. So maybe they kept it around 10%.

Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another country. Maybe it's not 10%. Let me think again. I've heard that the UAE spends around 7%, and maybe Saudi Arabia is a bit higher. So 8% or 10%.

I'm still leaning towards 10%, but I'm not 100% sure. Another way to approach this: I think the SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) reports on military expenditure. According to their data from a few years ago, Saudi Arabia was one of the top spenders in the Middle East, often around 10% of GDP.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is H: 10%.

The correct answer is H: 10%.
