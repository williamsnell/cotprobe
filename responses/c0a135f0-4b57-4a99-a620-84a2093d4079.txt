Question:

What is the CPI ? How is it different from the MMPI ?

Options:

A: CPI stands for Clinical Psychopathy Index, a variant of the MMPI
B: CPI is a clinical tool for diagnosing mental illnesses
C: CPI is a cognitive performance test, unlike the MMPI which assesses personality
D: The CPI is a projective test that measures subconscious traits, while the MMPI is an objective test
E: CPI is primarily used for educational testing, whereas MMPI is used in clinical psychology
F: CPI is a measure of inflation, whereas MMPI is a personality assessment
G: The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) is an objective personality inventory developed for use with less clinical less deviant groups of subjects than the MMPI.
H: CPI is used to measure gross psychopathy
I: CPI and MMPI are the same
J: CPI is a newer version of the MMPI with updated scales and norms

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the CPI and MMPI. I'm not too familiar with these terms, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by breaking down what each acronym might stand for.

CPI and MMPI are both psychological assessments, I believe. I remember MMPI stands for Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. It's a widely used personality test that helps assess various aspects of personality and psychopathology. It's often used in clinical settings to evaluate mental disorders.

Now, what about CPI? I'm not as sure. The question is asking how CPI is different from MMPI. Let's look at the options.

Option A says CPI is a variant of MMPI. Hmm, I don't think that's correct because I've heard that MMPI and CPI are different but related. They might have similar purposes but are not exactly the same.

Option B suggests CPI is for diagnosing mental illnesses. I think MMPI is more about assessing personality traits and issues, so maybe CPI is similar but perhaps more focused on something else, like normal personality traits.

Option C says CPI is a cognitive test, while MMPI assesses personality. That doesn't sound right because MMPI is definitely a personality assessment, and I don't think CPI is a cognitive test. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says CPI is a projective test, while MMPI is objective. Wait, projective tests like the Rorschach are different from self-report inventories. MMPI is a self-report inventory, so it's objective. I'm not sure if CPI is projective or not. I think both are self-report, so D might be incorrect.

Option E claims CPI is for educational testing. No, I think both are used more in clinical or psychological evaluations, not so much for education. So E is unlikely.

Option F says CPI measures inflation and MMPI is personality. That can't be right. CPI as inflation doesn't make sense here; that's a different CPI. So F is wrong.

Option G: The California Psychological Inventory is an objective personality inventory for less clinical, less deviant groups. That rings a bell. I remember that the MMPI is used for clinical populations, whereas the CPI is more for normal or less disturbed individuals. So G might be the correct answer.

Option H says CPI measures gross psychopathy. I'm not sure about that. Psychopathy scales might be part of both, but H doesn't explain the difference between them, so maybe not the best choice.

Option I says they're the same. That's probably not true since they are different tests.

Option J says CPI is a newer version of MMPI. I think they are both well-established but developed separately. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G. The CPI is an objective personality inventory designed for less clinical or deviant groups compared to the MMPI, which is more for clinical use.

The correct answer is G. The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) is an objective personality inventory developed for use with less clinical, less deviant groups of subjects than the MMPI.

Answer: G
