Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem about a gas turbine expanding air. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem states that air enters the turbine at 150 lb_f/in², 150°F, and a velocity of 300 ft/sec. It exits at 50 lb_f/in², 40°F, and 200 ft/sec. We're told to assume no heat losses and that air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. We need to find the reversible work per pound of air and the actual work done by the turbine. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that for a turbine, the work done is related to the change in enthalpy. Since the process is adiabatic (no heat losses), the first law simplifies to W = h_in - h_out, where h is specific enthalpy. But wait, that's for a reversible process, right? So that should give me the reversible work.

But the actual work might be different because the process could be irreversible. Oh wait, no, the problem says the expansion is done in a gas turbine. Wait, but the question mentions both reversible work and actual work. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate both. Alternatively, perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible work because the turbine is operating reversibly? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the turbine is operating under some inefficiency, so the actual work is less than the reversible. But wait, in the problem statement, it's not stated that the turbine has any inefficiency. Wait, no, the problem says to calculate the reversible work and the actual work done by the turbine, implying that perhaps the actual work is different. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the turbine is a steady flow device, so the actual work is the same as the reversible work because it's operating reversibly. But that doesn't seem right, because usually, turbines have an isentropic (reversible) process and actual processes may have irreversibilities leading to less work. But the problem doesn't give any efficiency, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible because it's a turbine, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the actual work is calculated using the actual exit conditions, but since the process is adiabatic, maybe the work is the same as the change in enthalpy. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible work because the process is adiabatic and steady flow, so W = h_in - h_out. Hmm, but then why are there two different work values mentioned in the options? Maybe I'm missing something about the velocities.

Oh, right! Because the problem includes velocity changes, I need to account for the velocity head in the energy equation. So the energy balance for a steady flow process (like a turbine) is:

h_in + (V_in)^2 / 2 = h_out + (V_out)^2 / 2 + W

Because the potential energy changes are negligible, and heat loss is zero. So rearranging, W = h_in - h_out + (V_in² - V_out²)/(2*g)

Wait, so that's the actual work done. But wait, the reversible work would be under ideal conditions, perhaps assuming no friction or other losses, so maybe that's different? Or perhaps the reversible process already accounts for the velocity change in the same way. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing concepts here.

Wait, maybe I should first compute the reversible work using the ideal gas tables, considering the temperature change and pressure change, and then compute the actual work using the actual exit conditions, including the velocity change. Alternatively, perhaps the reversible work is calculated without considering the velocity change, and the actual work includes it. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Let me start by calculating the change in enthalpy. Since air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats, the change in enthalpy depends only on the temperature change. So h_in - h_out = c_p (T_out - T_in). Wait, no, that would be h_out - h_in = c_p (T_out - T_in). So the work done would be h_in - h_out = c_p (T_in - T_out).

Wait, but I need the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, for air. I remember that at around atmospheric conditions, c_p for air is approximately 0.24 Btu/lbm·°R. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So, the temperatures are given in Fahrenheit. I need to convert them to Rankine for the calculation. So T_in = 150°F + 459.67 = 609.67 °R, and T_out = 40°F + 459.67 = 499.67 °R.

So the change in temperature is T_in - T_out = 609.67 - 499.67 = 110 °R.

So h_in - h_out = c_p * (T_in - T_out) = 0.24 Btu/lbm·°R * 110 °R = 26.4 Btu/lbm. So the reversible work would be 26.4 Btu/lbm. Wait, but that's the change in enthalpy. But in the energy equation, the work done by the turbine is h_in - h_out, right? So that's 26.4 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but that's without considering the kinetic energy change. So the actual work done by the turbine would include the change in kinetic energy as well. So the actual work W_act is calculated using the energy equation:

W_act = h_in - h_out + (V_in² - V_out²)/(2*g)

Wait, but what is g? I think it's the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 32.174 ft/s². So let's compute the velocity terms.

V_in is 300 ft/s, V_out is 200 ft/s.

So (V_in² - V_out²) = (300^2 - 200^2) = (90000 - 40000) = 50000 (ft²/s²).

Divide by (2*g) where g=32.174 ft/s².

So (50000)/(2*32.174) = 50000/(64.348) ≈ 777.3 lb_f/lbm (since 1 lbf = 32.174 lbm·ft/s², so the units would work out). Wait, but let me check the units. Let me make sure I'm calculating this correctly.

The term (V^2)/2 per unit mass is (ft²/s²) per lbm. To convert this to Btu/lbm, I need to use the conversion factor. 1 Btu ≈ 778.169 ft·lbf. So let's compute each part.

First, calculate the kinetic energy term in ft·lbf/lbm:

( V_in^2 - V_out^2 ) / (2 * g) = (300^2 - 200^2) / (2 * 32.174) = (90000 - 40000) / 64.348 ≈ 50000 / 64.348 ≈ 777.3 ft·lbf/lbm.

Now, convert this to Btu/lbm:

777.3 ft·lbf/lbm * (1 Btu / 778.169 ft·lbf) ≈ 777.3 / 778.169 ≈ 1.00 Btu/lbm.

So the kinetic energy term is approximately +1.00 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but since V_in is higher than V_out, (V_in^2 - V_out^2) is positive, so the work done by the turbine increases by this amount. So the actual work W_act = (h_in - h_out) + (V_in² - V_out²)/(2g) = 26.4 Btu/lbm + 1.00 Btu/lbm = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but that would make the actual work 27.4 Btu/lbm, and the reversible work is 26.4 Btu/lbm. But looking at the options, the reversible work and actual work have to match one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option H: Reversible work: 27.4 Btu/lbm, Actual work:42.2 Btu/lbm. No, that's not matching. Option F: Reversible work:26.4, Actual:42.2. Wait, but I just calculated the actual work as 27.4, which would be the sum of 26.4 +1.00. So the actual work is 27.4 Btu/lbm, and the reversible work is 26.4 Btu/lbm. Wait, but none of the options have Reversible 26.4 and Actual 27.4. Let me check the options again:

A: 42.2, 27.4

B: 15,20

C:30.5,15.3

D:18.7,25.2

E:50,32.5

F:26.4,42.2

G:14.8,1

H:27.4,42.2

I:22.5,35

J:35,22

Hmm, so according to my calculation, the reversible work is 26.4 Btu/lbm, and the actual work is 27.4 Btu/lbm. But looking at the options, none of them have both 26.4 and 27.4. The closest is option F: Reversible 26.4, Actual 42.2. But that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake in the velocity term?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign. Let me think again. The work done by the turbine is when the fluid is doing work on the turbine, so the energy equation is:

h_in + (V_in)^2/(2g) = h_out + (V_out)^2/(2g) + W_act

So rearranged, W_act = h_in - h_out + (V_in^2 - V_out^2)/(2g)

We calculated h_in - h_out as 26.4 Btu/lbm, and the velocity term as +1.00 Btu/lbm, so W_act = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But let me double-check the velocity term. The formula is:

KE = (V^2)/(2g) per unit mass.

So V_in^2 = 300^2 = 90,000

V_out^2 = 200^2 = 40,000

Difference is 50,000.

Divided by (2 * 32.174) = 64.348.

So 50,000 / 64.348 = 777.3 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu: 777.3 / 778.169 ≈ 1.00 Btu/lbm.

So that's correct. So W_act = 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But the options don't have that combination. Let me see if I maybe misapplied the energy equation. Wait, perhaps I should have considered the work as the turbine doing work on the surroundings, so the actual work is W = h_in + (V_in^2)/(2g) - h_out - (V_out^2)/(2g), but that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the static temperatures and considered stagnation properties? Wait, no, because the problem gives static temperatures and static pressures, and the turbine operates under steady flow conditions. So the energy equation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the enthalpy change. Let me recheck that.

h_in - h_out = c_p (T_in - T_out)

c_p for air is 0.24 Btu/lbm·°R.

T_in = 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 °R

T_out = 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 °R

Difference is 110 °R.

So 0.24 * 110 = 26.4 Btu/lbm. That seems correct.

So the reversible work is 26.4 Btu/lbm, and the actual work is 27.4 Btu/lbm. But looking at the options again, none of them have that combination. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the reversible work and then the actual work is the same as the reversible because the process is isentropic, but that doesn't make sense because the actual work would include the velocity term.

Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the reversible and actual work. Let me think again. The reversible work would be the maximum possible work, which would be under ideal, frictionless conditions. But in reality, the actual work might be less because of irreversibilities. But in the energy equation, the actual work includes the kinetic energy change, so W_act is higher than the reversible work.

Wait, but in this problem, the process is adiabatic, so the actual work done by the turbine is the change in enthalpy plus the kinetic energy change. So the actual work is higher than the reversible work.

But according to the options, option F has Reversible 26.4 and Actual 42.2, which is higher. But in my calculation, Actual is only 27.4, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the stagnation temperatures instead. Because in a turbine, the stagnation temperature accounts for the kinetic energy. So maybe I should calculate the stagnation temperatures and then find the enthalpy change.

Stagnation temperature T0 is given by T0 = T + V^2/(2gc_p), but wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, the stagnation enthalpy is h + V²/(2g) = h0.

So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the stagnation enthalpy at the inlet and outlet, then find the work done as the difference in stagnation enthalpy.

So the energy equation for a steady flow process without heat transfer is:

h_in + V_in²/(2g) = h_out + V_out²/(2g) + W_act

Which can be rearranged to W_act = (h_in + V_in²/(2g)) - (h_out + V_out²/(2g)) )

So W_act = (h0_in - h0_out), where h0 is the stagnation enthalpy.

So the actual work is the difference in stagnation enthalpy. But the reversible work would be the difference in static enthalpy, h_in - h_out, which is 26.4 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but that would mean the actual work includes the stagnation change. Let me compute that.

h0_in = h_in + (V_in^2)/(2g c_p)

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing the formula. The correct formula for stagnation enthalpy is h0 = h + V^2/(2g). So for each state:

h0_in = h_in + V_in²/(2g)

h0_out = h_out + V_out²/(2g)

Then, the work done W_act = h0_in - h0_out

So let's compute h0_in and h0_out.

We know h_in - h_out = 26.4 Btu/lbm.

Now, the velocity terms:

V_in^2 = 300^2 = 90,000 ft²/s²

V_out^2 = 200^2 = 40,000 ft²/s²

So V_in^2 - V_out^2 = 50,000 ft²/s².

Divide by (2 * 32.174) ft/s² gives 50,000 / 64.348 ≈ 777.3 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu/lbm: 777.3 / 778.169 ≈ 1.00 Btu/lbm.

So h0_in - h0_out = (h_in - h_out) + (V_in² - V_out²)/(2g) = 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

So W_act = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But again, I'm not seeing this combination in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at option H: Reversible work: 27.4, Actual:42.2. That can't be right because the reversible work should be the static change, which is 26.4.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the actual work in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the work using the specific volume and pressure changes without considering temperature. But that doesn't make sense because air is an ideal gas, and enthalpy depends on temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity term. Let me check the units again.

The term (V^2)/(2g) is in (ft²/s²)/(ft/s²) = ft. So that would be in feet, but when you multiply by 1/lbm, it's ft·lbf/lbm. Then converting to Btu/lbm.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the specific kinetic energy per unit mass, which is (V^2)/(2g) in (ft²/s²) per lbm. Then, since 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf, I need to convert ft²/s² to ft·lbf.

Wait, another approach: 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf.

The kinetic energy term is (V^2)/(2g) per unit mass, which is in (ft²/s²)/lbm.

But to convert ft²/s² to ft·lbf/lbm, we can use the fact that 1 lbf = 32.174 lbm·ft/s².

So 1 ft²/s² = 1 ft·(ft/s²) = 1 ft * (1 lbf / (32.174 lbm)).

So (ft²/s²) = ft * (lbf / lbm) / 32.174.

Thus, (V^2)/(2g) in ft²/s² per lbm is:

(300^2)/(2*32.174) = 90,000 / 64.348 ≈ 1400 ft²/s² per lbm.

Wait, no, that can't be right because earlier I had 777.3 ft·lbf/lbm. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for kinetic energy in Btu/lbm directly.

Let me compute the velocity term again:

(V_in^2 - V_out^2) = 50,000 ft²/s².

Divide by (2 * 32.174) = 64.348 to get ft·lbf/lbm.

So 50,000 / 64.348 ≈ 777.3 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu/lbm: 777.3 / 778.169 ≈ 1.00 Btu/lbm.

So the kinetic energy change adds 1.00 Btu/lbm to the work.

So W_act = 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But the options don't have this combination. The closest is option F: Reversible work 26.4, Actual 42.2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the pressure work term. Because in a turbine, the work is also related to the pressure drop. But I thought that was already accounted for in the enthalpy change. Let me think again.

Enthalpy for an ideal gas is h = u + P/v, where u is internal energy and v is specific volume. So when calculating the work, the pressure-volume work is already included in the enthalpy change. So perhaps I don't need to add anything else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the work done per pound of air, considering both the enthalpy change and the kinetic energy change. So that would give W_act = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the enthalpy change.

Wait, let me check the enthalpy change again. The temperature change is 110 °R, c_p is 0.24 Btu/lbm·°R, so 0.24 *110=26.4. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the pressure affects the enthalpy. But for an ideal gas, enthalpy depends only on temperature, so pressure doesn't affect it. So the enthalpy change is indeed 26.4 Btu/lbm.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something about the actual work. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the turbine as a control volume and the work done is the shaft work, which is the difference in stagnation enthalpy. So the actual work would be 27.4 Btu/lbm, and the reversible work is 26.4 Btu/lbm. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the work in the reverse direction. Wait, the turbine is doing work on the surroundings, so the work is positive when the turbine outputs work. So the actual work should be higher than the reversible? No, that doesn't make sense because the reversible process is the maximum possible work.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between steady flow work and the actual work. Let me think again: the actual work is the shaft work, which is W_act = h0_in - h0_out = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

The reversible work would be the same as the actual work if the process is reversible, but in this case, the process isn't necessarily reversible because the velocities are changing. Wait, no, the process is adiabatic, but the turbine is a real device, so the actual process might not be isentropic. But the problem doesn't give any information about entropy changes or inefficiency, so perhaps we're assuming the process is reversible.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the options again. The only option where the reversible work is 26.4 is option F, with actual work 42.2. That doesn't match my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity term.

Wait, maybe I should compute the velocity term in a different way. Let me try again.

The velocity term is (V_in^2 - V_out^2)/(2g). Let me compute that:

V_in = 300 ft/s, V_out = 200 ft/s.

V_in^2 = 90,000, V_out^2 = 40,000.

Difference = 50,000 ft²/s².

Divide by (2 * 32.174) = 64.348.

50,000 / 64.348 ≈ 777.3 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu/lbm: 777.3 / 778.169 ≈ 1.00 Btu/lbm.

So that's correct. So the actual work is 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible work because the turbine operates under reversible conditions. But that would mean the actual work is 26.4, which isn't matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual work is higher because the turbine is less efficient, but the problem doesn't provide any efficiency data. So I think my initial approach is correct, and perhaps the answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at option H: Reversible work:27.4, Actual:42.2. That would mean the reversible work is higher than the actual, which doesn't make sense because reversible processes yield maximum work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the pressure work in addition to the enthalpy change. Let me think: the work done by the gas is also related to the pressure change. In a turbine, the work done is P_in * v_in - P_out * v_out, where v is specific volume. But since we're dealing with enthalpy, which already includes the Pv term, perhaps that's already accounted for.

Wait, let me try calculating the pressure work term. The specific volume v for air can be calculated using the ideal gas law: v = RT/P. But I need the gas constant R for air. R = 53.353 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R).

At inlet: P_in = 150 lb_f/in². Let me convert that to lb_f/ft². Since 1 in² = 144 in²/ft², so 150 psi = 150 * 144 = 21,600 lb_f/ft².

T_in = 609.67 °R.

v_in = (53.353 * 609.67) / 21600 ≈ (53.353 * 609.67) ≈ 32,650. Divide by 21600 ≈ 1.511 ft³/lbm.

Similarly, at outlet: P_out = 50 psi = 50 * 144 = 7200 lb_f/ft².

v_out = (53.353 * 499.67) / 7200 ≈ (53.353 * 500) ≈ 26,676.5 /7200 ≈ 3.702 ft³/lbm.

Now, the pressure work term is P_in v_in - P_out v_out.

P_in v_in = 21600 * 1.511 ≈ 32,709.6 ft·lbf/lbm.

P_out v_out = 7200 * 3.702 ≈ 26,654.4 ft·lbf/lbm.

So the pressure work term is 32,709.6 - 26,654.4 ≈ 6,055.2 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu/lbm: 6,055.2 / 778.169 ≈ 7.77 Btu/lbm.

So the pressure work contributes about 7.77 Btu/lbm.

But wait, earlier I calculated the enthalpy change as 26.4 Btu/lbm. So the total work would be h_in - h_out + (V_in^2 - V_out^2)/(2g) = 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But adding the pressure work gives a different term. Wait, but I thought the enthalpy already includes the Pv term, so perhaps I'm double-counting.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done is the sum of the enthalpy change and the kinetic energy change, which gives 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But in that case, the options don't have that. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option F: Reversible work 26.4 Btu/lbm, Actual work 42.2 Btu/lbm. But where does 42.2 come from? Let me recalculate.

If I include both the enthalpy change and the pressure work:

W = (h_in - h_out) + (P_in v_in - P_out v_out)/J + (V_in^2 - V_out^2)/(2g)

Wait, but J is the mechanical equivalent of heat, which is 778 ft·lbf/Btu.

Wait, perhaps the total work is the sum of the enthalpy change, the pressure work, and the kinetic energy change. But I'm getting confused because I'm mixing terms that are already part of the enthalpy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work using the equation W = (h_in + (V_in^2)/(2g)) - (h_out + (V_out^2)/(2g)) )

Which is the same as the stagnation enthalpy approach.

So W = (h_in + V_in^2/(2g)) - (h_out + V_out^2/(2g)) ) = (h_in - h_out) + (V_in^2 - V_out^2)/(2g) ) = 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

So actual work is 27.4, reversible work is 26.4. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the work in the reverse direction. Let me think: If the turbine is doing work, then the actual work is the turbine's output. But perhaps the question is asking for the work per pound of air, which could be different.

Wait, another approach: using the specific work w = (h_in + (V_in)^2/(2g)) - (h_out + (V_out)^2/(2g)) )

Which gives w = 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the actual work without considering the velocity change, which would make W_act = 26.4 Btu/lbm, and the reversible work is the same, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the actual work as the same as the reversible work, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity term. Let me compute it again.

V_in = 300 ft/s, V_out = 200 ft/s.

(V_in^2 - V_out^2) = 300^2 - 200^2 = 90,000 -40,000 =50,000 ft²/s².

Divide by (2 * 32.174) = 64.348.

50,000 / 64.348 ≈ 777.3 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu: 777.3 / 778.169 ≈ 1.00 Btu/lbm.

So that's correct. So the actual work is 27.4 Btu/lbm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the actual work as the same as the reversible work, which would be 26.4 Btu/lbm, and the actual work is higher, but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the specific heat at constant volume, c_v, instead of c_p. But that would be incorrect because the process involves pressure change, so we should use c_p.

Wait, c_p = c_v + R. For air, c_p is 0.24 Btu/lbm·°R, and c_v is 0.174 Btu/lbm·°R.

But using c_v would give a lower enthalpy change, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the exit temperature is lower, so the turbine is doing work, and the actual work is higher than the reversible. But I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F: Reversible work 26.4, Actual work 42.2.

But where does 42.2 come from? Let me think: if the actual work is the sum of the enthalpy change and twice the velocity term.

Wait, 26.4 + 2*(1.00) = 28.4, which still doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the inlet and outlet stagnation temperatures to find the enthalpy change.

Stagnation temperature at inlet: T0_in = T_in + V_in^2/(2gc_p)

Wait, no, the formula is T0 = T + V^2/(2gc_p)

Wait, let me compute T0_in and T0_out.

T0_in = T_in + V_in^2/(2g c_p)

= 150 + (300^2)/(2*32.174*0.24)

Compute denominator: 2*32.174=64.348; 64.348 *0.24≈15.443.

So 300^2=90,000.

90,000 /15.443 ≈5824.3 °F?

Wait, that can't be right because 90,000/15.443 is about 5824, which would be way above the boiling point of air. That can't be correct. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, the correct formula for stagnation temperature is T0 = T + V^2/(2c_p g), but perhaps I should use the specific heat at constant pressure. Let me think again.

Wait, the stagnation temperature formula is T0 = T + V^2/(2c_p g), where g is acceleration due to gravity.

So for inlet:

V_in = 300 ft/s.

V_in^2 =90,000 ft²/s².

2c_p g =2 *0.24 Btu/lbm·°R *32.174 ft/s².

Wait, but units might be getting in the way. Let me compute it in consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the stagnation temperature in Rankine.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again.

Stagnation temperature T0 is given by:

T0 = T + V^2/(2c_p g)

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, the stagnation enthalpy is h0 = h + V^2/(2g), and since h = c_p T, then h0 = c_p T0 = c_p (T + V^2/(2g c_p)) ) = c_p T + V^2/(2g).

So T0 = T + V^2/(2g c_p).

So for inlet:

T_in = 150°F.

V_in =300 ft/s.

g=32.174 ft/s².

c_p=0.24 Btu/lbm·°R.

Compute V_in^2/(2g c_p):

V_in^2 =90,000 ft²/s².

Denominator:2 *32.174=64.348.

So 90,000 /64.348≈1400.

Then, 1400 /0.24 ≈5833.33 °R.

Wait, that's about 5833 - 459.67 ≈5373°F, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is T0 = T + V^2/(2c_p g), but the units must be consistent. Let me make sure all units are in compatible terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the stagnation temperature in °R.

But I'm getting stuck here, and perhaps I should move on.

Given that none of the options match my calculation, I'm probably missing something. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible work because the turbine is ideal, so the answer would be reversible work 26.4 and actual work 26.4. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the turbine as a control volume and applied the energy equation without considering velocity changes, but that would neglect the kinetic energy term, leading to W=26.4, which again isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible work, and the options have a typo. Looking at option F: Reversible 26.4, Actual 42.2. That doesn't make sense because the actual work should be higher than the reversible if there are losses, but in this case, we're assuming no heat losses, so perhaps it's isentropic.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I'll go with the calculation I did earlier: reversible work is 26.4, actual work is 27.4. Since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the work is calculated using the specific volume and pressure changes, not the enthalpy. So W = P_in v_in - P_out v_out.

Earlier, I calculated P_in v_in - P_out v_out ≈7.77 Btu/lbm.

But that's much lower than the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the work is calculated as the change in specific enthalpy plus the change in kinetic energy, which would be 26.4 +1.00=27.4, but again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option F: Reversible work 26.4, Actual 42.2. But where does 42.2 come from? Let me think: maybe I made a mistake in the velocity term.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the velocity is in ft/s and should be converted to inches or something else. No, that's not the case. The units should cancel out correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the specific kinetic energy term as (V^2)/(2g) in Btu/lbm without converting, but that would give a much larger number.

Wait, (300)^2 =90,000. Divided by (2*32.174)=64.348, which is ≈1400.

Now, 1400 ft²/s² per lbm. To convert to Btu/lbm, since 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf, and 1 lbf =32.174 lbm·ft/s², so 1 ft²/s² = 1 ft·(ft/s²) = 1/(32.174 lbm) lbf.

So 1400 ft²/s² per lbm = 1400/(32.174) lbf·ft/lbm.

Which is 1400/32.174 ≈43.51 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu/lbm: 43.51 /778.169 ≈0.0558 Btu/lbm.

Wait, that's a very small number. So the velocity term would be around 0.0558 Btu/lbm. Then the actual work would be 26.4 +0.0558≈26.46 Btu/lbm, which is approximately 26.5, but that's not matching any option either.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is option F: Reversible 26.4, Actual 42.2. But I can't see how to get 42.2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity term. Let me try again.

V_in =300 ft/s. V_out=200 ft/s.

ΔV² =300² -200²=50,000 ft²/s².

ΔKE = ΔV²/(2g) =50,000/(2*32.174)=50,000/64.348≈777.3 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu: 777.3/778.169≈1.00 Btu/lbm.

So the actual work is 26.4 +1.00=27.4.

But no option has that. So perhaps the answer is option F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option H, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the actual work is the same as the reversible work, and the options have a typo. But I can't be certain. Given the options, I'll go with option F: Reversible work 26.4, Actual work 42.2. But I'm not confident.

The problem involves calculating the reversible and actual work done by a gas turbine expanding air under given conditions. The key steps involve using the energy equation for a steady-flow process, accounting for enthalpy change and kinetic energy change.

1. **Reversible Work**:  
   The reversible work is calculated using the change in enthalpy, which depends only on the temperature change since air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats.  
   - \( c_p \) for air is approximately \( 0.24 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ\text{R} \).  
   - Temperature in Rankine: \( T_{\text{in}} = 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 \, \text{R} \), \( T_{\text{out}} = 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 \, \text{R} \).  
   - \( \Delta T = T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}} = 110 \, \text{R} \).  
   - \( W_{\text{rev}} = c_p \Delta T = 0.24 \times 110 = 26.4 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \).

2. **Actual Work**:  
   The actual work includes the kinetic energy change in addition to the enthalpy change.  
   - Velocity terms: \( V_{\text{in}} = 300 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( V_{\text{out}} = 200 \, \text{ft/s} \).  
   - \( \Delta V^2 = V_{\text{in}}^2 - V_{\text{out}}^2 = 300^2 - 200^2 = 50,000 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2 \).  
   - Kinetic energy change:  
     \[
     \Delta KE = \frac{\Delta V^2}{2g} = \frac{50,000}{2 \times 32.174} \approx 777.3 \, \text{ft} \cdot \text{lbf/lbm}.
     \]  
     Converting to Btu/lbm:  
     \[
     \Delta KE = \frac{777.3}{778.169} \approx 1.00 \, \text{Btu/lbm}.
     \]  
   - Total actual work:  
     \[
     W_{\text{act}} = W_{\text{rev}} + \Delta KE = 26.4 + 1.00 = 27.4 \, \text{Btu/lbm}.
     \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated reversible work (\( 26.4 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \)) matches option F. However, the calculated actual work (\( 27.4 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \)) does not match any option. Despite this discrepancy, the closest matching option is **F**, which lists the reversible work as \( 26.4 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \) and the actual work as \( 42.2 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \). This suggests a possible inconsistency in the options provided.

**Answer**: F
