Question:

A state statute provides: "Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. " Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.
B: not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.
C: guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.
D: guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a state statute that says if someone knows they're being arrested by a police officer, they can't use force or weapons to resist. Violating this is a crime. Now, there's a bank robbery, and a police officer arrests a suspect he thinks is involved. But both the officer and the suspect have different stories about what happened after the arrest.

The police officer says that after arresting the suspect, the suspect resisted and hit him. The officer then hit the suspect with a nightstick. The suspect's version is that after being arrested, he cursed at the officer, who then started hitting him. To avoid more hits, the suspect punched the officer, knocking him down. The suspect is charged with assault. The question is whether he should be found guilty or not, based on the accounts and the law.

So, the options are A to D. I need to figure out the legal reasoning here.

First, I remember that the statute makes it a duty for a person to not resist arrest using force or weapons. So, if the arrest is lawful, then any resistance would be a crime.

But wait, there's a key point here: if the arrest itself is unlawful, does that change things? Because I think if the police don't have the right to arrest someone in the first place, the suspect's actions might be justified as self-defense.

So, the suspect is charged with assault. For that, the prosecution needs to prove that he used force against another person with the intent to cause harm. But if the arrest was unlawful, the suspect's act of hitting the officer might be seen as a reasonable response to an unlawful seizure, which could be a defense.

Looking at the options:

Option A says not guilty if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account. That makes sense because if the arrest was unlawful, the suspect's resistance would be justified.

Option B says not guilty if the arrest was lawful but the jury believes the suspect's story. But wait, if the arrest is lawful, then the suspect's resistance is against the law, so he should be guilty. So B seems incorrect.

Option C says guilty if the arrest was lawful, regardless of the jury's belief. If the arrest is lawful, then the suspect's use of force is against the statute. So the outcome would depend on whether the arrest was lawful and who the jury believes.

Option D says guilty if the arrest was unlawful, which doesn't make sense because if the arrest was unlawful, the suspect's actions would be justified, not criminal.

So, the key is determining whether the arrest was lawful. If it was unlawful (no probable cause), then the suspect didn't have to comply, and his actions might be seen as self-defense, making him not guilty.

So, looking at the options again, A says not guilty if the arrest was unlawful and the jury believes the suspect's account. That seems correct because if the arrest was unlawful, the suspect's resistance isn't criminal.

Wait, but what if the arrest was unlawful but the jury doesn't believe the suspect's account? Then it wouldn't apply. But A specifies that the jury believes the suspect's account, so that's the condition.

So, the correct answer should be A.

The suspect's guilt hinges on whether the arrest was lawful and which account the jury believes. If the arrest was unlawful, the suspect's resistance would be justified, making him not guilty. If the arrest was lawful, the suspect's resistance would violate the statute. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.

Answer: A
