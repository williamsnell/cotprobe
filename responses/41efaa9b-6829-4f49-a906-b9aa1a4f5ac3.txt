Okay, so I need to figure out what the birthstone for January is. I'm a bit rusty on my gemstones, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that each month has a traditional birthstone, and sometimes more than one, but I think January has one main one. I'm trying to recall the order of the months and their corresponding stones. Let me see... January is the first month, right? So, what stone is associated with the start of the year?

I think I've heard that January's birthstone is a red gem. Oh, wait, isn't it the garnet? Garnet is a red gemstone, and I'm pretty sure it's for January. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think about other options.

Looking at the options provided: A is peridot, which I think is for August. B is ruby, which I'm pretty sure is for July. C is topaz, maybe November? D is diamond, which is definitely for April. E is turquoise, I think that's December. F is emerald, May. G is amethyst, which is February. H is sapphire, September. I is garnet, and J is opal, which I believe is October.

So, going through those, I is garnet. That must be the one for January. I remember seeing garnet jewelry in January sales and such. Yeah, I'm pretty confident now that the answer is I.
