Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the government wants to achieve a balanced budget by levying taxes of $100 billion and making expenditures of $100 billion. The MPC is 0.8. It's asking how this will affect the National Net Product (NNP), with several options provided.

Hmm, I remember that a balanced budget means that the government's spending equals its tax revenue. So in this case, they're taking in $100 billion and spending exactly that. But how does this affect NNP? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

I think NNP is similar to GDP, but maybe adjusted for some factors. Wait, actually, in economics, NNP is often referred to as Net National Product, which is GDP minus depreciation. But when talking about the impact of fiscal policy, I think we're looking at how taxes and spending affect aggregate demand, which in turn affects GDP or NNP.

So, the government's actions here are a balanced budget. Normally, when the government increases spending or decreases taxes, it can stimulate the economy. But since this is a balanced budget, taxes are increased (or not decreased) enough to offset the spending. So, I think the overall effect might be different.

I remember something about the balanced budget multiplier. The multiplier effect comes into play when taxes and spending are linked. The formula, I think, is that the change in GDP (or NNP) is equal to the change in government spending multiplied by the inverse of (1 minus MPC). But wait, in a balanced budget, taxes are adjusted, so maybe that affects things differently.

Let me think. The standard government spending multiplier is 1/(1-MPC). So if MPC is 0.8, the multiplier would be 1/(1-0.8) = 5. So if the government spends an extra $1, GDP increases by $5. But in this case, the government is both spending and taxing by $100 billion. So the net effect is that the government is taking $100 billion out of the economy through taxes and putting $100 billion back in through spending.

Wait, but how does that affect the economy? If they take out $100 billion in taxes and spend the same $100 billion, it's like a transfer. But the way it affects aggregate demand might depend on the MPC. Because when the government spends, it's directly adding to demand, but when it taxes, it's reducing disposable income, which might reduce consumption.

So the balanced budget multiplier would be the effect of the spending minus the effect of the taxes. Let's model this. The change in GDP (ΔGDP) would be equal to the change in government spending (ΔG) times the multiplier, minus the change in taxes (ΔT) times the tax multiplier.

But wait, the tax multiplier is a bit different. The tax multiplier is MPC/(1-MPC). So if taxes increase by ΔT, the change in GDP would be -ΔT * (MPC/(1-MPC)).

In this case, ΔG is +100 billion, and ΔT is also +100 billion. So let's compute each part.

First, the spending multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.8) = 5. So ΔG effect is 100 * 5 = +500 billion.

Next, the tax multiplier is 0.8/(1 - 0.8) = 4. So ΔT effect is -100 * 4 = -400 billion. The negative because taxes are a drain.

So total ΔGDP = 500 - 400 = +100 billion.

Wait, that would mean NNP increases by $100 billion. Looking at the options, option G is "Increase of $100 billion in NNP." But wait, I'm not sure if NNP is the same as GDP here. Or maybe the question is considering NNP as GDP.

Wait, another approach: the balanced budget multiplier. I think the formula is that the change in GDP is (government spending + taxes) multiplied by the MPC. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I remember that the balanced budget multiplier is MPC/(1 - MPC). Wait, that would be 0.8/(0.2) = 4. So a $100 billion change would lead to 100 * 4 = 400 billion change? Hmm, no, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check. The balanced budget multiplier is the effect of a simultaneous increase in taxes and government spending by the same amount. The formula is ΔY = (G - T) * (1/(1 - MPC)).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The government spending multiplier is 1/(1-MPC). The tax multiplier is MPC/(1-MPC). So when you have both, the total effect is ΔG * (1/(1-MPC)) - ΔT * (MPC/(1-MPC)).

In this case, ΔG = +100, ΔT = +100. So:

ΔY = (100 * 5) - (100 * 4) = 500 - 400 = +100 billion.

So NNP increases by $100 billion. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but I've also heard that in a balanced budget, the overall effect is a multiplier equal to MPC/(1-MPC). Let me see: MPC is 0.8, 1-MPC is 0.2. So 0.8/0.2 = 4. Then, 100 *4 = 400. Hmm, but that's not matching my previous calculation. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me check. The balanced budget multiplier is the sum of the government spending multiplier and the tax multiplier. Government spending multiplier is 1/(1-MPC), tax multiplier is -MPC/(1-MPC). So the total multiplier is [1/(1-MPC)] - [MPC/(1-MPC)] = (1 - MPC)/(1 - MPC) = 1. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply the multiplier is 1. But that's not correct.

Wait, no. Wait, when both G and T increase by Δ, the effect on Y is:

ΔY = (ΔG * 1/(1-MPC)) ) + (ΔT * (-MPC)/(1-MPC)) )

So ΔY = [ΔG - ΔT * MPC ] / (1 - MPC)

In this case, ΔG = +100, ΔT = +100. So:

ΔY = [100 - 100*(0.8)] / (1 - 0.8) = [100 - 80] / 0.2 = 20 / 0.2 = 100 billion.

So yes, that's correct. So NNP increases by $100 billion, which is option G.

Wait, but another thought: if the government takes $100 billion in taxes and spends all of it, it's like a transfer. So the initial impact is that the government takes money out of the economy (taxes) but then spends it, which might not change the overall demand. But that's not considering the MPC. Because when the government spends, it's creating demand, which leads to more income, which then leads to more consumption (since MPC is 0.8). So the spending has a multiplier effect, while the taxes have a negative effect. But since the spending is the same as the tax increase, the overall effect is a net increase in GDP.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is G: Increase of $100 billion in NNP.
</think>

The government's balanced budget policy involves taxing $100 billion and spending $100 billion. To determine the effect on NNP, we analyze the multipliers. The spending multiplier is \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} = 5 \), and the tax multiplier is \( \frac{\text{MPC}}{1 - \text{MPC}} = 4 \). The net effect is:

\[
\Delta \text{NNP} = (100 \times 5) - (100 \times 4) = 500 - 400 = 100 \text{ billion}.
\]

Thus, NNP increases by $100 billion.
