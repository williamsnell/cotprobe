All of the following support the endosymbiotic theory that ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent, free-living prokaryotes EXCEPT:

Options:

A: Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission.
B: Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic cells.
C: Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about the endosymbiotic theory. I remember that the endosymbiotic theory suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells were once free-living prokaryotes that got engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell. Over time, they became dependent on their host but kept some of their own features.

The question is asking which option does NOT support the theory. So, I need to look at each option and see which one doesn't fit with the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent prokaryotes.

Option A says that mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently using binary fission. Binary fission is how prokaryotes reproduce, so if they still do this, that supports the idea they were once free-living. So A supports the theory, so it's not the exception.

Option B mentions their ribosomes are more like bacteria's. Eukaryotic ribosomes are different, so if mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes similar to bacteria, that also supports the theory because it suggests they came from prokaryotes. So B supports it, not the exception.

Option C says they function independently. Wait, but in reality, mitochondria and chloroplasts are pretty integrated into the cell. They can't function completely on their own; they rely on the host for many things. So if they function independently, that might not make sense. I'm not sure though, because they do have their own functions like producing ATP or chlorophyll. Hmm, maybe C supports the theory because it implies they have their own functions, which they do, but I'm not certain yet.

Option D states they have a single circular chromosome without histones. Bacteria also have circular chromosomes without histones, while eukaryotes have linear chromosomes with histones. So if mitochondria and chloroplasts share this with bacteria, it supports the theory. So D supports it, not the exception.

Wait, the question is asking for the exception, the option that does NOT support the theory. So which one doesn't fit?

Looking again: The theory says they were once free-living. So features like binary fission (A), ribosomes like bacteria (B), and circular chromosomes (D) all support that. 

Option C says they function independently. But in reality, mitochondria and chloroplasts are dependent on the host cell for many processes—like getting some proteins from the host. So if C is suggesting they function completely independently, that might not support the theory because they're actually somewhat integrated into the host. So maybe C is the exception because it contradicts the theory.

Wait, but the question is about supporting the theory. If they function independently, that would suggest they're acting like their own organisms, which supports the idea they were once free-living. So maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. The theory is that these organelles were once independent. So any evidence that they do things independently would support it. So C supports the theory, meaning the exception must be another option.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine each option.

A: Division via binary fission – supports.

B: Ribosomes like bacteria – supports.

C: Function independently – supports.

D: Single circular chromosome – supports.

Wait, so all options except one support. But the question says which one does NOT support. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option C is incorrect because they don't function completely independently. For example, they can't survive without the host cell. They rely on the host for replication factors, etc. So if the option says they function independently, that's not true, which would mean it doesn't support the theory. But wait, the question is about what supports the theory. So if the option says they function independently, that would support the idea they were once free, but in reality, they don't function entirely independently. So the statement in option C is true, but does it support the theory?

Wait, the question is about which one does NOT support the theory. So if all except one support, then the exception is the one that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each point.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, divide on their own, etc. All these point to prokaryotic origins. So all options except maybe one support.

Wait, maybe option C is actually correct in the sense that they have independent functions (like producing ATP), which would support the theory. So perhaps the exception is another option.

Wait, another angle: The endosymbiotic theory is about them being engulfed and then becoming organelles. So the features that support it are similarities to prokaryotes. So all options except C?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of each option's relevance.

A: Division by binary fission – yes, supports.

B: Ribosomes similar to bacteria – yes, supports.

C: Function independently – yes, supports because they have their own functions.

D: Single circular chromosome – yes, supports.

Wait, but the question is asking which does NOT support. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the exception is option C. Because in reality, mitochondria and chloroplasts are dependent on the host cell for many functions. So if C says they function independently, that might not be true, but the question is about what supports the theory. So if C is a true statement, it supports the theory.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: The endosymbiotic theory is supported by the fact that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA, ribosomes, and can divide on their own. So all options except perhaps C?

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of each option again.

Option C: Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.

Wait, if they function independently, that suggests they don't need the host, which supports the idea they were once free. But in reality, they do require the host for many things. So if C is saying they function independently, that's actually not correct, but the question is about what supports the theory, so if C is a true statement, it would support. But if C is not true, then it doesn't support. But I'm not sure if C is a correct statement.

Wait, the question is about which option does NOT support the theory. So if all except one support, the exception is the one that doesn't.

Wait, perhaps option C is the exception. Because the theory suggests they have some independence but are now integrated. So if C says they function independently, which might not be the case, that would not support the theory. No, that can't be right because the theory is about their origin, not their current state.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. The endosymbiotic theory says that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes. Features like their own DNA, ribosomes, division methods, and circular chromosomes support this. So all options except maybe C support the theory. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the answer might be option C. Because if they function independently, that's a prokaryotic feature. So if the question is about what does NOT support, perhaps C is correct. Or maybe it's option C that does support.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the correct answer. The exception would be the one that doesn't align with the theory. So, looking for which option is not evidence for endosymbiosis.

Wait, the theory is supported by similarities to prokaryotes. All options except one show that. So the exception would be the one that doesn't show similarity.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: Division by binary fission – yes, like prokaryotes.

B: Ribosomes like bacteria – yes.

C: Function independently – yes, as they have their own functions.

D: Single circular chromosome – yes.

So all of these support the theory, but the question says which one does NOT. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option C is the exception because mitochondria and chloroplasts are actually dependent on the host for many functions, so they don't function completely independently. So the statement in C is not entirely true, thus it doesn't support the theory.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the theory says they were once independent, but they now function within the host, so if they function independently now, that supports the theory as evidence of their past.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about each point.

The endosymbiotic theory suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts were ingested by a eukaryotic cell and became symbiotic. Features that support this include:

- Their division via binary fission (A).

- Presence of bacterial-like ribosomes (B).

- Having their own DNA (circular chromosome, D).

- They can function somewhat independently, like producing ATP (C).

So all options except perhaps C support the theory. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C because it's not actually true that they function completely independently; they rely on the host for many functions. So if C says they function independently, that's not accurate, thus it doesn't support the theory.

Wait, but the question is about what supports the theory, so if C is true, it supports. If it's not true, then it doesn't support.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Maybe the correct answer is C, but I'm not fully confident.
</think>

The endosymbiotic theory posits that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by early eukaryotic cells. Features such as binary fission, bacterial-like ribosomes, and circular chromosomes support this theory. However, the statement in option C that mitochondria and chloroplasts "function independently" is misleading because, while they retain some independent functions, they are heavily integrated into the host cell and dependent on it for many processes. Therefore, this option does not fully align with the theory.

Answer: C
