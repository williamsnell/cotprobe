Okay, so I've got this problem about a hot-air balloon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is asking for the volume of air at 100°C needed so that the balloon has a gross lifting power of 200 kg. Gross lifting power is defined as the mass of displaced air minus the mass of the hot air. So I need to find the volume of hot air that results in this 200 kg difference.

First, I'll jot down the given data:

- Ambient temperature (T_ambient) is 25°C, which I'll convert to Kelvin. 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K.
- Hot air temperature (T_hot) is 100°C, so that's 373.15 K.
- Ambient pressure is 1 atm. I remember that 1 atm is about 101325 Pascals, but maybe I'll use the ideal gas constant in terms of atm·L/(mol·K) later.
- Molecular weight of air (M_air) is 29 g/mol. Oh wait, but the hot air has a molecular weight of 32 g/mol. So the average molecular weight increases because of CO₂. That must affect the density.

Density is mass over volume. So for the ambient air and the hot air, their densities will differ because of temperature and molecular weight. The lifting power comes from the difference in these masses.

Gross lifting power (Δm) = mass of displaced air - mass of hot air.

But wait, the displaced air is at ambient conditions, right? Because when the balloon rises, it displaces the same volume of ambient air. So the displaced air's mass is based on ambient conditions, while the hot air inside the balloon is at 100°C and has a higher molecular weight.

I think I can model this using the ideal gas law. The volume of the balloon will be the same for both the displaced air and the hot air. But since the temperature and pressure are different, the number of moles changes, which affects the mass.

Wait no, the pressure inside the balloon is the same as ambient, right? Because the balloon expands until the internal pressure equals the outside pressure. So the pressure is 1 atm for both cases.

So for the displaced air (ambient conditions):

PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT)

Mass of displaced air, m_displaced = n * M_air.

Similarly, for the hot air inside the balloon:

Same P and V, but different T and molecular weight.

n_hot = P V / (R T_hot)

Mass of hot air, m_hot = n_hot * M_hot_air.

So the lifting power Δm = m_displaced - m_hot = 200 kg.

Let me write expressions for m_displaced and m_hot.

m_displaced = (P V) / (R T_ambient) * M_air

m_hot = (P V) / (R T_hot) * M_hot

So Δm = (P V M_air)/(R T_ambient) - (P V M_hot)/(R T_hot) = 200 kg.

Factor out P V / R:

Δm = (P V / R) [M_air / T_ambient - M_hot / T_hot] = 200 kg.

I can solve for V from this equation.

Let me plug in the numbers.

P = 1 atm.

R is the gas constant. I think R in terms of atm·L/(mol·K) is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

M_air = 29 g/mol = 0.029 kg/mol.

M_hot = 32 g/mol = 0.032 kg/mol.

T_ambient = 298.15 K.

T_hot = 373.15 K.

So substituting:

200 kg = (1 atm * V) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * [ (0.029 kg/mol) / 298.15 - (0.032 kg/mol) / 373.15 ]

Wait, no, actually, let's correct that. The M is in g/mol, but when calculating mass, I should use kg if the Δm is in kg. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to keep everything in grams and then convert at the end.

Wait, maybe that's where I got confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe better to work in grams.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to keep R in terms of (L·atm)/(mol·K), and use grams for mass.

Wait, so let me re-express this.

The mass of displaced air is:

m_displaced = (n_air) * M_air_grams/mol.

Similarly, m_hot = (n_hot) * M_hot_grams/mol.

So Δm = m_displaced - m_hot = 200,000 grams (since 200 kg = 200,000 g).

So, let's express everything in grams.

So, Δm = [ (P V) / (R T_ambient) * M_air ] - [ (P V) / (R T_hot) * M_hot ]

= (P V / R) [ M_air / T_ambient - M_hot / T_hot ] = 200,000 g.

Now, solving for V:

V = (200,000 g * R) / [ P ( M_air / T_ambient - M_hot / T_hot ) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

P = 1 atm.

M_air = 29 g/mol.

M_hot = 32 g/mol.

T_ambient = 298.15 K.

T_hot = 373.15 K.

So compute the denominator first: [ (29 / 298.15) - (32 / 373.15) ]

Calculating each term:

29 / 298.15 ≈ 0.09725 g/mol·K

32 / 373.15 ≈ 0.0857 g/mol·K

Subtracting: 0.09725 - 0.0857 ≈ 0.01155 g/mol·K.

So denominator is 0.01155.

Now, numerator is 200,000 g * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) → 200,000 * 0.0821 = 16,420 g·L·atm/(mol·K).

Wait, no, the equation is V = (200,000 g * R) / (P * denominator).

So:

V = (200,000 g * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) / (1 atm * 0.01155 g/mol·K )

Wait, let me compute this:

200,000 * 0.0821 = 16,420.

Denominator: 1 * 0.01155 ≈ 0.01155.

So V = 16,420 / 0.01155 ≈ ?

Calculating 16,420 / 0.01155. Let's see:

Well, 0.01155 is approximately 1.155e-2.

16,420 / 0.01155 ≈ 16,420 / 0.01155 ≈ ?

Let me compute 16,420 / 0.01155.

Well, 16,420 ÷ 0.01155 ≈ 16,420 * (1 / 0.01155) ≈ 16,420 * 86.58 (since 1/0.01155 ≈ 86.58).

So 16,420 * 86.58 ≈ Let's compute 16,000 * 86.58 = 1,385,280.

Then 420 * 86.58 ≈ 36,363.6.

Total ≈ 1,385,280 + 36,363.6 ≈ 1,421,643.6 L.

Hmm, so approximately 1.4216e6 liters.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.42 ×10^6 liters. So that's likely the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I computed [ M_air / T_ambient - M_hot / T_hot ], I got 0.09725 - 0.0857 = approx 0.01155. That's correct.

Then, V = (200,000 g * 0.0821) / (1 * 0.01155) = (16,420) / 0.01155 ≈ 1,421,643 L, which is 1.4216e6 L. So yes, option B is 1.42e6, which matches.

To determine the volume of air at 100°C needed for the hot-air balloon to achieve a gross lifting power of 200 kg, we start by analyzing the given data:

- Ambient temperature: \( T_{\text{ambient}} = 25^\circ\text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Hot air temperature: \( T_{\text{hot}} = 100^\circ\text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Ambient pressure: \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
- Molecular weight of air: \( M_{\text{air}} = 29 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.029 \, \text{kg/mol} \)
- Molecular weight of hot air: \( M_{\text{hot}} = 32 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.032 \, \text{kg/mol} \)
- Ideal gas constant: \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

The gross lifting power is defined as:

\[
\Delta m = m_{\text{displaced}} - m_{\text{hot}} = 200 \, \text{kg}
\]

Using the ideal gas law, the number of moles of air at ambient and hot conditions can be expressed as:

\[
n_{\text{air}} = \frac{P V}{R T_{\text{ambient}}}, \quad n_{\text{hot}} = \frac{P V}{R T_{\text{hot}}}
\]

The masses of air are then:

\[
m_{\text{displaced}} = n_{\text{air}} \cdot M_{\text{air}}, \quad m_{\text{hot}} = n_{\text{hot}} \cdot M_{\text{hot}}
\]

Substituting these into the lifting power equation:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{P V M_{\text{air}}}{R T_{\text{ambient}}} - \frac{P V M_{\text{hot}}}{R T_{\text{hot}}}
\]

Factoring out \( \frac{P V}{R} \):

\[
\Delta m = \frac{P V}{R} \left( \frac{M_{\text{air}}}{T_{\text{ambient}}} - \frac{M_{\text{hot}}}{T_{\text{hot}}} \right)
\]

Solving for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{\Delta m \cdot R}{P \left( \frac{M_{\text{air}}}{T_{\text{ambient}}} - \frac{M_{\text{hot}}}{T_{\text{hot}}} \right)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V = \frac{200,000 \cdot 0.0821}{1 \cdot \left( \frac{29}{298.15} - \frac{32}{373.15} \right)}
\]

Calculating the terms:

\[
\frac{29}{298.15} \approx 0.09725, \quad \frac{32}{373.15} \approx 0.0857
\]

\[
\frac{M_{\text{air}}}{T_{\text{ambient}}} - \frac{M_{\text{hot}}}{T_{\text{hot}}} \approx 0.09725 - 0.0857 = 0.01155
\]

\[
V = \frac{200,000 \cdot 0.0821}{0.01155} \approx \frac{16,420}{0.01155} \approx 1,421,643 \, \text{L}
\]

Thus, the volume of air required is approximately \( 1.42 \times 10^6 \, \text{L} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
