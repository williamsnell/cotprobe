Okay, so I've got this question about Mani referring to God by one of the given names. I'm a bit rusty on my religious studies, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Mani was a major figure in the Manichaean religion. He was a prophet and founded the movement in the 3rd century. Manichaeism was a dualistic religion, focusing on the struggle between good and evil, light and darkness.

The question is asking what name Mani used for God. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Eternal Spirit. That sounds more like a general term, maybe from other traditions, not specific to Mani.

Option B: Divine Guardian. Hmm, that's a bit vague. I'm not sure if that's specific to Mani's terminology.

Option C: Light Bringer. Wait, I think Manichaeism has a concept of light as a central element. Maybe this is related. Light is often associated with good and enlightenment.

Option D: Heavenly Guide. That sounds a bit like a guide or a shepherd, but I'm not sure if that's the term Mani used.

Option E: Mother of Light. I recall that in some Gnostic traditions, there's a figure called the "Mother of Light," but was that part of Manichaeism? Or was it more of a separate sect?

Option F: Infinite Wisdom. That's a common term in various philosophical and religious contexts, but I'm not sure if it's specific to Mani.

Option G: Ineffable Lover. That sounds more poetic, maybe from a different tradition. Not sure about this one.

Option H: Grand Architect. That makes me think of the Freemasons, not directly related to Mani.

Option I: Father of Goodness. This seems like a positive term, but I'm not certain if it's Mani's specific name for God.

Option J: Supreme Creator. That's a pretty broad term, used in many contexts, so maybe not specific enough.

Wait, I think Mani referred to God as the "Light of Lights" or something similar. Or perhaps "Eternal Light." But looking at the options, the closest might be "Light Bringer." Alternatively, I remember that in Manichaean texts, God is often associated with light, but was there a specific title?

Another thought: Mani's teachings included the idea of the "Great Light" and the "Eternal Light." But the options don't have "Eternal Light." Let me check the options again. Option C is "Light Bringer." That might be a translation of a term Mani used, perhaps "Lumen" or something similar.

Alternatively, I think in some texts, Mani referred to God as the "Father of Goodness," which is option I. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I might be confusing it with another sect.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up different terms. Let me think again. Manichaeism teaches that there are two principles: light (good) and darkness (evil). The light is the realm of the good, and the darkness is the realm of evil. So, the term "Light Bringer" seems appropriate because God is bringing light or is the source of light.

Alternatively, I might be conflating this with another term. For example, in some sources, Mani referred to God as the "Eternal Father" or "Eternal Light." But the options don't have "Eternal Light." The closest is C: Light Bringer.

Wait, another angle: Mani's original name for God could have been "Mitra" or something else, but I don't see those options here. So among the given choices, I think "Light Bringer" is the most fitting because it aligns with the central theme of light in Manichaeism.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because I remember that in some sources, the term "Father of Goodness" is used, which is option I. I'm trying to recall if that's from Mani or from another source like the New Testament or another sect.

Alternatively, I think the term "Infinite Wisdom" (F) might be from another tradition, perhaps from the Sophia in Gnosticism.

I'm a bit torn between C and I. Let me try to think of specific texts. In the Manichaean literature, they often refer to God as the "Eternal Light" or the "Light of Lights." But since those aren't options, I have to pick from the given choices.

Wait, perhaps "Light Bringer" is the correct one because it's about bringing light, which is a key concept in their dualism. Alternatively, "Eternal Spirit" (A) might be a possible fit, but I'm not certain.

I think I'll go with option C: Light Bringer, because it directly relates to the concept of light as a central element in Mani's teachings.

The question asks about the name Mani used for God. Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, emphasized the concept of light as a central element in his teachings, representing good and enlightenment. Among the given options, "Light Bringer" (C) aligns most closely with this central theme of light in Manichaeism. While other terms like "Eternal Light" are part of Mani's teachings, they are not listed as options. Therefore, the most fitting answer is:

C: Light Bringer
