Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the interest rate for purchasing a desk on an installment plan. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the desk is valued at $125. The buyer is paying a down payment of $16.25 and then 16 monthly payments of $7.50 each. I need to find the interest rate involved. Hmm, how do I approach this?

I remember that installment plans involve calculating the total amount paid and then figuring out the interest based on that. Let me break it down.

The down payment is $16.25, so that's taken off the total price. The remaining amount must be paid through installments. The total cost the buyer pays would be the down payment plus all the monthly payments. So, let me calculate that.

Total payments = down payment + (number of monthly payments × payment per month)
Total payments = $16.25 + (16 × $7.50)

Let me compute that: 16 × 7.50 is 120. So total payments = 16.25 + 120 = $136.25.

Wait, the value of the desk is $125, but the buyer is paying $136.25 in total. So the extra amount is $11.25. This extra is the interest.

But wait, how do I calculate the interest rate from here? I think I need to use the concept of simple interest or maybe something else. Let me think.

The formula for simple interest is I = P × R × T, where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here because installments are usually considered under the concept of add-on interest or maybe using the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) calculation.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this as an amortizing loan. Each payment covers the interest and part of the principal. But that might be complicated. Another approach is to find the effective interest rate based on the total amount paid.

The principal here is $125 minus the down payment, right? Wait, no. The down payment reduces the amount to be financed. So the amount financed is $125 - $16.25 = $108.75. This is the present value. The buyer pays this amount over 16 months with monthly installments of $7.50.

So, the present value (PV) is $108.75, the payment (PMT) is $7.50, the number of periods (n) is 16. We need to find the interest rate (r).

This sounds like the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula is:

PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We can rearrange this to solve for r, but it's not straightforward algebraically, so I might need to use trial and error or a financial calculator approach. Since I'm doing this manually, trial and error might be the way.

Let me denote the monthly rate as r. So,

108.75 = 7.50 × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Dividing both sides by 7.50:

108.75 / 7.50 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]
14.5 = [ (1 - (1/(1+r))^16 ) / r ]

Now, I need to find r such that (1 - (1/(1+r))^16 ) / r = 14.5.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can estimate r. Let's try some values.

Let's start with a guess of r = 1% per month.

(1 - (1/1.01)^16 ) / 0.01
First, (1.01)^16 ≈ 1.1705, so 1/(1.01)^16 ≈ 0.8537.
1 - 0.8537 = 0.1463
0.1463 / 0.01 = 14.63

Oh, that's very close to 14.5. So the monthly rate is approximately 1%, because 14.63 is just slightly above 14.5. So the monthly rate is about 1%.

Wait, that's higher than 14.5? Hmm, let me double-check.

Wait, no, 14.63 is slightly more than 14.5, which is the left side. So if 1% gives us 14.63, which is higher than 14.5, that suggests that the actual rate is slightly less than 1% per month.

Wait, because as r increases, the denominator increases, and the numerator (1 - 1/(1+r)^n) decreases. So higher r would make the whole fraction smaller. Wait, that contradicts. Let me think again.

Wait, when r increases, the term (1 + r)^n increases, so 1/(1 + r)^n decreases, making (1 - 1/(1 + r)^n) approach 1. So the numerator approaches 1, and the denominator is r. So as r increases, the value of the fraction (1 - (1/(1 + r)^n)) / r decreases because the denominator is getting bigger. So if at r=1%, we get 14.63, which is above 14.5, that means we need a slightly higher r to bring the value down to 14.5.

Wait, no. Wait, because the function is decreasing as r increases. So if at r=1%, we have 14.63, which is higher than 14.5, we need a slightly higher r to make the value lower. So let's try r=1.05% (0.0105).

Compute (1 + 0.0105)^16.

Using approximate calculation:

(1.0105)^16 ≈ (approximating using rule of 72, but more accurately, perhaps using binomial or logarithm. Alternatively, use the formula for compound interest.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for r=1%, which gives us 14.63, which is 0.13 higher than 14.5. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a more precise method. Let me consider that when r is 1%, the value is 14.63, which is 0.13 higher than 14.5. So perhaps the rate is just slightly above 1%.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the multiple-choice options are annual rates, so once I find the monthly rate, I'll have to multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.

Wait, no. Actually, if the monthly rate is r, then the annual rate would be 12r if it's simple, but usually, it's (1 + r)^12 - 1 for compound interest. But in this context, since we're dealing with APR, it's often expressed as 12r, but let me clarify.

Wait, no, actually, the APR is the annual percentage rate, which is the simple sum of the monthly rates. So if the monthly rate is r, then the APR is 12r.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The APR is the annual rate without compounding, so it's 12 times the monthly rate. So if the monthly rate is 1%, then APR is 12% per annum.

But wait, in our trial, we found that a 1% monthly rate gives us a PV of about $108.75. Wait, no, let me correct.

Wait, in the calculation earlier, the PV was $108.75, and when we plug r=1%, the PV comes to about 7.50 * [ (1 - 1/(1.01)^16 ) / 0.01 ] = 7.50 * (approx 14.63) = 109.725, which is higher than the actual PV of 108.75. So that suggests that the actual rate is slightly higher than 1%, because a higher rate would cause the PV to decrease.

Wait, because if the interest rate increases, the present value of the payments decreases. So since 7.50 * [ (1 - 1/(1.01)^16 ) / 0.01 ] = ~109.725, which is higher than 108.75, that means the actual rate is higher than 1% because a higher rate would make the present value lower.

Wait, that makes sense. So if 1% gives a PV of ~109.725, which is higher than 108.75, we need a higher rate to bring the PV down to 108.75.

So let's try r=1.05% per month.

Compute (1.0105)^16. Let's approximate:

We can use logarithms or a calculator, but since I don't have a calculator, I'll try to estimate.

(1.0105)^16 ≈ e^(16 * ln(1.0105)).

ln(1.0105) ≈ 0.01044 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + ... for small x).

So 16 * 0.01044 ≈ 0.16704.

e^0.16704 ≈ 1.181 (since e^0.16 is approx 1.1735, e^0.17 is approx 1.1856). So maybe around 1.18.

So 1/(1.0105)^16 ≈ 1/1.18 ≈ 0.847.

Then, 1 - 0.847 = 0.153.

Divide by 0.0105: 0.153 / 0.0105 ≈ 14.571.

So, the factor is approximately 14.571. Then, 7.50 * 14.571 ≈ 109.283, which is still higher than 108.75.

So we need a higher rate than 1.05%. Let's try r=1.1%.

Compute (1.011)^16.

Again, using log approx: ln(1.011) ≈ 0.01098.

16 * 0.01098 ≈ 0.1757.

e^0.1757 ≈ 1.192 (since e^0.175 ≈ 1.192).

So 1/(1.011)^16 ≈ 1/1.192 ≈ 0.839.

1 - 0.839 = 0.161.

Divide by 0.011: 0.161 / 0.011 ≈ 14.636.

Wait, that's higher than before, which can't be right because increasing r should decrease the factor. Hmm, maybe my approximation is off. Alternatively, perhaps I should try a higher r and see.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the exponentials. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for each payment's present value and sum them up. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity and solve for r numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

PV = PMT × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV = 108.75, PMT=7.50, n=16.

So,

108.75 = 7.50 × [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Dividing both sides by 7.50:

14.5 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

We can rewrite this as:

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) = 14.5 × r

Let me try r=1%:

Left side: 1 - (1.01)^-16 ≈ 1 - 0.8537 ≈ 0.1463

Right side: 14.5 × 0.01 = 0.145

So 0.1463 ≈ 0.145. Close, but slightly higher on the left. So with r=1%, left side is 0.1463, right side is 0.145. So we need to increase r slightly to make the left side smaller.

Let’s try r=1.05%:

(1.0105)^-16 = 1/(1.0105)^16 ≈ 1/1.18 ≈ 0.847.

1 - 0.847 = 0.153.

Right side: 14.5 × 0.0105 = 0.15225.

So 0.153 ≈ 0.15225. Very close. So r is approximately 1.05% per month.

Thus, the monthly interest rate is about 1.05%. To find the annual rate, we can multiply by 12: 1.05% × 12 = 12.6% per annum. But wait, that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the effective annual rate, which is (1 + r)^12 - 1. Let's compute that.

(1 + 0.0105)^12 ≈ e^(12 * 0.0105) ≈ e^0.126 ≈ 1.134.

So effective annual rate is about 13.4%. Hmm, that's close to option F:13.5%.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made an error.

Wait, when I used r=1%, the factor was 14.63, which gave a PV of 109.725, which was higher than 108.75. Then, when I tried r=1.05%, the factor was 14.571, giving PV=109.283, which is still higher. So perhaps the actual r is a bit higher than 1.05%.

Wait, because at r=1.05%, the right side is 0.15225, and the left side is 0.153. So the left side is higher, meaning we need a slightly higher r to make the left side lower.

Let me try r=1.1%.

(1.011)^16. Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute (1.011)^16:

We can compute step by step.

1.011^1 = 1.011

^2 = 1.011 *1.011= approx 1.022121

^4 = (1.022121)^2 ≈ 1.0447

^8 = (1.0447)^2 ≈ 1.0915

^16 = (1.0915)^2 ≈ 1.191

So 1/(1.011)^16 ≈ 1/1.191 ≈ 0.8397.

So 1 - 0.8397 = 0.1603.

Now, 14.5 × 0.011 = 0.1595.

So 0.1603 ≈ 0.1595. So r=1.1% gives us a left side of 0.1603 and right side of 0.1595. So we're very close. So the actual r is just a bit over 1.1%, perhaps 1.1% is a good approximation.

So monthly rate is approximately 1.1%. Then, the annual rate would be 1.1% × 12 = 13.2% (simple interest), or the effective annual rate is (1 + 0.011)^12 -1.

Calculating (1.011)^12:

Again, step by step.

1.011^1 =1.011

^2=1.022121

^3≈1.0333

^4≈1.0446

^5≈1.0560

^6≈1.0677

^7≈1.0800

^8≈1.0926

^9≈1.1055

^10≈1.1187

^11≈1.1321

^12≈1.1459

So (1.011)^12 ≈1.1459, so effective annual rate is about 14.59%. Hmm, that's around 14.6%, which is option D.

But wait, that's the effective annual rate, but the question is asking for the interest rate involved, which is likely the APR, which is 12 × monthly rate. So if the monthly rate is 1.1%, APR is 13.2%, which is close to option F:13.5%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the effective annual rate. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:16.3%, B:17.8%, C:19.9%, D:14.6%, E:11.7%, F:13.5%, G:15.2%, H:20.6%, I:18.5%, J:12.4%.

So 14.6% is option D, and 13.5% is F. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try a different method.

The total amount paid is $136.25 (down payment + installments). The principal is $125. So the interest is $11.25.

But the time period is 16 months. So the simple interest formula is I = P × R × T. So R = I/(P×T).

I = 11.25, P=125, T=16/12 years.

So R = 11.25 / (125 × (16/12)).

Compute denominator: 125 × (16/12) = 125 × 1.3333 ≈ 166.6667.

So R = 11.25 / 166.6667 ≈ 0.0675, or 6.75% per annum. But that's way lower than the options given, so this approach must be incorrect because installment plans don't use simple interest like that; it's usually based on the average balance or something else.

So perhaps the correct approach is using the present value of the annuity, which I did earlier, leading to an effective annual rate of around 14.59%, which is close to option D:14.6%.

Alternatively, perhaps the APR is 12 × monthly rate, which would be 12 × 1.1% = 13.2%, which is close to option F:13.5%.

But I'm a bit confused because the effective annual rate is higher, but APR is lower.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the APR, not the effective rate. Let me check the options again. Option D is 14.6%, which is close to the effective annual rate I calculated, while option F is 13.5%, which is close to the APR.

Wait, but in my earlier trial, the monthly rate was approximately 1.1%, giving an APR of 13.2% and effective annual rate of ~14.6%. So perhaps the correct answer is D:14.6%.

But let me verify once more. Let me compute with r=1.1% per month.

So (1.011)^16 ≈ 1.191, as before.

So 1/(1.011)^16 ≈ 0.8397.

1 - 0.8397 = 0.1603.

0.1603 / 0.011 ≈14.57.

So 7.50 ×14.57 ≈109.275, which is still a bit higher than 108.75. So maybe the exact rate is a bit higher than 1.1%.

Let me try r=1.15% per month.

Compute (1.0115)^16.

Using logarithms again:

ln(1.0115)≈0.01143.

16 ×0.01143≈0.1829.

e^0.1829≈1.200.

So 1/(1.0115)^16≈1/1.200≈0.8333.

1 - 0.8333=0.1667.

0.1667 /0.0115≈14.49.

So 7.50 ×14.49≈108.675, which is very close to 108.75.

So at r=1.15%, the PV is approximately 108.675, which is just slightly less than 108.75. So the exact r would be just a bit above 1.15%.

So let's say r≈1.15% per month.

Then, APR is 12 ×1.15% =13.8% per annum.

Effective annual rate is (1.0115)^12 -1.

Compute (1.0115)^12.

Again, step by step:

1.0115^1=1.0115

^2≈1.0232

^4≈(1.0232)^2≈1.0469

^8≈(1.0469)^2≈1.0964

^12=1.0964 ×1.0469 ≈1.150.

So effective annual rate is ~15.0%, which is option G:15.2%. Hmm, close but not exact.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute (1.0115)^12 more accurately.

Alternatively, let's compute it as:

(1.0115)^12 = e^(12 * ln(1.0115)).

ln(1.0115)≈0.01143.

12 ×0.01143=0.1372.

e^0.1372≈1.147.

So effective annual rate is 14.7%, which is close to option D:14.6%.

But wait, in the earlier calculation using r=1.15% per month, the PV was 108.675, which is very close to 108.75. So perhaps the monthly rate is approximately 1.15%, leading to an effective annual rate of around 14.7%.

Given the options, D is 14.6%, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula to solve for r. But without a calculator, this is time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use linear approximation between r=1.1% and r=1.15%.

At r=1.1%, PV≈109.275.

At r=1.15%, PV≈108.675.

We need PV=108.75, which is 108.75-108.675=0.075 above PV at r=1.15%.

The difference between r=1.1% and r=1.15% is 0.05%, which causes a drop in PV by 109.275 - 108.675 = 0.6.

We need to cover 0.075, so the required increase in r beyond 1.15% is (0.075 / 0.6) ×0.05%≈0.00625%.

So r≈1.15% +0.00625%≈1.15625%.

So the monthly rate is approximately 1.15625%.

Then, the effective annual rate is (1.0115625)^12 -1.

Compute ln(1.0115625)≈0.01151.

12 ×0.01151≈0.1381.

e^0.1381≈1.1478.

So effective annual rate≈14.78%, which is close to option D:14.6% and option I:18.5% is too high.

Wait, no, 14.78% is closer to 14.6% and 15.2% (option D and G). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try another approach.

The correct way is to use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula and solve for r. However, solving for r requires trial and error or a financial calculator. Since I don't have a calculator, I'll try to estimate it more accurately.

Given that at r=1.1%, the PV is 109.275, which is $0.525 higher than 108.75.

At r=1.15%, PV is 108.675, which is $0.075 lower than 108.75.

So, the required r is between 1.1% and 1.15%.

The difference between 1.1% and 1.15% is 0.05%, which causes a change in PV of 109.275 - 108.675 = 0.6.

We need to cover 0.525 (from 109.275 to 108.75), which is 0.525/0.6 = 0.875 of the interval.

So, the required r is 1.1% + 0.875 ×0.05% =1.1% +0.04375% =1.14375% per month.

So, approximately 1.14375% per month.

Now, the effective annual rate is (1.0114375)^12 -1.

Compute ln(1.0114375)= approx 0.01139.

12×0.01139=0.1367.

e^0.1367≈1.147.

So, effective annual rate≈14.7%.

Looking back at the options, the closest is D:14.6% and G:15.2%. Since 14.7% is closer to 14.6%, I think the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the APR, which is 12 × monthly rate. So 12 ×1.14375%≈13.725%, which is close to option F:13.5%.

But in my earlier calculation, the effective annual rate was about 14.7%, which is closer to D:14.6%.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A:16.3%, B:17.8%, C:19.9%, D:14.6%, E:11.7%, F:13.5%, G:15.2%, H:20.6%, I:18.5%, J:12.4%.

So, 14.6% is option D, which is very close to my calculation of 14.7%.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is D:14.6%.
</think>

To calculate the interest rate for purchasing the desk on installment, we first determine the total amount paid, which is the down payment plus all monthly payments. The total payments are:

\[
\text{Total Payments} = \$16.25 + (16 \times \$7.50) = \$16.25 + \$120 = \$136.25
\]

The principal amount financed is:

\[
\text{Principal} = \$125 - \$16.25 = \$108.75
\]

The interest paid is the difference between the total payments and the principal:

\[
\text{Interest} = \$136.25 - \$108.75 = \$27.50
\]

To find the interest rate, we use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
\text{PV} = \text{PMT} \times \left( \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \text{PV} = \$108.75 \)
- \( \text{PMT} = \$7.50 \)
- \( n = 16 \) months

Rearranging to solve for \( r \), we find that the monthly interest rate is approximately \( 1.1\% \). Converting this to an annual percentage rate (APR) gives:

\[
\text{APR} = 12 \times 1.1\% = 13.2\%
\]

However, considering the effective annual rate (EAR), which accounts for compounding:

\[
\text{EAR} = (1 + 0.011)^{12} - 1 \approx 14.7\%
\]

Given the options, the closest match to the effective annual rate is **14.6%**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
