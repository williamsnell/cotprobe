Okay, so I have this problem here: If m and n are odd integers, how many terms in the expansion of (m + n)^6 are odd? The options are from A to J, but I need to figure it out step by step.

First, I remember that when you expand a binomial like (a + b)^k using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form C(k, r) * a^(k-r) * b^r. In this case, a is m and b is n, and k is 6. So each term would be C(6, r) * m^(6 - r) * n^r.

But wait, the question is about whether these terms are odd. Since m and n are both odd, their powers will also be odd. Let me think: any odd number raised to any power remains odd. Because odd * odd = odd, so odd squared is odd, cubed is odd, etc. So m^(6 - r) is odd, and n^r is also odd, since both m and n are odd.

So the product m^(6 - r) * n^r would be odd * odd, which is odd. Now, the binomial coefficient C(6, r) is multiplied by this product. So the term's parity (whether it's odd or even) depends on whether C(6, r) is odd or even.

So the key is to find how many of the binomial coefficients C(6, r) for r = 0 to 6 are odd. Because if C(6, r) is odd, then the entire term is odd (since odd * odd = odd). If C(6, r) is even, then the term would be even (since even * anything is even).

So now I need to figure out which binomial coefficients in the expansion of (m + n)^6 are odd. Let's list them out:

For (m + n)^6, the binomial coefficients are C(6, 0), C(6, 1), C(6, 2), C(6, 3), C(6, 4), C(6, 5), C(6, 6).

Calculating each:

C(6, 0) = 1, which is odd.
C(6, 1) = 6, which is even.
C(6, 2) = 15, which is odd.
C(6, 3) = 20, which is even.
C(6, 4) = 15, which is odd.
C(6, 5) = 6, which is even.
C(6, 6) = 1, which is odd.

So counting the odd coefficients: 1 (C(6,0)), 15 (C(6,2)), 15 (C(6,4)), 1 (C(6,6)). That's four terms.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Sometimes there's a pattern in binomial coefficients' parity. I remember that the number of odd coefficients in C(n, k) for k from 0 to n is 2^s, where s is the number of ones in the binary representation of n.

In this case, n is 6. Let's write 6 in binary. 6 is 110 in binary, which has two 1s. So 2^2 = 4. That matches the four odd coefficients we found. So that must be correct.

Therefore, the number of odd terms in the expansion is 4. Looking back at the options, D is 4. So the answer should be D.

The number of odd terms in the expansion of (m + n)^6 is determined by the binomial coefficients C(6, r) being odd. Since 6 in binary is 110 (two 1s), the number of odd coefficients is 2^2 = 4. Thus, the answer is D.

Answer: D
