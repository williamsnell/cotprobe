Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about two groups of women: Group 1 spends less than $500 annually on clothes, and Group 2 spends over $1000. We're given p₁ and p₂ as the proportions of women in each group who believe clothes are too expensive. 

The data provided is that 1009 out of 1230 women from Group 1 believe clothes are too expensive, and 207 out of 340 women from Group 2 feel the same way. The question is asking for a point estimate of p₁ - p₂. 

Hmm, point estimate usually means we're looking for a single value that estimates the parameter. In this case, the parameter is the difference between two proportions, p₁ and p₂. So, the point estimate would just be the difference between the sample proportions, right?

Let me break it down. For Group 1, the sample proportion, which I'll call p̂₁, is the number of women who believe clothes are too expensive divided by the total sample size. So, that's 1009 divided by 1230. 

Similarly, for Group 2, p̂₂ is 207 divided by 340. Once I have both p̂₁ and p̂₂, I can subtract p̂₂ from p̂₁ to get the point estimate of p₁ - p₂.

Let me calculate p̂₁ first: 1009 ÷ 1230. Let me do that division. 1009 divided by 1230. Hmm, let's see. Well, 1230 times 0.8 is 984, because 1230 * 0.8 = 984. Then, 1009 - 984 is 25. So, 25/1230 is approximately 0.0203. So, adding that to 0.8 gives me 0.8203. Wait, that can't be right because 0.8203 times 1230 would be around 1009. Let me check with a calculator approach. 

Wait, 1230 divided by 1009. Let me use a different method. 1009 ÷ 1230. Let me compute this as a decimal. 

1230 goes into 1009 zero times. So, 1009 divided by 1230 is the same as 1009/1230. Let me compute that. 

Well, 1230 × 0.8 = 984, as before. So, subtract 984 from 1009, which leaves 25. So, 25/1230 is approximately 0.0203. So, adding that to 0.8 gives 0.8203. So, p̂₁ is approximately 0.8203.

Now, p̂₂ is 207 ÷ 340. Let me calculate that. 340 × 0.6 = 204, because 340 × 0.6 = 204. Then, 207 - 204 = 3, so 3/340 is approximately 0.0088. So, adding that to 0.6 gives 0.6088. Wait, that seems low, but let me confirm. 

Wait, 340 × 0.6 = 204, correct. So, 207 is 3 more than 204, so 207/340 = 0.6 + 3/340. 3/340 is roughly 0.0088, so total is approximately 0.6088. So, p̂₂ ≈ 0.6088.

Now, the point estimate for p₁ - p₂ is p̂₁ - p̂₂, which is 0.8203 - 0.6088. Let me subtract these. 

0.8203 minus 0.6088. 

0.8203 - 0.6 is 0.2203.

Then, subtract 0.0088: 0.2203 - 0.0088 = 0.2115.

Wait, that gives me 0.2115. Looking at the options, option A is 0.2115. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me recalculate p̂₁. 1009 divided by 1230. Let me do this more accurately.

1009 ÷ 1230.

Let me compute this as a decimal:

1230 × 0.8 = 984.

1009 - 984 = 25.

So, 25 ÷ 1230 ≈ 0.0203.

So, 0.8 + 0.0203 = 0.8203. That seems correct.

Now, p̂₂: 207 ÷ 340.

340 × 0.6 = 204.

207 - 204 = 3.

3 ÷ 340 ≈ 0.0088235.

So, 0.6 + 0.0088235 ≈ 0.6088235.

So, p̂₁ - p̂₂ = 0.8203 - 0.6088235 ≈ 0.2114765, which is approximately 0.2115. So, that's option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the groups. The question says Group 1 is the ones who spend less than $500, and Group 2 spends over $1000. So, p₁ is the proportion for Group 1, and p₂ is for Group 2. So, the point estimate is p₁ - p₂, which is 0.8203 - 0.6088 ≈ 0.2115. So, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A is 0.2115, which matches. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check if I did the division correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1009/1230 and 207/340 precisely.

Let me compute 1009 ÷ 1230:

1230 × 0.82 = 1230 × 0.8 + 1230 × 0.02 = 984 + 24.6 = 1008.6. Oh, that's very close to 1009. So, 0.82 gives 1008.6, which is just 0.4 less than 1009. So, 1009 is 1008.6 + 0.4, so the decimal would be 0.82 + (0.4/1230). 

0.4 ÷ 1230 ≈ 0.000325. So, total p̂₁ ≈ 0.820325, which is approximately 0.8203.

Similarly, for 207 ÷ 340: 340 × 0.6088235 ≈ 207, as before.

So, yeah, the difference is about 0.2115, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate p̂₂. 207 ÷ 340. Let me compute that precisely.

340 × 0.6 = 204. 207 - 204 = 3. So, 3 ÷ 340 is 0.0088235. So, 0.6 + 0.0088235 ≈ 0.6088235.

So, p̂₁ is approximately 0.8203, p̂₂ is approximately 0.6088. 

Subtracting them: 0.8203 - 0.6088 = 0.2115. Yep, that's correct.

So, the answer must be option A: 0.2115.

The point estimate of \( p_1 - p_2 \) is calculated by subtracting the sample proportions of the two groups. For Group 1, the sample proportion is \( \hat{p}_1 = \frac{1009}{1230} \approx 0.8203 \), and for Group 2, it is \( \hat{p}_2 = \frac{207}{340} \approx 0.6088 \). The difference is \( 0.8203 - 0.6088 = 0.2115 \), which corresponds to option A.
