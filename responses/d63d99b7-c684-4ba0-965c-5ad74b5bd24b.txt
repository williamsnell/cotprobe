Question:

Which of these statements best describes the HM approach to sectoral security analysis?

Options:

A: HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.
B: HM rejects Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, on the grounds that securitization is a product of a state-centric approach.
C: HM maintains that the sectoral approach to security analysis is too state-centric and argues for a more people-focused approach.
D: HM supports the sectoral approach to security analysis, but believes that it should be expanded to include non-state actors as well.
E: HM favours the sectoral approach to security analysis, in particular prioritising the state as a referent object and drawing much of its theoretical foundations from the realist principles that underpin the sectoral approach.
F: HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach.
G: HM accepts the sectoral approach in principle, but argues that it must be reinterpreted in the context of a globalized world.
H: HM uses the sectoral approach as a starting point, but modifies it to include a wider range of security issues, such as environmental and economic security.
I: HM agrees with Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, but argues that it needs to be more inclusive of transnational and non-state actors.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the HM approach to sectoral security analysis. Let me start by breaking down the question and the options.

The question is asking which statement best describes the HM (Human Security) approach. I remember that Human Security is a different take on security that focuses more on individuals and communities rather than just states. It's broader and includes things like economic, environmental, and social security.

Looking at the options:

Option A says HM rejects Buzan's idea of distinct sectors and takes a holistic view, considering national and transnational class. Hmm, Buzan's sectoral approach does talk about different sectors like military, economic, etc., so if HM is holistic, that might fit.

Option B says HM rejects Buzan's theory because it's state-centric. I think Buzan's approach is indeed state-centric, so maybe HM would argue against that. But I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option C states HM thinks the sectoral approach is too state-centric and wants a people-focused approach. That makes sense because Human Security is people-centered, so this could be a good candidate.

Option D says HM supports the sectoral approach but wants to include non-state actors. Well, HM does focus beyond states, so maybe expanding the sectors to include them. But does it support the approach as is?

Option E suggests HM favors the sectoral approach, prioritizing the state and using realist principles. That seems more like traditional security studies, which HM is against, so probably not.

Option F says HM agrees with the sectoral framework and appreciates its depth. It doesn't mention any modification, so maybe, but I'm not sure if HM would fully agree without changes.

Option G says HM accepts the sectoral approach but reinterprets it for globalization. That could make sense, as HM considers global issues.

Option H mentions using sectoral approach as a starting point but adding more issues like environmental and economic security. That sounds like expanding beyond the traditional sectors, which fits with HM's broader view.

Option I says HM agrees with Buzan but wants it more inclusive. So HM would take Buzan's approach but add transnational and non-state actors. That seems plausible.

Now, I need to recall what the Human Security approach actually says. HM emphasizes that security should be understood in terms of the safety and well-being of individuals and communities, rather than just states. It's critical of traditional state-centric views.

Looking at Buzan et al.'s sectoral approach, they identify different sectors (military, political, economic, etc.) and analyze security within each. But HM argues that this is too state-focused and needs a more inclusive, people-centered approach.

So, looking back at the options:

Option C says HM maintains the sectoral approach is too state-centric and argues for a more people-focused approach. That aligns with what I remember about HM.

Option I says HM agrees with Buzan but wants more inclusivity. But I think HM doesn't just agree; it fundamentally critiques the state-centric nature of sectoral analysis.

Option H talks about expanding the sectors to include more issues, which is part of it, but the main point is the shift from state to people.

So, the best fit is likely Option C. HM thinks the sectoral approach is too state-centric and pushes for a people-focused method.

The HM approach to sectoral security analysis critiques Buzan et al.'s theory for being too state-centric and advocates for a more people-focused perspective, emphasizing individual and community well-being over state interests.
