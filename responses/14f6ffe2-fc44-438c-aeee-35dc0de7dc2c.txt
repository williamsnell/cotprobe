Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about determining the available energy associated with a 10 cubic meter perfect vacuum and its surroundings at a certain pressure and temperature. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with energy availability, especially in thermodynamic systems, concepts like work and heat transfer come into play. The problem mentions a perfect vacuum, which means the pressure inside the system is zero. But the surroundings are at 0.100 MPa and 300 K. Wait, so the system is a vacuum, and the surroundings are at atmospheric pressure, I suppose.

I think the key here is to consider the expansion or compression of the system. Since the system is a vacuum, if it's allowed to expand into the surroundings, it might do work. But wait, in a vacuum, there's no gas inside, so maybe the work is done on the system when the surroundings at higher pressure push into it.

Available energy—oh right, that's the maximum work extractable from a system undergoing a reversible process. For an ideal gas, the available energy is related to enthalpy. But wait, the system here is a perfect vacuum, so initially, there's no gas. But perhaps when it's allowed to expand, the gas from the surroundings (which is at 0.100 MPa and 300 K) does work on the system.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. If the system is a vacuum, and the surroundings are at higher pressure, when the system is allowed to expand, the surroundings push into it, doing work. The energy available would then be the work done by the surroundings on the system.

Alternatively, considering the first law, the change in internal energy would relate to heat and work. But since it's a perfect vacuum, maybe the internal energy change is zero because there's no substance to exchange energy with. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as a process where the system, initially a vacuum, allows gas from the surroundings to enter when the valve is opened, say. The gas expands into the vacuum, doing work. The available energy would be the maximum work possible, which is the work done during reversible expansion.

The formula for work in such a case is P_ext * ΔV, but wait, for a reversible process, the work is ∫ P dV. If the process is isothermal and the gas expands into a vacuum, the work done by the gas is P_ext * V, but wait, no, the correct approach is to use the ideal gas law and calculate the work done.

Wait, the ideal gas equation is PV = nRT. So the number of moles that enter the system can be calculated based on the pressure and volume change.

Wait, but the system is a vacuum, so initial pressure is zero. When the valve is opened, the gas from the surroundings at 0.100 MPa (which is 100 kPa) and 300 K expands into the 10 m³ volume. So the final pressure would drop, but assuming it's a quick process, maybe it's not isothermal. Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the gas expands into the vacuum, and the work done is P_ext * V, where V is the volume of the system.

Wait, let me think again. The maximum work obtainable from a system at constant temperature and pressure is given by the Gibbs free energy. But in this case, since it's a vacuum, perhaps the available energy is the work done when the gas expands into the vacuum.

The formula for maximum work when a gas expands reversibly into a vacuum is P_ext * V, where P_ext is the external pressure and V is the volume. So in this case, P_ext is 0.100 MPa, which is 100 kPa, and V is 10 m³. So the work W would be 100,000 Pa * 10 m³ = 1,000,000 J, which is 1,000 kJ.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, using the ideal gas law, the number of moles that enter can be found. The surroundings' pressure is P = 100 kPa, T = 300 K. The volume that the gas expands into is 10 m³. So the number of moles n = PV/(RT). R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So P = 100,000 Pa, V = 10 m³, T = 300 K. So n = (100,000 * 10) / (8.314 * 300) ≈ (1,000,000) / (2494.2) ≈ 401.2 moles.

The internal energy change ΔU for an ideal gas is nCvΔT. But if the process is isothermal, ΔT is zero, so ΔU is zero. Then the work done would be equal to the heat absorbed, but since it's expanding against a vacuum, maybe the work is P_ext * V.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The available energy (exergy) for a system is given by the formula:

Exergy = P_ext * V - nRT ln(P_ext / P_system) 

But in this case, the system is a vacuum, so P_system is zero. Hmm, that might not work because ln(0) is undefined. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, considering the process where the system (vacuum) expands into the surroundings, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the surroundings are at higher pressure, so the system (vacuum) would allow the surrounding gas to expand into it, doing work on the system.

The maximum work would be when the expansion is reversible and isothermal. So the work done by the gas expanding into the vacuum is W = nRT ln(V_final / V_initial). But since the system is a vacuum, V_initial is zero, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as the gas expanding into a fixed volume, so the work is P_ext * V.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the formula again. The available energy when a gas at P, T expands into a vacuum (where P = 0) is P_ext * V, assuming V is the volume it expands into. So P = 100 kPa, V = 10 m³. So W = 100,000 * 10 = 1,000,000 J = 1,000 kJ.

Looking at the options, F is 1,000 kJ. So the answer should be F.

The problem involves determining the available energy associated with a 10 m³ perfect vacuum and its surroundings at a pressure of 0.100 MPa and a temperature of 300 K. The key is to calculate the maximum work obtainable when the gas from the surroundings expands into the vacuum. 

Since the system is a perfect vacuum, the gas from the surroundings at 0.100 MPa (100 kPa) and 300 K expands into the 10 m³ volume. The maximum work done during this process is given by the formula:

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} \cdot V
\]

where \( P_{\text{ext}} = 100,000 \, \text{Pa} \) and \( V = 10 \, \text{m}^3 \). Substituting these values:

\[
W = 100,000 \cdot 10 = 1,000,000 \, \text{J} = 1,000 \, \text{kJ}
\]

Thus, the available energy is 1,000 kJ, corresponding to option F.
