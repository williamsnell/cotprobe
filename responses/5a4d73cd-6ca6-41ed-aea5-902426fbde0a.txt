Okay, so I have this question about the Pleistocene epoch and how long ago it ended. I'm a bit rusty on my geology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Pleistocene is one of the epochs within the Quaternary period. Quaternary started about 2.6 million years ago, right? So the Pleistocene must be a part of that. But how long did the Pleistocene last?

Wait, I think the Pleistocene is the second epoch in the Quaternary, coming after the Pliocene. So the Quaternary is divided into two: the earlier Pliocene and then the Pleistocene. Or wait, no, the Quaternary has the Pleistocene and the Holocene. Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up.

Wait, no, the Quaternary period is divided into the Pleistocene and the Holocene. The Holocene is the current epoch, which started around 11,700 years ago. So if the Holocene started about 12,000 years ago, then the Pleistocene must have ended around then.

So the Pleistocene epoch ended approximately 12,000 years ago. Looking at the options, option J is 10,000 years ago. That's close. But wait, is it exactly 10,000 or around 12,000? Because I think the exact date is around 11,700 years ago, but maybe the question is asking in a general sense.

Looking at the options, J is 10,000 years, which is the closest. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the epochs. Let me check: the Pleistocene is the earlier part of the Quaternary, ending about 12,000 years ago, and then the Holocene began. So the answer should be around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Since the options don't have 12,000, the closest is J:10,000 years.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the dates are approximate. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the end of the Pleistocene as about 10,000 years ago. I think I've heard it referred to as ending around 10,000 years ago, so J is the right choice.

The Pleistocene epoch ended approximately 10,000 years ago, making option J the correct answer.
