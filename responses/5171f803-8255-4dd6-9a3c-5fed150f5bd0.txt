Okay, I have to answer this multiple-choice question about the rules governing the placement of words and phrases in a sentence. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the rules that determine how words and phrases are arranged in a sentence. So, I need to remember the different areas of linguistics and what each one covers.

First, let's go through the options:

A: Semiotics. I recall that semiotics is the study of signs and symbols, particularly in language and communication. It's more about meaning and how signs convey messages, so I don't think this is about sentence structure.

B: Phonology. Phonology deals with the patterns and structures of sounds in a language. It's about how sounds combine and the rules that govern them, not the placement of words.

C: Lexicology. This is the study of words, their origins, meanings, and usage. It's more about vocabulary than sentence structure.

D: Pragmatics. Pragmatics is about the context and meaning in which language is used. It deals with how people interpret sentences in different contexts, not the actual structure of the sentences themselves.

E: Grammar. Grammar is a broad term, but it generally refers to the rules governing the structure of a language, including syntax and morphology. However, the question is specifically about placement, which might point more directly to a subfield of grammar.

F: Orthography. This is about the conventional spelling system of a language. It's more about how words are written rather than how they are structured in sentences.

G: Phonemes. Phonemes are individual units of sound in a language. This is a concept within phonology, not about sentence structure.

H: Syntax. Syntax is the study of the structure of sentences, including how words and phrases are arranged to form grammatical sentences. This seems to fit the question perfectly because it's directly about the placement of words.

I: Morphology. Morphology deals with the structure of words and how they are formed from smaller units like morphemes. It's more about word structure than sentence structure.

J: Semantics. Semantics is about the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. While important, it's not about the placement rules.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: Syntax because it directly deals with the arrangement of words and phrases in sentences.
