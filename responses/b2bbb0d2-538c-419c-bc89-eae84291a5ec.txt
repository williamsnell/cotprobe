Okay, so I need to figure out which statement is false among the options A to G. Let's go through each one step by step.

Starting with option A: 5 > 3. That's definitely true because 5 is bigger than 3.

Option B: 10 < 20. Yep, 10 is less than 20, so that's true too.

Option C: -3 > -5. Hmm, negative numbers can be tricky. I remember that when comparing negatives, the one with the smaller absolute value is actually larger. So -3 is greater than -5 because -3 is to the right of -5 on the number line. So C is true.

Option D: 3 < 5. That's straightforward; 3 is less than 5, so D is true.

Option E: -10 < -5. Wait, is that right? No, actually, -10 is less than -5 because it's further to the left on the number line. So E is saying -10 is less than -5, which is correct. So E is true.

Option F: 0 > -1. Zero is greater than any negative number, so 0 is indeed greater than -1. F is true.

Now option G: -5 > -3. Wait, this doesn't seem right. Because -5 is to the left of -3 on the number line, which means -5 is less than -3. So the statement -5 > -3 is false. So G is the false statement.

Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't make a mistake. A is 5>3, correct. B is 10<20, correct. C is -3>-5, correct. D is 3<5, correct. E is -10<-5, correct. F is 0>-1, correct. G is -5>-3, which is wrong because -5 is less than -3. So yes, G is the false statement.

The false statement is G: −5 > −3.
