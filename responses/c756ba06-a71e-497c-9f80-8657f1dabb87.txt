Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how many grieving individuals might need professional help. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that grief is a natural response to loss, but sometimes it can become complicated and require help. I've heard terms like "complicated grief" before, which is when someone doesn't improve on their own and might need intervention.

I think most people go through grief and don't need professional help. They might feel sad for a while, but eventually, they can manage with support from friends and family. So maybe only a smaller portion actually need help.

Looking at the options: A is nearly one-third, which is about 30%. E is 15%, F is 25%, G is nearly half, which is around 50%, and J is more than 50%. On the higher end, H is 60%, I is 75%, and B is 90%. D is less than 10%, which seems low, and C is almost all, which I don't think is right because I've heard that most people recover on their own.

I think the percentage is somewhere around 10-20%. Wait, I remember reading somewhere that about 10-15% of people experience complicated grief that requires professional help. So maybe E, which is about 15%, is the answer. Alternatively, I've heard numbers like 10-20%, so maybe 15% is a good estimate.

Another angle: I think some studies suggest that a small percentage, maybe around 10-15%, might need help beyond normal bereavement. So E seems plausible. But I'm not entirely certain. I might be confusing it with other statistics. Alternatively, I've heard that roughly 10% is the figure often cited for those needing professional help.

Wait, another thought: some sources say that about 10-15% of mourners develop complications that require intervention. So that points towards E being the correct answer. Or maybe it's A, which is nearly one-third, but I think 15% is more accurate.

I'm a bit torn between E and maybe A, but I think E is more precise. So I'll go with E: About 15%.

The answer is E: About 15%.

Answer: E
