Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out whether a precipitate will form when H2S is bubbled into a solution containing Zn²+ and Cu²+ ions. Both ions are at 0.02 M concentration, and the solution is made 1M in H3O+. The given Ksp values are Ksp of ZnS = 1 × 10^-22 and Ksp of CuS = 8 × 10^-37. Also, the K_eq for H2S when saturated is 1 × 10^-22.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with precipitation, the solubility product (Ksp) is key. The idea is to compare the ion product (Q) of the solution to the Ksp. If Q exceeds Ksp, precipitation occurs.

First, I need to find the concentration of sulfide ions (S²-) in the solution after H2S is bubbled in. Since H2S is a weak acid and a weak base, it dissociates in steps. The presence of H3O+ (which is H+) will affect this dissociation.

The K_eq given is 1 × 10^-22. Wait, K_eq usually refers to the equilibrium constant for a reaction. For H2S, which dissociates as H2S ↔ H+ + HS⁻, and HS⁻ ↔ H+ + S²-, but K_eq might be the overall K for H2S dissociation. Alternatively, maybe it's the K for the reaction H2S + 2H2O ↔ S²- + 4H3O+, which would combine both dissociation steps. In that case, K_eq would be ( [S²-][H3O+]^4 ) / [H2S]. But the exact form might influence the S²- concentration.

Wait, the K_eq is given as 1 × 10^-22 when saturated. So when H2S is bubbled until saturation, the solution has a certain concentration of H2S. The K_eq would help us find the concentration of S²-.

Alternatively, maybe the K_eq here is the same as the Ksp for sulfide in solution. Wait, no, Ksp is for the dissolution of a salt, while K_eq is for the acid dissociation of H2S.

So, the dissolution of H2S in water can be written as:
H2S ↔ 2H+ + S²- 

But wait, that's not correct. Actually, H2S dissociates in two steps:
H2S ↔ H+ + HS⁻ (K1)
HS⁻ ↔ H+ + S²- (K2)

The overall reaction is H2S ↔ 2H+ + S²- with K = K1*K2.

But the problem says K_eq is 1e-22. So, K = [H+²][S²-]/[H2S] = 1e-22.

But since the solution is saturated with H2S, the concentration of H2S is its solubility in water. At 25°C, the solubility of H2S is about 0.1 M, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. Alternatively, perhaps the H2S is in excess, so [H2S] is approximately constant and can be considered as the solubility.

Wait, but the problem states that H3O+ is made 1M. So [H+] = 1 M. That's a high concentration of H+ which would shift the dissociation of H2S to the left, making S²- less likely. But wait, wait, H+ is 1 M, which is quite high. Let me think.

If [H+] is 1 M, then the first dissociation K1 for H2S is about 1e-7 (I think K1 is about 1e-7, K2 is about 1e-19). Let me check: yes, K1 ≈ 1e-7, K2 ≈ 1e-19.

But the given K_eq is 1e-22, which is the product K1*K2 = 1e-26. Wait, that's conflicting. Hmm, maybe the K_eq given is not the overall K but another value. Alternatively, perhaps the K_eq given is for the reaction H2S + 2H2O ↔ S²- + 4H3O+ (since each H2O donates a H+). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

Given that the solution has [H+] = 1 M, and we're adding H2S until it's saturated, what's the [S²-]?

Let's model the H2S dissociation considering the high H+.

The overall reaction is H2S ↔ 2H+ + S²-.

But since [H+] is 1 M, which is much higher than the H+ produced by H2S, the dissociation will be suppressed. So the [S²-] will be low.

The K for the overall reaction is K = K1*K2 ≈ (1e-7)(1e-19) = 1e-26.

Wait, but the given K_eq is 1e-22, which is higher than 1e-26, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the K_eq here.

Alternatively, maybe the K_eq is for HS⁻, but no. Alternatively, perhaps the K_eq refers to the solubility of S in the presence of H+.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let's think about the sulfide ion concentration.

In a solution with high H+ (1 M), the sulfide ion concentration can be calculated using the K_eq provided.

Given K_eq = [S²-][H+]^4 / [H2S] = 1e-22.

Assuming that [H2S] is approximately its solubility, but since it's saturated, perhaps [H2S] is around 0.1 M or something, but maybe we can approximate [H2S] as a constant. Alternatively, since H3O+ is 1 M, [H+] = 1 M.

So, K_eq = [S²-]*(1)^4 / [H2S] = 1e-22.

If H2S is saturated, [H2S] is roughly its solubility in water, say about 0.1 M, but perhaps more accurately, let's say it's S. But without exact solubility, perhaps we can assume that [H2S] is in excess and remains approximately constant, so [S²-] ≈ (K_eq * [H2S]) / [H+]^4.

Wait, but if [H+] is 1 M, [H+]^4 = 1. So [S²-] ≈ K_eq * [H2S]. But since [H2S] is around 0.1 M, [S²-] ≈ (1e-22) * 0.1 = 1e-23 M.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to calculate [S²-] using the given K_eq and [H+] = 1 M.

Let me write the reaction as H2S ↔ 2H+ + S²-.

The K for this reaction is K = [H+]^2 [S²-] / [H2S].

Given K = 1e-22 (since K_eq is given as 1e-22 for the saturated solution), and [H+] = 1 M.

So,

1e-22 = (1^2) [S²-] / [H2S].

Assuming [H2S] is approximately its solubility, which is around 0.1 M, then:

[S²-] = (1e-22) * [H2S] ≈ (1e-22)(0.1) = 1e-23 M.

Wait, but if [H2S] is saturated, perhaps [H2S] is higher? Or maybe it's more accurate to consider that [H2S] is in excess, so [H2S] ≈ 0.1 M.

So [S²-] ≈ 1e-23 M.

Now, let's compute the ion product Q for ZnS and CuS.

For ZnS: Q = [Zn²+][S²-] = (0.02 M)(1e-23) = 2e-25.

Compare to Ksp of ZnS = 1e-22.

Since Q = 2e-25 < 1e-22, ZnS will not precipitate.

For CuS: Q = [Cu²+][S²-] = (0.02 M)(1e-23) = 2e-25.

Compare to Ksp of CuS = 8e-37.

Here, Q = 2e-25 > 8e-37, so CuS will precipitate.

Wait, that's interesting. So CuS has a much lower Ksp, so even a small amount of S²- would cause it to precipitate before ZnS.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

[S²-] is 1e-23 M.

ZnS: 0.02 * 1e-23 = 2e-25. Ksp ZnS is 1e-22. So 2e-25 < 1e-22 → no precipitation.

CuS: 0.02 * 1e-23 = 2e-25. Ksp CuS is 8e-37. 2e-25 >8e-37 → precipitation occurs.

So CuS will precipitate first because its Ksp is much lower. But wait, does the order matter here? Since both are present, the one with lower Ksp will precipitate first as S²- is added.

Wait, but in this case, when H2S is bubbled, S²- is introduced. The first to precipitate would be the one with the lower Ksp, which is CuS (8e-37 < 1e-22).

So, the solution will precipitate CuS first, and then, as more S²- is added, ZnS might precipitate if [S²-] increases enough. But in this case, the [S²-] is 1e-23, which is enough for CuS to precipitate but not for ZnS.

Wait, but the problem states that H2S is bubbled until the solution is saturated. So the [S²-] is fixed at 1e-23 M in this scenario.

So, only CuS will precipitate because its Ksp is exceeded, but ZnS's Ksp isn't. So the answer should be precipitation of CuS.

Looking at the options, option C is Precipitation of CuS.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is to calculate the minimum [S²-] needed for each to precipitate.

For CuS: [S²-] needed = Ksp / [Cu²+] = (8e-37) / 0.02 = 4e-35 M.

For ZnS: [S²-] needed = (1e-22)/0.02 = 5e-21 M.

The actual [S²-] is 1e-23 M.

Compare:

1e-23 < 4e-35 → no, wait, 1e-23 is larger than 4e-35. Because 1e-23 is 1e22 times larger than 4e-35. So [S²-] is higher than needed for CuS precipitation, so CuS will precipitate.

For ZnS, [S²-] needed is 5e-21 M. The actual is 1e-23, which is lower than 5e-21. So ZnS won't precipitate.

So only CuS precipitates. So the answer is option C: Precipitation of CuS.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way: the lower the Ksp, the more soluble it is? No, higher Ksp means more soluble. CuS has a much lower Ksp, so it's less soluble, so it precipitates first.

Yes, so the correct answer should be C: Precipitation of CuS.

To determine whether a precipitate forms when H₂S is bubbled into a solution containing Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ ions, we analyze the solubility product constants (Ksp) and the concentration of sulfide ions (S²⁻) in the solution.

### Key Information:
1. **Concentrations of metal ions**:  
   - [Zn²⁺] = 0.02 M  
   - [Cu²⁺] = 0.02 M  

2. **Ksp values**:  
   - Ksp of ZnS = \(1 \times 10^{-22}\)  
   - Ksp of CuS = \(8 \times 10^{-37}\)  

3. **K_eq for H₂S (saturated solution)**:  
   - \(K_{\text{eq}} = 1 \times 10^{-22}\)  

4. **[H₃O⁺] = 1 M** (high H⁺ concentration suppresses S²⁻ formation).

### Step 1: Calculate [S²⁻] in the solution
The dissociation of H₂S can be represented as:  
\[
\text{H}_2\text{S} \leftrightarrow 2\text{H}^+ + \text{S}^{2-}
\]  
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as \(K_{\text{eq}} = 1 \times 10^{-22}\). Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_{\text{eq}} = \frac{[\text{S}^{2-}][\text{H}^+]^4}{[\text{H}_2\text{S}]}
\]  
Assuming [H₂S] is approximately constant (due to saturation), and [H⁺] = 1 M, we solve for [S²⁻]:  
\[
[\text{S}^{2-}] = \frac{K_{\text{eq}} \cdot [\text{H}_2\text{S}]}{[\text{H}^+]^4} = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-22}) \cdot [\text{H}_2\text{S}]}{1^4} = 1 \times 10^{-22} \cdot [\text{H}_2\text{S}]
\]  
The solubility of H₂S in water is approximately 0.1 M, so:  
\[
[\text{S}^{2-}] \approx (1 \times 10^{-22}) \cdot 0.1 = 1 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 2: Determine if precipitation occurs
The ion product \(Q\) for each sulfide is calculated as:  
\[
Q = [\text{M}^{2+}][\text{S}^{2-}]
\]  
- For ZnS:  
  \[
  Q_{\text{ZnS}} = (0.02)(1 \times 10^{-23}) = 2 \times 10^{-25}
  \]  
  Compare to \(K_{\text{sp}}\) of ZnS (\(1 \times 10^{-22}\)):  
  \[
  Q_{\text{ZnS}} < K_{\text{sp}} \implies \text{No precipitation of ZnS}
  \]

- For CuS:  
  \[
  Q_{\text{CuS}} = (0.02)(1 \times 10^{-23}) = 2 \times 10^{-25}
  \]  
  Compare to \(K_{\text{sp}}\) of CuS (\(8 \times 10^{-37}\)):  
  \[
  Q_{\text{CuS}} > K_{\text{sp}} \implies \text{Precipitation of CuS occurs}
  \]

### Conclusion:
Only CuS precipitates because its Ksp is much smaller than the ion product \(Q\), while ZnS does not precipitate as \(Q_{\text{ZnS}} < K_{\text{sp}}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Precipitation of CuS**
