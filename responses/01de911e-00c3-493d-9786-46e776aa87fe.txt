Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the electric field in the Earth's atmosphere. Hmm, let me read it again. The electric field is directed vertically downward. At 300 meters altitude, the field is 60 N/C, and at 200 meters, it's 100 N/C. We need to find the net charge inside a cube that's 100 meters on each edge. The cube has horizontal faces at 200 and 300 meters altitude.

Wait, so the cube is like a box extending from 200m to 300m in the vertical direction, and 100m in each horizontal direction. So its height is 100m, matching the edge length. Got it.

I remember that Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, where Φ is the electric flux. Electric flux is the integral of E dot dA over the surface. Since the field is vertical and the faces are horizontal, the flux will depend on the top and bottom faces, because E is perpendicular to those, and zero on the sides since E is vertical and the sides are vertical.

Wait, no, the sides are vertical, and E is also vertical, so the dot product E·dA for the side faces would be E times A cosine(theta), where theta is the angle between E and the normal to the area. Since E is vertical and the sides are vertical, the angle is 0 degrees, so cosine is 1. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the electric field is directed vertically down, so the normal to the top and bottom faces is vertical up and down respectively. So for the top face, E is downward, and the normal is upward, so the angle is 180 degrees. For the bottom face, the normal is downward, same direction as E, so angle is 0 degrees.

Wait, but the cube's sides: the left, right, front, back faces. Their normals are horizontal. So the electric field is vertical. The dot product E·dA for those side faces would be E * dA * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between E (vertical) and the normal (horizontal). So that's 90 degrees, so cos(theta)=0. So the flux through the sides is zero. So only the top and bottom faces contribute.

So the total flux Φ is the sum of the flux through the top and bottom. Now, flux through a surface is E * A * cos(theta). For the top face, E is down, normal is up, so theta is 180 degrees, cos(theta)=-1. So flux_top = E_top * A * (-1). Similarly, flux_bottom = E_bottom * A * (1), because the normal is down, same as E, so cos(theta)=1.

Wait, let me get this right. The top face has E pointing down, while the normal (outward) points up. So the angle between E and the normal is 180 degrees, because E is opposite to the normal. So cos(theta) is -1. So flux through top is E_top * A * (-1).

The bottom face has E pointing down, and the normal also points down. So the angle is 0 degrees, cos(theta)=1. So flux through bottom is E_bottom * A * 1.

So total flux Φ = (E_bottom * A) - (E_top * A). Because flux_top is negative, and flux_bottom is positive.

Then, using Gauss's Law: Φ = Q_enc / ε₀. So Q_enc = Φ * ε₀.

The cube has edge length 100m, so each face is a square of 100m x 100m. So area A = (100m)^2 = 10^4 m².

Given E at 300m is 60 N/C downward, and at 200m is 100 N/C downward.

Wait, the top face is at 300m. So E_top is 60 N/C, downward. The bottom face is at 200m, E_bottom is 100 N/C downward.

So plugging in the numbers: Φ = (100 N/C * 1e4 m²) - (60 N/C * 1e4 m²) = (100 - 60) * 1e4 = 40 * 1e4 = 4e5 N·m²/C.

Wait, wait, because E_bottom is at 200m, so that's the bottom face. So flux_bottom = E_bottom * A. And flux_top = -E_top * A, because E is down and normal is up. So Φ = E_bottom * A - E_top * A.

So Φ = (100 - 60) * 1e4 = 40 * 1e4 = 4e5 N·m²/C.

Then Q_enc = Φ * ε₀.

Wait, no, Φ is equal to Q_enc / ε₀. So Q_enc = Φ * ε₀.

Wait, wait, Φ = E_bottom * A - E_top * A = (E_bottom - E_top) * A.

So let's compute that:

E_bottom = 100 N/C, E_top = 60 N/C, so difference is 40 N/C.

A = (100 m)^2 = 1e4 m².

So Φ = 40 * 1e4 = 4e5 N·m²/C.

Now, using Q_enc = Φ * ε₀.

But wait, no, Gauss's Law is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, so Q_enc = Φ * ε₀.

Wait, no, wait. No, Gauss's Law is Φ = E * A * (difference terms) = Q_enc / ε₀. So Q_enc is Φ multiplied by ε₀.

So, I think I have to compute Q_enc = (E_bottom * A - E_top * A) * ε₀.

Wait, wait, actually, Φ is the integral of E·dA, which for the cube is (E_bottom * A - E_top * A). So Φ = (E_bottom - E_top) * A.

Then, Q_enc = Φ * ε₀ = (E_bottom - E_top) * A * ε₀.

Wait, but let me make sure about the signs. Since the flux through the top is negative, and bottom positive, the net flux is positive, so the enclosed charge could be positive or negative based on the direction of the field.

Wait, but in this case, the field is stronger at the bottom. So the flux is positive, which would imply that the enclosed charge is positive because the flux is outward (since net flux is positive, meaning more leaving than entering, so positive charge inside).

But wait, the direction of E is downward, so a positive charge would create an E field pointing away, which is upward. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, the flux is Φ = E_bottom * A - E_top * A = (100 - 60) * 1e4 = 4e5 N·m²/C. Since this is positive, that means the net flux is outward. So according to Gauss's Law, the enclosed charge must be positive, because positive charges emit flux outward.

Wait, but in this case, the E field is directed downward, so perhaps the flux is actually the other way. Let me think again.

Wait, when E is downward, the flux through the bottom face (where E is down and the normal is down) is positive because E and the normal are in the same direction. The flux through the top face is E down and normal up, so the flux is negative. So the net flux is positive (100 - 60) * A.

So the net flux is positive, so the enclosed charge is positive.

But let's proceed.

Compute Q_enc = (E_bottom - E_top) * A * ε₀.

So, (100 - 60) = 40 N/C.

A = 100^2 = 1e4 m².

ε₀ is approximately 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²).

So Q_enc = 40 * 1e4 * 8.85e-12.

Compute 40 * 1e4 = 4e5.

4e5 * 8.85e-12 = ?

4e5 = 4 * 1e5.

Multiply by 8.85e-12: 4 * 8.85 = 35.4 → 35.4e-7 = 3.54e-6 C.

Wait, wait, 4e5 * 8.85e-12 = (4 * 8.85) * 1e5 * 1e-12 = 35.4 * 1e-7 = 3.54e-6 C.

Which is 3.54 microcoulombs. Looking at the options, option C is 3.54 μC.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 40 * 1e4 = 4e5. Then 4e5 * 8.85e-12 = ?

Let me compute 4e5 * 8.85e-12:

4e5 is 4 * 1e5.

8.85e-12 is 8.85 * 1e-12.

Multiply them together: 4 * 8.85 = 35.4.

And 1e5 * 1e-12 = 1e-7.

So 35.4e-7 = 3.54e-6 C, which is 3.54 μC.

So the answer should be option C: 3.54 μC.

Wait, but wait another thing. The cube extends 100m in each horizontal direction as well. So the horizontal faces are at 200m and 300m, but the cube is a cube, so its extent in the horizontal directions (like east-west and north-south) is also 100m each. So the area for each horizontal face is 100m * 100m = 1e4 m², which I used correctly.

So I think that's correct. So the answer is C.

To solve the problem, we use Gauss's Law, which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity of free space, \( \Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0} \). The electric field is directed vertically downward, so the flux only contributes from the top and bottom faces of the cube, as the sides have no flux contribution (the electric field is perpendicular to the side faces).

The cube has edge length \( 100 \, \text{m} \), so each face has an area \( A = 100^2 = 10^4 \, \text{m}^2 \). The electric field at the top face (300 m altitude) is \( E_{\text{top}} = 60 \, \text{N/C} \), and at the bottom face (200 m altitude) is \( E_{\text{bottom}} = 100 \, \text{N/C} \).

The flux through the top face is negative because the electric field points downward while the normal vector points upward:
\[
\Phi_{\text{top}} = -E_{\text{top}} \cdot A = -60 \cdot 10^4 = -6 \times 10^5 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}.
\]
The flux through the bottom face is positive because the electric field and normal vector are in the same direction:
\[
\Phi_{\text{bottom}} = E_{\text{bottom}} \cdot A = 100 \cdot 10^4 = 10 \times 10^5 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}.
\]
The total flux is:
\[
\Phi = \Phi_{\text{bottom}} + \Phi_{\text{top}} = 10 \times 10^5 - 6 \times 10^5 = 4 \times 10^5 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}.
\]
Using Gauss's Law, the enclosed charge is:
\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \Phi \cdot \varepsilon_0,
\]
where \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/(\text{N·m}^2) \). Substituting the values:
\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = 4 \times 10^5 \cdot 8.85 \times 10^{-12} = 3.54 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} = 3.54 \, \mu\text{C}.
\]
Thus, the net charge contained in the cube is \( 3.54 \, \mu\text{C} \), corresponding to option C.
