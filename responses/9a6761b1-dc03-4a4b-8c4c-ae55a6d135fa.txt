Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure out if each statement is true or false. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. I need to evaluate each one and then select the correct option from A to J based on my analysis.

Starting with Statement 1: "Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10." Hmm, I remember that abelian groups of order 45 can be classified using the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups. The order 45 factors into 9 * 5, which are 3² and 5¹. So the possible abelian groups are the direct products of cyclic groups whose orders multiply to 45.

The abelian groups of order 45 are:
1. Cyclic group Z45.
2. The direct product Z9 × Z5.

Wait, but Z9 and Z5 are cyclic, and since 9 and 5 are coprime, Z9 × Z5 is actually isomorphic to Z45. So both structures are the same. So there's only one abelian group of order 45, which is cyclic of order 45.

Now, does this group have a subgroup of order 10? Well, in a cyclic group of order n, for every divisor d of n, there exists a unique subgroup of order d. So since 10 divides 45? Wait, 45 divided by 10 is 4.5, which isn't an integer. So 10 doesn't divide 45. Therefore, 10 is not a divisor of 45, which means there's no subgroup of order 10 in Z45.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Because 45 is 9*5, and 10 is 2*5. So 5 is a common factor, but 2 doesn't divide 9. So since 10 doesn't divide 45, the group Z45 can't have a subgroup of order 10. So Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Are there any abelian groups of order 45 that are not cyclic? Because if there's another structure, perhaps it could have a subgroup of order 10. Let me think again. According to the fundamental theorem, the abelian groups of order 45 are determined by the partitions of the exponents in their prime factorization. Since 45 is 3² * 5¹, the possible groups are Z9 × Z5, which is the same as Z45, and that's the only one. So no, there are no other abelian groups of order 45. So the only abelian group of order 45 is cyclic, and it doesn't have a subgroup of order 10. So Statement 1 is false.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: "A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H." Hmm, I remember that the number of left cosets of H in G is equal to the index [G:H], which is the same as the number of right cosets. Because for any subgroup H, left and right cosets have the same number. So, the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets regardless of whether H is normal or not. So if H is normal, the left and right cosets are the same, but the number is the same even if H isn't normal. Therefore, the condition in Statement 2 is always true, regardless of H being normal. So the 'if and only if' here is incorrect because the equality of the number of left and right cosets doesn't imply H is normal. Wait, actually, the number of left and right cosets is always equal to the index, so Statement 2 is saying that H is normal iff the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets. But since those numbers are always equal (they're both equal to [G:H]), the condition is trivially true. So the statement is saying that H is normal iff [G:H] is equal to itself, which is a tautology. Therefore, the 'if and only if' is not correct because the number of left and right cosets being equal doesn't tell us anything about normality—it's always the same. So the statement is saying H is normal iff something that's always true, which would make it true only when H is normal. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, no, the 'if and only if' implies that the condition (equal number of left and right cosets) is equivalent to H being normal. But the number of left and right cosets is always equal. So the condition holds for all H, whether normal or not. Therefore, the equivalence is not correct. Because if H is not normal, the number of left and right cosets is still equal. So the 'if and only if' is false because the statement claims that H is normal exactly when the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets, which is always true. So the condition is necessary but not sufficient. So Statement 2 is false because it's claiming an equivalence that doesn't hold.

Wait, but wait another moment. For any subgroup H, the number of left cosets is [G:H], same as right cosets. So the equality holds for any H, normal or not. So the forward direction of the equivalence is true: if H is normal, then the number of left and right cosets are equal (in fact, they're the same sets). But the converse isn't true because the number of cosets is always equal, whether H is normal or not. So the equivalence is not correct. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but the statement says "if and only if". So it's claiming that H is normal precisely when the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets. But since the number of left and right cosets are always equal, regardless of H being normal, the "if and only if" is incorrect because H could be not normal, but the numbers are equal. So Statement 2 is false.

So, to recap: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false. Now looking at the options:

A: 1T, 2F → No, because 1 is F.

B: F,F → Yes.

C: 1F, 2F → Yes.

D: 1F, 2T → No.

E: T,T → No.

F: T,T → No.

G: T,F → No.

H: F,T → No.

Wait, I thought Statement 2 was false, but in my initial analysis, I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check Statement 2.

Statement 2: H is normal iff the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets.

Wait, but the number of left cosets is equal to the index [G:H], and the number of right cosets is also [G:H]. So the equality holds for any H. So the condition is always true, regardless of H being normal. So the statement is saying H is normal iff something that's always true. That would mean that H is normal iff True, which would make H normal always, which is not the case. So the statement is incorrect because it's asserting that H is normal exactly when the number of left and right cosets are equal, which is always true. Therefore, the equivalence is wrong. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but let me think differently. For H to be normal, the left and right cosets must be the same. But the number of cosets is the same whether H is normal or not. So the condition in Statement 2 is not about the cosets being the same, but just their count. So the count is equal, but that doesn't imply H is normal. So the 'if and only if' is incorrect because the condition is always true, so H being normal is not equivalent to that condition. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. So looking at the options, the correct choice would be option B: False, False. Or is there another option where both are false? Looking back, option C is Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is False. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought Statement 1 was false because 10 doesn't divide 45, so the abelian group of order 45 (which is cyclic) doesn't have a subgroup of order 10. So Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is also false because the number of left and right cosets are always equal, so the equivalence is incorrect. So the correct option is C: Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is False.
</think>

The first statement is false because the only abelian group of order 45 is cyclic (isomorphic to Z45), and since 10 does not divide 45, it lacks a subgroup of order 10. The second statement is false because the number of left and right cosets of any subgroup H is always equal (both equal to the index [G:H]), making the equivalence incorrect.

Answer: C
