Okay, so I've got this question about the synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template. Hmm, I need to figure out which enzymes and primers are required for this process.

Let me start by recalling what I know about DNA and RNA synthesis. I remember that RNA can serve as a template for DNA synthesis, which is part of processes like reverse transcription. Wait, reverse transcriptase is the enzyme that can make DNA from RNA, right?

So, if we're making an RNA/DNA hybrid, that means one strand is RNA and the other is DNA. This process is similar to what happens during reverse transcription. Reverse transcription uses an RNA template to create a complementary DNA strand. But wait, in that case, do we need a primer? I think primers are necessary because DNA polymerases can't initiate synthesis on their own; they can only add nucleotides to an existing strand.

Primers can be DNA or RNA. In the case of reverse transcription, I think the primer is typically RNA. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait, in some cases, like with reverse transcriptase in labs, they might use a DNA primer. Or maybe it's an RNA primer? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Reverse transcriptase can use either, but in the context of the question, it's about synthesizing the DNA from RNA, so the primer could be DNA or RNA.

Wait, no. Actually, the primer can be DNA or RNA because reverse transcriptase can function with either. So the process would involve having a primer that anneals to the RNA template. So the primer could be DNA or RNA, and then the enzyme would be reverse transcriptase.

So looking at the options, option D says a DNA or RNA primer and reverse transcriptase. That seems to fit. Let me look at the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: RNase only. No, RNase breaks down RNA, which is the opposite of what we want. We need to build, not break down.

Option B: DNA primer and RNase. RNase again doesn't help in synthesis, so probably wrong.

Option C: DNA or RNA primer and DNA polymerase. Wait, DNA polymerase usually works on DNA, not RNA. Unless it's a special case. But for RNA templates, I think reverse transcriptase is needed, not DNA polymerase.

Option E: RNA primer and DNA polymerase. Again, DNA polymerase might not work with RNA as a template. Unless it's a specific type, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option F: DNA polymerase only. No, same issue as C and E; polymerase might not work on RNA.

Option G: RNA primer and reverse transcriptase. This is part of option D, but D includes either DNA or RNA primer, so G is a subset, but D is more general.

Option H: reverse transcriptase and RNase. RNase would degrade RNA, which isn't helpful for synthesis.

Option I: reverse transcriptase only. But you need a primer to start the synthesis, so I don't think this is correct.

Option J: DNA primer, RNA primer, and reverse transcriptase. That seems like too many. You wouldn't need both a DNA and RNA primer at the same time.

So putting it all together, the correct process requires a primer (either DNA or RNA) and reverse transcriptase. So the answer should be option D.
</think>

The synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template involves the use of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that can create DNA from an RNA template. Additionally, a primer is required to initiate the synthesis, as DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases cannot start synthesis on their own. The primer can be either DNA or RNA, depending on the specific context or system used. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: a DNA or RNA primer and reverse transcriptase**

Answer: D
