Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about restriction enzymes. Let me read the question again. It's asking what restriction enzymes are, why their discovery was important in genetic engineering, and what a restriction map is. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that restriction enzymes are something to do with cutting DNA. I think they're also called restriction nucleases. They specifically cut DNA at certain sequences. So looking at the options, I should find which one describes that.

Option A says they cut DNA at random. No, that's not right because they have specific recognition sites. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says they modify DNA by adding methyl groups. Wait, that sounds like methylation, which is part of how some enzymes work, but I think restriction enzymes cut DNA, they don't add methyl groups. So B is not correct.

Option C talks about joining DNA strands by hydrogen bonds. That sounds more like DNA ligase, which joins fragments, not restriction enzymes. So C is wrong.

Option D says they prevent DNA breakdown. I don't think so. Restriction enzymes cut DNA, so they wouldn't prevent breakdown. Maybe D is incorrect.

Option E says they bind to DNA to prevent interactions. That sounds like a DNA binding protein, but not exactly restriction enzymes. So E isn't right.

Option F mentions speeding up DNA synthesis. No, restriction enzymes don't synthesize DNA; they cut it. So F is out.

Option G says they're RNA that signals for transcription. No, restriction enzymes are proteins, not RNA. So G is wrong.

Option H says they assist in DNA replication. While enzymes do help in replication, I don't think restriction enzymes are directly involved in replication. They are more about cutting. So H might not be correct.

Option I says they're nucleases that recognize specific DNA sequences and cut. Yes, that sounds right. Restriction enzymes do exactly that. So I is a good candidate.

Option J says they're synthetic molecules to link DNA. That sounds like DNA ligase, not restriction enzymes. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer for the first part is option I. Now, why were their discovery important in genetic engineering? Well, restriction enzymes allow scientists to cut DNA at specific points, making it easier to isolate and manipulate genes. Before their discovery, cutting DNA was more random and difficult. This made cloning and genetic engineering possible on a more precise level.

Lastly, a restriction map is a diagram that shows the locations of restriction enzyme recognition sites on a DNA molecule. It helps in planning where to cut the DNA to isolate specific genes or fragments. So the restriction map is a tool that relies on the use of restriction enzymes.

Putting it all together, the correct answer is option I.

The correct answer is I. Restriction enzymes are nucleases that recognize specific DNA sequences and cut the DNA at those sites. Their discovery was crucial for genetic engineering because they enabled precise cutting of DNA, facilitating gene manipulation, cloning, and the creation of recombinant DNA. A restriction map is a tool that shows where these enzymes cut a DNA molecule, aiding in the organization and analysis of genetic material.

Answer: I
