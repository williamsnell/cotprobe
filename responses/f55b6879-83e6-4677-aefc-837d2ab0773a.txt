Okay, so I need to figure out how much Molly paid in total after her haircut and tip. Let me start by understanding the problem. Molly went to get a haircut that cost $25, and she left a 15% tip. I need to find the final amount she paid, which includes both the haircut cost and the tip.

Hmm, so the total cost is the sum of the original amount and the tip. The tip is calculated as a percentage of the original amount. So, first, I should calculate 15% of $25, and then add that to $25 to get the total.

Wait, how do I calculate 15% of $25? I remember that percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100. So, 15% is 0.15. Then, I multiply 0.15 by 25 to get the tip amount.

Let me do that calculation: 0.15 * 25. Hmm, 0.15 times 20 is 3, and 0.15 times 5 is 0.75, so adding those together gives 3 + 0.75 = 3.75. So the tip is $3.75.

Now, I need to add that tip to the original $25. So, $25 + $3.75 = $28.75. That should be the total amount Molly paid.

Looking at the options, I see that option E is $28.75. So that's the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 15% of 25 is indeed 3.75 because 10% is 2.5, and 5% is 1.25, so adding those gives 3.75. Adding that to 25 gives 28.75. Yep, that makes sense.

Molly's total cost is the sum of the haircut price and a 15% tip. Calculating 15% of $25 gives $3.75, which added to $25 results in $28.75.

Answer: E
