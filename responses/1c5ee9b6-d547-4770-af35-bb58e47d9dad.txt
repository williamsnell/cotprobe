Okay, so I have this question about Earth's internal structure, and I need to figure out which option provides the most information about the core, mantle, and lower crust. Let me think through each option one by one.

The question is asking which method has given us the most info on the structure of Earth's core, mantle, and lower crust. So I'm considering each option and how relevant it is to understanding these layers.

Option A: Studies of the gravitational pull of the Earth. I know that gravity can tell us something about mass distribution, but I'm not sure if it's the most detailed for the internal structure. It might help with overall density, but maybe not the specifics of layers.

Option B: Examination of flowing lava. Lava comes from the mantle, so studying it could give info about the mantle's composition. But lava doesn't reach the core, so it's probably limited to the mantle and maybe the crust. Not sure if it's the most comprehensive.

Option C: Monitoring of Earth's tectonic plate movements. Tectonic activity relates to the mantle's convection, which affects plate movements. But does this provide direct info about the structure of the layers themselves? Maybe more about processes than the structure.

Option D: Observations of volcanic eruptions. Similar to option B, since eruptions bring up mantle material, but again, not reaching the core. So possibly useful for the mantle but not the other layers.

Option E: Inspection of surface rocks and minerals. Surface rocks are from the crust and maybe the mantle if they're from volcanic regions. So it gives info about the upper parts but not the deeper mantle or core.

Option F: Research on the composition of the atmosphere. Atmosphere composition relates to processes on the surface and maybe some mantle degassing, but not directly about the structure of the inner layers.

Option G: Studies of the speeds and travel paths of seismic waves passing through Earth. Oh, I remember that seismic waves are used in seismology to study Earth's interior. When an earthquake happens, the waves travel through different layers at different speeds, which helps map out the structure. This is probably the most comprehensive method because it can show changes in density and composition as the waves pass through each layer, including the core.

Option H: Collection of samples from deep boreholes. Boreholes have only gone a few kilometers into the crust, so they don't reach the mantle or core. Not much info from this method on the deeper layers.

Option I: Measurement of the intensity and fluctuations of Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field is generated by the core, so it tells us about the core's composition and dynamics, like whether it's liquid or solid. But does it give info about the mantle and crust structure? Maybe indirectly, but not as much as seismic data.

Option J: Analysis of weather patterns and climate changes. This relates more to the atmosphere and possibly some surface processes, not the internal structure.

So, putting it all together, the most comprehensive information about the structure of the core, mantle, and lower crust comes from studying seismic waves. Seismic data allows scientists to create models of Earth's interior, including the boundaries between the core and mantle, and the mantle and crust. It's like using echoes to map what's inside. So the answer should be G.

The most information about Earth's internal structure, including the core, mantle, and lower crust, has been provided by the study of seismic waves. These waves travel through Earth during earthquakes, and their speeds and paths reveal details about the layers' composition and boundaries. This method is more comprehensive than other options, which are limited in scope or do not reach the deeper layers.

Answer: G
