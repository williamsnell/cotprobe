Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Unless otherwise stated, thermodynamic data are for 298.15 K. When a certain freon used in refrigeration was expanded adiabatically from an initial pressure of $32 \mathrm{~atm}$ and $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to a final pressure of $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$, the temperature fell by $22 \mathrm{~K}$.

Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem about the Joule-Thomson coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that a freon gas is expanded adiabatically from 32 atm and 0°C to 1 atm, and the temperature drops by 22 K. I need to find the Joule-Thomson coefficient, μ, at 0°C, assuming it's constant.

Wait, wait. I remember that the Joule-Thomson coefficient is defined as the change in temperature with pressure at constant enthalpy. The formula I recall is μ = (∂T/∂P)_H. But how do I relate that to the given data here?

Oh, right! For an adiabatic expansion where enthalpy is constant, the change in temperature can be connected to the Joule-Thomson coefficient. The process isenthalpic since it's adiabatic and no work is done except at the throttle, so H is constant.

So, the formula for the temperature change when pressure changes is ΔT = μ * ΔP. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Is it ΔT equals μ times the change in pressure? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The Joule-Thomson coefficient is μ = (∂T/∂P)_H. So, if pressure decreases, the temperature change would be approximately μ multiplied by the pressure change. But considering that the process is from high pressure to low, and the temperature drops, so the coefficient will be positive if the temperature decreases when pressure decreases.

Let me write down what I know:

Initial pressure, P1 = 32 atm
Initial temperature, T1 = 0°C = 273.15 K
Final pressure, P2 = 1 atm
Change in pressure, ΔP = P2 - P1 = 1 - 32 = -31 atm
Change in temperature, ΔT = T2 - T1 = (273.15 - 22) - 273.15 = -22 K

Wait, because the temperature fell by 22 K, so T2 = T1 -22 = 273.15 -22 = 251.15 K? Or maybe I should just consider the change as ΔT = T_final - T_initial = 251.15 -273.15 = -22 K.

So, the change in temperature is ΔT = -22 K for a change in pressure ΔP = -31 atm.

So, the formula is ΔT ≈ μ * ΔP. Wait, but I have to make sure about the signs. Let me think again.

If pressure decreases (ΔP negative), the temperature drops (ΔT negative). So, μ would be positive because when pressure drops, temperature drops, so μ is positive. So, using ΔT = μ * ΔP,

ΔT = μ * (P2 - P1) → -22 K = μ * (-31 atm)

So solving for μ: μ = (-22 K) / (-31 atm) ≈ 0.71 K·atm⁻¹.

Wait, that matches option C, which is 0.71 K·atm⁻¹.

But wait, I should double-check the formula. Another way I remember is that for an ideal gas, the Joule-Thomson coefficient is zero because for ideal gases, enthalpy depends only on temperature. But freon is a real gas, so it can have a non-zero μ.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the relation:

ΔT = μ * (P2 - P1)

Which is the same as ΔT = μ * ΔP

So, using the values, ΔT is -22 K, ΔP is -31 atm.

So, μ = (ΔT) / (ΔP) = (-22) / (-31) ≈ 0.709677 K·atm⁻¹, which rounds to 0.71 K·atm⁻¹. So that's option C.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be C.

The Joule-Thomson coefficient, μ, is calculated using the relation:

\[
\Delta T = \mu \cdot \Delta P
\]

Given:
- Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 32 \, \text{atm} \)
- Final pressure, \( P_2 = 1.00 \, \text{atm} \)
- Change in pressure, \( \Delta P = P_2 - P_1 = -31 \, \text{atm} \)
- Initial temperature, \( T_1 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Final temperature, \( T_2 = T_1 - 22 \, \text{K} = 251.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Change in temperature, \( \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = -22 \, \text{K} \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\mu = \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta P} = \frac{-22 \, \text{K}}{-31 \, \text{atm}} \approx 0.71 \, \text{K·atm}^{-1}
\]

Thus, the Joule-Thomson coefficient at \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) is approximately \( 0.71 \, \text{K·atm}^{-1} \), corresponding to option C.
