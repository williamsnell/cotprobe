Okay, so I need to figure out which expression Ty can use to find out how many books he'll read in 12 weeks, given that he spends 2 weeks on each book. Let's break this down.

First, I know that Ty has a total of 12 weeks. Each book takes him 2 weeks to read. So, I'm trying to find out how many books he can finish in that time. 

Hmm, so if each book takes 2 weeks, then the number of books he can read would be the total weeks divided by the weeks per book. That makes sense because if you spend a certain number of weeks per book, dividing the total weeks by that number gives you the count of books.

So, mathematically, that would be 12 weeks divided by 2 weeks per book. Which is 12 / 2. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 12/2 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A through I. Let me list them again:

A: 2 / 12
B: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
C: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
D: 12 – 2 – 2 – 2
E: 12 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
F: 12 – 2
G: 12 * 2
H: 12 + 12
I: 12 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2

Wait, I thought the correct expression is 12 / 2, which is 6. But in the options, I don't see that. Let me see if any of the options simplify to that.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way. Maybe he's reading one book at a time, each taking 2 weeks, so the number of books is how many 2-week periods fit into 12 weeks. So that's 12 divided by 2, which is 6. So the expression is 12 ÷ 2, which is 6.

But none of the options directly show 12 ÷ 2. So perhaps I need to think differently. Alternatively, maybe the expression is 2 weeks per book times the number of books equals 12 weeks. So if the number of books is x, then 2x = 12. So x = 12 / 2 = 6, but again, not seeing that in the options.

Wait, looking at the options, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check each option:

A: 2 / 12 → that's 1/6, which doesn't make sense because 2 weeks per book, so we need to find how many books fit into 12 weeks, not the other way around.

B: 2 multiplied six times (2^6) which is 64, way too high.

C: 2 added six times (2*6=12), which would be 12, but that's the total weeks, not the number of books. Because if each book is 2 weeks, and you read 6 books, that's 12 weeks. So 2*6=12, but the expression C is 2+2+2+2+2+2, which is 12. So that seems to represent the total weeks, not the number of books.

Wait, but the question is asking for the expression to find the number of books. So if each book is 2 weeks, the number of books is 12 / 2 =6. So the expression should be 12 divided by 2, which is 6.

But in the options, I don't see 12 ÷ 2. Wait, looking at option G: 12 * 2, which is 24, that's wrong. Option C is 2+2+2+2+2+2, which is 12, but that's the total weeks. So that would be adding 2 weeks six times, implying six books. So if Ty reads six books, each taking 2 weeks, that's 12 weeks. So the expression 2+2+2+2+2+2 equals 12, which represents the total time. But the question is asking for the number of books, which is 6. So the expression that gives the number of books is 12 ÷ 2, which is 6.

But none of the options directly show that. Wait, looking again, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me check option I: 12 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2 – 2. That would be 12 minus (2*6) which is 12-12=0. That doesn't make sense.

Option C is adding 2 six times, giving 12, which is the total weeks. That's not the number of books. So perhaps the correct way is 12 divided by 2, but that's not an option. Wait, maybe I'm missing an option. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The number of books is the total weeks divided by weeks per book, so 12 /2=6. So the expression is 12/2, which is 6. But in the options, the expression 12/2 isn't present. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the expression, not the result. So the expression is 12 ÷ 2, which is not listed. So perhaps the options are not including division. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me read the question again.

"Ty has 12 weeks to read a certain number of books. He will spend 2 weeks reading each book. Which expression can Ty use to find the total number of books he will read?"

So the expression should calculate the number of books, which is 12 ÷ 2 =6. So the expression is 12 divided by 2, which is 6.

But looking at the options, I don't see 12 divided by 2. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the options incorrectly. Let me check option C: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. That's 2 added six times, which equals 12. So that would represent the total weeks, not the number of books. So if each book takes 2 weeks, then the number of books is 6, but the expression 2+2+2+2+2+2 equals 12, which is the total time, not the number of books.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The number of books is the total weeks divided by weeks per book, which is 12 ÷ 2 =6. So the expression is 12 / 2. Looking at the options, I don't see that, but perhaps option C is the total weeks, which is 12, but that's not the number of books.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each option again:

A: 2 /12 → 1/6 → no.

B: 2^6 → 64 → no.

C: 2+2+2+2+2+2 → 12 → which is the total weeks. So that's not the number of books.

D: 12 –2–2–2 → 12-6=6 → that would be 12 minus 2 three times, which equals 6. So that's the number of books. So D is 12-2-2-2=6.

Wait, but D is 12 – 2 – 2 – 2. That's subtracting 2 three times, which gives 12-6=6. So that would be the number of books. But wait, that assumes that Ty is subtracting 2 weeks three times, but he has 12 weeks and each book takes 2 weeks. So 12/2=6 books. Alternatively, if he subtracts 2 weeks six times, he would get 0, which is option I.

Wait, so option D subtracts 2 three times, giving 6, which is the number of books. But that's only three books, because 3*2=6 weeks, leaving 6 weeks unused. That's not correct because he has 12 weeks.

Wait, no, option D is 12 minus 2 minus 2 minus 2. So that's 12-6=6. So that's the number of books. Because each book takes 2 weeks, so 6 books would take 12 weeks. Wait, no, 6 books would take 6*2=12 weeks. So the total number of books is 6, so the expression should give 6. So option D is 12-2-2-2=6, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, 12-2-2-2 is 6. So that's three subtractions of 2, which gives 6. So that would be three books? Because 3 books *2 weeks=6 weeks, but he has 12 weeks. So that can't be right. I'm getting confused now.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me think again. If each book takes 2 weeks, then the number of books is 12 /2=6. So the expression should be 12/2=6. But in the options, I don't see that. So perhaps the correct way is to use multiplication: 2 * number of books =12, so number of books=12/2=6. So the expression is 12/2, which is option not present. So maybe the correct expression is 2*6, but that's the total weeks.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is 2 added six times, which is 12, but that's the total weeks, not the number of books.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: 2+2+2+2+2+2=12. That's the total weeks, which is 12. So if each book is 2 weeks, then the number of books is 6, which is 12/2=6. So the expression should be 12/2, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct option is C, but that's not the number of books. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is 12 divided by 2, which is 6. So the expression is 12/2. But looking at the options, I don't see that. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. How else can you represent 12 weeks divided by 2 weeks per book? Maybe as 12 ÷ 2, which is 6. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the options are written differently. Let me check option G: 12 * 2=24, which is wrong. Option C is 2+2+2+2+2+2=12, which is the total time, not the number of books.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to think of it as the number of books multiplied by weeks per book equals total weeks. So number of books = total weeks / weeks per book =12 /2=6.

So the expression is 12 /2=6. But none of the options show that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at option I: 12 – 2 –2 –2 –2 –2 –2. That's subtracting 2 six times, which is 12-12=0. So that's not correct.

Option D: 12 –2 –2 –2=6. So that's subtracting 2 three times, which gives 6. So that's the number of books, because 6 books *2 weeks=12 weeks. So 12- (2*3)=6, which is correct. So option D is 12 –2 –2 –2=6, which is the number of books.

Wait, but wait, 6 books would take 12 weeks, so 12-2*6=0, which is option I. So I'm getting confused. Let me calculate:

If each book takes 2 weeks, then the number of books is 12 /2=6. So the expression should be 12 /2. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct way is to add 2 weeks six times, which is 12, but that's the total weeks, not the number of books.

Wait, maybe the correct option is C: 2+2+2+2+2+2=12. But that's the total weeks, not the number of books. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is 12 divided by 2, which is 6. So the expression is 12/2, but that's not present. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options are written differently. Let me check each option again:

A: 2/12 → 1/6 → no.

B: 2^6=64 → no.

C: 2+2+2+2+2+2=12 → total weeks, not number of books.

D: 12 –2 –2 –2=6 → number of books.

E: 12 +2+2+2+2+2+2=24 → no.

F:12 –2=10 → no.

G:12*2=24 → no.

H:12+12=24 → no.

I:12 –2 six times=0 → no.

So option D gives 6, which is the correct number of books. So the expression is 12 –2 –2 –2=6. But wait, that's only subtracting 2 three times, which would mean 3 books (3*2=6 weeks), but Ty has 12 weeks. So that can't be right. I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, 12 –2 –2 –2=6. So that's subtracting 6 from 12, which gives 6, which is the number of books. Because each book takes 2 weeks, so 6 books take 12 weeks. So option D is correct.

Wait, but 12 –2 –2 –2=6. So that's subtracting 2 three times, which is 12-6=6. So that's correct because 6 books *2 weeks=12 weeks. So option D is correct.

Wait, but why is option D subtracting 2 three times? Because 3*2=6, which is the number of books. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is 12 divided by 2, which is 6. But since that's not an option, I have to choose from the given options. So option D gives the correct number of books.

Wait, but wait, 12 –2 –2 –2=6. So that's 3 subtractions of 2, giving 6. So that's the number of books, which is correct.

Yes, so the correct expression is option D: 12 –2 –2 –2=6.
</think>

To determine how many books Ty can read in 12 weeks, given that he spends 2 weeks per book, we need an expression that calculates the number of books. Since each book takes 2 weeks, the total number of books is the total weeks divided by the weeks per book: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \).

Among the options provided, option D: \( 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 \) simplifies to 6, which correctly represents the number of books Ty can read.
