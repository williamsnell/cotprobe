Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about art movements, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by breaking down the question. The question is asking which art movement abandoned the intention of making traditional, saleable art objects. The options are from A to J, each representing a different art movement.

First, I should probably recall what each of these movements is known for. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: Surrealists. Surrealism is a movement that emphasizes the expression of the unconscious mind, often using unexpected combinations of objects. I think they did create traditional art objects, like paintings and sculptures, so maybe they didn't abandon making saleable art.

Option B: Futurists. Futurism was all about the future, technology, and movement. They painted dynamic, often abstract works. I'm not sure if they abandoned traditional saleable art; I think they still sold their works, but maybe they focused more on themes rather than traditional techniques.

Option C: Cubists. Cubism is known for deconstructing objects into geometric shapes. They were still creating paintings and sculptures, so probably still making saleable art.

Option D: Pop artists. Pop art took inspiration from popular culture, using everyday objects and mass-produced items. They did create saleable works, so maybe not the answer here.

Option E: Realists. Realism is about depicting reality accurately, so they were definitely creating traditional art objects meant to be sold.

Option F: Abstract Expressionists. This movement is known for abstract works, often large and gestural. They did create paintings and sold them, so probably still making saleable art.

Option G: Conceptual artists. Hmm, conceptual art is more about the idea behind the work rather than the object itself. I think conceptual artists often focus on the concept, and the physical object might be secondary or even non-existent. So they might have abandoned making traditional saleable art objects. This sounds promising.

Option H: Impressionists. Impressionism is about capturing moments and impressions, often with loose brushwork. They sold their paintings, so not the answer.

Option I: Dadaists. Dada was a anti-art movement, rejecting traditional art forms and embracing chaos and nonsense. They might have created works that weren't traditional or saleable, but I'm not sure if they completely abandoned making objects for sale. Some Dada artists did create ready-mades, which were found objects presented as art, but I'm not certain if that's the same as abandoning the intention of making saleable art.

Option J: Fauvists. Fauvism is known for bold use of color and expressionistic style. They were still creating traditional art objects, so probably not the answer.

So, thinking through, the key here is the abandonment of making traditional, saleable art. Conceptual artists focus on ideas rather than the physical object, so they might not make traditional art objects meant for sale. Dadaists also did some radical things, but I think conceptual art is more directly associated with moving away from traditional saleable works.

Therefore, the answer is likely G: Conceptual artists.
