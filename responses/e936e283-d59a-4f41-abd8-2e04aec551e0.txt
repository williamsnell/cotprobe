Okay, so I have this question about bonds, and I need to figure out how much I have to invest to get an annual income of $3,000 from interest. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions $1,000 5% bonds. I think that means each bond has a face value of $1,000 and pays 5% interest annually. So, the annual interest per bond would be 5% of $1,000, which is $50. That makes sense because 5% of 1000 is 50.

Now, the goal is to have an annual income of $3,000 from interest. If each bond gives $50, how many bonds do I need? I guess I can divide 3,000 by 50. Let me calculate that: 3,000 รท 50 equals 60. So, I need 60 bonds to get $3,000 a year in interest. That part seems straightforward.

But wait, the bonds don't sell at face value; they're selling at 74 and 7/8. I need to convert that to a decimal to understand the price per bond. 7/8 is 0.875, so 74 and 7/8 is 74.875. So each bond costs $74.875. That's the price per bond.

Now, if I need 60 bonds, the total cost without any fees would be 60 multiplied by 74.875. Let me calculate that. 60 * 74.875. Hmm, let's break it down: 60 * 70 is 4,200, and 60 * 4.875 is... 4.875 * 60. Let me compute that: 4 * 60 is 240, 0.875 * 60 is 52.5. So 240 + 52.5 is 292.5. Adding that to 4,200 gives 4,492.5. So, without fees, the investment would be $4,492.50. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the options are much higher. Oh, wait, no, the options are in thousands, so maybe I made a mistake in the number of bonds or the price.

Wait, no, I think I might have miscalculated something. Let me double-check. Each bond is $74.875, and I need 60 of them. So 60 * 74.875. Let me compute this correctly. 74.875 * 60: 74 * 60 is 4,440, and 0.875 * 60 is 52.5. So adding them together, 4,440 + 52.5 = 4,492.5. So yes, that's $4,492.50. But looking at the options, the smallest is $30,000, which is way higher. So I must have missed something.

Oh, wait a second. The question says the bonds sell at 74 and 7/8, which is 74.875. But that's a percentage of the face value? Wait, no, in bond pricing, when they say a bond sells at 74(7/8), I think that's 74 and 7/8 dollars, not a percentage. Because if it were a percentage, selling at 74.875% of face value, that would mean each bond is $748.75, which seems too high. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Actually, when bonds are quoted, they are typically quoted as a percentage of their face value. So if a bond is selling at 74 and 7/8, that means it's selling at 74.875% of its face value. So each bond's cost would be 74.875% of $1,000. Let me calculate that: 74.875% of 1000 is 748.75. So each bond costs $748.75. Oh, that makes more sense because then the total investment would be higher, matching the options given.

So, each bond is $748.75, and I need 60 bonds. Let me compute 60 * 748.75. Let's break it down: 700 * 60 is 42,000. Then, 48.75 * 60. Let's calculate that: 40 * 60 is 2,400, and 8.75 * 60 is 525. So 2,400 + 525 = 2,925. Now, adding that to 42,000 gives 44,925. So, without fees, the total investment is $44,925.

But wait, there's also a brokerage fee of $5 per bond. Since I'm buying 60 bonds, the total fees would be 60 * $5 = $300. So I need to add that to the total investment. So $44,925 + $300 = $45,225.

Looking at the options, option C is $45,225. That should be the correct answer.

To determine the investment needed for an annual income of $3,000 from 5% bonds selling at 74(7/8) with a $5 brokerage fee per bond:

1. **Calculate Annual Interest per Bond**: Each $1,000 bond yields 5% annually, which is $50.
2. **Determine Number of Bonds**: To achieve $3,000 annually, divide $3,000 by $50, resulting in 60 bonds.
3. **Bond Price Calculation**: Bonds sell at 74(7/8) of face value, which is 74.875% of $1,000, totaling $748.75 per bond.
4. **Total Cost Without Fees**: Multiply 60 bonds by $748.75, yielding $44,925.
5. **Brokerage Fees**: 60 bonds ร $5 fee = $300.
6. **Total Investment**: Add fees to bond cost: $44,925 + $300 = $45,225.

**Answer: C**
