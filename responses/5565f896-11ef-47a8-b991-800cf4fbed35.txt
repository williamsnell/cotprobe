Okay, so I've got this problem here about a ball being thrown into the air, and I need to find its velocity at t=2 seconds. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem gives me the height equation: y = 40t - 16t². I remember that velocity is related to the derivative of the position function, so I'll need to find the derivative of y with respect to t to get the velocity function.

Let me recall how to take derivatives. The derivative of a term like at^n is n*at^(n-1). So for y = 40t - 16t², the derivative dy/dt (which is velocity) should be:

dy/dt = d/dt(40t) - d/dt(16t²)
       = 40*1 - 16*2t
       = 40 - 32t

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, when I take the derivative of 40t, that's just 40, right? Then the derivative of -16t² is -32t. So yes, the velocity function v(t) is 40 - 32t.

Now I need to find the velocity at t=2 seconds. So I substitute t=2 into the velocity function.

v(2) = 40 - 32*(2)
     = 40 - 64
     = -24 ft/s

Hmm, that would be option I: -24 ft/s. But wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative? Let me go through that again. The original position function is y = 40t - 16t².

Taking the derivative term by term:

- The derivative of 40t with respect to t is 40, because the derivative of t is 1, and 40*1 is 40.
- The derivative of -16t² is -16*2t, which is -32t.

So the velocity function is indeed v(t) = 40 - 32t. At t=2, plugging in:

v(2) = 40 - 32*(2) = 40 - 64 = -24 ft/s.

So that's correct. Looking at the options, option I is -24 ft/s. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in these problems, the acceleration due to gravity is modeled with 32 ft/s² downward, so the velocity function would have a negative coefficient for the t term. So in the derivative, it's correct that the velocity starts positive and becomes negative as time increases, which makes sense because the ball goes up, reaches a peak, and then comes back down.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the problem uses a different acceleration value, but the given equation is y=40t-16t², which aligns with using 16 as the coefficient for t², which comes from (1/2)gt² where g is 32 ft/s². So that part is correct.

So I think I'm confident that the velocity at t=2 is -24 ft/s, which is option I.

To find the velocity at \( t = 2 \) seconds, we start with the height function \( y = 40t - 16t^2 \). The velocity is the derivative of the height function with respect to time, which is \( v(t) = 40 - 32t \). Substituting \( t = 2 \) into the velocity function gives \( v(2) = 40 - 32 \times 2 = -24 \, \text{ft/s} \).
