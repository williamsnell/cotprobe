Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question says that at normal body temperature, which is 37°C or 98.6°F, the ionization constant of water, K_w, is 2.42 × 10^-14 moles squared per liter squared. A physician injects a neutral saline solution into a patient, and we need to find the pH of this solution once it's come into thermal equilibrium with the patient's body. The options are from A to J, with various pH values.

Hmm, I remember that at 25°C, which is room temperature, the K_w is 1.0 × 10^-14, and the pH of pure water is 7, which is neutral. But here, the temperature is higher, 37°C, so I think K_w increases because higher temperatures generally increase the ionization of water. That makes sense because heat usually increases reaction rates, including ionization.

So, the problem states that the solution is neutral saline. Wait, what does "neutral" mean here? For a saline solution, neutral probably means that it's isotonic with the patient's blood, so it doesn't cause cells to swell or shrink. But more importantly, in terms of pH, a neutral solution is one where the concentration of H+ ions equals the concentration of OH- ions. For pure water, that's pH 7 at 25°C. But at 37°C, since K_w is higher, the pH of pure water would be different.

Let me think: for pure water, the ionization is H2O ↔ H+ + OH-. At any temperature, the product [H+][OH-] equals K_w. For pure water, [H+] = [OH-] because it's neutral. So, each would be the square root of K_w. So, pH = pOH = (1/2) * log(K_w). Wait, no, wait. pH is -log[H+], so [H+] = sqrt(K_w). Then pH = -log(sqrt(K_w)).

So, let me calculate that. K_w is 2.42 ×10^-14. The square root of that would be sqrt(2.42e-14). Let me compute that. Let's see, sqrt(2.42) is approximately 1.555, and sqrt(1e-14) is 1e-7. So sqrt(2.42e-14) ≈ 1.555e-7 M. So [H+] is 1.555e-7 M. Then pH is -log(1.555e-7).

Calculating that: log(1.555e-7) is log(1.555) + log(1e-7). Log(1.555) is about 0.191, so total log is 0.191 -7 = -6.809. So pH is 6.809. Wait, that's about 6.8.

Wait, but wait a second, I'm a bit confused. Because if K_w increases with temperature, the pH of pure water would be lower than 7, right? Because at higher temperatures, water becomes more ionized. So, pure water at 37°C would have a pH less than 7. But the options given include 7.0, 7.4, etc. So, the answer must be around 6.8 or 7.0. Wait, but the answer I calculated was about 6.8, which is option A, but option I is 7.0. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check. K_w is 2.42e-14 at 37°C. So, for pure water:

[H+] = sqrt(2.42e-14) ≈ sqrt(2.42) * 1e-7. sqrt(2.42) is approximately 1.555, so [H+] = 1.555e-7 M. Then pH = -log(1.555e-7). Let me compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator, log(1.555) is about 0.191. So, log(1.555e-7) = 0.191 -7 = -6.809. So pH is 6.809, which rounds to 6.8. That's option A. But wait, in the options, option I is 7.0. Am I missing something?

Wait, but the question says it's a neutral saline solution. Oh, wait, is "neutral" referring to being isotonic, or is it referring to having a pH of 7? Because in the context of the human body, blood is slightly alkaline, around pH 7.4. But if the saline solution is neutral, perhaps it's intended to have a pH of 7. But at body temperature, the pure water would have a pH lower than 7 because K_w is higher. So, the neutral solution would have a pH equal to what pure water does at that temperature, which is about 6.8, as I calculated.

Wait, but maybe the term "neutral" here refers to the solution being neither acidic nor basic, which in terms of pH would be 7. But that's at 25°C. At higher temperatures, the neutral point shifts. So, perhaps the saline solution is made to have a pH of 7 at body temperature, which would actually be acidic in terms of the pure water pH at that temperature. But that seems contradictory.

Alternatively, maybe the saline solution's pH is adjusted to 7 at body temperature, but that might not be possible because the K_w is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the saline solution is made to have equal concentrations of H+ and OH- ions based on the K_w at body temperature, which would make it pH 6.8. So, the correct answer would be 6.8, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: when they say the saline solution is neutral, perhaps it's intended to have a pH of 7. So, what would be the [H+] if the pH is 7 at 37°C? Let's see: [H+] = 1e-7 M. Then [OH-] would be K_w / [H+] = 2.42e-14 / 1e-7 = 2.42e-7 M. But then [OH-] is higher than [H+], which would make the solution basic, because pH would be higher than the neutral point at that temperature.

Wait, but if the solution is neutral, then [H+] must equal [OH-], which would only happen when pH equals pOH, which is when pH is equal to half the pKw. Wait, pKw is the negative log of K_w. So pKw = -log(2.42e-14). Let me compute that.

Log(2.42e-14) = log(2.42) + log(1e-14) = 0.3856 -14 = -13.6144. So pKw = 13.6144. Since pH + pOH = pKw, and for neutral solution, pH = pOH, so pH = pKw / 2 = 13.6144 /2 ≈ 6.807. So the pH would be approximately 6.8, which is option A.

So, the correct answer is A: 6.8.

At normal body temperature (37°C), the ionization constant of water, \( K_w \), is \( 2.42 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{mol}^2/\text{L}^2 \). For a neutral solution, the concentrations of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) ions are equal, meaning \( [\text{H}^+] = [\text{OH}^-] \). Using the relationship \( [\text{H}^+][\text{OH}^-] = K_w \), we find that \( [\text{H}^+] = \sqrt{K_w} \).

Calculating \( [\text{H}^+] \):
\[
[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt{2.42 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 1.555 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH is then calculated as:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log(1.555 \times 10^{-7}) \approx 6.8.
\]

Thus, the pH of the neutral saline solution at body temperature is approximately 6.8.
