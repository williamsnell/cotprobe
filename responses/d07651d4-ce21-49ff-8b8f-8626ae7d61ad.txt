Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic and reversible expansion. Hmm, I remember that adiabatic means no heat exchange with the surroundings, so Q=0. And reversible implies it's a quasi-static process, so it follows the equations of thermodynamics perfectly.

The problem states that one mole of an ideal gas at 300 K is expanded adiabatically and reversibly from 20 atm to 1 atm. I'm supposed to find the final temperature, and they've given the molar heat capacity at constant volume, Cv, as (3/2)R. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct letter.

Alright, let's start by recalling the formula for an adiabatic process. I think the key equation here is the relation between temperature and pressure during an adiabatic expansion. The formula is T1 * P1^(γ-1) = T2 * P2^(γ-1), where γ is the heat capacity ratio, Cp/Cv. Or wait, another version I remember is TV^γ-1 = constant, but since pressure is changing here, maybe the pressure form is more applicable.

Wait, actually, the correct relation for adiabatic processes is T1^(γ) * P1^(1-γ) = T2^(γ) * P2^(1-γ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between temperature and volume. Oh, wait, another approach: for an adiabatic process, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy, since Q=0. So, W = ΔU.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the relation involving the temperatures and pressures. I think the formula is T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2)^((γ-1)/γ). Let me make sure. Yeah, I think that's right. So the ratio of the temperatures is equal to the ratio of the pressures raised to the power of (γ-1)/γ.

So first, I need to find γ. Since Cv is given as (3/2)R, and γ is Cp/Cv. Cp is Cv + R, right? Because Cp = Cv + nR for one mole, but since we're dealing with per mole, it's Cv + R. So, Cp = (3/2)R + R = (5/2)R. So γ = Cp/Cv = (5/2 R)/(3/2 R) = 5/3.

So γ is 5/3. Now, the initial pressure P1 is 20 atm, and the final pressure P2 is 1 atm. The initial temperature T1 is 300 K. I need to find T2.

Plugging into the formula: T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^((γ-1)/γ). Let me compute (γ-1)/γ. γ is 5/3, so γ-1 is 2/3. So (γ-1)/γ = (2/3)/(5/3) )= 2/5. So the exponent is 2/5.

So T2 = 300 K * (1/20)^(2/5). Let me calculate (1/20)^(2/5). Hmm, 20 is 2^2 *5, but perhaps I can compute this using logarithms or exponents.

Alternatively, I can write 1/20 as 0.05, and then take that to the power of 0.4. Alternatively, since 20 is 2^2 *5, but maybe it's easier to compute the exponent as (2/5) = 0.4.

So 0.05^0.4. Let's compute that. 0.05 is 5e-2. Let me take natural logs. ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957. Multiply by 0.4: -2.9957 * 0.4 ≈ -1.1983. Then exponentiate: e^(-1.1983) ≈ 0.302.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.05^0.4 is the same as (0.05)^(2/5) = [ (0.05)^(1/5) ]^2. Let me compute 0.05^(1/5).

Let me approximate: 0.05 is 5 * 10^-2. The fifth root of 0.05. Let me see, 0.05 is 5e-2. Let's find x such that x^5 = 0.05. Trying 0.5: 0.5^5=0.03125, which is less than 0.05. 0.57^5: Let's compute 0.57^2=0.3249; then 0.3249^2 ≈ 0.1056; so 0.57^5 ≈ 0.1056 * 0.57 ≈ 0.060, which is a bit higher than 0.05. So the fifth root of 0.05 is approximately 0.565 or so. So then, 0.565 squared would be roughly (0.565)^2 ≈ 0.319. So about 0.32.

So T2 ≈ 300 K * 0.32 ≈ 96 K. Wait, but let me check if I did the exponent correctly.

Wait, the formula is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ). So, (γ-1)/γ is (2/3)/(5/3) )= 2/5, which is 0.4. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but I'm getting T2 ≈ 300 * (1/20)^(2/5) ≈ 300 * (0.05)^(0.4) ≈ 300 * 0.319 ≈ 95.7 K. Looking at the options, the closest is F:90.5 K or C:75 K. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

Compute (1/20) = 0.05. Take ln(0.05) = -2.9957. Multiply by (2/5): -2.9957 * (2/5) = -1.1983. Then exponentiate: e^(-1.1983) ≈ e^-1.2 ≈ 0.3012.

So T2 = 300 * 0.3012 ≈ 90.36 K. So approximately 90.4 K. Looking at the options, F is 90.5 K. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me check if I used the correct formula. Another approach: For an adiabatic process, the relation between temperature and pressure is T1^(γ) * P1^(1-γ) = T2^(γ) * P2^(1-γ). Alternatively, T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ). So that's correct.

Alternatively, using the formula for an adiabatic process in terms of volume, but since pressure is given, the above approach is correct.

So, the calculation comes out to approximately 90.5 K, which is option F.

The problem involves an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic and reversible expansion. For adiabatic processes, the relationship between temperature and pressure is given by:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} \). Given \( C_v = \frac{3}{2}R \), we calculate \( C_p = C_v + R = \frac{5}{2}R \), so \( \gamma = \frac{5}{3} \).

The initial temperature \( T_1 \) is 300 K, initial pressure \( P_1 = 20 \, \text{atm} \), and final pressure \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

\[
T_2 = 300 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}} \approx 0.3012 \), we find:

\[
T_2 \approx 300 \cdot 0.3012 \approx 90.36 \, \text{K}
\]

This corresponds to option F: 90.5 K.
