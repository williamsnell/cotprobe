Okay, so I need to figure out the diameter of the exit pupil in this optics problem. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that the exit pupil size is related to the entrance pupil and the magnification of the system. 

The setup is a circular aperture (entrance pupil) with a diameter of 1 cm. It's placed halfway between an extended light source and a lens. The lens has a focal length of 10 cm, and it projects an image of the light source onto a screen 14 cm away from the lens. Wait, so the image is formed 14 cm from the lens. 

First, I should probably sketch the scenario. The light source is on one side, the entrance pupil (aperture) is in the middle, and then the lens, then the screen where the image is projected. But wait, the problem says the aperture is halfway between the source and the lens. So the distance from the source to the aperture is equal to the distance from the aperture to the lens. Let me denote the distance from source to aperture as 'd'. So the distance from aperture to lens is also 'd', making the total distance from source to lens as 2d. 

But wait, the lens is projecting the image onto a screen 14 cm from the lens. So the image distance (v) is 14 cm. The focal length (f) of the lens is 10 cm. I can use the lens formula to find the object distance (u) of the light source relative to the lens.

The lens formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Plugging in the values, 1/10 = 1/u + 1/14. Let me rearrange this. 1/u = 1/10 - 1/14. To subtract these fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which is 70. So 1/10 is 7/70 and 1/14 is 5/70. Subtracting them gives (7-5)/70 = 2/70 = 1/35. So 1/u = 1/35, which means u = 35 cm. 

Wait, but u is the object distance from the lens. So the light source is 35 cm away from the lens. Now, the aperture is placed halfway between the source and the lens. So the distance from the source to the aperture (d) plus the distance from the aperture to the lens (d) should equal the total distance from source to lens, which is 35 cm. So 2d = 35 cm → d = 17.5 cm. 

So the entrance pupil is 17.5 cm from the source and 17.5 cm from the lens. But wait, the image is formed 14 cm on the other side of the lens, so the total distance from the source to the image is 35 +14 = 49 cm. 

Now, the exit pupil size relates to the entrance pupil and the magnification. The exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil, so its size depends on the magnification of the system. The magnification (M) can be found using the lens formula for linear magnification: M = v/u. Wait, no, actually, M is given by -v/u. Let me confirm: yes, the magnification formula is M = image height / object height = (v/u) * (-1), but when considering the size, the sign doesn't matter for the size, just the ratio. So |M| = v/u. 

Wait, earlier I found u =35 cm and v=14 cm. So |M|=14/35 = 0.4. So the magnification is 0.4 times. 

But wait, since the exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil, the diameter of the exit pupil (D_exit) should be equal to the entrance pupil diameter (D_entrance) multiplied by the magnification. So D_exit = D_entrance * |M|. 

So D_entrance is 1 cm. So D_exit = 1 cm * 0.4 = 0.4 cm. Wait, but none of the options are 0.4 cm. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up something. Let me think again. The magnification M is given by the ratio of image distance to object distance, so M = v/u. But in terms of linear dimensions (like magnification of the entrance pupil), it's |M|=v/u. So in this case, v=14 cm and u=35 cm, so M=14/35=0.4. 

So the exit pupil diameter should be 1 cm multiplied by 0.4, which is 0.4 cm. But wait, the options don't have 0.4. Let me check the options again.

The options are: A:2, B:0.66, C:2.5, D:0.5, E:1.25, F:0.8, G:1.33, H:1.5, I:1, J:1.77.

Hmm, 0.4 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I got the magnification wrong. Because the image is real and inverted, but the magnification's absolute value is what's important for the exit pupil size. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the position of the aperture relative to the lens and how it affects the exit pupil.

Another approach: The exit pupil is the image formed by the lens of the entrance pupil. So the diameter of the exit pupil is equal to the diameter of the entrance pupil multiplied by the magnification of the system.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing the object and image positions. Let me think: the entrance pupil is the object for the lens, and the exit pupil is its image. So the magnification would be (image distance)/(object distance) = v/u =14/35=0.4. So the exit pupil's diameter would be 1 cm *0.4=0.4 cm. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the exit pupil's size is determined by the ratio of the image distance to the focal length. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the aperture stop and how it affects the exit pupil.

Wait, the entrance pupil is the aperture here, and the exit pupil is the image of the aperture formed by the lens. So the size of the exit pupil depends on the magnification of the lens when the aperture is the object.

So, the lens is imaging the entrance pupil (which is at a distance u from the lens) to form the exit pupil at a distance v from the lens. Wait, no. Actually, the lens forms the image of the object (the light source) but the exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil. So the entrance pupil is at a certain position relative to the lens, and its image is the exit pupil.

Wait, the entrance pupil is located a distance d from the lens, where d is 17.5 cm because it's halfway between the source (35 cm from the lens) and the lens. Wait no, earlier I thought the total distance from source to lens is 35 cm, but that was based on u=35. Let me double-check that.

Wait, earlier calculation: Using 1/f = 1/u +1/v, with f=10 cm, v=14 cm.

So 1/10 = 1/u +1/14 → 1/u = 1/10 -1/14 = (7-5)/70 = 2/70 =1/35 → u=35 cm. So the object is 35 cm from the lens. So the source is 35 cm in front of the lens, and the image is 14 cm behind the lens, making the total distance from source to image 35+14=49 cm.

Now, the entrance pupil is halfway between the source and the lens. So the source is 35 cm from the lens. So the distance from source to entrance pupil is 35/2 =17.5 cm, and from entrance pupil to lens is also 17.5 cm. So the entrance pupil is 17.5 cm in front of the lens.

Wait, so the entrance pupil is at a distance u_entrance =17.5 cm from the lens. Now, when the lens images the entrance pupil, the image (exit pupil) is formed at a distance v_entrance from the lens. Using the lens formula again:

1/f =1/u_entrance +1/v_entrance → 1/10 =1/17.5 + 1/v_entrance.

Let me compute 1/17.5 = approx 0.05714. So 1/10 is 0.1, so 1/v_entrance =0.1 -0.05714=0.04286 → v_entrance ≈1/0.04286≈23.333 cm. So the exit pupil is 23.333 cm from the lens on the image side.

Now, the magnification M_entrance is v_entrance / u_entrance = (23.333)/17.5 ≈1.3333. So the magnification is approximately 1.333 times.

So the diameter of the exit pupil is D_entrance * M_entrance =1 cm *1.333≈1.333 cm. Looking at the options, option G is 1.33 cm, which matches this.

Wait, but earlier I thought M was 0.4, but that was for the image of the source. But here, for the entrance pupil, which is at 17.5 cm from the lens, the magnification is 1.333, so the exit pupil is larger than the entrance pupil. That makes sense if the image is being magnified. 

So the correct answer should be G:1.33 cm.
</think>

The problem involves determining the diameter of the exit pupil in an optical system. The entrance pupil has a diameter of 1 cm and is placed halfway between an extended light source and a lens with a focal length of 10 cm. The lens projects an image of the source onto a screen 14 cm from the lens. 

Using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \), where \( f = 10 \, \text{cm} \) and \( v = 14 \, \text{cm} \), the object distance \( u \) is calculated as \( u = 35 \, \text{cm} \). Since the entrance pupil is halfway between the source and the lens, it is located \( 17.5 \, \text{cm} \) from the lens.

The exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil formed by the lens. Using the lens formula again for the entrance pupil at \( u_{\text{entrance}} = 17.5 \, \text{cm} \), the image distance \( v_{\text{entrance}} \) is found to be approximately \( 23.33 \, \text{cm} \). The magnification of the entrance pupil is then \( M_{\text{entrance}} = \frac{v_{\text{entrance}}}{u_{\text{entrance}}} \approx 1.333 \).

The diameter of the exit pupil is the product of the entrance pupil diameter and the magnification:  
\[
D_{\text{exit}} = D_{\text{entrance}} \times M_{\text{entrance}} = 1 \, \text{cm} \times 1.333 \approx 1.33 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the diameter of the exit pupil is **1.33 cm**, corresponding to option G.
