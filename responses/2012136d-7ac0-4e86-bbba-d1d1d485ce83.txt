Okay, so I've got this question about finding the capacitance of a single isolated conducting sphere with radius a. Hmm, I remember that capacitance is related to how much charge a capacitor can hold at a certain voltage. But wait, a single sphere is a bit different from the usual two plates or something like that. Let me think.

I recall that for a conducting sphere, the electric field outside the sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, the electric field E at a distance r from the center would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q / r²), right? Because for a point charge, that's the formula.

Now, the potential V at the surface of the sphere (r = a) would be the integral of E dr from 0 to a. Wait, no, because the potential is measured relative to infinity. So actually, V = integral from a to infinity of E dr. So V = integral (from a to ∞) of (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q / r²) dr.

Calculating that integral: the integral of 1/r² dr is -1/r. So evaluating from a to infinity, it becomes (1/(4πε₀)) * Q [0 - (-1/a)] = (1/(4πε₀)) * Q * (1/a) = Q/(4πε₀ a).

So the potential V is Q/(4πε₀ a). But capacitance C is defined as C = Q/V. So substituting V, C = Q / (Q/(4πε₀ a)) ) = 4πε₀ a. Oh wait, that gives C = 4πε₀ a.

Looking at the options, option I is C = 4πε₀ a. So the answer should be I.

The capacitance of a single isolated conducting sphere is given by the formula \( C = 4\pi \varepsilon_0 a \), where \( a \) is the radius of the sphere. This matches option I.
