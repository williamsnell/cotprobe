Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about defining emotion. The question asks to define emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again: "Define emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation." So, the correct answer should include all three aspects: feelings (the internal experience), responses (the external or behavioral reactions), and motivation (the drive or reason behind actions).

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Emotion is a state of anger. Well, anger is just one emotion, and it doesn't cover feelings, responses, and motivation comprehensively. So probably not A.

Option B: Emotion is a behavioral display intended to influence others, without internal feelings or motivations. Wait, this says without internal feelings or motivations, which contradicts the question. The question specifies that emotion should be defined in terms of feelings and motivation, so B is likely incorrect.

Option C: Emotion is the conscious experience of affect, limited to situations of pleasure or pain. This mentions feelings (affects) but limits it to pleasure or pain, and it doesn't talk about responses or motivation. So probably not C.

Option D: Emotion is a state of happiness. Again, happiness is just one emotion, and it doesn't cover the other aspects mentioned in the question. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Emotion is a complex state characterized by heightened arousal level, defined in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. This seems promising. It mentions feelings, responses, and motivation, and it's a complex state with heightened arousal. That fits the question well.

Option F: Emotion is an involuntary physical reaction to external events, unrelated to personal feelings or motivation. This excludes feelings and motivation, which are part of the question, so F isn't right.

Option G: Emotion is a long-lasting mood state that does not necessarily have a triggering event or clear external cause. Emotions are usually transient, while moods can be longer-lasting. The question is about emotion, so G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Emotion is the physiological response to cognitive judgments about social and environmental stimuli. This focuses on the physiological and cognitive aspects but doesn't mention feelings or motivation in the way the question requires. So H might not be the best fit.

Option I: Emotion is a transient social construct that varies widely across cultures and situations. While emotions can vary culturally, this option doesn't address feelings, responses, or motivation directly, so it's probably not the right choice.

Option J: Emotion is a state of sadness. Similar to A and D, this is just one emotion and doesn't cover the broader aspects asked in the question.

So, reviewing the options, Option E seems to be the only one that includes feelings, responses, and motivation, and describes it as a complex state with heightened arousal. That aligns best with the question's requirements.

The correct answer is E because it captures all three aspects: feelings, responses, and motivation, describing emotion as a complex state with heightened arousal.

Answer: E
