Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrolytic cells and figuring out how much of each metal gets deposited at the cathode. Hmm, electrolysis, right? I remember that when you pass an electric current through an electrolytic solution, you can deposit metals based on their standard reduction potentials. The cathode is where reduction happens, so the metal ions will be reduced and deposited there.

The problem says we're passing a 1.0 amp current for 1.0 hour. I think the key formula here is Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Faraday's constant is 96,500 coulombs per mole of electrons. Oh right, and the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the amount of charge passed.

So, first, I need to calculate the total charge. Current is in amperes, which is coulombs per second. So 1.0 amp for 1 hour is 1.0 * 3600 seconds = 3600 coulombs. That's the total charge, Q.

Now, each metal has a different valence, which affects how much gets deposited. For each metal, I'll need to find out how many moles are deposited, then convert that to grams.

Starting with silver (Ag). The ion is Ag+ with a charge of +1. So each Ag+ ion gains 1 electron. The reaction is Ag+ + e- → Ag. The moles of electrons would be the same as moles of Ag deposited.

Moles of electrons = Q / Faraday's constant. So 3600 C / 96500 C/mol ≈ 0.0373 moles of electrons. Since each Ag+ gives one electron, moles of Ag = 0.0373. The molar mass of Ag is about 107.9 g/mol. So mass = moles * molar mass = 0.0373 * 107.9 ≈ 4.02 grams. Wait, that seems high—wait, let me double-check the math. Oh wait, 3600 divided by 96500 is approximately 0.0373 mol e-. So Ag would be 0.0373 moles, 107.9 * 0.0373 ≈ 4.02 grams. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 4.02g for Ag in all options, but let's check.

Wait, looking at the options, option H has 4.02g Ag, 1.19g Cu, 0.335 Al. But let's continue with the others.

Next is copper (Cu) from Cu²+ solution. The reaction is Cu²+ + 2e- → Cu. So each Cu²+ requires 2 electrons. So moles of Cu²+ = moles of e- / 2. Moles of e- is 0.0373, so moles of Cu = 0.0373 / 2 ≈ 0.01865 mol. Molar mass of Cu is about 63.55 g/mol. So mass = 0.01865 * 63.55 ≈ 1.19 grams. So that matches option H's Cu value.

Now aluminum (Al) from Al³+ solution. The reaction is Al³+ + 3e- → Al. Each Al³+ requires 3 electrons. Moles of Al³+ = moles of e- / 3 = 0.0373 / 3 ≈ 0.01243 mol. Molar mass of Al is about 27 g/mol. So mass is 0.01243 * 27 ≈ 0.335 grams. That also matches option H's Al value.

Looking back at the options, option H is (4.02g Ag, 1.19g Cu, 0.335g Al). So that's the correct choice.

To determine the mass of each metal deposited at the cathode during electrolysis, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The total charge passed is calculated as:

\[
Q = I \times t = 1.0 \, \text{A} \times 3600 \, \text{s} = 3600 \, \text{C}.
\]

Using Faraday's constant (\(F = 96,500 \, \text{C/mol}\)), the number of moles of electrons is:

\[
\text{Moles of electrons} = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{3600}{96500} \approx 0.0373 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### 1. **Silver (Ag) from \( \text{Ag}^+ \) solution**
The reaction is \( \text{Ag}^+ + e^- \to \text{Ag} \). Each \( \text{Ag}^+ \) ion requires 1 electron. Thus, moles of Ag deposited are:

\[
\text{Moles of Ag} = 0.0373 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molar mass of Ag is \( 107.9 \, \text{g/mol} \). Therefore, the mass of Ag deposited is:

\[
\text{Mass of Ag} = 0.0373 \times 107.9 \approx 4.02 \, \text{g}.
\]

### 2. **Copper (Cu) from \( \text{Cu}^{2+} \) solution**
The reaction is \( \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \to \text{Cu} \). Each \( \text{Cu}^{2+} \) ion requires 2 electrons. Thus, moles of Cu deposited are:

\[
\text{Moles of Cu} = \frac{0.0373}{2} \approx 0.01865 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molar mass of Cu is \( 63.55 \, \text{g/mol} \). Therefore, the mass of Cu deposited is:

\[
\text{Mass of Cu} = 0.01865 \times 63.55 \approx 1.19 \, \text{g}.
\]

### 3. **Aluminum (Al) from \( \text{Al}^{3+} \) solution**
The reaction is \( \text{Al}^{3+} + 3e^- \to \text{Al} \). Each \( \text{Al}^{3+} \) ion requires 3 electrons. Thus, moles of Al deposited are:

\[
\text{Moles of Al} = \frac{0.0373}{3} \approx 0.01243 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molar mass of Al is \( 27 \, \text{g/mol} \). Therefore, the mass of Al deposited is:

\[
\text{Mass of Al} = 0.01243 \times 27 \approx 0.335 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated masses are \( 4.02 \, \text{g} \) of Ag, \( 1.19 \, \text{g} \) of Cu, and \( 0.335 \, \text{g} \) of Al. Comparing these values with the options, the correct choice is:

**H: 4.02g of Ag, 1.19g of Cu, 0.335g of Al**
