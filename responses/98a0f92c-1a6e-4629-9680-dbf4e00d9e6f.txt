Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the diameter of a helium molecule using the van der Waals constant b. The given value of b is 23.4 cm³·mol⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that the van der Waals equation has two constants, a and b. The constant b is related to the volume excluded by the molecules, which depends on their size.

Wait, right, the constant b is actually proportional to the volume of a single molecule. But since it's per mole, I think I need to find the volume occupied by a single molecule and then relate that to the diameter.

So, I recall that the molar volume excluded by the molecules is given by b = n * (4/3)πr³, where n is Avogadro's number and r is the radius of the molecule. Wait, but wait, more accurately, the van der Waals equation uses the volume term as the volume that a single particle would occupy, considering the size, so maybe it's (4/3)π(d/2)³ multiplied by Avogadro's number, since d is the diameter.

Let me think again. The van der Waals constant b is equal to the volume excluded per mole of gas. So, for one mole, the excluded volume is the volume that each molecule occupies, multiplied by Avogadro's number. So, b = N_A * (4/3)π(r)^3. But since diameter d is twice the radius, r = d/2. So substituting, b = N_A * (4/3)π*(d/2)^3.

Let me write that formula down:

b = N_A * (4/3)π*(d/2)^3.

I can rearrange this to solve for d.

First, let's compute each part step by step.

Given:
b = 23.4 cm³/mol
N_A = Avogadro's number = 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹
π ≈ 3.1416

So, let's rearrange for d:

d = 2 * [ (3b / (4π N_A)) ]^(1/3)

Plugging in the numbers:

First, calculate 3b: 3 * 23.4 cm³/mol = 70.2 cm³/mol.

Then, divide by (4π N_A):

4 * π ≈ 12.5664

So denominator is 12.5664 * 6.022e23 ≈ 7.56e24 cm³/mol.

Wait, wait, let me compute that:

4 * π ≈ 12.5664.

So 4π * N_A = 12.5664 * 6.022e23 ≈ 7.56e24 cm³/mol.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 4π N_A is 12.5664 * 6.022e23. Let me compute that: 12.5664 * 6.022e23 ≈ 75.6e23, which is 7.56e24 cm³/mol.

Wait, but the units: b is in cm³/mol, so 3b/(4π N_A) would be (cm³/mol) divided by (cm³/mol) because N_A is per mole. Wait, actually, N_A is per mole, so when we multiply by N_A, the units are cm³ per molecule? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with units, but let's proceed numerically.

So, 3b/(4π N_A) = 70.2 cm³/mol / (7.56e24 cm³/mol) → Wait, no, because 4π N_A is 7.56e24 cm³/mol? Wait, no, wait: 4π N_A is 4 * 3.1416 * 6.022e23 ≈ 75.6e23, which is 7.56e24? Wait, 4*3.1416 is about 12.5664. 12.5664 * 6.022e23 = let's compute:

6.022e23 * 12.5664 ≈ 6.022 *12.5664 = approximately 75.6 (since 6 *12 is 72, 0.022*12 is 0.264, and 6*0.5664 is about 3.398, etc. Let me do it properly: 6.022 ×12.5664 ≈ 75.6). So 75.6e23 → 7.56e24? No, 75.6e23 is 7.56e24? Wait, 75.6e23 is 7.56e24? No, because 75.6e23 is 7.56e24? Wait, 1e24 is 10^24, so 75.6e23 is 7.56e24? No, 75.6e23 is 7.56e24? Wait, 75.6e23 is 75.6 multiplied by 1e23, which is 7.56e24? No, 75.6e23 is 7.56e24? Yes, because 75.6e23 = 7.56 * 10^24. Because 75.6 = 7.56 *10, so 7.56 *10 *1e23 = 7.56e24.

So, 3b/(4π N_A) = (70.2 cm³/mol) / (7.56e24 cm³/mol) → The moles cancel out, so units are cm³/cm³? No, wait, no, because 4π N_A is in cm³ per molecule? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently: the units for b are cm³ per mole. So when we compute 3b/(4π N_A), it's (cm³/mol) / (number per mole), since N_A is per mole. So (cm³/mol) divided by (1/mol) is cm³. Wait, no, because 4π N_A is in units of (cm³ per molecule) per mole? Hmm, maybe it's better to compute numerically.

So 3b = 70.2 cm³/mol.

4π N_A = 7.56e24 cm³/mol? Wait, no, 4π N_A would be in cm³ per molecule? Wait, no, N_A is per mole, so 4π N_A would be 4π * Avogadro's number, which is just a number, so 4π N_A is a unitless number? No, wait, no, I think I'm mixing units. Let me think: The excluded volume per molecule is (4/3)π r³, where r is in cm. So per mole, it's N_A * (4/3)π r³ = b.

So,

b = N_A * (4/3) π (d/2)^3

So, solving for d:

d = 2 * [ (3b)/(4 π N_A) ]^(1/3)

So, let's compute the value inside the cube root.

Compute numerator: 3b = 3 * 23.4 = 70.2 cm³/mol.

Denominator: 4 π N_A = 4 * 3.1416 * 6.022e23 ≈ 75.6e23 ≈ 7.56e24.

So,

(3b)/(4 π N_A) = 70.2 / 7.56e24 = approximately 9.28e-24 cm³.

Wait, 70.2 ÷ 7.56e24 ≈ 70.2 / 7.56 ≈ 9.28 → 9.28e-24 cm³.

Wait, no, because 70.2 is in cm³/mol, and 7.56e24 is 7.56e24 cm³/mol? Wait, no, wait, 4π N_A is 7.56e24, but units are cm³ per molecule? No, because (4/3)π r³ is in cm³ per molecule. Then, when multiplied by N_A (mol⁻¹), it's cm³/mol.

So, when I compute 3b/(4 π N_A), the units are (cm³/mol) / (cm³/mol) → unitless? Wait, that can't be right because we're taking the cube root to get length. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units earlier. Let me double-check.

The van der Waals equation for b is given by:

b = N_A * (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

So, solving for (d/2)^3 = (3 b) / (4 π N_A).

So, (d/2)^3 = (3 * 23.4 cm³/mol) / (4 * π * 6.022e23 mol⁻¹).

Wait, 4 π N_A is 4*3.1416*6.022e23 ≈ 75.6e23 = 7.56e24.

So, (3b) = 70.2 cm³/mol.

So,

(3b)/(4 π N_A) = (70.2 cm³/mol) / (7.56e24 cm³/mol) → cm³/mol divided by cm³/mol gives 1/mol²? That can't be right. I must have messed up the units.

Wait, perhaps I should treat N_A as a count, so in terms of per molecule. So, N_A is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So, 4π N_A is (4π * 6.022e23) molecules, but that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the volume per molecule as (b / N_A) = (23.4 cm³/mol) / (6.022e23 mol⁻¹) → which gives the volume per molecule in cm³.

So,

volume per molecule = b / N_A = 23.4 / 6.022e23 ≈ 3.885e-23 cm³.

But wait, the volume per molecule is (4/3)π (d/2)^3.

So,

(4/3)π (d/2)^3 = 3.885e-23 cm³.

So,

(d/2)^3 = (3.885e-23) * 3 / (4 π).

Compute that:

3/(4π) ≈ 0.2387.

So,

(d/2)^3 = 3.885e-23 * 0.2387 ≈ 9.236e-24 cm³.

Take cube root:

d/2 = (9.236e-24)^(1/3).

Compute cube root of 9.236e-24.

First, cube root of 9.236 is about 2.098.

Cube root of 1e-24 is 1e-8, since (1e-8)^3 = 1e-24.

So,

d/2 ≈ 2.098e-8 cm.

So, d ≈ 2 * 2.098e-8 cm = 4.196e-8 cm.

Convert cm to angstroms: 1 cm = 1e8 Å, so 4.196e-8 cm = 4.196e-8 * 1e8 Å = 4.196 Å.

Wait, that's approximately 4.2 Å. Looking at the options, option C is 4.12 Å, and option A is 5.78 Å. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

After finding (d/2)^3 = 9.236e-24 cm³.

Cube root of 9.236e-24:

9.236e-24 = 9.236 × 10^-24.

Cube root of 9.236 is approximately 2.1 (since 2^3=8, 2.1^3≈9.26), and cube root of 10^-24 is 10^-8.

So,

d/2 ≈ 2.1e-8 cm → d ≈ 4.2e-8 cm.

Convert to Å: 4.2e-8 cm * 1e8 Å/cm = 4.2 Å.

But looking at the options, the closest is C:4.12 Å.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me redo the calculation more precisely.

Compute (3b)/(4 π N_A):

3b = 3 * 23.4 = 70.2 cm³/mol.

4 π N_A = 4 * 3.1416 * 6.022e23 ≈ 12.5664 * 6.022e23 ≈ 75.6e23 → 7.56e24.

So,

(3b)/(4 π N_A) = 70.2 / 7.56e24 = 70.2 / 7.56 = approximately 9.28e-24 cm³.

So,

(d/2)^3 = 9.28e-24 cm³.

Take cube root:

d/2 = (9.28e-24)^(1/3) → Let's compute this more accurately.

First, compute cube root of 9.28e-24.

We can write 9.28e-24 as 9.28 × 10^-24.

Cube root of 9.28 ≈ 2.1 (since 2.1^3 ≈ 9.261).

Cube root of 10^-24 is (10^-8)^3 → cube root is 10^-8.

So,

d/2 ≈ 2.1e-8 cm → d ≈ 4.2e-8 cm.

Convert to angstroms: 4.2e-8 cm = 4.2e-8 * 1e8 Å = 4.2 Å.

Wait, but that's 4.2 Å, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest is option C:4.12 Å. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for Avogadro's number and π.

Let me try that.

Compute 4π N_A more accurately:

π ≈ 3.14159265.

4π = 12.566370614.

N_A = 6.02214076e23.

So,

4π N_A = 12.566370614 * 6.02214076e23 = let's compute this.

12.566370614 * 6 = 75.398223684.

12.566370614 * 0.02214076 = let's compute.

0.02214076 * 12.566370614 ≈ 0.2782.

So total is approximately 75.3982 + 0.2782 ≈ 75.6764e23.

So 4π N_A ≈ 7.56764e24 cm³/mol? Wait, no, because 75.6764e23 is 7.56764e24? Wait, 75.6764e23 is 7.56764e24? No, 75.6764e23 is 7.56764 × 1e24, so yes.

So,

(3b)/(4π N_A) = 70.2 / 7.56764e24 ≈ 70.2 / 7.56764 = let's compute 70.2 ÷ 7.56764.

70.2 ÷ 7.56764 ≈ 9.273 → so 9.273e-24 cm³.

Now,

(d/2)^3 = 9.273e-24 cm³.

Take the cube root:

d/2 = (9.273e-24)^(1/3).

Compute this:

9.273e-24 = 9.273 × 1e-24.

Cube root of 9.273 is approximately 2.1 (since 2.1^3 = 9.261).

Cube root of 1e-24 is 1e-8.

So,

d/2 ≈ 2.1e-8 cm → d ≈ 4.2e-8 cm.

Again, that's 4.2 Å. But the options don't have 4.2. Hmm. Let me check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The van der Waals constant b is the volume excluded per mole, which is the volume that the gas molecules occupy due to their size. The formula is:

b = N_A * (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

So,

(d/2)^3 = (3b) / (4 π N_A).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately with exact numbers.

Compute (3b)/(4π N_A):

3b = 70.2 cm³/mol.

4 π N_A = 4 * 3.14159265 * 6.02214076e23.

Compute 3.14159265 *4 =12.5663706.

Then, 12.5663706 * 6.02214076e23 = ?

12.5663706 *6 =75.3982236.

12.5663706 *0.02214076 = let's compute:

0.02214076 *12.5663706 ≈ 0.27826.

So total is 75.3982236 + 0.27826 ≈75.67648e23.

So, 4π N_A ≈75.67648e23 cm³/mol.

So,

(3b)/(4π N_A) =70.2 /75.67648e23 cm³/mol → wait, no, because 75.67648e23 is 7.567648e24.

So,

70.2 /7.567648e24 = (70.2 /7.567648) * 1e-24 → 70.2 ÷7.567648 ≈9.273.

So,

(3b)/(4π N_A) ≈9.273e-24 cm³.

Now,

(d/2)^3 =9.273e-24 cm³.

Take cube root:

d/2 = (9.273e-24)^(1/3).

Compute cube root of 9.273e-24:

We can write this as (9.273)^(1/3) × (1e-24)^(1/3).

Cube root of 9.273 is approximately 2.1 (since 2.1^3=9.261).

Cube root of 1e-24 is 1e-8, because (1e-8)^3=1e-24.

So,

d/2 ≈2.1e-8 cm.

Thus,

d ≈4.2e-8 cm.

Convert to angstroms:

1 cm =1e8 Å → 4.2e-8 cm =4.2e-8 *1e8 Å =4.2 Å.

But the options have C:4.12 Å and A:5.78 Å. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise cube roots.

The cube root of 9.273 is actually a bit more than 2.1.

Let me compute 2.1^3=9.261.

2.105^3: let's compute (2.1 +0.005)^3.

= 2.1^3 + 3*(2.1)^2*(0.005) + 3*(2.1)*(0.005)^2 + (0.005)^3.

=9.261 + 3*(4.41)*(0.005) + 3*(2.1)*(0.000025) + 0.000000125.

=9.261 + 0.06615 + 0.0001575 + 0.000000125 ≈9.3273.

Wait, that's higher than 9.273. So perhaps 2.1^3=9.261, which is less than 9.273. Let's try 2.1 + a small delta.

Let me find x where x^3=9.273.

We know that 2.1^3=9.261.

The difference is 9.273-9.261=0.012.

The derivative of x^3 is 3x². At x=2.1, derivative is 3*(4.41)=13.23.

So, delta_x ≈ 0.012 /13.23 ≈0.000907.

So x≈2.1 +0.000907≈2.1009.

So,

d/2≈2.1009e-8 cm → d≈4.2018e-8 cm=4.2018 Å.

Hmm, that's about 4.20 Å. But the options have C:4.12 Å.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Another thought: sometimes, the van der Waals constant b is related to the diameter as (d/2)^3 = 3b/(8 π N_A). Wait, maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the formula.

The van der Waals equation is [P + a(n/V)^2](V - n b) = n R T.

Here, b is the volume excluded per mole, which is the volume occupied by a single molecule multiplied by Avogadro's number. So,

b = N_A * (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

Yes, that's correct. So,

d = 2 * [ 3b/(4 π N_A) ]^(1/3).

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate using liters instead of cm³, but that shouldn't matter because units would cancel out as long as consistent.

Wait, maybe I should convert cm³ to m³ or something else, but let me try that.

Wait, 1 cm³ = 1e-6 liters, but perhaps that's complicating. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I should be using (d/2)^3 = (3b)/(8 π N_A), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again: the volume per molecule is (4/3)π (d/2)^3.

So, per mole, it's N_A * (4/3) π (d/2)^3 = b.

So,

(4/3) π (d/2)^3 = b / N_A.

So,

(d/2)^3 = (3 b) / (4 π N_A).

Yes, that's correct. So,

d = 2 * [ (3b)/(4 π N_A) ]^(1/3).

So, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 4.2 Å, but the closest option is C:4.12 Å. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the cube root.

Wait, let me compute 9.273e-24 cm³ more accurately.

Taking the cube root:

Let me compute 9.273e-24.

Expressed in scientific notation, 9.273e-24 = 9.273 × 10^-24.

The cube root of 9.273 is approximately 2.1009 as before.

The cube root of 10^-24 is 10^-8, because (10^-8)^3 = 10^-24.

So,

d/2 = 2.1009e-8 cm → d = 4.2018e-8 cm =4.2018 Å.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the van der Waals constant b is in cm³·mol⁻¹, but when calculating per molecule, I should convert cm³ to m³. Wait, but that shouldn't matter because the units would cancel out in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use m instead of cm.

Wait, 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm³ = (0.01 m)^3 = 1e-6 m³.

But in this case, since we're dealing with molecular diameters in angstroms, which are 1e-10 meters, perhaps using m³ would complicate the calculations, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the volume per molecule in m³.

b =23.4 cm³/mol → 23.4e-6 m³/mol.

So,

volume per molecule = b / N_A =23.4e-6 m³/mol /6.022e23 mol⁻¹ =23.4e-6 /6.022e23 m³.

Compute that:

23.4e-6 /6.022e23 = (23.4 /6.022) * 1e-29 ≈3.885 *1e-29 ≈3.885e-29 m³.

Now,

volume per molecule = (4/3) π (d/2)^3 → (d/2)^3 = (3 volume)/(4 π).

So,

(d/2)^3 = 3 *3.885e-29 m³ / (4 π) → (3*3.885e-29)/(4 *3.1416).

Compute numerator: 3 *3.885e-29 =11.655e-29 =1.1655e-28.

Denominator:4 *3.1416≈12.5664.

So,

(d/2)^3 =1.1655e-28 /12.5664 ≈9.277e-30 m³.

Take cube root:

d/2 = (9.277e-30)^(1/3).

Cube root of 9.277e-30:

Express as 9.277 ×1e-30.

Cube root of 9.277 is approximately 2.1009.

Cube root of 1e-30 is 1e-10, since (1e-10)^3=1e-30.

So,

d/2 ≈2.1009e-10 m → d≈4.2018e-10 m.

Convert to angstroms: 1 m =1e10 Å →4.2018e-10 m =4.2018 Å.

Same result as before. So the calculation seems consistent.

But the options don't have 4.2 Å. The closest is C:4.12 Å. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Or perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but considering the options, C is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the formula uses (d)^3 instead of (d/2)^3. Wait, no, because each molecule is a sphere, so the volume per molecule is (4/3)π r³, where r is the radius, which is d/2.

Wait, perhaps the van der Waals constant b is related to the diameter differently. Let me look for another approach.

Another approach: The excluded volume is the volume that each molecule would occupy if they were hard spheres. So, for one mole, it's N_A * (4/3)π (d/2)^3 =b.

So,

b = N_A * (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

So,

(d/2)^3 = (3 b) / (4 π N_A).

Yes, that's the same formula as before.

So, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is approximately 4.2 Å, but the closest option is C:4.12 Å. Alternatively, maybe the given options have a typo, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations numerically.

Compute (3b)/(4π N_A):

3b =70.2 cm³/mol.

4π N_A =4 *3.14159265 *6.02214076e23 =75.67648e23 =7.567648e24.

So,

70.2 /7.567648e24 =70.2 /7.567648 → approximately 9.273e-24 cm³.

Cube root of 9.273e-24 cm³:

9.273e-24 cm³ =9.273e-24 (cm)^3.

Convert cm to angstroms: 1 cm =1e8 Å → 1 cm³ = (1e8 Å)^3 =1e24 Å³.

So,

9.273e-24 cm³ =9.273e-24 *1e24 Å³ =9.273 Å³.

So,

(d/2)^3 =9.273 Å³ → d/2 = cube root of 9.273 Å³.

Compute cube root of 9.273.

As before, 2.1^3=9.261, which is very close to 9.273.

So,

d/2 ≈2.1009 Å → d≈4.2018 Å.

So, 4.2018 Å. The options don't have this, but option C is 4.12 Å, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the cube root. Let me compute it more precisely.

Compute cube root of 9.273:

Let me compute 2.1009^3:

= (2.1 +0.0009)^3.

=2.1^3 +3*(2.1)^2*(0.0009) +3*(2.1)*(0.0009)^2 + (0.0009)^3.

=9.261 +3*(4.41)*(0.0009) +3*(2.1)*(0.00000081) +0.000000000729.

=9.261 +0.011889 +0.000005292 +0.000000000729.

≈9.272894.

Which is very close to 9.273. So, cube root of 9.273 is approximately 2.1009.

Thus, d≈4.2018 Å.

Given that, the closest option is C:4.12 Å. But wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given b is 23.4 cm³/mol, which has three significant figures. Our calculated d is 4.20 Å, which would be 4.2 Å with two decimal places, but perhaps the options are rounded.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but considering the closest, it's C:4.12 Å.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the cube root calculation. Let me compute 2.1009^3 again.

2.1009 *2.1009 = 4.41378.

Then, 4.41378 *2.1009 ≈ let's compute:

4 *2.1009 =8.4036.

0.41378 *2.1009 ≈0.870.

So total ≈8.4036 +0.870 =9.2736.

Which is very close to 9.273. So, the cube root is accurate.

Thus, the calculation seems correct, leading to d≈4.20 Å. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is C:4.12 Å, considering possible approximations in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. Another approach: perhaps the van der Waals equation defines b as the volume that one mole of gas molecules would occupy if they were packed closely, i.e., without intermolecular spaces. So, the volume per molecule would be b / N_A. And for a sphere, the volume is (4/3)π (d/2)^3.

So,

b / N_A = (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

Rearranged,

(d/2)^3 = (3 b) / (4 π N_A).

Which is the same as before. So, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer should be around 4.2 Å, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C:4.12 Å.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the given value of b is in cm³·mol⁻¹ or m³·mol⁻¹. Oh, the given b is 23.4 cm³·mol⁻¹, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the diameter as d = 2r, where r is the radius. So, if I calculate r first, then multiply by 2.

r = [ (3b)/(4 π N_A) ]^(1/3) * (1/2).

Wait, no, that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is d = [ (3b)/(4 π N_A) ]^(1/3).

Wait, no, because (d/2)^3 = (3b)/(4 π N_A), so d = 2 * [ (3b)/(4 π N_A) ]^(1/3).

I think I've done everything correctly, but perhaps the intended answer is C:4.12 Å, which is close to 4.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the calculation was done correctly using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is C:4.12 Å.

To estimate the diameter of a helium molecule using the van der Waals constant \( b = 23.4 \, \text{cm}^3 \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \), we use the relationship:

\[
b = N_A \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^3
\]

where \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \) is Avogadro's number, and \( d \) is the diameter of the molecule. Rearranging for \( d \):

\[
d = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{3b}{4 \pi N_A}\right)^{1/3}
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{3b}{4 \pi N_A} \)
- \( 3b = 3 \cdot 23.4 = 70.2 \, \text{cm}^3 \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \)
- \( 4 \pi N_A = 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 7.56764 \times 10^{24} \, \text{cm}^3 \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \)
- \( \frac{3b}{4 \pi N_A} = \frac{70.2}{7.56764 \times 10^{24}} \approx 9.273 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^3 \)

### Step 2: Solve for \( d \)
\[
\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^3 = 9.273 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^3
\]
\[
\frac{d}{2} = \left(9.273 \times 10^{-24}\right)^{1/3}
\]

The cube root of \( 9.273 \) is approximately \( 2.1 \), and the cube root of \( 10^{-24} \) is \( 10^{-8} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{d}{2} \approx 2.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}
\]
\[
d \approx 4.2 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The calculated diameter is approximately \( 4.2 \, \text{Å} \). Among the given options, the closest value is **C: 4.12 Å**. While the calculated value slightly exceeds this, it is reasonable to select the closest option due to potential rounding or approximations in the problem setup.
