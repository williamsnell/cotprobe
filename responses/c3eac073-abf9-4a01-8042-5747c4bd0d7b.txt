Okay, so I have this question here asking for the Laplace transform of f(t) = t, where t is greater than zero. I remember that Laplace transforms are a way to convert functions from the time domain to the complex frequency domain, which is useful for solving differential equations and analyzing systems.

I think the Laplace transform of t should be something involving s squared because I remember that the Laplace transform of e^(-at) is 1/(s+a), but that's for exponential functions. Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Oh right, the Laplace transform has some standard functions. I recall that the Laplace transform of 1 (the constant function) is 1/s. What about t? I think there's a formula for that. I think it's related to the derivative of the Laplace transform. Oh wait, the Laplace transform of t^n is n! / s^(n+1). So for n=1, it should be 1! / s², which is 1/s².

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing it with something else. Another way to think about it is using integration. The Laplace transform of f(t) is the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) * t dt. So I can compute that integral.

Let me set up the integral: ∫₀^∞ t e^(-st) dt. To solve this, I can use integration by parts. Let me let u = t, so du = dt. Then dv = e^(-st) dt, so v = -e^(-st)/s.

Applying integration by parts: uv| from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ v du. So that's [ -t e^(-st)/s ] from 0 to ∞ + ∫ e^(-st)/s dt.

Now, evaluating the first term: as t approaches infinity, e^(-st) goes to zero because s is positive (assuming we're in the region of convergence). At t=0, t is zero, so that term is zero. So the first part is zero. The remaining integral is ∫ e^(-st)/s dt from 0 to ∞. Since 1/s is a constant, it can be taken out: (1/s) ∫ e^(-st) dt from 0 to ∞. The integral of e^(-st) is -e^(-st)/s, evaluated from 0 to ∞. So that becomes (1/s) * [0 - (-1/s)] = (1/s) * (1/s) = 1/s².

So the Laplace transform of t is indeed 1/s². Looking back at the options, option E is 1/s², so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. The standard formula says L{t^n} = n! / s^{n+1} for n a non-negative integer. Here, n=1, so 1! / s² = 1/s². Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident the answer is E.

The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t \) for \( t > 0 \) can be found using the standard formula for the Laplace transform of \( t^n \), which is \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \). For \( n = 1 \), this gives \( \frac{1}{s^2} \). 

Answer: E
