Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.
—Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Peter the Great and his practices when he ruled Russia. The question is asking which of the options he continued, based on the provided passage.

First, let me read the passage again. It says that Peter the Great was in Protestant Europe where he saw new civil and political rights in constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments. But when he returned to Russia, he didn't intend to share power with his people. Instead, he was determined to transform Russia, believing that he himself must provide the direction and motive force. He would lead, using education and persuasion where possible, but also drive and flog the nation forward if needed.

So the key points here are that he didn't adopt the political structures he saw in Europe, like constitutions or parliaments. Instead, he maintained a strong, centralized power. He didn't share power, which suggests he didn't promote democratic governance or decentralize power. Also, he didn't introduce a constitution or establish a parliament, as those are more Western practices he observed but didn't bring back.

The options are A to I. Let's go through them one by one.

A: Introduction of a constitution. The passage says he didn't bring back the idea of sharing power, so probably didn't introduce a constitution. So likely not A.

B: Promoting free trade. The passage doesn't mention anything about trade policies, so I can probably eliminate B.

C: Democratic governance. Since he didn't share power and kept a tight grip, this doesn't fit. So C is out.

D: Decentralization of power. Decentralization would mean giving more power to local governments or regions, but Peter was all about centralizing control, so D is not correct.

E: Serfdom. The passage doesn't directly mention serfdom, but I know from history that serfdom was prevalent in Russia during Peter's time. However, the passage talks about his governance style, not social systems. So maybe E isn't the direct answer here, but perhaps it's a distractor.

F: Emancipation of serfs. No, he didn't do that; in fact, serfs were still in bondage during his reign. So F is wrong.

G: Abolition of monarchy. He was the tsar, so he wouldn't abolish the monarchy. G is incorrect.

H: Isolationism. The passage says he was surrounded by evidence of new rights in Europe, implying he was influenced but didn't adopt those policies. However, the question is about what he continued, and isolationism isn't mentioned as something he continued. He actually tried to westernize Russia, so H is probably not the answer.

I: Establishment of a parliament. Again, the passage says he didn't bring back parliaments or constitutions, so I is out.

Wait, but none of the options seem to fit except maybe E, but the passage doesn't mention serfdom. Hmm. Let me think again. The passage is about his governance style. He didn't introduce any of the Western institutions but instead maintained an autocratic rule. So looking at the options, the only one that fits is that he continued serfdom because he didn't change the existing social structure regarding serfs. But the passage doesn't explicitly say he continued serfdom; it's more about his governance approach.

Wait, the question is about what practice he continued. The passage doesn't say he continued serfdom, but perhaps the context is that serfdom was a pre-existing condition in Russia, and he didn't change it. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that he continued the practice of autocratic rule, but that's not one of the options. Let me look again.

The options are A to I. From the passage, he didn't do any of the Western practices, so the only remaining option is E: Serfdom, as that was a system already in place before his reign, and he didn't abolish it. Therefore, he continued the practice of serfdom.

Alternatively, thinking about the options again, perhaps the correct answer is H: Isolationism, but the passage says he was influenced by Europe, so he wasn't isolationist. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: the passage says he didn't return to Russia determined to share power, implying he kept absolute power. The only option related to governance structure that fits is that he continued the practice of autocratic rule, which isn't listed. But looking at the options, perhaps the closest is E: Serfdom, as he didn't change the social system.

But wait, the passage is about governance, not social policies. So maybe none of the options directly relate, but the most fitting would be that he continued serfdom because it was already in place and he didn't change it. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: Isolationism, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The question is: When Peter the Great ruled Russia, he continued the practice of which of the following?

Looking at the passage, he didn't introduce any Western institutions. So he continued the existing practices. The existing practice in Russia before his reign was serfdom, which he didn't abolish. Therefore, he continued serfdom, making E the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: Isolationism, but that doesn't align with his actions to westernize Russia. So I think the correct answer is E: Serfdom.
</think>

The passage describes Peter the Great as an autocratic ruler who did not adopt the Western practices he observed, such as constitutions, parliaments, or democratic governance. Instead, he maintained a centralized and autocratic approach to transforming Russia. Among the options provided, the only practice that aligns with his governance style and the historical context of Russia during his reign is the continuation of serfdom, as he did not abolish it. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: Serfdom

The last character of the response is the letter representing the answer.
