Question:

Grey's Truck Rental Service currently charges $180 per week for the use of one of their moving trucks. Presently, Ms. Grey is renting out an average of 200 trucks per week. She estimates there will be a drop in demand of 1 truck per week if she raises the rental price by $1 a truck. What is the price that will maximize revenues?

A: $210
B: $180
C: $200
D: $220
E: $205
F: $230
G: $215
H: $190
I: $195
J: $175

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Grey's Truck Rental Service. They're currently charging $180 per week for a truck, and they rent out an average of 200 trucks per week. Now, Ms. Grey is thinking about raising the price, but she's concerned that for every $1 increase, the demand will drop by 1 truck per week. The question is asking what price will maximize their revenue.

Hmm, let me break this down. Revenue is calculated as price multiplied by quantity sold, right? So, I need to find the price point where this product is maximized. Since both price and quantity are variables here, and they're inversely related, this sounds like a typical optimization problem, maybe involving some quadratic equations or calculus.

Let me denote the price increase as 'x' dollars. So, if the current price is $180, the new price would be (180 + x) dollars. But wait, the problem says that for each $1 increase, the demand drops by 1 truck. So, the number of trucks rented would be 200 minus x, because each $1 increase reduces demand by one truck.

So, the revenue R can be expressed as:
R = (Price) * (Quantity)
R = (180 + x) * (200 - x)

Now, I need to expand this equation to find the maximum. Let's do that:
R = (180)(200) + (180)(-x) + x(200) + x(-x)
R = 36,000 - 180x + 200x - x²
Simplify the terms:
R = 36,000 + 20x - x²

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the expansion. Oh, wait, 180*(-x) is -180x and x*200 is +200x. So, combining those gives +20x. So, yes, R = -x² +20x +36,000.

Now, since this is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and the coefficient of x² is negative (-1), the parabola opens downward, which means the vertex is the maximum point. The vertex of a parabola given by ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a).

In this case, a = -1 and b = 20. So, x = -20/(2*(-1)) = -20 / (-2) = 10.

So, x is 10. That means the optimal price increase is $10. Therefore, the new price would be 180 + 10 = $190.

Wait, but let me check the options provided. The options are A to J, with H being $190. So, is H the correct answer?

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expansion. Let me go through it again.

Original revenue equation: R = (180 + x)(200 - x)
Multiply it out: 180*200 = 36,000
180*(-x) = -180x
x*200 = 200x
x*(-x) = -x²
So, adding all together: 36,000 -180x +200x -x²
Which simplifies to 36,000 +20x -x². Yep, that's correct.

So, x is 10, so price is 190. So, option H.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "if she raises the rental price by $1 a truck, demand drops by 1 truck per week." So, for each $1 increase, one fewer truck is rented. So, the relationship is linear. So, the model I've used is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the revenue as a function of price and find its maximum. Let me try that approach.

Let P be the price, which is 180 + x, where x is the increase. Then, quantity Q = 200 - x. So, R = P * Q = (180 + x)(200 - x), which is the same as before.

Alternatively, I can express x in terms of P: x = P - 180. Then Q = 200 - (P - 180) = 200 - P + 180 = 380 - P. So, R = P * (380 - P) = 380P - P².

To find maximum revenue, take derivative dR/dP = 380 - 2P. Set to zero: 380 -2P =0 → P=190.

So, same result. So, the optimal price is $190, which is option H.

Wait, but let me check if the maximum makes sense. At P=190, Q=380-190=190. So, revenue is 190*190=36,100.

If I check P=180, Q=200, R=36,000. If I go to P=200, Q=180, R=36,000. So, same as before. So, the maximum is indeed at P=190, where R=36,100, which is higher than at P=180 or P=200.

So, the correct answer should be H, $190.

The problem involves maximizing revenue for Grey's Truck Rental Service. Currently, they charge $180 per week for a truck, renting out 200 trucks weekly. For each $1 increase in price, demand drops by 1 truck. To find the price that maximizes revenue, we model revenue as a function of price.

Let \( P \) be the price and \( Q \) be the quantity rented. The relationship is linear: for each $1 increase in \( P \), \( Q \) decreases by 1. Thus, \( Q = 380 - P \). Revenue \( R \) is given by:

\[
R = P \times Q = P \times (380 - P) = 380P - P^2
\]

To maximize \( R \), we take the derivative with respect to \( P \):

\[
\frac{dR}{dP} = 380 - 2P
\]

Setting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:

\[
380 - 2P = 0 \implies P = 190
\]

Thus, the price that maximizes revenue is $190. Verifying, at \( P = 190 \), \( Q = 190 \), giving a revenue of \( 190 \times 190 = 36,100 \), which is higher than at $180 or $200. Therefore, the optimal price is $190.
