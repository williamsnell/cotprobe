Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about students leaving the class in two steps, and we need to find out how many were there originally. Let me break it down step by step.

First, at the beginning of the class period, half of the students go to the library. So if there were, say, N students originally, then after the first trip, half would leave, leaving N/2 students in the class.

Then, later in the period, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab. So from the N/2 students left after the library trip, another half would leave. That means we take half of N/2, which is (N/2)/2 = N/4. So the number of students remaining in the class after both trips would be N/2 - N/4, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, after the second trip, the number remaining would be the remaining after the second half leaves. So if there were N/2 students after the first trip, and then half of those leave, the remaining would be (N/2) * (1/2) = N/4.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem says that after both trips, there are 8 students left. So according to that, N/4 = 8. So solving for N, we get N = 8 * 4 = 32. So the original number of students would be 32. Let me check the options. Option D is 32 students. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be a bit tricky.

Wait, let me model it step by step with variables. Letâ€™s say the original number is N.

1. After half go to the library: Remaining = N - (N/2) = N/2.
2. Then, half of these remaining go to the computer lab: So the number leaving is (N/2)/2 = N/4. So the remaining after the second trip is N/2 - N/4 = N/4.

Given that N/4 = 8, so N = 8 * 4 = 32. So the original number is 32, which is option D.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the original number is 32. First, 16 go to the library, leaving 16. Then, half of 16 go to the computer lab, which is 8. So 8 remain. That matches the problem statement. So yes, 32 is correct. So the answer should be D.

The problem involves two steps of students leaving the class. Let N be the original number of students.

1. After half go to the library, N/2 remain.
2. Half of these remaining students go to the computer lab, leaving N/4.

Given that N/4 = 8, solving for N gives N = 32. Thus, the original number of students is 32.

Answer: D
