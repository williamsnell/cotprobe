Question:

The village of Lynbrook has a capital budget of $125,626.79 for the current year. Through fines and issuing of licenses, the village expects to raise $4,256.30. If the total assessed valuation of the property in Lynbrook is $2,697,112, what is the town's tax rate in dollars per $1,000?

Options:

A: $65 per $1,000 of assessed valuation

C: $60 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
D: $25 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
E: $30 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
F: $45 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
G: $50 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
H: $40 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
I: $55 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
J: $70 per $1,000 of assessed valuation

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating a tax rate for the village of Lynbrook. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm not super familiar with tax calculations, but I think I can work through it.

First, the problem states that Lynbrook has a capital budget of $125,626.79 for the current year. They expect to raise $4,256.30 through fines and issuing licenses. The total assessed valuation of the property is $2,697,112. The question is asking for the town's tax rate in dollars per $1,000.

Hmm, so I think the tax rate is calculated based on how much they need to collect in taxes to meet their budget, minus the money they've already raised through fines and licenses. So, the first thing I should do is find out how much more money they need beyond what they've already got from fines and licenses.

Let me subtract the expected revenue from fines and licenses from the total capital budget to find the required tax revenue. So, that would be:

$125,626.79 (budget) minus $4,256.30 (fines/licenses) equals... let me do the math. 125,626.79 minus 4,256.30. Let me subtract 4,000 first, which would leave 121,626.79, then subtract 256.30 more, so 121,626.79 minus 256.30 is $121,370.49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Wait, 125,626.79 minus 4,256.30. Let's see, 125,626.79 minus 4,000 is 121,626.79. Then subtract 256.30: 121,626.79 minus 256.30 equals 121,370.49. So the required tax revenue is $121,370.49.

Now, the total assessed valuation is $2,697,112. The tax rate is usually calculated as (tax required) divided by (assessed valuation) multiplied by 1,000 to get the rate per $1,000. So the formula would be:

Tax Rate = (Tax Required / Assessed Valuation) * 1000

Plugging in the numbers:

Tax Rate = (121,370.49 / 2,697,112) * 1000

Let me compute that division first. 121,370.49 divided by 2,697,112. Hmm, doing this division might be a bit tricky without a calculator, but let's approximate.

Alternatively, I can think of it as roughly how many times 2,697,112 fits into 121,370.49. But that's a small number, so perhaps 121,370.49 ÷ 2,697,112 ≈ 0.045. So 0.045 times 1000 is 45. So the tax rate would be approximately $45 per $1,000.

Wait, but let me check that again. Let me try to compute 121,370.49 ÷ 2,697,112 more accurately.

I can maybe simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 1000 to make it easier. So 121,370.49 ÷ 1000 is 121.37049, and 2,697,112 ÷ 1000 is 2,697.112.

So now, 121.37049 ÷ 2,697.112 ≈ let's see. 2,697.112 is roughly 2.7 thousand. So 121.37 / 2,697.112 is roughly 0.045 (since 2,700 * 0.045 = 121.5). So that's about 0.045, which multiplied by 1000 gives 45.

So the tax rate would be approximately $45 per $1,000. Looking at the options, option F is $45 per $1,000. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my subtraction. The budget is $125,626.79, and they expect $4,256.30 from fines and licenses. So subtracting:

125,626.79
- 4,256.30
------------
= 121,370.49

Yes, that's correct. So the tax required is $121,370.49.

Then, the tax rate is 121,370.49 / 2,697,112 * 1000.

Alternatively, I can compute 121,370.49 divided by 2,697,112.

Let me try to compute this more accurately. Let's see, 2,697,112 divided by 1,000 is 2,697.112. So 121,370.49 ÷ 2,697.112.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 121,370.49 ÷ 2,697,112. Let me approximate:

2,697,112 is approximately 2.697 million.

121,370.49 is approximately 0.12137 million.

So 0.12137 / 2.697 ≈ 0.045.

0.045 times 1000 is 45, so yes, $45 per $1,000.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option F: $45 per $1,000.
</think>

The tax rate is calculated by determining the required tax revenue after accounting for fines and licenses, then dividing by the assessed valuation and converting to a per $1,000 rate. The required tax revenue is $121,370.49, and dividing this by the assessed valuation of $2,697,112 gives approximately $45 per $1,000.

Answer: F
