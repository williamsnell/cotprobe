Question:

What features enable the ferns to grow to a much largersize than the mosses?

Options:

A: Ferns grow larger because they can perform photosynthesis more efficiently than mosses
B: Ferns grow larger due to higher nutrient content
C: Ferns grow larger due to a stronger stem
D: Ferns grow larger due to their ability to move to more fertile areas
E: Mosses are limited in size by their shorter life cycle compared to ferns
F: Ferns have a symbiotic relationship with fungi that allows them to grow larger
G: Because of the presence of an elaborate root system and a vascular system, the ferns are able to grow to a much larger size than are the mosses.
H: Ferns grow larger because they have larger leaves
I: Ferns grow larger due to the presence of growth-promoting bacteria in their rhizosphere
J: Ferns grow larger because they are more resistant to pests and diseases

Okay, so I have this biology question about why ferns can grow larger than mosses. Hmm, I remember that both are plants, but they have some differences in structure and growth. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking about features that enable ferns to be much larger. So I need to recall what makes a plant grow bigger. I think it's related to their internal structures and how they transport water and nutrients.

Option A says ferns have more efficient photosynthesis. I'm not sure if that's the main reason. I mean, both plants photosynthesize, but maybe it's more about their vascular system.

Option B mentions higher nutrient content. That doesn't sound right. I don't think the amount of nutrients is the key factor here.

Option C talks about a stronger stem. Well, ferns do have stems, but I think it's more about their vascular tissues like xylem and phloem which help transport water and minerals. So maybe the stem strength isn't the main point.

Option D says they move to more fertile areas. That doesn't make sense. Plants don't move; they grow where they are rooted.

Option E claims mosses have a shorter life cycle limiting their size. I don't think the life cycle length directly affects size. Some mosses can be quite small but not necessarily because of their life cycle.

Option F suggests a symbiotic relationship with fungi. While some plants do have mycorrhizal relationships, I'm not sure if that's the main reason for size difference here.

Option G says it's because of an elaborate root system and vascular system. That rings a bell. Ferns have roots and vascular tissues (xylem for water, phloem for nutrients), which mosses lack. Without these, mosses can't transport enough water and minerals to support large sizes. So this seems correct.

Option H claims larger leaves. But size of leaves alone doesn't determine overall plant size. Plus, some mosses have pretty small leaves if they have them at all.

Option I mentions bacteria in the rhizosphere. I don't recall that being a primary factor for size differences between ferns and mosses.

Option J says resistance to pests and diseases. That might affect growth, but it's not directly related to structural features that allow larger size.

So putting it together, the key difference is the vascular system and root structure. Ferns have these, mosses don't. That allows them to support larger sizes. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: Because of the presence of an elaborate root system and a vascular system, the ferns are able to grow to a much larger size than are the mosses.
