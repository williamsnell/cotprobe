Question:

Which of the following statements concerning transamination is correct?


Options:

A: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin C.
B: Transamination is an irreversible reaction in amino acid catabolism.
C: Only non-essential (dispensable) amino acids undergo transamination.
D: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B12.
E: Transamination is a process by which proteins are synthesized.
F: Transamination is involved in the creation of essential amino acids only.
G: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin D.
H: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6.
I: Transamination does not involve enzymes.
J: Transamination only occurs in the liver.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about transamination is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about transamination. I remember that transamination is a process where an amino acid donates its amino group to another molecule, typically a keto acid. This process is important in the metabolism of amino acids, especially in their catabolism.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin C. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. Vitamin C is ascorbic acid and I think it's involved in other processes like hydroxylation, but I don't recall it being a coenzyme for transaminases. Maybe it's more related to enzymes like those in the citric acid cycle or something else. So I might rule this out.

Option B: Transamination is an irreversible reaction in amino acid catabolism. Wait, I thought transamination is a reversible reaction. It's part of the cycle that interconverts amino acids, so they can be broken down or used for synthesis. So this statement is probably incorrect because it's reversible, not irreversible.

Option C: Only non-essential (dispensable) amino acids undergo transamination. Non-essential amino acids are those the body can make, so they're not needed from the diet. But transamination can happen with both essential and non-essential amino acids, right? Because the body needs to process all amino acids. So this is incorrect because both types can undergo transamination.

Option D: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for enzymes like methyltransferases, I think. For example, in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, B12 is needed. But transaminases use a different cofactor. I believe they use pyridoxal phosphate, which is from vitamin B6. So D is wrong.

Option E: Transamination is a process by which proteins are synthesized. No, that's not right. Transamination is about the breakdown of amino acids, not synthesis. Protein synthesis is done through peptide bond formation, not transamination. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Transamination is involved in the creation of essential amino acids only. No, transamination can create non-essential amino acids too. For example, when an amino group is transferred to a keto acid, it can form various amino acids, both essential and non-essential depending on the source. So F is wrong.

Option G: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin D. Vitamin D is more about calcium absorption and not directly involved in amino acid metabolism as a coenzyme. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6. Yes, I remember that transaminases, or transaminases, require pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme. And pyridoxal phosphate is derived from vitamin B6. So H seems correct.

Option I: Transamination does not involve enzymes. That can't be right. Transamination is an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, so I is definitely wrong.

Option J: Transamination only occurs in the liver. No, transamination happens in various tissues, not just the liver. For example, muscles also have transaminases to process amino acids from protein breakdown. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H.
