Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about defining a BASIC function. The function needs to compute the square root of (x squared minus y squared) if x squared is greater than or equal to y squared. But if y squared is greater than x squared, it should compute the square root of (y squared minus x squared). Hmm, that sounds like taking the square root of the positive difference between x² and y², regardless of which is larger.

Let me think about how to approach this. The function should first determine whether x² is >= y² or not. If it is, then sqrt(x² - y²). Otherwise, sqrt(y² - x²). Alternatively, another way to think about it is to compute the absolute value of (x² - y²) and then take the square root of that. Because the square root of a negative number isn't a real number, so we need to ensure we're taking the square root of a positive value.

Looking at the options, I see that some of them use absolute value directly, while others try to compute it using conditionals.

Option E, for example, calculates X1 as the absolute value of (X² - Y²) and then takes the square root. That seems straightforward. So E is a candidate because it directly uses the absolute value, which would handle both cases without needing conditional checks.

Other options like A through D and F through J use conditional statements. Let's analyze them.

Option A: It computes X1 as X² / Y². Then if X1 >=1, it leaves it as is, else swaps to Y²/X². Then takes the square root. Wait, but that would compute sqrt((X²/Y²) if X² >= Y² else sqrt(Y²/X²)). But the problem requires sqrt(x² - y²) or sqrt(y² -x²), which isn't the same as sqrt(x²/y²) or sqrt(y²/x²). So A is incorrect.

Option B: X1 is Y² + X². Then if X1 >=0, which it always is, it negates X1, making it negative, and then takes the square root. That would result in sqrt(-(Y²+X²)), which is imaginary, so B is wrong.

Option C: Similar to B, X1 is X² + Y², which is always positive. Then negated, leading to sqrt of a negative number. So C is wrong.

Option D: X1 is X² - Y². If X1 >=0, then FNA is sqrt(X1). Else, it negates X1 and takes sqrt. Wait, no. Let me check. Line 12 says IF X1 >=0 then 14. So if X1 is positive, it sets FNA to X1^0.5. If not, it goes to line 13, which sets X1 to -X1 (so positive) and then takes sqrt. So D is doing the same as E, but with a conditional. Because if X² - Y² is positive, return sqrt, else return sqrt of (Y² - X²). So D is correct too. Wait, but E is simpler and doesn't need conditionals, just absolute value.

Wait, but looking at D's code:

Line 11: X1 = X² - Y²
Line 12: If X1 >=0, then line 14, else line 13.
Line 14: FNA = X1^0.5
Line 13: X1 = -X1, then line 14.

So D is effectively taking the absolute value of (X² - Y²), then square root. Because if X² - Y² is positive, it's used as is. If negative, it's negated to positive. So D is correct.

Wait, but E is also correct because it directly computes the absolute value. So both D and E would seem to work. But wait, let me check what each does.

E: X1 = ABS(X² - Y²), then FNA = sqrt(X1). So that's exactly what we need.

D: It computes X1 as X² - Y². If X1 >=0, then FNA = X1^0.5. Else, X1 becomes -(X²-Y²) which is Y² - X², then FNA is sqrt of that. So D works too.

Wait, but looking at the code for D, line 13 is X1 = -X1, which is -(X²-Y²) = Y² - X². Then line 14 is X1^0.5, which is sqrt(Y² - X²). So yes, D does the same as E.

But looking at the options, E is a one-liner without conditionals. D uses conditionals but ends up doing the same thing. So both D and E are correct? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option E: 11 LET X1 = ABS(X^2 - Y^2) 12 LET FNA = X1^0.5 15 FNEND

So yes, that's correct.

Option D: 11 LET X1 = X^2 - Y^2 12 IF X1 >= 0 then 14 13 LET X1 = -X1 14 LET FNA = X1^0.5 15 FNEND

So D is also correct because if X1 is positive, FNA is sqrt(X1). If X1 is negative, it becomes positive and then sqrt. So D and E both seem correct.

Wait, but the question is to select one answer. Did I miss something?

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read each option carefully.

Option E: Yes, it uses absolute value, so correct.

Option D: Line 12 is IF X1 >=0 then 14. So line 14 is executed only if X1 >=0. Else, line 13 is executed: X1 = -X1, then line 14 is executed.

So in D, if X1 is positive, FNA is sqrt(X1). If X1 is negative, X1 becomes positive (Y² - X²), then sqrt. So D is correct.

So both D and E are correct? But that can't be because the options are unique.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me check the other options again.

No, the correct approach is to take the absolute value of (x² - y²) and then square root. So E does this directly. D does it via conditionals but ends up with the same result.

Wait, but looking at D's code, when X1 is negative, it sets X1 = -X1, which is Y² - X², and then takes sqrt. So yes, that's correct.

So both D and E are correct. But the options likely have only one correct answer. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the function is supposed to compute sqrt(x² - y²) if x² >= y², else sqrt(y² - x²). So in code, that's equivalent to sqrt( |x² - y²| ). So E does that directly.

Option D, however, computes X1 = X² - Y². If X1 >=0, FNA is sqrt(X1). Else, X1 becomes -(X²-Y²) = Y² - X², and then FNA is sqrt(X1), which is sqrt(Y² - X²). So D is also correct.

So both D and E are correct. But looking back, perhaps the options have only one correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I misread. Let me check:

Option E: 11 LET X1 = ABS(X^2 - Y^2) 12 LET FNA = X1^0.5 15 FNEND

Yes, that's correct.

Option D: It's using X1 = X² - Y². Then if X1 >=0, FNA is sqrt(X1). Else, X1 is set to -(X1), which is Y² - X², then FNA is sqrt(X1). So D is also correct.

Wait, but in the options, perhaps E is simpler and more straightforward, so it's the intended answer. But the question allows for either approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options, and only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check D's code:

Line 11: X1 = X² - Y²

Line 12: IF X1 >=0 then 14 (so if true, execute line 14, else go to line 13)

Line 13: X1 = -X1

Line 14: FNA = X1^0.5

So in D, if X² >= Y², X1 is positive, FNA is sqrt(X² - Y²). If X² < Y², X1 is negative; line 13 makes it positive (Y² - X²), then FNA is sqrt(Y² - X²). So D is correct.

Similarly, E is correct because it directly uses absolute value.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps E is the better answer because it's more straightforward and doesn't require conditional checks.

But the question is to select one answer. Let me check the options again to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the code in D and E.

In D, the code is:

11 LET X1 = X^2 - Y^2
12 IF X1 >= 0 then 14
13 LET X1 = -X1
14 LET FNA = X1^0.5

So, if X1 is positive, it's used as is. If negative, it's made positive, then square rooted. So yes, correct.

In E, it's:

11 LET X1 = ABS(X^2 - Y^2)
12 LET FNA = X1^0.5

Yes, correct.

So both D and E are correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is present.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the options:

Option E is:

E: 1 DEF FNA(X,Y) 11 LET X1 = ABS(X^2 - Y^2) 12 LET FNA = X1^0.5 15 FNEND

Yes, correct.

Option D is:

D: 1 DEF FNA(X,Y) 11 LET X1 = X^2 - Y^2 12 IF X1 >= 0 then 14 13 LET X1 = -X1 14 LET FNA = X1^0.5 15 FNEND

Yes, correct.

So both D and E are correct, but the options only have one correct answer. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the question is to define a function that takes on sqrt(x² - y²) if x² >= y², else sqrt(y² - x²). So both approaches achieve that.

But perhaps the question expects the absolute value approach, which is more concise. So E is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E because it's more straightforward.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only E is correct. Because in D, when X1 is negative, it's being set to -X1, which is Y² - X², but then taking the square root. So both D and E are correct.

But perhaps the question expects E as the answer because it uses absolute value, which directly gives the desired result without conditionals.

So, I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E, as it directly computes the absolute difference between x² and y² and then takes the square root, which satisfies the problem's requirements without unnecessary conditionals.
