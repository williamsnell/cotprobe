Okay, so I've got this question here about why rising prices are a problem. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to economics, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question is asking why rising prices are a problem. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one and see which makes the most sense.

Option A: People will stop spending money altogether. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. If prices go up, does that mean people stop spending? I think maybe they spend less, but altogether? That seems a bit extreme. Maybe not A.

Option B: Businesses will have to pay more taxes. I'm not sure how taxes directly relate to rising prices. Maybe if profits go up, taxes might, but I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind but maybe move on for now.

Option C: It leads to a decrease in the national GDP. GDP is the total economic output. If prices rise, does that directly lower GDP? I'm not sure. GDP is often measured in nominal terms, so maybe it doesn't decrease. Maybe it could even go up. So perhaps C isn't the right answer.

Option D: The government will have to print more money. Printing more money can lead to inflation, but is that a direct problem? Well, rising prices are inflation, so maybe the government's action is a cause, not a problem itself. But the question is why rising prices are a problem, not why they happen.

Option E: It causes a decrease in stock market values. I don't think rising prices directly cause stock markets to drop. Maybe in certain cases, but generally, I'm not sure. I'll come back to this.

Option F: Money in household savings accounts can now buy fewer goods and services. Oh, this sounds familiar. If prices rise, the same amount of money buys less. So savings lose purchasing power. That makes sense as a problem because people's savings are worth less. So F could be a good candidate.

Option G: Household incomes generally do not rise with prices. So if prices go up and incomes don't, people can't afford as much. That's a problem because it reduces their standard of living. So G is another possible answer.

Option H: The economy could run out of money. That sounds a bit vague. I don't think the economy literally runs out of money; more money is printed. Maybe H isn't the right choice.

Option I: Borrowers have to repay loans with more dollars. Wait, if prices rise, the real value of the dollars decreases. So borrowers are paying back with dollars that are worth less, which is actually good for them. So I doesn't seem like a problem; it's more of a benefit for borrowers.

Option J: It will lead to an increase in unemployment rates. Rising prices, or inflation, might cause unemployment if businesses cut costs, but I'm not sure if it's a direct result. Maybe during economic downturns, but not necessarily always. So J is a possibility, but I'm not certain.

Now, thinking about each option, the main issues with rising prices are the loss of purchasing power and the impact on people's incomes. Option F talks about savings and F, while G is about incomes not rising. Both are valid points, but which one is more directly a problem? 

Wait, the question is why rising prices are a problem. So maybe the answer is about how it affects people's ability to buy things. If prices rise and their incomes don't, they can't afford as much, leading to decreased spending. That ties into F as well because savings lose value.

But looking at the options, F is about savings, and G is about income. Which one is more directly the problem? I think both are problems, but which is the more common issue discussed. I remember that one of the big issues with inflation is that it erodes purchasing power, so both F and G are correct in that sense.

Wait, but looking back, the options are single answers. So which one is the best fit? Let me think again.

If prices rise and people's incomes don't, they have less to spend, which can lead to a decrease in demand, possibly affecting GDP, but the immediate problem is that their money doesn't go as far. So F is about savings, but G is about income not rising with prices, which affects their ability to consume. 

I think the more direct answer is F because it's about the money they have saved losing value. But wait, in reality, when prices rise, even if people have the same income, each dollar buys less. So if their income doesn't rise, they're worse off. So both F and G are correct, but perhaps G is the more direct reason why it's a problem for households.

Wait, the question is about rising prices being a problem. So the problem is that people's incomes don't keep up, making their real income lower. So G might be the better answer. Alternatively, F is about savings, but not everyone saves, while G affects everyone's ability to purchase.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it differently. The problem is that when prices rise, if wages or incomes don't rise, people can't afford as much. So G says that household incomes generally don't rise with prices, making it a problem because they can't afford things.

Alternatively, F is about savings, which is a subset of people's money. So maybe the best answer is F because it's a direct effect on the value of money held. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: which of these is a direct effect of rising prices. F is a direct effect because higher prices mean each dollar buys less, so savings lose value. G is more about the cause (incomes not rising) rather than the effect of rising prices. So maybe F is the effect, and G is a related issue but not the direct problem.

Wait, the question is why rising prices are a problem. So the problem is that the purchasing power decreases. So F and G both relate to that. But F is about savings, which is part of people's wealth, while G is about income. So perhaps F is correct because it's about the money people have saved, while G is about future income.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look for the most direct answer. The problem with rising prices is that it makes money worth less. So F is about savings, which is a form of money. So F is correct because the money in savings can't buy as much, which is a direct problem caused by rising prices.

Alternatively, G is about income not rising, which is a separate issue but related. But the question is about rising prices specifically, so F is more directly a result of that.

Wait, but the question is about why rising prices are a problem. The answer should be something that directly results from rising prices. So F is a direct result because higher prices reduce the value of savings. G is more about the cause (income not rising) which may or may not be due to prices.

So I think F is the correct answer.

The problem with rising prices is that it reduces the purchasing power of money, particularly savings. When prices rise, the same amount of money in savings accounts can buy fewer goods and services, directly impacting people's ability to afford essential items. While other factors like income growth can mitigate this, the question focuses on the direct issue caused by rising prices. Therefore, the best answer is:

F
