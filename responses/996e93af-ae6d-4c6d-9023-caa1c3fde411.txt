Okay, let's see. The Stadlow family has two adults and two children. They went to an amusement park where the rides cost 75 cents for adults and 50 cents for children. Mr. Stadlow has $10, and we need to find out how many rides the family can go on.

Hmm, so first, I should calculate the total cost for one ride for the entire family. Since there are two adults and two children, each ride would cost 2 times 75 cents plus 2 times 50 cents. Let me write that down: (2 * $0.75) + (2 * $0.50). 

Calculating each part: 2 * 0.75 is $1.50, and 2 * 0.50 is $1.00. Adding those together gives $2.50 per ride for the family.

Now, Mr. Stadlow has $10. To find out how many rides they can afford, I need to divide the total money by the cost per ride. So, $10 divided by $2.50. Let me do that division: 10 ÷ 2.5. 

Wait, 2.5 goes into 10 how many times? Well, 2.5 times 4 is $10. So that would be 4 rides. But wait, let me double-check. If each ride is $2.50, then 4 rides would cost 4 * 2.50 = $10 exactly. So they can go on exactly 4 rides without any money left over.

Looking at the options, F is 4 rides. So the answer should be F.

The family consists of two adults and two children. Each ride costs 75 cents for adults and 50 cents for children. Calculating the total cost per ride: (2 × $0.75) + (2 × $0.50) = $2.50. With $10, the number of rides is $10 ÷ $2.50 = 4 rides.

Answer: F
