Okay, so I need to figure out which option is the best buy among the given choices. The best buy is usually the one that offers the lowest price per unit, so I think I should calculate the price per bar of soap for each option.

Let me start by listing all the options again to make sure I don't miss any:

A: 17 bars for $38.72
B: 16 bars for $36.48
C: 12 bars for $27.60
D: 20 bars for $45.00
E: 11 bars for $25.08
F: 10 bars for $23.20
G: 15 bars for $34.50
H: 18 bars for $40.68
I: 14 bars for $31.92
J: 13 bars for $29.51

Alright, for each option, I'll divide the total price by the number of bars to get the price per bar. Let me do this one by one.

Starting with option A: $38.72 divided by 17. Hmm, 38.72 ÷ 17. Let me calculate that. 17 times 2 is 34, which leaves 4.72. 17 goes into 47 about 2 times (17*2=34), remainder 13. Bring down the 2: 132 ÷17 is about 7 times (17*7=119), remainder 13. So it's approximately $2.28 per bar.

Option B: $36.48 ÷16. 16*2=32, so 36.48 -32=4.48. 4.48 ÷16 is 0.28. So total is $2.28 per bar. Wait, same as A?

Wait, let me check: 16 * 2.28 = 36.48, yes. So both A and B have the same price per bar so far.

Option C: $27.60 ÷12. 12*2.3=27.6, so exactly $2.30 per bar. That's a bit higher than A and B.

Option D: $45 ÷20 = $2.25 per bar. Oh, that's lower than A and B. So D is better so far.

Option E: $25.08 ÷11. Let me calculate. 11*2=22, so 25.08-22=3.08. 3.08 ÷11 is 0.28. So total is $2.28 per bar. Same as A and B.

Option F: $23.20 ÷10 = $2.32 per bar. That's higher than D, but let me see others.

Option G: $34.50 ÷15. 15*2.3=34.5, so exactly $2.30 per bar.

Option H: $40.68 ÷18. Let's see, 18*2.26=40.68? Let me check: 18*2=36, 18*0.26=4.68, so 36+4.68=40.68. So $2.26 per bar. That's lower than D's $2.25? Wait, no: 2.26 is higher than 2.25, so D is still better.

Wait, no, 2.25 is lower than 2.26, so D is better.

Option I: $31.92 ÷14. 14*2.28=31.92. So $2.28 per bar.

Option J: $29.51 ÷13. Let me compute: 13*2=26, 13*0.73=9.49. So 26+9.49=35.49, which is more than 29.51. Wait, that can't be right. Let me do it properly.

Wait, 13 times 2 is 26, subtract from 29.51: 29.51 -26=3.51. Now, 3.51 ÷13 = 0.27. So total is 2 +0.27=2.27 per bar. So J is $2.27, which is slightly lower than D's $2.25? No, 2.25 is lower than 2.27. So D is still better.

Wait, let me double-check J's calculation. 13 bars for $29.51. 29.51 ÷13. Let's do it step by step. 13*2=26, subtract from 29.51: 3.51 left. 3.51 ÷13: 13*0.27=3.51. So total is $2.27. So J is $2.27, which is higher than D's $2.25.

So far, D is the best at $2.25 per bar. Let me check all options again to make sure I didn't miss any lower ones.

Wait, option F was $2.32, which is higher. Option D is $2.25. Let's see if any other options have lower per bar.

Wait, option H was $2.26, which is higher than D. Option J is $2.27, also higher. So D is the lowest so far.

Wait, but wait, let me check option E again. E was $25.08 ÷11. Let me compute that again. 11*2=22, so 25.08-22=3.08. 3.08 ÷11=0.28. So total is $2.28. So E is $2.28.

Option I: $31.92 ÷14. 14*2.28=31.92, so $2.28.

Option G: $34.50 ÷15=2.30.

Option C: $2.30.

So the lowest is D at $2.25 per bar.

Wait, but let me confirm D: 20 bars for $45.00. 45 ÷20=2.25. Yes, correct.

So the best buy is option D.

The best buy is determined by calculating the price per bar of soap for each option. Option D, which offers 20 bars for $45.00, has the lowest price per bar at $2.25.
