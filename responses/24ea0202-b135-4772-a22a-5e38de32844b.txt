Okay, so I have this problem about Maxwell's Gift Shoppe, and I need to find the inventory value at cost. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

The problem says that the inventory is computed at selling price, which represents a 37 and a half percent mark-up over cost. The value as of December 31 is $5,954, and I need to find the value at cost. Hmm, mark-up is usually the amount added to the cost to get the selling price, right? So if the selling price includes a 37.5% mark-up, that means the selling price is 137.5% of the cost. 

Wait, let me think again. Mark-up is calculated on the cost, so if the mark-up is 37.5%, then the selling price is cost plus 37.5% of the cost, which is 137.5% of the cost. So, if I let C be the cost, then the selling price S is S = C * 1.375. 

But the inventory value given is at selling price, which is $5,954. So that would be the total selling price, and I need to find the total cost. So, if S = C * 1.375, then C = S / 1.375. 

Let me plug in the numbers. S is $5,954, so C = 5954 / 1.375. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 1.375 is the same as 1 and 3/8, which is 11/8. So dividing by 11/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/11. So C = 5954 * (8/11). 

Let me compute 5954 divided by 11 first. 11 times 541 is 5,951 (because 540*11=5,940, and 1*11=11, so 5,940+11=5,951). So 5954 - 5,951 is 3. So 5954 /11 is 541 with a remainder of 3, so 541.2727 approximately. 

Then multiply by 8: 541.2727 *8. Let's see, 500*8=4,000, 40*8=320, 1.2727*8≈10.18. So adding up: 4,000 + 320 = 4,320 +10.18=4,330.18. 

Wait, that's exactly one of the options. Option D is $4,330.18. So that must be the answer. 

But let me double-check. If the cost is 4,330.18, then 37.5% of that is 0.375 *4,330.18. Let's compute that: 4,330.18 * 0.375. 

Well, 4,330.18 *0.3 is 1,299.054, and 4,330.18 *0.075 is 324.7635. Adding those together gives 1,299.054 +324.7635 ≈1,623.8175. 

So the selling price would be cost plus mark-up: 4,330.18 +1,623.8175 =5,954, which matches the given value. So yes, the calculation seems correct. 

I think the correct answer is D: $4,330.18.

The inventory value at selling price is $5,954, which includes a 37.5% markup over cost. To find the cost, divide $5,954 by 1.375, resulting in $4,330.18. This matches option D.

Answer: D
