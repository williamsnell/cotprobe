Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I need to figure out which concept applies. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about Coach Peterson sitting Jake out for the first quarter because he was late to practice. Then Jake was on time for the rest of the season. The question is asking which psychological concept the coach used.

Hmm, the options are modeling, shaping, learned helplessness, positive reinforcement, positive punishment, negative reinforcement, omission training, extinction, and counterconditioning.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means.

Modeling is when someone learns by observing another person. So like, if a coach models a behavior, the player imitates it. But in this case, the coach is reacting to Jake's lateness, not demonstrating a behavior.

Shaping is a method where a learner is guided toward the desired behavior by reinforcing closer and closer approximations. That seems more about teaching a new behavior step by step, which doesn't quite fit here.

Learned helplessness is when an individual learns to feel unable to control or avoid negative situations, leading to a lack of effort. I don't think that's what's happening here because Jake was late once and then was on time, so it's more about a consequence than learned helplessness.

Positive reinforcement is when a behavior is strengthened by adding a positive stimulus. For example, giving a reward when someone does something right. But here, the coach is taking away play time, which is a consequence, not adding something positive.

Positive punishment is when a behavior is followed by a negative stimulus to decrease the behavior. Like if Jake is late, he sits out. So this seems to fit because the coach is applying a punishment (sitting out) to decrease the behavior of being late.

Negative reinforcement is when a behavior is strengthened by removing an aversive stimulus. So if Jake's lateness led to a punishment being removed, but that's not the case here. The coach added a punishment, not removing something negative.

Omission training is when a behavior is reinforced by the absence of a negative stimulus. For example, not scolding a child when they clean up. But here, the coach is applying a punishment, so omission training doesn't fit.

Extinction is when a response is not reinforced, leading to it decreasing over time. But extinction usually involves not reinforcing a behavior anymore, which isn't exactly what's happening here because the coach is actively punishing.

Counterconditioning is a process where a person learns to pair a previously negative stimulus with a positive one, changing their emotional response. That doesn't apply here.

So, putting it all together, Coach Peterson used positive punishment because he applied a negative consequence (sitting out) to decrease Jake's lateness.

Coach Peterson used positive punishment by sitting Jake out as a consequence of being late, aiming to decrease the behavior.
