Question:

Dr. Delbert Dinwoody is currently treating a 35-year-old client who has received a diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence. With the client's permission, Dr. Dinwoody invites the client's wife to participate in couple therapy. Inviting the wife to participate in therapy is:

Options:

A: acceptable as long as the client and wife are not separated or in the process of divorce.
B: acceptable as long as the wife is not receiving mental health services from another professional.
C: "unacceptable because in this situation, the wife is “vulnerable to undue inﬂuence."""
D: acceptable only if the wife has also been diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence.
E: acceptable as long as he believes couple therapy will benefit the client's progress in dealing with his alcohol problem.
F: unacceptable because the wife should seek her own professional help.
G: "unacceptable because doing so creates a ""conﬂict of interest.”"
H: acceptable only if the wife gives her written consent to participate in the therapy.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Dr. Dinwoody inviting the wife of his client to participate in couple therapy. The client is a 35-year-old with Alcohol Dependence, and he's allowed his wife to join. The question is whether this is acceptable or not, and there are several options to choose from.

First, I need to understand the context. The client has alcohol dependence, and the therapist is inviting the spouse to participate. I remember that in therapy, especially when involving family or couples, there are ethical considerations. Therapists have to be careful about dual relationships or situations where their judgment might be compromised.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's acceptable if they're not separated or getting a divorce. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The question doesn't mention their marital status beyond being married, so maybe this isn't the key point.

Option B talks about the wife not receiving mental health services elsewhere. I'm not certain about that. Maybe if she's in therapy elsewhere, there could be coordination issues, but I don't know if that's a strict rule.

Option C claims it's unacceptable because the wife is vulnerable to undue influence. That sounds like a possible ethical concern. If the therapist is treating both the husband and wife, there's a risk that one might unduly influence the other, especially in a situation where one is dependent on the other.

Option D says it's acceptable only if the wife also has Alcohol Dependence. I don't think that's necessarily the case. Sometimes, couples therapy can be beneficial even if only one person has the issue, as it can address the dynamics affecting both.

Option E states it's acceptable if the therapist believes it will help the client. That sounds more like a therapeutic judgment call. Therapists often make decisions based on what they think will benefit the client, but there might be ethical guidelines against certain dual relationships regardless of intent.

Option F thinks it's unacceptable because the wife should seek her own help. While it's good for her to have her own support, the question is about the therapist inviting her, not about whether she should seek help elsewhere. So this might not be the right answer.

Option G says it's a conflict of interest. That could be relevant if treating both the client and their spouse creates a situation where the therapist's loyalties are divided. That's a strong ethical concern because a therapist can't have conflicting interests.

Option H requires written consent, which is about informed consent. While important, I think the question is more about the ethical appropriateness rather than the procedural aspect of getting consent.

Option I suggests bias might develop. That's possible, but the main issue in dual relationships is usually the conflict of interest rather than bias, though they can be related.

Option J claims it infringes on the client's individual therapy. I'm not sure about that. The client gave permission, so it's more about the therapist's ethical guidelines than about infringing on the client's process.

So, considering all options, the main ethical issue when a therapist treats both a client and their spouse is the potential conflict of interest. Treating both can make it hard for the therapist to remain impartial. Therefore, Option G seems correct because it points out a conflict of interest. Alternatively, Option C about undue influence is also a possibility, but I think the conflict of interest is a more standard concern in such cases.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Some sources say that treating family members can be permissible if certain conditions are met, like informed consent and ensuring no conflict of interest. So if the client agreed and the wife is willing, maybe it's acceptable as per Option E, which is based on the therapist's belief in its benefit. But I'm not sure if the ethical guidelines allow that without more conditions.

Alternatively, some guidelines might prohibit therapists from treating family members because of the inherent risks of dual relationships, even if the client consents. So in that case, Option G would be the right answer because it's a conflict of interest, making it unacceptable.

I think I'll go with Option G because the conflict of interest is a significant ethical issue when a therapist is treating both a client and their spouse without any safeguards in place.

The correct answer is **G: unacceptable because doing so creates a "conflict of interest."** 

When a therapist treats both a client and their spouse, it can lead to a conflict of interest, making it difficult to remain impartial. Ethical guidelines often prohibit such dual relationships to prevent potential biases and safeguard the therapeutic process. Therefore, inviting the wife to participate in therapy creates this conflict of interest, making it unacceptable.

Answer: G
