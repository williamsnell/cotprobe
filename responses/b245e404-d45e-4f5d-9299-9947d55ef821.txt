Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a single-phase, one-pulse controlled circuit. The question is about finding the range of firing angle control given a specific counter electromotive force (emf) and source voltage.

Alright, let's break down what's given. The load has a counter emf E of 200 V, and the source voltage is 400 sin(314t). I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in a single-phase controlled rectifier, the firing angle determines how much of the AC input is rectified into DC. The counter emf is generated by the load, which in this case is a motor, perhaps. Counter emf usually opposes the supply voltage, so when the load is a motor, the counter emf depends on the speed of the motor.

The formula that relates the counter emf to the firing angle is something like E = V * sin(α), where V is the source voltage and α is the firing angle. Or wait, maybe it's E = V * sin(θ), where θ is the angle where the thyristor is triggered. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is E = V * sin(α), where α is the firing angle. So the maximum counter emf occurs when sin(α) is maximum, which is at α = 90°, giving E_max = V. In this case, the source voltage is 400 V, so the maximum E would be 400 V. But the load's E is 200 V, which is half of that. So, I think we can set up the equation 200 = 400 * sin(α), which simplifies to sin(α) = 0.5. So, α would be 30°, right? Because sin(30°) is 0.5.

Wait, but that's just one part. The question is about the range of firing angles. So when would the counter emf be maximum and minimum? Hmm, wait. The counter emf E can vary depending on the firing angle. But in this problem, E is fixed at 200 V, so we need to find α such that E = 200 V.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up things. Let me think again. The counter emf E is given as 200 V, which is the load's counter emf. The source voltage is 400 sin(314t). So, perhaps the relationship between the counter emf and the firing angle is E = V * (1 + cos(α)) / 2 or something else. Or maybe it's E = V * sin(α). I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: in a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier, the average output voltage is V_out = (V_peak * sin(α)) / π, but that's for voltage. But in this case, we're dealing with the counter emf. Hmm. Alternatively, the peak counter emf occurs when α is 90°, so E_peak would be V_peak. So, V_peak here is 400 V, so E_peak would be 400 V. But the load's E is 200 V, which is half of that. So maybe the firing angle is such that the counter emf is 200 V. So, E = V * sin(α) would imply sin(α) = 0.5, so α = 30°. But that would be the angle for E=200 V.

Wait, but the question is about the range of firing angles. So, if the counter emf is 200 V, which is half of the peak, then the firing angle would be 30°. But that's just a single value. So perhaps the range is from when E starts to be significant to when it's maximum. Or maybe the range is from when the counter emf starts to be non-zero to when it becomes maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps the counter emf is given as E = V * sin(α), so for E to be 200 V, α would be 30°, as before. But the firing angle can vary to control the counter emf. Wait, but the question specifies the load has a counter emf E of 200 V. So perhaps the firing angle is set to achieve E=200 V. So the firing angle is fixed at 30°, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about a range.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The load's counter emf is 200 V, and the source is 400 sin(314t). So, the counter emf is half the peak voltage of the source. So, when the firing angle is set such that the counter emf is 200 V, that would correspond to α where E = 200 = 400 * sin(α), so sin(α)=0.5, which gives α=30°, as before.

But the question is about the range of firing angles. So perhaps the counter emf can vary between 0 and 400 V, but in this case, it's fixed at 200 V. So, maybe when the load is not drawing any current, the firing angle can be as low as 0°, but that doesn't make sense because at α=0°, the thyristor would conduct the entire cycle, which might not be applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the counter emf is related to the phase angle. So, when the firing angle α is less than 90°, the counter emf is positive, and as α increases beyond 90°, the counter emf decreases. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the counter emf E is given by E = V * (1 + cos(α)) / 2. So, if E=200 V, then 200 = (400/2) * (1 + cos(α)), because V is 400 V peak. So 200 = 200 * (1 + cos(α)) → 1 + cos(α) = 1 → cos(α) = 0 → α=90°. That makes sense because the maximum counter emf occurs at α=90°, which would be E=400/2=200 V. Wait, but that's not matching my earlier thought.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the formula. Maybe I should derive it. In a single-phase controlled rectifier, the average output voltage is V_out = (V_m * sin(α)) / π, where V_m is the peak voltage. But that's for the output voltage. For the counter emf, perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, the counter emf in a motor is given by E = K * ω, where K is a constant and ω is the angular velocity. But in this case, perhaps the counter emf is related to the firing angle α. So, when the firing angle is α, the counter emf would be proportional to sin(α) or something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E = V_m * sin(α). So, if V_m is 400 V, then E = 400 sin(α). Given E=200 V, then sin(α)=0.5, so α=30°. But that's just the value, not a range. So if the counter emf is fixed at 200 V, then α is fixed at 30°, but that's not one of the options. Therefore, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the range of firing angles for which the counter emf is within a certain limit. Or maybe the counter emf is 200 V, which is half of the maximum possible, so the firing angle must be set such that E doesn't exceed 200 V. Alternatively, perhaps the range is from when the counter emf starts to contribute to when it's maximum.

Wait, another approach. The maximum counter emf occurs when the firing angle is 90°, giving E=400 V. But in this case, the load's E is 200 V, which is half of that. So perhaps the firing angle is set such that E is 200 V, which would be at α=30°, as before. But that's a single angle, not a range.

Wait, the question says "the range of firing angle control is". So perhaps the counter emf can vary between certain angles. Maybe the minimum firing angle is 30°, and the maximum is 150°, or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should think about when the counter emf becomes significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the counter emf is given by E = V_m * (1 + cos(α)) / 2. So, if E=200 V, then 200 = (400/2)*(1 + cos(α)) → 200 = 200*(1 + cos(α)) → 1 + cos(α) = 1 → cos(α)=0 → α=90°. That's the same as before. So at α=90°, E=200 V. But that's just one angle. So perhaps the range is from 90° to some other angle, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. The options given are ranges, so perhaps the firing angle can vary from a minimum to a maximum value to achieve certain conditions. For instance, when the counter emf is 200 V, the firing angle could be 30°, but maybe the range is from 30° to 150°, which is option F. Or perhaps from 60° to 120°, etc.

Wait, another thought: in a single-phase controlled rectifier, the maximum possible counter emf occurs when the firing angle is 90°, giving E=400 V. But the load's counter emf is 200 V, which is half of that, so perhaps α can be set such that E=200 V. That would be when α is such that sin(α)=0.5, which is 30°, as I thought earlier. But that's just one angle.

Wait, perhaps the counter emf can vary between 0 and 400 V, and 200 V is the peak in one direction. So, maybe the firing angle has to be in a certain range to allow E to be 200 V. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the range of α for which the counter emf is between certain limits.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible values of α where the counter emf is less than or equal to 200 V. If E = V * sin(α), then for E ≤ 200, sin(α) ≤ 0.5. So sin(α) ≤ 0.5 occurs when α ≤ 30° and α ≥ 150°, because sin(150°)=0.5. But that doesn't seem right because the counter emf would be negative in some regions, which might not make physical sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the counter emf is given by E = V_m * sin(α + 90°), or something else. I think I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E = V * (1 + cos(α)) / 2. So, E = (400 * (1 + cos(α)))/2 = 200*(1 + cos(α)). Setting E=200, we get 200=200*(1+cos(α)) → 1+cos(α)=1 → cos(α)=0 → α=90°. So at 90°, E=200 V. But that's only one point. So if the question is about the range of α where E is 200 V, that's only at 90°, but that's not a range.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the correct formula is E = V_m * (1 - cos(α)) / something. Alternatively, perhaps E = V_m * (1 - cos(α)) / 2. Let me try that. So E = (400*(1 - cos(α)))/2 = 200*(1 - cos(α)). Setting E=200 V, 200=200*(1 - cos(α)) → 1 - cos(α) = 1 → cos(α)=0 → α=90°. Again, same result.

Wait, maybe the formula is E = V_m * sin(α) / 2. So E = (400 * sin(α))/2 = 200 sin(α). So setting E=200, we get 200=200 sin(α) → sin(α)=1 → α=90°. So again, the same point.

I'm getting confused here because all these approaches are leading me to α=90°, but the question asks for a range. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is E = V_m * sin(α). So, E=400 sin(α). Setting E=200, sin(α)=0.5 → α=30° or 150°. So, the range of α where E=200 V is between 30° and 150°, because sine is positive in the first and second quadrants.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the firing angle α is between 30° and 150°, then E would be 200 V. Because sin(30°)=0.5 and sin(150°)=0.5. So, the range of firing angles would be from 30° to 150°, which is option F (30° to 150°).

But wait, let me think again. Because in a single-phase controlled rectifier, the firing angle α is the angle at which the thyristor is triggered. The output voltage is proportional to sin(α). But the counter emf in a motor is proportional to the back EMF induced, which depends on the speed. So, perhaps when the firing angle is less than 90°, the motor is accelerating, and when it's more than 90°, it's decelerating, leading to different signs of the counter emf.

But in terms of magnitude, the counter emf E would be 200 V when sin(α)=0.5, which occurs at α=30° and 150°. So, the range of firing angles where E=200 V is between 30° and 150°, meaning the firing angle can be in that range to maintain E=200 V.

Alternatively, perhaps the range is from the minimum α where E starts contributing to the maximum. But I'm not entirely sure, but based on the calculations, the range where E=200 V is α=30° to 150°, which is option F.

To determine the range of firing angles for a single-phase, one-pulse controlled circuit with a source voltage of \( V = 400 \sin(314t) \) and a load counter emf \( E = 200 \, \text{V} \), we analyze the relationship between the counter emf and the firing angle \( \alpha \).

The counter emf \( E \) is related to the source voltage \( V \) and the firing angle \( \alpha \) by the equation:

\[
E = V \cdot \sin(\alpha)
\]

Given \( E = 200 \, \text{V} \) and \( V = 400 \, \text{V} \), substituting into the equation gives:

\[
200 = 400 \cdot \sin(\alpha) \implies \sin(\alpha) = 0.5
\]

The sine function equals \( 0.5 \) at \( \alpha = 30^\circ \) and \( \alpha = 150^\circ \). Therefore, the firing angle \( \alpha \) must lie between \( 30^\circ \) and \( 150^\circ \) to maintain the counter emf at \( 200 \, \text{V} \).

Thus, the range of firing angles for the given counter emf is **30° to 150°**, corresponding to option **F**.
