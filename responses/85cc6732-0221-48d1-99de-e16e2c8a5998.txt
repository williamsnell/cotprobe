Question:

Characterize and differentiate capital widening from capi-tal deepening.

Options:

A: Capital widening is when more workers are provided with capital goods to increase their productivity, while capital deepening is when each worker is provided with a greater amount of capital goods to be more productive.
B: Capital widening refers to the increase in technology to boost productivity, while capital deepening is the investment in human capital to improve worker efficiency.
C: Capital widening is the practice of reducing capital investment to focus on labor-intensive production, while capital deepening involves increasing automation and capital intensity.
D: Capital widening is when more capital goods are provided to the same number of workers, while capital deepening is when the number of workers is increased without changing the amount of capital goods.
E: Capital widening occurs when the same amount of capital is spread over a larger workforce, leading to a potential decrease in productivity, while capital deepening is when additional capital is used to upgrade existing workers' tools and machinery.
F: Capital widening and capital deepening both refer to the addition of more capital goods to increase productivity.
G: Capital widening is when each worker is provided with a greater amount of capital goods to be more productive, while capital deepening is when more workers are provided with capital goods to increase their productivity.
H: Capital widening is the process of diversifying investments across different sectors to reduce risk, while capital deepening is the concentration of investments within a particular sector to increase specialization.
I: Capital widening is the expansion of capital to new geographic regions, while capital deepening is the enhancement of capital within existing production facilities.
J: Capital widening is when the overall investment in the economy increases without regard to the labor force, while capital deepening is when investment is focused on innovation rather than on increasing the capital per worker.

Okay, so I've got this question about capital widening and capital deepening. I'm a bit rusty on economics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that capital in economics refers to the stock of machinery, tools, and infrastructure that are used to produce goods and services. Both terms seem to involve increasing the amount of capital, but they must be doing so in different ways.

The question is asking me to differentiate between capital widening and capital deepening. I think I've heard that capital deepening has something to do with increasing the amount of capital per worker. So if you have the same number of workers but more machinery or better tools, that's capital deepening. It's like making each worker more efficient by giving them more to work with.

On the other hand, capital widening might involve expanding the scale of production. Maybe it's about increasing the number of workers while also increasing the capital, so overall investment goes up. Or perhaps it's about using more capital across a larger workforce. I'm a bit confused here.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says capital widening is providing more capital goods to more workers, increasing productivity. Capital deepening is giving each worker more. Wait, that sounds opposite of what I thought. Because I thought capital deepening is giving each worker more, so this would mean capital widening is giving more to more workers, which might mean each worker gets the same, but more are added.

Option B talks about technology and human capital. I think those are separate concepts. Capital widening/deepening is about physical capital, not technology or human capital, so B is probably wrong.

Option C says capital widening is reducing investment and focusing on labor, while deepening is increasing automation. That seems off because both terms are about increasing capital, not reducing it.

Option D says capital widening is more capital goods to the same number of workers, and deepening is more workers without changing capital. Wait, that seems opposite. Because if you have more workers without more capital, that's actually reducing capital per worker, which would lower productivity. So D might be incorrect.

Option E says capital widening is spreading the same capital over more workers, which could lower productivity. Capital deepening is adding more capital to upgrade existing tools. That sounds right. So for widening, same amount spread more, so each worker has lessâ€”maybe that's not efficient. Deepening is adding more per worker, making each more productive.

Option F says both are adding more capital to increase productivity. That's too vague and doesn't differentiate, so F is probably incorrect.

Option G is the reverse of A. G says capital widening is each worker getting more, and deepening is more workers with capital. That would mean G is the opposite of what I thought. But I thought capital deepening is about per worker, so G might be wrong.

Option H is about diversifying investments vs concentrating. That doesn't seem related to the concept of capital per worker. So H is likely incorrect.

Option I says capital widening is expanding to new regions, while deepening is enhancing within existing facilities. That's about location and not about per worker capital, so I think I is not the right answer.

Option J says capital widening is overall investment without regard to labor, and deepening is focused on innovation. That doesn't fit because both terms are about capital per worker, so J is probably wrong.

So going back, the correct definitions seem to be: capital deepening is when each worker has more capital, which increases productivity per worker. Capital widening is when the same or more capital is spread over more workers, which might not increase productivity as much.

Looking again, option E says capital widening is spreading the same capital over a larger workforce, leading to decreased productivity, and capital deepening is adding capital to upgrade existing tools. That seems correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say capital widening refers to an increase in the capital stock overall, regardless of the labor force. So it could be either more per worker or just more in total. But I think the standard distinction is that capital deepening is about increasing capital per worker, while capital widening is about expanding production by adding more workers with the same or more capital, but not necessarily per worker.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: if capital deepening is increasing capital per worker, then capital widening is increasing the total capital but not necessarily per worker. So for example, if you have 10 workers and add 5 more, and also add some capital, but not enough to increase per worker, that's widening. Alternatively, if you add more capital without adding workers, that's deepening.

But looking at the options, option E says capital widening is spreading the same capital over more workers, which would lower productivity, and deepening is adding capital to upgrade tools. That fits the idea that deepening is per worker, while widening is spreading same capital over more workers.

Alternatively, option G is the opposite, where capital widening is each worker getting more, and deepening is more workers. But that would mean G is incorrect because capital deepening is about per worker, so G's description of deepening as adding more workers without changing capital doesn't fit.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

- Capital deepening: increase in capital per worker. So each worker has more capital.

- Capital widening: increase in the total capital, possibly by adding more workers and more capital, but the per worker capital might not increase as much. Or it could mean expanding production without necessarily increasing per worker capital.

But the options don't clearly align with that. Looking back, option E seems to describe this correctly: capital widening is spreading same capital over more workers (so per worker capital decreases), and deepening is adding more capital to upgrade tools (so per worker increases).

So the correct answer should be E.

The question asks to differentiate between capital widening and capital deepening. Capital deepening refers to increasing the amount of capital per worker, making each worker more productive. Capital widening, on the other hand, involves spreading the same or more capital over a larger workforce, which may not necessarily increase productivity per worker.

Option E correctly captures this distinction: capital widening is when the same amount of capital is spread over a larger workforce, potentially decreasing productivity, while capital deepening involves adding more capital to upgrade existing workers' tools and machinery, thereby increasing productivity per worker.

Answer: E
