C: Ms. Wane receives $12,500 and Ms. Watson receives $11,700
D: Ms. Wane receives $12,700 and Ms. Watson receives $11,500

Okay, so I've got this problem about two investors, Susan Wane and Dolly Watson, who put money into a corkscrew factory. The question is about figuring out how the profits are split after each gets their 8% interest on their investment. The business made $24,200 in total, and they split the profits equally after taking out the interest.

First, I need to break down what each step involves. Let me start by understanding the initial investments. Susan invested $35,000 and Dolly invested $20,000. So the total investment is 35k + 20k, which is $55,000.

Now, each of them is supposed to get 8% interest on their own investment. So I need to calculate 8% of each of their contributions separately.

Let me calculate Susan's interest first. 8% of $35,000. Hmm, 8% is 0.08 in decimal. So 35,000 multiplied by 0.08. Let me do that: 35,000 * 0.08 = 2,800. So Susan gets $2,800 interest.

Next, Dolly's interest. 8% of $20,000. Again, 20,000 * 0.08. That's 1,600. So Dolly gets $1,600 interest.

Now, the total interest they both get is 2,800 + 1,600 = $4,400. So together, they take out $4,400 as interest from the total profit.

The total profit is $24,200. But wait, I think I might be mixing up profit and total returns. Let me clarify: the business earned $24,200. I think this refers to the profit after covering the cost of their investments? Or is it the total return including their investments? Wait, no, the problem says they invested the money and the business earns $24,200. So I think that $24,200 is the total profit, not including their initial investments. So the $24,200 is the profit they split after taking their interest.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. The business earns $24,200, which is the profit. So from this profit, first, each investor gets 8% of their investment. Then, whatever is left is split equally between them.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "They decided to share the profits equally, after each receives 8% interest on her investment." So the sequence is: first, each gets 8% interest on their own investment, and then the remaining profit is split equally.

So the total profit is $24,200. So first, subtract the interest.

Wait, no. Wait, the total profit is $24,200. Do they each take their 8% from their own investment, and then split the remaining profit equally?

Alternatively, maybe the total return is their investment plus 8% interest, and then the remaining is profit. But I think the problem is that the business earned $24,200 as profit, and from that, each gets 8% of their investment as interest, and the rest is split equally.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure it step by step.

1. Calculate each investor's interest:

- Susan's interest: 8% of $35,000 = 2,800
- Dolly's interest: 8% of $20,000 = 1,600
- Total interest: 2,800 + 1,600 = $4,400

2. Subtract the total interest from the total profit to get the remaining profit to split equally.

Total profit is $24,200. So 24,200 - 4,400 = $19,800.

3. Split the remaining $19,800 equally between the two investors.

Each gets 19,800 / 2 = $9,900.

4. Now, add each investor's interest to their share of the remaining profit.

- Susan gets 2,800 + 9,900 = $12,700
- Dolly gets 1,600 + 9,900 = $11,500

So Susan receives $12,700 and Dolly receives $11,500. Looking at the options, that's option D.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check another way.

Wait, perhaps the total amount they contribute is $55,000. 8% of that is 4,400, which is what I calculated. So the total interest is 4,400, leaving 19,800 to split equally. So each gets 9,900. So Susan's total is 2,800 + 9,900 = 12,700, and Dolly's is 1,600 +9,900=11,500. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option D is Susan:12,700 and Dolly:11,500. So the answer should be D.
