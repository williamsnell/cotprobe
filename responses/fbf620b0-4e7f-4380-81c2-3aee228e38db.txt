Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the enthalpy of vaporization (Δh_vap) of liquid oxygen. The given data is that oxygen boils at 90.15 K and has a vapor pressure of 2.5 atm at 100 K. The options are from A to J, all in cal/g-mol. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of vaporization can be found using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Let me think about how that works.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the change in vapor pressure with temperature to the enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is usually written as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) [1/T1 - 1/T2], where P is pressure, T is temperature, R is the gas constant, and ΔH_vap is the enthalpy of vaporization.

Wait, but wait. In this case, oxygen is boiling at 90.15 K, which means that at this temperature, the vapor pressure is 1 atm (standard boiling point). But the problem states that at 100 K, the vapor pressure is 2.5 atm. So, I think I can use these two points to find ΔH_vap.

Let me write down the values I have:
- At T1 = 90.15 K, P1 = 1 atm (since it's the boiling point)
- At T2 = 100 K, P2 = 2.5 atm

So I can plug these into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. But wait, I think I might have the signs mixed up. Since the pressure is increasing with temperature, and vapor pressure increases when temperature increases, I should make sure I'm plugging in the right values.

Let me rearrange the equation. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). Wait, no, actually, the correct form when using the natural log is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). So let me plug in the numbers.

First, calculate ln(P2/P1). P2 is 2.5 atm, P1 is 1 atm, so P2/P1 is 2.5. Ln(2.5) is approximately 0.9163.

Now, compute 1/T1 and 1/T2. T1 is 90.15 K, so 1/T1 ≈ 0.01109 K⁻¹. T2 is 100 K, so 1/T2 is 0.01. The difference is 0.01109 - 0.01 = 0.00109 K⁻¹.

Now, plug into the equation:
0.9163 = (ΔH_vap / R) * 0.00109

I need to solve for ΔH_vap. R is the gas constant. I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but wait, the problem uses cal as the unit. Oh right, 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J. So I should probably use R in cal units. Let me check: R = 8.314 J/mol·K is about 1.987 cal/mol·K because 1 cal = 4.184 J. So R ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, rearranging the equation:
ΔH_vap = (ln(P2/P1) * R) / (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, no, the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2). So solving for ΔH_vap:

ΔH_vap = [ln(P2/P1) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔH_vap = (0.9163 * 1.987) / 0.00109

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.9163 * 1.987 ≈ 1.820.

Denominator: 0.00109.

So ΔH_vap ≈ 1.820 / 0.00109 ≈ 1669.7 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait, the units given in the options are cal/g-mol. Oh, right, I think cal/g-mol is per gram-mole, so I might have missed converting from molar mass.

Wait, oxygen is O2, so its molar mass is 32 g/mol. So the ΔH_vap I calculated is per mole, so per gram, it's divided by 32 g/mol.

So per gram, it would be 1669.7 cal/mol / 32 g/mol ≈ 52.18 cal/g.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the options are in cal/g-mol, which might be a typo for cal/(g·mol). Alternatively, perhaps I got the units wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the question asks for Δh_vap in cal/g-mol, so that would be per gram per mole, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question meant cal/(mol), but the options are given in cal/g-mol, which is cal per gram per mole. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me re-express the calculation correctly.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of vaporization is usually given in cal/mol, but the problem options are in cal/g-mol. So perhaps the approach was correct, but I need to adjust for molar mass.

Wait, perhaps I should not have divided by the molar mass because the problem is using cal/g-mol. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in cal per gram-mole, so per gram per mole, which is the same as cal/(g·mol). Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation without converting R yet, using R in J units, and then convert the final answer to cal/g-mol.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use R = 8.314 J/mol·K and calculate in J, then convert to cal, then adjust for grams.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me start again.

The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Given:

ln(P2/P1) = ln(2.5/1) ≈ 0.9163

1/T1 = 1/90.15 ≈ 0.01109 K⁻¹

1/T2 = 1/100 = 0.01 K⁻¹

So, (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 0.01109 - 0.01 = 0.00109 K⁻¹

So,

ΔH_vap = [ln(P2/P1) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2) * [1/(molar mass)]

Wait, no, the molar mass comes into play only if we're converting per mole to per gram. So, perhaps I should compute ΔH_vap in J/mol first, then convert to cal/g.

Wait, so let's compute in J/mol first.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So,

ΔH_vap = (0.9163 * 8.314) / 0.00109 ≈ ?

Calculating numerator: 0.9163 * 8.314 ≈ 7.63.

Denominator: 0.00109.

So ΔH_vap ≈ 7.63 / 0.00109 ≈ 7000 J/mol.

Wait, 7000 J/mol is 7 kJ/mol. That seems low for enthalpy of vaporization. Wait, oxygen's enthalpy of vaporization is around 12.6 kJ/mol, but perhaps at higher temperatures? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recompute:

0.9163 * 8.314 = ?

0.9163 * 8 = 7.3304

0.9163 * 0.314 ≈ 0.287

So total ≈ 7.3304 + 0.287 ≈ 7.6174 J/mol·K * K⁻¹ = J/mol.

Wait, no, because (1/T1 -1/T2) is in 1/K, so when you multiply by R (J/mol·K), the K cancels, and you get J/mol.

So, 7.6174 J/mol divided by 0.00109 1/K would be 7.6174 / 0.00109 ≈ 7000 J/mol.

Hmm, that's 7 kJ/mol. But O2's ΔH_vap is more like 12.6 kJ/mol. So perhaps I messed up the equation.

Wait, wait, maybe I should have used the reciprocal. Let me check the equation again.

The correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, no, because when temperature increases, pressure should increase if ΔH_vap is positive. So, if T2 > T1, and P2 > P1, then (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive, so ln(P2/P1) should be positive, which it is.

So, the calculation seems correct. But why am I getting 7000 J/mol, which is about 7 kJ/mol, but O2's ΔH_vap is around 12.6 kJ/mol.

Wait, maybe the problem is using different units, or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the equation.

Another version of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the molar mass incorrectly when converting to cal/g-mol.

So, let me compute ΔH_vap in J/mol first, then convert to cal.

7000 J/mol = 7000 J/mol = 7000 / 4.184 ≈ 1672 cal/mol.

Now, to get cal/g-mol, we divide by the molar mass (32 g/mol):

1672 cal/mol / 32 g/mol = 52.25 cal/g·mol.

Wait, but the options are in cal/g-mol, which is cal/(g·mol), so I think that's correct. But looking at the options, the closest value is G: 1658 cal/g-mol. Wait, but wait, that's way lower than the options given. Wait, the options are in cal/g-mol, but I'm getting about 52 cal/g·mol, which isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong form of the equation. Another form is using the reciprocal, perhaps?

Wait, let me think again. The equation is for the change in pressure with temperature, so perhaps I should have used (1/T2 - 1/T1) instead.

Wait, let me see. Let me re-derive the equation.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is derived from dP/dT = (ΔH_vap / T) * (1/P). Integrating this between two points gives ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1). So I think the setup is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the temperatures. Let me try switching T1 and T2.

Wait, if I have T1=90.15 K and T2=100 K, with P1=1 atm and P2=2.5 atm.

So, ln(2.5/1) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/90.15 - 1/100) → which is what I did before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of (1/T1 - 1/T2), but that shouldn't change the result.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, no, because the denominator is (1/T1 - 1/T2), which is positive. Let me compute the denominator again.

1/90.15 ≈ 0.01109, 1/100=0.01 → 0.01109-0.01=0.00109.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used R=8.314 J/mol·K, but the correct value in cal is R=1.987 cal/mol·K. So let's try again with R in cal.

So, using R=1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, ln(2.5) ≈ 0.9163.

Then, (0.9163) = (ΔH_vap / 1.987) * (0.00109)

So, solving for ΔH_vap:

ΔH_vap = (0.9163 * 1.987) / 0.00109

Compute numerator: 0.9163 *1.987 ≈ 1.820.

Then 1.820 / 0.00109 ≈ 1669.7 cal/mol.

Now, molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol, so in cal/g·mol, it's 1669.7 / 32 ≈ 52.18 cal/g·mol.

Wait, but the options are in cal/g-mol, which is the same as cal/g·mol. So this would be approximately 52 cal/g·mol. But none of the options are close to this. The options are much higher, like 1400 to 2100.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my approach again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the data points are in the wrong order. Let me see: if the vapor pressure at 100 K is 2.5 atm, which is higher than at the boiling point of 90.15 K (1 atm). So the calculation should be correct, as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the equation. Let me try rearranging the equation differently.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (1/T2 - 1/T1) instead. Let me try that.

So, using (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 0.01 - 0.01109 = -0.00109.

Then, ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) → ln(2.5) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (-0.00109)

Wait, but that would give a negative value on the right side. But ln(2.5) is positive, so this would imply a negative ΔH_vap, which doesn't make sense. So no, that approach is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the equation incorrectly. Let me think again. The correct form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) because when T increases, P increases, so the equation should hold as is.

Wait, but maybe the data points are for the solid-liquid or liquid-gas transition. Wait, no, the problem states it's the vapor pressure of liquid oxygen, so it's the liquid-vapor transition.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Clapeyron equation, which is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap)/(T ΔV). But for an ideal gas, ΔV is approximately RT/P, so it simplifies to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the form that includes the reciprocal of temperatures correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used (1/T1 - 1/T2) as negative, but that would flip the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the negative of the equation. Let me try:

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH_vap/R) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, that would make the denominator (1/T2 -1/T1) negative, so:

ln(2.5) = -(ΔH_vap/R) * (0.01 - 0.01109) → 0.9163 = -(ΔH_vap/R) * (-0.00109) → 0.9163 = (ΔH_vap/R) * 0.00109

Which is the same as before, so no change.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try the numbers again.

Using R=1.987 cal/(mol·K):

ln(2.5) ≈ 0.9163.

1/T1 = 1/90.15 ≈ 0.01109 K⁻¹.

1/T2 = 0.01 K⁻¹.

Difference: 0.00109 K⁻¹.

So,

ΔH_vap = (0.9163 * 1.987) / 0.00109 ≈ ?

0.9163 * 1.987 ≈ 1.820.

1.820 / 0.00109 ≈ 1669.7 cal/mol.

Divide by molar mass 32 g/mol: 1669.7 /32 ≈ 52.18 cal/g·mol.

But the options don't have 52 cal/g·mol. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for the wrong phase change. Wait, no, liquid to vapor is vaporization, which is what we're looking for.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the pressure ratio. Let me try that.

Wait, if I do ln(P1/P2) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 -1/T2), then ln(1/2.5) = negative, which would give a negative ΔH_vap, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that at the boiling point, the vapor pressure is 1 atm, and use the Antoine equation or some other method. But I'm not sure about the Antoine constants for O2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law to find the volume and then compute the enthalpy change. But that seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is using the reciprocal of the pressure in the equation. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (P1/P2) instead of (P2/P1). Let me try that.

ln(P1/P2) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

So, ln(1/2.5) ≈ -0.9163 = (ΔH_vap/R) * 0.00109

So ΔH_vap = (-0.9163 * R) / 0.00109

Which would give a negative value, which doesn't make sense. So no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the equation in terms of (T2-T1) and (P2-P1), but I don't think that's correct. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation uses the reciprocal temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again, perhaps I made a mistake in the division.

Wait, 1.820 / 0.00109 → let me compute that accurately.

0.00109 goes into 1.820 how many times?

0.00109 * 1600 = 1.744

0.00109 * 1669 = approx 1.820 (since 1669 * 0.00109 = 1.820). So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, but the options are way higher. Let me think differently: perhaps the problem is using the molar mass as 32 g/mol, but perhaps the calculation is in cal per gram per mole, which is cal/(g·mol), which is the same as cal/g·mol.

Wait, but 52 cal/g·mol isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the equation should be rearranged differently.

Wait, another approach: the Clausius-Clapeyron equation can also be written as:

ΔH_vap = (R * ln(P2/P1)) / (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should use the absolute temperature in Kelvin correctly.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of (1/T1 - 1/T2) as the denominator.

Wait, no, that's what I did.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the standard enthalpy of vaporization for O2. I think it's around 12.6 kJ/mol. Let's check that.

12.6 kJ/mol is 12600 J/mol. Converting to cal: 12600 /4.184 ≈ 3005 cal/mol.

Divide by molar mass 32 g/mol: 3005 /32 ≈ 93.9 cal/g·mol.

Still not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Clapeyron equation differently, perhaps assuming that the enthalpy is constant over the temperature range, which I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the temperatures in the equation, but I think I did it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation using a calculator.

Compute 0.9163 * 1.987 = ?

0.9163 * 1.987:

0.9 *1.987 = 1.7883

0.0163 *1.987 ≈ 0.0323

Total ≈ 1.7883 +0.0323=1.8206.

Then divide by 0.00109:

1.8206 /0.00109 = approximately 1669.7 cal/mol.

Divide by molar mass 32 g/mol: 1669.7 /32 ≈ 52.18 cal/g·mol.

Hmm, but none of the options match. The options start at 1200 cal/g·mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me check the correct form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

The correct equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the pressure ratio? No, that would give a negative, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of vaporization at the boiling point, and using the data points to estimate it, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the data is at the boiling point, but the pressure is given at a higher temperature.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the Antoine equation to estimate the enthalpy of vaporization. The Antoine equation is:

log P = A - (B / T) + (C / T^2)

But without knowing the constants for O2, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that at the boiling point, the vapor pressure is 1 atm. So at 90.15 K, P=1 atm. At 100 K, P=2.5 atm. So the equation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I'm using cal/g·mol instead of cal/mol. Let me see: if I don't divide by molar mass, ΔH_vap is 1669.7 cal/mol. Looking at the options, the closest is E:1500 cal/g-mol, but that's per gram. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal/mol, but the options are given in cal/g·mol, which is per gram-mole.

Wait, perhaps the options are in cal/(g·mol), which is cal per gram per mole, but that's not a standard unit. Typically, it's cal/mol or cal/g.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the molar mass correction, but I'm getting a value way lower than the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the reciprocal of the pressure ratio, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the temperatures, but that was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

0.9163 * 1.987 = 1.820

1.820 /0.00109 = approx 1669.7 cal/mol.

Divided by 32 g/mol: 52.18 cal/g·mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the pressures in the equation. Let me try that.

So, ln(P1/P2) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T1 -1/T2)

ln(1/2.5) = -0.9163 = (ΔH_vap/R)(0.00109)

So,

ΔH_vap = (-0.9163 * R) /0.00109 → negative value, which isn't possible.

So no, that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm stuck. All calculations point to about 52 cal/g·mol, but the options are much higher. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law to find the volume of the gas and then calculate work done, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the enthalpy change per gram, not per mole. So perhaps I should compute per gram from the start.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molar mass as 32 g/mol and the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the equation. Let me try.

Wait, perhaps the equation is written as ln(P1/P2) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T2 -1/T1).

So, ln(1/2.5) = (ΔH_vap/R)(-0.00109)

So,

-0.9163 = (ΔH_vap/R) (-0.00109)

Which gives:

ΔH_vap = (-0.9163 * R) / (-0.00109) → positive.

So,

ΔH_vap = (0.9163 *1.987) /0.00109 → same as before, 1669.7 cal/mol.

Divide by 32 g/mol: 52.18 cal/g·mol.

Still the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the pressure ratio, but I don't see how that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Clapeyron equation in a different form, such as using the inverse of the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I should use the equation as:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T2 -1/T1)

Wait, but that would give a negative denominator, which would result in a negative ΔH_vap, which is impossible.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the correct answer in the options and see which one aligns with the known value.

Wait, I know that the standard enthalpy of vaporization of O2 is about 12.6 kJ/mol, which is approximately 3005 cal/mol. Divided by 32 g/mol, that's about 93.9 cal/g·mol. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different R value. Let me try using R=8.314 J/mol·K and compute in J, then convert.

So,

ΔH_vap = (0.9163 *8.314) / 0.00109 → 0.9163 *8.314 ≈7.63.

7.63 /0.00109 ≈7000 J/mol → 7 kJ/mol.

Convert to cal: 7000 J/mol * (1 cal/4.184 J) ≈ 1672 cal/mol.

Divide by 32 g/mol: 52.25 cal/g·mol.

Same result as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to not divide by the molar mass, giving 1672 cal/mol, which is about 1670 cal/mol. Looking at the options, G is 1658 cal/g·mol. Wait, but that's per gram. Wait, no, it's per gram-mole, which is the same as per gram per mole, which is the same as per gram per mole. Wait, but 1672 cal/mol is 1672 cal per mole, which is 1672 cal/(32 g) → 52 cal/g·mol. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal/mol, not per gram. So 1672 cal/mol would be approximately 1670 cal/mol, which is close to option G:1658 cal/g·mol. Wait, no, option G is 1658 cal/g·mol, which is per gram per mole.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer is around 52 cal/g·mol, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the equation.

Wait, perhaps the equation should be multiplied by (T2-T1) instead. Let me try that.

Wait, no, the correct form is with the reciprocal temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I should use the average temperature. Let me try using the average T.

Average T = (90.15 +100)/2 ≈95.075 K.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the average temperature.

Wait, but I don't think that's the right approach.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should choose the closest option, but none match. Alternatively, maybe I should recheck all steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the pressure ratio in the equation, but that would give a negative ΔH_vap, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used (T2-T1) in the equation, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the change in pressure and temperature and use the equation in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the Clapeyron equation for the solid-liquid transition, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the Clapeyron equation in terms of Kelvin degrees instead of reciprocal, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the change in pressure per Kelvin and then find ΔH_vap.

The pressure increases from 1 atm to 2.5 atm over a temperature increase of 9.85 K (100-90.15).

So, ΔP/ΔT = (2.5 -1)/(100-90.15) = 1.5 /9.85 ≈0.1523 atm/K.

The Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap)/(T ΔV).

Assuming ΔV ≈ RT/P, for an ideal gas.

At T=90.15 K and P=1 atm,

ΔV ≈ R*T/P = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) *90.15 K /1 atm ≈7.396 L/mol.

So,

dP/dT ≈ ΔH_vap / (T * ΔV)

So,

ΔH_vap = dP/dT * T * ΔV

dP/dT is 0.1523 atm/K.

T=90.15 K.

ΔV=7.396 L/mol.

So,

ΔH_vap = 0.1523 *90.15 *7.396 ≈ ?

Compute step by step:

0.1523 *90.15 ≈13.72.

13.72 *7.396 ≈101.5 L·atm/mol.

Now, convert L·atm to cal: 1 L·atm ≈24.71 cal.

So,

ΔH_vap ≈101.5 *24.71 ≈2516 cal/mol.

Divide by molar mass 32 g/mol: 2516/32 ≈78.63 cal/g·mol.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the average ΔV between 90.15 K and 100 K. Let me compute ΔV at 100 K and average it.

At 100 K, P=2.5 atm.

ΔV = R*T/P =0.0821 *100 /2.5 ≈3.284 L/mol.

Average ΔV between 90.15 and 100 K: (7.396 +3.284)/2 ≈5.34 L/mol.

Then,

ΔH_vap = dP/dT * T_avg * ΔV_avg.

T_avg=(90.15+100)/2≈95.075 K.

dP/dT=0.1523 atm/K.

So,

ΔH_vap=0.1523 *95.075 *5.34 ≈?

0.1523 *95.075 ≈14.47.

14.47 *5.34 ≈77.36 L·atm/mol.

Convert to cal: 77.36 *24.71 ≈1908 cal/mol.

Divide by 32 g/mol: 1908/32≈59.63 cal/g·mol.

Still not matching options.

Hmm, I'm clearly missing something here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the enthalpy of vaporization at the boiling point, using the given vapor pressure at 100 K and the boiling point at 90.15 K.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Antoine equation to find the enthalpy of vaporization. The Antoine equation is:

log P = A - (B / T) + (C / T^2)

But without knowing the constants for O2, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given data with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the equation in terms of Kelvin without converting to reciprocal.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem expects me to use the reciprocal of the pressure ratio in the equation. Let me try.

So,

ln(1/2.5) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/90.15 -1/100)

ln(0.4)≈-0.9163 = (ΔH_vap/R) *0.00109.

So,

ΔH_vap = (-0.9163 * R)/0.00109 → negative, which can't be right.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with the calculation I did earlier and see if any option is close, but none are. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass.

Wait, O2 is 32 g/mol, right? O is 16, so O2 is 32.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use R=8.314 J/mol·K and calculate in J/mol, then convert to cal/(g·mol).

So,

ΔH_vap= (0.9163 *8.314)/0.00109 ≈7000 J/mol →7000 J/mol=7000 cal/mol (since 1 J=0.239 cal). Wait, no, 1 cal=4.184 J, so 7000 J = 7000 /4.184 ≈1672 cal.

So, 1672 cal/mol →1672 /32=52.25 cal/g·mol.

Hmm, again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the options are in cal/mol, not per gram. So 1672 cal/mol would be close to option G:1658 cal/g·mol. Wait, no, option G is 1658 cal/g·mol, which is per gram per mole, which is 1658 cal/(g·mol), which is 52 cal/g·mol if divided by 32 g/mol. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the options are in cal/mol, and G is 1658 cal/mol. But the calculation gives 1672 cal/mol, which would be close to option G:1658 cal/mol. But option G is labeled as cal/g·mol, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to not divide by the molar mass, giving 1672 cal/mol, which is approximately 1658 cal/mol when considering rounding. So option G:1658 cal/g·mol would be the answer, but I'm not sure about the units.

Wait, the options are:

G: 1658 cal/g-mol

So, perhaps the correct answer is G.
</think>

To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) of liquid oxygen, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation was used:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm} \) (at boiling point \( T_1 = 90.15 \, \text{K} \))
- \( P_2 = 2.5 \, \text{atm} \) (at \( T_2 = 100 \, \text{K} \))
- \( R = 1.987 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \(\ln(P_2/P_1)\)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2.5}{1}\right) \approx 0.9163
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\)
\[
\frac{1}{90.15} - \frac{1}{100} \approx 0.01109 - 0.01 = 0.00109 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}}\)
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{\ln(P_2/P_1) \cdot R}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}}
\]
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{0.9163 \cdot 1.987}{0.00109} \approx 1669.7 \, \text{cal/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Convert to \(\text{cal/(g·mol)}\)
The molar mass of \( \text{O}_2 \) is \( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \):
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{1669.7}{32} \approx 52.25 \, \text{cal/(g·mol)}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated value of \( 52.25 \, \text{cal/(g·mol)} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem intended the answer in \(\text{cal/mol}\) instead of \(\text{cal/(g·mol)}\), the value \( 1669.7 \, \text{cal/mol} \) is close to option **G: 1658 cal/g·mol**. This discrepancy suggests a possible issue with the units in the problem or the options.

### Final Answer:
Based on the calculations and the closest matching option, the answer is:

**G: 1658 cal/g·mol**

Answer: G
