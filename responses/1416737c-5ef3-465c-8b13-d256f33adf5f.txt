Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of a tennis ball. Hmm, let me think. I remember the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. The formula is lambda equals h over p, right? Where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum.

Alright, the problem gives me the mass of the tennis ball as 57 grams. Wait, I need to convert that into kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms. So 57 grams is 0.057 kilograms. Got it.

The velocity is given as 25 m/s. So momentum p is mass times velocity, which would be 0.057 kg multiplied by 25 m/s. Let me do that calculation: 0.057 times 25. Let's see, 0.057 * 20 is 1.14, and 0.057 *5 is 0.285, so adding those gives 1.425 kg·m/s. So p is 1.425.

Now, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So plugging into the formula, lambda equals 6.626e-34 divided by 1.425. Let me compute that division.

Calculating 6.626e-34 / 1.425. Hmm, let's see. 6.626 divided by 1.425 is approximately 4.65 (since 1.425 * 4.65 ≈ 6.626). So 4.65 times 10^-34 meters. Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the division again.

Wait, 1.425 * 4 is 5.7, and 1.425 *4.6 is around 6.5655. Because 1.425 *4.6: 1.425*4=5.7, 1.425*0.6=0.855, so total 6.555. But 6.626 is a bit higher. So 4.65 might be accurate enough. So lambda is approximately 4.65e-34 meters.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.7e-34. That must be the correct answer. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Mass was 57g → 0.057 kg. Velocity 25 m/s. Momentum p=0.057 *25=1.425 kg·m/s. Planck's constant 6.626e-34. Dividing gives about 4.65e-34, which rounds to 4.7e-34. So yes, option G is correct.

The de Broglie wavelength is calculated using the formula λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) and p is the momentum of the object. The momentum p is given by p = m·v, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity. 

Given:
- Mass of the tennis ball, m = 57 g = 0.057 kg
- Velocity, v = 25 m/s

First, calculate the momentum:
p = m·v = 0.057 kg × 25 m/s = 1.425 kg·m/s

Next, calculate the de Broglie wavelength:
λ = h / p = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / 1.425 kg·m/s ≈ 4.65 × 10⁻³⁴ m

Rounding to two significant figures, λ ≈ 4.7 × 10⁻³⁴ m. 

The correct answer is G: 4.7e-34.
