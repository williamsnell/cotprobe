Okay, so I have to find the determinant of matrix A, which is a 3x3 matrix. The matrix is:

A = [[2, 4, 3],
     [3, 3, 1],
     [42, 20, 51]]

Hmm, I remember that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the general method with expansion by minors. I think I'll go with the expansion by minors because it feels more straightforward for me right now.

The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix is:

det(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[ a  b  c ]
[ d  e  f ]
[ g  h  i ]

So, mapping the elements of matrix A to this formula:

a=2, b=4, c=3,
d=3, e=3, f=1,
g=42, h=20, i=51.

Now plugging into the formula:

det(A) = 2*(3*51 - 1*20) - 4*(3*51 - 1*42) + 3*(3*20 - 3*42)

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First part: 2*(3*51 - 1*20)
3*51 is 153, and 1*20 is 20. So 153-20=133. Then multiply by 2: 2*133=266.

Second part: -4*(3*51 - 1*42)
3*51 is 153, 1*42 is 42. 153-42=111. Multiply by -4: -4*111= -444.

Third part: 3*(3*20 - 3*42)
3*20 is 60, 3*42 is 126. 60-126= -66. Multiply by 3: 3*(-66)= -198.

Now add all three parts together:

266 - 444 -198.

Let's compute step by step.

266 - 444 = -178.

Then -178 -198 = -376.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the signs because sometimes I get confused with the signs in the formula. The formula is a(ei-fh) - b(di-fg) + c(dh-eg). So the signs are correct: first positive, second negative, third positive.

Wait, in the third part, I had 3*(3*20 -3*42) = 3*(60-126) = 3*(-66)= -198. That's correct.

So adding 266 -444 is indeed -178, then -178 -198 is -376.

Looking at the options, H is -376. So the answer should be H.

The determinant is calculated as -376.

Answer: H
