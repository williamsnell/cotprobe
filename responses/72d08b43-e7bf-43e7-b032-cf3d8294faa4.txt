Okay, so I need to figure out how much the household would demand in loan contracts given the information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the household earns an income of $30,000 per year. They decide to save 10% of that income. So, I'll calculate 10% of $30,000. That's 0.10 * 30,000, which equals $3,000. So, they're saving $3,000 each year.

Next, they add three quarters of their savings to their cash balances. So, three quarters of $3,000 is (3/4) * 3,000. Let me compute that: 3,000 divided by 4 is 750, and 750 times 3 is $2,250. So, they're adding $2,250 to their cash balances.

Wait a minute, but what about the other quarter of their savings? Since they save $3,000, the remaining quarter would be 3,000 / 4 = $750. So, that $750 is probably what they're not adding to cash balances. But I'm trying to find out the loan contracts they demand.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The household's income is $30k, they save 10%, which is $3k. Then, they take 3/4 of that saving and add it to cash balances. So, the cash balance addition is $2,250. But what happens to the remaining $750? Do they use that for loans?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the amount they need to borrow. If they're saving $3k, and they're adding $2,250 to cash, maybe the rest is used for something else, like paying off existing debt or other expenses. But I'm not sure if that's directly related to the loan contracts they demand.

Wait, maybe I should consider the household's need for loans. If they're saving 10% of their income, they might be using some of that saved money for other things, but the question is about the loan contracts they demand. Perhaps the amount they can't cover from their savings is what they borrow.

But the way the question is phrased, it says they add three quarters of their saving to cash balances. So, the saving is $3k; 3/4 is $2,250 goes into cash. But what's the purpose of that? Maybe they're building up cash reserves, so how does that relate to taking loans?

Alternatively, perhaps the loan contracts they demand are related to the portion of their income not saved. Let me check that. If they save 10%, they spend 90%, which is $27,000. But why would they need a loan for that? Unless they are smoothing consumption or investing.

Wait, perhaps the question is about their desired savings and how much they need to borrow to finance their spending. So, if they save $3k, maybe they are using that to invest or for future expenses, but the rest is covered by their current income. Or perhaps the opposite: they need to borrow because their income isn't enough for their desired spending.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach. The question is asking for the value of the loan contracts demanded. So, it's about how much they need to borrow. If they save 10% of their income, that's $3k. But they add three quarters of that saving to cash balances, which is $2,250. So, their cash balance increases by $2,250. But what does that have to do with loans?

Alternatively, perhaps the household's total desired savings is $3k, but they only add 3/4 of it to cash, so the remaining $750 is used for loans. But that seems a bit off because why would they use part of their savings for loans?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the difference between savings and the amount they can hold as cash. If they save $3k and put $2,250 into cash, perhaps the rest is invested or used for other purposes, but the question is about loans. So, maybe the amount they can't save in cash is what they have to borrow.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. If they save 10%, that's $3k. They add 3/4 of that to cash, which is $2,250. So, the amount they are adding to cash is $2,250. But why is that relevant to the loan contracts? Maybe they're using their savings to add to their cash balances, and the rest is used for loans. So, the $750 not added to cash is what they borrow.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the loan contracts are determined by their desired savings that they can't hold in cash. So, if they save $3k and can only hold $2,250 in cash, then the remaining $750 is the amount they need to borrow. So, the loan contracts would be $750.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is $750. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is about how much they are saving and adding to cash, and the rest is their demand for loans.

Let me think differently. Suppose the household's income is $30k. They save 10%, which is $3k. Then, they take 3/4 of that saving to add to cash. So, they add $2,250 to cash. Now, the remaining saving is $750, which they might use for other things, but perhaps that's not related to loans.

Wait, but maybe the question is about the amount they need to borrow to finance their spending. If their income is $30k, and they save $3k, their spending is $27k. But if they add $2,250 to cash, perhaps they are using that to meet their spending, so they don't need to borrow as much.

Alternatively, perhaps the loan demand is the amount they need to smooth consumption. If they have fluctuating income, they might borrow when income is low and save when it's high, but in this case, their income is fixed at $30k.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to rephrase the question. The household saves 10% of $30k, which is $3k. They add 3/4 of their savings to cash, which is $2,250. So, the question is, how much do they demand in loan contracts?

Wait, perhaps the loan contracts are the amount they need to cover their spending beyond what they can save. Or maybe the opposite: the amount they can save is added to cash, and the rest is used for loans.

Wait, maybe the household's desired saving is $3k, but they can only hold $2,250 in cash, so they need to borrow the remaining $750. So, the loan contracts would be $750, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. They save 10%, which is $3k, and add 3/4 to cash, so that's $2,250. So, the amount they are adding to cash is $2,250, and that's the loan? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the question is about the amount they need to borrow to add to their cash balances. So, if they save $3k, and then add 3/4 of that saving to cash, which is $2,250, perhaps that $2,250 is the amount they borrow. But that seems off because saving and borrowing are opposite actions.

Alternatively, perhaps the household's income is $30k, and they decide to save $3k, so their available funds are $27k. They add 3/4 of their saving ($2,250) to cash, so their total cash is $2,250. But why would they borrow then? Unless they need to finance something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of what the question is asking: the value of loan contracts demanded. So, the household wants to take loans of a certain amount. How is this amount determined?

If they save 10%, which is $3k, and then add 3/4 of that saving to cash, they have $2,250 in cash. But why would they take a loan? Maybe because their current income isn't enough, and they need to borrow to meet their spending or investment needs.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the amount they are willing to lend, but the question says "loan contracts it demanded," so they are the borrowers.

Wait, perhaps the household's desired savings is $3k, but they can only hold $2,250 in cash, so the remaining $750 is the amount they need to borrow. So, the loan contracts would be $750, which is option I.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the loan amount is the total saving, $3k, but that's not matching the options. Or maybe it's the amount they add to cash, $2,250, but that's option B.

Wait, another angle: If they save $3k, and add 3/4 to cash, then the amount in cash increases by $2,250. But how does that relate to loans? Maybe they are using their savings to add to cash, but the question is about how much they need to borrow. Maybe they don't need to borrow because they have enough savings, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the household's total wealth is their income plus savings. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the amount they have to borrow to finance their consumption or investment. If they save 10%, they have $3k saved, but they add 3/4 to cash, so $2,250. Maybe the rest is used for loans. So, $3k saved, $2,250 in cash, so $750 is the amount they can use for loans. So, the loan contracts would be $750, option I.

But another thought: If the household's income is $30k, and they save 10%, which is $3k. Then, they decide to allocate 3/4 of that saving to cash, which is $2,250. So, the rest of their saving, $750, is perhaps used for other things, like paying off debts or investing elsewhere. But the question is about loan contracts they demand, so maybe they need to borrow an amount equal to the saving they are not adding to cash, which is $750.

Alternatively, perhaps the loan contracts are the amount they want to borrow beyond their savings. So, if they save $3k, they might borrow more, but the question doesn't specify that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the amount they add to cash is $2,250, which is 3/4 of their savings. So, the total savings are $3k, and the cash added is $2,250. So, the loan demand would be the remaining saving, which is $750. So, the answer is I: $750.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the loan amount is the total savings, $3k, but that's not an option. Wait, option A is $3k, but that's the total savings. But the question is about the loan contracts, so maybe they don't need to borrow anything because they have enough savings.

No, that doesn't make sense. The question is asking what's the value of the loan contracts they demand. So, perhaps they are borrowing an amount based on their saving. If they save 10%, and add 3/4 to cash, perhaps the amount they can borrow is the amount they have in cash. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe the loan contracts are the amount they need to borrow to cover their spending. If their income is $30k, and they save 10%, their spending is $27k. But if they add 3/4 of their saving to cash, that's $2,250 in cash. So, maybe they need to borrow $27k minus the $2,250, which is $24,750. But that's not an option.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are much lower. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the loan contracts are the amount they add to cash, which is $2,250, so option B. But why would they demand a loan for that?

Wait, perhaps the question is about their desired savings and how much they want to hold as cash versus borrow. If they save $3k and decide to hold $2,250 as cash, then the remaining $750 is the amount they need to borrow. So, the loan contracts would be $750, option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler: they save 10%, which is $3k, and 3/4 of that is $2,250, so the loan is $2,250. So, option B.

Wait, but why would the loan be 3/4 of their savings? That doesn't seem to make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the household's cash balance is $2,250, so the loan is that amount. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to structure it:

- Income: $30,000
- Savings: 10% of income = $3,000
- Cash added: 3/4 of savings = $2,250
- So, the remaining saving is $750.

But what does that mean for loans? If the household wants to save $3k but can only hold $2,250 in cash, perhaps they need to borrow the remaining $750. So, the loan contracts would be $750, which is option I.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the loan is the amount they are adding to cash, so $2,250, option B. But I'm not sure why they'd borrow that amount.

Wait, another approach: In economics, the demand for loans is often related to the desire to smooth consumption or invest. If the household saves $3k and adds $2,250 to cash, perhaps they are using that cash for loans. But that doesn't make sense because saving and borrowing are opposite actions.

Alternatively, maybe the household's desired loan amount is based on their savings. If they save $3k, they might borrow an amount that complements their savings. But without more context, it's hard to say.

I think the most plausible answer is that they add $2,250 to cash, which is 3/4 of their savings, so the loan would be the remaining $750. So, the answer is I: $750.
</think>

The household earns an income of $30,000 per year and saves 10% of it, which amounts to $3,000. Out of this saving, three quarters ($2,250) is added to cash balances. The remaining quarter of the savings ($750) is the amount the household would demand as loan contracts. Therefore, the value of the loan contracts is $750.
