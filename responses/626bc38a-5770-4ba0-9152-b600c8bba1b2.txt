Question:

Based on the morphology of fossil hominids dating from about 1.8 million until about 400,000 years ago, researchers argue that:

Options:

A: There is no evidence of separate hominid species during this period
B: hominids dating from this time can be grouped into different species in Africa, Asia, and Europe.
C: The hominids from this period are not related to Homo sapiens
D: There were two or more unrelated and geographically widespread hominid species during this period.
E: Hominids during this period evolved from earlier Asian hominids, not African
F: All hominids during this period can be grouped into a single species known as Homo habilis
G: Only one single hominid species existed during this period and evolved into Homo sapiens
H: there were two or more related but geographically separate hominid species during this period that evolved from earlier African hominids
I: all of the above

Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the morphology of fossil hominids from about 1.8 million to 400,000 years ago. The question is asking what researchers argue based on their fossils' morphology. Let me break it down.

First, I need to recall what I know about hominid evolution during that time. From what I remember, the period from about 2 million years ago until around 300,000 years ago is a time when several hominid species coexisted. I think during that time, there were species like Homo habilis, Homo erectus, and possibly others like Homo rudolfensis or Paranthropus species.

Looking at the options:

Option A says there's no evidence of separate species. That doesn't sound right because I remember that paleontologists have identified multiple species from that period.

Option B suggests that hominids can be grouped into different species in Africa, Asia, and Europe. I think that's true. For example, Homo erectus is found in Asia and Africa, while other species like Homo neanderthalensis appeared in Europe. So this seems plausible.

Option C claims these hominids aren't related to Homo sapiens. But I know that Homo sapiens evolved from earlier hominids, so this is probably incorrect.

Option D says there were two or more unrelated and widespread species. Unrelated doesn't make sense because they all evolved from earlier hominids, so they're related. So D might not be right.

Option E suggests they evolved from Asian hominids, but I think the evidence points more towards African origins for many species, like Homo habilis and Homo erectus.

Option F says all hominids can be grouped into Homo habilis. That's not correct because there were multiple species, not just habilis.

Option G claims only one species existed, leading to Homo sapiens. Again, multiple species existed, so G is likely wrong.

Option H states there were two or more related but geographically separate species that evolved from African hominids. This makes sense because several species evolved in Africa and later spread to other regions. For example, Homo erectus moved out of Africa, and others like Homo neanderthalensis in Europe came from earlier African migrants.

Option I is "all of the above," which can't be right because not all options are correct.

So, based on this, the best answer is H. It correctly identifies that there were multiple related species that originated in Africa and then spread geographically.

The question asks about the argument researchers make based on the morphology of fossil hominids from 1.8 million to 400,000 years ago. After analyzing the options, the correct answer is H, which aligns with the understanding that multiple related species evolved from African origins and spread geographically.

Answer: H
