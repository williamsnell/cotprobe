Question:

Describe the function of the sea star's stomach as the animal feeds upon a clam.

Options:

A: The sea star's stomach remains inside its body and absorbs nutrients directly from the water as the clam is digested externally.
B: The sea star's stomach is used to capture prey by extending out and enveloping the entire clam.
C: The sea star's stomach acts as a pump to forcefully open the clam's shell before ingestion.
D: The sea star's stomach is used to filter out unwanted particles from the food.
E: The sea star's stomach is used to grind the clam's shell into digestible pieces.
F: The sea star's stomach produces light to distract the clam while other sea stars feed on it.
G: The sea star's stomach secretes a strong acid to dissolve the clam's shell completely before ingestion.
H: The sea star's stomach releases electrical charges to stun the clam before feeding.
I: The sea star's stomach is used to store food for later consumption.
J: The sea star's stomach is everted, enters the clam's shell, releases digestive enzymes to degrade the clam's body, and then retracts after eating.

Okay, so I need to figure out the function of a sea star's stomach when it's feeding on a clam. I remember that sea stars, also known as starfish, have a unique way of eating. They don't have a typical mouth like other animals. Instead, I think they use their stomachs in a specific way.

From what I've heard before, sea stars can actually extend their stomachs out of their bodies. They don't have teeth, so they can't really chew their food. Instead, when they come across something like a clam, which is a bivalve, they must have a special method to get through the shell.

I think the process involves the sea star attaching itself to the clam's shell. Then, using its strong arms, it prys the shell open. Once the shell is open just a little, the sea star's stomach, which is called a stomach or sometimes referred to as the cardiac stomach, actually comes out of its body. This stomach goes into the clam's shell to digest the soft parts inside without having to break the shell completely.

So looking at the options: Option J says the stomach is everted, enters the clam's shell, releases digestive enzymes, and then retracts after eating. That sounds right. The other options don't fit because, for example, option A says the stomach absorbs nutrients from water while digesting externally, which I don't think is accurate. Option C talks about pumping to open the shell, which is more about the arms and the way the sea star forces the shell open, not the stomach's role. Option E mentions grinding the shell, but the stomach doesn't physically grind; it uses enzymes.

Therefore, the correct answer should be J because it accurately describes the eversion of the stomach into the prey, digestion with enzymes, and then retracting after feeding.

The correct answer is J because the sea star's stomach is everted into the clam's shell, releases digestive enzymes to break down the prey, and then retracts after feeding.
