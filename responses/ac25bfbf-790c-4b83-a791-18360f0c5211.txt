Okay, so I have this question about a fallacy someone might commit when responding sarcastically. The statement given is, "Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen." I need to figure out which fallacy this is from the options A to J.

First, I should recall what each fallacy means. Let's go through the options one by one.

A: tu quoque – This is the "you too" fallacy, where someone accuses the other of the same mistake. Like, "You're just as bad as me." So it's about deflecting by attacking back.

B: appeal to ignorance – This is when someone argues that a claim is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Like, "No one has proven aliens don't exist, so they must exist."

C: argumentum ad populum – This is appealing to popularity. "Most people think this way, so it must be right."

D: false cause – This is when someone assumes that because two things happen together, one causes the other. Like, "Every time I walk under a ladder, something bad happens, so walking under a ladder causes bad luck."

E: appeal to indignation – This is playing on emotions, especially anger or resentment, to win an argument. Like, "How dare you say that about my country!"

F: appeal to spite – This is when someone argues based on how something makes them feel, especially if it's spiteful. Like, "I don't care what you say; I'll do whatever it takes to make you look bad."

G: horse laugh – I think this is when someone reacts with obvious derision or laughter, implying the argument is so silly it's laughable. Like, "That's the best argument you can come up with?"

H: slippery slope – This is the idea that one small step will lead to a chain of negative events. "If we let them do this, eventually they'll take over everything."

I: straw man fallacy – This is when someone misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. Like, "You think we should never help the poor, but that's not possible because..."

J: argumentum ad hominem – This is attacking the person instead of the argument. Like, "You're just saying that because you're biased."

Now, the statement in question is a sarcastic response, "Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen." It sounds like the person is mocking the idea as if it's ridiculous or impossible. They're not directly attacking the person, so it's not ad hominem. It's more about dismissing the argument with mockery.

Looking at the options, G is horse laugh, which fits because it's a reaction that belittles the argument. Alternatively, I might consider if it's a straw man, but straw man involves misrepresentation, which isn't exactly happening here. The sarcastic remark is more of a dismissive response rather than a misrepresentation.

So, the correct fallacy here is likely horse laugh, which is option G.

The sarcastic response "Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen" is a dismissive reaction that mocks the argument as if it's absurd. This fits the definition of horse laugh (G), where the response belittles the argument through derision rather than addressing it logically.

Answer: G
