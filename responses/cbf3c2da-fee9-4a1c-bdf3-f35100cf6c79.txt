Okay, so I have this probability distribution problem here, and I need to find the expected value (E(X)) and the variance (Var(X)) of the random variable X. Let me try to remember how to do this step by step.

First, the table gives me the possible values of X and their corresponding probabilities. The values are x_i: 0, 1, 2, 3 and their probabilities are 8/27, 12/27, 6/27, and 1/27 respectively. 

I think the expected value is calculated by multiplying each x_i by its probability and then summing all those products. So, E(X) = sum(x_i * Pr(X = x_i)). Let me compute each term one by one.

For x=0: 0 * (8/27) = 0.
For x=1: 1 * (12/27) = 12/27.
For x=2: 2 * (6/27) = 12/27.
For x=3: 3 * (1/27) = 3/27.

Now, add them up: 0 + 12/27 + 12/27 + 3/27. Let me calculate that. 12+12 is 24, plus 3 is 27. So total is 27/27, which is 1. Wait, that can't be right because adding 12+12+3 gives 27, so 27/27 is 1. So E(X) is 1? But wait, looking at the options, option D says E(X)=1 and Var(X)=2/3. Is that correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Let me compute each term again:

x=0: 0 * 8/27 = 0.

x=1: 1 * 12/27 = 12/27 ≈ 0.444.

x=2: 2 * 6/27 = 12/27 ≈ 0.444.

x=3: 3 * 1/27 = 3/27 ≈ 0.111.

Adding them: 0 + 0.444 + 0.444 + 0.111 = 0.999, which is approximately 1. So E(X)=1. Hmm, that matches option D.

Wait, but let me check again because sometimes adding fractions can be tricky. Let me express all terms with denominator 27:

E(X) = 0 + 12/27 + 24/27 + 3/27 = (0 +12 +24 +3)/27 = 39/27. Wait, that's not right because 12+24 is 36, plus 3 is 39. 39 divided by 27 is 13/9, which is approximately 1.444. Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Wait, what's wrong here.

Wait a second, I think I confused the terms. Let me recalculate each term correctly.

For x=0: 0 * 8/27 = 0.

For x=1: 1 * 12/27 = 12/27.

For x=2: 2 * 6/27 = 12/27.

For x=3: 3 * 1/27 = 3/27.

So sum is 0 + 12/27 + 12/27 + 3/27 = (12+12+3)/27 = 27/27 = 1. So E(X)=1. So earlier calculation was correct, so why did I get 39/27 when I thought I added 12+24+3? Oh, wait, no, I think I messed up when I thought about 2*6/27. 2 times 6 is 12, so 12/27, not 24. So yes, 12+12+3=27, so E(X)=1.

Wait, but in my second calculation I thought of 2*6=12, which is correct. So E(X)=1.

Now, moving on to the variance. Var(X) is E(X²) - [E(X)]².

So first, I need to compute E(X²), which is sum(x_i² * Pr(X=x_i)).

Let me compute each term:

x=0: 0² * 8/27 = 0.

x=1: 1² * 12/27 = 12/27.

x=2: 2² * 6/27 = 4 * 6/27 = 24/27.

x=3: 3² * 1/27 = 9 * 1/27 = 9/27.

Now sum these up: 0 + 12/27 + 24/27 + 9/27.

Adding numerators: 12 +24=36, +9=45. So 45/27 = 5/3 ≈1.6667.

So E(X²)=5/3.

Now, Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = (5/3) - (1)^2 = 5/3 -1 = 2/3.

So Var(X)=2/3.

Looking at the options, option D says E(X)=1 and Var(X)=2/3. That matches.

Wait, but let me just check if I did E(X²) correctly.

x=0: 0*8/27=0.

x=1: 1*12/27=12/27.

x=2: 4*6/27=24/27.

x=3:9*1/27=9/27.

Sum: 0 +12+24+9 =45 over 27. 45/27=5/3. Yes, that's correct.

So E(X)=1, Var(X)=2/3. So the answer should be option D.

The expected value \( E(X) \) is calculated by summing the products of each \( x_i \) and its probability. Each term is computed as follows:

- \( 0 \times \frac{8}{27} = 0 \)
- \( 1 \times \frac{12}{27} = \frac{12}{27} \)
- \( 2 \times \frac{6}{27} = \frac{12}{27} \)
- \( 3 \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{3}{27} \)

Adding these gives \( 0 + \frac{12}{27} + \frac{12}{27} + \frac{3}{27} = \frac{27}{27} = 1 \), so \( E(X) = 1 \).

Next, the variance \( Var(X) \) is computed using \( Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \). First, calculate \( E(X^2) \):

- \( 0^2 \times \frac{8}{27} = 0 \)
- \( 1^2 \times \frac{12}{27} = \frac{12}{27} \)
- \( 2^2 \times \frac{6}{27} = \frac{24}{27} \)
- \( 3^2 \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{9}{27} \)

Summing these gives \( 0 + \frac{12}{27} + \frac{24}{27} + \frac{9}{27} = \frac{45}{27} = \frac{5}{3} \). Thus, \( E(X^2) = \frac{5}{3} \).

Finally, \( Var(X) = \frac{5}{3} - (1)^2 = \frac{5}{3} - 1 = \frac{2}{3} \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: \( E(X) = 1 \), \( Var(X) = \frac{2}{3} \).
