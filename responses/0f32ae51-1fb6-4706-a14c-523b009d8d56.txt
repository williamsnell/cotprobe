Okay, so I have this question about where dental plaque accumulates on teeth when someone has poor oral hygiene. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that dental plaque is the sticky film that forms on teeth and can lead to cavities and gum disease if not removed. Poor oral hygiene means not brushing or flossing regularly, so plaque builds up more.

I think about the surfaces of the teeth. Teeth have different surfaces: buccal, labial, palatal, lingual, and others. Wait, buccal is on the side facing the cheek, labial is on the front for front teeth, palatal is the top inner surface, and lingual is the bottom inner surface, opposite the tongue.

When someone doesn't brush well, the areas that are harder to reach are where plaque accumulates more. So, the upper molars have those big biting surfaces, and if you don't brush them, especially the chewing surfaces, plaque can build up there. The buccal surfaces of the upper molars are the ones facing the cheek, which might be less accessible for some people, especially if they don't reach back with their toothbrush.

As for the lower incisors, which are the front bottom teeth, poor brushing might leave the labial surfaces (the front sides) or the lingual surfaces (the back sides) with more plaque. But wait, the lower incisors are near the tongue. If someone doesn't floss between them or brush the tongue side, the lingual surfaces might get more plaque. Or maybe the labial side because it's the front and might be more exposed if not brushed properly.

Wait, no, the lower incisors' labial surfaces are on the front, like where you smile. If someone neglects to brush that area, especially the front, then yeah, that could accumulate. But also, the lower incisors' lingual surfaces are next to the tongue, which might be harder to reach, so maybe that's where more plaque accumulates.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think of each option. The question is about the surfaces where plaque is most likely.

Option D says buccal surfaces of upper molars and lingual of lower incisors. Upper molars' buccal surfaces are the sides facing the cheek, which are harder to reach, so that makes sense. Lower incisors' lingual surfaces are the tongue side, which might be harder to clean, so that could accumulate more.

Option C is buccal upper molars and palatal lower incisors. Palatal lower incisors? Wait, the lower incisors don't have a palatal surface. The upper incisors have palatal, lower have lingual. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option E is labial upper molars and buccal lower incisors. Labial on upper molars? Upper molars' labial surfaces are the front, but I think the buccal is more likely to accumulate because it's the side towards the cheek, which is harder to reach. So maybe E is not correct.

Option D seems plausible. Upper molars' buccal and lower incisors' lingual. That would make sense because both are harder to reach areas when someone doesn't brush well.

Wait, but the lower incisors' labial surfaces are on the front, which are more visible. If someone doesn't brush the front, those would get plaque too. But the question is about where it's most likely, so maybe the harder to reach areas.

I'm going to go with D: buccal surfaces of upper molars and lingual surfaces of lower incisors.

The question asks about the surfaces of the teeth where dental plaque is most likely to accumulate in a patient with poor oral hygiene. Dental plaque tends to accumulate in areas that are harder to reach during brushing, such as the buccal surfaces of the upper molars, which are on the cheek side and less accessible. Additionally, the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors, which are on the tongue side, are also harder to clean and prone to plaque buildup. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: The buccal surfaces of the upper molars and lingual surfaces of the lower incisors.

Answer: D
