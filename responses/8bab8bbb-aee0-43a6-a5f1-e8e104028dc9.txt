Okay, so I have this integral to solve: the integral from 0 to π/2 of 1 divided by (1 + tan(x) raised to the power of sqrt(2)) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but maybe I can figure it out.

First, I remember that integrals involving tan(x) sometimes have nice properties, especially over symmetric intervals like from 0 to π/2. I think there's a substitution trick where you use the fact that tan(π/2 - x) is equal to cot(x), which is 1/tan(x). Maybe that could help here.

Let me try substituting u = π/2 - x. So when x is 0, u is π/2, and when x is π/2, u is 0. So the limits of integration would switch, but I can just swap them and add a negative sign, which would cancel out. So the integral becomes the integral from 0 to π/2 of 1/(1 + tan(π/2 - u)^sqrt(2)) du.

But tan(π/2 - u) is cot(u), which is 1/tan(u). So substituting that in, the integrand becomes 1/(1 + (1/tan(u))^sqrt(2)). Let me write that as 1/(1 + (1/tan(u))^sqrt(2)).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it. Let's simplify the denominator: 1 + (1/tan(u))^sqrt(2) = 1 + (cot(u))^sqrt(2). But cot(u) is 1/tan(u), so (cot(u))^sqrt(2) is 1/(tan(u))^sqrt(2). 

So the denominator is 1 + 1/(tan(u))^sqrt(2). Let me write this as [ (tan(u))^sqrt(2) + 1 ] / (tan(u))^sqrt(2). So the whole fraction becomes [ (tan(u))^sqrt(2) / (tan(u))^sqrt(2) + 1 ]? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the integrand is 1 divided by [1 + (1/tan(u))^sqrt(2)], which is the same as 1 divided by [1 + (cot(u))^sqrt(2)]. So that's 1 / [1 + (cot(u))^sqrt(2)].

If I take the reciprocal of that, I get [1 + (cot(u))^sqrt(2)].

But maybe instead of that approach, I can add the original integral and the transformed integral. Let me denote the original integral as I. Then, after substitution, I have another expression for I. So I + I should equal something.

Wait, let me write this down:

Let I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 / (1 + tan(x)^sqrt(2))] dx.

After substitution u = π/2 - x, I becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [1 / (1 + (1/tan(u))^sqrt(2))] du.

So, I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 / (1 + (cot(u))^sqrt(2))] du.

Now, let's add the original I and this transformed I:

I + I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 / (1 + tan(x)^sqrt(2)) + 1 / (1 + (cot(x))^sqrt(2))] dx.

Wait, because the variable of integration is a dummy variable, so both integrals are over the same interval. So I can write this as:

2I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 / (1 + tan(x)^sqrt(2)) + 1 / (1 + (1/tan(x))^sqrt(2))] dx.

Now, let's compute the sum inside the integral:

1/(1 + tan^sqrt(2)x) + 1/(1 + (1/tan^sqrt(2)x)).

Let me compute this sum:

Let’s denote t = tan(x)^sqrt(2). Then the first term is 1/(1 + t), and the second term is 1/(1 + 1/t) = t/(1 + t).

So adding them together: 1/(1 + t) + t/(1 + t) = (1 + t)/(1 + t) = 1.

Wow, that's neat! So the integrand simplifies to 1. Therefore, 2I = ∫₀^{π/2} 1 dx.

The integral of 1 from 0 to π/2 is just π/2. So 2I = π/2, which means I = π/4.

Wait, π/4 is approximately 0.7854. Looking at the options, option F is 0.78539815, which matches π/4.

So the answer should be F.

The integral can be simplified by using the substitution \( u = \pi/2 - x \), leading to the realization that the sum of the integral and its transformed version equals \( \pi/2 \). Thus, the integral evaluates to \( \pi/4 \).
