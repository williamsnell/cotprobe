Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating bonuses for employees based on labor-cost savings. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The company is called ACEPLUS SALES COMPANY, and they want to give a bonus to their employees. The plan is to distribute 70% of the labor-cost savings to the employees, while the employer keeps 30%. 

The given data is: total sales are $100,000 and the total labor cost is $32,000. The standard total cost of labor is 40% of the adjusted sales price. 

First, I need to find out what the standard labor cost should be, right? Because the actual labor cost is $32,000, but the standard is 40% of sales. Let me calculate that. 

So 40% of $100,000 is 0.4 * 100,000 = $40,000. Wait, but the actual labor cost is $32,000. That means there's a saving here. 

The labor cost saving would be the standard cost minus the actual cost. So $40,000 (standard) minus $32,000 (actual) equals $8,000 savings. 

Now, the company is going to distribute 70% of this saving as a bonus. So 70% of $8,000 is 0.7 * 8,000 = $5,600. That would be the total bonus paid to employees. 

But wait, the question also asks for the percentage of wages earned that the workers will receive as a bonus. Hmm, so I think this means what percentage the bonus is of their total earnings. 

Wait, but the problem says the bonus will be paid as a set percentage of the employee's earnings. So I need to find what percentage $5,600 is of their total wages. 

But wait, the total wages are the actual labor cost, which is $32,000. So the bonus is $5,600, and that's a percentage of $32,000. 

So the percentage is ($5,600 / $32,000) * 100. Let me calculate that. 

$5,600 divided by $32,000 is 0.175. Multiply by 100 gives 17.5%. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $5,600 and 17.5%, which matches. 

But let me double-check. The standard labor cost is 40% of sales, which is $40k. Actual is $32k, so saving is $8k. 70% of that is $5,600. 

And the bonus as a percentage of wages: the total wages are $32k, so 5,600 / 32,000 = 17.5%. 

Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be E: $5,600 and 17.5%, which is option E.

The total labor cost saving is $8,000, and 70% of that is $5,600. The bonus as a percentage of wages is 17.5%. 

Answer: E
