Question:

A surgeon performed an appendectomy on a patient in an operating room at the local hospital. The surgeon was assisted by a nurse who was assigned to the operation by the hospital. During the patient's early convalescence, he complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the surgeon, who had bandaged him following the operation, had done so in such a manner as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the surgeon for malpractice, claiming $25,000 in damages. In his case-in-chief, the patient called the nurse to testifS' that shortly after the surgery, she saw the surgeon destroy the postoperative x-rays of the patient's abdomen. Upon objection by the surgeon's attorney, the trial judge should rule the nurse's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, but only if the surgeon is given an opportunity to refute the nurse's testimony.
B: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
C: inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.
D: admissible, if the patient can demonstrate that the destroyed x-rays would have supported his claim.
E: admissible, but leave the weight of the nurse's testimony to be determined by the jury.
F: inadmissible, as the x-rays were destroyed post-operation and do not pertain to the surgeon's performance during the surgery.
G: inadmissible, unless other evidence can corroborate the nurse's testimony.
H: admissible, only if the nurse can prove that the surgeon intentionally destroyed the x-rays.
I: inadmissible, because the nurse's testimony is hearsay.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about evidence admissibility in a malpractice case. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a patient had an appendectomy, but the surgeon's bandaging caused some issues. Then, the patient sued the surgeon for malpractice. During the trial, the patient called a nurse as a witness who claims she saw the surgeon destroy the postoperative x-rays shortly after surgery. The surgeon's attorney objected, and the question is whether the nurse's testimony is admissible.

First, I need to recall some evidence rules, probably focusing on hearsay and whether this testimony is relevant. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. But here, the nurse is testifying about what she sawâ€”the surgeon destroying the x-rays. So, the statement isn't being offered for the truth of what the surgeon said (if any), but rather for the fact that the x-rays were destroyed. That might not be hearsay. Wait, no, because the nurse is recounting an event she observed, so it's not hearsay because it's her personal knowledge. So maybe it's admissible on that basis.

Next, relevance. The patient is suing for malpractice, claiming the surgeon's bandaging caused his pain and slow recovery. If the x-rays were destroyed, the patient might argue that those x-rays could have shown evidence of the surgeon's mistake. So, the destruction of evidence could be relevant to show that the surgeon had something to hide, implying he made a mistake. Alternatively, it might support a claim of spoliation of evidence, which can be a factor in determining whether the jury should infer that the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to the defendant.

But wait, the surgeon's attorney objected. The objection could be based on the idea that the probative value is outweighed by the potential for prejudice. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 403, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. So, allowing testimony that the surgeon destroyed x-rays might make the jury think the surgeon was trying to hide something, which could prejudice him without necessarily being directly probative.

Alternatively, the issue could be about whether the destruction of the x-rays is relevant. If the x-rays were destroyed, does that relate to the malpractice claim? The patient's claim is about the bandaging causing harm. Unless the x-rays would have shown something about the bandaging or the surgery, their destruction might not be directly relevant. But if the x-rays could have shown internal issues caused by the bandaging, then their destruction would be relevant as spoliation.

Another angle is whether the nurse's testimony is about a collateral matter. If the destruction of the x-rays is collateral to the main issue (the bandaging), then under Rule 613, extrinsic evidence might not be allowed. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the destruction might go to the surgeon's state of mind or intent, which could be relevant.

Wait, the patient is trying to show that the surgeon's actions after the surgery (destroying x-rays) are evidence of malpractice. Or perhaps they are using it to show that the surgeon was negligent in his post-operative care, which relates to the bandaging issue. Alternatively, the destruction could be seen as an attempt to cover up a mistake, which could support a malpractice claim.

But the problem is whether the testimony about the destruction is admissible. Let's think about the options.

Option B says it's inadmissible because the probative value is outweighed by unfair prejudice. That seems possible because if the jury hears that the surgeon destroyed evidence, it could prejudice them against the surgeon, even if the x-rays might not directly prove negligence.

Option C says it's inadmissible as extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter. If the destruction is collateral, then extrinsic evidence (like the nurse's testimony) wouldn't be allowed. But I'm not sure if the destruction is collateral. If it's about whether the surgeon was negligent, then maybe it's not collateral.

Option I says it's inadmissible as hearsay. But the nurse is testifying about what she saw, not repeating something the surgeon said. So it's not hearsay. So I can eliminate option I.

Option D says it's admissible if the patient can show the x-rays would have supported his claim. That might be relevant, but the patient doesn't have to prove that yet; the issue is whether the testimony is admissible at all.

Option E says it's admissible, leaving the weight to the jury. That could be the case, but the judge might have to decide if it's admissible under 403.

So, considering the possible prejudice, the judge might rule that the nurse's testimony is inadmissible under Rule 403 because the prejudice outweighs the probative value. So the correct answer would be B.

The nurse's testimony about the surgeon destroying x-rays could prejudice the jury against the surgeon, outweighing its probative value. Therefore, the testimony should be excluded under Rule 403.

Answer: B
