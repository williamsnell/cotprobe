Question:

The color of a pixel can be represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model, which stores values for red, green, and blue, each ranging from 0 to 255. How many bits (binary digits) would be needed to represent a color in the RGB model?

Options:

A: 56
B: 16
C: 64
D: 24
E: 8
F: 48
G: 12
H: 128
I: 72
J: 32

Alright, so I've got this question about the RGB color model and how many bits are needed to represent a color. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, I remember that RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. Each of these components can have a value, right? And those values go from 0 to 255. Oh wait, that's 256 possible values for each color channel because it starts at 0. So each color channel is an 8-bit value. Because 2^8 is 256, which covers all possible values from 0 to 255.

So, if each of the three colors (red, green, blue) uses 8 bits, then the total number of bits needed would be 8 multiplied by 3. Let me do that math: 8 * 3 equals 24. So that's 24 bits in total.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches 24. The options are A to J, and D is 24. So the answer should be D.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me confirm. Each component is 8 bits, and there are three components. Yeah, 8 * 3 is 24. So D is correct. I don't think I'm mixing it up with other color models like CMYK or anything else because the question specifically mentions RGB. So yeah, definitely D.

The RGB color model uses 8 bits for each of the red, green, and blue components, totaling 24 bits.

Answer: D
