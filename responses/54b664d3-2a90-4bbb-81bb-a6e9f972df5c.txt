Question:

Describe the two major physiological theories of depression.

Options:

A: The first theory is based on immune system dysfunction, and the second on abnormalities in circadian rhythms.
B: The first theory revolves around genetic predispositions and the second theory focuses on environmental factors.
C: The first theory connects depression to thyroid gland dysfunction, and the second to oxidative stress within neurons.
D: The first theory involves cognitive processes and the second entails behavioral responses.
E: The first theory is concerned with hormonal imbalances and the second with neurotransmitter deficiencies.
F: The first theory suggests an overactivity of the frontal lobe, while the second associates depression with a lack of physical activity.
G: The first theory attributes depression to excessive neuronal cell death, and the second to the malfunctioning of the reward system in the brain.
H: The first theory links depression to a deficiency in vitamin D levels, and the second to fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
I: The first theory implicates disruptions in the gut-brain axis, while the second focuses on deficits in social interaction.
J: The first theory is concerned primarily with electrolyte metabolism and the second with the chemicals involved in neural transmission.

Okay, so I have this question about the two major physiological theories of depression. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what physiological theories are. From what I remember, physiological theories look at biological processes in the body that might cause depression. So they're different from psychological theories, which focus on mental or emotional factors.

The question asks for the two major ones. I think I've heard about a few theories before. Let me try to recall. There's the monoamine hypothesis, which I believe is related to neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These are chemicals that transmit signals in the brain. If their levels are imbalanced, it can lead to depression. So that's one theory—neurotransmitter deficiency.

Another theory I remember involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is involved in the body's stress response. In some cases of depression, the HPA axis becomes dysregulated, leading to increased cortisol levels. Cortisol is a stress hormone, and too much of it can have negative effects on the brain, possibly contributing to depression. So that's another physiological theory—hormonal imbalance.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to match this. Let's check each option.

Option E says the first theory is about hormonal imbalances and the second about neurotransmitter deficiencies. That fits with what I was thinking. The first part would be the HPA axis and cortisol, which is a hormonal issue, and the second part is the monoamine theory about neurotransmitters.

Option D talks about cognitive and behavioral processes, which seems more psychological, so probably not the physiological ones. Option G mentions neuronal cell death and the reward system. I think neuronal cell death could be part of another theory, like the neuroplasticity theory, but I'm not sure if that's considered one of the major ones. The reward system malfunction is related to neurotransmitters too, but I'm not certain if that's the primary theory.

Option C talks about thyroid dysfunction and oxidative stress. Those are more specific, maybe subsets of broader theories. I don't think they're the major ones.

Option B is about genetics and environment, which are more about causes rather than physiological processes themselves.

Option H links to vitamin D and blood sugar, which might be contributing factors but not the main theories.

So, focusing on the main theories, E seems to fit. It's about hormonal imbalances (like HPA axis) and neurotransmitter deficiencies (like monoamines). That's the two major physiological theories I remember.

The two major physiological theories of depression are the monoamine hypothesis, which focuses on neurotransmitter deficiencies such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, and the hormonal imbalance theory, particularly involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and cortisol levels. These align with Option E, which correctly identifies hormonal imbalances and neurotransmitter deficiencies as the two theories.

Answer: E
