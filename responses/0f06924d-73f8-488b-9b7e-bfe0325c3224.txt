Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to evaluate the vector field u at the point (-1, 1, 2). The vector field u is given as u = x²i + e^(xy)j + xyz k. Hmm, wait, let me make sure I read that right. Yeah, it's u equals x squared i plus e to the power of xy times j, plus x times y times z times k. 

Alright, so the point is (-1, 1, 2). That means x is -1, y is 1, and z is 2. I need to plug these values into each component of the vector field to find u at that point.

Let's break it down component by component. Starting with the i-component, which is x squared. So x is -1, so (-1)^2 is 1. So the i-component is 1.

Next is the j-component, which is e raised to the power of xy. So x is -1, y is 1. Multiplying those gives (-1)(1) = -1. So e^(-1). I remember that e^(-1) is 1 over e, approximately 0.3679, but I don't think I need to compute the exact value since the answer choices have it in terms of e.

Then the k-component is xyz. So x is -1, y is 1, z is 2. Multiplying them together: (-1)*1*2 = -2. So the k-component is -2.

Putting it all together, the vector u at (-1,1,2) is (1) i + (e^(-1)) j + (-2) k. So in component form, that's (1, e^(-1), -2).

Wait, but looking at the answer options, most of them are scalar values, not vectors. The options are things like -3 - e^1, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, the question says "Evaluatediv u at the point..." Wait, div u? Oh, I thought it was just evaluating u, but it's the divergence of u.

Right, the divergence of a vector field u = (u₁, u₂, u₃) is the scalar ∇·u = ∂u₁/∂x + ∂u₂/∂y + ∂u₃/∂z. So I need to compute the divergence of u first and then evaluate it at the point (-1,1,2).

Okay, let me compute that. So u = x² i + e^(xy) j + xyz k.

The divergence is ∂(x²)/∂x + ∂(e^(xy))/∂y + ∂(xyz)/∂z.

Calculating each partial derivative:

∂(x²)/∂x = 2x.

∂(e^(xy))/∂y: Since e^(xy) is e raised to the product of x and y, the derivative with respect to y is e^(xy) times x (by the chain rule). So it's x e^(xy).

∂(xyz)/∂z: The partial of xyz with respect to z is xy, since x and y are treated as constants when taking the derivative with respect to z.

So putting it all together, the divergence is 2x + x e^(xy) + xy.

Now, evaluate this at the point (-1, 1, 2). So x = -1, y =1, z=2.

Compute each term:

First term: 2x = 2*(-1) = -2.

Second term: x e^(xy) = (-1) * e^((-1)(1)) = (-1) * e^(-1).

Third term: xy = (-1)(1) = -1.

So adding them up: -2 + (-1 e^(-1)) + (-1) = (-2 -1) + (-e^(-1)) = -3 - e^(-1).

Let me check the options. Option D is -3 - e^-1. So that should be the correct answer.

To evaluate the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{u} = x^2 \mathbf{i} + e^{xy} \mathbf{j} + xyz \mathbf{k} \) at the point \((-1, 1, 2)\), we first compute the divergence:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(e^{xy}) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(xyz)
\]

Calculating each term:
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2) = 2x\)
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(e^{xy}) = x e^{xy}\)
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(xyz) = xy\)

Thus, the divergence is:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2x + x e^{xy} + xy
\]

Substituting the point \((-1, 1, 2)\):
- \(2x = 2(-1) = -2\)
- \(x e^{xy} = (-1) e^{(-1)(1)} = -e^{-1}\)
- \(xy = (-1)(1) = -1\)

Adding these:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = -2 - e^{-1} - 1 = -3 - e^{-1}
\]

The correct answer is **D**.
