Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll do my best.

Okay, the question is about finding the equation of a sine wave with specific characteristics and then determining the current at a certain time and the fraction of the cycle completed. Let's break it down.

First, the problem states it's a 25-cycle-current sine wave. Wait, 25-cycle? That doesn't sound right. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo. Oh, maybe it's 25 Hz? Because cycles per second are hertz. So, it's a 25 Hz sine wave. That makes more sense.

Next, the root mean square (rms) value is given as 30 amps. I remember that for a sine wave, the rms value is Imax divided by sqrt(2). So, rms = Imax / √2. So, to find Imax, I can rearrange that: Imax = rms * √2.

Let me calculate that. 30 * sqrt(2) is approximately 30 * 1.4142. Let me compute that: 30 * 1.4142 = approximately 42.426 A. So, Imax is about 42.4 A.

The equation of a sine wave is generally given by i(t) = Imax * sin(ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency and φ is the phase shift. Since it's stated that the wave crosses the time axis in the positive direction at t=0, that means at t=0, the sine function should be zero and heading upwards. That would imply that the phase angle φ is 0, so the equation simplifies to i(t) = Imax * sin(ωt).

Now, angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f by ω = 2πf. The frequency here is 25 Hz, so ω = 2 * π * 25. Let me calculate that: 2 * 3.1416 *25 ≈ 157.08 rad/s. So, approximately 157 rad/s when rounded.

So putting it all together, the equation should be i(t) = 42.4 sin(157t).

Now, looking at the options, I'll check which ones match this equation. Let's see:

Option D: i=42.4 sin(157t), 30 amp, 1/8 cycle. Wait, wait, no, the Imax is 42.4 A, but the rms is 30 A, which matches. So the equation in D looks correct so far.

Next, the question asks for the value of the current when t=0.005 seconds. Let's plug that into the equation.

i(0.005) = 42.4 * sin(157 * 0.005). Let's compute 157 * 0.005 = 0.785 radians. Sin(0.785) is approximately sin(π/4), which is about 0.7071. So 42.4 * 0.7071 ≈ 30 A. Wait, that's interesting. So the current at t=0.005 s is approximately 30 A.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation. 157 * 0.005 is 0.785. Yes, that's correct. Sin(0.785) is indeed around 0.7071. So 42.4 * 0.7071 ≈ 30 A. So the current is 30 A at that time.

Alternatively, wait, another way to think about it: 157 rad/s is the angular frequency. So 0.005 seconds would correspond to a fraction of the period. Let me compute the period T. T = 1/f = 1/25 = 0.04 seconds. So 0.005 s is 0.005 / 0.04 = 1/8 of the period. So the wave has gone through 1/8 of a cycle in 0.005 seconds.

Wait, but wait, let's see. The phase at t=0.005 is ωt = 157 * 0.005 = 0.785 radians. Since one full cycle is 2π radians (≈6.283 radians), 0.785 is about 1/8 of 6.283. Because 6.283 / 8 ≈ 0.785. So yes, that's 1/8 of a cycle.

Wait, but in the options, option D says 1/8 cycle, which matches. So the current value is 30 A, and the fraction is 1/8. So looking at option D, it says 30 amp and 1/8 cycle. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D is "i=42.4 sin 157t, 30 amp, 1/8 cycle." So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. For example, option E has cos instead of sin, but the question says the wave crosses the time axis at t=0 in the positive direction, which for a sine wave starts at zero and goes up, so the equation must be a sine function. So cos would be starting at maximum, which is not the case here. So option E can be eliminated.

Another option is D and I. Option I: 60 sin 157t, which would have Imax=60, but our calculation says 42.4, so I is out. Option C is 30 sin 100t, which would have a lower frequency; 100 rad/s corresponds to f=100/(2π) ≈15.9 Hz, not 25 Hz. So C is wrong.

So the correct equation is i=42.4 sin 157t, which is option D. The current at t=0.005 is 30 A, and the fraction is 1/8 of a cycle. So the correct answer should be D.

The equation of the sine wave is determined using the given rms value and frequency. The rms value (30 A) relates to the peak current (Imax) as Imax = rms × √2 ≈ 42.4 A. The angular frequency (ω) is calculated as ω = 2πf = 157 rad/s. The wave equation is i(t) = 42.4 sin(157t). At t = 0.005 s, the current is approximately 30 A, and the fraction of the cycle is 1/8. Option D matches all these criteria.

Answer: D
