<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. 

The set S consists of integers between 1 and 2^40. So that's all the numbers from 1 up to, but not including, 2^40. Wait, actually, since it's between 1 and 2^40, does that include 2^40? Hmm, the wording says "between 1 and 2^40", which usually means up to but not including 2^40. But sometimes people say "between 1 and N inclusive", so I need to clarify that. Wait, the way it's written, "between 1 and 2^40", so probably from 1 to 2^40 -1. So the total numbers in S are 2^40 -1, but actually, wait, no—because S is the set of integers that contain exactly two 1’s when written in base 2. So it's not all integers up to 2^40, but only those with exactly two 1's in their binary representation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the set S is the set of integers between 1 and 2^40 that contain two 1’s when written in base 2. So S is the collection of numbers within that range that have exactly two 1's in their binary form. So for example, the number 3 is 11 in binary, which has two 1's, so it's in S. Similarly, 5 is 101, which has two 1's, so it's in S, and so on.

So the first step is to find out how many numbers are in S. Since each number in S has exactly two 1's in their binary representation, the count of such numbers is the number of ways to choose two distinct bit positions out of the total number of bits possible. But wait, how many bits are there? Since we're dealing with numbers up to 2^40, the maximum number is 2^40 -1, which is a 40-bit number (since 2^40 is a 41-bit number, but numbers up to 2^40 -1 are 40 bits or less). So each number can be represented with up to 40 bits.

Wait, actually, the number 2^40 is 1 followed by 40 zeros, so the numbers from 1 to 2^40 -1 are all the 40-bit numbers, including those with leading zeros if we consider fixed 40-bit representations. But when we count the numbers with exactly two 1's, it's the same as choosing any two distinct bit positions among the 40 bits, because any two 1's in a 40-bit number will represent a unique number in that range. So the count of such numbers is the combination C(40, 2), which is 40 choose 2.

Calculating that: C(40,2) = (40*39)/2 = 780. So the size of set S is 780.

Now, the problem asks for the probability that a randomly selected integer from S is divisible by 9. So I need to find how many numbers in S are divisible by 9, then divide that by 780 to get the probability.

So the main task now is to find how many numbers with exactly two 1's in their binary representation are divisible by 9.

Hmm, how can I approach this? Well, let's think about the binary numbers with exactly two 1's. Each such number can be written as 2^i + 2^j, where i and j are distinct non-negative integers, and i > j (without loss of generality). So each such number is a sum of two distinct powers of 2.

We need to find how many such pairs (i, j) satisfy the condition that 2^i + 2^j is divisible by 9, i.e., (2^i + 2^j) mod 9 = 0.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (i, j) where i > j >= 0, such that (2^i + 2^j) ≡ 0 mod 9.

I can approach this by first finding the pattern of 2^k mod 9. Because if I can find the residues of 2^k mod 9, then I can determine when 2^i + 2^j ≡ 0 mod 9.

Let me compute the powers of 2 modulo 9:

2^0 mod 9 = 1
2^1 mod 9 = 2
2^2 mod 9 = 4
2^3 mod 9 = 8
2^4 mod 9 = 16 mod 9 = 7
2^5 mod 9 = 14 mod 9 = 5
2^6 mod 9 = 10 mod 9 = 1
2^7 mod 9 = 2
2^8 mod 9 = 4
2^9 mod 9 = 8
2^10 mod 9 = 7
...

Wait, I notice a pattern here. The residues cycle every 6 steps because 2^6 ≡ 1 mod 9, and then it repeats. So the cycle length is 6.

So the residues cycle as: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, then back to 1, 2, etc.

So for any exponent k, 2^k mod 9 is the same as 2^(k mod 6) mod 9.

So now, for each pair (i, j), we have:

(2^i + 2^j) mod 9 = (r_i + r_j) mod 9, where r_k = 2^k mod 9.

We want r_i + r_j ≡ 0 mod 9.

So for each possible residue r, we can find another residue s such that r + s ≡ 0 mod 9. That is, s = (9 - r) mod 9.

So let's list the possible residues and their complementary residues:

Residues are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.

Wait, let me list all possible residues from 2^k mod 9:

From earlier, the residues cycle every 6 as: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5.

So possible residues are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.

Now, for each residue r, the complementary residue s is (9 - r) mod 9. Let's compute these:

r=1 → s=8
r=2 → s=7
r=4 → s=5
r=5 → s=4
r=7 → s=2
r=8 → s=1

Wait, but 9 -1=8, 9-2=7, 9-4=5, 9-5=4, 9-7=2, 9-8=1.

So for each r, s is as above.

Now, to find pairs (i, j) where r_i = r and r_j = s, such that r + s ≡ 0 mod 9.

But since i and j are distinct, and i > j, we can model this by considering all possible (r_i, r_j) pairs where r_i + r_j ≡ 0 mod 9.

So the possible valid (r_i, r_j) pairs are:

(1,8), (8,1),
(2,7), (7,2),
(4,5), (5,4).

But wait, since i > j, the pair (i, j) will have i > j, so r_i is the residue of 2^i, and r_j is the residue of 2^j. So for each valid (r_i, r_j) pair where r_i + r_j ≡0 mod9, we can count the number of such (i,j) pairs.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible (r_i, r_j) combinations and count how many times r_i + r_j ≡0 mod9.

Wait, but maybe it's more efficient to consider the possible pairs of residues that add up to 9.

So, let's list all possible (r_i, r_j) pairs where r_i + r_j ≡0 mod9:

1. r_i=1, r_j=8
2. r_i=8, r_j=1
3. r_i=2, r_j=7
4. r_i=7, r_j=2
5. r_i=4, r_j=5
6. r_i=5, r_j=4

Each of these pairs would satisfy the condition.

Now, for each of these six cases, we can compute how many (i,j) pairs in S correspond to these residue pairs.

But wait, the residues cycle every 6 exponents, so for any exponent k, 2^k mod9 is determined by k mod6.

So, for example, if k ≡0 mod6, then 2^k ≡1 mod9.

Similarly, k≡1 →2, k≡2→4, k≡3→8, k≡4→7, k≡5→5.

So, for each residue r, we can find how many exponents k in the range 0 to 39 (since i and j are up to 39, as we're dealing with 40-bit numbers) have 2^k ≡ r mod9.

Wait, because our numbers are up to 2^40, which is a 41-bit number, but the numbers in S are up to 2^40 -1, which is a 40-bit number. So the exponents i and j can range from 0 to 39.

So for each residue r in {1,2,4,5,7,8}, we can compute how many exponents k (0 ≤k ≤39) have 2^k ≡r mod9.

Since the residues cycle every 6, the number of times each residue occurs in 40 exponents can be calculated.

Let's compute the count for each residue:

Total exponents =40.

Each cycle is 6 exponents. So 40 divided by 6 is 6 cycles (6*6=36 exponents) and a remainder of 4 exponents.

So for residues:

r=1: occurs at k ≡0 mod6 → positions 0,6,12,...,36 → total of 7 times (since 0 to 36 is 37 numbers, but every 6 steps: 0,6,12,18,24,30,36 →7 times).

Similarly:

r=2: k≡1 mod6 →1,7,13,...,37 → but 37 is less than 40, so 1,7,13,19,25,31,37 →7 times.

r=4: k≡2 mod6 →2,8,14,20,26,32,38 →7 times.

r=8: k≡3 mod6 →3,9,15,21,27,33,39 →7 times.

r=7: k≡4 mod6 →4,10,16,22,28,34 →6 times (since 4+6*5=34, next would be 40, which is beyond 39).

r=5: k≡5 mod6 →5,11,17,23,29,35 →6 times.

So counts per residue:

r=1 →7
r=2 →7
r=4 →7
r=8 →7
r=7 →6
r=5 →6

Now, let's go back to the possible residue pairs that add up to 0 mod9.

Case 1: (r_i=1, r_j=8) → How many (i,j) pairs where r_i=1 and r_j=8.

The number of such pairs is count(r_i=1) * count(r_j=8) →7 *7=49.

But wait, no. Wait, because for each i where r_i=1, and each j where r_j=8 and j < i, the number of pairs is count(r_i=1) * count(r_j=8), but considering that j must be less than i.

Wait, no, perhaps a better way: for each pair of residues (a, b) where a + b ≡0 mod9, the number of (i,j) pairs is the number of times a occurs multiplied by the number of times b occurs, provided that i > j.

Wait, but in reality, for each a and b where a occurs m times and b occurs n times, the number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i > j and r_i =a, r_j =b is m * n minus the cases where j >=i, but since i > j, it's actually m * n, because for every a occurrence and b occurrence, if a's exponent is higher than b's, it's a valid pair.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that for any a and b where a + b ≡0 mod9, the number of (i,j) pairs is count(a) * count(b) if a > b in terms of exponents, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute for each possible (a, b) where a + b ≡0 mod9, the number of (i,j) pairs where r_i =a, r_j =b, and i > j.

But since the exponents can be anywhere from 0 to 39, the count would be count(a) * count(b), but only when a occurs in higher exponents than b.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because for any a and b, regardless of their numerical value, the exponents can be in any order. So the total number of ordered pairs (i,j) where i > j, r_i =a, r_j =b is count(a) * count(b), because for each occurrence of a, you can pair it with any occurrence of b that has a lower exponent. Wait, but that's not the case because the exponents are independent. So perhaps the correct count is count(a) * count(b), because for any a and b, each a can be paired with any b that comes before it in the exponent list. But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for any two distinct exponents i and j (i > j), the number of pairs where r_i =a and r_j =b is count(a) * count(b) if a and b are such that a + b ≡0 mod9.

But wait, no, because the exponents are in order, and for each a and b, the number of pairs where i has residue a and j has residue b, with i > j, is equal to the number of times a occurs multiplied by the number of times b occurs.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Each number in S is 2^i + 2^j, with i > j. So for each such pair (i,j), we have a number. We need to find how many of these numbers are divisible by 9.

So the condition is 2^i + 2^j ≡0 mod9.

We can rewrite this as 2^j (2^{i-j} + 1) ≡0 mod9.

Since 2 and 9 are coprime, 2^j mod9 is never 0, so the condition simplifies to 2^{i-j} + 1 ≡0 mod9.

So 2^{i-j} ≡ -1 mod9, which is equivalent to 2^{i-j} ≡8 mod9, since -1 ≡8 mod9.

So now, we can restate the condition: 2^{k} ≡8 mod9, where k = i-j.

We need to find all k such that 2^k ≡8 mod9.

From earlier, we know that 2^3 ≡8 mod9.

But let's check the cycle:

k | 2^k mod9
0 |1
1 |2
2 |4
3 |8
4 |7
5 |5
6 |1
7 |2
8 |4
9 |8
10|7
11|5
...

So 2^k ≡8 mod9 when k ≡3 mod6.

So the exponents k where 2^k ≡8 mod9 are k=3,9,15,21,27,33,39.

So k can be 3,9,15,21,27,33,39.

Each such k corresponds to i-j =k, so for each k=3,9,...,39, we can count the number of pairs (i,j) where i-j=k and i >j.

The number of such pairs for each k is (40 -k), since i can range from k to 39, and j =i -k, so j must be ≥0.

Wait, for k=3: i can be from 3 to 39, so 39-3+1=37 pairs.

Wait, no, wait: For k=3, i can be 3,4,...,39. So the number of possible i's is 39 -3 +1=37.

Similarly, for k=9: i can be from9 to39 →39-9+1=31.

k=15: i from15 to39 →25.

k=21: i from21 to39 →19.

k=27: i from27 to39 →13.

k=33: i from33 to39 →7.

k=39: i=39, j=0 →1 pair.

Wait, but wait, when k=39, j must be i-39. So i=39, j=0. That's valid, since j=0 is allowed (as 2^0=1 is allowed).

So the total number of pairs where i-j=k and k ≡3 mod6 is:

For k=3:37
k=9:31
k=15:25
k=21:19
k=27:13
k=33:7
k=39:1

Adding these up:

37 +31=68
68+25=93
93+19=112
112+13=125
125+7=132
132+1=133.

So there are 133 such pairs where i-j is congruent to 3 mod6, which makes 2^{i-j} ≡8 mod9, thus making 2^i +2^j ≡0 mod9.

Wait, but wait a second. Because 2^{i-j} ≡8 mod9 implies that 2^i +2^j ≡0 mod9. So each of these 133 pairs corresponds to a number in S that's divisible by9.

But earlier, I thought that the count might be more involved, but this approach seems more straightforward.

So the total number of favorable cases is 133.

Now, the size of set S is C(40,2) =780.

So the probability is 133 / 780.

Let me compute that.

First, let's see if we can simplify the fraction.

133 and 780: Let's see if they have a common divisor.

133 ÷7=19, no, 7*19=133. Wait, 7*19=133? 7*18=126, 7*19=133, yes.

Wait, 7*19=133.

Now, 780 ÷7: 780/7=111.428..., which is not an integer. So 7 is not a divisor of 780.

Wait, 780=78*10= (13*6)*10=13*60=13* (2^2 *3 *5).

Wait, 780=2^2 *3 *5 *13.

And 133=7*19.

So no common factors, so the fraction is 133/780.

Now, let's compute this as a decimal.

133 ÷780.

Well, 780 ÷133 ≈5.87, so 133 is about 1/5.87 of 780.

But let's compute it more accurately.

So 133 ÷780.

Let me compute 133 ÷780:

First, note that 780 * 0.17 =780 *0.1=78; 780*0.07=54.6 → total 132.6.

So 0.17 gives 132.6, which is just under 133.

So 0.17 gives us approximately 132.6, so 0.17 + (0.4/780) ≈0.17 +0.000513 ≈0.1705.

Wait, because 780 *0.0005=0.39, so 0.39 would be 0.0005.

Wait, better to compute it as:

133 ÷780 = ?

Let me compute 133 ÷780.

Let me set it up as a division: 133 ÷780.

Since 133 <780, it's 0. something.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 133000 ÷780.

Compute 780 * 17 = 13,260.

Subtract from 133,000: 133,000 -132,600 =400.

So 17 with a remainder of 400.

So 133 ÷780 =0.17 + (400/780).

Now, 400/780 =40/78 =20/39 ≈0.5128.

So total is approximately 0.17 +0.5128 * (0.000 something? Wait, no, I think I messed up the decimal placement.

Wait, no, when I did 133 ÷780, I multiplied numerator and denominator by 1000 to get 133000 ÷780.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 133 ÷780 = (133 *1000) / (780 *1000) =133000 /780000.

But perhaps a better way is to compute 133 ÷780 as:

133 ÷780 = x.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10: 1330 ÷7800.

Simplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 133 ÷780.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute it as:

Compute 133 ÷780:

Well, 780 goes into 133 zero times. So 0.

Then, 780 goes into 1330 once (since 780*1=780; 780*2=1560 which is too big). So 1.

Subtract 780 from 1330: 550.

Bring down a zero: 5500.

780 goes into 5500 seven times (780*7=5460). Subtract: 5500-5460=40.

Bring down a zero: 400.

780 goes into 400 zero times. So next digit is 0.

Bring down another zero: 4000.

780 goes into 4000 five times (780*5=3900). Subtract: 4000-3900=100.

Bring down a zero: 1000.

780 goes into 1000 once (780). Subtract: 1000-780=220.

Bring down a zero: 2200.

780 goes into 2200 two times (780*2=1560). Subtract: 2200-1560=640.

Bring down a zero: 6400.

780 goes into 6400 eight times (780*8=6240). Subtract: 6400-6240=160.

Bring down a zero: 1600.

780 goes into 1600 twice (780*2=1560). Subtract: 1600-1560=40.

Hmm, I see a repeating pattern now. So putting it all together:

0.1705128205...

So approximately 0.1705.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.1705, which matches this value.

Wait, but earlier I thought the count was 133, but let me double-check that because 133/780 is approximately 0.1705, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the count was 133, but let me confirm.

Earlier, I calculated the number of (i,j) pairs where i-j ≡3 mod6, which gave me 133 pairs. So the total favorable cases are 133, and the total cases are 780, so the probability is 133/780 ≈0.1705, which is option B.

So the answer should be B:0.1705.
</think>

The set S consists of integers between 1 and \(2^{40}\) with exactly two 1’s in their binary representation. The size of S is \(C(40, 2) = 780\). To find the probability that a randomly selected integer from S is divisible by 9, we need to count how many such numbers satisfy \(2^i + 2^j \equiv 0 \mod 9\). By analyzing the residues of powers of 2 modulo 9, we determine that \(2^i + 2^j\) is divisible by 9 when \(i - j \equiv 3 \mod 6\). Counting valid pairs \((i, j)\) with this condition yields 133 favorable cases. The probability is \(133/780 \approx 0.1705\).

Answer: B
