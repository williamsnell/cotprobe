Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two signals, x(t) and v(t), and I need to find y(τ) where τ is 2.5. The function y(τ) is defined as the integral from -infinity to infinity of x(τ - t) times v(t) dt. Hmm, I think this is a convolution integral because it's in the form of y(τ) = x * v evaluated at τ. Convolution usually involves flipping one signal and sliding it over the other, then integrating the product at each point.

Let me write down the given functions first to get a clear picture.

x(t) is 1 when t is between 0 and 3, and 0 otherwise. So it's a rectangular pulse from 0 to 3.

v(t) is 1 when t is between 0 and 2, and 0 otherwise. Another rectangular pulse, but shorter, from 0 to 2.

Now, y(τ) = ∫ x(τ - t) v(t) dt from -∞ to ∞. Since both x and v are zero outside their intervals, the integral will only be non-zero where both x(τ - t) and v(t) are non-zero.

Wait, x(τ - t) is the same as x(t'), where t' = τ - t. So for x(t') to be 1, t' must be between 0 and 3. Which means τ - t ≥ 0 → t ≤ τ, and τ - t ≤3 → t ≥ τ -3. So t must be between τ-3 and τ for x(τ-t) to be 1.

But v(t) is 1 only when t is between 0 and 2. So the integral will be the overlap between t ∈ [τ-3, τ] and t ∈ [0,2].

So I need to find the region where t satisfies both conditions and then compute the integral over that region.

Let's compute τ=2.5. So τ=2.5.

The interval for x(τ - t) being non-zero is τ-3 to τ → 2.5-3= -0.5 to 2.5. But v(t) is non-zero from 0 to 2.

So the overlapping region is from 0 to 2, because that's where both functions are 1.

Wait, but wait: the x(τ - t) is 1 when t is ≤2.5 and ≥-0.5. So t ranges from -0.5 to 2.5 for x to be 1. But v(t) is only 1 from 0 to 2. So the overlap is t from 0 to 2.

So the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 2 of x(2.5 - t) * v(t) dt. But since in this interval, x(2.5 - t) is 1 because 2.5 - t is between 0.5 (when t=2) and 2.5 (when t=0), which is within [0,3], so x is 1. Similarly, v(t) is 1 in this interval. So the product is 1*1=1.

Therefore, the integral is from 0 to 2 of 1 dt, which is 2.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think if there's any mistake. When τ=2.5, the x(τ - t) is 1 when τ - t is between 0 and 3 → t between τ-3 and τ, which is -0.5 to 2.5. But v(t) is 1 from 0 to 2. So the overlap is t from 0 to 2, which is a length of 2. So the integral is 2*1=2.

So y(2.5) should be 2. Looking at the options, option C is 2.

The convolution integral for τ=2.5 evaluates to 2, as the overlap region where both x(τ-t) and v(t) are non-zero is from t=0 to t=2, yielding an integral of 2.

Answer: C
