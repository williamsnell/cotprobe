Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about three metal spheres and their charges. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup is that there are three identical metal spheres: A, B, and C. Their initial charges are Q, -Q/4, and Q/2, respectively. Q is given as 2.00 × 10^-14 C. So, that's a pretty small charge, but okay.

Spheres A and B are fixed in place, and they're separated by a distance d of 1.20 meters. The problem says d is much larger than the spheres, so I can probably treat them as point charges. That simplifies things a bit because I can use Coulomb's Law without worrying about the size too much.

Sphere C is touched first to A and then to B before being removed. I need to find the magnitude of the electrostatic force between A and B after these touchings.

Wait, when you touch two identical metal spheres, their charges redistribute equally because they're conductors. So, the charge will be shared between them. Since they're identical, each will end up with half the total charge.

Let me outline the steps:

1. First, find the charge on each sphere after C touches A, then after C touches B. But wait, after touching A, C takes some charge from A, so both A and C will have a new charge. Then, when C touches B, it will share its charge with B, so B's charge will change again.

Wait, but I think I should track the charges step by step.

Initial charges:

A: Q = 2.00 × 10^-14 C.

B: -Q/4 = -(2.00e-14)/4 = -5.00e-15 C.

C: Q/2 = (2.00e-14)/2 = 1.00e-14 C.

First, C touches A. Since they're identical, the total charge will be Q + Q/2 = (3/2) Q. So each will get half of that.

Total charge after touching A: Q + (Q/2) = 3Q/2.

Each sphere (A and C) will have (3Q/2) / 2 = 3Q/4.

Wait, let me calculate that correctly.

Wait, initial charges: A has Q, C has Q/2. When they touch, their charges add up, and since they're identical, each gets half the total.

Total charge: Q + Q/2 = 3Q/2.

Each gets (3Q/2) * (1/2) = 3Q/4.

So after touching A, A now has 3Q/4, and C has 3Q/4.

But wait, no. Wait, when you touch two spheres, their charges add, and then they split equally. So, when C touches A, the total charge is A's initial Q plus C's initial Q/2. So total is 3Q/2. Since the spheres are identical, each will have (3Q/2)/2 = 3Q/4.

So after first touch (C and A):

A's charge becomes 3Q/4.

C's charge becomes 3Q/4.

Then, C is touched to B. Now, B initially has -Q/4, and C has 3Q/4. So total charge when they touch is (-Q/4) + (3Q/4) = (2Q/4) = Q/2.

Since they're identical, each will get (Q/2)/2 = Q/4.

Wait, no, wait: B's initial charge is -Q/4, and C's charge is 3Q/4. So when they touch, the total charge is (-Q/4) + (3Q/4) = (2Q/4) = Q/2.

So each sphere (B and C) will have Q/4 each.

Wait, but wait a second. B is initially at -Q/4, and C is at 3Q/4. So the sum is (3Q/4 - Q/4) = 2Q/4 = Q/2. So when they touch, each will have Q/4.

So after touching B, B's charge becomes Q/4, and C's charge becomes Q/4.

Wait, but then C is removed. So after all that, what are the charges on A and B?

A's charge after touching C: 3Q/4.

B's charge after touching C: Q/4.

So now, the charges on A and B are 3Q/4 and Q/4, respectively.

Now, I need to calculate the electrostatic force between A and B after these touchings. The force is given by Coulomb's Law: F = k * |q1 * q2| / r².

Given that k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C².

The distance r is 1.20 m.

So let's compute the charges:

q_A = 3Q/4.

q_B = Q/4.

Since Q is 2.00e-14 C,

q_A = (3/4) * 2.00e-14 = 1.5e-14 C.

q_B = (1/4) * 2.00e-14 = 0.5e-14 = 5.00e-15 C.

Now, F = k * |(1.5e-14) * (5.00e-15)| / (1.20)^2.

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.5e-14 * 5e-15 = 7.5e-29 C².

Denominator: (1.20)^2 = 1.44 m².

So F = (8.988e9) * (7.5e-29) / 1.44.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 7.5e-29 = (8.988 * 7.5) * 1e-20.

8.988 * 7.5 ≈ 67.41.

So 67.41e-20 = 6.741e-19.

Now, divide by 1.44: 6.741e-19 / 1.44 ≈ 4.68e-19 N.

Wait, that's option C: 4.68 ×10^-19 N.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternative approach: Let me redo the numbers.

q_A = 3Q/4 = (3/4)*2e-14 = 1.5e-14 C.

q_B = Q/4 = 0.5e-14 C.

Multiply them: 1.5e-14 * 0.5e-14 = 0.75e-28 = 7.5e-29 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So F = (8.988e9) * (7.5e-29) / (1.2^2).

1.2^2 is 1.44, correct.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 7.5e-29 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 7.5.

8.988 *7 = 62.916.

8.988 *0.5 = 4.494.

Total: 62.916 +4.494=67.41.

So 67.41e9-29 = 67.41e-20 = 6.741e-19.

Divide by 1.44: 6.741e-19 /1.44 ≈ 4.68e-19 N.

Yes, that's correct. So the force is approximately 4.68 ×10^-19 N.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.68 ×10^-19 N. So the answer should be option C.
