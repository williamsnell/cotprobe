Question:

A state legislature has recently enacted an obscenity statute prohibiting "the selling or offering for sale of any obscene printed or video materials. " Following numerous complaints from a local citizens' group, the police entered an adult bookstore, examined materials on the shelves, and purchased magazines that depicted actual pictures of sexual intercourse. The owner was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the state obscenity law. At his trial, the owner's defense was that the sale of the materials complained of was constitutionally protected speech. Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?

Options:

A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors.
B: The particular materials involved were sold to consenting adults only.
C: The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.
D: The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.
E: The particular materials involved were part of a larger collection of non-explicit content.
F: The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.
G: The particular materials were imported and not produced in the state.
H: 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out which option would help the bookstore owner's defense the most. The question is about an obscenity statute, and the owner is arguing that the sale of the materials is protected speech. So, I remember that the First Amendment protects speech, including some forms of adult-oriented material, but obscenity isn't protected. The key is determining whether the material is actually obscene or just protected speech.

The statute prohibits selling or offering for sale of "obscene printed or video materials." The owner was selling magazines that showed actual sexual intercourse. The defense is that this is constitutional speech, so they need to show that the material isn't obscene.

I think the Supreme Court has set certain criteria for what constitutes obscenity. The Miller test comes to mind. The three prongs are: 1) whether the material appeals to the average person's prurient interest; 2) whether it depicts sexual conduct in a way that is patently offensive under state law; and 3) whether it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

So the owner would need to argue that the material either doesn't meet all three prongs of the Miller test or that the statute is unconstitutional as applied.

Looking at the options:

A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors. That's good because it shows they're responsible, but does it directly affect whether the material is obscene? Maybe not directly. It might help in sentencing but not so much in proving it's protected speech.

B: The materials were sold to consenting adults only. Again, this shows responsible selling, but I'm not sure it directly addresses whether the content is obscene. It might be relevant if the issue is about access to minors, but the obscenity itself is about the content, not who it's sold to.

C: The materials were serious scientific studies. This seems relevant because if the material has serious scientific value, then under the Miller test, it would lack the prurient appeal or have legitimate value, making it protected. So this could be a strong argument.

D: The police didn't have a warrant. This might be a Fourth Amendment issue about illegal search and seizure. If the search was unlawful, the evidence could be suppressed. But the question is about the constitutionality of the sale, not the legality of the search. So while this could affect the case procedurally, it doesn't directly address whether the speech is protected. So maybe not the strongest option.

E: The materials were part of a larger collection of non-explicit content. I'm not sure how this would help. It might show that the bookstore isn't solely about explicit material, but I don't think that affects whether the specific items are obscene.

F: Depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct. The Miller test looks at whether the material is patently offensive. I think normal sexual conduct might be more likely to be considered offensive under some state laws, but it's not clear. Alternatively, if it's normal, maybe it's not as likely to appeal to prurient interests? Or maybe it's the opposite. Not sure, but this might not be the best point.

G: The materials were imported, not produced in-state. I don't think this has much to do with obscenity. It's about jurisdiction maybe, but not the content's protection.

H: 85% of citizens believe the sale doesn't contribute to antisocial behavior. This might relate to community standards, which are part of the Miller test. If the majority thinks it doesn't contribute, maybe it affects the 'patently offensive' prong. But I'm not sure if public opinion is the main factor; the Miller test looks at whether the material is offensive to the average person in the community. So if most people don't think it contributes to antisocial behavior, maybe it's not considered offensive. So this could be relevant.

Now, comparing options C and H. Option C directly relates to the scientific value, which is one of the prongs in the Miller test. If the materials are serious scientific studies, they would have legitimate value, making them protected. Option H could affect the 'patently offensive' part, but the main issue is whether the material is obscene. If it's for scientific purposes, it's more likely to be protected regardless of community standards on offense.

So, the best option would be C because it directly negates the obscenity by showing it has serious value, thus making it protected speech.

The best option is C because it directly shows that the materials have serious scientific value, which would make them protected under the First Amendment as non-obscene.
