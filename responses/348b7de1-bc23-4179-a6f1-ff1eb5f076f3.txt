The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order

Options:

A: valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.
B: valid, because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergency relief efforts.
C: invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.
D: invalid, because the executive order did not specify the scope of the relief operations.
E: invalid, because the executive order infringes upon the rights of federal employees.
F: invalid, because the INS does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries.
G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.
H: valid, because the president's executive power extends to directing federal agencies in times of crisis.
I: valid, because the President has the power to issue executive orders in times of emergency.
J: invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the validity of an executive order issued by the President. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a foreign country has been hit by a devastating earthquake. The leader there asks the U.S. for help. The President wants to send troops but they're on maneuvers, so he issues an executive order to a federal agency under the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to send their people for rescue operations. The member of this agency refuses, saying it's beyond his job duties, and sues.

I need to determine if the court should rule the executive order as valid or invalid. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I should recall the basics of executive orders and the President's powers. The President's authority is derived from the Constitution, particularly Article II. The President is the head of the executive branch and has certain powers, including command of the military as the commander-in-chief. However, the President can't just issue orders outside of the scope of what's allowed by law.

The INS, now known as ICE, is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Its main role is to enforce immigration laws, which involves patrolling borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering. So, the federal agency in question here is focused on domestic border control, not international relief.

The President's executive order is directing these border patrol agents to engage in emergency rescue operations abroad. The member argues this is beyond his job. So, the issue is whether the President can repurpose federal agencies for such emergency efforts without congressional approval.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's valid because the President, as commander-in-chief, has unfettered authority. But the agency in question isn't part of the military; it's under INS. So, maybe A is incorrect because the commander-in-chief role applies more to the military, not other federal agencies unless they're being called into service.

Option B says it's valid because the President can repurpose agencies for emergency relief. I'm not sure about this; I think the President's ability to repurpose agencies might require some form of authorization, either through existing laws or appropriations by Congress.

Option C claims it's invalid because it's beyond presidential power without Congress. This seems plausible because the President can't just create new duties for federal agencies without legislative backing. The agencies have specific functions as defined by law, and the President can't change that without Congress.

Option D is about the order not specifying scope. That seems more like a procedural issue, but the question is about the President's authority, not the order's vagueness.

Option E says it's invalid because it infringes on federal employees' rights. But employees generally have to follow lawful orders. If the order is unlawful, then it's the order that's invalid, not necessarily infringing on rights per se.

Option F says it's invalid because INS lacks jurisdiction abroad. That might be a point, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The question is more about whether the President can direct them, not about their jurisdiction.

Option G says it's valid because employees can be required for emergency functions. But if the agency's main function is border patrol, can the President expand their role? Without Congress, maybe not.

Option H states it's valid because the President's power extends to directing agencies in crises. This seems to suggest broad emergency powers, but I'm not sure if that's accurate without specific authorization.

Option I says it's valid because the President can issue executive orders in emergencies. While the President does have emergency powers, they are usually subject to existing legal frameworks and sometimes require congressional approval for extraordinary measures.

Option J claims it's invalid because the INS director, not the President, issues directives. That might be a point about chain of command, but the President can direct the agency as part of the executive branch.

Putting it together, the key issue is whether the President can use a federal agency for a purpose beyond its statutory mandate. The Supreme Court has held that the President's powers are not absolute and are limited by Congress's allocations. For example, in the case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the Court ruled that the President couldn't seize steel mills because it was beyond his authority under the law.

In this case, the INS agency's primary function isn't international disaster relief. The President's executive order is directing them to perform a task outside their usual duties. Without explicit congressional authorization, this might exceed the President's authority. So, the executive order would likely be invalid because it's beyond the scope of presidential power without such authorization.

Looking at the options again, option C says exactly that: invalid because it's beyond presidential power without congressional authorization. That fits with the Youngstown precedent.

The court should rule the executive order invalid because it exceeds the President's authority without congressional approval. The INS agency's main role is border patrol, not international relief, and the President cannot repurpose federal agencies beyond their statutory duties without legislative backing.

C
