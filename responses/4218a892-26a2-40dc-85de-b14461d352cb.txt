Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. Simon used 3 pears and 9 apples to make a fruit salad. The question is asking for the ratio of the number of pears to the number of apples in the fruit salad. The options are given from A to J, each with different ratios.

Hmm, ratios. Right. Ratios compare two quantities. In this case, pears to apples. So first, I need to identify how many pears and apples were used. The problem says Simon used 3 pears and 9 apples. So the numbers are 3 and 9.

When expressing a ratio, it's usually in the form of two numbers separated by a colon, like 1:2, which means 1 part of the first thing to 2 parts of the second. So here, the first number is pears, and the second is apples. So it's 3 pears to 9 apples. 

Wait, but ratios can often be simplified. Let me think. 3 and 9 have a common factor. Both are divisible by 3. So if I divide both by 3, I get 1 and 3. So the simplified ratio is 1:3. That would mean for every pear, there are three apples.

Looking at the options, which one matches 1:3? Let's look at the options: A is 1:02, which is 1:2. B is 1:06, which is 1:6. C is 1:03, which is 1:3. So that's the one I was thinking. D is 2:09, which is 2:9. E is 3:01, which is 3:1, the reverse of what we want. F is 1:09, which is 1:9. G is 1:04, which is 1:4. H is 1:05, 1:5. I is 3:09, which simplifies to 1:3 as well because 3 divided by 3 is 1, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So I is also 1:3. Wait, so both C and I are 1:3?

Wait, let me check the options again. Option I is 3:09. So 3 to 9. Well, 3:9 simplifies to 1:3, same as C. So both C and I are correct? But that can't be right because in multiple-choice questions, usually only one answer is correct. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of pears to apples. So it's pears first, then apples. So the ratio is 3:9, which simplifies to 1:3. So in the options, both C and I present 1:3 in different forms. C is 1:03, which is 1:3. I is 3:09, which is 3:9, which also simplifies to 1:3.

But in the options, I think the way they're presented is important. The question is about the ratio of pears to apples, so 3:9 is correct, but when simplified, it's 1:3. So the possible correct answers are both I and C, but maybe I is the direct ratio without simplifying, and C is the simplified form.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether to simplify or not. It just asks for the ratio. So both 3:9 and 1:3 are correct ratios. But looking at the options, let me see:

Option I is 3:09, which is the actual ratio used (3 pears to 9 apples). Option C is 1:03, the simplified version.

In math problems, sometimes the answer expects the simplified form, and sometimes it expects the original numbers. I need to check the options again. Let me list them:

A: 1:02 (1:2)
B: 1:06 (1:6)
C: 1:03 (1:3)
D: 2:09 (2:9)
E: 3:01 (3:1)
F: 1:09 (1:9)
G: 1:04 (1:4)
H: 1:05 (1:5)
I: 3:09 (3:9)
J: 4:09 (4:9)

So both C and I are possible correct answers, but in the options, only one can be correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

If the question is asking for the ratio as it is, without simplification, then 3:9 is the correct ratio, which is option I. But if they want it simplified, then it's 1:3, option C.

But usually, when a ratio is asked, it's expected to be simplified unless stated otherwise. So perhaps the answer is C. But I'm not entirely sure because both I and C are correct depending on whether to simplify or not.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Is there any option that is 3:9? Yes, option I is 3:09, which is 3:9. So if the problem doesn't specify simplifying, then I is correct. But in most cases, ratios are given in their simplest form. So maybe the answer is C.

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of the number of pears to the number of apples." So the numbers are 3 and 9. So the ratio is 3:9, which simplifies to 1:3. So both are correct, but which option is presented as such.

Looking back at the options, option I is 3:09, which is the same as 3:9, which is the same as 1:3. So both I and C are correct, but in the options, only one is presented. Maybe I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are labeled from A to J. Let me make sure I'm reading them correctly. Option I is 3:09, which is 3:9. So that's correct. Option C is 1:03, which is 1:3, also correct.

But in the options, only one can be the correct answer. Maybe the question expects the ratio in the simplest form, so the answer is C. Alternatively, if the ratio is to be expressed in the actual numbers used, then I is correct. 

Wait, the problem says Simon used 3 pears and 9 apples. So the actual ratio is 3:9, which is 1:3. So both I and C are correct, but perhaps the options list I as 3:09 and C as 1:03. So depending on whether to simplify, both are correct, but the problem might expect the simplified version, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented as they are, and the correct one is I because it's the direct count.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The ratio is pears to apples, which is 3:9. Simplifying that gives 1:3. So both are correct. But in the options, both I and C present correct ratios, but in different forms.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option I is 3:09. That's 3 to 9, which is correct. Option C is 1:03, which is 1:3, also correct.

In the options, both are present. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in the form that directly uses the numbers given, so 3:9, which is option I.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the ratio in the simplest terms, so 1:3, which is option C.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of how ratios are typically presented. Usually, they are simplified unless specified otherwise. So the correct ratio would be 1:3, which is option C.

Wait, but in the options, I is 3:09, which is the same as 3:9, which is also correct. So maybe both are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the unsimplified version, so I is the answer.

Wait, but in the options, C is 1:03, which is 1:3. I is 3:09, which is 3:9. Both are correct ratios, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in the simplest form, so C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the options are presented matters. Let me check the options again:

A: 1:02
B: 1:06
C: 1:03
D: 2:09
E: 3:01
F: 1:09
G: 1:04
H: 1:05
I: 3:09
J: 4:09

So, the options are presented as 1:02, etc. So C is 1:03, which is 1:3, and I is 3:09, which is 3:9. Both are correct, but the problem might expect the simplest form, so C is the answer.

But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes the ratio is expected to be in the original numbers. Wait, let me think of another approach. The ratio of pears to apples is 3:9. If we divide both by 3, we get 1:3. So both are correct. But in the options, both are present.

Wait, perhaps the answer expects the ratio in the form of pears to apples without simplifying, so 3:9, which is option I. Alternatively, if simplified, it's 1:3, option C.

I think I need to decide which one is more likely the correct answer. Since the problem didn't specify whether to simplify, but in math problems, unless told otherwise, ratios are usually simplified. So I think the answer is C: 1:03.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check with an example. If someone has 3 pears and 9 apples, the ratio of pears to apples is 3:9, which simplifies to 1:3. So both are correct, but the simplified form is more precise.

So, in the options, both C and I are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C because it's the simplified version.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio in the actual numbers used, so 3:9, which is option I.

Wait, but 3:9 is the same as 1:3. So both are correct. But since the options include both, perhaps the answer is I because it's the exact ratio, and C is the simplified version.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I think the answer is C:1:03 because that's the simplified ratio.

The ratio of pears to apples is 3:9, which simplifies to 1:3. Therefore, the correct answer is C:1:03.

Answer: C
