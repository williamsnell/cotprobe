Question:

A married couple sued a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract in failing to live up to promises he made regarding the couple's purchase of a residence. They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn't pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is admissible  even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.
B: The testimony is admissible because the agent's statement is considered a present sense impression.
C: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered hearsay within hearsay.
D: The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.
E: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by the broker's employee during the course and within the scope of employment.
F: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is not an exception to the hearsay rule.
G: The testimony is admissible because it is a statement made by a co-conspirator during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.
I: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.
J: The testimony is inadmissible because the agent's statement is considered a past recollection recorded.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the agent's testimony about what the broker said is admissible. The couple is suing the broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract because the broker promised a $15k rebate that didn't happen. At trial, the couple subpoenaed the broker's agent, who testified that he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected, saying it's hearsay.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So if the agent is testifying about what the broker said, that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Let me think about the exceptions. One is the statement against interest, but that's not the case here. Another is the present sense impression, but that applies to statements made while perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. Here, the agent was in a meeting, so maybe it's a present sense impression? Or perhaps a declaration against interest?

Wait, the agent is testifying about what the broker said. The broker is a party to the case, so if the statement is an admission by a party opponent, that's an exception. I think under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that employment and while it existed.

So the agent is testifying that he heard the broker make the promise. The broker is the opposing party. The agent was acting within the scope of his employment as the broker's agent. So the statement would be a party admission, which is admissible as an exception to hearsay.

Looking at the options, option D says "the testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment." That seems right.

Option E says it's a statement made by the broker's employee during the course and within the scope of employment. But E is phrased differently; it's more about agency but not explicitly as a party admission. D is more precise because it mentions party admission, which is the exception.

Other options: A says it's admissible because the broker is available. But availability isn't the reason for admitting hearsay. Hearsay is allowed only if an exception applies, regardless of availability. So A is probably incorrect.

Option C says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay within hearsay. Wait, the agent heard the broker say it. So the agent's testimony is about the broker's statement. That's one level of hearsay: the agent's testimony is about the broker's statement. But since the broker is a party, the statement is a party admission, so it's not hearsay. So C is incorrect because it's not hearsay within hearsay; it's one level, and an exception applies.

Option H says it's inadmissible because it's pure hearsay. But if it's a party admission, then it's not hearsay. So H is incorrect.

Option I says the agent wasn't authorized to speak for the principal. But in this case, the agent was present in a meeting with the buyers and heard the broker make the statement. The agent is testifying about what he heard, not speaking on behalf of the broker. So I think I is incorrect because the agent was acting within his role as an employee, and the statement is attributable to the broker.

So the correct answer is D.

The court is likely to decide that the agent's testimony is admissible because it falls under the exception of a party admission. The broker, as the opposing party, made the statement through his authorized agent during the scope of employment. This makes the testimony admissible under the hearsay exception for party admissions. 

Answer: D
