Okay, so I've got this question about Erikson's stages of psychosocial development and how they relate to Freud's stages. The question is asking which of Erikson's stages corresponds to Freud's phallic stage in terms of age.

First, I remember that Freud's theory includes the oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages. The phallic stage is the third one, I think, and it's usually associated with children aged 3 to 6 years old. During this stage, Freud believed that children's libidinal focus is on their genitals, and there's a lot of exploration and play around that area.

Now, turning to Erikson. He had eight stages, each with a crisis that involves a conflict between two opposing traits. I need to match each of his stages with the corresponding Freudian stage. I remember that Erikson's stages are organized by age, so I can try to line them up.

Let me list out what I remember about each of Erikson's stages:

1. **Trust vs. Mistrust** (Infant, 0-1.5 years)
2. **Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt** (Toddler, 1.5-3 years)
3. **Initiative vs. Guilt** (Preschool, 3-6 years)
4. **Industry vs. Inferiority** (School-age, 6-12 years)
5. **Identity vs. Role Confusion** (Adolescence, 12-20 years)
6. **Intimacy vs. Isolation** (Young adulthood, 20-25 years)
7. **Generativity vs. Stagnation** (Middle adulthood, 30-60 years)
8. **Ego Integrity vs. Despair** (Old age)

Wait, so the phallic stage is 3-6 years, right? Looking at Erikson's stages, the third stage is **Initiative vs. Guilt**, which fits the 3-6 age range. So that must correspond to Freud's phallic stage.

Let me check the options given:

A: Identity vs. role confusion (adolescence)
B: Autonomy vs. shame and doubt (1.5-3)
C: Ego integrity vs. despair (old age)
D: Intimacy vs. isolation (young adult)
E: Industry vs. inferiority (6-12)
F: Industry vs. guilt (doesn't exactly match)
G: Initiative vs. guilt (3-6)
H: Basic trust vs. mistrust (infant)
I: Autonomy vs. mistrust (doesn't sound right)
J: Generativity vs. stagnation (middle age)

So the correct answer should be G: Initiative vs. Guilt.

The phallic stage in Freud's theory corresponds to children aged 3-6 years. Erikson's third stage, **Initiative vs. Guilt**, aligns with this age range and addresses the conflict during this period. 

Answer: G
