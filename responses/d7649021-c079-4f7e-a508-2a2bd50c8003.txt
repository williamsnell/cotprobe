Okay, so I've got this question about Hobbes and his definition of injustice. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that Thomas Hobbes was all about the social contract and the Leviathan. His main idea was that people are self-interested and that society needs a sovereign to keep everyone in check.

The question is asking what Hobbes defines as injustice. The options are A to J. Let me go through each one and see which fits.

Option A: Not adhering to societal norms. Hmm, Hobbes does talk about societal norms, but I think he's more specific than that. He's not just against any norm; it's more about breaking the social contract.

Option B: Being dishonest in any situation. Dishonesty is a vice, but I'm not sure if Hobbes defines injustice that broadly. He might see it as a failure to keep covenants, which is more specific than just dishonesty.

Option C: Failure to perform one’s covenant. Oh, right, Hobbes was big on covenants. He believed that the social contract was the foundation of society. If you don't keep your part of the covenant, that's a breach of the social contract, which would be unjust. That sounds promising.

Option D: Treating another person as a mere means. That sounds more like Kant's idea of the categorical imperative, where you shouldn't treat people as means to an end. Hobbes doesn't focus on that; he's more about the consequences and the contract.

Option E: Manipulating others for personal gain. Manipulation is a form of deceit, but again, I think Hobbes is more about breaking the contract rather than just manipulating.

Option F: Behaving immorally. While Hobbes does talk about moral behavior, his concept of injustice is more tied to the breaking of covenants rather than general immorality.

Option G: Violating a law of nature. Laws of nature in Hobbes' sense are more about self-preservation and survival. Injustice is more about the social contract.

Option H: Disregarding the rights of others. Rights are a part of it, but I think Hobbes is more about the explicit breaking of the covenant, which is a specific agreement.

Option I: Taking more than one’s share of a good. That sounds like a breach of the social contract, but I'm not sure if that's how Hobbes defines it. Maybe, but I think the key is the covenant.

Option J: Acting against the will of the sovereign. While Hobbes does emphasize the sovereign's authority, acting against the sovereign's will is more about rebellion, which is a form of injustice, but I think the broader definition is about failing to keep covenants.

So, putting it all together, Hobbes defines injustice as failing to perform one’s covenant because the covenant is the basis of the social contract that holds society together. Without keeping the covenant, there's no justice because everyone is in a state of nature, which is war of all against all.

The correct answer is C: failure to perform one’s covenant. Hobbes defines injustice as breaking the social contract, which is the covenant that individuals make to live peacefully under a sovereign authority. This failure disrupts the harmony and order of society, which is central to Hobbes' philosophy.

Answer: C
