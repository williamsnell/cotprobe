Okay, so I have this question about when the idea of 'natural law' first appeared. The options are A through D, with each corresponding to different historical events or periods. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what 'natural law' means. From what I remember, natural law refers to the idea that certain principles of law are inherent in human nature or the universe, and these laws are discoverable through reason. It's often contrasted with laws that are made by humans, like statutory laws.

Now, looking at the options:

A: French Revolution - That was in the late 18th century. The revolution was about political and social changes, but I'm not sure if natural law originated there. Maybe it influenced some of their ideas, but I think natural law is older.

B: American War of Independence - Also in the late 18th century, around the same time as the French Revolution. The American colonists used ideas like natural rights, which might relate to natural law, but again, I think the concept is much older.

C: Roman Law - The Romans had a well-developed legal system, and I recall that Roman jurists discussed natural law. For example, Cicero talked about ius naturale, which translates to natural law. So this seems like a strong candidate.

D: Greek Thinking - The Greeks, especially philosophers like Aristotle, discussed various concepts, including justice and law. I'm not sure if they explicitly formulated the idea of natural law as it was later developed, but they might have laid some groundwork.

So, putting it together: Natural law as a concept likely originated with the Greeks, but the term and more formalized ideas might have come from the Romans. Wait, but the question is about when the idea first appeared. The Greeks, particularly philosophers like Heraclitus or Aristotle, discussed natural principles, but I think the Romans were the first to codify the idea of natural law as a legal concept.

Therefore, the answer is probably C: Roman Law.

The idea of 'natural law' first appeared in Roman Law, particularly through Roman jurists like Cicero, who discussed the concept of ius naturale.
