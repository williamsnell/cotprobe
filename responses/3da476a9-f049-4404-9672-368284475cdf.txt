Question:

A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because, she says, "I'm burning up." Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use. Physical examination discloses a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. An expected physical finding will be which of the following?

Options:

A: Decreased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
B: Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
C: Increased intensity of S1
D: Decreased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
E: Positive JVP (rise in jugular venous pulse) with expiration
F: No change in the intensity of the murmur with breathing changes
G: Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
H: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
I: Negative Kussmaul sign (no rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
J: Decreased intensity of S1

Okay, so I have this medical question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a 19-year-old woman who comes to the emergency department complaining of feeling like she's burning up. Her medical history includes intravenous drug use. On physical exam, she has a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. The question is asking which physical finding is expected in this scenario.

The options are from A to J, each describing a different physical sign related to the murmur or other cardiovascular findings.

First, I need to think about what causes a systolic heart murmur. Systolic murmurs occur between the first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) and can be innocent or due to various pathological conditions. Given her history of IV drug use, I'm immediately thinking about possible infections, like endocarditis, which can cause valvular abnormalities leading to murmurs.

IV drug use is a major risk factor for infective endocarditis, especially affecting the tricuspid valve because the blood supply to the right side of the heart is more dependent on collateral circulation, making it more susceptible to infection. So, tricuspid valve endocarditis would likely cause a systolic murmur.

Now, I should consider the physical exam findings associated with tricuspid insufficiency or regurgitation. In tricuspid regurgitation, the murmur is typically pansystolic, meaning it starts at S1 and continues throughout systole. It's often associated with other signs like hepatomegaly, jugular venous distension, and edema due to right-sided heart failure.

One key physical sign is the change in the intensity of the murmur with respiration. In right-sided murmurs, such as tricuspid regurgitation, the intensity of the murmur often increases with expiration. This is because expiration increases intrathoracic pressure, which can accentuate the regurgitant flow. So, when the patient expires (breathes out), the murmur becomes more intense.

Looking at the options:

A: Decreased intensity with deep inspiration. That's more typical of aortic stenosis or sclerosis, where inspiration decreases venous return, lessening the murmur.

B: Increased intensity with forced expiration. This fits with tricuspid regurgitation because expiration increases venous return to the right side, making the murmur louder.

C: Increased intensity of S1. I'm not sure about that; S1 intensity is usually related to the mitral and aortic valves, not so much the tricuspid.

D: Decreased intensity with forced expiration. Opposite of what I think.

E: Positive JVP with expiration. A positive JVP rise with expiration is seen in right-sided heart failure, which can be associated with tricuspid regurgitation. But the question is about the murmur's intensity.

F: No change with breathing. Some murmurs don't vary, but tricuspid murmurs usually do.

G: Positive Kussmaul sign (JVP rise with inspiration). Kussmaul sign is more about restrictive pericarditis, where JVP rises with inspiration. Not directly about the murmur.

H: Increased intensity with deep inspiration. Inspiration usually decreases venous return, so for right-sided murmurs, expiration should increase it, not inspiration.

I: Negative Kussmaul sign. Not directly relevant to the murmur.

J: Decreased intensity of S1. Not sure, but S1 is the first heart sound, and I don't think it's directly linked here.

So the key point here is that in tricuspid regurgitation, the murmur becomes more intense with expiration. So the correct option would be B: Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another thought: In some cases, especially when there's significant regurgitation, the murmur might be so intense that it doesn't vary much, but generally, tricuspid murmurs do increase with expiration. Also, in cases of aortic stenosis, the murmur decreases with expiration because of decreased preload.

So yes, B seems correct.

The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use, presenting with a systolic heart murmur. Given her history, infective endocarditis affecting the tricuspid valve is a likely consideration, leading to tricuspid regurgitation. In tricuspid regurgitation, the systolic murmur increases in intensity with expiration due to increased venous return to the right side of the heart. Among the options, the correct physical finding is increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration.

Answer: B
