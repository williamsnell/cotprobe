Okay, so I need to figure out when early email was developed. I remember that email has been around for a while, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact decade. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that computers have been around since the mid-20th century, but email as we know it today probably came later. I think the 1960s might be a good starting point because that's when a lot of computer technology was advancing. I've heard of the ARPANET project, which was in the 1960s, and that was related to early internet and email developments. ARPANET was the precursor to the internet, and I believe it's where the concept of sending messages between different computers started.

Wait, but was email actually developed before ARPANET? Or was it part of ARPANET? I think it was around the same time. The first message sent over ARPANET was in 1969, but email as a concept might have been earlier. Maybe in the 1960s, people started experimenting with sending messages between computers.

Looking at the options, E is the 1960s, and that seems to fit. But I should double-check. I remember that the 1970s saw a lot of development in computer networking, including protocols like SMTP for email. So maybe the actual implementation of email systems became more widespread in the 70s. But the question is about when early email was developed, so the initial development might have been in the 60s.

Wait, another thought: the first email, as in the first instance of electronic mail, was sent in 1965 by a computer engineer named Tom Van Vleck. He used a time-sharing system to send a message to another user on the same computer. So that would be in the 1960s. So the development of the concept and the first email was in the 60s.

But then, the more structured email systems and protocols like ARPANET's SNDMSG were developed in the 70s. So the 70s might be when it became more established. But the question is about when early email was developed, so the initial development would be the 60s.

Let me check the options again. E is 1960s, G is 1970s. So if the first email was in 1965, that's 60s. But if the system that we recognize as email started in 70s, then maybe 70s is the answer. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, another angle: the question says "early email", so the initial development. So the 1960s would be the answer because that's when the first emails were sent. The 1970s would be when it became more standardized and widely used, but the development started in the 60s.

So I think the correct answer is E: 1960s.
