Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says there's a charge distribution that's spherically symmetric but not uniform radially. That means the charge isn't spread out evenly in all directions from the center, but the symmetry is still spherical—so any point on the surface of a sphere around the center would have the same charge properties. The electric field produced by this distribution is given as E = K r^4, and it's directed radially outward. K is a constant, and r is the radial distance from the center. The task is to find the volume charge density rho.

Hmm, I remember that for electric fields in spherical symmetry, Gauss's Law is probably the way to go. Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by epsilon_0. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, and Φ is the electric field E multiplied by the area A of the Gaussian surface.

Since the charge distribution is spherically symmetric, the Gaussian surface should be a sphere of radius r. The electric field is radial and has the same magnitude at every point on this surface, so the flux is E * 4πr².

So, Gauss's Law gives me E * 4πr² = Q_enc / ε₀. I can rearrange that to find Q_enc = ε₀ E * 4π r².

Plugging in E = K r^4, that becomes Q_enc = ε₀ * K r^4 *4π r². Wait, no, wait: E is K r^4, so substituting:

Q_enc = ε₀ * E * 4π r² = ε₀ * (K r^4) * 4π r². Wait, that would be 4π ε₀ K r^6? Because r^4 times r² is r^6. Hmm, wait, no. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, E is K r^4, so E * 4π r² is K r^4 *4π r² = 4π K r^6. So Q_enc = ε₀ * 4π K r^6.

So Q_enc = 4π ε₀ K r^6. Now, I need to find the charge enclosed within radius r, Q_enc, in terms of the volume charge density rho.

The enclosed charge is the integral of rho over the volume of the sphere. For a spherical charge distribution, that's the integral from 0 to r of rho(r') * 4π r'^2 dr'. Because volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r'^2 dr'.

But wait, the problem is that rho might not be uniform, but it's spherically symmetric, so the charge density rho depends only on r, not on the direction. That's good because we can model it as a function rho(r).

So, Q_enc = ∫ (from 0 to r) rho(r') * 4π r'^2 dr'.

But wait, since rho might be a function of r, I can write Q_enc as the integral of rho(r) * 4π r'^2 dr' from 0 to r.

But in the problem, we have Q_enc as 4π ε₀ K r^6. So I can set up the equation:

∫ (from 0 to r) rho(r') * 4π r'^2 dr' = 4π ε₀ K r^6.

Hmm, I can simplify this equation. Let's divide both sides by 4π to get:

∫ (from 0 to r) rho(r') r'^2 dr' = ε₀ K r^6.

Now, I need to find rho(r) such that when I integrate rho(r') r'^2 dr' from 0 to r, I get ε₀ K r^6.

Wait, but this would be the case if rho(r) * r^2 is a function whose integral is ε₀ K r^6. So perhaps I can take the derivative of both sides with respect to r to find rho(r).

Let me think: if I differentiate both sides with respect to r, using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the left side becomes rho(r) * r^2. The right side, when differentiated, would be d/dr [ ε₀ K r^6 ] = 6 ε₀ K r^5.

So, rho(r) * r^2 = 6 ε₀ K r^5.

Then, rho(r) = [6 ε₀ K r^5 ] / r^2 = 6 ε₀ K r^3.

Wait, that seems right. So rho(r) = 6 ε₀ K r^3.

Looking at the options, I see option G is 6 K ε₀ r^3, which matches what I found. But wait, I should double-check my steps.

Wait, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Start with E = K r^4, radial outward.

2. Apply Gauss's Law: E * 4π r² = Q_enc / ε₀ → Q_enc = ε₀ E 4π r².

3. Substitute E: Q_enc = ε₀ * (K r^4) *4π r² = 4π ε₀ K r^6.

4. Express Q_enc as the integral of rho(r') over the volume of the sphere: ∫ (from 0 to r) rho(r') 4π r'^2 dr' = 4π ε₀ K r^6.

5. Divide both sides by 4π: ∫ (rho(r') r'^2) dr' from 0 to r = ε₀ K r^6.

6. Take derivative with respect to r: rho(r) r^2 = d/dr [ ε₀ K r^6 ] = 6 ε₀ K r^5.

7. Solve for rho(r): rho(r) = (6 ε₀ K r^5) / r^2 = 6 ε₀ K r^3.

Yes, that looks correct. So the charge density rho is 6 ε₀ K r^3.

Looking at the options, option G is 6 K ε₀ r^3, which matches. Therefore, the answer should be option G.

The problem involves determining the volume charge density $\rho$ for a spherically symmetric charge distribution that produces an electric field $E = K r^4$. Using Gauss's Law, the enclosed charge $Q_{\text{enc}}$ is found by integrating the electric field over a spherical Gaussian surface of radius $r$. This gives $Q_{\text{enc}} = 4\pi \varepsilon_0 K r^6$. By expressing $Q_{\text{enc}}$ as the integral of $\rho(r) r^2$ over the volume of the sphere and differentiating with respect to $r$, the charge density is determined to be $\rho(r) = 6 K \varepsilon_0 r^3$. This matches option G.
