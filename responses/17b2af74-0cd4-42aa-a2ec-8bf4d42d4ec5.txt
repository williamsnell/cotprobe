Okay, so I need to figure out what a value-added tax is. I remember hearing the term before, probably in an economics class or something. Let me think. Value-added tax... I think it's related to how much value is added at each stage of production. Wait, isn't VAT a type of tax that's applied to the difference between the cost of goods sold and the selling price? Like, it's not just a simple sales tax on the final product.

Let me look at the options. Option A says it's only on raw materials. That doesn't sound right because VAT is broader than that. Option B is about luxury items, but I don't think VAT is limited to just luxuries; it's more general. Option C talks about deducting from sales revenue, which might be similar to something like a turnover tax, but I'm not sure. Option D is a progressive corporate tax, which doesn't fit because VAT is usually a flat rate. Option E is a tax on the final selling price, which sounds more like a regular sales tax. 

Option F says it's a sales tax applied uniformly at a single stage. Hmm, that might be close, but I think VAT is applied at each stage, not just once. Option G is about imported goods only, which isn't correct because VAT applies to all goods and services. Option H is an income tax, so that's not it. Option I says it's a tax collected at each stage based on value added. That rings a bell. Each business only pays tax on the value they add, which is the difference between their output and their inputs. So each stage—like manufacturing, wholesale, retail—pays VAT on the amount they add. 

Option J is a tax on the total value, which sounds more like a sales tax on the final price, not the added value. So I think option I is the correct one because it captures the idea of adding tax at each production stage based on the value added. That makes sense because it prevents double taxation and ensures that each business only pays on what they contribute to the product's value.

The correct answer is I: A tax collected at each stage of production based on the value added. This aligns with the concept of VAT, where tax is applied incrementally at each stage, reflecting the value added by each participant in the production chain.
