Okay, so I've got this problem about boiling points and molecular weight. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on colligative properties, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that the normal boiling point of benzene is 80.10°C. When 1 mole of a solute is dissolved in 1000 g of benzene, the boiling point goes up to 82.73°C. Then, when 1.2 g of elemental sulfur is dissolved in 50 g of benzene, the boiling point increases to 80.36°C. I need to find the molecular weight of sulfur.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Benzene's normal boiling point is 80.10°C. When you add 1 mole of solute to 1000 g of benzene, the boiling point becomes 82.73. So the elevation is 82.73 - 80.10 = 2.63°C.

But then, when 1.2 g of sulfur is dissolved in 50 g of benzene, the boiling point is 80.36, which is only a 0.26°C increase. Hmm, so the elevation is way less than the first case. That suggests that the solute in the second case has a lower molality, maybe because sulfur has a higher molecular weight, so fewer moles are present.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. The elevation in boiling point is related to the molality of the solute. The formula is ΔTb = Kb * m, where m is molality, and Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for benzene.

So first, I'll calculate Kb. Using the first scenario: 1 mole of solute in 1000 g benzene. So molality m = moles / kg solvent = 1 / 1 = 1 m.

ΔTb is 2.63°C, so Kb = ΔTb / m = 2.63 / 1 = 2.63 K·kg/mol.

Now, using the second scenario: 1.2 g of sulfur in 50 g benzene. So the mass of solvent is 0.050 kg. The molality m here is (1.2 g / MW) / 0.050 kg. But the ΔTb is 0.26°C. So using Kb=2.63, set up the equation:

0.26 = 2.63 * [(1.2 / MW) / 0.050]

Let me solve for MW. Rearranging:

(1.2 / MW) = (0.26 / 2.63) * 0.050

Calculate 0.26 / 2.63 first. 0.26 ÷ 2.63 ≈ 0.09886.

Multiply by 0.050 kg: 0.09886 * 0.050 ≈ 0.004943.

So 1.2 / MW = 0.004943 → MW = 1.2 / 0.004943 ≈ 242.7 g/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option E is 240 g/mol, which is close. Hmm. Did I do the calculations right?

Wait, let me check the steps again. The second solution has 1.2 g sulfur in 50 g benzene. So m = (1.2 / MW) / 0.050.

So plugging into ΔTb = Kb * m:

ΔTb = 2.63 * (1.2/(MW * 0.050)).

But wait, the ΔTb here is 80.36 -80.10 = 0.26°C, correct.

So 0.26 = 2.63 * (1.2/(MW * 0.050)).

Let me rearrange:

(1.2)/(MW * 0.050) = 0.26 / 2.63.

0.26 /2.63 is approximately 0.09886.

So 1.2 / (0.050 * MW) = 0.09886 → 1.2 = 0.050 * MW * 0.09886 → 1.2 = MW * 0.004943 → MW = 1.2 / 0.004943 ≈ 242.7.

Hmm, but the options don't have 243. The closest is E:240. So maybe I made a rounding error. Let me calculate more accurately.

Compute 0.26 / 2.63 exactly. 0.26 ÷ 2.63.

Let me compute 2.63 * 0.09885 = 0.26. So 0.09885.

Multiply by 0.050: 0.09885 * 0.050 = 0.0049425.

So 1.2 / MW = 0.0049425 → MW = 1.2 / 0.0049425 ≈ 242.7, so 243 g/mol.

But the options don't have that. Looking back, the options are A:180, B:420, C:600, D:300, E:240, F:480, G:90, H:150, I:120, J:360.

So the closest is E:240. But wait, the actual molecular weight of sulfur is about 32 g/mol. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait no, wait—the problem says "elemental sulfur." Oh wait, wait, no, elemental sulfur is S8, I think. So molecular weight is 8*32=256 g/mol. Hmm, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me check all steps again.

In the first part, when 1 mole is dissolved in 1000g benzene, so m = 1/1 =1 m. ΔTb=2.63, so Kb=2.63.

In the second case, 1.2g S in 50g benzene. So m = (1.2 / MW) / 0.050.

ΔTb = Kb * m → 0.26 = 2.63 * [(1.2)/(0.050 * MW)].

So (1.2)/(0.050 * MW) = 0.26 / 2.63 → 0.09886.

So 1.2 = 0.050 * MW * 0.09886 → 1.2 = 0.004943 * MW → MW = 1.2 / 0.004943 ≈ 242.7.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I need to recheck.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the masses. Let me see:

Wait, wait, in the second part, the solution's boiling point is 80.36, which is 0.26 above the pure benzene's 80.10. So yes, ΔTb=0.26.

So the calculation seems correct. So maybe the answer is E:240, which is the closest option to 242.7.

But wait, wait a minute. Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula with moles correctly. So elemental sulfur is S8, so each molecule is S8, which has a molecular weight of 8*32=256 g/mol. But 256 isn't an option. Wait, but the options don't include 256. So perhaps the problem is treating sulfur as S, so molecular weight 32, but that would give a much higher molality, which would cause a higher ΔTb, but in the problem, the ΔTb is lower, which would imply a lower molality.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the way the problem is presented. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Wait, in the first part, 1 mole of solute in 1000g of benzene. So the molality is 1 mole per kg. ΔTb is 2.63, so Kb=2.63.

In the second part, 1.2g of S in 50g benzene. So the molality m is (1.2g / MW) / 0.050 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should not have used the same Kb, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb.

Wait, let me recalculate Kb properly. Kb = ΔTb / m.

In the first case, m = 1/1 =1 m. ΔTb=2.63, so Kb=2.63 K·kg/mol.

In the second case, the solution's ΔTb is 0.26, so using Kb=2.63, we have m = ΔTb / Kb = 0.26 / 2.63 ≈ 0.09886 m.

So m = (1.2 / MW) / 0.050 = 0.09886 → (1.2)/(0.050 * MW) = 0.09886 → 1.2 = 0.050 * 0.09886 * MW → 1.2 = 0.004943 * MW → MW=1.2 / 0.004943 ≈242.7 g/mol.

But the options don't have 243. So maybe the correct option is E:240. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.26 divided by 2.63 more accurately. Let me do that:

0.26 ÷ 2.63 = ?

Well, 2.63 × 0.098 = 0.25774 → which is close to 0.26, so 0.0988.

So 0.0988 is the m.

So (1.2 / MW) / 0.050 = 0.0988 → 1.2 / (0.050 * MW) = 0.0988 → 1.2 = 0.00494 * MW → MW = 1.2 / 0.00494 ≈ 242.8.

Hmm. So none of the options exactly match, but E is 240. Maybe the problem expects rounding to the nearest hundred. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait another angle: maybe the solution is using molality correctly, but perhaps the solvent's mass is in kg. Wait, in the second case, 50g is 0.050 kg. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different Kb. Wait, what's the actual Kb for benzene? I'm not sure, but the problem gives us Kb via the first scenario, so it's 2.63.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula differently. Let me think about the formula again. The formula is:

ΔTb = i * Kb * m

Where i is the van't Hoff factor, the number of particles the solute dissociates into. For elemental sulfur, which is S8, each molecule would dissociate into 8 S atoms, so i=8. Oh! Wait, that's a crucial point I might have missed.

Wait, so in the first case, the solute is 1 mole, but if it's a non-electrolyte that doesn't dissociate, i=1. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. But in the first case, when 1 mole is dissolved, the ΔTb is 2.63, which suggests i=1, so Kb=2.63.

In the second case, if the solute is S8, which dissociates into 8 S atoms, then i=8. So the molality m would be for the solute as (moles of S8) / kg solvent.

Wait, but wait—the way the problem is written, when 1 mole of a solute is dissolved, it's likely a non-electrolyte, so i=1. So Kb=2.63.

But in the second case, sulfur is S8, which would dissociate into 8 particles, so i=8. So the formula would be ΔTb = i * Kb * m.

Wait, but in the problem statement, when 1.2g of sulfur is dissolved, the solution's ΔTb is 0.26. So perhaps I should include i=8.

Wait, let me recalculate. So in the first case, i=1. So Kb=2.63.

In the second case, the solute is S8, which gives i=8. So the formula becomes:

ΔTb = i * Kb * m.

So 0.26 = 8 * 2.63 * m.

Wait, that would make m = 0.26 / (8 * 2.63) ≈ 0.26 / 21.04 ≈ 0.01235 m.

Wait, but then m is (moles of S8) / 0.050 kg.

So m = (1.2 / MW) / 0.050 = 0.01235.

So (1.2 / (0.050 * MW)) = 0.01235 → 1.2 = 0.050 * 0.01235 * MW → 1.2 = 0.0006175 * MW → MW = 1.2 / 0.0006175 ≈ 1943. Hmm, that can't be right. That's way too high. So that suggests that including i=8 is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says "elemental sulfur," which is S8. So perhaps I should consider that. But wait, why doesn't the first case include i? Because the first case says 1 mole of solute, which is likely a non-electrolyte. So perhaps the second case does involve i=8.

But the problem is giving a lower ΔTb, which would require a lower molality if i is higher. Let me see.

Wait, let's think again. If the solute is S8, then each mole gives 8 moles of particles. So the molality m would be (1.2g / MW) / 0.050 kg, but the effective moles for boiling point elevation would be 8 times that, because i=8.

So the formula would be ΔTb = Kb * (m * i) → 0.26 = 2.63 * (m *8).

So m = 0.26 / (2.63 *8 ) → 0.26 / 21.04 ≈ 0.01235 m.

So m is (1.2 / MW) / 0.050 = 0.01235 → 1.2/(0.050 * MW) =0.01235 → 1.2 = 0.050 * 0.01235 * MW → 1.2 = 0.0006175 * MW → MW = 1.2 / 0.0006175 ≈ 1943 g/mol, which is impossible because sulfur's molecular weight is 256 g/mol (for S8, it's 256).

Wait, that's way off. So perhaps the problem doesn't consider i, meaning that the solute doesn't dissociate. So elemental sulfur might not dissociate in benzene, so i=1.

Wait, maybe in benzene, S8 doesn't dissociate, so i=1. So in that case, the earlier calculation of MW≈243 would hold, which isn't an option. So perhaps I need to recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the Kb more accurately. Let me recalculate Kb:

First case: 1 mole solute in 1000g benzene → m=1/1=1 m. ΔTb=2.63°C. So Kb=2.63 / 1 =2.63 K·kg/mol.

Second case: 1.2g sulfur in 50g benzene. So m=(1.2/MW)/(0.050) = (1.2)/(0.050* MW) = 24 / MW.

Wait, wait, 1.2 divided by 0.050 is 24, so 24 / MW.

Then, ΔTb = Kb * m → 0.26 =2.63 * (24 / MW).

So 24/MW = 0.26 /2.63 → 0.09886.

So MW =24 / 0.09886 ≈242.7.

Hmm, same as before. So the MW is approximately 243, which isn't among the options. The closest is E:240.

But wait, the options include E:240, which is close enough. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximate Kb. Let me think: sometimes Kb is given as 2.7 for benzene, but in this case, it's calculated as 2.63.

Wait, perhaps I should try using Kb=2.7. Let's see:

If Kb=2.7, then for the second case:

0.26 =2.7 * (24 / MW) → 24/MW =0.26/2.7≈0.0963 → MW=24/0.0963≈249.2. Still not matching any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the formula for boiling point elevation is:

ΔTb = (mol solute) * Kb / (kg solvent).

Wait, because molality (m) is mol solute / kg solvent. So ΔTb = m * Kb = (mol solute / kg solvent) * Kb.

In the first case, mol solute is 1, kg solvent=1, so ΔTb=2.63=1 * Kb → Kb=2.63.

In the second case, mol solute =1.2/MW, kg solvent=0.050. So ΔTb= (1.2/MW) * 2.63 /0.050 = (1.2 *2.63)/(0.050 * MW) = (3.156)/(0.050 * MW) = 63.12 / MW.

Set this equal to 0.26:

63.12 / MW =0.26 → MW=63.12 /0.26 ≈242.77.

Again, same result. So the answer should be approximately 243, but the options don't have that. So the closest is E:240. Maybe the problem expects rounding to the nearest 60, but that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check once more.

Wait, the second solution has 1.2g sulfur in 50g benzene. So the molality is (1.2/MW) /0.050.

So, 1.2 divided by MW is mol solute, divided by 0.050 kg to get molality.

So, ΔTb = Kb * m → 0.26 =2.63 * [(1.2)/(0.050 * MW)] → 0.26/(2.63) = (1.2)/(0.050 * MW) → 0.09886 = (1.2)/(0.050 * MW) → 0.050 * MW * 0.09886 =1.2 → (0.004943) * MW=1.2 → MW=1.2 /0.004943≈242.7.

Hmm, same result. So unless I'm missing something, the answer is approximately 243, but the closest option is E:240.
</think>

To determine the molecular weight (MW) of sulfur, we use the boiling point elevation formula:

\[
\Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( K_b \) using the first scenario
- **Given**: Boiling point of benzene = 80.10°C, and with 1 mole of solute in 1000 g benzene, the boiling point becomes 82.73°C.
- **Elevation**: \( \Delta T_b = 82.73 - 80.10 = 2.63 \, \text{°C} \).
- **Molality**: \( m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \, \text{m} \).
- **Calculate \( K_b \)**:
  \[
  K_b = \frac{\Delta T_b}{m} = \frac{2.63}{1} = 2.63 \, \text{K·kg/mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Use the second scenario to find \( K_b \cdot m \)
- **Given**: 1.2 g of sulfur in 50 g benzene results in a boiling point of 80.36°C.
- **Elevation**: \( \Delta T_b = 80.36 - 80.10 = 0.26 \, \text{°C} \).
- **Molality**: \( m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}} = \frac{1.2}{\text{MW}} \div 0.050 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( \text{MW} \)
Using \( \Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m \):
\[
0.26 = 2.63 \cdot \left( \frac{1.2}{\text{MW}} \div 0.050 \right).
\]

Rearrange:
\[
\frac{1.2}{\text{MW}} \div 0.050 = \frac{0.26}{2.63}.
\]

Calculate:
\[
\frac{1.2}{\text{MW}} \div 0.050 = 0.09886.
\]

Multiply through by \( 0.050 \):
\[
\frac{1.2}{\text{MW}} = 0.004943.
\]

Solve for \( \text{MW} \):
\[
\text{MW} = \frac{1.2}{0.004943} \approx 242.7 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated \( \text{MW} \) is approximately \( 243 \, \text{g/mol} \), but the closest option provided is **E: 240 g/mol**.

ANSWER: E
