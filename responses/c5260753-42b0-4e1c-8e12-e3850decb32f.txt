Question:

 Suppose two athletes, A and B, are equally skilled. Suppose also that A naturally inherited certain traits from her father that made playing the sport easier for her, and thus she didn't have to train as hard as B. According to the ethic of willfulness,

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about ethics and athletes. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. 

The question says that two athletes, A and B, are equally skilled. But A has some natural traits from her father that make the sport easier for her, so she doesn't have to train as hard as B. The question is about the ethic of willfulness, and it's asking who is considered a better athlete according to that ethic.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ethics, but I think the ethic of willfulness, also known as the will to power or something like that, emphasizes effort, determination, and personal striving. It's more about the individual's own strength of will rather than natural talents or luck.

So in this case, both A and B have the same skill level. But A didn't have to train as hard because she inherited some traits that made it easier. B, on the other hand, had to train more. If the ethic of willfulness is about the effort and willpower, then B might be seen as the better athlete because they had to put in more work despite not having the natural advantages.

Wait, but the question says they're equally skilled. So maybe it's not about their current skill but about their worth as athletes based on effort. The ethic of willfulness would probably value the person who puts in the most effort, regardless of natural talent. So B, who trained harder, would be considered a better athlete in this context.

Looking at the options: A says A is better, which might be because of natural traits, but the ethic of willfulness doesn't care about thatâ€”it's about effort. B says B is better, which aligns with the idea that more effort makes them a better athlete. C says B isn't an athlete because training matters, but that doesn't make sense; B is an athlete who's just putting in more work. D says they're equal, but I think the ethic would focus on the effort, making B better.

So I think the answer is B, B is a better athlete.

The ethic of willfulness emphasizes effort and determination over natural talent. Since B trained harder despite equal skill, B is considered the better athlete. 

Answer: B
