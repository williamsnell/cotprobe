Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the number of calories developed in an electric heater over a minute. Let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem states that the heater draws 5.0 amps when connected to a 110-volt line, and we need to find out how many calories it develops in one minute. The options are given from A to J, so I'll need to calculate and see which one matches.

First, I remember that electric power can be calculated using the formula P = V * I, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current. So, plugging in the values, V is 110 volts, and I is 5 amps. 

So, P = 110 V * 5 A = 550 watts. Wait, no, 110 times 5 is 550? Let me check that multiplication again. 100 times 5 is 500, and 10 times 5 is 50, so adding them gives 550. Yeah, that's correct. So the power is 550 watts.

Now, since power is in watts, which is equivalent to joules per second (J/s), I can find the energy used in one minute by multiplying power by time. The time here is 1 minute, which is 60 seconds. So, energy E = P * t = 550 J/s * 60 s.

Calculating that gives E = 550 * 60. Let me do that math. 500 * 60 is 30,000, and 50 *60 is 3,000. Adding them together gives 33,000 joules. So, E = 33,000 J.

But wait, the question asks for calories, not joules. I remember that 1 calorie is approximately equal to 4.184 joules. So to convert joules to calories, I need to divide by that factor. 

So, calories = E (in J) / 4.184. Plugging in the numbers: 33,000 J / 4.184 ≈ let's see. Hmm, 33,000 divided by 4 is 8,250, but since 4.184 is a bit more than 4, the result will be a bit less than 8,250. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 33,000 ÷ 4.184. Let me approximate this division. 

First, I can consider that 4.184 times 7,900 is roughly 33,000. Wait, let me check:

4.184 * 7,900 = ?

Well, 4.184 * 7,000 = 29,288. Then 4.184 * 900 = 3,765.6. Adding those together gives 29,288 + 3,765.6 = 33,053.6. Oh, that's pretty close to 33,000. So 7,900 calories would be approximately the energy. 

Wait, but 33,053.6 is a bit more than 33,000, so perhaps it's a little under 7,900. Let me see the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can do this division more accurately. Let me try:

33,000 ÷ 4.184 = ?

Let me set it up as 4.184 ) 33000.

But perhaps another approach is to write this as 33000 / 4.184 ≈ 33000 / 4.18.

Hmm. Let me compute 4.18 times 7,900 = 4.18 *7,900.

4.18 *7,000 = 29,260.

4.18 *900 = 3,762.

Adding them gives 29,260 + 3,762 = 33,022. So 4.18 *7,900 = 33,022, which is very close to 33,000. So 33,000 ÷4.18 ≈7,900 (since 33,022 is slightly over, so the actual value is about 7,900 - (22/4.18) ≈ 7,900 - 5.26 ≈ 7,894.74. So approximately 7,895 calories.

Looking at the options, option E is 7.9 ×10^3 cal, which is 7,900. So that's very close. My calculation gives about 7,895, which would round to 7.9 ×10^3, so option E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, the power calculation: 110 V * 5 A = 550 W. Correct.

Energy in 60 seconds: 550 * 60 = 33,000 J. Correct.

Calories: 33,000 /4.184 = approximately 7,900. Correct.

So the answer should be E: 7.9 ×10^3 cal.

The power of the heater is calculated as P = V × I = 110 V × 5 A = 550 W. Over 60 seconds, the energy is E = 550 W × 60 s = 33,000 J. Converting to calories, 33,000 J ÷ 4.184 ≈ 7,900 cal. The closest option is E: 7.9 ×10^3 cal.
