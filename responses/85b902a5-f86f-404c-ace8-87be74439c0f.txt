Question:

What do you expect the rate of growth to be of aneconomy where , on average, the population saves 15% of its income and marginal capital/output ratio is 2.5, i.e., an in-crease in output of $100 billion per year is produced by an increase in the capital stock of $250 billion.

A: 4% per year
B: 12% per year
C: 2% per year
D: 15% per year
E: 7.5% per year
F: 10% per year
G: 6% per year
H: 5% per year
I: 3% per year
J: 8% per year

Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about the rate of growth of an economy. The given information is that the population saves 15% of its income on average, and the marginal capital/output ratio is 2.5. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember that this has something to do with the Solow growth model. 

Wait, the Solow model... right, it's about how capital accumulation, labor growth, and technological progress affect economic growth. In this case, I don't think there's any mention of technological progress or labor growth, so maybe those factors are negligible or not part of this question. So, I should focus on capital accumulation.

The first thing I need to recall is the formula for the rate of economic growth in the Solow model. I think it's something like the growth rate equals the savings rate multiplied by the capital-output ratio, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Oh, wait, maybe it's more precise than that. 

I remember that the rate of growth (g) can be calculated using the formula: g = s * (y/k), where s is the savings rate, and (y/k) is the capital-output ratio. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the formula might involve the savings rate and the capital-output ratio in a different way. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The capital-output ratio (v) is defined as the amount of capital needed to produce one unit of output. So if the ratio is 2.5, that means for every $1 of output, you need $2.5 of capital. So, output (y) is related to capital (k) as y = k / v. 

Now, the savings rate (s) is 15%, or 0.15. In the Solow model, the change in capital (Δk) is equal to savings (s * y) minus the depreciation of capital. But wait, the question doesn't mention depreciation, so maybe we can assume it's zero or not part of this problem. So, Δk = s * y. 

But I'm trying to find the growth rate of output, which is Δy/y. Since y = k / v, then Δy = (Δk / v). So, Δy/y = (Δk / v) / y. Substituting y = k/v, that becomes (Δk / v) / (k/v) ) = Δk / k. So, Δy/y = Δk/k. 

That means the growth rate of output is the same as the growth rate of capital. So, g = Δk/k. 

But how do we find Δk? Well, Δk = s * y. So, substituting y = k/v, we get Δk = s * (k/v). Then, Δk/k = s / v. 

So, the growth rate g = s / v. 

Wait, let me check that. If I plug in the numbers: s is 0.15, v is 2.5. So, g = 0.15 / 2.5. Let me calculate that: 0.15 divided by 2.5 is 0.06, which is 6%. 

Looking at the options, option G is 6%. So, that's probably the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because sometimes the formula includes the depreciation rate. But since the question doesn't mention depreciation, maybe it's not part of this calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is g = s * (1 / v), which in this case is 0.15 / 2.5 = 0.06, which is 6% again. 

So, I think the correct answer is G: 6% per year.

The rate of growth of the economy can be determined using the Solow growth model. The formula for the growth rate (g) is given by the savings rate (s) divided by the capital-output ratio (v). Here, s = 15% (0.15) and v = 2.5. Plugging these values into the formula:

g = s / v = 0.15 / 2.5 = 0.06 or 6%.

Thus, the expected rate of growth is 6% per year.

Answer: G
