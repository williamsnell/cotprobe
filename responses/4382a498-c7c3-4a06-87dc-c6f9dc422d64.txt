Okay, so I need to figure out the mass of 1 liter of carbon monoxide (CO) at standard temperature and pressure (STP). Hmm, I remember that STP is 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere pressure. At STP, I think gases have certain molar volumes. Oh right, the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 liters per mole. So that means 1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 liters.

Wait, but the question is about 1 liter, not 22.4. So I guess I need to find out how many moles are in 1 liter and then multiply by the molar mass of CO to get the mass. 

First, let me find the molar mass of CO. Carbon has an atomic mass of about 12 g/mol, and oxygen is about 16 g/mol. So CO would be 12 + 16 = 28 g/mol. 

Now, if 22.4 liters is 1 mole, then 1 liter is 1/22.4 moles. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 22.4 is approximately 0.0446 moles.

Then, the mass would be moles multiplied by molar mass. So 0.0446 moles * 28 g/mol. Let me do that math: 0.0446 * 28. Hmm, 0.04 * 28 is 1.12, and 0.0046 *28 is about 0.1288. Adding those together gives roughly 1.2488 grams. 

Looking at the options, the closest one is J: 1.25 g. But wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake. Because I remember that sometimes the molar volume at STP is given as 22.4 L/mol, but maybe I should double-check if it's exactly 22.4 or if there's a more precise value. Oh, right, 22.4 L/mol is an approximation. The exact value is about 22.711 L/mol at STP. So maybe I should use that for better accuracy.

If I use 22.711 L/mol, then 1 liter is 1/22.711 ≈ 0.0441 moles. Multiply that by 28 g/mol: 0.0441 * 28 = let's see, 0.04 *28 is 1.12, and 0.0041*28 is 0.1148. Adding them gives 1.2348 grams. So approximately 1.23 g. 

Looking at the options again, J is 1.25 g, which is close. But wait, another thought: maybe the question assumes the molar volume is 22.4, so using that would give around 1.248 g, which is about 1.25 g. So J would be the answer. But wait, some sources say that standard conditions have changed, but I think for this problem, STP is 0°C and 1 atm, so 22.4 L/mol is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different molar mass. Wait, no, CO is definitely 28 g/mol. So I think I did that right. So 1 liter would be about 1.25 grams. But wait, let me check the options again. Option J is 1.25 g. So that should be the answer.

Wait another thought: sometimes, the molar volume is considered as 24 L/mol at STP, but I think that's for room temperature. No, wait, no. STP is 22.4 L/mol. So I think I'm confident that 1 liter is about 1.25 grams.
