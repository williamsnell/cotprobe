Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to apply the Müller method twice to find x3 for the equation log₁₀(x) - x + 3 = 0. The initial values given are x0 = 1/4, x1 = 1/2, and x2 = 1. The options provided are A to J, each with a decimal value, and I need to pick the correct one after two iterations.

First, I should recall what the Müller method is. From what I remember, it's a numerical method for finding roots of a function. It uses quadratic interpolation, which means it fits a quadratic curve to three points and then uses the root of that quadratic as the next approximation. Unlike the secant method, which uses linear interpolation, the Müller method often converges faster because it uses a parabola.

So, the steps involved in the Müller method are roughly as follows:

1. Start with three points: x0, x1, x2.
2. Compute the function values f(x0), f(x1), and f(x2).
3. Fit a quadratic function to these three points. The general form is f(x) = a(x - x0)(x - x1) + b(x - x0) + c.
4. The next approximation, x3, is the root of this quadratic function closest to x2. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is computed using the vertex of the parabola.
5. Repeat the process with x1, x2, and x3 for subsequent iterations.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think the formula for the next iterate in the Müller method can be derived by forming the quadratic through the three points and then solving for the root. Alternatively, I remember a formula involving the function values and differences.

Let me think. The quadratic is determined by the three points (x0, f0), (x1, f1), (x2, f2). So, the quadratic can be written as f(x) = a(x - x0)(x - x1) + b(x - x0) + c, but that might not be the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, the quadratic is usually expressed as f(x) = a x² + b x + c. But perhaps a better way is to set up equations based on the three points.

Alternatively, I remember that the next approximation is given by a specific formula involving the differences of the function values. Let me try to recall the formula.

The next iterate x3 is computed using the formula:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

Wait, that seems a bit complicated, but I think that's the formula for the next step. Let me see if I can derive it.

The idea is to fit a quadratic through the three points and then find its root. So, given three points (x0, f0), (x1, f1), (x2, f2), the quadratic can be written as:

f(x) = a (x - x0)(x - x1) + b (x - x0) + c

But I think another approach is to model the quadratic as f(x) = p x² + q x + r, and set up three equations based on the three points. Then solve for p, q, r, and find the root.

But that might take some time. Alternatively, I think the formula for x3 can be written as:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

Yes, that's the formula I think. So, let's compute that step by step.

Given x0 = 0.25, x1 = 0.5, x2 = 1.

First, compute f(x) at each point.

The function is f(x) = log₁₀(x) - x + 3.

Compute f(x0): x0 = 1/4 = 0.25.

log₁₀(0.25) is log(1/4) which is -log(4) ≈ -0.60206. So f(x0) = -0.60206 - 0.25 + 3 ≈ 2.14794.

f(x1): x1 = 0.5.

log₁₀(0.5) ≈ -0.30103. So f(x1) = -0.30103 - 0.5 + 3 ≈ 2.19897.

f(x2): x2 = 1.

log₁₀(1) = 0. So f(x2) = 0 - 1 + 3 = 2.

Wait, that's interesting. So f(x0) ≈ 2.14794, f(x1) ≈ 2.19897, f(x2) = 2.

So, now, let's compute the numerator and denominator for the formula.

Compute numerator: (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) = (1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.25) = (0.5)(0.75) = 0.375.

Now, denominator:

[ (f(x2) - f(x1)) * (x2 - x0) ) - (f(x2) - f(x0)) * (x2 - x1) ) ]

Compute each part:

f(x2) - f(x1) = 2 - 2.19897 ≈ -0.19897.

x2 - x0 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.

So first term: (-0.19897)(0.75) ≈ -0.1492275.

Next part:

f(x2) - f(x0) = 2 - 2.14794 ≈ -0.14794.

x2 - x1 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So second term: (-0.14794)(0.5) ≈ -0.07397.

Now, denominator is first term minus second term:

(-0.1492275) - (-0.07397) = (-0.1492275 + 0.07397) ≈ -0.0752575.

So denominator ≈ -0.0752575.

Now, the overall formula for x3 is:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * (0.375) / (-0.0752575)

Let's compute numerator and denominator:

f(x2) is 2.

So 2 * 0.375 = 0.75.

Divided by denominator: 0.75 / (-0.0752575) ≈ -9.965.

But wait, that would make x3 = 1 - (-9.965) = 1 + 9.965 ≈ 10.965. But that seems way too high, and looking at the options, the highest is 4.6, 4.1, etc. So I must have made a mistake in the denominator calculation.

Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs or the terms in the denominator. Let me re-calculate:

Denominator:

= [ (f2 - f1)(x2 - x0) ) - (f2 - f0)(x2 - x1) ]

So f2 = 2, f1 ≈ 2.19897, f0 ≈ 2.14794.

So f2 - f1 = 2 - 2.19897 = -0.19897.

f2 - f0 = 2 - 2.14794 = -0.14794.

Then,

(f2 - f1)(x2 - x0) = (-0.19897)(0.75) = -0.1492275.

(f2 - f0)(x2 - x1) = (-0.14794)(0.5) = -0.07397.

So the denominator is (-0.1492275) - (-0.07397) = (-0.1492275) + 0.07397 = -0.0752575.

So that's correct. Then, the numerator is (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) = 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.375.

So x3 = x2 - [f(x2) * (0.375) ] / (-0.0752575)

Wait, x3 = x2 - [f(x2) * (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0)] / [denominator]

So plugging in:

x3 = 1 - [2 * 0.375] / (-0.0752575)

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.375 = 0.75.

Denominator (of the fraction) is -0.0752575.

So 0.75 / (-0.0752575) ≈ -9.965.

So x3 = 1 - (-9.965) = 1 + 9.965 ≈ 10.965.

But that can't be right because the function f(x) at x=10 is log10(10)=1, so f(10) = 1 -10 +3= -6. But the options are all much lower than 10. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula for the next step. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. The correct formula might be:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

Wait, that's what I used, but the result is way off. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for the root of the quadratic, which is the minimum of the quadratic, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The next step is to fit a quadratic through the three points (x0, f0), (x1, f1), (x2, f2). The quadratic can be written as f(x) = a(x - x0)(x - x1) + b(x - x0) + c. But perhaps a better way is to use the Lagrange interpolation formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for x3 is derived by considering the quadratic's roots. Wait, the quadratic will have two roots, and we choose the one that's closer to x2. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is correct, but I made a calculation mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different formula. Let me think again.

Another approach is to compute the coefficients a, b, c of the quadratic f(x) = a x² + b x + c, passing through the three points. Then, find the roots of this quadratic and choose the one closest to x2.

So, let's compute a, b, c.

We have three equations:

At x0: a x0² + b x0 + c = f0

At x1: a x1² + b x1 + c = f1

At x2: a x2² + b x2 + c = f2

We can solve this system for a, b, c.

Given x0=0.25, x1=0.5, x2=1.

f0≈2.14794, f1≈2.19897, f2=2.

So,

Equation 1: a*(0.25)^2 + b*(0.25) + c = 2.14794

Equation 2: a*(0.5)^2 + b*(0.5) + c = 2.19897

Equation 3: a*(1)^2 + b*(1) + c = 2

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: 0.0625 a + 0.25 b + c = 2.14794

Equation 2: 0.25 a + 0.5 b + c = 2.19897

Equation 3: a + b + c = 2

Now, let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(0.25a - 0.0625a) + (0.5b - 0.25b) + (c - c) = 2.19897 - 2.14794

0.1875a + 0.25b = 0.05103

Similarly, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:

(a - 0.25a) + (b - 0.5b) + (c - c) = 2 - 2.19897

0.75a + 0.5b = -0.19897

Now, we have two equations:

1. 0.1875a + 0.25b = 0.05103

2. 0.75a + 0.5b = -0.19897

Let me multiply the first equation by 2 to make it easier:

0.375a + 0.5b = 0.10206

Now, subtract this from the second equation:

(0.75a - 0.375a) + (0.5b - 0.5b) = (-0.19897) - 0.10206

0.375a = -0.30103 → a = (-0.30103) / 0.375 ≈ -0.80275

Now, substitute a into the first adjusted equation:

0.375*(-0.80275) + 0.5b = 0.10206

0.375*(-0.80275) ≈ -0.30103 → -0.30103 + 0.5b = 0.10206 → 0.5b = 0.40309 → b ≈ 0.80618

Now, from Equation 3: a + b + c = 2 → (-0.80275) + 0.80618 + c = 2 → (0.00343) + c = 2 → c ≈ 1.99657

So, the quadratic is f(x) = a x² + b x + c ≈ -0.80275 x² + 0.80618 x + 1.99657.

Now, find the roots of this quadratic equation: -0.80275 x² + 0.80618 x + 1.99657 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = -0.80275, b = 0.80618, c = 1.99657.

Compute discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (0.80618)^2 - 4*(-0.80275)(1.99657).

Compute each part:

0.80618^2 ≈ 0.6499.

4 * 0.80275 * 1.99657 ≈ 4 * 1.602 ≈ 6.408.

So D ≈ 0.6499 + 6.408 ≈ 7.0579.

sqrt(D) ≈ 2.657.

Now, the roots are:

x = [ -0.80618 ± 2.657 ] / (2 * -0.80275 )

Compute both roots.

First root: [ -0.80618 + 2.657 ] / (-1.6055) ≈ (1.85082) / (-1.6055) ≈ -1.152.

Second root: [ -0.80618 - 2.657 ] / (-1.6055) ≈ (-3.46318)/(-1.6055) ≈ 2.156.

Now, since we're looking for roots near x2=1, the positive root is 2.156. So x3 would be approximately 2.156, which is around 2.2. Looking at the options, G is 2.2. But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, but wait: in the quadratic, a is negative, so the parabola opens downward. So the roots are on either side, but the one we need is the one closer to x2=1. So 2.156 is closer to 1 than -1.152 is, so x3=2.156.

Now, that's after one iteration, so x3≈2.156, which is approximately 2.2, which is option G.

Wait, but I've only done one iteration. The question asks for two iterations. So I need to perform another step using x1, x2, x3 to get x4, but wait, the question says perform two iterations, so from x0, x1, x2, we get x3 after first iteration, and then from x1, x2, x3, we get x4 after second iteration. So the question is asking for x3 after two iterations, which would be x4 in this context? Wait no, the question says "perform 2 iterations with the Müller method for the following equation", starting with x0, x1, x2, and then compute x3. Wait no, I think I might have miscounted.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the initial points are x0, x1, x2. The first iteration uses x0, x1, x2 to compute x3. The second iteration uses x1, x2, x3 to compute x4. But the question is asking for x3 after two iterations. Wait, no, after two iterations, the next approximation after the second iteration would be x3 if we started with x0, x1, x2 as the initial three points. Wait, no, I think the first iteration computes x3, the second computes x4, so after two iterations, we have x4. But the question says "what's the decimal value of x3?" So perhaps it's after two iterations, meaning x3 is computed twice? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is misworded. It says "perform 2 iterations with the Müller method for the following equation: log_{10}(x) - x + 3 = 0, x_0 = 1/4, x_1 = 1/2, x_2 = 1. What's the decimal value of x_3?"

Wait, that suggests that after two iterations, we have x3. So, perhaps the first iteration computes x1, then the second computes x2, but that doesn't make sense because we already have x0, x1, x2.

Wait, perhaps the initial points are x0, x1, x2, and after the first iteration, we get x3, and after the second iteration, we get x4. But the question is asking for x3 after two iterations, meaning after two steps beyond the initial three points.

Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed step by step.

Wait, perhaps the initial three points are x0, x1, x2. The first iteration produces x3, and the second iteration produces x4. But the question is only asking for x3, which is after one iteration. But the question says perform two iterations, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is to compute x3, then use x1, x2, x3 to compute x4, which would be the second iteration. So after two iterations, x4 is the result, but the question is about x3, which would be after the first iteration.

But the question says "perform 2 iterations with the Müller method for ... What's the decimal value of x_3?"

Wait, that's confusing. Let me read the question again.

"Perform 2 iterations with the Müller method for the following equation: log_{10}(x) - x + 3 = 0, x_0 = 1/4, x_1 = 1/2, x_2 = 1. What's the decimal value of x_3?"

So, the initial three points are x0=0.25, x1=0.5, x2=1. After the first iteration, we get x3. After the second iteration, we get x4. But the question is asking for x3, which is after the first iteration. So perhaps the question is just asking for x3 after one iteration, but the wording says two iterations. Hmm, perhaps it's a mistake, but regardless, I'll proceed.

In my first iteration, I found x3≈2.156, which is approximately 2.2 (option G). But let's proceed to the second iteration to see if that's the case.

So, now, for the second iteration, we have x1=0.5, x2=1, x3=2.156.

Compute f(x1), f(x2), f(x3).

We already have f(x1)=2.19897, f(x2)=2.

Compute f(x3)=log10(2.156) - 2.156 +3.

log10(2.156) is approximately 0.333.

So f(x3)=0.333 -2.156 +3 ≈ 1.177.

Now, we can apply the Müller method again using x1=0.5, x2=1, x3=2.156, with f(x1)=2.19897, f(x2)=2, f(x3)=1.177.

We need to compute the next approximation, which would be x4.

Using the same formula as before:

x4 = x3 - f(x3) * ( (x3 - x2)(x3 - x1) ) / [ (f(x3) - f(x2))(x3 - x1) - (f(x3) - f(x1))(x3 - x2) ) ]

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (x3 - x2)(x3 - x1) = (2.156 -1)(2.156 -0.5) = (1.156)(1.656) ≈ 1.911.

Denominator:

= [ (f(x3) - f(x2)) * (x3 - x1) ) - (f(x3) - f(x1)) * (x3 - x2) ) ]

Compute each part:

f(x3)=1.177, f(x2)=2 → f(x3)-f(x2)=1.177-2= -0.823.

x3 -x1=2.156 -0.5=1.656.

So first term: (-0.823)(1.656) ≈ -1.363.

Next part:

f(x3)-f(x1)=1.177 -2.19897≈-1.02197.

x3 -x2=2.156 -1=1.156.

Second term: (-1.02197)(1.156) ≈-1.179.

Now, denominator = (-1.363) - (-1.179) = (-1.363 +1.179)= -0.184.

So denominator ≈-0.184.

Now, compute x4:

x4 = x3 - [f(x3) * numerator ] / denominator

f(x3)=1.177.

So:

x4 = 2.156 - [1.177 * 1.911] / (-0.184)

Compute numerator of the fraction: 1.177 *1.911 ≈2.247.

Divide by denominator: 2.247 / (-0.184) ≈-12.205.

So x4 = 2.156 - (-12.205) = 2.156 +12.205 ≈14.361.

Wait, that's way off. But the options don't go that high. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the quadratic interpolation again.

But let's check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the denominator.

Denominator:

= [ (f3 - f2)(x3 -x1) ) - (f3 -f1)(x3 -x2) ]

f3=1.177, f2=2 → f3-f2= -0.823.

x3 -x1=1.656.

So first term: (-0.823)(1.656)= -1.363.

f3-f1=1.177 - 2.19897≈-1.02197.

x3 -x2=1.156.

Second term: (-1.02197)(1.156)≈-1.179.

So denominator= (-1.363) - (-1.179)= -0.184.

So that's correct.

Numerator: (x3 -x2)(x3 -x1)=1.156 *1.656≈1.911.

f(x3)=1.177.

So x4=2.156 - (1.177 *1.911)/(-0.184).

Compute 1.177 *1.911≈2.247.

Divided by -0.184: 2.247 / (-0.184)≈-12.205.

So x4=2.156 - (-12.205)=2.156+12.205≈14.361.

This seems way too high, and none of the options are near 14. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used a different formula for the next step. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the quadratic root approach again.

Let me try that.

Using x1=0.5, x2=1, x3=2.156, with f(x1)=2.19897, f(x2)=2, f(x3)=1.177.

We'll set up the quadratic equation passing through these three points.

The quadratic is f(x)=a x² +b x +c.

So,

At x1=0.5: a*(0.5)^2 + b*(0.5) + c =2.19897 →0.25a +0.5b +c=2.19897.

At x2=1: a*(1)^2 +b*(1)+c=2 →a +b +c=2.

At x3=2.156: a*(2.156)^2 +b*(2.156)+c=1.177.

Compute (2.156)^2≈4.647.

So equation 3:4.647a +2.156b +c=1.177.

Now, we have three equations:

1. 0.25a +0.5b +c=2.19897.

2. a +b +c=2.

3.4.647a +2.156b +c=1.177.

Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(a -0.25a) + (b -0.5b) + (c -c) = 2 -2.19897.

0.75a +0.5b= -0.19897.

Let's call this equation 4.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

(4.647a -a) + (2.156b -b) + (c -c)=1.177-2.

3.647a +1.156b= -0.823.

Call this equation 5.

Now, equation 4: 0.75a +0.5b = -0.19897.

Equation 5:3.647a +1.156b= -0.823.

Let me solve these two equations.

Multiply equation 4 by 2.314 to make the coefficients of b the same, but perhaps it's easier to use substitution.

From equation 4:

0.75a +0.5b = -0.19897 → multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate decimals:

1.5a + b = -0.39794 → equation 4a: b= -0.39794 -1.5a.

Now, substitute into equation 5:

3.647a +1.156*(-0.39794 -1.5a) = -0.823.

Compute each term:

3.647a + (-1.156*0.39794) + (-1.156*1.5a) = -0.823.

Compute:

1.156 *0.39794 ≈0.459.

1.156 *1.5=1.734.

So,

3.647a -0.459 -1.734a = -0.823.

Combine like terms:

(3.647 -1.734)a -0.459 = -0.823 →1.913a -0.459 = -0.823.

Add 0.459 to both sides:

1.913a = -0.823 +0.459 = -0.364.

So a= -0.364 /1.913 ≈-0.190.

Now, substitute a back into equation 4a:

b= -0.39794 -1.5*(-0.190) →-0.39794 +0.285= -0.11294.

Now, from equation 2: a +b +c=2 → -0.190 + (-0.11294) +c=2 →c=2 +0.30294≈2.30294.

So the quadratic is f(x)= -0.190 x² -0.11294 x +2.30294.

Now, find the roots of this quadratic.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [0.11294 ± sqrt( (−0.11294)^2 -4*(-0.190)(2.30294) ) ]/(2*(-0.190))

Compute discriminant D:

D= (0.11294)^2 -4*(-0.190)(2.30294).

0.11294^2≈0.01276.

4*0.190*2.30294≈4*0.4376≈1.7504.

So D=0.01276 +1.7504≈1.76316.

sqrt(D)=≈1.328.

So,

x = [0.11294 ±1.328 ] / (-0.38)

Compute both possibilities.

First root: (0.11294 +1.328)/(-0.38)= (1.44094)/(-0.38)= -3.792.

Second root: (0.11294 -1.328)/(-0.38)= (-1.21506)/(-0.38)= 3.197.

So the roots are approximately -3.792 and 3.197.

Since we're looking for a root near x3=2.156, the next approximation would be 3.197, which is approximately 3.2, which is option E.

Wait, but that's after two iterations, giving x4≈3.197, which is close to 3.2. But the question is asking for x3 after two iterations? Or perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, in the first iteration, we found x3≈2.156, which is option G. Then, in the second iteration, we found x4≈3.197, which is option E.

But the question is asking for x3 after two iterations. Wait, that doesn't make sense because after two iterations, x4 would be the result. So perhaps the question is asking for x3 after one iteration, which is 2.156, option G. But the options don't have 2.156; the closest is G:2.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first iteration. Let me check again.

Wait, in the first iteration, after computing the quadratic, I found x3≈2.156, which is 2.2 (option G). But when I computed using the formula, I got x3≈10.965, which is way off, but that was due to a mistake in the formula. Wait no, that was when I used the formula incorrectly, but when I used the quadratic approach, I got 2.156.

So, perhaps the correct x3 after one iteration is 2.156, which is approximately 2.2 (option G).

But the question says to perform two iterations, so perhaps after two iterations, x4 would be 3.197, which is 3.2 (option E).

But the question specifically asks for x3, which would be after the first iteration.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

- Initial points: x0=0.25, x1=0.5, x2=1.

- After first iteration: x3=2.156.

- After second iteration: x4=3.197.

So, the question is asking for x3, which is after the first iteration, so 2.156, which is option G:2.2.

But looking at the options, the closest is G:2.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the initial points as iteration 0, so two iterations would take us to x2, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first iteration.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the next step. Let me try again.

The correct formula for the next iterate in the Müller method is:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

In the first iteration, with x0=0.25, x1=0.5, x2=1, f0≈2.14794, f1≈2.19897, f2=2.

Compute numerator: (x2 -x1)(x2 -x0)= (0.5)(0.75)=0.375.

Denominator: (f2-f1)(x2-x0) - (f2 -f0)(x2 -x1) = (2 -2.19897)(0.75) - (2 -2.14794)(0.5) = (-0.19897)(0.75) - (-0.14794)(0.5) = (-0.1492275) + 0.07397 = -0.0752575.

So x3 = 1 - [2 * 0.375] / (-0.0752575) → 1 - (0.75 / -0.0752575) → 1 + (0.75 / 0.0752575) → 0.75 /0.0752575≈9.965 → x3=1 +9.965≈10.965.

Wait, that's the same result as before, which can't be right because it's too high. But when I used the quadratic approach, I got x3≈2.156. So there must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me check the correct formula for the next step in the Müller method.

After checking, I realize that the correct formula for the next step is:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

But perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the denominator in the formula is:

[(f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1)] 

Which is correct.

But when I compute this, I get denominator≈-0.0752575.

Then, x3=1 - [2 * 0.375]/(-0.0752575) → 1 - (0.75 / -0.0752575) → 1 + (0.75 / 0.0752575) → 1 +9.965≈10.965.

But that's way off, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

But let me check the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the reciprocal or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula as:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) + (f(x0) - f(x1))(x2 - x1) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I had the sign wrong in the denominator.

Let me re-calculate the denominator with the correct formula.

Denominator = (f(x2)-f(x1))(x2-x0) - (f(x2)-f(x0))(x2-x1)

So,

(f2 -f1)(x2 -x0) = (2 -2.19897)(1-0.25)= (-0.19897)(0.75)= -0.1492275.

(f2 -f0)(x2 -x1)= (2 -2.14794)(1-0.5)= (-0.14794)(0.5)= -0.07397.

So denominator= (-0.1492275) - (-0.07397)= -0.1492275 +0.07397= -0.0752575.

So the calculation is correct.

Thus, x3=1 - (2 *0.375)/(-0.0752575)=1 - (0.75 / -0.0752575)=1 + (0.75 /0.0752575)=1 +9.965≈10.965.

But that's way too high, and in the quadratic approach, I got x3≈2.156. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula as:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) + (f(x1) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I had the sign wrong. Let me try that.

Denominator becomes:

(f2 -f1)(x2 -x0) + (f1 -f0)(x2 -x1)= (-0.19897)(0.75) + (2.19897-2.14794)(0.5)= (-0.1492275) + (0.05103)(0.5)= (-0.1492275) +0.025515≈-0.1237125.

So x3=1 - [2 *0.375]/(-0.1237125)=1 - (0.75 / -0.1237125)=1 + (0.75 /0.1237125)=1 +6.063≈7.063.

That's still high, but better.

But in the quadratic approach, I got x3≈2.156, which is more reasonable.

So, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the quadratic approach is the right way.

Thus, perhaps the correct x3 is 2.156, which is option G:2.2.

But when I tried using the formula, I got a different result, which suggests that I might have used the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * ( (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

But that gives x3≈10.965, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula as:

x3 = x2 - f(x2) * (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) / [ (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ]

But that's what I did, and it's not working.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula as:

x3 = x2 - [ (f(x2) * (x2 - x1)(x2 - x0) ) / ( (f(x2) - f(x1))(x2 - x0) - (f(x2) - f(x0))(x2 - x1) ) ) ]

Which is what I did, leading to x3≈10.965.

But that can't be right because the quadratic approach gave me 2.156.

This is confusing. Perhaps I should rely on the quadratic approach, which seems more accurate.

So, after the first iteration, x3≈2.156, which is 2.2, option G.

After the second iteration, using x1=0.5, x2=1, x3=2.156, I got x4≈3.197, which is option E:3.2.

But the question is asking for x3 after two iterations, which would be x4=3.197, option E.

But the initial problem states that after two iterations, what's x3? That seems contradictory because after two iterations, we'd have x4.

Wait, perhaps the question is misworded, and it's asking for x3 after one iteration, which would be option G:2.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for x3 after two iterations, but that would be x4=3.197≈3.2, option E.

But given the options, I think the correct answer after one iteration is G:2.2, and after two iterations, it would be E:3.2.

But the question is asking for x3 after two iterations, which would be x4, but the options don't include 3.197, but option E is 3.2.

So, perhaps the answer is E:3.2.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results between the formula approach and the quadratic approach. I think the quadratic approach is more reliable, so after two iterations, x4≈3.197, which is 3.2, option E.

The problem involves applying the Müller method twice to the equation \( \log_{10}(x) - x + 3 = 0 \) with initial values \( x_0 = 0.25 \), \( x_1 = 0.5 \), and \( x_2 = 1 \). The goal is to find the decimal value of \( x_3 \) after two iterations.

### First Iteration:
1. **Function Values**:
   - \( f(x_0) = \log_{10}(0.25) - 0.25 + 3 \approx 2.14794 \)
   - \( f(x_1) = \log_{10}(0.5) - 0.5 + 3 \approx 2.19897 \)
   - \( f(x_2) = \log_{10}(1) - 1 + 3 = 2 \)

2. **Quadratic Interpolation**:
   - Fit a quadratic \( f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \) through the points \( (x_0, f_0) \), \( (x_1, f_1) \), and \( (x_2, f_2) \).
   - Solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), then find the root closest to \( x_2 \). This gives \( x_3 \approx 2.156 \), which is approximately \( 2.2 \) (Option G).

### Second Iteration:
1. **New Points**:
   - \( x_1 = 0.5 \), \( x_2 = 1 \), \( x_3 = 2.156 \)
   - Compute new function values:
     - \( f(x_1) \approx 2.19897 \)
     - \( f(x_2) = 2 \)
     - \( f(x_3) = \log_{10}(2.156) - 2.156 + 3 \approx 1.177 \)

2. **Quadratic Interpolation Again**:
   - Fit a quadratic through \( (x_1, f_1) \), \( (x_2, f_2) \), and \( (x_3, f_3) \).
   - Solve for the next root, which gives \( x_4 \approx 3.197 \), approximately \( 3.2 \) (Option E).

### Conclusion:
The question asks for \( x_3 \) after two iterations. However, after two iterations, the computed value is \( x_4 \approx 3.2 \), which corresponds to Option E.

**Answer: E**
