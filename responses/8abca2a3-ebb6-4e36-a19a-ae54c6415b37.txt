Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding the other integer when given the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. One of the numbers is given as 48, and I need to find the other one from the options provided.

Alright, first, I remember that there's a relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers. I think it goes like this: the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and GCD. So, if the two numbers are a and b, then a * b = LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b). Yeah, that sounds right. I've heard it before in my math classes.

So, applying that formula here, I can plug in the values I know. One number is 48, the LCM is 240, and the GCD is 24. Let me write that down:

48 * x = 240 * 24

Here, x is the other number I'm trying to find.

Now, let me compute the right side first. 240 multiplied by 24. Hmm, 240 times 20 is 4800, and 240 times 4 is 960, so adding those together gives 4800 + 960 = 5760. So, the equation becomes:

48 * x = 5760

To find x, I need to divide both sides by 48. So, x = 5760 / 48. Let me do that division.

First, I know that 48 times 100 is 4800. Subtracting that from 5760 leaves 960. Then, 48 times 20 is 960. So, 100 + 20 = 120. Therefore, x is 120.

Wait, let me double-check that division to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 48 times 120 equals 5760? Let me calculate 48 * 120. 48 times 100 is 4800, 48 times 20 is 960, and adding them together gives 5760. Yep, that's correct.

So, the other number is 120. Looking back at the options, option C is 120. So, I think the answer is C.

But just to make sure, maybe I should think again if I applied the formula correctly. Sometimes I get confused with LCM and GCD, but I think the formula is right. Let me see: if two numbers have a GCD of 24, that means both numbers are multiples of 24. So, 48 is a multiple of 24 (since 48 รท 24 = 2), and the other number should also be a multiple of 24. Let's check option C: 120 รท 24 = 5, which is an integer, so that's correct.

Another way to verify is to find the LCM of 48 and 120 and see if it's indeed 240. Let's do that. To find the LCM, I can list the prime factors of each number.

48 can be broken down into prime factors as 2^4 * 3^1 (since 48 = 16 * 3, and 16 is 2^4).

120 breaks down into 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1 (since 120 = 8 * 15, and 8 is 2^3, 15 is 3 * 5).

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So, for 2, the highest power is 2^4 (from 48), for 3 it's 3^1, and for 5 it's 5^1. So, LCM is 16 * 3 * 5 = 16 * 15 = 240. That matches the given LCM, so yes, 120 is correct.

Wait a second, just to be thorough, let me check another option. For example, option E is 240. Let's see what the LCM of 48 and 240 would be. Since 240 is a multiple of 48 (240 รท 48 = 5), the LCM would actually be 240 itself. But the given LCM is 240, so that's correct. But wait, the GCD of 48 and 240 is 48, not 24. Because 48 divides into 240 exactly 5 times, so GCD is 48. But the problem states that GCD is 24, so 240 can't be the other number because that would make GCD 48, not 24. So, E is wrong.

Similarly, let's check option F: 80. Let's find GCD of 48 and 80. 48's factors are 2^4*3, 80 is 2^4*5. So, GCD is 2^4 = 16. But the problem says GCD is 24, so 80 isn't the correct answer.

Option G is 96. Let's compute GCD of 48 and 96. Since 48 divides into 96 exactly twice, GCD is 48. But the problem says GCD is 24, so no.

Option H is 12. Let's see, GCD of 48 and 12 is 12, which is less than 24. So, no.

Option I is 60. Let's check GCD of 48 and 60. 48 is 2^4*3, 60 is 2^2*3*5. So, GCD is 2^2*3=12, which is not 24. So, no.

Option J is 24. GCD of 48 and 24 is 24, which is correct. Now, what's the LCM of 48 and 24? Since 48 is a multiple of 24, LCM is 48. But the problem says LCM is 240, so that's not right either.

So, from checking all the options, only option C (120) gives both the correct GCD of 24 and LCM of 240. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C.

The other integer is 120, which satisfies both the LCM and GCD conditions.
