Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the cost of stock with a markup. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question says that the stock is worth $200,000 at retail, and the markup is 30% of the selling price. I need to find the cost in dollars, and the options are from A to J.

Hmm, first, I remember that markup can be calculated in different ways, either as a percentage of cost or as a percentage of selling price. In this case, it's 30% of the selling price. So, that means the markup is 30% of the selling price, not 30% of the cost. I think that's important because it changes how I calculate the cost.

Let me denote the selling price as SP and the cost as C. The markup is 30% of SP, so markup = 0.3 * SP. Since the selling price is the cost plus the markup, that would be SP = C + 0.3 * SP.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if I rearrange this equation to solve for C, I can subtract 0.3 * SP from both sides. Let's see:

SP = C + 0.3 SP  
C = SP - 0.3 SP  
C = 0.7 SP

Oh, right! So the cost is 70% of the selling price. Because 100% minus 30% markup is 70% cost. 

Given that the selling price (SP) is $200,000, the cost would be 70% of that. Let me calculate that:

C = 0.7 * 200,000  
C = 140,000

Wait, that can't be right. Because 30% markup on $200,000 would mean the cost is lower. Let me double-check. If the markup is 30% of SP, then SP = C + 0.3 SP. So, 0.7 SP = C. So yes, 70% of 200,000 is 140,000. Looking at the options, option C is $140,000. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes markup can be based on cost. Let me think again.

If the markup were based on cost, then markup = 0.3 * C, and SP = C + 0.3 C = 1.3 C. Then, C = SP / 1.3. But in this case, the markup is based on SP, so the equation is different. So my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the cost is 140,000, which is option C. But wait, that seems low. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because if the selling price is $200,000 and the markup is 30% of that, then the markup is $60,000. So the cost would be $200,000 minus $60,000, which is $140,000. That makes sense. So the answer should be C: $140,000.

The markup is 30% of the selling price, so the cost is 70% of the selling price. 70% of $200,000 is $140,000.
