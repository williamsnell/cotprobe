Okay, so I've got this problem about a three-input information channel, and I'm supposed to find the error probability P_E using a maximum-likelihood decision rule. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a channel matrix represents the probabilities of each input symbol being transformed into each output symbol. The given matrix is:

| 0.5 0.3 0.2 |
| 0.2 0.3 0.5 |
| 0.3 0.3 0.4 |

So each row corresponds to an input symbol, and each column to an output symbol. The three input symbols are equally probable, meaning each has a probability of 1/3.

Maximum-likelihood decision rule means that for each received output symbol, the decoder will choose the input symbol that maximizes the probability of that output given the input. So, for each output, I need to see which input has the highest transition probability to that output. The error probability is the sum over all outputs of the probability that the decoder makes a wrong decision for that output.

Wait, no, more accurately, for each output, the probability that the correct input was not the one that gives the highest probability for that output. So, the error probability P_E is the sum over all possible outputs of the probability that the correct input is not the one chosen by the maximum-likelihood rule for that output.

Let me think: for each output symbol y, I need to find the maximum probability P(y|x) among all x. Then, for each y, the error contribution is the sum of the probabilities of all x that don't give the maximum, multiplied by the prior probability of x.

Wait, actually, the formula I remember is:

P_E = sum_{y} sum_{x: x not equal to x_hat(y)} P(y|x) P(x)

Where x_hat(y) is the input that maximizes P(y|x). So for each output y, I find the best x (x_hat), and then sum all the probabilities where x is not x_hat, multiplied by their prior probabilities.

Since all P(x) are 1/3, this simplifies to sum over y [ (1 - max_x P(y|x)) * (1/3) ) ]

Wait, no. Because for each y, the total probability of x not equal to x_hat(y) is sum_{x≠x_hat} P(y|x) * P(x). But since P(x) is 1/3, it's (sum_{x≠x_hat} P(y|x)) * (1/3). So P_E is the sum over all y of [ (sum_{x≠x_hat(y)} P(y|x)) * (1/3) ) ].

But wait, for each y, the sum of P(y|x) over all x is 1, because each row sums to 1. So sum_{x≠x_hat} P(y|x) = 1 - P(y|x_hat). So, P_E = sum_y [ (1 - P(y|x_hat)) * (1/3) ]

Alternatively, since each y is possible, and for each y, the probability that the correct x wasn't the one that gave y is (1 - max_x P(y|x)) multiplied by the prior of x being correct, but actually, it's a bit more involved because the prior is 1/3 and the error is considering all x except the one that gives the maximum.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by checking for each output symbol y, which input x has the highest P(y|x), and then compute the error contributions.

Let me list the outputs as y0, y1, y2, corresponding to the columns. Wait, actually, in the channel matrix, rows are inputs and columns are outputs. So the first row is P(y0|x0)=0.5, P(y1|x0)=0.3, P(y2|x0)=0.2.

Wait, no, the way the matrix is presented is a bit ambiguous. Let me clarify. The channel matrix is usually represented as P(y| x), so each row is x, each column is y. So the first row is x0, and the columns are y0, y1, y2. So the entries are:

x0: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]
x1: [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
x2: [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]

So for each y, I need to find which x has the highest P(y|x). Let's go through each y:

For y0:
- P(y0|x0)=0.5
- P(y0|x1)=0.2
- P(y0|x2)=0.3
So the maximum is 0.5 (x0). So if y0 is received, the ML decision is x0. The error for this case is when the actual x was not x0, but the decoder chose x0. So the error contribution is P(x1)*P(y0|x1) + P(x2)*P(y0|x2) = (1/3)(0.2 + 0.3) = (1/3)(0.5) = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667.

Wait, no, wait. Because the error probability for y0 is the probability that the actual x was not x0, but the decoder chose x0. So the probability that x was x1 or x2, given y0. But since the prior is uniform, it's the sum over x≠x0 of P(x) * P(y0|x), which is (1/3)(0.2 + 0.3) = (1/3)(0.5) = 5/30.

Wait, but wait, that's not exactly correct. Because the error is the probability that the decoder makes a mistake given that y0 was received. So the probability that the actual x was not x0, given y0. But since we're calculating overall error probability, it's the a priori error, not conditional on y.

Hmm, maybe I should compute for each y, the probability that y occurs and the decision is wrong, then sum all those.

So for each y:

P(y and decision wrong) = P(y) * [sum_{x≠x_hat} P(x|y) P(x)].

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute for each y, the probability that y is received and the decision is wrong. So for each y:

P(error | y) = sum_{x≠x_hat(y)} P(x) P(y|x) / P(y)

But since P(y) = sum_x P(x) P(y|x), and P(x) is 1/3, P(y) = (1/3) sum_x P(y|x).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the total error as sum_{y} [ sum_{x≠x_hat(y)} P(y|x) * P(x) ].

Because P_E is the probability that the received y leads the decoder to choose a wrong x. So:

P_E = sum_{y} sum_{x≠x_hat(y)} P(y|x) * P(x)

Since P(x) is 1/3, it's (1/3) sum_{y} sum_{x≠x_hat(y)} P(y|x)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, for each y, determine x_hat(y):

y0: max P(y0|x) is 0.5 (x0)
y1: max P(y1|x) is 0.5 (x2, since P(y1|x2)=0.5)
y2: max P(y2|x) is 0.5 (x1, since P(y2|x1)=0.5)

Wait, let me check:

For y1:

x0:0.3, x1:0.3, x2:0.5 → max is 0.5 (x2)

For y2:

x0:0.2, x1:0.5, x2:0.4 → max is 0.5 (x1)

So for each y:

y0: x0 is best
y1: x2 is best
y2: x1 is best

Now, for each y, sum the P(y|x) for x≠x_hat(y):

y0: sum x≠x0 P(y0|x) = 0.2 (x1) + 0.3 (x2) = 0.5
y1: sum x≠x2 P(y1|x) = 0.3 (x0) + 0.3 (x1) = 0.6
y2: sum x≠x1 P(y2|x) = 0.2 (x0) + 0.4 (x2) = 0.6

Now, multiply each by P(x) (which is 1/3) and sum all:

P_E = (1/3)(0.5) + (1/3)(0.6) + (1/3)(0.6)

Calculating each term:

(1/3)(0.5) = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667
(1/3)(0.6) = 0.6/3 = 0.2
Another (1/3)(0.6) = 0.2

Adding them up: 0.1667 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.5667

But wait, 0.5667 is approximately 17/30, since 17 ÷ 30 ≈ 0.5667.

Looking at the options, option F is 17/30.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So for y0: sum of x≠x0 is 0.2+0.3=0.5 → 0.5*(1/3)=5/30 ≈0.1667
y1: sum is 0.3+0.3=0.6 → 0.6*(1/3)=6/30=0.2
y2: sum is 0.2+0.4=0.6 → 0.6*(1/3)=6/30=0.2

Adding them: 5/30 +6/30 +6/30 =17/30.

Yes, that's correct. So the error probability is 17/30, which is option F.
</think>

The error probability \( P_E \) is calculated by determining the maximum-likelihood decision for each output symbol and summing the contributions from incorrect decisions. For each output \( y \), the error contribution is the sum of the probabilities of all incorrect inputs multiplied by their prior probability. After evaluating each output, the total error probability is found to be \( \frac{17}{30} \).

**Answer: F**
