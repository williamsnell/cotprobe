Question:

A man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company, seeking damages for injuries he had sustained in an accident while riding a bus owned by the company. The man demanded a jury trial. After the parties' attorneys examined the prospective jurors and exercised their challenges, six jurors and two alternate jurors were chosen. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused.
B: No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.
C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.
D: Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.
E: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.
F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.
G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.
H: No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the jury size.
I: No, because the remaining jurors were sufficient to reach a unanimous decision.
J: Yes, because the man was not given a fair trial due to the reduced jury size.

Okay, so I have this question about federal civil procedure, specifically regarding jury trials. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a man suing a bus company for injuries. He demanded a jury trial. They selected six jurors and two alternates. During the trial, two jurors got sick and were replaced by the alternates. Then, before the trial ended, a third juror got sick and the court excused that juror. The attorneys agreed to let the remaining five jurors return a verdict. The jury did so, found in favor of the company, and now the man is asking for a new trial because he thinks the five-person jury wasn't enough.

The question is whether the court should grant his motion. The options are A through J, with various reasons given.

First, I remember that in federal courts, the usual jury size for civil cases is 12 jurors, but I think there's some flexibility. I recall that Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure deals with jury size. Specifically, Rule 48(b) allows the court to order fewer than 12 jurors if all the parties agree. Also, Rule 48(a) says that the jury must have at least 6 members unless the parties stipulate otherwise.

In this case, the parties did stipulate to a five-person jury. So, the first thought is whether the stipulation is valid. If the court allows it, then the verdict stands. But there's another angle: the replacement of jurors due to illness. 

Wait, initially, they had six jurors and two alternates. Two got sick and were replaced by alternates, making the jury back to six, right? Then, a third juror got sick at the end. The court excused that juror, leaving five. The attorneys then agreed to proceed with those five. 

I think Rule 48(a) requires a jury of at least six, unless the parties agree in writing to fewer. So, if the parties stipulated to five, that might be allowed. But here, the stipulation came after the third juror was excused. So, the initial jury was properly selected, but then during trial, a juror was excused. Does that affect the jury size?

Wait, no. The initial selection was six plus two alternates. Two were replaced, so the jury went back to six. Then, a third was excused, bringing it down to five. The parties then stipulated to proceed with five. So, the stipulation was after the reduction. But I'm not sure if that's allowed because the jury had to be at least six unless stipulated otherwise before the trial started.

Alternatively, maybe the court can reduce the jury size if there are insufficient jurors due to excusals, but I'm not certain. I think the key here is whether the stipulation was made before or after the trial started, and whether the court has the authority to reduce the jury size below six.

Wait, Rule 48(b) says the court may order fewer than 12 if the parties stipulate in writing that they do not object. But it doesn't mention what happens if the jury is reduced due to excusals during trial. So, if the jury is reduced because people get sick, does the court have the power to let them proceed with fewer than six? Or does the stipulation have to be made beforehand?

In this case, the stipulation was after the third juror was excused. So, perhaps the stipulation was made after the fact. I'm not sure if that's valid. The rule requires the stipulation to be in writing and before the jury is sworn, I think. Because the jury was already empaneled, the stipulation might not be allowed.

Wait, no, I think the stipulation can be made at any time, but the jury size can't be below six unless all parties agree. So, in this case, the jury went down to five, but the parties did agree. So, the verdict should stand.

But wait, the man is arguing that the jury wasn't large enough. So, the options are looking at whether the court should grant the motion. Let's look at the options.

Option C says yes because there must be at least six jurors. But if the parties stipulated, maybe that's allowed.

Option F says yes because the stipulation can't override federal requirements. But if the stipulation is allowed, then F would be incorrect.

Option G says no because the parties stipulated. So, if the stipulation is valid, G would be correct.

Option H says no because illness is a valid reason. But I think the rule requires stipulation, not just excusals.

Option I says no because the remaining jurors were sufficient. But the question is about the size, not their sufficiency.

So, the key is whether the stipulation after the fact is valid. If the stipulation must be made in writing before the jury is sworn, then the stipulation here wouldn't be valid, and the jury size would be insufficient. But I think the stipulation can be oral and made during the trial as well.

Wait, Rule 48(b) says the court may order fewer than 12 if the parties stipulate in writing that they do not object. It doesn't specify that the stipulation has to be before the jury is sworn. So, if they stipulated in writing, even during the trial, it might be okay. But in this case, the problem says the attorneys "stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury." It doesn't say they did it in writing. So, maybe they didn't comply with the rule.

Alternatively, maybe the court can reduce the jury size without a stipulation if there's a valid reason, like illness. But I don't think the rules allow that. The rule says the parties must stipulate, unless the court orders fewer on its own, but I don't think the court can do that unless the parties agree.

So, in this case, if the stipulation wasn't in writing, or if it wasn't done properly, then the jury size would be insufficient, and the motion for new trial should be granted.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention whether the stipulation was in writing. So, maybe the stipulation was oral. If the stipulation must be in writing, then perhaps the court can't rely on it, making the jury size insufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the court can reduce the jury size if there's a shortage due to excusals, even without a stipulation. But I'm not sure about that. I think the rule is that the jury must have at least six, unless all parties agree in writing.

In this case, if the stipulation was oral, then the jury size would be invalid, and the verdict should be set aside.

But the problem says the attorneys "stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury." It doesn't specify the form, but in court practice, sometimes stipulations can be oral. However, Rule 48(b) requires a written stipulation. So, if they didn't have a written stipulation, then the court can't order fewer than six.

If that's the case, then having a five-person jury would be invalid, and the motion for new trial should be granted. So, looking at the options, option F says yes because the stipulation can't override federal requirements. Or option C says yes because there must be at least six.

Wait, but if the stipulation was oral, then it wouldn't comply with Rule 48(b)'s requirement of a written stipulation. So, the court couldn't order fewer than six, making the five-person jury invalid. Therefore, the court should grant the motion.

Looking at the options, F says yes because the stipulation cannot override the requirements. C says yes because at least six are needed. But the stipulation is about whether they can have fewer than six. If the stipulation wasn't in writing, then the court can't allow fewer than six, so the verdict would be invalid.

Alternatively, if the stipulation was in writing, then it's allowed, and the verdict stands.

But the problem doesn't specify whether the stipulation was in writing. Hmm. The question says, "the parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury." It doesn't mention writing, so perhaps they didn't have a written stipulation.

If that's the case, the court can't order fewer than six, so the five-person jury is invalid. Therefore, the motion should be granted.

Looking back at the options, F says yes because the stipulation can't override the requirements. So, the answer would be F.

Wait, but another angle: the initial jury had six, then two were replaced, bringing it back to six. Then a third was excused, making five. The parties stipulated to proceed with five. If the stipulation was made in writing, then it's okay. If not, it's not.

But the question doesn't specify writing. So, perhaps the stipulation wasn't in writing, making it invalid. Therefore, the court should grant the motion.

So, the correct answer would be F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the rule allows the court to reduce the jury size if there are not enough jurors, even without a stipulation. But I don't think that's the case. The rule requires stipulation unless the court orders fewer, but I think the court can only order fewer if the parties stipulate.

So, if the stipulation wasn't in writing, then the court can't proceed with five, making the verdict invalid.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around whether a federal civil jury can consist of fewer than six jurors when parties stipulate to it after a juror is excused due to illness. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48, a jury must have at least six members unless the parties stipulate in writing to a smaller jury. In this case, the stipulation was made after a juror was excused, but the question does not specify whether the stipulation was in writing. If the stipulation was oral, it would not comply with the rule's requirement for a written agreement, making the five-person jury invalid. Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a new trial.
