Question:

If consumers are advised that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer, which of the following will happen in the market for multigrained bread?

Options:

A: The supply curve will shift to the right, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.
B: The demand curve will shift to the left, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.
C: The demand and supply curves will both shift to the left, keeping the price of multigrained bread stable.
D: The demand and supply curves will both shift to the right, keeping the price of multigrained bread stable.
E: The supply curve will shift to the left, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.
F: The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.
G: The supply curve will shift to the left, increasing the price of multigrained bread.
H: The supply curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.
I: The demand and supply curves will not be affected, keeping the price of multigrained bread stable.
J: The demand curve will shift to the left, increasing the price of multigrained bread.

Alright, so I've got this economics question here about the market for multigrained bread when consumers are told it reduces cancer risk. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question is asking what will happen in the market if consumers are advised that multigrained bread lowers the risk of cancer. The options are about how the demand and supply curves shift and what that means for the price.

Okay, so I remember that when consumer advice changes like this, it's a change in demand. If people think something is better for them, they'll probably want to buy more of it. So multigrained bread is seen as healthier, which could make people want to buy more. That should shift the demand curve to the right because more quantity is demanded at each price point. Right, so that would mean higher demand.

Now, what about supply? Well, supply is about how much producers are willing to sell at each price. If demand goes up, producers might respond by increasing production if it's profitable. But initially, before they adjust production, the supply curve might not shift right away. But wait, in the short term, maybe supply doesn't change much because it takes time to ramp up production. Or does the question consider that?

Wait, the options don't seem to have both demand and supply shifting in the same direction. Let me look again. Option D says both shift right, keeping price stable. Option F says only demand shifts right, increasing price. H says supply shifts right, increasing price. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about what happens in the market, so it's about the immediate effect. When demand increases, the demand curve shifts right. If supply remains the same, the price would go up because at the new higher demand, the equilibrium price increases.

So looking at the options, which one has the demand curve shifting right? Options F, D, and H. Option F says demand shifts right, increasing price. That makes sense because more people wanting the bread would drive up the price.

Wait, but what about supply? If the price goes up, wouldn't producers want to supply more? So in the long run, supply might increase, but the question is about the immediate effect. So initially, only the demand shifts right, leading to a higher price. So the correct answer should be F: The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.

I think that's it. So the answer is F.

The correct answer is F: The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.

Answer: F
