Okay, so I've got this question about convergent evolution, and I need to figure out which example best fits. Hmm, convergent evolution is when different species independently develop similar features because they're adapting to similar environments or needs. I remember that it's not about being closely related but about function.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. 

Option A: Gills of a fish and lungs of a human. Well, fish and humans are both vertebrates, but gills and lungs are different structures for breathing. I'm not sure if that's convergent because they evolved from a common ancestor, maybe.

Option B: Leaves of an oak and spines of a cactus. Both plants, but I don't see how these are analogous. Spines are modified leaves for protection, maybe? Not sure if that's convergent.

Option C: Eyes of human and squid. Both have complex eyes, but I think they evolved separately. Squid are invertebrates, so their eyes might have developed similarly to ours because of similar needs, like seeing in water. That sounds like convergent evolution.

Option D: Roots of a tree and legs of an animal. Not sure. Roots are for anchoring and absorbing, legs for moving. Doesn't seem related functionally.

Option E: Notochord in chordates. That's a common feature in embryos, so it's probably homologous, not convergent.

Option F: Bird's beak and mammal's teeth. Different structures for feeding. Maybe, but not sure if convergent.

Option G: Pectoral fins of fish and front legs of cats. Both have limbs but from different ancestors. Wait, fish and mammals share a common ancestor, so maybe they're homologous, not convergent.

Option H: Wings of insect and bird. Both use wings for flight, but insects and birds are not closely related. So that's a classic example of convergent evolution because their wings evolved independently for the same function.

Option I: Fur of bear and scales of fish. Different coverings for different purposes. Not convergent, more divergent.

Option J: Elephant's trunk and giraffe's neck. Both have long structures, but I don't think they serve the same function. Trunk is for grabbing, neck for reaching leaves. Maybe not convergent.

Wait, so H and C are possible. Let me think again. Eyes in humans and squids: both are complex eyes, but I think they evolved separately, so that's convergent. But wings in insects and birds are also a clear example. Which is more textbook? I remember the wings of bats, birds, and insects as examples of convergent evolution. So H would be the correct answer, as it's a textbook case.

The correct answer is **H: The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird**. This is a classic example of convergent evolution, where two unrelated species (insects and birds) independently developed wings for the purpose of flight. 

Answer: H
