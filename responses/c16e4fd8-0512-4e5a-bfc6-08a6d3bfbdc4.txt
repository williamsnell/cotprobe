Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about the energy gap in titanium dioxide (TiO₂) when an electron is promoted from the valence band to the conduction band upon absorbing light. The wavelength given is less than 350 nm, and I need to find the energy gap in electronvolts.

First, I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Since the electron absorbs a photon to jump bands, the energy of that photon must be equal to the energy gap between the bands. So, the energy gap should be the energy of the photon with wavelength λ, which is less than 350 nm. Wait, but the problem states that the wavelength required is less than 350 nm, so that would mean the photon's energy is higher than a certain value, which corresponds to the energy gap. Hmm, actually, I think the energy gap is the minimum energy needed, so the photon's energy must be at least equal to the gap. So if λ is less than 350 nm, then the photon's energy is higher than E = hc/(350e-9 m).

Let me jot down the constants I need. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. But since we're dealing with electronvolts, maybe it's easier to use a version of the equation that directly gives energy in eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. Alternatively, I think there's a shortcut formula where E(eV) = 1240 / λ(nm). Because 1240 eV·nm is approximately hc in units that work out to eV and nm. Let me check: hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Converting to eV·nm, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So hc in eV·nm would be (1.9878e-25 J·m) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) * (1 nm / 1e-9 m) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.602e-19) * 1e9 nm·eV. Wait, let me compute that.

1.9878e-25 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 1.24e-6. Then multiply by 1e9 nm gives 1.24e3, which is 1240 eV·nm. So yes, E(eV) = 1240 / λ(nm).

So the problem states that the wavelength λ is less than 350 nm. That means the photon's energy must be greater than 1240 / 350 eV. Let me compute that: 1240 divided by 350. 350 times 3 is 1050, 1240 - 1050 is 190. 190 divided by 350 is 0.5428. So 3.5428 eV approximately. So the energy gap must be at least 3.54 eV, because the photon's energy must be equal to or higher than the gap for the electron to be promoted. So the energy gap is E = 1240 / 350 ≈ 3.54 eV.

Looking at the options, option G is 3.54 eV. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me think again. If the wavelength is less than 350 nm, the energy is higher than 3.54 eV. So the energy gap is exactly when λ=350 nm, which is 3.54 eV. Since the wavelength is less than that, the photon's energy is higher than 3.54 eV. So the energy gap must be 3.54 eV, right? Because that's the minimum energy needed. So the gap is 3.54 eV, which is option G.

The energy gap in TiO₂ is calculated using the photon energy formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Using the shortcut \( E(\text{eV}) = \frac{1240}{\lambda(\text{nm})} \), for \( \lambda = 350 \, \text{nm} \), the energy gap is \( \frac{1240}{350} \approx 3.54 \, \text{eV} \). Since the wavelength is less than 350 nm, the photon energy exceeds 3.54 eV, confirming the energy gap is 3.54 eV.

Answer: G
