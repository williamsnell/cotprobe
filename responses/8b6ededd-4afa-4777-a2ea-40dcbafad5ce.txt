Okay, so I have this question about logical behaviorism and how it relates to our commonsense intuition about mental states. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement it's at odds with. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that logical behaviorism is a philosophical theory that defines mental states in terms of behavior. So, according to this view, mental states are not separate entities but are just ways of describing behavior. That means, for example, when someone says they're happy, a behaviorist would interpret that as certain behaviors or reactions rather than an internal state of being happy.

Now, the question is asking what our commonsense intuition is that logical behaviorism contradicts. The options are A to J. Let me go through each option and see which one makes sense.

Option A: cause behavior. Wait, but if mental states are just descriptions of behavior, then they wouldn't cause behavior because they are the behavior itself. So, if someone thinks that mental states cause behavior, that would be at odds with behaviorism. Because behaviorism says mental states are behavior, not something separate that causes it. So A might be the right answer.

Option B: are the same as behavioral states. No, wait, logical behaviorism actually says that mental states are the same as behavioral states. So B is actually in line with behaviorism, not against. So B is not the answer.

Option C: exist. Behaviorism might say that mental states exist as behaviors, but I'm not sure if that's the main point. Commonsense might believe mental states exist as internal things, but behaviorism might reduce them to behavior. Not sure yet.

Option D: can be directly observed. Behaviorism says mental states can't be directly observed, only inferred through behavior. But the question is about what commonsense says, so people might think mental states can be observed, but behaviorism doesn't. So D could be a point of conflict, but I'm not sure if it's the best option.

Option E: are always visible. Similar to D, but it's more about visibility. Commonsense might think some mental states are visible, but behaviorism would argue against that. But again, I'm not sure if this is the main point.

Option F: never interact with each other. That doesn't seem right. Commonsense might think mental states do interact, but behaviorism might say they don't because they're all just behaviors. Not sure if this is the focus.

Option G: are physical states. Behaviorism doesn't necessarily say they're physical; it's more about them being behavioral. So G might not be the direct contradiction.

Option H: can be measured quantitatively. Behaviorism might measure behavior, but whether they can be measured quantitatively is another point. Commonsense might think mental states can be measured, but I'm not certain.

Option I: do not cause behavior. Wait, this is the opposite of A. If I think A is correct, then I is the opposite. But the question is about what our intuition is that behaviorism contradicts. So if intuition says mental states cause behavior, then behaviorism would say they don't because they are the same as behavior, not causing it.

Option J: do not exist. Behaviorism doesn't say they don't exist; it says they're defined behaviorally. So J is not the answer.

So going back, the main point is that logical behaviorism reduces mental states to behavior, meaning they don't cause behavior because they are the behavior. So our commonsense intuition is that mental states cause behavior, which behaviorism contradicts. So the answer should be A.

Logical behaviorism defines mental states in terms of behavior, meaning they are not separate entities causing behavior but are instead descriptions of behavior itself. This contradicts the commonsense intuition that mental states cause behavior. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A

Answer: A
