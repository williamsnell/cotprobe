Okay, so I have this integral to compute: the double integral of xy² over a rectangle D where x ranges from 0 to 2 and y ranges from 0 to 1. Hmm, I remember that for double integrals over rectangles, I can separate the variables and integrate each part individually. Let me think step by step.

First, the integral is ∬_D xy² dA. Since D is a rectangle, I can write this as the product of two single integrals. So, maybe I can integrate with respect to x first and then y, or the other way around. Let me try integrating with respect to x first.

So, the integral becomes the integral from x=0 to x=2 of [integral from y=0 to y=1 of xy² dy] dx. Wait, no, actually, I think I should set it up as an iterated integral. Let me correct that: the double integral is equal to the integral from x=0 to 2 of [the integral from y=0 to 1 of xy² dy] dx.

So, first, I'll compute the inner integral with respect to y, treating x as a constant. The inner integral is ∫₀¹ xy² dy. Since x doesn't depend on y, I can factor it out: x ∫₀¹ y² dy. The integral of y² with respect to y is (y³)/3, so evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (1³)/3 - (0³)/3 = 1/3. So the inner integral becomes x*(1/3) = x/3.

Now, the outer integral is ∫₀² (x/3) dx. So, that's (1/3) ∫₀² x dx. The integral of x is (x²)/2, so evaluating from 0 to 2 gives (2²)/2 - 0 = 4/2 = 2. Multiply that by 1/3 gives (1/3)*2 = 2/3, which is approximately 0.66667.

Wait, but maybe I should check if I did that correctly. Alternatively, I could have integrated with respect to x first and then y. Let's try that approach to confirm.

So, the double integral can also be expressed as ∫₀¹ [∫₀² xy² dx] dy. Let's compute the inner integral ∫₀² xy² dx. Since y is treated as a constant here, the integral becomes y² ∫₀² x dx. The integral of x is (x²)/2, so evaluating from 0 to 2 gives (2²)/2 - 0 = 2. So the inner integral is y² * 2 = 2y².

Now, the outer integral is ∫₀¹ 2y² dy. The integral of y² is (y³)/3, so 2 times that is (2y³)/3. Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (2*(1)^3)/3 - 0 = 2/3. Again, that's approximately 0.66667.

So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the double integral is 2/3, which corresponds to option D: 0.66667.

The integral is computed by separating the variables and integrating step by step. Both orders of integration yield the same result, confirming the solution.
