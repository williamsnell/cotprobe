Okay, so I need to figure out the correct term for a burial site where the body decomposes naturally without a casket. Let me break this down. The question is asking about a type of cemetery, so it's related to burial practices. The key here is that the body isn't placed in a casket, so decomposition happens naturally, probably involving the body returning to the earth.

Looking at the options, I have A through J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Eco-friendly. Eco-friendly generally refers to environmentally friendly practices. While this could relate to a cemetery that uses sustainable methods, the term "eco-friendly cemetery" might not specifically describe a place where bodies decompose without a casket. It's more about the environmental impact, but not necessarily the method of decomposition.

Option B: Sunshine. That seems a bit off. I haven't heard of a "sunshine cemetery." It might refer to a place where the sun shines a lot, but that doesn't directly relate to decomposition without a casket.

Option C: Forest. A forest cemetery could make sense because forests are natural environments, and maybe bodies are buried there without caskets. However, I'm not sure if "forest" is the specific term used for this type of burial site.

Option D: Rapid decay. That doesn't seem right. Rapid decay would imply decomposition happening quickly, but the question isn't about the speed, it's about the method without a casket.

Option E: Organic. Organic relates to things made of natural materials. While the decomposition is organic, the term "organic cemetery" isn't commonly used to describe this specific burial practice.

Option F: Environmental. Similar to eco-friendly, this refers to environmental concerns. Again, it's about the impact rather than the method of decomposition.

Option G: Naturalistic. This sounds plausible. Naturalistic burial practices often involve allowing the body to decompose naturally, without caskets or other interventions. I've heard terms like "natural burial" or "naturalistic cemeteries" where the body is returned to nature without embalming or caskets.

Option H: Biodegradable. Biodegradable refers to materials that can be broken down by natural processes. While the body is biodegradable, the term "biodegradable cemetery" isn't the standard term used here.

Option I: Wild. A wild cemetery might imply a more natural, less maintained area, but I'm not sure if that's the specific term used for this type of burial site.

Option J: Green. Green is often associated with environmentally friendly practices, similar to eco-friendly. While a green cemetery might use sustainable methods, it's not necessarily the same as a naturalistic one where decomposition without a casket is the focus.

Putting it all together, the term that best fits is "naturalistic" because it directly refers to a burial method that allows natural decomposition without a casket. So, the answer should be G.

The correct term for a burial site where the body decomposes naturally without a casket is a "naturalistic" cemetery. This type of cemetery emphasizes allowing the body to return to nature without the use of caskets or other interventions. 

Answer: G
