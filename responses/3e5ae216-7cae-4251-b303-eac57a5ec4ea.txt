Okay, so I need to figure out the target keys for node N6 in a Chord network. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys, and the target keys are the ones that a node is responsible for. The identifier space is 16, so the possible identifiers are from 0 to 15, right? But wait, the problem says the size is 16, so maybe it's 16 nodes? Or is it that the identifier space is divided into 16 parts? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. I think the size refers to the number of possible identifiers, so they go from 0 to 15.

The active nodes are N3, N6, N8, and N12. So these four nodes are the ones that are up and running. The other nodes (like N0, N1, N2, etc.) might not be active, so their keys are handled by the active nodes.

In Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys. The range for a node N with identifier i is [i, next(i)), where next(i) is the identifier of the next active node in the ring. So the target keys for N6 would be the keys from N6's identifier up to, but not including, the next active node's identifier.

Wait, but how do I determine the next active node for N6? The active nodes are N3, N6, N8, N12. So arranged in order, the identifiers are 3, 6, 8, 12. The next node after N6 would be N8 because 8 comes after 6. So the next identifier is 8.

So the range for N6 is [6, 8). But wait, in Chord, the next node is the smallest identifier larger than the current node. So for N6, the next node is N8 (8). So the keys that N6 is responsible for are from 6 up to, but not including, 8. So that would be 6 and 7. But wait, the identifier space is 16, so the wrap-around might come into play.

Wait, but when we're considering the keys, each node is responsible for a range of (m) keys, where m is the number of bits in the identifier space. Since the size is 16, m is 4 bits, so each node is responsible for 2^m = 16 keys. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2^4 is 16, but the identifier space is 16, so each node is responsible for exactly one key? No, that can't be right. Oh, wait, no. Maybe each node is responsible for a range of keys equal to the number of bits. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of bits with the size. Let me think again.

In Chord, the number of bits m determines how the keys are hashed. The maximum number of keys is 2^m. Here, the identifier space is 16, so m is 4 because 2^4 = 16. So each node is responsible for 2^(m-1) = 8 keys. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, in Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys of size 2^(m-1). So with m=4, each node handles 8 keys. But the total number of keys is 16, so with four nodes, each handling 8 keys, that would cover all 32 keys, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, perhaps the identifier space is 16, so the maximum node identifier is 15. Each node is responsible for a range of (max_id + 1)/number_of_active_nodes. But since the active nodes are only four, each would have a range of 16/4 = 4 keys. So each node is responsible for 4 consecutive keys. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, in Chord, the nodes form a ring, and each node is responsible for a range of keys equal to the number of bits divided by two. So with m=4, each node handles 2^(m-1) = 8 keys. But that would mean each node is responsible for 8 keys, and with four active nodes, that would cover 32 keys, but the identifier space is only 16. So I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe the identifier space is 16, meaning each key is a 4-bit number from 0 to 15. Each node is responsible for a range of keys equal to half the total, so 8 keys. So with four nodes, each handling 8 keys, that would cover all 32 keys, which is more than the 16 identifier space. That doesn't add up. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each node is responsible for a range of (max_id + 1)/number_of_active_nodes. So with 16 identifiers and four active nodes, each node is responsible for 4 keys. So N3 would handle 3,4,5,6? Or wait, maybe the ranges are determined by the next active node. So for N3, the next node is N6, so the range is [3,6). That would include 3,4,5. Then N6's next is N8, so [6,8) includes 6,7. Then N8's next is N12, so [8,12) includes 8,9,10,11. Then N12's next is N3 (since it wraps around), so [12,3) which would be 12,13,14,15,0,1,2. Wait, but that's 8 nodes, but our active nodes are four. Hmm, perhaps this approach is correct.

So for N6, the range is [6,8), which includes 6 and 7. But the question is about the target keys, which are the keys that the node is responsible for, excluding its own identifier. So N6's target keys would be 6 and 7. But wait, the options don't have just 6 and 7. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, the possible target key lists are:

A: [7,10,13,14]
B: [7,9,12,15]
C: [7,8,10,14]
D: [7,8,12,14]
E: [7,9,11,13]
F: [6,8,10,14]
G: [6,7,9,11]
H: [8,9,11,13]
I: [3,6,8,12]
J: [8,10,12,14]

Hmm, none of these have just 6 and 7. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I need to consider that each node is responsible for a range of keys equal to half the identifier space, which is 8 keys.

So for N6, the range would be from 6 to (6+8)=14, but that wraps around because 15 is the max. So the range would be 6 to 14, but since 15 is the max, it's 6-14, which is 9 keys. But that's more than 8. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is that each node is responsible for [i, (i + 2^(m-1)) mod 2^m). So for m=4, 2^(m-1)=8. So for N6, the range is from 6 to (6+8)=14. So keys 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. But since the identifier space is 16, 15 is the max, so 14 is included. So N6's target keys are 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

But the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself, so we exclude 6. So the target keys would be 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. But the options only have four elements. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the target keys are the successor nodes' identifiers. Or perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, which are the keys in its range, excluding its own identifier. So for N6, the range is [6,8), which includes 6 and 7. Excluding 6, the target key is 7. But the options don't have just 7.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the keys that N6 is responsible for, which are the keys in its range. Since each node is responsible for 8 keys (because m=4, 2^3=8), the range for N6 would be 6 to 13 (since 6+8=14, but mod 16, so 6-13). So the keys are 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Excluding 6, the target keys are 7,8,9,10,11,12,13. But again, the options have only four elements.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the active nodes are fewer than the total number of possible nodes, so the ranges are determined by the closest active nodes. So for N6, the next active node is N8. So the range is [6,8), which includes 6 and 7. So the target keys are 7 (excluding 6). But again, the options don't match.

Alternatively, maybe the target keys are the keys that would be stored in the node's successor. Wait, in Chord, each node's target keys are those in its range but not including itself. So perhaps the target keys are those that the node would store, which are the keys in its range except itself.

But given the options, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, which are the keys in its range, excluding its own identifier. So for N6, the range is [6,8), so keys 6 and 7. Excluding 6, the target key is 7. But the options don't have just 7.

Wait, perhaps the size of the identifier space is 16, meaning each key is a 4-bit number (0-15). The active nodes are N3 (3), N6 (6), N8 (8), N12 (12). So the ring is arranged as 3,6,8,12, and then back to 3.

Each node's range is from its identifier up to the next node's identifier. So:

- N3's range is [3,6), which includes 3,4,5.
- N6's range is [6,8), which includes 6,7.
- N8's range is [8,12), which includes 8,9,10,11.
- N12's range is [12,3), which wraps around to include 12,13,14,15,0,1,2.

So for N6, the target keys are 6 and 7. But the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself, so we exclude 6. So the only target key is 7. But none of the options have just 7. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to store, which are the keys in its range, excluding itself. So N6's target keys would be 7. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, which are the keys in its range, including itself, but the question says to ignore the node's identifier. So maybe the target keys are just 7.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the target keys are the keys that the node's successor is responsible for. Or perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to route requests for.

Wait, in Chord, each node is responsible for a range of keys, and the target keys are all the keys in that range except the node's own identifier. So for N6, the range is [6,8), so keys 6 and 7. Excluding 6, the target key is 7. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node's successor is responsible for. So N6's successor is N8. N8's range is [8,12), which includes 8,9,10,11. So the target keys for N6 would be these, but that doesn't match any option either.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to list all the keys that N6 is responsible for, including those beyond its immediate range. Or perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to store, which are the keys in its range, excluding itself. So for N6, that's 7. But again, none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the concept. Let me think again. In Chord, each node has a finger table that points to the next node responsible for a certain key. The target keys for a node are the keys that fall within its range. So for N6, the target keys are the keys from 6 up to, but not including, the next active node's identifier, which is 8. So the target keys are 6 and 7. Excluding 6, it's just 7. But the options don't have this.

Wait, maybe the target keys are all the keys in the identifier space that are not covered by other active nodes. So let's see:

Active nodes are N3, N6, N8, N12.

N3 covers [3,6): 3,4,5.

N6 covers [6,8):6,7.

N8 covers [8,12):8,9,10,11.

N12 covers [12,3):12,13,14,15,0,1,2.

So the keys are:

0,1,2: N12

3,4,5: N3

6,7: N6

8,9,10,11: N8

12,13,14,15: N12

So the target keys for N6 are 6 and 7. But the question says to ignore the node's identifier, so only 7 is the target key. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to store in its own table. So for N6, it would store keys 6 and 7. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, including its own identifier, and then we exclude it. So for N6, the target keys would be 6 and 7, but excluding 6, it's just 7. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the target keys that N6 is supposed to route requests to. In that case, for any key k in N6's range, N6 would route it to itself, except for keys equal to its own identifier. So the target key is just 7. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6's successor is responsible for. N6's successor is N8, which handles [8,12). So the target keys would be 8,9,10,11. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is [7,8,10,14]. Hmm, 7 is in N6's range, 8 is N8's start, 10 is in N8's range, and 14 is in N12's range. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is supposed to store in its table, which are the keys in its range. So 6 and 7. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the target keys are the keys that N6 is responsible for, plus the keys that are in the ranges of the nodes it points to in its finger table. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it differently. The target keys for a node are the keys that are in the node's range, excluding its own identifier. So for N6, the range is [6,8), which includes 6 and 7. Excluding 6, the target key is 7. But since the options don't have just 7, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the size of the identifier space is 16, so the keys are 0-15. The active nodes are N3, N6, N8, N12. So each node's range is from their identifier to the next active node's identifier.

So N3's range is [3,6), which includes 3,4,5.

N6's range is [6,8), which includes 6,7.

N8's range is [8,12), which includes 8,9,10,11.

N12's range is [12,3), which includes 12,13,14,15,0,1,2.

So the target keys for N6 are 6 and 7. Excluding 6, it's just 7. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is responsible for, which are 6 and 7. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, maybe the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, including itself, but the question says to ignore the node's identifier. So for N6, the target keys are 6 and 7, but we exclude 6, leaving 7. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to store, which are the keys in its range, excluding itself. So N6's target keys are 7. But the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step. Maybe the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, which are calculated using the formula: for a node i, the target keys are (i + k * 2^(m-1)) mod 2^m, where k ranges from 0 to (number of active nodes -1). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node's successor is responsible for. So N6's successor is N8, which is responsible for [8,12). So the target keys would be 8,9,10,11. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at option C: [7,8,10,14]. 7 is in N6's range, 8 is N8's start, 10 is in N8's range, and 14 is in N12's range. Maybe that's a combination of N6's range and the next node's range. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is responsible for, which are 6 and 7, and the keys that N6's successor is responsible for, which are 8-11. But that would be 6,7,8,9,10,11. Excluding 6, it's 7,8,9,10,11. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is supposed to route to. So for any key in N6's range, it's stored in N6. For keys outside, it's routed to the appropriate node. So the target keys for N6 are the keys in its range, which are 6 and 7. Excluding itself, it's 7. But again, the options don't have that.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's list all the active nodes and their ranges:

N3: [3,6) → 3,4,5

N6: [6,8) → 6,7

N8: [8,12) →8,9,10,11

N12: [12,3) →12,13,14,15,0,1,2

So the target keys for N6 are the keys in [6,8), which are 6 and 7. Excluding 6, the target key is 7. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6's finger table points to. In Chord, each node has fingers pointing to nodes responsible for certain ranges. For N6, the finger table would point to nodes for ranges like 6+8=14, which is beyond 8, so it wraps around. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, which are 6 and 7. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is [7,8,10,14]. 7 is in N6's range, 8 is N8's start, 10 is in N8's range, and 14 is in N12's range. Maybe this is the result of considering the next few nodes' ranges. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node's successor's successor is responsible for. N6's successor is N8, whose successor is N12. N12's range is [12,3), which includes 12,13,14,15,0,1,2. So the target keys would be 12,13,14,15,0,1,2. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that are in the node's range plus the ranges of the next two nodes. So N6's range is [6,8), N8's is [8,12), and N12's is [12,3). So combining these, the keys would be 6-11 and 12-15, but that's too many.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, which are 6 and 7, and the keys that the node's successor is responsible for, which are 8-11. So the target keys would be 6,7,8,9,10,11. Excluding 6, it's 7,8,9,10,11. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at option C: [7,8,10,14]. It includes 7 (N6's range), 8 (N8's start), 10 (N8's range), and 14 (N12's range). Maybe this is the result of considering the node's range and some other ranges. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node is responsible for, plus the keys that are in the ranges of the nodes it points to in its finger table. But I'm not sure how that would work.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's list all the keys and see which node is responsible for each:

Key 0: N12

Key 1: N12

Key 2: N12

Key 3: N3

Key 4: N3

Key 5: N3

Key 6: N6

Key 7: N6

Key 8: N8

Key 9: N8

Key10: N8

Key11: N8

Key12: N12

Key13: N12

Key14: N12

Key15: N12

So for N6, the target keys are 6 and 7. Excluding 6, it's just 7. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is asking for the target keys that N6 is supposed to store, which are 6 and 7. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6's predecessor is responsible for. N6's predecessor is N3, which handles 3,4,5. But that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6's successor is responsible for. N6's successor is N8, which handles 8-11. So the target keys would be 8,9,10,11. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at option C again: [7,8,10,14]. 7 is in N6's range, 8 is N8's start, 10 is in N8's range, and 14 is in N12's range. Maybe this is the result of considering the keys in N6's range and the next node's range. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is responsible for, which are 6 and 7, and the keys that the node's successor is responsible for, which are 8-11. So the target keys would be 6,7,8,9,10,11. Excluding 6, it's 7,8,9,10,11. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the successor's target keys. So N6's successor is N8, whose target keys are 8,9,10,11. But that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is responsible for, which are 6 and 7, and the keys that N6's predecessor is responsible for, which are 3,4,5. So the target keys would be 3,4,5,6,7. Excluding 6, it's 3,4,5,7. But that's not matching any option.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the target keys are the keys that the node is supposed to point to in its finger table. In Chord, each node has a finger table that points to nodes responsible for certain ranges. For N6, the finger table would have entries for 6+8=14, which wraps around. So the node responsible for 14 is N12. So the target key for N6's finger at distance 1 is 14. Similarly, for other distances, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that the node's finger table points to. So for N6, the finger table entries would point to the nodes responsible for 6+1=7, 6+2=8, 6+4=10, 6+8=14. So the target keys would be 7,8,10,14. That matches option C: [7,8,10,14].

Yes, that makes sense. In Chord, each node's finger table contains entries for keys at distances 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., up to 2^(m-1). So for N6, the finger table would have:

- finger[1] = (6 +1) mod 16 =7 → N6 is responsible for 7.
- finger[2] = (6 +2) mod 16=8 → N8 is responsible for 8.
- finger[4] = (6 +4)=10 → N8 is responsible for 10.
- finger[8] = (6 +8)=14 → N12 is responsible for 14.

So the target keys for N6's finger table are 7,8,10,14. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: [7,8,10,14].
</think>

In Chord, each node's target keys are determined by its range and the finger table entries. The active nodes are N3 (3), N6 (6), N8 (8), and N12 (12), with the identifier space size of 16. The ranges for each node are as follows:

- **N3**: [3, 6) → keys 3, 4, 5  
- **N6**: [6, 8) → keys 6, 7  
- **N8**: [8, 12) → keys 8, 9, 10, 11  
- **N12**: [12, 3) → keys 12, 13, 14, 15, 0, 1, 2  

For N6, the target keys are the keys in its range, excluding its own identifier (6). Thus, the target key is **7**. However, the finger table entries for N6 point to the nodes responsible for keys at specific distances:

- **finger[1]**: \( (6 + 1) \mod 16 = 7 \)  
- **finger[2]**: \( (6 + 2) \mod 16 = 8 \)  
- **finger[4]**: \( (6 + 4) \mod 16 = 10 \)  
- **finger[8]**: \( (6 + 8) \mod 16 = 14 \)  

These correspond to the keys **7, 8, 10, 14**, which match the target keys listed in **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
