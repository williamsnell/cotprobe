Okay, so I've got this question about estimating the radius of the nucleus of mercury. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the radius R varies with the atomic weight A according to the formula R = 1.2 × 10^-13 A^(1/3) cm. I'm supposed to use this formula to find the radius for mercury.

Wait, mercury's atomic weight. I remember mercury has an atomic number around 80. Let me think—yes, mercury's symbol is Hg, and its atomic number is 80, which is approximately its atomic weight in grams per mole, right? So A is about 80.

Now, plugging into the formula: R = 1.2e-13 * (A)^(1/3). So I need to compute the cube root of 80 first.

What's the cube root of 80? Let me think. The cube of 4 is 64, and the cube of 5 is 125. So 80 is between 64 and 125, so the cube root should be between 4 and 5. Let me approximate it.

Let me try 4.3^3: 4.3 *4.3 =18.49, then 18.49 *4.3. Let's compute that: 18 *4.3 is about 77.4, and 0.49 *4.3 is about 2.09. So total is around 79.49, which is very close to 80. So cube root of 80 is approximately 4.3.

So then R = 1.2e-13 cm * 4.3. Let me calculate that: 1.2 *4.3 is about 5.16. So R ≈5.16e-13 cm.

Looking at the options, option C is 5e-13 cm. That seems to match. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A:10 ×10^-13 cm → too big
B:12 × → way too big
C:5 × → matches my calc
D:6 → higher than 5.16, but maybe I should check my cube root again.

Wait, maybe I was a bit off with the cube root. Let me see. Since 4.3^3 is about 79.5, which is very close to 80. So cube root of 80 is approximately 4.3, so 1.2 *4.3 is 5.16, which is about 5.16e-13 cm. So option C is 5e-13, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe the question expects rounding to one decimal place, but let's see if any other options are close.

Looking at the options, option C is 5 ×10^-13 cm, which is exactly what I got. So the answer should be C.

The radius of the mercury nucleus is calculated using R = 1.2 × 10^-13 cm multiplied by the cube root of its atomic weight, A=80. The cube root of 80 is approximately 4.3. Multiplying this by 1.2 gives R ≈ 5.16 × 10^-13 cm, which rounds to 5 × 10^-13 cm. 

Answer: C
