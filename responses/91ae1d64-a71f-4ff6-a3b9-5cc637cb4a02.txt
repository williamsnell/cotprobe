Okay, so I've got this problem about a nonlinear capacitor, and I need to find the current through it. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question gives me the nonlinear characteristic of the capacitor as q(t) = 0.5 ν²(t), where q is the charge and ν is the voltage across it. And the voltage is given as ν(t) = 1 + 0.5 sin t. I remember that current through a capacitor is the derivative of the charge with respect to time, so i(t) = dq/dt. 

So first, I need to find q(t) by plugging ν(t) into the given equation. Let me write that out: q(t) = 0.5 * [1 + 0.5 sin t]^2. Expanding this squared term might help. Let me compute that. 

Expanding [1 + 0.5 sin t]^2 gives 1^2 + 2*(1)*(0.5 sin t) + (0.5 sin t)^2. So that's 1 + sin t + 0.25 sin² t. Now multiply by 0.5: q(t) = 0.5*(1 + sin t + 0.25 sin² t). Let's compute that. 

0.5*1 is 0.5, 0.5*sin t is 0.5 sin t, and 0.5*0.25 sin² t is 0.125 sin² t. So q(t) = 0.5 + 0.5 sin t + 0.125 sin² t. 

Now, to find the current i(t), I need to take the derivative of q(t) with respect to time. Let's compute dq/dt. 

The derivative of 0.5 is 0. The derivative of 0.5 sin t is 0.5 cos t. Then, the derivative of 0.125 sin² t. Hmm, I think I need to use the chain rule here. The derivative of sin² t is 2 sin t cos t, so 0.125 * 2 sin t cos t is 0.25 sin t cos t. 

Wait, but wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. So, d/dt [sin² t] = 2 sin t cos t. So yes, 0.125 * 2 sin t cos t is 0.25 sin t cos t. 

So putting it all together, i(t) = dq/dt = 0.5 cos t + 0.25 sin t cos t. 

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this form. Wait, perhaps I can simplify 0.25 sin t cos t. I remember that sin(2t) = 2 sin t cos t, so sin t cos t is (1/2) sin 2t. So 0.25 sin t cos t = 0.25 * (1/2) sin 2t = 0.125 sin 2t. 

So substituting that back, i(t) = 0.5 cos t + 0.125 sin 2t. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this. 

Looking at the options, option G is i(t) = 0.5 cos t + 0.125 sin 2t. That's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be G. 

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again quickly. 

1. q(t) = 0.5 [1 + 0.5 sin t]^2. Expanding gives 0.5*(1 + sin t + 0.25 sin² t) = 0.5 + 0.5 sin t + 0.125 sin² t. 

2. Take derivative: dq/dt = 0 + 0.5 cos t + 0.125 * 2 sin t cos t. 0.125 * 2 is 0.25, so that's 0.25 sin t cos t. 

3. Simplify 0.25 sin t cos t to 0.125 sin 2t. 

4. So i(t) = 0.5 cos t + 0.125 sin 2t, which is option G. 

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer must be G.

The current through the capacitor is found by differentiating the charge, resulting in i(t) = 0.5 cos t + 0.125 sin 2t, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
