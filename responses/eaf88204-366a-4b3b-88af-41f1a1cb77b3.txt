Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the alternative form of 'network organization'. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what a network organization is. From what I remember, traditional organizations have a hierarchical structure where there's a clear chain of command. But network organizations are different. They probably rely more on collaboration and less on a strict hierarchy. 

The question is asking about the alternative form, so it's likely referring to how a network organization operates differently. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says the company operates solely through social media platforms. That seems more about the tools used rather than the organizational structure itself. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option B suggests the company has no physical office and everything is done online. That's similar to remote work, which is a trend, but I don't think it's the essence of a network organization. It's more about the location of work, not the structure.

Option C states each department works independently with no interaction. That sounds like the opposite of a network organization, which thrives on collaboration. So probably not C.

Option D says work can be subcontracted to independent suppliers and retailers. This rings a bell. I think network organizations often use external partners and subcontractors because they can be more flexible and cost-effective. This seems like a key characteristic.

Option E is about all employees working remotely. Again, that's more about where work is done rather than how the organization is structured. It doesn't define a network organization specifically.

Option F talks about business transactions only through electronic communication. While technology is important, this option is more about communication methods, not the organizational structure.

Option G mentions multiple branch offices. That's more about physical presence and expansion, which doesn't directly relate to the network model.

Option H suggests no hierarchy, everyone is at the same level. While network organizations are more flat, they might still have some structure. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit because the question is about the alternative form, which is the network approach itself.

Option I refers to the Japanese model with lateral networks and flexible roles. I'm not too familiar with the Japanese model, but I think the network organization is a more general concept, so I might rule this out unless I'm certain.

Option J is about equal distribution of activities between genders. That's more about diversity and inclusion, which is a good practice, but not directly related to the structure of a network organization.

So, putting it together, the key idea of a network organization is collaboration and leveraging external partners. Option D seems to fit because subcontracting to independent suppliers and retailers allows the company to focus on its core competencies and flexibly scale operations without the overhead of a traditional structure.

I think the answer is D.

The alternative form of 'network organization' emphasizes collaboration and flexibility by subcontracting tasks to external partners, allowing the company to focus on its core competencies. 

Answer: D
