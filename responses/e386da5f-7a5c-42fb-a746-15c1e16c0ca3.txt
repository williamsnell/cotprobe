Okay, so I have this question about Singer's view on international corporations dealing with corrupt dictators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Singer's arguments, but I'll try to think it through.

First, Singer is known for his work on ethics, particularly in the areas of globalization, corporate responsibility, and human rights. I remember he wrote about how multinational corporations can contribute to or be complicit in human rights abuses. So when the question says international corporations dealing with corrupt dictators are akin to something, I think it's about their role in enabling these dictators' actions.

The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Accomplices in the dictator's crimes. That makes sense because if a corporation knowingly deals with a corrupt dictator, they might be supporting or enabling their harmful actions. Accomplice implies they're helping in the crime.

Option B: People who knowingly buy stolen goods. This is about knowingly supporting something illegal or unethical. If the corporation is aware that the dictator is using stolen goods or resources, they could be seen this way. But Singer's focus might be more on the systemic support rather than just buying stolen goods.

Option C: Thieves who steal from the poor. This could relate to how corporations might exploit resources or labor in poor countries, enriching themselves at the expense of the local population. But I'm not sure if this is the primary analogy Singer uses.

Option D: Merchants who sell harmful products. This would be if the corporations are selling goods that are harmful, like weapons or dangerous substances. Maybe, but I think the issue is more about enabling the regime rather than the product itself.

Option E: War profiteers exploiting conflict. War profiteers benefit from conflicts, which might be similar, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what Singer is saying here. It's more about profiting from war rather than supporting a corrupt ruler.

Option F: Prostitutes who knowingly spread disease. That seems too specific and perhaps a bit harsh. I don't recall Singer using such a strong analogy here.

Option G: Bystanders who ignore injustice. This could be a possibility, implying that by not taking a stand, they're allowing the injustice to continue. But the question says they "deal with" the dictators, which might imply active complicity rather than just ignoring.

Option H: Politicians who accept bribes. This is interesting because it's about corruption on both sides, but I'm not sure if that's the direct analogy Singer uses for corporations.

Option I: All of the above. This would mean that the correct answer includes all the previous options. But I think Singer's point is more specific, so maybe not all of them.

Option J: Murderers of those who witness crimes. That's a very strong statement, perhaps too strong. I don't think that's the case here.

So, putting it together, Singer likely views these corporations as accomplices because they provide support (like resources, legitimacy, or financial backing) to dictators, thereby aiding their crimes. Option A seems the most direct. But wait, could it be that the answer includes multiple points? Like, they might be both accomplices and exploiters. But looking at the options, I think A is the primary choice.

The question asks about Singer's view of international corporations dealing with corrupt dictators. Singer likely sees them as accomplices, as they enable the dictators' crimes through support and resources.
