Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which factor is most related to a child's successful adjustment after their parents' divorce. The question gives me options from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to think about what research says about how kids handle their parents' divorce. I remember reading somewhere that the quality of the relationship between the child and each parent before the divorce plays a big role. If the child had a strong, healthy bond with both parents, that might help them cope better with the changes. So that would point towards option A.

Option B talks about post-divorce conflict. I think when parents argue a lot after the divorce, it can really stress the child out, so that's probably bad for adjustment. But the question is asking what's most related to successful adjustment, so maybe high conflict is a negative factor, but is it the most related? I'm not sure.

Option C is about academic performance before the divorce. I don't think a child's grades are directly linked to how well they adjust to their parents' divorce. Maybe it's more about emotional adjustment than academic.

Option D is about contact with the noncustodial parent. Some kids might do better with more contact, but I'm not sure if it's the most significant factor. It could vary a lot depending on other factors too.

Option E is the child's gender. I don't recall any major studies suggesting that gender itself is a primary factor in adjustment. Boys and girls might handle it differently, but it's probably not the main factor.

Option F is socio-economic status. While financial stability can affect stress levels, I don't think it's the most direct factor related to adjustment. It's more about the emotional environment.

Option G is the remarriage of the custodial parent. Remarriage can bring new dynamics, but I don't think it's the most crucial factor for initial adjustment.

Option H is the number of siblings. More siblings might provide support, but again, it's probably not the most significant factor.

Option I is the child's age at divorce. I think younger children might have different adjustment issues than older ones, but it's not clear if age is the most related factor.

Option J is the child's understanding of the divorce cause. Some understanding might help, but I'm not sure if it's the primary factor. Kids might not need to know the exact reasons to adjust well.

Putting it all together, the most consistent factor I've heard about is the strength of the parent-child relationships before the divorce. So I think the answer is A.

The answer is A: the quality of the parent-child relationships prior to the divorce. Research highlights that strong, healthy bonds with both parents before the divorce significantly influence a child's successful adjustment. While other factors like post-divorce conflict or contact with the noncustodial parent can affect adjustment, the pre-existing quality of relationships is the most critical factor.

Answer: A
