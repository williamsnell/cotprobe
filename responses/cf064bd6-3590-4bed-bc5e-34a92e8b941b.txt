Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about using Gauss's Law to find the force on a mass inside a deep hole in the Earth. Hmm, I remember Gauss's Law is related to electric fields, but wait, this is about gravity. Oh right, there's a version of Gauss's Law for gravity too, right? Yeah, kind of like how for electric fields you use a Gaussian surface, but for gravity, it's similar but with mass instead of charge.

The problem states that the force on a mass placed in a deep hole is due to the matter in the spherical portion below the hole. So, that means anything above the mass in the Earth doesn't contribute to the gravitational force because the mass inside a spherical shell cancels out. So, the Earth's density being constant is important here.

We need to find the force on 1 kg at depths of 1/4 and 1/2 the Earth's radius. I think the formula for gravitational acceleration inside a uniformly dense sphere is different from the surface. On the surface, it's GM/R², but inside, it's proportional to r, the distance from the center, right? Oh wait, the formula is g = G*M(r)/r², where M(r) is the mass enclosed within radius r.

Since the density is constant, the mass inside radius r would be (4/3)πr³ * density. The total mass of the Earth is (4/3)πR³ * density, so M(r) = (r³/R³) * M_total. Substituting that into g, we get g = G*(r³/R³ * M_total) / r² = G*M_total * r / R³. But wait, since GM_total/R² is the surface gravity, let's call that g0. So, g = g0 * (r/R).

Wait, that makes sense because as you go deeper, the gravitational acceleration decreases linearly with r.

So, for r = R/4 (depth is 1/4 radius), the force on 1 kg would be m * g = 1 kg * (g0 * (R/4)/R) = (1/4) g0. Similarly, for r = R/2, the force would be (1/2) g0.

The standard surface gravity g0 is approximately 9.81 m/s². So, at R/4, the force is about 9.81/4 ≈ 2.45 N, and at R/2, it's 9.81/2 ≈ 4.905 N. Wait, but none of the options exactly match these numbers. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option H says 6.00 and 4.00 N. That's higher than what I calculated. Hmm, what did I do wrong? Oh wait, maybe I mixed up the radius. No, the depth is 1/4 and 1/2 of the Earth's radius, so the distance from the center would be R - depth. Wait, no, because if the depth is measured from the surface, then the distance from the center is R minus depth. But wait, no, when you are at depth d, your distance from the center is R - d. But wait, the problem says the mass is placed at a depth of 1/4 and 1/2 of the Earth's radius. So, R is Earth's radius, and depth h is R/4 and R/2. So, the distance from the center is R - h.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, let's think: if the Earth has radius R, and you dig a hole to depth h, then the mass is at a distance r = R - h from the center. But wait no, actually, if the hole is at depth h, then the mass is inside the Earth at a distance r = R - h from the center. So, for h = R/4, r = R - R/4 = (3/4) R. For h = R/2, r = R - R/2 = R/2.

Wait, that's a different approach. Because earlier I thought the depth is the distance from the center, but maybe the depth is from the surface. So, the formula would then be g = G*M_enclosed(r)/r², where r is the distance from the center, which is R - h.

Wait, let's clarify. If the depth is h = R/4, then the distance from the center is r = R - h = R - R/4 = (3/4) R. Then, M_enclosed is ( (r/R)³ ) * M_earth. So, M_enclosed = ( (3/4)^3 ) M_earth.

Then, g = G * M_enclosed / r² = G * ( (27/64) M_earth ) / ( (3/4 R)^2 ). Let's compute that.

Compute denominator: (3/4 R)^2 = (9/16) R².

So, g = G * (27/64 M_earth) / (9/16 R²) = G * (27/64) * (16/9) * (M_earth / R²) ) = G * ( (27 * 16) / (64 * 9) ) * (M_earth / R² )

Simplify numerator: 27 *16 = 432; denominator: 64*9=576. So 432/576 = 3/4.

So, g = (3/4) * (G M_earth / R² ) = 3/4 g0.

So, at depth R/4 (so r = 3R/4), the gravity is 3/4 * 9.81 ≈ 7.3575 m/s². So force on 1 kg is 7.3575 N.

Wait, that's different from my initial approach. So I must have mixed up whether the depth is measured from the center or the surface. Now I think the depth is from the surface. So when the depth is h, the actual r is R - h. So for h = R/4, r = 3R/4.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought that the distance from the center is r = h, that gave me lower values, but when considering that the depth is from the surface, and so r = R - h, the gravity at that point is higher than I first thought.

So in the problem statement, it's said that the force is due to the matter below the hole. So, the mass inside the sphere of radius r (where r is the current depth from the center) is what contributes. So, if the depth is h from the surface, then r = R - h. So, let's recast the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it again more carefully.

The Earth is a sphere, radius R. A hole is dug to a depth h, which is the distance from the surface to the point inside the Earth. So, the mass is at a distance r = R - h from the center.

The gravitational force on mass m at that point is F = m * g, where g is the gravitational acceleration at that point.

Using Gauss's Law for gravity: the gravitational field inside a spherical shell cancels out, so only the mass inside radius r contributes.

So, the mass inside radius r is M(r) = (4/3) π r³ ρ, where ρ is the constant density.

The total mass of Earth is M = (4/3) π R³ ρ.

So, M(r) = (r³ / R³) * M.

The gravitational acceleration at radius r is g = G M(r) / r² = G (r³ M) / (R³ r² ) ) = G M r / R³.

But since G M / R² is the surface gravity, g0 = G M / R².

So, g(r) = (g0) * (r / R )

Wait, wait, but if r is the distance from the center, then yes, g = g0 * (r/R). So if r is R - h, then g = g0 * ( (R - h)/R ) = g0 (1 - h/R )

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation when h = R/4 gave r = 3R/4, so g would be 3/4 g0, which is about 7.35 N. But if h is 1/4 R, then (1 - 1/4) = 3/4, so g = 7.35 N.

Similarly, for h = R/2, r = R - R/2 = R/2. So g = g0 * ( (R/2)/R ) = g0 * 1/2, which is 4.905 N.

Wait, that would be the case if the formula is g = g0 * (r/R). But earlier when I used the approach with M(r) = (r/R)^3 M, I ended up with g = g0 * (r/R). But in the problem, the mass is at depth h, so r = R - h. So for h = R/4, r = 3R/4, so g = (3/4) g0 ≈ 7.35 N. For h = R/2, r = R/2, so g = (1/2) g0 ≈ 4.905 N.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option D: 7.35 N, 4.9 N.

Hmm, that's matching. So the first value is 7.35 N, and the second is 4.90 N. Looking at option D: "D: 7.35 Newton's, 4.9 Newton's".

Wait, but wait, the initial approach where I thought h = r gave lower values, but that was incorrect because the depth is from the surface, not from the center. So the correct approach is that when you're at depth h from the surface, your distance from the center is R - h, so the gravitational acceleration is g0 * ( (R - h)/R ), which is g0 * (1 - h/R).

Wait, no, because from the earlier derivation, g(r) = g0 * (r/R), and r = R - h. So, g = g0 * ( (R - h) / R ) = g0 (1 - h/R).

Wait, but earlier when I calculated with r = 3R/4, I got g = (3/4) g0, which is 7.35 N. So for h = R/4, that's correct. And for h = R/2, it's g = (1/2) g0 = 4.905 N.

So the force on 1 kg would be 7.35 N and 4.905 N, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Looking at the options:

A: 5.95, 3.7
B: 6.25, 3.9
C: 6.75, 4.2
D:7.35, 4.9
E:8,5.8
F:7.85,5.1
G:8.45,5.5
H:6.00,4.00
I:9.81,6.45
J:5.65,3.35

So, option D is 7.35 and 4.9, which is what I got. So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we use the gravitational acceleration inside a uniformly dense sphere, derived from Gauss's Law. The gravitational acceleration at a distance \( r \) from the center of the Earth is given by:

\[
g(r) = g_0 \cdot \frac{r}{R}
\]

where \( g_0 = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the surface gravitational acceleration, and \( R \) is the Earth's radius. The depth \( h \) from the surface corresponds to a distance \( r = R - h \) from the center. Substituting \( r = R - h \) into the formula, the gravitational acceleration becomes:

\[
g(h) = g_0 \cdot \frac{R - h}{R} = g_0 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{h}{R}\right)
\]

The force on a 1 kg mass is then \( F = m \cdot g(h) \).

1. **At a depth of \( h = \frac{R}{4} \):**
   \[
   r = R - \frac{R}{4} = \frac{3R}{4}
   \]
   \[
   g\left(\frac{R}{4}\right) = g_0 \cdot \frac{3R/4}{R} = \frac{3}{4} g_0
   \]
   \[
   F = 1 \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot 9.81 = 7.3575 \, \text{N} \approx 7.35 \, \text{N}
   \]

2. **At a depth of \( h = \frac{R}{2} \):**
   \[
   r = R - \frac{R}{2} = \frac{R}{2}
   \]
   \[
   g\left(\frac{R}{2}\right) = g_0 \cdot \frac{R/2}{R} = \frac{1}{2} g_0
   \]
   \[
   F = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.81 = 4.905 \, \text{N} \approx 4.9 \, \text{N}
   \]

Comparing these results with the options, the correct answer is:

**D: 7.35 Newton's, 4.9 Newton's**

The gravitational force on 1 kg at a depth of \( \frac{1}{4}R \) is approximately \( 7.35 \, \text{N} \), and at a depth of \( \frac{1}{2}R \), it is approximately \( 4.9 \, \text{N} \).
