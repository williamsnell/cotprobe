Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the freezing point of a solution. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my colligative properties, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states: The freezing point constant (Kf) of toluene is 3.33°C per mole per 1000 g. We need to find the freezing point when 0.4 moles of solute are dissolved in 500 grams of toluene. The freezing point of pure toluene is -95.0°C. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the right one.

Alright, I remember that the formula for freezing point depression is ΔT = Kf * m, where m is the molality of the solution. Then, the freezing point of the solution (Tf) is the freezing point of the pure solvent minus ΔT. So, Tf = Tfpure - ΔT.

Wait, no, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because when you add solute, the freezing point decreases. So, the formula should be Tf = Tfpure - (Kf * m). Or is it Kf multiplied by the molality? Wait, yes, that's right. So, first, I need to calculate the molality (m) of the solution.

Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Here, the solute is 0.4 moles, and the solvent is 500 grams. Oh, wait, 500 grams is 0.5 kg. So, m = moles / kg = 0.4 / 0.5. Let me calculate that: 0.4 divided by 0.5 is 0.8. So, the molality is 0.8 m.

Now, using the formula ΔT = Kf * m. Kf is 3.33°C/molal. So, ΔT = 3.33 * 0.8. Let me compute that: 3.33 * 0.8. Hmm, 3 times 0.8 is 2.4, and 0.33*0.8 is about 0.264. So, total is 2.664°C. So, the freezing point depression is 2.664°C.

Now, the freezing point of the solution is the pure solvent's freezing point minus this depression. So, Tf = -95.0 - 2.664. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, I'm getting confused. Because when you add a solute, the freezing point decreases. So, the solution's freezing point is lower than the pure solvent's. So, if pure toluene freezes at -95°C, the solution will freeze at a lower temperature, meaning a more negative value.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is Tf = Tfpure - ΔT. So, because ΔT is positive (since Kf is positive and m is positive), subtracting it will make Tf lower than Tfpure. So, yes, correct.

So, Tf = (-95.0) - 2.664. Let me compute that: 95 + 2.664 is 97.664, so the freezing point is -97.664°C. Wait, but looking at the options, I see E is -97.66°C. So that's a match.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check my calculations. Because when I calculated ΔT as 3.33 * 0.8, I got 2.664, right? So, the freezing point would be -95.0 - 2.664. Wait, that's -97.664, which rounds to -97.66°C. So option E is -97.66°C, which would be the answer.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because I think sometimes the formula is presented as Tf = Tfpure + (ΔT). No, that can't be right. Because the freezing point should be lower, so it's Tfpure minus ΔT.

Wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong. Let me make sure. The freezing point depression formula is ΔT = Kf * m, and the solution's freezing point is lower than the pure solvent, so Tf = Tfpure - ΔT.

Yes, correct. So, Tfpure is -95.0. So, Tf = -95.0 - 2.664 = -97.664°C. So the answer should be E: -97.66°C.

But let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: -92.34
B: -89.66
C: -88.0
D: -90.0
E: -97.66
F: -100.0
G: -93.0
H: -98.34
I: -94.0
J: -96.0

So E is -97.66, which matches my calculation. But wait, let me check if I've got the molality right. The problem says 0.4 moles in 500 grams of toluene. So 500 grams is 0.5 kg. So, molality m = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8 m. Correct.

Then, Kf is 3.33, so 3.33 * 0.8 = 2.664. So, the freezing point is -95.0 - 2.664 = -97.664, which is approximately -97.66°C. So E is the correct option.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes, I've seen the formula presented as a decrease, so the solution's freezing point is lower. So, yes, E is the correct answer.

The freezing point depression formula is used to calculate the freezing point of the solution:  
\[
\Delta T = K_f \times m
\]  
where \( K_f \) is the freezing point constant (3.33°C/molal), and \( m \) is the molality of the solution.  

The molality \( m \) is calculated as:  
\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}} = \frac{0.4 \, \text{moles}}{0.5 \, \text{kg}} = 0.8 \, \text{molal}.
\]  

Substituting into the formula:  
\[
\Delta T = 3.33 \times 0.8 = 2.664 \, \text{°C}.
\]  

The freezing point of the solution is then:  
\[
T_f = T_{\text{fpure}} - \Delta T = -95.0 \, \text{°C} - 2.664 \, \text{°C} = -97.664 \, \text{°C}.
\]  

Rounding to two decimal places, the freezing point is approximately \(-97.66 \, \text{°C}\), which corresponds to option E.
