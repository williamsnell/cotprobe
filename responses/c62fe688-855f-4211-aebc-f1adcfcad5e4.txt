Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Dash Co. should report as a liability in their June 30 balance sheet based on the utility bills provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the information given. The utility bills have periods covered and the amounts paid on specific dates. Let me list them out:

- April 16 to May 15: $5,000 paid on June 1
- May 16 to June 15: $6,000 paid on June 1
- June 16 to July 15: $8,000 paid on August 1

Wait, actually, the dates might be a bit confusing. Let me parse each line correctly.

Looking at the first line: "April 16 ‚Äì May 15 $5000 June 1". So the period is April 16 to May 15, and the amount is $5,000. It was paid on June 1. So that's the first bill.

The second line: "June 1 May 16 ‚Äì June 15 $6000 July 1". Hmm, this seems a bit mixed up. Wait, perhaps it's May 16 to June 15, amount $6,000, paid on July 1. So the payment date for this bill is July 1.

The third line: "June 16 ‚Äì July 15 $8000 August 1". So the period is June 16 to July 15, amount $8,000, paid on August 1.

Wait, but the way it's written is a bit unclear. Let me try to structure it:

- Period: April 16 - May 15, Amount: $5,000, Date Paid: June 1
- Period: May 16 - June 15, Amount: $6,000, Date Paid: July 1
- Period: June 16 - July 15, Amount: $8,000, Date Paid: August 1

But wait, the way the dates are written might not be correct. Let me check the original question again.

The original question lists the periods as:

April 16 – May 15 $5000 June 1
May 16 – June 15 $6000 July 1
June 16 – July 15 $8000 August 1

So each line is: Period Covered, Amount, Date Paid.

So the first bill covers April 16 to May 15, cost $5,000, paid on June 1.

The second bill covers May 16 to June 15, cost $6,000, paid on July 1.

The third bill covers June 16 to July 15, cost $8,000, paid on August 1.

Now, the question is about the liability Dash Co. should report as of June 30.

Liabilities are amounts the company owes as of the balance sheet date. So we need to find out which utility bills are unpaid as of June 30.

Let's see the payment dates:

- First bill: paid on June 1. So that's before June 30, so no liability for that as it's already paid.
- Second bill: paid on July 1. So as of June 30, this bill is unpaid. So Dash Co. owes $6,000 as of June 30.
- Third bill: paid on August 1. So as of June 30, this bill is also unpaid. So they owe $8,000.

Wait, but wait! The third bill's period is June 16 to July 15. So the payment date is August 1. So up to June 30, the company hasn't paid for the June 16 to July 15 period. So that's another $8,000 owed.

So total unpaid bills as of June 30 are $6,000 (May 16-June 15) and $8,000 (June 16-July 15). That adds up to $14,000.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check. The balance sheet is as of June 30. So any bills that have been incurred by that date but not yet paid are considered current liabilities.

The first bill, April 16-May 15, paid on June 1, so that's already paid. No liability.

Second bill: May 16-June 15, $6,000, paid on July 1. So as of June 30, this is still unpaid. So it's a liability.

Third bill: June 16-July 15, $8,000, paid on August 1. So as of June 30, this is also unpaid. So that's another liability.

Wait, but wait again. The June 16-July 15 bill is for a period that starts after June 30. So is that bill even applicable yet?

Wait no, the period is June 16 to July 15, which includes parts of June (from June 16 to June 30) and all of July. So the utility usage for June 16 to June 30 is part of that period, which would be a liability as of June 30 because the bill hasn't been paid yet (paid on August 1).

So the company would owe both the May 16-June 15 and June 16-July 15 bills as of June 30, because they haven't been paid yet.

So $6,000 + $8,000 = $14,000.

But looking at the options, E is $14,000. But wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $8,000
B: $5,000
C: $9,000
D: $13,000
E: $14,000
F: $15,000
G: $10,000
H: $12,000
I: $7,000
J: $6,000

So E is $14,000.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in accounting, the liability is for the services already received but not yet paid. So each utility bill represents services from a certain period, and the payment is made later.

So on June 30, the company has used utilities from May 16-June 15 (bill paid on July 1) and June 16-June 30 (part of the June 16-July 15 bill, which is paid on August 1). So both of those are unpaid as of June 30, so both are liabilities.

So total liability is $6k + $8k = $14k, which is option E.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the June 16-July 15 bill is considered as of June 30. Let me think again.

As of June 30, the company has used utilities from June 16 to June 30, which is part of the June 16-July 15 period. So that's a liability because the bill is not yet paid (paid on August 1). So yes, that's $8k added.

So total is $6k + $8k = $14k, so E is the answer.
</think>

The amount Dash Co. should report as a liability in its June 30 balance sheet is the sum of unpaid utility bills for the periods May 16–June 15 ($6,000) and June 16–July 15 ($8,000), totaling $14,000.

Answer: E
