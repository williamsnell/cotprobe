Okay, so I have this psychology question here about ethical responsibilities when a psychologist is seeing a 10-year-old child in a school setting. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when it comes to minors in therapy, there are specific ethical guidelines about consent. I think it's about both the parent's consent and the child's assent. Assent means the child agrees to participate, even if they can't legally consent on their own.

So the question is asking which option correctly describes the best way to meet the ethical responsibility. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Parent(s) provide written consent and the psychologist obtains the child's assent non-verbally. Hmm, non-verbally might be tricky. I think assent is usually verbal or written, but maybe in some cases non-verbal could work, but I'm not sure if this is the best approach.

Option B: Both parent and child provide written consent. Wait, can a child provide written consent? I think the parent usually gives consent, and the child gives assent. So maybe this isn't right because the child might not have the legal capacity to consent.

Option C: Child provides written and verbal consent. That seems off because, again, the child might not have the legal authority to consent alone. They need the parent's consent plus their own assent.

Option D: Parent provides written consent and child verbally assents. This sounds plausible. The parent's written consent covers the legal part, and the child's verbal agreement shows they're willing to participate.

Option E: Written consent from school and parent. I'm not sure. The school might have policies, but the main point is the parent's consent and the child's assent. Maybe the school's consent isn't the primary here.

Option F: School provides written consent and child verbally assents. Similar to E, but I think it's the parent who gives consent, not the school. Unless the school is the one referring, but the primary is the parent.

Option G: Parent provides written and verbal consent. Wait, the parent only needs to provide written consent. Verbal might be redundant unless it's required in some cases, but I think written is standard.

Option H: Parent provides verbal consent and child written. That seems mixed up. Parent should probably give written, and child gives verbal or non-verbal assent.

Option I: Child provides verbal assent. But without the parent's consent, that's not enough. The child's assent is necessary but not sufficient on their own.

Option J: Psychologist obtains verbal consent from school admin. That doesn't address the parent or the child's part, so probably incorrect.

So, putting it together, the correct approach is that the parent provides written consent, and the child gives verbal assent. That's option D.

The correct approach is that the parent provides written consent, and the child gives verbal assent. 

Answer: D
