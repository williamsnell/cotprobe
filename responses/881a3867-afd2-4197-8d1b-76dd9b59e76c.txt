Question:

A tank is in the shape of a triangular prism. If the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet, and the tank is 30 feet tall, how much water would the tank contain when it is full?

Options:

A: 2320 ft^3
B: 8700 ft^3
C: 2900 ft^3
D: 1725 ft^3
E: 5000 ft^3
F: 3480 ft^3
G: 1740 ft^3
H: 6960 ft^3
I: 4640 ft^3
J: 4000 ft^3

Okay, so I've got this problem about a tank shaped like a triangular prism. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, I remember that the volume of a prism is calculated by finding the area of the base and then multiplying it by the height (or length) of the prism. The formula is Volume = Base Area × Height. 

The problem says the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet. That's the base area. Then, the tank is 30 feet tall. I think the "tall" part refers to the height or the length of the prism, so that's 30 feet. 

So, plugging the numbers into the formula: Volume = 116 sq ft × 30 ft. Let me do the multiplication. 

116 multiplied by 30. Hmm, 100×30 is 3000, and 16×30 is 480. Adding those together, 3000 + 480 equals 3480. So the volume should be 3480 cubic feet. 

Looking at the options, F is 3480 ft³. That must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me double-check. The base area is 116, height is 30. 116×30=3480. Yep, that's right.

The volume of a triangular prism is calculated by multiplying the area of the triangular base by the height (or length) of the prism. Given the base area is 116 square feet and the height is 30 feet, the volume is 116 × 30 = 3480 cubic feet.

Answer: F
