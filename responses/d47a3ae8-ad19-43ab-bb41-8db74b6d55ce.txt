Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about finding the mass of carbon monoxide in a 35.0 ml puff of cigarette smoke at standard temperature and pressure (STP). They've given a table with mole fractions for various components, and I need to pick the correct answer from options A to J.

First, I'll list what I know. The components given are H2O, O2, CO, and CO2, each with their mole fractions. The mole fraction of CO is 0.036. So, in the smoke, 3.6% of the molecules are CO by moles.

The problem is asking about the mass of CO in 35.0 mL of smoke at STP. I remember that at STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, maybe I can find the number of moles of CO in that volume and then convert it to mass.

Wait, but the volume given is 35.0 mL, which is 0.035 liters. So, first, I need to find the total number of moles of gas in this volume. Since it's a mixture, the mole fractions add up to 1. Let me check the mole fractions: H2O is 0.016, O2 is 0.12, CO is 0.036, CO2 is 0.079. Adding these up: 0.016 + 0.12 = 0.136, plus 0.036 is 0.172, plus 0.079 is 0.251. Wait, that's only 0.251, which is less than 1. So, there are other components making up the rest of the mole fraction. Oh, right, because the table lists some of the more abundant compounds, not all. So the total mole fraction of these four is 0.251, meaning the rest (1 - 0.251 = 0.749) is from other compounds. But for this problem, only CO is relevant because the question is about CO mass.

So, the total moles in the 35 mL is based on the total volume. At STP, 22.4 L is 1 mole, so 0.035 L would be 0.035 / 22.4 moles of gas in total.

Let me calculate that: 0.035 divided by 22.4. Let me compute that. 0.035 / 22.4 = approximately 0.0015625 moles of total gas.

Now, since CO has a mole fraction of 0.036, the moles of CO would be 0.036 multiplied by the total moles.

So, moles of CO = 0.036 * 0.0015625. Let me calculate that: 0.036 * 0.0015625. Hmm, 0.036 * 0.0015625. Let's see, 0.036 * 0.001 is 0.000036, and 0.036 * 0.0005625 is 0.00002025. Adding them gives 0.00005625. Wait, no, maybe it's easier to multiply 0.036 * 0.0015625 directly. 0.036 * 1.5625e-3. Let me compute 0.036 * 0.0015625.

Alternatively, 0.036 is 3.6e-2, and 0.0015625 is 1.5625e-3. Multiplying them gives (3.6 * 1.5625) e-5. Let's compute 3.6 * 1.5625: 3 * 1.5625 is 4.6875, 0.6 * 1.5625 is 0.9375. So total is 4.6875 + 0.9375 = 5.625. So 5.625e-5 moles of CO.

Wait, that's 5.625 x 10^-5 moles of CO.

Now, the molar mass of CO is needed to find the mass. CO is carbon (12.01 g/mol) plus oxygen (16.00 g/mol), totaling 28.01 g/mol.

So mass = moles * molar mass = 5.625e-5 mol * 28.01 g/mol.

Let me compute this. 5.625e-5 * 28.01. Let's approximate 28 for simplicity first. 5.625e-5 * 28 = (5.625 * 28) * 1e-5.

5 *28 is 140, 0.625*28=17.5, so total 157.5. So 157.5e-5 g = 0.001575 g. But wait, that's 1.575e-3 g. Looking at the options, E is 3.2e-3, F is 4.8e-3, I is 2.4e-3, etc. Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me double-check. Let's recalculate the moles of CO.

Total moles in 35 mL is 0.035 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.0015625 mol.

Mole fraction of CO is 0.036, so moles of CO = 0.036 * 0.0015625 = 0.00005625 mol.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So 0.00005625 mol CO.

Molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol, so mass = 0.00005625 * 28.01.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.00005625 * 28.01:

First, 5.625e-5 * 28.01.

Let me write 5.625e-5 as 56.25e-6.

56.25e-6 * 28.01 = (56.25 * 28.01) * 1e-6.

Compute 56.25 * 28.01.

Well, 56 * 28 = 1568; 56 * 0.01 = 0.56; 0.25 *28=7; 0.25 *0.01=0.0025.

So, 56.25 *28.01 = (56 *28) + (56 *0.01) + (0.25 *28) + (0.25 *0.01) 

Which is 1568 + 0.56 +7 +0.0025 = 1575 + 0.56 +0.0025 = 1575.5625.

So, 56.25e-6 *28.01 = 1575.5625e-6 g = 1.5755625e-3 g, which is approximately 1.576e-3 grams.

Looking at the options, E is 3.2e-3, which is double that. Hmm, wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check the steps again.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.035 L is 35 mL. At STP, 22.4 L is 1 mole, so 35 mL is 0.035 L, so moles = 0.035 /22.4 = 0.0015625 mol total.

Mole fraction of CO is 0.036, so moles of CO = 0.036 * 0.0015625 = 0.00005625 mol.

Mass is 0.00005625 *28.01 = let's compute accurately:

0.00005625 *28.01 = 

Let me compute 56.25e-6 *28.01 = 

56.25 *28.01 = 56 *28 = 1568, 56 *0.01=0.56, 0.25*28=7, 0.25*0.01=0.0025. So sum is 1568 +0.56=1568.56; +7=1575.56; +0.0025=1575.5625.

So 1575.5625e-6 grams = 0.0015755625 grams, which is approximately 0.001576 grams or 1.576e-3 grams.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option E:3.2e-3 which is 0.0032g, but that's about twice as much as I calculated. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole fraction. The table lists the mole fractions, but are they the mole fractions of the entire smoke or just the listed components? Because in the problem statement, it says "of the many compounds present," so the listed components have the given mole fractions, but the rest are other compounds. Wait, but the sum of the mole fractions of the listed components was 0.251, so the rest is 0.749. So the mole fraction of CO is 0.036, which is part of the 0.251. So when I calculate the moles of CO based on the total moles, I should use the mole fraction correctly.

Wait, no, because the mole fractions add up to the entire mixture. So the mole fraction of CO is 0.036 of the entire gas mixture. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recalculate the total moles.

35 mL = 0.035 L.

At STP, 1 mole =22.4 L, so moles = 0.035 /22.4.

Let me compute 0.035 divided by 22.4.

22.4 L/mol is 22400 mL/mol. So 35 mL is 35 /22400 = 0.0015625 mol. That's correct.

So moles of CO is 0.036 *0.0015625 = 0.00005625 mol.

Molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol.

So 0.00005625 *28.01 = 0.001575 grams, which is 1.575e-3 grams. Looking at the options, the closest is option I (2.4e-3), but wait, that's not matching. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:0.8e-3

B:1.6e-3

C:2.0e-3

D:5.6e-3

E:3.2e-3

F:4.8e-3

G:6.4e-3

H:7.2e-3

I:2.4e-3

J:1.0e-3

So my calculation gives 1.575e-3 g, which is approximately 1.58e-3. The closest option is B:1.6e-3 or J:1.0e-3. Let me see, 1.575 is closer to 1.6 than to 1.0. So the answer should be B:1.6e-3.

Wait, but option B is 1.6 × 10^-3 g, which is 0.0016 g, which is very close to my calculated 0.001575 g. So option B is the correct answer.

To determine the mass of carbon monoxide (CO) in a 35.0 mL puff of cigarette smoke at standard temperature and pressure (STP), we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert Volume to Moles**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of total gas} = \frac{0.035 \, \text{L}}{22.4 \, \text{L/mol}} = 0.0015625 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of CO**:  
   The mole fraction of CO is 0.036.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO} = 0.036 \times 0.0015625 = 0.00005625 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Mass of CO**:  
   The molar mass of CO is \(28.01 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Mass of CO} = 0.00005625 \, \text{mol} \times 28.01 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.001575 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated mass of CO is approximately \(1.575 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g}\), which is closest to option **B: \(1.6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g}\)**.
