Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this legal question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A retiree and his wife are accosted by a man with a gun outside their apartment. The man forces them into their apartment, ties them up with duct tape, and steals the retiree's wallet and jewelry. After the man leaves, the retiree has a heart attack and dies.

I need to determine what charges the man should face. The options are various combinations of burglary, robbery, involuntary manslaughter, murder, etc.

Let me start by recalling the definitions of these crimes:

- **Burglary**: Typically defined as unlawfully entering a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. In some jurisdictions, it can also include the act of breaking in and then committing a felony.

- **Robbery**: The crime of taking property from a person or in their presence, using force or fear. So, if the man takes the wallet and jewelry while holding them up, that's robbery.

- **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This occurs when someone dies due to the defendant's unlawful act, but without intent to kill. It's often a misdemeanor manslaughter, where the death results from an unlawful act that isn't inherently deadly, like battery or assault.

- **Murder**: Involves intentional killing, which isn't the case here since the retiree's death was due to a heart attack, not the man's intent.

So, applying these definitions:

1. **Burglary**: The man entered the apartment with a gun, which likely constitutes burglary because he unlawfully entered a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony (theft). Even if he didn't break in, in many places, entering with force or fear counts as burglary.

2. **Robbery**: He took the wallet and jewelry while in their presence, using a gun to force them. That's robbery because it's taking property through fear or force.

3. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: The man tied them up, which could be considered an assault. The stress of being tied up and the struggle led to the retiree's heart attack and death. Since the man didn't intend to kill, this fits involuntary manslaughter.

4. **Murder**: Not applicable because there was no intent to kill. The death was a result of the retiree's medical condition, not the man's actions directly causing death.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Burglary and involuntary manslaughter. But he also committed robbery.

B: Robbery and burglary. That covers two of the three, but misses involuntary manslaughter.

E: Robbery, burglary, and involuntary manslaughter. That seems to cover all three.

Wait, but let me think again. Burglary is entering with intent to commit a felony, which he did. Robbery is the taking of property with force, which he did. Involuntary manslaughter is the result of his actions causing the death. So E includes all three.

But wait, some jurisdictions might consider whether the robbery and burglary are separate or if burglary is part of the robbery. But typically, burglary is the unlawful entry, and robbery is the taking of property, so both can stand as separate charges.

So the correct answer should include all three: burglary, robbery, and involuntary manslaughter, which is option E.

The man committed burglary by entering the apartment with intent to commit theft, robbery by taking property with force, and involuntary manslaughter as his actions caused the retiree's death. 

Answer: E
