Question:

Rune Co.'s checkbook balance on December 31 was $10000. On that date Rune held the following items in its safe: $4000 check payable to Rune postdated January 3 and not included in the December 31 checkbook balance in collection of a sale made in December. $1000 check payable to Rune deposited December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance but returned by the bank on December 30 stamped "NSF". The check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9. What amount should Rune report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet?

Options:

A: $10,000
B: $12,000
C: $8,000
D: $16,000
E: $15,000
F: $9,000
G: $7,000
H: $13,000
I: 14000
J: $11,000

Okay, so I have this accounting problem here about Rune Co.'s cash balance on December 31. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it slow.

First, the question says that the checkbook balance on December 31 is $10,000. That's the starting point. Now, I need to look at the items in the safe and adjust the balance accordingly.

There are two items mentioned in the safe. Let's break them down one by one.

The first item is a $4,000 check payable to Rune, but it's postdated January 3. So that means it's not valid until January 3rd. Since it's postdated and December 31st is before that, this check hasn't been cashed yet. The problem also states that this check wasn't included in the December 31 checkbook balance because it's for the collection of a sale made in December. So, that means Rune hasn't recorded this money yet, but they have the check. Since it's postdated, I think this should be considered as "uncollected" cash. Therefore, Rune shouldn't count this towards their cash balance on the balance sheet because it's not yet available. So, I might need to subtract this from the checkbook balance or just not include it.

The second item is a $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15. It's included in the December 31 checkbook balance, but the bank returned it on December 30 marked as "NSF." So, the bank didn't honor it. Then, Rune redeposited it on January 2 and it cleared on January 9. 

Hmm, so what does this mean? When the check was first deposited on Dec 15, it was included in the checkbook balance, meaning Rune thought they had that $1,000. But the bank returned it as NSF, which stands for "Not Sufficient Funds." So, at the end of December 31, that $1,000 should not be considered as cash because the bank didn't clear it. But wait, the check was redeposited and cleared in January. So, does that mean that the $1,000 is actually a valid cash item now?

Wait, but the checkbook balance on December 31 was $10,000, which includes the $1,000 from that check. But since the check was returned, that $1,000 might not have been available on December 31. So, in the checkbook balance, they might have overrecorded the cash by $1,000 because the check was NSF. So, I think the correct cash balance would be the checkbook balance minus the NSF check plus any other adjustments.

Wait, let me clarify. The checkbook balance includes the $1,000 because it was deposited and they recorded it. But the bank returned it, so that $1,000 wasn't actually in the bank account as of December 31. So, Rune's actual cash in the bank would be the checkbook balance minus the NSF amount. So, $10,000 minus $1,000 equals $9,000. But then, there's the $4,000 check that's postdated. Since that can't be cashed yet, does that affect the cash balance?

Wait, no. The $4,000 check is in the safe, but it's not in the bank yet, and it's postdated. So, in terms of cash on the balance sheet, the cash would be the actual cash in the bank plus any checks that have been deposited but not yet cleared. Wait, no. Because the checkbook balance already includes the $1,000 that was NSF. So, perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the checkbook balance for any outstanding checks or uncollected items.

Wait, the checkbook balance is $10,000, but that includes the $1,000 NSF check, which isn't actually available. So, the real cash in the bank would be $10,000 minus $1,000, which is $9,000. But then, what about the $4,000 check in the safe? Since it's a postdated check, it's not in the bank yet, so it's not part of the bank balance. But Rune has this check in their safe. Does that count as cash on the balance sheet?

I think cash on the balance sheet includes cash on hand and cash in the bank. The $4,000 check is cash in the safe, so it should be added to the cash balance. But wait, the checkbook balance is only $10,000, which doesn't include the $4,000 because it's not deposited yet. So, the total cash would be the cash in the bank plus the cash in the safe.

But wait, the cash in the bank is the checkbook balance minus any outstanding deductions. So, the bank balance is $10,000, but the $1,000 NSF check is not a deduction because it's not cleared. So, the bank's actual cash is $10,000 minus $1,000 (NSF) because that check wasn't valid. So, bank cash is $9,000. Then, the $4,000 check in the safe is also cash because it's a check payable to Rune, so that's $4,000 in cash. Therefore, total cash would be $9,000 (bank) + $4,000 (safe) = $13,000.

Wait, but the options don't have $13,000 as an option. Let me check the options again. Oh, option H is $13,000. Hmm, but wait, I might be making a mistake here. Because the $4,000 check is postdated, does that mean it's not yet available? So, should it be considered as cash or not?

Wait, the check is in the safe, and it's a check that's payable to Rune. So, in accounting, if you have a check that's payable to you, it's considered cash because it's a form of cash. So, even though it's postdated, it's a valid check that can be cashed after January 3. So, it's part of the company's cash on hand. Therefore, it should be included in the cash balance.

So, to sum up: 

- Bank balance as per checkbook: $10,000
- Minus the NSF check: $1,000
- So, bank cash is $9,000
- Plus the $4,000 check in the safe
- Total cash: $9,000 + $4,000 = $13,000

Looking at the options, H is $13,000. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes the adjustments can be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the $4,000 isn't included because it's a postdated check and isn't considered available until January. But I think in terms of cash on hand, it is considered cash because it's a check that can be cashed, just not until January. So, it's part of the company's cash.

Another way: Cash in the bank is $10,000, but since the $1,000 is NSF, the actual cash in the bank is $9,000. Then, the $4,000 in the safe is cash, so total cash is $13,000.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be H: $13,000.
</think>

The correct answer is H: $13,000.

To determine the cash balance as of December 31, we start with the checkbook balance of $10,000. We must adjust for two items:

1. **The $1,000 NSF check**: Since this check was returned by the bank as NSF, it should be subtracted from the checkbook balance, leaving $9,000 in the bank.

2. **The $4,000 postdated check**: This check is held in the safe and is considered cash because it is payable to Rune and can be cashed after January 3. Therefore, it is added to the cash balance.

Adding these together: $9,000 (bank balance) + $4,000 (safe) = $13,000.
