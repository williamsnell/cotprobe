Question:

For a class project, a student wants to see if boys and girls at their large high school differ in the number of contacts they have stored in their phone. The student conducts a survey of 50 randomly sampled boys and 40 randomly selected girls, and asks them to report the number of contacts. Which of the following is true about this situation?

Options:

A: Because the sample sizes are both less than 50, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.
B: Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, the student shoulduse a two-sample t-test.
C: Because the student is testing for a difference in means, they should use a paired t-test.
D: Because the student is comparing two groups, they should use a Mann-Whitney U test.
E: Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.
F: Because the sample sizes are different, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.
G: Because the student is comparing two groups, they should use an ANOVA test.
H: Because the student is comparing two groups, they should use a one-sample t-test.
I: Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should use a Chi-square test.
J: Because the shape of the population distribution is not known, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.

Okay, so I have this statistics question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a student who wants to see if boys and girls at their large high school differ in the number of contacts they have on their phones. They surveyed 50 boys and 40 girls. The options are about which statistical test they should use.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying and determine which one is correct.

The main goal here is to compare the number of contacts between two groups: boys and girls. So, this is a comparison of two independent groups, not paired data. That already helps because some options talk about paired tests or other methods.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says because the sample sizes are less than 50, they shouldn't use a two-sample t-test. But wait, sample size for each group is 50 and 40. 50 is not less than 50; it's equal. So this option might not be correct.

Option B: States that since the population standard deviations are unknown and conditions are met, a two-sample t-test should be used. I remember that when the population standard deviations are unknown, the t-test is appropriate, especially if the data is normally distributed or the sample sizes are large enough. Here, the sample sizes are 50 and 40, which are moderately large, so using a t-test is reasonable. This seems correct, but let me check other options.

Option C: Suggests a paired t-test. But paired tests are for when each data point in one group is paired with a data point in the other group, like before and after measurements. Here, it's two independent groups (boys vs. girls), so paired test isn't suitable. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Recommends a Mann-Whitney U test. That's a non-parametric test used when the data isn't normally distributed or when the assumptions for the t-test aren't met. If the data is normally distributed, a t-test is preferred. Since the question doesn't mention anything about the distribution shape, I'm not sure yet, but let's keep this in mind.

Option E: Says because sample sizes are greater than 30, they shouldn't use a two-sample t-test. Wait, actually, the Central Limit Theorem says that with sample sizes over 30, the sampling distribution will be approximately normal, making the t-test valid. So E is incorrect because using a t-test is appropriate here.

Option F: Claims that different sample sizes mean not using a two-sample t-test. But a two-sample t-test can handle different sample sizes. So F is wrong.

Option G: Suggests using ANOVA. ANOVA is for comparing more than two groups. Here, it's just two groups, so ANOVA isn't necessary. G is incorrect.

Option H: Recommends a one-sample t-test. That's for comparing a single group's mean to a known value, not for comparing two groups. So H is wrong.

Option I: Suggests a Chi-square test. Chi-square is for categorical data, not numerical. The number of contacts is a numerical variable, so Chi-square isn't appropriate. I is incorrect.

Option J: Says because the population distribution shape isn't known, they shouldn't use a two-sample t-test. Well, the t-test assumes normality, but with sample sizes over 30, the Central Limit Theorem makes the t-test robust to non-normality. So J might be incorrect because the t-test is still usable, especially with larger samples.

So, going back, the correct approach is probably a two-sample t-test. Let me check the conditions again. The samples are independent (randomly sampled boys and girls), and the sample sizes are 50 and 40. Since both are over 30, the Central Limit Theorem applies, making the t-test valid. Also, the population standard deviations are unknown, which is typical, so a t-test is suitable.

Therefore, option B seems correct because it correctly states that the conditions are met for a two-sample t-test. Option J is incorrect because the sample sizes being over 30 make the t-test still applicable even without knowing the distribution shape.

The correct answer is that the student should use a two-sample t-test because the conditions are met with sample sizes over 30 and unknown population standard deviations.
