Okay, so I've got this question about DNA, mRNA, and tRNA sequences. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says the DNA sequence is 5′-C-A-T-3′. Wait, DNA is usually double-stranded, right? So the complementary strand would be 3′-G-T-A-5′ because DNA strands run antiparallel. Oh, but wait, when transcribing mRNA, it's based on the template strand. So I need to figure out which strand is the template here.

The DNA strand given is 5′-C-A-T-3′. Since DNA has two strands, the complementary would be 3′-G-T-A-5′. But during transcription, mRNA is made complementary to the template strand. So the template strand is the one that is complementary to the mRNA. Wait, that part always confuses me. Let me think again.

DNA has two strands: the coding strand and the template strand. The coding strand is the same as mRNA, except T is replaced by U. So if the DNA sequence given is 5′-C-A-T-3′, is that the coding or template strand?

Wait, actually, the DNA strand that is similar to mRNA is the coding strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand. So the DNA given is probably the coding strand, meaning the template strand is the complementary one. So the template DNA strand would be 3′-G-T-A-5′.

Transcribing mRNA from the template strand would produce mRNA that is complementary to the template. So the mRNA would be 5′-C-A-U-3′, right? Because DNA to mRNA is complementary, and mRNA uses U instead of T.

So the mRNA codon would be 5′-C-A-U-3′. Now, tRNA has an anticodon that pairs with the mRNA codon. The anticodon is on the tRNA and is complementary to the mRNA codon. So the mRNA codon is 5′-C-A-U-3′, so the tRNA anticodon should be complementary to that.

Wait, but how does the pairing work? mRNA is read 5' to 3', so the tRNA's anticodon would pair with that. The anticodon runs from 3' to 5' on the tRNA, I think. So the mRNA codon is 5'-C A U-3', so the tRNA anticodon would be 3' end to 5' end. So the tRNA's anticodon would pair as A (from mRNA U?), wait no, wait, let me think again.

Wait, let me clarify. mRNA codon is 5' C A U 3'. The tRNA anticodon is complementary and runs in the opposite direction. So the anticodon would be 3' complementary bases to the mRNA. So mRNA is 5' C A U 3', so the anticodon would be 3' G U A 5'? Wait, no. Because mRNA's C pairs with G, A pairs with U, and U pairs with A in the tRNA.

Wait, maybe I should write it down. Let's see:

mRNA codon: 5' C A U 3'
tRNA anticodon is complementary, so each base pairs with the mRNA. So:

mRNA: C A U
tRNA anticodon: G U A

But the direction matters. The mRNA is read 5' to 3', so the tRNA anticodon is written 5' to 3' as well. Wait, no. Wait, the anticodon is the reverse complement because the mRNA is in one direction and the tRNA's anticodon runs opposite. So the anticodon would be complementary and antiparallel.

Let me think. mRNA codon is 5' C A U 3'. The tRNA anticodon is antiparallel, so it would be 3' G U A 5'. But when we write the sequence, we write it 5' to 3'. So the anticodon sequence would be 5' A U G 3'? No, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, maybe I should reverse the complement. So mRNA is 5' C A U 3'.

The complementary bases would be G, U, A. So the tRNA anticodon is 5' A U G 3'? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, if mRNA is 5' C A U 3', then the complementary tRNA anticodon would be 3' G U A 5'. But when we write the sequence, it's written 5' to 3', so the anticodon would be 5' A U G 3'?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because mRNA's C would pair with tRNA's G. So let me list each position:

mRNA: 5' C A U 3'
tRNA anticodon: 3' G U A 5'

But when written 5' to 3', it's the reverse: A U G. Wait, no, that would be the same as the mRNA but with U to A. No, wait. Let me think about the pairing again.

Each base in mRNA pairs with the tRNA anticodon as follows:
mRNA C pairs with tRNA G,
mRNA A pairs with tRNA U,
mRNA U pairs with tRNA A.

So the anticodon sequence is G U A, but in reverse order because it's antiparallel. So the anticodon would be 5' A U G 3'? No, wait, that would mean the anticodon reads A U G, which would pair with U A C mRNA, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently. The mRNA codon is 5' C A U 3'. The tRNA anticodon must be complementary, so each base pairs. So the anticodon would be 3' G U A 5', but when written in 5' to 3' direction, it's A U G. That can't be right because that would mean the anticodon is A U G, which would pair with the mRNA codon U A C, but our mRNA is C A U.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The mRNA codon is 5' C A U 3'. The tRNA anticodon is complementary and antiparallel. So the anticodon is 3' G U A 5'. So when written in 5' to 3' direction, it's A U G. But that would pair with the mRNA's codon in the opposite direction. Wait, but mRNA is read 5' to 3', so the anticodon is 3' to 5', which would mean that the anticodon is 5' A U G 3' as written. But that would pair as A with U, U with A, G with C. Oh wait, no. Wait, when the mRNA is read 5' to 3', the tRNA's anticodon is read 3' to 5', so the first base of the anticodon (3') pairs with the first base of the mRNA (5').

So the mRNA is 5' C A U 3', so the tRNA anticodon is 3' G U A 5'. So when written as a sequence in the correct direction (5' to 3'), the anticodon is 5' A U G 3'? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, the anticodon is 3' G U A 5', so the sequence is written as 5' A U G 3'? That can't be right because that would imply it's the same as mRNA but with U to A, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try another approach. The mRNA is 5' C A U 3'. The complementary DNA strand (the coding strand) would be 3' G T A 5'. When transcribing, mRNA is made complementary to the template strand, which is the 3' G T A 5' strand. So mRNA becomes 5' C A U 3' as given.

The tRNA anticodon must pair with this mRNA codon. Each base on the mRNA is paired with the tRNA anticodon. So the mRNA C pairs with tRNA G, A pairs with U, and U pairs with A.

So the anticodon would be G U A. But the direction matters. Since the mRNA is 5' to 3', the tRNA anticodon is 3' to 5', so the tRNA would have 3' G U A 5'. But when writing the anticodon, we write it 5' to 3', so it becomes A U G.

Wait, but that would mean the anticodon is 5' A U G 3'. But wait, that would pair with the mRNA's codon as follows: A pairs with U (since mRNA has U in the third position), U pairs with A, and G pairs with C. But our mRNA is C A U, so:

tRNA anticodon 5' A U G 3' would pair with mRNA 3' U A C 5'. But that's the reverse. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the anticodon is the reverse complement of the mRNA codon. So mRNA is 5' C A U 3'. The reverse complement would be 3' G U A 5', which is the anticodon. But when written as a sequence, it's 5' A U G 3'.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the pairing would be wrong. Because the first base of the anticodon (5' A) would pair with the third base of the mRNA (U), which is correct (A pairs with U). The second base (U) would pair with the second mRNA base (A), correct. The third base (G) would pair with the first mRNA base (C), correct (G pairs with C). So the anticodon is 5' A U G 3'.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 5′-A-U-G-3′. But I thought that might be the case. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 5-′U-A-C-3′
B: 5′-U-G-C-3′
C: 5′-U-C-G-3′
D: 5′-G-T-A-3′
E: 5′-G-U-A-3′
F: 5′-C-A-U-3′
G: 5′-T-A-G-3′
H: 5′-A-U-G-3′
I: 5′-C-G-U-3′
J: 5′-A-T-G-3′

So option H is 5' A U G 3', which would match what I thought. But wait, I thought the anticodon would be 5' A U G 3', which is option H. But wait, another thought: mRNA is 5' C A U 3', so the anticodon should be 3' G U A 5'. So when written as a sequence in the 5' to 3' direction, it's A U G. So option H.

But wait, another point: tRNA anticodons are written 5' to 3', so the sequence should be the reverse complement of the mRNA. So if mRNA is C A U, the anticodon is A U G. So option H is correct.

Wait, but another thing: the DNA given is 5' C A T 3'. So the complementary DNA strand is 3' G T A 5'. But mRNA is made from the template strand, which is 3' G T A 5', so mRNA is 5' C A U 3' as given.

So the mRNA codon is 5' C A U 3'. The tRNA anticodon is complementary and antiparallel, so it's 3' G U A 5', which when written 5' to 3' is A U G. So the anticodon is 5' A U G 3', which is option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes I mix up the direction. Let me think of an example. Suppose mRNA is 5' A U G 3', then the anticodon would be 3' U A C 5', which is written as 5' C A U 3'. So in that case, the anticodon is complementary and reverse.

In our case, the mRNA is 5' C A U 3', so the anticodon should be 5' A U G 3' because it's the reverse complement (C<->G, A<->U, U<->A).

So the correct answer should be option H: 5′-A-U-G-3′.
</think>

The DNA sequence provided is 5′-C-A-T-3′. During transcription, mRNA is synthesized complementary to the template strand of DNA. The template strand is complementary to the coding strand, so the template strand would be 3′-G-T-A-5′. Transcription produces mRNA that is complementary to the template strand, resulting in mRNA with the sequence 5′-C-A-U-3′.

The tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon. Since tRNA anticodons are antiparallel and complementary to the mRNA codon, the anticodon must be the reverse complement of the mRNA codon. The mRNA codon is 5′-C-A-U-3′, so the anticodon is 3′-G-U-A-5′. When written in the 5′ to 3′ direction, the anticodon sequence is 5′-A-U-G-3′.

Among the given options, the correct nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon is **5′-A-U-G-3′**, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
