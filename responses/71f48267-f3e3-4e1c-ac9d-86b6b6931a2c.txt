Question:

A distributor agrees to sell 100 tubes of growth hormone to a medical treatment center in exchange for $30,000. The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?

Options:

A: No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.
B: Yes, unless the contract explicitly states that the bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive funds.
C: No, a bar of assignment can only be enforced if it is notarized and legally binding.
D: Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.
E: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.
F: Yes, a bar of assignment applies to all aspects of the contract, including the right to receive funds.
G: No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.
H: No, a bar of assignment is unenforceable if it inhibits the completion of the contract.
I: No, a court will not enforce the bar against assignment as it infringes upon the distributor's right to do business.
J: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable unless it contradicts federal law.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically regarding the assignment of rights. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that a distributor sells 100 tubes of growth hormone to a medical center for $30k. The contract has a clause that generally prohibits assignment of the contract or any of its terms. But despite that, the distributor assigns the right to receive the funds. The question is whether a court will enforce the bar against assignment in this case.

Hmm, I remember that contracts can usually be assigned unless there's a specific restriction. So if a contract says you can't assign it, that's a general rule. But there are exceptions. For example, if the assignment would materially affect the other party's duties or expectations, or if the contract explicitly prohibits assignment of a particular right, like the right to receive payment.

So the distributor is assigning the right to receive the funds. The contract's clause prohibits assignment of the contract or any of its terms. But does that clause specifically mention the right to receive funds, or is it a general prohibition?

I think the key here is whether the assignment of the right to receive funds is considered an assignment of the contract or just a part of it. If the contract prohibits any assignment of terms, then assigning the right to receive payment might be prohibited. But sometimes, courts treat the right to receive payment as a separate right that can be assigned unless explicitly restricted.

Wait, I remember something about the assignment of the right to payment. There's a principle that the right to receive money is assignable unless the contract says otherwise. So even if there's a general assignment clause, the right to receive payment might still be assignable.

Looking at the options, option A says no, the bar doesn't apply unless specifically stated. That seems to align with what I'm thinking because the contract here doesn't specify that the right to receive funds is prohibited, just a general assignment clause.

Option B says yes unless the contract says it's allowed. But that would mean the general bar applies, which I'm not sure about. I think the default is that the right to receive payment can be assigned unless prohibited.

Option D says yes, the bar applies unless stated otherwise. That seems too broad. I think the right to payment is often assignable even with a general prohibition.

So, I think the correct answer is A because the general assignment clause doesn't automatically prohibit the assignment of the right to receive funds unless specified.

The question revolves around whether a court will enforce a general contractual clause prohibiting assignment when the distributor assigns the right to receive funds. Generally, contracts can be assigned unless restricted, but the right to receive payment is often assignable unless explicitly prohibited. Since the contract only has a general assignment clause and does not specifically restrict the right to receive funds, the bar against assignment does not apply. 

Answer: A
