Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Dershowitz's discussion on the 9/11 hijacked planes hypothetical. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is about what Dershowitz argues regarding important decisions like whether to shoot down hijacked planes. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that Dershowitz has written about this case before. In his book "The Enemy of My Enemy," he discusses a scenario where the U.S. government might consider shooting down a hijacked plane to prevent it from crashing into a building, like the World Trade Center. He raises ethical and legal questions about such a decision, particularly focusing on the balance between saving lives and the potential for loss of innocent lives on the plane.

Dershowitz's point, if I recall correctly, is about the morality of making such a decision. He argues that in extreme situations, even if a decision leads to the deaths of some, it might be justified if it prevents greater loss of life. However, the question here is about how these decisions should be made, not just whether they're moral.

Looking at the options:

A: Should always be made by a single person for accountability. I think Dershowitz might argue against this because a single person making such a life-and-death decision without oversight could lead to accountability issues, but I'm not sure if that's his main point.

B: Influenced by personal bias. While bias is a factor in decisions, I don't think this is the main takeaway from Dershowitz's argument in this context.

C: Made by the military without civilians. That doesn't seem right because Dershowitz's point is more about the ethical dilemma and the structure of decision-making, not about military vs. civilian control.

D: Committee of experts. This seems plausible because a committee could provide diverse input and expertise, but I'm not sure if that's what Dershowitz emphasizes.

E: Avoided through diplomacy. Doesn't fit because the scenario is after the hijacking has happened; diplomacy wouldn't apply here.

F: No objective answer. This could be, as the decision is morally complex, but the question is about how decisions should be made, not the existence of an objective answer.

G: None of the above. If none fit, this is the option.

H: Not worth the moral cost. Dershowitz might say it's worth considering, so this is probably not correct.

I: Made quickly without immediate authorization. This seems relevant because in a crisis, quick decisions are necessary, and perhaps there's no time for authorization. Dershowitz might argue that such decisions require immediate action without waiting for committees.

J: Made with visibility and accountability by high-level officials. This sounds like it's about transparency and responsibility, which Dershowitz might support, ensuring that those making such decisions are accountable.

Wait, but the question is about Dershowitz's argument when discussing the case. He uses this example to talk about the necessity of making such decisions, perhaps emphasizing that in extreme situations, decisions have to be made quickly and without the luxury of waiting for authorization. So he's highlighting the need for quick action and the structure of decision-making.

Looking back, option I says decisions often have to be made quickly and without immediate authorization. That seems to align with the idea that in a crisis, you can't wait for lengthy processes, so a decision must be made swiftly, even if it means bypassing some authorization steps.

Alternatively, option J talks about visibility and accountability by high-level officials. Dershowitz might argue that while decisions need to be made quickly, they should still be made by those accountable, perhaps at the highest levels, to ensure that responsibility is clear.

Wait, but Dershowitz's point is more about the ethical justification for such a decision and the structure of authority. He might argue that a single person can't be the only decision-maker because of the potential for error or misuse of power. So perhaps he supports a system where decisions are made by a group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, he might argue that in such a situation, the decision has to be made quickly, even if it means not going through the usual channels. That would point to option I.

Hmm. Another angle: Dershowitz might be making a case about the necessity of making such decisions, emphasizing that they require immediate action without waiting for committees or approvals. So the key point is the speed and lack of authorization needed.

So, putting it all together, the answer is likely I: often have to be made quickly and without immediate authorization.
</think>

The question revolves around Dershowitz's argument regarding the decision to shoot down hijacked planes, focusing on how such decisions should be made. Dershowitz emphasizes the necessity of making quick decisions in extreme situations, even if it means bypassing traditional authorization processes. This aligns with the idea that in a crisis, swift action is crucial, and decisions cannot afford to wait for lengthy approvals. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I

**Answer: I**
