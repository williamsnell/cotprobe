Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Addison's Act had been conceived in the belief that, unless working-class aspirations were quickly met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia. By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, "having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.
—Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994

Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a change in housing plans in Britain after World War I, specifically referring to Addison's Act and the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme. I'm a bit rusty on British history, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, the passage mentions that Addison's Act was created because there was a fear that if working-class aspirations weren't met quickly after the war, there might be a revolution like Russia's. So, the government was trying to address housing issues to prevent social unrest. But by 1920, this fear started to go away, and Addison's policies were seen as too extravagant.

In September 1920, the Council approved provisional plans for the Kingfield Street scheme. However, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, probably because they were worried about money or commitments. Then, in May 1921, the government cut the housing target by half, which was a significant reduction.

Looking at the options, I need to find the best description of what happened. The key points are that the plans were changed—specifically, the Kingfield Street scheme was deferred, and the housing program was drastically cut.

Option A: Housing was a large part of the British budget. The passage doesn't say anything about the budget size, just that money was an issue for deferring the scheme. So maybe, but not directly the best choice.

Option B: The Housing Board was indifferent. They deferred the scheme, but the reason given was financial and current commitments, not necessarily indifference. So maybe, but I'm not sure.

Option C: The scheme was approved without issues. No, the opposite happened; it was deferred, so C is wrong.

Option D: The Board wanted to build more houses. No, they cut the target, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Government announced an increase. No, they cut it, so E is wrong.

Option F: Planning to increase instead of cut. Opposite of what happened, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Council expected deferment. The Council was surprised, so G is wrong.

Option H: Workers were threatening revolution. The initial fear was there, but by 1920, it was receding. The passage says the fear was beginning to recede, so maybe H is partially true but not the best fit for the plan change.

Option I: Welfare programs were questioned after WWI. The passage talks about housing, which is part of welfare, but it's more about the specific changes in the program rather than questioning them in general. So I might be a contender.

Option J: Addison's Act was widely supported. No, the policy was being seen as extravagant, so J is incorrect.

So, the best fit seems to be I: Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War. But wait, the passage isn't exactly saying that welfare programs were questioned, but rather that the housing program was cut because the fear of revolution was receding. So maybe that's not the best answer.

Wait, looking again, the question is about the best description of the plans being changed. The key changes were the deferment of the Kingfield Street scheme and the cutting of the housing target. So the change was a reduction in the housing program.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the best answer is I: Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War. Because the passage shows that the government was scaling back their housing efforts, which is a welfare program. However, the passage doesn't explicitly say that welfare programs were questioned, but it does show that the housing part was being cut back, which could be a sign that the approach to welfare was being reconsidered.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H: Workers were threatening communist revolution. But the passage says that by 1920, the fear of revolution was receding. So the initial reason for the Act was fear of revolution, but by 1920, that fear was lessening, leading to the cutbacks. So H is more about the initial motivation, not the change in plans.

Wait, the question is about the best description of the plans being changed. The plans were changed because the government was cutting back on housing. So, looking at the options, which one describes that change?

Option I says welfare programs were questioned. If the government is cutting back on a welfare program (housing), that implies that welfare programs were being scrutinized. So I think I is the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the passage mentions that by 1920, the fear of revolution was receding, so the government felt it could cut back on housing. This suggests that the initial motivation for the housing program (fear of revolution) was no longer as pressing, leading to the reduction. So the change in plans was due to the receding fear, but the options don't directly mention that.

Wait, let's read the options again. The question is about the best description of the plans being changed. The plans were changed because the government cut the housing target. So the change was a reduction in the housing program.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with that? Option I says welfare programs were questioned. If the government is cutting a welfare program, that implies questioning or reevaluating it. So I think I is the best answer.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H, but since the fear was receding, H isn't the main reason for the change. So I think I is the correct choice.

The best description of the plans being changed is that welfare programs were questioned after the First World War, as evidenced by the government's decision to cut the housing target and defer the Kingfield Street scheme. This indicates a reevaluation or scaling back of welfare initiatives.
