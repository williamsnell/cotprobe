Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the difference between prejudice and discrimination. I remember from my classes that these terms are related but not exactly the same. Let me think about each term separately first.

Prejudice, as I recall, is like a preconceived opinion or attitude towards a group of people. It's usually based on stereotypes and can be positive or negative. For example, if someone thinks all people from a certain country are hardworking, that's a prejudice. But more often, it's negative, like thinking a group is inferior.

Discrimination, on the other hand, is the action taken because of those prejudices. It's when someone treats others differently, usually in a negative way, based on those preconceived ideas. So if someone refuses to hire someone because of their race, that's discrimination based on their prejudiced view.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says discrimination is policies favoring one group, and prejudice is the economic outcome. That doesn't sound right because discrimination can be both formal policies and informal actions, and prejudice isn't just about economics.

Option B says prejudice is a legal system of segregation, and discrimination is individual choice. That's not correct because prejudice isn't a legal system; it's more of an attitude. Discrimination can be both legal and individual.

Option C states that prejudice is an attitude towards a group, and discrimination is the action based on that. This fits with what I was thinking. Prejudice is the attitude, and discrimination is the behavior that comes from it.

Option D says prejudice is behavior and discrimination is attitude. That's the opposite of what I think, so D is probably wrong.

Option E says discrimination is any action, positive or negative, and prejudice is the belief leading to those actions. Well, discrimination is indeed actions based on prejudice, so E seems correct too. Wait, but E says discrimination can be positive or negative. I'm not sure if that's accurate because discrimination is often considered negative, but technically, positive actions can also be discriminatory, like affirmative action. So E might be correct in a way.

Option F claims prejudice is learned and can be unlearned, while discrimination is a natural tendency. I think both can be learned and changed, so F might not be right.

Option G says they are the same. No, they're related but distinct, so G is wrong.

Option H defines discrimination as making distinctions and prejudice as unfair based on age. That's too narrow because prejudice can be based on many factors, not just age.

Option I says prejudice is a positive attitude and discrimination is negative. That's not right because prejudice can be negative, and discrimination isn't always negative; it can be positive as in affirmative action.

Option J says prejudice is subconscious and doesn't affect behavior, while discrimination is a conscious choice. I don't think that's accurate because prejudice can influence behavior without being conscious, and discrimination can be both conscious and subconscious.

So, between C and E. Let me read them again.

Option C: Prejudice is an attitude towards a group, and discrimination is the action based on that. That matches my understanding.

Option E: Discrimination is any action, positive or negative, and prejudice is the belief leading to those actions. That also seems correct but perhaps more about the cause and effect.

Wait, but the question is to distinguish between them. C clearly separates them as attitude and action. E also does that but might include more about the nature of discrimination.

I think both C and E are correct, but looking at the options, C is more precise. Because E says discrimination is any action, positive or negative, which is true, but the main point is that prejudice leads to discrimination. C directly states that discrimination is the translation of prejudice into behavior.

So the best answer is C.

The question asks to distinguish between prejudice and discrimination. Prejudice refers to a preconceived attitude or opinion, often based on stereotypes, towards a group of people. Discrimination, on the other hand, involves the actions or behaviors taken as a result of these prejudiced attitudes. 

Option C correctly states that prejudice is an attitude towards a particular group, while discrimination is the action that results from these prejudiced views. This aligns with the understanding that prejudice is the belief, and discrimination is the behavior based on that belief.

Option E also touches on the relationship between prejudice and discrimination, but it is less precise. While it correctly identifies that discrimination is based on prejudice, it does not as clearly differentiate between the two concepts as Option C does. Additionally, Option C provides a clearer separation of the two terms, emphasizing that prejudice is an attitude and discrimination is the resulting action.

The correct answer is **C**.
