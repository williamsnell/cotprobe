Question:

Select the single most accurate statement about the absorptive area of the human intestine?


Options:

A: The absorptive area is equivalent to that of a tennis court
B: All of the options given are correct
C: Changes in motility increase the contact time between nutrients and absorptive surface
D: The presence of folds, villi and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes magnifies the absorptive area

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about the absorptive area of the human intestine. I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break down the options one by one.

Option A says the absorptive area is equivalent to a tennis court. I remember hearing something about the intestine's surface area being large, maybe like a tennis court. But wait, isn't a tennis court really big? Maybe it's the small intestine they're referring to. I think the small intestine has a surface area that's about the size of a football field or something. Or was it a tennis court? I'm a bit confused.

Option B says all options are correct. Hmm, that's probably not right. Usually in these questions, only one option is correct. Plus, from what I know, not all options can be accurate. So B is likely incorrect.

Option C states that changes in motility increase contact time between nutrients and the absorptive surface. That makes sense because if the intestines move more slowly, the nutrients have more time to be absorbed. So C sounds correct, but I'm not sure if it's the most accurate statement about the absorptive area specifically.

Option D mentions folds, villi, and microvilli on enterocytes, which increase the absorptive area. Oh yeah, I definitely remember that. Enterocytes are the cells lining the small intestine, and they have all these structures like villi (which are like small fingers) and microvilli (even smaller) that greatly increase the surface area. These structures are a key reason why the absorptive area is so large. So D seems correct.

Wait, but the question is asking for the single most accurate statement. So I need to see which one is best. Option A might be a common fact, but I'm not sure if it's accurate. I think the small intestine's surface area is about the size of a tennis court when you consider the villi and microvilli. But I also remember that without those structures, it's just a small tube. So the presence of villi and microvilli is what makes the absorptive area so big, which supports option D.

So looking at each option, D directly addresses the structural features that increase the absorptive area, which is exactly what the question is about. Option C is about motility affecting absorption time, which is true but not directly about the area. So the best answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: The presence of folds, villi, and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes magnifies the absorptive area. This directly addresses the structural features that increase the absorptive capacity of the intestine. 

Answer: D
