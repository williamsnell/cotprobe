Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the ampere turns needed for a magnetic core. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the problem says it's an atoroidal type of magnetic core with a rectangular cross-section. The parameters given are l_m = 20 cm, A_m = 2 cm², l_g = 0.1 cm, μ_r = 4000. The target is to find the ampere turns required to get a magnetic flux density B_g of 0.1 Wb/m² in the air gap. Oh, and the air-gap area A_g is given as 2.31 cm².

Wait, let me make sure I understand all the terms here. Ampere turns is just the product of current in amperes and the number of turns in the coil, right? So N*I, where N is the number of turns and I is the current.

Magnetic flux density, B, is measured in Weber per square meter. The formula I remember for flux density in a magnetic material is B = μH, where μ is the permeability and H is the magnetic field strength. But wait, in this case, there's an air gap. So the flux in the core and the air gap would be linked somehow.

I think the approach here is to consider the flux in the core and the air gap as part of the same magnetic circuit. So the total flux would be the same in both parts if the coil is continuous. But wait, no, because the flux in the core and the air gap are in series, so the same flux links both. So the flux Φ in the core equals the flux in the air gap because it's a continuous path.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The flux through the core and the air gap would be the same, because the magnetic flux forms a closed loop. So the flux Φ through the core's cross-section A_m is the same as the flux through the air gap's cross-section A_g.

So, Φ = B_g * A_g. Since B is given as 0.1 Wb/m², and A_g is 2.31 cm², I need to convert units here. Let me calculate Φ first.

Wait, 0.1 Wb/m² is the same as 0.1 Weber per square meter. But A_g is 2.31 cm², which is 2.31e-4 m². So Φ = B_g * A_g = 0.1 * 2.31e-4 = 2.31e-5 Weber.

Now, the flux through the core is the same as the flux through the air gap, so Φ = B_m * A_m, where B_m is the flux density in the core. But wait, no, actually, in the core, the flux is Φ = B_m * A_m, and the same Φ passes through the air gap, which is Φ = B_g * A_g. So they're equal, so I can set them equal.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ampere turns, which relates to the magnetizing force H, and then using the permeability to find B.

Alternatively, the formula for the magnetic field H is H = (N*I) / l_total, where l_total is the mean path length around the core. But wait, in this case, maybe the mean path length is l_m plus l_g? Or is it just l_m?

Wait, no, the core has a mean length l_m, and the air gap has a length l_g. So the total path length for the magnetic flux would be l_m + l_g. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because in a magnetic circuit, the flux goes around the core and through the air gap. So the mean path length for the core is l_m, and for the air gap, it's l_g. But the total reluctance would be the sum of the core's and air gap's reluctances.

Wait, I think I should model this using the concept of magnetomotive force (MMF) and flux balance. The MMF is the same around the entire loop. So the MMF is N*I, where N is the number of turns and I is the current in amperes.

The MMF is also equal to the sum of the products of the flux in each part and the corresponding reluctance. So, MMF = Φ*(Reluctance_core + Reluctance_air_gap).

Reluctance is given by R = l/(μ*A), where l is the mean path length, and A is the cross-sectional area. The permeability μ is μ0*μ_r, where μ0 is the permeability of free space (4πe-7 H/m).

So, for the core, Reluctance_core = l_m / (μ0 * μ_r * A_m).

And for the air gap, Reluctance_air_gap = l_g / (μ0 * μ_air * A_g), since the air gap has μ_r = 1 (μ_air = μ0).

Now, the flux Φ is the same through both the core and the air gap. So Φ = B_g * A_g = B_m * A_m, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, but since the MMF is the same around the loop, we can write:

N*I = Φ * (R_core + R_air_gap)

But Φ = B_g * A_g, so substituting that in:

N*I = (B_g * A_g) * [ (l_m)/(μ0 * μ_r * A_m) ) + (l_g)/(μ0 * (1) * A_g) ) ]

Wait, let me write that equation again:

N*I = Φ * ( R_core + R_air_gap )

Where R_core = l_m/(μ0 * μ_r * A_m) and R_air_gap = l_g/(μ0 * μ_air * A_g).

But since Φ = B_g * A_g, substituting:

N*I = (B_g * A_g) * [ l_m/(μ0 * μ_r * A_m) + l_g/(μ0 * μ_air * A_g) ) ]

Hmm, but μ_air is μ0, so μ_air = μ0. So:

N*I = B_g * A_g * μ0⁻¹ [ (l_m/(μ_r * A_m)) + (l_g / (1 * A_g)) ) ]

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the reluctances.

Compute R_core:
R_core = l_m / (μ0 * μ_r * A_m)
Given l_m = 20 cm = 0.2 m, A_m = 2 cm² = 2e-4 m², μ_r = 4000.

So R_core = 0.2 m / (4πe-7 H/m * 4000 * 2e-4 m² )

Wait, let's compute the denominator first:
4πe-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6
Multiply by 4000: 1.2566e-6 * 4000 ≈ 5.0264e-3
Multiply by 2e-4 m²: 5.0264e-3 * 2e-4 = 1.00528e-6

So R_core = 0.2 / 1.00528e-6 ≈ 199,000 (approx) Ohm.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.2 / (1.2566e-6 * 4000 * 2e-4) 

Compute denominator:

1.2566e-6 * 4000 = 5.0264e-3

Then 5.0264e-3 * 2e-4 = 1.00528e-6

So R_core = 0.2 / 1.00528e-6 = 0.2 / 0.00000100528 ≈ 199,000 Ohms.

Now compute R_air_gap:

R_air_gap = l_g / (μ0 * μ_air * A_g)
l_g = 0.1 cm = 0.001 m
A_g = 2.31 cm² = 2.31e-4 m²
μ_air = μ0 = 4πe-7 H/m

So R_air_gap = 0.001 / (4πe-7 * 1 * 2.31e-4 )

Compute denominator: 4πe-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6 H/m. Multiply by 2.31e-4 m²: 1.2566e-6 * 2.31e-4 ≈ 2.899e-10

So R_air_gap = 0.001 / 2.899e-10 ≈ 3.454e+6 Ohms.

Wait, that seems high. Let me recheck:

Denominator: 4πe-7 * 2.31e-4 = (4 * π * 2.31e-4) * 1e-7.

Wait, 4 * π ≈ 12.566. 12.566 * 2.31e-4 ≈ 2.899e-3. Then 2.899e-3 * 1e-7 = 2.899e-10.

So R_air_gap = 0.001 / 2.899e-10 ≈ 3.454e+6 Ohms.

Now, total R_total = R_core + R_air_gap = 199,000 + 3,454,000 ≈ 3,653,000 Ohms.

Now, the flux Φ is B_g * A_g = 0.1 Wb/m² * 2.31e-4 m² = 2.31e-5 Wb (Webers).

Wait, because 0.1 W/m² * 2.31e-4 m² = 0.1 * 2.31e-4 = 2.31e-5 Wb.

So now, the MMF is N*I = Φ * R_total.

So N*I = 2.31e-5 Wb * 3,653,000 Ohms.

Wait, Wb is equivalent to V*s, and Ohms is V/A, so Wb*Ohm = V*s * V/A = (V²*s)/A. Hmm, not sure about the units, but proceeding.

Calculating:

2.31e-5 * 3.653e6 ≈ 2.31e-5 * 3.653e6 = let's compute that.

2.31e-5 * 3.653e6 = (2.31 * 3.653) * 1e1 = 8.433 * 10 = 84.33.

So N*I ≈ 84.33 Ampere turns.

Looking at the options, option I is 84.1, which is very close. So probably that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the units? Let me double-check.

In calculating Φ, B_g is 0.1 Wb/m², A_g is 2.31e-4 m². So Φ = 0.1 * 2.31e-4 = 2.31e-5 Wb. That's correct.

Then R_core: 0.2 m / (4πe-7 * 4000 * 2e-4) = 0.2 / (4πe-7 * 4000 * 2e-4). Let me compute denominator again.

4πe-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6.

1.2566e-6 * 4000 = 5.0264e-3.

5.0264e-3 * 2e-4 = 1.00528e-6.

So R_core = 0.2 / 1.00528e-6 ≈ 199,000 Ohms.

R_air_gap: 0.001 m / (4πe-7 * 2.31e-4 m²) = 0.001 / (4πe-7 * 2.31e-4) =

4πe-7 * 2.31e-4 = 1.2566e-6 * 2.31e-4 = 2.899e-10.

R_air_gap = 0.001 / 2.899e-10 ≈ 3.454e6 Ohms.

So R_total = 199,000 + 3,454,000 ≈ 3,653,000 Ohms.

Then N*I = Φ * R_total = 2.31e-5 * 3,653,000 ≈ 84.33.

So, yes, that's approximately 84 Ampere turns. Looking back at the options, option I is 84.1, which matches closely. So the answer should be I.

To determine the ampere turns \( N \times I \) required to achieve a magnetic flux density \( B_g = 0.1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \) in the air gap, we analyze the magnetic circuit consisting of the core and the air gap. The total magnetomotive force (MMF) around the loop is equal to the sum of the products of the flux density and the reluctances of the core and air gap.

1. **Calculate the flux \( \Phi \) in the air gap:**
   \[
   \Phi = B_g \times A_g = 0.1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \times 2.31 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 = 2.31 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{Wb}.
   \]

2. **Determine the reluctances of the core and air gap:**
   - **Core reluctance \( R_{\text{core}} \):**
     \[
     R_{\text{core}} = \frac{l_m}{\mu_0 \mu_r A_m} = \frac{0.2 \, \text{m}}{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 4000 \times 2 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 199,000 \, \Omega.
     \]
   - **Air gap reluctance \( R_{\text{air}} \):**
     \[
     R_{\text{air}} = \frac{l_g}{\mu_0 A_g} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{m}}{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 2.31 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 3,454,000 \, \Omega.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total reluctance \( R_{\text{total}} \):**
   \[
   R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{core}} + R_{\text{air}} = 199,000 \, \Omega + 3,454,000 \, \Omega \approx 3,653,000 \, \Omega.
   \]

4. **Relate MMF to flux and total reluctance:**
   \[
   N \times I = \Phi \times R_{\text{total}} = 2.31 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{Wb} \times 3,653,000 \, \Omega \approx 84.33 \, \text{Ampere turns}.
   \]

The closest option to the calculated value is **84.1 Ampere turns**.
