<think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: 10 cc of battery acid with a density of 1.21 is diluted to 100 cc. Then, 30 cc of this diluted solution is neutralized by 45 cc of 0.5 N base. I need to find the normality of the diluted acid, its strength in grams per liter, and the strength of the undiluted acid in g/l. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I think I need to use the concepts of dilution and neutralization reactions here.

First, battery acid is typically sulfuric acid, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, which means each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So, in terms of normality, each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 equivalents.

Wait, normality is a measure of concentration that's used in reactions, especially acid-base reactions. It's defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solution. For H2SO4, since each mole gives 2 equivalents, the normality is twice the molarity.

So, the first step is about dilution. We start with 10 cc of concentrated acid, density 1.21 g/cc, and dilute it to 100 cc. Then, we take 30 cc of this diluted solution and neutralize it with 45 cc of 0.5 N base.

I think I can approach this using the dilution formula, C1V1 = C2V2, but since it's about normality and neutralization, maybe I should consider the equivalents.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the normality of the diluted solution.
2. Use the dilution equation to find the normality before dilution (which would be the original acid's normality).
3. Then calculate the strength in grams per liter for the diluted and original solutions.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the problem is asking for the normality of the diluted acid, its strength in g/l, and the strength of the undiluted acid. So I think I need to find all three values.

Wait, no, the problem says: What is the normality of the diluted acid? What is its strength in grams per liter? What is the strength of the undiluted 1.21 density acid in g/l?

So three parts, but looking at the options, each option gives three numbers: normality, diluted strength, undiluted strength.

So first, let's find the normality of the diluted acid.

Let me think about the neutralization reaction. The diluted acid is neutralized by the base. The reaction would be H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O. So, the acid is diprotic, and each mole provides 2 equivalents. The base is NaOH, which is monobasic, so each mole provides 1 equivalent.

In neutralization, equivalents of acid = equivalents of base.

The base used is 45 cc of 0.5 N NaOH. So, equivalents of base = N_base × volume = 0.5 × 45 = 22.5 equivalents.

Since the acid is diprotic, each mole gives 2 equivalents. So, the equivalents of acid in 30 cc of the diluted solution is also 22.5.

So, the normality of the diluted acid (N_acid) is calculated as:

Equivalents = Normality × Volume
22.5 = N_acid × 30
So, N_acid = 22.5 / 30 = 0.75 N.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the normality of the diluted acid is 0.75 N.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.75 N as the first value. Let's check other options. Option D is 0.8, which is higher. Option E is 0.5, which seems lower. So A and E have 0.75 and 0.5 respectively.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. The base is 45 cc of 0.5 N, so 45 * 0.5 = 22.5 eq. The acid used is 30 cc, so 22.5 eq in 30 cc. So normality is 22.5 /30 = 0.75 N. Yes, that seems right.

So the first part is 0.75 N, which points to option A or G or I, but looking at the options, only A and E have 0.75 and 0.5, respectively.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A: 0.75 N, 121 g/l, 1210 g/l

E: 0.5 N, 120 g/l, 1200 g/l

So I think the first part is 0.75 N, which would be option A or others. Let's proceed.

Now, the second part is the strength of the diluted acid in grams per liter. Strength in grams per liter usually refers to the mass of solute per liter of solution. For sulfuric acid, the molarity can be calculated from normality, then multiplied by molar mass to get grams per liter.

Wait, but to get grams per liter (g/L), I can compute it as (normality × molar mass) / n, where n is the number of H+ ions per molecule. Since H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so n=2.

Molarity (M) = Normality / n = 0.75 N / 2 = 0.375 M.

Molar mass of H2SO4 is 98.079 g/mol. So, grams per liter would be M × molar mass = 0.375 × 98.079 ≈ 36.8 g/L. Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration in terms of weight percent or something else. Wait, perhaps I should approach it from the dilution standpoint.

Wait, let's think again. The diluted solution is 100 cc, made from 10 cc of the concentrated acid. So, first, let me find the normality of the concentrated acid before dilution.

Wait, but wait. I think I can approach this by considering the dilution first. Let me outline the steps again.

1. Calculate the normality of the diluted acid, which I found to be 0.75 N.
2. Use the dilution formula to find the normality of the concentrated acid.

The dilution formula is N1V1 = N2V2.

Here, N1 is the normality of the concentrated acid, V1 is 10 cc. After dilution, we have V2 as 100 cc, and N2 is the diluted normality, which is 0.75 N.

So, N1 × 10 = 0.75 × 100 → N1 = (0.75 × 100)/10 = 7.5 N.

So the concentrated acid has a normality of 7.5 N.

Now, to find the strength of the diluted acid in grams per liter, perhaps I can calculate the concentration in terms of grams per liter.

Wait, but I think I need to find the concentration of the diluted solution in grams per liter. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the concentration of the diluted solution using the normality and the density.

Wait, the diluted solution is 100 cc, made from 10 cc of the concentrated acid. The concentrated acid has a density of 1.21 g/cc, so its mass is 10 cc × 1.21 g/cc = 12.1 grams.

When diluted to 100 cc, the mass of the diluted solution is 100 cc × density of diluted solution. But wait, I don't know the density of the diluted solution. So perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the grams of H2SO4 in the diluted solution.

Wait, the diluted solution is 100 cc, and the normality is 0.75 N. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, the molarity is 0.75 / 2 = 0.375 M.

So, moles of H2SO4 in 100 cc (0.1 L) is 0.375 × 0.1 = 0.0375 moles.

Mass of H2SO4 is moles × molar mass = 0.0375 × 98.079 ≈ 3.68 g in 100 cc, so grams per liter would be 36.8 g/L.

But looking at the options, none of them have 36 g/L. The options for the diluted strength are around 120 g/L (option A, E), etc. That's way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the grams per liter. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the weight of the solution, not the solute. Hmm, no, I think grams per liter refers to the solute.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the "strength in grams per liter" refers to the mass of H2SO4 in the diluted solution. Or perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's first find the concentration of the diluted solution in grams per liter.

Wait, but to find grams per liter of the diluted solution, perhaps I can compute the grams of H2SO4 in 100 cc and then convert to g/L.

We know the normality of the diluted solution is 0.75 N. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, the molarity (M) is 0.75 / 2 = 0.375 M.

So, in 100 cc (0.1 L), the moles of H2SO4 are 0.375 × 0.1 = 0.0375 mol. The mass is 0.0375 × 98.079 ≈ 3.68 g in 100 cc, so 36.8 g/L. But none of the options have this, so I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the initial concentrated acid's properties.

The concentrated acid is 10 cc with density 1.21 g/cc. So mass is 10 × 1.21 = 12.1 grams. This is H2SO4, so moles = 12.1 g / 98.079 g/mol ≈ 0.1234 mol.

When diluted to 100 cc, the normality becomes N2. Using the dilution formula, N1 × V1 = N2 × V2.

N1 is the normality of concentrated acid. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 equivalents, so N1 = 2 × (0.1234 mol / 0.01 L) )= 2 × 12.34 = 24.68 N? That can't be right because when I diluted 10 cc to 100 cc, the normality became 0.75 N, which is way lower than 24.68. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the normality of the concentrated solution. Wait, the concentrated solution is 10 cc with density 1.21 g/cc. Let me calculate its normality.

The mass is 12.1 grams, as before. Moles of H2SO4 = 12.1 / 98.079 ≈ 0.1234 mol.

Each mole gives 2 equivalents, so normality N1 = 2 × (0.1234 mol) / (0.01 L) )= 2 × 12.34 ≈ 24.68 N.

But when we dilute 10 cc (0.01 L) of this to 100 cc (0.1 L), the normality becomes N2 = (24.68 × 0.01) / 0.1 = 2.468 N. But earlier, using the neutralization, I found the diluted normality to be 0.75 N, which contradicts this.

Ah, so there's a mistake here. Because if the diluted solution's normality is 0.75 N as calculated earlier, but according to dilution from the concentrated acid, it's 2.468 N, which can't be both. So I must have made a mistake in the initial neutralization calculation.

Wait, let's go back. I think I made a mistake in the neutralization step. Let me recheck that.

The neutralization reaction: H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O.

So the equivalents of H2SO4 (diprotic) would be equal to the equivalents of NaOH (monobasic).

Equivalents of NaOH = Normality × Volume = 0.5 N × 45 cc = 22.5 equivalents.

So, equivalents of H2SO4 = 22.5.

But since H2SO4 provides 2 equivalents per mole, the number of moles of H2SO4 is 22.5 / 2 = 11.25 mmol.

Wait, but wait, the volume of the acid solution is 30 cc. So the normality of the acid solution is:

Normality (N) = Equivalents / Volume (L) = 22.5 eq / 0.03 L = 0.75 N.

So that part was correct.

Wait, but according to the dilution, if the concentrated acid is 24.68 N, diluting 10 cc to 100 cc would give a normality of 24.68 × (10/100) = 2.468 N, which is way higher than 0.75 N. So there's a contradiction here. That suggests that my initial assumption about the concentrated acid's normality is wrong, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in my calculation of the concentrated acid's normality. Let me think again.

Wait, when we have 10 cc of concentrated acid with density 1.21 g/cc, the mass is 12.1 grams. Moles of H2SO4 = 12.1 / 98.079 ≈ 0.1234 mol.

Since each mole contributes 2 eq, the normality is (0.1234 mol × 2 eq/mol) / 0.01 L = 24.68 N.

But when we dilute that 10 cc to 100 cc, normality becomes 24.68 × (10/100) = 2.468 N.

But according to the neutralization, the diluted solution has a normality of 0.75 N, which is much lower than 2.468 N. So this can't be.

So there's a mistake in my approach. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the neutralization is done on the diluted solution, but the diluted solution is 100 cc. So the 30 cc used for neutralization is part of the diluted solution.

So, using the neutralization data, we can find the normality of the diluted solution, which we did as 0.75 N.

Now, using the dilution equation: N1 × V1 = N2 × V2.

N1 is the normality of the concentrated acid, V1=10 cc, N2=0.75 N, V2=100 cc.

So N1 = (N2 × V2) / V1 = (0.75 × 100) /10 = 7.5 N.

Ah, that's better. So the concentrated acid has a normality of 7.5 N, not 24.68 N. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I see. I think I confused the calculation. The 12.1 grams is the mass of the concentrated acid, but to find the normality, I should calculate the equivalents in 10 cc of the concentrated acid, not the entire solution.

So, let's recalculate.

Mass of H2SO4 in 10 cc: 10 cc × 1.21 g/cc = 12.1 grams.

Molar mass of H2SO4 = 98.079 g/mol.

Moles = 12.1 / 98.079 ≈ 0.1234 mol.

Each mole gives 2 equivalents, so equivalents = 0.1234 × 2 ≈ 0.2468 eq.

Volume is 10 cc = 0.01 L.

Normality N1 = equivalents / volume = 0.2468 eq / 0.01 L = 24.68 N.

Wait, but according to the dilution, N1 ×10 = 0.75 ×100 → N1=7.5 N. So 24.68 N vs 7.5 N. This is a conflict.

So clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to reconcile this.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't using the correct approach. Let me think: the 10 cc of concentrated acid is diluted to 100 cc, so the diluted solution's normality is 7.5 N × (10/100) = 0.75 N, which matches the neutralization result.

So that's correct. So the concentrated acid's normality is 7.5 N, not 24.68 N. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I confused the calculation. The 12.1 grams is the mass of the concentrated acid in 10 cc, but when calculating normality, we should consider the concentration in terms of equivalents per liter.

So, let's correct that:

Mass of H2SO4 in 10 cc: 12.1 g.

Moles: 12.1 / 98.079 ≈ 0.1234 mol.

Equivalents: 0.1234 × 2 = 0.2468 eq in 10 cc.

Normality N1 = 0.2468 eq / 0.01 L = 24.68 N.

But according to the dilution equation, N1 should be 7.5 N. Therefore, this can't be correct. So there's a contradiction, which means I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong approach. Let me try another way.

The problem gives the density of the concentrated acid as 1.21 g/cc. So, the mass of 10 cc is 12.1 grams.

Molarity (M) of concentrated acid is (mass / molar mass) / volume in liters.

M = (12.1 g / 98.079 g/mol) / 0.01 L ≈ (0.1234 mol) / 0.01 L = 12.34 M.

Since H2SO4 is diprotic, normality (N) = 2 × M = 24.68 N.

But when diluted to 100 cc, the normality becomes 24.68 × (10/100) = 2.468 N.

But according to the neutralization, the diluted solution has a normality of 0.75 N. So this doesn't add up.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the initial neutralization calculation. Let me go back.

The neutralization: 30 cc of diluted acid is neutralized by 45 cc of 0.5 N NaOH.

Equivalents of NaOH = 0.5 × 45 = 22.5 eq.

Since H2SO4 donates 2 eq per mole, the equivalents of H2SO4 in 30 cc is 22.5 eq.

So normality of diluted acid = 22.5 eq / 0.03 L = 0.75 N. So that part is correct.

But according to the dilution, N_diluted = N_concentrated × (V_concentrated / V_diluted) = N_conc × (10 / 100) = 0.1 × N_conc.

So N_conc = N_diluted / 0.1 = 0.75 / 0.1 = 7.5 N.

So the concentrated acid has a normality of 7.5 N, not 24.68 N.

Wait a minute, that's different from the earlier calculation. So how can the concentrated acid have 7.5 N normality when its density is 1.21 g/cc?

Let me recalculate the normality of the concentrated acid using the correct approach.

Mass of 10 cc: 10 × 1.21 = 12.1 g.

Molar mass of H2SO4 is 98.079 g/mol.

Moles = 12.1 / 98.079 ≈ 0.1234 mol.

Equivalents = 0.1234 × 2 = 0.2468 eq in 10 cc.

Normality N = equivalents / volume in liters → 0.2468 / 0.01 = 24.68 N.

But this contradicts the earlier result of 7.5 N. So something is wrong here.

Ah, I think I'm mixing up the dilution steps. Let me think again.

The concentrated acid is diluted 10 cc to 100 cc, so the normality decreases by a factor of 10. So if the diluted acid is 0.75 N, the concentrated is 7.5 N.

But according to the calculation using mass, the concentrated acid is 24.68 N, which is way higher. So where's the mistake?

Wait, maybe the problem is that the 10 cc of concentrated acid is diluted to 100 cc, but the 10 cc has a higher concentration than that. Let me think differently.

Perhaps I should calculate the concentration of the diluted solution first, then use the dilution to find the concentrated solution's concentration.

Wait, the diluted solution's normality is 0.75 N.

So, using dilution formula:

N_concentrated × V_concentrated = N_diluted × V_diluted.

So N_concentrated × 10 = 0.75 × 100 → N_concentrated = (0.75 ×100)/10 =7.5 N.

So the concentrated acid is 7.5 N.

Now, to find the grams per liter of the concentrated acid, we can calculate the grams of H2SO4 in 1 liter of concentrated acid.

First, find the molarity of the concentrated acid. Since normality is 7.5 N and it's diprotic, molarity M = N / 2 = 7.5 / 2 = 3.75 M.

So, in 1 L of concentrated acid, moles of H2SO4 = 3.75 mol.

Mass = 3.75 × 98.079 ≈ 367.8 g.

But wait, the density of the concentrated acid is 1.21 g/cc. So 1 L (1000 cc) of concentrated acid has mass 1.21 ×1000 = 1210 g.

So, the mass of H2SO4 in 1 L of concentrated acid is 367.8 g, but the total solution is 1210 g. So the grams per liter (g/L) of H2SO4 in the concentrated acid is 367.8 g/L.

Wait, but wait, when I calculate the molarity as 3.75 M, that would give (3.75 mol/L) ×98.079 g/mol ≈ 367.8 g/L, which is correct.

So the concentrated acid's strength is approximately 367.8 g/L. Looking at the options, option A says 1210 g/L for the concentrated acid, which seems way too high because 1.21 g/cc ×1000 cc/L=1210 g/L is the total solution mass, not the mass of H2SO4.

Ah, so the strength in grams per liter refers to the mass of the solute, H2SO4, not the solution's mass. So the concentrated acid's H2SO4 strength is around 367.8 g/L, and the diluted solution's H2SO4 strength would be less.

Wait, but the options don't have 367.8 g/L. Let me check option A: 1210 g/l for concentrated. That's the total mass of the solution, not the solute. So perhaps the question is asking for the solution's mass, but that doesn't make sense because grams per liter usually refers to the solute.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

"What is the normality of the diluted acid? What is its strength in grams per liter? What is the strength of the undiluted 1.21 density acid in g/l?"

Ah, so "grams per liter" here refers to the solution's mass, not the solute. That is, the density ×1000. For the concentrated acid, density is 1.21 g/cc, so 1.21 ×1000 = 1210 g/L. That's option A's third value.

Wait, but the first part is normality of diluted acid, which we found as 0.75 N. The second part is the strength of the diluted acid in g/L, which would be the mass of the solution, 100 cc × density. But we don't know the density of the diluted solution. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, the problem doesn't provide the density of the diluted solution, only the concentrated acid's density. So perhaps the grams per liter for the diluted solution refers to the mass of H2SO4 in the solution, not the solution's mass.

Wait, but without the density of the diluted solution, I can't directly calculate its mass. But we can calculate the concentration of H2SO4 in the diluted solution and then convert that to grams per liter.

Wait, the diluted solution is 0.75 N. So, molarity M = 0.75 /2 = 0.375 M.

In 1 L (1000 cc), moles of H2SO4 = 0.375 ×1 = 0.375 mol.

Mass = 0.375 ×98.079 ≈ 36.8 g/L.

So the diluted solution has 36.8 g/L of H2SO4. But looking at the options, the second value (diluted strength) is around 120 g/L, which doesn't match. So I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the solution's mass in grams per liter, which would be the density ×1000. But since the diluted solution's density isn't given, I can't calculate it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration in terms of weight percent or another measure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of the diluted solution in grams per liter of H2SO4, given that the diluted solution is 100 cc, and we know the normality.

Wait, using the normality of 0.75 N for the diluted solution, which is H2SO4.

In 100 cc (0.1 L) of diluted solution, equivalents = 0.75 ×0.1 =0.075 eq.

Each eq is 1 mole of H+ per eq, but for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 eq. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.075 /2 = 0.0375 mol.

Mass of H2SO4 = 0.0375 ×98.079 ≈3.68 g in 100 cc, so 36.8 g/L.

But none of the options have this. Let me check the options again:

Option A: 0.75 N, 121 g/l, 1210 g/l

Option E: 0.5 N, 120 g/l, 1200 g/l

Hmm, 121 g/L is close to 120, but perhaps my calculation is off due to rounding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the strength of the diluted solution as the mass of the solution, not the solute. Since the diluted solution is 100 cc, and assuming it has a density similar to water, say around 1.0 g/cc, then 100 cc would be 100 g, so 100 g/L. But that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the diluted solution's concentration based on the initial concentrated solution's properties without considering the dilution's effect on density. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering the solution's molarity and then grams per liter.

Wait, the diluted solution is 0.75 N, which is 0.375 M (since 0.75/2 =0.375).

So in 1 L, moles =0.375 ×1 =0.375 mol.

Mass =0.375 ×98.079 ≈36.8 g.

So 36.8 g/L of H2SO4 in the diluted solution.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is referring to the solution's mass in grams per liter, which would require knowing its density.

Wait, but the problem only gives the density of the concentrated acid. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is considering the diluted solution's strength as the mass of sulfuric acid in the diluted solution, calculated based on the dilution.

Wait, the concentrated solution is 10 cc, 1.21 g/cc, so 12.1 grams of solution. When diluted to 100 cc, the mass of H2SO4 remains the same, 12.1 grams. Wait, no, because when you dilute, you're adding more solvent, so the mass of H2SO4 doesn't change, but the solution's volume increases.

Wait, no, wait. The 10 cc of concentrated acid contains 12.1 grams of solution. When you dilute it to 100 cc, the mass of H2SO4 remains 12.1 grams, but the solution's volume is 100 cc. So the concentration of H2SO4 in the diluted solution is 12.1 grams in 100 cc, which is 121 g/L (since 100 cc is 0.1 L, 12.1 g /0.1 L=121 g/L).

Wait, that makes sense. So the diluted solution's strength in grams per liter is 121 g/L.

Ah, so that's the second value in the options. So option A has 0.75 N, 121 g/L, and 1210 g/L for the concentrated acid.

Wait, the concentrated acid's strength in g/L is its density ×1000. Since density is 1.21 g/cc, 1.21 ×1000 =1210 g/L. That matches option A's third value.

So putting it all together:

- Normality of diluted acid: 0.75 N.

- Strength of diluted acid in g/L: 121 g/L (since 12.1 g in 100 cc → 121 g/L).

- Strength of concentrated acid in g/L: 1210 g/L.

Which matches option A.
</think>

The problem involves determining the normality of the diluted sulfuric acid, its strength in grams per liter, and the strength of the undiluted acid. Here's the analysis:

1. **Normality of the Diluted Acid**:  
   The diluted acid (30 cc) neutralizes 45 cc of 0.5 N NaOH.  
   Equivalents of NaOH = \( 0.5 \, \text{N} \times 45 \, \text{cc} = 22.5 \, \text{eq} \).  
   Since \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \) is diprotic, the equivalents of acid in 30 cc are also \( 22.5 \, \text{eq} \).  
   Normality of diluted acid = \( \frac{22.5 \, \text{eq}}{30 \, \text{cc}} = 0.75 \, \text{N} \).

2. **Strength of Diluted Acid in g/L**:  
   The diluted solution is \( 100 \, \text{cc} \), made from \( 10 \, \text{cc} \) of concentrated acid. The concentrated acid has a density of \( 1.21 \, \text{g/cc} \), so \( 10 \, \text{cc} \) weighs \( 12.1 \, \text{g} \).  
   In \( 100 \, \text{cc} \), the mass of \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \) remains \( 12.1 \, \text{g} \).  
   Strength in g/L = \( \frac{12.1 \, \text{g}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 121 \, \text{g/L} \).

3. **Strength of Undiluted Acid in g/L**:  
   The undiluted acid has a density of \( 1.21 \, \text{g/cc} \).  
   Strength in g/L = \( 1.21 \, \text{g/cc} \times 1000 \, \text{cc/L} = 1210 \, \text{g/L} \).

The values match **Option A**: \( 0.75 \, \text{N}, 121 \, \text{g/L}, 1210 \, \text{g/L} \).

**Answer:** A
