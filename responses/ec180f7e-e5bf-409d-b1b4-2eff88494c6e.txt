Okay, so I've got this question about field extensions, and I need to find the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q. Hmm, I remember that field extensions involve the degree being the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the smaller one. So, the degree [Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) : Q] is what I'm looking for.

Wait, but sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) is the same as sqrt(6), right? Because sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) is sqrt(ab) when a and b are non-negative. So the field Q(sqrt(6)) is the same as Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)). That might simplify things.

Now, I recall that the degree of a field extension Q(sqrt(d)) over Q, where d is a square-free integer, is 2 if d isn't a square in Q. Since 6 is square-free and not a square in Q, the degree [Q(sqrt(6)) : Q] should be 2. So is the answer 2? That would be option I.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Because sometimes when you have multiple square roots, the degree can be higher. Like, for example, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q has degree 4, because each sqrt adds a degree of 2, and they're independent. But in this case, the field is just Q(sqrt(6)), not the compositum of Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)).

Wait, so I'm a bit confused. Am I considering the compositum or just the single extension? The question says Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)), which is the same as Q(sqrt(6)). So it's a simple quadratic extension, right? So the degree should be 2.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q. The minimal polynomial is x^2 - 6, which is irreducible over Q because 6 isn't a square. So the minimal polynomial has degree 2, which means the extension degree is 2. So yes, the answer should be 2. So option I is correct.

The field extension in question is Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q, which simplifies to Q(sqrt(6)). The minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q is xÂ² - 6, which is irreducible, giving the degree as 2.
