Question:

A state law provides for an award of damages against anyone who publishes the name of a rape victim. Pursuant to that law, a woman sued a local newspaper in state court after the newspaper identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected the claim, holding that the state law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The state supreme court affirmed, holding specifically: "We think that this well-intentioned law very likely violates the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. We need not, however, decide that issue, because the law assuredly violates our state constitution, which provides even greater protection to the right of the press to report the news." The woman petitioned for review in the U.S. Supreme Court. Is the U.S. Supreme Court likely to review the state supreme court judgment?

Options:

A: No, because the woman already had the opportunity to present her case in the state courts.
B: No, because the First Amendment prohibits the imposition of liability for the publication of truthful information.
C: Yes, because the state supreme court made a constitutional error in its judgment.
D: No, because the U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review cases involving state laws.
E: No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.
F: Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to review decisions of state supreme courts.
G: No, because the state supreme court's judgment was based on its interpretation of its own state's constitution.
H: Yes, because the First Amendment rights of the press are at stake.
I: Yes, because the supremacy clause does not permit a state to create rights greater than those conferred by the federal Constitution.
J: Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to cases arising under federal law.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to review the state supreme court's judgment in this case. Let's break down the question step by step.

First, the scenario: A state law allows damages against those who publish a rape victim's name. The woman sued the newspaper, but the state courts rejected her claim, saying the law is unconstitutional under both the state constitution and the First Amendment. The state supreme court affirmed, but they specifically held that the state law violates their state constitution, which provides greater protection than the First Amendment. They didn't need to decide on the federal issue because the state issue was sufficient.

Now, the woman is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court. The question is whether the Court is likely to review this. I remember that the Supreme Court typically reviews cases under certain conditions, mainly when there's a federal question, and the case meets the criteria of a "jurisdictional statement" under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1257 or when it's a question of justiciability.

Looking at the options, let's consider the possible answers. The key here is whether the state court's decision rested on an independent and adequate state ground. If a state court decides a case on state law grounds without addressing the federal issue, the Supreme Court usually won't review it because there's no federal question left. This is known as the "independent state ground doctrine."

In the case here, the state supreme court said, "We think that this well-intentioned law very likely violates the First Amendment... We need not, however, decide that issue, because the law assuredly violates our state constitution, which provides even greater protection..." So they decided the case based solely on the state constitution, without resolving the federal First Amendment issue. 

This means the state court's judgment rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground. Therefore, the U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to review it because the decision doesn't present a live federal issue. The woman can't bring a federal claim if the state court didn't address it and the issue is no longer in play.

Looking at the options, option E says: "No, because the U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review cases involving state laws." But wait, that's not entirely accurate because the Supreme Court does review state cases if they involve federal questions. However, if the state court's decision is based on state law, the Court won't interfere.

Option E is more about the general principle, but the specific reason here is that the state court's judgment rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground. So looking at the options, option E is correct because it points out that the judgment is based on state law, making the Supreme Court less likely to review it.

Wait, but option E says "No, because the U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review cases involving state laws." That's not entirely precise because the Court does review state cases if they involve federal law. However, in this case, the state court didn't reach the federal issue because they decided it on state grounds. So the federal question isn't properly presented because the state court didn't resolve it. Therefore, the Supreme Court won't review it because the state's decision was based on state law, not the federal issue.

So the correct answer should be E: No, because the judgment rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground.

Wait, looking back at the options, option E is "No, because the U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review cases involving state laws." Hmm, but the Supreme Court does review state cases when there's a federal question. So the more accurate reason is that the state court's decision was based on state law, making the federal issue not reviewable. So perhaps the correct option is E, but I'm a bit confused because another option might fit better.

Wait, looking at option E again: "No, because the U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review cases involving state laws." That's not correct because the Court does review state cases when they involve federal issues. However, in this case, since the state court decided on state grounds, the federal issue isn't properly presented. So the correct reason is that the state court's judgment rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground, which would mean the Supreme Court doesn't have jurisdiction. 

So the correct option is E? Or maybe another option. Let me check the options again.

Option E: No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.

Wait, yes, that's exactly the point. The state court's decision was based on the state constitution, so the federal issue wasn't decided. Therefore, the Supreme Court is unlikely to review it because the decision rests on an adequate state ground. So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to review the state supreme court's judgment because the state court decided the case based on its own state constitution, which provides an adequate and independent state-law ground. This means the federal issue under the First Amendment was not addressed, and the Supreme Court generally does not interfere with state decisions that are based on state law. 

Answer: E
