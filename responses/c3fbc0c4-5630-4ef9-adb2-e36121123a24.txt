Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the effect on the number of collisions between A and B when their concentrations are changed. The reaction is A + B → C + D. There are two parts: part (a) where the concentration of each is tripled, and part (b) where each is quadrupled. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that the rate of a reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants. The rate law is usually expressed as rate = k[A]^m [B]^n, where m and n are the orders with respect to A and B, respectively. But wait, this question is specifically about the number of collisions between A and B. How does that relate?

I think the number of collisions would depend on the concentrations of both A and B. If both concentrations increase, the frequency of collisions should increase. But how exactly? Let me think. If you have more molecules of A and B, each moving around, the chance that they'll collide should go up. But by how much?

I recall that when the concentration of a reactant is increased, the number of collisions increases proportionally. But since both A and B are involved, I think their concentrations multiply. Because each molecule of A can collide with each molecule of B. So if [A] increases by a factor and [B] increases by another factor, the total collisions would increase by the product of those factors.

Let me test this. Suppose originally, [A] is a and [B] is b. The number of collisions would be proportional to a * b. Now, in part (a), both are tripled. So new [A] is 3a, [B] is 3b. The new collision rate would be 3a * 3b = 9ab. So that's 9 times the original. Wait, but the question is about the number of collisions between A and B. So yeah, 9 times.

Wait, but wait. The question says, what is the effect on the number of collisions between A and B. So when both concentrations are tripled, the number of collisions becomes 3 * 3 = 9 times the original. Similarly, when both are quadrupled, 4 * 4 = 16 times.

So looking at the options, for part (a) it's 9 times and part (b) 16 times. So the options: D is 9 and 16. Let me check the options.

Options:
A: 18,32
B:6,12
C:6,8
D:9,16
E:15,24
F:12,20
G:9,12
H:7,10
I:27,64
J:3,4

So D is 9 and 16, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, the rate depends on the sum of orders. Like, if the reaction is first order in each, the rate would be proportional to [A][B]. But collisions would also depend on both concentrations. So yeah, tripling each would give 3*3=9 times as many collisions. Quadrupling each would be 4*4=16 times. So yes, D is correct.

The number of collisions between A and B depends on the product of their concentrations. When each concentration is tripled, the number of collisions increases by a factor of 3 × 3 = 9. When each concentration is quadrupled, the number of collisions increases by a factor of 4 × 4 = 16. Among the options, D matches these values.

Answer: D
