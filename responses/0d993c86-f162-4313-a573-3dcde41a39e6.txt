Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Homo habilis and Homo erectus. The question is asking what gave Homo erectus the ability to migrate so far and so fast compared to Homo habilis. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should probably recall what I know about these two species. Homo habilis is one of the earliest human ancestors, known for being the first to use tools, right? They lived around 2.5 million to 1.5 million years ago. On the other hand, Homo erectus appeared around 1.9 million years ago and is known for being the first hominid to migrate out of Africa. So, they were more successful in migrating, but why?

Looking at the options:

A: Microcephaly – that's a condition where the brain is smaller than usual. I don't think that's it because having a smaller brain wouldn't help with migrating.

B: Larger brain size – Homo erectus did have a larger brain compared to habilis. A bigger brain might mean better problem-solving skills, which could help in migrating.

C: Ability to swim – I'm not sure if swimming ability is linked to migration over land. Migration usually refers to moving across land, so maybe this isn't the main factor.

D: Ability to communicate – Better communication could help in social structures, but I'm not sure if that's the key reason for faster migration.

E: Stronger muscles – Maybe, but I think the key difference was more about cognitive abilities than just physical strength.

F: Enhanced vision – Better eyesight might help in navigating, but I'm not certain it's the main factor for migration speed.

G: Neoteny – That's about retaining juvenile traits into adulthood. Not sure how that ties into migration.

H: Longer lifespan – A longer lifespan could mean more time to migrate, but I think the question is more about ability rather than time.

I: Bipedalism – Both species were bipedal, so that can't be the difference.

J: Intelligence – Intelligence is related to problem-solving and tool use. Homo erectus was more advanced, which would help in migration.

Wait, but I also remember that Homo erectus had a bigger brain, which would contribute to higher intelligence. So maybe B and J are both possible. But the question is about what gave them the ability to migrate so far and fast. Intelligence would allow them to plan, use tools, and adapt better, which would aid migration. But a larger brain size directly supports that intelligence.

Alternatively, maybe it's the combination of both, but the options are separate. So perhaps the answer is B: larger brain size, which enabled increased intelligence and problem-solving, allowing them to migrate more effectively.

Another point: Homo erectus used more advanced tools, like Acheulean tools, which required planning and skill. That suggests a larger brain and thus more intelligence. So I'm leaning towards B and J being related, but the options are separate. The question is about the ability to migrate, so perhaps the larger brain size was the key factor.

Wait, another thought: migration over long distances might require better navigation skills and the ability to adapt to new environments, which a larger brain would support. So B seems correct.

The ability of Homo erectus to migrate farther and faster compared to Homo habilis is attributed to their larger brain size. This larger brain facilitated greater intelligence, problem-solving skills, and adaptability, which were crucial for successful migration. 

Answer: B
