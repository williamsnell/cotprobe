Okay, so I've got this problem about the normalized power of a periodic signal. The question asks for the ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the normalized power of a signal is calculated using the formula S = sum from n=-infty to +infty of V_n times V_n conjugate. Since V_n is given as [1 / |n|] e^{-j arctan(n/2)} for n = ±1, ±2, etc., I think I need to find the individual powers for the first and second harmonics.

Wait, the first harmonic would be n=1 and n=-1, and the second harmonic would be n=2 and n=-2. But since power is the sum of V_n times V_n*, which is the magnitude squared, I think each V_n contributes |V_n|². So for each harmonic, I need to calculate the magnitude squared and then sum them for both the positive and negative n.

Let's start with the first harmonic, n=1. V_1 is [1/1] e^{-j arctan(1/2)}. The magnitude of that is just 1, because the exponential term has magnitude 1. So |V_1|² is 1² = 1. Similarly, for n=-1, V_{-1} is [1/1] e^{-j arctan(-1/2)}, but the magnitude is still 1. So the total power for the first harmonic is 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the normalized power for the first harmonic would be the sum of |V_1|² and |V_{-1}|², right? Because each harmonic contributes to the total. So 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, wait. The normalized power S is the sum over all n of |V_n|². So each harmonic is a pair of n and -n, so each contributes 2|V_n|². So for n=1, |V_1|² is (1/|1|)^2 = 1. So the first harmonic's contribution is 2*1 = 2.

Similarly, for the second harmonic, n=2 and n=-2. V_2 is [1/2] e^{-j arctan(2/2)} = (1/2) e^{-j arctan(1)}, which simplifies to (1/2)(cos(-π/4) + j sin(-π/4)) because arctan(1) is π/4. Wait, no, arctan(1) is π/4, so the exponent is -j π/4. The magnitude of V_2 is 1/2, so |V_2|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the second harmonic's contribution is 2*(1/4) = 1/2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first. So that would be (1/2) divided by 2, which is (1/2) / 2 = 1/4, which is 0.25. Wait, but let me double-check that.

Wait, no. Wait, the normalized power S is the sum of all |V_n|², but when we're looking at each harmonic, the first harmonic is n=1 and n=-1, each contributing 1. So the power for first harmonic is 2*(1) = 2? Or wait, no, no. Wait, the formula is S = sum V_n V_n*, which is the same as sum |V_n|². So for each n, |V_n|² is (1/|n|)^2 because V_n = (1/|n|) e^{-j...}, so the magnitude is 1/|n|. So |V_n|² is 1/(n²).

So for n=1, |V_1|² = 1. For n=-1, same thing, so each contributes 1, totaling 2 for n=±1. For n=2, |V_2|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, n=-2 contributes another 1/4, so total for second harmonic is 1/4 +1/4 = 1/2. 

So the question is asking for the ratio of the second harmonic's power to the first harmonic's power. So that's (1/2) divided by 2, which is (0.5)/(2) = 0.25. So the ratio is 0.25, which corresponds to option I.

Wait, but let me check again. The first harmonic's normalized power is sum |V_1|² + |V_{-1}|² = 1 + 1 = 2. The second harmonic's is 1/4 + 1/4 = 0.5. So 0.5 divided by 2 is 0.25. That's correct.

So the answer should be I: 0.25.
</think>

The normalized power for each harmonic is calculated by summing the squared magnitudes of the corresponding Vₙ terms. For the first harmonic (n=±1), each |V₁|² is 1, so the total power is 2. For the second harmonic (n=±2), each |V₂|² is 1/4, so the total power is 0.5. The ratio of the second harmonic's power to the first is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25.
