Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again: "If two modern organisms are distantly related in an evolutionary sense, then one should expect that..." The options are from A to J.

Hmm, the question is about evolutionary relationships and what we can expect between two organisms that are distantly related. I remember that in evolution, distant relationships mean they share a common ancestor, but that ancestor lived a long time ago. So, their lineages diverged much earlier compared to more closely related species.

Let me think about each option:

A: Their rate of mutation should be identical. I don't think that's right. Mutation rates can vary based on various factors like environment, genetic makeup, etc. So, it's unlikely that two distantly related organisms would have the same mutation rate. Plus, mutation rates aren't the main factor here; it's more about their shared history.

B: They should have the exact same DNA structure. That seems too extreme. Even closely related organisms have some differences. Distantly related ones would have more differences, so this is probably not correct.

C: They should have identical physical characteristics. No, that's not right either. Even close relatives have some differences, so distant ones would definitely not be identical. For example, a human and a shark aren't identical in any way.

D: They should share the same number of chromosomes. I'm not sure about this. Some organisms have different chromosome numbers due to rearrangements over time. For example, humans have 46, while some other mammals might have different numbers, but I'm not sure if this is a given for distant relatives. Maybe not the best choice.

E: They live in very different habitats. While it's possible, it's not necessarily the case. Distant relatives could live in similar environments if they adapted similarly, but it's not a guaranteed outcome. So, this might not be the correct answer.

F: Their chromosomes should be very similar. Hmm, if they're distantly related, their chromosomes might not be very similar. Chromosome structure can change a lot over time, like through inversions, translocations, etc. So, this might not be right either.

G: They shared a common ancestor relatively recently. Wait, no. If they're distantly related, their common ancestor was long ago, not recent. So G is incorrect.

H: They should share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related organisms. Yes, that makes sense. Homologous structures are features inherited from a common ancestor. If two organisms are distant, they might have fewer of these compared to closer relatives. For example, a mouse and a human (close) share more homologous structures than a mouse and a shark (distant).

I: They should share more homologous structures than two more closely related organisms. No, the opposite of H. Since they're distant, they'd share fewer, so I is wrong.

J: They both evolve at the same rate. I don't think the rate of evolution is tied to how related they are. Some species evolve faster, others slower, regardless of their relation.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be H. Distantly related organisms share fewer homologous structures compared to those more closely related.

The correct answer is H. Distantly related organisms share fewer homologous structures compared to more closely related ones.
