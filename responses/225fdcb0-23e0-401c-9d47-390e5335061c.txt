Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the inverse z-transform of F(z) = (2z² - 2z) / [(z - 3)(z - 5)²] using partial fraction expansion. Hmm, partial fractions, right. I remember that's a method to decompose complex rational functions into simpler ones that are easier to invert.

First, I should express F(z) as a sum of simpler fractions. The denominator factors are (z - 3) and (z -5) squared, so I expect the partial fraction decomposition to have terms like A/(z-3) and B/(z-5) plus another term for the squared term, maybe C/(z-5)². Wait, no, actually, for repeated factors, the decomposition is usually A/(z-5) + B/(z-5)². So the general form should be F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)².

Wait, but I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. The denominator is (z-3)(z-5)^2, so the partial fractions should be of the form A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2. Yes, that's right. So I can write F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

Now I need to find the constants A, B, and C. To do that, I'll combine these terms over a common denominator and equate the numerator with the original F(z).

So, F(z) = [A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3)] / [(z-3)(z-5)^2].

The numerator must equal 2z² - 2z. So expanding the numerator:

A(z² -10z +25) + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3) = 2z² -2z.

Let me expand each term:

A(z² -10z +25) = A z² -10A z +25A.

B(z-3)(z-5) = B(z² -8z +15) = B z² -8B z +15B.

C(z-3) = Cz -3C.

Now, summing all these terms:

(A + B) z² + (-10A -8B + C) z + (25A +15B -3C).

Set this equal to 2z² -2z +0.

So, the coefficients must satisfy:

1. A + B = 2 (coefficient of z²)
2. -10A -8B + C = -2 (coefficient of z)
3. 25A +15B -3C = 0 (constant term)

Now I have a system of three equations:

1. A + B = 2
2. -10A -8B + C = -2
3. 25A +15B -3C = 0

I'll solve this step by step.

From equation 1: B = 2 - A.

Substitute B into equations 2 and 3.

Equation 2 becomes:

-10A -8(2 - A) + C = -2
-10A -16 +8A + C = -2
(-10A +8A) = -2A
So, -2A -16 + C = -2
Then, rearranged: C = 2A +14.

Now equation 3:

25A +15(2 - A) -3C =0
25A +30 -15A -3C =0
(25A -15A) =10A
So, 10A +30 -3C =0
Which is 10A +30 =3C
Divide both sides by 3: (10A +30)/3 = C → (10A +30)/3 = C.

But from earlier, C=2A +14. So set them equal:

2A +14 = (10A +30)/3.

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominator:

3(2A +14) =10A +30 →6A +42 =10A +30.

Bring variables to one side:

6A +42 -10A -30 =0 → -4A +12=0 → -4A =-12 → A=3.

Now, from equation 1: B=2 -A =2-3= -1.

From C=2A +14 =2*3 +14=6+14=20.

So A=3, B=-1, C=20.

Now, F(z) can be written as:

F(z) = 3/(z-3) -1/(z-5) +20/(z-5)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the partial fraction expansion. Wait, original F(z) is (2z^2-2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2], so after partial fractions, F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2. So yes, A=3, B=-1, C=20.

Now, I need to find the inverse z-transform of each term.

The inverse z-transform of 1/(z - a) is a^n u[n], right? Because 1/(z - a) = z^{-1} * 1/(1 - a z^{-1}) ), and the z-transform of a^n u[n] is 1/(1 - a z^{-1}) ), so the inverse would be a^n u[n].

So:

- The inverse of 3/(z-3) is 3*3^n u[n] =3^{n+1} u[n], since 3/(z-3)=3 * (1/(z-3)) → inverse is 3*3^n u[n] =3^{n+1} u[n].

Wait, wait, let me think again. 1/(z - a) has inverse a^n u[n]. So, 3/(z-3) is 3 * [1/(z-3)], so the inverse is 3 * (3^n u[n])=3^{n+1} u[n].

Similarly, -1/(z-5) has inverse -5^n u[n].

Now, the term 20/(z-5)^2. The inverse z-transform of 1/(z - a)^2 is n a^{n-1} u[n]. Because the transform of n a^{n-1} u[n] is 1/(z - a)^2. So 20/(z-5)^2 would have inverse 20 * n *5^{n-1} u[n}.

So putting it all together:

f[n] =3^{n+1} u[n] -5^n u[n] +20 n 5^{n-1} u[n].

Wait, let me compute each term separately.

Wait, 3/(z-3) → 3 * 3^n u[n] =3^{n+1} u[n].

-1/(z-5) → -5^n u[n].

20/(z-5)^2 → 20 * n 5^{n-1} u[n}.

So f[n] =3^{n+1} u[n] -5^n u[n] +20 n 5^{n-1} u[n}.

Hmm, let me simplify this expression.

First, 3^{n+1} is 3*3^n, so that's a term.

Then, the other terms involve 5^n and 5^{n-1}.

Let's factor out 5^{n-1} from the terms involving 5.

So:

-5^n = -5 *5^{n-1}.

So the terms become:

-5*5^{n-1} +20n5^{n-1} = [ -5 +20n ]5^{n-1}.

Factor 5^{n-1}.

So f[n] =3^{n+1} u[n] + [20n -5] 5^{n-1} u[n}.

Let me see if I can simplify [20n -5]5^{n-1}.

Factor 5 out of the bracket:

5*(4n -1) *5^{n-1} =5^{n} (4n -1).

Wait, 5*(4n-1)=20n -5, yes.

So [20n -5]5^{n-1} = (20n -5)5^{n-1} =5*(4n-1) *5^{n-1} = (4n-1)5^{n}.

Wait, no, because 5^{n-1} multiplied by 5 is 5^{n}.

So [20n -5]5^{n-1} = (4n -1)5^{n}.

Putting it all together:

f[n] =3^{n+1} u[n] + (4n -1)5^{n} u[n}.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see this exact form. Let me check the options again.

Option C is f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n] -5^n u[n], which is part of what I have, but I also have the (4n -1)5^n term, so it's more than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the partial fraction decomposition.

Wait, when I set up the equations earlier, I might have made a mistake in expanding the numerator. Let me check the expansion again.

I had F(z) = [A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3)] / denominator.

Expanding numerator:

A(z^2 -10z +25) + B(z^2 -8z +15) + C(z -3).

So:

A z² -10A z +25A +B z² -8B z +15B +C z -3C.

Combine like terms:

(A + B) z² + (-10A -8B + C) z + (25A +15B -3C).

Set equal to 2z² -2z +0.

So,

A + B = 2,

-10A -8B + C = -2,

25A +15B -3C =0.

We solved and found A=3, B=-1, C=20.

Wait, let me plug these back into the numerator to check.

A=3, B=-1, C=20.

Numerator:

3(z-5)^2 + (-1)(z-3)(z-5) +20(z-3).

Expanding:

3(z²-10z+25) + (-1)(z²-8z+15) +20z -60.

Compute each term:

3z² -30z +75,

- z² +8z -15,

+20z -60.

Add them up:

3z² -30z +75 -z² +8z -15 +20z -60.

Combine like terms:

(3z² -z²) = 2z²,

(-30z +8z +20z) = (-30z +28z) =-2z,

(75 -15 -60)=0.

Yes, that gives 2z² -2z, which matches F(z). So the partial fractions are correct.

So back to the inverse transform. F(z) =3/(z-3) -1/(z-5) +20/(z-5)^2.

Inverse of 3/(z-3): 3 * 3^n u[n] =3^{n+1} u[n}.

Inverse of -1/(z-5): -5^n u[n}.

Inverse of 20/(z-5)^2: 20 * n 5^{n-1} u[n}.

So f[n]=3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +20 n 5^{n-1} u[n}.

Now, let me see if I can simplify this expression.

Express 20 n 5^{n-1} as (20/5) n 5^{n} =4 n 5^{n}.

Because 5^{n-1}=5^{n}/5. So 20 * (n *5^{n}/5) =4n 5^{n}.

So now, f[n] =3^{n+1} u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n 5^{n} u[n}.

Factor out 5^n u[n} from the last two terms:

=3^{n+1} u[n} +5^n u[n} ( -1 +4n ).

So f[n] =3^{n+1} u[n} + (4n -1)5^n u[n}.

Hmm. Now looking at the options, none exactly match this, but perhaps there's a way to write it differently.

Wait, option C is f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n] -5^n u[n}, which is part of what we have, but we also have the (4n-1)5^n term, which isn't present in option C. So perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach, like plugging in specific z values to find A, B, C more quickly.

For example, to find A, I can set z=3.

F(3) = (2*(3)^2 -2*3) / [(3-3)(3-5)^2} → denominator is zero, but we can compute the limit as z approaches 3.

Alternatively, since F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2,

Multiply both sides by (z-3)(z-5)^2 and set z=3:

A*(3-5)^2 + B*(3-3)(3-5) + C*(3-3) = numerator evaluated at z=3.

So numerator at z=3 is 2*(9) -2*(3) =18-6=12.

So 12 = A*( (-2)^2 ) + 0 +0 → 12=4A → A=3. Which matches our earlier result.

Similarly, set z=5 to find C:

Multiply both sides by (z-3)(z-5)^2 and set z=5:

A*(5-5)^2 + B*(5-3)(5-5) + C*(5-3) = numerator evaluated at z=5.

Numerator at z=5: 2*(25) -2*(5)=50-10=40.

So 40 =0 +0 +2C → C=20. Correct.

Now, to find B, use any other value, like z=0.

F(0) = (0 -0)/[(0-3)(0-5)^2] =0/(-3)(25)=0.

On the partial fractions side:

A/(0-3) + B/(0-5) + C/(0-5)^2 = (A/(-3)) + B/(-5) + C/(25).

Set equal to 0:

(-A/3) - B/5 + C/25 =0.

We know A=3, C=20 → plug in:

(-3/3) - B/5 +20/25 = (-1) - B/5 + 0.8 = (-1 +0.8) - B/5 = (-0.2) - B/5 =0 → -0.2 - B/5 =0 → B/5 = -0.2 → B= -1. Correct.

So, the partial fractions are correct. Now, the inverse transform:

f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +20n5^{n-1}u[n}.

Wait, perhaps I can express 20n5^{n-1} as (4n)5^{n} - something. Let me see:

20n5^{n-1} = (20/5) n5^{n} =4n5^{n}.

So f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^n u[n}.

Which can be rewritten as:

3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^n u[n}.

Looking at the options, I don't see this exact expression. Let me check each option.

Option C: f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}. It's missing the (4n -1)5^n term, so that's not the same.

Option D: f[n] =3n u[n} + [(5/4)n -1] (4/5)^n u[n}.

No, that doesn't match.

Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial F(z) is (2z² -2z)/(z-3)(z-5)^2.

I can factor numerator: 2z(z -1). But not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the partial fraction expansion might have different coefficients. Wait, maybe I should use a different method, like polynomial division or another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express F(z) as 2z(z-1)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

Wait, perhaps I can perform the partial fractions differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the cover-up method for A, B, C.

Wait, I already did that, and the values are correct. So perhaps I need to re-express f[n} correctly.

Wait, let me think about the inverse transform again.

The term 20/(z-5)^2: inverse is 20 *n 5^{n-1} u[n}.

So 20n5^{n-1} = (20/5) n5^{n} =4n5^{n}.

So f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^{n}u[n}.

Which can be written as f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Wait, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.

Option C is f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

But according to my calculation, f[n} has an extra term 4n5^{n}u[n}.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the partial fractions. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should write F(z) as (2z² -2z) = (2z² -2z) =2z(z-1), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should perform the partial fractions correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion.

Wait, another approach: let me compute F(z) as:

F(z) = (2z² -2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2} = [2z(z-1)] / (z-3)(z-5)^2.

But perhaps that's not helpful. Let me try another method: express F(z) as A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I can write F(z) as:

F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

Then, when I combine, the numerator is A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3).

Wait, perhaps I can pick a different value for z to simplify. For example, set z=5 to find C.

As done before, F(5) is (2*25 -10)/(0 * ... )=40/0, but via partial fractions, it's C(z-3) evaluated at z=5: C*(5-3)=2C. So 2C=40 → C=20, which is correct.

Similarly, when z=3, the numerator is 12, so A*(3-5)^2=4A=12 → A=3.

Then for B, using z=0, as before, gives B=-1.

So the partial fractions are correct.

Therefore, the inverse transform should be f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^{n}u[n}.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: f[n] =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

Option A: f[n} =4n u[n} + [(5/6)n -1]6^n u[n}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse transform of 20/(z-5)^2.

Wait, the inverse z-transform of 1/(z - a)^2 is n a^{n-1} u[n}. So 20/(z-5)^2 has inverse 20 *n 5^{n-1} u[n}.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the expression differently.

f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Wait, 3^{n+1} is 3*3^n. So f[n} =3*3^n u[n} + (4n -1)5^n u[n}.

Is there any option that has terms with 3^n and 5^n?

Looking at the options:

Option C: f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

But that's only part of the expression I have. So perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions, perhaps the signs are incorrect.

Wait, let me re-express f[n} again.

f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^{n}u[n}.

Which can be written as f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out 5^{n} from the last two terms.

Wait, 3^{n+1}u[n} +5^{n}u[n}*(4n -1).

But I don't see any option that combines these terms. Let me check the options again.

Option D: f[n} =3n u[n} + [(5/4)n -1] (4/5)^n u[n}.

No, that's different.

Option A: f[n} =4n u[n} + [(5/6)n -1]6^n u[n}.

No.

Option I: f[n} =5n u[n} + [(6/7)n -1]7^n u[n}.

No.

Option H: f[n} =2n u[n} + [(3/5)n -1]4^n u[n}.

No.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions. Let me try solving the system of equations again.

We had:

1. A + B =2,

2. -10A -8B + C = -2,

3.25A +15B -3C =0.

From equation 1: B=2 -A.

Substitute into equation 2:

-10A -8(2 -A) + C =-2 → -10A -16 +8A + C =-2 → (-2A) -16 + C =-2 → C=2A +14.

Equation 3:

25A +15(2 -A) -3C =0 →25A +30 -15A -3C=0 →10A +30 -3C=0 →3C=10A +30 →C=(10A +30)/3.

But C=2A +14, so:

2A +14 = (10A +30)/3 → multiply both sides by 3:

6A +42 =10A +30 →6A +42 -10A -30 =0 →-4A +12=0 →-4A =-12 →A=3.

Then B=2-3=-1, C=2*3 +14=6+14=20. So the partial fractions are correct.

So I must have made a mistake in the inverse transform. Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the term correctly.

Wait, the inverse z-transform of 1/(z - a)^2 is n a^{n-1} u[n}. So 20/(z -5)^2 →20 *n 5^{n-1} u[n}.

Yes, that's correct. So f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +20n5^{n-1}u[n}.

Wait, perhaps I can write 20n5^{n-1} as 4n5^{n} - something.

Wait, 20n5^{n-1} = (20/5) n5^{n} =4n5^{n}.

So f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^{n}u[n}.

Which can be rewritten as f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Hmm, again, none of the options match this. Maybe I should look for an option that combines 3^{n+1} and terms with 5^{n}.

Looking at option C: f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

But according to my calculation, f[n} includes an additional 4n5^{n}u[n} term. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, maybe I should check the initial problem again.

The given F(z) is (2z² -2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

Wait, perhaps I should factor numerator and denominator correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should perform polynomial division if the degree of numerator is higher than denominator, but in this case, numerator is degree 2, denominator is (z-3)(z-5)^2 which is also degree 3, so F(z) is a proper fraction, no need for division.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for an option that has 3^{n+1} and 5^{n} terms.

Looking back, option C is f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions, maybe the coefficient for the (z-5)^2 term is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach to find the inverse transform. Let me consider the inverse transform of each term again.

After partial fractions, F(z) =3/(z-3) -1/(z-5) +20/(z-5)^2.

Inverse transform:

3/(z-3) →3*3^n u[n}=3^{n+1}u[n}.

-1/(z-5) →-5^n u[n}.

20/(z-5)^2 →20 *n5^{n-1}u[n}.

So f[n}=3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +20n5^{n-1}u[n}.

Wait, perhaps I can express 20n5^{n-1} as (4n)5^{n} - something.

Wait, 20n5^{n-1} =4n5^{n}.

So f[n}=3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^{n}u[n}.

Which can be written as f[n}=3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Hmm. Let me see if any option can be rewritten to match this.

Looking at option C: f[n}=3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

But according to my calculation, I have an additional (4n -1)5^{n} term.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition. Let me try another approach to find A, B, C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use residue method.

Wait, another approach: let me write F(z) as:

F(z) = (2z² -2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

We can write it as F(z) = (2z(z-1))/[(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express F(z) as:

F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

We already did that, and found A=3, B=-1, C=20.

So the inverse transform is as before.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the options can be simplified to match my expression.

Option C: f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

But according to my calculation, f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^{n}u[n}.

Which is 3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 5^{n} as 5*5^{n-1}, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 4n5^{n} as (4/5) n5^{n+1}.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 5^{n} is 5^{n}.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option A: f[n}=4n u[n} + [(5/6)n -1]6^n u[n}.

No, that's 6^n, which doesn't match.

Option D: f[n}=3n u[n} + [(5/4)n -1](4/5)^n u[n}.

Hmm, 4/5 is 0.8, but I have 5^n terms.

Option G: f[n}=4n u[n} + [(7/8)n -2]8^n u[n}.

No.

Option H: f[n}=2n u[n} + [(3/5)n -1]4^n u[n}.

No.

Option I: f[n}=5n u[n} + [(6/7)n -1]7^n u[n}.

No.

Option J: f[n}=2^n u[n} + [(3/4)n +1](4/3)^n u[n}.

No.

Option B: f[n}=6n u[n} + [(2/3)n -1]3^n u[n}.

Hmm, 3^n and 3 terms.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate my expression to match one of the options.

My expression is f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Let me factor 3^{n} from the first term:

3^{n+1} =3*3^{n}.

So f[n} =3*3^{n}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

So f[n} =3^{n} [3] u[n} +5^{n} (4n -1) u[n}.

Looking at option D: f[n}=3n u[n} + [(5/4)n -1](4/5)^n u[n}.

No, not matching.

Option B: f[n}=6n u[n} + [(2/3)n -1]3^n u[n}.

Hmm, 3^n is present, but I have 3^{n+1} and 5^n terms.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should write the inverse transform differently. Let me consider each term again.

3/(z-3) →3 *3^n u[n} =3^{n+1}u[n}.

-1/(z-5) →-5^n u[n}.

20/(z-5)^2 →20 *n5^{n-1}u[n}.

So f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +20n5^{n-1}u[n}.

Now, 20n5^{n-1} =4n5^{n}.

So f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +4n5^{n}u[n}.

=3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Hmm. Let me see if any option can be expressed in this form. Option C is missing the 4n5^{n} term, but perhaps it's the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should write F(z) as:

F(z) = (2z² -2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

I can factor numerator: 2z(z -1). Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as F(z) = (2z² -2z) =2z² -2z.

Wait, perhaps I should perform the partial fractions again but differently.

Let me write F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2z² -2z = A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3).

Expanding:

A(z² -10z +25) + B(z² -8z +15) + C(z -3).

Gather terms:

(A + B)z² + (-10A -8B + C)z + (25A +15B -3C).

Set equal to 2z² -2z +0.

So equations:

1. A + B =2,

2. -10A -8B + C =-2,

3.25A +15B -3C =0.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to A=3, B=-1, C=20.

So that's correct.

Thus, the inverse transform is as I calculated.

But none of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse transform of 20/(z-5)^2.

Wait, the inverse z-transform of 1/(z - a)^2 is n a^{n-1} u[n}.

So 20/(z-5)^2 →20 * n5^{n-1}u[n}.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Perhaps I should check the options again for any possible match.

Wait, perhaps I can write 3^{n+1} as 3*3^n, and then see if any option combines 3^n and 5^n terms.

Looking at option D: f[n}=3n u[n} + [(5/4)n -1](4/5)^n u[n}.

Hmm, that's 3n and a term with (4/5)^n, which is 0.8^n.

But I have 3^{n+1} and 5^n terms. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial partial fractions. Let me try another approach: using cover-up for B.

We have F(z) =3/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

Wait, actually, no, the correct partial fraction form is A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the inverse transform of each term.

Inverse of 3/(z-3) is indeed 3*3^n u[n}.

Inverse of -1/(z-5) is -5^n u[n}.

Inverse of 20/(z-5)^2 is 20 *n5^{n-1}u[n}.

So, f[n}=3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +20n5^{n-1}u[n}.

Hmm. I think I've spent a lot of time on this, but I can't find a matching option. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach altogether, like using the z-transform tables or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express F(z) as F(z)= (2z² -2z)/(z-3)(z-5)^2.

Let me factor numerator as 2z(z-1).

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform the partial fraction decomposition as:

F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

Which we did, and found A=3, B=-1, C=20.

Thus, f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n} +20n5^{n-1}u[n}.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as f[n}=3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Looking at the options again, perhaps none match exactly, but perhaps option C is the closest, missing the 4n5^{n} term.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions, and the correct answer is option C.

But according to my calculations, f[n} includes an additional term.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial problem again.

Wait, the problem is to find the inverse z-transform of F(z) = (2z² -2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

Wait, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator differently.

Wait, 2z² -2z =2z(z-1).

Denominator: (z-3)(z-5)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write F(z) as 2z(z-1)/(z-3)(z-5)^2.

But I don't see an immediate way to simplify this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can split F(z) into two parts:

F(z) = [2z(z-1)] / [(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

Hmm, perhaps I can split it into F(z) = [2z(z-1)] / [(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can express F(z) as:

F(z) = (2z^2 -2z)/[(z-3)(z-5)^2} = [2z(z -1)] / [(z-3)(z-5)^2}.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform the partial fractions again, but perhaps I made a mistake in signs.

Wait, let me recheck the partial fractions.

F(z) = A/(z-3) + B/(z-5) + C/(z-5)^2.

Multiply by denominator:

2z² -2z =A(z-5)^2 + B(z-3)(z-5) + C(z-3).

At z=3: 2*(9) -2*(3)=18-6=12.

A(z-5)^2 at z=3: A*(3-5)^2= A*(4)=4A=12 →A=3.

At z=5: 2*25 -2*5=50-10=40.

C(z-3) at z=5: C*(2)=2C=40 →C=20.

Now, for B, set z=0:

F(0)=0= A*(25) + B*(-3)(-5) + C*(-3).

Which is 25A +15B -3C=0.

We have A=3, C=20.

So 25*3 +15B -3*20=0 →75 +15B -60=0 →15B +15=0 →15B= -15 →B= -1.

So the partial fractions are correct.

Thus, the inverse transform is as I calculated.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse transform.

Wait, perhaps I should write all terms with 5^{n}.

So, f[n} =3^{n+1}u[n} + (4n -1)5^{n}u[n}.

Hmm. Looking at the options again, perhaps option C is the intended answer, despite missing the 4n5^{n} term.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to choose the closest option, which is option C: f[n}=3^{n+1}u[n} -5^n u[n}.

The problem involves finding the inverse z-transform of \( F(z) = \frac{2z^2 - 2z}{(z - 3)(z - 5)^2} \) using partial fraction expansion. 

### Step 1: Partial Fraction Decomposition
The denominator factors are \((z - 3)\) and \((z - 5)^2\). Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is:

\[
F(z) = \frac{A}{z - 3} + \frac{B}{z - 5} + \frac{C}{(z - 5)^2}.
\]

Multiplying through by the denominator and equating coefficients, we solve for \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\):

1. \(A + B = 2\),
2. \(-10A - 8B + C = -2\),
3. \(25A + 15B - 3C = 0\).

Solving this system gives \(A = 3\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = 20\). Thus:

\[
F(z) = \frac{3}{z - 3} - \frac{1}{z - 5} + \frac{20}{(z - 5)^2}.
\]

### Step 2: Inverse z-Transforms
The inverse z-transforms of each term are:

1. \(\frac{3}{z - 3} \rightarrow 3 \cdot 3^n u[n] = 3^{n+1} u[n]\),
2. \(-\frac{1}{z - 5} \rightarrow -5^n u[n]\),
3. \(\frac{20}{(z - 5)^2} \rightarrow 20 \cdot n 5^{n-1} u[n]\).

Combining these, the time-domain function is:

\[
f[n] = 3^{n+1} u[n] - 5^n u[n] + 20n 5^{n-1} u[n}.
\]

Simplifying \(20n 5^{n-1}\) as \(4n 5^n\), we get:

\[
f[n] = 3^{n+1} u[n] - 5^n u[n] + 4n 5^n u[n}.
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
The derived expression includes terms \(3^{n+1} u[n]\) and \(5^n u[n]\), but none of the options match exactly. However, **Option C** closely resembles part of the solution, missing the \(4n 5^n\) term. Given the available options, **Option C** is the most plausible choice.
