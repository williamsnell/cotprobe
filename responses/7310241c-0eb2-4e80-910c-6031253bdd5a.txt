Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step. 

So, the professor owns an apartment building as a fee simple owner. He made a conveyance, which is a transfer of ownership, using a deed. The first conveyance was to his son and daughter as tenants in common. In that deed, he reserved a life estate to himself. So, he kept the right to use the property during his lifetime, and after that, the ownership would go to the children. But since they're tenants in common, each owns an undivided share, and upon death, their share would pass through their estate.

Then, the professor told his children about this conveyance and stored the deed in the family vault. So, the deed was recorded, I assume, since it was properly executed. Then, the son married a doctor, and the professor, who didn't like the doctor, executed another deed labeled as a "correction deed." In this new deed, the professor conveyed the apartment building again, this time to his son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Again, he reserved a life estate for himself. Both children accepted this correction deed.

Now, six months later, the son dies intestate, meaning without a will. The doctor is his sole heir. The question is about who holds the title to the apartment building now.

First, I need to understand the effect of the two deeds. The first deed was to the children as tenants in common. Then, the professor executed a second deed, called a correction deed, changing the tenancy to joint tenants with right of survivorship. Both deeds reserved a life estate to the professor. 

I remember that a life estate creates a future interest in the grantor. So, the professor has the right to use the property for his life, and after that, the remainder goes to the grantee(s). 

Now, the key issue is whether the second deed was effective to change the nature of the ownership from tenants in common to joint tenants. I think that deeds can be corrected or modified, but there are rules about how that works. A "correction deed" typically is used to correct a mistake in a prior deed. But here, the professor is changing the type of ownership. 

Under property law, a conveyance as joint tenants with right of survivorship requires that the grantor's intent be clear. The right of survivorship is a special feature that cannot be implied; it has to be clearly stated. So, in the second deed, the professor explicitly stated "as joint tenants with right of survivorship," which should create that interest.

However, I also need to consider if the second deed was properly recorded and accepted. The problem states that both children accepted the correction deed. So, as between the professor and the children, the second deed would take effect. But what about third parties, like the doctor, the son's heir?

Wait, the son is deceased, and the doctor is his heir. So, the question is whether the correction deed affects the doctor's interest. 

When the professor conveyed the property to the son and daughter as joint tenants, upon the son's death, the daughter would take the son's share by survivorship. But the professor has a life estate, so after his death, the daughter would own the entire property. 

But wait, the professor's life estate is separate. So, the life estate gives him the right to possess the property during his life, and the remainder goes to the joint tenants. So, upon the professor's death, the remainder would go to the surviving child. If both the son and daughter were joint tenants, then if the son dies, the daughter takes his share. So, the daughter would own the entire property upon the professor's death.

But in this case, the son died first. So, the son's interest as a joint tenant would pass to the daughter by survivorship. But the professor still has a life estate. So, the daughter now owns the entire future interest, subject to the professor's life estate. 

But wait, the professor executed the second deed, which was accepted by both children. So, that deed would govern the ownership. Therefore, the property is owned by the son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate.

Now, the son dies intestate. His heir is the doctor. But under the joint tenancy, when the son dies, his interest would pass to the daughter by survivorship. So, the daughter would own the entire future interest. The doctor, as the son's heir, wouldn't inherit anything because the son's interest was extinguished upon death and passed to the daughter. 

Therefore, the title is in the daughter as the sole owner, subject to the professor's life estate. 

Looking at the options, option C says "the daughter as the sole owner, subject to the professor's life estate." That seems correct.

Wait, but what about the life estate? The professor has a life estate, so during his life, he has the right to possession. After his death, the remainder goes to the daughter. So, the daughter's interest is subject to the life estate.

So, the answer should be C.
</think>

The professor executed two deeds: the first conveyed the apartment building to his children as tenants in common, and the second, labeled a "correction deed," conveyed it to them as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Both deeds reserved a life estate to the professor. The second deed was accepted by the children, making it effective between them. Upon the son's death, his interest passed to the daughter by survivorship under the joint tenancy. The professor's life estate allows him to possess the property during his lifetime, with the remainder going to the daughter after his death. The doctor, as the son's heir, does not inherit any interest because the son's share was extinguished upon his death and transferred to the daughter. Therefore, the title is in the daughter as the sole owner, subject to the professor's life estate.
