Question:

A lens found in 35 mm cameras has a focal length of 50 mm and a diameter of 25 mm, corresponding to a maximum aperture of (f / 2). The resolution of a lens is commonly expressed as the maximum number of lines per millimeter in the image that can be resolved. If the resolution of the lens is diffraction-limited, approximately what is the resolution in lines per mm? (Good quality 35 mm camera lenses typically have a resolution of the order of 100 [(lines) / mm], determined by surface precision rather than diffraction.)

Options:

A: 200 lines per mm
B: 500 lines per mm
C: 1200 lines per mm
D: 1000 lines per mm
E: 550 lines per mm
F: 350 lines per mm
G: 800 lines per mm
H: 741 lines per mm
I: 650 lines per mm
J: 900 lines per mm

Okay, so I've got this question about the resolution of a camera lens, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says the lens has a focal length of 50 mm and a diameter of 25 mm. The maximum aperture is f/2, which makes sense because 50 mm divided by 2 is 25 mm, so that's the diameter of the aperture when it's wide open.

The main point is about resolution, which is given as the maximum number of lines per millimeter that can be resolved. It mentions that the resolution is diffraction-limited, so I think I need to use the diffraction limit formula here. I remember that the resolving power is related to the wavelength of light and the aperture size.

I think the formula for the diffraction-limited resolution is something like (1.22 * λ) / (diameter of the aperture) multiplied by the focal length, or maybe divided by it. Wait, no, I think the formula for the resolving power (in line pairs per millimeter) is given by (1.22 * wavelength) / (aperture diameter) multiplied by the focal length. Or maybe it's (1.22 * wavelength) divided by (aperture diameter) times some factor. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the formula is: resolving power (in lines/mm) = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length in mm) / 1000? No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm mixing up the units. Oh, wait, because the focal length is in mm, and the diameter is in mm as well.

Wait, another approach: the Rayleigh criterion for the resolving power R is given by R = (1.22 * λ) / (d), where d is the diameter of the aperture. But that gives R in units of lines per millimeter? Wait, no, because R is the number of lines per millimeter that can be resolved. Or maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, I think the formula is: the maximum number of lines per millimeter (L/mm) is approximately (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in mm). Hmm, no, that seems off. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I recall that the resolving power can be calculated using the formula: L/mm = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength factor). Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the diffraction-limited resolution as (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (λ), but that doesn't make sense because the lambda would cancel out.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is: R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in the same units). Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't do that right now, so I'll try to think it through.

Wait, another way: the resolving power in terms of line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm) is given by (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (some factor). Or perhaps it's (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) multiplied by the number of wavelengths that fit into the focal length. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up concepts here. Let me try to approach it differently. The resolving power is determined by the diffraction limit, which is given by the Rayleigh criterion. The Rayleigh criterion states that two points are just resolvable if the center of the diffraction pattern of one is at the first minimum of the other. The formula for the angular resolution is θ = 1.22 * λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture.

But how does that translate to the number of lines per millimeter? I think once you have the angular resolution, you can relate it to the actual size on the image. So, if the angular resolution is θ, then the number of lines per millimeter would be 1/(2 * θ * focal length), but I'm not sure. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think again. The formula for the maximum resolution (R) in lines per millimeter is given by R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (some unit conversion factor). Wait, maybe it's R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length in mm) / (1000 * λ), but that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula as R ≈ 1.22 * (λ in mm) / (diameter in mm) * (focal length in mm) / (some factor). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that for a lens, the maximum resolution (in lp/mm) is approximately (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength factor). Wait, maybe it's (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) multiplied by (focal length) divided by the wavelength in micrometers or something. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the diffraction-limited resolution R is given by R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (some unit factor). Let's plug in the numbers.

Assuming λ is in micrometers, say 500 nm (5000 Å) which is 0.5 micrometers. The diameter is 25 mm, which is 25,000 micrometers. Wait, no, 25 mm is 25,000 micrometers? Wait, no, 1 mm is 1000 micrometers, so 25 mm is 25,000 micrometers. Wait, that seems too large because 25 mm is 25,000 micrometers. No, wait, no: 1 mm is 1000 micrometers, so 25 mm is 25 * 1000 = 25,000 micrometers. No, that's correct.

Wait, but if λ is 500 nm (0.5 micrometers), then let's compute R.

Wait, R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (some factor). Wait, perhaps the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in same units), but that would cancel out the λ. Hmm, no.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in mm). Wait, let's try that.

λ is 500 nm, which is 0.0005 mm. The diameter is 25 mm. Focal length is 50 mm.

So, R = (1.22 * 0.0005 mm) / (25 mm) * (50 mm) / (0.0005 mm). Wait, that would be R = (1.22 * 0.0005) /25 * 50 / 0.0005. Let me compute that.

Wait, the 0.0005 mm cancels out in numerator and denominator, so R = (1.22 * 0.0005 / 25) * (50 / 0.0005). Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in micrometers). Wait, that's getting messy.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in mm), but I'm not sure. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

λ = 500 nm = 0.0005 mm.

So R = (1.22 * 0.0005 mm) / (25 mm) * (50 mm) / (0.0005 mm).

Wait, let's compute that:

(1.22 * 0.0005) /25 = (0.00061) /25 ≈ 0.0000244.

Then multiply by 50 / 0.0005: 50 / 0.0005 = 100,000.

So R ≈ 0.0000244 * 100,000 ≈ 2.44.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.44 lines per mm is way too low, and the options are in hundreds or thousands.

Hmm, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length in mm) / (λ in mm). So λ in mm is 0.0005 mm.

So R = (1.22 * 0.0005 mm) / (25 mm) * (50 mm) / (0.0005 mm).

Wait, the 0.0005 mm cancels out, so R = (1.22) /25 *50 = (1.22 * 50)/25 = (1.22 * 2) ≈ 2.44. Again, same result, which can't be right.

Wait a minute, that's impossible because the options are way higher, like 100 to 1000 lines per mm. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (some other factor, like 2 or 1000). Let me try that.

Wait, another approach: the maximum resolution (R) in lines per millimeter is given by R ≈ 1.22 * (λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (1000), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think in terms of the formula. The resolving power R is the number of lines per mm that can be resolved, which is equivalent to the number of cycles per mm. The Rayleigh criterion gives the angular resolution θ as θ = 1.22 * λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture.

The angular resolution θ relates to the actual size on the image as θ = (1 / R), where R is in cycles per mm. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the size of the smallest feature that can be resolved. The size s on the image is s = f * θ, where f is the focal length.

So, substituting θ from Rayleigh, s = f * (1.22 * λ / D).

But the resolving power R is the number of lines per mm, which is 1/(2s), since each line is a pair of lines (a line and its adjacent line). Wait, no, R is the number of line pairs per mm that can be resolved, so each line pair occupies a distance s, so R = 1/(s) line pairs per mm.

Wait, that would mean R = 1/(2s), because each line pair is two lines, so s is the distance between the centers of two adjacent line pairs. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here.

Alternatively, perhaps R = 1/(2s), where s is the distance between the centers of two lines that can just be resolved.

So, s = f * θ = f * (1.22 * λ / D).

Then, R = 1/(2s) = D/(2f * 1.22 * λ).

Wait, that would make R = D/(2 * 1.22 * f * λ).

But let's plug in the numbers. D = 25 mm, f = 50 mm, λ = 500 nm = 0.0005 mm.

So R = 25 / (2 * 1.22 * 50 * 0.0005) = 25 / (2 * 1.22 * 25) because 50 * 0.0005 is 0.025, wait no:

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

2 * 1.22 = 2.44.

Then, 2.44 * 50 = 122.

Then, 122 * 0.0005 = 0.061.

So R = 25 / 0.061 ≈ 409.836 lines per mm.

Hmm, that's approximately 410 lines per mm. Looking at the options, the closest one is option H: 741, option I: 650, option E:550, option F:350, etc. Wait, 410 isn't exactly matching any option, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the formula. Maybe I should have used R = (D)/(1.22 * f * λ) without the 2.

Wait, let me try that. So R = D/(1.22 * f * λ).

Plugging in the numbers: 25 mm / (1.22 * 50 mm * 0.0005 mm).

Wait, wait, λ is 0.0005 mm? No, 500 nm is 0.0005 mm, yes.

So denominator: 1.22 *50 =61; 61 *0.0005=0.0305.

So R =25 / 0.0305 ≈ 819.67 lines per mm.

That's approximately 820 lines per mm, which is close to option H:741 or I:650. But wait, 820 isn't exactly matching any option. The options are A:200, B:500, C:1200, D:1000, E:550, F:350, G:800, H:741, I:650, J:900.

Wait, 820 is closer to 800 (option G) or 741 (H). Hmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the units? Because λ is 500 nm, which is 0.0005 mm. Alternatively, maybe I should have used micrometers instead.

Wait, 500 nm is 0.5 micrometers, which is 0.0005 mm. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (some unit conversion), but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula for the maximum resolution R in lines per millimeter is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (1000), because λ is in micrometers and f is in mm.

Wait, let's try that. λ = 500 nm = 0.5 micrometers.

So R = (1.22 * 0.5) / 25 * 50 / 1000.

Calculating numerator: 1.22 * 0.5 = 0.61.

Denominator: 25 * 1000 =25,000.

So R = (0.61 *50) /25,000.

0.61 *50 =30.5.

30.5 /25,000 ≈0.00122 lines per mm. That can't be right.

Hmm, I'm clearly getting something wrong here. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, another formula I found online before (but I can't access it now) is R ≈ 1380 * (wavelength in nm) / (diameter in mm) * (focal length in mm). Wait, but that might not be correct.

Wait, let's try that. Wavelength λ =500 nm.

So R = 1380 * 500 /25 *50.

Wait, 500/25=20.

20 *50=1000.

So R=1380 *1000=1,380,000. That's way too high; can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R ≈ 138 * (wavelength in nm) / (diameter in mm) * (focal length in mm). Let me try that.

So R =138 *500 /25 *50.

500/25=20.

20*50=1000.

R=138 *1000=138,000. Still way too high.

Hmm, that's not matching any options. So perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula R ≈ (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (some factor). Let's try that.

λ =500 nm =0.0005 mm.

D=25 mm.

f=50 mm.

So R = (1.22 *0.0005)/(25) *50.

(1.22 *0.0005)=0.00061.

0.00061 /25 =0.0000244.

0.0000244 *50=0.00122.

That's 0.00122 lines per mm. No, that's way too low.

Wait, maybe I should invert the formula. Maybe R = (D) / (1.22 * λ) * (f) / (something).

Wait, R = (D * f) / (1.22 * λ).

Plugging in: 25 *50 =1250.

1.22 *0.0005 =0.00061.

So R=1250 /0.00061 ≈2,049,180. That's way too high.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try using the formula R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (1000), considering units.

λ=500 nm=0.0005 mm.

So R=(1.22 *0.0005)/(25) *50/1000.

Calculating numerator:1.22*0.0005=0.00061.

Denominator:25*1000=25,000.

So R=0.00061 *50 /25,000.

0.00061 *50=0.0305.

0.0305 /25,000≈0.00000122 lines per mm. No, that's way too low.

Wait, maybe I should try using the formula R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) in mm, but with λ in micrometers.

Wait, λ=0.5 micrometers.

So R = (1.22 *0.5) /25 *50.

(1.22 *0.5)=0.61.

0.61/25=0.0244.

0.0244 *50=1.22 lines per mm. Again, way too low.

Wait, I'm clearly messing up the formula. Maybe I should try looking for a different approach.

Another idea: The resolving power R is given by the formula R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in the same units). Wait, perhaps I should consider that the wavelength in the focal plane is λ' = λ * (f / D), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in mm), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (1000), because focal length is in mm and we want the result in lines per mm.

Let me try that.

λ=500 nm=0.0005 mm.

So R = (1.22 *0.0005)/25 *50 /1000.

Wait, that would be R = (0.00061)/25 *0.05.

0.00061/25=0.0000244.

0.0000244 *0.05=0.00000122. Again, way too small.

Wait, I'm clearly stuck. Maybe I should try to find an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (some unit conversion factor). Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (1000), but I can't get a reasonable number.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the resolution R is given by R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in micrometers). Let me try that.

λ=500 nm=0.5 micrometers.

So R = (1.22 *0.5) /25 *50.

1.22 *0.5=0.61.

0.61/25=0.0244.

0.0244 *50=1.22 lines per mm. Again, too low.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me try R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) *1000.

So R= (1.22 *0.0005)/25 *50 *1000.

Compute:

1.22 *0.0005=0.00061.

0.00061 /25=0.0000244.

0.0000244 *50=0.00122.

0.00122 *1000=1.22 lines per mm. Still too low.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I should try using the formula R = (1.22 * λ) / (diameter) * (focal length) / (wavelength in mm).

Wait, that would be R = (1.22 *0.0005)/25 *50 /0.0005.

0.0005 cancels out, so R = (1.22)/25 *50 = (1.22 *50)/25 = (61)/25=2.44 lines per mm.

Still too low. I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R ≈ 130 * (f / D) * (wavelength in nm), but I'm not sure.

Wait, f/D is 50/25=2.

Wavelength is 500 nm.

So R=130 *2 *500=130 *1000=130,000 lines per mm. That's way too high.

No, that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: the resolving power R in cycles per mm is given by R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (1000), where λ is in micrometers, D in mm, and f in mm.

So λ=0.5 micrometers.

R = (1.22 *0.5)/25 *50/1000.

= (0.61)/25 *0.05.

= 0.0244 *0.05=0.00122 cycles per mm.

That's way too low.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula. R = (D)/(1.22 * λ) * (f) / (1000).

So R=25/(1.22 *0.5) *50/1000.

=25/(0.61) *0.05 ≈40.98 *0.05≈2.049 cycles per mm.

Again, too low.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the standard formula for diffraction-limited resolution.

Wait, I found a formula online before: R ≈ 1.22 * λ / (D) * (f) / (1000), where λ is in micrometers, D in mm, f in mm, and R in lines per millimeter.

So let's plug in the numbers.

λ=0.5 micrometers.

R=1.22 *0.5 /25 *50 /1000.

Compute:

1.22 *0.5=0.61.

0.61/25=0.0244.

0.0244 *50=1.22.

1.22/1000=0.00122 lines per mm. That's way too low.

Wait, maybe I should multiply by 1000 instead of dividing.

R=1.22 *0.5/25 *50 *1000.

=0.61/25 *50,000.

0.61/25=0.0244.

0.0244 *50,000=1220 lines per mm.

Hmm, that's option C:1200 lines per mm. But I'm not sure if I applied the formula correctly.

Wait, another way: The formula for the diffraction-limited resolution is R ≈ (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (some unit factor). Maybe the unit factor is 1000 because f is in mm and we want R in lines/mm.

So R= (1.22 *0.0005 mm) /25 mm *50 mm *1000.

Wait, let's compute:

1.22 *0.0005=0.00061.

0.00061 /25=0.0000244.

0.0000244 *50=0.00122.

0.00122 *1000=1.22 lines/mm. No, that's same as before.

Wait, I think I'm missing something here. Maybe the correct formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (wavelength in mm), but that would make the units cancel out.

Wait, λ=0.0005 mm.

So R= (1.22 *0.0005)/25 *50 /0.0005.

0.0005 cancels out, so R=1.22/25 *50= (1.22 *50)/25= (61)/25=2.44 lines/mm.

No, that's too low.

Wait, I'm really confused. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the formula in terms of the resolution formula.

The formula for the resolving power R (in lines per mm) is:

R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (λ_in_mm).

Wait, but λ_in_mm is 0.0005 mm, so that would cancel out the λ in numerator.

Wait, that would give R= (1.22 *0.0005)/(25) *50 /0.0005.

Which simplifies to (1.22 *0.0005 *50) / (25 *0.0005).

The 0.0005 in numerator and denominator cancels, so R= (1.22 *50)/25= (61)/25=2.44 lines/mm.

Same result again. But that can't be right because the options are much higher.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (some factor in micrometers). Let me try that.

λ=0.5 micrometers.

So R= (1.22 *0.5)/25 *50.

=0.61/25 *50=0.0244 *50=1.22 lines/mm.

Still too low.

Wait, I think I'm stuck because I can't get the formula right. Maybe I should try to find another way.

Another approach: The resolving power R is given by R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (1000), but I'm not sure.

Let me try plugging in the numbers again.

λ=500 nm=0.0005 mm.

R= (1.22 *0.0005)/25 *50 /1000.

= (0.00061)/25 *0.05.

=0.0000244 *0.05=0.00000122 lines/mm. No, that's way too low.

Wait, maybe I should multiply by 1000 instead of dividing.

R= (1.22 *0.0005)/25 *50 *1000.

=0.00061/25 *50,000.

=0.0000244 *50,000=122 lines/mm.

That's more reasonable. 122 lines/mm is close to option F:350, but not exact. Wait, no, option F is 350. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says that good quality lenses have a resolution of around 100 lines/mm, determined by surface precision, not diffraction. So if the lens is diffraction-limited, the resolution should be lower than that, but the options don't have anything below 200 except A:200.

Wait, that can't be right because the question says that diffraction-limited resolution is being asked, and the options include higher values.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) *1000.

So R=1.22 *0.0005/25 *50 *1000.

Compute:

1.22 *0.0005=0.00061.

0.00061/25=0.0000244.

0.0000244 *50=0.00122.

0.00122 *1000=1.22 lines/mm.

No, same as before.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) * (1000/λ_in_mm).

But that's getting too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is R ≈ 1.22 * (λ in mm) / (D) * (f) / (some factor).

Wait, λ=0.0005 mm.

So R=1.22 *0.0005/25 *50.

=0.00061/25 *50=0.0000244 *50=0.00122 lines/mm.

No, same result.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the Airy disk. The diameter of the Airy disk is approximately 2.44 * λ * D / f.

Wait, but how does that relate to resolution? The number of lines per mm would be the reciprocal of the spacing between the Airy disks.

Wait, perhaps the spacing between the lines is s = f * θ, where θ=1.22 * λ / D.

So s = f * (1.22 * λ / D).

Then, the number of lines per mm R would be 1/s (since each line is a point, and the spacing is s between centers).

So R = 1/(f *1.22 * λ / D) )= D/(1.22 * f * λ).

Plugging in the numbers:

D=25 mm, f=50 mm, λ=500 nm=0.0005 mm.

So R=25/(1.22 *50 *0.0005).

Compute denominator:

1.22 *50=61.

61 *0.0005=0.0305.

So R=25 /0.0305≈819.67 lines/mm.

That's approximately 820 lines/mm, which is close to option G:800 or option H:741.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would be closer to 819.67, which is about 820. The closest option is G:800, but it's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 25 /0.0305 precisely.

0.0305 *819=25.0095.

So 25/0.0305≈819.67.

So approximately 820 lines/mm.

Looking at the options, the closest is G:800 and H:741. But 820 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider using λ=550 nm instead of 500 nm, as that's the average wavelength. Let me try that.

λ=550 nm=0.00055 mm.

R=25/(1.22 *50 *0.00055).

Compute denominator:

1.22 *50=61.

61 *0.00055≈0.03355.

So R=25 /0.03355≈745.7 lines/mm.

That's approximately 746, which is close to option H:741.

So maybe the correct answer is H:741 lines/mm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes λ=500 nm, in which case R≈820, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses a different approximation, like 1.4 instead of 1.22.

Wait, let's try that. If we use 1.4 instead of 1.22, R=25/(1.4 *50 *0.0005)=25/(0.035)=714.28 lines/mm, which is close to option H:741.

Hmm, perhaps the question uses a different approximation, like 1.4 instead of 1.22.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use λ=500 nm, which gives R≈820, but since that's not an option, maybe the intended answer is H:741.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (1000), but I can't get it to match.

Wait, maybe I should use λ in micrometers.

λ=0.5 micrometers.

R= (1.22 *0.5)/25 *50.

=0.61/25 *50=0.0244*50=1.22 lines/mm.

No, that's too low.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (D) * (f) / (1000) * (1000), because λ is in micrometers and we need to convert to mm.

Wait, that would be R= (1.22 *0.5)/25 *50 *1000/1000.

Wait, that's R= (0.61)/25 *50=0.0244*50=1.22 lines/mm.

No, same result.

I think I've tried all possible approaches and the closest I get is around 741 lines/mm when using λ=550 nm and a factor of 1.4 instead of 1.22. So I'll go with option H:741.

The question involves calculating the diffraction-limited resolution of a lens with a focal length of 50 mm and a diameter of 25 mm. The resolution is expressed in lines per millimeter (L/mm), and the calculation relies on the diffraction limit formula. The key steps involve using the Rayleigh criterion, which relates the angular resolution to the wavelength of light, aperture diameter, and focal length.

The Rayleigh criterion states that the angular resolution θ is given by:

\[
\theta = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{D}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light (assumed to be 500 nm or 0.0005 mm) and \( D \) is the aperture diameter (25 mm). The angular resolution \( \theta \) is then related to the actual size on the image plane using the focal length \( f \):

\[
s = f \cdot \theta
\]

where \( s \) is the distance between the centers of two resolvable lines. The resolving power \( R \) (in L/mm) is the reciprocal of \( s \):

\[
R = \frac{1}{s} = \frac{D}{1.22 \cdot f \cdot \lambda}
\]

Substituting the given values (\( D = 25 \, \text{mm} \), \( f = 50 \, \text{mm} \), \( \lambda = 0.0005 \, \text{mm} \)):

\[
R = \frac{25}{1.22 \cdot 50 \cdot 0.0005}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1.22 \cdot 50 = 61, \quad 61 \cdot 0.0005 = 0.0305
\]

Now, calculate \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{25}{0.0305} \approx 819.67 \, \text{L/mm}
\]

This result, approximately 820 L/mm, does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, revisiting the wavelength assumption and using \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} \) (0.00055 mm) instead of 500 nm, the calculation yields:

\[
R = \frac{25}{1.22 \cdot 50 \cdot 0.00055} \approx 745.7 \, \text{L/mm}
\]

This value is close to option H: 741 L/mm. Considering potential approximations or rounding in the formula, the closest answer is:

**H: 741 lines per mm**
