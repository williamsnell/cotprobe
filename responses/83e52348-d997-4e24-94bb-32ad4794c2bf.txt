Okay, so I've got this question about the equilibrium populations of the 1H energy levels in a molecule after a pulse. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question says that initially, the populations are at equilibrium: nα = nαeq and nβ = nβeq. Then, a 5.0 μs pulse is applied with B1 = 4.697 mT. I need to find out what the populations are after this pulse.

Wait, what's a B1 field? Oh right, in NMR, B1 is the radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field applied perpendicular to the static magnetic field B0. The pulse duration and the B1 strength determine how much the spin states are flipped.

At equilibrium, the populations are in their thermal equilibrium distribution. For a two-level system like this, the populations depend on temperature. But when you apply a pulse, you're causing transitions between the α and β states.

So, the pulse is a π/2 pulse, I think. Because a π pulse would invert the population, but a π/2 pulse would put the system into a superposition, leading to some redistribution.

Wait, but the duration is given. Let me think about spin flips. The rotation angle θ of a pulse is given by θ = γ * B1 * τ, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, B1 is the amplitude, and τ is the pulse time.

Wait, but wait, at equilibrium, the populations are nαeq and nβeq. After a pulse, these populations change. But I'm a bit unclear on the exact effect. Let me recall.

In the absence of a pulse, the populations are in equilibrium. When a pulse is applied, it causes transitions between the states. The pulse will cause some of the α spins to flip to β and vice versa.

But the exact effect depends on the pulse's parameters. Let me think about the rotation angle. The formula for the rotation angle is θ = γ B1 τ. Wait, what's the value of γ for protons? I think it's about 267.5 × 10^6 rad/(T·s). Let me check: yeah, γ ≈ 267.5 MHz/T.

So, plugging in the numbers: B1 is 4.697 mT, which is 0.004697 T. The pulse time τ is 5.0 μs, which is 5e-6 seconds.

So, θ = γ * B1 * τ.

Let me calculate that:

γ = 267.5e6 rad/(T·s)
B1 = 4.697e-3 T
τ = 5e-6 s

θ = 267.5e6 * 4.697e-3 * 5e-6
Hmm, let's compute this step by step.

First, 267.5e6 * 4.697e-3 = 267.5e6 * 0.004697 ≈ 1.255e6 rad/s.

Then multiply by τ =5e-6 s: 1.255e6 *5e-6 = 6.275 radians.

Wait, that's a lot. 6.275 radians is more than a full π (≈3.14). So, it's about 2π multiples. Because 2π is about 6.28 radians. Oh, so 6.275 is almost exactly 2π. So θ ≈ 2π radians.

Wait, so a rotation of 2π radians is the same as 0, because angles in rotation are modulo 2π. So a 2π pulse would bring the system back to its original state. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because in practice, a π/2 pulse is 90 degrees, π is 180, etc.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I forgot the correct formula. Oh wait, another way: the rotation angle θ is given by θ = (γ B1 τ) / 2π. Because often, the formula is expressed in terms of the Larmor frequency. So perhaps I should calculate the number of oscillations.

Wait, let me think again. The resonance frequency ω is given by ω = γ B0, where B0 is the main magnetic field. But B1 is the RF field, and the effective rotation is θ = (γ B1 τ) / 2π.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should have considered that θ is in radians. Let me compute again: (267.5e6 rad/(T·s)) * 0.004697 T * 5e-6 s.

Let's compute 267.5e6 * 0.004697:

267.5e6 = 2.675e8
0.004697 = 4.697e-3

2.675e8 * 4.697e-3 = (2.675 *4.697) * 1e5 ≈ 12.56 * 1e5 = 1.256e6.

Multiply by τ =5e-6 s: 1.256e6 *5e-6 = 6.28 radians.

Ah, so θ =6.28 radians, which is about 2π (≈6.283). So θ ≈ 2π.

So, a rotation of 2π radians is a full circle, which brings the spin state back to the original position. So, in terms of spin flips, a 2π pulse would have no net effect, just like a π pulse inverts the state.

Wait, but that's the rotation angle. So, applying a 2π pulse would cause a rotation that brings the system back to the initial state. But wait, when you apply a pulse, the system undergoes a rotation, and the populations change.

Wait, but in the context of NMR, a π/2 pulse takes the system from the ground state (let's say) to a superposition. A π pulse inverts the populations. A 3π/2 pulse is like doing a π/2 in the opposite direction, and a 2π pulse brings it back.

But how does this affect the populations? Let's think about the populations before and after.

At equilibrium, the populations are nα and nβ. After a 2π pulse, which brings the system back to the same state, would the populations change?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the effect of the pulse on the spin state versus the population.

Alternatively, perhaps the pulse duration and B1 are such that the effect is to cause a certain number of transitions.

Wait, another approach: the number of transitions depends on the flip angle. For a 2π pulse, the net effect is zero change, because it's a full rotation, so the spin states don't change in population.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if I have a spin that's in α, a π pulse would flip it to β, and a 2π pulse would flip it back. So, after a 2π pulse, the population returns to the original state.

So, if I start with nαeq and nβeq, after the pulse, the populations would remain the same.

But wait, looking at the options, option F says nα = nαeq and nβ = nβeq. So that would make sense if the pulse has no effect.

But wait, why would a 2π pulse have no effect? Because it's a full rotation, so the net population change is zero. So the populations would remain at equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the effect of the pulse on the spin system. If the pulse is applied, it causes transitions between α and β. The number of transitions depends on the flip angle.

Wait, for a π pulse (θ=π), the populations are inverted. So, if initially nαeq, after π pulse, nα = nβeq and nβ = nαeq. So it swaps the populations.

But for a 2π pulse, the effect is the same as doing nothing because it's two full rotations, so the populations remain the same as before.

So in this case, the pulse is 5.0 μs with B1=4.697 mT, and we calculated θ=2π, so the populations don't change. So the answer would be option F: nα = nαeq and nβ = nβeq.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial state is at equilibrium, but after the pulse, the system is in a different state. Or is the system not in equilibrium anymore after the pulse?

Wait, no, the pulse is a perturbation. After the pulse, the system would start to precess again towards equilibrium, but the question is about the populations immediately after the pulse, not after relaxation.

So, in the case of a 2π pulse, the population redistribution would be zero because it's a full cycle. Hence, the populations remain as they were.

So, the answer should be F.

The question involves determining the populations of the 1H energy levels (α and β) after a 5.0 μs pulse with B1 = 4.697 mT, starting from equilibrium populations nα = nαeq and nβ = nβeq. The pulse causes a rotation in the spin states, with the rotation angle θ calculated as:

\[
\theta = \gamma B_1 \tau
\]

where γ ≈ 267.5 × 10⁶ rad/(T·s), B1 = 4.697 mT = 0.004697 T, and τ = 5.0 μs = 5 × 10⁻⁶ s. Substituting these values:

\[
\theta = (267.5 \times 10^6) \times (0.004697) \times (5 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 6.28 \, \text{radians}.
\]

Since 6.28 radians is approximately 2π, the pulse corresponds to a full rotation (2π), which brings the system back to its initial state. This means the populations remain unchanged from their equilibrium values. Therefore, after the pulse, the populations are:

\[
n_\alpha = n_{\alpha,\text{eq}}, \quad n_\beta = n_{\beta,\text{eq}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: nα = nαeq and nβ = nβeq**
