Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the energy needed to compress and stretch some carbon-carbon bonds. Hmm, the question says to assume a harmonic oscillator potential for bond stretching and compression. I remember that in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², where k is the force constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

Alright, let me break this down. The task is to calculate the energy for two things: compressing three single bonds and stretching three double bonds, all to the benzene bond length of 1.397 Å. I need to find the total energy for both actions.

First, I'll figure out the single bonds. The typical single bond length is 1.53 Å, and we're compressing it to 1.397 Å. So the displacement x is 1.53 - 1.397 = 0.133 Å. Wait, no—wait, when you compress, the bond gets shorter. So the displacement from equilibrium (which is the original bond length) is the amount it's compressed. So yes, x is 0.133 Å.

But wait, wait. No, wait. The harmonic oscillator model treats the potential energy based on the displacement from the equilibrium. So if we're compressing the bond, the displacement is the change in length. So for each single bond, the displacement x1 is 1.53 - 1.397 = 0.133 Å. Similarly, for the double bonds, their typical length is 1.335 Å, and we're stretching them to 1.397 Å. So the displacement x2 is 1.397 - 1.335 = 0.062 Å.

But wait, the problem says we're compressing three single bonds and stretching three double bonds. So each single bond is compressed by 0.133 Å, and each double bond is stretched by 0.062 Å.

Now, for each bond, the energy change is (1/2)k x². Since there are three of each, I'll multiply each energy by three.

Wait, but wait—hold on. The force constants are given as 500 N/m for single bonds and 950 N/m for double bonds. So for each single bond, the energy is (1/2)*500*(0.133e-10 m)^2. And for each double bond, it's (1/2)*950*(0.062e-10 m)^2. Wait, but wait, wait—because the units are in Ångströms, which is 1e-10 meters. So I need to convert the displacements into meters.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 0.133 Å is 0.133e-10 m. Similarly, 0.062 Å is 0.062e-10 m.

So for each single bond:

Energy per single bond = (1/2) * k_single * x_single²
= 0.5 * 500 N/m * (0.133e-10 m)^2.

Wait, but wait—wait, 0.133 Å is 0.133e-10 m, right?

So (0.133e-10 m)^2 = (0.133)^2 * (1e-20) m² = approximately 0.017689e-20 m².

So 0.5 * 500 = 250. So 250 * 0.017689e-20 = 4.42225e-20 J per single bond.

Wait, but wait, that's per bond. Since there are three single bonds being compressed, the total energy for single bonds is 3 * 4.42225e-20 J = 13.26675e-20 J.

Similarly, for each double bond, stretching by 0.062 Å:

Energy per double bond = 0.5 * 950 * (0.062e-10)^2.

Calculating (0.062e-10)^2 = (0.062)^2 * 1e-20 = 0.003844e-20 m².

Then, 0.5 * 950 = 475. So 475 * 0.003844e-20 = let's see, 475 * 0.003844 = approx 1.8277, so 1.8277e-20 J per double bond.

Three double bonds: 3 * 1.8277e-20 = 5.4831e-20 J.

Now, total energy is the sum of the two: 13.26675e-20 + 5.4831e-20 = 18.74985e-20 J.

Wait, but wait—that's in joules. The options are in kcal/mol, so I need to convert this energy into kcal per mole.

Hmm, how to convert J to kcal/mol. I remember that 1 cal = 4.184 J, and 1 kcal is 4184 J. Also, 1 mole is Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 molecules.

So first, let's compute the total energy in J per mole. Wait, wait—no, wait a second. The calculation I did is for a single molecule, right? Because I considered each bond and three of them. So the total energy per molecule is 18.74985e-20 J.

To get per mole, multiply by Avogadro's number: 18.74985e-20 J/molecule * 6.022e23 molecules/mol = let's calculate that.

18.74985e-20 * 6.022e23 = 18.74985 * 6.022 * 1e3 = because 1e-20 * 1e23 = 1e3.

18.74985 * 6.022 ≈ let's compute:

18 * 6 = 108, 0.74985 * 6 ≈4.499, 18 *0.022≈0.396, 0.74985 *0.022≈0.0165. So adding all: 108 +4.499=112.499, +0.396=112.895, +0.0165≈112.9115. So approx 112.9115e3 J/mol = 112911.5 J/mol.

Now, convert J to kcal: since 1 kcal = 4184 J, so 112911.5 J / 4184 ≈ let's compute.

Divide 112911.5 by 4184: 4184 * 27 = 112,968 (because 4000*27=108,000, 184*27=4,968; sum 112,968). Hmm, but our value is 112,911.5, which is a bit less than 112,968. So it's approximately 27 kcal/mol minus a little. Let me compute 27 * 4184 =112,968, so 112,911.5 is 112,968 - 56.5. So 27 kcal minus 56.5/4184 ≈ 56.5/4184≈0.0135. So about 27 - 0.0135 ≈26.9865 kcal/mol. So approximately 27 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait—let me check if I did the calculations correctly. Because this is a bit time-consuming, and maybe I made an error somewhere.

Wait, let's recalculate the energy per bond more accurately.

For single bonds:

x_single = 1.53 Å - 1.397 Å = 0.133 Å = 0.133e-10 m.

Energy per single bond: 0.5 * 500 * (0.133e-10)^2.

Compute (0.133e-10)^2 = (1.33e-11)^2 = (1.33)^2 * 1e-22 = 1.7689e-22 m².

So 0.5 *500 = 250. So 250 * 1.7689e-22 = 4.42225e-20 J per single bond.

Three single bonds: 3 * 4.42225e-20 = 1.326675e-19 J.

For double bonds:

x_double = 1.397 - 1.335 = 0.062 Å = 0.062e-10 m.

Energy per double bond: 0.5 *950 * (0.062e-10)^2.

(0.062e-10)^2 = (6.2e-12)^2 = 38.44e-24 m² = 3.844e-23 m².

0.5 *950 =475. 475 *3.844e-23 = let's compute 475 *3.844 = ?

Well, 400 *3.844 = 1,537.6, 75 *3.844 = 288.3, so total 1,537.6 +288.3=1,825.9. So 1,825.9e-23 J per double bond.

Three double bonds: 3 *1,825.9e-23 =5,477.7e-23 J =5.4777e-20 J.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1,825.9e-23 J is per double bond, so three would be 5,477.7e-23 J, which is 5.4777e-20 J.

Wait, but wait—earlier I thought it was 5.4831e-20 J. Close enough, perhaps rounding differences.

So total energy per molecule is 1.326675e-19 +5.4777e-20 = 1.326675e-19 +0.54777e-19=1.874445e-19 J.

Wait, that's per molecule. Now, per mole, multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23):

1.874445e-19 J/molecule *6.022e23 molecules/mol = 1.874445 *6.022e4 J/mol.

Compute 1.874445 *6.022 ≈ 1.874 *6.022 ≈ let's compute:

1.8 *6.022=10.8396, 0.074 *6.022≈0.4456. Sum ≈10.8396 +0.4456=11.2852.

So 11.2852e4 J/mol = 112,852 J/mol.

Convert J to kcal: 112,852 J /4184 J/kcal ≈ let's divide.

4184 *27=112,968. So 112,852 is 112,968 -116. So 27 kcal - (116/4184) ≈ 27 -0.0277≈26.9723 kcal/mol.

So approximately 27 kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 27 kcal/mol. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait—am I sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: Maybe I can compute the energy for each type of bond and sum them.

Single bonds:

Each is compressed by 0.133 Å. So:

Energy per single bond: 0.5 *500N/m * (0.133e-10 m)^2.

= 0.5 *500 * (0.133)^2 * (1e-10)^2.

= 250 * 0.017689 * 1e-20.

= 250 * 0.017689 = approx 4.42225e-20 J.

Three single bonds: 3 *4.42225e-20 =13.26675e-20 J.

Double bonds:

Each stretched by 0.062 Å.

Energy per double bond: 0.5 *950 * (0.062e-10)^2.

=0.5 *950 *0.003844 *1e-20.

=475 *0.003844e-20.

=475 *0.003844 ≈1.8277e-20 J.

Three double bonds: 3 *1.8277e-20=5.4831e-20 J.

Total per molecule:13.26675e-20 +5.4831e-20=18.74985e-20 J.

Per mole:18.74985e-20 J/molecule *6.022e23 molecules/mol =18.74985e3 *6.022 ≈ ?

Wait, 18.74985e-20 *6.022e23 =18.74985 *6.022e3.

Because 1e-20 *1e23=1e3.

18.74985 *6.022 ≈ let's calculate:

18 *6.022=108.396

0.74985 *6.022≈4.519

Sum≈108.396 +4.519≈112.915.

So 112.915e3 J/mol =112,915 J/mol.

Convert to kcal:112,915 /4184 ≈27 kcal/mol.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So the answer should be option G:27 kcal/mol.

To calculate the energy required to compress three single bonds and stretch three double bonds to the benzene bond length (1.397 Å), we use the harmonic oscillator potential energy formula, \( E = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \), where \( k \) is the force constant and \( x \) is the displacement from equilibrium.
