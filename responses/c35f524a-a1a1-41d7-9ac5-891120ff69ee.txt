Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the value of y that makes the equation y + 2.9 equal to 11. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the equation is y + 2.9 = 11. I remember from school that to solve for y, I need to isolate it on one side. So, I should subtract 2.9 from both sides to get y by itself. Let me write that down.

So, if I subtract 2.9 from both sides, it would look like this:

y + 2.9 - 2.9 = 11 - 2.9

That simplifies to y = 11 - 2.9. Now, I need to do the subtraction. Let me calculate that. 11 minus 2.9... Well, 11 is the same as 10 + 1, and subtracting 2.9 would leave me with 8.1. Wait, no, that can't be right because 2.9 is almost 3, so 11 minus 3 is 8, but since it's 2.9, it's a little more than 8. Let me do it properly.

11 minus 2.9: Let's think in terms of money to make it easier. If I have $11 and I spend $2.90, how much do I have left? Well, $11 minus $2 is $9, then minus another $0.90 would be $8.10. So, y = 8.1.

Now, looking at the options: A is 12.9, which seems too high. B is 15.1, way too big. C is 11.1, that's more than 11, which doesn't make sense because adding 2.9 to 11.1 would give over 14. D is 14.9, also too high. E is 8.9, which is close but not exactly 8.1. F is 9.9, that's higher than 8.1. G is 8.1, which matches my calculation. H is 10.1, that's higher. I is 13.9, way too high. J is 9.1, also higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check the subtraction. 11 minus 2.9. Let me write it vertically:

```
 11.0
- 2.9
------
```

Starting from the right, 0 minus 9 can't do, so I borrow. The 1 becomes 0, and the 0 becomes 10. Then, 10 minus 9 is 1. Next, 0 minus 2 is negative, so I borrow again. The 1 becomes 0, and the 0 becomes 10. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, 11 is 11.0, so subtracting 2.9:

11.0 - 2.9 = ?

Let me subtract 3.0 first, which would be 8.0, but since it's 2.9, which is 0.1 less than 3.0, I add 0.1 back. So, 8.0 + 0.1 = 8.1. Yep, that's correct.

So, the answer should be G: 8.1.

The correct value of y is 8.1, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
