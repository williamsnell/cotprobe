Okay, so I've got this question about an S corporation and a shareholder contributing equipment. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might get confused, but I'll take it slow.

First, the question says the shareholder is the sole shareholder of an S corporation. They contributed equipment with a fair market value of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000. The equipment is subject to $12,000 liability. The question is asking about the gain the shareholder must recognize.

Hmm, I remember that when a shareholder contributes property to a corporation, it's usually considered a transfer. So, the shareholder is giving up the equipment to the S corp in exchange for some shares or maybe just as a contribution. Since it's an S corporation, I think there are specific tax implications.

Wait, the basis of the equipment is $6,000. Basis generally refers to the cost of the asset for tax purposes. The fair market value is higher at $20,000. So the shareholder is transferring an asset that's worth more than what they paid for it. I think that might mean there's a gain, but I'm not sure if it's taxable.

I recall something about tax basis and liabilities affecting the gain. The equipment is subject to $12,000 liability. That probably means there's a loan or something against the equipment, so the corporation might have to pay that off or the liability affects the value.

In a typical contribution scenario, if a shareholder contributes property to a corporation, they generally don't recognize a gain unless certain conditions are met. I think under Subchapter S, when a shareholder transfers property to an S corporation in exchange for stock, the shareholder's basis in the stock is the same as their basis in the property. But what about gains?

Wait, there's a rule about liabilities. If the property is subject to liabilities, the shareholder might not recognize gain up to the amount of the liabilities. So, the shareholder's gain is the fair market value minus the basis, but if the liabilities are more than that, maybe the gain is reduced.

Let me calculate the potential gain first. The fair market value is $20k, basis is $6k. So the gain would be $20k - $6k = $14k. But wait, there's a $12k liability attached to the equipment. So does that affect the gain?

I think when a shareholder contributes property subject to liabilities, the gain is the fair market value minus the basis, but only up to the amount of liabilities. Or maybe the gain is the lesser of the two: fair market value minus basis, or the liability. Or perhaps the gain is subject to the liability, so if the liability is more than the gain, then the gain is limited.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that the shareholder's gain is the fair market value minus the basis, but any gain is recognized only to the extent that the liability doesn't exceed the basis. Or maybe the gain is the fair market value minus the basis, but the liability is treated as a reduction of the basis. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Another thought: when property is contributed, the shareholder's basis in the S corporation's stock is the same as their basis in the property. But if the property is subject to liabilities, the basis is adjusted. So the adjusted basis would be the basis of the property minus the liabilities, I think.

Wait, no. I think the basis is the basis of the property, and the liabilities are treated separately. So the gain is calculated as the fair market value minus the basis. But if the liabilities are more than the basis, does that change anything? Or is the gain only the difference between FMV and basis, regardless of the liability?

Wait, maybe the liability doesn't directly affect the gain. The gain is based on the difference between FMV and basis. The liability would affect the basis in the stock, though. Because when the shareholder contributes the equipment to the S corp, their basis in the stock they receive is equal to the basis of the equipment minus any liabilities. So the basis in the stock would be $6k (basis) minus $12k (liability) = negative $6k, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe it's just zero.

But the question is about the gain the shareholder must recognize. So the gain is FMV minus basis, which is $20k - $6k = $14k. But wait, I thought that when you transfer property to an S corporation in exchange for stock, you don't recognize a gain unless the transfer is in exchange for something more than the stock, like cash or other property. Or if the liabilities exceed the basis, maybe the gain is limited.

Wait, another rule I remember is that if a shareholder contributes property to an S corporation, they don't recognize a gain unless the transfer is in exchange for something other than stock. So if it's just a contribution for stock, no gain is recognized. Because it's considered an exchange for stock, which is a non-taxable event for the shareholder.

Wait, but wait, I might be mixing up C corporations and S corporations. For C corps, sometimes there's a gain if it's a transfer for boot, but for S corps, the treatment might be different.

In an S corporation, when a shareholder transfers property in exchange for stock, it's treated as a tax-free exchange under Section 351. So the shareholder doesn't recognize any gain. But wait, the basis rules are different. The basis of the stock received is the same as the basis of the property transferred, adjusted for any liabilities.

So in this case, the shareholder contributes equipment with a basis of $6k and FMV $20k, subject to $12k liability. Since the transfer is under Section 351 (assuming it's a qualifying transfer), the shareholder doesn't recognize any gain. So the gain would be zero.

But wait, what about the liability? The liability is considered as a reduction in basis. So the basis of the stock would be $6k minus $12k, which would be -$6k. But since basis can't be negative, maybe it's treated as zero. But the important part is that the shareholder doesn't recognize a gain because the transfer is tax-free under 351.

So the correct answer would be B: $0.

The shareholder contributes equipment with a basis of $6,000 and a fair market value of $20,000, subject to $12,000 liability. Under Section 351, transfers of property to an S corporation in exchange for stock are tax-free for the shareholder, meaning no gain is recognized. The liability affects the basis in the stock but does not alter the tax-free nature of the transfer. Therefore, the shareholder does not recognize any gain.

Answer: B
