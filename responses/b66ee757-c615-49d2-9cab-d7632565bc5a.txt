Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.
"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity."

Okay, so I need to figure out which political movement most closely shares the goals of the Populist Party as outlined in their 1892 platform. Let me start by understanding what the Populist Party stood for.

From the passage, it seems the Populists were really critical of the two major political parties, the Democrats and Republicans, accusing them of allowing "dreadful conditions" that hurt ordinary people. They mention issues like corruption by big businesses, such as corporations, banks, trusts, and usurers. The Populists wanted to restore power to "the plain people" and ensure that the government works for everyone's benefit, not just the wealthy elites.

They also talk about economic reforms, like addressing the demonetization of silver, which relates to monetary policies that were affecting farmers and working-class people. The Populists wanted substantial reforms to prevent exploitation and ensure justice and domestic tranquility.

Now, looking at the options:

A: The Tea Party movement of the early 2000s. I know the Tea Party is a conservative movement focused on limited government, lower taxes, and opposition to big government. But the Populists were more about anti-corruption and empowering ordinary people, which might not align directly with the Tea Party's focus on small government without necessarily addressing economic reforms for the majority.

B: Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s. Jacksonian Democrats were indeed about expanding democracy and reducing corruption, like fighting the Bank of the United States. They were against monopolies and in favor of the common man. This seems somewhat similar to Populism, as both movements aimed at empowering ordinary people against the elites. However, Jacksonian Democracy was more about westward expansion and Indian removal, which the Populists might not align with as much.

C: Neoconservatism of the 1980s. Neocons focus on issues like national security, traditional values, and a strong military. Doesn't seem to match the Populists' focus on economic justice and government for the people.

D: Progressivism of the early 1900s. Progressives pushed for social reforms, labor laws, women's suffrage, and anti-corruption measures. They targeted big corporations and trusts, aiming to make government more responsive to public needs. This seems very close to the Populists' goals of fighting corruption, promoting economic justice, and ensuring the government serves the people.

E: Federalism of the late 1700s. Federalism is about the balance of power between federal and state governments. Doesn't directly address the economic or social issues the Populists were concerned with.

F: The New Deal policies of the 1930s. The New Deal was a series of programs to应对 the Great Depression, focusing on economic relief, recovery, and reform. It's more about addressing economic crises than the broader anti-corruption and empowerment goals of the Populists.

G: The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. While both the Populists and Civil Rights movement fought against oppression, the Civil Rights movement was focused on racial equality, whereas Populists were more about economic and political empowerment against corporate and political elites.

H: Isolationism of the early 1900s. Isolationism is about avoiding involvement in international affairs. Not related to the Populists' domestic focus on economic justice and government reform.

I: Socialism of the late 1800s. Socialism advocates for collective ownership of the means of production. While both movements were critical of capitalism, socialism is more about restructuring the economic system, whereas Populists aimed to reform the political system to make it more responsive to the people.

J: The Counterculture movement of the 1960s. This was more about cultural and social revolution, like opposing the Vietnam War and traditional norms, not about political reform or economic justice as the Populists were.

So, comparing all options, Progressivism (D) seems to align most closely with the Populists. Both movements were concerned with economic justice, fighting corruption, and empowering ordinary citizens against the powerful elites. The Populists wanted the government to serve the people, and Progressives pushed for similar reforms, such as anti-trust laws and labor protections.
