Okay, so I need to find v(0+) and (dv/dt)_(0+) given the Laplace transform V(s) = (-36s² -24s +2)/(12s³ +17s² +6s). Hmm, I remember that to find v(0+) and the derivative at t=0+, I need to apply the initial value theorem. 

Wait, the initial value theorem says that v(0+) is the limit as s approaches infinity of sV(s). And for the derivative, (dv/dt)_(0+), it's the limit as s approaches 0 of s²V(s). Let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, I think that's correct.

First, let's tackle v(0+). So I need to compute the limit as s approaches infinity of sV(s). Let's substitute V(s) into that:

Limit as s→∞ of s * [(-36s² -24s +2)/(12s³ +17s² +6s)].

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this by dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of s in the denominator, which is s³. So:

Numerator becomes (-36s² -24s +2)/s³ = (-36/s -24/s² + 2/s³)
Denominator becomes (12s³ +17s² +6s)/s³ = 12 + 17/s +6/s².

So when s approaches infinity, the terms with 1/s, 1/s², etc., go to zero. So the limit becomes:

s * [ (-36/s ) / 12 ] as s→∞. Wait, because the numerator after division is -36/s and the denominator is 12. So that's (-36/s) / 12 = (-36)/(12s) = -3/s. Then multiply by s from the initial limit, so s * (-3/s) = -3. So v(0+) is -3. 

Wait, let me check that again. When I take s * V(s), and V(s) is [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [12s³ +17s² +6s ]. When I multiply by s, it's [ s*(-36s² -24s +2) ] / [12s³ +17s² +6s ].

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's expand the expression:

s * [ (-36s² -24s +2) ] / [12s³ +17s² +6s ].

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: s*(-36s² -24s +2) = -36s³ -24s² +2s.

Denominator: 12s³ +17s² +6s = s(12s² +17s +6).

So the expression becomes (-36s³ -24s² +2s) / [s(12s² +17s +6)].

I can factor out s from numerator and denominator:

s*(-36s² -24s +2) / [s*(12s² +17s +6)] ].

The s cancels out, so we have (-36s² -24s +2)/(12s² +17s +6).

Now, taking the limit as s approaches infinity, the dominant terms are -36s² in numerator and 12s² in denominator. So the limit is (-36s²)/(12s²) = -36/12 = -3. So yes, v(0+) is -3.

Now, for (dv/dt)_(0+), which is the limit as s approaches 0 of s²V(s). Let's compute that.

V(s) is [ (-36s² -24s +2 ) ] / [12s³ +17s² +6s ].

So s²V(s) = s² * [ (-36s² -24s +2 ) ] / [12s³ +17s² +6s ].

Let me plug in s=0 directly. Hmm, but when s=0, numerator becomes 2, denominator becomes 0, so it's undefined. So I'll need to compute the limit as s approaches 0.

Alternatively, maybe expand the denominator as a series around s=0. Let's see.

Denominator: 12s³ +17s² +6s = s(12s² +17s +6). When s approaches 0, the denominator behaves like 6s, because 6s is the lowest order term.

So denominator ≈ 6s for small s.

Numerator: (-36s² -24s +2) ≈ 2 -24s -36s².

So s²V(s) ≈ s² * (2 -24s -36s²) / (6s) ) = s²*(2)/(6s) ) when s is small, because higher terms are negligible.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately. Let's factor denominator as 6s (1 + (17/6)s + (12/6)s²) ) = 6s (1 + (17/6)s + 2s² ).

So s²V(s) = s² * [ (-36s² -24s +2) ] / [6s (1 + (17/6)s + 2s²) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= s² * [ (-36s² -24s +2) ] / [6s (1 + (17/6)s + 2s²) ) ]

= [ s² * (-36s² -24s +2) ] / [6s (denominator terms) ]

= [ s*(-36s² -24s +2) ] / [6 (1 + (17/6)s + 2s²) ) ]

Expanding numerator: s*(-36s² -24s +2) = -36s³ -24s² + 2s.

So now, s²V(s) = (-36s³ -24s² +2s) / [6(1 + (17/6)s + 2s²) ).

Now, when s approaches 0, the dominant term in the numerator is 2s, and the denominator approaches 6*1 =6.

So the limit as s→0 is (2s)/(6) ) = (s/3). Wait, but that suggests the limit is zero, which can't be right because looking at the options, only option E and I have v(0+) = -3, but their derivatives are 1.25 and 0.75, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's try another method. Maybe perform a partial fraction decomposition or look for the expansion of V(s) around s=0.

Alternatively, let's factor the denominator 12s³ +17s² +6s. Factor out an s: s(12s² +17s +6). Now, can I factor 12s² +17s +6 further? Let's see:

Looking for factors of 12*6=72 that add up to 17. Hmm, 8 and 9: 8+9=17. So 12s² +8s +9s +6 = (4s)(3s+2) +3(3s+2) = (4s+3)(3s+2). So denominator is s(4s+3)(3s+2).

So V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [ s(4s+3)(3s+2) ].

Now, to find the limit as s→0 of s² V(s), which is s² [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [ s(4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

Simplify s²/s: becomes s.

So s² V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] * s / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

As s→0, plug in s=0: numerator becomes 2*s=0, but wait, no, wait:

Wait, let me compute this correctly. The expression is [ (-36s² -24s +2 ) * s ] / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

So when s→0, numerator approaches (2)*0 =0, denominator approaches (3)(2)=6. So 0/6=0. Wait, that's zero, but that's not matching any options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I should expand V(s) as a series around s=0. Let me try that.

V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [ s(4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

Let me write denominator as s*(3 +4s)*(2 +3s).

So 1/(3+4s) = (1/3) * 1/(1 + (4/3)s) ) ≈ (1/3)(1 - (4/3)s + (4/3)^2 s² - ... ) for small s.

Similarly, 1/(2+3s) = (1/2) * 1/(1 + (3/2)s) ) ≈ (1/2)(1 - (3/2)s + (3/2)^2 s² - ... ).

So the denominator's reciprocal is approximately [1/(3*2)] * [1 - (4/3)s + ... ] * [1 - (3/2)s + ... ].

Multiplying these together: 1/(6) [1 - (4/3 + 3/2)s + ... ].

So 1/(denominator) ≈ [1/(6)] [1 - (17/6)s + ... ].

Now, V(s) is numerator * [1/(denominator)]:

V(s) ≈ [ -36s² -24s +2 ] * [1/(6)] [1 - (17/6)s + ... ].

Multiply numerator and the expansion:

= [2 -24s -36s² ] * [1/(6)] [1 - (17/6)s + ... ]

= (2/(6)) [1 - (17/6)s ] - (24s/(6)) [1 - (17/6)s ] - (36s²/(6)) [1 - ... ] + higher terms.

Simplify each term:

= (1/3) [1 - (17/6)s ] - (4s) [1 - (17/6)s ] -6s² [ ... ].

Now, expand up to s terms because we need the limit as s→0 for s² V(s):

So, up to s^1 terms:

V(s) ≈ (1/3) [1 - (17/6)s ] -4s [1 ] + higher terms.

= (1/3) - (17/18)s -4s + ... 

= (1/3) - ( (17/18) +4 ) s + ...

= (1/3) - ( (17 +72)/18 ) s + ...

= (1/3) - (89/18)s + ...

Now, multiply by s² to get s² V(s):

s² V(s) ≈ s² [ (1/3) - (89/18)s + ... ].

= (1/3)s² - (89/18)s^3 + ... 

Now, take the limit as s→0: the dominant term is (1/3)s², which approaches 0 as s→0. Hmm, but that's zero. But none of the options have zero for (dv/dt)_0+, except option D, which has v(0+) as 0 and dv/dt as 1.5. But from earlier, v(0+) is -3, so option D is out.

Wait, this can't be right because the options don't have zero for dv/dt when v(0+) is -3, except option E and I. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try another approach. Maybe use L’Hospital’s Rule for the limit as s approaches 0 of s² V(s).

So, V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [ s(4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

So s² V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] * s / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

As s approaches 0, numerator is (2)*0 = 0, denominator is (3)(2)=6. So it's 0/6=0. But that's not matching any options except option D, which has v(0+) as 0, which we already established is wrong because v(0+) is -3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the derivatives again. The initial value theorem for derivatives is that (dv/dt)_0+ = lim_{s→0} s² V(s).

Wait, perhaps I should compute this limit more carefully. Let me plug in the function:

lim_{s→0} [ (-36s² -24s +2 ) * s ] / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

= lim_{s→0} [ (-36s³ -24s² +2s) ] / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

As s approaches 0, numerator approaches 0, denominator approaches 3*2=6. So the limit is 0/6=0. But that's not matching any options where v(0+) is -3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function might have a residue or a term that contributes to the derivative. Alternatively, maybe I should perform a partial fraction decomposition and then find the inverse Laplace transform.

Let me try that. Let's factor the denominator as s(4s+3)(3s+2). So we can write V(s) as A/s + B/(4s+3) + C/(3s+2).

So, (-36s² -24s +2)/(s(4s+3)(3s+2)) = A/s + B/(4s+3) + C/(3s+2).

Multiply both sides by s(4s+3)(3s+2):

-36s² -24s +2 = A(4s+3)(3s+2) + B s(3s+2) + C s (4s+3).

Now, let's find A, B, C by plugging in suitable s values.

First, s=0:

Left side: 2.

Right side: A*(3)(2) + 0 + 0 → 6A =2 → A=2/6=1/3.

Next, s = -3/4 (so 4s+3=0):

Left side: -36*(-3/4)^2 -24*(-3/4) +2 = -36*(9/16) + 18 +2 = - (324/16) +20 = -81/4 +20 = (-81 +80)/4 = -1/4.

Right side: 0 + B*(-3/4)*(3*(-3/4)+2) + 0.

Compute 3*(-3/4) +2 = -9/4 +8/4 = (-9 +8)/4 = -1/4.

So B*(-3/4)*(-1/4) = B*(3/16).

Set equal to left: 3B/16 = -1/4 → B= (-1/4)*(16/3) )= -4/3.

Next, let s = -2/3 (so 3s+2=0):

Left side: -36*(-2/3)^2 -24*(-2/3) +2 = -36*(4/9) +16 +2 = -16 +18 = 2.

Right side: A(4*(-2/3)+3)(3*(-2/3)+2) + 0 + C*(-2/3)(4*(-2/3)+3).

Compute 4*(-2/3)+3 = -8/3 +9/3 = 1/3.

3*(-2/3)+2 = -2 +2=0.

So first term: A*(1/3)(0) =0.

Third term: C*(-2/3)(4*(-2/3)+3) = C*(-2/3)*( (-8/3)+9/3 ) = C*(-2/3)*(1/3)= C*(-2/9).

Set equal to left side: 2 = 0 + 0 + C*(-2/9) → C*(-2/9)=2 → C= 2*(-9/2)= -9.

So now, A=1/3, B=-4/3, C=-9.

So V(s) = (1/3)/s + (-4/3)/(4s+3) + (-9)/(3s+2).

Now, the inverse Laplace transform:

v(t) = (1/3) L^{-1}{1/s} + (-4/3) L^{-1}{1/(4s+3)} + (-9) L^{-1}{1/(3s+2)}.

Which is:

v(t) = (1/3) u(t) - (4/3)(1/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -9*(1/3) e^{-2t/3} u(t).

Simplify:

= (1/3) u(t) - (1/3) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -3 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

Now, to find v(0+), we look at the limit as t approaches 0+ of v(t). The unit step function u(t) is 0 for t<0 and 1 for t≥0, so at t=0+, all terms contribute.

v(0+) = (1/3) - (1/3) e^0 -3 e^0 = (1/3) - (1/3) -3 = (0) -3 = -3. That matches our earlier result.

Now, to find (dv/dt)_0+, we can take the derivative of v(t) and evaluate the limit as t approaches 0+.

v(t) = (1/3) u(t) - (1/3) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -3 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

The derivative is:

dv/dt = (1/3) δ(t) - (1/3)*(-3/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -3*(-2/3) e^{-2t/3} u(t).

Simplify:

= (1/3) δ(t) + (1/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) + 2 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

At t=0+, the delta function δ(t) contributes a Dirac delta, but when taking the limit as t→0+, we only consider the terms that are continuous, so the delta function's effect is on the impulse and not the limit. So the limit of dv/dt as t→0+ is the sum of the terms without delta function.

So, (dv/dt)_0+ = 0 (from delta) + (1/4) e^0 + 2 e^0 = 0 + 1/4 + 2 = (1/4 + 8/4) = 9/4 = 2.25.

Wait, 1/4 is 0.25 and 2 is 8/4, so 0.25 + 2 = 2.25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is v(0+)=-3, (dv/dt)=0.75. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, let me check my calculation again.

Wait, in the derivative, the term from (1/3) u(t) is the delta function, but when taking the limit as t approaches 0 from the positive side, the delta function contributes an impulse, but the other terms are evaluated at t=0.

Wait, let me recalculate the derivative correctly.

Wait, v(t) = (1/3) u(t) - (1/3) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -3 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

So the derivative dv/dt is:

d/dt [ (1/3) u(t) ] = (1/3) δ(t)
d/dt [ - (1/3) e^{-3t/4} u(t) ] = - (1/3)(-3/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) + (other terms when t=0, but for t>0, it's just the exponential term)
Similarly, d/dt [ -3 e^{-2t/3} u(t) ] = -3*(-2/3) e^{-2t/3} u(t).

So, putting it all together:

dv/dt = (1/3) δ(t) + (1/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) + 2 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

Now, when taking the limit as t approaches 0+, the delta function's contribution is not a value but an impulse, so the limit of dv/dt as t→0+ is just the sum of the other terms evaluated at t=0.

So, (dv/dt)_0+ = 0 (from delta) + (1/4)*1 + 2*1 = 1/4 + 2 = 9/4 = 2.25.

Looking at the options, option I has v(0+) = -3 and (dv/dt)_0+ = 0.75, which doesn't match. Option C is v(0+) = -3, (dv/dt)=4.25. Option I is 0.75. Hmm, none of the options have 2.25 except option I, but wait, option I has (dv/dt)=0.75, which is 3/4. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, let me double-check the partial fraction decomposition. Earlier, I found A=1/3, B=-4/3, C=-9. Let me verify this.

Given:

-36s² -24s +2 = A(4s+3)(3s+2) + B s(3s+2) + C s(4s+3).

Expanding the right side:

A*(12s² + 17s +6) + B*(3s² +2s) + C*(4s² +3s).

Grouping terms:

(12A +3B +4C) s² + (17A +2B +3C) s +6A.

Set equal to left side: -36s² -24s +2.

So, we have the system:

12A +3B +4C = -36,
17A +2B +3C = -24,
6A = 2.

From third equation: 6A=2 → A=1/3.

Substitute A=1/3 into first equation:

12*(1/3) +3B +4C = -36 → 4 +3B +4C =-36 → 3B +4C = -40.

Second equation: 17*(1/3) +2B +3C =-24 → 17/3 +2B +3C =-24 → multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate fractions:

17 +6B +9C = -72 →6B +9C = -89.

Now, we have:

3B +4C = -40 → equation (1),

6B +9C = -89 → equation (2).

Let me solve these equations.

Multiply equation (1) by 2: 6B +8C =-80 → equation (1a).

Subtract equation (1a) from equation (2):

(6B +9C) - (6B +8C) = (-89) - (-80) → C = -9.

Now, substitute C=-9 into equation (1):

3B +4*(-9)= -40 → 3B -36 =-40 →3B= -4 → B= -4/3.

So A=1/3, B=-4/3, C=-9, which matches earlier results. So the partial fractions are correct.

Thus, the inverse Laplace is correct. So the derivative at t=0+ is 2.25, which is 9/4. Looking at options, option I has v(0+)=-3 and (dv/dt)=0.75, which isn't matching. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute (dv/dt)_0+ using the limit as s approaches 0 of s² V(s).

V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [ s(4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

So s² V(s) = [ (-36s² -24s +2 ) * s ] / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

As s approaches 0, plug in s=0:

Numerator: (0 -0 +2)*0 =0.

Denominator: (3)(2)=6.

So s² V(s) approaches 0/6 =0. But according to the inverse Laplace approach, it's 2.25. There's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative calculation. Let me re-examine the derivative of v(t).

v(t) = (1/3) u(t) - (1/3) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -3 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

The derivative dv/dt is:

(1/3) δ(t) - (1/3)*(-3/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -3*(-2/3) e^{-2t/3} u(t).

Which is:

(1/3) δ(t) + (1/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) + 2 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

So, the limit as t approaches 0+ of dv/dt is 1/4 +2 = 9/4 = 2.25.

But according to the initial value theorem, it's the limit as s approaches 0 of s² V(s), which I thought was zero, but according to the inverse Laplace, it's 2.25. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the initial value theorem for (dv/dt)_0+ is actually the limit as s approaches 0 of s² V(s), but in our case, this limit is zero, which contradicts the inverse Laplace result. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the initial value theorem.

Wait, let me check the initial value theorem again. The initial value theorem states that (dv/dt)_0+ = lim_{s→0} s² V(s), provided that the final value exists and the function is differentiable at t=0. But perhaps in this case, the limit is zero, which would suggest that the derivative is zero. But that contradicts the inverse Laplace result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse Laplace approach. Let me re-express v(t) correctly.

v(t) = (1/3) u(t) - (1/3) e^{-3t/4} u(t) -3 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

So, the derivative is:

dv/dt = (1/3) δ(t) + (1/4) e^{-3t/4} u(t) + 2 e^{-2t/3} u(t).

Wait, but when taking the limit as t approaches 0+, the delta function contributes an impulse, but the continuous part is (1/4 + 2) = 9/4 =2.25. However, the initial value theorem via s² V(s) as s→0 gives zero. This inconsistency suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (dv/dt)_0+ directly from the time domain expression, ignoring the delta function, because the delta function represents an impulse at t=0, but the derivative's limit is considering only the continuous part.

So, (dv/dt)_0+ = limit as t→0+ of [ (1/4) e^{-3t/4} + 2 e^{-2t/3} ].

At t=0, this is 1/4 +2 =9/4=2.25.

But according to the initial value theorem, s² V(s) as s→0 is zero, which suggests that (dv/dt)_0+ is zero. This is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the initial value theorem.

Wait, perhaps the initial value theorem doesn't apply here because the function might have an impulse at t=0. Alternatively, maybe the function doesn't meet the conditions for the initial value theorem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition.

Wait, let me re-calculate s² V(s) as s approaches 0.

s² V(s) = [ (-36s² -24s +2 ) * s ] / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

= [ (-36s³ -24s² +2s) ] / [ (4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

As s approaches 0, the numerator is approximately 2s, and the denominator is approximately 6. So the limit is (2s)/6 = s/3 → 0 as s→0.

But according to the inverse Laplace, the derivative is 2.25. So where is the mistake?

Ah, I think I know. The initial value theorem for (dv/dt)_0+ is correct only if the function v(t) is differentiable at t=0 and certain conditions are met. Alternatively, perhaps the function has a term involving the Dirac delta function, which complicates the limit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the partial fraction decomposition more carefully.

We have:

V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [ s(4s+3)(3s+2) ) ].

We set up partial fractions as A/s + B/(4s+3) + C/(3s+2).

We found A=1/3, B=-4/3, C=-9.

Let me verify this by plugging s=1 into both sides.

Left side: V(1) = (-36 -24 +2)/(1+17+6) = (-68)/(24) = -17/6 ≈-2.8333.

Right side: A/s + B/(4s+3) + C/(3s+2) at s=1:

(1/3)/1 + (-4/3)/(7) + (-9)/5 = (1/3) - (4/21) - (9/5).

Compute:

1/3 ≈0.3333,

4/21 ≈0.1905,

9/5=1.8.

So total ≈0.3333 -0.1905 -1.8 ≈ (0.3333 -0.1905)=0.1428 -1.8≈-1.6572.

But left side was -2.8333, so this doesn't match. Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition must be incorrect.

Ah, I see the mistake. When I plugged in s=-2/3 earlier, I think I made a calculation error. Let me re-calculate C.

At s=-2/3, V(s) should satisfy:

Left side: (-36*(-2/3)^2 -24*(-2/3) +2 ) / [ (-2/3)(4*(-2/3)+3)(3*(-2/3)+2) ) ].

Compute numerator: (-36*(4/9)) +16 +2 = (-16) +16 +2= 2.

Denominator: (-2/3) * [ (-8/3 +9/3 ) ] * [ (-2 +2) ] = (-2/3)*(1/3)*0 = 0. So this approach won't work because denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't. So perhaps using s=-2/3 isn't suitable. Instead, maybe I should solve the system of equations again.

We have:

12A +3B +4C = -36,
17A +2B +3C = -24,
6A =2 → A=1/3.

Substituting A=1/3 into first equation:

12*(1/3) +3B +4C = -36 →4 +3B +4C =-36 →3B +4C =-40.

Second equation: 17*(1/3) +2B +3C =-24 → 17/3 +2B +3C =-24.

Multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate fractions:

17 +6B +9C = -72 →6B +9C =-89.

So now, we have:

3B +4C =-40 → equation (1),
6B +9C =-89 → equation (2).

Multiply equation (1) by 2: 6B +8C =-80 → equation (1a).

Subtract equation (1a) from equation (2):

(6B +9C) - (6B +8C) = (-89) - (-80) → C = -9.

Substitute C=-9 into equation (1):

3B +4*(-9) =-40 →3B -36 =-40 →3B= -4 → B= -4/3.

So A=1/3, B=-4/3, C=-9.

But when I plug s=1, the partial fractions don't match. Hmm, perhaps there's an error in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another method to find the inverse Laplace transform.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the residue method for the inverse Laplace transform, but that might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that according to the inverse Laplace approach, (dv/dt)_0+ is 2.25, which would correspond to option I: v(0+)=-3, (dv/dt)=2.25. But looking at the options, option I is listed as v(0+)=-3, (dv/dt)_0+=0.75. Wait, no, looking back, the options are:

Options:

I: v(0+)=-3, (dv/dt)_0+=0.75

Wait, no, let me check again. The options are:

A: -4, 2.25

B: -2, 3.25

C: -3,4.25

D:0,1.5

E:-3,1.25

F:-4,3.25

G:-3,0.75

H:-5,1.25

I:-3,2.25

J:-2,2.25

Wait, option I is v(0+)=-3, (dv/dt)=2.25, which matches our inverse Laplace result.

But earlier, when I tried s² V(s) as s→0, I got zero, which contradicts this. Therefore, perhaps the initial value theorem isn't applicable here, or I made a mistake in applying it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should rely on the inverse Laplace result, which gives (dv/dt)_0+=2.25, and v(0+)=-3. So the correct option is I: v(0+)=-3, (dv/dt)=2.25.

The problem involves finding \( v(0^+) \) and \( \left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} \) given the Laplace transform \( V(s) = \frac{-36s^2 - 24s + 2}{12s^3 + 17s^2 + 6s} \). 

### Step 1: Finding \( v(0^+) \)
Using the initial value theorem:
\[
v(0^+) = \lim_{s \to \infty} sV(s)
\]
Substitute \( V(s) \):
\[
v(0^+) = \lim_{s \to \infty} s \cdot \frac{-36s^2 - 24s + 2}{12s^3 + 17s^2 + 6s}
\]
Divide numerator and denominator by \( s^3 \):
\[
v(0^+) = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{-36/s - 24/s^2 + 2/s^3}{12 + 17/s + 6/s^2} = \frac{-36}{12} = -3
\]

### Step 2: Finding \( \left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} \)
Using the initial value theorem for the derivative:
\[
\left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2 V(s)
\]
Substitute \( V(s) \):
\[
\left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2 \cdot \frac{-36s^2 - 24s + 2}{12s^3 + 17s^2 + 6s}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} = \lim_{s \to 0} \frac{-36s^4 - 24s^3 + 2s^2}{12s^3 + 17s^2 + 6s}
\]
As \( s \to 0 \), the dominant terms in the numerator and denominator are \( 2s^2 \) and \( 6s \), respectively:
\[
\left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} = \frac{2s^2}{6s} = \frac{s}{3} \to 0
\]
However, this result contradicts the inverse Laplace transform approach, which gives \( \left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} = 2.25 \). Therefore, the correct values are \( v(0^+) = -3 \) and \( \left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)_{0^+} = 2.25 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **I**.
