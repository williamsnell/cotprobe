Okay, so I need to figure out how many triangles have integer side lengths where the maximum side is exactly 11. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the triangle inequality must hold. That means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Also, since the maximum side is 11, one of the sides must be 11, and the other two sides must be less than or equal to 11.

Wait, but the problem says the maximum side equals 11. So, at least one side is 11, and the other two are less than or equal to 11, but all sides are integers. So, I'm looking for all triplets (a, b, c) where a ≤ b ≤ c =11, and a + b > c.

Since c is 11, I can fix c =11 and find the number of pairs (a, b) such that a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b >11.

So, let's consider that. a and b can range from 1 to 11, but with a ≤ b ≤11. But they also have to satisfy a + b >11.

Let me think about how to count these pairs.

Since a ≤ b, I can let a vary from 1 up to some maximum, and for each a, determine the possible b's.

But wait, since a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b >11, for each a, b must be >11 - a and also ≥a.

So for each a, the minimum b is max(a, 12 - a). Because b must be at least a (since a ≤ b) and b must be greater than 11 - a (since a + b >11).

But wait, let's see: a + b >11 ⇒ b >11 -a. Since b is an integer, b ≥12 -a.

But since a ≤ b, the lower bound for b is the maximum of a and (12 - a). So for each a, the number of possible b's is the number of integers from max(a, 12 -a) to 11, inclusive.

So let's compute this for each a from 1 to 11.

Wait, but a can't be too large because when a is larger than 11, but since a ≤11, a goes up to 11.

Let me make a table:

a | possible b starts at | possible b's | count
---|--------------------|--------------|-------
1 | max(1, 12-1)=11 | b from 11 to11 → 1 value | 1
2 | max(2,10)=10 | b from10 to11 → 2 values |2
3 | max(3,9)=9 | b from9 to11 →3 values |3
4 | max(4,8)=8 | b from8 to11 →4 values |4
5 | max(5,7)=7 | b from7 to11 →5 values |5
6 | max(6,6)=6 | b from6 to11 →6 values |6
7 | max(7,5)=7 | b from7 to11 →5 values |5
8 | max(8,4)=8 | b from8 to11 →4 values |4
9 | max(9,3)=9 | b from9 to11 →3 values |3
10 | max(10,2)=10 | b from10 to11 →2 values |2
11 | max(11,1)=11 | b=11 →1 value |1

Wait, let me check each a:

a=1: b must be ≥11 (since 12-1=11) and ≤11. So only b=11. So count=1.

a=2: b must be ≥10 (since 12-2=10) and ≤11. So b=10,11 → count=2.

a=3: b ≥9 → 9,10,11 →3.

a=4: b≥8 →8,9,10,11→4.

a=5: b≥7 →7,8,9,10,11→5.

a=6: b≥6 →6,7,8,9,10,11→6.

a=7: b must be ≥max(7, 12-7=5)=7. So b starts at7. So b=7,8,9,10,11 →5.

a=8: b≥8 (since 12-8=4, but a=8, so max(8,4)=8). So b=8,9,10,11 →4.

a=9: b≥9 (12-9=3 <9), so b=9,10,11 →3.

a=10: b≥10 (12-10=2 <10), so b=10,11 →2.

a=11: b≥11, so b=11 →1.

Now, sum all the counts:

a=1:1

a=2:2 → total 3

a=3:3 →6

a=4:4 →10

a=5:5 →15

a=6:6 →21

a=7:5 →26

a=8:4 →30

a=9:3 →33

a=10:2 →35

a=11:1 →36.

Wait, adding them up: 1+2=3, +3=6, +4=10, +5=15, +6=21, +5=26, +4=30, +3=33, +2=35, +1=36.

So total 36 triangles.

Wait, but the options include B:36, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the counts.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider all possible triplets where c=11, and a ≤ b ≤11, with a + b >11.

Alternatively, the number of triangles with maximum side 11 is equal to the number of integer solutions where a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b >11.

Another way to compute this is to note that for each a from 1 to 11, the number of b's is as calculated above.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total number of possible (a, b) pairs where a ≤ b ≤11, and a + b >11.

The total number of possible (a, b) where a ≤ b and b ≤11 is the same as the number of pairs with a ≤ b ≤11. The total number of such pairs is the sum from a=1 to 11 of (11 - a +1). But wait, that's the total number without considering the triangle inequality.

But since we need a + b >11, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of pairs where a ≤ b ≤11, and subtract those where a + b ≤11.

Wait, maybe that's another approach.

Total number of pairs where a ≤ b ≤11 is the sum for a from 1 to 11 of (11 - a +1) = sum from a=1 to11 of (12 -a) → which is 11 +10 +9 +...+1 = (11*12)/2 =66.

Now, the number of pairs where a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b ≤11. Let's calculate that.

For each a from 1 up to a certain point, find the maximum b such that a + b ≤11 and b ≥a.

So for a=1: b can be from 1 to 10 (since 1 +11=12 >11, so b ≤10. Since a=1, b can be 1 to 10, but since a ≤ b, b starts at 1.

Wait no: a=1, then b can be from 1 to (11 -a)=10, but since a ≤b, the maximum b is 10. So number of b's is 10 -1 +1=10.

Wait, no: a=1, b can be from 1 to10 (since 1+10=11). So for a=1, b can be 1 to10, but since a ≤b, the possible b's are from 1 to10, but a=1, so b can be 1,2,...,10, but a ≤b, which it is. So for a=1, number of b's is 10.

Wait, but wait: when a=1, b can be from a=1 to min(11, 11 -a)=10.

So for a=1, b can be 1 to10 →10 values.

a=2: a +b ≤11 →b ≤9. But since b ≥a=2, b can be 2 to9 →8 values.

a=3: b ≤8, and b≥3 →6 values.

a=4: b ≤7, and b≥4 →4 values.

a=5: b ≤6, and b≥5 →2 values.

a=6: b ≤5, but since b must be ≥6 (a=6), no possible b. So 0.

Similarly, a=7 and above: a=7, b must be ≥7, but 7+7=14>11, so no solutions. So for a=7 to11, the number of b's is 0.

So the total number of pairs where a ≤b and a +b ≤11 is 10 (a=1) +8 (a=2)+6 (a=3)+4 (a=4)+2 (a=5) =10+8=18+6=24+4=28+2=30.

So total pairs where a ≤b ≤11 and a +b ≤11 is 30.

Earlier, total pairs without triangle inequality is 66.

So the number of valid triangles is 66 -30=36.

Yes, that matches the earlier count.

So the answer is 36, which is option B.
</think>

The number of triangles with integer sides where the maximum side is 11 is calculated by considering all pairs (a, b) such that a ≤ b ≤ 11 and a + b > 11. Using combinatorial counting, the total valid triangles are 36.

Answer: B
