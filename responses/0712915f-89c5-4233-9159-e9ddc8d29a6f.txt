Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a simple pendulum attached to a support that's moving upward with a constant acceleration. The question is asking for the period of small oscillations. Hmm, I remember that for a simple pendulum, the period usually depends on the length and the gravitational acceleration. But this time, the support is accelerating, so I guess that's going to affect things.

Let me start by recalling the formula for the period of a simple pendulum. Normally, it's T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But here, the support is moving upward with acceleration a. So I think the effective gravity experienced by the pendulum bob will change because of this acceleration.

Wait, right, when the support accelerates upward, the effective gravity isn't just g anymore. The effective acceleration, let's call it g', would be g + a? Or is it g - a? Oh, no, wait. If the support is accelerating upward at a, then from the perspective of the bob, the acceleration due to gravity is effectively increased. Because when the support moves up, the bob feels a little more gravity. So g' should be g + a, right? Or wait, maybe I'm getting it backwards. Let me think: if the support is accelerating upward, the apparent gravity increases. So the effective gravity is g_eff = g + a.

Wait, no, wait a second. When the support is accelerating upward with acceleration a, the apparent gravitational acceleration as seen by the pendulum would be the sum of the actual gravity and the acceleration of the support. Since the support is moving upward, that adds to the effective gravity. So g_eff = g + a. So the pendulum's period would be T = 2π√(L/g_eff) = 2π√(L/(g+a)).

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option J is 2π√(b/(a+g)), which matches this. But wait, looking at the options, let me check. Option J is exactly that, with b instead of L (since the length is b). So if I'm right, the period should be option J.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't get the direction wrong. If the support accelerates upward, the effective gravity is the actual gravity plus the support's acceleration. Because from the pendulum's point of view, it's like the gravity is stronger. So yes, g_eff = g + a.

Alternatively, sometimes problems have the support moving downward, which would make g_eff = g - a, but in that case, a has to be less than g to have a positive effective gravity. But here, the support is moving upward, so adding a to g makes sense.

Wait, another approach: Let's model the forces. The bob's mass is m, and the support is moving upward with acceleration a. So in the frame of the support, which is non-inertial, there's a pseudo-force acting downward. The real gravitational force is mg downward, and the pseudo-force is ma downward as well. So the effective force is m(g + a) downward. Therefore, the effective gravity is g_eff = g + a. So the period is T = 2π√(L/(g_eff)) = 2π√(b/(g+a)), which is option J.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option J is 2π√(b/(a+g)), which is the same as 2π√(b/(g+a)), so that's correct. So I think the answer is option J.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might get confused between upward and downward. If the support were moving downward with acceleration a, then the effective gravity would be g - a? Or g + a? No, if the support accelerates upward, the effective gravity is g + a. If it were moving downward, then perhaps g_eff = g - a, but only if a < g. Otherwise, it would flip signs, but in this problem, the support's acceleration is upward, so a is positive in that direction.

So yeah, the period is T = 2π√(b/(g + a)), which is option J.
</think>

The period of a simple pendulum in an accelerated frame is determined by the effective gravitational acceleration. When the support accelerates upward with acceleration \( a \), the effective gravity becomes \( g_{\text{eff}} = g + a \). The period formula \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g_{\text{eff}}}} \) then gives \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{b}{g + a}} \), which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
