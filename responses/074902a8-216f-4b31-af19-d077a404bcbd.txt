How has the way psychologists view infants changed over the years?

Options:

A: Psychologists now emphasize the functions that an infant can perform considering his lack of development and learning abilities.

E: Psychologists now understand infants to communicate at the same level as adults.
F: Psychologists consider infants to be miniature adults with all capacities developed.
G: Psychologists still view infants as inadequate and passive humans.
H: Psychologists no longer study infant behavior.
I: Psychologists view infants as being influenced only by genetics, with no impact from their environment.
J: Psychologists now view infants as fully developed humans.

Alright, so I've got this question about how psychologists' views on infants have changed over the years. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think about what I know about the history of psychology, especially regarding infants.

From what I remember, in the past, infants were often seen as passive and not capable of much. Like, people thought they couldn't think or reason much. But more recent research, especially from developmental psychologists like Jean Piaget, showed that infants are actually more capable than previously thought. Piaget's work focused on how children develop cognitive abilities, and he found that even infants have some understanding of the world around them.

Looking at the options:

Option A says psychologists now emphasize the functions infants can perform despite their lack of development. That sounds a bit old-fashioned, like maybe it's referring to a time when infants were seen as limited. But I think the shift was more towards recognizing their capabilities, not just their limitations.

Option B claims infants are capable of complex reasoning like adults. That might be a bit too much. I don't think infants are on the same level as adults in reasoning, but they do show surprising abilities. So maybe this isn't the best choice.

Option C suggests infants' behavior is random and not showing cognitive processes. That sounds like an older view, not the current one. Recent research shows there's a lot of method in their behavior.

Option D says no learning until toddler age. I know that's not true because infants learn through their environment from a very young age, like through imitation and conditioning.

Option E is about communicating at the same level as adults. Again, that seems too extreme. Infants do communicate, but it's more basic, like crying and cooing, which still shows they're capable of communication.

Option F says infants are like miniature adults. That doesn't sound right because they clearly have different cognitive abilities and are still developing.

Option G says they're viewed as inadequate and passive. That was the old view, but modern psychology has moved away from that, recognizing infants' active role in their development.

Option H suggests psychologists no longer study infant behavior. That's definitely not true; there's a lot of research ongoing in that area.

Option I claims only genetics matters, no environment. That's incorrect because environmental factors are crucial, especially for infants.

Option J says infants are fully developed humans. That seems more accurate. Modern views recognize that infants have the potential for growth and are active participants in their development, even if they're not yet capable of everything.

So putting it together, the shift has been from seeing infants as passive and limited to understanding they're fully developed humans with the capacity to learn and grow. Therefore, the answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: Psychologists now view infants as fully developed humans. This reflects the shift from older views that saw infants as passive and limited to recognizing their potential and active role in development.

Answer: J
