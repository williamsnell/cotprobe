Okay, so I have this gas law problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

The problem says: A 5000 cm³ container holds 4.90 grams of a gas when the pressure is 75.0 cm Hg and the temperature is 50°C. Then, the question is, what will the pressure be if 6.00 grams of this gas is confined in a 2000 cm³ container at 0°C?

Hmm, okay. So I think the key here is to use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But wait, since we're dealing with different conditions, maybe I should compare the two scenarios using the combined gas law. Or perhaps using the ideal gas equation for both cases and relate them.

Wait, let's see. The initial conditions are:
- Volume V1 = 5000 cm³
- Mass m1 = 4.90 g
- Pressure P1 = 75.0 cm Hg
- Temperature T1 = 50°C, which is 323.15 K (since 50 + 273.15).

The final conditions are:
- Volume V2 = 2000 cm³
- Mass m2 = 6.00 g
- Temperature T2 = 0°C, which is 273.15 K.

We need to find P2.

I remember that when dealing with gases, the number of moles (n) is mass divided by molar mass (M). But wait, the molar mass isn't given, so maybe I can relate the two situations by considering the change in moles, volume, and temperature.

Alternatively, since the gas is the same in both cases, maybe I can use the combined gas law for two states. But wait, the number of moles changes, so maybe I should use the ideal gas law for each state and then relate them.

Wait, let's think. For the initial state, n1 = m1/M, and for the final state, n2 = m2/M. Since M is constant, I can write n1 = (4.90g)/M and n2 = (6.00g)/M. Then, for each state, PV = nRT.

So for initial state: P1 V1 = n1 R T1
For final state: P2 V2 = n2 R T2

If I take the ratio of these two equations, (P2 V2)/(P1 V1) = (n2 T2)/(n1 T1)

Plugging in the values, but since n2/n1 = (m2/M)/(m1/M) )= m2/m1.

So n2/n1 = 6.00 / 4.90 ≈ 1.2245.

Similarly, T2/T1 = (273.15)/(323.15) ≈ 0.8456.

So now, putting it all together:

P2 = P1 * (n2/n1) * (T2/T1) * (V1/V2)

Wait, because when you take the ratio of P2 V2 / P1 V1 = (n2 T2)/(n1 T1), so rearranged:

P2 = P1 * (n2/n1) * (T2/T1) * (V1/V2)

Wait, let me double-check that. Let's write the ratio:

P2 V2 / P1 V1 = (n2 R T2)/(n1 R T1) → the R cancels.

So,

P2 V2 = (n2/n1) * (T2/T1) * P1 V1

Then,

P2 = P1 * (n2/n1) * (T2/T1) * (V1/V2)

Yes, that's correct.

So now, plug in the numbers.

First, calculate each part step by step.

n2/n1 = 6.00 / 4.90 ≈ 1.22449.

T2/T1 = 273.15 / 323.15 ≈ 0.8456.

V1/V2 = 5000 / 2000 = 2.5.

So now, multiply all together with P1.

P1 is 75.0 cm Hg.

So P2 = 75.0 * 1.22449 * 0.8456 * 2.5

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 1.22449 * 0.8456 = ?

1.22449 * 0.8 = 0.979592
1.22449 * 0.0456 ≈ 0.05591 (approx 0.0456 * 1.22449 ≈ 0.0559)
So total ≈ 0.979592 + 0.0559 ≈ 1.0355.

Wait, perhaps better to calculate accurately:

1.22449 * 0.8456 ≈ Let's compute 1.22449 * 0.8456.

Let me do this step by step.

1.22449 * 0.8 = 0.979592
1.22449 * 0.04 = 0.0489796
1.22449 * 0.005 = 0.00612245
1.22449 * 0.0006 = 0.000734694

Adding these together:

0.979592 + 0.0489796 = 1.0285716
+0.00612245 = 1.03469405
+0.000734694 ≈ 1.0354287.

So about 1.0354.

Now multiply by 2.5: 1.0354 * 2.5.

1.0354 * 2 = 2.0708
1.0354 * 0.5 = 0.5177
Total ≈ 2.0708 + 0.5177 = 2.5885.

Now, P2 = 75.0 cm Hg * 2.5885 ≈ 75 * 2.5885.

Calculating 75 * 2=150, 75 * 0.5885= approx 75 * 0.5=37.5 and 75 * 0.0885≈6.6375. So total about 37.5 +6.6375=44.1375.

So 150 +44.1375=194.1375 cm Hg.

Looking at the options, option C is 194 cm Hg. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, another approach: 75 * 2.5885.

Well, 75 * 2 = 150, 75 * 0.5 = 37.5, 75 * 0.0885= approx 6.6375.

Adding 150 +37.5 =187.5, plus 6.6375=194.1375 cm Hg.

Yes, that seems correct. So the pressure is approximately 194 cm Hg, which is option C.

The problem involves using the ideal gas law to determine the pressure of a gas under different conditions. By applying the combined gas law and considering the changes in mass, volume, and temperature, the pressure is calculated to be approximately 194 cm Hg.
