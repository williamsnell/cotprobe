Question:

Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock that were purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. In year 4 Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock.

E: $6,000
F: $8,000
G: $16,000
H: $10,000
I: $12,000
J: $9,600

Okay, so I've got this question about Lemon's basis in some stock they sold. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question says Lemon owns 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock. These were purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. So, the initial cost basis is 2000 times $10.50. Let me calculate that: 2000 * 10.50 = $21,000. So, Lemon's total basis starts at $21,000.

Then, in year 4, Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend in the form of more Spectrol common stock. Wait, non-taxable dividends, like maybe they're tax-exempt? So, the dividend is 5% of the shares. 5% of 2000 is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. But since this is a stock dividend, how does this affect the basis? I think for stock dividends, if it's non-taxable, the basis is adjusted. The basis per share would be the original total basis divided by the new total shares.

So, original basis was $21,000 for 2000 shares. After the dividend, there are 2100 shares. So, the basis per share becomes 21,000 / 2100 = $10 per share. Okay, so each share now has a basis of $10, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The dividend is non-taxable, so the cost basis is spread out over the new total shares. So, yes, the basis per share becomes 21,000 / 2100 = $10.

Next, in year 5, the stock split 2-for-1. A 2-for-1 split means each share becomes two. So, Lemon's 2100 shares become 4200 shares. How does the basis change here? I think in a stock split, the basis per share is halved. Because splitting doesn't change the value; it just creates more shares. So, the basis per share was $10 before the split. After the split, each share's basis is $10 / 2 = $5 per share. So, each of the 4200 shares has a basis of $5, totaling 4200 * 5 = $21,000, which makes sense because the split doesn't change the total basis.

Now, in the current year, Lemon sold 800 shares. The question is: What's Lemon's basis in those 800 shares? So, we need to find the basis per share after the split, then multiply by 800.

Wait, let me double-check. After the split, each share's basis is $5. So, 800 shares would have a basis of 800 * 5 = $4,000. Looking at the options, option C is $4,000. That seems right.

But wait, I should make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each step again:

1. Purchase: 2000 shares at $10.50 each: 2000 * 10.5 = $21,000 total basis.

2. Year 4: 5% stock dividend. 5% of 2000 is 100 shares. So, total shares become 2100. The basis is now $21,000 / 2100 = $10 per share.

3. Year 5: 2-for-1 split. Shares go from 2100 to 4200. Basis per share is $10 / 2 = $5.

4. Sold 800 shares: 800 * $5 = $4,000.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be option C: $4,000.

The basis for the 800 shares sold is calculated by determining the basis per share after the stock split and multiplying by the number of shares sold. After the split, each share has a basis of $5, so 800 shares have a basis of $4,000.

Answer: C
