Okay, so I've got this problem about a transformer's efficiency, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says it's a 10kVA distribution transformer with a 240V secondary winding. The equivalent internal resistance of the transformer, referred to that winding, is 0.048 ohms. Also, the core loss is 75W. The question is asking at what kVA load the transformer operates at maximum efficiency.

Hmm, I remember that transformers have two main losses: core losses and load losses. Core losses are basically the losses that occur even when there's no load, like hysteresis and eddy current losses in the core. Load losses, on the other hand, are the losses due to current flowing through the transformer's windings, which depend on the load.

Efficiency of a transformer is calculated as (Output Power) / (Input Power) and usually expressed as a percentage. But to find the maximum efficiency, I think I need to consider when the sum of these losses is minimized relative to the output.

Wait, no, maximum efficiency occurs when the load losses are balanced against the core losses. I think the formula is that the maximum efficiency happens when the load current squared equals the core loss divided by the load loss per unit load.

Wait, more accurately, the formula I remember is that the maximum efficiency occurs when the load current (I) is such that I² * R = (Core Loss) / (Efficiency). Or perhaps it's when the copper loss equals the core loss. Because if the copper loss (which is I²R) equals the core loss, then the total loss would be minimized, leading to maximum efficiency.

So, I think the condition for maximum efficiency is when copper losses equal core losses. Let me write that down.

Copper loss (I² * R) = Core loss (75W)

So, I² * 0.048 = 75.

I need to solve for I.

Let me compute that:

I² = 75 / 0.048

Let me calculate that. 75 divided by 0.048. Hmm, 75 / 0.048 is the same as 75 * (1/0.048) which is approximately 75 * 20.8333. Let me compute that: 75 * 20 = 1500, 75 * 0.8333 ≈65. So total is approximately 1565. So I² ≈ 1565.

So I is sqrt(1565). Let me calculate that. sqrt(1600) is 40, so sqrt(1565) is a bit less, say around 39.58 or so. Let's approximate I as 39.6 A.

Now, the secondary voltage is 240V, so the power at the secondary when the load is I is I * V. Wait, but wait, the load power is I * V, but the transformer's rating is 10 kVA. Let me check: 10 kVA is 10,000 VA, which is 10,000 volts-amps.

So, when the current is I, the kVA load is (I * V) / 1000.

Wait, but in this case, the secondary voltage is 240V, so the power would be I * 240, and then divided by 1000 to get kVA.

So, Power (kVA) = (I * 240) / 1000.

We have I ≈39.6 A.

So, 39.6 * 240 = let's calculate that: 40 * 240 is 9600, minus 0.4 *240=96, so 9600 -96=9504 W, which is 9.504 kVA.

Wait, but the transformer's rated capacity is 10 kVA. So 9.504 is about 95% of 10 kVA. So the load is 95% of the rated load.

Wait, but let me check again. Because 39.6 A * 240 V equals 9504 W, which is 9.504 kVA. So that's 95.04% of 10 kVA, which is approximately 95% of the rated load.

So the answer should be D: 95% of rated load.

Wait, but wait, let me check if I did all the calculations correctly. Let me redo the I² calculation.

I² = 75 / 0.048 = 75 ÷ 0.048.

0.048 * 1500 = 72 (since 0.048 *1000=48, 0.048*500=24, together 48+24=72), so 75 is 3 more than 72. So 3/0.048 is 62.5. So 1500 + 62.5 = 1562.5. So I²=1562.5, so I = sqrt(1562.5) = 39.52 A.

So, 39.52 A * 240 V = 39.52 *240. Let's compute that:

39 *240=9360, 0.52*240=124.8. So total is 9360 +124.8=9484.8 W, which is 9.4848 kVA, so approximately 94.85% of 10kVA. That's about 95%, so option D is 95% of rated load.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the maximum efficiency occurs when copper loss equals core loss. So the formula is I^2 R = P_core.

Yes, that's correct. So I think the approach is right. So the answer is D: 95% of rated load.

To determine the load at which the transformer operates at maximum efficiency, we use the condition where copper losses equal core losses. The copper loss is given by \( I^2 R \), where \( R = 0.048 \, \Omega \), and the core loss is \( 75 \, \text{W} \). Setting these equal:

\[
I^2 \cdot 0.048 = 75
\]

Solving for \( I \):

\[
I^2 = \frac{75}{0.048} \approx 1562.5
\]
\[
I \approx \sqrt{1562.5} \approx 39.52 \, \text{A}
\]

The power output at this current is:

\[
\text{Power} = I \cdot V = 39.52 \cdot 240 \approx 9484.8 \, \text{W} = 9.4848 \, \text{kVA}
\]

This is approximately \( 95\% \) of the transformer's rated capacity of \( 10 \, \text{kVA} \). Therefore, the transformer operates at maximum efficiency when the load is \( 95\% \) of the rated load.
