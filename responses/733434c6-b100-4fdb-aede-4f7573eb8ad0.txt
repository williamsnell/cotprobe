Question:

A surgeon operated on a patient in an operating room in the Marina General Hospital. The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will

Options:

A: prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur
B: not prevail, because the intern was the one who agreed to the settlement.
C: not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.
D: not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.
E: not prevail, because the nurse was just following the intern's orders.
F: not prevail, because the intern already accepted a settlement.
G: prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.
H: prevail, because both were equally responsible for the patient's pain.
I: prevail, because the nurse was also involved in the faulty bandaging.
J: prevail, because the nurse should have known better as a staff member of the hospital.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about contribution and settlements. Let me read through the scenario again and break it down.

So, a surgeon operated on a patient at Marina General Hospital. The surgeon was helped by an intern and a nurse, both assigned by the hospital. After the operation, the patient had some unexplained pain. Turns out the intern and nurse bandaged him incorrectly, which constricted blood vessels, causing pain and slowing recovery.

The patient sued the intern for $20k. Before trial, they settled for $12k, and the patient released the intern from further claims. Now, the intern is suing the nurse for contribution. The question is about whether the intern will prevail.

I remember that contribution is about sharing liability when multiple parties are responsible for a tort. Each party can be held liable for the entire damage, but they can seek contribution from others who were also at fault. But there are some rules, especially regarding settlements.

In this case, the intern settled with the patient without a judgment. So, can the intern still seek contribution from the nurse? I think there's a rule that if a defendant settles without a judgment, they can't recover contribution from other defendants. Because once they settle, they're releasing the other parties from liability as well. Or maybe it's because the settlement amount might not be considered a judgment against the intern, so they can't claim contribution.

Looking at the options:

A: Prevail because res ipsa loquitur. That's Latin for "the thing speaks for itself," meaning the facts show negligence obvious. But I don't think that's the main issue here. The question is about contribution after a settlement.

B: Not prevail because intern settled. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the reason.

C: Not prevail because proper remedy is indemnification. Indemnification is when one party compensates another for legal liability. But I think contribution is different from indemnity. Contribution is about shared liability, while indemnity is about being reimbursed by another party who is more responsible.

D: Not prevail because settled without judgment. This rings a bell. I think the rule is that you can't recover contribution if you settle without a judgment because you're deemed to have released the other parties.

E: Not prevail because nurse was following orders. That might be a defense if the nurse was under the intern's direction, but respondeat superior is about employer liability, not necessarily about individual contribution. Plus, the question says both were involved in the faulty bandaging, so maybe the nurse had her own negligence.

F: Same as D, but phrased differently. Not prevail because settled.

G: Prevail because settled without judgment can recover. Wait, I thought the opposite. If you settle without judgment, you can't recover contribution because you can't prove liability was established.

H: Prevail because both equally responsible. Equal responsibility might make them both liable, but if the intern settled without a judgment, that might not matter.

I: Prevail because nurse was involved. Again, the issue is about whether the intern can recover after settling.

J: Prevail because nurse should have known better. That might be a point, but the main issue is the settlement.

So, the key point seems to be that when a defendant settles without a judgment, they cannot seek contribution from others because they're considered to have released them. Therefore, the correct answer would be D or F, which both suggest the intern cannot recover because they settled without judgment.

Looking at the options, D says "not prevail because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution." That seems correct. So the answer should be D.

The intern's ability to seek contribution from the nurse hinges on the legal principle that a party who settles a claim without a judgment cannot recover contribution from other potential liable parties. In this case, the intern settled with the patient for $12,000 and released the patient from further claims, which precludes the intern from pursuing contribution from the nurse. Therefore, the intern will not prevail in this suit.

Answer: D
