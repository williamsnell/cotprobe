<think>
Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure out the Gibbs free-energy change at the spontaneous solidification temperature of copper. Hmm, let's see. I remember that Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is related to the spontaneity of a reaction. The formula I think is ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°, right? But wait, I think I might have that backwards sometimes. Oh no, no, I'm pretty sure it's ΔG equals enthalpy change minus temperature times entropy change. Yeah, that's right.

The problem says the spontaneous solidification temperature for copper is 1,120 K, and the melting point is 1,356 K. The reaction given is Cu^_1 (I'm assuming that's the liquid) turning into Cu_s (solid), with a ΔH° of -3,100 cal at 1,356 K. Oh, wait, that's the melting point, so at that temperature, the solid and liquid are in equilibrium. But here, we're looking at a lower temperature, 1,120 K, which is below the melting point, so solidification is spontaneous. That makes sense.

The ΔCp is given as -2.09 + 1.5e-3 T. So, the heat capacity change is temperature-dependent. I think I need to calculate the entropy change (ΔS) using the integral of ΔCp over temperature. Because entropy is the integral of dQ_rev / T, and since ΔCp is the change in heat capacity, I can integrate that from the initial temperature (T1) to the final temperature (T2).

Wait, but what's the initial and final state here? Oh, right, we're going from liquid to solid. So the process is cooling from the melting point (1356 K) to the spontaneous solidification temperature (1120 K). So I need to calculate the entropy change for this temperature change.

The formula for entropy change when heat capacity is variable is ΔS = ∫(ΔCp / T) dT from T1 to T2. So in this case, T1 is 1356 K, and T2 is 1120 K.

So first, I'll set up the integral:

ΔS = ∫(from 1356 to 1120) [ (-2.09 + 1.5e-3 T ) / T ] dT

Breaking that down, the integrand is [ (-2.09)/T + (1.5e-3) ). Because 1.5e-3 T divided by T is 1.5e-3.

So the integral becomes:

ΔS = ∫ [ (-2.09)/T + 0.0015 ] dT from 1356 to 1120.

Which can be split into two parts:

ΔS = (-2.09) ∫(1/T) dT + 0.0015 ∫ dT.

The integral of 1/T dT is ln(T), and the integral of 1 dT is T. So,

ΔS = (-2.09)[ln(T)] from 1356 to 1120 + 0.0015 [T] from 1356 to 1120.

Let me compute each part.

First part: (-2.09)(ln(1120) - ln(1356)) = (-2.09)(ln(1120/1356)).

Calculating 1120 / 1356 ≈ 0.826. So ln(0.826) ≈ -0.1905. So multiplying by -2.09 gives:

(-2.09)(-0.1905) ≈ 0.398 cal/(mol·K)

Second part: 0.0015*(1120 - 1356) = 0.0015*(-236) ≈ -0.354 cal/(mol·K)

So total ΔS = 0.398 - 0.354 ≈ 0.044 cal/(mol·K)

Wait, that's a very small entropy change. Hmm. But let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 1120/1356 is approximately 0.826, yes. Ln(0.826) is about -0.1905. So (-2.09) * (-0.1905) is indeed about 0.398. Then the second term is 0.0015*(1120 -1356) = 0.0015*(-236) = -0.354. So 0.398 - 0.354 is 0.044 cal/(mol·K). That seems correct.

Now, the Gibbs free energy change at 1120 K is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

Wait, but wait. The ΔH given is at 1356 K, the melting point. So when we're calculating ΔG at a different temperature (1120 K), we need to adjust ΔH using the ΔCp and the temperature change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute ΔH at 1120 K first. Because the reaction is at a different temperature, so ΔH might change. Or wait, the reaction's ΔH is given at 1356 K, so perhaps I need to adjust it to 1120 K.

Wait, the formula for ΔH at another temperature is ΔH2 = ΔH1 + ∫(ΔCp) dT from T1 to T2.

So, T1 is 1356 K, T2 is 1120 K.

So,

ΔH at 1120 K = ΔH at 1356 K + ∫(ΔCp) dT from 1356 to 1120.

ΔH° = -3100 cal at 1356 K.

So,

ΔH = -3100 + ∫(from 1356 to 1120) [ (-2.09 + 1.5e-3 T) ] dT.

Compute the integral:

∫ [ -2.09 + 0.0015 T ] dT from 1356 to 1120.

= [ -2.09 T + 0.00075 T² ] evaluated from 1356 to 1120.

So,

At 1120: (-2.09 * 1120) + (0.00075 * 1120²)
At 1356: (-2.09 * 1356) + (0.00075 * 1356²)

Subtract the lower limit from the upper limit.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute at 1120:

-2.09 * 1120 = -2350.8

0.00075 * (1120)^2 = 0.00075 * 1,254,400 = 940.8

So sum is -2350.8 + 940.8 = -1410.

At 1356:

-2.09 * 1356 ≈ Let's compute 2.09 * 1356. 2 *1356=2712, 0.09*1356=122.04 → total 2834.04. So negative is -2834.04.

0.00075 * (1356)^2 = 0.00075 * 1,839,  I think 1356^2 is 1,839,  let me compute 1356 * 1356.

Wait, 1356 * 1356: Let me compute 1350^2 = (1300 +50)^2 = 1300² + 2*1300*50 +50² = 1,690,000 + 130,000 + 2,500 = 1,822,500. Then, 1356 is 1350 +6, so (1350+6)^2 = 1350² + 2*1350*6 +6² = 1,822,500 + 16,200 +36 = 1,838,736.

So 0.00075 * 1,838,736 ≈ 1,838,736 * 0.00075 = 1,379.052.

So at 1356, the value is -2834.04 + 1379.052 ≈ -1454.988.

Now, subtract the lower limit (1356) from the upper limit (1120):

(-1410) - (-1454.988) = -1410 +1454.988 ≈ 44.988 cal.

So, the integral is about 44.988 cal.

Thus, ΔH at 1120 K is:

ΔH = -3100 + 44.988 ≈ -3055.012 cal.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the integral is positive, so ΔH increases by about 45 cal, making it less negative. So from -3100, adding 45 gives -3055 cal.

Wait, but in Gibbs free energy, we use the ΔH at the temperature in question, which is 1120 K, so that would be -3055 cal.

Now, the entropy change ΔS we calculated earlier is approximately 0.044 cal/(mol·K).

So, T is 1120 K.

So, TΔS = 1120 * 0.044 ≈ 49.28 cal.

Now, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = (-3055) - (49.28) ≈ -3055 -49.28 = -3104.28 cal.

Wait, but that's nearly -3100 cal, but looking at the options, the closest is option B: -500 cal, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the signs in calculating ΔS. Let me go back.

Wait, the reaction is Cu(l) → Cu(s). So the system is going from liquid to solid. Enthalpy change is exothermic, so ΔH is negative, which it is (-3100 cal at 1356 K).

Now, when we calculated ΔS, we got 0.044 cal/(mol·K). But wait, when a substance solidifies, the entropy decreases because the solid is more ordered than the liquid. So the entropy change should be negative. But I got a positive value, which suggests I might have an error in the calculation.

Let me double-check the integral.

ΔS = ∫(ΔCp / T) dT from 1356 to 1120.

ΔCp is given as (-2.09 + 1.5e-3 T).

So,

ΔCp = -2.09 + 0.0015 T.

So,

ΔS = ∫ [ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T ) / T ] dT
= ∫ [ -2.09 / T + 0.0015 ] dT.

Integrating from 1356 to 1120.

So,

ΔS = (-2.09) [ln(T)] from 1356 to 1120 + 0.0015 [T] from 1356 to 1120.

Compute each part.

First term: (-2.09)(ln(1120) - ln(1356)).

Which is (-2.09)(ln(1120/1356)).

As before, 1120/1356 ≈ 0.826.

ln(0.826) ≈ -0.1905.

So,

(-2.09)(-0.1905) ≈ 0.398 cal/(mol·K).

Second term: 0.0015*(1120 - 1356) = 0.0015*(-236) ≈ -0.354 cal/(mol·K).

So total ΔS = 0.398 - 0.354 = 0.044 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but that's a positive entropy change. But when a liquid solidifies, entropy should decrease, so ΔS should be negative. So I must have made a mistake here.

Ah, wait! Because we're integrating from higher temperature (1356) to lower (1120), the limits are from higher to lower. So maybe I should reverse them. Because when calculating entropy change, the formula is ∫(T_initial to T_final) of (dS) = ∫(T_initial to T_final) (dQ/T). But when T decreases, perhaps the sign is different.

Wait, no, the integral is from higher T to lower T, which is T1 to T2 where T2 < T1. So the calculation should be correct as is. But the result is positive, which conflicts with expectations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the process is solidification, which is exothermic and involves a decrease in entropy. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of ΔCp.

Wait, ΔCp is the heat capacity change. For solidification, the liquid is going to solid, so the heat capacity of the solid is lower than the liquid. So, the heat capacity change ΔCp = Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid) should be negative, which it is (-2.09 + 0.0015 T). So that seems correct.

Hmm, but the calculation gives a positive ΔS, which doesn't make sense for solidification. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the absolute values. Or perhaps I should have considered that the entropy change is negative because the system is going from higher entropy (liquid) to lower (solid). So maybe I should take the negative of the calculated ΔS.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the limits of integration. Maybe I should have taken the lower limit first. Let me re-express the integral.

ΔS = (-2.09)[ln(T2) - ln(T1)] + 0.0015 (T2 - T1).

So,

= (-2.09) ln(T2/T1) + 0.0015 (T2 - T1).

So,

= (-2.09) ln(1120/1356) + 0.0015*(1120 -1356).

Which is,

= (-2.09)(-0.1905) + 0.0015*(-236).

= 0.398 - 0.354 = 0.044 cal/(mol·K).

Hmm, so the calculation is correct, but the sign is positive. That's confusing because solidification should decrease entropy. So perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the reaction is solidification, which is the reverse of melting. So when calculating ΔS for the solidification, it's negative of the melting entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the negative of the calculated ΔS because the process is solidification, not melting.

Wait, the formula I used is for the entropy change when going from T1 to T2. If the process is cooling from T1 to T2, then the entropy change is negative because the system is losing entropy. Wait, but my calculation shows a small positive change, which contradicts that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the process is exothermic, so the entropy change of the surroundings is positive, but the system's entropy change is negative.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The reaction is Cu(l) → Cu(s). The entropy change of the system (ΔS_system) should be negative because solid has lower entropy than liquid. So the calculation must have an error because the result is positive.

Wait, perhaps the ΔCp is for the reaction, and I should have considered that the Cp of the solid is lower than the liquid, so ΔCp is negative, which it is. So the integral should correctly account for that.

Wait, let me recalculate the entropy change.

ΔS = ∫(1356 to 1120) [ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T ) / T ] dT

= ∫ [ -2.09/T + 0.0015 ] dT.

Which is,

= -2.09 ∫(1/T) dT + 0.0015 ∫ dT.

= -2.09 ln(T) + 0.0015 T evaluated from 1356 to 1120.

So,

At 1120: (-2.09 * ln(1120)) + (0.0015 * 1120)
At 1356: (-2.09 * ln(1356)) + (0.0015 * 1356)

Subtracting:

[ (-2.09 ln(1120) + 0.0015*1120) ] - [ (-2.09 ln(1356) + 0.0015*1356) ]

= (-2.09)(ln(1120) - ln(1356)) + 0.0015*(1120 - 1356)

= (-2.09) ln(1120/1356) + 0.0015*(-236)

As before.

So, the calculation is correct, but the result is positive, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I need to re-express the entropy change as negative, because the system is going from liquid to solid, which should have a negative entropy change.

Wait, maybe I should have used the absolute value for T in the calculation, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the negative of the integral because the process is solidification, not melting.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used gives the entropy change for the process of melting, so for solidification, I should take the negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the given ΔCp is for the solidification process, which would require an adjustment in sign.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

The formula for Gibbs free energy change is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

But I think I need to calculate ΔS for the process Cu(l) → Cu(s) at the given temperature (1120 K). So, the entropy change is negative because the system is becoming more ordered.

So perhaps the mistake is that the integral is giving a positive value, but I should have taken it as negative because the process is solidification, not melting.

Alternatively, perhaps the ΔCp is given for the reverse reaction (melting), so I should take the negative.

Wait, the reaction is Cu(l) → Cu(s), so the entropy change should be negative. So perhaps the integral should be negative of what I calculated.

So, perhaps ΔS = -0.044 cal/(mol·K).

Then, TΔS = 1120 * (-0.044) = -49.28 cal.

Then, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

Wait, but ΔH is the enthalpy change at 1120 K, which I calculated as -3055 cal.

So,

ΔG = (-3055) - (1120 * (-0.044)).

Wait, no, wait: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

ΔH is -3055 cal, TΔS is 1120 * (-0.044) = -49.28 cal.

So,

ΔG = (-3055) - (-49.28) = -3055 + 49.28 ≈ -3005.72 cal.

But that's still around -3000 cal, which isn't among the options. The options are much lower, like -440, -470, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the entropy change. Let me try another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using the heat capacity change for the reaction, but perhaps I should have used the molar heat capacities of the liquid and solid separately.

Wait, another approach: The entropy change can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = ∫(T_fusion to T) (ΔCp / T) dT.

But perhaps I should have used Cp for the liquid minus Cp for the solid, but maybe I should have integrated from the melting point to the given temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

ΔS = ∫(T_melt to T_solid) [Cp_liq - Cp_solid]/T dT.

Which would be the same as ∫ΔCp / T dT.

But let's see: The given ΔCp is (-2.09 + 1.5e-3 T), which is Cp_solid - Cp_liq, because when the solid is formed, its heat capacity is lower, so ΔCp is negative.

So, the integral is correct as is.

But the result is a positive ΔS, which is conflicting. So perhaps I should have taken the negative of the integral because the process is solidification.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the entropy change for the system is negative, so ΔS_system = -0.044 cal/(mol·K).

In that case, TΔS = 1120 * (-0.044) ≈ -49.28 cal.

Then, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

ΔH is -3055 cal.

So,

ΔG = (-3055) - (-49.28) = -3055 +49.28 ≈ -3005.72 cal.

But that's not matching any of the options. The options are in the range of -380 to -700 cal.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating ΔH at 1120 K.

Let me re-calculate the ΔH.

ΔH(T) = ΔH_initial + ∫(T_initial to T) ΔCp dT.

ΔH_initial is -3100 cal at 1356 K.

So,

ΔH at 1120 K = -3100 + ∫(1356 to 1120) [ -2.09 + 0.0015 T ] dT.

Compute the integral:

∫ [ -2.09 + 0.0015 T ] dT from 1356 to 1120.

= [ -2.09 T + 0.00075 T² ] evaluated from 1356 to 1120.

At 1120:

-2.09 * 1120 = -2350.8

0.00075 * (1120)^2 = 0.00075 * 1,254,400 = 940.8

So sum is -2350.8 + 940.8 = -1410.

At 1356:

-2.09 *1356 ≈ -2834.04

0.00075 * (1356)^2 = 0.00075 * 1,838,736 ≈ 1379.052

So sum is -2834.04 +1379.052 ≈ -1454.988.

Now, subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:

(-1410) - (-1454.988) = 44.988 cal.

So,

ΔH at 1120 K = -3100 +44.988 ≈ -3055.012 cal.

That seems correct.

Now, going back to ΔG:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

If ΔS is positive 0.044, then TΔS is positive 49.28.

So,

ΔG = (-3055) - (49.28) ≈ -3104.28 cal.

But that's way off from the options. The options are around -400 to -700.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. The ΔH is given in cal, but perhaps I should have converted it to J? No, the options are in cal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the entropy change is negative, so ΔS = -0.044.

Then, TΔS = 1120 * (-0.044) ≈ -49.28.

So,

ΔG = (-3055) - (-49.28) = -3055 +49.28 ≈ -3005.72 cal.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the integral for ΔH. Let me recheck.

Wait, the integral is from 1356 to 1120, which is a decrease in temperature. So the integral is positive because the function is increasing.

Wait, let me compute the integral again.

∫ [ -2.09 + 0.0015 T ] dT from 1356 to 1120.

= [ -2.09 T + 0.00075 T² ] from 1356 to 1120.

At 1120:

-2.09 * 1120 = -2350.8

0.00075 * (1120)^2 = 0.00075 * 1,254,400 = 940.8

Sum: -2350.8 +940.8 = -1410.

At 1356:

-2.09 *1356 ≈ -2834.04

0.00075 * (1356)^2 ≈ 1379.052

Sum: -2834.04 +1379.052 = -1454.988.

Now, subtracting:

(-1410) - (-1454.988) = 44.988 cal.

So ΔH at 1120 K is -3100 +44.988 ≈ -3055.012 cal.

Hmm, that's correct.

Now, perhaps I should have considered that the entropy change is negative, so ΔS = -0.044.

Then, TΔS = 1120 * (-0.044) ≈ -49.28.

So,

ΔG = (-3055) - (-49.28) = -3055 +49.28 = -3005.72 cal.

But this isn't matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm calculating ΔH at 1120 K, but maybe I should have used the initial ΔH at 1356 K and then calculate ΔG at 1120 K using that ΔH and the entropy change at 1120 K.

Wait, another approach: The Gibbs free energy change at the spontaneous solidification temperature (1120 K) can be found using the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° - TΔS°.

But ΔH° is given at 1356 K, and ΔS° is the entropy change at 1356 K, but perhaps I need to calculate the entropy change at 1120 K using the ΔCp.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that ΔH is constant, but that's not the case here because ΔCp is given.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS,

where ΔH is the enthalpy change at 1120 K, and ΔS is the entropy change calculated as before.

But I'm getting ΔG ≈ -3005 cal, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔS.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the integral from 1120 to 1356 instead of 1356 to 1120, which would make the entropy change negative.

Let me try that.

If I reverse the limits:

ΔS = ∫(1120 to 1356) [ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T ) / T ] dT.

Which would be,

= (-2.09)(ln(1356) - ln(1120)) + 0.0015 (1356 - 1120).

= (-2.09)(ln(1356/1120)) + 0.0015*(236).

Compute ln(1356/1120) = ln(1.2107) ≈ 0.194.

So,

= (-2.09)(0.194) + 0.0015*236 ≈ (-4.0626) + 0.354 ≈ -3.7086 cal/(mol·K).

So ΔS ≈ -3.7086 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, that makes more sense because solidification should have a negative entropy change.

Now, TΔS = 1120 * (-3.7086) ≈ -4153.7 cal.

Wait, that can't be right because that's a huge number, and ΔG would be ΔH - TΔS = (-3055) - (-4153.7) = 1100 cal, which is positive, which contradicts the spontaneity.

Wait, that can't be correct. So perhaps I should not have reversed the limits. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the negative of the integral I originally calculated.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the entropy change for the process Cu(l) → Cu(s) at 1120 K, which is solidification, so entropy decreases, so ΔS is negative.

So, perhaps I should have taken the negative of the 0.044 value, making it -0.044.

Then, TΔS = 1120 * (-0.044) ≈ -49.28 cal.

So,

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = (-3055) - (-49.28) = -3055 +49.28 ≈ -3005.72 cal.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

The reaction is Cu(l) → Cu(s), which releases heat, so ΔH is negative. The entropy change should be negative because the system is becoming more ordered.

But according to the integral, I'm getting a positive ΔS, which is wrong. So perhaps I should have taken the negative of the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

ΔS = -∫(T_melt to T_solid) [ΔCp / T] dT.

So in that case, the entropy change would be negative.

Let me try that.

ΔS = - [ (-2.09) ln(T2/T1) + 0.0015 (T2 - T1) ]

= 2.09 ln(1120/1356) - 0.0015*(1120 -1356).

Compute:

ln(0.826) ≈ -0.1905.

So,

= 2.09*(-0.1905) - 0.0015*(-236)
= -0.398 + 0.354 ≈ -0.044 cal/(mol·K).

That's better because ΔS is negative now.

So, ΔS ≈ -0.044 cal/(mol·K).

Now, TΔS = 1120 * (-0.044) ≈ -49.28 cal.

So,

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = (-3055) - (-49.28) = -3055 +49.28 ≈ -3005.72 cal.

Still not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ΔH at the melting point (1356 K) and calculate ΔG at 1120 K using the entropy change calculated at 1356 K.

But that doesn't make sense because entropy change depends on temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS,

where ΔH is the enthalpy change at the temperature of interest (1120 K), and ΔS is the entropy change at that temperature.

But I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are much lower than my calculated -3005 cal. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the integral for ΔH.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the integral for ΔH is ∫ΔCp dT from 1356 to 1120, but perhaps I should have taken the negative of that because the reaction is exothermic.

Wait, no, the integral is correct as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the equation:

ΔG = -ΔH + TΔS,

but that would change the sign.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula ΔG = nF for electrochemistry, but this isn't an electrochemical problem.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the Gibbs free energy change for solidification is positive because it's spontaneous, but I'm getting a negative ΔG, which indicates spontaneity, so that's correct.

But the options are much lower in magnitude. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the entropy change.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the average temperature instead of integrating from 1356 to 1120.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° - TΔS°,

where ΔH° is at 1120 K, and ΔS° is calculated using the average ΔCp over the temperature range.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the entropy change is negligible, and ΔG ≈ ΔH°, but that would give -3100 cal, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to calculate ΔG at 1356 K, not 1120 K. But the question says to calculate it at the spontaneous solidification temperature, which is 1120 K.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° - TΔS°,

where ΔH° is at 1356 K, and ΔS° is the entropy change at 1356 K.

But that doesn't make sense because the entropy change would be zero at the melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the Clapeyron equation to find the slope of the phase boundary, but that's more for determining the phase transition temperature, not the Gibbs free energy change.

Wait, another thought: The problem gives ΔCp as a function of temperature. So perhaps I should have used the average ΔCp over the temperature range.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ∫(T_initial to T_final) (ΔH° - TΔS°) dT,

but that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

ΔG = ∫(T_melt to T_solid) (ΔH° - TΔS°) dT,

but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° + ∫(T_melt to T_solid) (ΔCp) dT - TΔS,

but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for calculating Gibbs free energy change when both ΔH and ΔCp are given.

Wait, I recall that:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS,

and when ΔCp is given, we can express ΔS as:

ΔS = ∫(T1 to T2) (ΔCp / T) dT,

where T1 is the initial temperature (melting point, 1356 K), and T2 is the final temperature (1120 K).

So, with that,

ΔS = ∫(1356 to 1120) [ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T ) / T ] dT ≈ 0.044 cal/(mol·K).

But as before, this gives a positive ΔS, which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the entropy change at 1120 K using the given ΔCp, and then compute ΔG.

But I'm stuck because the calculations don't align with the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the given ΔH at 1356 K and the entropy change at 1356 K, but that doesn't make sense because the temperature is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH + ∫(T_initial to T_final) ΔCp dT,

but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The Gibbs free energy change at any temperature T can be found using:

ΔG = ΔH° + ∫(T° to T) ΔCp dT - TΔS,

where T° is the reference temperature (1356 K), and ΔS is the entropy change at T°.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that ΔH is constant over the temperature range, so ΔH remains -3100 cal, and then calculate ΔS at 1120 K using Cp values.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° - TΔS°,

where ΔS° is the entropy change at the melting point (1356 K), which is zero because at the melting point, the Gibbs free energy change is zero.

Wait, no, because at the melting point, the Gibbs free energy change for melting is zero. But we're looking at solidification, so perhaps ΔG is negative.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look for another approach.

Perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change using the average ΔCp.

The average ΔCp between 1120 K and 1356 K is (ΔCp at 1120 + ΔCp at 1356)/2.

ΔCp at 1120 K: -2.09 + 1.5e-3 *1120 = -2.09 + 1.68 = 0.59 cal/(mol·K).

ΔCp at 1356 K: -2.09 + 1.5e-3 *1356 ≈ -2.09 + 2.034 ≈ -0.056 cal/(mol·K).

Average ΔCp ≈ (0.59 -0.056)/2 ≈ 0.267 cal/(mol·K).

Then, the average temperature is (1120 +1356)/2 ≈ 1238 K.

So, entropy change ΔS ≈ (0.267) * ln(1356/1120) ≈ 0.267 * 0.1905 ≈ 0.0508 cal/(mol·K).

But that's still positive, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the absolute value.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° - TΔS,

where ΔH° is at 1120 K, which I calculated as -3055 cal, and ΔS is the entropy change at 1120 K, which I'm struggling to find correctly.

But I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the options available, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, the closest to my initial incorrect calculation of -3005 cal isn't present, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS,

where ΔH is given at 1356 K, and ΔS is calculated at 1356 K.

But at 1356 K, the entropy change is zero because it's the melting point, so ΔG would be ΔH, which is -3100 cal. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS,

where ΔH is at 1120 K, and ΔS is the standard entropy change, which is negative.

But without the correct ΔS, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS,

where ΔH is the enthalpy change at 1120 K, and ΔS is the entropy change at 1120 K.

But I don't have ΔS at 1120 K directly.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate ΔS at 1120 K using the ΔCp at that temperature.

ΔCp at 1120 K: -2.09 + 1.5e-3 *1120 = -2.09 + 1.68 = 0.59 cal/(mol·K).

So, at 1120 K, ΔCp is 0.59 cal/(mol·K).

Then, the entropy change ΔS would be ΔCp / T = 0.59 / 1120 ≈ 0.0005267 cal/(mol·K).

But that's a very small number, so TΔS ≈ 1120 * 0.0005267 ≈ 0.59 cal.

So,

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS ≈ (-3055) - 0.59 ≈ -3055.59 cal.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the average ΔCp over the temperature range.

Average ΔCp between 1120 and 1356 K:

At 1120: 0.59

At 1356: -0.056

Average ≈ (0.59 -0.056)/2 ≈ 0.267 cal/(mol·K).

Then,

ΔS = ∫(1356 to 1120) (0.267 / T) dT.

= 0.267 ln(1120/1356) ≈ 0.267 * (-0.1905) ≈ -0.0508 cal/(mol·K).

So,

TΔS = 1120 * (-0.0508) ≈ -56.8 cal.

Then,

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS ≈ (-3055) - (-56.8) ≈ -3055 +56.8 ≈ -2998.2 cal.

Still not matching any options.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should try to see which option is closest to my initial calculation of -3005 cal, but that's not an option. The options are much lower, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the formula:

ΔG = nF,

but that's for electrochemical reactions, which this isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the entropy change as Cp ln(T2/T1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° - TΔS°,

where ΔS° is the standard entropy change, which is the entropy of the solid minus the entropy of the liquid at 1120 K.

But I don't have the standard entropy values for copper in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the standard entropy of copper solid and liquid, but the problem doesn't provide that data.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS,

where ΔS is the entropy change calculated from the integral, which I'm getting as 0.044 cal/(mol·K).

So,

ΔG = (-3055) - (1120 * 0.044) ≈ -3055 -49.28 ≈ -3104.28 cal.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the entropy change and just use ΔH at 1120 K, which is -3055 cal. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given ΔCp to calculate ΔS at 1120 K and then use that to find ΔG.

But I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking back, I think I made a mistake in the sign of the entropy change. If I take ΔS as -0.044, then TΔS is -49.28, and ΔG is -3055 - (-49.28) = -3005.72 cal.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I should look for the closest option. However, the options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change using the formula:

ΔS = ∫(T_melt to T_solid) [ΔCp / T] dT,

but with ΔCp being negative, leading to a negative ΔS.

Wait, let me try that again.

ΔS = ∫(1356 to 1120) [ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T ) / T ] dT

= ∫ [ -2.09/T + 0.0015 ] dT

= (-2.09) ln(T2/T1) + 0.0015 (T2 - T1).

Plugging in:

= (-2.09)(ln(1120/1356)) + 0.0015*(1120 -1356)

= (-2.09)(-0.1905) + 0.0015*(-236)

= 0.398 - 0.354 = 0.044 cal/(mol·K).

So, ΔS is positive, which is conflicting.

But perhaps the correct approach is to take the negative of this value because the process is solidification.

So, ΔS = -0.044.

Then,

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = (-3055) - (1120 * (-0.044)) = -3055 +49.28 ≈ -3005.72 cal.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the entropy change at the melting point, which is zero, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° + ∫(T° to T) ΔCp dT,

but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the Gibbs free energy change using the formula:

ΔG = ΔH° - TΔS,

where ΔS is the entropy change of the surroundings, but that seems unlikely.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is option D: -440 cal/mole, but I'm not confident.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the Gibbs free-energy change (ΔG) at the spontaneous solidification temperature of copper (1,120 K) using the provided thermodynamic data. The reaction is Cu(l) → Cu(s), with ΔH° = -3,100 cal at the melting point (1,356 K) and ΔCp = -2.09 + 1.5 × 10⁻³T. The key steps involve determining ΔH at 1,120 K and the entropy change (ΔS) over the temperature range from 1,356 K to 1,120 K.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Entropy Change (ΔS):**
   The entropy change is calculated using the integral:
   \[
   \Delta S = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{\Delta C_p}{T} \, dT
   \]
   Substituting ΔCp = -2.09 + 1.5 × 10⁻³T:
   \[
   \Delta S = \int_{1356}^{1120} \left( \frac{-2.09}{T} + 0.0015 \right) dT
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \Delta S = -2.09 \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) + 0.0015 (T_2 - T_1)
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \Delta S = -2.09 \ln\left(\frac{1120}{1356}\right) + 0.0015 (1120 - 1356)
   \]
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1120}{1356}\right) \approx -0.1905, \quad 1120 - 1356 = -236
   \]
   \[
   \Delta S \approx -2.09(-0.1905) + 0.0015(-236) = 0.398 - 0.354 = 0.044 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}
   \]
   Since solidification decreases entropy, ΔS should be negative, so ΔS ≈ -0.044 cal/(mol·K).

2. **Enthalpy Change (ΔH) at 1,120 K:**
   The enthalpy change at 1,120 K is calculated using:
   \[
   \Delta H = \Delta H^\circ + \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \Delta C_p \, dT
   \]
   Substituting ΔCp = -2.09 + 1.5 × 10⁻³T:
   \[
   \Delta H = -3100 + \int_{1356}^{1120} (-2.09 + 0.0015T) \, dT
   \]
   \[
   \int (-2.09 + 0.0015T) \, dT = -2.09T + 0.00075T^2
   \]
   Evaluating from 1,356 K to 1,120 K:
   \[
   \Delta H = -3100 + \left[ -2.09(1120) + 0.00075(1120)^2 \right] - \left[ -2.09(1356) + 0.00075(1356)^2 \right]
   \]
   \[
   \Delta H \approx -3100 + (-1410) - (-1454.988) = -3100 + 44.988 \approx -3055.012 \, \text{cal}
   \]

3. **Gibbs Free Energy Change (ΔG):**
   Using ΔG = ΔH - TΔS:
   \[
   \Delta G = -3055 - (1120 \times -0.044) = -3055 + 49.28 \approx -3005.72 \, \text{cal}
   \]
   This result does not match any provided options, suggesting a possible error in the approach or interpretation of the problem.
