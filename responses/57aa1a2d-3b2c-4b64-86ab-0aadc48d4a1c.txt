Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Elaboration Likelihood Model. I remember from my psychology class that this model explains how people process persuasive messages. There are two main routes: the central and the peripheral. The central route is when people think deeply about the message, considering the arguments and evidence. The peripheral route is when they rely on superficial cues, like how the message was presented or who said it.

The question is asking when a person is most likely to use the central route. The options are A to I. Let me go through each one.

Option A says the message is within his "latitude of acceptance." I think latitude of acceptance refers to the range of attitudes someone can have without changing their behavior. So if the message is within that range, maybe they don't need to think much because it's already acceptable. That might lead them to the peripheral route because they don't feel the need to elaborate.

Option B is when he's in a neutral or slightly negative mood. I recall that a positive mood can make people more open to persuasion, perhaps using the central route. A neutral or slightly negative mood might make them less motivated to think deeply, so maybe they use the peripheral route instead.

Option C is when the message is outside his latitude of acceptance. If the message is outside, that means it's conflicting with their current beliefs. In that case, they might feel the need to pay attention and think more carefully, using the central route to evaluate the message.

Option D says everyone else in the group disagrees with the message. If others disagree, maybe the person feels the need to think more about it to form their own opinion, leading to the central route.

Option E is when everyone else agrees. That might make the person feel more confident without thinking too much, so they might go with the peripheral route by just agreeing because others do.

Option F is if he strongly disagrees. Similar to option C, if the message is outside his acceptance, he might elaborate. But wait, F is about his own disagreement, not necessarily the latitude. Maybe it's similar to C.

Option G says the message is irrelevant. If it's irrelevant, he probably doesn't care and uses the peripheral route, not thinking much.

Option H is if he thinks the message is boring. Boring messages would likely lead to the peripheral route because he's not motivated to engage deeply.

Option I is if he's distracted. If distracted, he can't focus on the message, so he'd rely on peripheral cues, not the central route.

So, the central route is when the person is motivated to think about the message. That happens when the message is important or when their current attitude is challenged. So options C and D seem possible. Wait, what's the difference between C and F? C is about the message being outside his latitude, meaning it's beyond his current acceptance range. F is when he strongly disagrees, which might be a similar situation. But in the model, the central route is triggered when the message is important or when the person is motivated to process it, often when it's relevant or when it's inconsistent with existing beliefs.

So, if the message is outside his latitude of acceptance, he's more likely to engage in central processing. So the answer should be C. Alternatively, D says others disagree, which might make him think more, but I think the model emphasizes the message's content more than others' opinions. So I'm leaning towards C.

The Elaboration Likelihood Model suggests that the central route is used when individuals are motivated to think carefully about a message. This typically occurs when the message is significant or when it challenges existing beliefs. Among the options, when the message is outside the individual's "latitude of acceptance," it is most likely to trigger the central route, as the person feels the need to evaluate the message thoroughly. 

Answer: C
