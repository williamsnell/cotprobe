Okay, so I've got this problem here about Gabriella, the Human Cannonball, and I need to figure out the total distance she flew during her four shows on Saturday. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The distances she measured were 7.04 meters, 18.81 meters, 18.39 meters, and 19.94 meters. I need to add all these together to get the total distance. Hmm, adding up four numbers, that's straightforward, but I should take it step by step to avoid any mistakes.

Let me write down the numbers first:

7.04
18.81
18.39
19.94

I think the best way to approach this is to add them one by one. Let's start by adding the first two numbers: 7.04 and 18.81.

Adding 7.04 and 18.81. Let me line them up:

7.04
+18.81
--------
?

Let me add the hundredths place first: 4 + 1 = 5.

Then the tenths place: 0 + 8 = 8.

Then the units place: 7 + 8 = 15. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 7 + 8 is actually 15? No, wait, 7 + 8 is 15? Wait, 7 + 8 is 15? Hmm, no, that's correct. Wait, no, 7 is in the units place and 8 is also in the units place. So 7 + 8 = 15. But since we're dealing with decimal numbers, the 15 would carry over. Wait, but since 7.04 is 7 units and 18.81 is 18 units, adding 7 and 18 gives 25. Then the tenths: 0 + 8 = 8, and the hundredths: 4 + 1 = 5. So, 25.85? Wait, no, that can't be right because 7.04 + 18.81 should be 25.85. Let me check that again.

Wait, 7.04 is seven meters and 4 centimeters, and 18.81 is eighteen meters and 81 centimeters. So adding them: 7 + 18 = 25 meters, and 4 cm + 81 cm = 85 cm, which is 0.85 meters. So yes, 25.85 meters is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check using another method. Let me convert everything to centimeters to avoid decimal confusion. 7.04 meters is 704 cm, and 18.81 meters is 1881 cm. Adding those together: 704 + 1881. Let's see, 700 + 1800 = 2500, and 4 + 81 = 85, so total is 2585 cm, which is 25.85 meters. Yep, that checks out.

Now, let's add the third number, which is 18.39 meters. So 25.85 + 18.39.

Let me line them up:

25.85
+18.39
--------

Starting from the right, hundredths place: 5 + 9 = 14. So I write down 4 and carry over 1.

Tenths place: 8 + 3 = 11, plus the carried 1 makes 12. So write down 2 and carry over 1.

Units place: 5 + 8 = 13, plus the carried 1 makes 14. So write down 4 and carry over 1.

Tens place: 2 + 1 = 3, plus the carried 1 makes 4.

So putting it together, it's 44.24 meters? Wait, no, that can't be right because 25.85 + 18.39 should be more than 44 meters. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the addition.

Wait, 25.85 plus 18.39. Let me check again. Let me add 25 and 18 first, which is 43. Then the decimals: 0.85 + 0.39. 0.85 + 0.39 is 1.24. So adding 43 + 1.24 gives 44.24. Oh, okay, so 44.24 meters is correct.

Alternatively, adding in parts: 25.85 + 18 = 43.85, then plus 0.39 is 44.24. Yep, that makes sense.

Now, the last number is 19.94 meters. So I need to add 44.24 + 19.94.

Let me line them up:

44.24
+19.94
--------

Starting from the right, hundredths place: 4 + 4 = 8.

Tenths place: 2 + 9 = 11. So write down 1 and carry over 1.

Units place: 4 + 9 = 13, plus the carried 1 is 14. So write down 4 and carry over 1.

Tens place: 4 + 1 = 5, plus the carried 1 is 6.

So that gives us 64.18 meters.

Wait, let me double-check that. 44.24 + 19.94. Let me add the whole numbers first: 44 + 19 = 63. Then the decimals: 0.24 + 0.94 = 1.18. So 63 + 1.18 = 64.18 meters. Yes, that's correct.

So adding all four distances: 7.04 + 18.81 = 25.85; 25.85 + 18.39 = 44.24; 44.24 + 19.94 = 64.18 meters.

Looking at the options, option H is 64.18 m. So the answer should be H.

The total distance Gabriella flew is calculated by adding all four distances: 7.04 + 18.81 + 18.39 + 19.94. After performing the addition step-by-step, the total is 64.18 meters. 

Answer: H
