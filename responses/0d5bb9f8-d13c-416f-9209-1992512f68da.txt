Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the maximum percentage error in the surface area of a human body using differentials. The formula given is S = 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^0.725, where w is weight in pounds and h is height in inches. The errors in measuring w and h are at most 2%, and I need to use differentials to estimate the maximum percentage error in S.

Hmm, I remember that differentials can be used to approximate the change in a function due to small changes in its variables. So, the idea is to find the differential dS and then express it in terms of dw and dh, which are the errors in weight and height.

First, let me write down the formula again for clarity:
S = 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^0.725

To find dS, I'll need to take the partial derivatives of S with respect to w and h, and then multiply each by the respective differential (dw and dh) and sum them up.

So, the differential dS is:
dS = (∂S/∂w) * dw + (∂S/∂h) * dh

Let me compute the partial derivatives.

Starting with ∂S/∂w. Since S is proportional to w^0.425, the derivative with respect to w is 0.425 * 0.1091 * w^(0.425 - 1) * h^0.725. Simplifying that, it's 0.425 * 0.1091 * w^-0.575 * h^0.725.

Similarly, ∂S/∂h is the derivative with respect to h. Since S is proportional to h^0.725, the derivative is 0.725 * 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^(0.725 - 1), which is 0.725 * 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^-0.275.

Now, let's express dS:

dS = (0.425 * 0.1091 * w^-0.575 * h^0.725) * dw + (0.725 * 0.1091 * w^0.425 * h^-0.275) * dh

Hmm, I notice that both terms have 0.1091, so maybe I can factor that out. Let me factor 0.1091 out:

dS = 0.1091 [ 0.425 w^-0.575 h^0.725 dw + 0.725 w^0.425 h^-0.275 dh ]

But wait, S itself is 0.1091 w^0.425 h^0.725, so maybe I can express the terms in terms of S. Let's see:

Looking at the first term inside the brackets: 0.425 w^-0.575 h^0.725 dw. If I factor out w^-0.575 h^0.725, but perhaps it's better to write in terms of S.

Alternatively, let's factor S out from the terms. Let me see:

S = 0.1091 w^0.425 h^0.725

So, for the first term, 0.425 * 0.1091 w^-0.575 h^0.725 dw = 0.425 * (0.1091 w^0.425 h^0.725) * w^-0.425 h^0.725 dw/(w^0.425 h^0.725)?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to factor S into the differential equation.

Wait, let me think again.

The expression for dS can be written as:

dS = S * [ (0.425 * (dw/w)) + (0.725 * (dh/h)) ]

Because S is proportional to w^0.425 h^0.725, so when taking the partial derivatives, each term would have the exponent times the differential divided by the variable.

Let me check:

Yes, because ∂S/∂w = 0.425 * S / w, since S = k w^a h^b, then ∂S/∂w = a * k w^(a-1) h^b = a * S / w. Similarly for ∂S/∂h = b * S / h.

So, substituting, we get:

dS = (0.425 * S / w) * dw + (0.725 * S / h) * dh

Factor out S:

dS = S [ (0.425 dw)/w + (0.725 dh)/h ]

Therefore, the relative error in S, which is dS/S, is:

dS/S = 0.425 (dw/w) + 0.725 (dh/h)

Given that the errors in w and h are at most 2%, so (dw/w) ≤ 2% = 0.02, and similarly (dh/h) ≤ 0.02.

But wait, the problem says the errors are at most 2%, so the maximum relative errors for w and h are both 2%. Since the relative error in S depends on both, and the question is about the maximum percentage error, we can consider the worst case where both dw and dh are at their maximum errors.

So, substituting the maximum relative errors:

dS/S ≤ 0.425 * 0.02 + 0.725 * 0.02

Let me compute that:

0.425 * 0.02 = 0.0085

0.725 * 0.02 = 0.0145

Adding them together: 0.0085 + 0.0145 = 0.023

So, dS/S ≤ 0.023, which is 2.3%

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the errors are at most 2%, so the maximum relative errors are 0.02 each. So if both errors are at their maximum, then the maximum error in S would be 0.425*0.02 + 0.725*0.02 = 0.02*(0.425 + 0.725) = 0.02*(1.15) = 0.023, which is 2.3%, so option C is 2.3%.

But wait, is this correct? Alternatively, perhaps the errors could combine in a way that they don't both contribute to the same direction. But since we're looking for the maximum possible error, it's when both errors add constructively, i.e., both positive or both negative. But since the model uses multiplication, perhaps the maximum occurs when both errors are positive, leading to the maximum increase in S.

Alternatively, maybe the errors could be negative, but the question is about the maximum percentage error, so it's the worst-case scenario, so we take the maximum possible positive error.

So, the maximum percentage error in S is 2.3%, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

0.425 + 0.725 = 1.15

1.15 * 0.02 = 0.023, which is 2.3%, so yes, option C.

The maximum percentage error in the surface area is estimated using differentials. By computing the relative error contributions from weight and height, the maximum error is found to be 2.3%.
