Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how much Maria spends on lunch during a 5-day work week. Let's see. Maria spends $9 each day she's at work. To find the total for the week, she multiplies 5 by 9. So, I think the question is just about calculating 5 times 9.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. So Maria goes to work for 5 days, and each day she spends $9 on lunch. That makes sense. So, to find the total amount, she's multiplying the number of days by the daily expense. So mathematically, that's 5 multiplied by 9.

Hmm, what's 5 times 9? Let me think. I remember that 5 times 9 is a common multiplication fact. 5 times 9 is 45. Yeah, that's right. So the total amount she spends is $45. 

Looking at the options provided, I need to find which one is $45. Let me go through the options:

A: $35 – that's lower than 45, so not this one.
B: $50 – that's higher.
C: $60 – way too high.
D: $59 – nope.
E: $30 – too low.
F: $49 – close, but not 45.
G: $45 – yes, that's the one.
H: $55 – higher again.
I: $39 – lower.
J: $40 – also lower.

So the correct answer should be G, $45. I think that's straightforward. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but I don't see any tricks here. It's just a simple multiplication problem. So yeah, 5 days times $9 a day equals $45.
