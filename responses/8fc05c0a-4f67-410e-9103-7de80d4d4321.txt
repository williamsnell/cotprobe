Question:

A sphere, a cube, and a cylinder, all of equal mass, are released from rest from the top of a short incline. The surface of the incline is extremely slick, so much so that the objects do not rotate when released, but rather slide with negligible friction. Which reaches the base of the incline first?

Options:

A: The object that is released first
B: The object that is released last
C: The cube and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the sphere
D: the sphere
E: the cylinder
F: the cube
G: The object in the middle
H: All reach the base at the same time.
I: None of them reach the base
J: The sphere and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the cube

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about three objects—a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder—each with the same mass. They're all released from rest at the top of a short incline. The incline is extremely slick, meaning there's negligible friction, and the objects don't rotate when released; they just slide. The question is asking which one reaches the base of the incline first.

Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when objects slide down an incline without rolling, their acceleration depends on their shape and mass distribution. Wait, but in this case, all the objects are sliding without rotating, so maybe it's all about their moments of inertia? Or does it matter at all?

Wait, no, because if they aren't rotating, then the moment of inertia might not come into play. So when an object slides down a frictionless incline without rotating, the only forces are gravity and the normal force. Since there's no friction, there's no torque, so they don't rotate.

In that case, the acceleration down the incline for each object should be the same because they all have the same mass, and the angle of the incline is the same for all. The formula for acceleration when sliding without friction is a = g * sin(theta), where theta is the angle of the incline. Since all objects have the same mass and same theta, their accelerations should be identical.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the shape of the object affect the acceleration when there's no rotation? I'm a bit confused because usually, when objects roll without slipping, their moments of inertia affect the acceleration (like the classic problem where a solid sphere rolls faster than a hollow one). But in this case, they're not rolling; they're just sliding. So their acceleration should just depend on the angle and gravity, not on their shape or mass distribution.

So if all three have the same mass and same angle, they should all accelerate at the same rate. Since they start from rest, the time it takes to reach the base depends on the distance along the incline. But since the incline is short, and all three start from the same height, the distance each travels is the same. So if their accelerations are the same, they should all reach the base at the same time.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Let me check the options again. Option H says all reach the base at the same time. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Did I miss something about the moment of inertia? No, because without rotation, there's no torque, so the moment of inertia doesn't affect the translational acceleration. It's purely a matter of the net force being mass times acceleration, and the net force is mg sin(theta). So a = g sin(theta), same for all.

So yeah, all three should reach the base at the same time. So the answer should be H.

The objects slide down the incline without rotating, meaning friction and torque are negligible. Since there's no rotation, the acceleration is determined solely by gravity and the angle of the incline, given by \( a = g \sin(\theta) \). All objects share the same mass and incline angle, resulting in identical accelerations. Thus, they all reach the base simultaneously.

Answer: H
