Question:

A county owns a large expanse of land next to the ocean. Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?

Options:

A: The company will win, as private entities have the right to set their own prices for services.
B: The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.
C: The resident will win because the hotel's high fees are in violation of the county's leasing agreement.
D: The resident will win, as the high fees constitute a form of economic discrimination.
E: The company will lose because it is operating on public land and therefore cannot charge fees that the public cannot afford.
F: The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.
G: The company will lose, as it has failed to provide an affordable option for all county residents.
H: The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
I: The resident will win because all public rights cannot be limited to those who can afford them.
J: The company will win, as the equal protection clause does not apply to commercial transactions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the scenario is about a county that leased a large piece of land next to the ocean to a company. The lease required the company to build a luxury hotel with a bar, restaurant, and private marina. The company has to pay 15% of its net profits as rent. The county approved the management and operations bylaws when the lease was negotiated. The state gave the company a license to sell alcohol, and the hotel set its cheapest room at $1000 per night. Now, a resident who can't afford that is suing the company, saying the high fees discriminate against the poor, violating equal protection under the Constitution.

The question is asking what the most likely result of this action is. There are ten options, A through J.

First, I need to think about what the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment entails. The clause states that no state shall deny any person equal protection under the law. But this case is against a private company, the hotel, not the state or the county. So, I'm wondering if the equal protection clause applies here because it's a private entity, not a government action.

I remember that the Supreme Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action, not private actions unless the private action is so closely intertwined with state action that it can be fairly traced to the state. This is known as the state action doctrine. So, if the hotel's actions are part of state action, then equal protection might apply. But if it's purely a private decision, then equal protection wouldn't be the right cause of action.

In this case, the county leased the land to the company, and they approved the bylaws. But the company is the one setting the prices. The state granted the license, but that's probably a separate action. So, is the company's pricing decision considered state action? I'm not sure. The company is operating on land leased from the county, but setting prices is a private business decision.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the company will win because private entities can set their own prices. That makes sense because, generally, private businesses can set prices unless there's some law against it. But the issue here is equal protection, so if it's a private action, maybe the equal protection clause doesn't apply, so the company wins. But I need to think about whether the county's involvement makes it state action.

Option B says the company wins because hotel privileges aren't important enough. This is about whether the deprivation is significant. But if the hotel is the only option in the area, maybe access is important, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option C claims the resident wins because the fees violate the lease agreement. The lease required a first-rate luxury hotel, but nothing about affordable pricing. So unless the lease specifies that the hotel must offer affordable options, this might not be a breach. I don't think the lease terms are the issue here since the question is about constitutional rights, not contract terms.

Option D says the resident wins because it's economic discrimination. But again, equal protection applies to state action, not necessarily private discrimination unless it's under a law that requires state action. I'm not sure if pricing by a private business is considered discriminatory under equal protection.

Option E says the company loses because it's on public land. But just because it's on public land doesn't automatically mean the prices have to be affordable. The lease allowed them to set up a luxury hotel, so maybe the company is allowed to charge high fees as part of their business model.

Option F suggests the company loses because social class is a suspect classification. I know that suspect classifications are those that the Supreme Court has found to require strict scrutiny, like race, national origin, religion, etc. Social class isn't generally a suspect classification, so this might not apply.

Option G says the company loses for failing to provide affordable options. But there's no indication that the lease required the hotel to offer affordable rooms. The lease was about building a luxury hotel and paying rent based on profits. So I don't think the company is legally obligated to provide affordable options unless it's in the contract, which it's not.

Option H claims the resident wins because it's discrimination against the poor under equal protection. But again, equal protection applies to state action. Since the hotel is a private entity, unless their actions are part of state action, equal protection wouldn't apply. So H might not be correct.

Option I says the resident wins because public rights can't be limited by what people can afford. I'm not sure what "public rights" refer to here. The hotel is a private business, so public rights might not be the issue. This might be more about access to public services, which the hotel isn't providing, but again, it's a private entity.

Option J states the company wins because equal protection doesn't apply to commercial transactions. This seems plausible because commercial transactions are generally private, and unless there's state involvement, the equal protection clause doesn't come into play.

Putting it all together, the key issue is whether the equal protection clause applies to the company's pricing. Since the company is private, and the question doesn't indicate that their actions are under state compulsion beyond the lease, which doesn't impose price controls, the equal protection clause likely doesn't apply. Therefore, the company can set their own prices, and the resident's claim would fail. So the most likely result is that the company wins because private entities have the right to set their own prices. That would be option A.

Wait, but I should double-check. The lease was with the county, so maybe there's some state action involved. The county leased the land and approved the bylaws. But the pricing is a business decision by the company, not the county. So unless the bylaws require certain pricing, which they don't, the state action is minimal. Therefore, the company's pricing is a private decision, and equal protection doesn't require them to set affordable prices. So yes, option A makes sense.

The question revolves around whether a private company's pricing policy violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The company operates a luxury hotel on land leased from the county, with no lease provisions requiring affordable pricing. The equal protection clause applies to state action, not private decisions unless closely intertwined with state action. Since the company's pricing is a private business decision, the clause does not apply, and the company can set its own prices.
