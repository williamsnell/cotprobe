Question:

A 19-year-old Asian female college student comes to the university health center because of a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1째C (100.6째F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?

Options:

A: Mucosal edema
B: Fungal infection
C: Bacterial infection
D: Chronic sinusitis
E: Oral contraceptive use
F: Viral infection
G: Allergic reaction
H: Immune system disorder
I: Nasal polyps
J: Eustachian tube dysfunction

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis. Let's go through the information step by step.

The patient is a 19-year-old Asian female college student. She presents with a one-week history of nasal stuffiness and occasional clear rhinorrhea. She also has a mild sore throat. Two days ago, she started feeling hot, which might indicate a fever, though she hasn't taken her temperature. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she only takes oral contraceptives. No history of allergies, doesn't smoke.

Vital signs: Temp is 38.1째C (100.6째F), which is a low-grade fever. Pulse is 88/min, which is a bit elevated but within normal range. Respirations are 16/min, normal, and blood pressure is 116/74, which is okay.

Physical exam findings: Tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. That's a sign of sinusitis. There's clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, which could indicate middle ear fluid or Eustachian tube dysfunction. Tonsils are enlarged bilaterally, so maybe some pharyngitis. Pain with tapping the left upper incisors suggests sinus pressure, likely from maxillary sinus involvement. Left frontal sinus doesn't transilluminate, which could mean it's filled with fluid or inflammation. Cardio and pulmonary exams are normal.

So, the main issue seems to be sinusitis, possibly with some otitis media or Eustachian tube issues. Now, the question is about the underlying mechanism.

The options are A through J. Let's think about each possible cause.

Option A: Mucosal edema. That's a common feature in sinusitis, especially viral. It leads to blockage of the sinus openings, causing inflammation.

Option B: Fungal infection. Usually, fungal sinusitis is chronic and might have been suggested by symptoms lasting longer or certain exam findings like thick exudate. Here, the symptoms are only a week, so probably acute, less likely fungal.

Option C: Bacterial infection. Sinusitis can be bacterial, but often follows a viral infection. Since she's had symptoms for a week, maybe transitioning to bacterial, but not sure yet.

Option D: Chronic sinusitis. Her symptoms are only a week, so probably acute. Chronic would be longer, like months.

Option E: Oral contraceptive use. I'm not sure about this. OCPs can sometimes increase the risk of certain infections, but I don't recall a direct link to sinusitis. Maybe hormonal factors, but not the primary cause here.

Option F: Viral infection. Viral sinusitis is common, especially with a sore throat and clear rhinorrhea. It leads to mucosal edema, which can block sinuses.

Option G: Allergic reaction. She has no history of allergies, so this is less likely. Allergic sinusitis is usually chronic and seasonal.

Option H: Immune system disorder. No history suggests this, and acute symptoms don't point to an immune issue.

Option I: Nasal polyps. These are more common in chronic cases and can cause blockage, but again, her case seems acute.

Option J: Eustachian tube dysfunction. This could explain the middle ear fluid, but how does it relate to sinusitis? Eustachian tube issues can cause pressure changes, but the main issue here is the sinus tenderness and frontal sinus involvement, which points more to sinusitis.

Putting it together: She has acute sinusitis symptoms. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is a viral infection. Viral infections cause mucosal edema, which blocks the sinus ostia, leading to inflammation and sinusitis. Her fever and other symptoms fit with a viral upper respiratory infection progressing to sinusitis.

So the underlying mechanism is likely viral infection causing mucosal edema, leading to sinus blockage and inflammation.

The patient presents with symptoms of acute sinusitis, including nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and fever. The physical exam findings, such as tenderness over the left maxillary sinus and bilateral tonsillar enlargement, support this diagnosis. Given the acute nature of the symptoms and the absence of a history of allergies or chronic conditions, the underlying mechanism is most consistent with a viral infection. Viral infections often lead to mucosal edema, which blocks the sinus openings and triggers inflammation.
