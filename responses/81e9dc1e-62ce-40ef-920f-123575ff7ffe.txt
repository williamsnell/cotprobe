Okay, so I've got this problem here about using the van der Waals equation to find the pressure of nitrogen gas when it's heated. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm still a bit new to this.

First, the problem says that nitrogen is heated to 500 K at a constant volume of 1.000 m³. The gas enters at 300 K and 100 atm, and the mass is 92.4 kg. The van der Waals constants given are a = 1.352 dm⁶ atm mol⁻² and b = 0.0387 dm³ mol⁻¹. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right pressure at 500 K.

Hmm, right, the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n²/V²))(V/n - b) = RT. But wait, I think the units might be tricky here because the volume is given in cubic meters, and the van der Waals constants are in dm³ and dm⁶. I remember that 1 m³ is 1000 liters, and 1 liter is 0.001 m³. Oh wait, no, wait—1 m³ is 1000 dm³ because 1 dm is 0.1 m, so (0.1 m)^3 = 0.001 m³, so 1 m³ = 1000 dm³. So, I need to convert the volume from m³ to dm³ to match the units of a and b.

The volume V is 1.000 m³, which is 1000 dm³.

Next, I need to find the number of moles, n, of nitrogen. The mass is 92.4 kg, and the molar mass of nitrogen (N₂) is about 28 g/mol. So, 92.4 kg is 92400 grams. Dividing by 28 gives n = 92400 / 28 = let me calculate that.

92400 divided by 28: 28*3000=84000, 92400-84000=8400. 28*300=8400. So total is 3000 + 300 = 3300 mol. So n=3300 mol.

Wait, is that right? 28 grams per mole, 92400 grams. 92400 / 28: 28 * 3300 = 92400. Yes, correct. So n=3300 mol.

Now, the van der Waals equation is:

[P + a(n/V)^2] [V/n - b] = RT

But wait, let's make sure about the form. Another way to write it is:

[P + (a (n^2))/(V^2)] * (V/n - b) = R T

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as:

[P + a (n²)/(V²)] [ (V - b n) / n ] = R T

But to avoid confusion, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the units given.

Wait, the constants a and b are in dm^6 atm mol^-2 and dm^3 mol^-1, so I should convert all variables to those units.

So, V is 1000 dm³, n is 3300 mol, T is 500 K.

R is the gas constant. Wait, what's R in these units? Because the pressure is in atm, I think R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K). Yes, that's right.

So R = 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K).

Now, plugging into the van der Waals equation:

P + [a * (n^2) / V^2] multiplied by [ (V / n) - b ] = R T

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute a * (n^2) / V^2.

a =1.352 dm^6·atm/mol²

n = 3300 mol

V =1000 dm³

So (n²) = (3300)^2 = 10,890,000 mol².

V² = (1000)^2 = 1,000,000 dm^6.

So a*(n²/V²) = 1.352 * (10,890,000) / 1,000,000.

Let me compute that.

10,890,000 / 1,000,000 = 10.89.

So 1.352 * 10.89 ≈ 14.70 atm.

Wait, that's because the units for a are dm^6 atm/mol², and V is in dm³, so V² is dm^6. So the units would be (dm^6·atm/mol²) * (mol²/dm^6) )= atm. So this term is in atm.

Next, compute (V/n) - b.

V/n = 1000 / 3300 ≈ 0.30303 dm³/mol.

b is 0.0387 dm³/mol.

So V/n - b ≈ 0.30303 - 0.0387 = 0.26433 dm³/mol.

Now, multiply the two terms: [a(n²/V²)] * [V/n - b] = 14.70 atm * 0.26433 dm³/mol.

Wait, but this would give (atm) * (dm³/mol) = (dm³·atm)/mol. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, the van der Waals equation is:

[P + (a n²)/(V²)] * [ (V/n) - b ] = R T

So in this case, the first term [P + (a n²)/(V²)] is in atm, and the second term [ (V/n) - b ] is in dm³/mol.

Wait, but how do the units balance? Because the left side is (atm) * (dm³/mol) and the right side is R T, which is in (dm³·atm)/(mol·K) * K, so (dm³·atm)/mol.

So the units on both sides should match. So that's correct.

So, the left side is (P + 14.70 atm) multiplied by 0.26433 dm³/mol.

So, compute (P + 14.70) * 0.26433 = R T.

R T = 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K) * 500 K = 41.05 dm³·atm/mol.

So the equation becomes:

(P + 14.70) * 0.26433 = 41.05

Now, solve for P.

Divide both sides by 0.26433:

P +14.70 = 41.05 / 0.26433 ≈ let me calculate that.

41.05 divided by 0.26433.

Let me compute 41.05 / 0.26433:

Approximately, 0.26433 * 155 = ?

0.26433 * 150 = 39.6495

0.26433 *5 = 1.32165 → total 40.97115, which is close to 41.05.

So 155 *0.26433≈40.971, which is just a bit less than 41.05. So perhaps 155.15? Let me compute 41.05 / 0.26433.

Using calculator steps:

41.05 ÷ 0.26433 ≈ let's do 41050 ÷ 264.33 ≈

Well, 264.33 * 155 = 264.33 * 150 = 39649.5, plus 264.33 *5=1321.65 → total 40971.15.

So 264.33 * 155.1 = 264.33*155 + 264.33*0.1.

264.33 *155=40971.15

264.33 *0.1=26.433 → total 40971.15 +26.433=41, 0, let me see 40971.15 +26.433=40997.583.

Wait, but 41.05 is 4105 in the same units. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute 41.05 ÷ 0.26433.

Using a calculator, 41.05 ÷ 0.26433 ≈ 155.25.

So, P +14.70 ≈155.25 → P ≈155.25 -14.70 =140.55 atm.

So approximately 140.5 atm. Looking at the options, option A is 140 atm, option B is 130, option C 120, D 150, etc. So the closest is 140 atm, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps because I might have made a calculation error.

First, n=92400g /28g/mol = 3300 mol. Correct.

V=1000 dm³.

a=1.352 dm^6·atm/mol²

a*(n²/V²)=1.352*(3300^2)/(1000^2)

3300^2=10,890,000.

1000^2=1,000,000.

10,890,000 / 1,000,000 =10.89.

1.352 *10.89=14.70 atm. Correct.

V/n=1000/3300≈0.30303 dm³/mol.

b=0.0387 dm³/mol.

V/n - b=0.30303-0.0387=0.26433 dm³/mol. Correct.

RT=0.0821 *500=41.05 dm³·atm/mol.

Equation: (P+14.70)*0.26433=41.05 → P+14.70=41.05/0.26433≈155.25 → P≈140.55 atm. So option A is 140 atm.

To determine the pressure of nitrogen at 500 K using the van der Waals equation, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert Volume to dm³**: The volume \( V \) is given as \( 1.000 \, \mathrm{m}^3 \), which is equivalent to \( 1000 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \).

2. **Calculate Moles of Nitrogen**: The mass of nitrogen is \( 92.4 \, \mathrm{kg} \), and its molar mass is \( 28 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \). Thus, the number of moles \( n \) is:
   \[
   n = \frac{92400 \, \mathrm{g}}{28 \, \mathrm{g/mol}} = 3300 \, \mathrm{mol}.
   \]

3. **Van der Waals Equation**: The equation is:
   \[
   \left( P + \frac{a n^2}{V^2} \right) \left( \frac{V}{n} - b \right) = RT.
   \]
   Here, \( a = 1.352 \, \mathrm{dm}^6 \, \mathrm{atm} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-2} \), \( b = 0.0387 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \), \( R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1} \), and \( T = 500 \, \mathrm{K} \).

4. **Calculate \( \frac{a n^2}{V^2} \)**:
   \[
   \frac{a n^2}{V^2} = \frac{1.352 \times (3300)^2}{(1000)^2} = 14.70 \, \mathrm{atm}.
   \]

5. **Calculate \( \frac{V}{n} - b \)**:
   \[
   \frac{V}{n} = \frac{1000}{3300} \approx 0.30303 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1},
   \]
   \[
   \frac{V}{n} - b = 0.30303 - 0.0387 = 0.26433 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}.
   \]

6. **Calculate \( RT \)**:
   \[
   RT = 0.0821 \times 500 = 41.05 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}.
   \]

7. **Solve for \( P \)**:
   \[
   \left( P + 14.70 \right) \times 0.26433 = 41.05,
   \]
   \[
   P + 14.70 = \frac{41.05}{0.26433} \approx 155.25,
   \]
   \[
   P \approx 155.25 - 14.70 = 140.55 \, \mathrm{atm}.
   \]

The closest option to \( 140.55 \, \mathrm{atm} \) is **140 atm**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
