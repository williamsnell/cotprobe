Okay, so I've got this question about finding the input impedance of a transmission line. Hmm, I remember that transmission lines can be a bit tricky, but let's see what I can recall.

The question says it's a 50-ohm line terminated in +j50 ohms, and the line length is such that βd equals π radians. Wait, β is the phase constant, right? So βd is the phase shift over the length of the line. Oh right, βd = (2π/λ) * d, where d is the length. But in this case, they've given βd = π. That means the phase shift is π radians, which is 180 degrees. So the line is a half wavelength long? Because a full wavelength is 2π, so half of that is π. So the line is a half wavelength long.

Now, the line is terminated in a load Z_L of +j50 ohms. I know that for transmission lines, the input impedance depends on the load impedance and the characteristics of the line. The formula for the input impedance Z_in when the line is lossless (assuming it's lossless here) and for a specific length is given by the standard formula involving the load impedance and the propagation constant.

The general formula is Z_in = Z_0 * (Z_L + jZ_0 tan(βd)) / (Z_0 + jZ_L tan(βd)), where Z_0 is the characteristic impedance of the line. But wait, if the line is lossless and the length is a multiple of half-wavelengths, there are some simplifications.

Wait, when the line is a half-wavelength long (βd = π), the input impedance becomes equal to the load impedance, but with a sign change if I'm thinking about it correctly. Because for a half-wavelength, the impedance looking into the line would be the same as the load but inverted. Oh wait, let me think. For a transmission line, when the length is a multiple of half-wavelengths, the input impedance is equal to the load impedance. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me double-check.

No, wait, for a transmission line that's a half-wavelength long (βd = π), the input impedance Z_in is equal to the load impedance Z_L. Because the phase shift is 180 degrees, so the voltage and current waves invert, but the impedance as seen from the input end would be the same as the load. Or is it the opposite? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, let's use the formula. Let me plug in the values. Z_0 is 50 ohms, βd is π, and Z_L is j50 ohms.

So Z_in = Z_0 * (Z_L + jZ_0 tan(βd)) / (Z_0 + jZ_L tan(βd)). 

Wait, tan(π) is zero because tan(180 degrees) is zero. So the formula simplifies. Let me compute tan(π) = 0. So substituting:

Z_in = 50 * (j50 + j*50*0) / (50 + j*j50*0) 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator becomes j50 + 0 = j50

Denominator becomes 50 + 0 = 50

So Z_in = 50 * (j50 / 50) = 50 * j1 = j50 ohms. 

Wait, that's j50. So looking at the options, option J is j50 ohms. But wait, let me think again because another approach might give a different result.

Alternatively, for a transmission line of length d where d = λ/2, the input impedance Z_in is equal to the load impedance Z_L. Because the line is a half-wavelength, so the voltage and current patterns cause the input impedance to match the load. But wait, if Z_L is j50, then Z_in would be j50. So that matches with what I got earlier using the formula.

But another approach: When the line is a half-wavelength, the input impedance Z_in is equal to Z_L. So if Z_L is j50, then Z_in is j50. So that's option J.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when the line is a half-wavelength, the input impedance is the complex conjugate of the load. Oh wait, no, that's for impedance matching when using stubs or something else. No, in this case, the line is a transmission line, not a matching section. So the input impedance should just be the same as the load, but perhaps I should be more precise.

Alternatively, using the formula again. I think I did it right. So the answer should be j50 ohms, which is option J.

The input impedance of a 50-ohm transmission line terminated in a load impedance \( Z_L = +j50 \, \Omega \) for a line length such that \( \beta d = \pi \) radians is determined using the formula for transmission line input impedance. 

For a lossless transmission line, the input impedance \( Z_{\text{in}} \) is given by:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + j Z_0 \tan(\beta d)}{Z_0 + j Z_L \tan(\beta d)}
\]

Here, \( Z_0 = 50 \, \Omega \), \( \beta d = \pi \), and \( \tan(\pi) = 0 \). Substituting these values simplifies the formula:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = 50 \cdot \frac{j50 + 0}{50 + 0} = 50 \cdot \frac{j50}{50} = j50 \, \Omega
\]

Additionally, for a half-wavelength line (\( \beta d = \pi \)), the input impedance matches the load impedance. Since the load impedance is \( +j50 \, \Omega \), the input impedance is also \( +j50 \, \Omega \).

Thus, the correct answer is **J: \( j50 \, \Omega \)**.
