Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which fiscal policy is best when the economy has an inflationary gap. Okay, let's start by recalling what an inflationary gap is. From what I remember, it's when the actual GDP is higher than the potential GDP. This usually means the economy is overheating, leading to higher prices and inflation. So, the goal here would be to cool down the economy, right?

Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. I think when the economy is overheating, the government should implement contractionary fiscal policies. These are meant to reduce aggregate demand, which should help bring down inflation.

Looking at the options, each one combines changes in spending and taxes. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Decrease both taxes and spending. Hmm, that sounds like expansionary fiscal policy, which would actually increase aggregate demand. That would probably make inflation worse, so A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Keep taxes and spending unchanged. Well, if nothing changes, the economy might stay in the inflationary gap. But I don't think this is the most effective approach. The government should take action, so B is likely not the best choice.

Option C: Increase spending and keep taxes the same. Wait, increasing spending would increase aggregate demand, which would make inflation worse. That doesn't seem right for an inflationary gap. So C is probably not the answer.

Option D: Increase spending and taxes. So, spending up and taxes up. Higher taxes reduce disposable income, which decreases consumption, so that's contractionary. But increasing spending would have the opposite effect. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the net effect depends on which is stronger? Not sure yet. Let's keep this in mind.

Option E: Decrease taxes and increase spending. That's definitely expansionary. Both actions would increase aggregate demand, which would worsen inflation. So E is not the right choice.

Option F: Increase taxes and decrease spending. Oh, that's contractionary. Higher taxes reduce people's money, so they spend less. Decreasing government spending also reduces demand. So this would help reduce the inflationary gap. F sounds like a good candidate.

Option G: Increase both taxes and spending. Wait, that's a mix. If taxes go up, that's contractionary, but spending up is expansionary. I'm not sure about this one. It depends on which effect is stronger. But generally, the most straightforward contractionary policy is increasing taxes and decreasing spending, so G might not be the best.

Option H: Decrease taxes and keep spending the same. Lower taxes would mean more disposable income, leading to higher consumption. That's expansionary, which would increase inflation further. So H is not the answer.

Option I: Decrease spending and keep taxes unchanged. Reducing government spending would lower aggregate demand, which is contractionary. That should help reduce inflation. So I is a possible option.

Option J: Keep spending the same and decrease taxes. Again, lower taxes mean more spending, which is expansionary. That would make inflation worse, so J isn't the right choice.

Now, I have to choose between options F and I. Option F is increasing taxes and decreasing spending, while I is just decreasing spending with taxes unchanged.

Which is more effective? I think contractionary fiscal policy can be done through either reducing spending, increasing taxes, or both. The most effective might be a combination, but in the options, F does both. However, sometimes just decreasing spending might be sufficient without the need to raise taxes, or maybe raising taxes without cutting spending. But in this case, the question is asking which is most effective.

Wait, but in an inflationary gap, the goal is to reduce AD. So either option I (cut spending) or F (cut spending and raise taxes) would both work. But which is more effective? Maybe combining both is more powerful. However, sometimes raising taxes can be less effective because it might not reduce consumption as much as cutting government projects, which directly reduce demand.

Alternatively, decreasing spending alone (option I) might be sufficient. I'm a bit torn here. Let me think again.

Inflationary gap: economy above potential, so need to reduce AD. Contractionary fiscal policy: either decrease G (government spending), increase T (taxes), or both.

Option I: G decreases, T same. So that's contractionary.

Option F: G decreases, T increases. So that's more contractionary.

But the question is which is "most effective." So perhaps doing both is more effective than just one. But in reality, sometimes the combined effect might lead to a larger impact. However, I'm not sure if the question considers the net effect. Alternatively, maybe the most effective is just decreasing spending because that directly reduces government demand, which is a big part of AD.

Wait, another point: increasing taxes reduces disposable income, leading to lower consumption. So option F would have both effects: lower government spending and lower consumption. So that would reduce AD more than just option I. So F might be more effective.

But wait, in reality, sometimes increasing taxes can have a negative multiplier effect. The government spending has a higher multiplier than tax changes. So maybe just cutting spending is more effective. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, considering that the government can't just cut spending without any consideration, but when they do, it's a direct way to reduce demand. So perhaps option I is the better choice.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: during an inflationary gap, the appropriate fiscal policy is contractionary. So the government should either cut spending, raise taxes, or both. The most effective would be the one that reduces AD the most.

Option F: both. Option I: only spending. Which is better? Well, the combined effect would be more, but perhaps the political feasibility is an issue. But in terms of effectiveness, the combined would be more effective.

But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think of examples. For instance, if the government both cuts spending and raises taxes, that would take money out of the economy in two ways: by not buying as much and by taking more in taxes. So that should reduce AD more than just cutting spending alone.

So perhaps F is the correct answer. But wait, when I look at the options again, option F is "increases taxes and decreases spending." So that's contractionary.

Wait, wait, no, the user wrote the options as:

Option F: The government increases taxes and decreases spending.

Yes, that's correct. So that's a contractionary policy. So F is a contractionary fiscal policy, which is what we need during an inflationary gap.

But earlier, I thought that option I (decrease spending, taxes same) is also contractionary. So which one is more effective?

I think the most effective would be the one that reduces AD the most. So if both are contractionary, then combining them (F) would have a bigger impact than just one (I). So F would be more effective.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to find a textbook answer. From what I remember, contractionary fiscal policy involves either decreasing government spending or increasing taxes, or both. However, the most effective might be a combination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, sometimes the question considers the effect on the economy. For example, decreasing spending directly reduces government purchases, which have a high multiplier effect. Raising taxes reduces disposable income, which reduces consumption, but the multiplier effect for taxes is lower than for government spending.

So perhaps cutting spending alone (option I) is more effective than raising taxes and cutting spending (option F). Because the spending cut has a higher multiplier. So maybe I is the better option.

Wait, but the question is about which policy is most effective. If both are contractionary, but one is more effective, which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: decrease spending and keep taxes. Because that's a contractionary policy without the adverse effects of higher taxes, which might reduce the incentive to work.

But I'm still a bit confused. Let me think of it differently. The goal is to reduce the inflationary gap, which is when AD is too high. So we need to reduce AD. The two main tools are government spending and taxes.

If the government cuts spending, that reduces AD directly. If they raise taxes, that also reduces AD, but perhaps less effectively. So combining both (option F) would have a bigger impact. But sometimes, raising taxes can lead to lower consumer spending, which might not be as effective as cutting government projects.

Wait, perhaps the most effective is to cut spending, as it directly removes demand. So I think option I is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to visualize the AD-AS model. When there's an inflationary gap, AD is above potential GDP. To bring it down, we need to shift AD left. Contractionary fiscal policy does that.

So, to shift AD left, either decrease G or increase T. So both F and I do that, but F does both. So F would shift AD more than I. So F should be more effective.

But wait, I thought that the spending multiplier is higher. For example, if the government cuts spending by $1 billion, AD decreases by more than $1 billion because of the multiplier effect. Similarly, if taxes increase by $1 billion, the decrease in AD is less because people might save some of the extra taxes.

So combining both would have a bigger effect. So option F would be more effective than option I.

Therefore, the correct answer is F: The government increases taxes and decreases spending.

The question asks which fiscal policy is most effective during an inflationary gap, where the economy is overheating and inflation is a concern. An inflationary gap occurs when actual GDP exceeds potential GDP, leading to higher prices. The appropriate fiscal policy in this scenario is contractionary, aimed at reducing aggregate demand (AD) to bring the economy back to potential GDP.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Decreasing both taxes and spending is expansionary, which would worsen inflation. Not suitable.
- **Option B**: Keeping taxes and spending unchanged does nothing to address the inflationary gap. Not effective.
- **Option C**: Increasing spending and keeping taxes unchanged is expansionary, increasing AD and inflation. Not suitable.
- **Option D**: Increasing spending and taxes has mixed effects. While higher taxes reduce demand, increased spending has the opposite effect. Not the most effective.
- **Option E**: Decreasing taxes and increasing spending is strongly expansionary, worsening inflation. Not suitable.
- **Option F**: Increasing taxes and decreasing spending is contractionary. Both actions reduce AD, making it a strong candidate.
- **Option G**: Increasing both taxes and spending is mixed and less clear in its effect. Not the best choice.
- **Option H**: Decreasing taxes and keeping spending unchanged is expansionary, increasing inflation. Not suitable.
- **Option I**: Decreasing spending and keeping taxes unchanged is contractionary, reducing AD. A good candidate.
- **Option J**: Keeping spending unchanged and decreasing taxes is expansionary, increasing inflation. Not suitable.

### Comparison Between F and I:
Both **F** (increase taxes and decrease spending) and **I** (decrease spending, taxes unchanged) are contractionary. However, **F** combines two contractionary measures, which would reduce AD more effectively than **I** alone. While government spending cuts have a higher multiplier effect, raising taxes also contributes to reducing demand. Therefore, **F** is more effective as it combines both tools.

**Answer: F**
