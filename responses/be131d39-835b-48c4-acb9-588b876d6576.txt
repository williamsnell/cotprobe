B: 74 km/h
C: 72 km/h
D: 70 km/h
E: 82 km/h
F: 78 km/h
G: 75 km/h
H: 68 km/h

Okay, so I need to find the unit rate for driving 308 km in 4 hours. Hmm, unit rate usually means how much distance is covered per unit of time, so in this case, kilometers per hour. Right, so I think I should divide the total distance by the total time to get the speed.

Let me write that down. So, 308 km divided by 4 hours. Let me do the division. 308 รท 4. I know that 4 times 70 is 280, and 4 times 77 is 308 because 70*4=280, 7*4=28, so 70+7=77, and 77*4=308. Oh wait, that's right, so 308 divided by 4 is exactly 77. So the unit rate is 77 km/h.

Now I need to check the options. Let me look at the choices again. Option I is 77 km/h. So that should be the correct answer. I don't think I need to round because it's a whole number already, so to the nearest hundredth would still be 77.00, which is just 77. So yeah, I'm confident that I is the right choice.

The unit rate is calculated by dividing 308 km by 4 hours, resulting in exactly 77 km/h. Therefore, the correct answer is I.

Answer: I
