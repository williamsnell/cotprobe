Question:

In 1976 it was mistakenly believed that the first of the 'superheavy' elements had been discovered in a sample of mica. Its atomic number  was believed to be 126. What is the most probable distance of the innermost electrons from the nucleus of an atom of this element? (In such elements, relativistic effects are very important, but ignore them here.)

Options:

A: 0.12 $\mathrm{pm}$
B: 0.72 $\mathrm{pm}$
C: 0.82 $\mathrm{pm}$
D: 0.22 $\mathrm{pm}$
E: 0.02 $\mathrm{pm}$
F: 0.62 $\mathrm{pm}$
G:  0.42 $\mathrm{pm}$
H: 0.32 $\mathrm{pm}$
I: 0.52 $\mathrm{pm}$
J: 0.92 $\mathrm{pm}$

Okay, so I have this question about the innermost electrons of a superheavy element with atomic number 126. The question is asking for the most probable distance of these electrons from the nucleus. The options are given from A to J, with various picometers.

First, I remember that the most probable distance of an electron from the nucleus in an atom is given by the Bohr model for hydrogen-like atoms. The formula for the most probable radius is (n² * a₀) / Z, where a₀ is the Bohr radius, n is the principal quantum number, and Z is the atomic number.

Since the question is about the innermost electrons, they should be in the 1s orbital, which corresponds to n=1. So the formula simplifies to a₀ / Z.

The Bohr radius a₀ is approximately 0.529 picometers. So plugging in Z=126, the calculation would be 0.529 pm / 126.

Let me do that division: 0.529 divided by 126. Hmm, 126 times 4 is 504, which is just under 529, so maybe around 0.0042 or 0.004 something. Wait, wait. Let me compute it properly.

0.529 divided by 126. Let's see, 126 times 0.004 is 0.504. Subtract that from 0.529: 0.529 - 0.504 = 0.025. So 0.025 left. 0.025 / 126 is approximately 0.000198. So adding up, 0.004 + 0.000198 is about 0.004198 picometers. Wait, that can't be right because 0.004 pm is 4 femtometers, which seems extremely small, but given Z is 126, maybe that's correct.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.02 pm, which is 0.02 picometers, which is ten times larger than what I calculated. My calculation gave about 0.0042 pm, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options don't have 0.004. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the effective nuclear charge more accurately, but the question says to ignore relativistic effects, so maybe the simple formula applies.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I confused the most probable radius with the Bohr radius. The most probable radius for the 1s orbital in hydrogen is a₀, so for hydrogen-like atoms, it's a₀/Z. So for Z=126, it's 0.529 pm /126 ≈ 0.0042 pm.

But looking at the options, the closest is E: 0.02 pm, which is 10 times larger. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check. 0.529 divided by 126: 126 goes into 529 four times (4*126=504), remainder 25. Then 25/126 ≈ 0.198, so 0.4198 pm? Wait, no, wait, 0.529 is in pm, so 0.529 / 126 is 0.004198 pm, which is approximately 0.0042 pm. That's 4.2 femtometers, which is 0.0042 pm.

But none of the options are near that. The options are from 0.02 pm up. Did I miscalculate?

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is about the radius in a different context. Maybe it's not the 1s orbital but another orbital. But innermost is 1s, so n=1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the radius of the nucleus itself, but no, the question is about the electrons.

Wait, maybe I confused the Bohr radius. The Bohr radius is about 0.529 angstroms, which is 52.9 pm. Wait, no, 1 angstrom is 100 pm, so 0.529 angstroms is 52.9 pm. Wait, no, the Bohr radius a₀ is approximately 0.529 ×10^-10 meters, which is 0.529 picometers. So my initial calculation was correct.

So 0.529 pm /126 ≈ 0.0042 pm. But none of the options match that. The options are A:0.12, B:0.72, and so on. The smallest option is E:0.02 pm, which is 2 femtometers. Wait, maybe I messed up the decimal places. Let me recheck: 0.529 divided by 126.

Let me compute 529 divided by 126000. Because 0.529 pm is 529 femtometers. Wait no, 1 pm is 1e-12 m, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 m. So 0.529 pm is 529 femtometers.

Wait, no, more accurately, 1 pm is 1000 femtometers. So 0.529 pm is 529 femtometers.

So 529 femtometers / 126 ≈ 4.2 femtometers, which is 0.0042 pm.

But the options don't have that. The closest is E:0.02 pm, which is 20 femtometers. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the radius as a multiple of a₀/Z, but maybe I should use a different approach. Wait, maybe the formula is different. For hydrogen-like atoms, the most probable radius is (n² a₀)/Z. So for n=1, it's a₀/Z. So correct.

Wait, maybe I should check the exact value of a₀. The Bohr radius is approximately 0.529177 pm. So 0.529177 /126 = ?

Let me compute 0.529177 / 126.

126 × 0.0042 = 0.5292. Wait, because 126 × 0.004 = 0.504, 126 ×0.0042 = 0.5292. So 0.529177 / 126 ≈ 0.0042 pm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question expects an approximate value, but none of the options are close. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the radius of the nucleus, but that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: maybe the question is considering the effective nuclear charge, but the question says to ignore relativistic effects, so maybe just the basic formula applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the radius in a different unit. Wait, the Bohr radius is 0.529 pm, so 0.529 /126 ≈ 0.0042 pm.

Wait, looking at the options, the only one that's close to 0.004 is E:0.02 pm, but that's an order of magnitude higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question is referring to the radius of the 1s orbital in a different way, perhaps using the concept of the effective charge or screening. But without relativistic effects, it's probably just the simple formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the most probable radius with the expectation value. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the radius of the electron cloud, but the most probable distance is the radius where the probability density is highest.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 0.529 divided by 126 again.

0.529 ÷ 126.

126 × 0.004 = 0.504.

0.529 -0.504=0.025.

0.025 ÷ 126 ≈ 0.000198.

So total is 0.004198 pm, which is approximately 0.0042 pm.

Hmm, but that's not among the options. The closest option is E:0.02 pm, which is about 5 times larger. Did I perhaps miss a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait, no, because the Bohr radius is 0.529 pm, so 0.529 pm divided by 126 is indeed about 0.0042 pm.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is E:0.02 pm. But that's 5 times larger than my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the radius is not just a₀/Z but perhaps includes some other factor, like the fact that for higher Z, the radius decreases, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I've made a mistake. But given the options, the closest is E:0.02 pm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the radius as the radius of the nucleus plus the electron's position. But no, the nucleus is much smaller than that. The radius of a nucleus is on the order of femtometers, way smaller than the electron's position.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the radius in terms of the ionization energy or something else, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The most probable radius for the 1s orbital is indeed a₀/(Z*(1 + δ)), where δ is a correction factor. But the question says to ignore relativistic effects, so perhaps δ is zero, so it's a₀/Z.

So again, 0.529 pm /126 ≈0.0042 pm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the radius of the innermost shell, not the most probable distance. Or perhaps it's referring to the radius of the nucleus itself, but that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the Bohr radius, like 0.529 angstroms, which is 52.9 pm. Wait, that can't be right because that's way larger than the options. No, the Bohr radius is 0.529 pm.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing pm with am or something else. No, the options are in pm.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to 0.0042 pm, but the options don't have that. The closest is E:0.02 pm, which is about 5 times larger. Maybe the intended answer is E, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the division.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.529 /126 more accurately.

Let me compute 0.529 divided by 126.

126 ×0.004 = 0.504.

0.529 -0.504=0.025.

So 0.025/126 = 0.0001984 approx.

So total is 0.0041984 pm, which is about 0.0042 pm.

I think I'm correct, but it's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the radius of the atom, not the electron. The radius of the atom is roughly a₀*(n²/Z), but for the innermost electrons, n=1, so a₀/Z. Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the radius of the 1s orbital in a different way. The most probable radius is a₀/Z, but the expectation value is a₀/(Z²). Wait, no, no. The expectation value for the radius in 1s is (a₀/Z)* (something). Let me recall: The expectation value for the radius in 1s is a₀/Z * (1 + ...) but without relativistic effects, it's a₀/Z.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the radius in terms of the effective nuclear charge. But the question says to ignore relativistic effects, so maybe it's just a simple calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the radius of the nucleus plus the electron's position. But the nucleus radius R is roughly (1.2×10^-15 m) × Z^(1/3). For Z=126, R≈1.2e-15 * (126)^(1/3). Cube root of 126 is about 5. So R≈1.2e-15 *5 =6e-15 meters, which is 6 femtometers, or 0.06 pm. But the electron's most probable distance is about 0.0042 pm, so the total would be around 0.064 pm, which is still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula, like radius = a₀ * Z^{-1/3} or something. Let me think: For multi-electron atoms, the radius scales with Z^{-1/3} for the atomic radius, but that's not the same as the most probable electron radius.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the screening effect, but the question says to ignore relativistic effects, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the radius as being proportional to a₀ / Z, which is what I did. So 0.529 /126 ≈0.0042 pm.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is E:0.02 pm, which is 5 times larger. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the radius in terms of the core electrons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the radius in terms of the ionization energy. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the 1s electrons are deeply bound, so their radius is very small, but the options don't reflect that. The smallest option is E:0.02 pm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E:0.02 pm, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is 0.529 pm divided by 26, which would give around 0.02 pm, but why 26? Wait, no, the atomic number is 126.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is using a different value for the Bohr radius, like 0.529 angstroms (52.9 pm), but that would give 52.9 pm /126 ≈0.42 pm, which is option G:0.42 pm.

Wait, that's interesting. So if a₀ is taken as 0.529 angstroms, which is 52.9 pm, then 52.9 /126≈0.42 pm, which is option G.

But the Bohr radius is 0.529 pm, not 0.529 angstroms. So perhaps the confusion is between pm and angstroms.

Wait, perhaps the question intended the Bohr radius as 0.529 angstroms, which is 52.9 pm, leading to 52.9/126≈0.42 pm, which is option G.

But I'm pretty sure the Bohr radius is 0.529 pm. So perhaps the intended answer is G:0.42 pm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question made a mistake in the units, and the correct answer is E:0.02 pm.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

If a₀ is 0.529 pm, then 0.529 /126 ≈0.0042 pm, which isn't an option.

If a₀ is taken as 0.529 angstroms (52.9 pm), then 52.9 /126≈0.42 pm, which is option G.

So perhaps the question intended the Bohr radius as 0.529 angstroms, leading to option G.

But I'm not sure. The standard Bohr radius is 0.529 pm, so perhaps the correct answer is E:0.02 pm. But wait, 0.529 pm is 0.529e-12 m. 0.529e-12 /126 ≈4.2e-15 m, which is 4.2 femtometers or 0.0042 pm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the radius in a different way, like the radius of the nucleus plus the electron's position. The nucleus radius R is roughly (1.2e-15 m)*Z^(1/3). For Z=126, cube root is about 5, so R≈6e-15 m or 0.06 pm. Adding the electron's 0.0042 pm gives about 0.10 pm, which is close to option A:0.12 pm. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the radius as the average distance, not the most probable. The average distance (expectation value) for 1s is a₀/Z, same as the most probable.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculation, the correct answer should be approximately 0.0042 pm, but that's not an option. The closest option is E:0.02 pm, which is about 5 times larger. Alternatively, if the Bohr radius was taken as 0.529 angstroms, then the answer would be G:0.42 pm.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is G:0.42 pm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the atomic number is 26, which would give 0.529 pm /26≈0.02 pm, which is E. But the question says atomic number 126.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the radius of the nucleus, which is ~0.06 pm, but that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about the radius of the 1s orbital, not the electron's most probable radius. The radius of the 1s orbital in hydrogen is a₀, but for hydrogen-like atoms, it's a₀/Z.

So, 0.529 pm /126 ≈0.0042 pm.

But again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the radius in terms of the radius of the atom, which is larger, but that's not what the question says.

Given all that, I think the intended answer is E:0.02 pm, perhaps due to a miscalculation or a typo in the problem. Alternatively, if the Bohr radius is taken as 0.529 angstroms (52.9 pm), then 52.9/126≈0.42 pm, which is option G.

But the Bohr radius is definitely 0.529 pm, so I think the correct answer based on that is not among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.02 pm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

0.529 divided by 126.

126 ×0.004 = 0.504.

0.529 -0.504 = 0.025.

0.025 /126 = approx 0.000198.

So total is 0.004198 pm, which is 0.0042 pm.

Hmm. So I'm confident in that calculation, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is E:0.02 pm, perhaps due to a miscalculation or a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the radius in terms of the effective nuclear charge, but without relativistic effects, I don't think that's the case.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is E:0.02 pm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is G:0.42 pm if the Bohr radius was considered as 0.529 angstroms.
</think>

The question asks for the most probable distance of the innermost electrons from the nucleus of an element with atomic number 126, ignoring relativistic effects. Using the Bohr model for hydrogen-like atoms, the most probable radius is given by \( \frac{a_0}{Z} \), where \( a_0 \) is the Bohr radius (\( 0.529 \, \text{pm} \)) and \( Z \) is the atomic number.

For \( Z = 126 \), the calculation is:

\[
\text{Radius} = \frac{0.529 \, \text{pm}}{126} \approx 0.0042 \, \text{pm}.
\]

This value is not among the provided options. The closest option is **E: 0.02 pm**, which is about five times larger than the calculated value. Another possibility is that the Bohr radius was incorrectly taken as \( 0.529 \, \text{angstroms} \) (which is \( 52.9 \, \text{pm} \)), leading to:

\[
\text{Radius} = \frac{52.9 \, \text{pm}}{126} \approx 0.42 \, \text{pm},
\]

which corresponds to option **G: 0.42 pm**. However, the standard Bohr radius is \( 0.529 \, \text{pm} \), making this interpretation less likely.

Given the options and the calculations, the most reasonable choice is **E: 0.02 pm**, despite the discrepancy, as it is the closest to the calculated value.

Answer: E
