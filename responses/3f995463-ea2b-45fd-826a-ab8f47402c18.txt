Options:

A: Lake B is alkaline.

Okay, so I have this question about the pH of two lakes, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me start by breaking down what I know about pH and the options given.

The question says Lake A has a pH of 8.0, and Lake B has a pH of 6.0. I remember that pH levels below 7 are acidic, 7 is neutral, and above 7 is alkaline or basic. So right away, I can note that Lake A is alkaline because pH 8 is above 7, and Lake B is acidic because pH 6 is below 7. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Lake B is alkaline. Wait, no, because pH 6 is acidic. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Lake B is acidic, so it can't be more alkaline than Lake A. Plus, the pH scale is logarithmic, so each whole number is a tenfold difference. But here, Lake B is lower than A, so it's more acidic, not alkaline. So B is wrong.

Option C: The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 10^-4 M. Wait, the concentration is [H+]. The pH is -log[H+], so for Lake B, pH 6 means [H+] is 10^-6 M, right? Because pH = 6 â†’ H+ = 1e-6. So option C says 1e-4, which is pH 4, so that's incorrect. So C is wrong.

Option D: The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain. Acid rain is acidic, so when it falls, it adds more H+ ions to the water. For Lake A (pH 8, alkaline), adding acid would lower its pH, making it less alkaline but not necessarily more acidic. For Lake B (pH 6, already acidic), adding acid would make it even more acidic, so pH would decrease further. So both lakes' pH would decrease, which would mean D is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Acid rain has a low pH, so it's adding H+ ions. For Lake A, which is alkaline, adding H+ would bring its pH down, so yes, pH decreases. Lake B is already acidic, so adding more H+ would lower its pH even more. So D is correct.

So the correct answer should be D.

The pH of Lake A is 8.0 (alkaline), and Lake B is 6.0 (acidic). Option A is incorrect because Lake B is acidic, not alkaline. Option B is incorrect because Lake B is acidic, so it cannot be more alkaline than Lake A. Option C is incorrect because the hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 10^-6 M, not 10^-4 M. Option D is correct because acid rain, being acidic, would add H+ ions to both lakes, causing their pH to decrease.

Answer: D
