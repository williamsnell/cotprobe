Question:

Mr. Cleary’s class and Ms. Ntuala’s class go to use the computer lab. There are 20 computers available, two of which do not work. Mr. Cleary’s class has 14 kids, and Ms. Ntuala’s class has 12 kids. If every student must use a computer and there can only be 2 students on a computer at most, what is the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves?

Options:

A: 2
B: 18
C: 8
D: 6
E: 16
F: 12
G: 20
H: 10
I: 24
J: 14

Okay, so I've got this problem here about two classes going to the computer lab. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says there are 20 computers, but two don't work. So that means only 18 working computers are available. Got that. Now, Mr. Cleary's class has 14 kids, and Ms. Ntuala's class has 12 kids. So together, that's 14 + 12 = 26 students. Wait, but there are only 18 working computers. Hmm, that seems tricky because each student needs a computer, right?

But wait, the problem says every student must use a computer, but there can be at most two students on one computer. So, each computer can have either one or two students. The question is asking for the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves. So, we want as many students as possible to have their own computer, and the rest can share.

Let me think. If I want to maximize the number of students with their own computer, I should minimize the number of computers that have two students. Because each computer with two students reduces the total number of individual computers used.

So, let's see. There are 26 students and 18 computers. If we use all 18 computers, the maximum number of students that can be accommodated is 18 * 2 = 36, but we only have 26, so that's more than enough. But we need to find how many can have their own computer.

Let me approach this differently. Let's say 'x' is the number of computers used by one student each. Then the remaining computers will have two students each. So, the total number of students would be x + 2*(18 - x) = 26.

Wait, let me write that properly:

x + 2*(18 - x) = 26

Expanding that: x + 36 - 2x = 26

Combine like terms: -x + 36 = 26

Subtract 36 from both sides: -x = -10

Multiply both sides by -1: x = 10

So, x is 10. That means 10 computers are used by one student each, and the remaining 8 computers are used by two students each. So, 10 students have their own computer, and 8*2=16 students share, making a total of 26 students.

Wait, but the options don't have 10 as one of the options? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:2, B:18, C:8, D:6, E:16, F:12, G:20, H:10, I:24, J:14.

Oh, H is 10. So, the answer would be H:10.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me calculate again.

Total students: 26.

Total computers:18.

Each computer can have up to two students.

We want to maximize the number of single users.

So, let x be the number of single users. Then the number of computers used by singles is x, and the remaining 18 - x computers will have two students each. So the total number of students is x + 2*(18 -x) = 26.

Simplify:

x + 36 - 2x =26

- x +36=26

- x = -10

x=10.

Yes, that's correct. So 10 students can have their own computer, and 16 will share the remaining 8 computers (since 8 computers *2 =16 students).

So the maximum number is 10, which is option H.

The maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is 10, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
