Okay, so I've got this question about trees in graph theory. The question is asking how many trees there are on n labeled vertices where none of the vertices have degree 1 or 2. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that a tree is a connected acyclic graph. For n labeled vertices, the total number of possible trees is n^(n-2) according to Cayley's formula. But that's without any restrictions on the degrees of the vertices.

The restriction here is that no vertices can have degree 1 or 2. So every vertex must have degree at least 3. Hmm, that's a significant constraint because in a tree, the sum of degrees is 2(n-1), since a tree has n-1 edges.

Wait, let's think about that. The sum of degrees equals 2 times the number of edges, which for a tree is 2(n-1). Now, if every vertex has degree at least 3, the minimum sum would be 3n, right? But 3n must be less than or equal to 2(n-1), because that's the actual sum. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check that.

If every vertex has degree ≥3, the sum would be ≥3n. But the actual sum is 2(n-1). So 3n ≤ 2(n-1). Let's see: 3n ≤ 2n - 2 → n ≤ -2. But n is greater than 1, so this can't be possible. That means there can be no such tree because the minimal sum of degrees (3n) is greater than the actual sum (2n-2) for n>1.

Wait, that seems odd. Let me think again. For example, if n=3, the sum of degrees is 4 (since 2*(3-1)=4). If each vertex must have degree ≥3, the minimal sum would be 3*3=9, which is way higher than 4. So for n=3, it's impossible. Similarly, for n=4, sum is 6. 3*4=12 >6. So no tree exists with these constraints for n>1.

So the answer would be zero. Looking at the options, H is 0.

The constraints on the degrees make it impossible for such trees to exist for n > 1. Therefore, the number of such trees is zero.

Answer: H
