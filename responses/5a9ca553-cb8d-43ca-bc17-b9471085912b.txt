Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the dissociation of HI gas. Hmm, let me see. I remember that dissociation is when a substance breaks down into its constituent parts. In this case, HI dissociates into H2 and I2. The equilibrium constant Kc is given as 21, which is a pretty large number, so I think that means the reaction favors the products, meaning a lot of HI will dissociate.

The problem states that 15 grams of HI are introduced into a 12.0-L flask. I need to find the molar concentration of iodine vapor (I2) at equilibrium. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the number of moles of HI. I know the formula for moles is mass divided by molar mass. The molar mass of HI is... let's see, H is about 1 g/mol and I is about 127 g/mol, so 1 + 127 = 128 g/mol. So moles of HI = 15 g / 128 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 15 divided by 128 is approximately 0.117 mol. So that's about 0.117 moles of HI initially.

Next, the volume of the flask is 12.0 L. So the initial concentration of HI is moles divided by volume. That would be 0.117 mol / 12.0 L ≈ 0.00975 M. So [HI] initial is around 0.00975 M.

Now, the dissociation reaction is 2 HI (g) ⇌ H2 (g) + I2 (g). Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium). 

Initial concentrations:
[HI] = 0.00975 M
[H2] = 0
[I2] = 0

Change: Let's let the change be 'x'. So for every 2 moles of HI that dissociate, 1 mole of H2 and 1 mole of I2 are formed. So, the change for HI is -2x, and for H2 and I2, it's +x each.

So at equilibrium:
[HI] = 0.00975 - 2x
[H2] = x
[I2] = x

The equilibrium expression for Kc is [H2][I2] / [HI]^2. Plugging in the values, Kc = (x)(x) / (0.00975 - 2x)^2 = 21.

So that's the equation: x² / (0.00975 - 2x)^2 = 21. Hmm, solving for x here. Let me square root both sides to make it easier. So sqrt(21) is approximately 4.5837. So we get x / (0.00975 - 2x) = 4.5837.

Let me write that as x = 4.5837 * (0.00975 - 2x). Multiplying through: x = 4.5837 * 0.00975 - 4.5837 * 2x.

Calculating 4.5837 * 0.00975. Let's see, 4.5837 * 0.01 is approximately 0.0458, so 4.5837 * 0.00975 is a bit less. Maybe around 0.0446 or so. Let's say approximately 0.0446.

So x ≈ 0.0446 - 9.1674x. Wait, because 4.5837 * 2 is 9.1674, right? So bringing the 9.1674x to the left side: x + 9.1674x ≈ 0.0446. That gives 10.1674x ≈ 0.0446. So x ≈ 0.0446 / 10.1674 ≈ 0.004389 M.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check that calculation again because I might have messed up the approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set up the equation without approximating the square root and solve it more accurately.

So the equation is x² = 21 * (0.00975 - 2x)^2. Expanding the denominator:

(0.00975 - 2x)^2 = (0.00975)^2 - 4*(0.00975)x + 4x².

So x² = 21 * [ (0.00009506) - (0.039 x) + 4x² ].

Multiplying through:

x² = 21 * 0.00009506 - 21 * 0.039 x + 21 *4 x².

Calculating each term:

21 * 0.00009506 ≈ 0.00200.

21 * 0.039 ≈ 0.819.

21 *4 = 84.

So the equation becomes:

x² = 0.00200 - 0.819 x + 84 x².

Bringing all terms to one side:

0 = 0.00200 - 0.819x + 84x² - x².

Which simplifies to:

83x² - 0.819x + 0.00200 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0. So a =83, b= -0.819, c=0.002.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a).

Calculating discriminant D = b² -4ac. Let's compute:

b² = (0.819)^2 ≈ 0.670.

4ac = 4 *83 *0.002 = 4*83=332, 332 *0.002=0.664.

So D ≈ 0.670 - 0.664 = 0.006.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.006) ≈ 0.0775.

Now compute x:

x = [0.819 ± 0.0775]/(2*83).

So two possibilities:

x1 = (0.819 + 0.0775)/166 ≈ 0.8965/166 ≈ 0.0054.

x2 = (0.819 - 0.0775)/166 ≈ 0.7415/166 ≈ 0.00446.

Wait, but let's think about this. If x is 0.0054, then the initial [HI] would be 0.00975 - 2x = 0.00975 - 0.0108 = negative, which isn't possible because concentration can't be negative. So x can't be 0.0054; that solution is extraneous. So the correct x must be the smaller value, 0.00446.

So x ≈ 0.00446 M. That's the concentration of I2, since [I2] = x.

Looking back at the options, let's see which one matches. Option E is 0.00687, which is higher. Option A is 3.6e-3, which is 0.0036. Option J is 1.9e-3, which is too low. Option I is 5.3e-3, which is about 0.0053. Hmm, none of these exactly match 0.00446.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check the quadratic equation.

Wait, when expanding (0.00975 - 2x)^2, it's (0.00975)^2 - 2*(0.00975)*(2x) + (2x)^2. Wait, no, the expansion of (a - b)^2 is a² - 2ab + b². So here, a=0.00975, b=2x. So it's (0.00975)^2 - 2*(0.00975)*(2x) + (2x)^2.

Which is 0.00009506 - 0.039x +4x². So when I multiplied by 21, I get 21*(0.00009506) = approx 0.00200, 21*(-0.039x) = -0.819x, 21*(4x²)=84x².

So the equation becomes x² = 0.00200 -0.819x +84x².

Bringing all to left: 0 = 83x² -0.819x +0.002.

So quadratic equation is correct. Then the solutions are x ≈ 0.00446 and 0.0054. But 0.0054 causes [HI] to be negative, so x must be 0.00446.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is option E (0.00687) but that's higher than our x. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should consider that the initial concentration is 0.00975 M, and when x is small, maybe the approximation 0.00975 >> 2x, so that 0.00975 -2x ≈ 0.00975. Let me try that approach.

If x is small compared to 0.00975/2, then we can approximate the denominator as (0.00975)^2, so Kc ≈ x² / (0.00975)^2 = 21.

So x² = 21 * (0.00975)^2.

Calculating (0.00975)^2 = approx 0.00009506.

21 * 0.00009506 ≈ 0.00200.

So x² ≈ 0.002, so x ≈ sqrt(0.002) ≈ 0.0447 M.

Wait, that's about 0.0447 M, but that can't be right because x can't be more than half the initial concentration, which is 0.00975/2 ≈ 0.004875. So 0.0447 is way larger than that, which would make the initial assumption invalid. So the approximation isn't valid here, meaning we can't neglect 2x compared to 0.00975.

So back to the quadratic solution. So x = [0.819 - 0.0775]/(2*83) ≈ 0.7415/166 ≈ 0.004466 M.

Looking at the options again, I don't see an option that exactly matches 0.00446. Let me check the options again:

A: 3.6e-3 → 0.0036
B: 2.1 → too high
C:4.58 → way too high
D:2.8e-3 → 0.0028
E:0.00687 →0.00687
F:9.76e-3 →0.00976
G:4.4e-3 →0.0044
H:0.015 → no
I:5.3e-3 →0.0053
J:1.9e-3 →0.0019

Wait, option G is 4.4e-3, which is 0.0044, which is very close to my calculated 0.00446. So perhaps there was a rounding difference, and the correct answer is option G, 4.4 × 10^-3 M.

But wait, the options provided don't have G as 4.4e-3? Let me check again. Oh yes, option G is 4.4 ×10^-3 M. So that's the closest to our calculated value of ~0.00446 M. So I think the answer is option G.

The problem involves the dissociation of HI into H₂ and I₂, with an equilibrium constant \( K_c = 21 \). Initially, 15 g of HI is introduced into a 12.0 L flask, and the goal is to find the equilibrium concentration of I₂.

1. **Initial moles of HI**:  
   The molar mass of HI is \( 128 \, \text{g/mol} \), so the moles of HI are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HI} = \frac{15 \, \text{g}}{128 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.117 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Initial concentration of HI**:  
   The initial concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{HI}]_{\text{initial}} = \frac{0.117 \, \text{mol}}{12.0 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.00975 \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **Equilibrium setup**:  
   The dissociation reaction is:  
   \[
   2 \, \text{HI} \, \rightleftharpoons \, \text{H}_2 + \text{I}_2.
   \]  
   Let the change in concentration be \( x \). At equilibrium:  
   \[
   [\text{HI}] = 0.00975 - 2x, \quad [\text{H}_2] = x, \quad [\text{I}_2] = x.
   \]

4. **Equilibrium expression**:  
   Substituting into the equilibrium constant:  
   \[
   K_c = \frac{[\text{H}_2][\text{I}_2]}{[\text{HI}]^2} = \frac{x^2}{(0.00975 - 2x)^2} = 21.
   \]  
   Solving this equation yields \( x \approx 0.00446 \, \text{M} \), which is the equilibrium concentration of I₂.

5. **Comparison with options**:  
   Among the given options, the closest value to \( 0.00446 \, \text{M} \) is \( 4.4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option G.

**Answer:** G
