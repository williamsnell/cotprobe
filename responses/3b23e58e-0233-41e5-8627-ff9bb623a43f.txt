Question:

A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin
B: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
C: Pelvic ultrasonography
D: CT scan of the abdomen with contrast

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a week-long history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that get worse when she has bowel movements. She started taking amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole two days ago but hasn't felt any better. 

First, I'll note her medical history. She has a 3-year history of hypertension and underwent a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy five years ago due to uterine leiomyomata. She has a BMI of 32, which is considered obese. Her symptoms include constipation for 12 years, which is intermittent. She hasn't experienced nausea, vomiting, urinary issues, or bloody stools. 

Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse 75/min, and BP 150/80 mm Hg. On exam, the abdomen is soft with tenderness in the left lower quadrant, some guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal, and stool is brown with no occult blood.

The labs: hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL (which is slightly low but not critically so), leukocyte count of 15,000/mm³ (elevated, suggesting infection or inflammation), and platelets 280,000/mm³. Serum studies and urinalysis are normal. 

So, she's been on amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole, which are typically used for infections like bacterial ones, maybe gastrointestinal, like diverticulitis or something else. But she's not improving, so the next step is to think about what could be going on.

The options are A through D: stool test for C. diff, ERCP, pelvic ultrasound, or CT abdomen with contrast.

Let me think about her symptoms. She has cramps worse with bowel movements. The constipation history is 12 years, which is a long time. The fever suggests an infection. She started on antibiotics, which didn't help. 

Possible differential diagnoses: could it be diverticulitis? Diverticulitis often causes left lower quadrant pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits. But she's had a hysterectomy, so diverticulitis is still possible in the sigmoid colon. Another thought is an infection like C. diff, which causes colitis, leading to cramps, fever, and diarrhea. But her stool is brown and no occult blood, so no obvious diarrhea or blood. 

Alternatively, could it be a UTI? But she has no urinary symptoms, and urinalysis is normal. 

She's on two antibiotics, which are usually for bacterial infections. The fact that she's not improving suggests either a resistant infection or something else. C. diff is a possibility because it's a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The stool test for C. diff toxin (option A) would be a way to check. But why isn't that the first thought?

Wait, another angle: she has a history of constipation. Could it be something mechanical like a fecal impaction causing colonic obstruction or ischemia? But then you'd expect more severe symptoms or changes in bowel movements. Her stool is normal, so maybe not. 

The physical exam shows left lower quadrant tenderness. That's classic for diverticulitis or appendicitis, but she's post-hysterectomy, so appendicitis is less likely. But wait, appendicitis can still occur; her lower abdomen tenderness could be from that. But she's on antibiotics, and appendicitis usually needs surgery. 

ERCP (option B) is for biliary or pancreatic issues. She doesn't have symptoms pointing to that, like jaundice or upper abdominal pain. So probably not ERCP. 

Pelvic ultrasound (option C) would look for issues like ovarian pathology, but she had a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, so no ovaries. Unless there's a residual mass or something, but the question doesn't mention that. Plus, her pain is lower left, which doesn't point to the pelvis as much as the colon.

CT abdomen with contrast (option D) is a good imaging study for many intra-abdominal issues. It can show diverticulitis, appendicitis, C. diff colitis, etc. But why not test for C. diff first? Because C. diff is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis, and the stool test is quick and non-invasive. If it's positive, treatment would be specific (like vancomycin or fidaxomicin). If negative, then imaging would be needed. 

Alternatively, the patient might have a different infection, like a colonic abscess, which a CT can detect. But since she's not improving on antibiotics, maybe the infection is resistant or it's not bacterial. But given the symptoms and the fact that she's on two antibiotics, C. diff is a strong consideration. 

Wait, but the stool test for C. diff is an option. It's a quick test. However, sometimes in cases where the diagnosis is unclear, imaging is done upfront. But given her history of constipation and the possibility of diverticulitis or colitis, the stool test for C. diff might be the next step. But another thought: if she's on metronidazole, which is often used for C. diff, and she's not improving, maybe it's resistant or it's another pathogen.

But the question is about the next step. So, considering all that, the most appropriate next step would be to test for C. diff. However, some might argue for imaging first. Let me think about the standard approach. Typically, in a patient with suspected colitis after antibiotics, you test for C. diff before imaging. So option A would be the next step.

But wait, the patient has a fever and abdominal pain, and the initial treatment isn't working. Could it be something else like an obstruction? But her abdomen is soft, no rebound, so unlikely. CT would be better for that. Alternatively, if the C. diff is negative, then CT would show other issues.

Hmm, maybe the best next step is a CT scan because it can evaluate for diverticulitis, appendicitis, or other intra-abdominal issues. But I'm torn because C. diff is a common cause, and testing for it is straightforward.

Wait, the lab results: leukocytosis is present, which fits with infection. But in C. diff, you might also see elevated WBCs. 

Another point: she's been on amoxicillin and clavulanate, which covers a broad range, including anaerobes, but if the infection is C. diff, which is a Gram-positive organism, metronidazole is often used. But she's on both, so that might not cover everything. Alternatively, maybe the infection is resistant. 

But the question is about the next diagnostic step, not treatment. So, if I were to choose between stool test and CT scan, which is more appropriate? 

I think the most appropriate next step is to test for C. diff because her symptoms are pointing towards colitis, she's on antibiotics, and that's a common cause. If that's negative, then proceed to imaging. But maybe in this case, she's not improving, so imaging can rule out other causes.

Alternatively, given that she's had no improvement, perhaps the infection is more severe, and imaging can show if there's a perforation or abscess. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the fact that she has a history of constipation for 12 years—could that lead to a fecal impaction causing colonic obstruction or ischemia? But her stool is normal, so that might not be the case. 

Another thought: could it be a urinary tract infection? She has a high BMI, which is a risk factor, but she has no urinary symptoms, and urinalysis is normal.

So, going back, the most likely next step is to test for C. diff. So the answer would be A. But wait, I'm not so sure. Because in the emergency setting, if she's not improving, sometimes imaging is done to rule out more serious issues. 

Alternatively, in some cases, a CT scan can also detect C. diff colitis, but the stool test is more specific. So maybe testing for C. diff is better first.

Wait, but in the case of a patient who isn't responding to antibiotics, imaging can show if there's a perforation or other complications that require surgical intervention. So perhaps the CT scan is more comprehensive.

But the question is about the most appropriate next step. Given all that, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the order of tests.

In a patient with suspected C. diff, you would test for it first. If that's negative, then look for other causes. So, in this case, A would be the next step.

But the patient's symptoms also could be from diverticulitis, which wouldn't be detected by a stool test. So maybe the CT is better because it can diagnose both C. diff and diverticulitis.

Wait, but C. diff is diagnosed via stool test, not imaging. So if C. diff is negative, then imaging would help. But if it's positive, you don't need imaging. So perhaps testing for C. diff is the first step.

Alternatively, if the stool test is negative, then proceed to imaging. So the next step is A.

But I'm still not 100% sure. Maybe the correct answer is D: CT scan, because it can evaluate for various causes, including diverticulitis, appendicitis, etc., which are more likely given her age and history.

Wait, she's 52, had a hysterectomy, but that doesn't preclude diverticulitis. So CT could show diverticulitis, which would explain her symptoms. 

But then why isn't the stool test the next step? Because if it's C. diff, that's a specific treatment. But if it's diverticulitis, it's treated with other antibiotics or surgery.

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating. The patient has been on amoxicillin and metronidazole, which are effective against many bacteria, including those causing diverticulitis. But she's not improving. Maybe it's a resistant infection or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial treatment is for a different cause, and the real issue is diverticulitis. In that case, imaging would be better.

Wait, but the symptoms started with cramps and fever, and she improved a bit on the antibiotics but not completely. So maybe it's diverticulitis with a complication like an abscess, which would require imaging to detect.

Alternatively, the initial thought is that she has a bacterial infection, but the antibiotics aren't working. So testing for C. diff would be the next step.

But I'm not 100% certain. I think I'll go with the stool test for C. diff, so option A.

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a 1-week history of low-grade fever and abdominal cramps that worsen with bowel movements. She has a history of hypertension and underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago. She has intermittently experienced constipation for 12 years and is currently on amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole, which have not alleviated her symptoms. Her examination reveals left lower quadrant tenderness, and her labs show leukocytosis. 

The differential diagnoses include diverticulitis, antibiotic-associated colitis (e.g., C. diff), or other infections. Testing for C. diff toxin (option A) is a quick and non-invasive next step, as it is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. If the test is positive, specific treatment can be initiated. If negative, imaging such as CT scan (option D) would be appropriate to rule out other causes like diverticulitis or appendicitis. Given the patient's lack of improvement on antibiotics and the suspicion of C. diff, the most appropriate next step is to test her stool for C. diff toxin.
