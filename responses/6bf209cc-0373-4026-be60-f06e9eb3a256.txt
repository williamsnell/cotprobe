Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 252 and 96. Hmm, the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. I remember there are a few methods to find this, like listing out all the factors, using prime factorization, or maybe the Euclidean algorithm. Let me think about which one would be the easiest.

First, maybe I'll try listing the factors. But wait, 252 is a pretty big number, so listing all its factors could take a while. Same with 96. Maybe prime factorization is better. Yeah, that's probably more efficient.

So, starting with 252. Let me break it down into prime factors. Dividing by 2 first: 252 ÷ 2 = 126. Then 126 ÷ 2 = 63. Now, 63 isn't divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. 63 ÷ 3 = 21, then 21 ÷ 3 = 7, and 7 is a prime. So the prime factors of 252 are 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7, or 2² × 3² × 7¹.

Next, let's do the same for 96. Starting with 2: 96 ÷ 2 = 48, ÷2 again is 24, then 12, then 6, then 3, which is prime. So the factors are 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3, which is 2⁵ × 3¹.

Now, the GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. So looking at both factorizations, the common primes are 2 and 3.

For 2, the lowest exponent is 2² (since 252 has 2² and 96 has 2⁵).
For 3, the lowest exponent is 3¹ (since 252 has 3² and 96 has 3¹).

Multiplying these together: 2² × 3¹ = 4 × 3 = 12. So the GCF should be 12.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should try the Euclidean algorithm too to confirm. The Euclidean algorithm is where you divide the larger number by the smaller, take the remainder, and repeat until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.

So, divide 252 by 96. 96 × 2 = 192, subtract that from 252: 252 - 192 = 60. So the remainder is 60.

Now, take 96 and divide by 60. 60 × 1 = 60, subtract that from 96: 96 - 60 = 36. The remainder is 36.

Next, take 60 and divide by 36. 36 × 1 = 36, subtract from 60: 60 - 36 = 24. Remainder is 24.

Then, take 36 and divide by 24. 24 × 1 = 24, subtract: 36 - 24 = 12. Remainder is 12.

Now, take 24 and divide by 12. 12 × 2 = 24, subtract: 24 - 24 = 0. So the remainder is 0, and the last non-zero remainder was 12. So that confirms it: the GCF is 12.

Looking back at the options, D is 12. So the answer should be D.
