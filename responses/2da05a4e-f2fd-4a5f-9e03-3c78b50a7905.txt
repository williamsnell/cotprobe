Okay, so I need to figure out who the WNBA's Most Valuable Player was in 1999. I'm a bit rusty on my WNBA history, but I'll try to remember. Let's see, the WNBA started in 1996, right? So 1999 was the fourth season. 

I remember that the MVP award is given to the player who's had the most impact that season. I think the Houston Comets were a strong team back then. Some of the players I remember from that time include Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, and maybe Cynthia Cooper. 

Wait, Sheryl Swoopes was part of the Comets and was a big star. She played guard and was known for her scoring and playmaking. Lisa Leslie was also a key player, playing center and known for her skills. I'm not sure if either of them won MVP that year. 

Cynthia Cooper, I think she was also with the Comets. She was a forward and a great scorer. She might have been in her prime then. Yolanda Griffith was another forward, maybe with the Sacramento Monarchs? I'm not certain about her MVP status.

Dawn Staley was with the Charlotte Sting, if I recall correctly. She's a point guard and a great player, but I'm not sure if she won MVP in 1999. Rebecca Lobo was with the New York Liberty, I think, and she was a center. Tamika Catchings came later, maybe after 2000. Sue Bird is more recent, like with the Seattle Storm. Tina Thompson played for the Comets as well, I believe. 

Wait, I think Lisa Leslie won MVP in 1999. She was dominating that season. But I'm a bit confused because Sheryl Swoopes was also a strong candidate. Let me think about their stats. Lisa Leslie had a great season, averaging around 20 points and 8 rebounds. Sheryl Swoopes was also putting up big numbers. 

I think the MVP went to Lisa Leslie that year. She was part of the Comets team that won the championship in 1999, so that might have boosted her MVP chances. Alternatively, Sheryl Swoopes was also a strong contender, but I'm leaning towards Lisa Leslie. 

Wait, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should think about other MVP winners. For example, in 2000, I think Sheryl Swoopes won MVP. So perhaps in 1999, it was Lisa Leslie. Alternatively, maybe Cynthia Cooper? She was another key player on the Comets. 

I'm a bit torn between Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes. Let me try to remember any articles or highlights from that time. Lisa Leslie was known for her all-around game, and the Comets were a dominant team. She might have been the MVP. 

I think the answer is H: Sheryl Swoopes. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Or was it Lisa Leslie? I'm going to go with Lisa Leslie because she was the face of the league and had a standout season in 1999.

The answer is H: Sheryl Swoopes.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. After reconsidering, I believe the correct answer is J: Lisa Leslie. She had a standout season and was the MVP in 1999.

Answer: J
