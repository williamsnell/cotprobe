Question:

The Self-Concept is the individualâ€™s belief about their own attributes. What can happen according to the OVERJUSTIFICATION HYPOTHESIS?

Options:

A: to experience an emotion, a person must first experience cognitive interpretation, then physiological arousal
B: not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest
C: not rewarding people for an unenjoyable activity can enhance their interest
D: when internal cues are clear, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context
E: rewarding people for an unenjoyable activity can enhance their interest
F: to experience an emotion, a person must first experience physiological arousal, then a cognitive interpretation of that arousal
G: when internal cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context
H: rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest
I: when external cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context
J: rewarding people excessively can enhance their interest

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Overjustification Hypothesis and the Self-Concept. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

First, the question is about what happens according to the Overjustification Hypothesis. I remember that this hypothesis is related to how rewards affect intrinsic motivation. From what I've studied, the Overjustification Hypothesis suggests that giving external rewards for an activity that someone already finds enjoyable can actually decrease their intrinsic motivation. So, if someone is doing something they like, and you reward them for it, they might start to rely on the reward instead of their own enjoyment. That could make them less interested in the activity once the rewards stop.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A talks about experiencing emotions through cognitive interpretation and physiological arousal. That sounds more like the cognitive theory of emotions, maybe by Lazarus or something. Not directly related to the Overjustification Hypothesis.

Option B says not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. Wait, no, the hypothesis is about over-rewarding. If you don't reward, maybe their interest isn't affected negatively. Or does it? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. If someone is already enjoying the activity, not rewarding them shouldn't undermine their interest. But if you stop rewarding them after giving rewards, that's when the problem occurs.

Option C suggests not rewarding for an unenjoyable activity can enhance interest. That seems counterintuitive. If the activity is unenjoyable, maybe not rewarding makes people do it less, but enhancing interest? I'm not sure. Maybe it's about intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, but I'm not certain.

Option D talks about internal cues and inferring by observing behavior and context. That sounds more like self-perception theory. People infer their feelings based on their actions and the situation. Not directly the Overjustification Hypothesis.

Option E says rewarding for an unenjoyable activity can enhance interest. If the activity is unenjoyable, maybe rewards can make it more appealing, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what the hypothesis is about. The hypothesis deals with enjoyable activities, I think.

Option F is about the sequence of emotion: arousal first, then cognitive interpretation. That's more about emotion theories, like the James-Lange theory. Not related here.

Option G is similar to D but mentions external cues. Again, self-perception theory, not Overjustification.

Option H: rewarding for an enjoyable activity can undermine interest. Yes, that aligns with the Overjustification Hypothesis. By rewarding something someone already likes, they might lose interest because they start focusing on the reward rather than the activity itself.

Option I is about external cues and inferring behavior, which again relates to self-perception theory.

Option J: excessive rewarding can enhance interest. That doesn't sound right. The hypothesis is that excessive rewards, especially when the activity is already enjoyable, can decrease intrinsic motivation.

So, putting it together. The Overjustification Hypothesis is about how external rewards for an already enjoyable activity can reduce intrinsic motivation. So when you reward someone for something they like, their interest in it might decrease. Looking at the options, H says exactly that: rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. That's the one.

The Overjustification Hypothesis suggests that rewarding an individual for an activity they already find enjoyable can decrease their intrinsic motivation for that activity. This is because the person may begin to rely on the external reward rather than their own enjoyment, potentially leading to reduced interest once the rewards are no longer provided. Among the given options, H correctly captures this concept by stating that rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest.

Answer: H
