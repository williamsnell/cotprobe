Okay, so I've got this question about machine learning problems and the number of possible examples. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll work through it carefully.

The question says there's a machine learning problem with four attributes and a class. Each attribute has a certain number of possible values, and the class also has some. I need to find the maximum number of different examples possible.

Alright, so the attributes are four in total. Let me list them out as per the question:

- Attribute 1: 3 possible values
- Attribute 2: 2 possible values
- Attribute 3: 2 possible values
- Attribute 4: 2 possible values

And the class has 3 possible values. Wait, but the question is about the maximum number of different examples. So I think each example is a combination of the values of the four attributes plus the class value. Hmm, but wait, sometimes in machine learning, the class is the target, but for counting all possible examples, including the class, we might multiply by the number of class possibilities. Or maybe not? Because each example is a specific instance, including its class label.

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of possible different examples. So each example is a tuple of (A1, A2, A3, A4, Class). So each attribute contributes to the number of possible combinations.

So, the number of possible examples would be the product of the number of possible values for each attribute and the class.

Wait, but the class is part of the example. So for each combination of the four attributes, there are 3 possible class values. So the total number would be (3 * 2 * 2 * 2) * 3.

Wait, let me calculate that. 3 * 2 is 6, times 2 is 12, times 2 is 24. Then multiply by 3 (the class possibilities) gives 24 *3=72.

Looking at the options: E is 216, which is 3^3*2^3? Wait, no, 3*2*2*2=24, times 3 is 72, which is option G.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Sometimes, in some contexts, the class isn't considered as part of the example's attributes but as the target variable. But the question says the problem involves four attributes plus a class, so the class is part of the example.

Alternatively, maybe the class is not part of the attributes, but the example includes it. So each example is a combination of all four attributes plus the class, so the total possibilities would be the product of all attribute possibilities times the class possibilities.

So, yes, it's (3 * 2 * 2 * 2) * 3 = 24 *3=72. So the answer would be G:72.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think: each attribute contributes its possible values, and each class can be any of its options regardless of the attributes. So for each possible combination of attributes (which is 3*2*2*2=24), there are 3 possible class values. So 24 *3=72. That makes sense.

So the options are A:36, B:144, C:60, D:24, E:216, F:12, G:72, H:48, I:108, J:96.

So the correct answer is G:72.

The maximum number of different examples is calculated by multiplying the possible values of each attribute together and then multiplying by the number of class values. 

(3 * 2 * 2 * 2) * 3 = 24 * 3 = 72.

Answer: G
