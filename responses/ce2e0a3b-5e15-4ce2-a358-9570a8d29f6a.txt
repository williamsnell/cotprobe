Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist has a certain amount of gas under a pressure of 33.3 atm, and it occupies 30 liters at 273°C. The chemist needs the gas to be at standard conditions for his research. The question is, what will the volume be under standard conditions?

Hmm, okay. I remember that standard conditions in chemistry usually refer to standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C (which is 273.15 K) and 1 atm pressure. So the problem is asking for the volume when the gas is adjusted to these conditions.

I think I should use the combined gas law here. The combined gas law relates pressure, volume, and temperature for a given amount of gas. The formula is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2, where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the initial and final states of the gas.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Initial pressure, P1 = 33.3 atm
- Initial volume, V1 = 30 L
- Initial temperature, T1 = 273°C. Wait, but I need to convert that to Kelvin because gas laws use absolute temperature. So 273°C is 273 + 273.15? No, wait, no. Wait, no, 0°C is 273.15 K, so 273°C would be 273 + 273.15? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273.15. So 0°C is 273.15 K. Therefore, 273°C would be 273 + 273.15 = 546.15 K, approximately 546 K.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, 273°C is actually 273 + 273.15? No, that would be 546.15 K. But wait, wait, no, that seems high. Let me check. Oh wait, no, no, no. Wait, no. 0°C is 273.15 K. So 100°C is 373.15 K. So 273°C would be 273 + 273.15 = 546.15 K. Yeah, that makes sense. So T1 is 546.15 K.

Under standard conditions, the pressure P2 is 1 atm, and the temperature T2 is 273 K (since 0°C is standard). We're looking for V2.

So using the combined gas law: P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2.

Plugging in the numbers:

(33.3 atm * 30 L) / 546.15 K = (1 atm * V2) / 273 K.

Let me compute the left side first.

33.3 * 30 = 999. So 999 / 546.15 ≈ let's see. Let me calculate that. 546.15 times 1.8 is 983.07, which is close to 999. So 1.82 times 546.15 is 999. So approximately 1.82.

So the left side is approximately 1.82.

So 1.82 = (1 atm * V2) / 273 K.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The equation is (33.3 * 30) / 546.15 = (1 * V2) / 273.

So (999) / 546.15 = V2 / 273.

So 999 divided by 546.15 is approximately 1.826.

So 1.826 = V2 / 273.

Then, V2 = 1.826 * 273.

Let me calculate that. 1 * 273 is 273. 0.826 * 273: 0.8 * 273 = 218.4, 0.026 *273=7.098, so total 218.4 +7.098 =225.498. So total V2 is 273 + 225.498 ≈ 498.498 L. Approximately 498.5 L.

Looking at the options, option B is 499.5 L, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I approximated too much.

Let me compute 33.3 *30 = 999 exactly. Then 999 / 546.15: let's compute it more accurately.

546.15 * 1.82 = let's see. 546.15 *1.8=983.07, 546.15 *0.02=10.923, so 983.07+10.923=994. So 1.82 gives 994, which is a bit less than 999. So 1.82 + (5/546.15) to get to 999.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 999 / 546.15 exactly.

999 ÷ 546.15. Let's do this division.

546.15 * 1.8 = 983.07, as before. 999 -983.07=15.93. So 15.93 /546.15 ≈ 0.02916. So total is approximately 1.82916.

So 1.82916 = V2 / 273.

So V2=1.82916 *273.

Let me compute 1.82916 *273.

1.82916 * 200 = 365.832

1.82916 *70 = 128.0412

1.82916 *3 =5.48748

Adding them together: 365.832 +128.0412=493.8732 +5.48748=499.36068 L.

So approximately 499.36 L. That's very close to option B, which is 499.5 L. So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves using the combined gas law to find the volume of a gas under standard conditions (1 atm, 273 K). Given the initial conditions (33.3 atm, 30 L, 273°C), we convert the temperature to Kelvin (546.15 K) and apply the formula \( \frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2} \). Solving for \( V_2 \) yields approximately 499.36 L, which rounds to 499.5 L.
