Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Describe each of the following situations in terms of de-mand elasticity. a) You have a cold and the only medicine that can help you used to cost $1.50 per bottle but now costs $20.00 a bottle. You buy it anyway. b) At $80 per ticket you would buy 2 tickets, but scalpers want $100 a seat for the Stanley cup finals, so you stay at home and watch the games on television. c) Chocolate bars double in price overnight from 10$ to 20C, yet you buy the same number as before.

Options:

A: a) Elastic demand, b) Inelastic demand, c) Elastic demand
B: a) Elastic demand, b) Elastic demand, c) Inelastic demand
C: a) Inelastic demand, b) Elastic demand, c) Inelastic demand
D: a) Inelastic demand, b) Inelastic demand, c) Elastic demand

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about demand elasticity, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by recalling what demand elasticity means. Elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. If demand is elastic, a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. If it's inelastic, the quantity demanded doesn't change much with price changes.

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. I need to determine the elasticity for each situation and then match them to the options A to D provided.

Starting with part a: You have a cold, and the only medicine used to cost $1.50 but now costs $20. You buy it anyway. So, the price went up a lot, but you still bought it. This suggests that the quantity demanded didn't decrease much despite the price increase. So, this would be inelastic demand because the change in price didn't lead to a significant change in quantity demanded.

Moving to part b: At $80, you'd buy 2 tickets, but scalpers are asking $100, so you stay home and watch TV. Here, the price increased from $80 to $100, which is a 25% increase. Your response was to not buy any tickets, so the quantity demanded dropped from 2 to 0. That's a huge change in quantity for a relatively small price change. This indicates elastic demand because the quantity demanded is very responsive to the price change.

For part c: Chocolate bars doubled in price from $10 to $20, but you buy the same number. The price change is 100%, but the quantity bought didn't change. This is a clear case of inelastic demand because the quantity demanded is unaffected by the price change.

Now, putting it all together:

a) Inelastic
b) Elastic
c) Inelastic

Looking at the options:

A: a) Elastic, b) Inelastic, c) Elastic → No, because a is inelastic.

B: a) Elastic, b) Elastic, c) Inelastic → No, a is inelastic.

C: a) Inelastic, b) Elastic, c) Inelastic → Yes, this matches.

D: a) Inelastic, b) Inelastic, c) Elastic → No, b is elastic.

So the correct option is C.

The correct answer is C: a) Inelastic demand, b) Elastic demand, c) Inelastic demand.
