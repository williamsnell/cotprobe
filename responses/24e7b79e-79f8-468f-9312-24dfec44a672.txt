Alright, so I need to figure out how much Lucy charges for her psychiatric advice in Peanuts. I'm not too familiar with all the details, but I remember some key points from the show. Lucy is known for setting up her psychiatric stand in the park, right? She has this little booth, and she gives advice to Charlie Brown and others. 

I think she charges a specific amount for her services. I'm trying to recall if it's a common amount or something more symbolic. I remember that in the show, money was often a theme, and Lucy's收费 might be a running gag. Maybe it's a low amount because she's not a professional, or perhaps it's just a funny number.

Wait, I think it's either 5 cents or 10 cents. Let me think. When Charlie Brown goes to Lucy, he pays her, and I believe it's a very small amount. Maybe it's 5 cents because that's a nickel, which is a term sometimes used. Or perhaps 10 cents, like a dime. I'm not sure which one it is exactly.

I also recall that in some episodes, the cost might have changed, but I think the most common answer is 5 cents. Alternatively, maybe it's 10 cents. I'm trying to visualize the scenes where Charlie Brown gives her the money. He might pull out a nickel, which is 5 cents. Yeah, that sounds right. So Lucy charges 5 cents for her advice.
