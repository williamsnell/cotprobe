Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the refractive index of glass when light is reflected and polarized. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know about optics and polarization.

The question says that light from the green mercury line, which is 5461 Å, is plane-polarized when reflected at an angle of 57 degrees 47 minutes. I think this has to do with Brewster's angle because Brewster's angle is the angle at which light reflects off a surface with a higher refractive index and becomes completely polarized. Oh right, Brewster's angle is when the reflected light is entirely polarized in the plane of incidence, which is the plane formed by the incoming light and the normal to the surface.

So, Brewster's angle formula is tan(theta) = n2 / n1, where n2 is the refractive index of the second medium and n1 is the first. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the light is going from air into glass, so n1 is air (which is approximately 1) and n2 is the glass. So the formula should be tan(theta) = n_glass / n_air, which simplifies to tan(theta) = n_glass.

Wait, so if theta is the Brewster's angle, then n = tan(theta). But wait, the angle given is 57 degrees 47 minutes. I need to convert that into decimal degrees. Let me calculate that. 47 minutes is 47/60 degrees. 47 divided by 60 is approximately 0.7833 degrees. So the angle is 57.7833 degrees.

Now, I need to find the tangent of that angle. Let me get my calculator. Wait, I don't have a calculator here, but maybe I can approximate it. I know that tan(45) is 1, tan(60) is about 1.732. So 57.78 is between 45 and 60, closer to 60. So tan(57.78) should be a bit less than 1.732 but more than 1.5. Wait, wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator if I'm allowed. But since I'm just thinking, I'll proceed.

Wait, I think I remember that tan(57.78°) is approximately 1.55. Wait, but let me check: I can compute it as follows. Using the calculator function, but since I can't actually do that right now, I'll have to rely on my memory. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of known angles. For example, tan(57 degrees) is around 1.5399, and tan(58 degrees) is about 1.6003. So 57.78 is closer to 58, so maybe around 1.60. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator function, but since I don't have that, I'll proceed with an approximate value.

Wait, the problem is asking for the refractive index of the glass. So n_glass is tan(theta), where theta is Brewster's angle. So if theta is 57.78 degrees, then n_glass is tan(57.78) ≈ let's say 1.55. Wait, but looking at the options, I see options around 1.5 to 1.7.

Wait, the options are:

A: 1.6421
B: 1.5461
C: 1.5000
D: 1.5307
E: 1.5747
F: 1.6234
G: 1.5600
H: 1.6057
I: 1.6789
J: 1.5869

Wait, so if tan(theta) is about 1.55, then the closest option would be B: 1.5461 or G:1.5600. But perhaps I'm miscalculating the angle. Let me double-check the angle conversion.

Wait, 57 degrees 47 minutes. 47 minutes is 47/60 = 0.783333... So total angle is 57.7833 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Wait, Brewster's angle is when the reflected light is completely polarized. So the formula is tan(theta) = n2/n1. Here, n1 is air (1), so tan(theta) = n2. So n2 is tan(theta). So n_glass = tan(57.7833).

Wait, maybe I can calculate this more accurately. Let me think in terms of known angles. Let's say I know that tan(57 degrees) is approximately 1.5399. Then, each degree adds about 0.02 to the tan value. So 57 degrees is 1.5399, 58 degrees is 1.6003, so per minute, the increase is (1.6003 - 1.5399) = 0.0604 per degree. So 47 minutes is 0.7833 degrees. So the increase would be approximately 0.7833 * 0.0604 ≈ 0.0473. So tan(57.7833) ≈ 1.5399 + 0.0473 ≈ 1.5872.

Wait, that's about 1.5872. Looking at the options, J is 1.5869, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is J:1.5869.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Because the increase per degree is about 0.0604, so per minute, that's 0.0604 / 60 ≈ 0.0010067 per minute. So 47 minutes would add 47 * 0.0010067 ≈ 0.04735. So 57 degrees is 1.5399, so 57 degrees and 47 minutes would be 1.5399 + 0.04735 ≈ 1.58725. So the refractive index would be approximately 1.587, which is very close to option J:1.5869.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1.5747, which is a bit lower. Option J is 1.5869. So perhaps that's the correct one.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator to get a more precise value. Let me try to compute tan(57.7833 degrees).

Using a calculator: 57.7833 degrees.

tan(57) = 1.539905

tan(57.5) = let's see, maybe around 1.5602 (I think I've seen that before).

Wait, actually, maybe I should use a calculator function. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that tan(60 degrees) is about 1.732. So 57.78 is closer to 58, which as I said earlier is about 1.6003. But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as 57 + 47/60 = 57.7833 degrees.

Using a calculator, tan(57.7833) is approximately 1.587. So the refractive index n would be about 1.587, which matches option J:1.5869.

Wait, but another thought: the light is green mercury line, 5461 Å. Does that affect the refractive index? I think the refractive index depends on the wavelength, but for this problem, perhaps we're to assume that the refractive index is given for that specific wavelength. But the problem doesn't ask us to calculate it based on wavelength, so maybe we can ignore that detail, as it's just providing the color or wavelength for context.

So, putting it all together, the refractive index is approximately 1.587, which matches option J:1.5869.

The problem involves determining the refractive index of glass when light is plane-polarized upon reflection at an angle of 57° 47'. This scenario corresponds to Brewster's angle, where the tangent of the angle equals the refractive index of the glass relative to air (n_glass = tan(theta)).

First, convert the angle to decimal degrees:  
57° 47' = 57 + (47/60) ≈ 57.7833°.

Using the tangent function:  
tan(57.7833°) ≈ 1.587.

Comparing this value to the provided options, the closest match is **J: 1.5869**.
