Okay, so I've got this question about the OSI model and brute-force attacks on access credentials. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

First, I remember that the OSI model has seven layers, each handling different aspects of networking. The layers from bottom to top are: Physical, Data-Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

The question is about failed sessions allowing brute-force attacks on access credentials. Wait, brute-force attacks are usually attempts to guess user IDs and passwords, right? So that's related to authentication. 

In the OSI model, authentication typically happens at the Application layer because that's where the application-level protocols (like HTTP, FTP) operate, and they handle user logins. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard that authentication can also occur at the Presentation layer, which deals with data translation and encryption. Oh, but Presentation layer is more about data formatting and security like encryption, not the actual authentication process itself.

Wait, the question mentions "failed sessions." Sessions are managed at the Session layer, right? The Session layer is responsible for setting up, managing, and tearing down connections between applications. So if a session is failed, maybe it's because of too many failed attempts, which could be part of a brute-force attack.

But wait, the attack itself is about trying to access credentials, which is more about authentication. So maybe the attack occurs at the Application layer because that's where the application handles user logins and authentication. Or perhaps it's the Session layer because that's where the session is being managed and possibly attacked.

Alternatively, brute-force attacks on network devices or services might target the Transport layer, but I'm not sure. Wait, the Transport layer handles end-to-end communication, like TCP and UDP. Maybe if the attack is on the transport protocols, but I think brute-force attacks on credentials are more about the application layer.

Wait, let me clarify. Brute-force attacks on access credentials would involve multiple failed login attempts. These attempts are typically made against the application layer because that's where the login process is handled. For example, when you try to log in to a website, that's the application layer. So the brute-force attack would be happening at the Application layer, but the failed sessions are part of the Session layer's management.

But wait, the question is asking in which layer these attacks are done. So the actual attack is being performed on the Application layer because that's where the authentication occurs. Alternatively, the attack could be targeting the Session layer because that's where the session is being established, and each failed attempt is a failed session.

I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The OSI model layers: Application is top, Presentation, then Session, then Transport, etc. So when a user tries to log in, the authentication process is at the Application layer. So brute-force attacks would be happening at the Application layer. However, each failed attempt would be a failed session, which is managed by the Session layer. So the attack affects the Session layer because each incorrect attempt is a failed session.

Wait, but the question is about where the attacks are done. So the attacks themselves are on the credentials, which are part of the application's authentication processâ€”so Application layer. But the failed sessions are part of the Session layer's handling. So maybe the attacks are done at the Session layer because each failed attempt is a failed session.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up some notes. Oh right, in the OSI model, the Session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions. So if an attacker is trying multiple times to log in, each incorrect attempt is a failed session. Therefore, the brute-force attack is targeting the Session layer because that's where the sessions are being handled.

Wait, but I've also read that brute-force attacks are more about the Application layer because that's where the authentication mechanism resides. For example, HTTP Basic Auth is part of the application layer. So maybe the attack is done at the Application layer, but the failed sessions are at the Session layer.

The question says, "this type of attacks are done in which layer." So the attack is being performed on the layer where the sessions are failing. So the attack is on the Session layer because each failed attempt is a failed session.

Alternatively, maybe the attack is on the application layer because that's where the application's authentication is happening, but the failed sessions are part of the session layer's process.

I think the answer is the Session layer because brute-force attacks on sessions would involve multiple failed session attempts, which is handled by the Session layer. So the attacks are done at the Session layer (J).
</think>

The question asks about the layer in the OSI model where brute-force attacks on access credentials, specifically involving failed sessions, are conducted. Brute-force attacks typically involve multiple failed login attempts, which are part of the authentication process. While authentication can occur at the Application layer, the focus here is on failed sessions, which are managed by the Session layer. The Session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating connections, and each failed login attempt results in a failed session. Therefore, the attacks are done at the Session layer.
