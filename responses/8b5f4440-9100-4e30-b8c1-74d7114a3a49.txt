Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about cats and their coat colors. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says that the coat color gene is sex-linked, which I remember means it's located on the X chromosome rather than the autosomes. The genes are B, which produces a yellow coat, and b, which produces a black coat. When the cat is heterozygous (Bb), it has a tortoiseshell coat. 

The parents in this scenario are a black male and a tortoiseshell female. I need to figure out what their offspring will look like.

First, let's break down the parents' genotypes. The father is a black male. Since males have XY chromosomes, their X carries the gene. So for a black coat, his genotype must be B? Wait, wait. Wait, B is yellow, b is black. So the father is black, so his gene should be b. But since he's male, he has only one X chromosome, right? So his genotype is B is yellow, but he's black, so wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, B is yellow, b is black. So if the father is black, his X must carry the b allele. So his genotype would be XbY. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait, for the Y chromosome, it doesn't carry this gene, so the father's Y doesn't contribute. So the father's X must have the b gene because he's black. So his genotype is XbY.

The mother is a tortoiseshell female. Females have two X chromosomes. Since she's tortoiseshell, that means she's Bb. So her genotype is XBXb. Because she has one B and one b.

Now, let's figure out the possible gametes each parent can produce.

The father, XbY, can produce two types of gametes: Xb and Y. Because during meiosis, the X and Y separate, so each gamete gets either Xb or Y.

The mother, XBXb, can produce two types of gametes as well: X^B and X^b. Because she has one X with B and one with b.

Now, let's cross these to see the possible offspring.

The father's gametes: Xb (50%) and Y (50%).

The mother's gametes: X^B (50%) and X^b (50%).

So when we combine them:

1. Xb (father) + X^B (mother) → X^B Xb → female. Since she has B and b, she'll be tortoiseshell.
2. Xb (father) + X^b (mother) → Xb Xb → female. Both X's have b, so she'll be black.
3. Y (father) + X^B (mother) → Y X^B → male. So his X has B, so his coat is yellow.
4. Y (father) + X^b (mother) → Y X^b → male. His X has b, so coat is black.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities.

For daughters: from father's Xb and mother's X^B or X^b.

Daughters will get X from father and X from mother.

So possible daughter combinations:

- Xb (father) + X^B (mother): 50% Xb from father * 50% X^B from mother = 25% (X^B Xb) → tortoise.
- Xb (father) + X^b (mother): 50% Xb * 50% X^b = 25% (Xb Xb) → black.

So daughters are 50% tortoise and 50% black.

For sons: they get Y from father and X from mother.

Possible son combinations:

- Y (father) + X^B (mother): 50% Y * 50% X^B = 25% → X^B Y → yellow.
- Y + X^b: 50% Y * 50% X^b = 25% → X^b Y → black.

So sons are 50% yellow and 50% black.

Wait, but wait a second. If the father is XbY, then his gametes are Xb and Y. So when he contributes Xb, the daughter gets that X. When he contributes Y, the son gets that Y.

So putting it all together:

The possible offspring:

- 25% X^B Xb (tortoise female)
- 25% Xb Xb (black female)
- 25% X^B Y (yellow male)
- 25% X^b Y (black male)

So the breakdown would be:

Females: 50% tortoise, 50% black.

Males: 50% yellow, 50% black.

Now, looking at the options:

Option J says (1/2) tortoiseshell females and (1/2) black males. Wait no, that's 50% each, but in our case, the females are 50% tortoise and 50% black, and the males are 50% yellow and 50% black. So the overall breakdown is:

- 25% tortoise females
- 25% black females
- 25% yellow males
- 25% black males

Which would be, in terms of all offspring, each makes up 25% of the total.

Looking at the options, option J is (1/2) tortoise-shell females and (1/2) black males. That doesn't match because we have 25% each for tortoise females, black females, yellow males, and black males.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, the possible offspring are:

- 25% tortoise (female)
- 25% black (female)
- 25% yellow (male)
- 25% black (male)

So the options don't seem to directly match this. Let me look at the options again.

Option J: (1/2) tortoiseshell females and (1/2) black males. That would be 50% each, which is not the case. So that's not correct.

Option D: (1/2) black females and (1/2) yellow males. That would be 50% black females and 50% yellow males. But in reality, we have 50% females (25% each) and 50% males (25% each). So D doesn't fit.

Looking for an option that matches 25% tortoise females, 25% black females, 25% yellow males, 25% black males. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option A: (1/4) tortoise females, (1/4) black females, (1/4) yellow males, and (1/4) black males. That's exactly what we have. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is (1/2) tortoise females and (1/2) black males. That's incorrect. Option A matches the 25% each.

Wait, but the options given are A through J, and option A is indeed (1/4) of each. So the correct answer should be option A.

The question involves a sex-linked coat color gene in cats, where B produces yellow, b produces black, and Bb results in tortoiseshell. The parents are a black male (XbY) and a tortoiseshell female (XBXb). 

To determine the offspring, we analyze the possible gametes:

- The male can produce Xb (50%) or Y (50%).
- The female can produce X^B (50%) or X^b (50%).

Combining these gametes:

1. **Xb (father) + X^B (mother)** → X^B Xb (tortoiseshell female, 25%).
2. **Xb (father) + X^b (mother)** → Xb Xb (black female, 25%).
3. **Y (father) + X^B (mother)** → X^B Y (yellow male, 25%).
4. **Y (father) + X^b (mother)** → X^b Y (black male, 25%).

Thus, the offspring are equally divided into four categories: 25% tortoiseshell females, 25% black females, 25% yellow males, and 25% black males. 

The correct option is **A**, which matches this distribution.
