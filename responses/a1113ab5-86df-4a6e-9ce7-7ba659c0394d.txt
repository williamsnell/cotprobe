Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Mean Value Theorem for the function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x on the interval [0, π]. I'm a bit rusty on calculus, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if a function is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) where the derivative f'(c) equals the average rate of change of the function over [a, b]. So, the question is asking how many such points c exist on [0, π].

Wait, no, actually, the MVT says at least one point. But the question here isn't just about whether the MVT applies, but how many points satisfy the condition. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is about how many points c in (0, π) satisfy f'(c) equal to (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a). Or maybe it's asking about the number of critical points where the derivative is zero, but that's Rolle's Theorem, which is a special case of MVT. Wait, no, the MVT is about the derivative equaling the average rate, not necessarily zero. So, the question is about how many times the derivative equals that average rate.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The MVT says that there exists at least one c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a). So, the question is, for f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x on [0, π], how many such c's are there? So, I need to find the number of solutions to f'(c) = (f(π) - f(0))/π.

First, I should check if f(x) meets the conditions for MVT on [0, π]. Since sine functions are smooth everywhere, f(x) is continuous on [0, π] and differentiable on (0, π), so MVT applies. Therefore, there's at least one such c. But the question is how many.

So, let me compute f(0) and f(π) first.

f(0) = 2 sin 0 + sin 0 = 0 + 0 = 0.

f(π) = 2 sin π + sin 4π. Sin π is 0, and sin 4π is 0, so f(π) = 0.

Therefore, the average rate of change is (0 - 0)/π = 0. So, we're looking for points c in (0, π) where f'(c) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the function f(x) starts and ends at zero on [0, π], so the average rate is zero, and we need to find how many times the derivative equals zero in that interval.

Wait, but that's the same as finding the critical points of f(x) in (0, π), which would be points where f'(x) = 0. So, the number of such points would be the number of times the function has a horizontal tangent in that interval.

So, first, let me compute f'(x).

f'(x) = derivative of 2 sin x is 2 cos x, and derivative of sin 4x is 4 cos 4x. So,

f'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x.

We need to find the number of solutions to 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0 in the interval (0, π).

Hmm, that's the equation to solve: 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0.

I can simplify this equation. Let's factor out a 2:

2 [cos x + 2 cos 4x] = 0 => cos x + 2 cos 4x = 0.

So, cos x = -2 cos 4x.

Now, perhaps I can express cos 4x in terms of cos x using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that cos 4x can be written in terms of cos 2x, and then cos 2x in terms of cos x.

We know that cos 4x = 2 cos² 2x - 1.

And cos 2x = 2 cos² x - 1. So,

cos 4x = 2 (2 cos² x - 1)^2 - 1.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try expanding it.

Let me compute 2 cos² x - 1 first: let's denote y = cos x. Then cos 2x = 2y² - 1.

Then cos 4x = 2 (2y² - 1)^2 - 1.

Expanding (2y² - 1)^2: 4y⁴ -4y² +1.

So, 2*(4y⁴ -4y² +1) = 8y⁴ -8y² + 2.

Then subtract 1: 8y⁴ -8y² +2 -1 = 8y⁴ -8y² +1.

So, cos 4x = 8y⁴ -8y² +1, where y = cos x.

So, substituting back into the equation cos x = -2 cos 4x:

y = -2*(8y⁴ -8y² +1) = -16y⁴ +16y² -2.

Bring all terms to one side:

16y⁴ -16y² +2 + y = 0.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, cos x = -2 cos 4x.

So, y = -2*(8y⁴ -8y² +1) → y = -16y⁴ +16y² -2.

Then, moving all terms to left:

16y⁴ -16y² +2 + y = 0 → 16y⁴ -16y² + y + 2 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quartic equation in y, which might be complex to solve. Perhaps there's a better approach.

Alternatively, maybe using multiple-angle identities to express everything in terms of cos x. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write cos 4x in terms of cos x using the identity cos 4x = 8 cos^4 x -8 cos² x +1, as I did before.

So, the equation is cos x + 2 cos 4x = 0.

Plugging in cos 4x:

cos x + 2*(8 cos^4 x -8 cos² x +1) = 0.

So, cos x + 16 cos^4 x -16 cos² x +2 = 0.

Let me rearrange terms:

16 cos^4 x -16 cos² x + cos x + 2 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quartic equation in cos x. Let me let y = cos x, so equation becomes:

16y^4 -16y^2 + y + 2 = 0.

That's a quartic equation, which might be challenging to solve directly. Maybe I can factor it.

Alternatively, perhaps trying to factor by grouping. Let me check if it factors.

16y^4 -16y^2 + y + 2.

Let me try grouping terms:

(16y^4 -16y^2) + (y + 2) = 0.

Factor out 16y^2 from first two terms: 16y^2(y^2 -1) + (y + 2) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps trying to factor into quadratics.

Assume it factors as (ay² + by + c)(dy² + ey + f) = 0.

Multiplying out: ad y^4 + (ae + bd) y^3 + (af + be + cd) y^2 + (bf + ce) y + cf = 0.

Comparing with 16y^4 -16y^2 + y + 2.

So,

ad = 16 → possible a=4, d=4; a=8, d=2; etc.

Let's try a=4, d=4.

Then,

ae + bd = 4e +4b = coefficient of y^3, which is 0. So, 4e +4b =0 → e = -b.

Next term: af + be + cd = 4f + b e +4c. Since e = -b, this becomes 4f + b*(-b) +4c = 4f -b² +4c. And this should equal the coefficient of y², which is -16.

So, 4f -b² +4c = -16.

Next, the coefficient of y is (bf + ce) = b f + c e. Since e = -b, this becomes b f + c*(-b) = b(f - c).

This should equal the coefficient of y, which is 1.

So, b(f - c) = 1.

Finally, the constant term: cf = 2.

We need to find integers b, c, f that satisfy these conditions.

Let's list possible factors of 2 for c and f.

Possible pairs (c, f) are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1).

Let's try c=2, f=1.

Then, cf=2*1=2, which is correct.

Now, from b(f - c) =1 → b(1-2)=1 → b*(-1)=1 → b= -1.

So, b=-1.

Now, check the y² term equation: 4f -b² +4c = 4*1 - (-1)^2 +4*2 =4 -1 +8=11. But that should be -16. So that doesn't work.

Next, try c=1, f=2.

Then, b(f -c)=b(2-1)=b=1.

So, b=1.

Now, check y² term: 4f -b² +4c =4*2 -1 +4*1=8-1+4=11. Again, not -16.

Next, try c=-1, f=-2.

Then, cf= (-1)(-2)=2.

b(f -c)=b(-2 - (-1))=b*(-1)=1 → b= -1.

Now, y² term:4*(-2) - (-1)^2 +4*(-1)= -8 -1 -4= -13. Not -16.

Next, c=-2, f=-1.

Then, cf= (-2)(-1)=2.

b(f - c)=b*(-1 - (-2))=b*(1)=1 → b=1.

Now, y² term:4*(-1) -1^2 +4*(-2)= -4 -1 -8= -13. Still not -16.

Hmm, none of these worked. Maybe a different a and d.

Let me try a=8, d=2.

Then,

ad=8*2=16.

ae + bd =8e +2b=0 → 8e +2b=0 → 4e + b =0 → e= -b/4.

Hmm, but b must be an integer, so perhaps b is a multiple of 4. Let's try b=4, then e= -1.

Next, the coefficient of y²: af + be + cd =8f +4*(-1) +2c=8f -4 +2c. This should equal -16.

So, 8f +2c = -12 → 4f +c =-6.

The coefficient of y is (bf + ce)=4f + c*(-1)=4f -c.

This should equal 1.

So,

4f - c =1.

And from earlier, 4f + c =-6.

Now, we have a system:

4f + c = -6

4f - c =1.

Adding both equations: 8f = -5 → f= -5/8. Hmm, not integer. Not sure if acceptable, but maybe possible. Let's see.

But then, the constant term is c*f.

Wait, constant term is c*f, which should be 2.

But if f= -5/8, then c=?

From 4f +c = -6 → 4*(-5/8) +c = -6 → (-20/8) +c = -6 → (-5/2) +c = -6 → c= -6 +5/2= (-12/2 +5/2)= (-7/2).

So, c= -7/2, f= -5/8.

Then, c*f = (-7/2)*(-5/8)=35/16≈2.1875, which is not equal to 2. So, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps a=2, d=8.

Then, ae + bd =2e +8b=0 → 2e +8b=0 → e = -4b.

Next, coefficient of y²: af + be + cd=2f +b*(-4b) +8c=2f -4b² +8c. This equals -16.

Coefficient of y: b f +c e= b f +c*(-4b)=b(f -4c)=1.

Constant term: c f=2.

So, let's set up the equations:

1. 2f -4b² +8c = -16

2. b(f -4c) =1

3. c f=2.

We need to find integers b, c, f that satisfy these.

From equation 3, possible pairs (c, f) are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1).

Let's try c=1, f=2.

Then equation 2: b(2 -4*1)=b*(-2)=1 → b= -1/2. Not integer.

Next, c=2, f=1.

Equation 2: b(1 -8)=b*(-7)=1 → b= -1/7. Not integer.

Next, c=-1, f=-2.

Equation 2: b(-2 - (-4))=b*(2)=1 → b=1/2. Not integer.

Next, c=-2, f=-1.

Equation 2: b(-1 - (-8))=b*(7)=1 → b=1/7. Not integer.

Hmm, none of these work. Maybe a=16, d=1.

Then, ae + bd=16e +1*b=0 → 16e +b=0 → e= -b/16.

This would require b being a multiple of 16, which seems messy, so perhaps not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic doesn't factor nicely, so another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe using substitution. Let me think: Let’s denote t = x. So, the equation is 2 cos t + 4 cos 4t =0.

Alternatively, perhaps express cos 4t in terms of cos t. As we did earlier, cos 4t = 8 cos^4 t -8 cos^2 t +1.

So, equation becomes 2 cos t +4*(8 cos^4 t -8 cos² t +1) =0.

Which simplifies to 2 cos t +32 cos^4 t -32 cos² t +4 =0.

Divide both sides by 2: cos t +16 cos^4 t -16 cos² t +2=0.

Let me rearrange: 16 cos^4 t -16 cos² t + cos t +2=0.

Let y=cos t. Then equation becomes 16y^4 -16y^2 + y +2=0.

Hmm, same quartic as before. Maybe I can try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 2 over factors of 16, so ±1, ±2, ±1/2, etc.

Let me test y=1: 16(1)^4 -16(1)^2 +1 +2=16-16+1+2=3≠0.

y=-1: 16(-1)^4 -16(-1)^2 + (-1) +2=16-16-1+2=1≠0.

y=2: 16(16) -16(4) +2 +2=256-64+4=196≠0.

y=1/2: 16*(1/16) -16*(1/4) +1/2 +2=1 -4 +0.5 +2= (-1.5)≠0.

y=-1/2: 16*(1/16) -16*(1/4) + (-1/2) +2=1 -4 -0.5 +2= (-1.5)≠0.

y= -2: 16*(16) -16*(4) + (-2) +2=256-64-2+2=194≠0.

So, no rational roots. That suggests that the quartic might not factor nicely, so perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe graphing the function f'(x) = 2 cos x +4 cos4x and seeing how many times it crosses zero in (0, π). Since f'(x) is a continuous function, the number of zeros would correspond to the number of times it crosses the x-axis.

Alternatively, perhaps analyzing the behavior of f'(x) on [0, π].

Let me compute f'(0) and f'(π):

f'(0) = 2 cos 0 +4 cos 0 = 2*1 +4*1=6.

f'(π)=2 cos π +4 cos 4π=2*(-1)+4*(1)= -2+4=2.

So, f'(0)=6 and f'(π)=2, which are both positive. So, at x=0 and x=π, the derivative is positive.

Wait, but the function f(x) starts and ends at zero, but the derivative is positive at both ends. Hmm. So, perhaps the function is increasing at both ends.

But wait, maybe in between, the derivative dips below zero, creating some maxima and minima.

Let me compute f'(x) at some points in between to get an idea.

At x=π/2:

cos(π/2)=0, cos(4*(π/2))=cos(2π)=1.

So, f'(π/2)=2*0 +4*1=4.

Positive again.

Hmm, so at 0, π/2, and π, f'(x) is positive. So, maybe the function is always increasing? But that can't be, because f(0)=0 and f(π)=0, so if it's always increasing, it can't come back down. Wait, that's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be points where the derivative is negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating f'(π). Let me double-check.

f'(π)=2 cos π +4 cos 4π.

cos π is -1, cos 4π is 1.

So, 2*(-1) +4*(1)= -2 +4=2. Correct.

Wait, but if f'(x) is positive at 0, π/2, and π, maybe the function f(x) is increasing on the entire interval, but that's impossible because it starts and ends at zero. So, that suggests that f(x) must have some local maxima and minima, which would require the derivative to be zero at some points in between.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating f'(x) somewhere. Let me try x=π/3.

cos(π/3)=0.5, cos(4*(π/3))=cos(4π/3)=cos(π + π/3)= -cos(π/3)= -0.5.

So, f'(π/3)=2*(0.5) +4*(-0.5)=1 -2= -1.

Ah, so at x=π/3, the derivative is -1, which is negative. So, the derivative goes from positive at 0 to negative at π/3, implying a local maximum somewhere between 0 and π/3, but wait, no, because the derivative is positive at 0 and then becomes negative at π/3, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point between 0 and π/3 where the derivative is zero, indicating a local maximum.

Wait, but wait, f'(0)=6, positive. At x=π/3, f'(x)=-1. So, the derivative changes sign from positive to negative between 0 and π/3, which would imply a local maximum in that interval. So, that's one zero crossing.

Similarly, let's check another point, say x=2π/3.

cos(2π/3)= -0.5, cos(4*(2π/3))=cos(8π/3)=cos(2π + 2π/3)=cos(2π/3)= -0.5.

So, f'(2π/3)=2*(-0.5) +4*(-0.5)= -1 -2= -3.

Still negative.

What about x=π/4:

cos(π/4)=√2/2≈0.7071, cos(4*(π/4))=cos(π)= -1.

So, f'(π/4)=2*(√2/2) +4*(-1)=√2 -4 ≈1.4142 -4≈-2.5858, which is negative.

Hmm, so between 0 and π/3, derivative goes from 6 to -1, crossing zero once. Then, from π/3 to π/2, it goes from -1 to 4, which is a change from negative to positive, implying another zero crossing. Then from π/2 to π, it goes from 4 to 2, which is positive throughout, so perhaps no crossing there.

Wait, but let's check another point, say x=3π/4.

cos(3π/4)= -√2/2≈-0.7071, cos(4*(3π/4))=cos(3π)= -1.

So, f'(3π/4)=2*(-√2/2) +4*(-1)= -√2 -4 ≈-1.4142 -4≈-5.4142, which is negative.

Wait, but earlier at x=π/2, f'(x)=4, positive. So between π/2 and 3π/4, the derivative goes from positive 4 to negative -5.4142, so it must cross zero somewhere in that interval. So that's another zero crossing.

Wait, so let me recap:

- Between 0 and π/3: f'(x) goes from 6 to -1 → crosses zero once.

- Between π/3 and π/2: f'(x) goes from -1 to 4 → crosses zero once.

- Between π/2 and 3π/4: f'(x) goes from 4 to -5.4142 → crosses zero once.

Wait, but then from 3π/4 to π, f'(x) is at x=π, it's 2, positive. So between 3π/4 and π, the derivative goes from -5.4142 to 2 → crosses zero once more.

Wait, let's check x=5π/6.

cos(5π/6)= -√3/2≈-0.8660, cos(4*(5π/6))=cos(10π/3)=cos(10π/3 - 2π*1)=cos(4π/3)= -0.5.

So, f'(5π/6)=2*(-√3/2) +4*(-0.5)= -√3 -2 ≈-1.732 -2≈-3.732, which is negative.

At x=π, f'(x)=2, positive.

So, between 5π/6 and π, derivative goes from -3.732 to 2 → crosses zero once.

Wait, so now I'm seeing four crossings:

1. Between 0 and π/3.

2. Between π/3 and π/2.

3. Between π/2 and 3π/4.

4. Between 3π/4 and π.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that between π/2 and 3π/4, the derivative goes from positive to negative, so one zero crossing. Then from 3π/4 to 5π/6, it's negative, and then from 5π/6 to π, it goes from negative to positive, so another crossing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps I can sketch or analyze the function's behavior more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the number of zeros by considering the equation f'(x)=0, which is 2 cos x +4 cos4x=0.

I can rewrite this as:

2 cos x = -4 cos4x → cos x = -2 cos4x.

But the maximum value of cos x is 1, and the minimum is -1. Similarly, cos4x ranges between -1 and 1. So, the right side is -2 cos4x, which ranges between -2 and 2. But since cos x can only be between -1 and 1, the equation cos x = -2 cos4x can only hold when -2 cos4x is within [-1,1].

So, -2 cos4x must be ≥-1 and ≤1.

Which implies that cos4x must be ≥ -0.5 and ≤0.5.

So, cos4x ∈ [-0.5, 0.5].

Which occurs when 4x is in the regions where cosine is between -0.5 and 0.5.

We know that cosθ = 0.5 when θ = ±π/3 + 2πk, and cosθ = -0.5 when θ= ±2π/3 + 2πk.

So, for θ=4x, the equation cos4x ∈ [-0.5, 0.5] implies that 4x is in the intervals [π/3, 2π/3] + 2πk, or [4π/3, 5π/3] + 2πk, etc.

But since x is in [0, π], 4x ranges from 0 to 4π.

So, let's find all θ=4x in [0,4π] where cosθ ∈ [-0.5, 0.5].

These intervals occur between θ=π/3 and 2π/3, then between 4π/3 and 5π/3, and then again between 7π/3 and 8π/3, but 8π/3 is beyond 4π, which is approximately 12.566. So, 7π/3≈7.330, and 8π/3≈8.377, which is within 4π≈12.566. So, there are three intervals where cosθ is between -0.5 and 0.5:

1. θ ∈ [π/3, 2π/3] ≈ [1.047, 2.094]

2. θ ∈ [4π/3, 5π/3] ≈ [4.188, 5.236]

3. θ ∈ [7π/3, 8π/3] ≈ [7.330, 8.377]

Each of these intervals corresponds to x in [0, π], since θ=4x.

So, for each interval of θ, we can find the corresponding x.

Let me compute the x ranges for each θ interval.

1. θ ∈ [π/3, 2π/3] → x ∈ [π/(3*4), 2π/(3*4)] → [π/12, π/6].

2. θ ∈ [4π/3,5π/3] → x ∈ [4π/(3*4),5π/(3*4)] → [π/3,5π/12].

3. θ ∈ [7π/3,8π/3] → x ∈ [7π/(3*4),8π/(3*4)] → [7π/12, 2π/3].

Wait, but 8π/3 is approximately 8.377, and 4π is approximately 12.566, so 8π/3 is less than 4π. So, all three intervals are within θ ∈ [0,4π], so each gives a corresponding x interval in [0, π].

So, in each of these x intervals, the equation cosx = -2 cos4x may have solutions.

But I'm not sure how this helps me directly, but perhaps each of these intervals could correspond to a zero crossing of f'(x).

Alternatively, perhaps using the Intermediate Value Theorem on f'(x) in each interval where it changes sign.

Earlier, I saw that f'(0)=6, f'(π/3)=-1, so sign change, one zero between 0 and π/3.

Then, f'(π/3)=-1, f'(π/2)=4, so another sign change, another zero between π/3 and π/2.

Then, f'(π/2)=4, f'(3π/4)=-5.4142 → sign change, another zero between π/2 and 3π/4.

Then, f'(3π/4)=-5.4142, f'(5π/6)=-3.732, f'(π)=2. So, between 5π/6 and π, f'(x) goes from -3.732 to 2 → sign change, another zero crossing.

Wait, but that suggests four zero crossings, which would correspond to four points where f'(c)=0, satisfying the MVT condition. But the options don't include 4 as an answer for the number of points where MVT holds. Wait, the options are A:6, B:0, C:3, D:5, E:8, F:7, G:4, H:9, I:2, J:1.

So, option G is 4. So, is the answer G:4?

Wait, but earlier I thought four zeros, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recount:

1. Between 0 and π/3: one zero.

2. Between π/3 and π/2: another zero.

3. Between π/2 and 3π/4: another zero.

4. Between 3π/4 and π: another zero.

Wait, that's four zeros. So, the function f'(x) crosses zero four times in (0, π), which would mean there are four points c where f'(c)=0, satisfying the MVT condition. So, the answer would be G:4.

But wait, earlier when I checked f'(3π/4)=-5.4142, and f'(5π/6)=-3.732, which are both negative, and then at x=π, f'(π)=2, positive. So between 5π/6 and π, the derivative goes from negative to positive, implying another zero crossing. So that's a fourth zero.

Wait, but let me check another point between π/2 and 3π/4, say x=2π/3.

At x=2π/3, cos(2π/3)=-0.5, cos(4*(2π/3))=cos(8π/3)=cos(8π/3 - 2π)=cos(2π/3)= -0.5.

So, f'(2π/3)=2*(-0.5)+4*(-0.5)= -1 -2= -3.

So, between π/2 (f'(π/2)=4) and 2π/3 (f'(2π/3)=-3), the derivative goes from positive to negative, crossing zero once.

Similarly, between 2π/3 and 3π/4, f'(2π/3)=-3, f'(3π/4)= -5.4142. Both negative, so no crossing there.

Then between 3π/4 and 5π/6, f'(3π/4)=-5.4142, f'(5π/6)=-3.732. Both negative, no crossing.

Between 5π/6 and π, f'(5π/6)=-3.732, f'(π)=2 → crosses zero once.

So, in total:

1. 0 to π/3: 1

2. π/3 to π/2: 1

3. π/2 to 2π/3: 1

4. 5π/6 to π: 1

Wait, that's four crossings. So, four points where f'(c)=0.

But wait, earlier I thought between π/2 and 3π/4, but perhaps I should check another point. Let me check x=3π/4:

f'(3π/4)=2 cos(3π/4) +4 cos(4*(3π/4))= 2*(-√2/2) +4 cos(3π)= -√2 +4*(-1)= -√2 -4≈-1.4142 -4≈-5.4142.

So, between π/2 and 3π/4, the derivative goes from 4 to -5.4142, so one crossing.

Then, between 3π/4 and 5π/6, the derivative remains negative, so no crossing.

Between 5π/6 and π, it goes from -3.732 to 2 → another crossing.

So, that's four crossings in total.

Thus, the number of points where f'(c)=0 on (0, π) is 4, which would be the number of times the MVT is satisfied.

Wait, but the options are given as A to J, with G being 4.

So, the answer should be G:4.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the question is: "At how many points on the interval [0,π] does f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x satisfy the Mean Value Theorem?"

Wait, the Mean Value Theorem is about the existence of at least one point c in (a, b) such that f'(c) equals the average rate. But the question is phrased as "how many points", so perhaps it's referring to the number of c's where f'(c)=0, as in the average rate is zero in this case.

So, if there are four such c's, then the answer is G:4.

To determine how many points on the interval [0, π] satisfy the Mean Value Theorem for the function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x, we first verify that f(x) is continuous on [0, π] and differentiable on (0, π), ensuring the MVT applies. The average rate of change of f(x) over [0, π] is zero since f(0) = f(π) = 0. Therefore, we need to find the number of points c in (0, π) where f'(c) = 0.

The derivative is f'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x. Solving f'(x) = 0 leads to the equation 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0. Using trigonometric identities and analyzing the behavior of f'(x) at key points (e.g., x = 0, π/3, π/2, 2π/3, 3π/4, 5π/6, π), we determine that f'(x) changes sign four times in the interval (0, π), indicating four solutions where f'(c) = 0. Thus, the function satisfies the Mean Value Theorem at four points.
