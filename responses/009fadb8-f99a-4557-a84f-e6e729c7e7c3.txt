Question:

A 35-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3-day history of severe right back pain. She has not had any fever, chills, or weight loss. She has no history of major medical illness. Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. When told that her examination is normal, the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer. The patient already contacted her insurance company, who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan. The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?

Options:

A: Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care
B: Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings
C: Immediately inform the patient's insurance company about what the patient has asked the physician to do
D: Order the MRI as the patient requests

Okay, let's try to figure out the best answer for this question. So, the scenario is about a 35-year-old woman with severe back pain for three days. She doesn't have any other symptoms like fever, chills, or weight loss. Her physical and neurological exams are normal, but she's really upset, especially because her mother died from breast cancer that spread to the bone. She's scared she might have cancer too and wants an MRI. She already called her insurance, which said an MRI might be covered if she has neurological issues. Now she's asking the doctor to say she has neurological findings so they can get the MRI approved.

The question is, what should the doctor do first? The options are A to D.

First, I think about the patient's situation. She has no physical or neurological signs, so an MRI isn't medically necessary. But she's anxious because of her mother's history. The insurance is only covering the MRI if there are neurological abnormalities, which don't exist here.

Option A suggests changing insurance. That doesn't make sense because the issue is about the current coverage, not switching plans. Plus, that's not a medical solution.

Option B says to explain she doesn't need the MRI and not to misrepresent her exam. That sounds responsible. The doctor should be honest about the findings and not lie to get the MRI approved. It's about setting clear boundaries and providing reassurance.

Option C is informing the insurance company. That might be a step, but it's not the initial action. The doctor should first talk to the patient and explain why the MRI isn't needed. Plus, contacting insurance without the patient's consent might be a privacy issue.

Option D is just ordering the MRI as she asks. But that's not appropriate because there's no indication from the exam. It would be wrong to order unnecessary tests, which could lead to more issues down the line.

So, the best initial action is probably B. The doctor should inform the patient that the MRI isn't necessary and that it's not right to misrepresent her exam. This approach addresses her anxiety and upholds medical integrity.

The most appropriate initial action is to explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings. This approach addresses her anxiety while maintaining medical integrity and avoiding unnecessary testing.

Answer: B
