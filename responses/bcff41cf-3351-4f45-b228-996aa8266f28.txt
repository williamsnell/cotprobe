Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an elevator and the tension in its cable. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that when dealing with forces and motion, Newton's laws are usually involved. 

Alright, the problem says the elevator is accelerated upward at 2 ft/s², and it weighs 500 lb. I need to find the tension in the supporting cable. Hmm, tension... that's the force the cable exerts upwards, right?

Wait, so the elevator's weight is 500 lb. Weight is a force due to gravity, so that's the gravitational force acting downward. I think the formula for weight is mass times gravity. But wait, in the imperial system, weight is already in pounds, which is a unit of force. So maybe I don't need to convert it to kg or anything. 

Newton's second law says F = ma, where F is the net force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. But here, the elevator is moving upward with an acceleration, so the net force would be the tension minus the weight, because tension is pulling up and weight is pulling down.

So, the net force F_net equals ma. But wait, the mass here is the same as the weight divided by gravity, right? Because weight W = mg, so m = W/g. Since W is 500 lb, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Wait, what's the value of g in ft/s²? I remember it's approximately 32 ft/s².

So, mass m = 500 lb / 32 ft/s². Let me calculate that. 500 divided by 32 is... let's see, 32 times 15 is 480, so 500 minus 480 is 20. So 15 and 20/32, which is 15.625 slugs. Wait, slugs are the unit of mass in the imperial system, right?

Now, the elevator is accelerating upward at 2 ft/s². So the net force F_net is m*a = 15.625 slugs * 2 ft/s². That's 31.25 pounds. Wait, because Newton's law in imperial units uses pounds-force, so yeah, that makes sense.

So F_net = Tension (T) - Weight (W) = m*a. So T = W + m*a. Wait, because F_net is T upwards minus W downwards, and F_net is ma upwards. So T = W + m*a.

Wait, but W is 500 lb, and m*a is 31.25 lb. So adding them together, T = 500 + 31.25 = 531.25 lb. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 531.2 lb. That must be the answer. 

Let me double-check. The elevator is accelerating upward, so the tension must be more than the weight. Since the options include 531.2, which is just a bit more than 500, that makes sense. The other options like 560 or 540 are higher, but the acceleration is only 2 ft/s², so the increase shouldn't be too big. 

Wait, another way to think about it: the tension is the normal force here. When you accelerate upward, the normal force (tension in this case) increases. So yeah, T = m(g + a). Since m is 15.625 slugs, T = 15.625*(32 + 2) = 15.625 *34. Let me calculate that. 15 *34 is 510, and 0.625*34 is 21.25, so total is 531.25 lb. Yep, that's the same as before. So option B is correct.

The tension in the cable is calculated using Newton's second law, considering the elevator's weight and upward acceleration. The tension is found to be 531.2 lb.

Answer: B
