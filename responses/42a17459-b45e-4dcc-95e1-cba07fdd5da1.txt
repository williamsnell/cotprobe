Okay, so I need to figure out how to round the number 0.1476 to different decimal places as per the question. The question has three parts: (a) rounding to 2 decimal places, (b) to 3 decimal places, and (c) to 1 decimal place. The options provided are A through D, each giving different answers for these parts.

First, I should remember the rules for rounding. When rounding a number to a certain decimal place, you look at the next digit to decide whether to round up or keep it the same. If the next digit is 5 or higher, you round up; if it's less than 5, you leave it as is.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): rounding to 2 decimal places. The number is 0.1476. The two decimal places are the first two digits after the decimal point, which are 1 and 4, making it 0.14. The next digit after 4 is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, I should round the 4 up by one. So, 4 becomes 5, making it 0.15. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh, wait, no, because the first two decimals are 1 and 4, so the next digit is the third decimal place, which is 7. So, yes, rounding 0.1476 to two decimals would be 0.15 because the 7 causes the 4 to round up to 5.

Next, part (b): rounding to 3 decimal places. The number is 0.1476. The third decimal place is 7, and the next digit is 6. Again, since 6 is greater than 5, I round up the 7 to 8. So, 0.1476 becomes 0.148 when rounded to three decimal places.

Now, part (c): rounding to 1 decimal place. The first decimal is 1, and the next digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I don't round up. So, 0.1476 rounded to one decimal place remains 0.1.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches these results.

Option A: (a) .14, (b) .147, (c) .1 → Part (a) is .14, but we calculated 0.15, so A is incorrect.

Option B: (a) .16, (b) .149, (c) .1 → Part (a) is .16, which is higher than our result of 0.15, so B might be wrong.

Option C: (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → All parts match our calculations. So C looks correct.

Option D: (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .2 → Part (b) is .147, but we got .148, so D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is option C, which correctly rounds 0.1476 to 0.15 for two decimal places, 0.148 for three, and 0.1 for one.

Answer: C
