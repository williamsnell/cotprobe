Question:

The average concentration of particulate lead in a city with highly polluted air is 5\mug/m^3. If an adult respires 8500 liters of air daily and if 50 per cent of the particles below 1\mumin size are retained in the lungs, calculate how much lead is absorbed in the lungs each day. Of the particu-late lead in urban air, 75 per cent is less than 1\mumin size.

Options:

A: 6.4 μg
B: 25.0 μg
C: 30.0 μg
D: 8.5\mug
E: 10.6 μg
F: 21.3 μg
G: 42.5\mug
H: 15.9\mug
I: 37.5\mug
J: 12.7 μg

Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The average concentration of particulate lead in a city with highly polluted air is 5 μg/m³. An adult breathes 8500 liters of air daily. Now, 50% of the particles below 1 μm in size are retained in the lungs. Also, 75% of the particulate lead is less than 1 μm in size. I need to calculate how much lead is absorbed in the lungs each day. 

Hmm, so I think the steps here are: first, find out how much particulate lead is in the air the person breathes, then determine how much of that is less than 1 μm, and then calculate how much is retained based on the 50% efficiency.

Wait, but the concentration is given as 5 μg/m³. So the total lead in the air is 5 μg per cubic meter. But the person is breathing 8500 liters daily. I should convert liters to cubic meters because the units are different. 

Right, 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters. So 8500 liters is 8.5 m³. So the total amount of lead the person inhales is concentration multiplied by volume. So 5 μg/m³ * 8.5 m³ = 42.5 μg of lead inhaled daily.

But wait, not all of that is less than 1 μm. 75% of the particulate lead is less than 1 μm. So I need to find 75% of 42.5 μg. Let's calculate that: 0.75 * 42.5 = 31.875 μg. So that's the amount of lead particles smaller than 1 μm that the person inhales.

But then, only 50% of those particles are retained in the lungs. So I take 31.875 μg and multiply by 0.5. That gives 15.9375 μg. Looking at the options, I see option H is 15.9 μg, which matches this. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The concentration is 5 μg/m³, and they breathe 8.5 m³, so 5 *8.5=42.5 μg total. 75% of that is 31.875 μg. Half retained is 15.9375. So yes, approximately 15.9 μg, which is option H. 

Alternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Is the 50% retention applied to all the inhaled particles, or just the small ones? The question says 50% of the particles below 1 μm are retained. So yes, that's correct. So the steps are correct.

The average concentration of particulate lead is 5 μg/m³. An adult breathes 8500 liters daily, which is 8.5 m³. The total lead inhaled is 5 μg/m³ × 8.5 m³ = 42.5 μg. Since 75% of the lead is less than 1 μm, this amounts to 0.75 × 42.5 = 31.875 μg. Half of these small particles are retained, so 0.5 × 31.875 = 15.9375 μg. The closest option is H: 15.9 μg.

Answer: H
