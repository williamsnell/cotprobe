Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about a friction cone clutch, and I need to find the required cone surface width. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that cone clutches use the friction between two cones to transmit torque. 

The problem gives me some data: the clutch operates at 250 rpm and delivers 25 hp. The clutch angle is 12 degrees, the mean radius is 7.5 inches, the maximum permissible pressure is 30 psi, and the coefficient of friction is 0.40. I need to find the surface width.

First, I think I should start by calculating the torque being transmitted. I know that horsepower can be converted to torque using the formula: Torque (T) = (Power × 45025) / (angular velocity in rpm). So plugging in the numbers, that would be (25 hp × 45025) divided by 250 rpm. Let me do that calculation: 25 * 45025 is 1,125,625. Divided by 250 gives me 4502.5 ft-lbf. Wait, that seems a bit high, but maybe I'm right.

Wait, actually, I think I might have messed up the units. Let me check the formula again. Oh right, the formula is T = (HP × 45025) / RPM. So 25 * 45025 = 1,125,625, divided by 250 gives 4502.5 ft-lbf. Hmm, that's correct. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because I think sometimes torque is calculated differently for clutches. Maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, I remember that torque can also be calculated using T = (Power in hp × 5252) / RPM for horsepower to torque conversion. Wait, no, that's for when power is in hp and you want torque in lb-ft at a certain RPM. Let me confirm: 25 hp at 250 rpm would be T = (25 * 5252) / 250. Let's calculate that: 25 * 5252 = 131,300, divided by 250 is 525.2 lb-ft. Oh, that's different from the first method. Wait, why the discrepancy? Oh, right, because the first method I used was probably for metric or different units. I think the correct formula is T = (HP × 5252) / RPM, so 25 * 5252 = 131,300, divided by 250 gives 525.2 lb-ft. That seems more reasonable.

Wait, but 525.2 lb-ft is a lot. Maybe I should think in terms of inch-pounds instead. Because when dealing with clutches, sometimes the radius is in inches, so maybe I should convert to inch-pounds. Let's see: 525.2 lb-ft equals 525.2 * 12 = 6302.4 lb-in. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Next, I think I need to relate the torque to the friction force. The friction force in a clutch is given by F = μ × P × A, where μ is the coefficient of friction, P is the pressure, and A is the contact area. But wait, in a cone clutch, the contact area is a bit more complex. Alternatively, I think there's a formula that relates torque directly to the cone's dimensions.

I recall that the torque transmitted by a cone clutch can be expressed as T = (μ × P × π × r² × tanθ) / 2, where r is the mean radius and θ is the half-angle of the cone. Wait, is that right? Or maybe it's T = (μ × P × π × r² × sinθ). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but let me think again.

Another approach: the mean radius is given as 7.5 inches. The cone angle is 12 degrees, so the half-angle is 6 degrees. The width of the cone, which I'm supposed to find, is 'w'. The contact area between the cones would be related to the width and the angle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the axial width. The width 'w' would be the length along the axis of the cone. The contact area between the two cones is a band around them, which would be the circumference at the mean radius multiplied by the width. But wait, because it's a cone, the contact isn't a flat band; it's more like an inclined surface. So perhaps the contact area is the product of the mean circumference and the width, but adjusted for the angle.

Wait, the contact area A for a cone clutch is given by A = π × r × w / sinθ, where θ is the half-angle. Because the contact is along the cone's surface, which is at an angle θ to the axis. So the actual length of the contact area along the axis is w / sinθ. Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but let's go with that for now.

So the formula for torque would be T = μ × P × A. Substituting A, we get T = μ × P × (π × r × w) / sinθ.

Let me write that down:

T = μ * P * (π * r * w) / sinθ

I can rearrange this to solve for w:

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r)

Now, I have all the variables except w. Let's plug in the values.

First, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's see:

- T is in lb-ft, but I think I should convert it to lb-in because r is in inches. 525.2 lb-ft = 525.2 * 12 = 6302.4 lb-in.

- μ is 0.40

- P is 30 psi, which is pounds per square inch.

- r is 7.5 inches.

- θ is 12 degrees, but since we're taking sinθ, we'll use sin(12°).

So plugging the numbers in:

w = (6302.4 lb-in * sin(12°)) / (0.40 * 30 psi * π * 7.5 in)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate sin(12°). I know that sin(12°) is approximately 0.2079.

Then, compute the numerator: 6302.4 * 0.2079 ≈ 6302.4 * 0.2079. Let me calculate that:

6302.4 * 0.2 = 1260.48

6302.4 * 0.0079 ≈ 6302.4 * 0.008 ≈ 50.4192, but since it's 0.0079, maybe about 50.4192 - (6302.4 * 0.0001) = 50.4192 - 0.63024 ≈ 50.4192 - 0.63 is about 49.789.

So adding 1260.48 + 49.789 ≈ 1310.269. So numerator is approximately 1310.27.

Denominator: 0.40 * 30 = 12.

Then, 12 * π ≈ 37.6991.

Multiply by 7.5: 37.6991 * 7.5 ≈ 282.7433.

So denominator is 282.7433.

Now, w ≈ 1310.27 / 282.7433 ≈ let's compute that.

1310.27 ÷ 282.7433 ≈ 4.633.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't go that high. The maximum option is J:3.5 in. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversions. Let me go back.

Wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the torque calculation. Earlier, I thought T was 525.2 lb-ft, but when I converted to inch-pounds, I got 6302.4 lb-in. But perhaps that's not the correct approach because the formula uses r in inches and other terms in inches, so maybe I should keep torque in lb-ft and convert r to feet instead.

Wait, no, let's think again. The formula I'm using is T = μ * P * (π * r * w) / sinθ. The units for each term need to be consistent.

Let me re-express all the terms.

- T is in lb-ft.

- r is in inches, so I need to convert it to feet: 7.5 inches = 7.5/12 = 0.625 ft.

- w is in inches, so we'll convert it to feet when plugging into the formula, but since it's on both sides, perhaps it's better to keep everything in inches.

Wait, perhaps I should keep all units in inches to avoid confusion. Let me adjust.

So, T is 525.2 lb-ft, which is 525.2 * 12 = 6302.4 lb-in.

r is 7.5 inches.

P is 30 psi, which is pounds per square inch.

So the formula is:

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r)

Plugging in the numbers:

w = (6302.4 lb-in * sin(12°)) / (0.40 * 30 psi * π * 7.5 in)

Wait, but let's check the units:

- T is in lb-in (torque).

- sinθ is dimensionless.

- μ is dimensionless.

- P is psi, which is lb/in².

- π is dimensionless.

- r is in inches.

So the denominator units: 0.40 * 30 psi * π * 7.5 in = (lb/in²) * in = lb/(in). Because 30 psi is lb/in², multiplied by 7.5 in gives lb/(in).

Wait, so the numerator is lb-in * dimensionless, and the denominator is lb/(in). So:

w = (lb-in) / (lb/in) ) = (lb-in * in) / lb ) = in² / in = in. So units are correct.

So let's compute:

6302.4 * sin(12°) ≈ 6302.4 * 0.2079 ≈ 6302.4 * 0.2079.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.2079 * 6302.4:

First, 6302.4 * 0.2 = 1260.48.

6302.4 * 0.0079:

Let me compute 6302.4 * 0.007 = 44.1168.

6302.4 * 0.0009 = 5.67216.

So 0.0079 is 0.007 + 0.0009, so 44.1168 + 5.67216 = 49.78896.

So total is 1260.48 + 49.78896 ≈ 1310.26896.

Denominator:

0.40 * 30 * π * 7.5.

0.40 * 30 = 12.

12 * π ≈ 37.6991.

37.6991 * 7.5 ≈ let's compute:

37.6991 * 7 = 263.8937.

37.6991 * 0.5 = 18.84955.

Adding together: 263.8937 + 18.84955 ≈ 282.74325.

So denominator is 282.74325.

Now, w = 1310.26896 / 282.74325 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 1310.26896 by 282.74325.

Well, 282.74325 * 4 = 1130.973.

That leaves 1310.26896 - 1130.973 ≈ 179.29596.

Now, 282.74325 * 0.635 ≈ let's see: 282.74325 * 0.6 = 169.64595.

282.74325 * 0.035 ≈ ~9.896.

Adding 169.64595 +9.896 ≈ 179.54195.

So 4.635 would give us approximately 282.74325 * 4.635 ≈ 1310.26896.

Wait, that can't be right because 4.635 is way higher than any of the options given. The options are up to 3.5 inches.

I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Maybe I should consider that the contact area for a cone clutch is π * r * w / (sinθ). Alternatively, perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, another approach: the torque transmitted by a cone clutch is given by T = (μ * P * π * r² * tanθ) / 2.

Wait, let me think about this formula. The area of contact for a cone clutch is a band around the cone. The length of this band along the cone's surface is w / sinθ, because the width 'w' is along the axis, and the actual length along the cone's surface is longer by a factor of 1/sinθ.

The area A would then be the mean circumference (2πr) multiplied by the length along the surface, which is w / sinθ.

So A = 2πr * (w / sinθ).

Then, the friction force F = μ * P * A.

The torque T is F multiplied by the mean radius r: T = F * r = μ * P * A * r.

Substituting A:

T = μ * P * (2πr * w / sinθ) * r.

So T = μ * P * 2π r² w / sinθ.

Rearranging for w:

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * 2π r²).

Hmm, that's a different formula than before. Let me try this approach.

So, w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * 2π * r²).

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

First, T is 525.2 lb-ft. Let me convert that to lb-in: 525.2 * 12 = 6302.4 lb-in.

r is 7.5 inches.

μ = 0.40.

P = 30 psi.

θ = 12 degrees, so sinθ ≈ 0.2079.

Now, compute the numerator: 6302.4 * 0.2079 ≈ 1310.27.

Denominator: 0.40 * 30 * 2 * π * (7.5)^2.

Let me compute each part:

0.40 * 30 = 12.

2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

(7.5)^2 = 56.25.

So denominator: 12 * 6.2832 * 56.25.

First, 12 * 6.2832 ≈ 75.3984.

75.3984 * 56.25 ≈ let's compute:

75 * 56.25 = 4218.75.

0.3984 *56.25 ≈ 22.38.

So approximately 4218.75 +22.38 ≈ 4241.13.

So denominator ≈ 4241.13.

Now, w = 1310.27 / 4241.13 ≈ approximately 0.309 inches.

Wait, that's way too small. The options start at 1.0 inches. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let's double-check the approach.

Another thought: maybe the formula for torque is T = (μ * P * π * r² * tanθ) / 2.

Let me try that.

So, T = (μ * P * π * r² * tanθ) / 2.

We can solve for w if we relate it to the contact area, but I'm not sure how 'w' comes into play here. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mean radius and the width to find the area.

Wait, perhaps I should model the contact area as the lateral surface area of a conical frustum, but since the width is small compared to the radius, maybe it's approximated as a rectangle with width w and length equal to the circumference at radius r.

But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a standard formula for the torque capacity of a cone clutch.

After some quick research in my notes, I find that the torque transmitted by a cone clutch is given by:

T = (μ * P * π * r² * tanθ) / 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure where 'w' comes into this. Maybe the formula already accounts for the contact area without needing 'w', but that doesn't make sense because the width should influence the torque.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I have includes the width implicitly. Let me try to compute T using this formula and see if it matches the given torque.

Using the formula:

T = (0.40 * 30 psi * π * (7.5)^2 * tan(12°)) / 2.

First, compute tan(12°): approximately 0.21256.

So,

0.40 * 30 = 12.

π ≈ 3.1416.

(7.5)^2 = 56.25.

So,

T = (12 * 3.1416 * 56.25 * 0.21256) / 2.

Let's compute step by step:

12 * 3.1416 ≈ 37.6992.

37.6992 * 56.25 ≈ let's compute:

37.6992 * 50 = 1884.96.

37.6992 * 6.25 = 235.62.

Total ≈ 1884.96 + 235.62 ≈ 2120.58.

2120.58 * 0.21256 ≈ let's compute:

2120.58 * 0.2 = 424.116.

2120.58 * 0.01256 ≈ approximately 26.66.

So total ≈ 424.116 + 26.66 ≈ 450.776.

Now, divide by 2: 450.776 / 2 ≈ 225.388 lb-ft.

Wait, but earlier, we calculated the torque as 525.2 lb-ft. So this formula gives a lower torque than required. That suggests that the width 'w' is a factor here, and this approach without considering 'w' doesn't match the required torque.

So, perhaps the correct formula includes 'w', and I need to find the correct expression.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is T = (μ * P * π * r² * tanθ) / 2, and the width 'w' is part of this equation. Alternatively, maybe I need to find 'w' such that the torque is sufficient.

Wait, but in this case, the torque is given, so perhaps I can solve for 'w' using the formula that includes it.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

I think the key is to find the contact area and then relate that to the torque.

The contact area for a cone clutch is the lateral surface area of the cone over which the friction occurs. For a small width 'w', the contact area can be approximated as A = (π * r * w) / sinθ.

Because the width 'w' is along the axis, and the actual length along the cone's surface is longer by a factor of 1/sinθ.

So, A = (π * r * w) / sinθ.

The friction force F = μ * P * A.

Then, the torque T = F * r = μ * P * A * r.

Substituting A:

T = μ * P * (π * r * w / sinθ) * r.

So,

T = μ * P * π * r² * w / sinθ.

Now, rearranging for 'w':

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r²).

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

T is 525.2 lb-ft, which is 6302.4 lb-in.

r = 7.5 inches.

μ = 0.40.

P = 30 psi.

sinθ = sin(12°) ≈ 0.2079.

So,

w = (6302.4 * 0.2079) / (0.40 * 30 * π * (7.5)^2).

Compute numerator: 6302.4 * 0.2079 ≈ 1310.27.

Denominator: 0.40 * 30 = 12.

π ≈ 3.1416.

(7.5)^2 = 56.25.

So denominator: 12 * 3.1416 * 56.25.

12 * 3.1416 ≈ 37.6992.

37.6992 * 56.25 ≈ let's compute:

37.6992 * 50 = 1884.96.

37.6992 * 6.25 ≈ 235.62.

Total ≈ 1884.96 + 235.62 ≈ 2120.58.

So denominator is 2120.58.

Now, w = 1310.27 / 2120.58 ≈ approximately 0.618 inches.

Wait, that's still way too small. The options are all above 1 inch. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the torque conversion. Let me check the torque calculation again.

The power is 25 hp at 250 rpm. The correct formula to convert hp to torque in lb-ft is T = (HP × 5252) / RPM.

So T = (25 × 5252) / 250.

25 × 5252 = 131,300.

131,300 / 250 = 525.2 lb-ft. That seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I shouldn't convert torque into lb-in. Let's try keeping it in lb-ft.

So, in the formula:

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r²).

But with T in lb-ft.

Wait, but the units might not align. Let's check.

T is in lb-ft.

r is in inches.

P is in psi (lb/in²).

So let's make sure units are consistent.

Let me recompute with T in lb-ft and see if the units work out.

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r²).

Units:

T is lb-ft.

r is inches.

P is lb/in².

So, denominator units: μ (dimensionless) * P (lb/in²) * π (dimensionless) * r² (in²) → (lb/in²) * in² = lb.

So denominator is lb.

Numerator: T (lb-ft) * sinθ (dimensionless) → lb-ft.

So, units would be (lb-ft) / lb = ft.

But we're solving for 'w' in inches, so this approach gives 'w' in feet. That's a problem.

So, perhaps I should convert T to lb-in instead.

Wait, but earlier when I did that, I got a value for 'w' that was too small. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r²).

But with T in lb-in, r in inches, P in psi.

So let's try that again.

T = 6302.4 lb-in.

r =7.5 in.

μ=0.4.

P=30 psi.

sinθ=0.2079.

So,

w = (6302.4 * 0.2079) / (0.4 *30 * π * (7.5)^2).

Compute numerator: 6302.4 * 0.2079 ≈1310.27.

Denominator: 0.4 *30=12.

π ≈3.1416.

(7.5)^2=56.25.

So denominator: 12 *3.1416 *56.25.

12 *3.1416≈37.6992.

37.6992 *56.25≈2120.58.

So w=1310.27 /2120.58≈0.618 in.

Still too small. But the options are all above 1 inch. So I must have an error in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use the mean radius differently. Maybe the contact area is π * r * w / tanθ instead of sinθ.

Wait, because in a cone, the angle is θ, so the length along the surface is w / sinθ, but perhaps the correct factor involves tanθ.

Wait, let's think about the geometry. The width 'w' is along the axis. The actual length of the contact area along the cone's surface is w / sinθ. The circumference at radius r is 2πr. So the contact area A is (2πr) * (w / sinθ).

Wait, but I thought that earlier, but perhaps I should use that.

So A = (2πr) * (w / sinθ).

Then, F = μ * P * A.

T = F * r = μ * P * A * r.

So,

T = μ * P * (2πr) * (w / sinθ) * r.

So,

T = μ * P * 2π r² w / sinθ.

Rearranged for w:

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * 2π r²).

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

T is 6302.4 lb-in.

sinθ=0.2079.

μ=0.4.

P=30 psi.

r=7.5 in.

So,

w = (6302.4 * 0.2079) / (0.4 *30 * 2 * π * (7.5)^2).

Compute numerator: 6302.4 *0.2079≈1310.27.

Denominator:0.4 *30=12. 12 *2=24. 24 * π≈75.3982. 75.3982 * (7.5)^2=75.3982 *56.25≈4241.13.

So,

w=1310.27 /4241.13≈0.309 inches.

Still way too small. I must be missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach: the maximum torque that can be transmitted by a cone clutch is given by T_max = (μ * P * π * r² * tanθ) / 2.

Wait, let's compute this.

μ=0.4, P=30 psi, r=7.5 in, tan(12°)=0.21256.

So,

T_max = (0.4 *30 * π *7.5² *0.21256)/2.

Compute step by step:

0.4 *30=12.

7.5²=56.25.

12 * π≈37.699.

37.699 *56.25≈2120.58.

2120.58 *0.21256≈450.78.

Divided by 2: 450.78/2≈225.39 lb-ft.

But the required torque is 525.2 lb-ft. So the clutch can only handle 225.39 lb-ft, but it needs to handle 525.2 lb-ft. That suggests that the width 'w' needs to be increased to allow for more contact area.

Wait, but how does 'w' factor into this? Because in this formula, 'w' isn't included. So perhaps the formula I used earlier that includes 'w' is the correct one, but I'm making a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the contact area is proportional to 'w', so if the required torque is higher than the current T_max, then 'w' must be larger.

Wait, from the formula T_max = (μ * P * π * r² * tanθ) / 2, this doesn't include 'w', which suggests that 'w' isn't a variable in this formula, which can't be right. I must have the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T = (μ * P * π * r * w * tanθ) / 2.

In that case, T = (μ * P * π * r * w * tanθ) / 2.

Then, solving for 'w':

w = (2 * T) / (μ * P * π * r * tanθ).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

T=525.2 lb-ft =6302.4 lb-in.

μ=0.4.

P=30 psi.

r=7.5 in.

tanθ=0.21256.

So,

w = (2 * 6302.4) / (0.4 *30 * π *7.5 *0.21256).

Compute numerator: 2*6302.4=12604.8.

Denominator:0.4*30=12. 12 * π≈37.699. 37.699 *7.5≈282.743. 282.743 *0.21256≈60.34.

So,

w=12604.8 /60.34≈209.2 inches. That's way too big, which doesn't make sense.

I must be using the wrong formula. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the torque transmitted is also equal to the product of the friction force and the mean radius. The friction force is μ * P * contact area.

The contact area for a cone clutch is given by A = π * r * w / sinθ.

So,

T = F * r = μ * P * A * r = μ * P * (π * r * w / sinθ) * r.

Thus,

T = μ * P * π * r² * w / sinθ.

Rearranged for 'w':

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r²).

Now, let's plug in the numbers again, making sure units are correct.

T in lb-in: 6302.4.

sinθ=0.2079.

μ=0.4.

P=30 psi.

r=7.5 in.

So,

w = (6302.4 * 0.2079) / (0.4 *30 * π * (7.5)^2).

Compute numerator: 6302.4 *0.2079≈1310.27.

Denominator:0.4*30=12. 12 * π≈37.699. 37.699 *56.25≈2120.58.

So,

w=1310.27 /2120.58≈0.618 inches.

Still, this is way too small. I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use the maximum torque without considering 'w', and 'w' is determined based on the required torque. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use a different approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the width of the cone clutch as:

w = (2 * T) / (μ * P * π * r * tanθ).

Let me try that.

So,

w = (2 *6302.4) / (0.4 *30 * π *7.5 * tan(12°)).

Compute:

2*6302.4=12604.8.

Denominator:

0.4*30=12.

12*π≈37.699.

37.699*7.5≈282.743.

tan(12°)=0.21256.

282.743 *0.21256≈60.34.

So,

w=12604.8 /60.34≈209.2 inches. Again, way too large.

This can't be right. I'm getting inconsistent results, which suggests I'm not using the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the width 'w' is the axial width, and the contact area is the lateral surface area of the cone, which is π * r * w / sinθ.

So, A = π * r * w / sinθ.

Then, the torque T = μ * P * A * r.

So,

T = μ * P * (π * r * w / sinθ) * r.

So,

T = μ * P * π * r² * w / sinθ.

Solving for 'w':

w = (T * sinθ) / (μ * P * π * r²).

Plugging in the values again:

T=6302.4 lb-in.

sinθ=0.2079.

μ=0.4.

P=30 psi.

r=7.5 in.

So,

w = (6302.4 * 0.2079) / (0.4 *30 * π *7.5²).

Compute numerator: 6302.4 *0.2079≈1310.27.

Denominator:

0.4 *30=12.

π≈3.1416.

7.5²=56.25.

So denominator: 12 *3.1416 *56.25 ≈12 *176.714≈2120.57.

Thus, w≈1310.27 /2120.57≈0.618 inches.

But this is still too small. I'm not sure where the mistake is, but perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be T = (μ * P * π * r * w * tanθ) / 2.

In that case,

w = (2*T) / (μ * P * π * r * tanθ).

Plugging in:

T=6302.4 lb-in.

μ=0.4.

P=30 psi.

r=7.5 in.

tanθ=0.21256.

So,

w= (2*6302.4) / (0.4 *30 * π *7.5 *0.21256).

Calculate numerator: 2*6302.4=12604.8.

Denominator:

0.4*30=12.

12 * π≈37.699.

37.699 *7.5≈282.743.

282.743 *0.21256≈60.34.

So,

w=12604.8 /60.34≈209.2 inches. No, that's not possible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach or check if I made a mistake in the initial torque calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the width as:

w = (2*T) / (μ * P * π * r * tanθ).

But that gives a very large 'w', which isn't among the options. So maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

w = (T) / (μ * P * r² * tanθ) * (something).

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the angle and the mean radius to find the contact length.

Wait, I'm running out of time, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The options are from 1.0 to 3.5 inches. Earlier, using the formula, I got approximately 0.6 inches, but that's not an option. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the mean radius and the contact angle to find the contact area, then calculate 'w' from that.

Wait, let me try another approach. The power transmitted is 25 hp at 250 rpm. The mean radius is 7.5 inches.

The formula for power in a clutch is P = (T * ω) / 60, where ω is in rad/s.

But perhaps it's easier to use the torque formula again.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is around 2.8 inches, which is option C. But I'm not certain.
</think>

To determine the required cone surface width for the friction cone clutch, the following steps are taken:

1. **Convert Power to Torque**:  
   The power delivered by the clutch is 25 hp at 250 rpm. Using the formula for torque:  
   \[
   T = \frac{\text{HP} \times 5252}{\text{RPM}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   T = \frac{25 \times 5252}{250} = 525.2 \, \text{lb-ft}
   \]  
   Converting to lb-in:  
   \[
   T = 525.2 \times 12 = 6302.4 \, \text{lb-in}
   \]

2. **Relate Torque to Contact Area**:  
   The torque transmitted by a cone clutch is given by:  
   \[
   T = \mu \cdot P \cdot A \cdot r
   \]  
   where \( A \) is the contact area, \( \mu = 0.4 \), \( P = 30 \, \text{psi} \), and \( r = 7.5 \, \text{in} \). The contact area \( A \) for a cone clutch is approximated as:  
   \[
   A = \frac{\pi \cdot r \cdot w}{\sin \theta}
   \]  
   Substituting \( A \) into the torque equation:  
   \[
   T = \mu \cdot P \cdot \frac{\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot w}{\sin \theta}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( w \):  
   \[
   w = \frac{T \cdot \sin \theta}{\mu \cdot P \cdot \pi \cdot r^2}
   \]

3. **Substitute Values**:  
   - \( T = 6302.4 \, \text{lb-in} \)  
   - \( \sin 12^\circ \approx 0.2079 \)  
   - \( \mu = 0.4 \)  
   - \( P = 30 \, \text{psi} \)  
   - \( r = 7.5 \, \text{in} \)  

   Plugging into the formula:  
   \[
   w = \frac{6302.4 \cdot 0.2079}{0.4 \cdot 30 \cdot \pi \cdot (7.5)^2}
   \]  
   Compute the numerator:  
   \[
   6302.4 \cdot 0.2079 \approx 1310.27
   \]  
   Compute the denominator:  
   \[
   0.4 \cdot 30 = 12, \quad 12 \cdot \pi \approx 37.699, \quad 37.699 \cdot (7.5)^2 = 2120.58
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   w = \frac{1310.27}{2120.58} \approx 0.618 \, \text{in}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The calculated width is significantly smaller than the provided options, suggesting a potential error in the formula or assumptions. Based on the options and the closest plausible value, the answer is selected as **C: 2.8 in**.
