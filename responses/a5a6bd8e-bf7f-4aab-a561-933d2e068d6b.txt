Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about Lewis structures and bond lengths. Hmm, I need to figure out which molecule has the shortest bonds. The options are CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-. Let me think about each of them.

I remember that bond lengths are related to bond order. The higher the bond order, the shorter the bond. Bond order is calculated as (number of bonding electrons - number of antibonding electrons)/2. So, the molecule with the highest bond order will have the shortest bonds.

Let me go through each molecule one by one.

Starting with CO2. Carbon dioxide has a linear structure with two double bonds. Each double bond has a bond order of 2. Wait, no—each double bond is between C and O. So, each bond is a double bond, meaning bond order 2. So the bond length for CO2 would be based on a double bond.

Next, CO3^2-. The carbonate ion. Carbon is the central atom bonded to three oxygens. In the Lewis structure, each O is bonded with a single bond, but there are resonance structures where the double bonds move around. So each bond's average bond order is 1.333 (since each double bond is shared among the three oxygens, each gets one-third of a double bond, so 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333). So the bond order here is about 1.333.

Then, NO2^-. Nitrite ion. Nitrogen is double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to another, but with resonance. So each N-O bond has a bond order of 1.5, because each has one double bond and one single bond, but wait, I think they actually have a resonance where each bond is a single and a double alternately. So each bond in NO2^- has a bond order of 1.5. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. In NO2^-, the structure has resonance between two structures: one with a double bond on one side and a single on the other. So each bond has a bond order of 1.5.

Lastly, NO3^-. The nitrate ion. Nitrogen is in the center with three oxygens. Each bond is a resonance hybrid. Each O is connected with a bond order of 1.333 (since the double bonds rotate, each bond averages 1.333). So each N-O bond is about 1.333.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check each structure.

CO2: Each C=O bond is a double bond, so bond order 2. So bond length is shorter than single bonds.

CO3^2-: Each O is connected with bond order of 4/3 ≈1.333. So each bond is weaker and longer than a double bond.

NO2^-: The structure has two resonance forms. Each N-O bond has a bond order of (1 double bond + 1 single bond + 1 resonance)/2? Wait, no, each N is bonded to two O's. Let me think. Each N-O bond is a resonance between a double and single bond. So the bond order is (number of bonding electrons - antibonding)/2. For NO2^-, each bond has 3 bonding electrons and 0 antibonding? Wait, no. Each N has a double bond to one O and a single to the other, but with resonance. So each bond's average is 1.5. Because each O shares the double bond equally, so each bond is 1.5. So bond order 1.5.

NO3^-: Each N-O bond has a bond order of 4/3, which is about 1.333. So each bond is weaker than in NO2^-.

Wait, so comparing the bond orders:

- CO2: 2
- NO2^-: 1.5
- NO3^-: ~1.333
- CO3^2-: ~1.333

So the highest bond order is in CO2. Therefore, CO2 has the shortest bonds because bond order 2 is higher than the others. But wait, what about F: CO? Oh, the options given include F: CO, which is a carbonyl group. Wait, no, the question is about the four molecules given: CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, NO3^-.

So the options are H: CO2, D: CO3^2-, C: NO2^-, J: NO3^-.

So among the four, CO2 has the highest bond order (2), so the bonds are the shortest. So the molecule with the shortest bonds is CO2, which is option H.

The bond length in a molecule is inversely related to its bond order. A higher bond order corresponds to a shorter bond length. To determine which molecule has the shortest bonds, we analyze the bond orders of the given molecules:

1. **CO2**: Each C=O bond has a bond order of 2 due to the double bond.  
2. **CO3^2-**: The carbonate ion has resonance, resulting in an average bond order of approximately 1.333 for each C-O bond.  
3. **NO2^-**: The nitrite ion has resonance between two structures, giving each N-O bond an average bond order of 1.5.  
4. **NO3^-**: The nitrate ion has resonance, resulting in an average bond order of approximately 1.333 for each N-O bond.  

Among these, **CO2** has the highest bond order (2), meaning it has the shortest bonds. Therefore, the molecule with the shortest bonds is **CO2**.
