Question:

A testator died and through his will gave his entire estate to charity, but the gift failed because the will was executed 10 days prior to the testator's death. A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator. "The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the testator's privacy.
C: admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
D: admissible, as it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements of personal or family history.
E: admissible, because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife.
F: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is considered hearsay.
H: admissible, as it provides evidence of a common law marriage.
I: admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.
J: inadmissible, as the hotel register is not a legal document establishing marriage.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the Dead Man's Statute and hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A testator died and his will gave everything to charity, but the will was executed 10 days before he died. So, that means the will wasn't effective because it was made too early. Then, a man claims he's the son and heir, so he's challenging the estate.

At the trial, the man can't produce a ceremonial marriage certificate, but he has two points of evidence: his mother and the testator cohabited for years, and his mother predeceased the testator by one day. So, the issue is whether the man can prove he's the son through other means, like common law marriage or something else.

The key here is the Dead Man's Statute. I remember that Dead Man's Statutes generally make statements by a deceased person inadmissible unless made against interest or in certain exceptions. They're designed to prevent fraud after someone's death.

The man's attorney called a clerk from a hotel where the testator and his mother stayed. The clerk testified that they often saw the testator sign the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." So, the clerk is testifying about what he saw.

Now, the question is whether this testimony is admissible. Let's look at the options.

Option A says it's inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute. Hmm. The testator is deceased, so any statement by him would be covered. But wait, the clerk is testifying about what he saw, not about what the testator said. The testator signing the register as "Mr. and Mrs." â€” that's the testator's own writing, not the clerk's statement. So maybe it's not hearsay because the clerk is testifying about what he observed, not about what the testator said.

Wait, no. The clerk is testifying that he saw the testator sign the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." So the content of the writing is that the testator wrote "Mr. and Mrs." So the question is whether the content of the writing is being offered for its truth (that they were married) or just as a fact that they stayed there as a couple.

If it's being offered to show that the testator considered the woman as his wife, then it's hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for its truth. But if the Dead Man's Statute applies, then statements by the testator (decedent) are inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Wait, but the clerk is testifying about what he saw, which is the testator signing the register with that title. The clerk's testimony is about his own observations, not about the testator's statements. So is the content of the writing (the title) considered a statement by the testator?

I think yes. Because the testator wrote "Mr. and Mrs. Testator," which is a statement by him indicating marital status. So the clerk's testimony about that is relaying the testator's own statement, which would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

Dead Man's Statute would make this inadmissible unless it's an exception. So, are there any exceptions to Dead Man's Statute? I think some states allow it if the statement is against interest or for purposes like family reputation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony is about a pedigree exception. The pedigree exception allows for certain statements about family history, like marriage or parentage, if they're made by someone with knowledge. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the statement is by the testator, who is deceased.

Wait, but the clerk's testimony isn't about the testator's statement; it's about the clerk's observation of the testator's action of writing that name. So the clerk is testifying about what he saw the testator write, which is a fact. The content of the writing might be hearsay if offered for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that they were married.

But the Dead Man's Statute would prevent the use of the testator's statement (the writing) unless it's an exception. So if the clerk's testimony is about the testator's own writing, then it's a statement by a deceased person, which is inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Inadmissible under Dead Man's Statute. That seems possible.

Option G: Inadmissible because it's hearsay. That's also a possibility because the content of the writing is being offered for the truth.

Wait, but the Dead Man's Statute is a specific rule that makes certain hearsay inadmissible, so if the testimony is hearsay, the Dead Man's Statute would make it inadmissible. Alternatively, if it's not hearsay because the content isn't being offered for its truth, but just as a fact that they stayed as a couple.

Wait, the purpose of the testimony is probably to show that the testator and the woman were married, so the content is being offered for the truth. So it is hearsay.

But under Dead Man's Statute, statements by the deceased are inadmissible unless they are against interest or in certain exceptions. So if the writing "Mr. and Mrs. Testator" is a statement by the deceased, it's inadmissible unless an exception applies.

But in this case, the man is trying to prove parentage, so perhaps the statement is being offered to show they were married. But the Dead Man's Statute would prevent that.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is not hearsay because it's a statement by a party opponent. Wait, no, the testator is the one whose estate is being litigated, so the man is the claimant. So the testator's statement would be against the estate, so maybe not applicable.

Another angle: the clerk's testimony is about what he observed, not about the testator's statement. So the content of the writing is hearsay, but the act of writing is not. So the clerk can testify that he saw the testator write "Mr. and Mrs. Testator," but the content of that writing (as evidence of marriage) would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

But since the testator is deceased, the Dead Man's Statute would make it inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options, option A says inadmissible under Dead Man's Statute. Option G says inadmissible as hearsay. So which is it?

I think the clerk's testimony is about the testator's writing, which is a statement by the deceased. So under the Dead Man's Statute, it's inadmissible unless an exception applies. So the correct answer would be A.

Alternatively, if the testimony is about the clerk's observation (that the testator signed as Mr. and Mrs.), then it's not hearsay because it's a description of what the clerk saw. Wait, no, because the clerk is testifying about the content of the writing, which is an assertion by the testator. So the clerk's testimony is being used to prove that the testator considered himself married, which is the truth of the matter asserted, so it's hearsay.

But the Dead Man's Statute would make it inadmissible unless it's an exception. So the testimony would be inadmissible under Dead Man's Statute.

The question revolves around whether the clerk's testimony about the testator signing the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator" is admissible. The key issue is the Dead Man's Statute, which generally excludes statements by a deceased person unless an exception applies. The clerk's testimony describes the testator's action of writing, which implicitly asserts marital status. This content is hearsay because it is offered for the truth of the matter asserted (that the testator considered himself married). Under the Dead Man's Statute, such statements by the deceased are inadmissible unless an exception applies. Since no exception is apparent, the testimony should be ruled inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.

Answer: A
