Okay, so I've got this problem about designing a compression spring. The question is about finding the wire diameter based on fatigue loading and a given factor of safety. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with springs under fatigue, the primary concern is the stress that the material undergoes due to cyclic loading. The spring goes from a minimum load to a maximum load, so the stress varies, which can lead to fatigue failure over time. The factor of safety (FS) here is 1.4, which means the design should ensure that the applied stress doesn't exceed the material's endurance limit by a certain margin.

The given loads are a minimum of 145 lbs and a maximum of 295 lbs. That means the maximum load is higher than the minimum, so the spring is being compressed beyond its mean point repeatedly. The range of load is 295 - 145 = 150 lbs. Since the spring is a compression type, the stress in the wire will vary with this load.

I think the formula for stress in a spring due to load is given by the shear stress formula for helical springs. Shear stress (τ) is calculated by τ = (8 * P * N) / (d^3 * π^2), where P is the load, N is the number of active coils, and d is the wire diameter. But wait, since the load varies, we need to consider the maximum stress, which occurs at maximum load.

Wait, but fatigue failure is about the amplitude of the stress, not the mean. So perhaps I should calculate the stress amplitude. The maximum stress (σ_max) would be based on the maximum load, and the minimum stress (σ_min) based on the minimum load. The stress amplitude (Δσ) is (σ_max - σ_min)/2. But since the minimum load is 145 lbs, which might mean that the stress doesn't go below a certain point. Alternatively, if the spring is at maximum load, the stress is highest. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the problem states that the fatigue loading is from 145 to 295 lbs. So the maximum stress would be when the load is 295 lbs, and the minimum when it's 145. So the stress varies between these two. The stress amplitude is (σ_max - σ_min)/2. But to find the endurance limit, we need to know the stress at which the spring will fail due to fatigue.

I recall that for springs made of hard-drawn wire, the endurance limit (Se) is a certain value based on the material. I think for carbon steels, which hard-drawn wire typically is, the endurance limit is around 100,000 psi for fully reversed or pulsating tension-compression cycles, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but the problem says it's a compression spring, so the stress might be in a different category. I think for pulsating compression, the endurance limit is lower, maybe 40,000 psi? Or perhaps 80,000 psi? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses the nominal stress approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor of safety is applied to the stress. The design stress should be less than the endurance limit divided by the factor of safety. So, maybe the formula is: design stress (σ_design) = σ_max / FS. Or perhaps the stress amplitude divided by FS equals the endurance limit.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the endurance limit for hard-drawn wire. I think that hard-drawn steel typically has an endurance limit around 100,000 psi for fully reversed stress, but for pulsating compression, it's a bit different. Alternatively, maybe it's better to refer to the Goodman or Gerber correction, but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Wait, let's think again. The problem states to base the factor of safety on fatigue failure. So, the maximum stress (from max load) divided by the factor of safety should be less than or equal to the endurance limit.

Wait, no, the formula for safety factor in fatigue is usually: (Stress amplitude) / (Endurance limit) = 1 / FS. Or perhaps it's (Maximum stress) / (Endurance limit) = 1 / FS. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the approach is to compute the stress at the maximum load, then divide by the factor of safety to ensure that it's below the endurance limit. So, σ_max / FS ≤ Se.

Wait, but first, I need to calculate the stress caused by the maximum load. The stress in a spring is given by τ = (8 * P * N) / (d^3 * π^2), where N is the number of active coils. But wait, the mean coil diameter is given as 0.95 inches. The number of coils (N) can be approximated as the mean diameter divided by the wire diameter (d), so N ≈ D / d, where D is 0.95 inches. So N ≈ 0.95 / d.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the number of coils in a spring is usually N = D / d, where D is the mean diameter of the coil. So yes, N = D / d = 0.95 / d.

So putting it together, the stress τ_max is (8 * P_max * N) / (d^3 * π^2). Substituting N, we get τ_max = (8 * P_max * (0.95/d)) / (d^3 * π^2) = (8 * 0.95 * P_max) / (d^4 * π^2).

But wait, I'm mixing up shear stress and axial stress. Wait, no, for a helical spring, the maximum shear stress in the wire is given by τ = (8 * P * N) / (d^3 * π^2). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as τ = (16 * P * N) / (d^3 * π^2) because of the way the load is applied. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check the formula.

Another way to write the shear stress is τ = (32 * P * N) / (d^3 * π^2). Hmm, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, the formula is τ = (8 * P * N) / (d^3 * π^2). Let me confirm: the formula for the maximum shear stress in a helical spring is τ = (8 * P * N) / (d^3 * π^2), where P is the force, N is the number of active coils, and d is the wire diameter.

So, substituting N = D / d = 0.95 / d, we have:

τ = (8 * P * (0.95 / d)) / (d^3 * π^2) = (8 * 0.95 * P) / (d^4 * π^2).

But wait, P is the load. The maximum load is 295 lbs. So, τ_max = (8 * 0.95 * 295) / (d^4 * π^2).

Wait, but wait, the shear modulus (G) is involved in shear stress, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can proceed without it because we're dealing with the endurance limit in shear stress terms.

Now, the endurance limit (Se) for the material. Since the spring is made of hard-drawn wire, which is typically made from carbon steel. For such materials, the endurance limit for pulsating compression (where the load varies between a minimum and maximum, both compressive) is often around 100,000 psi divided by the square root of the factor of safety. Wait, no, that's for fully reversed stress. Alternatively, perhaps for pulsating compression, the endurance limit is 0.5 * Sy, where Sy is the yield strength.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me look up typical values. I think that for hard-drawn wire, the endurance limit under pulsating compression is approximately 80,000 psi. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to standard tables. Alternatively, maybe the problem provides a standard endurance limit value, but since it's not given, I'll have to proceed with an assumed value.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula where the maximum stress (σ_max) is calculated, then divided by the factor of safety, and set less than the endurance limit.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor of safety is applied to the stress amplitude. So, the stress amplitude is (σ_max - σ_min) / 2. Then, σ_amplitude / (Endurance limit) = 1 / Factor of Safety.

Wait, let's try that approach.

First, calculate the stress at maximum load (σ_max) and minimum load (σ_min).

The maximum load is 295 lbs, so the stress would be higher than the minimum load of 145 lbs. So, the stress amplitude Δσ = (σ_max - σ_min)/2.

But wait, since the spring is in compression, the stress will be compressive. So, perhaps the maximum stress is σ_max = (8 * P_max * N)/(d^3 * π^2), and σ_min = (8 * P_min * N)/(d^3 * π^2). So, Δσ = (σ_max - σ_min)/2 = (8 * (P_max - P_min) * N)/(2 * d^3 * π^2) = (4 * (P_max - P_min) * N)/(d^3 * π^2).

But wait, the maximum load is 295, the minimum is 145, so the difference is 150 lbs. So, Δσ = (4 * 150 * N) / (d^3 * π^2).

But N is 0.95 / d, so substituting:

Δσ = (4 * 150 * 0.95 / d) / (d^3 * π^2) = (570) / (d^4 * π^2).

Now, the endurance limit (Se) is a material property. For hard-drawn wire, I think under pulsating compression, the endurance limit is around 80,000 psi. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's higher, like 100,000 psi, but divided by the square root of the factor of safety. Wait, no, that's for fully reversed stress.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the formula where the maximum stress (σ_max) is divided by the factor of safety and set equal to the endurance limit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact approach. Let's try to proceed.

Assuming that the maximum stress is σ_max = (8 * P_max * N)/(d^3 * π^2), and that this should be less than or equal to Se / FS.

So, σ_max = (8 * P_max * N)/(d^3 * π^2) ≤ Se / FS.

Assuming Se is 80,000 psi, and FS is 1.4.

So, (8 * 295 * N) / (d^3 * π^2) = 80,000 / 1.4.

But N = 0.95 / d.

Plugging that in:

(8 * 295 * (0.95 / d)) / (d^3 * π^2) = 80,000 / 1.4.

Simplify numerator: 8 * 295 = 2360; 2360 * 0.95 ≈ 2242.

So, 2242 / (d^4 * π^2) ≈ (80000 / 1.4) ≈ 57142.86.

Wait, but 2242 / (d^4 * π^2) ≈ 57142.86.

Rearranging: d^4 ≈ 2242 / (57142.86 * π^2).

Calculating denominator: 57142.86 * π^2 ≈ 57142.86 * 9.8696 ≈ 57142.86 * ~9.87 ≈ 564,500.

So, d^4 ≈ 2242 / 564500 ≈ 0.00397.

Taking the fourth root: d ≈ (0.00397)^(1/4).

Calculating that: 0.00397 is about 3.97e-3.

The fourth root of 1e-3 is 0.1, since (0.1)^4 = 1e-4. Wait, 0.1^4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4. So 3.97e-3 is 39.7e-3, which is 3.97e-2. Wait, no, 3.97e-3 is 0.00397.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ln(0.00397) = ln(3.97e-3) ≈ ln(4e-3) ≈ ln(4) + ln(1e-3) ≈ 1.386 + (-6.908) = -5.522.

Then, ln(d^4) = 4 ln(d) = ln(0.00397) = -5.522.

So, ln(d) = -5.522 /4 ≈ -1.3805.

Exponentiate: d ≈ e^(-1.3805) ≈ 0.252 inches.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.25 inches, which is one of the options (option G is 0.25 in).

But wait, I'm not sure if I used the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the stress amplitude instead of the maximum stress.

Let me try that approach.

Stress amplitude Δσ = (σ_max - σ_min)/2.

So, σ_max = (8 * P_max * N)/(d^3 * π^2).

σ_min = (8 * P_min * N)/(d^3 * π^2).

Δσ = (σ_max - σ_min)/2 = (8 * (P_max - P_min) * N)/(2 * d^3 * π^2) = (4 * (P_max - P_min) * N)/(d^3 * π^2).

With P_max = 295, P_min = 145, so Δσ = (4 * 150 * N)/(d^3 * π^2) = (600 * N)/(d^3 * π^2).

Again, N = 0.95 / d.

So Δσ = (600 * 0.95 / d) / (d^3 * π^2) = 570 / (d^4 * π^2).

Now, the endurance limit Se is typically the stress amplitude at which the material can endure infinite cycles. So, the design stress amplitude should be less than or equal to Se divided by the factor of safety.

So, Δσ = Se / (FS).

Assuming Se is 80,000 psi, then 570 / (d^4 * π^2) = 80,000 / 1.4 ≈ 57,142.86 psi.

So,

570 / (d^4 * π^2) = 57,142.86.

Rearranging,

d^4 = 570 / (57142.86 * π^2).

Compute denominator: 57142.86 * π^2 ≈ 57142.86 * 9.8696 ≈ 564,500.

So, d^4 ≈ 570 / 564500 ≈ 0.00101.

Wait, that's different from before. So, 0.00101.

Taking the fourth root: d ≈ (0.00101)^(1/4).

0.001 is 1e-3, so the fourth root is (1e-3)^(1/4) = (1e-1)^(1/2) = approx 0.316 inches? Wait, no, wait: 0.1^4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4. So, 1e-3 is 3.16 times larger than 1e-4, so (1e-3)^(1/4) is approximately 0.316 inches. Wait, but 0.316 is about 0.32 inches, which is option I.

But wait, that doesn't align with the previous approach. So where did I go wrong here?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let's recalculate.

57142.86 * π^2 = 57142.86 * 9.8696.

Calculating 57142.86 * 9.8696:

57142.86 * 9 = 514,285.74

57142.86 * 0.8696 ≈ 57142.86 * 0.8 = 45,714.29; 57142.86 * 0.0696 ≈ 3,971. So total ≈ 45,714.29 + 3,971 ≈ 49,685.29.

Adding to 514,285.74 gives 514,285.74 + 49,685.29 ≈ 563,971.03.

So, 570 / 563,971.03 ≈ 0.001010.

So, d^4 ≈ 0.001010.

The fourth root of 0.001010 is approximately 0.32 inches, which is option I.

But earlier, using the maximum stress approach, I got about 0.25 inches.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So which approach is correct?

I think the correct approach is to use the stress amplitude because fatigue failure is primarily influenced by the stress range (amplitude), not the mean stress. So, the stress amplitude method should be the right way.

So, with d ≈ 0.32 inches, which is option I, but wait, that's not one of the options. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are A to J. Option I is 0.32 in. So, that would be the answer.

But wait, when I calculated using the stress amplitude approach, I got d ≈ 0.32 inches, which is option I. But I'm not sure if I applied the endurance limit correctly.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the endurance limit is taken as 100,000 psi for hard-drawn wire under pulsating tension, but for pulsating compression, it's lower, perhaps 80,000 psi. Alternatively, maybe I should have used 100,000 psi divided by the square root of the factor of safety, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the stress amplitude should be divided by the factor of safety, so 570/(d^4 * π^2) = Se / FS.

If Se is 80,000 psi and FS is 1.4, then 80,000 / 1.4 ≈ 57,142.86 psi.

So,

570/(d^4 * π^2) = 57,142.86

Which gives d^4 ≈ 570 / (57,142.86 * π^2) ≈ 570 / (57,142.86 * 9.8696) ≈ 570 / 563,971 ≈ 0.00101.

Fourth root of 0.00101 is about 0.32 inches, as before.

So, the wire diameter would be approximately 0.32 inches, which is option I.

But looking at the options, option I is 0.32 in.

Wait, but when I did the maximum stress approach earlier, I got around 0.25 inches, which is option G.

But I think the correct approach is to use the stress amplitude because fatigue failure is more dependent on the amplitude than the mean stress.

So, perhaps the answer is 0.32 inches, option I.

But wait, let me cross-verify with the formula.

The correct formula for the stress amplitude in a helical spring is:

Δσ = (8 * P_amplitude * N) / (d^3 * π^2)

Where P_amplitude is (P_max - P_min)/2 = 150/2 = 75 lbs. Wait, no, no, because the stress amplitude is (σ_max - σ_min)/2, which would be based on the load difference.

Wait, no, the stress amplitude Δσ is (σ_max - σ_min)/2, and σ_max is based on P_max, σ_min on P_min.

So, perhaps the correct formula is:

Δσ = [ (8 * P_max * N)/(d^3 * π^2) ) - (8 * P_min * N)/(d^3 * π^2) ) ] / 2

Which simplifies to (8 * (P_max - P_min) * N) / (2 * d^3 * π^2) ) = (4 * (P_max - P_min) * N) / (d^3 * π^2).

So, substituting N = 0.95 / d, we get:

Δσ = 4 * 150 * 0.95 / (d^4 * π^2) = (570) / (d^4 * π^2).

Set this equal to Se / FS.

Assuming Se is 80,000 psi, and FS is 1.4, so 80,000 /1.4 ≈ 57,142.86 psi.

So,

570 / (d^4 * π^2) = 57,142.86.

Solving for d^4:

d^4 = 570 / (57,142.86 * π^2) ≈ 570 / (57,142.86 * 9.8696) ≈ 570 / 563,971 ≈ 0.00101.

So, d ≈ (0.00101)^(1/4) ≈ 0.32 inches.

So, the answer should be I: 0.32 in.

Wait, but let me check if I used the right endurance limit. Another source says that for hard-drawn wire in pulsating compression, the endurance limit is approximately 80,000 psi. But some sources might say it's lower, like 40,000 psi. If that's the case, the calculation would be different.

If Se is 40,000 psi, then:

570 / (d^4 * π^2) = 40,000 / 1.4 ≈ 28,571.43 psi.

So,

d^4 = 570 / (28,571.43 * π^2) ≈ 570 / (28,571.43 * 9.8696) ≈ 570 / 282,000 ≈ 0.00202.

d ≈ (0.00202)^(1/4) ≈ 0.28 inches, which is option C.

Hmm, this is conflicting. So, which endurance limit should I use?

I think the endurance limit for hard-drawn wire in pulsating compression is around 80,000 psi, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps for this problem, the intended approach uses a different value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the endurance limit is 100,000 psi, and the factor of safety is 1.4, so Se_design = 100,000 / 1.4 ≈ 71,428.57 psi.

Then,

570 / (d^4 * π^2) = 71,428.57.

d^4 = 570 / (71,428.57 * π^2) ≈ 570 / (71,428.57 * 9.8696) ≈ 570 / 704,000 ≈ 0.00081.

d ≈ (0.00081)^(1/4) ≈ 0.30 inches, which is option D.

Hmm, that's another possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the maximum stress (σ_max) should be less than or equal to Se / FS.

So, σ_max = (8 * P_max * N)/(d^3 * π^2) ≤ Se / FS.

Assuming Se is 80,000 psi, FS is 1.4.

So,

(8 * 295 * (0.95 / d)) / (d^3 * π^2) ≤ 80,000 / 1.4 ≈ 57,142.86.

Simplify numerator: 8 * 295 = 2360; 2360 * 0.95 ≈ 2242.

So,

2242 / (d^4 * π^2) ≤ 57,142.86.

Rearranged:

d^4 ≥ 2242 / (57,142.86 * π^2) ≈ 2242 / (57,142.86 * 9.8696) ≈ 2242 / 563,971 ≈ 0.003976.

d ≈ (0.003976)^(1/4) ≈ 0.25 inches, which is option G.

So, this approach gives 0.25 inches.

But which approach is correct? Using stress amplitude gives a larger diameter, using maximum stress gives a smaller diameter.

I think the correct approach is to use the stress amplitude because fatigue failure is more influenced by the stress range (amplitude) than the mean stress. However, sometimes the Goodman or Soderberg equations are used, which consider both mean and amplitude stress.

But perhaps in this problem, the intended approach is to use the maximum stress divided by the factor of safety and set it equal to the endurance limit.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should look for a standard formula.

Upon checking, the standard approach for fatigue in springs often uses the stress amplitude. Therefore, using the stress amplitude approach gives d ≈ 0.32 inches, which is option I.

But looking back at the options, option I is 0.32 in., which matches our calculation.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the number of cycles to failure, but that's more complicated and not needed here.

Wait, another point: the problem states that the spring is made of hard-drawn wire. Hard-drawn wire typically has an endurance limit around 80,000 psi for pulsating compression. So, using that, the stress amplitude should be less than 80,000 /1.4 ≈ 57,142.86 psi.

So,

Δσ = 570 / (d^4 * π^2) ≤ 57,142.86.

Solving for d^4:

d^4 ≥ 570 / (57,142.86 * π^2) ≈ 570 / (57,142.86 * 9.8696) ≈ 570 / 563,971 ≈ 0.00101.

d ≈ (0.00101)^(1/4) ≈ 0.32 in.

So, the correct answer is I: 0.32 in.
</think>

To determine the wire diameter for the compression spring, we analyze the fatigue loading and apply the factor of safety. The spring experiences a load range of 145 lbs (minimum) to 295 lbs (maximum), resulting in a stress amplitude. Using the formula for stress amplitude in a helical spring, the wire diameter is calculated to ensure the stress remains within the endurance limit of hard-drawn wire (80,000 psi) divided by the factor of safety (1.4). After solving, the wire diameter is found to be approximately 0.32 inches.

Answer: I
