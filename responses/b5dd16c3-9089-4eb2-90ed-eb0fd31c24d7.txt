Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the setup is that there are two electrochemical cells connected in series. Both use inert platinum electrodes. The first cell has a solution of a metal nitrate, and the second has a metal sulfate solution. After some time, 675 mg of the metal was deposited in the first cell, and 76.3 mL of hydrogen gas evolved in the second. The task is to find the equivalent weight of the metal, and there are multiple choices given.

Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, when two cells are connected in series, they essentially form a single cell with the overall cell potential. But here, each cell is a different solution: nitrate and sulfate. Wait, but both are nitrates and sulfates of the same metal? Or different metals? The problem says "the metal nitrate" and "the metal sulfate," so I think it's the same metal in both cells. That makes sense because otherwise, the problem would mention different metals.

So, the first cell is the metal nitrate solution, and the second is the metal sulfate. Since both are connected in series, the same current flows through both. The deposition of metal in the first cell would happen at the cathode, and the evolution of hydrogen in the second cell suggests hydrogen gas is being produced, likely at the anode.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the setup. In an electrochemical cell, the cell where reduction occurs is the cathode, and oxidation occurs at the anode. Since these are connected in series, the cell with lower potential will act as the anode, and the one with higher potential as the cathode.

But the problem doesn't give E° values, so maybe I don't need to calculate the cell potential. Instead, perhaps I can relate the amounts of substance deposited or evolved in each cell to the charge passed.

I remember Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The amount of substance deposited or evolved is proportional to the amount of charge (current × time) and the equivalent weight.

Faraday's first law says that the mass of a substance deposited is equal to (Q × M) / (n × F), where Q is the charge, M is molar mass, n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant. Alternatively, equivalent weight (E.W.) is mass divided by the number of equivalents, which is moles of electrons, so E.W. = M/n.

Wait, but since both cells are connected in series, the same current (and thus the same charge) passes through both. So the charge Q is the same for both cells. Let me denote Q as the total charge passed through both cells.

In the first cell (metal nitrate), metal is being deposited. That's a reduction process. So the metal ions are gaining electrons. Let's say the metal is M. Then at the cathode, M^(n+) + n e^- → M(s). The amount of metal deposited is 675 mg, which is 0.675 grams.

In the second cell (metal sulfate), hydrogen gas is evolving. That suggests that hydrogen ions are being reduced. So 2 H^+ + 2 e^- → H2(g). The volume of H2 gas is 76.3 mL at 25°C and 1 atm. I can use the ideal gas law to find the moles of H2.

The idea is to relate the charge Q to both processes. For the first cell, Q = n * F * (mass of M)/(equivalent weight of M). For the second cell, Q = F * (moles of H2) * 2, since each H2 molecule requires 2 electrons.

Wait, let's get into more detail.

First, calculate the moles of H2 gas. Using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

P is 1 atm, V is 76.3 mL = 0.0763 L. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K.

n = PV/(RT) = (1 * 0.0763) / (0.0821 * 298) ≈ (0.0763) / (24.4658) ≈ 0.00312 moles of H2.

Since each mole of H2 requires 2 moles of electrons (because 2 H+ + 2 e^- → H2), the total electrons transferred for H2 is 0.00312 * 2 = 0.00624 moles of e^-.

The charge Q is then n * F, where n is moles of electrons and F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol e^-). So Q = 0.00624 mol e^- * 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.00624 * 96485 ≈ 602.5 Coulombs.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation.

0.00624 * 96485 = let's compute:

0.00624 * 96485 ≈ (6.24e-3) * 9.6485e4 ≈ 6.24 * 9.6485 ≈ let's compute 6*9.6485=57.891, 0.24*9.6485≈2.315. So total ≈57.891 +2.315≈60.206, so 60.206, but wait, because 6.24e-3 * 9.6485e4 = 6.24 * 9.6485 = 60.206, but the exponents: 1e-3 * 1e4 = 1e1, so 60.206 * 10 = 602.06 C. So approximately 602 C.

So the charge Q is about 602 C.

Now, in the first cell, the metal is deposited. Let's say the metal has a valence of n+. The reaction is M^(n+) + n e^- → M(s). The mass deposited is 0.675 grams.

The moles of metal deposited is mass / molar mass (M). But since we're dealing with equivalents, the number of equivalents is (mass / M) * n. Alternatively, using equivalent weight (E.W.) which is E.W. = M/n.

Wait, equivalent weight is the molar mass divided by the valence (n). So E.W. = M/n.

The number of equivalents deposited is mass / E.W. Since each equivalent corresponds to one mole of electrons, the number of moles of electrons is equal to the number of equivalents.

So the charge Q is also equal to F * electrons (in moles). So for the metal deposition:

Q = n_metal * F, where n_metal is moles of electrons.

But n_metal = (mass of metal) / (E.W.) = (0.675 g) / (E.W.)

So, 0.675 g / E.W. = n_metal.

And Q = n_metal * F = (0.675 / E.W.) * F.

But we already have Q from the H2 gas, which is 602 C.

So setting them equal:

(0.675 / E.W.) * F = 602.

We can solve for E.W.:

E.W. = (0.675 * F) / 602.

We know F is approximately 96485 C/mol.

So E.W. = (0.675 * 96485) / 602.

Let me compute that.

First, 0.675 * 96485 ≈ let's compute 0.6 * 96485 = 57,891, and 0.075 * 96485 = 7,236.375. So total is 57,891 +7,236.375 = 65,127.375 C.

Then divide by 602: 65,127.375 / 602 ≈ let's see.

602 × 108 = 602 × 100 =60,200; 602 ×8=4,816 → total 65,016. That's close to 65,127.375.

So 108 ×602 =65,016. The difference is 65,127.375 -65,016=111.375.

So 111.375 /602 ≈ 0.185.

So total is approximately 108.185.

Wait, but wait, that gives E.W. ≈108.185 g/equivalent.

Looking at the options, option F is 108.2 g/equiv. So that's the answer, right?

Wait, but let me check again because I'm a bit confused about whether I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute E.W. step by step.

E.W. = (0.675 g × 96485 C/mol) / 602 C.

So 0.675 ×96485 = let's compute accurately.

0.675 ×96,485:

Compute 0.6 ×96,485 = 57,891.

0.07 ×96,485 = 6,753.95.

0.005 ×96,485 = 482.425.

Adding them up: 57,891 + 6,753.95 = 64,644.95; plus 482.425 → 65,127.375 C.

Now, 65,127.375 / 602 ≈ let me compute 602 × 108 = 65,016. Then 65,127.375 –65,016 = 111.375.

111.375 /602 ≈ 0.185.

So 108 + 0.185 = 108.185 g/equivalent.

Which is approximately 108.2 g/equivalent, which is option F.

But wait, let me check if I got the correct relation between the charge and the metal.

The charge from the metal deposition is Q = n_metal × F, and n_metal is (mass)/(E.W.).

So Q = (0.675 g / E.W.) × F.

And from H2, Q = 2 × n_H2 × F.

Wait, because for H2, each mole requires 2 moles of electrons. So n_e for H2 is 2 × n_H2.

So Q = (2 × n_H2) × F.

So equating the two Qs:

(0.675 / E.W.) × F = (2 × n_H2) × F.

We can cancel F on both sides, so:

0.675 / E.W. = 2 × n_H2.

n_H2 is moles of H2, which we found to be 0.00312 mol.

So 0.675 / E.W. = 2 × 0.00312 → 0.00624.

So E.W. = 0.675 / 0.00624.

Compute 0.675 / 0.00624.

0.675 ÷ 0.00624 → same as 675 ÷ 6.24.

Let me compute 675 ÷6.24.

6.24 × 108 = 6.24 ×100=624; 6.24×8=49.92 → total 673.92.

Which is close to 675.

So 6.24 ×108 ≈673.92 → so 675 is 673.92 +1.08, which is about 108.17.

So E.W. ≈108.17 g/equivalent, which matches option F (108.2 g/equiv).

Wait, but another thought: Did I handle the moles correctly?

Wait, in the H2 calculation, I found n_H2 = 0.00312 mol. Since each H2 molecule comes from 2 H+ ions gaining 2 electrons, the moles of electrons involved are 2 × n_H2 = 0.00624 mol.

Therefore, the charge Q is 0.00624 mol × F = 0.00624 ×96485 ≈601.8 C.

In the metal deposition, the charge is also Q = (mass of metal)/(E.W.) × F. Because E.W. = M/n, so (mass)/(E.W.) = (n × mass)/M = moles of electrons (since each M gains n electrons).

So yes, Q = (0.675 g / E.W.) × F.

Setting equal:

(0.675 / E.W.) × F = 0.00624 × F.

Cancel F:

0.675 / E.W. = 0.00624 → E.W. =0.675 /0.00624.

Which is 108.125 g/equivalent, which rounds to 108.1 or 108.2, so option F.

Hmm, looks like that's the correct approach. So the answer should be F:108.2 g/equiv.

To determine the equivalent weight of the metal, we analyze the data from the two electrochemical cells connected in series. The first cell deposits 675 mg of the metal, while the second cell evolves 76.3 mL of hydrogen gas at 25°C and 1 atm. Using Faraday's laws of electrolysis, we relate the charge passed through both cells to the mass of the metal deposited and the hydrogen gas evolved.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of hydrogen gas
Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \):
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \), \( V = 76.3 \, \text{mL} = 0.0763 \, \text{L} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), \( T = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298 \, \text{K} \).

\[
n_{\text{H}_2} = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1)(0.0763)}{(0.0821)(298)} \approx 0.00312 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Each mole of \( \text{H}_2 \) requires 2 moles of electrons, so the total moles of electrons from hydrogen evolution are:

\[
n_{\text{e}^-} = 2 \times n_{\text{H}_2} = 2 \times 0.00312 = 0.00624 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate charge \( Q \)
The charge \( Q \) is related to the moles of electrons by \( Q = n_{\text{e}^-} \times F \), where \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \):

\[
Q = 0.00624 \times 96485 \approx 602.5 \, \text{C}.
\]

### Step 3: Relate charge to metal deposition
In the first cell, the metal is deposited via the reduction:

\[
M^{n+} + n \, e^- \rightarrow M(s).
\]

The equivalent weight \( \text{E.W.} \) is defined as \( \text{E.W.} = \frac{M}{n} \), where \( M \) is the molar mass of the metal. The mass of the metal deposited is 675 mg = 0.675 g. The number of equivalents deposited is:

\[
\text{Equivalents} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{E.W.}} = \frac{0.675}{\text{E.W.}}.
\]

Since each equivalent corresponds to \( n \) moles of electrons, the total charge is:

\[
Q = \left( \frac{0.675}{\text{E.W.}} \right) \times F.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for equivalent weight
Equating the charge from both cells:

\[
\left( \frac{0.675}{\text{E.W.}} \right) \times F = 602.5.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\text{E.W.} = \frac{0.675 \times F}{602.5}.
\]

Substituting \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \):

\[
\text{E.W.} = \frac{0.675 \times 96485}{602.5} \approx 108.2 \, \text{g/equivalent}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The equivalent weight of the metal is **108.2 g/equivalent**, corresponding to option **F**.

Answer: F
