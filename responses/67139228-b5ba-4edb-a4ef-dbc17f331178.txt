Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the effect of others' presence on an individual's performance. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about social psychology. The question is asking what the presence of others does to performance, and there are several options.

I think the key concept here is the idea of social facilitation or social inhibition. From what I recall, when people are in the presence of others, they might perform tasks differently. There's this theory, maybe by Triplett or something, that says people perform better when they're being watched, especially for simple or easy tasks. But wait, isn't there a flip side? For more complex tasks, people might get distracted or anxious, leading to poorer performance.

So, looking at the options, option B says it facilitates both easy and difficult tasks. That doesn't sound right because I remember that difficult tasks might be hindered. Option D says it hinders difficult tasks, which aligns with that idea. Option E says it hinders easy tasks, which is the opposite of what I think. Option H says it facilitates easy tasks, which makes sense because being watched can make you perform better on simpler things. So maybe the effect is that presence helps easy tasks but hinders difficult ones.

Wait, the question is about the overall effect. So perhaps the presence of others generally helps with easy tasks and makes difficult ones worse. So looking at the options, option F says it increases performance on difficult tasks but decreases easy ones. No, that's the opposite. Option D is about hindering difficult tasks, which fits. So maybe the presence of others makes easy tasks better and difficult ones worse.

But the question is about the effect of the presence on an individual's performance. So the answer would be that it hinders difficult tasks, which is option D. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the presence of others has a facilitating or hindering effect overall. I think the term is social facilitation for easy tasks and social inhibition for difficult ones.

So putting it all together, the presence of others tends to help with easy tasks (facilitate) and hinder difficult tasks (inhibit). So the question is asking what the effect is. Therefore, the correct answer would be that it hinders difficult tasks, which is option D. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that it facilitates easy tasks, which is option H. But the question is phrased as the effect on the individual's performance, so it's not just about whether it's easy or difficult but the overall impact.

Wait, the options are about what the presence does in general. So if the presence of others helps easy tasks and hinders difficult ones, the overall effect isn't uniform. But the question is asking what studies show the effect is. I think the general idea is that the presence of others can have a positive effect on simple tasks and a negative effect on complex ones. So the correct answer would be that the presence hinders difficult tasks, which is option D.

Another angle: when people are in a group, they might rely on others and not perform as well as they could alone on difficult tasks, leading to a decrease in performance. That supports option D. So I think the answer is D.

The presence of others can have different effects depending on the task's difficulty. For easy tasks, being watched can enhance performance (social facilitation), while for difficult tasks, it can lead to poorer performance (social inhibition). Therefore, the effect of others' presence is to hinder the performance of difficult tasks.

Answer: D
