Okay, so I have this question about the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, and I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me start by recalling what I know about CPI.

I remember that the CPI is a measure of the average change in prices over time for a fixed basket of goods and services. It's used to track inflation. The formula for calculating the percentage change in CPI is something like [(New CPI - Old CPI) / Old CPI] multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

In this question, the CPI goes from 120 to 150. So the old CPI is 120, and the new one is 150. Let me plug these numbers into the formula. 

First, subtract the old CPI from the new: 150 - 120 = 30. Then, divide that by the old CPI: 30 / 120. Hmm, 30 divided by 120 is 0.25. To get the percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives 25%. 

Wait, so that's a 25% increase in the CPI. But the question is asking about the change in prices. Since CPI measures price levels, an increase in CPI means prices have risen. So if the CPI goes up by 25%, that means prices have risen by 25% as well.

Looking at the options, option J is "risen 25 percent." That must be the correct answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. 150 minus 120 is indeed 30. 30 divided by 120 is 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, that's right. So the prices have risen by 25%, so the answer is J.

The correct answer is J: risen 25 percent.
