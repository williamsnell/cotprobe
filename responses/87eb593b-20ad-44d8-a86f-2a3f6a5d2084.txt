Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the Ksp of calcium fluoride (CaF2) given its solubility. The solution says there's 0.00168 grams of CaF2 per 100 grams of water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on solubility products, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Ksp is the solubility product constant, which depends on the concentrations of the ions in the saturated solution. For CaF2, which dissociates into Ca²+ and F⁻ ions, the dissolution equation should be:

CaF2(s) ⇌ Ca²+(aq) + 2 F⁻(aq)

So, the Ksp expression would be Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2.

Now, I need to find the concentrations of Ca²+ and F⁻ in the solution. I'll start by calculating the molar solubility of CaF2. The given solubility is 0.00168 grams per 100 grams of water. Since the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, 100g of water is about 0.1 liters. But wait, I think it's easier to work in moles per liter because Ksp uses molarity.

First, let me find the molar mass of CaF2. Calcium (Ca) has an atomic mass of about 40.08 g/mol, and fluorine (F) is about 19.00 g/mol. So, CaF2 would be 40.08 + 2*(19.00) = 40.08 + 38.00 = 78.08 g/mol.

Next, the solubility is 0.00168 g per 100 g water. To find moles, I'll divide grams by molar mass. So, 0.00168 g / 78.08 g/mol ≈ 2.151e-5 mol. But wait, that's for 100 grams of water, which is 0.1 kg, but in terms of volume, since water's density is 1 g/mL, 100g is 0.1 L or 100 mL.

So, moles per liter would be (2.151e-5 mol) / 0.1 L = 2.151e-4 mol/L. So the solubility, S, is 2.151e-4 M.

Wait, but wait. When CaF2 dissolves, it dissociates into one Ca²+ and two F⁻ ions. So, each mole of CaF2 produces 1 mole of Ca²+ and 2 moles of F⁻. Therefore, the concentrations are:

[Ca²+] = S = 2.151e-4 M

[F⁻] = 2S = 4.302e-4 M

Now, plug these into the Ksp expression:

Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = (2.151e-4) * (4.302e-4)^2

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate (4.302e-4)^2. 4.302e-4 is 0.0004302. Squaring that gives (0.0004302)^2.

Wait, 4.302e-4 squared is (4.302)^2 * (1e-4)^2 = 18.505 * 1e-8 = 1.8505e-7? Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

4.302 * 4.302. Let's see: 4 *4 is 16, 4*0.302 is about 1.208, 0.302*4 is another 1.208, and 0.302^2 is about 0.0912. So adding them up: 16 + (1.208 +1.208) + 0.0912 = 16 + 2.416 + 0.0912 ≈ 18.5072. So, (4.302e-4)^2 is 18.5072e-8, which is 1.85072e-7.

Then, multiply by [Ca²+] which is 2.151e-4:

Ksp = (2.151e-4) * (1.85072e-7) = ?

Let me compute 2.151 * 1.85072 first. Approx: 2 * 1.85 is 3.7, 0.151 *1.85 is about 0.280. So around 3.98. But more accurately:

2.151 * 1.85072 = ?

Let me compute:

2 * 1.85072 = 3.70144

0.151 * 1.85072 = 0.151 * 1.85072.

Compute 0.1 *1.85072 = 0.185072

0.05 *1.85072=0.092536

0.001 *1.85072=0.00185072

Adding them: 0.185072 + 0.092536 = 0.277608 + 0.00185072 ≈ 0.27945872

So total is 3.70144 + 0.27945872 ≈ 3.98089872.

Now, multiply by 1e-4 and 1e-7: 1e-4 * 1e-7 = 1e-11.

So, Ksp ≈ 3.98089872e-11.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 3.98e-11. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 2.11 × 10^-8

B: 2.73 × 10^-8

C: 1.08 × 10^-8

D: 3.92 × 10^-8

E: 4.77 × 10^-8

F: 7.84 × 10^-8

G: 6.45 × 10^-8

H: 8.21 × 10^-9

I: 5.62 × 10^-8

J: 1.50 × 10^-7

Wait, none of these are around 1e-11. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Hmm, let's double-check. Maybe I messed up the moles calculation. Let me go back.

Given: 0.00168 grams of CaF2 per 100g water. Molar mass is 78.08 g/mol.

Moles = 0.00168 g /78.08 g/mol ≈ 2.151e-5 mol in 100g water. Wait, 100g water is 0.1 kg, but in terms of liters, since water density is 1g/mL, 100g is 0.1 L (100 mL). So moles per liter is 2.151e-5 mol / 0.1 L = 2.151e-4 mol/L. That's correct.

So [Ca²+] = 2.151e-4 M.

[F⁻] = 2 * 2.151e-4 = 4.302e-4 M.

Then Ksp = (2.151e-4) * (4.302e-4)^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (4.302e-4)^2. Let me compute that again.

4.302e-4 is 0.0004302. Squared: (0.0004302)^2 = (4.302)^2 * (1e-4)^2 = (18.505) * 1e-8 = 1.8505e-7.

So 2.151e-4 * 1.8505e-7 = ?

Let me compute 2.151 * 1.8505 first.

2 * 1.8505 = 3.701

0.151 * 1.8505 ≈ 0.2794.

So total ≈ 3.701 + 0.2794 ≈ 3.9804.

Now, 3.9804e-4 * 1e-7? Wait, no. Wait, 2.151e-4 is 2.151 *1e-4, and 1.8505e-7 is 1.8505 *1e-7. So multiplying them gives (2.151 *1.8505) * (1e-4 *1e-7) = 3.9804 * 1e-11 ≈ 3.9804e-11.

So Ksp ≈ 3.98e-11.

But none of the options are close to that. The options are in the range of 1e-8 to 1e-7. Did I go wrong somewhere?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar solubility. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.00168 grams per 100g water. So in 100g of water, that's 0.00168g CaF2. Molar mass is 78.08 g/mol, so moles are 0.00168 /78.08 ≈ 2.151e-5 mol.

But wait, 100g of water is 0.1 kg, but in terms of volume, since the density is 1g/mL, 100g is 100 mL, which is 0.1 L. So the concentration is moles per liter, so 2.151e-5 mol / 0.1 L = 2.151e-4 M. That seems correct.

Hmm, but then the Ksp would be around 4e-11. But none of the options are that low. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the solution is given as grams per 100 grams of solution, not per 100g of water? But the question says "per 100g of water," so I think that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the solubility in molality instead of molarity. Wait, but Ksp uses molarity, not molality. So that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should consider that the solution's volume is not exactly 100 mL because when CaF2 dissolves, it adds some volume. But for very small solubilities, the change in volume is negligible, so I think it's acceptable to ignore it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dissociation stoichiometry. Let me check: CaF2 → Ca²+ + 2 F⁻. Yes, that's correct. So each mole of CaF2 gives one mole of Ca²+ and two moles of F⁻.

So [Ca²+] = S = 2.151e-4 M.

[F⁻] = 2S = 4.302e-4 M.

So Ksp = (2.151e-4) * (4.302e-4)^2 = 2.151e-4 * (4.302e-4)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me compute (4.302e-4)^2:

4.302e-4 = 0.0004302

Squaring that: (0.0004302)^2 = 0.00000018505 (since 0.0004302 * 0.0004302 = 1.8505e-7).

So Ksp = (2.151e-4) * (1.8505e-7) = ?

Calculating 2.151e-4 * 1.8505e-7:

Multiply 2.151 * 1.8505 ≈ 3.980.

Then 1e-4 * 1e-7 = 1e-11.

So Ksp ≈ 3.980e-11.

But the options don't have anything close. The closest is H: 8.21e-9, which is much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem states 0.00168 grams per 100g of solution, not per 100g of water. That would change the calculation because the solution's volume isn't the same as the solvent's volume. But the question says "per 100g of water," so I think that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I confused grams with moles somewhere. Let me check again.

0.00168g CaF2 in 100g H2O. Molar mass 78.08 g/mol.

Moles of CaF2: 0.00168 /78.08 ≈ 2.151e-5 mol.

Concentration in 100g water (0.1 L): 2.151e-5 mol / 0.1 L = 2.151e-4 M.

So [Ca²+] = 2.151e-4 M.

[F⁻] = 2 * 2.151e-4 = 4.302e-4 M.

Ksp = (2.151e-4) * (4.302e-4)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this more accurately.

Let me compute (4.302e-4)^2:

4.302 * 4.302 = ?

4 *4 =16, 4 *0.302=1.208, 0.302*4=1.208, 0.302^2=0.091204.

So 16 +1.208 +1.208 +0.091204 = 16 + 2.416 + 0.091204 = 18.507204.

So (4.302e-4)^2 = 18.507204e-8 = 1.8507204e-7.

Now, multiply by 2.151e-4:

2.151e-4 * 1.8507204e-7 = ?

2.151 *1.8507204 ≈ let's compute accurately.

2.151 * 1.8507204.

Compute 2 *1.8507204 =3.7014408.

0.151 *1.8507204:

0.1 *1.8507204 =0.18507204.

0.05 *1.8507204 =0.09253602.

0.001 *1.8507204 =0.0018507204.

Adding these: 0.18507204 +0.09253602 =0.27760806 +0.0018507204 =0.2794587804.

So total is 3.7014408 +0.2794587804 =3.9809 (approx 3.98089958).

So, Ksp =3.98089958e-11.

But again, none of the options match. The options are way larger. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the solubility is given in grams per 100g of solution, not per 100g of water. Let me try that approach.

If it's 0.00168g per 100g of solution, the volume would be more than 100 mL because the solution has more mass due to the dissolved CaF2. But I'm not sure how much. Let's estimate.

Assume the solution is 100g, with 0.00168g CaF2 and 99.99832g water.

The molar mass of CaF2 is 78.08g/mol, so moles of CaF2: 0.00168 /78.08 ≈2.151e-5 mol.

The volume of 100g solution: since the density of water is 1g/mL, but with dissolved CaF2, the density would be slightly higher. Let's approximate the volume as roughly 100 mL (0.1 L), but the exact value might change things a bit. Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the volume more accurately.

But this seems complicated, and the options don't have a value near 4e-11. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use grams per liter instead. Let me try that approach.

Wait, 0.00168g per 100g water. So per liter of water (1000g), the amount would be 0.00168g *10 =0.0168g per liter.

Molar mass is 78.08g/mol, so moles per liter: 0.0168 /78.08 ≈ 2.151e-4 mol/L. So same as before.

Hmm, same result. So Ksp is ~4e-11. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the units were grams per kilogram instead of per 100g. Let me check.

No, the question says 0.00168g per 100g water. So that's 0.00168g in 100g water, which is 0.1 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should express the solubility as molality. But Ksp is in terms of molarity, not molality.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Ksp. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute [Ca²+] = S = 2.151e-4 M.

[F⁻] = 2S =4.302e-4 M.

So Ksp = (2.151e-4) * (4.302e-4)^2.

Let me compute each part more accurately.

Compute (4.302e-4)^2:

(4.302)^2 = 18.507204 → (4.302e-4)^2 =1.8507204e-7.

Then, multiply by 2.151e-4:

2.151e-4 *1.8507204e-7 = (2.151 *1.8507204) *1e-11.

2.151 *1.8507204 = let's calculate:

2 *1.8507204 =3.7014408.

0.151 *1.8507204:

0.1 *1.8507204=0.18507204.

0.05 *1.8507204=0.09253602.

0.001 *1.8507204=0.0018507204.

Adding these: 0.18507204 +0.09253602 =0.27760806 +0.0018507204=0.2794587804.

So total is 3.7014408 +0.2794587804 ≈3.98089958.

So Ksp ≈3.98089958e-11.

But again, the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the solubility is given as grams per liter instead of per 100g. Let me check.

If it's 0.00168g per 100g water, that's 0.0168g per liter (since 100g water is 0.1 L, so per liter it's 0.00168g *10=0.0168g/L).

Molar mass 78.08g/mol → 0.0168g/L /78.08g/mol ≈2.151e-4 mol/L, same as before.

So same result. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, the closest to my Ksp is 3.92e-8 (option D). But my calculation is 3.98e-11, which is three orders of magnitude smaller. Did I miss a decimal point somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recheck.

When I calculated (4.302e-4)^2, I got 1.8507204e-7.

Then, 2.151e-4 *1.8507204e-7 = (2.151 *1.8507204) *1e-11.

Which is 3.9808e-11.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as 3.98e-11. But none of the options match. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem says 0.00168 grams per kilogram of water, not per 100g. Let me try that.

If it's 0.00168g per 1000g water, then per 100g water, it's 0.000168g. So moles would be 0.000168g /78.08g/mol ≈2.151e-6 mol in 0.1 L, giving 2.151e-5 M. Then, Ksp would be (2.151e-5)^3 = (2.151e-5)^3 = 9.94e-15, which is even smaller. But that's not matching either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem says 0.00168g per 10g of water? Let me check.

No, the problem says per 100g of water. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dissociation. Let me think again. CaF2 dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 F⁻. So for every mole of CaF2, you get 1 mole of Ca²+ and 2 moles of F⁻. So the concentrations are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the molarity correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the solubility as the concentration in mol/L.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the molar solubility again.

0.00168g CaF2 per 100g H2O.

Molar mass is 78.08 g/mol.

Moles = 0.00168 /78.08 = 2.151e-5 mol.

Volume of solution: 100g H2O is about 0.1 L (since water's density is 1g/mL).

So molarity is 2.151e-5 /0.1 = 2.151e-4 M.

So [Ca²+] = 2.151e-4 M.

[F⁻] = 2 *2.151e-4 =4.302e-4 M.

So Ksp = (2.151e-4) * (4.302e-4)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Compute (4.302e-4)^2 = (4.302)^2 *1e-8 =18.507204e-8=1.8507204e-7.

Then, multiply by 2.151e-4:

2.151e-4 * 1.8507204e-7 = (2.151 *1.8507204) *1e-11.

2.151 *1.8507204= let's compute precisely.

2.151 *1.8507204:

Break it down:

2 *1.8507204 =3.7014408.

0.151 *1.8507204.

Compute 0.1 *1.8507204=0.18507204.

0.05 *1.8507204=0.09253602.

0.001 *1.8507204=0.0018507204.

Adding: 0.18507204 +0.09253602=0.27760806 +0.0018507204=0.2794587804.

Total:3.7014408 +0.2794587804=3.98089958.

So Ksp=3.98089958e-11.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the Ksp values for CaF2. I recall that the Ksp of CaF2 is around 3.7e-11 or similar. So my calculation seems correct. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem states 0.00168g of CaF2 per 100g of solution, not per 100g of water. Let me try that.

If it's 0.00168g per 100g solution, then the solution's mass is 100g, with 0.00168g CaF2 and 99.99832g H2O.

Molar mass of CaF2 is 78.08g/mol. So moles of CaF2: 0.00168 /78.08 ≈2.151e-5 mol.

Assuming the solution's volume is approximately 100 mL (since 100g of solution is roughly 100 mL if the density is about 1g/mL). So concentration is 2.151e-5 mol /0.1 L = 2.151e-4 M.

Same as before. So Ksp would still be ~4e-11. So same result.

I'm stuck. None of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option D is 3.92e-8. Hmm, that's three orders of magnitude larger than my result. Did I forget to cube something? No, Ksp is [Ca²+][F⁻]^2, which is (S)(2S)^2=4S^3. So if S is 2.151e-4, then 4*(2.151e-4)^3=4*(9.94e-12)=3.976e-11, which matches my earlier result.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it as 4S^3.

So S =2.151e-4.

S^3= (2.151e-4)^3= (2.151)^3 *1e-12.

2.151^3: 2 *2=4, 2*0.151=0.302, 0.151*2=0.302, 0.151^2=0.022801.

Wait, better to compute 2.151^3.

2.151 *2.151 = let's compute:

2*2=4.

2*0.151=0.302.

0.151*2=0.302.

0.151*0.151=0.022801.

So, 2.151 *2.151 =4 +0.302 +0.302 +0.022801=4 +0.604 +0.022801=4.626801.

Then, multiply by 2.151:

4.626801 *2.151 ≈ let's compute:

4 *2.151=8.604.

0.626801 *2.151 ≈ approx 0.6268 *2=1.2536, 0.6268 *0.151≈0.0946. So total≈1.2536 +0.0946≈1.3482.

So total ≈8.604 +1.3482≈9.9522.

So (2.151)^3 ≈9.9522.

So S^3=9.9522e-12.

Then, 4S^3=4*9.9522e-12=3.98088e-11, which matches earlier calculation.

So Ksp≈3.98e-11.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem states grams per liter instead of per 100g. Let me try that.

If it's 0.00168g per liter, then moles per liter would be 0.00168 /78.08 ≈2.151e-5 M. Then Ksp=4*(2.151e-5)^3=4*(9.94e-15)=3.976e-14, which is even smaller. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says 0.00168g per 10g of water. Let me see.

0.00168g per 10g water: moles=0.00168/78.08≈2.151e-5 mol in 0.01 L (10g water=0.01kg, but volume is 10 mL). So concentration is 2.151e-5 /0.01=2.151e-3 M.

Then, Ksp=4*(2.151e-3)^3=4*(9.94e-9)=3.976e-8, which is approximately 3.98e-8.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.92 × 10^-8, which is very close.

Ah! I think I see where I went wrong earlier. The problem states 0.00168g per 100g of water, which I interpreted as 0.00168g in 100g water. But perhaps I should calculate the molarity based on 100g of solution, not 100g of water. Wait, no, the problem says 0.00168g per 100g water, so the solution's volume would be a bit more than 100g, but I approximated it as 100 mL (0.1 L). But perhaps I should calculate the exact volume considering the mass of the dissolved CaF2.

Wait, but 0.00168g is negligible compared to 100g of water, so the volume change is minimal. But for accuracy, let's compute it.

Mass of solution =100g H2O +0.00168g CaF2 ≈100.00168g.

Assuming density of solution is roughly 1g/mL, the volume is approximately 100.00168 mL, which is 0.10000168 L. So moles of CaF2:2.151e-5 /0.10000168 ≈2.151e-4 /1.0000168 ≈2.15097e-4 M.

So the concentration is almost the same, so Ksp remains around 3.98e-11.

But if instead, the problem gave 0.00168g per 100g solution, then the volume would be 100g solution ≈100 mL, so concentration is 2.151e-5 /0.1=2.151e-4 M, same as before. So Ksp still around 4e-11.

But earlier, when I assumed 0.00168g per 10g water, I got Ksp≈3.98e-8, which is option D.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Problem states: "contains 0.00168g of CaF2 per 100g of water."

So, it's 0.00168g in 100g water, which is 0.1 kg, but the solution's volume is a bit more than 100 mL. But the error is negligible for such a small amount.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation when I considered 0.00168g per 10g water, I got Ksp≈3.98e-8, which matches option D.

But the problem says per 100g water, not 10g. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to give the solubility as 0.00168g per 100g solution, not water. That would change the calculation.

But without that, I can't see why the answer would be 3.92e-8. Unless I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I misplaced a decimal. Let me check the (4.302e-4)^2 again.

4.302e-4 is 0.0004302. Squared is 0.00000018505, which is 1.8505e-7. Then, 2.151e-4 *1.8505e-7 =3.9808e-11.

But if I mistakenly thought it was 1.8505e-4 instead of 1.8505e-7, that would be a problem. Let me check.

No, (0.0004302)^2 is indeed 0.00000018505, which is 1.8505e-7.

Hmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the Ksp is approximately 3.98e-11, which isn't listed. But perhaps the intended answer is option D:3.92e-8, which is three orders of magnitude higher. Maybe I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the solution is 100g water, which is 100 mL, so 0.1 L. So moles =0.00168g /78.08g/mol ≈2.151e-5 mol, concentration is 2.151e-5 /0.1 L=2.151e-4 M.

So Ksp= (2.151e-4)*(4.302e-4)^2=3.98e-11.

But perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the unit conversion and calculate grams per liter directly. Let me try that.

Wait, 0.00168g per 100g water. So for 100g water, which is 0.1 kg, but in terms of volume, 100g water is 100 mL (0.1 L). So per liter, it's 0.00168g *10 =0.0168g/L.

Molar mass 78.08g/mol → 0.0168/78.08≈2.151e-4 mol/L.

So same result. So Ksp≈3.98e-11.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use molarity based on the mass of solution, not just water. But the difference would be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem states "per 100g of solution" instead of water. If it's per 100g of solution, then the volume is 100g solution ≈0.1 L, same as before.

I'm not sure. Given that my calculation leads to 3.98e-11 and the closest option is D:3.92e-8, perhaps there's a miscalculation or a typo in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option, but I don't see a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to cube the concentration. No, Ksp is [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = S*(2S)^2=4S^3. So for S=2.151e-4, 4*(2.151e-4)^3=4*(9.94e-12)=3.976e-11.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps option D is intended, assuming a miscalculation in the problem setup.

To determine the solubility product constant (Ksp) of calcium fluoride (CaF₂), we start with the given solubility: **0.00168 g of CaF₂ per 100 g of water**. The dissociation of CaF₂ in water is represented as:

\[
\text{CaF}_2(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + 2\text{F}^-(aq)
\]

The Ksp expression is:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{F}^-]^2
\]

### Step 1: Molar Mass of CaF₂
The molar mass of CaF₂ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of CaF}_2 = 40.08 \, \text{g/mol} + 2(19.00 \, \text{g/mol}) = 78.08 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Molar Solubility of CaF₂
The solubility of CaF₂ is given as **0.00168 g per 100 g of water**. Since 100 g of water is approximately 0.1 L, the number of moles of CaF₂ in 100 g of water is:

\[
\text{Moles of CaF}_2 = \frac{0.00168 \, \text{g}}{78.08 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2.151 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mol}
\]

The molar solubility (S) in mol/L is:

\[
S = \frac{2.151 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 2.151 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Ion Concentrations
From the dissociation equation, the concentrations of the ions are:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = S = 2.151 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{F}^-] = 2S = 2(2.151 \times 10^{-4}) = 4.302 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Ksp
Substitute the ion concentrations into the Ksp expression:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{F}^-]^2 = (2.151 \times 10^{-4})(4.302 \times 10^{-4})^2
\]

First, calculate \((4.302 \times 10^{-4})^2\):

\[
(4.302 \times 10^{-4})^2 = (4.302)^2 \times (10^{-4})^2 = 18.507 \times 10^{-8} = 1.8507 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Now, multiply by \([Ca^{2+}]\):

\[
K_{sp} = (2.151 \times 10^{-4})(1.8507 \times 10^{-7}) = (2.151 \times 1.8507) \times 10^{-11}
\]

\[
K_{sp} \approx 3.98 \times 10^{-11}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated \(K_{sp}\) is approximately \(3.98 \times 10^{-11}\), but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **D: \(3.92 \times 10^{-8}\)**, which is three orders of magnitude larger. This discrepancy suggests either a miscalculation or a potential issue with the problem setup.

Given the options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: D**
