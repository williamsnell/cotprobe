Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about research methods. Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking which type of research methods are designed to elicit responses to predetermined, standardized questions from many respondents. The options are A to J, each with different method names.

First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Non-probability. Hmm, non-probability sampling is when you don't have a random chance of selecting participants, right? It's often used when you don't know the population well. But I'm not sure how this directly relates to the question about asking many standardized questions and getting responses.

Option B: Cross-sectional. Cross-sectional studies collect data from a population at a specific point in time. They're useful for seeing current trends but might not be the best for getting consistent responses to specific questions across many people because they're not necessarily representative of the population as a whole. Also, I think cross-sectional might not elicit responses from many people because it's a snapshot.

Option C: Qualitative. Qualitative research focuses on understanding the context and meanings behind people's behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. It often involves in-depth interviews or observations. I don't think qualitative methods are good for gathering responses from many people because the focus is more on interpretation and meaning than structured responses.

Option D: Ethnographic. Ethnography is about understanding a group's culture or social practices through interviews. It's descriptive and can be quite qualitative, but I'm not sure if it's used to elicit standardized responses from many people. It might be more about the process than the data itself.

Option E: Longitudinal. Longitudinal studies follow a group over time to study changes. They can provide data over periods, but I'm not sure if that's the method for getting many standardized responses. Maybe it's more about trends over time, not directly about getting responses from many people.

Option F: Experimental. Experiments involve manipulating variables to test hypotheses. They often require control groups and random assignment, which might not be the best approach for gathering responses to predetermined questions from many people. It seems more like a controlled study than one that collects data on many responses.

Option G: Probability. Probability sampling is random and allows every member of the population to have an equal chance of being selected. This method is often used in research to ensure that each participant has an equal chance of being part of the study. But how does that tie into the question of elicit responses? Maybe it's the opposite; probability methods are more about generalizing to a population, not directly about gathering responses from many people.

Option H: Observational. Observational studies observe subjects in their natural setting without intervention. They can provide data on behaviors, environments, etc., but again, I'm not sure if this is used for standardized, predetermined questions. It might be more about cause and effect or specific behaviors rather than getting responses to specific questions.

Option I: Case Study. A case study is a detailed analysis of a single case, often in a specific context. It can be qualitative and is used to understand a particular situation deeply. It might be used to gather in-depth, predetermined responses from a small group, but the question asks for many respondents. So maybe not the best fit.

Option J: Quantitative. Quantitative research focuses on numerical data and statistical analysis. It's often used to compare groups or find correlations. This method is good for getting structured, numerical responses, which aligns with the question. It's used when you can collect numerical data from many people, and you want to analyze patterns or relationships.

Putting it all together, the question asks for methods that are designed to get responses to predetermined questions from many people. So quantitative methods are the ones that collect numerical data, which allows for structured responses. Therefore, the correct answer should be J: Quantitative.

The correct answer is J: Quantitative. Quantitative research is used to gather structured, predetermined responses from many respondents through numerical data. 

Answer: J
