Question:

A resort computes its guest fees on the basis of the duration of the visit (D) , plus the amount of time spent in the steam-massage room. Tom spends 4 days at the resort and 10 hours in the steam-massage room. In a 7 day stay, Jane spends 30 hours with masseurs. Their bills are $500. and $1,125, respectively. The cost of a visit (C) is given by the following linear equation: C =xD+yH. Find the values of the constants x and y.

Options:

A: x = $100, y = $15
B: x = $75, y = $20
C: x = $90, y = $35
D: x = $70, y = $15
E: x = $125, y = $5
F: x = $50, y = $25
G: x = $85, y = $10
H: x = $60, y = $30
I: x = $40, y = $45
J: x = $20, y = $75

Okay, so I need to figure out the values of x and y in the cost equation C = xD + yH. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Tom spends 4 days at the resort and 10 hours in the steam-massage room. His bill is $500. Jane stays for 7 days and spends 30 hours with masseurs, and her bill is $1,125. Both are using the same linear equation C = xD + yH.

So, I can set up two equations based on their stays.

For Tom:
C = 500 = x*(4) + y*(10)
So, 4x + 10y = 500.

For Jane:
C = 1125 = x*(7) + y*(30)
So, 7x + 30y = 1125.

Now I have two equations:

1) 4x + 10y = 500
2) 7x + 30y = 1125

I need to solve this system of equations. Let me think about the best method. Maybe elimination would work here. Let me try to eliminate one variable.

Looking at the coefficients, if I multiply the first equation by 3, the coefficients of y would be 30 in both, which would allow me to subtract one equation from the other to eliminate y.

So, multiplying equation 1 by 3:

3*(4x + 10y) = 3*500
12x + 30y = 1500 --> equation 3.

Now, subtract equation 2 from equation 3.

Equation 3: 12x + 30y = 1500
Equation 2: 7x + 30y = 1125
Subtracting equation 2 from 3:

(12x -7x) + (30y -30y) = 1500 - 1125
5x = 375

So, 5x = 375, which means x = 375 /5 = 75.

Now that I have x=75, I can plug it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let me use equation 1: 4x + 10y = 500.

Substituting x=75:

4*(75) +10y = 500
300 +10y =500
10y =500-300=200
So y=20.

Wait, let me check if this works with Jane's equation.

Jane's equation: 7x +30y =1125.

x=75, y=20.

7*75 =525, 30*20=600. 525+600=1125. Yes, that adds up correctly.

So x is $75 and y is $20. Now I'll check the options.

Looking at option B: x=75, y=20. That's exactly what I found.

Double-checking, option B is correct. Just to confirm, let me see the other options quickly. Option D has y=15, which wouldn't fit. Option F has y=25, which would give a higher value. So yeah, B is the right choice.

The system of equations is solved by elimination. After finding x=75 and y=20, the correct option is B.
