Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the discounted price of in-line skates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The skates normally cost $110.99, and there's a 10% discount. Hmm, I think I need to calculate 10% of $110.99 and then subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price.

Wait, but wait, sometimes discounts can be tricky. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. A 10% discount means I'm paying 90% of the original price, right? So maybe another way to think about it is to multiply the original price by 0.9, which would give me the same result as subtracting 10%.

Let me try both methods to check. First, calculating 10% of $110.99. To find 10%, I can move the decimal point one place to the left, so that's $11.099. Wait, that seems a bit off because 10% of 110 is 11, so 10% of 110.99 should be a little more than 11, which makes sense. So 10% is approximately $11.099, which rounds to $11.10.

Now, subtracting that from the original price: $110.99 minus $11.10. Let's do the math. 110.99 minus 11.10. Hmm, 110 minus 11 is 99, and 0.99 minus 0.10 is 0.89, so together that's $99.89. Wait, that seems a bit low, but maybe correct.

Alternatively, using the 90% method: 110.99 multiplied by 0.9. Let me calculate that. 110 times 0.9 is 99, and 0.99 times 0.9 is 0.891. Adding those together, 99 plus 0.891 is 99.891, which rounds to $99.89. So both methods give me the same result.

Looking at the options, option D is $99.89. That must be the correct answer. Let me just quickly check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything. Option B is $98.99, which is lower than what I calculated. Option F is $99.99, which is a bit higher. So I think D is the right choice.

The discounted price is calculated by subtracting 10% of $110.99 from the original price, resulting in $99.89.
