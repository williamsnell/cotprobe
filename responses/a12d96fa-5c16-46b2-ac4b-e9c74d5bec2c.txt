Okay, so I have this question here about language development, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The sentence given is "Mommy gived me a cookie." The question is asking what this best illustrates in terms of language understanding, and the options are from A to J.

First, I should break down the sentence. The child says "gived" instead of "gave." That's a common mistake kids make. They're applying the regular past tense rule (adding "-ed") to a word that actually doesn't follow that rule in English. So "gived" is the past tense of "give," but the correct past tense is "gave," which doesn't add "-ed."

Now, I need to think about what each option means. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: prelinguistic speech. That's before language, like sounds and crying. Doesn't seem right because the child is using words.

Option B: overgeneralization. This sounds familiar. It refers to applying a general rule too broadly, even when it doesn't fit. Like using "ed" for all verbs, even irregular ones. That fits with the "gived" example.

Option C: syntax. Syntax is about sentence structure and word order. The sentence structure here is correct, so it's not about syntax. The error is in the word form, not the structure.

Option D: semantics. That's about meaning. The sentence makes sense in meaning, so it's not about semantics.

Option E: grammar. Grammar is broader, including syntax and morphology. The mistake is grammatical, but maybe it's more specific than that.

Option F: holophrases. Those are single words that convey a whole thought, like "more." The sentence here is more than a holophrase, so probably not this.

Option G: phonology. That's about the sound patterns. The child is making a mistake in the sound, but it's a morphological error, not a phonological one.

Option H: pragmatics. That's about the use of language in social contexts. The sentence isn't about that; it's about grammar.

Option I: phonemes. These are individual sounds. The child isn't mispronouncing a sound, but changing the word structure.

Option J: morphemes. These are the smallest meaningful units in language. The child is adding an extra morpheme ("ed") where it shouldn't be, so this is a morphological error.

Wait, so the question is about what the sentence illustrates in terms of understanding. The child is overgeneralizing the past tense rule, which is a morphological aspect. But the term "overgeneralization" is more about the process, whereas "morphemes" refers to the units themselves.

The question is asking what the sentence best illustrates. Since the child is applying a grammatical rule incorrectly, it's about overgeneralization in morphology. So the correct term would be overgeneralization, which is option B, or maybe E (grammar) or J (morphemes).

Wait, the options are B: overgeneralization and E: grammar. Grammar is a broader term, but the specific issue here is overgeneralization, a specific type of grammatical error.

So the sentence illustrates overgeneralization, which is B.

The sentence "Mommy gived me a cookie" demonstrates the child's overgeneralization of the past tense rule in English, applying it incorrectly to an irregular verb. This best illustrates overgeneralization.

Answer: B
