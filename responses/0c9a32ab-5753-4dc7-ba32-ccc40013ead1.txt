Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a household cleaning solution. The given hydronium ion concentration is 10^-11 M. Hmm, I remember that pH is related to the concentration of H3O+ ions, which are hydronium ions. The formula I think is pH = -log[H3O+]. 

Wait, so if the concentration is 10^-11, that's a pretty low concentration, meaning the solution is probably basic because acidic solutions have higher H+ concentrations. Let me think: pure water has a pH of 7 because [H3O+] is 1e-7. So if the concentration is 1e-11, that's even lower. Lower H+ concentration than water means the solution is basic because it's accepting protons, right?

So taking the log of 1e-11. Logarithm of 1 is 0, and since it's 10^-11, the log would be -11? Wait no, wait. Because the formula is -log[H3O+]. So if [H3O+] is 1e-11, then log(1e-11) is -11. So the negative of that would be 11. So pH is 11. 

Looking at the options, I see option H is 11 and basic, and option I is 13 and basic. Wait, why would it be 13? Oh no, wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check. [H3O+] is 1e-11. So pH equals -log(1e-11) which is 11. So the pH is 11, and since it's higher than 7, it's basic. So the correct option would be H: 11, basic. 

I think that's right. So the answer should be H.

The pH is calculated using the formula pH = -log[H3O+]. Given [H3O+] = 10^-11 M, the pH is 11. Since pH > 7, the solution is basic. 

Answer: H
