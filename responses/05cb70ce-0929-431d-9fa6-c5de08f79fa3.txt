Okay, so Anna is confused about when to use "who" and "whom" in her writing, and she wants to fix that. She's looking for a reference material to help her out. Let's think about the options she has.

First, the options are A to J, each a different type of reference material. I need to figure out which one is best for grammar rules, especially for specific word usage.

Option A is a grammar guide. I remember that grammar guides are specifically designed to explain the rules of grammar, including tricky points like "who" vs. "whom." That sounds exactly what Anna needs because she wants to correct grammatical errors.

Option B is a glossary. Glossaries are usually collections of terms related to a specific field or subject, giving brief explanations. While they can be helpful, they might not go into enough depth on usage rules for "who" and "whom."

Option C is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias cover a wide range of topics in general knowledge. They might have an entry on grammar, but they're not specialized for it, so probably not the best choice.

Option D is a style guide. Style guides focus on formatting and style conventions, like APA or MLA. While they might touch on grammar, their main purpose isn't to explain grammatical rules in depth, so maybe not the best fit here.

Option E is a concordance. Concordances are used to find the contexts of words in a text, like in a Bible or literary work. They don't explain grammar rules, so this probably isn't helpful for Anna's problem.

Option F is a bibliography. Bibliographies list sources, so they wouldn't help with grammar questions directly.

Option G is a thesaurus. A thesaurus provides synonyms and antonyms. While it's great for finding alternative words, it doesn't explain grammatical usage, so "who" vs "whom" wouldn't be addressed here.

Option H is a biography. Biographies are about people's lives, so they're unrelated to grammar help.

Option I is a dictionary. Dictionaries define words and sometimes provide parts of speech, but they might not explain when to use "who" versus "whom." They can clarify the meanings but not the usage rules in sentences.

Option J is an atlas. Atlases are maps, so they're irrelevant to grammar.

So, considering all options, the grammar guide (A) seems like the best choice because it's specifically made to address grammar rules and usage. Style guides (D) are more about formatting and style, not so much about specific grammatical errors. Dictionaries (I) can define the words, but they don't teach how to use them correctly in sentences. Therefore, the grammar guide is the most appropriate reference for Anna to correct her usage of "who" and "whom."

The best reference material for Anna to correct her confusion between "who" and "whom" is a grammar guide, as it provides detailed explanations of grammatical rules and usage.
