Alright, so I'm trying to figure out when the current Dalai Lama was born. I know the Dalai Lama is a significant religious and political figure from Tibet, and the current one is Tenzin Gyatso. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I'll need to think this through carefully.

First, I remember that the Dalai Lama has been in the news for a long time, especially regarding the situation in Tibet. I think the current Dalai Lama is the 14th in line. I'm trying to recall his birth year. I'm pretty sure he was born in the mid-20th century, maybe around the 1950s or 1960s.

Let me go through the options. The choices are from 1900 to 2000, in increments of 10 or 15 years. The options are A:1955, B:1985, C:1975, D:1990, E:2000, F:1965, G:1900, H:1925, I:1940, J:1935.

I think the Dalai Lama was born in 1935. Wait, no, that can't be right because 1935 would make him quite old, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, was it 1950? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I remember hearing that he was born in 1935, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me think about other sources. I recall that he's been active since the 1950s, so if he was born in 1935, that would make him about 20 in the late '50s. That seems plausible.

Wait, another thought: I think he was born in Tibet in 1935, and he's the 14th Dalai Lama. He was recognized as such when he was a child, I believe around the age of two or three. So, if he was born in 1935, he would have been recognized in the early 1930s. That makes sense because the 13th Dalai Lama had died in 1933, so the search for the 14th would have started after that.

Looking at the options again, J is 1935. So, that seems to fit. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes these dates can be tricky. Alternatively, I've heard that he was born in 1950, but that doesn't match any of the options except A:1955, which is close. Wait, no, 1950 isn't an option. So perhaps 1935 is the correct one.

Another angle: I think the Dalai Lama has been in exile since 1959, when he fled Tibet during the Chinese invasion. If he's been in exile for over 60 years, his birth year would have to be in the early mid-20th century. So 1935 would make him 85 or older, which is possible. Alternatively, if he was born in 1955, he'd be about 65, which is still possible, but I think I've heard he's older than that.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to remember any specific events. I think he was born on July 6, 1935. That's a date I've heard before. So that would make option J:1935 the correct answer. Therefore, the answer should be J.

The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was born on July 6, 1935. This makes option J the correct answer.

Answer: J
