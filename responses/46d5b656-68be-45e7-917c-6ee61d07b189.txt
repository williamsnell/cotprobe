Okay, so I have this question about jumper cables and the color that designates the negative connector. Hmm, I remember that jumper cables are those thick cables you use to jump-start a car when it's dead. They usually have two big clamps, one red and one black, I think. 

Wait, but why are they different colors? Oh right, because one is positive and the other is negative. I've heard that red is often the positive terminal, and black is negative. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about car batteries. Car batteries have a positive and negative terminal. The positive one is usually marked with a plus sign and might be red, while the negative is a minus and could be black. 

So, when using jumper cables, you connect the red clamp to the positive terminal of both batteries and the black to the negative. That makes sense because you don't want to mix them up, as that could cause a short circuit or other issues. 

I'm trying to recall if there are other colors used. Sometimes I see other colors on wires, like green or yellow, but those are usually for different purposes, like grounding or power lines. In the context of jumper cables, it's almost always red and black. 

So, the options given are A through J, with C being black. That must be the answer because black is the standard color for the negative connector in jumper cables.
