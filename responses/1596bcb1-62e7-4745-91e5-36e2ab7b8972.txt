Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation, and I'm trying to figure out the book value of a bus after two years. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the company bought the bus for $40,000. They're depreciating it on a straight-line basis over five years. I remember that straight-line depreciation means the cost minus the salvage value is divided equally over the useful life. But wait, the problem doesn't mention a salvage value. Hmm, I think in such cases, sometimes salvage value is assumed to be zero unless stated otherwise. So I'll go with that assumption.

So the formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value) / Life. Here, that would be ($40,000 - $0) / 5 years = $8,000 per year depreciation.

Now, each year, the bus loses $8,000 in value. After the first year, the depreciation is $8,000, so the book value would be $40,000 - $8,000 = $32,000. In the second year, another $8,000 comes off, so $32,000 - $8,000 = $24,000. 

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, I can calculate the book value directly. The book value after n years is equal to the original cost minus (depreciation per year * n). So after 2 years, that's 2 * $8,000 = $16,000 depreciation. Subtracting that from $40,000 gives $24,000. 

Looking at the options, F is $24,000. So that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Straightforward calculation, no salvage value, so yes, $24,000 after two years.

The bus is depreciated at $8,000 annually. After two years, the total depreciation is $16,000. Subtracting this from the original cost gives a book value of $24,000.

Answer: F
