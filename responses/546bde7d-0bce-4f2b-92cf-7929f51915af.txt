Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages, and I need to figure out what the eighth number is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the mean of 7 numbers is 15. Hmm, I remember that the mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are. So if the mean is 15 for 7 numbers, I can find the total sum of those 7 numbers by multiplying the mean by the count. That would be 15 times 7. Let me calculate that: 15 * 7 is 105. So the sum of the first seven numbers is 105.

Now, when an eighth number is added, the mean decreases to 12. Wait, the mean goes down to 12 with 8 numbers. So I need to find the new total sum after adding that eighth number. Again, mean is total sum divided by the number of numbers. So the new mean is 12, and there are 8 numbers now. So the total sum would be 12 * 8. Let me do that math: 12 * 8 is 96. So the sum after adding the eighth number is 96.

Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense. If I add another number and the sum goes down from 105 to 96, that means the eighth number must be negative, right? Because adding a negative number would decrease the total sum. Let me check that again. So before adding the eighth number, the sum was 105. After adding it, the sum is 96. So the eighth number must be 96 minus 105. Let me subtract: 96 - 105 is... that's -9. So the eighth number is -9.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The first sum is 7*15=105. After adding the eighth number, the sum is 8*12=96. So the eighth number is 96 - 105 = -9. Yep, that seems right. So looking at the options, B is -9. So the answer should be B.

The mean of 7 numbers is 15, so their total sum is 7 × 15 = 105. When an 8th number is added, the mean becomes 12, so the new total sum is 8 × 12 = 96. The 8th number is 96 − 105 = −9.

Answer: B
