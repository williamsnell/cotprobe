Okay, so I need to find the power factor of a circuit given the meter readings. Let me think about what each meter represents and how they relate to power factor.

The ammeter reads 0.15 amperes. That's the current flowing through the circuit, right? So I can note that as I = 0.15 A.

The voltmeter reads 115 volts. That's the voltage across the circuit, so V = 115 V.

The wattmeter reads 15.9 watts. The wattmeter measures the power, so P = 15.9 W.

Power factor (PF) is the ratio of real power (measured in watts) to apparent power. Apparent power (S) is calculated using the formula S = V * I. So first, I should calculate the apparent power.

Let me compute S: S = V * I = 115 V * 0.15 A. Let me do that multiplication. 115 times 0.15. Hmm, 100 * 0.15 is 15, and 15 * 0.15 is 2.25, so total is 17.25. So S = 17.25 VA.

Now, power factor is P/S, which is 15.9 W / 17.25 VA. Let me calculate that. 15.9 divided by 17.25.

Let me see, 17.25 goes into 15.9 how many times. Wait, 17.25 is larger than 15.9, so it's less than 1. Let me compute 15.9 ÷ 17.25.

Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to avoid decimals: 1590 / 1725. Let me simplify this fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 15, I think. 1590 ÷15=106, 1725 ÷15=115. So now it's 106/115. Let me divide 106 by 115.

106 ÷ 115 ≈ 0.9217. So approximately 0.92. Let me check if that makes sense.

Wait, looking at the options, I see option I is 0.92. But wait, another approach: sometimes power factor is calculated as cos(theta), where theta is the phase angle. Alternatively, PF = P/(V*I). So using the given values, that's 15.9/(115*0.15) = 15.9/17.25 ≈ 0.9217, which rounds to 0.92. So the power factor is approximately 0.92, which is option I.

The power factor is calculated by dividing the real power (15.9 W) by the apparent power (115 V * 0.15 A = 17.25 VA), resulting in approximately 0.92. 

Answer: I
