Okay, so I have this question about government financial statements, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking which financial statements require a statement of cash flows. The options are from A to J, each representing a different type of financial statement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that government accounting has a few different fund structures.

First, I recall that governments use fund accounting to track various resources. The main types of funds I remember are governmental funds, proprietary funds, fiduciary funds, and maybe some others like special purpose funds. 

The statement of cash flows is a financial statement that shows how cash has been generated and used by an entity. For governments, I think it's part of the financial reporting model. There's something about government-wide statements versus fund statements.

Wait, I think the statement of cash flows is included in the government-wide financial statements, not just the fund statements. Governmental funds themselves, like the general fund, produce their own statements, but those are more about the fund's own cash flows, perhaps. Or maybe the government-wide statements compile information from all funds.

I also remember that the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) requires certain statements. For governments, they have both fund financial statements and government-wide financial statements. The government-wide statements include the statement of net position (like a balance sheet) and the statement of activities (similar to an income statement), plus the statement of cash flows.

So looking at the options, H is "Government-wide financial statements." That seems to be the correct answer because only the government-wide statements would include the statement of cash flows as a separate statement. The fund financial statements, like governmental funds, might not include a separate cash flow statement but instead present their cash flows within their own statements.

Let me double-check the options. Option H is indeed government-wide. The other options are specific types of funds or other entities. For example, A is corporate, which isn't government. B is governmental funds, which I think don't have a separate cash flow statement. I is proprietary funds, which are more like internal businesses, but again, the cash flow statement is part of the government-wide set.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is H.

The correct answer is H: Government-wide financial statements.

The statement of cash flows is included in the government-wide financial statements, which encompass all funds and activities of a government entity. These statements provide a comprehensive view, including the statement of cash flows, as required by accounting standards.

Answer: H
