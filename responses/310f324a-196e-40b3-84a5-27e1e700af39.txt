Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the interest Paul has to pay on a loan. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says it's a 60-day loan for $823 at 4% per year, and they want the interest computed using the exact time method. I remember that exact time method usually means using a 365-day year, as opposed to the approximate 360-day method sometimes used. So that's good to note.

I think the formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t. Where P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. So I need to convert the 60 days into a fraction of a year.

Since there are 365 days in a year, 60 days would be 60/365. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 365. Hmm, 60 ÷ 365. Well, 365 divided by 60 is about 6.0833, so 60/365 is approximately 0.16438 years. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 60/365 is actually around 0.16438, which is about 16.438% of a year. That makes sense because 60 days is roughly a fifth of a year, and 1/5 is 0.2, so 0.164 is close.

Now, the rate is 4% per year, which is 0.04 as a decimal. So putting it all into the formula: I = 823 * 0.04 * (60/365). Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate 823 multiplied by 0.04. 823 * 0.04 is 32.92. That's because 800*0.04 is 32, and 23*0.04 is 0.92, so together it's 32.92.

Next, I need to multiply that by the time factor, which is 60/365. So 32.92 multiplied by (60/365). Let me compute 60 divided by 365 first. That's approximately 0.16438.

So 32.92 * 0.16438. Let me do this multiplication. 

32.92 * 0.16438: Let's break it down.

First, 32 * 0.16438 = 5.25976.

Then, 0.92 * 0.16438 = approximately 0.1514656.

Adding those two together: 5.25976 + 0.1514656 ≈ 5.4112256.

So the interest would be approximately $5.41. Looking at the options, I see option I is $5.41. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way to compute 32.92 * (60/365). Alternatively, maybe I can compute 32.92 * 60 first and then divide by 365.

32.92 * 60 = 1975.2.

Then divide by 365: 1975.2 ÷ 365. Let's see, 365 * 5 = 1825, so 1975.2 - 1825 = 150.2 left. 150.2 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.411. So total is 5 + 0.411 = 5.411, which is about $5.41. So that confirms it.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I is $5.41. So that should be the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me check if I used the right method. Since it's exact time, 365 days, yes, that's correct. So yes, I think I did this right.

The interest is calculated using the formula I = P * r * t, where P = $823, r = 4% (0.04), and t = 60/365 years. This results in an interest of approximately $5.41.
