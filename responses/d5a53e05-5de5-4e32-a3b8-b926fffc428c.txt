Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an automobile accelerating from rest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking for the velocity at the end of 10 seconds and the distance covered during that time. The options are given from A to J, but I need to work it out myself.

First, I remember that when a force is applied to an object, it causes acceleration, and acceleration relates to changes in velocity over time. The problem gives me the mass of the automobile as 50 slugs. Oh wait, slugs are the unit of mass in the English system, right? And force is in pounds (lb). So that makes sense.

The force equation is given as the sum of forces F = F₀ - kt, where F₀ is 200 lb and k is 10 lb/sec. This force is acting over time t in seconds. Since F equals mass times acceleration (F=ma), I can find the acceleration by dividing the force by the mass.

But wait, the force changes with time, so acceleration isn't constant. That means I can't just use the simple equations for constant acceleration. Instead, I need to integrate acceleration over time to find velocity and then integrate velocity to find distance.

Let me write down the steps I need to take:

1. Find acceleration as a function of time, a(t).
2. Integrate a(t) from t=0 to t=10 to find the velocity at t=10.
3. Integrate the velocity function from t=0 to t=10 to find the distance covered.

Starting with step 1: a(t) = F(t)/m = (F₀ - kt)/m. Plugging in the numbers, that's (200 - 10t)/50. Simplifying that, 200/50 is 4, and 10/50 is 0.2, so a(t) = 4 - 0.2t.

Now, step 2: velocity is the integral of acceleration with respect to time. The initial velocity is zero because it starts from rest. So the integral of a(t) dt from 0 to 10 should give me the final velocity.

The integral of (4 - 0.2t) dt is 4t - 0.1t². Evaluating this from 0 to 10: at t=10, it's 4*10 - 0.1*(10)^2 = 40 - 0.1*100 = 40 - 10 = 30. So the velocity at 10 seconds is 30 ft/s? Wait, no, that doesn't match any of the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Hmm, a(t)= (200 -10t)/50 = 4 - 0.2t. Integral is correct. 4t - 0.1t². At t=10: 4*10=40, 0.1*(10)^2=10, so 40-10=30. But none of the options have 30 ft/s. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the units. Oh wait, slugs and lb are in the English system. Let me confirm: 1 slug is the mass that accelerates at 1 foot per second squared when a force of 1 pound is applied. So F = m*a => a = F/m. So yes, the approach is correct.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the velocity is 30 ft/s, but none of the options have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the force equation.

The force is F(t) = F₀ - kt = 200 - 10t lb. Mass m=50 slugs. So a(t) = (200 -10t)/50 = 4 - 0.2t ft/s². That seems right.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the car is accelerating, so integrating gives the velocity correctly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration limits or the integration itself. Let me recheck the integral:

∫ (4 - 0.2t) dt from 0 to 10:

The integral is 4t - 0.1t². At t=10, that's 4*10 =40, 0.1*(10)^2=10. So 40-10=30. At t=0, it's 0. So the velocity is 30 ft/s. But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I missed a step in the integration. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I should check if the force changes sign. Because if F becomes negative, the acceleration would become negative, which would mean deceleration. Let's see when the force becomes zero.

Set F(t)=0: 200 -10t = 0 → t=20 seconds. But the time given is only up to 10 seconds, so the force is still positive. So the car is accelerating (but the acceleration is decreasing over time because the force is decreasing).

Wait, but according to my calculation, the velocity is 30 ft/s, which isn't in the options. Am I missing something else? Let me look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the force is F(t) = F₀ - k t, but perhaps I should consider that the acceleration is a(t) = (F₀ - k t)/m. That part seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the integral correctly. Wait, let me compute the integral again. The integral of a(t) from 0 to 10 is ∫₀^10 (4 - 0.2t) dt.

Calculating that:

∫4 dt from 0 to10 is 4*10=40.

∫0.2t dt from 0 to10 is 0.1 t² evaluated at 10: 0.1*(100)=10.

So total integral is 40 -10=30 ft/s. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should also compute the distance covered. The distance is the integral of velocity from 0 to10.

Velocity v(t) is 4t -0.1 t². So integrating v(t) from 0 to10:

∫ (4t -0.1 t²) dt from 0 to10.

The integral is 2t² - (0.1/3) t³. At t=10: 2*(100)=200, (0.1/3)*1000= (0.1 *1000)/3 ≈ 100/3 ≈33.333. So 200 -33.333 ≈166.666 ft.

Wait, that would make the distance about 166.666 feet. But looking at the options, J is 166 (2/3) ft, which is 166.666... So the velocity is 30 ft/s, distance is ~166.666 ft. But looking back at the options, option J is "166 (2/3) f" which probably is 166.666 ft. But wait, what's the first part of option J? It says "166 (2/3) f", but the velocity would be 30 ft/s, which isn't in the options. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check everything again.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the velocity and distance correctly. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, F(t) = 200 -10t lb. Mass m=50 slugs. So a(t)= (200-10t)/50 = 4 - 0.2t ft/s².

Velocity v(t) is the integral of a(t) from 0 to t, so:

v(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(4 -0.2t) dt =4t -0.1 t² + C. At t=0, v=0, so C=0. So v(t)=4t -0.1 t².

At t=10, v=4*10 -0.1*(10)^2 =40 -10=30 ft/s.

Now, the distance s(t) is the integral of v(t) from 0 to10:

s(t)= ∫v(t) dt = ∫(4t -0.1 t²) dt =2t² - (0.1/3) t³ + C. At t=0, s=0, so C=0.

So s(10)=2*(10)^2 - (0.1/3)*(10)^3 =2*100 - (0.1/3)*1000 =200 - (100/3) ≈200 -33.333=166.666 ft.

Looking back at the options, option J is "166 (2/3) f", which is 166.666 ft, and the velocity is 30 ft/s. But none of the options have 30 ft/s. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the force equation. Let me check the problem statement again. It says the resultant force is F₀ -kt, which is correct. F₀=200 lb, k=10 lb/sec. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the mass. The problem says 50 slugs. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the force is in the opposite direction? No, because F(t) is positive as long as t<20, which it is in this case.

Wait, maybe I should check the units again. Let me make sure that the acceleration is in ft/s². Since F is in lb, and m is in slugs, a=F/m is correct in ft/s².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me recompute:

v(t) = ∫(4 -0.2t) dt =4t -0.1 t².

At t=10: 4*10=40, 0.1*(10)^2=10, so 40-10=30 ft/s.

s(t)= ∫v(t) dt= ∫(4t -0.1 t²) dt=2t² - (0.1/3) t³.

At t=10: 2*(10)^2=200, (0.1/3)*(10)^3= (0.1 *1000)/3= 100/3≈33.333. So 200-33.333≈166.666 ft.

So the velocity is 30 ft/s and distance is approximately 166.666 ft.

Looking at the options, option J is "166 (2/3) f" which is 166.666 ft, but the velocity part is missing. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 120 ft/s, 1000 ft

B: 200 f → probably cut off

C: 130 ft/s,900 ft

D: 180 f → cut off

E:175 ft/s,1150 ft

F:145 ft/s,1100 ft

G:150 f → cut off

H:190 ft/s,950 ft

I:160 ft/s,1200 ft

J:166 (2/3) f → possibly velocity is missing, but perhaps it's a typo.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

Oh wait, perhaps the options are listed as velocity first, then distance. So option J is 166 (2/3) ft/s and some distance, but the way it's written is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to select the answer where the velocity is 30 ft/s and distance is 166.666 ft, but that's not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should consider that the force is F(t) = F₀ -k t, so the acceleration is a(t) = (200 -10t)/50 =4 -0.2t.

But wait, maybe I should use the work-energy principle. The work done by the force is the integral of F(t) dx from x=0 to x=s. The work done equals the change in kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv².

But that might be more complicated because I need to express x as a function of time. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate F(t) to a(t), then integrate as I did before.

Wait, maybe I should check if the problem is in imperial units. Oh yes, it's in ft and lb, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance. Let me compute s(10) again.

s(t)=2t² - (0.1/3) t^3.

At t=10: 2*(10)^2=200.

(0.1/3)*(10)^3 = (0.1 * 1000)/3 =100/3 ≈33.333.

So 200 -33.333≈166.666 ft.

So the distance is approximately 166.666 ft, which is 166 and 2/3 ft, matching option J for the distance part. But the velocity part is 30 ft/s, which isn't in any option. So perhaps I misread the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option J: 166 (2/3) f

Hmm, perhaps the first part is 166.666 ft/s, but that doesn't make sense because we calculated 30 ft/s. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the velocity again. Let me integrate a(t)=4 -0.2t from 0 to10.

Integral is 4t -0.1 t². At t=10: 40 -10=30. That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot that the car is starting from rest, so initial velocity is zero. So the integral is correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is to find the average force or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the force is given as F(t)=F₀ -k t, but maybe I should consider that the force is in the opposite direction after a certain time, but in this case, at t=10, F=200-10*10=100 lb, which is still positive. So no issue.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity and distance again, but maybe I made a mistake in the integration.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the equation for velocity under variable acceleration.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Since a(t)=dv/dt=(200 -10t)/50=4-0.2t.

Separating variables: dv = (4 -0.2t) dt.

Integrate both sides from v=0 to v=v(t) and t=0 to t.

So v(t)= ∫(4 -0.2t) dt from 0 to t =4t -0.1 t².

At t=10, v=4*10 -0.1*100=40-10=30 ft/s.

Same result.

Distance: s(t)= ∫v(t) dt from 0 to10= ∫(4t -0.1 t²) dt=2t² - (0.1/3)t^3.

At t=10: 2*100=200, (0.1/3)*1000=100/3≈33.333. So s=200-33.333≈166.666 ft.

So the velocity is 30 ft/s, distance is 166.666 ft. But looking at the options, only option J mentions 166.666 ft, but the velocity part is missing. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the mass is given as 50 kg, but no, the problem says 50 slugs. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the force is given as F(t)=F₀ -k t, but perhaps I should use the equation F=ma correctly. Let me check:

F(t)=ma(t) → a(t)=F(t)/m=(200-10t)/50=4-0.2t. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the force is in pounds, which is a unit of force, not mass. So F=ma → a=F/m, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the acceleration is in ft/s², which it is.

So I'm confident that the velocity is 30 ft/s and distance is 166.666 ft. But looking at the options, none have 30 ft/s. The closest is option J, which mentions 166 (2/3) ft, but the velocity isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, and option J is supposed to have 30 ft/s and 166.666 ft, but it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the force is F(t)=F₀ -k t, but maybe I should have considered that the car is subject to other forces, but the problem states that the resultant force is F(t), so that's the net force.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity and distance numerically again to see if I made any calculation errors.

Calculating velocity:

v(t)=4t -0.1 t².

At t=10: 4*10=40, 0.1*(10)^2=10 → 40-10=30 ft/s.

Distance:

s(t)=2t² - (0.1/3) t^3.

At t=10: 2*(10)^2=200, (0.1/3)*1000=100/3≈33.333 → 200-33.333≈166.666 ft.

So I'm confident in these results, but they don't match any of the options provided. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem.

Wait, the problem says the automobile accelerates from rest. So initial velocity is zero, which I accounted for.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the force is given as F(t)=F₀ -k t, but perhaps I should consider the impulse-momentum theorem. The change in momentum is the integral of F(t) dt from 0 to10.

Impulse J=∫F(t) dt from 0 to10 = ∫(200-10t) dt =200t -5t² evaluated from 0 to10 →200*10 -5*100=2000-500=1500 lb·s.

Momentum change = Δp = mΔv → m(v - 0) =1500 →50*v=1500 →v=30 ft/s. That confirms the velocity is 30 ft/s.

So the distance must be 166.666 ft, which is approximately 166.67 ft. So the only option that mentions this is J, but it's unclear if it's paired with 30 ft/s.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option J: 166 (2/3) f

The way it's written seems incomplete. Perhaps it's supposed to be 166 (2/3) ft, and the velocity is 30 ft/s, but since the options don't pair them, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the force is given as F(t)=F₀ -k t, but maybe the units are different. Let me confirm:

F₀=200 lb, k=10 lb/sec, t in seconds. Mass is 50 slugs. So a(t)= (200-10t)/50=4-0.2t ft/s².

Everything seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the integration for distance. Let me compute s(10) again:

s(t)= ∫v(t) dt= ∫(4t -0.1 t²) dt from 0 to10.

Integral is 2t² - (0.1/3)t³.

At t=10: 2*(10)^2=200, (0.1/3)*(10)^3= (0.1 *1000)/3=100/3≈33.333. So s=200-33.333≈166.666 ft.

Yes, that's correct.

Since none of the options match, but option J has 166 (2/3) ft, perhaps that's the intended answer, and the velocity is 30 ft/s, which isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the force is F(t)=F₀ -k t², but the problem says kt, not t². So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the average force. The average force would be (F₀ + F(10))/2 = (200 + (200-10*10))/2=(200+100)/2=150 lb. Then average acceleration would be 150/50=3 ft/s². Then velocity would be a_avg * t=3*10=30 ft/s, which matches. And distance would be 0.5*a_avg*t²=0.5*3*100=150 ft. But that's not matching the 166.666 ft. So that approach doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I should use the work-energy principle. The work done by the force is ∫F dx from x=0 to x=s. But since F is a function of time, and dx = v(t) dt, this becomes ∫F(t) v(t) dt from 0 to10. But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, the work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy: Work = (1/2)mv².

But since F(t)=ma(t), and a(t)=dv/dt, perhaps integrating F dx = m a dx = m v dv.

So ∫F dx = ∫m v dv.

Which gives ∫(200-10t) dx = ∫m v dv.

But since dx = v dt, ∫(200-10t) v(t) dt = ∫m v² dt.

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, since F=ma, and a = dv/dt, perhaps it's better to stick with the previous method.

I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the velocity is 30 ft/s and distance is 166.666 ft. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity and distance again, but in a different way. Let me try to compute the distance again.

s(t) = ∫v(t) dt from 0 to10.

v(t)=4t -0.1 t².

So s(t)= ∫(4t -0.1 t²) dt =2t² - (0.1/3)t³.

At t=10:

2*(10)^2=200.

(0.1/3)*(10)^3= (0.1 *1000)/3=100/3≈33.333.

So s=200-33.333≈166.666 ft.

I think I'm correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option J, which mentions 166 (2/3) ft, but the velocity isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misprinted.

But looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me check the mass again: 50 slugs. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem uses the metric system, but no, it's in pounds and slugs, so it's imperial.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct velocity is 30 ft/s and distance is 166.666 ft, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake, but I can't find where. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance using the average velocity. The average velocity would be (v_initial + v_final)/2 = (0 +30)/2=15 ft/s. Then distance=15*10=150 ft. But that doesn't match either.

Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate the distance using another method. Let me compute s(t)= ∫v(t) dt from 0 to10.

v(t)=4t -0.1t².

So s(t)= ∫(4t -0.1 t²) dt= 2t² - (0.1/3)t³.

At t=10: 2*(10)^2=200, (0.1/3)*(10)^3=100/3≈33.333. So 200-33.333≈166.666 ft.

I think I'm correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option J, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in fractions, so 166 2/3 ft.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "distance covered in this time." So the correct answer is 30 ft/s and 166.666 ft. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct choice is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps the force is given as F(t)=F₀ -k t². Let me check the problem again. No, it's F₀ -k t.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on my calculations is velocity 30 ft/s and distance 166.666 ft, which isn't listed. But since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option J, which mentions 166 (2/3) ft, but the velocity isn't listed. Maybe the velocity is 166 (2/3) ft/s, but that doesn't make sense because the units don't match.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I should compute the distance using the velocity function and average velocity. Let me compute the average velocity during the 10 seconds.

v_avg = (v_initial + v_final)/2 = (0 +30)/2=15 ft/s.

Then distance=15 *10=150 ft. But that doesn't match the 166.666 ft I calculated earlier. So that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I should use the trapezoidal rule to estimate the area under the velocity curve. Let's see:

At t=0, v=0.

At t=10, v=30.

The velocity function is v(t)=4t -0.1t².

The area under v(t) from 0 to10 is s(t)= ∫v(t) dt=166.666 ft.

But perhaps using trapezoidal rule with intervals would give a better approximation, but I think that's unnecessary since the integral is exact.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculations, the correct answer is velocity 30 ft/s and distance 166.666 ft. Since the options don't have this, but option J mentions 166 (2/3) ft, I'll assume that's the intended answer, even though the velocity part is missing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, but I can't find where.

The problem involves an automobile of mass 50 slugs accelerating from rest with a resultant force given by \( \sum F = F_0 - kt \), where \( F_0 = 200 \, \text{lb} \), \( k = 10 \, \text{lb/sec} \), and \( t \) is time in seconds. The goal is to find the velocity at the end of 10 seconds and the distance covered during this time.

### Key Steps and Calculations:

1. **Force and Acceleration**:  
   The force equation is \( F(t) = 200 - 10t \, \text{lb} \). Using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), the acceleration is:  
   \[
   a(t) = \frac{F(t)}{m} = \frac{200 - 10t}{50} = 4 - 0.2t \, \text{ft/s}^2
   \]

2. **Velocity Calculation**:  
   Velocity is the integral of acceleration:  
   \[
   v(t) = \int a(t) \, dt = \int (4 - 0.2t) \, dt = 4t - 0.1t^2 + C
   \]  
   Since the car starts from rest (\( v(0) = 0 \)), \( C = 0 \). Thus:  
   \[
   v(t) = 4t - 0.1t^2
   \]  
   At \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   v(10) = 4(10) - 0.1(10)^2 = 40 - 10 = 30 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]

3. **Distance Calculation**:  
   Distance is the integral of velocity:  
   \[
   s(t) = \int v(t) \, dt = \int (4t - 0.1t^2) \, dt = 2t^2 - \frac{0.1}{3}t^3 + C
   \]  
   Since \( s(0) = 0 \), \( C = 0 \). Thus:  
   \[
   s(t) = 2t^2 - \frac{0.1}{3}t^3
   \]  
   At \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   s(10) = 2(10)^2 - \frac{0.1}{3}(10)^3 = 200 - \frac{100}{3} \approx 200 - 33.333 = 166.666 \, \text{ft}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The velocity at the end of 10 seconds is \( 30 \, \text{ft/s} \), and the distance covered is approximately \( 166.666 \, \text{ft} \) (or \( 166 \frac{2}{3} \, \text{ft} \)).

Given the options, the distance matches option **J** (\( 166 \frac{2}{3} \, \text{ft} \)), but the velocity \( 30 \, \text{ft/s} \) is not explicitly listed. Assuming the problem intends to highlight the distance, the correct answer is:

**J: 166 (2/3) ft**
