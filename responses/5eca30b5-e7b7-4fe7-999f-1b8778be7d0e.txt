Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Erich Fromm. The question says that Fromm states society prevents people from realizing their true nature, which is to be loving, creative, and productive. The question is asking which response to societal demands allows a person to realize that true nature. The options are A through J, each with different terms like authoritative, productive, destructive, etc.

First, I need to recall what I know about Erich Fromm. Fromm was a psychologist and philosopher known for his work on the concept of love, particularly in his book "The Art of Loving." He also wrote about the escape from freedom, where he discussed how individuals might avoid freedom and responsibility by conforming to societal norms. Fromm's theory of productive vs. unproductive orientations is also relevant here.

Fromm believed that people have a tendency to adopt certain orientations toward life, such as receiving, controlling, marketing, productive, etc. He considered the productive orientation as a healthy way to relate to the world, where one can express their true self. In contrast, other orientations like the receptive (or receiving) orientation involve passively accepting what comes, which can prevent a person from being truly creative and productive.

Looking at the question, it's about which response allows a person to realize their true natureâ€”loving, creative, and productive. Fromm's productive orientation is about engaging with the world in a way that allows for growth and creativity. So I think the correct term would be "productive."

Looking at the options, option B says "The productive allows a person to realize its true nature, to be loving, creative, productive." That seems to fit because Fromm's productive orientation is about being able to express one's true self, which includes creativity and productivity.

Wait, but I should double-check the other options to make sure. Option A is authoritative, which I think is more about control, not about expressing oneself. Option C is destructive, which doesn't make sense because destructive behavior would hinder, not help, in realizing one's true nature. Option D is exploitative, which is about taking advantage, not about positive expression. Option E is manipulative, which is about using others, not about being genuine. Option F is marketing, which seems more about selling and consumerism, not about personal growth. Option G is hoarding, which is about accumulation, not about creativity. Option H is submissive, which is about following rather than expressing oneself. Option I is controlling, similar to authoritative. Option J is receptive, which Fromm discussed as a passive orientation, not the productive one.

So yes, option B seems correct because the productive orientation is the one that Fromm associates with being able to realize one's true nature.
