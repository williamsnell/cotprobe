Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantageâ€”the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places."
Frederick Douglass, 1857

Okay, so I have this question about Frederick Douglass and which social movement most influenced him. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that Frederick Douglass was a prominent figure in the 19th century, especially known for his work against slavery. He was a writer, speaker, and an abolitionist. So, the question is asking which social movement he was most influenced by, and the options include things like the Abolitionist Movement, the Second Great Awakening, the Enlightenment, etc.

Looking at the passage provided, it talks about how the slaveholders were well-organized and how various institutions like the state governments, churches, and the federal government were all supporting slavery. Douglass mentions that even the church and the federal government, through their military and judiciary, were against the truth being preached by abolitionists. He also talks about how the pen, purse, and sword were united against the truth, which I think refers to the organized opposition against abolitionist ideas.

Now, considering the social movements listed, the Abolitionist Movement was a significant movement in the 19th century aimed at ending slavery. Douglass was actively involved in this movement, writing and speaking out against slavery. His famous works, like "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass," were part of the abolitionist literature that sought to expose the horrors of slavery and push for its abolition.

Other options like the Second Great Awakening were a religious movement that emphasized personal salvation and social reform, including anti-slavery sentiments. But I think Douglass's primary influence came from the Abolitionist Movement itself, which had a direct focus on ending slavery rather than just moral reform.

The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement that influenced ideas about democracy and human rights, which might have indirectly influenced Douglass, but it's more of a broader intellectual movement rather than a specific social movement he was part of.

The Temperance Movement was about reducing alcohol consumption, which doesn't seem directly related. The Civil Rights Movement is more about the 20th century, so that's too late. The Women's Suffrage Movement is about voting rights for women, which is a different cause. The others like Manifest Destiny, Popular Sovereignty, and the Industrial Revolution don't seem to fit either.

So, putting it together, the Abolitionist Movement, option D, seems to be the most directly influential on Douglass because he was a key figure in it. His writings and speeches were part of the movement's efforts to end slavery, and he was influenced by and worked within this movement to push for change.

The Abolitionist Movement directly influenced Frederick Douglass as he was actively involved in it, using his writings and speeches to advocate against slavery. 

Answer: D
