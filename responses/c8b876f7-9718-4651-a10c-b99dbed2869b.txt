Okay, so I need to solve this heat transfer problem. Let me read the question again carefully. 

We have a metallic rod that's 20 cm long. It's initially heated to a uniform temperature of 100°C. At time t=0, the ends are put into an ice bath at 0°C, and they remain there. No heat escapes through the sides. I need to find the temperature at the center at t=30 seconds, and the rod is made of silver. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, this sounds like a one-dimensional heat conduction problem with fixed temperatures at the ends. I remember that the solution involves the Fourier number and some Bessel functions or maybe a sine series. Let me think about the setup.

The rod is 20 cm long, so L = 0.2 meters. The center is at x = L/2 = 0.1 m. The initial temperature is uniform at 100°C, and the boundary conditions are Dirichlet: T(0, t) = T(L, t) = 0°C for all t > 0.

The general solution for this kind of problem is a Fourier series. For a rod with ends at 0°C and initial condition T(x,0) = T0 (100°C here), the temperature distribution is given by:

T(x, t) = T0 * Σ [ (8 / π²) * Σ [ ( (-1)^{n+1} ) / n² ) * sin(nπx/L) * e^{- (nπ/L)^2 * α t } ]

Wait, no, that's probably not exactly right. Maybe it's a series in terms of sin terms with coefficients. Let me recall the formula. I think it's:

T(x, t) = Σ [ B_n * sin(nπx/L) * e^{- (nπ/L)^2 * α t } ]

Where B_n are the Fourier coefficients. For the initial condition T(x,0) = 100, we can find B_n by expanding it in a sine series.

So B_n = (2/L) ∫₀ᴸ 100 sin(nπx/L) dx. Let me compute that integral.

The integral of sin(nπx/L) dx from 0 to L is [ -L/(nπ) ) cos(nπx/L) ] from 0 to L. Plugging in, cos(nπ) - cos(0) = (-1)^n - 1. So,

B_n = (2/L) * 100 * [ L/(nπ) ) ( (-1)^n - 1 ) ]

Simplifying, B_n = (200)/(nπ) [ (-1)^n - 1 ]

Wait, but for n even, (-1)^n is 1, so [1 - 1] = 0, so B_n is zero for even n. Only odd n terms survive. Let me denote n = 2k - 1 for k=1,2,3,...

So B_n becomes (200)/(nπ) [ (-1)^{2k-1} - 1 ] = (200)/(nπ) [ (-1) - 1 ] = (200 * (-2))/(nπ) = (-400)/(nπ)

But actually, since the integral gives for odd n, let me check again. Wait, when n is odd, (-1)^n is -1, so [(-1)^n -1] = (-1 -1) = -2. So B_n = (200)/(nπ) * (-2) = -400/(nπ). But since the temperature is positive, I must have made a sign error. Wait, no, because the integral is correct, but perhaps I should have considered the function being positive, so the coefficients might come out positive. Hmm, maybe I missed a sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is:

T(x,t) = Σ [ (400/(nπ)) * (1 - (-1)^n) ) * sin(nπx/L) * e^{- (nπ/L)^2 α t } ]

But since (1 - (-1)^n) is zero for even n, only odd terms. So, let me define n=1,3,5,... So the solution simplifies to:

T(x,t) = Σ [ (400/(nπ)) * sin(nπx/L) * e^{- (nπ/L)^2 α t } ] where n runs over odd integers.

Wait, that makes sense because at t=0, it's 100°C everywhere. So each term contributes to the initial condition.

Now, the thermal diffusivity α for silver. I think the thermal diffusivity of silver is around 1.71 cm²/s. Let me confirm this value. Silver is a good conductor, so α is high. Yes, I think it's about 1.71 cm²/s. So α = 1.71 cm²/s.

Now, I need to find the temperature at the center, which is x = L/2 = 0.1 m, at t=30 s.

So, plugging x=0.1 m and t=30 s into the solution.

Let me compute the Fourier number Fo = α t / L². Wait, no, the exponent is (nπ/L)^2 * α t. So for each term, the exponent is (nπ/L)^2 * α t.

Let me compute (nπ/L)^2 * α t for each term, and then sum over the series.

But this seems complicated. Perhaps I can approximate the series by taking the first term, as higher terms become negligible. Let me check how many terms I need.

The first term (n=1) will dominate because higher n terms decay exponentially. Let me compute the first few terms and see if the sum converges.

So, for n=1:

Term1 = (400/(1π)) * sin(π*(0.1)/0.2) * e^{ - (π/(0.2))^2 * 1.71 * 30 }

Simplify sin(π*(0.1)/0.2) = sin(π/2) = 1.

Now, (π/0.2)^2 = (5π)^2 ≈ (15.70796)^2 ≈ 246.74.

So exponent becomes -246.74 * 1.71 * 30.

Wait, 1.71 * 30 = 51.3.

So exponent: -246.74 *51.3 ≈ -12620.7.

That's a huge negative exponent, so e^{-12620.7} is practically zero. So the first term is negligible? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, L is 20 cm, so 0.2 m. But in the thermal diffusivity, I should make sure all units are consistent. Since α is in cm²/s, and L is in cm, so let me use L=20 cm, t=30 s, so the exponent is (nπ/L)^2 * α t.

So, let me recalculate:

n=1: (π / 20 cm)^2 * (1.71 cm²/s) * 30 s.

Compute (π/20)^2 = (approx 3.1416/20)^2 ≈ (0.15708)^2 ≈ 0.02468.

Multiply by 1.71 cm²/s *30 s: 0.02468 * 1.71 *30 ≈ 0.02468 *51.3 ≈ 1.262.

So exponent is - (nπ/L)^2 * α t = -1.262.

So e^{-1.262} ≈ 0.283.

So the first term for n=1: (400/(1π)) *1 * 0.283 ≈ (127.324) *0.283 ≈ 36.05 °C.

Wait, that's a significant term. Now, let me check the next term, n=3.

n=3: (400/(3π)) * sin(3π*(0.1)/0.2) * e^{ - (3π/20)^2 *1.71 *30 }

Sin(3π*(0.1)/0.2)=sin(3π/2)= -1. So the term becomes (400/(3π))* (-1) * e^{- (3π/20)^2 *51.3}.

Compute the exponent:

(3π/20)^2 ≈ (0.4712)^2 ≈ 0.2219.

Multiply by 51.3: 0.2219 *51.3 ≈ 11.35.

So e^{-11.35} ≈ 1.05e-5.

So term3 ≈ (400/(3π)) * (-1) * 1.05e-5 ≈ (42.44) * (-1) * 1.05e-5 ≈ -4.456e-4 °C, which is negligible.

Similarly, higher terms will be even smaller because the exponent increases as n increases.

So the main contribution is from n=1, which is about 36.05°C. But wait, the initial temperature is 100, and after 30 seconds, the center is at ~36°C? That seems plausible, but let me check if I did the calculations correctly.

Wait, when I computed the exponent for n=1, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:

Fo = (α t) / L² = (1.71 cm²/s *30 s) / (20 cm)^2 = (51.3 cm²) / 400 cm² = 0.12825.

But wait, the exponent for each term is (nπ/L)^2 * α t = (n² π² / L²) * α t = n² * (π² α t / L²) = n² * π² * Fo.

So for n=1: π² * 0.12825 ≈ 9.8696 * 0.12825 ≈ 1.262.

Which matches what I had earlier. So e^{-1.262} ≈ 0.283.

So term1: (400/(1π)) * 1 * 0.283 ≈ 127.324 * 0.283 ≈ 36.05°C.

But wait, the temperature can't be higher than the initial condition, but 36 is less than 100, which makes sense.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 35.91°C, which is very close to 36.05. So perhaps the correct answer is near 35.91°C.

But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the coefficient. The B_n coefficients: earlier I thought B_n = (400)/(nπ), but let me double-check.

The initial condition is T(x,0)=100, so Fourier series:

100 = Σ B_n sin(nπx/L), so B_n = (2/L) ∫₀ᴸ 100 sin(nπx/L) dx.

Which is (200/L) ∫₀ᴸ sin(nπx/L) dx.

The integral of sin(a x) dx is -(1/a) cos(a x), so:

∫₀ᴸ sin(nπx/L) dx = [ -L/(nπ) ) (cos(nπ) - 1) ]

So B_n = (200/L) * [ -L/(nπ) (cos(nπ) - 1) ) ] = (-200)/(nπ) (cos(nπ) - 1 )

But cos(nπ) = (-1)^n, so:

B_n = (-200)/(nπ) [ (-1)^n - 1 ].

For n even: (-1)^n = 1, so [1 - 1] = 0. So B_n is zero for even n. For n odd: (-1)^n = -1, so [ -1 - 1 ] = -2. Thus, B_n = (-200)/(nπ) * (-2) = 400/(nπ).

Wait, so I had a sign error earlier. So B_n is positive for odd n, which makes sense because the temperature starts at 100 and decreases towards zero.

So, T(x,t) = Σ [ (400/(nπ)) sin(nπx/L) e^{- (n² π² α t)/L² } ]

So the first term is (400/π) e^{- π² α t / L²}.

At x=L/2, sin(nπ (L/2)/L) = sin(nπ/2). So for n=1, sin(π/2)=1; n=3, sin(3π/2)=-1; n=5, sin(5π/2)=1, etc.

So the series becomes:

T(L/2, t) = Σ [ (400/(nπ)) sin(nπ/2) e^{- (n² π² α t)/L² } ]

Which is:

(400/π) e^{- π² α t / L²} - (400/(3π)) e^{-9 π² α t / L² } + (400/(5π)) e^{-25 π² α t / L² } - ...

So, the first term is positive, the second negative, etc.

But as I saw earlier, the exponent for n=3 is much larger, making the term negligible. So let's compute the first term and see.

Compute the exponent for n=1:

Fo = α t / L² = (1.71 cm²/s *30 s) / (20 cm)^2 = 51.3 / 400 = 0.12825.

So the exponent is - π² * Fo = -9.8696 * 0.12825 ≈ -1.262.

So the first term: (400/π) * e^{-1.262} ≈ (127.324) * 0.283 ≈ 36.05°C.

Now, the second term, n=3:

Exponent: -(3² π²) * Fo = -9 * 9.8696 * 0.12825 ≈ -9 *1.262 ≈ -11.358.

e^{-11.358} ≈ 1.05e-5.

So term3: (400/(3π)) * (-1) * 1.05e-5 ≈ (42.44) * (-1) * 1.05e-5 ≈ -4.456e-4 °C. Negligible.

Similarly, n=5: exponent is -(25 * π² * Fo) ≈ -25 *1.262 ≈ -31.55. e^{-31.55} is extremely small, so term5 is negligible.

Thus, the temperature at the center is approximately 36.05°C. Looking at the options, option B is 35.91°C, which is very close. So I think the answer is B.

Wait, but let me check more precisely. Maybe I approximated too much. Let me compute e^{-1.262} more accurately.

Compute 1.262: ln(2)≈0.693, so 1.262 ≈ 1.262.

e^{-1.262} ≈ 1 / e^{1.262}.

e^1 = 2.71828; e^0.262 ≈ 1.299 (since ln(1.299)=0.262). So e^{1.262} ≈ 2.71828 * 1.299 ≈ 3.544. So 1/3.544≈0.282. So my earlier approximation was correct.

Thus, 400/π ≈127.32395. Multiply by 0.282: 127.324 *0.282 ≈ let's compute:

127 *0.282 = 35.814; 0.324*0.282≈0.091. So total≈35.905°C, which rounds to 35.91°C. So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the temperature at the center of a silver rod 20 cm long, initially at 100°C, with ends maintained at 0°C. Using the heat conduction equation and Fourier series, the temperature at the center is approximated by considering the first term of the series, as higher terms are negligible. The thermal diffusivity of silver is used to compute the Fourier number, leading to an exponential decay factor. After precise calculations, the temperature at the center at t=30 s is found to be approximately 35.91°C, corresponding to option B.

Answer: B
