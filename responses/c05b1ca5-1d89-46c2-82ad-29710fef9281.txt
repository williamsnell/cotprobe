Okay, so I have this question about why Parfit opposes equality, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Derek Parfit is a philosopher known for his work on ethics, particularly in areas like personal identity and moral theory. I think he's discussed equality in some of his works, maybe in "Reasons and Persons." 

The question is asking why Parfit opposes equality. So I need to recall his arguments against equality. I think Parfit is critical of certain aspects of equality, especially when it comes to distributive justice. He might argue that equality isn't the most important principle or that it can conflict with other values.

Looking at the options:

A: He claims that by giving priority to the needs of the poor, we can increase equality. Hmm, that sounds more like a positive stance on equality, but Parfit is supposed to oppose it, so maybe not A.

B: He rejects the idea of equality altogether. That's a strong statement. I don't think Parfit rejects equality entirely; he's more nuanced, I believe.

C: He believes that equality is not a realistic goal. This might be possible. He could argue that while equality is a good ideal, it's not achievable in practice, so we should focus on something else.

D: He argues that an unequal society is inevitable. That's a possibility. He might think that inequality is a natural outcome of human societies, but I'm not sure if that's his exact argument.

E: He suggests that societal structures inherently support inequality. That could be a point, but I'm not certain if Parfit specifically argues this.

F: He asserts that we are each responsible for our poverty. That sounds more like a libertarian view or perhaps a justification of inequality based on individual responsibility, which I think Parfit might not fully support.

G: He posits that striving for equality undermines individual freedoms. This seems plausible. Parfit might argue that pushing for complete equality could restrict individual liberties, which he values.

H: He argues that inequality is necessary for competition and progress. This sounds more like an economic argument, perhaps from a capitalist perspective, but I don't recall Parfit making this point.

I: He contends that inequality is a natural human condition. That might be a way to explain inequality, but I'm not sure if Parfit uses that as an argument against equality.

Wait, I think Parfit discusses the "Repugnant Conclusion" and other issues in his work. He also critiques the idea of equality of well-being. He might argue that too much focus on equality can lead to problems like the "levelling down" scenario, where making everyone equal reduces the well-being of those who are better off. So, he's concerned that striving for equality might not always lead to the best outcomes and could infringe on individual freedoms or lead to worse overall situations.

So, looking back at the options, G says he argues that striving for equality undermines individual freedoms. That aligns with the idea that Parfit thinks equality might not always be the best approach because it can limit individual choices and freedoms.

Alternatively, option C says equality isn't realistic. Parfit might think it's not achievable, but more importantly, he might argue that it's not the only or the most important value. Or perhaps he thinks that aiming for equality can have negative consequences, as in G.

I think G is the better fit because it's about the negative consequences of striving for equality, specifically regarding individual freedoms. So my answer would be G.

The answer is G.

The reasoning is that Parfit argues against equality by highlighting that striving for it can undermine individual freedoms, potentially leading to negative consequences. This aligns with his concerns about the limitations and possible negative outcomes of equality.

Answer: G
