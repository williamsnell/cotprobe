Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The premises are:
1. (A ∨ B) ⊃ (C ∨ D)
2. A ∨ B
3. ~C

I need to see which of the options A through I follows directly from these premises in one step. 

First, I remember that in propositional logic, an immediate consequence would be something derived using a single rule of inference. So I should look for which rule applies here.

Looking at the first premise, it's a conditional statement: if (A or B) then (C or D). The second premise is A or B. This setup makes me think of modus ponens, which is a rule where if you have P ⊃ Q and P, you can conclude Q. So applying modus ponens here, since we have (A ∨ B) as P, and (C ∨ D) as Q, then from premises 1 and 2, we can conclude C ∨ D. That would be option A. But wait, there's a third premise: ~C. So I need to see how that fits in.

With ~C, which is the negation of C, and we have C ∨ D from the first two premises. I remember that if you have C ∨ D and ~C, you can use the rule of disjunctive syllogism. That rule says that if you have (C ∨ D) and ~C, you can conclude D. But wait, in the options, I don't see D as a standalone option. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option E is ~~D, which is equivalent to D because double negation cancels out. So from ~C and C∨D, we can conclude D, which would be the same as ~~D. But wait, the question is about an immediate consequence from the premises, and I have to consider each step.

Wait, but the question is asking for an immediate consequence, which is just one step. So the first step would be applying modus ponens to premises 1 and 2 to get C∨D (option A). Then, using ~C, we can derive D. But since the question is about an immediate consequence, perhaps it's referring to the first step only. So maybe the answer is A.

But I'm a bit confused because option I is ~~C, which is the same as C. But since ~C is given, I don't think that's the conclusion. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the premises together. Let me list them again:

1. (A∨B) ⊃ (C∨D)
2. A∨B
3. ~C

From 1 and 2, by modus ponens, we can conclude C∨D. So that's option A. Now, with C∨D and ~C, we can apply disjunctive syllogism to get D. But that's two steps, so perhaps the immediate consequence is just C∨D, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is ~D ∨ C, which is the same as C∨~D. But that's not the same as C∨D. So that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using contrapositive. The first premise is (A∨B) → (C∨D). The contrapositive would be ~ (C∨D) → ~ (A∨B), which is equivalent to (¬C ∧ ¬D) → (¬A ∧ ¬B). But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.

Wait, another thought: since we have (A∨B) → (C∨D), and we have (A∨B), so we get C∨D. Then, since ~C is given, we can conclude D. But that's two steps, so perhaps the immediate consequence is C∨D, which is option A.

But let me check the options again. Option A is C∨D. So that's the immediate consequence of premises 1 and 2. Then, using ~C, we can get D. But the question is about the immediate consequence, so I think it's just A.

Wait, but another angle: perhaps using hypothetical syllogism. If I have (A∨B) → (C∨D) and also (A∨B) → something else, but I'm not sure that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe we can derive something else. Let me see: from ~C, and C∨D, we can derive D. So from the premises, can we derive D in one step? Well, to get D, we'd need to use disjunctive syllogism, which requires two premises: C∨D and ~C. But that's two steps, so perhaps D itself isn't an immediate consequence but requires two steps. So the immediate consequence is C∨D, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is ~~D, which is D. So if I can derive D in two steps, but the question is about an immediate consequence, which is one step. So the immediate consequence is A: C∨D.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me consider the first premise: (A∨B) → (C∨D). The second premise is A∨B. So applying modus ponens gives us C∨D. So that's immediate. Then, with ~C, we can derive D, but that's another step. So the immediate consequence is C∨D, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps someone might think that since ~C is given, we can derive something else. For example, from (A∨B) → (C∨D), and ~C, can we derive anything else? Let's see. If we assume (A∨B) is true, then (C∨D) must be true. But since ~C is given, (C∨D) being true implies D must be true. So that would lead us to D, but again, that's two steps.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is E: ~~D, because from the premises, we can derive D, which is the same as ~~D. But again, that requires two steps. So the immediate consequence is only one step, which is C∨D, option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is ~D ∨ C, which is logically equivalent to C∨~D. That doesn't seem right. So I think I'm confident that the immediate consequence is option A: C∨D.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Another approach: Maybe using the third premise ~C, can we derive something from premise 1 without using premise 2? Let's see. Premise 1 is (A∨B) → (C∨D). If we have ~C, is there a way to derive something else from premise 1? Well, the contrapositive would be ~ (C∨D) → ~ (A∨B), which is (¬C ∧ ¬D) → (¬A ∧ ¬B). But since we have ~C, if we also had ~D, we could derive ~(A∨B). But we don't have ~D, so that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe using hypothetical syllogism. If we have (A∨B) → (C∨D) and (C∨D) → something, but I don't think that applies here.

So, I think the correct immediate consequence is C∨D, which is option A. Therefore, the answer is A.

The immediate consequence of the given premises is derived using modus ponens on the first two premises, resulting in option A: C ∨ D.
