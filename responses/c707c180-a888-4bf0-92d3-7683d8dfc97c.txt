Okay, so I've got this problem here about krypton gas, and I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question says that a sample of gaseous krypton is under constant pressure. So, if the pressure is constant, that means we're dealing with Charles's Law, right? Because Charles's Law is about volume and temperature when pressure is constant. Yeah, I remember that one.

So the initial volume is 10.5 liters at 25°C. Then it's heated to 250°C, and we need to find the new volume. Hmm, okay. Charles's Law states that V1/T1 = V2/T2, where V is volume and T is temperature. But wait, temperature has to be in Kelvin for this, right? Because Celsius can't be used directly in gas law calculations. I think that's right because the Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, so it doesn't have negative values which could mess up the ratios.

Alright, so let's convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. Kelvin is just Celsius plus 273.15. So the initial temperature, T1, is 25°C. Adding 273.15 gives me 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K. And the final temperature, T2, is 250°C. Adding 273.15 gives 250 + 273.15 = 523.15 K. Okay, got that down.

Now, plugging into Charles's Law: V1 is 10.5 L, T1 is 298.15 K, and T2 is 523.15 K. So the equation becomes 10.5 / 298.15 = V2 / 523.15. I need to solve for V2. Let me rearrange that: V2 = (10.5 * 523.15) / 298.15. Let me calculate that.

First, multiply 10.5 by 523.15. Hmm, 10 times 523.15 is 5231.5, and 0.5 times 523.15 is 261.575. Adding those together gives me 5231.5 + 261.575 = 5493.075. So the numerator is 5493.075. Now, divide that by 298.15.

Let me see, 298.15 into 5493.075. I'll do this division step by step. Let's approximate 298.15 as about 300 for simplicity first. 300 goes into 5400 about 18 times (300*18=5400). But wait, 300 is a bit higher than 298.15, so the actual result should be a bit higher than 18. Let me calculate more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach. 5493.075 ÷ 298.15. Let me see, 298.15 multiplied by 18 is 5366.7 (since 300*18=5400, minus 1.85*18=33.3, so 5400-33.3=5366.7). Subtracting that from 5493.075, I get 5493.075 -5366.7 = 126.375 left. Now, 298.15 goes into 126.375 about 0.424 times (since 298.15 *0.4=119.26, and 298.15*0.424 is approximately 126). So adding that to 18 gives me approximately 18.424 liters.

Wait, but let me check the options given. The options are A to J. Let me look at the options again. Option I is 19.85 l, which is higher. Option D is 18.41 l, which is very close to what I calculated, 18.424. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, let me recalculate the division more accurately. Let me use the exact numbers.

V2 = (10.5 * 523.15) / 298.15 = (5493.075) / 298.15.

Dividing 5493.075 by 298.15:

Let me compute 298.15 × 18 = 5366.7, as before. Subtracting that from 5493.075 gives 126.375. Now, 298.15 × 0.424 = 126.375? Let me check:

0.4 * 298.15 = 119.26.

0.02 * 298.15 = 5.963.

0.004 * 298.15 = 1.1926.

Adding those: 119.26 +5.963=125.223, plus 1.1926=126.4156. That's very close to 126.375. So 0.424 would give about 126.4156, which is a bit higher than 126.375. So actually, 0.424 is a bit too high. So perhaps 0.4238?

But for the purposes of the problem, the closest option is D: 18.41 l. So that's probably the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe I should have kept more decimal places. But considering significant figures, the given temperatures are 25 and 250°C, which are two significant figures each. So the answer should have two significant figures. Wait, 18.41 is three sig figs, but let me see. 10.5 has three sig figs, so maybe the answer should be three sig figs.

Wait, 10.5 is three sig figs, and temperatures have three as well (25.0°C is two, but written as 25°C, which is two sig figs, but if it's 25°C, then it's two. Hmm, but in the problem, it's written as 25°C, which is two sig figs. So the result should probably have two decimal places? Or maybe two sig figs? Wait, no, the rules for multiplication and division state that the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement. So, the temps are 25°C (two sig figs) and 250°C (two sig figs again, because the zero may not be significant unless specified). So the least is two. But wait, the volume is 10.5, which is three sig figs. So the result should be three sig figs, I think.

Wait, but Charles's Law uses ratios of temperatures, so when you do V1/T1 = V2/T2, the absolute temperatures are used, but the significant figures would depend on the given data. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. But I think the answer options have more precise numbers, so perhaps the correct approach is to calculate precisely and see which option matches.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me try 5493.075 ÷ 298.15.

Let me compute 298.15 × 18.41 = ?

298.15 * 18 = 5366.7.

298.15 * 0.41 = let's compute that: 0.4 * 298.15 = 119.26, 0.01 *298.15=2.9815. So 119.26 + 2.9815=122.2415.

Adding to 5366.7 gives 5366.7 +122.2415=5488.9415. But our numerator is 5493.075, which is higher than 5488.9415. The difference is 5493.075 -5488.9415=4.1335.

So how much more is needed? 4.1335 ÷298.15 ≈0.01386. So total would be 18.41 +0.01386≈18.42386 liters. So approximately 18.424 liters. Looking at the options, D is 18.41 l, which is very close. So that's the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we use Charles's Law, which states that \( \frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} \), where \( V \) is volume and \( T \) is temperature in Kelvin. The initial volume \( V_1 = 10.5 \, \text{L} \) and the initial temperature \( T_1 = 25^\circ \text{C} \). Converting \( T_1 \) to Kelvin:  
\[
T_1 = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K}.
\]  
The final temperature \( T_2 = 250^\circ \text{C} \). Converting \( T_2 \) to Kelvin:  
\[
T_2 = 250 + 273.15 = 523.15 \, \text{K}.
\]  

Substituting into Charles's Law:  
\[
\frac{10.5}{298.15} = \frac{V_2}{523.15}.
\]  
Rearranging to solve for \( V_2 \):  
\[
V_2 = \frac{10.5 \times 523.15}{298.15}.
\]  

Calculating the numerator:  
\[
10.5 \times 523.15 = 5493.075.
\]  

Dividing by the denominator:  
\[
V_2 = \frac{5493.075}{298.15} \approx 18.424 \, \text{L}.
\]  

Among the given options, the closest value to \( 18.424 \, \text{L} \) is **18.41 L**. Therefore, the correct answer is:
