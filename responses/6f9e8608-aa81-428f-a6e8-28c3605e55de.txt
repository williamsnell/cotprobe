Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through it carefully.

The problem says: A cart with a mass of 5 kg is moving horizontally across a frictionless table at a speed of 1 m/s. Then, a brick of mass 5 kg is dropped onto the cart. The question is asking what the change in velocity of the cart is. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, alright. So, first, I remember that when two objects come into contact and there's no external force acting, their combined momentum should remain the same because of the law of conservation of momentum. Since the table is frictionless, I think that means there's no external force in the horizontal direction, so momentum should be conserved here.

Let me break it down. Initially, the cart is moving, and the brick is probably stationary because it's being dropped onto the cart. So, the brick's initial velocity is zero, right? Because it's just being released from rest, I assume.

Wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify if the brick is moving or not when it's dropped. But since it's just being dropped onto the cart, I think it's safe to assume that the brick's initial velocity is zero relative to the cart's motion. So the brick is at rest, or maybe moving vertically, but since the cart is on a frictionless table, the brick's vertical motion doesn't affect the horizontal motion of the cart, right? Or does it?

Wait, no. When the brick is dropped, it's moving downward due to gravity, but since the cart is moving horizontally, the brick's horizontal velocity before impact is zero. So, when it lands on the cart, they'll move together with some common velocity.

So, I should apply the conservation of momentum here. The total momentum before the brick hits the cart should equal the total momentum after they stick together.

Let me assign variables to make it clearer.

Let m_cart = 5 kg, v_cart_initial = 1 m/s.

m_brick = 5 kg, v_brick_initial = 0 m/s (since it's dropped and not moving horizontally before impact).

After the brick is dropped onto the cart, they move together with a common velocity v_final.

So, the total initial momentum is just the cart's momentum because the brick isn't moving horizontally. So initial momentum = m_cart * v_cart_initial + m_brick * v_brick_initial = 5 kg * 1 m/s + 5 kg * 0 m/s = 5 kg·m/s.

The final momentum is (m_cart + m_brick) * v_final = (5 + 5) kg * v_final = 10 kg * v_final.

Setting initial equal to final: 5 kg·m/s = 10 kg * v_final.

Solving for v_final: v_final = 5 / 10 = 0.5 m/s.

Wait, but the question is asking for the change in velocity of the cart. So, the cart's initial velocity was 1 m/s, and after the collision, it's 0.5 m/s. So the change is 0.5 m/s - 1 m/s = -0.5 m/s.

Wait, that makes sense because the cart slows down when the brick is added. So the change in velocity is negative 0.5 m/s, meaning a decrease.

Looking at the options, E is -0.5 m/s. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the momentum or the velocities.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of the center of mass. The combined system's velocity after the brick is dropped should be the velocity of the center of mass.

The initial position: the cart is moving, the brick is at rest. So the center of mass velocity would be (m_cart * v_cart + m_brick * v_brick) / (m_cart + m_brick).

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So v_final = 0.5 m/s, and the change is -0.5 m/s.

So yes, the answer should be E: -0.5 m/s.

The problem involves a cart of mass 5 kg moving at 1 m/s on a frictionless table, with a brick of 5 kg dropped onto it. Using the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum of the system is 5 kg·m/s (from the cart), and the final momentum is shared between the cart and brick, resulting in a common velocity of 0.5 m/s. The change in velocity of the cart is -0.5 m/s, indicating a decrease. 

Answer: E
