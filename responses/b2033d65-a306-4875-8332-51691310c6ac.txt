Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of acetone. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that when acetone is heated to 600°C, it decomposes into carbon monoxide and various hydrocarbons. The reaction is first-order in acetone concentration, and the half-life is 81 seconds. The container is 1 liter, and acetone is injected at an initial pressure of 0.48 atm. We need to find out how long it takes for the pressure to drop to 0.45 atm.

Hmm, I remember that for a first-order reaction, the half-life is independent of the initial concentration. The formula for the half-life (t₁/₂) is ln(2) divided by the rate constant (k). So, t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. Since we know the half-life is 81 seconds, I can solve for k.

Let me calculate k first. ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So, k = ln(2)/t₁/₂ = 0.693 / 81 ≈ 0.008556 s⁻¹. Wait, that seems really small. Let me double-check the calculation. 81 divided by 0.693 is roughly 116.8, so 0.693 divided by 81 would be around 0.008556 per second. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, the reaction is first-order, so the rate law is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt. Here, [A]₀ is the initial concentration, and [A] is the concentration at time t. But wait, the problem gives pressures, not concentrations. Oh, but since the container is rigid (1 liter), the pressure is proportional to concentration. So, I can use the pressures directly in the equation.

Our initial pressure is 0.48 atm, and we want to find t when the pressure drops to 0.45 atm. So, plugging into the equation: ln(0.48 / 0.45) = k * t.

Let me compute 0.48 divided by 0.45. That's 1.0667. So, ln(1.0667) is approximately... I think ln(1) is 0, ln(1.0667) is about 0.0645. Let me check with a calculator in my head. Alternatively, using the Taylor series approximation: ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 for small x. Here, x is 0.0667. So, ln(1.0667) ≈ 0.0667 - (0.0667)^2/2 ≈ 0.0667 - 0.00222 ≈ 0.0645. Yeah, that seems about right.

So, 0.0645 = k * t. We found k to be approximately 0.008556 s⁻¹. So, t = 0.0645 / 0.008556 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.0645 divided by 0.008556. Let me see: 0.008556 * 7 = 0.05989, which is just under 0.0645. The difference is about 0.00461. 0.00461 / 0.008556 ≈ 0.54. So, total t ≈ 7.54 seconds. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 7.5 sec and J is 12 sec. Hmm, 7.5 is close to what I got, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Let me calculate 0.0645 / 0.008556 more accurately. 0.008556 * 7 = 0.059892. Subtract that from 0.0645: 0.0645 - 0.059892 = 0.004608. Now, 0.004608 / 0.008556 = 0.54. So, t ≈ 7.54 seconds, which is approximately 7.5 seconds. So, the answer should be D:7.5 sec.

Wait, but wait. The initial pressure is 0.48 atm, and the final is 0.45 atm. Let me make sure I got the ratio right. Oh wait, I think I might have mixed up the ratio. The formula is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt. So, [A]₀ is 0.48, [A] is 0.45. So, 0.48/0.45 is 1.0667, which is correct. So, ln(1.0667) is about 0.0645. So, that part is right.

Another thing to consider: maybe the reaction is not A → products but something else, but since it's first-order, the general approach still applies. The pressure drops because acetone is decomposing, so the formula should be correct.

So, I think the correct answer is D: 7.5 sec.

The decomposition of acetone is a first-order reaction with a half-life of 81 seconds. Using the half-life formula, the rate constant \( k \) is calculated as \( k = \frac{\ln(2)}{81} \approx 0.008556 \, \text{s}^{-1} \). The reaction follows the first-order kinetics equation \( \ln\left(\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}\right) = kt \), where the pressures are used in place of concentrations since the container volume is constant.

Given the initial pressure \( [A]_0 = 0.48 \, \text{atm} \) and the final pressure \( [A] = 0.45 \, \text{atm} \), the ratio \( \frac{0.48}{0.45} = 1.0667 \) is taken, and \( \ln(1.0667) \approx 0.0645 \). Substituting into the equation \( 0.0645 = 0.008556 \cdot t \), the time \( t \) is found to be approximately \( 7.5 \, \text{seconds} \). This matches option D.
