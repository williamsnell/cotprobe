Question:

A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial artists' studios in that city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial figure drawer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city. A gallery, located in a neighboring state, has been sending two itinerant artists into the city. Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of $2. 00. The drawing is sent to a studio, which frames it and mails the framed painting to the customer. The neighboring state does not impose a tax on artists' studios. The gallery challenges the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax that is imposed upon its itinerant artists in the city. The court will most likely declare this tax

Options:

A: constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.
B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.
C: constitutional, as it is a valid usage fee for public property.
D: constitutional, as the tax is a valid exercise of the city's power to regulate commerce.
E: unconstitutional, as it violates the principle of equal protection under the law.
F: constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.
G: unconstitutional, since the tax unfairly burdens out-of-state businesses.
H: unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.
I: unconstitutional, since it amounts to double taxation.

Okay, so I've got this tax law question here, and I need to figure out whether a municipal excise tax is constitutional. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The city imposes two excise taxes: $200 per year on commercial artists' studios and $100 per year on itinerant figure drawers. There's a credit allowed against the $100 tax for any excise tax paid on a studio. So, if the itinerant artist pays the studio tax, they can get a credit, which effectively reduces their liability.

The gallery in another state sends two itinerant artists into the city. These artists approach pedestrians, draw their picture, ask them to order a finished painting, and collect $2.00. The drawing goes to a studio, which frames it and sends the framed painting back to the customer. Importantly, the neighboring state doesn't tax artists' studios.

The gallery is challenging the $100 tax on its itinerant artists. The question is whether this tax is constitutional.

First, I should consider what kind of tax this is. It's an excise tax imposed on the privilege of using streets and sidewalks. So, it's a tax on the use of public property. Excise taxes can sometimes be seen as usage fees, which are generally constitutional if they're not discriminatory and don't impede interstate commerce.

Wait, but the artists are itinerant, which means they move around. They're working in the city but their studio is elsewhere. The city is taxing them for using the streets and sidewalks. The tax is per figure drawer, not per studio. The credit allows them to reduce the tax if they've paid the studio tax elsewhere.

Now, the issue is whether this tax is a valid exercise of the city's authority or if it's unconstitutional, perhaps under the commerce clause.

Another angle is whether the tax discriminates against interstate commerce. The artists are from another state, and their studio isn't in the city. The neighboring state doesn't impose a studio tax, so if the itinerant artists are from there, maybe the city's tax is affecting their ability to do business.

I remember that the Supreme Court has held that states and municipalities can impose taxes on the privilege of doing business within their jurisdiction, as long as they're not discriminatory and relate to the benefits provided, like use of public infrastructure.

In this case, the $100 tax is for using the streets and sidewalks. That seems like a usage fee. The fact that the artists are from another state shouldn't make it unconstitutional unless it's discriminatory. The tax applies to all itinerant figure drawers, regardless of where they're from, right?

Wait, but the credit only applies if they pay the studio tax elsewhere. So if the artists are from a state without a studio tax, they might not get the credit. But does that make the tax discriminatory? Because it's giving a credit to those who pay elsewhere, but not to those who don't. But the tax itself is on the use of streets, so it's a fee for using public property. That should be constitutional because it's tied to the actual use.

Alternatively, could this be seen as a tax on interstate commerce? The activity here involves interstate commerce because the artists are from another state, and the paintings are sent across state lines. But the tax is on the privilege of using the streets, which is a local activity. The city has the authority to regulate and tax activities within its borders, especially those that use public infrastructure.

Also, the fact that the neighboring state doesn't impose a studio tax isn't directly relevant unless the city's tax is interfering with interstate commerce by favoring local businesses over out-of-state ones. But in this case, the tax is on the use of streets, which is a local privilege. So it's a valid usage fee.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would likely be constitutional because it's a valid usage fee for public property. So option C says it's constitutional as a usage fee. Alternatively, option F says it's constitutional because the tax is on the local activity of drawing pictures.

Wait, the tax is on the privilege of using the streets, which is a local activity. So maybe F is also a correct reasoning. But I think the primary reason is that it's a usage fee for public property, which is option C.

Wait, but the city is imposing a tax on the privilege of using the streets, which is a valid purpose. It's similar to a business license tax, which is generally upheld as a valid exercise of local authority unless it's discriminatory or unduly burdensome on interstate commerce.

In this case, the tax doesn't discriminate because it's imposed on all itinerant figure drawers, regardless of where they're from. So it doesn't violate the commerce clause. Therefore, the court would likely uphold it as constitutional under the city's police power to regulate local businesses and charge for the use of public facilities.

So I think the answer is C or F. Wait, option C says it's a valid usage fee for public property, which is a better fit because the tax is specifically for using the streets and sidewalks. Option F talks about the local activity of drawing pictures, which is more about the business activity, but the tax is on the use of public property.

Therefore, I think the answer is C: constitutional, as it is a valid usage fee for public property.

The city's $100 excise tax on itinerant figure drawers is imposed for the privilege of using streets and sidewalks, which constitutes a valid usage fee for public property. The tax applies to all such artists, regardless of their origin, and is not discriminatory. It is a legitimate exercise of the city's authority to charge for the use of public infrastructure, aligning with constitutional principles. Therefore, the tax is constitutional.

Answer: C
