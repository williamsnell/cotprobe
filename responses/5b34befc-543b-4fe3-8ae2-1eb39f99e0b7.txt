Question:

A 57-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of cramping in his hands and feet and numbness and tingling around his lips and in his fingers; these symptoms occurred intermittently for 6 months but have been progressively severe during the past 2 weeks. He also has had a 13-kg (30-lb) weight loss and bulky, foul-smelling stools that do not flush easily. He has a 10-year history of drinking 8 to 10 beers daily. He has been hospitalized twice for severe abdominal pain 4 and 6 years ago. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg. He appears cachectic and chronically ill. The abdomen is nontender. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. Chvostek and Trousseau signs are present. His serum calcium concentration is 6.5 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Hypercalcemia
B: Hypokalemia
C: Osteomalacia
D: Chronic Pancreatitis
E: Vitamin D deficiency
F: Hyperparathyroidism
G: Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome
H: Pernicious Anemia

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the patient is a 57-year-old man with some concerning symptoms. He's been having cramping in his hands and feet, numbness and tingling around his lips and fingers. These symptoms started intermittently six months ago but got worse in the past two weeks. Also, he's lost 13 kg, which is a significant weight loss, and he's having bulky, foul-smelling stools that don't flush easily. He drinks a lot of beer—8 to 10 beers daily for 10 years. He's been hospitalized twice for severe abdominal pain, four and six years ago. His pulse is 80, blood pressure 105/65. He looks cachectic and chronically ill. The abdomen isn't tender, but his deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. Chvostek and Trousseau signs are present. His serum calcium is 6.5 mg/dL.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, the symptoms. He's got cramping and numbness/tingling, which makes me think of something affecting the nerves. Those symptoms can be related to electrolyte imbalances. The Chvostek and Trousseau signs are positive—those are signs of hypocalcemia. Chvostek's sign is when tapping behind the ear causes a facial spasm, and Trousseau's sign involves the hand flexing when a tourniquet is applied. Both are indicative of low calcium levels.

So, his calcium level is 6.5 mg/dL. Normal is usually around 8.5-10.2 mg/dL, so this is low. That points towards hypocalcemia. But why? There are various causes—parathyroid issues, vitamin D deficiency, kidney problems, chronic pancreatitis, etc.

He drinks a lot of alcohol. Alcohol can cause a lot of issues. Chronic alcohol use can lead to deficiency of vitamin D and other nutrients, but also, alcohol can affect the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis often presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, and steatorrhea—those bulky, foul-smelling stools that don't flush. His history of being hospitalized twice for severe abdominal pain aligns with that. Plus, his stools are described as bulky and foul, which is classic for malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency.

In chronic pancreatitis, the exocrine function of the pancreas decreases, leading to maldigestion and steatorrhea. The endocrine function can also be affected, leading to diabetes. Additionally, chronic pancreatitis can cause deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D because they aren't being absorbed properly. But wait, vitamin D deficiency would cause low calcium, but so would hyperparathyroidism if the parathyroids are overactive.

Wait, his calcium is low. If the parathyroid glands are underactive, that would cause hypocalcemia. But if they're overactive, that would be hypercalcemia. His calcium is low, so maybe the parathyroids aren't working, but why?

Alternatively, chronic pancreatitis can lead to secondary causes of hypocalcemia. One of the complications of chronic pancreatitis is the development of pancreatic calcifications, which can obstruct the ducts and cause damage. Also, the body's response to chronic inflammation might involve increased bone resorption, but that's more about parathyroid function.

Wait, another angle: alcohol can cause a lot of issues. In chronic alcoholism, there's often a deficiency in thiamine, but that's more about Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. But in this case, the symptoms point more towards pancreatic issues and hypocalcemia.

He's got a history of heavy alcohol use. Chronic pancreatitis is a known complication of long-term alcohol abuse. His symptoms of abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and weight loss fit that. The hypocalcemia could be due to vitamin D deficiency because the pancreas isn't absorbing it, but also, sometimes chronic pancreatitis can cause hypocalcemia because of exocrine insufficiency leading to malabsorption of vitamin D, or maybe due to other factors like secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Wait, but hyperparathyroidism would cause high calcium, not low. But in secondary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid glands are overactive because of low calcium levels (like in vitamin D deficiency or kidney disease), leading to increased PTH which can cause bone resorption and high calcium, but that's usually a response. However, in chronic pancreatitis, the malabsorption can lead to deficiencies, including vitamin D, which then causes hypocalcemia. But sometimes, the parathyroids can become hyperactive in response, leading to high PTH levels but maybe not enough to increase serum calcium, or perhaps in this case, the calcium is still low because the underlying issue isn't resolved.

Looking back at the options: option C is osteomalacia, which is a softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency or other causes. Osteomalacia would present with bone pain and muscle weakness, but in this case, the symptoms are more neurological—tingling and numbness. So maybe not the primary issue here.

Option D is chronic pancreatitis. That seems to fit with his history of alcohol use, the abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and weight loss. The hypocalcemia could be a result of vitamin D deficiency from malabsorption.

Option E is vitamin D deficiency. That's a possibility, but why the steatorrhea and abdominal pain? He could have both, but the main issue seems to be the pancreas.

Option F is hyperparathyroidism. His calcium is low, so that's unlikely. Unless it's a primary hyper, but his calcium is low, so probably not.

Option G is alcohol withdrawal. He's presenting with chronic issues, not acute withdrawal symptoms like seizures or delirium. So probably not.

Option H is pernicious anemia. That's a B12 deficiency causing anemia and neuropathy. He would have macrocytic anemia, but his symptoms are more about hypocalcemia and pancreatic issues.

So, putting it together: he has chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol, leading to steatorrhea, weight loss, and vitamin D deficiency (due to malabsorption), which causes hypocalcemia. The positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs confirm hypocalcemia. His reflexes are 4+, which is hyperreflexia, also seen in hypocalcemia.

But wait, another thought: could this be related to alcohol-induced liver disease causing hypocalcemia? But I think more likely, the pancreatitis is the main issue. Also, his abdomen isn't tender, which is a bit odd because chronic pancreatitis can cause abdominal pain, but maybe it's not acutely tender.

So the most likely diagnosis is chronic pancreatitis (option D), which explains his symptoms, including the hypocalcemia due to malabsorption of vitamin D and possibly other nutrients. Alternatively, could it be vitamin D deficiency (option E)? But the steatorrhea and weight loss are more indicative of pancreatic issues.

Wait, but the question is about the most likely diagnosis. His symptoms include hypocalcemia signs, which could be due to vitamin D deficiency, but in the context of chronic pancreatitis, which is more likely the primary diagnosis given his history and other symptoms.

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of chronic alcohol use, presenting with hypocalcemia (serum calcium 6.5 mg/dL), intermittent cramping, numbness, and tingling, as well as bulky, foul-smelling stools and significant weight loss. His symptoms align with chronic pancreatitis, a known complication of long-term alcohol abuse. Chronic pancreatitis causes exocrine insufficiency, leading to steatorrhea and malabsorption, which can result in vitamin D deficiency and subsequent hypocalcemia. The positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs confirm hypocalcemia, and his history of abdominal pain and pancreatic involvement further support this diagnosis. While vitamin D deficiency could explain the hypocalcemia, the broader clinical picture, including steatorrhea and weight loss, points to chronic pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis.
