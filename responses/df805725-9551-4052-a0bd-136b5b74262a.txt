Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about labeled forests on 8 vertices. The question is asking for the number of such forests with 5 connected components, and importantly, vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all have to be in different connected components. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that a forest is a collection of trees, so each connected component is a tree. Since we're dealing with labeled vertices, each tree is labeled as well. The problem specifies 8 vertices and 5 connected components, so that means 5 trees in total.

Now, vertices 1 through 5 each have to be in separate components. So, each of these 5 vertices is the root or part of a separate tree. That leaves us with 3 more vertices (since 8 - 5 = 3) that can be part of any of these trees. Wait, no, actually, each of these 5 vertices is in its own component, so each of these 5 vertices must be the only vertex in their respective trees. Because if each has to be in a different component, each of these 5 is a single-vertex tree. Then, the remaining 3 vertices (6,7,8) can be distributed among these trees or form their own trees.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the total number of connected components is 5. If 5 of the vertices are each in their own component, that's 5 components already. So the remaining 3 vertices must form their own trees, but that would make more than 5 components. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the total number of connected components is 5. So, if 5 of the vertices (1-5) are each in their own component, that's 5 components right there. But wait, 8 vertices in total, so if each of 1-5 is a single-vertex component, that's 5 components, and the remaining 3 vertices (6,7,8) must form trees on their own. But wait, that would mean each of the remaining 3 is a single-vertex, making 8 components, which is more than 5. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the vertices 1-5 are each in their own connected component, but those components can have more than one vertex. So, for example, one of the components could have vertex 1 and some others, another component has vertex 2 and some others, etc. But wait, no, because the problem says that vertices 1,2,3,4,5 all belong to different connected components. So each must be in their own component, but those components can have more vertices. But wait, no, because each component is a tree, and if a component has vertex 1, it can have other vertices connected to it. But in that case, the component is a tree with vertex 1 as the root, perhaps. Hmm, but the problem says that each of 1-5 is in a different component, so each is the only vertex in their component. Because if any of them had another vertex, that would require another component, which would increase the total number beyond 5.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me clarify. The total number of connected components is 5. So, if each of the 5 vertices (1-5) is in a separate component, that uses up all 5 components, right? So the remaining 3 vertices (6,7,8) must be distributed among these 5 components. But wait, each of the 5 components already has one vertex (1-5), so the remaining 3 can be added to any of these 5 components, but in a way that each addition forms a tree.

Wait, no, because each component is a tree, and adding a vertex to a component would mean that the tree grows by one vertex. But how do we count the number of ways to distribute these 3 vertices among the 5 existing components, where each component can have any number of the added vertices, but each addition must form a tree.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the components for 1-5 can have any number of the remaining vertices, including zero. Wait, but the total number of components must remain 5. So, perhaps each of the 5 components can have any number of the remaining 3 vertices, but each component must have at least one vertex (since a tree with zero vertices isn't possible). Wait, no, because each component already has one vertex (1-5), so adding more is optional.

Wait, no, the problem is that the total number of connected components is 5. So, if I have 5 components, each containing one of the vertices 1-5, and then the remaining 3 vertices (6,7,8) can be added to any of these 5 components. But when you add a vertex to a component, it's like adding an edge to form a tree. Wait, but each component is a tree, so each component's structure is a tree with at least one vertex.

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to counting the number of ways to partition the remaining 3 vertices into the 5 components, with each component allowed to have zero or more of the remaining vertices, but each addition must form a tree. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the concept of labeled forests. I remember that the number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is given by the formula involving binomial coefficients and something else. Wait, let me recall. The number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is equal to the number of ways to choose which k vertices are the roots, and then the rest are arranged as trees under these roots.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for the number of labeled forests with k trees on n vertices. I think the formula is k * C(n-1, k-1) * n^{n-k-1} }, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's related to Cayley's formula, which states that the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^{n-2}. For forests, the number of labeled forests with k trees on n vertices is C(n-1, k-1) * n^{n - k - 1} }, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. Cayley's formula says that the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^{n-2}. For forests, the number of labeled forests with k trees on n vertices is given by (n choose k) * k * n^{n - k - 1} }, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of ways to partition the vertices into k non-empty subsets, each of which forms a tree. Wait, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as each connected component being a tree, and the total number of such forests is the product of the number of trees on each component, multiplied by the number of ways to partition the vertices into these components.

Wait, but in this problem, we have 5 components, each containing one of the vertices 1-5. So each of these 5 components is a tree containing one of these vertices, and the remaining 3 vertices (6,7,8) can be assigned to any of these 5 components, with the condition that each component must form a tree.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows: Each of the 5 components already has one vertex (1-5), and the remaining 3 vertices can be assigned to any of these 5 components. For each such assignment, the number of trees in that component is the number of labeled trees on (1 + number of assigned vertices). So, for example, if vertex 6 is assigned to component 1, then component 1 becomes a tree with vertices 1 and 6, and the number of such trees is 2^{2-2} = 1 (since a tree on 2 vertices has only one structure). Similarly, if two vertices are assigned to component 1, then the number of trees is 3^{3-2} = 3, and so on.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the number of ways to assign the 3 vertices to the 5 components is equivalent to the number of ways to distribute 3 distinguishable objects into 5 distinguishable boxes, where each box can have any number of objects, including zero. That's 5^3 = 125 ways.

But then, for each such distribution, the number of trees in each component would be the product over each component's size. For example, if a component has s vertices, the number of labeled trees on s vertices is s^{s-2}.

Wait, but in our case, each component already has one vertex (1-5), and the distribution adds some number of the remaining 3 vertices to each component. So for each component i (i=1 to 5), let s_i be the number of additional vertices assigned to it. Then the total number of trees for that component is (1 + s_i)^{(1 + s_i) - 2} } = (1 + s_i)^{-1} }, which doesn't make sense because s_i can be zero. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because when s_i = 0, the component has 1 vertex, so the number of trees is 1^{1-2} = 1^{-1} = 1, which is correct. When s_i =1, it's 2^{0}=1, which is correct because a tree on 2 vertices has only one structure. When s_i=2, 3^{1}=3, which is correct, as there are 3 labeled trees on 3 vertices.

But wait, that would mean that for each component, if it gets s_i additional vertices, the number of trees is (1 + s_i)^{(1 + s_i) - 2} } = (1 + s_i)^{-1} }, which for s_i >=1 is 1/(1 + s_i). But that seems problematic because when s_i=3, it's 3^{1}=3, which is correct, but when s_i=0, it's 1^{-1}=1, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the number of ways to assign the 3 vertices to the 5 components is 5^3 =125, and for each assignment, the number of trees is the product for each component of (size of component)^{size-2}.

Wait, let me try to model this correctly. The total number of forests would be the sum over all possible distributions of the 3 vertices into the 5 components, multiplied by the product for each component of (size of component)^{size-2}.

So, the problem reduces to:

1. For each possible way to distribute the 3 vertices (6,7,8) into the 5 components (each component can get 0,1,2, or 3 of them), calculate the number of trees for that distribution.

2. Sum over all possible distributions.

But that sounds computationally intensive, but maybe there's a generating function approach or a combinatorial formula that can be applied.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use exponential generating functions or some combinatorial identity to compute this.

Wait, another approach: The number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is given by the formula k * C(n-1, k-1) * n^{n - k - 1} }, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that the number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is equal to the number of ways to choose the roots and then the trees.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of Prüfer sequences. The number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is equal to the number of Prüfer sequences of length n - k, which is C(n, k) * k * n^{n - k - 1} }, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let me think differently. In this problem, we have 8 vertices, and we want 5 connected components. Each of the vertices 1-5 is in its own component, so each of these 5 components has exactly one vertex. The remaining 3 vertices (6,7,8) can be assigned to any of these 5 components, but each assignment must form a tree.

Wait, but each assignment of a vertex to a component increases the size of that component by 1, and the number of trees for that component would then be (current size +1)^(current size +1 -2) = (current size +1)^(current size -1).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model each component's contribution as the number of trees possible given the number of vertices assigned to it. So for each component i (i=1 to 5), if it gets s_i vertices (including the initial one), then the number of trees for that component is s_i^{s_i -2}.

So, the total number of forests would be the sum over all possible distributions of the 3 vertices into the 5 components, multiplied by the product for each component of s_i^{s_i -2}, where s_i is the number of vertices in component i (including the initial one).

But this seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a generating function for this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute it using multinomial coefficients.

Let me try to model it step by step.

Each of the 3 vertices (6,7,8) can be assigned to any of the 5 components. So, for each vertex, there are 5 choices. Thus, there are 5^3 = 125 possible assignments.

For each assignment, we can compute the number of trees for each component. Let's denote that for each component i, s_i is the number of vertices assigned to it (including the initial one). So, s_i = 1 + number of additional vertices assigned to i.

The number of trees for component i is s_i^{s_i -2}.

So, the total number of forests for a given assignment is the product over i=1 to 5 of s_i^{s_i -2}.

Therefore, the total number of forests is the sum over all possible assignments of 6,7,8 to the 5 components of the product of s_i^{s_i -2} for each component.

But this seems computationally heavy, but perhaps we can find a way to compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a generating function. The exponential generating function for the number of trees is T(x) = sum_{n=1}^{∞} n^{n-2} x^n /n!}.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps we can think of it as each component contributes a factor of (number of trees on s_i vertices) = s_i^{s_i -2}, and since the assignments are independent, the total is the product over all components of this factor.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this sum.

Wait, let's consider the possible distributions of the 3 vertices into the 5 components. Each distribution corresponds to a way of adding 0,1,2, or 3 vertices to each component. Since the 3 vertices are distinguishable, the number of ways to assign them is 5^3 = 125, but each assignment leads to a certain distribution of counts.

Alternatively, perhaps we can group the assignments by the distribution of the counts. For example, all assignments where two vertices go to component 1 and one goes to component 2, etc.

So, the possible distributions of the 3 additional vertices into the 5 components can be categorized by the integer partitions of 3 into at most 5 parts, where each part is the number of vertices added to each component.

The possible distributions are:

1. (3,0,0,0,0): one component gets all 3 additional vertices, the others get none.

2. (2,1,0,0,0): one component gets 2, another gets 1, the rest get none.

3. (1,1,1,0,0): three components each get 1 additional vertex.

These are all the possible ways to distribute 3 identical items into 5 distinct boxes, but since the vertices are distinguishable, the counts are a bit different. Wait, but in our case, the vertices are labeled, so the assignments are ordered. Hmm, perhaps this complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the multinomial coefficients.

Let me try to approach this using multinomial coefficients.

The number of ways to assign the 3 vertices to the 5 components is 5^3 = 125.

Each assignment corresponds to a function f: {6,7,8} → {1,2,3,4,5}, where f(v) is the component that vertex v is assigned to.

For each such function f, we can compute the number of trees as the product over each component i of (1 + c_i)^{ (1 + c_i) - 2 }, where c_i is the number of vertices assigned to component i (excluding the initial one). Wait, but no, because each component i starts with 1 vertex (v_i), and gets c_i additional vertices, so the total size is 1 + c_i.

So, the number of trees for component i is (1 + c_i)^{ (1 + c_i) - 2 } = (1 + c_i)^{ c_i -1 }.

Therefore, the total number of forests for a given function f is the product over i of (1 + c_i)^{ c_i -1 }, where c_i is the number of vertices assigned to component i.

Now, the total number of forests is the sum over all possible functions f of the product over i of (1 + c_i)^{ c_i -1 }.

But since the functions f are based on the assignments of the 3 vertices, and each assignment leads to a certain c_i, perhaps we can compute this sum by considering the possible distributions of the 3 vertices among the 5 components.

Let me consider each possible distribution of the 3 vertices among the 5 components and compute the corresponding product.

Case 1: All 3 vertices are assigned to the same component.

There are C(5,1) =5 ways to choose which component gets all 3.

For each such assignment, c_i =3 for that component, and c_j=0 for others.

The product becomes (1 +3)^{3 -1} * product for other components (1 +0)^{0 -1} }

Wait, but (1+0)^{-1} is 1^(-1)=1, so it's fine.

So, for this component, (4)^{2} =16, and for the other 4 components, each contributes 1^{ -1 }=1. So the total for this case is 5 * 16 =80.

Wait, but wait: For each component, when c_i=3, the number of trees is (1+3)^{3-1}=4^2=16. And for other components where c_i=0, the number is (1+0)^{0-1}=1^{-1}=1. So yes, each such assignment contributes 16 * 1^4 =16, and there are 5 such assignments, so 5*16=80.

Case 2: Two vertices assigned to one component, and one vertex assigned to another.

The number of ways to choose which two components get the vertices: C(5,2) ways to choose the two components, and then for each pair, the number of functions where two vertices go to one and one vertex goes to the other.

Wait, but actually, the number of such functions is C(5,2) * [ C(3,2) * C(1,1) ].

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, for each choice of two distinct components A and B, the number of ways to assign two vertices to A and one to B is C(3,2) =3. So for each pair (A,B), there are 3 assignments.

So the total number of assignments in this case is C(5,2)*3 =10 *3=30.

For each such assignment, the product is (1+2)^{2-1} * (1+1)^{1-1} * product for other components (1+0)^{0-1}.

Calculating each part:

For component A: (3)^{1}=3.

For component B: (2)^{0}=1.

Other components: each contributes 1^{-1}=1.

So the total for each assignment is 3 *1 *1^3=3.

Therefore, the total for this case is 30 *3=90.

Case 3: Each of three different components gets exactly one vertex.

The number of ways to choose three distinct components from 5: C(5,3)=10.

For each such trio, the number of ways to assign each of the three vertices to a different component is 3! =6, since the vertices are distinguishable.

So the total number of assignments here is 10 *6=60.

For each assignment, the product is:

For each of the three chosen components, (1+1)^{1-1}=2^0=1.

For the other two components, (1+0)^{-1}=1.

So the product is 1^3 *1^2=1.

Therefore, each assignment in this case contributes 1, so the total for this case is 60 *1=60.

Now, adding up all the cases:

Case 1:80

Case 2:90

Case3:60

Total: 80+90=170, 170+60=230.

Wait, but that's only 230, but looking at the options, the closest is option C:220, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Case 1: All 3 vertices assigned to one component.

Number of ways:5.

For each, the product is 4^2=16.

So 5 *16=80. That's correct.

Case2: Two vertices to one component, one to another.

Number of ways: C(5,2)=10 ways to choose the two components. For each pair, the number of assignments is C(3,2)=3. So total 10*3=30.

Each assignment contributes 3 (from the component with 2 added) *1 (from the component with 1 added) *1 for others. So each contributes 3.

So 30 *3=90. That seems correct.

Case3: Each vertex assigned to a different component, choosing 3 out of 5.

Number of ways: C(5,3)=10. For each trio, number of assignments is 3! =6, since each vertex is assigned to a distinct component. So total 10*6=60.

Each assignment contributes 1 for each component, so 60 *1=60.

Adding them up:80+90=170, 170+60=230.

Hmm, but the options don't include 230. The closest option is C:220, but that's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the initial assumption that each of the components with 1 vertex contributes 1 is correct, but perhaps the way I'm calculating the product is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Each time a component gets s_i additional vertices, the number of trees is (1 + s_i)^{ (1 + s_i) -2 } = (1 + s_i)^{ s_i -1 }.

So for case 1: s_i=3 for one component, so 4^{2}=16, others have s_i=0, so 1^{-1}=1. So 16 *1^4=16. 5*16=80. That's correct.

Case2: One component gets s_i=2, another gets s_i=1, others 0.

So the product is 3^{1} *2^{0}=3*1=3. Number of such assignments: C(5,2)*3=30. So 30*3=90. That's correct.

Case3: Three components get s_i=1 each. So each contributes 2^{0}=1. So the product is 1*1*1=1. Number of assignments:60. So 60*1=60.

Total:80+90+60=230.

But none of the options is 230. The options are A:620, B:520, C:220, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that each component with one vertex contributes 1 tree. Wait, no, because a single vertex is a tree, and the number of trees on 1 vertex is 1, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total number of forests is not just the sum over all assignments multiplied by the product of trees per component, but perhaps there's another factor involved, such as the number of ways to connect the additional vertices to the existing ones.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because when you add a vertex to a tree, you can connect it in multiple ways, but the number of trees on s_i vertices is s_i^{s_i -2}, which accounts for all possible labeled trees, so perhaps my initial approach was correct.

But since the total I'm getting is 230, which isn't an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial 5 components each have one vertex, and the 3 additional vertices can be connected in any way, but perhaps the formula for the number of labeled forests is different.

Wait, another approach: The number of labeled forests with k trees on n vertices is given by the formula:

k * C(n-1, k-1) * n^{n - k - 1}

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula that the number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is equal to the number of ways to choose the roots and then the trees.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

The number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is equal to C(n, k) * k * n^{n - k - 1} }

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the exponential generating function approach.

Wait, perhaps the exponential generating function for forests is F(x) = e^{T(x)}, where T(x) is the exponential generating function for trees. Since T(x) = sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{n-2} x^n /n! }, then F(x) = e^{T(x)}.

But I'm not sure how to use this to find the coefficient for x^8 /8! when we have exactly 5 trees.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of labeled forests with exactly 5 trees on 8 vertices is given by:

C(8-1,5-1) * 8^{8-5-1} } *5

Wait, that would be C(7,4)*8^{2} *5 = 35 *64 *5 = 35*320=11200, which is way too high, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. I remember that the number of labeled forests with k trees on n vertices is equal to the number of ways to choose k roots, then the number of trees is the product over each root's tree.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Number of labeled forests = C(n, k) * k * n^{n - k -1} }

So for n=8, k=5, that would be C(8,5)*5 *8^{8-5-1} = 56 *5 *8^{2} =56*5*64=56*320=17920, which is way too high, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached using inclusion-exclusion. We need to count the number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 components, where vertices 1-5 are each in separate components.

Wait, perhaps the total number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 components is C(8-1,5-1) *8^{8-5-1} *5! ?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the number is given by the formula:

Number of forests = sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) * k! * S(n, k) }, where S(n, k) is the number of ways to have k trees. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the number of labeled forests with k trees on n vertices as:

(n-1 choose k-1) * n^{n -k -1}

Wait, for n=8, k=5: (7 choose 4) *8^{8-5-1}=35 *8^{2}=35*64=2240.

But that's the total number of forests with 5 components on 8 vertices, without considering the condition that vertices 1-5 are in separate components.

But the problem requires that vertices 1-5 are each in different components. So perhaps we can compute the number of such forests by considering the constraints.

Wait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to counting the number of labeled forests with 5 components where each of the first 5 vertices is in its own component, and the remaining 3 can be in any component.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows: We have 5 components, each containing one of the vertices 1-5, and the remaining 3 vertices (6,7,8) can be assigned to any of these 5 components. Each such assignment defines the forest, and the number of such forests is the sum over all possible assignments of the product of the number of trees for each component.

Wait, but earlier I calculated this as 230, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial formula that directly counts the number of such forests.

Wait, another idea: The number of ways to have a forest with 5 components where each of the first 5 vertices is in its own component is equal to the number of ways to partition the remaining 3 vertices into the 5 components, multiplied by the number of trees each component can form.

But perhaps the number of such forests is equal to the number of ways to assign the 3 vertices to the 5 components, multiplied by the product for each component of the number of trees on that component's size.

As I did before, which gave 230, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each component must be a tree, so when assigning the additional vertices, each addition must connect to the existing tree in that component. But the number of ways to connect a new vertex to a tree with s vertices is s, because you can connect it to any of the s existing vertices.

Wait, so perhaps the number of trees for a component that starts with 1 vertex and gets s additional vertices is s! multiplied by the number of labeled trees on (1+s) vertices. Wait, no, because the number of labeled trees on (1+s) vertices is (1+s)^{ (1+s) -2 } }.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each possible distribution of the 3 vertices into the 5 components, the number of ways to build the trees, considering the order in which vertices are added.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the multinomial theorem.

Wait, perhaps the number of labeled forests where vertices 1-5 are each in their own component is equal to the number of ways to assign the remaining 3 vertices to the 5 components, multiplied by the product for each component of (number of trees on that component's size).

Which brings me back to the earlier approach, which gave 230, but that's not an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, perhaps the error is that in my initial approach, I considered the assignments as if the vertices are distinguishable, but perhaps I should have considered them as indistinct. Wait, no, the vertices are labeled, so each assignment is unique.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the exponential generating function. The exponential generating function for trees is T(x) = sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{n-2} x^n /n!}, and the exponential generating function for forests is F(x) = e^{T(x)}, since a forest is a set of trees.

But I'm not sure how to extract the coefficient for x^8 with exactly 5 trees.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of labeled forests with exactly 5 trees on 8 vertices is given by:

F_5(8) = C(8,5) * 5! * something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways to have 5 trees, each containing at least one of the vertices 1-5, and the rest of the vertices (6,7,8) can be in any tree.

Wait, so each of the 5 trees must contain exactly one of the vertices 1-5, and the remaining 3 vertices can be distributed among these 5 trees.

The number of ways to distribute the 3 vertices among the 5 trees is 5^3 =125.

But for each distribution, the number of labeled forests is the product over each tree of the number of trees on the size of that tree.

So, for each tree i, which has size s_i (which is 1 + number of assigned vertices), the number of trees is s_i^{s_i -2}.

Therefore, the total number of forests is the sum over all possible distributions of the product of s_i^{s_i -2} for each tree.

Which is the same as the earlier approach, giving 230, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is that I'm not accounting for the fact that the initial component for each vertex 1-5 is a single vertex, and when adding more vertices, the number of ways to form the tree increases.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that for each component, the number of labeled trees on s_i vertices is s_i^{s_i -2}, and since the components are labeled, the total number is the product of these for each component.

So, the total number of forests is the sum over all possible distributions of the 3 vertices into the 5 components of the product of s_i^{s_i -2} for each component.

But that's what I did before, leading to 230, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 230, but since it's not among the options, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached using the inclusion-exclusion principle, considering the constraints that vertices 1-5 are in separate components.

The total number of forests on 8 vertices with 5 components is C(8,5) * 5! * something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such forests is equal to the number of ways to assign each of the 3 remaining vertices to any of the 5 components, multiplied by the number of trees for each component.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 820, which is option E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as follows: The number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 components where vertices 1-5 are each in separate components is equal to the number of ways to assign the remaining 3 vertices to the 5 components, multiplied by the number of trees for each component.

But earlier, that approach gave 230, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another idea: The number of ways to assign the 3 vertices to the 5 components is 5^3=125, and for each such assignment, the number of forests is the product for each component i of (number of trees on s_i vertices), where s_i is the size of component i (including the initial one).

But wait, perhaps each component i has s_i vertices, and the number of trees is s_i^{s_i -2}.

So, the total is sum_{all assignments} product_{i=1 to 5} s_i^{s_i -2}.

But perhaps there's a generating function approach to compute this sum.

The exponential generating function for each component is T(x) = sum_{s=1}^\infty s^{s-2} x^s /s!}.

Since we have 5 components, the exponential generating function for the entire forest is [T(x)]^5.

But we need the coefficient of x^8 in this generating function, multiplied by 8!.

Wait, but since each component must have at least one vertex (the initial one), the generating function would be [T(x) - x]^5, because we subtract the x term to ensure each component has at least one vertex.

Wait, no, because each component already has one vertex, so the generating function for each component after that is T(x) starting from s=1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as each component i having 1 + c_i vertices, where c_i >=0.

So, the exponential generating function for each component is T(x) = sum_{c=0}^\infty (1 + c)^{ (1 + c) -2 } x^{1 + c} / (1 + c)!}.

Which simplifies to sum_{c=0}^\infty (1 + c)^{c -1} x^{1 + c} / (1 + c)!}.

But I'm not sure how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the exponential generating function for each component is sum_{s=1}^\infty s^{s-2} x^s /s!}.

So, the generating function for 5 components is [sum_{s=1}^\infty s^{s-2} x^s /s!}]^5.

We need the coefficient of x^8 /8! in this generating function, multiplied by 8!.

But calculating this manually is difficult, so perhaps I can look for a known value or find a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 components is 8^5 * C(8-1,5-1) }= 8^{5} * C(7,4) = 32768 * 35, which is way too big.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, I remember that the number of labeled forests on n vertices with k trees is equal to the number of spanning forests with k trees in a complete graph on n vertices, which is given by the formula:

k * C(n-1, k-1) * n^{n -k -1} }

Wait, for n=8, k=5:

Number of forests =5 * C(7,4) *8^{8-5-1}=5 *35 *8^2=5*35*64=5*2240=11200.

But that's the total number of forests with 5 components, without considering the constraint that vertices 1-5 are in separate components.

But the problem requires that vertices 1-5 are each in separate components. So perhaps the number we're looking for is the number of such forests where each of the first 5 vertices is in its own component, and the remaining 3 can be in any component.

Wait, perhaps the number is equal to the number of ways to assign the 3 vertices to the 5 components, multiplied by the number of trees for each component.

Wait, but earlier that gave 230, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the number of labeled forests with specified components. Since each of the first 5 vertices is in its own component, the number of such forests is the product of the number of trees on each component, where each of the first 5 components has at least one vertex, and the remaining 3 vertices can be distributed among these 5 components.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Number of forests = (number of ways to distribute the 3 vertices) * product over each component of (number of trees on that component's size).

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 230, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 230, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 280, which is option J, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 5 components must have at least one vertex, and the remaining 3 can be distributed among them. So, the number of ways to distribute the 3 vertices is C(3 +5 -1,5 -1)=C(7,4)=35. But that's for indistinct objects, but since the vertices are labeled, it's different.

Wait, perhaps the number of ways to distribute 3 labeled vertices into 5 labeled boxes is 5^3=125, as I did before.

But then, for each distribution, the product is the number of trees for each component. So, perhaps the total is 125 multiplied by the average number of trees per distribution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 220, which is option C. But I'm not sure how to arrive at that number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the number of labeled forests where 5 specific vertices are each in their own component. So, the number is equal to the number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 components, multiplied by the probability that the first 5 vertices are each in separate components.

But I'm not sure how to compute that probability.

Wait, perhaps the number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 components where the first 5 vertices are each in their own component is equal to the number of ways to assign the remaining 3 vertices to the 5 components, multiplied by the product of the number of trees for each component.

Which brings me back to the earlier approach, leading to 230, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, I'll have to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the contributions for each case.

Let me re-examine the cases.

Case1: All 3 vertices assigned to one component.

Number of ways:5.

Each such assignment contributes (4)^{2}=16.

Total:5*16=80.

Case2: Two vertices assigned to one component, one to another.

Number of ways: C(5,2)=10 ways to choose the two components. For each pair, the number of ways to assign the vertices is C(3,2)=3, so 10*3=30.

Each such assignment contributes (3)^{1} * (2)^{0}=3*1=3.

Total:30*3=90.

Case3: Each of three different components gets one vertex.

Number of ways: C(5,3)=10 ways to choose the three components. For each trio, the number of ways to assign the three vertices is 3!=6.

Total:10*6=60.

Each such assignment contributes (2)^{0} for each of the three components, which is 1*1*1=1.

Total:60*1=60.

Adding up:80+90=170+60=230.

Hmm, same result as before. Since 230 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest higher option is 280 (option J), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the number of labeled forests with specified roots.

Wait, perhaps the number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 components, each containing one of the vertices 1-5, is equal to the number of ways to assign the remaining 3 vertices to these components, multiplied by the number of trees for each component.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is more complex. Maybe it's given by:

Number of forests = C(8-5,3) * something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Given the time I've spent and the options available, I'll have to make an educated guess. The closest option to my calculation of 230 is option C:220, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:280.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when a component gets s_i additional vertices, the number of trees is s_i^{s_i}, but that doesn't make sense because for s_i=1, it would be 1^1=1, which is correct, but for s_i=2, it would be 2^2=4, which is incorrect because the number of trees on 3 vertices is 3, not 4.

Wait, perhaps I should abandon this approach and consider another method.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of forests with 5 components is F, and the number of forests where at least one of the vertices 1-5 is not in a separate component is subtracted.

But I'm not sure how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such forests is equal to the number of ways to choose 5 components, each containing one of the vertices 1-5, and then the remaining 3 vertices can be in any component.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of ways to assign the 3 vertices to the 5 components, multiplied by the product of the number of trees for each component.

Which again leads to 230, which isn't an option.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C:220, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of labeled forests with 5 components where each of the first 5 vertices is in its own component is equal to the number of ways to assign the remaining 3 vertices to the 5 components, multiplied by the product of the number of trees for each component, which is 5^3 * something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:220, which is close to my calculation of 230, but perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:280, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of such forests is equal to the number of ways to choose 5 components, each containing one of the first 5 vertices, and then the number of ways to connect the remaining 3 vertices to these components.

But I'm not making progress, so I'll have to make a guess. Based on the options, I think the correct answer is option C:220.

The problem involves determining the number of labeled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components, where vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 each belong to different connected components. The solution approach involves considering the distribution of the remaining 3 vertices (6, 7, 8) among the 5 components and calculating the number of trees for each distribution.

The key steps are:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each of the first 5 vertices must be in separate components, leaving 3 vertices to be distributed among these 5 components. Each component is a tree, and the number of trees on \( s \) vertices is \( s^{s-2} \).

2. **Distributing the Remaining Vertices**: The 3 vertices can be assigned to the 5 components in various ways, leading to different distributions:
   - **Case 1**: All 3 vertices assigned to one component.
   - **Case 2**: Two vertices assigned to one component, one to another.
   - **Case 3**: Each of three different components gets one vertex.

3. **Calculating Contributions for Each Case**:
   - **Case 1**: 5 ways to choose the component, each contributing \( 4^2 = 16 \), totaling \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \).
   - **Case 2**: 30 ways to assign vertices, each contributing \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \), totaling \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \).
   - **Case 3**: 60 ways to assign vertices, each contributing \( 1 \), totaling \( 60 \times 1 = 60 \).

4. **Summing Contributions**: Adding the totals from all cases gives \( 80 + 90 + 60 = 230 \). However, this value is not among the provided options.

5. **Revisiting the Options**: Given the calculated value of 230 and the provided options, the closest plausible answer is **C: 220**, suggesting a possible minor miscalculation or oversight in the approach.
