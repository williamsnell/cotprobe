Okay, so I've got this question about Kohlberg's cognitive-developmental theory and the initial stage of gender-role acquisition. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember Kohlberg's theory is about how children develop gender roles. He proposed a few stages, right? I think the initial stage is when kids first become aware of gender. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A through J. Let's see each one:

A: gender identity. I think this is more about knowing oneself as male or female, but is that the initial stage? Maybe it's a bit later.

B: gender neutrality. That sounds like not noticing gender differences, but I'm not sure if that's the starting point.

C: gender assimilation. Hmm, that might be about adopting gender roles, which could be a later stage.

D: gender fluidity. That's more modern, about flexible gender identities, probably not what Kohlberg said.

E: gender affirmation. That's about confirming one's gender, maybe after they've already established it.

F: gender stability. I think this is when kids understand that their gender doesn't change, which is a later stage than the initial.

G: gender awareness. Oh, that sounds like the first step. It's about being aware of gender as a concept, like knowing boys and girls are different.

H: gender differentiation. This might come after awareness, when they start recognizing differences between genders.

I: gender preference. That's when they prefer toys or activities typical of their gender, which I think is a step after awareness and differentiation.

J: gender constancy. Wait, that's when they understand their own gender is stable and won't change, which is a later stage than initial.

So, putting it together, the initial stage should be when they first become aware of gender. That's G: gender awareness. But wait, I thought Kohlberg's first stage was gender identity. No, wait, Kohlberg's stages are: 1) gender identity, 2) gender stability, then 3) gender constancy. But the question is about the initial stage of gender-role acquisition. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing with other theories. Let me think again. Kohlberg's first stage is gender identity, where children can label themselves as boy or girl. But some sources say the initial stage is gender awareness, which comes before they can label themselves. So perhaps the first stage is when they start to notice gender differences, which would be gender awareness. Or maybe it's gender identity as the first stage.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. Kohlberg's stages: 1. Gender Identity (knowing self as male/female), 2. Gender Stability (understanding others' genders remain same), 3. Gender Constancy (knowing own gender is stable). So the initial stage is gender identity. But the question is about the initial stage of acquisition. Maybe it's gender awareness, which is before identity.

Wait, but the options don't have gender identity as the first. Wait, the options are A: gender identity, which would be stage 1. But the question is about the initial stage, so maybe that's A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it differently. The initial stage is when they first start to understand gender. So that's likely gender awareness. So option G. Or is it gender identity?

Wait, another angle: gender identity is about self-identity as male or female, which is the first stage. So the initial stage is gender identity, which is option A. But the question is about gender-role acquisition, which might involve more than just knowing oneself. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial stage is when they start to notice gender differences, which is gender awareness. So G. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the first stage is gender identity, which is about their own gender, but not necessarily the role acquisition part.

I think I need to go with what I remember. Kohlberg's first stage is gender identity. So the answer would be A. But wait, the question is about the initial stage of gender-role acquisition. Maybe it's when they start to show preferences, but that's gender preference, option I. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the initial stage is gender differentiation, where they start to apply gender labels to others. So H. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the initial stage is when they start to show awareness of gender, which is gender awareness, G. I think that's more likely because before they can label themselves, they must be aware of gender as a concept.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't look it up. But I remember that the first stage is gender identity, so the answer is A. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's gender awareness because that's the first step before they can identify themselves.

Hmm. I think I'll go with gender identity as the initial stage, so A.

The initial stage of gender-role acquisition in Kohlberg's cognitive-developmental theory is **gender identity**, where children first recognize and label themselves as male or female. This is considered the starting point of their understanding of gender roles. 

Answer: A
