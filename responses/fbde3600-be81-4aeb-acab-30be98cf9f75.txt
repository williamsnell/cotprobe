Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about discount series and comparing them to a single rate. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question has two parts, but wait, no, actually, it's part (a) and part (b). Let me read it again.

Part (a): We have two discount series, 30-10-2(1/2)% and 25-15-2%. I need to determine which is better. Also, the options are labeled A to J, each pairing one series with a single rate. So part (a) will probably involve calculating the equivalent discount rates for each series and comparing them to the given rates.

Part (b): We have a discount series of 15-15% and a single rate of 30%. Again, we need to determine which is better.

Wait, perhaps I should handle each part separately. Let me start with part (a).

So, the first discount series is 30-10-2(1/2)%. Wait, the notation is a bit tricky. I think the first part is the initial discount, then another, and then a third. But I'm not sure about the exact way the discounts are applied. Wait, maybe it's the first discount is 30%, then another 10%, then 2%, and then a (1/2)%? Or maybe the (1/2)% is a third discount? Or perhaps it's a series of discounts that are applied successively.

Wait, I think the notation is something like (D1, D2, D3, etc.), each representing the discount rates for each period. So for a series, it's the sum of the present value factors. Alternatively, the series is a series of successive discounts. So for example, a 30-10-2(1/2)% series would mean that each discount is applied in sequence.

Wait, maybe I should model each series as a series of cash flows. Let me think. Each discount series is a series of equal time periods, with each period having a discount. So the first discount is 30%, which would mean the present value is 70% of the original amount. Then the next discount is 10%, so another 90% of the current value, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps the series is a series of discounts that are applied cumulatively. Wait, maybe I should convert each discount series into an equivalent single discount rate and then compare.

Wait, I remember that a series of discounts can be converted into an equivalent single discount using the formula:

(1 - (1 - d1)(1 - d2)(1 - d3)...(1 - dn))

Where d1, d2, etc., are the discount rates. Alternatively, I might have that backward, but I think that's the way to go.

So for part (a), the first series is 30-10-2(1/2)%.

Wait, the notation is 30-10-2(1/2)%, which I think means that the first discount is 30%, then 10%, then 2%, and then a (1/2)% which I'm not sure about. Wait, that last part might mean a fraction. So maybe the series is 30%, 10%, 2%, and then 0.5%. So four discounts? Or perhaps each discount is applied in succession.

Wait, perhaps it's a series of four discounts: 30%, 10%, 2%, and 0.5%. So each subsequent discount is applied on the remaining amount after the previous discount.

Alternatively, perhaps (1/2)% is a third component, but that seems unlikely. Maybe the notation is that the series is 30%, 10%, 2%, and then (1/2)% as a fourth discount. Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2)% is part of a different calculation. Hmm, this is a bit confusing, maybe I should look up the standard way to calculate discount series.

Wait, I think the standard approach is that each discount is applied in sequence. So, for a series, the present value factor is the product of (1 - d_i) for each discount period i. But wait, let's think in terms of present value. The series of discounts would be applied as a series of returns. Alternatively, maybe the series is a series of cash flows where each is a discount. So, the first discount is 30%, so we receive 0.70 of the initial amount. Then, the next discount is 10%, so 0.90 of that. Then 2%, 0.98, etc. Or wait, perhaps each discount is a return, so we receive a cash flow equal to the discount. So maybe the series is 30%, 10%, 2%, and then 0.5%. So each cash flow is in the order of the discount applied. So the first period's discount is 30%, so we receive 30% of the amount, then the second period's discount is 10%, so we receive 10% of what's left, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps the series is 30-10-2(1/2)% is a way of saying 30%, 10%, 2%, and 0.5%, each applied in sequence. So the present value factor would be (1 - 0.3) * (1 - 0.1) * (1 - 0.02) * (1 - 0.005).

Let me compute that.

First, let's calculate each (1 - d) factor:

30% discount: 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

10%: 0.9

2%: 0.98

0.5%: 0.995

So multiply all these together:

0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63

0.63 * 0.98 = let's calculate that. 0.63 * 0.98: 0.63*(1-0.02) = 0.63 - 0.0126 = 0.6174.

Then, 0.6174 * 0.995. Let's compute that:

0.6174 * 0.995 = 0.6174 * (1 - 0.005) = 0.6174 - (0.6174 * 0.005) = 0.6174 - 0.003087 = 0.614313.

So the present value factor is approximately 0.6143, meaning the equivalent single discount is 1 - 0.6143 = 0.3857 or 38.57%. Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to compute the equivalent single rate is to calculate the total discount and express it as a single rate.

Total discount is 1 - (1 - d1)(1 - d2)(1 - d3)... So in this case, 1 - 0.7*0.9*0.98*0.995 â‰ˆ 0.6143, so the discount is 0.3857, so 38.57%.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the equivalent single discount differently. Let me think: the present value factor is 0.6143, which is the same as (1 - r), so r is 0.3857, which is 38.57%.

So for the first series, the equivalent single rate is about 38.57%.

Now, the second series is 25-15-2%. So applying the same approach.

Each discount is applied in sequence. So the factors are:

25%: 0.75

15%: 0.85

2%: 0.98

Multiply them together: 0.75 * 0.85 = 0.6375; 0.6375 * 0.98 = ?

0.6375 * 0.98: Let's compute that.

0.6375 * 0.98 = (0.6375 * 1) - (0.6375 * 0.02) = 0.6375 - 0.01275 = 0.62475.

Then, 0.62475 * 0.98: 0.62475 * 0.98 = same as 0.62475 * (1 - 0.02) = 0.62475 - (0.62475 * 0.02) = 0.62475 - 0.012495 = 0.612255.

So the present value factor is approximately 0.612255, so the equivalent single rate is 1 - 0.612255 = 0.387745, which is about 38.77%.

So comparing the two series:

First series: 38.57% equivalent rate.

Second series: 38.77% equivalent rate.

So the first series is better because it has a lower equivalent discount rate. So that would mean that the first series (30-10-2(1/2)%) is better than the second (25-15-2%).

Wait, but wait, the options are about which series is better. Let me check the options again.

Wait, part (a) is about which is better between the two series. So the first series (30-10-2(1/2)) has a better equivalent rate than the second (25-15-2). So which option states that? Let me look at the options provided.

Looking back at the options, option E says the series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better, but there's no difference between the series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%. So that's not correct because the second series (25-15-2%) has a better equivalent rate than 30%.

Wait, no. Wait, the second series (25-15-2%) had an equivalent rate of about 38.77%, which is higher than 38.57% for the first series. So the first series is better.

So in part (a), the better series is the first one (30-10-2(1/2)%), which is option E? Wait, no, option E says the series 30-10-2(1/2)% is better, and the single rate of 30% is the same. So that's probably correct.

Wait, but I need to make sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalent rate calculations. Let me recalculate.

First series: 30-10-2(1/2)%.

Each discount is applied in sequence.

(1 - 0.3) = 0.7.

(1 - 0.1) = 0.9.

(1 - 0.02) = 0.98.

(1 - 0.005) = 0.995.

Multiply all: 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63; 0.63 * 0.98 = 0.6174; 0.6174 * 0.995 = 0.614313.

So present value factor is 0.614313. So the equivalent single rate is 1 - 0.614313 = 0.385687, which is 38.5687% equivalent discount. So about 38.57%.

Second series: 25-15-2%.

(1 - 0.25) = 0.75.

(1 - 0.15)=0.85.

(1 - 0.02)=0.98.

Multiply all: 0.75 * 0.85 = 0.6375; 0.6375 * 0.98=0.62475; 0.62475 * 0.98=0.612255.

So present value factor is 0.612255, so equivalent rate is 1 - 0.612255 = 0.387745, about 38.77%.

So series 1 is better because it has a lower equivalent rate.

So for part (a), the better series is the first one (30-10-2(1/2)%), and the single rate of 30% is not better, because the first series is better.

Wait, the options are about which series is better. The options for part (a) are:

A: 30-10-2(1/2)% and single 25%

B: single 25% and 15-15%

C: series 30-10-2% and 15-15%

D: series 25-15-2% and 30%

E: series 30-10-2% is better, and 30% single rate is same as series.

Wait, no. Looking at the options again:

Looking at option E: "The series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the single rate of 30% are better". So that would mean that the first series is better than the single 30%. But our calculation shows that the first series is better than the second, which has a better equivalent rate (38.77% vs 38.57%). So the first series is better, but the second series is worse than the first, but better than the single 30%?

Wait, no, the second series has a better equivalent rate than the single 30%. So the first series is better than the second, but worse than the single 30%.

Hmm, so the options are:

Option E says the first series is better and the single rate is 30%. But that's incorrect because the first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

Wait, no. The first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

Wait, let me think again. The equivalent rates:

First series: ~38.57%

Second series: ~38.77%

Single 30%: 30%.

So the first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

So in part (a), the better series is the first (30-10-2(1/2)%), which is better than the second.

So looking at the options, which one says the first series is better and the single 30% is worse than the first? Option E says it's better, and the single 30% is the same. So that's not correct. Because the first series is better than the single 30%.

Wait, perhaps the options are about which is better when compared to a single rate. So part (a) is about comparing two series and a single rate.

Wait, the options are about which series is better, but part (a) is part of the question. Wait, let me read the question again.

The question is:

(a) Given the two discount series of 30-10-2(1/2)% and 25-15-2%, which is better?

(b) Given the discount series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%, which is better?

So each part is (a) and (b). So for part (a), we're looking at two series and comparing to a single rate, but in the options, perhaps part (a) is about which one is better between the two series and the single rate.

Wait, perhaps the options are about whether each series is better than the single rate. So for part (a), which series is better than the single rate of 30%?

Wait, the equivalent rates I calculated were:

First series: ~38.57% (so better than 30%).

Second series: ~38.77% (also better than 30%).

So both are better than 30%. But the first is better than the second.

So for part (a), the better series is the first one. So the option that says the first series is better than the single 30% would be correct.

Wait, let me look at the options:

Option E: "The series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the single rate of 30% are better." So this suggests that the first series is better than the single 30%, and the single 30% is better than the second series. But that's incorrect because the first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

Wait, no, the first series is better than the second series, which is better than the single 30%? No, the second series has an equivalent rate of 38.77%, which is worse than 38.57% of the first. So the first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

Wait, so the options for part (a) are comparing these two series to the single 30%. So which series is better in each case?

Wait, perhaps the options are about which one is better than the other. Let me re-read the options.

Looking at the options for part (a):

A: 30-10-2(1/2)% and single 25% are better.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because part (a) is asking whether each series is better than a single rate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach part (a) as a multiple-choice question, whether each series is better than a single rate.

Looking at the options for part (a):

The options are about which of the two series is better than each of the given single rates. Wait, perhaps the options are in terms of which series is better than the given options.

Wait, the options for part (a) are:

A: The series 30-10-2(1/2) and the single 25% are better.

B: The series 30-10-2(1/2) and the series 15-15 are better.

C: The series 30-10-2 and the series 15-15 are better.

D: The series 25-15-2 and the single 30% are better.

E: The series 30-10-2 and the single 30% are better.

Wait, but the question is part (a) is about which of the two series is better than the single 30%.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me rephrase the question.

(a) Given the two discount series, which is better than the single rate of 30%? So we need to compare each series to the single rate of 30% and see which is better.

Wait, but in the options, part (a) is about comparing each series to the single rate of 30%. So which series is better than the single 30%?

Wait, the series' equivalent rates are:

First series: ~38.57% (so better than 30%)

Second series: ~38.77% (worse than 30%)

Wait, wait, no. 38.57% is better than 30%, so the first series is better than the single 30%. The second series is worse than the single 30%? No, wait, 38.77% is worse than 38.57%, but the single 30% is worse than the second series. Wait no, the second series has a higher equivalent rate than the single 30%. So the second series is better than the single 30%. So both are better than the single 30%, but the first is better than the second.

So when the question is (a), which of the two series is better than the single 30%?

The options for part (a) are:

A: series 30-10-2% and single 25% are better.

B: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

C: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

D: series 25-15-2% and single 30% are better.

E: series 30-10-2% and single 30% are better.

So, wait, the question in part (a) is asking whether each series is better than the single 30% rate.

Wait, no, perhaps the options are about which series is better than the other options.

Wait, perhaps the options are about whether each series is better than each of the given options. But that's not how the options are phrased.

Wait, perhaps the options are about which of the two series is better than the single 30% rate. So the correct comparison is that the first series has a better equivalent rate than the single 30%, so it is better than the single 30%. The second series has a worse equivalent rate than the single 30%? No, wait, no.

Wait, no. The second series has an equivalent rate of 38.77%, which is better than 30%? No, wait, 38.77% is worse than 30% because 38.77% is more than 30% in terms of the discount rate. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a higher discount rate implies a higher return from the perspective of the discount.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because of the way the discount rates are structured. Let me reevaluate.

The discount rates are applied over the period. So each discount is a return on the investment. So the equivalent rate is the total return over the period.

So, the equivalent single rate is the total return. So, for the first series, the equivalent single rate is ~38.57%, which is a higher return than the single 30% rate. So the first series is better.

The second series has a better equivalent rate than the single 30%? No, wait, the second series has a better equivalent rate (38.77%) than the single 30% (30%). Wait, no, 38.77% is better than 30%, because 38.77% is higher than 30% in terms of the return. So the second series is better than the single 30% rate.

Wait, so in part (a), the first series is better than the single 30% and the second series is also better than the single 30% but worse than the first. So the first series is better than the second, which in turn is better than the single 30%.

Wait, so the options for part (a) are about which of the two series is better than the single 30%.

Looking at the options:

A: series 30-10-2% and single 25% are better.

B: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

C: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

D: series 25-15-2% and single 30% are better.

E: series 30-10-2% and single 30% are better.

Wait, maybe the options are not about the comparison but about which is better than the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about which one is better than the other, but in the context of the question.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on part (a) and part (b) separately.

In part (a), the question is: Given the two discount series of 30-10-2(1/2)% and 25-15-2%, which is better?

In part (b), the question is: Given the discount series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%, which is better?

So for part (a), let's focus on which series is better between the two.

Looking at the equivalent rates:

First series: ~38.57%

Second series: ~38.77%

So the first series has a lower equivalent rate, which means it's better than the second series.

So the first series is better than the second series.

So for part (a), the better series is the first one (30-10-2(1/2)%).

Now, for part (b): Given the discount series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%, which is better.

Compute the equivalent rate of 15-15%:

Each discount is 15%, so present value factor is 0.85 for each period.

Multiply them: 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225.

So the equivalent rate is 1 - 0.7225 = 0.2775, which is 27.75%.

The single rate is 30%, which is 30%.

So 27.75% is better than 30%. So the series 15-15% is better than the single 30%.

So in part (b), the better series is 15-15% and the single 30% is worse than the series.

Wait, but the options for part (b) are not given in the problem statement. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should just focus on part (a) and part (b) separately.

In part (a), the better series is the first one, which is better than the second one.

In part (b), the better series is the 15-15% series, and the single 30% is worse than that.

But the options for part (a) and part (b) are not given in the problem statement. So I'm not sure.

Well, I think I've spent a lot of time on this, so perhaps I should proceed with the calculations and the options.

So for part (a), the first series is better than the second.

So in the options, I'm looking for whether the first series is better than the second, and the options for part (a) are about which is better than which.

Wait, the options are:

A: series 30-10-2% and single 25% are better.

B: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

C: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

D: series 25-15-2% and single 30% are better.

E: series 30-10-2% and single 30% are better.

Wait, perhaps part (a) is about which series is better than the single 30%, and part (b) is about which is better than the single 30% as well.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps part (a) is about which series is better than the single 30%, and part (b) is about which series is better than the single 30%.

In that case, the first series is better than the single 30%, so option E says that. But the second series is also better than the single 30% because its equivalent rate is 38.77% which is higher than 30%, so it's better than the single 30%.

Wait, but the question is part (a), which is to compare the two discount series with the single rate of 30%, and part (b) is to compare the discount series 15-15% with the single rate of 30%.

So perhaps the options are about which of the two discount series is better than the single rate of 30%.

Wait, but in the options, part (a) is about comparing each series to the single 30%, and part (b) is about comparing the 15-15% series to the single 30%.

Hmm, but given the options, perhaps for part (a), the first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

So the first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

So in part (a), the better series is the first one.

Wait, but looking at the options, part (a) is about which is better than the single 30%, and part (b) is about which is better than the single 30%.

Wait, no. The options for part (a) are about which of the two series is better than the single 30%, and part (b) is about which is better than the single 30%.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about which of the discount series is better than the single 30% rate.

So for part (a), the question is: Which discount series is better than the single 30% rate?

The options for part (a) are:

A: series 30-10-2% and single 25% are better.

B: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

C: series 30-10-2% and series 15-15% are better.

D: series 25-15-2% and single 30% are better.

E: series 30-10-2% and single 30% are better.

Wait, perhaps the options are about which series is better than the single 30% rate.

But without more context, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about which series is better than which single rate.

So, perhaps for part (a), the first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

In part (b), the 15-15% series is better than the single 30%.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the calculations.

So first, for part (a), the two discount series are 30-10-2(1/2)% and 25-15-2%.

We calculated their equivalent rates as 38.57% and 38.77% respectively.

So both are better than the single 30% rate of 30%.

The first series is better than the second, which is better than the single 30%.

So for part (a), the better series is the first one.

Now, for part (b), the discount series is 15-15%, and the single rate is 30%.

We calculated the equivalent rate for 15-15% as ~27.75%.

So 27.75% is better than 30%.

So the 15-15% series is better than the single 30%.

So in part (b), the better series is 15-15% and the single 30% is worse than the series.

But I'm not sure about the options for part (b).

Alternatively, perhaps the options for part (a) are about which series is better than the single 30% rate, and part (b) is about which series is better than the single 30% rate.

In that case, perhaps the options are correct.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that.

So for part (a), the better series is the first one (30-10-2(1/2)%), which is better than the second series (25-15-2%).

In part (b), the better series is the 15-15% series, which is better than the single 30% rate.

But I'm not sure if the options provided are correct.
