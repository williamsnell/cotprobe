D: 4.66g of Ni
E: 8.5g of Ni
F: 12.48g of Ni

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this electroplating problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the weight of nickel metal deposited on the cathode when a current of 4.02 amperes flows for 1000 minutes. The solution contains Ni²+ ions. Hmm, I remember that electroplating involves using electrical current to deposit metal ions onto a surface. So, the cathode is where reduction happens, right? So Ni²+ ions will gain electrons and be reduced to metallic nickel.

I think I need to use Faraday's laws of electrolysis here. Faraday's first law states that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the amount of electricity used. The formula I recall is:

Weight deposited (in grams) = (Current × Time × Molar Mass) / (1000 × Faraday's constant × n)

Where:
- Current (I) is in amperes,
- Time (t) is in seconds,
- Molar mass (M) of nickel is needed,
- Faraday's constant (F) is approximately 96485 C/mol,
- n is the number of electrons transferred per ion.

First, let's note the given values:
- Current, I = 4.02 A
- Time, t = 1000 minutes. Oh wait, I need to convert that to seconds. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, 1000 minutes is 1000 × 60 = 60,000 seconds.

The molar mass of nickel (Ni) is about 58.69 g/mol. I think that's right; nickel's atomic weight is around 58.7.

Now, the number of electrons (n) for Ni²+ ions. Nickel has a +2 charge, so each Ni²+ ion will gain 2 electrons to become Ni metal. So n=2.

Putting it all together, let's plug the numbers into the formula.

Wait, just to make sure, the formula rearranges as:

Weight (g) = (I × t × M) / (1000 × F × n)

So substituting the numbers:

I = 4.02 A
t = 60,000 s
M = 58.69 g/mol
F = 96485 C/mol
n = 2

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, multiply I × t: 4.02 × 60,000. Let me do that:

4.02 × 6e4 = 4.02 × 60,000 = 241,200 C (since current × time gives coulombs).

Then, multiply by M: 241200 × 58.69. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute that. Wait, maybe I should compute it as 241200 * 58.69. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 241200 × 58.69 step by step.

Wait, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me compute the numerator first: I*t*M = 4.02 * 60000 * 58.69.

Let me compute 4.02 * 60000 first. 4 * 60000 is 240,000, 0.02*60000 is 1,200, so total is 241,200, as I had earlier.

Now, 241,200 * 58.69. Let me compute that:

Well, 241,200 × 50 = 12,060,000
241,200 × 8 = 1,929,600
241,200 × 0.69 = let's see, 241200 * 0.6 = 144,720, and 241200 *0.09=21,708. So total 144,720 +21,708=166,428.

Adding all together: 12,060,000 + 1,929,600 = 13,989,600; plus 166,428 gives 14,156,028.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to do 241200 ×58.69.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

58.69 × 241200 = ?

Wait, maybe I should compute 58.69 ×241200.

Let me break 58.69 into 50 + 8 + 0.69.

So:

50 ×241200 = 12,060,000
8 ×241200 = 1,929,600
0.69 ×241200 = let's calculate 241200 ×0.69.

241200 ×0.6 = 144,720
241200 ×0.09 = 21,708
So 144,720 +21,708 = 166,428.

Now sum all three parts:

12,060,000 +1,929,600 =13,989,600
13,989,600 +166,428 =14,156,028.

So the numerator is 14,156,028.

Now, the denominator is 1000 × F ×n. F is 96485 C/mol, n=2.

So denominator: 1000 ×96485 ×2 = 1000 ×192,970 =192,970,000.

So weight = 14,156,028 / 192,970,000.

Let me compute that division.

14,156,028 ÷192,970,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this by converting both numerator and denominator into scientific notation or by seeing how many times 192 million goes into 14 million.

Alternatively, I can compute it as a decimal.

14,156,028 ÷192,970,000 ≈ let me approximate.

Well, 192,970,000 is approximately 1.9297e8, and 14,156,028 is ~1.4156e7.

So 1.4156e7 / 1.9297e8 = (1.4156 / 1.9297) × 1e-1 ≈ (0.733) ×0.1 = 0.0733 grams? That can't be right because the options are in grams, and 0.0733g would be way too small. I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check my earlier steps. Maybe I messed up the units or the formula.

Wait, the formula I used was:

Weight = (I × t × M) / (1000 × F × n)

Wait, but I think I might have confused the order. Let me double-check the formula.

Faraday's law is:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F × 1000)

Wait, no, wait. Let me recall correctly. The formula is:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F)

But wait, I think the correct formula is:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F) × (1/1000) because when you have coulombs, and F is in C/mol, and I is in A (C/s), so the units need to be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the proper units.

Let me think again.

Faraday's first law: Q = n × F × m / M

Where Q is the charge in coulombs, n is the number of electrons, F is Faraday's constant, m is the mass in grams, and M is the molar mass in g/mol.

Rearranging, m = (Q × M) / (n × F)

But Q is I × t. So,

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F)

But I need to make sure all the units are correct. I is in amperes (A), t in seconds (s), so Q = I × t is in coulombs (C), which is correct.

So, substituting the values:

I = 4.02 A
t = 60,000 s
M = 58.69 g/mol
n = 2
F = 96485 C/mol

So,

m = (4.02 × 60,000 × 58.69) / (2 × 96485)

Let me compute the numerator first: 4.02 ×60,000 =241,200.

241,200 ×58.69 = ?

Let me compute 241,200 ×58,690 (since 58.69 is 58690 ×1e-3) but perhaps I should just compute 241,200 ×58.69.

Hmm, 241,200 ×58.69: Let me break it down.

241,200 ×50 =12,060,000
241,200 ×8 =1,929,600
241,200 ×0.69 = let's see, 241,200 ×0.6=144,720; 241,200 ×0.09=21,708. So total 144,720+21,708=166,428.

Now add them up:

12,060,000 +1,929,600 =13,989,600
13,989,600 +166,428 =14,156,028.

So numerator is 14,156,028.

Denominator is 2 ×96485 =192,970.

So m =14,156,028 /192,970.

Let me compute that division.

14,156,028 ÷192,970 ≈ let's see.

First, see how many times 192,970 fits into 14,156,028.

192,970 ×70 =13,507,900 (because 192,970 ×70 =192,970 ×7 ×10=1,350,790 ×10=13,507,900).

Subtract that from the numerator:

14,156,028 -13,507,900 =648,128.

Now, how many times does 192,970 go into 648,128?

192,970 ×3 =578,910.

Subtract: 648,128 -578,910 =69,218.

Now, 192,970 ×0.36 ≈ 69,470 (since 192,970 ×0.3=57,891; 192,970 ×0.06=11,578.2; total 57,891+11,578.2=69,469.2).

So approximately 0.36 times.

So total is 70 +3 +0.36 =73.36.

So, m ≈73.36 grams?

Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the highest is 12.48g (option F). So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me double-check the formula again.

Wait, wait a second. Did I forget to account for the 1000 factor in the formula? Because I think the formula is:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F × 1000)

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the formula is m = (I * t * M) / (n * F), but I think I confused the units somewhere.

Wait, Faraday's constant is 96485 C/mol. So when I do I (A) × t (s) gives C. So the formula is correct as m = (I*t*M)/(n*F).

Wait, but when I computed 14,156,028 /192,970, I got around 73.36 grams. But none of the options are that high.

Wait, looking at the options, the highest is F:12.48g. So clearly, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try doing the division again.

Wait, 14,156,028 ÷192,970.

Let me compute 192,970 ×73 = ?

192,970 ×70 =13,507,900

192,970 ×3 =578,910

Total =13,507,900 +578,910 =14,086,810.

Subtract from 14,156,028: 14,156,028 -14,086,810 =69,218.

Now, 192,970 ×0.36 is about 69,470 as before.

So 73.36 grams. But that's not possible because the options don't go that high.

Ah, wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the numerator. Let me recheck 4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69.

Wait, 4.02 ×60,000 =241,200. Correct.

241,200 ×58.69:

Let me compute 241,200 ×58.69 accurately.

Breaking it down:

58.69 × 241,200 = (50 +8 +0.69) ×241,200.

50 ×241,200 =12,060,000

8 ×241,200 =1,929,600

0.69 ×241,200:

Compute 241,200 ×0.6 =144,720

241,200 ×0.09=21,708

So 144,720 +21,708 =166,428.

Adding all together: 12,060,000 +1,929,600 =13,989,600 +166,428 =14,156,028.

That's correct. So numerator is 14,156,028.

Denominator: 2 ×96485 =192,970.

So 14,156,028 ÷192,970 ≈73.36 grams. Hmm.

But looking at the options, the highest is F:12.48g, which is way lower. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a minute, perhaps I forgot to convert the time from minutes to seconds correctly. Let me check that again.

The time given is 1000 minutes. So 1000 ×60 =60,000 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should check the number of electrons again. Ni²+ has a +2 charge, so it gains 2 electrons per ion. So n=2. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me compute the moles of electrons first, then moles of Ni, then grams.

Faraday's law states that 1 mole of electrons is 96485 C.

So, the total charge (Q) is I × t =4.02 A ×60,000 s =241,200 C.

Number of moles of electrons (n_e) = Q / F =241200 /96485 ≈2.5 moles.

Wait, because 96485 ×2 =192,970. 241,200 is about 2.5 ×96,485.

Now, since each Ni²+ ion gains 2 electrons, the moles of Ni deposited would be moles of electrons /2 =2.5 /2=1.25 moles.

Then, grams of Ni = moles × molar mass =1.25 ×58.69 ≈73.36 grams. Again, same result.

But this is not matching any of the options. So there must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another version of Faraday's law is:

grams deposited = (current × time × molar mass) / (1000 × n × F)

Wait, perhaps I should include the 1000 factor here? Let me think.

Wait, because sometimes the formula is written as:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F × 1000)

Wait, because F is in C/mol, and I × t gives C. So perhaps the formula should include the 1000 factor to convert grams properly.

Let me try that.

So,

m = (4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69) / (2 ×96485 ×1000)

Wait, that would be:

Numerator:4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69 =14,156,028

Denominator:2 ×96485 ×1000 = 192,970,000.

So m=14,156,028 /192,970,000 ≈0.07336 grams.

That can't be right because that's 0.07g, which isn't an option either.

Wait, I'm so confused now. Let me think again.

Faraday's first law is m = (I × t × M) / (n × F)

But I think I might have forgotten that the formula is:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F × 1000) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me check the units.

I is in amperes (A = C/s), t in seconds → Q = I*t in coulombs (C).

Molar mass M is in g/mol.

F is in C/mol.

So,

m = (Q × M) / (n × F)

Which is (C × g/mol) / (mol × C) ) → (g).

So the formula is correct as m = (I*t*M)/(n*F).

Thus, in my earlier calculation, I get 73.36 grams, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the charge is per mole of electrons, so maybe I should consider that.

Wait, let me try an alternative approach.

The amount of substance deposited is given by:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F)

So,

m = (4.02 A × 60,000 s × 58.69 g/mol) / (2 × 96485 C/mol)

Calculating numerator:

4.02 ×60,000 =241,200 C.

241,200 ×58.69 =14,156,028.

Denominator: 2 ×96485 =192,970.

So m =14,156,028 /192,970 ≈73.36 grams.

But that's way higher than any option. The options are all around 3-12 grams.

Wait, maybe the time was given as 1000 seconds instead of 1000 minutes? But the question says 1000 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the number of electrons. Let me think again.

Ni²+ → Ni: Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni.

So n=2 electrons. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use grams per coulomb.

Wait, another approach: find how many grams of Ni are deposited per coulomb, then multiply by total coulombs.

The formula for grams per coulomb is (M)/(n×F) → 58.69/(2×96485) →58.69/192970 ≈0.000304 grams per coulomb.

Total coulombs: I × t =4.02 ×60,000 =241,200 C.

So grams =0.000304 ×241,200 ≈73.36 grams. Again, same result.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use a different value for Faraday's constant, like 96500 instead of 96485?

Let me try that.

Using F=96500 C/mol.

Then denominator becomes 2 ×96500 =193,000.

m=14,156,028 /193,000 ≈73.3 grams. Still the same.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of nickel. Maybe it's 58.7 or 58.93?

Wait, nickel's molar mass is approximately 58.69 g/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up grams and kilograms somewhere. But the formula seems correct.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:7.34g, B:11.07g, C:5.2g, D:4.66g, E:8.5g, F:12.48g, G:10.15g, H:6.01g, I:3.98g, J:9.21g.

Wait, my calculation gives around 73 grams, which is way higher than all options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I'm using the wrong number of electrons. Let me think again.

Ni²+ has a charge of +2, so each ion gains 2 electrons. So n=2. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the question is about the anode instead of the cathode? No, the question specifies the cathode, where reduction occurs, so Ni²+ is reduced to Ni. So n=2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used n=1? No, that wouldn't make sense because Ni²+ needs two electrons to become Ni.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used 1000 seconds instead of 60,000 seconds. Let me check.

If t=1000 seconds, then:

Q=4.02 ×1000=4020 C.

m=(4020 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485) = (4020 ×58.69)/(192970)

Compute numerator:4020 ×58.69 =approx 4020 ×58=233, 160, and 4020 ×0.69=2,773.8 → total≈235,933.8.

Denominator:192,970.

So m=235,933.8 /192,970 ≈1.222 grams. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the time is 1000 hours? Let me see. 1000 minutes is about 16.6667 hours. But that's what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial formula.

Wait, I found another version of the formula online: grams deposited = (current × time × molar mass) / (1000 × n × F)

Ah! So perhaps I forgot the 1000 in the denominator. Let me try that.

So,

m = (I × t × M) / (1000 × n × F)

So,

m = (4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69) / (1000 ×2 ×96485)

Compute numerator:4.02 ×60,000 =241,200 → 241,200 ×58.69 =14,156,028.

Denominator:1000 ×2 ×96485 =1,929,700,000.

Wait, wait, wait. 1000 ×2 ×96485 = (1000 ×2) ×96485 =2000 ×96485=192,970,000.

So m=14,156,028 /192,970,000 ≈0.07336 grams. That's about 0.073g, which is way too low. Doesn't match any options.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the formula is m = (I × t × M) / (n × F) without the 1000.

Because when I did it without the 1000, I got 73 grams, which is way too high, and with the 1000, I get 0.07 grams, which is too low.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me look for the correct formula.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the mass deposited is:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F)

Where:
- I is current in amperes,
- t is time in seconds,
- M is molar mass in g/mol,
- n is the number of electrons,
- F is Faraday's constant in C/mol.

So, no 1000 in the denominator. So, my initial approach was correct, giving 73 grams, which is way off the options.

But the options are all much lower. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator.

Wait, let me compute 4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69 again.

4.02 ×60,000 =241,200.

241,200 ×58.69: Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 241,200 ×50 =12,060,000.

241,200 ×8=1,929,600.

241,200 ×0.69=?

241,200 ×0.6=144,720.

241,200 ×0.09=21,708.

Adding:144,720 +21,708=166,428.

Now sum all parts:

12,060,000 +1,929,600=13,989,600.

13,989,600 +166,428=14,156,028.

Yes, correct.

Denominator:2 ×96485=192,970.

So 14,156,028 ÷192,970 ≈73.36 grams.

But the options are all lower, so perhaps the problem is using a different value for Faraday's constant, like 96500 instead of 96485.

Let me try F=96500.

Denominator:2 ×96500=193,000.

14,156,028 ÷193,000 ≈73.3 grams. Still same issue.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use grams per second or another unit? Or maybe the question is about the anode instead of the cathode, but that wouldn't make sense because the cathode is where reduction happens.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the current is 4.02 milliamperes? Because 4.02 mA would make sense with the options given. But the question says 4.02 amperes.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the mass of the anode, but no, the question says the cathode.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of electrons. Let me think: Ni²+ → Ni, so each ion gains 2 electrons. So n=2. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should use n=1, but that would be incorrect.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the grams using the options given and see which one fits.

Looking at option B:11.07g.

So, if m=11.07g, then:

11.07 = (4.02 × t ×58.69) / (2 ×96485)

Wait, but t is given as 1000 minutes, which is 60,000 seconds. So, perhaps the units are correct.

Wait, let me compute what current would give 11.07g.

11.07 = (I ×60,000 ×58.69) / (2 ×96485)

Rearranged:

I = (11.07 × 2 ×96485) / (60,000 ×58.69)

Compute numerator:11.07 ×2 ×96485 =22.14 ×96485 ≈2,140,  let's compute:

96485 ×22 =2,122,670, and 96485 ×0.14=13,507.9 → total≈2,122,670 +13,507.9=2,136,177.9.

Denominator:60,000 ×58.69=3,521,400.

So I ≈2,136,177.9 /3,521,400 ≈0.6065 A.

But the given current is 4.02 A, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps option B is the correct answer, but my calculation is wrong elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute using the formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the time in hours instead of seconds? Let me try.

Wait, no, the formula requires time in seconds.

Wait, let me try to compute the mass again using the formula without the 1000 denominator.

m = (I ×t × M) / (n ×F)

I=4.02 A, t=60,000 s.

So,

m=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485)

Compute numerator:4.02 ×60,000=241,200 →241,200 ×58.69=14,156,028.

Denominator:2×96485=192,970.

So m=14,156,028 /192,970≈73.36 grams.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the current is 4.02 mA instead of amperes. Let me try that.

If I=4.02 mA=0.00402 A.

Then,

Q=0.00402 ×60,000=241.2 C.

m=(241.2 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485)

Compute numerator:241.2 ×58.69 ≈14,156 (same as before but one thousandth).

Denominator:192,970.

So m≈14,156 /192,970≈0.073 grams. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the time is 1000 seconds instead of minutes. Let's try that.

t=1000 s.

Q=4.02 ×1000=4020 C.

m=(4020 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485)= (235,933.8)/(192,970)≈1.222 grams. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution may not be 100% efficient, but the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molar mass I used is incorrect. Let me check the atomic weight of nickel.

Ni has an atomic weight of approximately 58.69 g/mol, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use n=1, but that would be wrong for Ni²+.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m = (I × t × M) / (n × F × 1000). Let me try that.

So,

m=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485 ×1000)

Compute denominator:2 ×96485 ×1000=192,970,000.

Numerator:4.02 ×60,000=241,200 →241,200 ×58.69=14,156,028.

So m=14,156,028 /192,970,000≈0.07336 grams. Still too low.

Wait, perhaps I should use n=1. Let me try that.

m=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(1 ×96485)

= (241,200 ×58.69)/96485.

=14,156,028 /96485 ≈146.7 grams. Even higher, which doesn't match options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute the grams per ampere-hour and then multiply.

1 ampere-hour is 3600 seconds. So,

1 A-hr =1 A ×3600 s =3600 C.

The amount of Ni deposited per ampere-hour can be calculated as:

m = (1 A ×3600 s ×58.69 g/mol)/(2 ×96485 C/mol) = (3600 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485) = (211,284)/(192,970) ≈1.1 grams per ampere-hour.

So, for 4.02 A for 1000 minutes, let's convert 1000 minutes to hours: 1000/60 ≈16.6667 hours.

So total ampere-hours =4.02 A ×16.6667 hr ≈67.0003 A·hr.

Then, grams of Ni =67.0003 ×1.1 ≈73.7 grams. Again, same high value.

But the options don't have that. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula in terms of grams per coulomb.

Grams per coulomb = M/(n×F) =58.69/(2×96485)=58.69/192,970≈0.000304 grams per coulomb.

Total coulombs=4.02 A ×60,000 s=241,200 C.

Total grams=241,200 ×0.000304 ≈73.36 grams. Still same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest option is A:7.34g. Which is exactly 1/10 of 73.4g. So maybe I missed a decimal point.

Wait, perhaps I should have divided by 1000 somewhere. Let me see.

If I made a mistake and forgot to divide by 1000, then 73.36/10=7.34g, which is option A.

But why would I divide by 1000 again? Because the formula is m = (I × t × M)/(n × F), and the units are correct without that.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula is m = (I × t × M)/(n × F × 1000), which would give 73.36/1000=0.073g, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied by 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is m = (I × t × M)/(n × F ×1000). Let me try that.

m=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485 ×1000)=14,156,028/(192,970,000)=0.07336 grams. No, that's too low.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used t in minutes instead of converting to seconds. Let me try that.

Wait, if I don't convert t to seconds, I would have t=1000 minutes.

But then, Q=I × t (in minutes) would be in A·min, which isn't standard. So that approach might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use t in hours.

Wait, 1000 minutes is 16.6667 hours.

So,

Q=4.02 A ×16.6667 hr ×3600 s/hr =4.02 ×16.6667 ×3600 s =4.02 ×60,000 s=241,200 C.

Same as before. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula in terms of grams per ampere-minute.

Grams per ampere-minute = (M)/(n×F) × (1/60) → 58.69/(2×96485) ×1/60 ≈0.000304 ×1/60 ≈0.000005067 grams per A·min.

Total grams=4.02 A ×1000 min ×0.000005067 ≈4.02 ×1000 ×0.000005067 ≈0.02035 grams. Still way too low.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni.

So, for each mole of Ni, 2 moles of electrons are required.

So, the charge needed per mole of Ni is 2 × F =2×96485=192,970 C.

So, grams per coulomb = M/(n×F)=58.69/192,970≈0.000304 grams/C.

Total C=4.02 ×60,000=241,200 C.

Total grams=241,200 ×0.000304≈73.36 grams.

Same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option A:7.34g, which is exactly 73.36/10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is 7.34g, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is in a different concentration, but the problem doesn't mention that.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm making a mistake and the correct answer is option B:11.07g.

Wait, let me compute using option B.

If m=11.07g, then:

11.07 = (4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×F)

So,

F=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×11.07)

Compute numerator:4.02 ×60,000=241,200 →241,200 ×58.69=14,156,028.

Denominator:2 ×11.07=22.14.

So F=14,156,028 /22.14 ≈640,000 C/mol.

But Faraday's constant is about 96,485 C/mol, so that's way off. So option B can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:7.34g, which is 73.36/10. So perhaps I missed a decimal point somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have divided by 1000 in the formula, giving 0.07336g, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should have divided by 10, giving 7.34g, which is option A.

But why would I divide by 10? I'm not sure. Maybe I confused grams with kilograms.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the formula, making sure about the units.

Wait, another approach: find how many moles of electrons are deposited, then find moles of Ni, then grams.

Moles of electrons = I × t / F =4.02 ×60,000 /96485 ≈241,200 /96485≈2.5 mol.

Since each mole of Ni requires 2 moles of electrons, moles of Ni=2.5 /2=1.25 mol.

Grams of Ni=1.25 ×58.69≈73.36 grams.

Again, same result.

I think I must have made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:7.34g, which is exactly 1/10 of 73.36g. So maybe I made a mistake in the number of decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the current was 4.02 mA, but that would give a much lower value.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I've done everything correctly and the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest is option A:7.34g.

But that's not very satisfying. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of electrons. Let me think again.

Wait, Ni²+ → Ni: gains 2 electrons. So n=2. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the mass of the anode, but that's the same as the cathode in a displacement reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the solution is using a different molar mass, like 58.7 instead of 58.69. Let me try that.

58.7 × (4.02 ×60,000) / (2 ×96485) =58.7 ×241,200 /192,970 ≈58.7 ×1.25≈73.375 grams. Still same.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:11.07g. Let me compute using that.

m=11.07g.

So,

11.07 = (4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×F)

So,

F=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×11.07)

Compute numerator:4.02 ×60,000=241,200 →241,200 ×58.69=14,156,028.

Denominator:2 ×11.07=22.14.

So F=14,156,028 /22.14 ≈640,000 C/mol.

But that's way higher than the actual F=96,485 C/mol. So option B can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a calculation error. Let me try recalculating the division.

14,156,028 ÷192,970.

Let me compute 192,970 ×73 =?

192,970 ×70=13,507,900.

192,970 ×3=578,910.

Total=13,507,900 +578,910=14,086,810.

Subtract from 14,156,028:14,156,028−14,086,810=69,218.

Now, 192,970 ×0.36=69,470 approximately.

So total is 73.36.

So, 73.36 grams.

But options are much lower. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option A:7.34g, which is 1/10 of 73.36g.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert grams to kilograms somewhere. But that would make it 0.07336 kg, which is 73.36 grams.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the formula. Maybe the formula is m=(I × t × M)/(n × F ×1000). Let me try that.

So,

m=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485 ×1000)=14,156,028/(192,970,000)=0.07336 grams.

No, that's too low.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m=(I × t × M)/(n × F) × (1/1000), which would give 73.36/1000=0.07336g. Still too low.

I'm stuck. I think I've done everything correctly, but the answer doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:11.07g, but I don't see how. Maybe the number of electrons is different.

Wait, perhaps it's Ni^+ instead of Ni^2+. Let me see.

If n=1, then:

m=(4.02 ×60,000 ×58.69)/(1 ×96485)= (241,200 ×58.69)/96485=14,156,028 /96485≈146.7 grams. Still too high.

Alternatively, perhaps n=3. Then,

m=14,156,028/(3×96485)=14,156,028/289,455≈48.8 grams. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the mass of the anode, which would involve oxidation. But in that case, the formula would be the same, just the metal being oxidized, but the mass calculation remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:11.07g, but I can't see how to get that with the given data. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using 1000 seconds instead of 1000 minutes.

So t=1000s.

Q=4.02 ×1000=4020 C.

m=(4020 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485)= (235,933.8)/(192,970)≈1.222 grams. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using 1000 hours. Let me try.

t=1000 hours=3,600,000 seconds.

Q=4.02 ×3,600,000=14,472,000 C.

m=(14,472,000 ×58.69)/(2 ×96485)= (848,  let me compute:

14,472,000 ×58.69=?

Well, 14,472,000 ×50=723,600,000

14,472,000 ×8=115,776,000

14,472,000 ×0.69=9,989, 880.

So total=723,600,000 +115,776,000=839,376,000 +9,989,880=849,365,880.

Denominator:2×96485=192,970.

m=849,365,880 /192,970≈4,399 grams. Not matching.

Wait, I'm really stuck. I think I've done everything correctly, but I can't get an answer that matches the options. Perhaps the correct answer is option A:7.34g, which is 73.36/10, but I don't know why I would divide by 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:11.07g, but I can't see how to get that number.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me compute the time in hours.

t=1000 minutes=16.6667 hours.

Current=4.02 A.

So, charge Q=4.02 ×16.6667 ×3600=4.02 ×60,000=241,200 C.

Moles of electrons=241,200 /96485≈2.5 mol.

Moles of Ni=2.5/2=1.25 mol.

Mass of Ni=1.25 ×58.69≈73.36g.

Again, same result.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 73.36 grams, but since that's not an option, the closest possible is option A:7.34g, which is exactly 1/10 of my result. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by missing a decimal point somewhere.

To determine the weight of nickel deposited during electroplating, the following steps are applied using Faraday's laws of electrolysis:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Current, \( I = 4.02 \, \text{A} \)
   - Time, \( t = 1000 \, \text{minutes} = 60,000 \, \text{seconds} \)
   - Molar mass of nickel, \( M = 58.69 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Faraday's constant, \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \)
   - Number of electrons, \( n = 2 \) (since \( \text{Ni}^{2+} \) gains 2 electrons to form metallic nickel).

2. **Formula**:
   The mass of metal deposited is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{I \cdot t \cdot M}{n \cdot F}
   \]

3. **Calculation**:
   - Compute the total charge, \( Q = I \cdot t = 4.02 \cdot 60,000 = 241,200 \, \text{C} \).
   - Compute the numerator: \( 241,200 \cdot 58.69 = 14,156,028 \).
   - Compute the denominator: \( 2 \cdot 96485 = 192,970 \).
   - Mass deposited: \( m = \frac{14,156,028}{192,970} \approx 73.36 \, \text{g} \).

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   The calculated mass of \( 73.36 \, \text{g} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \( \text{A: 7.34 g} \) is exactly \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup, such as a missing decimal point or misinterpretation of units. Based on the closest match, the answer is selected as \( \text{A: 7.34 g} \).

**Answer**: A
