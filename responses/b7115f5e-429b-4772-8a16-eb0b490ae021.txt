Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is that a buyer contracted to buy a used car from a seller for $10,000. On the sale date, the buyer gave the seller a $10,000 cashier's check. But the seller rejected it and refused to deliver the car. Now, the buyer is suing for breach of contract. The question is, what remedy is the buyer entitled to?

I remember that when one party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party can usually seek damages. But there are different types of remedies, so I need to think about which applies here.

First, let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Specific performance. That's when the court forces the breaching party to perform as per the contract. But specific performance is usually granted when the item is unique, like real estate. Cars are generally considered standard goods, so specific performance might not be available. I think specific performance is an equitable remedy, and courts often prefer damages over that unless the item is unique.

Option B: Recovery of the cost of the cashier's check. Hmm, the buyer gave a cashier's check, which is like cash. If the seller refused it, does the buyer get their money back? Or is it treated as a deposit? I'm not sure. But in contract law, if the buyer properly tenders payment and the seller breaches by refusing it, the buyer might have to be made whole. But this option seems to be about getting the money back, not necessarily the price difference.

Option C: Recovery of the market price of the car. Wait, the contract was for $10k. If the market price is different, maybe the buyer can get the difference. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The question is about the buyer bringing an action against the seller, so the seller is in breach. The buyer's loss would be the difference if the market price is lower, but the contract was for a fixed price.

Option D: Recovery of the contract price of the car. That sounds like the buyer is trying to recover the $10k they were supposed to pay. But wait, the buyer already gave the seller $10k via the check. So maybe the seller is supposed to deliver the car, but didn't. So the buyer paid the price, but didn't get the car. So the buyer's loss is that they have to pay more elsewhere or lose the use of the car. Or maybe they're out of pocket because they have the check but not the car.

Option E: Reimbursement for transportation costs. That seems a bit specific. Unless the buyer had to pay extra to transport another car, but the question doesn't mention that. So I don't think E is correct.

Option F: Damages measured by the difference between market price and contract price. So if the car's market price went down, the buyer could recover the difference. But if the buyer didn't buy another car, maybe this isn't applicable. Alternatively, if the market price is higher, the buyer could have profited, but since the seller breached, the buyer might be entitled to the difference if they could have sold the car elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Emotional distress. That's usually for personal injury cases, not breach of contract unless it's a special case. Probably not applicable here.

Option H: Punitive damages. Those are for intentional wrongs or fraud, which isn't mentioned here. The seller just breached by refusing the payment, so punitive damages are unlikely.

Option I: Injunction to prevent the seller from selling the car to someone else. That's a form of equitable relief. But if the seller has the right to sell to someone else under the contract, maybe an injunction isn't proper. Also, since the buyer already tendered payment, the seller's refusal would mean the contract is breached, so an injunction might not be the right remedy.

So, thinking through, the buyer paid the full price via a cashier's check, which is as good as cash. The seller refused it and didn't deliver the car. The buyer's loss is that they didn't get the car. So what's the proper remedy?

In contract law, when the seller breaches by refusing to perform, the buyer can typically seek damages. The measure of damages is usually the difference between the contract price and the market price, but if the buyer hasn't resold the item, maybe they can get the contract price back.

Wait, but the buyer already paid the full contract price. So perhaps the seller is unjustly enriched. The buyer can sue for the return of the payment. So would that be option B or D?

Option B says recovery of the cost of the cashier's check, which is the $10k. Option D says recovery of the contract price, which is also $10k. So both seem similar.

Wait, but in this case, the buyer gave the check, which the seller refused. So the seller didn't accept the payment, so the buyer is out the money? Or does the seller have to return it because the contract was breached?

I think when the buyer properly tenders payment, and the seller refuses to perform, the buyer can recover the contract price because the seller didn't deliver the goods. So the buyer is entitled to the $10k because they paid it, and the seller didn't give the car. So the seller is in breach, and the buyer can get their money back.

Wait, but another angle: the buyer gave the check, which is payment, but the seller didn't accept it. So the buyer's obligation was to pay, which they did, and the seller's obligation was to deliver the car, which they didn't. So the buyer can sue for the contract price because they paid it, and the seller didn't deliver. So the remedy would be to recover the $10k, which is the contract price.

So looking at the options, D is recovery of the contract price. Option B is about the cost of the check, which is the same as the contract price. But perhaps D is the correct term because it's the contract price, not just the cost of the check.

Alternatively, maybe the buyer is entitled to specific performance, but as I thought earlier, specific performance is more for unique items. Cars are probably not unique enough, so the court would likely award damages instead.

Wait, but another thought: when the buyer has paid the price, but the seller refuses to deliver, the buyer can sue for the price. That's under UCC ยง 2-709(1), which allows the buyer to recover the price if they tenders payment and the seller doesn't deliver. So the buyer can recover the price they paid, which is $10k.

So that would be option D: Recovery of the contract price of the car.

Alternatively, if the buyer didn't resell the car, they might also be able to recover under the lost volume seller doctrine, but that's more complicated.

So, in this case, the buyer is entitled to recover the contract price because they paid it, and the seller didn't perform. So the correct answer should be D.
</think>

The buyer properly tendered payment via a cashier's check, but the seller breached the contract by refusing delivery. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ยง 2-709(1), when a buyer tenders payment and the seller refuses to deliver, the buyer is entitled to recover the contract price. This remedy ensures the buyer is made whole for the payment made and the failure to receive the goods. Specific performance is unlikely because cars are not unique items, and other remedies like emotional distress or punitive damages do not apply. Therefore, the correct remedy is recovery of the contract price.

Answer: D
