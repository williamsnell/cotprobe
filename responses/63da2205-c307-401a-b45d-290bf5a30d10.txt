<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a parachutist undergoing free fall. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says that the parachutist has a mass of 80 kg, and the drag force is given by F_D = k*v², where k is 0.27 Ns²/m². We need to find the distance traveled, h, until the velocity reaches 0.95 times the terminal velocity, v_t.

First, I remember that terminal velocity is the maximum velocity an object reaches when the force of gravity is balanced by the drag force. So, at terminal velocity, the net force on the parachutist is zero. That means the gravitational force equals the drag force.

The gravitational force (weight) is F_gravity = m * g, where m is mass and g is acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.8 m/s². So F_gravity = 80 kg * 9.8 m/s² = let's calculate that: 80 * 9.8 is 784 N.

At terminal velocity, F_gravity = F_D, so 784 N = k * v_t². Plugging in k=0.27:

784 = 0.27 * v_t² → v_t² = 784 / 0.27. Let me compute that: 784 divided by 0.27. Hmm, 0.27 goes into 784... Well, 0.27 * 2900 is about 783, so v_t² ≈ 2900, so v_t ≈ sqrt(2900). Let me calculate sqrt(2900). Well, 53^2 is 2809, and 54^2 is 2916, so sqrt(2900) is approximately 53.85 m/s. So v_t is roughly 53.85 m/s.

But the problem asks for the velocity when it's 0.95 times v_t. So v = 0.95 * 53.85 ≈ 51.16 m/s.

Now, to find the distance h until this velocity is reached. I think this involves integrating the equations of motion under variable acceleration because the drag force depends on v squared.

The equation of motion for a falling object with drag force proportional to v² is given by:

m * dv/dt = mg - kv²

We can rearrange this to:

dv/dt = g - (k/m) v²

This is a differential equation we can solve. Let me separate variables:

dv / (g - (k/m) v²) = dt

I think the integral of this will give us the time as a function of velocity. Alternatively, we can find the velocity as a function of time and then integrate velocity to find distance. But maybe integrating with respect to velocity is easier.

Let me denote (k/m) as a constant. Let's compute (k/m) = 0.27 / 80 = 0.003375 s²/m.

So the equation becomes:

dv / (g - (0.003375) v²) = dt

Let me set u = v, so the integral becomes:

∫ dv / (g - (k/m) v²) = ∫ dt

The left side integral is a standard form. Let me recall the integral of dx/(a² - x²) is (1/(2a)) ln |(a + x)/(a - x)|) + C, but wait, more accurately, the integral of dx/(a² - x²) is (1/(2a)) ln |(a + x)/(a - x)|) + C. But wait, our denominator is g - (k/m) v², which can be rewritten as (sqrt(g/(k/m)))^2 - v².

Wait, actually, let's factor out the (k/m) term. Let me write the denominator as (k/m)( (g m)/k - v² ). Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to write it as:

∫ dv / (g - (k/m) v²) = ∫ dt

Let me make a substitution: let’s set a² = g / (k/m) → a² = g m / k. So a = sqrt(g m / k).

So, the integral becomes ∫ dv / (a² - v²) = ∫ dt

The integral of 1/(a² - v²) dv is (1/(2a)) ln |(a + v)/(a - v)|) + C.

So, integrating from v=0 to v=0.95v_t, and t=0 to t=T:

(1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ) from 0 to v = t from 0 to T.

But wait, actually, I'm trying to find the time taken to reach v = 0.95v_t, but I think the problem wants the distance traveled, which would require integrating velocity over time. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express time as a function of velocity and then find the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution method for integrating 1/(a² - v²) dv.

Wait, let me proceed. So, a² = (g m)/k → a = sqrt( (9.8 * 80) / 0.27 )

Let me compute that: 9.8 * 80 = 784, 784 / 0.27 ≈ 2903.7037 → a ≈ sqrt(2903.7037) ≈ 53.88 m/s, which makes sense since at v_t, v = a, which aligns with earlier calculation.

So, a ≈ 53.88 m/s.

Now, the integral becomes:

(1/(2a)) [ ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ] from 0 to v = t.

But wait, the integral of dv/(a² - v²) is (1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ), so:

(1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ) = t

At the terminal velocity, when v = a, the expression becomes ln( (a + a)/(a - a) ) which is ln(2a/0) which tends to infinity, but that's expected as it takes infinite time to reach terminal velocity.

But in our case, we're looking for the time to reach v = 0.95a. So plugging v = 0.95a into the equation:

t = (1/(2a)) ln( (a + 0.95a)/(a - 0.95a) ) ) = (1/(2a)) ln( (1.95a)/(0.05a) ) ) = (1/(2a)) ln(1.95 / 0.05 )

Simplify 1.95/0.05 = 39, so:

t = (1/(2a)) ln(39)

Compute ln(39): natural log of 39 is approximately 3.664.

So t ≈ (1/(2*53.88)) * 3.664 ≈ (1/107.76) * 3.664 ≈ 0.034 seconds? Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.95v_t is a high velocity, so it should take some time, but maybe I'm confusing the variables.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again.

Wait, the integral is:

∫ dv/(a² - v²) = (1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ) + C

So, from v=0 to v=0.95a, the integral is:

(1/(2a)) [ ln( (a + 0.95a)/(a - 0.95a) ) - ln( (a + 0)/(a - 0) ) ]

Wait, but when v=0, the denominator becomes a², so ln( (a +0)/(a-0) ) = ln(1) = 0. So the integral from 0 to v is:

(1/(2a)) ln( (1.95a)/(0.05a) ) ) = (1/(2a)) ln(39)

So t = (1/(2a)) * ln(39). As a is about 53.88 m/s, 2a is ~107.76.

So t ≈ (1/107.76) * 3.664 ≈ 0.034 seconds? That seems way too short. Maybe I'm mixing up the variables. Alternatively, perhaps I should be integrating the velocity over time to get the distance.

Wait, but if I have time as a function of velocity, I can express t as a function of v, but to find the distance h, I need to integrate the velocity from 0 to 0.95v_t over time. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the velocity as a function of time and then integrate that to get distance.

Alternatively, perhaps using the equation for velocity as a function of time for a body under constant acceleration with velocity-dependent drag. I think the equation for velocity is:

v(t) = a tanh(t sqrt(k m)/m )

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The differential equation is dv/dt = g - (k/m) v².

This is a separable equation. Rearranging:

dv/(g - (k/m)v²) = dt

Let me make a substitution: let’s set u = v, so the integral becomes:

∫ dv/(g - (k/m) v²) = ∫ dt

As before, let a² = g/(k/m) → a = sqrt( g m / k )

So, the integral becomes ∫ dv/(a² - v²) = ∫ dt

Which integrates to (1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ) = t + C

At t=0, v=0, so:

(1/(2a)) ln( (a + 0)/(a - 0) ) ) = 0 → 0=0, so C=0.

So, (1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ) = t

Solving for t gives t = (1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) )

Now, we can find the time when v = 0.95a:

t = (1/(2a)) ln( (a + 0.95a)/(a - 0.95a) ) ) = (1/(2a)) ln( (1.95a)/(0.05a) ) ) = (1/(2a)) ln(39)

Which is the same as before. Let me compute this time.

a ≈ 53.88 m/s, so 2a ≈ 107.76 s^{-1}

ln(39) ≈ 3.664

So t ≈ (3.664)/(2 * 53.88) → 3.664 / 107.76 ≈ 0.034 seconds. That seems extremely short, which doesn't make sense because reaching 0.95 of terminal velocity should take longer. I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the units are off. Let me check the units in the integral.

The term (k/m) has units (Ns²/m²) / (kg) ) → (kg·m/s² · s²/m²) ) / kg → (kg·m/s² · s²/m²) ) / kg → (kg · m/s² · s² / m² ) / kg → (kg · m/s² · s²) is kg·m²/s² → divided by m² gives kg/s². Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost in units here, but perhaps I should proceed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the velocity as a function of time and then integrate velocity to get distance. Alternatively, maybe I can use the expression for velocity at a certain time and then find the distance by integrating from 0 to t.

But perhaps there's a more straightforward approach using energy conservation. Wait, no, because the force is velocity-dependent, so work done would involve integrating F dx, which would be complicated.

Wait, another approach: the equation of motion is dv/dt = g - (k/m) v². Let me write this as dv/dt = (g m - k v²)/m.

This is a separable equation. Let me separate variables:

dv / (g m - k v²) = dt/m

Integrate both sides:

∫ dv/(g m - k v²) = ∫ dt/m

Left side integral is similar to before. Let me factor out k from denominator:

∫ dv/(k ( (g m)/k - v² )) = ∫ dt/m

Which is ∫ dv/(k (a² - v² )) = ∫ dt/m, where a² = (g m)/k → a = sqrt(g m/k) as before.

So, ∫ dv/(k (a² - v²)) ) = ∫ dt/m → (1/k) ∫ dv/(a² - v²) ) = t/m + C

The integral of dv/(a² - v²) is (1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) )) + C.

So, (1/k) * (1/(2a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) )) ) = t/m + C

At t=0, v=0, so:

(1/(2 a k)) ln(1) = 0 → 0 = 0 + C → C=0.

So, (1/(2 a k)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ) = t/m

Rearranged, t = m/(2 a k) * ln( (a + v)/(a - v) )

Wait, let me compute 2 a k:

a = sqrt( (g m)/k ) → a² = g m /k → k a² = g m.

So 2 a k = 2 a k. Alternatively, perhaps we can express 2 a k in terms of g and m.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for h, the distance, by integrating velocity over time.

We have v(t) as:

v(t) = a tanh( (t sqrt(k/m)) )

Wait, no, because the equation is dv/dt = g - (k/m) v², which is a Riccati equation, and its solution is v(t) = a tanh( (t sqrt(k/m) ) )

Wait, let me check that solution. Let me assume that v(t) = a tanh( (t b) ), where b is some constant.

Then, dv/dt = a b sech²( t b )

But the RHS of the equation is g - (k/m) v² = a² - (a²) (k/m) tanh²( t b )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the expression for velocity as a function of time and then integrate that from 0 to t to get h.

Wait, let's try solving the differential equation again.

dv/dt = g - (k/m) v²

Let me rearrange:

dv / (g - (k/m) v²) = dt

Let me make a substitution: let u = v, so du = dv.

The integral becomes ∫ du/(g - (k/m) u²) = ∫ dt

Let me factor out (k/m) from the denominator:

∫ du/( (k/m) ( (g m)/k - u² ) ) ) = ∫ dt

Which is:

m/k ∫ du/( (g m)/k - u² ) = ∫ dt

Let a² = (g m)/k → a = sqrt( g m /k )

So, the integral becomes:

m/(k) * ∫ du/(a² - u²) ) = ∫ dt

The integral of du/(a² - u²) is (1/(2a)) ln( (a + u)/(a - u) )) )

So,

m/(k) * (1/(2a)) ln( (a + u)/(a - u) )) ) = t + C

At t=0, u=0 → ln(1) = 0 → C=0.

So,

t = (m)/(2 a k) * ln( (a + u)/(a - u) )

Since u = v,

t = (m)/(2 a k) * ln( (a + v)/(a - v) )

Now, to find the time t when v = 0.95 a,

t = (m)/(2 a k) * ln( (a + 0.95a)/(a - 0.95a) ) )

= (m)/(2 a k) * ln( (1.95a)/(0.05a) )

= (m)/(2 a k) * ln(39)

Now, let's compute this:

First, compute a = sqrt( (g m)/k ) = sqrt( (9.8 * 80)/0.27 )

Compute numerator: 9.8 *80 = 784

Denominator: 0.27

So, (g m)/k = 784 / 0.27 ≈ 2903.7037

So a = sqrt(2903.7037) ≈ 53.88 m/s.

Now, compute 2a k:

2a k = 2 * 53.88 * 0.27 ≈ 2 * 53.88 * 0.27 ≈ 2 * 14.5476 ≈ 29.095.

So, (m)/(2 a k) = 80 / 29.095 ≈ 2.751 seconds.

So, t ≈ 2.751 * ln(39) ≈ 2.751 * 3.664 ≈ Let's compute that: 2.751 * 3 = 8.253, 2.751 * 0.664 ≈ approx 1.827, total ≈ 10.08 seconds.

Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, t ≈ 10.08 seconds.

Now, we need to find the distance h traveled during this time. Since velocity is not constant, we need to integrate velocity from t=0 to t=10.08 s.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for h in terms of velocity, using the equation we derived earlier.

We have the equation:

(1/(2 a)) ln( (a + v)/(a - v) ) ) = t

But perhaps it's easier to express h as the integral of v(t) dt from 0 to t.

But I think there's a more straightforward way using the fact that work done against the drag force equals the change in kinetic energy, but I'm not sure because the force is velocity-dependent, making the work integral complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the equation:

h = ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to t.

But to find v(t), I need to solve the differential equation. Let me try that.

The solution to the differential equation dv/dt = g - (k/m) v² is:

v(t) = a tanh( (t sqrt(k/m) ) )

Wait, let me confirm this solution.

Let’s assume v(t) = a tanh(b t), where b is a constant.

Then,

dv/dt = a b sech²(b t)

The right-hand side of the equation is g - (k/m) v² = a² - (a²) (k/m) tanh²(b t)

Wait, but if a² = (g m)/k, then (k/m) a² = (k/m) (g m)/k )= g.

So, g - (k/m) v² = g - (k/m) a² tanh²(b t) = g - g tanh²(b t) = g (1 - tanh²(b t)).

But 1 - tanh²(x) = sech²(x), so this becomes g sech²(b t).

So, our equation becomes:

a b sech²(b t) = g sech²(b t)

Divide both sides by sech²(b t):

a b = g → b = g/a.

So, v(t) = a tanh( (g/a) t )

Wait, that makes sense. So,

v(t) = a tanh( (g/a) t )

So, with a = sqrt(g m/k), and g = 9.8 m/s²,

then,

v(t) = a tanh( (9.8 / a ) t )

Now, we can integrate v(t) from 0 to t to find h.

h = ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to t = ∫ a tanh( (9.8/a ) t ) dt

Let me make a substitution: let u = (9.8/a) t → t = (a/9.8) u → dt = (a/9.8) du

So,

h = ∫ a tanh(u) * (a/9.8) du from u=0 to u= (9.8/a) t

= (a² / 9.8) ∫ tanh(u) du from 0 to (9.8/a) t

The integral of tanh(u) du is ln(cosh(u)) + C.

So,

h = (a² / 9.8) [ ln(cosh(u)) ] from 0 to (9.8/a) t

At u=0, cosh(0)=1, so ln(1)=0. Thus,

h = (a² / 9.8) ln(cosh( (9.8/a) t ) )

But from earlier, we have t when v = 0.95a.

We found that when v=0.95a, t ≈ 10.08 seconds.

So, let's compute (9.8/a) * t = (9.8 / 53.88) * 10.08 ≈ (0.1818) * 10.08 ≈ 1.833.

So,

h = (a² / 9.8) * ln( cosh(1.833) )

Compute cosh(1.833): cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2. Let's compute e^1.833 ≈ 6.23, e^(-1.833) ≈ 0.1599. So,

cosh(1.833) ≈ (6.23 + 0.1599)/2 ≈ 6.39/2 ≈ 3.195.

So ln(3.195) ≈ 1.163.

Now, a² = (g m)/k = (9.8 * 80)/0.27 ≈ 784 / 0.27 ≈ 2903.7037.

So,

h ≈ (2903.7037 / 9.8) * 1.163 ≈ (296.7044) * 1.163 ≈ Let me compute that:

296.7044 * 1 = 296.7044

296.7044 * 0.163 ≈ approx 48.34

So total h ≈ 296.7044 + 48.34 ≈ 345.04 meters.

Looking at the options, D is 345.0, which matches this calculation.

To solve the problem, we first determine the terminal velocity \( v_t \) using the balance of forces: \( F_{\text{gravity}} = F_D \), where \( F_{\text{gravity}} = m g \) and \( F_D = k v_t^2 \). Solving for \( v_t \), we find \( v_t = \sqrt{\frac{m g}{k}} \approx 53.88 \, \text{m/s} \). The velocity we seek is \( v = 0.95 v_t \approx 51.16 \, \text{m/s} \).

Next, we solve the differential equation of motion \( m \frac{dv}{dt} = g - \frac{k}{m} v^2 \) to find the time \( t \) it takes to reach \( v = 0.95 v_t \). Using the substitution \( a = \sqrt{\frac{g m}{k}} \) and integrating, we derive the time \( t \) as:

\[
t = \frac{m}{2 a k} \ln\left(\frac{a + v}{a - v}\right)
\]

Substituting \( a \approx 53.88 \, \text{m/s} \), \( v = 0.95a \), and \( k = 0.27 \), we find \( t \approx 10.08 \, \text{s} \).

To find the distance \( h \), we integrate the velocity function \( v(t) = a \tanh\left(\frac{g}{a} t\right) \) over time from \( 0 \) to \( t \). Using the substitution \( u = \frac{g}{a} t \), the distance becomes:

\[
h = \frac{a^2}{9.8} \ln(\cosh(u))
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{9.8}{a} t \approx 1.833 \), we compute \( \cosh(1.833) \approx 3.195 \) and \( \ln(3.195) \approx 1.163 \). Finally, with \( a^2 \approx 2903.7037 \), we find:

\[
h \approx \frac{2903.7037}{9.8} \times 1.163 \approx 345.04 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the distance traveled until the parachutist reaches \( 0.95 v_t \) is approximately **345.0 meters**.
