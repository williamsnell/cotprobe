Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = sqrt(36x² + 7) divided by (9x + 4). The question is asking for the possible values of g(2023), where g(x) is this horizontal asymptote. The options are labeled from A to J, each providing a range of two numbers. I'm a bit confused about how to approach this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that a horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of a function approaches as x goes to positive or negative infinity. So, to find the horizontal asymptote of f(x), I need to evaluate the limit of f(x) as x approaches both positive and negative infinity. That should give me the values that g(x) can take.

Let me write down the function again: f(x) = sqrt(36x² + 7) / (9x + 4). Hmm, okay. Since both the numerator and the denominator are functions of x, and as x gets very large, the dominant terms will dictate the behavior of the function.

Starting with the numerator, sqrt(36x² + 7). I can factor out 36x² from inside the square root to simplify it. So, sqrt(36x² + 7) becomes x * sqrt(36 + 7/x²). Wait, because sqrt(36x²) is 6x, right? So, sqrt(36x² +7) = sqrt(36x²(1 + 7/(36x²))) = 6x * sqrt(1 + 7/(36x²)).

Similarly, the denominator is 9x + 4. As x becomes very large, the 4 becomes negligible compared to 9x, so the denominator approximately behaves like 9x.

So, putting it together, f(x) ≈ [6x * sqrt(1 + 7/(36x²))] / (9x). The x terms in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, leaving me with [6 * sqrt(1 + 7/(36x²))] / 9.

Simplifying that, 6/9 is 2/3, so f(x) ≈ (2/3) * sqrt(1 + 7/(36x²)). Now, as x approaches infinity, the term 7/(36x²) becomes very small, approaching zero. So, sqrt(1 + 0) is 1. Therefore, the limit as x approaches positive infinity is 2/3.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when x is positive infinity, the square root term approaches 1, so the limit is 2/3. But what about when x approaches negative infinity? Since the square root function always gives a non-negative result, but the denominator could be negative if x is negative. Let me check that.

If x approaches negative infinity, then 9x + 4 is approximately 9x, which is negative. The numerator sqrt(36x² +7) is always positive because it's a square root. So, when x is negative, the denominator is negative, and the numerator is positive, so the overall function becomes negative.

Wait, but I thought the horizontal asymptote is a value that the function approaches, regardless of the sign. So, maybe I need to consider the sign when taking the limit.

Let me re-examine the function as x approaches negative infinity. Let's write x as -|x|, so when x is negative, |x| is positive. Then, sqrt(36x² +7) becomes sqrt(36|x|² +7) which is 6|x|, but since x is negative, |x| is -x. Wait, no, |x| is always positive, so sqrt(36x² +7) is 6|x|, which is 6*(-x) when x is negative, but wait no, because x is negative, |x| is -x, so sqrt(36x² +7) = 6|x| = 6*(-x) if x is negative. Wait, that doesn't make sense because sqrt(36x²) is 6|x|, which is 6*(-x) when x is negative, but that would make it negative. But the square root is always positive, so I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The square root function sqrt(x²) is equal to |x|, which is x if x is positive and -x if x is negative. So, sqrt(36x² +7) is 6|x|, which is 6x when x is positive, and 6*(-x) when x is negative, because |x| is -x when x is negative.

So, when x approaches positive infinity, sqrt(36x² +7) ≈ 6x. The denominator 9x +4 ≈9x, so f(x) ≈6x/(9x)= 2/3.

When x approaches negative infinity, sqrt(36x² +7) ≈6|x|=6*(-x) because x is negative. The denominator 9x +4 ≈9x, which is negative. So, f(x) ≈ [6*(-x)] / (9x) = (-6x)/(9x) = -6/9 = -2/3.

Wait, but wait a second, x is negative, so let's substitute x as -|x|. So, x = -|x|, so sqrt(36x² +7) = sqrt(36|x|² +7) = 6|x|. The denominator is 9*(-|x|) +4 ≈-9|x|.

So, f(x) ≈6|x| / (-9|x|) = -6/9 = -2/3.

Hmm, so the horizontal asymptote is y = 2/3 as x approaches positive infinity, and y = -2/3 as x approaches negative infinity.

Wait, but the question is about g(x) being the horizontal asymptote. So, if the function approaches 2/3 on the right and -2/3 on the left, then the horizontal asymptote would have two values: 2/3 and -2/3. But the options are given as ranges, so I'm looking for an option that includes both 2/3 and -2/3.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option F is [0.6667, -0.6667], which is approximately 2/3 and -2/3. Because 2/3 is approximately 0.6667.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, as x approaches positive infinity:

f(x) = sqrt(36x² +7)/(9x +4) ≈ (6x)/(9x) = 2/3.

As x approaches negative infinity:

f(x) ≈ (6|x|)/(9x). But since x is negative, |x| = -x. So,

(6*(-x))/(9x) = (-6x)/(9x) = (-6)/(9) = -2/3.

So, yes, the horizontal asymptote is y = 2/3 as x approaches positive infinity and y = -2/3 as x approaches negative infinity. Therefore, the possible values of g(x) are 2/3 and -2/3.

Looking at the options:

A: [0.9999, -0.9999] → 1 and -1, which is too high.

B: [1.4142, -1.4142] → sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), way too high.

C: [4.0000, -4.0000] → 4 and -4, way too high.

D: [1.2345, -1.2345] → around 1.2345, which is higher than 2/3.

E: [3.1415, -3.1415] → pi and -pi, way too high.

F: [0.6667, -0.6667] → approximately 2/3 and -2/3. This matches.

G: [2.5678, -2.5678] → higher than 2/3.

H: [0.1234, -0.1234] → too low.

I: [0.3333, -0.3333] → 1/3 and -1/3, too low.

J: [2.7183, -2.7183] → e and -e, way too high.

So, the correct option is F, which includes 0.6667 and -0.6667, which correspond to 2/3 and -2/3.
