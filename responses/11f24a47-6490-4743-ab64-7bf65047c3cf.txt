Question:

Wilshire Street is a public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Wilshire and Figueroa Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car. The businessman suffered damages in the amount of $5,000. The woman, on the other hand, suffered damages in the amount of $1,000. The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. " Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?

Options:

A: The businessman recovers $1,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $900 from the businessman.
B: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
C: The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.
D: The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
E: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
F: The businessman recovers nothing from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
G: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.
H: The businessman recovers $2,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $500 from the businessman.
I: The businessman recovers $3,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $600 from the businessman.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: Wilshire Street is a one-way street for northbound traffic, and it intersects with Figueroa Street at right angles. There are traffic lights controlling the intersection. 

A businessman is driving east on Figueroa and doesn't see the traffic light. He enters the intersection when the light is red for eastbound traffic but green for northbound. So, he's going through a red light, which is definitely against the law. But wait, the woman was also negligent. She was driving south on Wilshire, which is a one-way northbound street, so she shouldn't have been going south. She entered without looking and hit the businessman's car. 

The damages are $5,000 for the businessman and $1,000 for the woman. Both are suing each other. The question is about who is liable and how much they should recover based on the negligence percentages.

The key here is the statute provided. It says that a failure to exercise ordinary care, contributing to injury or property damage, doesn't bar recovery, but damages are diminished in proportion to the injured party's negligence. Also, there's no set-off of damages between the parties.

So, the statute seems to outline a comparative negligence approach. In comparative negligence jurisdictions, each party's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault. But this statute adds that there's no set-off, which I think means that each party's recovery isn't offset by the other's recovery. So, each party's recovery is calculated independently based on their own negligence.

The problem states that both were negligent: 30% to the woman and 70% to the businessman. So, the woman is 30% at fault, and the businessman is 70% at fault.

Now, looking at the claims:

1. The businessman sues the woman for his $5,000 damages. Since he's 70% negligent, his recovery from her would be reduced by 70%. So, 30% of $5,000 is $1,500. So he can recover $1,500 from her.

2. The woman sues the businessman for her $1,000 damages. She's 30% at fault, so her recovery is reduced by 30%. That means she can recover 70% of $1,000, which is $700.

Wait, but I need to check if there's any set-off. The statute says no set-off, so the amounts are calculated separately.

Looking at the options, option G says the businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman. That matches my calculations.

Let me make sure I didn't mix up the percentages. The businessman's damages are $5k, but he's 70% at fault. So his recovery is 30% of 5k, which is $1,500. The woman's damages are $1k, she's 30% at fault, so her recovery is 70% of 1k, which is $700.

So option G is the correct answer.

The statute applies comparative negligence, reducing each party's recovery by their percentage of fault. The businessman recovers 30% of his $5,000 damages ($1,500), and the woman recovers 70% of her $1,000 damages ($700). No set-off occurs.

Answer: G
