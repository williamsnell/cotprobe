Okay, so I need to figure out the consequence of permanent inflation on interest rates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that inflation affects how interest rates are set. When inflation is high, it usually makes the central banks adjust interest rates. But wait, what's the difference between nominal and real interest rates? Oh right, the nominal rate is the stated rate, and the real rate is what's left after subtracting inflation. So if inflation is high, the real interest rate could be lower.

But the question is about permanent inflation. Permanent means it's not temporary; it's ongoing. So how does that affect things? I think when inflation is expected to be high and permanent, people and businesses adjust their expectations. They might demand higher nominal interest rates because they anticipate that the money they lend will lose purchasing power over time due to inflation.

Wait, but how does the central bank respond? Central banks usually try to control inflation by adjusting the nominal interest rates. If inflation is permanent, maybe their usual tools are less effective. So the central bank's control over interest rates might be weakened. That makes me think of option E: Central banks have less control over interest rates.

Alternatively, option B says interest rates become discounted by the anticipated rate of inflation. That sounds like the nominal rates are adjusted to reflect the expected inflation, so the real rate is what's more important. But how does that relate to permanent inflation?

If inflation is permanent, the expected rate is built into the nominal rates. So the real rate is nominal minus expected inflation. But does that mean the central bank can't influence it as much because inflation is already factored in? Or does it mean that the discounting makes the real rates lower, so the central bank can't lower real rates anymore without causing other issues.

Wait, another angle: If inflation is high and permanent, the central bank might raise nominal rates to control it. But if inflation is expected to stay high, people might not change their behavior much because they already expect higher inflation. So the effectiveness of the central bank's rate changes diminishes, meaning they have less control. That points to option E again.

Option H says the gap between nominal and real rates narrows. That would happen if the nominal rate is just keeping up with inflation, making real rate low or zero. But I'm not sure if that's the consequence of permanent inflation. It might be a result, but how does that tie to the central bank's control?

So putting it together, if inflation is permanent, people and markets adjust by expecting higher inflation, so the central bank can't influence the real interest rates as effectively. Therefore, the central banks have less control over interest rates. So the answer should be E.

The consequence of permanent inflation is that central banks have less control over interest rates because the expected inflation is built into nominal rates, reducing the effectiveness of their tools to influence real interest rates.

Answer: E
