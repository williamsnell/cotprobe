Okay, so I need to find the Fourier cosine series of the function f(x) = x over the interval 0 < x < c. Hmm, Fourier series can be a bit tricky, but I remember that for a function defined on an interval, the Fourier cosine series is used when the function is even, and the sine series when it's odd. Since the interval is from 0 to c, and the function is just f(x) = x, I think we're extending it as an even function beyond 0 and c. 

Wait, no, actually, the Fourier cosine series is typically used for functions defined on an interval symmetric about zero, but here the interval is from 0 to c. So maybe we're considering the function as even, so f(x) = x for 0 < x < c, and then extended as f(x) = x for -c < x < 0 as well. That way, it's an even function, so the Fourier series will only have cosine terms.

The general formula for the Fourier cosine series is:

f(x) ~ a0/2 + sum_{n=1 to ∞} a_n cos(nπx / c)

Where a0 is (2/c) ∫ from 0 to c of f(x) dx, and a_n is (2/c) ∫ from 0 to c of f(x) cos(nπx / c) dx.

So, let me compute a0 first. 

a0 = (2/c) ∫₀^c x dx = (2/c) [x²/2 from 0 to c] = (2/c)(c²/2) = (2/c)(c²/2) = c.

Therefore, a0/2 is c/2.

Now, for a_n:

a_n = (2/c) ∫₀^c x cos(nπx/c) dx.

I can integrate this by parts. Let me set u = x, dv = cos(nπx/c) dx.

Then du = dx, and v = (c/(nπ)) sin(nπx/c).

So, integration by parts gives:

uv - ∫ v du = x*(c/(nπ)) sin(nπx/c) | from 0 to c - ∫ (c/(nπ)) sin(nπx/c) dx.

Evaluating the first term at c: c*(c/(nπ)) sin(nπ) = c^2/(nπ) * 0 = 0.

At 0: 0*(...) = 0.

So the first term is zero. Now the integral becomes:

- (c/(nπ)) ∫ sin(nπx/c) dx from 0 to c.

The integral of sin is -cos, so:

- (c/(nπ)) [ -c/(nπ) cos(nπx/c) ] from 0 to c.

Simplify:

= (c^2)/(n²π²) [ cos(nπx/c) ] from 0 to c.

At x = c: cos(nπ) = (-1)^n.

At x = 0: cos(0) = 1.

So the expression becomes:

(c²)/(n²π²) [ (-1)^n - 1 ].

Putting it all together, a_n is (2/c) times this:

a_n = (2/c) * (c²)/(n²π²) [ (-1)^n - 1 ] = (2c)/(n²π²) [ (-1)^n - 1 ].

Wait, that's [ (-1)^n -1 ] — let's think about that. When n is even, (-1)^n is 1, so [1-1]=0. So a_n is zero for even n. When n is odd, (-1)^n is -1, so [ -1 - 1 ] = -2. So:

a_n = (2c)/(n²π²) * (-2) when n is odd. So for n odd, a_n = -4c/(n²π²). For n even, a_n = 0.

But wait, let me check that again. When n is even, [ (-1)^n -1 ] is 1-1=0. When n is odd, (-1)^n is -1, so [ -1 -1 ]= -2. So yes, a_n = (2c)/(n²π²) * (-2) when n is odd. That simplifies to a_n = -4c/(n²π²) for odd n.

But wait, let's make sure I didn't mess up the signs. Let me re-express:

a_n = (2/c) * [ (c²)/(n²π²) ( (-1)^n -1 ) ] = (2c)/(n²π²) ( (-1)^n -1 )

Which can be rewritten as (2c)/(n²π²) [ - (1 - (-1)^n) ) ] because (-1)^n -1 = - (1 - (-1)^n).

So that's (2c)/(n²π²) * (-1) (1 - (-1)^n) ) = - (2c)/(n²π²) (1 - (-1)^n).

But since 1 - (-1)^n is zero when n is even (because (-1)^n=1) and 2 when n is odd (because (-1)^n=-1). So for n even, a_n=0, and for n odd, a_n= - (2c)/(n²π²) * 2 = -4c/(n²π²).

So the Fourier cosine series is:

f(x) ~ (1/2)c + sum_{n=1 to ∞} a_n cos(nπx/c)

But since a_n is zero for even n, we can write the sum only over odd n. Let me let k = (n-1)/2 for n odd, but maybe it's easier to write it as sum over k from 0 to ∞, where n=2k+1.

Alternatively, we can factor out the terms for odd n.

So, a_n can be represented as a sum over k where n=2k+1, so:

sum_{n odd} a_n cos(nπx/c) = sum_{k=0}^∞ a_{2k+1} cos( (2k+1)πx/c )

Since a_{2k+1} = -4c/( (2k+1)^2 π² )

So the series becomes:

f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1)πx/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Wait, checking the options, let me see:

Looking at the options, option D is:

f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1)πx/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Option C is:

f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{n=1}^∞ [ cos(nπx/c) / n² ]

But wait, in option C, it's sum over n=1, which would include both even and odd terms. But our a_n is zero for even n, so only the odd terms contribute. So if we write n as 2k+1, it's the same as option D. Alternatively, option C would include even terms which are zero, so effectively, it's the same as D but written over n. But let's check the coefficients.

Wait, in our calculation, a_n = 0 for even n, and for n odd, a_n = -4c/(n² π²). So the series becomes:

(1/2)c + sum_{n=1}^∞ [ -4c/(n² π²) cos(nπx/c) ] * (1 when n is odd, else 0 )

Which can be written as:

(1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Which matches option D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1)πx/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Yes, that's correct. So option D is the Fourier cosine series of f(x) = x over 0 < x < c.

Wait, but let me check other options to make sure. Option C is similar but sums over all n, which would include even terms that are zero. So it would effectively be the same as D, but written differently. But wait, no, because in option C the denominator is n², but our a_n is -4c/(n² π²) only for odd n. So when written as sum over n, it's equivalent to summing only over odd n, which would be same as D. But perhaps the way they write it is different.

Wait, no, because in option C, the sum is from n=1, and the coefficient is -4c/π² times 1/n² cos(...). But in reality, for even n, a_n is zero, so those terms don't contribute. So the sum in C is effectively the same as the sum in D but written in terms of n instead of k. So both C and D would represent the same series, but written differently.

Wait, but no, because in option C, the argument of cosine is nπx/c, which for even n would be even multiples, but since a_n is zero for even n, those terms would be zero. So the series in option C would indeed be the same as the series in D, but written over n. But let me think: in option C, the sum is from n=1, and the term is cos(n π x/c) / n². So for even n, cos(n π x/c) is cos(2k π x/c), but since a_n is zero for even n, the coefficient for even n is zero. So the series in C is the same as the series in D, because when you write it as sum over n, the even terms are zero. So why is there a difference between C and D?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute a_n again to confirm.

Wait, when I computed a_n, I found that a_n = (2/c) * [ (c²)/(n² π²) ( (-1)^n -1 ) ] = (2c)/(n² π²) ( (-1)^n -1 )

Which simplifies to (2c)/(n² π²) * (-1)^n - (2c)/(n² π²)

So a_n = [ -2c/(n² π²) ] (-1)^n - 2c/(n² π² )

Wait, no, let me compute it again:

a_n = (2c)/(n² π²) [ (-1)^n - 1 ]

= (2c)/(n² π²) [ (-1)^n - 1 ]

So when n is even, (-1)^n = 1, so [1-1]=0 → a_n=0.

When n is odd, (-1)^n = -1 → [-1 -1] = -2 → a_n = (2c)/(n² π²) * (-2) = -4c/(n² π²).

So a_n is zero for even n, and -4c/(n² π²) for odd n.

So the Fourier series is:

f(x) ~ (1/2)c + sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n cos(n π x/c )

But since a_n is zero for even n, we can write it as sum over odd n, which can be expressed as n=2k+1, with k starting from 0.

So the sum becomes sum_{k=0}^∞ a_{2k+1} cos( (2k+1) π x/c )

And a_{2k+1} = -4c/( (2k+1)^2 π² )

So the series is:

(1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Which is exactly option D.

Looking at option C, it's written as sum_{n=1}^∞ [ cos(n π x/c ) / n² ] multiplied by -4c/π². But since a_n is zero for even n, the sum in C would effectively only include the odd terms. So both C and D are correct? Wait, no, because in C it's summing over all n, but in D it's summing only over the odd terms. However, in reality, the coefficients for even n are zero, so both options are equivalent.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C: f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{n=1}^∞ [ cos(n π x/c ) / n² ]

Option D: f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

So both are correct, but the way they express the sum is different. But in the context of multiple-choice questions, only one option is correct. Let me check if I made any miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the a0 term. Let me recompute a0.

a0 = (2/c) ∫₀^c x dx = (2/c)(c²/2) = c. So a0/2 is c/2. That's correct.

For a_n, I did integration by parts correctly, and ended up with a_n = (2c)/(n² π²) [ (-1)^n -1 ]

Which is zero for even n and -4c/(n² π²) for odd n.

So the Fourier series is:

(1/2)c + sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n cos(n π x/c )

But since even terms are zero, it's equivalent to summing over odd n. So option D is the correct expression.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is:

f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{n=1}^∞ [ cos(n π x/c ) / n² ]

Which would include both even and odd terms, but since for even n, a_n is zero, the sum in C would correctly represent the series as well. But wait, in our calculation, the coefficient is -4c/(n² π²) only for odd n. So when summing over all n, even terms contribute zero, so the sum is the same as option D. So why are options C and D both present? Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficient's sign. Let me check the a_n calculation again.

We have a_n = (2/c) * [ (c²)/(n² π²) ( (-1)^n -1 ) ]

Which is (2c)/(n² π²) [ (-1)^n -1 ]

So for n even: [1 -1] = 0 → a_n=0.

For n odd: [ (-1) -1 ] = -2 → a_n= (2c)/(n² π²) * (-2) = -4c/(n² π²).

So the coefficient is negative, so the series is:

(1/2)c + sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n cos(n π x/c )

Which is (1/2)c - sum_{n odd} [4c/(n² π²)] cos(n π x/c )

Which can be written as (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Which is option D.

Alternatively, if we express it as sum over all n, including even terms which are zero, the expression would be the same as option C, but since even terms are zero, it's the same as D. But looking at the options, C and D have different summations. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interval 0 < x < c, so the function is defined on 0 to c, and when extended as even, the Fourier cosine series is written with n going to infinity, but only including the odd terms.

But looking back, the correct expression is option D, because it correctly sums only the odd terms, whereas option C sums all n, but the even terms contribute zero. However, the coefficient in option C is -4c/π², which for n even would be zero, so the sum is effectively the same as option D. But perhaps the way it's written in the options is different. Let me check.

Option C: f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{n=1}^∞ [ cos(n π x/c ) / n² ]

Option D: f(x) ~ (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

So both are correct, but in terms of the standard Fourier cosine series, the sum is over all n, but the even terms are zero. So perhaps option C is also correct. Wait, but in our calculation, the coefficient is -4c/(n² π²) only for odd n, so the sum in C would not just be over n, but each term is multiplied by whether n is odd or even. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as sum over odd n, which is what option D does.

Wait, but the options are given with specific forms. Let me check the coefficient again.

In the Fourier series, the a_n is -4c/(n² π²) for odd n, zero otherwise. So the series is:

(1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{n odd} [ cos(n π x/c ) / n² ]

Which can be rewritten as sum_{k=0}^∞ [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

So option D is correct.

Yes, so the correct answer is option D.

To find the Fourier cosine series for \( f(x) = x \) over the interval \( 0 < x < c \), we use the formula for the Fourier cosine series:

\[
f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{c}\right),
\]

where \( a_0 = \frac{2}{c} \int_0^c x \, dx \) and \( a_n = \frac{2}{c} \int_0^c x \cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{c}\right) dx \).

1. **Compute \( a_0 \):**

\[
a_0 = \frac{2}{c} \int_0^c x \, dx = \frac{2}{c} \left[\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^c = \frac{2}{c} \cdot \frac{c^2}{2} = c.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{a_0}{2} = \frac{c}{2} \).

2. **Compute \( a_n \):**

Using integration by parts with \( u = x \), \( dv = \cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{c}\right) dx \), we find:

\[
a_n = \frac{2}{c} \left[ \frac{c^2}{n^2\pi^2} \left((-1)^n - 1\right) \right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a_n = \frac{2c}{n^2\pi^2} \left((-1)^n - 1\right).
\]

For even \( n \), \( (-1)^n = 1 \), so \( a_n = 0 \). For odd \( n \), \( (-1)^n = -1 \), so:

\[
a_n = -\frac{4c}{n^2\pi^2}.
\]

3. **Construct the Fourier cosine series:**

Since \( a_n = 0 \) for even \( n \), the series includes only odd terms. Let \( n = 2k + 1 \), where \( k \) starts from 0. The series becomes:

\[
f(x) \sim \frac{c}{2} - \frac{4c}{\pi^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi x}{c}\right)}{(2k+1)^2}.
\]

4. **Match with the options:**

This matches **Option D**:

\[
f(x) \sim \frac{1}{2}c - \frac{4c}{\pi^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi x}{c}\right)}{(2k+1)^2}.
\]

**Answer: D**
