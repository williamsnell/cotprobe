<think>
Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. It's about vaporizing benzene, and I need to calculate a few different things: W_rev, q, ΔH, and ΔE. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

First, the problem says that 100 grains of benzene is vaporized at its boiling point of 80.2°C under 760 torr pressure. The heat of vaporization is given as 94.4 cal/g. Hmm, I think the heat of vaporization is the amount of energy needed to turn a liquid into gas at a constant temperature, which is the boiling point here.

Wait, but wait, grains? Oh right, I think 1 grain is approximately 0.06479891 grams. So 100 grains would be 100 times that. Let me calculate that first. 100 grains * 0.06479891 g/grain equals about 6.479891 grams. So that's the mass of benzene.

The heat of vaporization (ΔH_vap) is 94.4 cal/g. So the total heat required to vaporize 6.479891 grams would be mass times ΔH_vap. Let me compute that: 6.479891 g * 94.4 cal/g. Let's see, 6 * 94 is 564, 0.479891 *94.4 is approximately 45.36. So total q is around 564 +45.36 = 609.36 cal. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options have much larger numbers. Oh wait, 100 grains is about 6.48 grams, but I think I made a mistake. Wait, 1 grain is 0.06479891 grams, so 100 grains is 6.479891 grams. So 6.479891 *94.4 = let's compute that correctly.

6 * 94.4 = 566.4. 0.479891 *94.4: let's calculate 0.4 *94.4=37.76, 0.079891*94.4≈7.54. So total is 566.4 +37.76=604.16 +7.54=611.7 cal. So q should be approximately 611.7 calories. But looking at the options, the q values are like 9400, 9440, etc. Wait, that's way bigger. Did I mess up the units?

Wait, wait a second. Oh no! I think I messed up the grains. Wait, 1 grain is about 64.79891 milligrams, right? So 100 grains would be 6.479891 grams. But wait, maybe the problem says 100 grains, but actually, in some contexts, a "grain" is a unit of mass used in the US. Let me double-check the conversion. Oh, wait, 1 grain = 0.06479891 grams. So 100 grains = 6.479891 grams. So 6.479891 grams * 94.4 cal/g = 6.479891 *94.4 ≈ 611.7 cal. But the options show q as 9400, 9440, etc., which are way larger. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe the problem says 100 grains, but perhaps it's 100 grams? Or perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The problem says 100 grains of benzene. Oh, maybe the user made a typo, but I have to work with what's given. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the units. Alternatively, maybe the heat of vaporization is in kJ or something else. Wait no, the problem says 94.4 cal/g.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, maybe the heat of vaporization is per mole, but no, the problem says per gram. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the given data.

So, assuming q is positive because heat is absorbed by the system when vaporizing. So q = 6.479891 g *94.4 cal/g = let's compute that precisely. 6 *94.4 is 566.4, 0.479891 *94.4: 0.4*94.4=37.76, 0.079891*94.4≈7.54. So total q≈566.4 +37.76=604.16 +7.54≈611.7 cal. So q≈612 cal.

But the options have q around 9400. So perhaps the mass is 100 grams? Because 100 grams would give 100 *94.4 =9440 cal. Oh! That makes sense. So maybe the problem says 100 grains, but perhaps it's a typo, and it's 100 grams. Because 100 grams would give q=9440 cal, which matches option A and D.

Wait, but the problem says 100 grains. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. 1 grain is about 0.06479891 grams, so 100 grains is 6.479891 grams. So 6.479891 *94.4 is about 611.7 cal. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem intended 100 grams, which would be 94.4 *100=9440 cal. So that's option A for q=9440.

Wait, but the problem explicitly says 100 grains. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the heat of vaporization is per mole, but the problem says per gram. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding something else.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is 760 torr, which is 1 atm, so it's at standard pressure. So vaporization at boiling point is a phase change at constant temperature and pressure, so q would equal ΔH (since ΔH = q at constant pressure). So q would be the enthalpy change, which is the heat of vaporization times mass.

So if the mass is 6.479891 grams, then q=6.479891 *94.4≈611.7 cal. But none of the options match that. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended 100 grams, leading to q=9440 cal, which is option A's q.

But the options have q as 9440 in option A, which would mean the mass is 100 grams. So perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I need to proceed with the given data as 100 grains, but the options don't match. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the given data, but perhaps the answer is not among the options. But I have to choose from A to J.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the other parts: W_rev and ΔE.

At constant pressure, the work done (W_rev) for expansion is PΔV. But since it's vaporization, the volume change is significant. Benzene's molar volume as a liquid is much less than as a gas. So, the work done by the system is PΔV. But to calculate that, I need the volume change.

Alternatively, since it's at 1 atm (760 torr), the work done is PΔV. The volume of the gas is nRT. Let's compute the moles first. If the mass is 100 grains, which is 6.479891 grams, then moles = mass / molar mass. Benzene's molar mass is about 78.11 g/mol. So 6.479891 g /78.11 g/mol ≈0.0829 mol.

As a liquid, the volume is negligible, so ΔV ≈ V_gas. V = nRT/P. R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. Temperature is 80.2°C, which is 353.35 K.

So V = 0.0829 mol *0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *353.35 K /1 atm. Let's compute that: 0.0829 *0.0821≈0.0068, 0.0068 *353.35≈2.40 L.

So the volume change is approximately 2.40 L. Since 1 L·atm = 101.325 J, but since we're working in calories, perhaps I should convert L·atm to calories. 1 L·atm ≈24.71 cal. So work done W = -PΔV = -nRT = -2.40 L·atm *24.71 cal/(L·atm) ≈-59.3 cal.

Wait, but that's not matching the options. The options have W_rev around -800 to -900 cal. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the work done using the formula W = -P_ext ΔV. Since the process is at constant pressure, W = -P_ext (V_final - V_initial). V_initial is negligible, so W ≈-P_ext V_gas.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done in calories. Let me try again.

n = 6.479891 g /78.11 g/mol ≈0.083 mol.

V_gas = nRT/P = (0.083 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(353.35 K) /1 atm ≈0.083 *0.0821 *353.35 ≈0.083 *29.0 ≈2.41 L.

So PΔV = 1 atm * 2.41 L = 2.41 L·atm. Convert to calories: 2.41 L·atm *24.71 cal/(L·atm) ≈59.4 cal. So W_rev = -59.4 cal.

But in the options, W_rev is much larger, like -898, -850, etc. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the heat of vaporization is given as 94.4 cal/g, but that's the enthalpy change at constant pressure. So q = ΔH = mass * ΔH_vap. So if mass is 100 grams, q=9440 cal, which matches option A's q and ΔH.

But wait, the problem says 100 grains. So if I proceed with that, q≈611.7 cal. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem intended 100 grams. Let me proceed under that assumption, as it makes the numbers match the options.

So, if mass is 100 grams, then:

q = 100 g *94.4 cal/g =9440 cal.

ΔH = q =9440 cal (since it's at constant pressure).

Now, W_rev is the work done. Using the ideal gas law, V = nRT/P. n =100 g /78.11 g/mol ≈1.28 mol.

V = (1.28 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(353.35 K)/1 atm ≈1.28 *0.0821 *353.35 ≈1.28 *29.0 ≈37.1 L.

So PΔV =1 atm *37.1 L =37.1 L·atm. Convert to calories: 37.1 *24.71 ≈916 cal. So W_rev = -916 cal.

But looking at the options, option A has W_rev=-898 cal, which is close but not exact. Maybe I made a rounding error. Let me recalculate more precisely.

n=100/78.11=1.28 mol.

V=nRT/P =1.28 *0.0821 *353.35.

0.0821 *353.35 =29.0 (approx).

1.28 *29 =37.12 L.

So PΔV=37.12 L·atm.

37.12 *24.71 ≈37 *24.71 =914.27 cal.

So W_rev≈-914 cal.

Looking at the options, option A has W_rev=-898 cal, which is close but not exact. Perhaps there's a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is 760 torr, which is 760/760=1 atm, so same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses ΔE = q + W. So ΔE = q + W_rev. Since W_rev is negative (work done by the system), ΔE = q + W_rev.

So ΔE =9440 + (-914) =9440 -914=8526 cal.

Looking at the options, option A has ΔE=8542 cal, which is close. Let me see the options:

Option A: W_rev=-898, q=9440, ΔH=9440, ΔE=8542.

So W_rev is -898, which is close to my calculation of -914. The slight difference might be due to rounding or more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is given in torr, but I used atm. Wait, 760 torr is exactly 1 atm, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.

So, putting it all together:

a) W_rev≈-914 cal (but option A has -898, which is close)

b) q=9440 cal (option A)

c) ΔH=9440 cal (option A)

d) ΔE= q + W_rev =9440 -914=8526 cal. Option A has 8542, which is close.

So option A seems to be the best fit, considering possible rounding differences.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the heat absorbed (q), the change in enthalpy (ΔH), the reversible work (W_rev), and the change in internal energy (ΔE) for the vaporization of benzene.

### Given Data:
- **Mass of benzene**: 100 grains = \( 6.479891 \, \text{g} \) (1 grain = \( 0.06479891 \, \text{g} \)).
- **Heat of vaporization (\( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} \))**: \( 94.4 \, \text{cal/g} \).
- **Temperature**: \( 80.2^\circ \text{C} = 353.35 \, \text{K} \).
- **Pressure**: \( 760 \, \text{torr} = 1 \, \text{atm} \).
- **Gas constant (\( R \))**: \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \).
- **Molar mass of benzene (\( M \))**: \( 78.11 \, \text{g/mol} \).

---

### Calculations:

#### 1. **Heat Absorbed (\( q \))**:
   \[
   q = \text{mass} \times \Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 6.479891 \, \text{g} \times 94.4 \, \text{cal/g} \approx 611.7 \, \text{cal}.
   \]
   However, the options suggest a much larger value, implying the mass might be \( 100 \, \text{g} \) instead of \( 100 \, \text{grains} \). Recalculating for \( 100 \, \text{g} \):
   \[
   q = 100 \, \text{g} \times 94.4 \, \text{cal/g} = 9440 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

#### 2. **Change in Enthalpy (\( \Delta H \))**:
   Since the process occurs at constant pressure, \( \Delta H = q \):
   \[
   \Delta H = 9440 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

#### 3. **Reversible Work (\( W_{\text{rev}} \))**:
   Using the ideal gas law, the volume of the vaporized benzene is:
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{M} = \frac{100 \, \text{g}}{78.11 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.28 \, \text{mol}.
   \]
   \[
   V = nRT/P = (1.28 \, \text{mol})(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(353.35 \, \text{K}) / 1 \, \text{atm} \approx 37.1 \, \text{L}.
   \]
   The work done is:
   \[
   W_{\text{rev}} = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V = -1 \, \text{atm} \times 37.1 \, \text{L} = -37.1 \, \text{L·atm}.
   \]
   Converting to calories (\( 1 \, \text{L·atm} = 24.71 \, \text{cal} \)):
   \[
   W_{\text{rev}} = -37.1 \times 24.71 \approx -914 \, \text{cal}.
   \]
   The closest option is \( W_{\text{rev}} = -898 \, \text{cal} \), likely due to rounding.

#### 4. **Change in Internal Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:
   Using the relation \( \Delta E = q + W_{\text{rev}} \):
   \[
   \Delta E = 9440 \, \text{cal} + (-914 \, \text{cal}) = 8526 \, \text{cal}.
   \]
   The closest option is \( \Delta E = 8542 \, \text{cal} \), again likely due to rounding.

---

### Final Answer:
The calculations align most closely with **Option A**.
