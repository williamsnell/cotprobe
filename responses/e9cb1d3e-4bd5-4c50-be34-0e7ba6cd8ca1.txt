Okay, so I need to figure out the earnings per share (EPS) for Toft Co. for the year. Let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that EPS is calculated by taking the net income, subtracting the preferred dividends, and then dividing by the average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Oh wait, right, because preferred shares are considered as well since they have a claim on the earnings before common shareholders do.

So, looking at the data: Toft Co. had 120,000 shares of common stock at the beginning of the year. Then on April 1, they issued an additional 40,000 shares. So I need to calculate the average number of common shares outstanding for the entire year.

Wait, how do I calculate that? Since the 40,000 shares were issued on April 1, they were outstanding for 9 months of the year (from April to December). So for the first 3 months (January to March), there were 120,000 shares, and for the remaining 9 months, there were 160,000 shares (120,000 + 40,000).

To find the average, I'll calculate the weighted average. So the first part is 120,000 shares * 3/12 (which is 0.25) and the second part is 160,000 shares * 9/12 (which is 0.75). 

Calculating that: 120,000 * 0.25 = 30,000. And 160,000 * 0.75 = 120,000. Adding those together, 30,000 + 120,000 = 150,000. So the average common shares outstanding are 150,000.

Next, the net income is given as $480,000. But I need to subtract the preferred dividends. The company had 10,000 shares of nonconvertible preferred stock, each with a dividend of $5. So the total preferred dividends are 10,000 * $5 = $50,000.

So the earnings available to common shareholders are $480,000 - $50,000 = $430,000.

Now, EPS is net income available to common shareholders divided by average common shares. That's $430,000 / 150,000. Let me do that division: 430,000 divided by 150,000. Hmm, 150,000 * 2.866 is around 430,000. So that's approximately $2.87 per share.

Looking at the options, H is $2.87. So the answer should be H.

To calculate Toft Co.'s earnings per share (EPS) for the year:

1. **Determine the average number of common shares outstanding:**
   - From January 1 to March 31 (3 months): 120,000 shares.
   - From April 1 to December 31 (9 months): 160,000 shares (120,000 + 40,000).
   - Weighted average: (120,000 × 3/12) + (160,000 × 9/12) = 30,000 + 120,000 = **150,000 shares**.

2. **Calculate preferred dividends:**
   - 10,000 shares × $5 dividend = **$50,000**.

3. **Compute net income available to common shareholders:**
   - $480,000 net income - $50,000 preferred dividends = **$430,000**.

4. **Calculate EPS:**
   - $430,000 / 150,000 = **$2.87**.

The correct answer is **H: $2.87**.
