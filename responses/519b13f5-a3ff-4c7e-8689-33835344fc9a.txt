Question:

Each liter of human blood serum contains about 3.4 g of sodium ions (Na^+, ionic weight = 23 g/mole) . What is the molarityof Na^+ in human blood serum?

Options:

A: 0.15 M
B: 0.10 M
C: 1.48 M
D: 2.30 M
E: 3.4 M
F: 1.00 M
G: 23 M
H: 0.34 M
I: 0.50 M
J: 0.23 M

Answer:

Okay, so I need to find the molarity of Na+ ions in human blood serum. The question says that each liter has about 3.4 grams of sodium ions. Sodium's ionic weight is 23 g/mol. Hmm, molarity is moles per liter, right?

Wait, so if I have 3.4 grams of Na+ in one liter, I can find moles by dividing grams by molar mass. Oh, right, moles = grams / molar mass. So 3.4 g divided by 23 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 3.4 ÷ 23. Let's see, 23 times 0.15 is about 3.45, so 3.4 divided by 23 is approximately 0.1478 moles. So that's about 0.15 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.15 M. But wait, let me double-check. Did I do the division right? 23 times 0.1478 is roughly 3.4, yes. So yeah, the molarity should be around 0.15 M. So the answer should be A.

To determine the molarity of Na⁺ ions in human blood serum, we start with the given data: 3.4 g of Na⁺ per liter. The molar mass of Na⁺ is 23 g/mol. Using the formula for molarity (M = moles of solute / liters of solution), we calculate the moles of Na⁺ as 3.4 g ÷ 23 g/mol ≈ 0.1478 moles. This corresponds to a molarity of approximately 0.15 M. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

A: 0.15 M
