Okay, so I have this limit problem to solve: the limit as x approaches 0 of cosecant(x) minus cotangent(x). Hmm, I remember that csc is 1/sin and cot is cos/sin. So let me write that down.

csc(x) = 1/sin(x)
cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x)

So when I subtract them, I get [1/sin(x)] - [cos(x)/sin(x)]. Since the denominators are the same, I can combine the numerators. That would be (1 - cos(x)) / sin(x).

So the expression simplifies to (1 - cos(x))/sin(x). Now I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of this expression.

I remember that when x approaches 0, both sin(x) and cos(x) approach 0 and 1, respectively. So plugging in 0 directly, the numerator becomes (1 - 1) = 0 and the denominator becomes 0. That means we have a 0/0 indeterminate form, so I can use L'Hospital's Rule here.

L'Hospital's Rule says that if we have 0/0 or ∞/∞, we can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator and then take the limit again.

So let's differentiate the numerator: d/dx [1 - cos(x)] = sin(x). And the derivative of the denominator: d/dx [sin(x)] = cos(x). 

So now the expression becomes sin(x)/cos(x). That simplifies to tan(x). Now, taking the limit as x approaches 0 of tan(x). I know that tan(0) is 0, so the limit is 0.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when applying L'Hospital's Rule, especially with trigonometric functions, there might be another approach. Alternatively, I could use some trigonometric identities to simplify the expression before taking the limit.

Another thought: Maybe using the small-angle approximations. For very small x, sin(x) is approximately x, and cos(x) is approximately 1 - x²/2. So let me try plugging these approximations into the original expression.

So, (1 - cos(x)) is approximately (1 - (1 - x²/2)) = x²/2. And sin(x) is approximately x. So the expression becomes (x²/2) / x = x/2. As x approaches 0, x/2 approaches 0. So that also gives me a limit of 0.

Wait, but earlier when I used L'Hospital's Rule, I got 0, and the approximation also gives 0. So the limit should be 0. Looking at the options, E is 0. So the answer should be E.

Wait a minute, but maybe I made a mistake in applying L'Hospital's Rule. Let me check that again. The original expression after simplifying was (1 - cos(x))/sin(x). The derivatives: numerator is sin(x), denominator is cos(x). So sin(x)/cos(x) is indeed tan(x), which approaches 0 as x approaches 0. So both methods confirm that the limit is 0.

The limit of (csc(x) - cot(x)) as x approaches 0 is 0.
