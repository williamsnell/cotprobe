Okay, so I have this question about how tripling the sample size affects the confidence interval size. Hmm, I remember that confidence intervals involve the standard error, and the standard error is related to the sample size. Let me think.

The formula for the confidence interval is usually something like the sample mean plus or minus a z-score multiplied by the standard error. The standard error (SE) is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (n). So SE = σ/√n. 

If I triple the sample size, n becomes 3n. So the new standard error would be σ/√(3n). Let me see, since √3 is about 1.732, the new SE is the old SE divided by √3. That means the standard error gets smaller when the sample size increases. 

The confidence interval's margin of error is proportional to the standard error. So if the standard error is smaller, the margin of error should also be smaller. Specifically, since the SE is divided by √3, the margin of error (and thus the confidence interval size) would also be divided by √3. 

Looking at the options, which one says dividing by √3? Option E says divided by 0.577, which is 1/√3 (since √3 is about 1.732, and 1/1.732 is around 0.577). So tripling the sample size would make the confidence interval size about 0.577 times the original size. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The confidence interval width is inversely proportional to the square root of n. So increasing n by a factor of 3 would decrease the width by a factor of sqrt(3). So if the original interval was, say, 10 units wide, after tripling n, it would be 10 / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 units. That matches with dividing by 0.577 (which is 1/sqrt(3)) because 10 * (1/sqrt(3)) ≈ 5.77. 

So the correct answer should be E: It divides the interval size by 0.577.

The confidence interval size is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. Tripling the sample size reduces the standard error by a factor of √3, thereby dividing the confidence interval size by approximately 0.577 (which is 1/√3). 

Answer: E
