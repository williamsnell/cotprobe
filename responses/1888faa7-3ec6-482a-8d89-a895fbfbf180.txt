Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Joe and Mike ran the same race, and Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike. Mike finished at 4:02 p.m. I need to find out when Joe finished.

Hmm, since Joe finished before Mike, Joe's time should be earlier than Mike's. Mike's time is 4:02 p.m., so I should subtract 4 minutes from that to get Joe's finish time.

Let me do the math. 4:02 p.m. minus 4 minutes would be... well, 2 minutes minus 4 minutes isn't possible, so I need to go back a minute. So, 4:02 minus 4 minutes is 3:58 p.m. Because 4:02 minus 4 would take us back to 3:58. So Joe finished at 3:58 p.m.

Looking at the options, E is 3:58 p.m. So that should be the correct answer.
