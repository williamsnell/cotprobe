Okay, so I have this question about genetics and longevity. Hmm, I remember from my biology classes that genetics plays a role in how long people live. But I'm not exactly sure about the percentage. Let me think.

I think there's a lot of debate about nature versus nurture, right? Like, how much of our lifespan is determined by our genes versus our environment and lifestyle. From what I've heard, genes do play a significant role, but they're not the only factor.

Wait, I remember reading somewhere that about 20-30% of longevity is genetics. But wait, that's the heritability part. Or is it the actual influence? Maybe I'm mixing up some numbers. Heritability refers to how much of the variation in a trait is due to genetics in a population, not the absolute influence. So if heritability is around 20%, that doesn't mean genetics accounts for 20% of your lifespan, but that 20% of the differences between people are due to genes.

Wait, but the question is about the influence of genetics on longevity, not heritability. Oh, I'm getting confused. Maybe the influence is higher. I think some studies suggest that genetics contributes about a third to a person's lifespan. So that would be around 33%. 

Looking at the options, option A is 33% and option D is 20%. I'm not sure if it's exactly 33 or maybe a bit more. I've heard some sources say that genetics accounts for about 25-30%, which would be closer to 20-30%. But others say up to 50% when considering certain genes, like those related to aging. 

Wait, there's also the idea that while genetics has a significant impact, environment and lifestyle play a bigger role. So maybe the influence isn't as high as 50%. I think a commonly cited figure is that genetics accounts for about 15-25% of the variation in human lifespan. But the question is asking about the influence, not the heritability. Maybe the influence is higher because it's not just about variation but the overall impact.

Alternatively, I've heard that some twins studies suggest that genetics contributes about 20-30% to longevity. So if that's the case, 33% would be a reasonable estimate. But another thought: maybe the influence is higher because certain genes can have a strong impact, such as those related to diseases. So perhaps the actual influence is around 30-40%.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall specific studies. I think a study from the University of California found that about 20-30% of the differences in lifespan are due to genetics. So that would mean the influence is around 20-30%, which would make option A (33%) a good fit. But wait, other sources say that genetics can account for up to 50% when considering specific genes, but that's perhaps in certain populations or specific conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the overall contribution, not just the heritable part. So perhaps it's higher. I'm a bit torn between 20% and 33%. But considering that the influence is often stated to be around a third, I think 33% is more likely the answer. So option A.
