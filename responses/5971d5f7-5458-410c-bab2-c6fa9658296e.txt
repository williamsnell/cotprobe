Okay, so I've got this question about trypsin and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that trypsin is an enzyme. Enzymes are proteins, so option A says it's an organic compound made of proteins. That sounds right because enzymes are proteins, so A is true.

Option B says it's a catalyst that changes the rate of a reaction. Yeah, that makes sense too. All enzymes function as catalysts, so B is also a true statement.

Option C claims it's operative over a wide pH range. Hmm, wait. I think enzymes have optimal pH ranges. Trypsin, specifically, I recall, works best in a basic environment. The stomach has a high pH, so trypsin's optimal pH is around 8-9. If the pH is too low or too high, its activity decreases. So C seems incorrect because it's not active over a wide range but rather has a narrow optimal pH. So C might be the false statement.

Option D says the rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate. Yes, according to enzyme kinetics, at lower substrate concentrations, the reaction rate increases with more substrate until it reaches the enzyme's maximum rate (Vmax), where adding more substrate doesn't increase the rate anymore. So D is a true statement.

Putting it all together, the statement that is NOT true is option C because trypsin doesn't work well over a wide pH range; it's specific to a basic environment.

The statement that is NOT true about trypsin is option C, as trypsin operates best within a narrow pH range (basic), not a wide one.

Answer: C
