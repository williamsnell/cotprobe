Okay, so I have this question about Bessel's equation of order one, and I need to find the general solution. Hmm, let me think. I remember that Bessel's equations are second-order linear differential equations, and their solutions are called Bessel functions. 

The question is asking for the general solution, so I should recall what the general solution looks like for such equations. I think for a second-order ODE, the general solution is a combination of two linearly independent solutions. So the solution should involve two arbitrary constants, right?

Looking at the options, I see several choices. Option A looks like a combination of sine and cosine, which are solutions to the simple harmonic oscillator equation, not Bessel's. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B says y(x) = c1*y1² + c2*y2². Wait, that's squares of the Bessel functions. I don't think that's the general solution. The general solution should be a linear combination, not squares. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: y(x) = c1 y1(x) + c2 y2(x). That sounds familiar. Since y1 and y2 are two linearly independent solutions, their linear combination with constants c1 and c2 would form the general solution. So C looks correct.

Option D: y(x) = c1 x y1(x) + c2/(x y2(x)). Hmm, that seems more complicated. I think x multiplied by Bessel functions or something else, maybe related to regular and singular solutions. Not sure, but I don't recall the general solution being in this form. So probably not D.

Option E: y(x) = c1 y1(x)/(c2 y2(x)). That's a ratio, which might be a specific solution, but not the general form. The general solution has two additive terms, not a fraction. So E is out.

Option F: y(x) = c1 ln|x| + c2 x². That doesn't look like Bessel functions at all. More like solutions to other types of differential equations, like logarithmic or polynomial terms. So F is wrong.

Option G: y(x) = c1 y1(x) * c2 y2(x). Multiplying the solutions? I don't think so. The product isn't the general solution; the sum is. So G is incorrect.

Option H: y(x) = c1/y1(x) + c2/y2(x). That's the sum of reciprocals. Doesn't ring a bell for Bessel's equation. So H is likely wrong.

Option I: y(x) = c1 y1(x) - c2 y2(x). This is similar to C but with a minus sign. Wait, but in linear combinations, addition and subtraction are both allowed because the constants can absorb the signs. So I is effectively the same as C, just with a different sign. But I don't remember if the general solution includes a subtraction. Wait, no—C is a general combination with any constants, so including negative signs is already covered by the constants. Therefore, I is also a valid form, but the standard form uses plus signs. I'm a bit confused between C and I.

Option J: y(x) = c1 e^x + c2 e^{-x}. That's the general solution for the hyperbolic equation, like the modified Bessel equation maybe, but not the standard Bessel. So J is incorrect unless the question is about modified Bessel, but the question specifically says Bessel's equation of order one.

Wait, so going back. The general solution for Bessel's equation of order ν is y(x) = c1 J_ν(x) + c2 Y_ν(x), where J is the Bessel function of the first kind and Y is the second kind. For order one, it's y(x) = c1 J_1(x) + c2 Y_1(x). So in the options, if y1 and y2 represent J1 and Y1, then C is correct. 

But wait, sometimes in textbooks, the solutions are denoted as y1(x) and y2(x) to represent the two linearly independent solutions. So in the options, C is presented as c1 y1 + c2 y2, which aligns with the general solution. So I'm confident that C is the correct answer.

The general solution of Bessel's equation of order one is a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions, typically denoted as \( y_1(x) \) and \( y_2(x) \). This means the solution takes the form \( y(x) = c_1 y_1(x) + c_2 y_2(x) \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are arbitrary constants. Among the given options, only option C matches this structure.
