Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says: When a spinning system contracts in the absence of an external torque, its rotational speed increases and its angular momentum...? Then there are several options to choose from, labeled A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that angular momentum is a key concept here. I think angular momentum is conserved when there's no external torque. Oh right, the law of conservation of angular momentum states that if no external torque acts on a system, its angular momentum remains constant.

Wait, but the question says the system is contracting. So, if a system contracts, like maybe a figure skater pulling in their arms, they spin faster. Because when they pull their arms in, their moment of inertia decreases. Moment of inertia is like the rotational analog of mass, right? It's I = mr². So if the radius decreases, I goes down.

Angular momentum L is given by L = Iω, where ω is the angular velocity. If I decreases and L is conserved (because no external torque), then ω must increase to keep L the same. So that's why when a system contracts, its speed increases.

But the question is about what happens to the angular momentum. Since there's no external torque, the angular momentum should stay the same. So when the system contracts, even though the speed increases, the angular momentum doesn't change—it remains constant.

Looking at the options, option D says "remains unchanged." That makes sense because without external torque, L is conserved.

Wait, let me double-check. Could any other option make sense? Option G says increases. But if L increases, that would require a torque, right? Since torque τ is dL/dt. Without torque, L doesn't change. So G isn't correct.

Option E says becomes zero, which doesn't make sense because the system is still spinning; it's just spinning faster. So E is out.

Option F says varies depending on the mass. Well, mass distribution affects I, but since L is conserved, L doesn't vary—it's the same. So F isn't the right answer.

Options A, B, C, H, I, J don't seem right either. A says halves, which would imply L decreases, but no torque means L stays the same. B says doubles, but that's talking about speed, not L. C is about linear momentum, which isn't the case here. H says decreases, which would be opposite of what's happening. I and J introduce uncertainty, but L is conserved, so it doesn't vary or become unpredictable.

So yeah, the correct answer should be D: remains unchanged.

When a spinning system contracts without an external torque, its angular momentum remains unchanged due to the conservation of angular momentum. While the rotational speed increases because the moment of inertia decreases, the angular momentum stays constant.

Answer: D
