Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about photoelectrons and wavelengths. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that photoelectrons with a kinetic energy of 2 eV are emitted from a cesium surface. The work function, W_f, is given as 1.8 eV. I need to find the longest wavelength of light that could have produced this emission. The options are from A to J, with various nanometer values.

Hmm, right, I remember the photoelectric effect equation. It's Einstein's equation, right? The energy of the incoming photon has to be at least equal to the work function plus the kinetic energy of the emitted electron. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the equation is actually: 

The energy of the photon (E_photon) is equal to the work function (W_f) plus the kinetic energy (K.E.) of the emitted electron. So the equation should be E_photon = W_f + K.E.

Wait, but wait a second. No, wait. I think sometimes I get confused here. Let me double-check. When a photon hits a metal surface, its energy has to be at least equal to the work function for electrons to be emitted. If the photon's energy is higher than the work function, the excess energy becomes the kinetic energy of the electron. So the correct equation is E_photon = W_f + K.E. So in this case, the photon's energy must be at least W_f + K.E. But wait, the question is asking for the longest wavelength that can cause this emission. So the minimum energy needed is when the photon's energy just equals the work function plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron. So the photon's energy must be equal to or greater than the work function. But wait, in this question, the photoelectrons have a kinetic energy, so the photon's energy must be greater than the work function by that amount. So E_photon >= W_f + K.E.?

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the photon's energy is E_photon = W_f + K.E. Because the photon's energy is exactly equal to the work function plus the kinetic energy. So if the kinetic energy is 2 eV and the work function is 1.8 eV, then E_photon is 3.8 eV.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think. The photoelectric effect equation is: 

E_photon = W_f + K.E.

So yes, if K.E. is 2 eV and W_f is 1.8 eV, E_photon is 3.8 eV. Then, to find the wavelength, I can use the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength.

So rearranging that, λ = hc / E_photon.

I remember that hc is a constant, which is approximately 1240 eV·nm. Yeah, I think that's right. So if E_photon is in eV, then λ (in nm) is hc divided by E_photon in eV.

So putting the numbers in: hc = 1240 eV·nm, E_photon is 3.8 eV.

So λ = 1240 / 3.8. Let me calculate that. 

3.8 times 326 is 1240, because 3.8 * 300 = 1140, and 3.8 * 26 = 98.8. So 1140 +98.8 is 1238.8, which is close to 1240. So 326 nm? Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 326. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 3.8 times 326: let me compute 3.8 * 326.

Break it down: 3 * 326 = 978, 0.8 * 326 = 260.8. So total is 978 +260.8 = 1238.8, which is about 1240. So λ is approximately 326 nm. But looking at the options, the closest is D: 327 nm. That's very close. So option D would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Did I get the equation right? Because sometimes I get confused about whether it's E_photon = W_f + K.E. or E_photon = W_f + K.E. Wait, no, that's correct. Because the photon's energy is used to overcome the work function and then the remaining energy is the kinetic energy of the electron. So E_photon = W_f + K.E.

Alternatively, sometimes people write it as K.E. = E_photon - W_f, which would make sense. So in that case, E_photon = W_f + K.E. So 1.8 + 2 = 3.8 eV is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Work function is the minimum energy needed. So if the photon's energy is exactly the work function, the kinetic energy is zero. If it's higher, the excess is K.E. So yes, E_photon = W_f + K.E.

So with E_photon=3.8 eV, λ = 1240 /3.8 = 326.315... nm. So approximately 326 nm. But the options don't have 326; the closest is D:327 nm. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again to be sure. The options are:

A:450, B:350, C:375, D:327, E:265, F:300, G:250, H:410, I:290, J:395.

So 327 nm is option D. So that's the answer.

To determine the longest wavelength of light that can produce photoelectrons with a kinetic energy of 2 eV from a cesium surface with a work function of 1.8 eV, we use the photoelectric effect equation:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = W_f + K.E.
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = 1.8 \, \text{eV} + 2 \, \text{eV} = 3.8 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy of the photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( hc \) is approximately \( 1240 \, \text{eV·nm} \). Rearranging for wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{photon}}} = \frac{1240}{3.8} \approx 326.3 \, \text{nm}.
\]

The closest option to this value is **327 nm**, which corresponds to option D.
