Question:

A man owned real estate in fee simple. He transferred a life estate in it over to a friend for the friend's lifetime. When the fee simple owner died, the life estate owner conveyed his interest to his children.

C: Yes, the life estate owner became the owner in fee simple when the original fee simple owner predeceased him.
D: Yes, the children of the life estate owner now own the property in fee simple.
E: No, the life estate terminated upon the death of the fee simple owner, and the property reverts back to the fee simple owner's estate.
F: No, the children of the life estate owner have a leasehold interest, not a life estate.
G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a man owned real estate in fee simple, which means he owned it completely, with no time limit on his ownership. He then transferred a life estate in it to his friend. A life estate typically gives the friend the right to use the property for their lifetime, but upon their death, the property reverts back to the original owner or their heirs.

Now, the original fee simple owner (let's call him Owner A) dies. After Owner A's death, the life estate owner (Friend B) conveys his interest to his children. The question is, when Owner A's son (Heir C) sues the children, claiming that the life estate is now broken and he owns the property absolutely, do the children have an enforceable interest?

First, I need to understand what happens when the original fee simple owner dies. In a life estate scenario, the life tenant (Friend B) has the right to use the property until their death. The death of the original fee simple owner (Owner A) doesn't necessarily terminate the life estate. The life estate continues until Friend B dies. So, when Owner A died, Friend B's life estate wasn't affected yet. They still had the right to use the property during their lifetime.

Next, Friend B conveyed his interest to his children. Now, can a life estate owner transfer their interest? I remember that a life tenant can typically transfer their interest, but it's a bit nuanced. The transfer would create a transferee who holds a life estate pur autre vie (for another's life). However, if the life tenant (Friend B) transfers the entire remainder, that might be a problem because a life estate doesn't include the future interest. But in this case, Friend B only has a life estate, so he can transfer that. So, the children would hold the life estate, but only until Friend B dies.

Wait, but when Friend B transfers his life estate, does that mean the children now have a life estate? Or is there a different structure? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

When someone has a life estate, they can transfer it to others. So Friend B could deed the life estate to his children. That would mean the children now hold the life estate, but their interest would end when Friend B dies, because the life estate is tied to Friend B's life. Alternatively, if the transfer is for their own lives, but that's not the case here because the original life estate was for Friend B's life.

Wait, no. The original life estate was created for Friend B's life. So when Friend B transfers his life estate to his children, the children can't have a longer interest than the original. So their interest would still be subject to Friend B's life. Or, perhaps, when Friend B transfers his life estate, the children become the new life tenants, but their interest would only last as long as Friend B's life. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the life estate is for Friend B's life, so if he transfers it, the children would take it subject to Friend B's remaining life. Or perhaps the transfer would create a remainder for the children, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The original life estate was created for Friend B. When Friend B dies, the property reverts to Owner A's estate. Owner A died, but his estate would take it upon Friend B's death. So when Friend B transferred his interest to his children, he could only transfer what he had—the life estate. So the children now hold a life estate pur autre vie, but tied to Friend B's life. So when Friend B dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to Owner A's estate.

But the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest. So, when Friend B conveyed his life estate to the children, they have a right to the property for the remainder of Friend B's life. So as long as Friend B is alive, the children hold the life estate. When Friend B dies, the property reverts to Owner A's estate.

But the confusion arises when Owner A dies. Does that affect the life estate? No, because the life estate is appurtenant, meaning it's tied to Friend B's life, not to Owner A's. So Owner A's death doesn't terminate the life estate. It continues until Friend B dies.

So when Friend B conveyed his life estate to his children, they now hold a life estate pur autre vie, but subject to Friend B's life. So the children have an interest, but it's a life estate that ends when Friend B dies.

Now, looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: No, the life estate was broken when the owner of the fee simple interest died. This would be incorrect because the life estate wasn't tied to Owner A's life; it was for Friend B's life. So the death of Owner A doesn't break the life estate.

Option B: No, the life estate owner is not allowed to convey his interest to other persons. I think this is incorrect because a life estate can be transferred. The life tenant can convey their interest.

Option C: Yes, the life estate owner became the owner in fee simple when the original fee simple owner predeceased him. That's not correct. A life estate doesn't give fee simple ownership; it's a limited interest.

Option D: Yes, the children of the life estate owner now own the property in fee simple. No, because they only have a life estate, not fee simple.

Option E: No, the life estate terminated upon the death of the fee simple owner, and the property reverts back to the fee simple owner's estate. This is incorrect because the life estate is for Friend B's life, not Owner A's.

Option F: No, the children of the life estate owner have a leasehold interest, not a life estate. No, because Friend B conveyed his life estate, so the children have a life estate, not a leasehold.

Option G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons. That's correct, but the question is about whether the children have an enforceable interest, not whether the conveyance was allowed.

Option H: No, the life estate was broken when the life estate owner conveyed his interest to his children. This would suggest that transferring the life estate ends it, which isn't the case. The life estate continues, just with the children holding it.

Option I: Yes, the life estate owner's children inherited the life estate upon their father's death. No, because the conveyance happened during Friend B's lifetime, not upon his death.

So, the correct reasoning is that the life estate wasn't broken by Owner A's death. Friend B could transfer his life estate to his children, so they have a life estate. When Friend B dies, the property reverts to Owner A's estate. So the children have an enforceable life estate, but not fee simple.

Looking back at the options, which one aligns with this?

Option G says yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons. That's a correct statement about the ability to convey, but the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest. So G is correct in stating the conveyance was possible, but the question is about whether the children have an interest. So the answer would be yes, they have an enforceable life estate.

Wait, but looking at the options again. The question is whether the children have an enforceable interest. So the correct answer would be that they do have an enforceable interest because the life estate was transferable, and the children now hold it.

But looking at the options, the choices are whether they have an enforceable interest. So the correct answer would be G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons. But wait, the question is not about whether the conveyance was allowed, but whether the children have an enforceable interest.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The key is whether the life estate was still valid after the conveyance. So when Friend B conveyed his life estate to his children, they have a life estate. So when Friend B dies, the life estate ends. But as long as Friend B is alive, the children have the right to use the property.

So the children do have an enforceable interest, which is a life estate. Therefore, the correct answer would be G, because the life estate owner could convey his interest, making the children's interest valid.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option G is about whether the conveyance was allowed, not about the children's interest. The question is about whether the children have an enforceable interest. So perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E or H. Let me think again.

When the original fee simple owner (Owner A) dies, the life estate is still in effect for Friend B. Friend B can transfer his life estate to his children, so the children now hold a life estate. The life estate doesn't terminate upon Owner A's death because it's for Friend B's life. Therefore, the children have an enforceable interest, which is a life estate.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer would be that the children do have an enforceable interest. So which option says yes?

Option G says yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons. That's correct about the ability to convey, but the question is about the children's interest. So perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: When Friend B conveys his life estate to his children, he's transferring his interest. So the children now have a life estate, but the remainder is still with Owner A's estate. So the children can use the property during their father's (Friend B's) life, and upon his death, it reverts.

So the children have a life estate, which is enforceable. Therefore, the answer would be G, because they can convey it, but the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest. So the correct answer is G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.

Wait, but the answer options don't directly state that the children have a life estate. Let me check each option again.

Option E: No, the life estate terminated upon the death of the fee simple owner, and the property reverts back to the fee simple owner's estate. That would be incorrect because the life estate is for Friend B's life, not Owner A's.

Option G is about the conveyance, not the children's ownership. So the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest, which they do—they have a life estate. So the correct answer would be that the children have an enforceable interest, meaning the answer is G, which states that the life estate owner could convey it.

But wait, the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest. So the correct answer would be that they do, which would correspond to option G. Alternatively, perhaps option I is incorrect because the children didn't inherit upon Friend B's death but received it during his lifetime.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline:

1. Owner A conveys life estate to Friend B. So Friend B has a life estate; upon his death, it reverts to Owner A's estate.

2. Owner A dies. Friend B's life estate continues.

3. Friend B conveys his life estate to his children. So the children now hold the life estate, subject to Friend B's life.

4. When Friend B dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to Owner A's estate.

Therefore, the children have a valid, enforceable life estate. So the answer would be that they do have an enforceable interest.

Looking at the options, the only correct one is G, which says the life estate owner could convey his interest. But the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest, which they do, so the answer is yes, which is option G. Wait, no, option G is about the conveyance, not the children's ownership.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons. Because the question is whether the children have an enforceable interest, and since the life estate was transferable, they do. So the answer is G.

The correct answer is **G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.**

The man (Owner A) owned the property in fee simple and transferred a life estate to his friend (Friend B). A life estate allows the holder to use the property for their lifetime, with the property reverting to the original fee simple owner or their estate upon the life tenant's death. When Owner A died, the life estate held by Friend B was not terminated because it was tied to Friend B's life, not Owner A's. 

Friend B then conveyed his life estate to his children. A life estate can be transferred, and the children now hold the life estate, which is subject to Friend B's lifetime. The life estate remains enforceable, and the children have the right to use the property during Friend B's life. Upon Friend B's death, the property will revert to Owner A's estate. 

The key point is that the life estate was transferable, and the children now hold a valid, enforceable interest in the form of a life estate. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.**
