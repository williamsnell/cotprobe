Okay, so I have this equation here: 8y equals 56. I need to find out what y is. Hmm, let's think. I remember from school that when you have something like 8 times y equals a number, you need to solve for y. That usually means getting y by itself on one side of the equation.

So, the equation is 8 multiplied by y equals 56. To get y by itself, I should do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. So, I can divide both sides of the equation by 8. That way, on the left side, 8 divided by 8 is just 1, leaving me with y. And on the right side, 56 divided by 8 is what I need to calculate.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. If I have 8y = 56, dividing both sides by 8 should give y = 56/8. Yes, that makes sense. Now, I need to compute 56 divided by 8. Let me think about how to do that mentally.

I know that 8 times 7 is 56 because 8*7 is 56. So, 56 divided by 8 is 7. That means y should be 7. Let me check the options to see which one is 7. Looking at the options, H is 7. So, the answer should be H.

Wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check. If y is 7, then plugging it back into the original equation: 8*7 is 56, which matches the right side. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is H.

The equation 8y = 56 can be solved by dividing both sides by 8, resulting in y = 7. Therefore, the correct answer is H.

Answer: H
