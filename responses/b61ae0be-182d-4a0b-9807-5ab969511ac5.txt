Question:

Options:

A: this policy is morally problematic because it disrupts the natural order.
B: this policy is morally problematic because it negatively impacts biodiversity.
C: this policy is morally acceptable because it does not harm human beings.
D: this policy is morally unproblematic.
E: this policy is morally obligatory because it prioritizes human beings.
F: this policy is morally unacceptable because it eliminates several animal species.
G: this policy is morally obligatory because the environment ought not to exist.
H: this policy is morally problematic because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem.
I: this policy is morally problematic because it harms the environment.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Baxter's stance on a policy that wipes out several animal species without harming humans. I'm supposed to figure out what Baxter would say. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand who Baxter is. From what I remember, Baxter is a character from a thought experiment, right? He's a proponent of a theory that might be called "anthropocentrism" or "human exceptionalism." I think his main idea is that humans are the only beings with moral status. So, anything that doesn't affect humans isn't morally significant. 

The question says the policy would eliminate several animal species but not negatively affect humans. So, according to Baxter's view, since humans aren't harmed, the policy shouldn't be a moral issue. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up characters. I think another character, like maybe a utilitarian, would consider the greater good, but Baxter is different. He probably doesn't care about biodiversity or ecosystems for their own sake.

Looking at the options:

A: Disrupts natural order. Hmm, does Baxter care about natural order? I don't think so. He's more about human well-being.

B: Negative impact on biodiversity. But if it doesn't affect humans, Baxter might not see this as a moral problem.

C: Morally acceptable because no harm to humans. This sounds right because Baxter's stance is that only human interests matter.

D: Morally unproblematic. That's similar to C, but C is more explicit about acceptability.

E: Morally obligatory because it prioritizes humans. Wait, that seems more like a deontological view, but I'm not sure if that's Baxter's take. He might not say it's obligatory, just acceptable.

F: Unacceptable because it eliminates species. No, because the policy doesn't harm humans, so Baxter wouldn't find it unacceptable.

G: Obligatory because environment shouldn't exist. That doesn't make sense. The environment's existence isn't the issue here.

H: Problematic because it damages ecosystem integrity. Again, if it doesn't affect humans, I don't think Baxter would care about the ecosystem.

I: Problematic because it harms the environment. Same as H; environment's harm alone doesn't matter to Baxter.

So, the correct answer should be C: this policy is morally acceptable because it does not harm human beings. Baxter would say that since humans aren't affected, the policy is acceptable.

The correct answer is C: this policy is morally acceptable because it does not harm human beings. Baxter, who prioritizes human interests, would find the policy acceptable as it doesn't negatively impact humans.

C
