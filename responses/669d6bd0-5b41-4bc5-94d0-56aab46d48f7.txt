Alright, let's tackle this question about the Pledge of Allegiance. I'm a bit rusty on the exact wording, but I'll try to recall it. I remember it starts with "I pledge allegiance to the flag..." So the first part is about allegiance to the flag. Then it mentions the United States of America, so the next part is about the country. The next line talks about one nation, indivisible. That's where "indivisible" comes in. So far, I think the structure is: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Wait, so the last part after "indivisible" is "with liberty and justice for all." So the final words are "liberty and justice for all." But the question is asking for the final word. Let me break it down:

- I pledge allegiance...
- to the flag...
- of the United States of America.
- And to the Republic for which it stands,
- one nation under God,
- indivisible,
- with liberty and justice for all.

So the last words are "for all." But looking at the options, I don't see "for all" listed. The options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options are: A: unity, B: all, C: indivisible, D: allegiance, E: America, F: justice, G: liberty, H: stands, I: flag, J: one.

Wait, the last word after "justice" is "for all," but "all" is option B. So is the final word "all"? Because the pledge ends with "liberty and justice for all." So the last word is "all."

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the last word before "for all." Let me think again. The structure is "indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." So the last word is "all." So the answer should be B: all.

I think that's correct. So the final word is "all."
