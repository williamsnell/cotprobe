Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a dress that originally costs $47.50. It's on sale with a 30% discount, and then there's a 6% sales tax applied to the discounted price. I have to find the total price after these two changes.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to calculate the discount. The original price is $47.50, and it's marked down by 30%. So I need to find 30% of $47.50 and then subtract that from the original price to get the sale price.

Let me jot that down. The discount amount would be 30% of 47.50. To calculate that, I can convert 30% to a decimal, which is 0.30, and multiply it by 47.50.

So, 0.30 * 47.50. Let me do that multiplication. 47.50 times 0.30. Well, 47 times 0.3 is 14.1, and 0.50 times 0.3 is 0.15, so adding those together gives 14.25. So the discount is $14.25.

Now, subtracting that discount from the original price: $47.50 - $14.25. Let me subtract. 47 minus 14 is 33, and 0.50 minus 0.25 is 0.25. So that gives me $33.25 as the sale price after discount.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 47.50 minus 14.25. Let me double-check. 47.50 minus 10 is 37.50, then minus 4.25 is 33.25. Yes, that's correct. So the discounted price is $33.25.

Now, the next step is to apply the 6% sales tax to this discounted price. So I need to calculate 6% of $33.25 and then add that to get the total price.

Converting 6% to a decimal is 0.06. So, 33.25 multiplied by 0.06. Let me compute that. 33 times 0.06 is 1.98, and 0.25 times 0.06 is 0.015. Adding those together gives 1.995. Since we're dealing with money, we can round that to $2.00, but let me check again.

Wait, 33.25 * 0.06: Let me calculate it more accurately. 33 * 0.06 is indeed 1.98. 0.25 * 0.06 is 0.015. So 1.98 + 0.015 = 1.995. So that's $1.995, which is $2.00 when rounded to the nearest cent because we can't have fractions of a cent.

So the sales tax is $2.00. Now, adding that to the discounted price: $33.25 + $2.00 = $35.25.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Maybe I should try another way to calculate the tax. Alternatively, I can multiply 33.25 by 1.06 to include the tax directly.

So 33.25 * 1.06. Let me compute that. 33.25 times 1 is 33.25. 33.25 times 0.06 is 1.995, as before. So adding them together gives 33.25 + 1.995 = 35.245, which rounds to $35.25. So the total price is $35.25.

Looking at the options provided:

A: $38.50  
B: $39.95  
C: $47.50  
D: $40.00  
E: $36.75  
F: $35.25  
G: $34.00  
H: $31.50  
I: $42.00  
J: $33.25

So the correct answer should be F: $35.25.

The dress originally costs $47.50. After a 30% discount, the price becomes $33.25. Adding a 6% sales tax results in a total price of $35.25.
