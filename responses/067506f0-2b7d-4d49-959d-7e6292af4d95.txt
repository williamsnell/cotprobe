Question:

D: 38.2 psig
E: 40.1 psig
F: 52.9 psig
G: 48.3 psig
H: 44.7 psig
I: 46.5 psig
J: 30 psig

Okay, so I've got this problem about the pressure in a car tire changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember that pressure in a gas changes with temperature, and I think it's something to do with the ideal gas law. Let me try to work this out.

The problem says that in winter, the temperature was 32°F and the gauge pressure was 30 psi. Then in summer, the temperature rose to 122°F, and we need to find the new gauge pressure, assuming the volume didn't change and no air leaked out. So, same amount of gas, same volume, but temperature changed.

Wait, gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric pressure, right? So when they say 30 psi in winter, that's 30 psi above atmospheric. But for calculations, I think I need to use absolute pressure, which is gauge plus atmospheric. But wait, what's the atmospheric pressure? Oh, maybe I can assume it's standard, like 14.7 psi. So the absolute pressure in winter would be 30 + 14.7 = 44.7 psi.

But wait, no, maybe I don't need to worry about that because the problem says the volume didn't change, and the amount of gas is the same, so maybe I can use the combined gas law, which relates pressure and temperature when volume and moles are constant. The formula is P1/T1 = P2/T2, but wait, temperature has to be in Kelvin for that, right?

So first, I need to convert both temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Wait, no, actually, the combined gas law works with absolute temperatures, so I can use Celsius or Kelvin as long as both are in the same scale. Alternatively, I can use the ratio of Fahrenheit temperatures if I adjust for absolute zero, but that might be tricky. Let me think. Maybe it's easier to convert to Celsius first.

Wait, another approach: since the volume and the number of moles are constant, the pressure is directly proportional to temperature in Kelvin. So P1/T1 = P2/T2. But I have to make sure the temperatures are in Kelvin.

So, first, convert 32°F to Kelvin. The formula is K = (°F - 32) × 5/9 + 273.15. Let's calculate that. 32°F is 0°C, right? Because 32°F = 0°C. So 0°C is 273.15 K. So T1 is 273.15 K.

Now, 122°F. Let's convert that. 122 - 32 = 90. Multiply by 5/9: 90 * 5/9 = 50. Then add 273.15: 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K. So T2 is 323.15 K.

Now, using P1/T1 = P2/T2. P1 is 30 psi gauge. Wait, but I think in this formula, we need to use absolute pressure, not gauge. Because gauge is relative to atmospheric, and absolute pressure is what the ideal gas law uses. So I need to adjust for that.

So, absolute pressure in winter: 30 psi gauge + 14.7 psi (atmospheric) = 44.7 psi. So P1_abs = 44.7 psi.

Then, P2_abs = P1_abs * (T2 / T1) = 44.7 * (323.15 / 273.15).

Let me calculate that ratio: 323.15 / 273.15 ≈ 1.183.

So 44.7 * 1.183 ≈ let's see: 44.7 * 1 = 44.7, 44.7 * 0.183 ≈ 8.1661. So total P2_abs ≈ 44.7 + 8.1661 ≈ 52.866 psi.

But wait, the question asks for gauge pressure. So P2_gauge = P2_abs - atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric is 14.7 psi, so 52.866 - 14.7 ≈ 38.166 psi. Looking at the options, option D is 38.2 psig, which matches this.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the temperature conversion or the math.

Wait, 323.15 divided by 273.15: let me compute that more accurately. 323.15 / 273.15 ≈ 1.1832. So 44.7 * 1.1832 ≈ let's compute that.

44.7 * 1 = 44.7
44.7 * 0.1832 ≈ let's see:
44.7 * 0.1 = 4.47
44.7 * 0.08 = 3.576
44.7 * 0.0032 ≈ 0.14304
Adding those: 4.47 + 3.576 = 8.046, plus 0.14304 ≈ 8.18904.

So total P2_abs ≈ 44.7 + 8.18904 ≈ 52.889 psi.

Subtracting atmospheric: 52.889 - 14.7 ≈ 38.189 psi, which rounds to 38.2 psig. So option D is correct.

The pressure in a tire changes with temperature due to the ideal gas law. The problem involves calculating the new gauge pressure after the temperature rises, assuming no air leaks and constant volume. 

1. **Convert Temperatures to Kelvin**:  
   - Winter temperature: \( 32^\circ\text{F} = 0^\circ\text{C} = 273.15\ \text{K} \).  
   - Summer temperature: \( 122^\circ\text{F} = 50^\circ\text{C} = 323.15\ \text{K} \).

2. **Use Combined Gas Law**:  
   \( \frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2} \).  
   Since gauge pressure is given, convert to absolute pressure:  
   - Winter absolute pressure: \( P_1 = 30\ \text{psig} + 14.7\ \text{psi} = 44.7\ \text{psi} \).  
   - Solve for \( P_2 \):  
     \( P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 44.7 \cdot \frac{323.15}{273.15} \approx 52.9\ \text{psi} \).

3. **Convert Back to Gauge Pressure**:  
   \( P_2\ \text{gauge} = P_2\ \text{absolute} - 14.7\ \text{psi} = 52.9 - 14.7 \approx 38.2\ \text{psig} \).

Thus, the new gauge pressure is **38.2 psig**, corresponding to option D.
