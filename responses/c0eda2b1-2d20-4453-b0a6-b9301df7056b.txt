F: Statement 1 is only false for x > 0, statement 2 is always true
G: False for statement 1, statement 2 is true if x = 0
H: False, True
I: False, False
J: True for statement 1, statement 2 depends on the function

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ReLU and sigmoid functions. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: The ReLU's gradient is zero for x < 0, and the sigmoid gradient σ(x)(1-σ(x)) ≤ 1/4 for all x.

I remember that ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). So the derivative, or gradient, of ReLU is 1 when x > 0 and 0 when x < 0. But wait, what happens exactly at x=0? The function isn't differentiable there because it has a corner. So the gradient is zero for x < 0, which matches the first part of Statement 1.

Now for the sigmoid part. The sigmoid function is σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x)). Its derivative is σ(x)(1 - σ(x)). I think the maximum value of this derivative occurs where σ(x) is 0.5, because that's where the curve is steepest. Plugging in σ=0.5, the derivative becomes 0.5*(1-0.5) = 0.25. So the maximum value of the sigmoid gradient is 0.25, which is 1/4. That means for all x, the gradient is ≤ 1/4. So the second part of Statement 1 is true. Therefore, Statement 1 as a whole is true.

Next, Statement 2: The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.

The sigmoid function is smooth everywhere, so its gradient is continuous. That part is correct. Now ReLU's gradient: for x > 0, it's 1; for x < 0, it's 0. But at x=0, the left derivative is 0 and the right derivative is 1, so there's a jump discontinuity. Therefore, ReLU's gradient is discontinuous at x=0. So Statement 2 says ReLU's gradient is discontinuous, which is correct.

Wait, but Statement 2 says "the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient." Since ReLU's gradient is discontinuous at x=0, but elsewhere continuous (except at x=0), the overall gradient function for ReLU is discontinuous. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but looking back, the options are about whether each statement is true or false. Let me re-examine.

Statement 1 is true because both parts are correct. Statement 2 is also true because sigmoid has a continuous gradient and ReLU's is discontinuous.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says both statements are true. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but wait another moment. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check Statement 2 again. It says the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient. But actually, the gradient is a piecewise function. At x=0, the left derivative is 0, the right is 1, so the gradient is not defined at x=0, which makes the gradient function discontinuous. So Statement 2 is correct.

Therefore, both statements are true. So the correct option is B: True, True.
</think>

The ReLU function has a gradient of 0 for x < 0 and a discontinuity at x = 0. The sigmoid's gradient is always ≤ 1/4, making Statement 1 true. Statement 2 is also true as sigmoid's gradient is continuous and ReLU's is discontinuous.

Answer: B
