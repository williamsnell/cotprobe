Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a cylinder divided into two parts with a piston, and one part is heated. I'm trying to figure out how far the piston moves when the temperature changes. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, the setup: the cylinder is split into two equal volumes of 100 cm³ each. The piston has a cross-sectional area of 15 cm², so I guess that's the area over which the pressure acts. The initial temperature is 27°C, which I should probably convert to Kelvin for gas law calculations. So 27 + 273.15 is 300 K. Then one part is heated to 100°C, which is 373 K, and the other stays at 300 K. The piston and walls are insulators, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings except through the process of heating one part, I suppose.

Wait, so the cylinder is initially at equal pressure in both parts, right? Because it's divided by a piston and the temperatures are the same. So the initial pressure P_initial is the same on both sides. But when one side is heated, the pressure must change because temperature changes, and since the piston is free to move, the volume will adjust to balance the pressures.

Wait, no. Wait, the piston is in the middle initially, each part having 100 cm³. But when one side is heated, the piston can move, changing the volumes of each part. The system is thermally insulated except for the heating, so the process is adiabatic, but wait, no, because the problem says the walls are perfect insulators. So, the only heat exchange is the external heating of one part. So for that part, it's a process where heat is added, but for the other part, no heat is added. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the pressure change.

Wait, maybe I should consider each part separately. Let me think: Initially, both parts have the same pressure P, same volume V=100 cm³, same temperature T=300 K. So for each part, n is the same because the total gas is split equally, assuming ideal gas behavior.

When the temperature of one part is raised to 373 K, and the other remains at 300 K. The piston can move, so the volumes will change. Let me denote the change in volume for each part. Let me say that the piston moves a distance x, so the volume of the heated part increases by ΔV, and the other part's volume decreases by ΔV, because the total volume (200 cm³ initially) remains the same, but the piston allows redistribution. Wait, no, wait: the initial total volume is 200 cm³, split into two 100s. If the piston moves, each part's volume changes. Suppose the piston moves a distance x, then each part's volume changes by x times the cross-sectional area, 15 cm². So ΔV_heated = (15 cm²) * x, and ΔV_cooled = -(15 cm²)*x, perhaps? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, if the heated part's pressure increases, the piston moves to the right, making the heated part's volume larger and the other smaller.

Wait, no. Let's think: when you heat a gas, if it's allowed to expand, its pressure remains the same as the surroundings. So the initial pressure is P. When you heat one part, the pressure would increase, so the piston moves to allow that part to expand, which would decrease the volume of the other part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the process as the system being divided into two parts, each with their own temperature and pressure, and the piston moves until the pressures equalize. Because the piston is a perfect insulator, there's no heat transfer between the two gases except through the process of moving the piston, which I think is negligible because the walls are insulators. Wait, but the process is that one part is heated, so that part's temperature increases, and the other remains the same. The piston moves so that the pressures balance.

Wait, let me model this. Let me denote:

Initially, for each part:

n1 = n2 = n (since the total gas is split equally, assuming ideal gas)
V1 = V2 = 100 cm³ = 100e-6 m³ (if needed)
T1 = 300 K
T2 = 300 K
P = P_initial (same for both)

After heating:

For part 1 (heated), T1 = 373 K, and volume becomes V1 + ΔV.
For part 2, T2 remains 300 K, and volume becomes V2 - ΔV.

Wait, but the piston moves, so the change in volume for part 1 is +ΔV, and part 2 is -ΔV. Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. Alternatively, since the piston moves, the sum of the two volumes should remain the same. So if part 1's volume increases by ΔV, part 2's decreases by ΔV.

But wait, the piston's cross-sectional area is 15 cm², so the change in volume for each part is ΔV = A * x, where x is the distance the piston moves. So ΔV = 15 cm² * x. Since the initial volumes are 100 cm³ each, part 1's volume after movement is 100 + 15x cm³, and part 2's is 100 - 15x cm³.

Now, the pressure in each part after heating must be the same, because the piston is free to move and the system is in mechanical equilibrium. So P1 = P2 = P_final.

Using the ideal gas law for each part:

For part 1:
n1 * R * T1 / V1' = P_final

For part 2:
n2 * R * T2 / V2' = P_final

Since n1 = n2 = n (same amount of gas), and T1 and T2 are different, and V1' and V2' are different, but P_final is the same.

So, n R T1 / (100 + 15x) = n R T2 / (100 - 15x)

The n and R cancel out, so:

T1 / (100 + 15x) = T2 / (100 - 15x)

Plugging in T1 = 373 K and T2 = 300 K:

373 / (100 + 15x) = 300 / (100 - 15x)

Cross-multiplying:

373 * (100 - 15x) = 300 * (100 + 15x)

Compute both sides:

373 * 100 = 37300
373 * (-15x) = -5595x
300 * 100 = 30000
300 * 15x = 4500x

So:

37300 - 5595x = 30000 + 4500x

Bring like terms together:

37300 - 30000 = 4500x + 5595x

7300 = 10095x

So x = 7300 / 10095

Calculating that:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5:

7300 ÷5 = 1460

10095 ÷5 = 2019

So x = 1460 / 2019 ≈ Let's compute this.

2019 * 0.723 = 2019 * 0.7 = 1413.3; 2019 * 0.023 ≈ 46.437 → total ≈ 1459.737, which is close to 1460. So x ≈ 0.723 cm.

Wait, but the answer option E is 0.723 cm, so that's a possible answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute 7300 / 10095:

10095 × 0.723 ≈ 10095 × 0.7 = 7066.5; 10095 × 0.023 ≈ 232.285 → total ≈ 7298.785, which is close to 7300. So yes, x ≈ 0.723 cm.

So the piston moves approximately 0.723 cm, which is option E.

The problem involves a cylinder divided into two equal volumes of 100 cm³ each, with a piston of cross-sectional area 15 cm². Initially, both parts have the same pressure and temperature (27°C or 300 K). One part is heated to 100°C (373 K), while the other remains at 300 K. The piston can move to equalize the pressures in both parts.

Using the ideal gas law for each part after heating:

\[
\frac{T_1}{V_1'} = \frac{T_2}{V_2'}
\]

where \( T_1 = 373 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 300 \, \text{K} \), \( V_1' = 100 + 15x \, \text{cm}^3 \), and \( V_2' = 100 - 15x \, \text{cm}^3 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{373}{100 + 15x} = \frac{300}{100 - 15x}
\]

Cross-multiplying and solving for \( x \):

\[
373(100 - 15x) = 300(100 + 15x)
\]

\[
37300 - 5595x = 30000 + 4500x
\]

\[
7300 = 10095x
\]

\[
x = \frac{7300}{10095} \approx 0.723 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the piston moves approximately **0.723 cm**, corresponding to option **E**.
