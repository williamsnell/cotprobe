Okay, so I've got this question here about a stereo system and calculating the dollar markup. Hmm, let me think. I remember markup has to do with the difference between what a store sells a product for and how much it costs them. So the selling price minus the cost price should give me the markup, right?

The stereo system sells for $200, and the cost to the store is $120. So, I need to subtract the cost from the selling price. Let me do that: $200 minus $120. That equals $80. So the markup is $80. Looking at the options, option A is $80.00, which matches my calculation.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not mixing up markup with something else. Markup can sometimes be confused with profit, but in this case, since the question specifically asks for dollar markup, it's just the difference between selling price and cost. There's no mention of percentage markup here, so I don't need to calculate any percentages. It's straightforward subtraction.

So yeah, the answer should be A.

The markup is calculated by subtracting the cost from the selling price: $200 - $120 = $80.
