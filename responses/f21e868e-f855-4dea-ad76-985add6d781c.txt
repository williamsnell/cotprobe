Question:

Consider the following statements: (1) As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. (2) Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact. Which of these statements is True/False, as of 2020?

Options:

A: The first statement is unproven, the second is true
B: Neither statement has been definitively proven true or false
C: False, False
D: Both statements are partially true
E: The first statement is partially true, the second is false
F: The first statement is true, the second is unproven
G: True, False
H: True, True
I: False, True
J: The first statement is false, the second is partially true

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these statements is true or false. The question gives two statements and asks which option correctly assesses their validity as of 2020.

Statement (1): As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. I remember reading about the Easterlin paradox, which suggests that while richer countries do tend to have higher life satisfaction, there's also a point where additional wealth doesn't necessarily lead to more happiness. So, in general, getting richer does correlate with higher life satisfaction, but it's not a straightforward linear relationship. So I think statement (1) is probably true on average, but maybe the question is considering the general trend, so it's true.

Statement (2): Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact. I've heard that major life events like marriage can boost happiness in the short term, but people often return to their baseline levels after a while. For example, after a divorce, people might be unhappy initially but tend to adapt over time. So statement (2) seems to be true because these events do affect happiness but their impact isn't as long-lasting as one might think.

Looking at the options, option H says both statements are true. So I think the answer is H.

The first statement is generally true as richer countries tend to have higher life satisfaction, though the relationship isn't linear. The second statement is also true because major life events impact happiness but have limited long-term effects.

H: True, True

The last character of the response is H.

Answer: H
