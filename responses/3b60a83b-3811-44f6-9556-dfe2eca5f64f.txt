Okay, so I have this question about adrenaline and its effects on different parts of the body. I'm a bit rusty on my physiology, but let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that adrenaline is a hormone released by the adrenal glands, especially during the fight-or-flight response. It's part of the sympathetic nervous system, which is all about preparing the body for action. So, when you're scared or excited, adrenaline kicks in.

The question has three parts: (a) the digestive tract, (b) the iris of the eye, and (c) the heart beat. I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a) the digestive tract. I think adrenaline affects digestion by slowing things down because when you're in a stressful situation, digestion isn't the body's top priority. So, peristalsis, which is the movement of muscles in the digestive tract to push food along, probably slows down. Also, secretion of digestive juices like stomach acid might decrease because the body is conserving energy for more immediate needs. So, looking at the options, I'm looking for something that says slows peristalsis and reduces secretion.

Moving on to part (b) the iris of the eye. The iris has two types of muscles: radial muscles and circular muscles. When adrenaline is released, the pupils dilate to let in more light, which is helpful in a stressful situation for better vision. To dilate, the radial muscles contract, pulling the pupil open, while the circular muscles relax. So, looking at the options, I need an effect where the radial muscles contract, resulting in dilation.

Lastly, part (c) the heart beat. Adrenaline increases heart rate and strengthens the heart's contractions to pump more blood to the muscles and other vital organs. So the heart rate should accelerate and the heartbeat strengthens.

Now, looking at the options:

Option F says: (a) Slows peristalsis and reduces secretion, (b) Causes radial muscles to contract, resulting in dilation, (c) Accelerates and strengthens the heartbeat. That matches what I was thinking.

Option I: For (a), it says increases peristalsis and enhances secretion, which doesn't fit because I thought peristalsis slows.

Option J: (a) increases peristalsis, which is wrong. So F seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. Adrenaline's effects on the digestive tract definitely reduce activity, so slowing peristalsis and less secretion. Iris dilation via radial contraction. Heart rate up and stronger beats. Yep, F looks right.

The correct answer is F. Adrenaline slows peristalsis and reduces secretion in the digestive tract, causes radial muscles in the iris to contract for dilation, and accelerates and strengthens the heart rate.

F
