Question:

Terri opened a fast food restaurant. The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. She has to pay daily operational costs of $250 and labor costs of $400. What expression represents her total cost if she has had the restaurant open for “ D ” days?

Options:

A: 800,000 + 400 D
B: 250 + 800,000 D
C: 400 + 800,000 D
D: 800,000 − 650 D
E: 800,000 + 650 D
F: 800,000 + 150 D
G: 800,000 + 1050 D
H: 800,000 − 150 D
I: 650 + 800,000 D
J: 800,000 + 250 D

Okay, so I need to figure out the total cost expression for Terri's restaurant after D days. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. That's a one-time cost, so it's fixed and doesn't depend on the number of days the restaurant is open. So, whatever the expression is, it should include this $800,000 as a base.

Next, there are daily operational costs and labor costs. The daily operational cost is $250, and the labor cost is $400. Wait, are these per-day costs? It seems so. So each day, she incurs both these costs. To find the total variable cost, I should add these two together and then multiply by the number of days, D.

Let me calculate the total daily cost first. $250 (operational) + $400 (labor) equals $650 per day. So every day, she spends $650. Over D days, that would be 650 multiplied by D, so 650D.

Now, adding this to the initial cost. The initial cost is a one-time expense, so it's just added once. So the total cost should be the initial cost plus the daily costs multiplied by the number of days.

Putting that together, the expression would be 800,000 + 650D. Let me double-check the options to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options, option E is 800,000 + 650D. That seems correct. Option E should be the right answer.

The total cost includes an initial fixed cost of $800,000 plus daily costs of $650 (sum of $250 operational and $400 labor) multiplied by the number of days D. The expression is 800,000 + 650D.
