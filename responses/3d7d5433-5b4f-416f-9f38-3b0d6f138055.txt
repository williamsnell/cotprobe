Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the normal and tangential accelerations of a fluid particle moving according to the equations x = a t and y = b t - c t². Hmm, I remember that acceleration in curvilinear motion can be split into tangential and normal components. Let me try to recall how that's done.

First, I think I need to find the velocity vector. Velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time. So, let's compute dx/dt and dy/dt.

For x(t) = a t, the derivative dx/dt is simply a. That's straightforward.

For y(t) = b t - c t², the derivative dy/dt is b - 2 c t. Got it. So the velocity vector v has components (a, b - 2 c t).

Next, to find the acceleration, I need to take the derivative of the velocity vector. So, dv/dt will give me the acceleration vector. Let's compute that.

The derivative of dx/dt is 0 because a is a constant. The derivative of dy/dt is the derivative of (b - 2 c t), which is -2 c. So the acceleration vector a has components (0, -2 c). Wait, but wait, isn't acceleration also the second derivative of position? Let me double-check. Yes, because the first derivative is velocity, the second is acceleration. So a_x = 0 and a_y = -2 c.

Now, I need to find the tangential and normal accelerations. I remember that the tangential acceleration (a_t) is the component of acceleration in the direction of the velocity vector, and the normal acceleration (a_n) is the component perpendicular to the velocity.

The formula for tangential acceleration is a_t = (v · a) / |v|. And the normal acceleration is a_n = |v × a| / |v|. Alternatively, I think sometimes a_n is calculated using the formula sqrt(|a|² - a_t²), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to stick with the dot and cross products.

Wait, but let me clarify: the tangential component is the projection of a onto the velocity direction. So a_t = (v · a) / |v|. The normal component is the magnitude of the component perpendicular to the velocity, which is |v × a| / |v|. Alternatively, since a_t² + a_n² = |a|², but maybe that's when the acceleration is decomposed into tangential and normal components.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the total acceleration is the vector sum of a_t and a_n, so |a|² = a_t² + a_n². But let me proceed step by step.

First, compute the velocity vector v. As I found earlier, v = (a, b - 2 c t). The magnitude of v, |v|, is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)²).

The acceleration vector a is (0, -2 c). Let me write it as a = (0, -2c).

Now, let's compute the dot product of v and a: v · a = a * 0 + (b - 2 c t) * (-2 c) = -2 c (b - 2 c t).

The magnitude of a is sqrt(0² + (-2 c)^2) = 2 c.

But wait, the magnitude of a is |a| = sqrt(0 + ( -2c )^2 ) = 2 c.

Wait, no: the magnitude of a is sqrt(0^2 + (-2c)^2) = 2c. So |a|=2c.

Wait, but in the formulas, the tangential acceleration is (v · a) / |v|. So a_t = [ -2c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|.

But |v| is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2). So a_t = [ -2c (b - 2 c t) ] / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ).

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that the tangential acceleration is positive in some options. Hmm, but since acceleration is a vector, the sign indicates direction. But perhaps the question is just asking for the magnitude. Wait, the options have a_t as a fraction with numerator 2c (b - ct) or similar, but I have a negative sign here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the dot product. v is (a, b - 2 c t), a is (0, -2 c). So v · a = a*0 + (b - 2 ct)(-2c) = -2c (b - 2 c t). So yes, that's correct. So a_t is (-2c (b - 2 c t)) / |v|.

Wait, but looking at the options, in option C, the a_t is [2c (b - ct)] / sqrt(...). Hmm, that's positive, but mine is negative. So perhaps I should take the magnitude, but the problem says "Find the normal and tangential accelerations." So maybe they're just looking for magnitudes, so the signs would matter for direction, but perhaps the answer options present the magnitudes as positive. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute a_t as the time derivative of |v|, which is the rate of change of speed. Let me see: |v| = sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2). The derivative of |v| with respect to time is (1/(2 |v|)) * 2 (b - 2 c t) * (-2 c) ) = [ (b - 2 c t)(-2 c) ] / |v|. So a_t is this, which matches the previous result: a_t = [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|. So that's correct.

Now, the normal acceleration a_n is |v × a| / |v|. The cross product in 2D can be taken as the scalar magnitude |v_x a_y - v_y a_x|.

So v × a = (a)(-2 c) - (b - 2 c t)(0) ) = -2 a c. So the magnitude is | -2 a c | = 2 a c.

So a_n = (2 a c) / |v|.

Wait, that's interesting. So a_n is (2 a c) / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2).

Wait, but let me check this because the cross product in 2D for vectors (v_x, v_y) and (a_x, a_y) is v_x a_y - v_y a_x.

So yes, that's a (-2 c) - (b - 2 c t)(0) = -2 a c. So the magnitude is 2 a c.

So a_n = (2 a c) / |v|.

So putting it all together:

a_n = (2 a c) / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

a_t = [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

But looking at the options, the a_t in option C is [2c (b - ct)] / sqrt(...), which is similar but not exactly the same as my a_t. Wait, I have -2c (b - 2 c t) and option C has 2c (b - ct). Hmm, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me recheck the cross product.

v is (a, b - 2 c t), a is (0, -2 c).

So v × a = a*(-2 c) - (b - 2 c t)*0 = -2 a c. So that's correct.

So a_n is 2 a c / |v|.

So, looking at the options:

Option C: a_n = [2ca / sqrt( (a - 2ct)^2 + b^2 ) ] , a_t = [2c (b - ct) ] / same denominator.

Wait, but in my case, the denominator is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ), which is the same as sqrt( (a)^2 + (b - 2 c t)^2 ). Option C's denominator is sqrt( (a - 2 c t)^2 + b^2 ), which is different because it's (a - 2 c t) squared, whereas I have (b - 2 c t) squared.

Hmm, so that suggests I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm not accounting for something correctly.

Wait, let me think again about the velocity. The velocity components are v_x = a, v_y = b - 2 c t. So the speed |v| is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ), correct.

Wait, so the denominator in a_n is |v|, which is correct.

So looking at the options, which one matches a_n = (2 a c) / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ) and a_t = [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ).

Looking at option C: a_n is [2ca / sqrt( (a - 2ct)^2 + b^2 ) ].

Wait, that denominator is sqrt( (a - 2 c t)^2 + b² ), which is sqrt( a² -4 a c t +4 c² t² + b² ). While my |v| is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ), which is sqrt(a² + b² -4 b c t +4 c² t² ). So the denominators are different.

Option E: a_n = [2ca / sqrt( a² + (b + 2 c t)^2 ) ]

Hmm, that's not matching either.

Option G: a_n = [2ca / sqrt( a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ) ] and a_t = [2c (b - 2 c t) / same denominator ].

Wait, my a_t is [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|, but option G has a_t as [ 2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|. So the sign is positive.

Wait, but in terms of magnitude, perhaps the options present the magnitudes, not the actual signed components. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me think about the direction. The acceleration vector is (0, -2 c), which is purely in the negative y-direction. The velocity vector v has components (a, b - 2 c t). So the tangential acceleration is the projection of a onto v, which could be positive or negative depending on the direction of v.

But perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude, so the signs might not matter. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the formulas.

Wait, another approach: the normal acceleration can also be found using a_n = |a|^2 / |v|, but that's not correct. Wait, no, that's for cases where acceleration is entirely normal, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute a_t and a_n using the standard formulae.

Wait, a_t is the rate of change of speed, which is d|v|/dt. Let me compute that.

|v| = sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

d|v|/dt = (1/(2 sqrt(...))) * 2 (b - 2 c t)(-2 c) ) = [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|, which matches what I found earlier.

So that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, option C has a_n = [2ca / sqrt( (a - 2ct)^2 + b^2 ) ]

But wait, my a_n is [2 a c / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ) ]

So the denominator in option C is sqrt( (a-2ct)^2 + b^2 ) = sqrt(a² -4 a c t +4 c² t² + b² ), whereas my denominator is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ) = sqrt(a² + b² -4 b c t +4 c² t² )

So they're different unless a = b, which isn't stated. So option C's denominator doesn't match.

Option G's a_n is [2ca / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )], which matches my a_n. Then a_t is [2c (b - 2 c t) / same denominator ]

But wait, my a_t is negative. So in option G, a_t is positive, but in reality, it's negative. However, perhaps the options are giving the magnitude, so the sign might not matter. Or maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let's see:

Option C: a_t = [2c (b - ct)] / sqrt( (a - 2ct)^2 + b^2 )

Option G: a_t = [2c (b - 2ct)] / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

Hmm, but my calculation gives a_t as [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|, so the numerator is negative.

But in the options, option G's a_t is positive, so perhaps it's the magnitude. Or perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the direction of acceleration relative to velocity. Since a is (0, -2c), and v is (a, b-2c t), the dot product is negative, implying that a_t is negative, meaning the particle is decelerating in the direction of motion. But perhaps the options are giving the magnitude, so they take the absolute value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me double-check.

The cross product v × a is v_x a_y - v_y a_x.

v_x = a, a_y = -2 c.

v_y = b - 2 c t, a_x = 0.

So v × a = a*(-2c) - (b-2 c t)*0 = -2 a c.

So the magnitude is 2 a c. So a_n is 2 a c / |v|.

So that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, which one has a_n as (2 a c)/sqrt(a² + (b-2 c t)^2 ) and a_t as (-2 c (b-2 c t))/sqrt(...).

Looking at option G: a_n = [2 c a / sqrt(a² + (b-2 c t)^2 )], a_t = [2 c (b-2 c t) / same denominator ]

Wait, but my a_t is negative. So option G's a_t is positive, but the actual value is negative. So perhaps the options are giving the magnitudes, not the signed components. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo in the sign.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of a_t. Let me think again.

The velocity vector is (a, b-2 c t). The acceleration is (0, -2 c).

The tangential acceleration is the component of a in the direction of v. So if v is pointing in some direction, and a is pointing downward, the projection could be positive or negative.

But perhaps the options are showing the magnitude, so the sign isn't considered, but the formula for a_t would be | [v · a] | / |v|. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sign indicates the direction of acceleration relative to velocity. If a_t is negative, it means the acceleration is opposite to the direction of velocity, causing deceleration.

So looking back at the options:

Option C: a_t is [2c (b - ct)] / sqrt( ... )

Option G: a_t is [2c (b - 2ct)] / sqrt(... )

But my a_t is [ -2c (b-2ct) ] / sqrt(... )

Wait, but in my calculation, the numerator is -2c (b-2ct). So perhaps none of the options have this exact form, but let me look again.

Wait, looking at option C: a_t is [2c (b - ct) ] / sqrt( (a-2ct)^2 + b^2 )

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity expression. Wait, no, v is (a, b-2 c t), so the y-component is (b - 2 c t), not (b - c t). So option C's a_t has (b - c t), which is incorrect. So option C is out.

Option G: a_t is [2c (b - 2 c t) ] / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

Which matches the numerator I have except for the sign. So if I take the absolute value, it would match. But I'm not sure if the options are considering the magnitude or the actual component.

Wait, but the problem statement says "Find the normal and tangential accelerations." It doesn't specify whether they're looking for magnitude or vector components. However, in the options, some have the same denominator as mine, like option G.

Wait, let me look at option C again. Its a_n is [2ca / sqrt( (a - 2 c t)^2 + b^2 ) ]

Hmm, but that's different from what I have. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option G's a_n is [2ca / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ) ], which matches my a_n.

The a_t in option G is [2c (b - 2 c t) ] / same denominator. But according to my calculation, it's negative. So perhaps the options are giving the magnitude, but the signs would differ based on the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a_t.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for a_t as (dv/dt) · (v / |v| ), which is the projection of acceleration onto the unit tangent vector.

So a_t = (a · (v / |v| )) = (a · v) / |v|.

Wait, I think I confused a with acceleration vector earlier. Let me clarify: a_t is the component of acceleration in the direction of velocity. So a_t = (a · v) / |v|.

Yes, that's correct. So, a · v is (0)(a) + (-2 c)(b - 2 c t) = -2 c (b - 2 c t).

So a_t = [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|.

So the expression is negative, meaning that the acceleration is opposite to the velocity direction. But the options don't have a negative a_t. So perhaps the options are giving the magnitude, so the answer would be |a_t|, which would be 2 c (b - 2 c t) / |v|.

But wait, option G has a_t as [2c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|, so positive, which would mean the acceleration is in the same direction as velocity if (b - 2 c t) is positive. But according to my calculation, it's negative, so perhaps option G is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the a_t. Let me compute again.

v · a = a * 0 + (b - 2 c t)(-2 c) = -2 c (b - 2 c t).

So a_t = (-2 c (b - 2 c t )) / |v|.

So the numerator is negative. So if I factor out the negative, it's 2 c (2 c t - b) / |v|.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I should consider that the denominator in a_t and a_n could be expressed differently.

Wait, the denominator in a_n is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ), which is |v|.

Looking at the options, which one has a_n as (2 a c) / |v| and a_t as (-2 c (b - 2 c t)) / |v|.

Option G: a_n = (2ca)/sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ), a_t = [2c (b - 2 c t)] / same denominator.

Hmm, but I have a negative in a_t, so perhaps option G is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the problem is expecting just the magnitude, so the signs don't matter. So the magnitude of a_t would be | -2 c (b - 2 c t) | / |v|, which is 2 c |b - 2 c t| / |v|. But the options have it as [2c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|, which would be correct only if (b - 2 c t) is positive. Otherwise, the magnitude would have the absolute value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of a_t. Let me think: the acceleration is (0, -2 c). The velocity is (a, b - 2 c t). So the dot product is negative, implying that the acceleration is opposite to the velocity direction, so a_t is negative, meaning deceleration.

But perhaps the problem expects the magnitude, so the correct option would have a_t as [2c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|, but that would be correct only if (b - 2 c t) is positive. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where a_n is [2 a c ] / |v| and a_t is [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|.

Looking at the options, none of them have the negative sign in a_t. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the acceleration components differently. Let me think: the acceleration in terms of tangential and normal components is given by a = a_t T + a_n N, where T is the unit tangent vector and N is the unit normal vector.

But I think the earlier approach is correct. So perhaps the correct option is G, but with a_t having a negative sign, which isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the acceleration vector is (0, -2c), and I'm decomposing it into tangential and normal components. So the tangential component is in the direction of velocity, and the normal is perpendicular.

Wait, the velocity vector v is (a, b - 2 c t). The unit tangent vector T is v / |v|. The normal acceleration is |v × a| / |v|.

Wait, let me compute that again. The cross product of v and a is v_x a_y - v_y a_x = a*(-2c) - (b-2 c t)*0 = -2 a c. So |v × a| is 2 a c. So a_n = 2 a c / |v|.

So that's correct.

Now, the a_t is (v · a) / |v|. So v · a is -2 c (b - 2 c t). So a_t is (-2 c (b - 2 c t )) / |v|.

So the a_t has a negative sign. So looking at the options, the only option where a_n is [2 a c / sqrt(a² + (b-2 c t)^2 ) ] is option G. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but no, option C's a_n denominator is different.

Wait, option G has a_n = [2 a c / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ) ]

And a_t = [2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / same denominator.

But I have a_t as negative, so perhaps the correct option is not present. But wait, the problem might be expecting the magnitude, so the sign is ignored. So the answer would be option G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way I computed a_t. Let me think again.

The velocity vector is v = (a, b - 2 c t).

The acceleration vector is a = (0, -2 c).

The tangential acceleration is given by a_t = (a · v) / |v|.

So a · v = a * 0 + (b - 2 c t)*(-2 c) = -2 c (b - 2 c t).

So a_t = [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|.

But looking at the options, none have a negative a_t. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the magnitudes, so the signs are ignored. So a_t would be 2 c (b - 2 c t) / |v|, but in that case, option G's a_t is correct.

But wait, the problem statement says "Find the normal and tangential accelerations." It doesn't specify whether they're vector components or magnitudes. But in physics, accelerations are vectors, so signs matter.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me consider the options again.

Looking at option C: a_n = [2ca / sqrt( (a - 2ct)^2 + b^2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me compute the cross product again.

v = (a, b - 2 c t)

a = (0, -2 c)

v × a = a*(-2c) - (b - 2 c t)*0 = -2 a c.

So |v × a| = 2 a c.

So a_n = 2 a c / |v|.

The denominator is sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 ), so a_n matches option G's a_n.

Now, the a_t is [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|. So looking at the options, option G has a_t as [2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|, which is the negative of what I have.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I must have made a mistake in the sign. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the magnitude, so the answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me compute the acceleration components using the standard formulae.

The general formula for tangential acceleration is a_t = dv/dt, where v is the speed.

v = sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

dv/dt = [ (b - 2 c t)(-2 c) ] / sqrt(a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

Which matches my earlier calculation.

So a_t = [ -2 c (b - 2 c t) ] / |v|

So the a_t is negative, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the direction of the velocity. If the velocity is in the first quadrant, the acceleration is downward, so the a_t would be negative if the velocity is moving upward in y.

But perhaps the problem is expecting the magnitude, so the correct option is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is option G, despite the sign discrepancy, since it's the only option that matches the denominator for a_n.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by finding the velocity and acceleration vectors. The position of the fluid particle is given by \( x = at \) and \( y = bt - ct^2 \). 

### Step 1: Velocity Vector
The velocity components are obtained by differentiating the position equations with respect to time:
\[
v_x = \frac{dx}{dt} = a, \quad v_y = \frac{dy}{dt} = b - 2ct.
\]
Thus, the velocity vector is:
\[
\mathbf{v} = (a, b - 2ct).
\]
The magnitude of the velocity is:
\[
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{a^2 + (b - 2ct)^2}.
\]

### Step 2: Acceleration Vector
The acceleration components are obtained by differentiating the velocity vector:
\[
a_x = \frac{d}{dt}(v_x) = 0, \quad a_y = \frac{d}{dt}(v_y) = -2c.
\]
Thus, the acceleration vector is:
\[
\mathbf{a} = (0, -2c).
\]
The magnitude of the acceleration is:
\[
|\mathbf{a}| = \sqrt{0^2 + (-2c)^2} = 2c.
\]

### Step 3: Tangential Acceleration
The tangential acceleration is the component of \(\mathbf{a}\) in the direction of \(\mathbf{v}\):
\[
a_t = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{v}|}.
\]
The dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}\) is:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = a \cdot 0 + (b - 2ct)(-2c) = -2c(b - 2ct).
\]
Thus:
\[
a_t = \frac{-2c(b - 2ct)}{\sqrt{a^2 + (b - 2ct)^2}}.
\]

### Step 4: Normal Acceleration
The normal acceleration is the component of \(\mathbf{a}\) perpendicular to \(\mathbf{v}\). It can be calculated using:
\[
a_n = \frac{|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{a}|}{|\mathbf{v}|}.
\]
The cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{a}\) in 2D is:
\[
|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{a}| = |v_x a_y - v_y a_x| = |a(-2c) - (b - 2ct)(0)| = 2ac.
\]
Thus:
\[
a_n = \frac{2ac}{\sqrt{a^2 + (b - 2ct)^2}}.
\]

### Step 5: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
\[
a_n = \frac{2ac}{\sqrt{a^2 + (b - 2ct)^2}}, \quad a_t = \frac{-2c(b - 2ct)}{\sqrt{a^2 + (b - 2ct)^2}}.
\]
The denominator in both \(a_n\) and \(a_t\) matches the term \(\sqrt{a^2 + (b - 2ct)^2}\). Among the options, **Option G** matches \(a_n\) and has the correct form for \(a_t\) (ignoring the sign, as the problem likely focuses on magnitudes).

ANSWER: G
