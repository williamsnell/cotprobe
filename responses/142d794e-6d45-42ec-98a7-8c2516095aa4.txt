Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields. Let me read the problem again and think through it step by step.

The problem says: A particle with charge -q₁ is at the origin of the x-axis. We need to place another particle with charge -4q₁ somewhere on the x-axis such that the net electric field is zero at x = 2.0 mm. The options are given from A to J, with various positions.

Hmm, electric fields due to point charges. I remember that the electric field E created by a point charge Q at a distance r is given by E = kQ / r², where k is Coulomb's constant. The direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the charge. Since both charges here are negative, their electric fields will point away from them.

Wait, so the first charge is at the origin, which is (0,0), and we're looking to place the second charge somewhere on the x-axis, say at position x = a. The point where the net electric field is zero is at x = 2.0 mm. So I need to find 'a' such that the electric fields from both charges cancel each other at that point.

Let me visualize this. The first charge is at 0, and we're looking at a point at 2 mm. The second charge is somewhere else on the x-axis—could be either to the left of the origin or to the right, depending on the situation.

Wait, since both charges are negative, their electric fields at the point x=2 mm will push away. So if the second charge is placed to the right of the origin (positive x), its field at 2 mm would point to the left because it's negative. The first charge's field at 2 mm points to the left as well because it's negative. Wait, that would mean both fields are in the same direction, so they would add up, not cancel. That can't be the case for zero net field. So maybe the second charge should be placed on the other side of the origin, at a negative x position (to the left of the origin).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first charge is at 0, and the point is at x=2 mm. If the second charge is placed to the right of 2 mm, at x = a > 2 mm, then the field due to the second charge at 2 mm would point towards the left, same as the first charge's field. So their fields would add, making it harder for the net field to be zero. Alternatively, if the second charge is placed to the left of the origin (x negative), then at x=2 mm, the field from the second charge would point towards the right because it's a negative charge. So the first charge's field at 2 mm is to the left, and the second's field would be to the right. So maybe that's where they can cancel each other.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The direction of the electric field due to a negative charge is away from it. So if the second charge is at x = a (could be positive or negative), then at x=2 mm, the direction of E from each charge would depend on where 'a' is.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this systematically. Let's denote the position of the second charge as x = a. The point where the field is zero is at x=2 mm, so the distance from the first charge (at 0) is 2 mm, and the distance from the second charge (at a) is |a - 2 mm|.

The electric fields from both charges at x=2 mm must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the sum of the two fields should be zero. Since both charges are negative, their fields will point away from themselves. So let me think about their directions.

Case 1: Suppose the second charge is placed to the right of the origin, at a > 0. Let's say a is to the right of 2 mm, so a > 2 mm. Then, the field from the first charge at 2 mm is E1 = k*(-q₁)/(2 mm)², pointing to the left (since -q₁ is negative, field points away from it, which for x=2 mm is to the left). The field from the second charge at 2 mm would be E2 = k*(-4q₁)/(a - 2 mm)², pointing to the left because a > 2 mm, so the distance is (a -2 mm) to the right, and the field from a negative charge points away, so at x=2 mm, it's to the left. So E1 and E2 would both be to the left, adding up, making the net field more negative, not zero. So this case can't be possible.

Case 2: Suppose the second charge is placed between the origin and x=2 mm, so 0 < a < 2 mm. Then, the distance from the second charge is (2 mm - a). The field from the second charge at x=2 mm would point to the right because the charge is at a < 2 mm, so the direction is away from it, which for x=2 mm would be towards the right. The field from the first charge is to the left. So E1 is left, E2 is right. They could cancel each other if their magnitudes are equal.

Alternatively, if the second charge is placed to the left of the origin (a < 0), then the distance from x=2 mm is (2 mm - a), which is larger than 2 mm because a is negative. The field from the second charge would point to the right, since it's a negative charge, so at x=2 mm, the direction is right. The first charge's field is to the left. So again, their fields would be in opposite directions, and they can cancel each other.

Wait, but in both cases (a between 0 and 2 mm, or a <0), the fields can be opposite. So I need to set up the equation.

Let me denote the position of the second charge as 'a' on the x-axis. The point where the field is zero is at x = 2 mm. The electric field at that point due to each charge must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, E1 (from first charge at 0) is k*(-q₁)/(2 mm)^2, pointing to the left.

E2 (from second charge at a) is k*(-4 q₁)/(distance from a to 2 mm)^2.

The direction of E2 depends on where 'a' is. If a is to the right of 2 mm (a > 2 mm), then the distance is (a - 2 mm), and since the charge is negative, E2 points to the left. So E1 and E2 both to the left, can't cancel.

If a is between 0 and 2 mm (0 < a < 2 mm), then the distance is (2 mm - a), and E2 points to the right. So E1 is left, E2 is right.

If a is to the left of the origin (a < 0), then the distance is (2 mm - a), and E2 points to the right. So again, E1 is left, E2 is right.

So in both cases (0 < a <2 mm and a <0), the fields are in opposite directions. So let's set up the equation where E1 = E2 in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The sum of the fields is zero, so E1 + E2 = 0. But since they're in opposite directions, their magnitudes must be equal. So |E1| = |E2|.

Let me write the magnitudes:

E1 = k q₁ / (2 mm)^2 (since E is negative but taking magnitude)

E2 = k *4 q₁ / (distance)^2.

Wait, wait: The charge of the second particle is -4 q₁, so its magnitude is 4 q₁.

Wait, but wait: The direction of the fields must be opposite. So, when considering the signs, we can write E_net = E1 + E2 = 0.

But I think it's easier to set up the magnitudes and account for direction in the equation.

So, the electric field from the first charge at x=2 mm is E1 = (k*(-q₁))/( (2 mm)^2 ), which is to the left, so let's take it as negative.

The electric field from the second charge at x=2 mm is E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (distance from a to 2 mm)^2 ). The direction depends on 'a'.

If a is to the left of origin (a <0), the distance is (2 mm - a), so E2 = [k*(-4 q₁)] / ( (2 mm - a) )^2. The direction is to the right, so positive.

So, E_net = E1 + E2 = 0.

So,

E1 + E2 = 0

E1 is negative, E2 is positive (if a <0).

So,

( -k q₁ / (2 mm)^2 ) + ( k *4 q₁ / ( (2 mm - a) )^2 ) = 0

Let me write this equation:

( - k q₁ ) / ( (2 mm)^2 ) + ( 4 k q₁ ) / ( (2 mm - a)^2 ) = 0

We can cancel out k and q₁ since they are non-zero.

So,

-1/( (2 mm)^2 ) + 4/( (2 mm - a)^2 ) = 0

Rearranging,

4/( (2 mm - a)^2 ) = 1/( (2 mm)^2 )

Multiply both sides by (2 mm - a)^2 * (2 mm)^2 )

4*(2 mm)^2 = (2 mm - a)^2

Take square roots on both sides:

sqrt(4*(2 mm)^2) = |2 mm - a|

Which gives,

2*(2 mm) = |2 mm - a|

So,

4 mm = |2 mm - a|

This absolute value equation gives two possibilities:

1) 4 mm = 2 mm - a

2) 4 mm = -(2 mm - a) → 4 mm = a - 2 mm

Let's solve each case.

Case 1: 4 mm = 2 mm - a → a = 2 mm - 4 mm → a = -2 mm.

Case 2: 4 mm = a - 2 mm → a = 4 mm + 2 mm → a = 6 mm.

Wait, but earlier I thought a can't be to the right of 2 mm because then both fields would be to the left. Let me check.

Wait, in case a =6 mm (to the right of 2 mm), E2 would be to the left (since it's a negative charge at 6 mm, so field at 2 mm is to the left). But E1 is also to the left. Then, E1 and E2 would add, not cancel. So this would give a net field pointing left, not zero. Therefore, this solution a=6 mm can't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs when setting up the equation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when a=6 mm, which is to the right of 2 mm, the distance from the second charge is (6 mm - 2 mm) =4 mm. So the field E2 would be pointing to the left because the charge is negative, so field at 2 mm is to the left. E1 is also to the left. So E1 + E2 would be negative, not zero. So a=6 mm is invalid.

So the other solution is a=-2 mm. Let's check. The second charge is at x=-2 mm. The distance from x=2 mm is (2 mm - (-2 mm))=4 mm. The field E2 would be pointing to the right because the charge is negative and located at -2 mm, so the field at x=2 mm is to the right. E1 is to the left. So E1 is negative, E2 is positive.

So the equation becomes:

E1 + E2 = (-k q₁)/(2 mm)^2 + (4 k q₁)/(4 mm)^2 =0 ?

Let me compute:

(-k q₁)/(4 mm²) + (4 k q₁)/(16 mm²) = (-1/4) * (k q₁)/(1 mm²) ) + (4/(16)) * (k q₁)/(1 mm²) )

= (-0.25 + 0.25 ) * (k q₁)/(1 mm²) ) = 0. So yes, it works.

So a=-2 mm. But looking at the options, there's no option for -2 mm. Wait, the options are all positive mm positions. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the second charge could be placed on the same side as the point where the field is zero. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the second charge is placed between the origin and the point x=2 mm. Let's say a is between 0 and 2 mm.

In that case, the distance from the second charge to x=2 mm is (2 mm - a). The field from the second charge would point to the right (since it's negative, field direction is away from it, so from a towards higher x). The first charge's field at x=2 mm points to the left. So E1 is to the left, E2 is to the right. So their directions are opposite, and their magnitudes can cancel.

So let's set up the equation again in this case.

E1 = (k*(-q₁))/(2 mm)^2 → magnitude is (k q₁)/(4 mm²), direction left.

E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (2 mm - a)^2 ), direction right.

So E_net = E1 + E2 = 0 → E1 (left) = E2 (right).

So,

(k q₁)/(4 mm²) = (4 k q₁)/( (2 mm - a)^2 )

Cancel k q₁:

1/(4 mm²) = 4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )

Cross-multiply:

(2 mm - a)^2 = 4 *4 mm² → 16 mm² → (2 mm -a) = ±4 mm.

Taking square roots:

Case 1: 2 mm - a = 4 mm → a = 2 mm -4 mm → a= -2 mm.

But that's to the left of the origin, which we already considered.

Case 2: 2 mm - a = -4 mm → 2 mm +4 mm =a → a=6 mm.

Again, a=6 mm, which is to the right of 2 mm, but as before, the fields would both point to the left, so their sum can't be zero. So this solution isn't valid.

Hmm, I'm getting the same a=-2 mm and a=6 mm, but only a=-2 mm works. But the options don't have negative positions. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the signs correctly. Let's try again. The electric field from the first charge at x=2 mm is E1 = k*(-q₁)/(2 mm)^2 → direction is to the left (negative x-direction). The electric field from the second charge at x=2 mm is E2 = k*(-4 q₁)/( (a - 2 mm)^2 ) * direction.

Wait, wait, the position of the second charge is 'a', and the point is at x=2 mm. The distance is |a -2 mm|. The direction of E2 depends on whether 'a' is to the left or right of 2 mm.

If 'a' is to the right of 2 mm (a>2 mm), then the distance is (a-2 mm), and since the charge is negative, E2 points to the left. So E1 and E2 are both to the left, so their sum can't be zero.

If 'a' is to the left of 2 mm (a<2 mm), then the distance is (2 mm -a). The charge is negative, so E2 points to the right. So E1 is left, E2 is right. So their magnitudes can cancel.

So the correct setup is E1 (left) = E2 (right), so their magnitudes are equal.

So,

|E1| = |E2|

Which is:

(k q₁)/( (2 mm)^2 ) = (4 k q₁)/( (2 mm -a)^2 )

Cancel k q₁:

1/(4 mm²) = 4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )

Cross multiplying:

(2 mm -a)^2 = 4 *4 mm² → 16 mm²

So, 2 mm -a = ±4 mm.

Case 1: 2 mm -a =4 mm → a=2 mm -4 mm → a=-2 mm.

Case 2: 2 mm -a =-4 mm → a=2 mm +4 mm → a=6 mm.

Again, a=6 mm is invalid because then E2 would point to the left, same as E1, so they add, not cancel.

Thus, the only valid solution is a=-2 mm. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are all positive positions, so maybe I should consider that 'a' is to the right of the origin but not necessarily to the right of 2 mm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the second charge is placed between the origin and 2 mm (so 0 < a <2 mm). Let's see what happens.

In this case, the distance from the second charge to x=2 mm is (2 mm -a). The field E2 points to the right because the charge is negative. So E1 is to the left, E2 is to the right. So their magnitudes can cancel.

The equation is:

E1 = E2 in magnitude.

So,

k q₁/( (2 mm)^2 ) = k*(4 q₁)/( (2 mm -a)^2 )

Cancel k q₁:

1/(4 mm²) = 4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )

So,

(2 mm -a)^2 = 16 mm² → 2 mm -a = ±4 mm.

Case 1: 2 mm -a =4 mm → a= -2 mm. Not possible because a is between 0 and 2 mm.

Case 2: 2 mm -a =-4 mm → a=6 mm. Again, to the right of 2 mm, which we saw earlier is invalid.

Hmm, so this suggests that the only solution is a=-2 mm, but that's not among the options. The options given are positive positions. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider the possibility that the second charge is placed to the right of 2 mm, but somehow the fields cancel. But earlier, I thought that's impossible because both fields would point left.

Wait, let me try it numerically. Let me assume that the second charge is placed at a position a >2 mm. Then, E1 is to the left, E2 is to the left. So their sum would be more negative, not zero. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the second charge is placed between the origin and 2 mm, but I'm getting the same issue as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the signs again. Let me write the equation correctly, accounting for the directions.

E_net = E1 + E2 = 0

E1 is from the first charge: E1 = (k*(-q₁))/( (2 mm)^2 ) → direction is to the left, so E1 = -k q₁/(4 mm²) i.

E2 is from the second charge at a: E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (a -2 mm)^2 ) * direction.

If a is to the right of 2 mm (a>2), then (a-2 mm) is positive, and E2 points to the left, so E2 = -k*4 q₁/( (a-2 mm)^2 ) i.

So E_net = (-k q₁/(4 mm²) ) + (-4 k q₁/( (a-2 mm)^2 )) ) =0.

Which implies that:

-k q₁/(4 mm²) -4 k q₁/( (a-2 mm)^2 ) =0.

But this would require both terms to be negative, which can't sum to zero unless both are zero, which isn't possible. So no solution in this case.

If a is to the left of 2 mm (a <2 mm), then (a-2 mm) is negative, so the distance is |a-2 mm|=2 mm -a.

The direction of E2 is to the right because the charge is negative, so E2 = +k*4 q₁/( (2 mm -a)^2 ) i.

So,

E_net = (-k q₁/(4 mm²) ) + (4 k q₁/( (2 mm -a)^2 )) ) = 0.

Which gives:

(-1/(4 mm²)) + (4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )) =0.

Multiply through by (4 mm²)( (2 mm -a)^2 ):

- (2 mm -a)^2 + 16 mm² =0.

→ (2 mm -a)^2 =16 mm² → 2 mm -a= ±4 mm.

So,

Case 1: 2 mm -a=4 mm → a= -2 mm.

Case 2: 2 mm -a= -4 mm → a=6 mm.

Again, a=6 mm is to the right of 2 mm. As before, the E2 would be to the left, adding to E1, making net field non-zero. So only a=-2 mm is valid, but it's not among the options.

Wait, the options are all positive. Did I misinterpret the question? Let me read again.

Wait, the question says the second particle is placed on the x-axis. So it could be either side. The options are all positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction.

Wait, maybe the second charge's position is on the same side as the point where the field is zero. Let me think. Suppose the second charge is placed to the right of the origin, but at a position that makes its field to the right at x=2 mm. Wait, no, because the charge is negative, so the field at x=2 mm would point to the left if a>2 mm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of distances. Let me denote the distance from the origin to the second charge as d. If the second charge is placed at x=d, then the distance from x=2 mm to the second charge is |d -2 mm|.

The condition is that the net field at x=2 mm is zero. So,

E1 (from origin) + E2 (from d) = 0.

E1 is directed to the left (since charge is negative), and E2's direction depends on where d is.

If d is to the left of the origin (d <0), then E2 points to the right.

If d is between 0 and 2 mm (0 <d <2 mm), E2 points to the right.

If d is to the right of 2 mm (d>2 mm), E2 points to the left.

So, for the fields to cancel, their directions must be opposite. So either d <0 or 0 <d <2 mm.

Let me consider d <0 first.

E1 = (k*(-q₁))/(2 mm)^2 → E1 = -k q₁/(4 mm²) i.

E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (2 mm - d)^2 ) → since d is negative, 2 mm -d is greater than 2 mm. The direction is to the right, so E2 = +4 k q₁/( (2 mm -d)^2 ) i.

So,

E1 + E2 = 0 → (-k q₁/(4 mm²)) + (4 k q₁/( (2 mm -d)^2 )) ) =0.

Divide both sides by k q₁:

-1/(4 mm²) +4/( (2 mm -d)^2 ) =0 → 4/( (2 mm -d)^2 ) = 1/(4 mm² )

Multiply both sides by (2 mm -d)^2 *4 mm²:

4*4 mm² = (2 mm -d)^2 → 16 mm² = (2 mm -d)^2.

Take square roots:

±4 mm = 2 mm -d.

Case 1: 4 mm =2 mm -d → d=2 mm -4 mm → d= -2 mm.

Case 2: -4 mm =2 mm -d → d=2 mm +4 mm=6 mm.

Again, d=6 mm would place the charge to the right of 2 mm, leading to E2 pointing left, which can't cancel E1. So only d= -2 mm is valid. But that's not among the options.

Now, consider d between 0 and 2 mm (0 <d <2 mm).

In this case, the distance from d to 2 mm is (2 mm -d). The charge is negative, so the field E2 points to the right.

So,

E1 = -k q₁/(4 mm²) i.

E2 = +4 k q₁/( (2 mm -d)^2 ) i.

Set E1 + E2 =0:

(-k q₁/(4 mm²)) + (4 k q₁/( (2 mm -d)^2 )) )=0.

Divide by k q₁:

-1/(4 mm²) +4/( (2 mm -d)^2 )=0 → same as before.

So again,

4/( (2 mm -d)^2 ) =1/(4 mm² )

→ (2 mm -d)^2 = 16 mm² → 2 mm -d= ±4 mm.

Case 1: 2 mm -d=4 mm → d= -2 mm. Not valid since d is between 0 and 2 mm.

Case 2: 2 mm -d= -4 mm → d=6 mm, which is greater than 2 mm, so again invalid.

Hmm, so it seems the only solution is d=-2 mm, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made an error in interpreting the problem.

Wait, could the second charge be placed at x= -2 mm? The options don't include that. The given options are all positive.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of signs correctly. Let me try another approach.

The electric field is a vector. The net electric field at x=2 mm must be zero. So the contributions from both charges must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me set up the equation considering the directions properly.

At x=2 mm:

E1 = (k*(-q₁))/( (2 mm)^2 ) → direction: to the left (negative x-direction).

E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (x -2 mm)^2 ) → direction depends on x.

If x is to the left of 2 mm (x <2 mm), then (x-2 mm) is negative, so the distance is (2 mm -x). The field due to a negative charge points away, so from x towards 2 mm, which is to the right. So E2 would be positive (right direction).

If x is to the right of 2 mm (x>2 mm), then the distance is (x-2 mm), and the field points to the left (negative direction).

So, for the net field to be zero, E1 and E2 must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So,

E1 (left) = E2 (right) → their magnitudes are equal.

So,

|E1| = |E2|

→ (k q₁)/( (2 mm)^2 ) = (4 k q₁)/( (2 mm -x)^2 )

Cancel k q₁:

1/(4 mm²) =4/( (2 mm -x)^2 )

→ (2 mm -x)^2 = 4 *4 mm² → 16 mm² → 2 mm -x= ±4 mm.

Solving:

Case1: 2 mm -x=4 mm → x=2 mm -4 mm → x= -2 mm.

Case2: 2 mm -x= -4 mm → x=2 mm +4 mm → x=6 mm.

Again, same results. So x=6 mm is to the right, but E2 would be to the left, same as E1, which can't cancel. So only x=-2 mm is valid. But none of the options are negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me check the problem statement again.

Ah! Wait, the problem says the second charge is -4 q₁, not +4 q₁. So I used that correctly. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the second charge is placed to the right of the origin but between the origin and 2 mm. Let me test a=6 mm again, but maybe the signs are different.

Wait, when a=6 mm, the distance from the second charge to 2 mm is 4 mm. The field E2 would be (k*(-4 q₁))/(4 mm)^2, pointing to the left. So E1 is also to the left. So their sum would be more negative, not zero. So that can't be correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The only valid solution is a=-2 mm, which isn't among the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider the two charges and the point where the field is zero. Let me denote the position of the second charge as x=a.

The field from the first charge at x=2 mm is E1 = (k*(-q₁))/( (2)^2 ) = -k q₁/4.

The field from the second charge at x=2 mm is E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (a-2)^2 ). The direction depends on a.

For the fields to cancel,

E1 + E2 =0 → E2 = -E1.

So,

E2 = k*(-4 q₁)/( (a-2)^2 ) = -E1 = k q₁/4.

So,

k*(-4 q₁)/( (a-2)^2 ) = k q₁/4.

Cancel k q₁:

(-4)/( (a-2)^2 ) =1/4 → Multiply both sides by (a-2)^2 *4:

-16 = (a-2)^2.

But (a-2)^2 can't be negative. So no real solution. Hmm, that suggests no solution exists, which can't be right.

Wait, that can't be. I must have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, no. Let me correct the signs. The field E2 should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to E1.

So,

E2 = -E1 → [k*(-4 q₁)/( (a-2)^2 )] = -[ -k q₁/(4) ]

→ [ -4 k q₁/( (a-2)^2 ) ] = k q₁/4.

Multiply both sides by (a-2)^2:

-4 k q₁ = (k q₁/4) (a-2)^2.

Divide both sides by k q₁:

-4 = (1/4)(a-2)^2 → Multiply both sides by 4:

-16 = (a-2)^2.

Again, no real solution. So this suggests that there's no solution where a>2 mm.

Wait, maybe the second charge is placed to the left of the origin (a<0). Let me try that.

E2 = k*(-4 q₁)/( (a-2)^2 ), but since a<0, (a-2) is negative, so (a-2)^2 is positive.

The field E2 points to the right (since the charge is negative, and a<0, so from a towards higher x, which is to the right).

So,

E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (a-2)^2 ) → direction is right, so positive.

E1 = -k q₁/4 → direction left, negative.

For E2 = -E1,

k*(-4 q₁)/( (a-2)^2 ) = - ( -k q₁/4 )

→ (-4 k q₁) / ( (a-2)^2 ) = k q₁/4.

Divide both sides by k q₁:

-4/( (a-2)^2 ) =1/4 → Multiply both sides by (a-2)^2:

-4 = ( (a-2)^2 )/4 → Multiply both sides by 4:

-16 = (a-2)^2.

Again, no real solution. So this can't be.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Earlier approaches suggested a=-2 mm, but that's not an option. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by considering the ratio of the charges and distances.

Because both charges are negative, the point where the net field is zero must be between them. Wait, no. If both charges are negative, the field to the left of both would point to the left, and to the right of both would point to the right. But in between, the fields could cancel.

Wait, no. Let me think. The electric field due to a negative charge points away from it. So if the second charge is placed to the left of the origin, the field from the second charge at x=2 mm points to the right. The field from the first charge at x=2 mm points to the left. So between the two charges, their fields could cancel.

Wait, but if the second charge is placed to the left, then x=2 mm is to the right of the second charge. So the field from the second charge at x=2 mm is to the right. The field from the first charge is to the left. So their fields are opposite, which is what we want.

So the condition is that the magnitudes must be equal.

So,

E1 = E2 in magnitude.

E1 = k q₁/( (2 mm)^2 )

E2 = k *4 q₁/( (distance from a to 2 mm)^2 )

The distance is |a -2 mm|.

So,

k q₁/(4 mm²) = k *4 q₁/( (a-2 mm)^2 )

Cancel k q₁:

1/(4 mm²) =4/( (a-2 mm)^2 )

→ (a-2 mm)^2 =4 *4 mm² → (a-2 mm)^2=16 mm² → a-2 mm=±4 mm.

So,

a=2 mm ±4 mm.

Thus,

a=6 mm or a= -2 mm.

As before, a=6 mm is invalid because E2 would point left, same as E1. So only a=-2 mm is valid. But it's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the second charge to be placed to the right of 2 mm, but I'm not seeing how that can work. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the second charge is placed to the right of the origin but at a position that makes its field to the right at x=2 mm. No, because the charge is negative, so the field would point to the left.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try to write the equation again, ensuring the signs are correct.

The electric field from the second charge at x=2 mm must be in the opposite direction to the first charge's field. So,

E2 = -E1.

E1 is due to -q₁ at 0, so at x=2 mm, E1 = (k*(-q₁))/(2 mm)^2 → E1 = -k q₁/(4 mm²).

E2 is due to -4 q₁ at a, so at x=2 mm, E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/( (a-2 mm)^2 ). The direction depends on a.

If a is to the left of 2 mm (a <2 mm), then (a-2 mm) is negative, so (a-2 mm)^2 is positive. So,

E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/(positive) → E2 is negative, which is to the left. But E1 is also to the left. So their sum can't be zero. So this is invalid.

Wait, no. If a is to the left of 2 mm, the charge is at a<2 mm. So the field from this charge at x=2 mm points to the right because it's a negative charge. So E2 should be positive.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign in E2. Let me correct that.

E2's direction: since the charge is at a<2 mm, the field at x=2 mm points to the right (positive direction). So E2 is positive.

So,

E2 = +k*(4 q₁)/( (2 mm -a)^2 )

Because the distance is (2 mm -a).

So,

E_net = E1 + E2 = (-k q₁/(4 mm²)) + (4 k q₁/( (2 mm -a)^2 )) )=0.

Divide by k q₁:

-1/(4 mm²) +4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=0 → 4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=1/(4 mm² )

Cross-multiplying,

(2 mm -a)^2 *4 =4 mm².

→ (2 mm -a)^2 = (4 mm²)/4 → (2 mm -a)^2 = (1 mm²).

So,

2 mm -a = ±1 mm.

Case 1: 2 mm -a=1 mm → a=1 mm.

Case 2: 2 mm -a= -1 mm → a=3 mm.

Now, let's check these solutions.

Case1: a=1 mm. The second charge is at x=1 mm (between origin and 2 mm). The field E2 at x=2 mm is to the right. E1 is to the left. So their magnitudes should cancel.

E1 = k q₁/(4 mm²)

E2 =4 k q₁/( (2 mm -1 mm)^2 )=4 k q₁/(1 mm²)=4 k q₁.

So,

E1 = k q₁/4 → 0.25 k q₁ (left).

E2=4 k q₁ (right).

So, E_net = -0.25 k q₁ +4 k q₁ = 3.75 k q₁ → not zero. So this can't be correct. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me compute E2 correctly.

Wait, (2 mm -a) when a=1 mm is 1 mm, so (2 mm -1 mm)=1 mm. So,

E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/(1 mm)^2. Wait no, earlier I considered E2 as positive because the direction is to the right. But actually, the charge is negative, so E2 is negative? No, wait, no: the magnitude is 4 k q₁/(1 mm²), but the direction is to the right, so E2 is positive.

Wait, no, the field due to a negative charge at a point to its right is to the left. Wait, no, wait. If the charge is at a=1 mm (left of 2 mm), then at x=2 mm, the field due to this charge points to the right (since the charge is negative, the field points away from it, which for x=2 mm is to the right. So E2 is positive.

So,

E2 = +4 k q₁/(1 mm²) =4 k q₁.

E1 is -k q₁/(4 mm²) = -0.25 k q₁.

So,

E_net = (-0.25 +4 ) k q₁ =3.75 k q₁, which is not zero. So a=1 mm is not a solution.

Wait, but according to the equation, (2 mm -a)^2 =1 mm² →2 mm -a=±1 mm.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me re-express.

Earlier, I thought:

4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=1/(4 mm² )

Which gives,

(2 mm -a)^2 =16 mm² → (2 mm -a)=±4 mm.

But wait, no. Let me re-derive.

The equation after dividing by k q₁ is:

-1/(4 mm²) +4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=0 → 4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=1/(4 mm² )

→ (2 mm -a)^2 = (4 mm²) *4 → (2 mm -a)^2 =16 mm² → 2 mm -a=±4 mm.

So, a=2 mm ±4 mm.

Which gives a=6 mm and a=-2 mm.

Wait, perhaps earlier I made a mistake in the equation when considering the second charge to the left. Let me think again.

If the second charge is placed at a= -2 mm, then the distance from x=2 mm is 4 mm. The field from the second charge is to the right, so E2 is positive. E1 is to the left, negative.

E1= -k q₁/(4 mm²).

E2=4 k q₁/(16 mm²)=k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E_net= (-1/(4 mm²) +1/(4 mm²)) k q₁=0.

Which works.

But again, a=-2 mm is not an option. So, perhaps the problem expects the second charge to be placed to the right of the origin but in a way that the distance makes the fields cancel.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the distance when the second charge is to the right of x=2 mm.

Let me try a=6 mm. The distance from x=2 mm is 4 mm. The field from the second charge is to the left (since it's negative), same as E1. So their sum can't be zero. So a=6 mm is invalid.

Hmm, this is perplexing. All the valid solutions I'm getting are a=-2 mm and a=6 mm, but a=6 mm is invalid because fields add. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of distances without considering signs.

Let me denote the distance from the origin to the second charge as d. The point where the field is zero is at x=2 mm.

If the second charge is placed at d, then the distance from the second charge to x=2 mm is |d -2 mm|.

The field from the first charge is E1 = k q₁/( (2 mm)^2 ), direction to the left.

The field from the second charge is E2 = k*4 q₁/( (d-2 mm)^2 ), direction depends on d.

For the fields to cancel, their magnitudes must be equal and directions opposite.

So,

E1 = E2 in magnitude → k q₁/(4 mm²) =4 k q₁/( (d-2 mm)^2 )

Cancel k q₁:

1/(4 mm²) =4/( (d-2 mm)^2 )

→ (d-2 mm)^2 =16 mm² → d-2 mm=±4 mm → d=6 mm or d=-2 mm.

Again, same results. So the only valid solution is d=-2 mm, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the second charge to be placed to the right of the origin but between the origin and 2 mm. Let me think.

Wait, when a is between 0 and 2 mm, the distance from a to 2 mm is (2 mm -a), and the field from the second charge points to the right. So E2 is positive, E1 is negative. So,

E1 = -k q₁/(4 mm²)

E2 =4 k q₁/( (2 mm -a)^2 )

Set E1 + E2=0 → E2 = -E1 → 4 k q₁/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=k q₁/(4 mm² )

Cancel k q₁:

4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=1/(4 mm² )

→ (2 mm -a)^2 =16 mm² → 2 mm -a= ±4 mm.

So,

a=2 mm -4 mm → -2 mm (invalid), or a=2 mm +4 mm →6 mm (invalid).

So again, no valid solution in this region.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed such that the second charge is placed to the right of 2 mm, but with a certain distance that makes the fields cancel. But I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of E2 when a>2 mm. Let me re-express.

If a>2 mm, the distance from a to 2 mm is (a-2 mm). The field from the second charge (negative) at x=2 mm points to the left. So E2 is negative.

E1 is negative, E2 is negative. So their sum can't be zero.

Thus, the only valid solution is a=-2 mm, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, looking back at the options, I see that option J is 10 mm. Let me see if a=10 mm works.

At a=10 mm, the distance from x=2 mm is 8 mm. The field from the second charge is E2 =4 k q₁/(8 mm)^2 =4 k q₁/(64 mm²)=k q₁/(16 mm²).

E1 is k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E1 = k q₁/4 → 4 k q₁/(16 mm²).

E2 =k q₁/(16 mm²).

So,

E1 =4 E2 → their directions are both to the left, so sum is 5 E2 → not zero.

Thus, a=10 mm is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second charge is placed to the right of the origin, but at a position that makes the fields cancel. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup earlier.

Wait, perhaps the second charge is placed at a=6 mm, but then E2 would point to the left, same as E1. So their fields add, making a net field to the left, which is not zero.

I'm stuck. The only valid solution I can find is a=-2 mm, which isn't an option. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the calculations again.

Let me try a=8 mm. The distance is 6 mm. E2=4 k q₁/(36 mm²)=k q₁/(9 mm²).

E1 =k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E1= 0.25 k q₁/(mm²),

E2= (1/9) k q₁/(mm²)=≈0.111 k q₁/(mm²).

So,

E_net=0.25 -0.111=0.139 → positive, not zero. So no.

Alternatively, a=4 mm. Distance is 2 mm.

E2=4 k q₁/(4 mm²)=k q₁.

E1= k q₁/4.

So,

E_net= k q₁/4 +k q₁= 5/4 k q₁ → not zero.

Hmm. Let me try a=14 mm. Distance is 12 mm.

E2=4 k q₁/(144 mm²)=k q₁/(36 mm²).

E1= k q₁/(4 mm²)=9 k q₁/(36 mm²).

So,

E_net=9/36 -1/36=8/36=2/9 → positive, not zero.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second charge is placed to the right of the origin, but the point where the field is zero is on the same side as the second charge. Let me think.

Wait, the point x=2 mm is to the right of the origin. If the second charge is placed to the right of the origin, then the field from the second charge at x=2 mm could be to the right or left depending on its position.

Wait, no. The field from a negative charge at a point to its right would point to the left. So, for example, if the second charge is at a=6 mm, the field at x=2 mm would point to the left. So E2 is negative, same as E1. So their sum can't be zero.

Hmm, maybe the answer is a= -2 mm, but it's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem to find where the second charge should be placed so that the fields cancel. Let me try again.

The field from the first charge at x=2 mm is E1 = (k*(-q₁))/(2 mm)^2 → direction left.

The field from the second charge at x=2 mm is E2 = (k*(-4 q₁))/(d)^2, where d is the distance from the second charge to x=2 mm.

Wait, but the position of the second charge could be on either side. Let me denote the position as a, then d= |a -2 mm|.

The direction of E2 depends on whether a is to the left or right of 2 mm.

If a is to the left of 2 mm (a <2 mm), then d=2 mm -a, and E2 points to the right (positive).

If a is to the right of 2 mm (a>2 mm), then d=a-2 mm, and E2 points to the left (negative).

For the fields to cancel, E1 and E2 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So,

Case 1: a <2 mm.

E1 = -k q₁/(4 mm²).

E2 = +4 k q₁/( (2 mm -a)^2 ).

Set E1 + E2=0 → -k q₁/(4 mm²) +4 k q₁/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=0.

Divide by k q₁:

-1/(4 mm²) +4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=0 → 4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=1/(4 mm² )

→ (2 mm -a)^2=16 mm² → 2 mm -a=±4 mm.

So,

a=2 mm -4 mm= -2 mm (invalid, since a<2 mm).

Or,

a=2 mm +4 mm=6 mm (but a>2 mm, so this is case 2).

So, no solution in this case.

Case 2: a>2 mm.

E1 =-k q₁/(4 mm²).

E2= -4 k q₁/( (a-2 mm)^2 ).

Set E1 + E2=0 → -k q₁/(4 mm²) -4 k q₁/( (a-2 mm)^2 )=0.

→ -1/(4 mm²) -4/( (a-2 mm)^2 )=0 → -4/( (a-2 mm)^2 )=1/(4 mm² )

This implies,

(a-2 mm)^2 =-16 mm² → no real solution.

Thus, no solution in this case.

Thus, the only valid solution is a=-2 mm, which is not among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup or the problem has a typo.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the second charge to be positive. Let me check.

If the second charge is +4 q₁, then the fields would be in the same direction if placed to the left, but let's see.

E1 =-k q₁/(4 mm²).

E2 =k*(4 q₁)/( (2 mm -a)^2 ).

For net field zero, E1 + E2=0 → E2= -E1.

So,

k*(4 q₁)/( (2 mm -a)^2 ) =k q₁/(4 mm² )

Cancel k q₁:

4/( (2 mm -a)^2 )=1/(4 mm² )

→ (2 mm -a)^2=16 mm² →2 mm -a=±4 mm.

So,

a=2 mm -4 mm= -2 mm.

Again, not an option.

Alternatively, a=6 mm.

At a=6 mm,

E2 =4 k q₁/(16 mm²)=k q₁/(4 mm²).

E1= -k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E_net= (-1 +1 )=0. So it works if the second charge is positive. But the problem states it's -4 q₁. So this suggests that perhaps the problem intended the second charge to be positive, but that's not the case.

Given the options, perhaps the closest is option J:10 mm. But earlier calculation shows that it doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me try to find a solution among the options.

Looking at the options, option A is 12 mm, option B is4 mm, etc.

Let me try a=4 mm.

At a=4 mm, the distance from x=2 mm is 2 mm.

E2=4 k q₁/(4 mm²)=k q₁.

E1= -k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E_net= -0.25 k q₁ +k q₁=0.75 k q₁ → not zero.

No.

Option D:8 mm.

Distance from x=2 mm is6 mm.

E2=4 k q₁/(36 mm²)=k q₁/(9 mm²).

E1= -k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E_net= -0.25 +0.111= -0.139 → not zero.

Option H:8 mm same as D.

Option I:7 mm.

Distance=5 mm.

E2=4 k q₁/(25 mm²)=0.16 k q₁.

E1= -0.25 k q₁.

E_net= -0.25 +0.16= -0.09 → not zero.

Option E:5 mm.

Distance=3 mm.

E2=4 k q₁/(9 mm²)=0.444 k q₁.

E1= -0.25 k q₁.

E_net= -0.25 +0.444=0.194 → not zero.

Option F:6 mm.

Distance=4 mm.

E2=4 k q₁/(16 mm²)=0.25 k q₁.

E1= -0.25 k q₁.

E_net= -0.25 +0.25=0.

Wait, this works! So when a=6 mm, E_net=0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when a=6 mm, the second charge is at x=6 mm, which is to the right of x=2 mm. Then, the distance from x=6 mm to x=2 mm is 4 mm.

The field from the second charge at x=2 mm is E2= (k*(-4 q₁))/(4 mm)^2 = -k q₁/(4 mm²).

The field from the first charge is E1= (k*(-q₁))/(2 mm)^2= -k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E_net= E1 + E2 = (-k q₁/4) + (-k q₁/4 )= -k q₁/2 → not zero.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier calculation. What's wrong here?

Ah! I see the mistake. Earlier, I incorrectly assumed that E2 would be positive when a>2 mm, but since the charge is negative, E2 points to the left, making it negative. So,

E1= -k q₁/(4 mm²).

E2= -k q₁/(4 mm²).

So,

E_net= -2 k q₁/(4 mm²)= -k q₁/(2 mm²) → not zero.

Thus, a=6 mm is invalid.

Wait, but earlier when I considered a=6 mm with the second charge as positive, it worked. But with negative charge, it doesn't. So perhaps the correct answer is a=-2 mm, but it's not among the options. Hence, perhaps the problem has a typo.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the electric fields produced by two charges at the point \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \). The first charge, \( -q_1 \), is at the origin, and the second charge, \( -4q_1 \), is placed at an unknown position \( x = a \) on the \( x \)-axis. The goal is to find \( a \) such that the net electric field at \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \) is zero.

### Key Equations:
1. **Electric Field Magnitude**:  
   The electric field due to a charge \( Q \) at a distance \( r \) is given by:  
   \[
   E = \frac{k |Q|}{r^2}
   \]  
   where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant.

2. **Net Electric Field Condition**:  
   At \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \), the electric fields from the two charges must cancel each other:  
   \[
   E_1 + E_2 = 0
   \]  
   where \( E_1 \) is the field due to \( -q_1 \) and \( E_2 \) is the field due to \( -4q_1 \).

3. **Directions of Fields**:  
   - The field \( E_1 \) due to \( -q_1 \) at \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \) points to the left (negative \( x \)-direction).  
   - The field \( E_2 \) due to \( -4q_1 \) depends on its position \( a \):  
     - If \( a > 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \), \( E_2 \) points to the left.  
     - If \( a < 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \), \( E_2 \) points to the right.

### Case Analysis:
#### Case 1: \( a > 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \)
- Both \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) point to the left.  
- Since they are in the same direction, they cannot cancel.  
- **No solution** in this case.

#### Case 2: \( a < 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \)
- \( E_1 \) points to the left, and \( E_2 \) points to the right.  
- For cancellation:  
  \[
  |E_1| = |E_2|
  \]  
  Substituting the magnitudes:  
  \[
  \frac{k q_1}{(2.0 \, \mathrm{mm})^2} = \frac{4k q_1}{(2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - a)^2}
  \]  
  Cancel \( k q_1 \):  
  \[
  \frac{1}{(2.0 \, \mathrm{mm})^2} = \frac{4}{(2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - a)^2}
  \]  
  Solve for \( (2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - a)^2 \):  
  \[
  (2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - a)^2 = 16 \, \mathrm{mm}^2
  \]  
  Take square roots:  
  \[
  2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - a = \pm 4.0 \, \mathrm{mm}
  \]  
  Solve for \( a \):  
  - \( 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - a = 4.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \):  
    \[
    a = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - 4.0 \, \mathrm{mm} = -2.0 \, \mathrm{mm}
    \]  
    This is valid, as \( a < 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \).  
  - \( 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} - a = -4.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \):  
    \[
    a = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} + 4.0 \, \mathrm{mm} = 6.0 \, \mathrm{mm}
    \]  
    This is invalid, as \( a > 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \).

### Conclusion:
The only valid solution is \( a = -2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \). However, this value is not among the provided options. After checking all options, none satisfy the condition for the net electric field to be zero. Therefore, the problem may have a typo or the correct answer is not listed.
