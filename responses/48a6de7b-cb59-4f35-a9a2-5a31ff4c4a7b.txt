Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that a particle's kinetic energy is changing at a rate of -6.0 J/s when its speed is 3.0 m/s. I need to find the magnitude of the force on the particle at that moment. The options are A through J, with various values in Newtons.

Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that kinetic energy is related to velocity and mass. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = (1/2)mv². So, if the kinetic energy is changing, that means the velocity is changing, which implies there's acceleration involved. And from Newton's second law, F = ma, so force is mass times acceleration.

But wait, the problem gives me the rate of change of kinetic energy, which is the derivative of KE with respect to time, right? So d(KE)/dt = -6.0 J/s. I think the derivative of KE with respect to time is the power, which is the rate of work done. But how does that relate to force and acceleration?

Let me think. The derivative of KE would be d/dt [(1/2)mv²]. Since m is constant (assuming mass doesn't change), this becomes (1/2)m * d(v²)/dt. Using the chain rule, d(v²)/dt is 2v * dv/dt. So putting it all together, d(KE)/dt = (1/2)m * 2v * dv/dt. The 2s cancel out, so it's m*v*(dv/dt). But dv/dt is acceleration, a. So d(KE)/dt = m*v*a.

Wait, but I have d(KE)/dt given as -6.0 J/s. So m*v*a = -6.0 J/s. But I don't know the mass m yet. How can I find m?

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this to the work done by the force. The power (which is d(KE)/dt) is also equal to F * v, but wait, that's when the force is in the direction of velocity. Oh, but here the kinetic energy is decreasing, so the force is opposite to the velocity, hence the negative sign.

Wait, let me think again. The work done by a force is F * d, so the power is F * v, since d is distance and v is ds/dt. So power P = F * v. But if the force is opposite to the direction of motion, then P would be negative, which matches the given d(KE)/dt as -6 J/s.

So, if P = F * v, and P is -6 J/s, then F * v = -6.0. But since we're asked for the magnitude, I can take the absolute value. So F = |P| / v = 6.0 / v.

Wait, v is given as 3.0 m/s. So F = 6.0 / 3.0 = 2.0 N. Hmm, that would be option G, which is 2.0 N.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because earlier I thought about using d(KE)/dt = m*v*a. Let me see if that gives the same result.

From d(KE)/dt = m*v*a = -6 J/s. So m*v*a = -6. But if I use F = m*a, then a = F/m. Substituting that in, m*v*(F/m) )= F*v = -6. So again, F*v = -6. So F = -6 / v = -6/3 = -2 N. The magnitude is 2 N, so again option G.

Wait, but why did the first approach work? Because in both cases, I end up with F*v = -6, which gives F = -6/3 = -2 N. The magnitude is 2 N, so the answer is G.

I think that makes sense. So the force's magnitude is 2.0 N, which is option G.

The problem involves finding the magnitude of the force on a particle when its kinetic energy is changing at a rate of -6.0 J/s and its speed is 3.0 m/s. 

Using the relationship between the rate of change of kinetic energy (d(KE)/dt) and power, we know that power is also equal to the force multiplied by the velocity (P = F * v). Since the kinetic energy is decreasing, the power is negative, so P = -6.0 J/s. 

From this, we can solve for the force:  
\[
F = \frac{|P|}{v} = \frac{6.0}{3.0} = 2.0 \, \text{N}.
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the force is 2.0 N, corresponding to option G.
