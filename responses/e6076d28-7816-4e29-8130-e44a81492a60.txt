Okay, so I've got this question about systematic desensitization, and I need to figure out which step isn't part of it. Let me think through each option carefully.

Systematic desensitization is a behavior therapy technique where the goal is to reduce or eliminate a phobia. The basic idea is to gradually expose the person to the feared object or situation in a controlled way while they remain relaxed. This process helps them become less sensitive or fearful over time.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Having the client confront the actual feared object or situation. Wait, isn't that more like exposure therapy? I thought systematic desensitization typically starts with imagined exposure using techniques like guided imagery before moving to real-life exposure. So if the client is actually confronting the fear, that might be a different approach, maybe just exposure therapy without the systematic desensitization part. So A could be the exception.

Option B: Instructing the client to picture each fearful image while maintaining a relaxed state. That sounds exactly like what systematic desensitization does. They start with the least scary image and work their way up while staying relaxed. So B is part of it.

Option C: Constructing a hierarchy of feared images. Yeah, that's a key step. The therapist helps the client rank their fears from least to most intense. So C is definitely part of systematic desensitization.

Option D: Helping the client experience relaxation through hypnosis. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I know that systematic desensitization usually uses techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. Hypnosis might be a different method, maybe part of another therapy. But I'm not certain if this is outside the scope. I'll have to think more.

Option E: Instructing the client to express their feelings about each feared image. Wait, in systematic desensitization, the focus is on relaxation while imagining the fear. Expressing feelings might be more of a cognitive-behavioral approach or another therapy. I'm not sure if this is part of the standard steps. Maybe E isn't part of it.

Option F: Using exposure therapy to desensitize. Wait, isn't exposure therapy a broader term that includes systematic desensitization? Or is it the other way around? No, systematic desensitization is a specific form of exposure therapy that uses gradual exposure starting with imagination. So F is part of it because it's a type of exposure.

Option G: Using guided imagery to visualize confronting fears. That aligns with systematic desensitization because the client imagines the feared situation while relaxed. So G is part of it.

Now, I have to decide which one is the exception. The question is asking which is NOT a step in systematic desensitization.

Option A involves confronting the actual object, which is more direct exposure. Systematic desensitization usually starts with imagined exposure and then moves to real exposure. But is confronting the actual object part of the process? I think it is, but perhaps the exception is when they confront without prior imagined steps, but the question is about what's NOT a step. Alternatively, maybe the exception is another step.

Option D: Using hypnosis for relaxation. I'm not sure if hypnosis is part of systematic desensitization. I think the standard method uses relaxation techniques like deep breathing or muscle relaxation, not hypnosis. So D might be the exception.

Option E: Expressing feelings. I don't recall expressing feelings being a step in systematic desensitization. The focus is on relaxation while imagining the fear, not necessarily expressing or exploring emotions in that moment. So E could be the exception.

Wait, but the question is asking for the step that is NOT taken, so the correct answer is the one that's outside systematic desensitization.

Let me think again. Systematic desensitization steps usually are: 1) construct a fear hierarchy, 2) teach relaxation techniques, 3) use guided imagery to imagine each fear from least to most while relaxed.

So, options B, C, G are part of it. F talks about exposure therapy, which is broader, but systematic desensitization is a form of exposure, so F is part of it.

Option A: Confronting the actual object. That would be the last step after the imagined exposure. So A is part of it but perhaps later on. So A is a step, making it not the exception.

Option D: Hypnosis. I don't think systematic desensitization uses hypnosis; it uses relaxation techniques. So D is the exception.

Option E: Expressing feelings. Not part of the standard steps, so E is also a candidate.

Wait, but the question is about what is NOT done. So the exception is the step that's not part of systematic desensitization.

So the answer would be either A, D, or E.

Wait, another thought: Systematic desensitization doesn't involve expressing feelings about each image. It's more about relaxation and gradual exposure. So E is not a step. Or is it? Maybe in some approaches, but not in systematic desensitization.

Alternatively, option A is about confronting the actual object, which is part of the process, so not the exception.

So the exceptions are D and E.

But the question says "each of the following is a step EXCEPT", so one of them is the wrong step.

Between D and E, which is not part of systematic desensitization.

I think expressing feelings (E) isn't part of it. The steps involve relaxation and gradual exposure, not expressing or exploring emotions in that context.

Alternatively, hypnosis (D) might not be part of it. The standard method uses other relaxation techniques.

Wait, but some therapists might use hypnosis as a relaxation method, but is that standard? I'm not sure. The key steps are hierarchy, relaxation, and guided imagery.

So the options are A, D, E.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a step, so the correct answer is either A, D, or E.

Another angle: Systematic desensitization is about gradual exposure through imagination, then real exposure. It doesn't involve hypnosis or expressing feelings about each image; those are more like other techniques.

So the exception is the one that's not part of the steps. The possible exceptions are A, D, E.

Wait, option A: having the client confront the actual feared object. That's part of the later stages, so it's a step in systematic desensitization. So A is part of it, making it not the exception.

So the exception is either D or E.

I think E is not part of the steps. The therapist doesn't instruct the client to express feelings about each image during the desensitization process. The focus is on relaxation, not on expressing emotions.

So the answer is E.

The question asks which step is NOT part of systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization involves constructing a fear hierarchy, teaching relaxation techniques, and using guided imagery to gradually expose the client to feared objects or situations. 

- **Option A** involves confronting the actual feared object, which is part of the later stages of systematic desensitization after imagined exposure. Thus, it is a step.
- **Option B** involves picturing fearful images while relaxed, which aligns with the process of systematic desensitization.
- **Option C** involves constructing a hierarchy of feared images, a key step in systematic desensitization.
- **Option D** involves using hypnosis for relaxation, which is not a standard part of systematic desensitization, as it typically uses techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.
- **Option E** involves instructing the client to express feelings about each feared image, which is not a typical step in systematic desensitization, as the focus is on relaxation and gradual exposure, not emotional expression.
- **Option F** involves exposure therapy, which is broader but includes systematic desensitization as a form.
- **Option G** involves using guided imagery, which is part of systematic desensitization.

The exception is **Option E**, as expressing feelings about each feared image is not a standard step in systematic desensitization. 

Answer: E
