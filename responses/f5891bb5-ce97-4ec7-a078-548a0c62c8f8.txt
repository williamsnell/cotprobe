Okay, so I have this question about trends in sexual behavior among heterosexual adults in the US from 1988 to 1990. The question is specifically about the number of unmarried adults aged 20 to 45 who reported having multiple partners. The options are from A to J, each suggesting different trends for men and women.

First, I need to think about what I know regarding sexual behavior trends in that period. The late 80s and early 90s were a time when HIV/AIDS was becoming a significant public health issue, which might have influenced people's sexual behaviors. I remember that during the HIV/AIDS crisis, there was a push for safer sex practices, like using condoms and reducing the number of sexual partners.

If that's the case, maybe more people started to have fewer partners to reduce their risk of contracting HIV. This would suggest that the number of people with multiple partners might have declined. So, both men and women could have seen a decline in multiple partners.

Looking at the options, option C says both declined, and option G says men declined but not women. I'm not sure if the trend was the same for both genders or different. I think the fear of HIV/AIDS might have affected both men and women similarly, so perhaps both groups reduced their number of partners.

Wait, but I should also consider other factors. For example, social changes in the 80s and 90s, like the rise of the women's movement and greater sexual freedom for women. Maybe women became more socially accepted in having multiple partners, but I'm not sure if that trend was strong enough to offset the impact of the HIV/AIDS scare.

Alternatively, maybe the decline was more pronounced in one gender than the other. I'm trying to recall any studies or data from that period. I think the general trend was a decline in multiple partners for both, but I'm not entirely certain.

Another angle: in the 80s, there was a lot of education campaigns about safe sex, which would encourage people to have fewer partners. So maybe both men and women would have been influenced to reduce their number of partners, leading to a decline for both.

So, putting it together, the most likely answer is that both men and women saw a decline in the number of multiple partners during that time. That would correspond to option C.

The correct answer is C: declined for both men and women.
