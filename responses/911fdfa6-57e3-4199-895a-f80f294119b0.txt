Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do. The question is about the entropy change during the solidification of copper at its temperature of spontaneous solidification, which is 1120 K. 

From the problem, I know that copper normally solidifies at 1356 K, but it can be super-cooled to 1120 K before it starts solidifying on its own. I need to calculate the entropy change (ΔS) for this solidification process at 1120 K. 

The data provided includes the heat capacities of copper in liquid and solid states, and the standard enthalpy change of solidification. 

Let me note down the given data:
- Cu(l) ⇌ Cu(s)
- Cp,Cu(l) = 7.50 cal/(°C·mol)
- Cp,Cu(s) = 5.41 + 1.50 × 10^-3 T cal/(°C·mol), where T is in Kelvin.
- ΔH° = -3100 cal (since solidification is exothermic, this makes sense).

I remember that the entropy change for a phase transition can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = (ΔH) / T

But wait, that's the case when the process occurs at a single temperature. However, in this scenario, the solidification is happening at a temperature lower than the normal solidification temperature. So, perhaps the process involves cooling the liquid from the higher temperature to the solidification point and then solidifying.

Wait, no. The problem states that the solidification occurs spontaneously at 1120 K, which is the temperature where it starts solidifying. So I think the process is solidification at 1120 K, meaning liquid copper at 1120 K solidifies into solid copper at 1120 K.

So, the entropy change would be the entropy of the solid minus the entropy of the liquid at 1120 K. Alternatively, since the process is solidification (ΔH is negative), the entropy change should be negative because the system is becoming more ordered (solid from liquid).

But wait, the formula for entropy change when cooling a substance from T1 to T2 is the integral of dQ_rev / T, which can be expressed using heat capacities. Since we're cooling the liquid to the solidification point and then solidifying, perhaps we have two steps:

1. Cooling the liquid copper from its normal solidification temperature (1356 K) to the spontaneous solidification temperature (1120 K).
2. Solidification at 1120 K.

But wait, the problem says to find the entropy change for the solidification at 1120 K. So maybe I'm only considering the solidification process at that specific temperature, not the cooling beforehand. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The solidification occurs at 1120 K, so perhaps the process is just the solidification at that temperature, without considering the cooling from 1356 K. So the entropy change would be the entropy of the solid minus the entropy of the liquid at 1120 K.

But how do I calculate that? The standard entropy change for solidification is usually calculated using the standard enthalpy change and the standard temperature (often 298 K), but here we're dealing with a different temperature.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the entropy change for the process Cu(l, 1120 K) → Cu(s, 1120 K). So the entropy change is ΔS = [S(s) - S(l)] at 1120 K.

But I don't have the absolute entropy values, only the heat capacities and the standard enthalpy change. So perhaps I need to calculate the entropy change using the integral of dQ_rev / T along the process.

Wait, another approach: the entropy change for the solidification process at 1120 K can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = (ΔH) / T, but only if the process occurs at constant temperature. However, ΔH here is given at standard conditions, probably at 298 K. So if the process is happening at a different temperature, I might need to adjust ΔH for the temperature change.

Wait, but the problem states that ΔH° is -3100 cal. I'm not sure if that's at 298 K or at 1120 K. Hmm, probably at standard conditions (like 25°C or 298 K). But when solidifying at 1120 K, perhaps we need to calculate the entropy change using the enthalpy at that temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

ΔS = (q_rev) / T

Where q_rev is the heat released during solidification at 1120 K. Since solidification is exothermic, q_rev is negative. So ΔS will be negative as well.

But wait, the enthalpy change ΔH is the enthalpy of the products minus reactants. For solidification, it's exothermic, so ΔH is negative. So, ΔH = H(s) - H(l) = -3100 cal.

But how does temperature affect ΔH? Because ΔH° is usually given at a standard temperature, but here we're using a different T.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the entropy change using the formula for a phase transition at a different temperature. The general formula is:

ΔS = (ΔH / T) * (1 - (T2 / T1)) )

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Let me think: the entropy change for the process Cu(l, 1356 K) → Cu(s, 1356 K) is ΔS1 = ΔH° / 1356 K.

But in this problem, the solidification occurs at 1120 K, which is lower. So perhaps the process is cooling the liquid from 1356 K to 1120 K, then solidifying at 1120 K.

Wait, but the question is only asking about the entropy change for the solidification at 1120 K, not the cooling. So maybe I should consider the entropy change during the solidification at 1120 K, which would be the integral of dQ_rev / T during solidification.

In that case, dQ_rev is the heat released during solidification, which is ΔH, but adjusted for the temperature change from the standard temperature to 1120 K.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The formula for entropy change when a substance solidifies at a temperature T is:

ΔS = (ΔH_fusion) / T

But ΔH_fusion is the enthalpy change for melting, which is positive. Since solidification is the reverse, ΔH_solidification is negative. So:

ΔS = (-ΔH_fusion) / T

But wait, ΔH° given is -3100 cal for the solidification process. So:

ΔS = (-3100 cal) / (1120 K) 

Calculating that: 3100 / 1120 ≈ 2.76786, so ΔS ≈ -2.768 cal/(K·mol). But looking at the options, that doesn't match any. The closest is option F (-3.10), E (-2.28), etc.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Because the heat capacities are given, I might need to calculate the entropy change due to the temperature change of the substance during solidification.

Wait, the process isn't just solidification at 1120 K. Because the liquid is at 1120 K, but the standard enthalpy change is at a different temperature. So I think I need to calculate the entropy change for cooling the liquid from its normal solidification temperature (1356 K) to 1120 K, and then the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K.

Wait, no, because the problem says to determine the entropy change for the solidification at the temperature of spontaneous solidification (1120 K). So perhaps I only need to compute the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K, considering the heat capacity at that temperature.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the entropy change for cooling the liquid from 1356 K to 1120 K and then solidification at 1120 K. So the total entropy change would be the sum of the entropy change for cooling and the entropy change for solidification.

Wait, that makes more sense because the solidification happens at a lower temperature, so the system has to be cooled first.

So the process would be:
1. Cool Cu(l) from 1356 K to 1120 K.
2. Solidify Cu(l, 1120 K) → Cu(s, 1120 K).

So the total entropy change ΔS_total is the sum of the entropy change for cooling (ΔS1) and the entropy change for solidification (ΔS2).

Let me compute each part.

First, calculating ΔS1: entropy change when cooling Cu(l) from 1356 K to 1120 K.

The formula for entropy change when cooling a substance is:

ΔS = ∫ (Cp / T) dT from T_initial to T_final.

Since Cp for liquid copper is constant (7.50 cal/(°C·mol)), the integral becomes:

ΔS1 = Cp(l) * ln(T_final / T_initial)

Wait, no, ∫ (Cp / T) dT from T1 to T2 is Cp * ln(T2/T1). But since we're cooling, T_final < T_initial, so ln will be negative, leading to a negative entropy change.

So,

ΔS1 = Cp(l) * ln(T2 / T1)

Where T1 = 1356 K, T2 = 1120 K.

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔS1 = 7.50 * ln(1120 / 1356)

Calculating 1120 / 1356 ≈ 0.826.

ln(0.826) ≈ -0.190.

So,

ΔS1 ≈ 7.50 * (-0.190) ≈ -1.425 cal/(K·mol)

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for entropy change when cooling is actually:

ΔS = Cp * ln(T_final / T_initial) / (1), since the units are consistent.

But wait, the Cp is given in cal/(°C·mol), but the temperature is in Kelvin. Since 1 °C = 1 K, the units are compatible. So the calculation is correct.

Next, ΔS2 is the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K.

For this, we can use the formula:

ΔS2 = (ΔH_solidification) / T

But ΔH_solidification is the enthalpy change for solidification, which is given as -3100 cal (since it's exothermic).

So,

ΔS2 = (-3100 cal) / (1120 K) ≈ -2.768 cal/(K·mol)

Wait, but that would make the total entropy change:

ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = (-1.425) + (-2.768) ≈ -4.193 cal/(K·mol)

But looking at the options, none of them are around -4.2. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the approach. Let me think again. The problem states that copper can exist as a super-cooled liquid up to 1120 K, after which it starts solidifying spontaneously. So perhaps the process we're considering is the solidification at 1120 K, without any prior cooling from 1356 K. Because the liquid is already at 1120 K, so the entropy change is only for solidification at that temperature.

In that case, I should calculate the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K, which is:

ΔS = (ΔH_solidification) / T

But I need to make sure that ΔH_solidification is at 1120 K, not at the standard temperature.

Wait, but the given ΔH° is at standard conditions, which is typically 298 K. So perhaps I need to adjust ΔH for the temperature change.

So, the correct approach would be to calculate the entropy change for the solidification process at 1120 K, which involves two steps:

1. Cooling the liquid from 298 K to 1120 K.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) is given as -3100 cal. This is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of Cu solidifies at standard conditions (298 K). But when solidifying at a different temperature (1120 K), the actual ΔH will be different because the heat capacities affect the enthalpy.

So, to find the entropy change at 1120 K, I need to first calculate the enthalpy change at 1120 K, then divide by that temperature.

To calculate the enthalpy change at 1120 K, I can use the formula:

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + ∫ (ΔCp) * dT from 298 K to T

Where ΔCp is the difference in heat capacities between the products and reactants.

Since the reaction is Cu(l) → Cu(s), the ΔCp is Cp(s) - Cp(l).

So,

ΔCp = Cp(s) - Cp(l) = [5.41 + 1.50e-3 * T] - 7.50

Wait, but wait, the Cp for the solid is given as a function of temperature. So I can't directly subtract the constants because T is varying. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the average ΔCp between 298 K and 1120 K.

Wait, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the change in enthalpy from 298 K to 1120 K for both liquid and solid, then find the difference.

Let me think. The enthalpy change for the process Cu(l, 298 K) → Cu(s, 298 K) is ΔH° = -3100 cal.

Now, to find the enthalpy change for Cu(l, 1120 K) → Cu(s, 1120 K), I need to calculate how much the enthalpy changes when the temperature changes from 298 K to 1120 K for both phases.

So,

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + [∫ (Cp(l) - Cp(s)) dT from 298 to 1120]

Because the enthalpy change when heating a substance is given by the integral of Cp dT. For the process of solidification, the change in enthalpy will involve both the liquid and solid phases.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the enthalpy at 1120 K for both liquid and solid, then find their difference.

The enthalpy of the liquid at 1120 K relative to 298 K is:

H_l(1120) = H_l(298) + ∫ (Cp(l)) dT from 298 to 1120

Similarly, the enthalpy of the solid at 1120 K is:

H_s(1120) = H_s(298) + ∫ (Cp(s)) dT from 298 to 1120

Since H_s(298) is the standard enthalpy of the solid, and H_l(298) is the standard enthalpy of the liquid, their difference is ΔH° = -3100 cal.

So, the enthalpy change at 1120 K would be:

ΔH(1120) = H_s(1120) - H_l(1120) = [H_s(298) + ∫ Cp(s) dT] - [H_l(298) + ∫ Cp(l) dT]

= [H_s(298) - H_l(298)] + ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) dT from 298 to 1120

= ΔH° + ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) dT from 298 to 1120

So,

ΔH(1120) = (-3100 cal) + ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) dT from 298 to 1120

Now, Cp(l) is constant at 7.50 cal/(°C·mol), and Cp(s) is 5.41 + (1.50e-3) T cal/(°C·mol).

So,

Cp(s) - Cp(l) = (5.41 + 1.50e-3 T) - 7.50 = (5.41 -7.50) + 1.50e-3 T = (-2.09) + 0.0015 T

So, the integral becomes:

∫ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T) dT from 298 to 1120

Integrating term by term:

= [-2.09 T + 0.0015*(T²/2)] evaluated from 298 to 1120

Compute each part:

First, compute at 1120 K:

-2.09 * 1120 = -2340.8

0.0015 * (1120² / 2) = 0.0015 * (1254400 / 2) = 0.0015 * 627200 = 940.8

So, total at 1120 K: -2340.8 + 940.8 = -1400

At 298 K:

-2.09 * 298 = approx -619.82

0.0015 * (298² / 2) = 0.0015 * (88804 / 2) = 0.0015 * 44402 ≈ 66.603

So, total at 298 K: -619.82 + 66.603 ≈ -553.217

Now, the integral from 298 to 1120 is [ -1400 ] - [ -553.217 ] = -1400 + 553.217 ≈ -846.783 cal/mol

So,

ΔH(1120) = (-3100) + (-846.783) ≈ -3946.783 cal/mol

Wait, that can't be right. Because when you lower the temperature, the enthalpy should decrease for solidification (since solidification is exothermic). But wait, I'm not sure if the calculation is correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, the integral ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) dT from 298 to 1120 is the integral of (-2.09 + 0.0015 T) dT.

So,

∫ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T) dT = (-2.09 T) + (0.0015 * T² / 2) evaluated from 298 to 1120.

At 1120:

-2.09 *1120 = -2340.8

0.0015*(1120)^2 /2 = 0.0015*(1254400)/2 = 0.0015*627200 = 940.8

Sum: -2340.8 + 940.8 = -1400

At 298:

-2.09 *298 = -619.82

0.0015*(298)^2 /2 = 0.0015*(88804)/2 = 0.0015*44402 ≈ 66.603

Sum: -619.82 +66.603 ≈ -553.217

The integral is (-1400) - (-553.217) = -1400 +553.217 ≈ -846.783 cal/mol

So, ΔH(1120) = (-3100) + (-846.783) ≈ -3946.783 cal/mol

Wait, but that seems very negative. Is that correct? Because the enthalpy change at a higher temperature (1120 K) would be less exothermic than at 298 K. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me think again. The enthalpy change for solidification at 1120 K is:

ΔH(1120) = H_s(1120) - H_l(1120) = ΔH° + ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) dT from 298 to 1120

But wait, when you go from 298 K to 1120 K, you're heating the solid and the liquid. So the integral is from 298 to 1120, so the upper limit is higher than the lower limit.

Wait, but the calculation seems correct. So the integral is negative, which means that the enthalpy change becomes more negative, i.e., more exothermic. That makes sense because as temperature increases, the enthalpy of the liquid increases more than the solid, making the solidification more exothermic.

But now, using this ΔH(1120) = -3946.783 cal, the entropy change would be:

ΔS = ΔH(1120) / T = (-3946.783) / 1120 ≈ -3.5238 cal/(K·mol)

But looking at the options, the closest is option F (-3.10), but that's not very close. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should not adjust the ΔH and instead use the standard ΔH° at 298 K and then compute the entropy change at 1120 K using the heat capacities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the entropy change for the solidification process at 1120 K using the formula:

ΔS = (ΔH_solidification at 1120 K) / 1120

But to find ΔH_solidification at 1120 K, I can use the Cp values.

Wait, another approach: the entropy change for solidification at temperature T is given by:

ΔS = (ΔH_fusion) / T

But since solidification is the reverse, ΔS = -ΔH_fusion / T

But ΔH_fusion is the enthalpy change for melting, which is positive. So, if ΔH° for solidification is -3100 cal, then ΔH_fusion (melting) is +3100 cal.

But wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try a different approach.

The entropy change for the solidification process at temperature T is:

ΔS = ∫ (dQ_rev) / T

Where dQ_rev is the heat released during the process. Since solidification is exothermic, dQ_rev is negative.

The heat released during solidification at 1120 K is equal to the enthalpy change at that temperature, which is ΔH_solidification at 1120 K.

So, first, I need to compute ΔH_solidification at 1120 K. How?

The standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) is at 298 K. To find ΔH at 1120 K, I can use the relationship:

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + ΔCp * (T - T°)

Where ΔCp is the difference in heat capacities between the products and reactants.

Wait, but ΔCp is not constant because Cp(s) depends on T. So this approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the enthalpy change from 298 K to 1120 K for both the liquid and the solid.

The enthalpy change for the liquid from 298 K to 1120 K is:

ΔH_l = Cp(l) * (1120 - 298) = 7.50 cal/(°C·mol) * (822 °C) = 7.50 * 822 = 6165 cal/mol

Similarly, the enthalpy change for the solid from 298 K to 1120 K is:

ΔH_s = ∫ Cp(s) dT from 298 to 1120

Cp(s) =5.41 + 1.50e-3 T

So,

ΔH_s = ∫ (5.41 + 1.50e-3 T) dT from 298 to 1120

= [5.41 T + (1.50e-3/2) T² ] evaluated from 298 to 1120

Compute each term:

At 1120 K:

5.41 * 1120 ≈ 6062.8

(1.50e-3 / 2) * (1120)^2 = (0.00075) * 1254400 ≈ 940.8

Total at 1120: 6062.8 + 940.8 ≈ 6993.6

At 298 K:

5.41 * 298 ≈ 1612.58

(0.00075) * (298)^2 = 0.00075 * 88804 ≈ 66.603

Total at 298: 1612.58 + 66.603 ≈ 1679.183

So, ΔH_s = 6993.6 - 1679.183 ≈ 5314.417 cal/mol

Now, the total enthalpy change when cooling from 298 K to 1120 K:

ΔH_l = 6165 cal (liquid gains heat)
ΔH_s = 5314.417 cal (solid gains heat)

Wait, but when you cool the liquid and solid, their enthalpies decrease, so perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the enthalpy change when heating from 298 K to 1120 K.

Wait, the process is heating from 298 K to 1120 K, so the liquid's enthalpy increases by 6165 cal, and the solid's increases by 5314.417 cal. 

Now, the standard enthalpy change of solidification is ΔH° = H(s, 298) - H(l, 298) = -3100 cal.

At 1120 K, the enthalpy change for solidification would be:

ΔH(1120) = [H(s, 1120) - H(l, 1120)] = [H(s,298) + ΔH_s] - [H(l,298) + ΔH_l]

= (H(s,298) - H(l,298)) ) + (ΔH_s - ΔH_l)
= ΔH° + (5314.417 - 6165)
= (-3100) + (-850.583) 
= -3950.583 cal/mol

So, the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K is:

ΔS = ΔH(1120) / T = (-3950.583 cal) / (1120 K) ≈ -3.527 cal/(K·mol)

Looking at the options, option F is -3.10, which is close but not exact. However, none of the options match this value. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should not adjust the enthalpy and instead use the standard ΔH° and calculate the entropy change at 1120 K using the formula ΔS = ΔH° / T.

So,

ΔS = (-3100 cal) / (1120 K) ≈ -2.768 cal/(K·mol)

Looking at the options, the closest is option E (-2.28), but that's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and should ignore the temperature dependence of Cp and use only the standard ΔH and T=1120.

Wait, but the problem provides the heat capacities as functions, so I think I need to account for them.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the entropy change for cooling the liquid from 1356 K to 1120 K and then solidify at 1120 K.

So, the total entropy change would be:

ΔS_total = ΔS1 (cooling) + ΔS2 (solidification)

Earlier, I calculated ΔS1 as Cp(l) * ln(1120/1356) = 7.50 * ln(0.826) ≈ 7.50 * (-0.190) ≈ -1.425 cal/(K·mol)

And ΔS2 = (-3100 cal) / 1120 K ≈ -2.768 cal/(K·mol)

Adding them gives ΔS_total ≈ -4.193 cal/(K·mol), which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should not include the cooling step because the problem only asks about the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K, not the cooling. So maybe I should only calculate ΔS2.

So,

ΔS = (-3100 cal) / 1120 K ≈ -2.768 cal/(K·mol)

But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the entropy change is calculated using the heat capacities at 1120 K.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the entropy change for solidification using the Cp at 1120 K.

Wait, another formula I remember is:

ΔS = - (ΔH) / T

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

ΔS = ∫ (dQ_rev / T)

For solidification, dQ_rev is the heat released, which is negative.

But if I use the Cp values at 1120 K:

Cp(l) =7.50 cal/(°C·mol)
Cp(s) =5.41 + 1.50e-3 * 1120 ≈5.41 + 1.68 =7.09 cal/(°C·mol)

Wait, that's interesting. At 1120 K, the solid's Cp is higher than the liquid's. That doesn't make sense because liquid should have higher Cp than solid. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, 1.50e-3 * 1120 = 1.50 * 0.001 * 1120 = 1.68. So, Cp(s) at 1120 K is 5.41 + 1.68 =7.09 cal/(°C·mol)

But the liquid's Cp is 7.50, which is higher than the solid's. That makes sense because liquids usually have higher heat capacities than solids.

So, the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K can be calculated as:

ΔS = (ΔH_solidification) / T = (-3100 cal) / 1120 K ≈ -2.768 cal/(K·mol)

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change using the heat capacities at 1120 K, not the standard ΔH. So, the approach would be:

The entropy change for solidification is given by:

ΔS = ∫ (dQ_rev) / T

But dQ_rev is the heat released during solidification, which can be expressed using the Cp values at 1120 K.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the entropy change as:

ΔS = [S(s) - S(l)] at 1120 K.

But since I don't have the absolute entropies, I can calculate the difference using the heat capacities and the temperature change.

Wait, perhaps using the formula:

ΔS = Cp * ln(T2 / T1)

But for each phase. Wait, no, that's for heating/cooling a substance.

Alternatively, perhaps the entropy change for solidification at T is:

ΔS = - (ΔH_solid) / T

Where ΔH_solid is the enthalpy change for solidification at T.

But I'm back to the same issue of finding ΔH_solid at T=1120 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the entropy change is calculated using the standard ΔH at 298 K, but adjusted to 1120 K using Cp.

Wait, let me try that.

The entropy change for solidification at 1120 K would be:

ΔS = (ΔH_solid) / T

But ΔH_solid is the enthalpy change at 1120 K, which I calculated earlier as approximately -3950.583 cal/mol.

So,

ΔS = (-3950.583) / 1120 ≈ -3.527 cal/(K·mol)

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change using the formula:

ΔS = (ΔH_solid) / T, where ΔH_solid is at 1120 K, but using the Cp values at 1120 K.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K using the Cp at that temperature.

The entropy change for solidification is:

ΔS = (ΔH_solid) / T

But ΔH_solid is the enthalpy change at 1120 K, which can be found by:

ΔH_solid(1120) = ΔH° + ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) dT from 298 to 1120

Wait, that's what I did earlier, resulting in ΔH ≈ -3950.583 cal/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Cp at 1120 K for both phases and calculate the entropy change as:

ΔS = (ΔH_solid) / T = [ (ΔH°) + (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) * (T - T°) ] / T

But that's an approximation assuming Cp is constant, which might not be accurate but perhaps is what the problem expects.

So,

Cp(s) at 1120 K is 7.09 cal/(°C·mol)
Cp(l) is 7.50 cal/(°C·mol)
ΔCp = 7.09 -7.50 = -0.41 cal/(°C·mol)

ΔH_solid(1120) = ΔH° + (ΔCp) * (1120 - 298) 
= (-3100) + (-0.41) * (822)
= (-3100) + (-337.02) ≈ -3437.02 cal/mol

Then,

ΔS = (-3437.02) / 1120 ≈ -3.07 cal/(K·mol)

Looking at the options, the closest is option F (-3.10). So perhaps the answer is F.

But earlier more accurate calculation gave me around -3.527, so F is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach without integrating the variable Cp.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average Cp for both liquid and solid between 298 K and 1120 K, then calculate the entropy change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entropy change for solidification using the Cp at 1120 K, ignoring the temperature dependence.

Wait, another approach: the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K is:

ΔS = [ Cp_s(T) * ln(T/T) ] - [ Cp_l(T) * ln(T/T) ] 

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the entropy change is determined by the heat released during solidification at T, which is ΔH_solidification at T, divided by T.

But I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: -2.50
B: -2.09
C: -2.23
D: -1.95
E: -2.28
F: -3.10
G: 3.00
H: 2.09
I: 0.046
J: -1.75

From my earlier calculation where I used only the standard ΔH, I got ΔS ≈ -2.768, which is not an option. But if I use the adjusted ΔH, I get around -3.527, which is close to F (-3.10).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change for cooling the liquid from 1356 K to 1120 K and then solidify at 1120 K.

So, cooling the liquid:

ΔS1 = Cp(l) * ln(T_final / T_initial) = 7.50 * ln(1120/1356) ≈ 7.50 * ln(0.826) ≈7.50*(-0.190)= -1.425

Then, solidification:

ΔS2 = (-3100 cal) / 1120 K ≈-2.768

Total ΔS = -1.425 + (-2.768) = -4.193, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only wants the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K, without considering the cooling, so using ΔH° / T, which is -3100/1120 ≈-2.768. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change using the Cp of the solid and liquid at 1120 K.

At 1120 K:

Cp(s) =5.41 + 1.50e-3 *1120 ≈5.41 +1.68=7.09 cal/(°C·mol)
Cp(l)=7.50 cal/(°C·mol)

The entropy change for solidification would be:

ΔS = [S(s) - S(l)] = [∫ (Cp(s)/T) dT from 298 to 1120] - [∫ (Cp(l)/T) dT from 298 to 1120]

Which would be:

ΔS = ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) / T dT from 298 to 1120

= ∫ [ (7.09 -7.50) ] / T dT from 298 to 1120

= ∫ (-0.41)/T dT from 298 to 1120

= -0.41 * ln(1120/298)

Compute ln(1120/298) ≈ ln(3.759) ≈1.323

So,

ΔS ≈ -0.41 * 1.323 ≈-0.542 cal/(K·mol)

But that's not matching any options either.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking to use the formula ΔS = (ΔH°) / T, without considering the temperature dependence of Cp.

So,

ΔS = (-3100 cal) / (1120 K) ≈-2.768 cal/(K·mol)

But none of the options match this. However, looking at the options, option E is -2.28, which is closer to -2.77 than others, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the entropy change for solidification is the negative of the entropy change for melting. The entropy change for melting is ΔS_fusion = ΔH_fusion / T, so for solidification, it's -ΔH_fusion / T.

Given that, and using the standard ΔH_fusion (which is +3100 cal), the entropy change would be:

ΔS_solidification = - (3100) / 1120 ≈-2.768 cal/(K·mol)

Again, same result.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change using the Cp values at 1120 K, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entropy change as the entropy of the solid minus the entropy of the liquid at 1120 K, which can be calculated using their respective Cp values.

At 1120 K:

S(s) = S(s,298) + ∫ (Cp(s)/T) dT from 298 to 1120
S(l) = S(l,298) + ∫ (Cp(l)/T) dT from 298 to 1120

So, ΔS = S(s) - S(l) = [S(s,298) - S(l,298)] + ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l))/T dT from 298 to 1120

But [S(s,298) - S(l,298)] is the entropy change at 298 K, which is ΔS° = ΔS°_solidification = ΔH°_solid / 298 = (-3100)/298 ≈-10.395 cal/(K·mol)

Then,

ΔS = (-10.395) + ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l))/T dT from 298 to 1120

We already calculated ∫ (Cp(s) - Cp(l))/T dT from 298 to 1120 ≈-0.542 cal/(K·mol)

So,

ΔS = (-10.395) + (-0.542) ≈-10.937 cal/(K·mol)

But this is way off from the options. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about the formula for entropy change during a phase transition at a specific temperature.

The entropy change for solidification at temperature T is given by:

ΔS = (ΔH_solid) / T

Where ΔH_solid is the enthalpy change for solidification at T.

To find ΔH_solid at T=1120 K, I can use the relationship:

ΔH_solid(T) = ΔH_solid° + ∫ (Cp_solid - Cp_liquid) dT from 298 to T

As I did earlier, which resulted in ΔH_solid(1120) ≈-3950.583 cal/mol

So,

ΔS = (-3950.583) / 1120 ≈-3.527 cal/(K·mol)

But this isn't an option. However, option F is -3.10, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, let me recheck the integration:

Cp(s) - Cp(l) = (5.41 +1.5e-3 T) -7.50 = -2.09 +0.0015 T

So,

∫ (-2.09 +0.0015 T) dT from 298 to 1120

= [ -2.09 T + 0.0015*(T²/2) ] from 298 to 1120

At 1120:

-2.09*1120 = -2340.8

0.0015*(1120^2)/2 = 0.00075*(1254400) = 940.8

Sum: -2340.8+940.8= -1400

At 298:

-2.09*298= -619.82

0.00075*(298^2)=0.00075*(88804)=66.603

Sum: -619.82 +66.603= -553.217

Integral = (-1400) - (-553.217)= -846.783

So,

ΔH_solid(1120) = ΔH° + (-846.783) = -3100 -846.783 ≈-3946.783 cal/mol

Thus,

ΔS = -3946.783 /1120 ≈-3.527 cal/(K·mol)

But again, this isn't an option. The closest is F: -3.10.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the temperature dependence of Cp(s) and use only the Cp values at 1120 K.

So,

Cp(s) at 1120 K =5.41 +1.5e-3*1120=5.41+1.68=7.09
Cp(l)=7.50

ΔCp =7.09 -7.50= -0.41 cal/(°C·mol)

Then,

ΔH_solid(1120)=ΔH° + (ΔCp)*(1120-298)= -3100 + (-0.41)*(822)= -3100 -337.02 ≈-3437.02 cal/mol

So,

ΔS= -3437.02/1120 ≈-3.07 cal/(K·mol)

Closest option is F: -3.10.

But perhaps the correct approach is to use Cp at 1120 K and calculate the entropy change as:

ΔS= (ΔH_solid)/(T)

But since the problem provides Cp as a function, perhaps the intended answer is F: -3.10.

But looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change for the solidification process using Cp at 1120 K, without adjusting ΔH.

Wait, another thought: the entropy change for solidification at 1120 K is:

ΔS = (ΔH_solid) / T = [ (ΔH°) + (Cp(s) - Cp(l)) * (T - T°) ] / T

But this is an approximation assuming Cp is constant except for the term (Cp(s) - Cp(l)).

So,

ΔH_solid = -3100 + (7.09 -7.50) * (1120 -298)
= -3100 + (-0.41) * 822
= -3100 -337.02 ≈-3437.02

Then,

ΔS = -3437.02 /1120 ≈-3.07 cal/(K·mol)

Which rounds to -3.07, close to option F (-3.10).

Given the options, I think the intended answer is F: -3.10.
</think>

To determine the entropy change for the solidification of copper at 1120 K, the analysis involves calculating the entropy change using the enthalpy change for solidification at that temperature. The given data includes the standard enthalpy change of solidification, ΔH° = -3100 cal, and the heat capacities of copper in liquid and solid states.

The entropy change for solidification at a temperature \( T \) is given by:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{solid}}}{T}
\]

where \( \Delta H_{\text{solid}} \) is the enthalpy change for solidification at \( T \). To calculate \( \Delta H_{\text{solid}} \) at 1120 K, the temperature dependence of the heat capacities must be considered. The heat capacity of solid copper is temperature-dependent, \( C_p(s) = 5.41 + 1.50 \times 10^{-3}T \), while the liquid's heat capacity is constant, \( C_p(l) = 7.50 \, \text{cal/(°C·mol)} \).

The enthalpy change at 1120 K is calculated by adjusting the standard enthalpy change using the difference in heat capacities between the solid and liquid phases:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{solid}}(1120) = \Delta H^\circ + \int_{298}^{1120} (C_p(s) - C_p(l)) \, dT
\]

The integral evaluates to approximately \(-846.783 \, \text{cal/mol}\), leading to:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{solid}}(1120) \approx -3100 - 846.783 = -3946.783 \, \text{cal/mol}
\]

Substituting this into the entropy change formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{-3946.783}{1120} \approx -3.527 \, \text{cal/(K·mol)}
\]

While this value is not an exact match to the provided options, the closest option is \( F: -3.10 \, \text{cal/(K·mol)} \), which aligns with the expected result when approximating the temperature dependence of heat capacities.
