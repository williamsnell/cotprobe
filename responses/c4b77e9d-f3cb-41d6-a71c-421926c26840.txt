Question:

John noticed that the angle formed by the minute hand and hour hand on a standard 12-hour clock was 110 degrees when he left home after 6 p.m.; it was also 110 degrees when he returned after 6 p.m. but before 7 p.m. that same night. If he left home for more than five minutes, for how many minutes was he away?

Options:

A: 41
B: 45
C: 35
D: 43
E: 37
F: 36
G: 42
H: 40
I: 38
J: 39

Okay, so I have this clock problem where John left home after 6 p.m., and when he left, the angle between the minute and hour hands was 110 degrees. Then, when he returned before 7 p.m., the angle was again 110 degrees. I need to find out how long he was away, and the options are various minutes from 35 to 45, etc.

Hmm, I remember that the angle between the hour and minute hands changes over time. At 6 o'clock exactly, the angle is 180 degrees because the hour hand is at 6 and the minute at 12. But as time passes, the minute hand moves faster than the hour hand. So the angle decreases until they overlap, and then starts increasing again.

Wait, but John left after 6 p.m., so the time is a bit after 6:00. The first time the angle is 110 degrees is when he leaves. Then, when he comes back before 7 p.m., the angle is 110 degrees again. So I need to find two times between 6 and 7 where the angle is 110 degrees, and the difference between those times is the time he was away.

I think the formula for the angle between the hour and minute hands is |30H - 5.5M| degrees, where H is the hour and M is the minutes past the hour. So at 6 p.m., H=6, and M is the number of minutes past 6.

So the angle is |30*6 - 5.5*M| = |180 - 5.5M|. We want this to be 110 degrees. So:

|180 - 5.5M| = 110

This gives two equations:

1) 180 - 5.5M = 110
2) 180 - 5.5M = -110

Let me solve each.

First equation:
180 - 5.5M = 110
Subtract 110: 70 = 5.5M
M = 70 / 5.5 = 12.7272... minutes. So approximately 12 minutes and 44 seconds. So that's 6:12:44.

Second equation:
180 -5.5M = -110
Add 110 to both sides: 290 = 5.5M
M = 290 / 5.5 = 52.7272... minutes. So about 52 minutes and 44 seconds. So that's 6:52:44.

So the two times when the angle is 110 degrees are at approximately 6:12:44 and 6:52:44.

The difference between these two times is 52.7272... - 12.7272... = 40 minutes. So John was away for 40 minutes.

Wait, but the options don't have 40 as the first choice. Let me check the options again. The options are A:41, B:45, C:35, D:43, E:37, F:36, G:42, H:40, I:38, J:39.

So H is 40. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but the question says he left after 6 p.m. and returned before 7 p.m. So the time he left is after 6:00, and the time he returned is before 7:00. So the two times when the angle is 110 degrees are at ~6:12:44 and ~6:52:44. The time away is 52.7272 -12.7272 = 40 minutes. So yes, 40 minutes. So the answer is H:40.
