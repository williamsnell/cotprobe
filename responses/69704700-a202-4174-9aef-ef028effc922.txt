Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says: An automobile is traveling at 30 mi/hr and accelerates uniformly to 60 mi/hr in 10 seconds. We need to find out how far it travels during that acceleration period. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, alright, let's break this down. First, I remember that when dealing with acceleration, especially uniform acceleration, the key formulas are from kinematics. The basic ones are:

1. v = u + at
2. s = ut + (1/2)at²
3. v² = u² + 2as

Where:
- v is the final velocity,
- u is the initial velocity,
- a is acceleration,
- t is time,
- s is the distance traveled.

So, I think I need to find the distance 's' here. To use the second formula, I need to know the acceleration 'a' first. Alternatively, maybe I can find 'a' using the first formula and then plug it into the second.

Wait, but the velocities are given in miles per hour (mi/hr), and the time is in seconds. That's a bit tricky because the units don't match. I should probably convert the velocities to feet per second (ft/s) since the options are in feet, and the time is in seconds. That way, everything is consistent.

Let me recall how to convert miles per hour to feet per second. I know that 1 mile is 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, the conversion factor is 5280 ft / 3600 s, which simplifies to approximately 1.4667 ft/s per mi/hr.

So, let's convert the initial and final velocities.

Initial velocity, u = 30 mi/hr. Converting that:
u = 30 * (5280/3600) = 30 * (22/15) because 5280/3600 = 22/15 ≈ 1.4667.
Let me calculate that: 30 * 22 = 660, divided by 15 is 44 ft/s. So u = 44 ft/s.

Final velocity, v = 60 mi/hr. Converting that:
v = 60 * (22/15) = (60/15)*22 = 4*22 = 88 ft/s. So v = 88 ft/s.

Wait, that seems high, but I think that's correct because 60 mph is about 88 ft/s. I've heard that before, so that makes sense.

Now, using the first formula, v = u + at. We can solve for acceleration 'a'.

Plugging in the values:
88 = 44 + a * 10
Subtract 44 from both sides: 44 = 10a
So a = 44 / 10 = 4.4 ft/s².

Wait, that seems a bit high for acceleration, but maybe it's correct because the speed is changing from 44 to 88 ft/s in 10 seconds, which is a 44 ft/s increase over 10 seconds, so 4.4 ft/s². Yeah, that checks out.

Now, with 'a' known, I can use the second formula to find the distance 's'.

s = ut + (1/2)at²

Plugging in the numbers:
u = 44 ft/s,
t = 10 s,
a = 4.4 ft/s².

So s = (44)(10) + 0.5*(4.4)*(10)^2
= 440 + 0.5*4.4*100
= 440 + (2.2)*100
= 440 + 220
= 660 ft.

Wait, so s is 660 feet. Looking at the options, option E is 660 ft. So the answer should be E.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Converting 30 mi/hr to ft/s: 30 * 5280 / 3600. Let me compute that.

30 * 5280 = 158,400. Divided by 3600: 158400 / 3600. Well, 3600 * 44 = 158,400, so yes, 44 ft/s. Correct.

60 mi/hr: 60 * 5280 = 316,800. Divided by 3600: 316800 / 3600. 3600 * 88 = 316,800. So 88 ft/s. Correct.

Then, acceleration a = (88 - 44)/10 = 44/10 = 4.4 ft/s². Correct.

Now, s = ut + 0.5 a t².

ut = 44 * 10 = 440.

a t² = 4.4 * 100 = 440. Half of that is 220.

Adding them: 440 + 220 = 660 ft. So yes, option E.

Wait, but looking back at the options, E is 660 ft. So that's the answer.

The automobile accelerates uniformly, and we need to find the distance traveled during acceleration. Converting velocities from mi/hr to ft/s and using kinematic equations, we calculate the distance as 660 feet.
