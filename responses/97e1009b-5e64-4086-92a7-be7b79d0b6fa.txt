Okay, so I've got this question about an RC low-pass filter and finding the output noise power when the input is white noise. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the transfer function of an RC low-pass filter is given by H(f) = 1 / (1 + jf/f_c), where f_c is the cutoff frequency. White noise has a flat power spectral density across all frequencies, right? So the input noise power is typically represented as N0 at the source, but I think when it's passed through a filter, the output noise depends on the filter's frequency response.

Wait, white noise has a spectral density of N0/2 in each of the two-sided spectrum. Or is it N0 in total? I'm a bit confused there. Oh right, the power spectral density (PSD) of white noise is usually given as N0/2 per Hz, so the total noise power over all frequencies would be the integral of PSD over all frequencies. But since it's white, the integral would just be N0 times the bandwidth. But in this case, the filter is shaping the noise, so I need to account for the filter's response.

So the output noise power would be the integral of the squared magnitude of the transfer function multiplied by the input noise spectral density over all frequencies. Mathematically, that should be N0_out = N0_in * ∫ |H(f)|² df from 0 to infinity. Since the input is white noise, N0_in is just the noise power spectral density, which I think is taken as 1 in some cases, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, in this problem, I think the input noise has a power spectral density of η (eta), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, sometimes it's given as N0/2, so perhaps η is N0/2?

Wait, the question says to find the output noise power N0 of the filter. So maybe the input is white noise with a certain spectral density, and the output is the integral of H(f) squared times that spectral density across all frequencies.

Let me structure this:

The output noise spectral density S_y(f) = |H(f)|² * S_x(f), where S_x(f) is the input noise spectral density. Since the input is white noise, S_x(f) is a constant, say η (eta), across all frequencies.

Therefore, the output noise power would be the integral of S_y(f) over all frequencies, from 0 to infinity.

So N0 = ∫ (from 0 to ∞) |H(f)|² * η df.

Now, H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/f_c), so |H(f)|² is 1 / (1 + (f/f_c)^2). Because the magnitude squared of 1 + jf/f_c is (1)^2 + (f/f_c)^2.

So N0 = η * ∫ (from 0 to ∞) [1 / (1 + (f/f_c)^2)] df.

To compute this integral, let's make a substitution. Let x = f/f_c, so f = x f_c, and df = f_c dx.

So the integral becomes ∫ (0 to ∞) [1/(1 + x²)] * f_c dx.

The integral of 1/(1 + x²) dx from 0 to ∞ is π/2. So substituting back, the integral becomes f_c * (π/2).

Therefore, N0 = η * (f_c * π/2) = (η f_c π)/2.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is (η f_c π)/2, which matches this result.

But wait, I should double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with two-sided spectra, there's a factor to consider. Oh wait, no, in this case, since we're integrating from 0 to ∞, we're considering one side, so the integral correctly gives the total noise power without needing to multiply by 2.

So yes, the answer should be option E.
</think>

The output noise power of an RC low-pass filter when the input is white noise is calculated by integrating the squared magnitude of the transfer function multiplied by the input noise spectral density over all frequencies. The transfer function is \( H(f) = \frac{1}{1 + j\frac{f}{f_c}} \), so \( |H(f)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + (\frac{f}{f_c})^2} \). The integral \( \int_0^\infty \frac{df}{1 + (\frac{f}{f_c})^2} \) evaluates to \( \frac{\pi f_c}{2} \). Multiplying by the input noise spectral density \( \eta \), the output noise power is \( \frac{\eta f_c \pi}{2} \), which corresponds to option E.
