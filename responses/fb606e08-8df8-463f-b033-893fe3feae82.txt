Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure out which option will not terminate a contract by operation of law. Let's break this down step by step.

The question is asking which of the given options does NOT terminate a contract by operation of law. The options are A through H, and I need to pick the correct answer. 

First, I should recall what "termination by operation of law" means. It refers to situations where the law automatically ends the contract without the need for either party to take action. These situations include things like impossibility, frustration, illegality, or certain events like death or the subject matter being destroyed.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Change in law that makes contract impossible. I remember that if a law changes and makes fulfilling the contract impossible, the contract is discharged by impossibility. So this would terminate the contract. So A is not the correct answer because the question is asking which will NOT terminate.

Option B: Bankruptcy of one party. Hmm, bankruptcy usually affects the ability to pay, but does it terminate the contract? I think that if a party goes bankrupt, the contract doesn't necessarily terminate. Instead, the bankrupt party might not be able to perform, and the other party might have to seek remedies like specific performance or damages, but the contract itself isn't automatically terminated. So B might be the correct answer because it doesn't terminate by operation of law.

Option C: Expiration of the contract term. If the contract has a specific term and that term ends, the contract naturally terminates. So C would terminate by operation of law, so it's not the answer.

Option D: Partial performance. Partial performance usually doesn't terminate the contract. It might mean that the other party can sue for the remaining part or claim damages if the partial performance is considered as an anticipatory breach, but the contract isn't terminated by operation of law. So D could be a candidate for the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about D. Sometimes, partial performance can lead to the contract being considered as breached if the partial performance is not substantial or if it's done in a way that shows the party won't fulfill the rest. But by operation of law, does partial performance alone end the contract? I think not. The contract would still be alive unless there's a breach.

Option E: Supervening illegality. If the contract becomes illegal after it's formed, that would make it impossible to perform, so the contract is discharged by supervening illegality. So E would terminate the contract by operation of law, so it's not the answer.

Option F: Death or insanity of a party. Contracts are generally binding on the estate of a deceased party unless the contract is personal in nature, like a service contract where personal skills are involved. So if a party dies, the contract may be terminated by operation of law. So F would terminate, so it's not the answer.

Option G: Fulfillment of contract. Once both parties have fulfilled their obligations, the contract naturally ends. So G would terminate by operation of law, so it's not the answer.

Option H: Destruction of the subject matter. If the subject matter is destroyed, and it's a condition for the contract, then the contract is discharged by impossibility. For example, if you rent a house and it burns down, the lease is terminated. So H would terminate, so it's not the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about option D. Partial performance doesn't usually terminate the contract. It might be a breach if the performance is partial and the other party can't accept it, but termination by operation of law... I think partial performance doesn't automatically terminate the contract. It's more about whether the partial performance constitutes a breach that the other party can terminate, but that's not by operation of law. So D might be the correct answer because it doesn't terminate the contract by operation of law.

Wait, but I thought the question was about what will NOT terminate. So if D is partial performance, the contract isn't terminated by operation of law. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought B (bankruptcy) doesn't terminate the contract by operation of law. Let me clarify that. Bankruptcy typically doesn't terminate the contract on its own. Instead, it's about whether the bankrupt party can continue or if the other party can terminate. But in some cases, like if the contract is for personal services and the party is bankrupt, maybe the contract is terminated. But generally, bankruptcy doesn't automatically terminate the contract; it's more about the ability to perform.

So, if I'm to choose which doesn't terminate by operation of law, both B and D could be candidates. But the question is about which will NOT terminate. So looking back, the options are:

A: Change in law making impossible – terminates.

B: Bankruptcy – doesn't terminate by operation of law.

C: Expiration – terminates.

D: Partial performance – doesn't terminate by operation of law.

E: Illegality – terminates.

F: Death – terminates.

G: Fulfillment – terminates.

H: Destruction – terminates.

So the options that do not terminate by operation of law are B and D. But the question is asking which will NOT terminate. So both B and D are correct in that sense. But looking back at the options, the question is which of the following will NOT terminate, so the answer should be either B or D.

Wait, but I need to check the options again. The options are A to H, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Partial performance doesn't discharge the contract; it's about whether the performance was substantial. So the contract remains unless there's a breach. So D: Partial performance does not terminate the contract by operation of law. So D is the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the contract is fully performed, it's terminated. So G is termination by performance. H is destruction, which terminates. E is illegality, which terminates. A is impossibility, which terminates. F is death, which may terminate depending on the contract. C is expiration, which terminates.

So the ones that don't terminate are B (bankruptcy) and D (partial performance). Wait, but the question is which will NOT terminate, so both B and D are possible answers. But looking at the options, the question is asking which will not terminate, so the answer would be either B or D.

Wait, but the options only have one correct answer. Let me think again.

In contract law, when a party goes bankrupt, the contract isn't automatically terminated. The non-bankrupt party can choose to continue the contract or treat it as breached. So the contract isn't terminated by operation of law in the case of bankruptcy. Similarly, partial performance doesn't terminate the contract by operation of law.

So the options that do not terminate by operation of law are B and D. But the question is about the option that will not terminate. So the answer could be either B or D.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the model answer. I think the correct answer is D: Partial performance. Because partial performance doesn't terminate the contract by operation of law. The contract remains unless there's a breach or repudiation.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because sometimes partial performance can lead to the contract being considered breached if it's a repudiation, but that's more of a breach than operation of law.

Wait, but the question is about termination by operation of law. So the answer is either B or D.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D: Partial performance. Because the contract isn't terminated by operation of law when there's partial performance. The other party can sue for the remainder or claim damages, but the contract isn't automatically terminated.

Alternatively, another approach: Operation of law termination occurs without any action by the parties. So expiration (C), fulfillment (G), destruction (H), change in law (A), supervening illegality (E), death (F) all terminate by operation of law. Bankruptcy (B) and partial performance (D) do not terminate by operation of law. So the question is asking which will NOT terminate, so both B and D are correct, but the options are single answers.

Wait, but the options only have one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Change in law – terminates.

B: Bankruptcy – doesn't terminate.

C: Expiration – terminates.

D: Partial performance – doesn't terminate.

E: Illegality – terminates.

F: Death – terminates.

G: Fulfillment – terminates.

H: Destruction – terminates.

So the options that do not terminate are B and D. But the question is which will NOT terminate, so the answer is either B or D. Since the options are A to H, and the question is asking which will NOT terminate, the correct answer is either B or D.

Wait, but in the options, the answer is one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is D: Partial performance.

Alternatively, I think the answer is D: Partial performance. Because partial performance does not terminate the contract by operation of law. It's more about whether the partial performance is a breach or not, but the contract isn't automatically terminated.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The question asks which option will not terminate a contract by operation of law. To determine this, each option is analyzed based on whether the law automatically ends the contract without party action.

- **A: Change in law that makes contract impossible**  
  A change in law that renders performance impossible terminates the contract by operation of law.  

- **B: Bankruptcy of one party**  
  Bankruptcy does not automatically terminate the contract. The non-bankrupt party may choose to continue or treat it as breached, but termination is not automatic.  

- **C: Expiration of the contract term**  
  The expiration of the contract term naturally terminates the contract by operation of law.  

- **D: Partial performance**  
  Partial performance does not terminate the contract by operation of law. The contract remains unless there is a breach or repudiation.  

- **E: Supervening illegality**  
  If the contract becomes illegal, it is discharged by supervening illegality, terminating the contract by operation of law.  

- **F: Death or insanity of a party**  
  Death or insanity may terminate the contract by operation of law, especially if the contract is personal or the subject matter is destroyed.  

- **G: Fulfillment of contract**  
  Fulfillment of the contract naturally terminates it by operation of law.  

- **H: Destruction of the subject matter of contract**  
  Destruction of the subject matter terminates the contract by operation of law due to impossibility.  

Among the options, **B (Bankruptcy)** and **D (Partial performance)** do not terminate the contract by operation of law. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **D: Partial performance** is the most accurate choice because partial performance does not automatically terminate the contract by operation of law.  

Answer: D
