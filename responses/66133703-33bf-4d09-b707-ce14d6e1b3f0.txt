Question:

We are training fully connected network with two hidden layers to predict housing prices. Inputs are $100$-dimensional, and have several features such as the number of square feet, the median family income, etc. The first hidden layer has $1000$ activations. The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?

Options:

A: 120010
B: 111110
C: 100121
D: 112110
E: 110010
F: 110020
G: 122121
H: 110011
I: 111021
J: 130021

Okay, so I've got this question about neural networks and the number of parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We're training a fully connected network with two hidden layers to predict housing prices. The inputs are 100-dimensional, so that's our input layer. The first hidden layer has 1000 activations, the second has 10 activations, and the output is a single scalar for the house price. They mentioned it's a vanilla network with affine transformations, no batch normalization, and no learnable parameters in the activation functions. So, I guess that means we only count the weights and biases.

Wait, so the network structure is Input (100) → Hidden1 (1000) → Hidden2 (10) → Output (1). Each layer is fully connected, so each neuron in one layer connects to every neuron in the next layer.

I remember that in a neural network, each layer's parameters are calculated by the number of weights plus the number of biases. The weights are the product of the number of neurons in the current layer and the previous layer. The biases are just one per neuron in the current layer.

Let me break it down layer by layer.

First, the input layer is 100 features. The first hidden layer has 1000 neurons. So, the number of weights between input and hidden1 is 100 * 1000. That's 100,000. Then, each of the 1000 neurons has a bias, so that's 1000 biases. So total parameters for hidden1 is 100,000 + 1000 = 101,000.

Next, the second hidden layer has 10 neurons. So, from hidden1 (1000) to hidden2 (10), the number of weights is 1000 * 10 = 10,000. Plus 10 biases for hidden2. So that's 10,000 + 10 = 10,010 parameters.

Finally, the output layer is a single neuron. So from hidden2 (10) to output (1), the weights are 10 * 1 =10. Plus one bias. So that's 10 +1=11 parameters.

Now, adding them all up. Let me sum the three parts:

101,000 (input to hidden1) + 10,010 (hidden1 to hidden2) + 11 (hidden2 to output) = 101,000 + 10,010 is 111,010, plus 11 is 111,021.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A to J. Let me see the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: 120010
B: 111110
C: 100121
D: 112110
E: 110010
F: 110020
G: 122121
H: 110011
I: 111021
J: 130021

Hmm, I calculated 111,021, which would be option I. But wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes I might add wrong.

Wait, 100 *1000 = 100,000. Plus 1000 (biases) = 101,000. Then 1000*10=10,000. Plus 10 =10,010. Then 10*1=10. Plus 1=11.

So 101,000 +10,010 is 111,010. Then adding 11 gives 111,021. So yes, that's 111,021. So the correct option is I: 111021.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Because sometimes people might forget to include the biases. Wait, the question says "vanilla network with affine transformations", which I think includes adding a bias term, so each layer's neurons have a bias.

Another way: for each layer, the number of parameters is (input neurons * output neurons) + output neurons.

So:

Layer 1 (input to hidden1): (100 *1000) + 1000 =100,000 +1000=101,000.

Layer 2 (hidden1 to hidden2): (1000 *10) +10=10,000 +10=10,010.

Layer3 (hidden2 to output): (10 * 1) +1=10+1=11.

Total: 101,000 +10,010=111,010 +11=111,021. Yep, same as before.

Looking at the options, option I is 111021, so that's the correct answer.

The network has three layers: input, two hidden layers, and output. The parameters are calculated as the sum of weights and biases for each layer.

1. **Input to Hidden1**: 100 inputs → 1000 neurons  
   Weights: 100 × 1000 = 100,000  
   Biases: 1000  
   Total: 101,000  

2. **Hidden1 to Hidden2**: 1000 neurons → 10 neurons  
   Weights: 1000 × 10 = 10,000  
   Biases: 10  
   Total: 10,010  

3. **Hidden2 to Output**: 10 neurons → 1 neuron  
   Weights: 10 × 1 = 10  
   Biases: 1  
   Total: 11  

Adding them up: 101,000 + 10,010 + 11 = **111,021**.  

The correct answer is **I: 111021**.
