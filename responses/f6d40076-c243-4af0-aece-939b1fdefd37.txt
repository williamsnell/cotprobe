Question:

Suppose that a two-stage rocket starts from rest with a mass m_1. At burn-out of the first stage engine, the mass is m_2. If the exhaust velocity is v_0, the rocket velocity after the first stage engines quit is v = v_0ln(m_1 / m_2). Before the second stage engines are ignited, part of the mass m_2 is discarded - the mass of the first stage engines. The mass of the second stage ism_Awhen the en-gines start andm_Bwhen the engines shut down. What is the terminal velocity of the second stage?

Options:

A: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 - m_2) / (m_A * m_B)]
B: v = v_0 In [(m_1 * m_2)(m_A*m_B)]
C: v = v_0 ln [(m_1^2 / m_2) * (m_A / m_B)]
D: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 * m_2) / (m_A + m_B)]
E: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 / m_2) + (m_A/m_B)]
F: v = v_0 In [(m_1 / m_2)(m_A+m_B)]
G: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 + m_2) * (m_A - m_B)]
H: v = v_0 ln [m_1 / (m_2 + m_A + m_B)]
I: v = v_0 In [(m_1 / m_2)(m_A/m_B)]
J: v = v_0 ln [(m_1 + m_2) / (m_A * m_B)]

Okay, so I've got this rocket problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on rocket equations, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the problem describes a two-stage rocket. It starts from rest with mass m₁. The first stage engine burns out, and at that point, the mass becomes m₂. The exhaust velocity is v₀, and the rocket's velocity after the first stage is given by v = v₀ ln(m₁/m₂). That's the classic rocket equation, right? So I remember that the velocity gained is proportional to the natural log of the initial mass over the final mass for that stage.

Now, after the first stage engines quit, part of the mass m₂ is discarded. Specifically, the mass of the first stage engines is discarded. So the mass after discarding would be m₂ minus the mass of the first stage engines. Wait, but the problem doesn't give that mass explicitly. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read again.

Oh! After the first stage engines quit, part of m₂ is discarded—the mass of the first stage engines. So the remaining mass before the second stage ignites is the second stage's mass. Wait, no. Because m₂ is the mass at burnout of the first stage. So m₂ includes the second stage's engines and fuel, right? Or wait, no, maybe m₂ is the total mass after the first stage burns out, including the second stage's engines and fuel. But then, when the first stage engines are discarded, the remaining mass would be m₂ minus the mass of the first stage engines. But I'm not exactly sure how this plays into the second stage.

Wait, perhaps after the first stage engines burn out, the rocket has mass m₂, which includes the second stage's mass plus the first stage's engines. So when the first stage engines are discarded, the remaining mass for the second stage is m₂ minus the first stage engines' mass. But the problem says that when the second stage engines start, the mass is m_A, and when they shut down, it's m_B. So m_A is the initial mass of the second stage (including fuel), and m_B is the final mass after burning that fuel.

So the first stage gives velocity v = v₀ ln(m₁/m₂). Then, the second stage starts with mass m_A and burns down to m_B. The velocity from the second stage would be v₂ = v₀ ln(m_A/m_B). But wait, velocities add up if they're in the same direction. So the total velocity would be the sum of the first stage's velocity and the second stage's contribution.

Wait, no, wait. Because the first stage's velocity is after it's done, and then the second stage adds on top of that. So the total velocity would be v_total = v₀ ln(m₁/m₂) + v₀ ln(m_A/m_B).

But wait, that can't be it because the options don't have a sum like that. Alternatively, maybe the velocities are multiplied in the logarithm. Because when you have two stages, the total velocity is the sum of each stage's contribution. So the first stage gives v₁ = v₀ ln(m₁/m₂), and the second stage gives v₂ = v₀ ln(m_A/m_B). So total velocity is v = v₁ + v₂ = v₀ [ln(m₁/m₂) + ln(m_A/m_B)] = v₀ ln[(m₁/m₂)(m_A/m_B)].

Wait, that's the same as multiplying the ratios. Because ln(a) + ln(b) = ln(ab). So the total velocity would be v₀ ln[(m₁ m_A)/(m₂ m_B)]. Because (m₁/m₂) * (m_A/m_B) = (m₁ m_A)/(m₂ m_B).

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option I is v = v₀ ln [(m₁/m₂)(m_A/m_B)], which is exactly what I have. Alternatively, let me check the other options.

Option I: (m₁/m₂)(m_A/m_B) inside the ln. That's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The first stage gives v₁ = v₀ ln(m₁ / m₂). The second stage starts with m_A and ends at m_B, so its contribution is v₂ = v₀ ln(m_A/m_B). So the total velocity is the sum: v = v₁ + v₂.

So v = v₀ [ln(m₁/m₂) + ln(m_A/m_B)] = v₀ ln[(m₁/m₂) * (m_A/m_B)].

Which is exactly option I.

Wait, but let me check other options to make sure. Option I is there. So the correct answer should be option I.

The two-stage rocket's terminal velocity is the sum of the velocities from each stage. The first stage contributes \( v_0 \ln(m_1/m_2) \), and the second stage contributes \( v_0 \ln(m_A/m_B) \). Adding these gives the total velocity as \( v_0 \ln[(m_1/m_2)(m_A/m_B)] \), corresponding to option I.
