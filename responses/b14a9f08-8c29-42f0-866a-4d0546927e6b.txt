Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, Jerry read a 200-page book in 10 hours. I need to find out how long it will take him to read a 320-page book at the same rate. Hmm, I think I should start by figuring out how long he takes per page or how many pages he reads per hour.

First, perhaps I can calculate his reading speed. If he read 200 pages in 10 hours, then his rate is pages per hour. So I'll divide the number of pages by the time. That would be 200 pages divided by 10 hours, which equals 20 pages per hour. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 200 divided by 10 is 20 pages per hour. Yeah, that makes sense because if he reads 20 pages each hour, in 10 hours he'd read 200 pages.

Now, the next part is to find out how long it takes him to read 320 pages at that rate. Since he reads 20 pages each hour, I can divide the total number of pages by his reading rate per hour. So, 320 pages divided by 20 pages per hour. Let me do that calculation: 320 รท 20 equals 16. So, he would take 16 hours to read a 320-page book.

Looking at the options, D is 16 hours. So the answer should be D.

The answer is D: 16 hours.
