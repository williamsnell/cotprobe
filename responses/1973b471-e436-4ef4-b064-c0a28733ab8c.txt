Okay, so here's the problem. Ike Waterman and Sean Cole invested money in a fast food store. Ike put in $20,000 and Sean put in $10,000. Each partner gets 6% of their own investment as profit. The remaining profit is split equally. The total profit last year was $10,400. I need to figure out how much each partner gets.

First, I think I should calculate how much each of them gets from their 6% profit. Let me start with Ike Waterman. He invested $20,000, so 6% of that is 0.06 * 20,000. Let me do that math: 0.06 times 20,000 is $1,200. So Ike gets $1,200 just from his investment.

Now Sean Cole invested $10,000. 6% of that is 0.06 * 10,000, which is $600. So Sean gets $600 from his investment.

So together, they've already taken out $1,200 + $600 = $1,800 from the profit. The total profit was $10,400. So the remaining profit after taking their 6% each is $10,400 - $1,800. Let me calculate that: 10,400 minus 1,800 is $8,600.

Now, this remaining $8,600 is to be split equally between the two partners. So each gets half of that. Half of 8,600 is 8,600 / 2 = $4,300. So each of them gets an additional $4,300 from the remaining profit.

Now I can add up each partner's total share. Ike gets $1,200 plus $4,300, which totals $5,500. Sean gets $600 plus $4,300, totaling $4,900.

Wait a second, looking at the options, let's see which one matches. Option E says Waterman got $5,500 and Cole got $4,900. That matches what I just calculated. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Ike's 6%: 20,000 * 0.06 = 1,200. Sean's 6%: 10,000 * 0.06 = 600. Total taken: 1,800. Profit left: 10,400 - 1,800 = 8,600. Split equally is 4,300 each. So Ike's total is 1,200 + 4,300 = 5,500. Sean's is 600 + 4,300 = 4,900. Yep, that's correct.

The correct answer is E: Waterman's share was $5,500 and Cole's share was $4,900.
