Okay, so I've got this logic question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking about a requirement that each term must be used exactly twice. The options are various types of syllogisms and logical arguments.

First, I need to remember what each of these terms means. Let me start by recalling what each type of syllogism or argument is.

Modus ponens and modus tollens are types of conditional syllogisms. Modus ponens is about affirming the antecedent, and modus tollens is about denying the consequent. Both of these typically have two premises and a conclusion, using the same terms in a specific way.

A dilemma is a type of argument that presents two options, both leading to the same conclusion. It's often used in problems where you're forced to choose between two bad options. I think a dilemma usually involves four terms, but I'm not entirely sure.

Disjunctive syllogism deals with 'either/or' statements. It has a premise that disjuncts and a conclusion that affirms one, thereby denying the other. The structure is usually like "Either A or B, not A, so B."

Conditional syllogism, as I mentioned earlier, deals with conditional statements, like if-then. So modus ponens and tollens fall under this.

Materially true hypothetical syllogismâ€”I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think it refers to syllogisms where the premises and conclusion are true in the real world, but maybe not necessarily structurally valid.

Deductive argument requires that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. It's about the form being valid.

A true disjunctive proposition is just a statement that uses 'or' correctly, but I'm not sure how that relates to the question about term usage.

Logical fallacy is when the argument is invalid, so that's the opposite of what we're looking for here.

Categorical syllogism uses categorical propositions (like all, no, some) and has four terms, with each term appearing exactly twice. Wait, that might be it. Because in a categorical syllogism, there are four terms in total, and each term must appear exactly twice across the premises and conclusion. So each of the four terms is used twice.

Let me think again. The requirement is that each term must be used twice, no more, no less. So in a categorical syllogism, there are four terms, each appearing twice. For example, in a standard syllogism like:

All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Wait, that's only three terms. Oh, right, because in a categorical syllogism, there are three terms: major, minor, and middle. Wait, no, that's only three terms. So maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, perhaps I was thinking of a different type. Let me think about the structure. A categorical syllogism has two premises and a conclusion, with each term used exactly twice. So the major term appears twice, the minor term appears twice, and the middle term appears twice as well. Wait, no, the middle term is only in the premises. Let me get this right.

In a categorical syllogism, there are three terms: the major term (predicate of conclusion), minor term (subject of conclusion), and the middle term (which appears in both premises but not the conclusion). So the middle term is used twice, but the major and minor terms are each used once in the premises and once in the conclusion. So each term is used twice. That makes sense.

So the requirement that each term must be used twice applies to a valid categorical syllogism. Let me check the options.

Option J is "valid categorical syllogism." So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing it with other syllogisms. For example, in a disjunctive syllogism, you have two premises and a conclusion, but the terms used might not necessarily be each used twice. Or in a hypothetical syllogism, like modus ponens, you have two terms in the antecedent and one in the consequent, so each term isn't used twice.

Yes, I think J is the correct answer here.

The requirement that each term must be used exactly twice applies to a valid categorical syllogism. In such a syllogism, there are three terms: the major term, the minor term, and the middle term. Each of these terms appears twice across the two premises and the conclusion. This ensures the syllogism's structure is valid and meets the necessary conditions for a categorical syllogism.

Answer: J
