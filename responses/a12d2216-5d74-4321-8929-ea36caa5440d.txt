Question:

Strom acquired a 25% interest in Ace Partnership by contributing land having an adjusted basis of $16,000 and a fair market value of $50,000. The land was subject to a $24,000 mortgage, which was assumed by Ace. No other liabilities existed at the time of the contribution. What was Strom's basis in Ace?

Options:

A: $24,000
B: $40,000
C: $32,000
D: $50,000
E: $42,000
F: $26,000
G: $0
H: $36,000
I: $16,000
J: $22,000

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about Strom's basis in Ace Partnership after he contributes land. Hmm, I remember that when a partner contributes property to a partnership, their basis is generally based on the adjusted basis of the property they contributed. But wait, I should think through the details.

Strom contributed land with an adjusted basis of $16,000. The fair market value is higher, $50,000, but I don't think fair market value affects the basis in this case. It's the adjusted basis that counts for determining the basis in the partnership.

Now, the land was subject to a $24,000 mortgage, and Ace assumed it. So, does that affect Strom's basis? I think when the partnership takes on the liability, it's considered a recourse liability. So, the basis would be adjusted for that. But wait, how?

I recall that if a partner contributes property subject to a liability, like a mortgage, and the partnership assumes it, then the partner's basis in the partnership is the adjusted basis of the property minus any liabilities. Or is it the adjusted basis plus any liabilities they're assuming? No, wait. The partner's basis in the partnership is generally the adjusted basis of the property contributed, but if the property is subject to a liability, the basis is the adjusted basis of the property minus the amount of the liability, right? Because the partner isn't personally liable anymore; the partnership is now on the hook for it.

So, Strom's basis would be his adjusted basis of $16,000 minus the $24,000 mortgage. Wait, but that would give a negative number. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is to take the adjusted basis of the property, which is $16,000, and then subtract the amount of the liability. So, $16,000 minus $24,000 equals -$8,000. But you can't have a negative basis. So, perhaps the basis is zero in that case. But that doesn't seem right either because he contributed the land, so he should have some basis.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again. When a partner contributes property to a partnership, their basis in the partnership is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed. However, if the property is subject to a liability that the partnership assumes, the basis is the adjusted basis of the property, but the liability affects the partnership's basis, not the individual's.

Wait, no. The partner's basis in the partnership is based on their contribution. So, if they contribute land with an adjusted basis of $16k, that's their basis, regardless of the mortgage. But wait, the mortgage is a liability of the partnership now, not the partner. So, the partner's basis isn't reduced because of the liability; it's the partnership's basis that might be affected.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's look at the relevant rules. Under IRC Section 722, when a partner contributes property to a partnership, the partner's basis in the partnership is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed. However, if the property is subject to a liability, and the partnership assumes it, the basis is adjusted by subtracting the amount of the liability.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. I think the basis is the adjusted basis of the property contributed, and the liabilities are considered when determining the partnership's basis, not the individual partner's basis. So Strom's basis would just be $16,000, the adjusted basis of the land he contributed, regardless of the mortgage. Because the mortgage is now a liability of the partnership, but it doesn't reduce the partner's basis.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that when a partner contributes property subject to a liability, and the partnership assumes it, the partner's basis is the adjusted basis of the property, but the amount of the liability is treated as a reduction in the basis. So, the basis would be $16,000 minus $24,000, which would be negative, but you can't have negative basis, so it would be zero. But that doesn't seem right because the partner contributed something, so they should have some basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the basis is the adjusted basis of the property contributed, which is $16,000, and the mortgage is a liability that affects the partnership's basis, not the individual's. So Strom's basis remains at $16,000. But wait, looking at the options, I see $16,000 as option I. But I thought maybe the answer was different because of the mortgage.

Wait, another thought: when a partner contributes property, their basis is the adjusted basis of the property, and any liabilities taken on by the partnership are considered as if the partner had received cash equal to the amount of the liability. So, the basis is adjusted by subtracting the liability amount. So, $16,000 (adjusted basis) minus $24,000 (liability) equals -$8,000, which is treated as a return of capital or something, but you can't have negative basis, so it's zero. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, that's when the partner is transferring property subject to a liability and the partnership doesn't assume it. If the partnership assumes the liability, then the basis is the adjusted basis of the property. So, in this case, the basis is $16,000.

Wait, let me check an example. Suppose a partner contributes land with a basis of $100,000 and a mortgage of $50,000, which the partnership assumes. Then, the partner's basis is $100,000, and the partnership has a basis in the land of $100,000 but also has a liability of $50,000. So, the partner's basis is $100,000, not reduced by the mortgage.

Therefore, in this case, Strom's basis should be $16,000. But looking at the options, option I is $16,000. However, another angle: because the land is subject to a mortgage, and the partnership assumed it, perhaps the basis is the adjusted basis minus the mortgage, but not less than zero. So, $16,000 minus $24,000 is -$8,000, so the basis is zero. But that would mean option G: $0. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again. The basis of the partner in the partnership is the adjusted basis of the property contributed, regardless of any liabilities. Because the liabilities are now the responsibility of the partnership, not the individual partner. So, the basis remains $16,000. Therefore, the correct answer is I: $16,000.

But wait, the options include I as $16,000. So, that's the answer. But I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the mortgage affects it, but perhaps it doesn't.

Strom's basis in Ace Partnership is determined by the adjusted basis of the land he contributed, which is $16,000. The mortgage of $24,000, assumed by Ace, is a liability of the partnership and does not reduce Strom's basis. Therefore, Strom's basis in Ace Partnership is $16,000.
