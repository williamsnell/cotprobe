Question:

Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:

Options:

A: would remain preserved in the memories of the remaining species.
B: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.
C: would evolve into a different form or essence.
D: would be destroyed only if the species was eliminated by unnatural causes.
E: would be absorbed by another species.
F: would transform into the essence of another existing species.
G: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.
H: would exist as long as there are traces or remnants of the species left in the world.
I: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.
J: would likewise be destroyed.

Alright, so I have this question about Aristotle's philosophy, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about Aristotle's views on essence and forms.

From what I remember, Aristotle was a bit different from his teacher Plato. Plato believed in the existence of Forms, which are these perfect, non-material universals that exist in another realm. So, for example, the Form of a horse is this perfect idea that all horses we see are just imitations of. But Aristotle had a different take. He didn't think these Forms existed separately from the individual things themselves.

Aristotle introduced the concept of essence, which he called the "whatness" of a thing. But unlike Plato, he didn't see this essence as a separate, universal entity. Instead, he believed that the essence is what makes an individual thing what it is, and it's tied directly to the individual. So, the essence of a horse isn't a separate Form; it's what each horse is, right there in the material world.

Now, the question is asking what Aristotle would say if all members of a species were destroyed. If there are no individuals left, does the essence survive, or does it go away? If I'm remembering correctly, Aristotle's view is that the essence isn't a separate thing. It exists only in the individuals. So if all the individuals are gone, there's no essence left. It doesn't linger on in another realm or get preserved in memories or anything like that.

Looking at the options:

A: Preserved in memories of other species. Hmm, Aristotle didn't think about universals existing in memories, so probably not.

B: The essence wasn't destroyed because there were no universals; only individuals. This sounds right. Since the essence isn't a separate thing, its destruction depends on the individuals. If the individuals are gone, the essence isn't destroyed because it never existed apart from them.

Wait, no. If all individuals are destroyed, wouldn't the essence also be destroyed? Or does B mean that there was no essence to begin with because it's not a separate thing. So if there are no individuals, the essence isn't destroyed because it didn't exist apart. So B is saying that the essence isn't destroyed because there was no essence apart; only individuals. That seems to align with Aristotle's view that essence is tied to individuals, so without individuals, the essence doesn't exist, but it wasn't destroyed because it's not a separate entity to destroy.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If essence is what makes an individual what it is, but it's not a separate thing, then the essence is just the collection of properties that the individuals have. So when all individuals are destroyed, those properties no longer exist in the world. So the essence would cease to exist as well. But option B says it's not destroyed because there was no essence originally. That's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, option J says the essence would likewise be destroyed. So if all individuals are destroyed, their essence is destroyed as well. But according to Aristotle, since the essence isn't a separate entity, it's not like it continues on. So when the individuals are gone, the essence isn't preserved. So J might be correct.

Wait, but the question is about whether the essence is destroyed. If the essence was never a separate thing, then when the individuals are gone, the essence isn't destroyed because it wasn't there. Hmm, maybe that's what B is saying. So B is saying the essence wasn't destroyed because there was no essence to destroy. That is, the essence isn't a separate entity, so it doesn't exist apart from the individuals. So when the individuals are gone, the essence doesn't exist anymore, but it wasn't destroyed because it's not a separate thing.

Wait, but that seems a bit contradictory. If the essence isn't a separate thing, then when the individuals die, the essence just ceases to be. So it's not that it's destroyed, but it's just not there anymore. But the question is about whether it's destroyed. So if the essence doesn't exist as a separate entity, then when the individuals are gone, the essence isn't destroyed because it wasn't a separate thing to begin with. That's what B is saying.

Alternatively, J says the essence would be destroyed as well. So which is it? I think the key is that Aristotle denies the existence of universals as separate entities. So the essence isn't something that can be destroyed because it's not a separate thing; it's just the properties of the individuals. So when the individuals are destroyed, those properties are gone, so the essence isn't preserved, but it's not destroyed because it wasn't a separate entity. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. B says the essence wasn't destroyed because there was no essence or form originally. So if there are no universals, just individuals, then the essence doesn't exist apart from the individuals. So when the individuals are gone, the essence isn't destroyed because it was never separate. So B is correct.

Alternatively, J says the essence would be destroyed. But according to Aristotle, the essence isn't destroyed because it's not a separate entity. So when the individuals are gone, the essence isn't destroyed; it just doesn't exist anymore. So I think B is the right answer.

Aristotle's philosophy differs from Plato's in that he rejects the idea of universals (Forms) existing independently of particulars. For Aristotle, the essence of a thing is what makes it what it is, but this essence is not a separate, universal entity; it is tied directly to the individual. Therefore, if all members of a species were destroyed, there would be no individuals left to instantiate the essence. Since the essence is not a separate entity, it cannot exist independently of the individuals. Thus, the essence would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyedâ€”it was always tied to the individuals.
