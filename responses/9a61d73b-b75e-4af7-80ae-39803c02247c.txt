Question:

 In the context of Gardiner's article, "the fragmentation of agency" refers to what?

Options:

A: an agent's inability to acknowledge his or her contribution to climate change
B: the fragmentation of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions across generations
C: the vast number of individuals and agents who contribute to climate change
D: the idea that it's not rational for each individual to restrict his or her own pollution

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what "the fragmentation of agency" refers to in Gardiner's article. I remember from my studies that this concept is related to climate change issues, specifically about how responsibility and agency are distributed among different actors.

Hmm, the options are A through D. Let's look at each one. 

Option A says it's about an agent's inability to acknowledge their contribution to climate change. That sounds a bit like the opposite of agency; maybe it's more about denial rather than fragmentation.

Option B talks about the fragmentation of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions across generations. That seems more like intergenerational issues, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what fragmentation of agency means. Agency is more about the ability to act, so maybe this isn't it.

Option C mentions the vast number of individuals and agents contributing to climate change. This sounds like diffusion of responsibility, where so many people are involved that no one feels personally responsible. But I'm not certain if that's exactly what Gardiner is referring to.

Option D says it's the idea that it's not rational for each individual to restrict their own pollution. This seems related because if everyone thinks others will reduce pollution, they might not feel compelled to do so themselves, leading to collective action problems. But how does that tie into fragmentation of agency?

Wait, fragmentation of agency in Gardiner's context is about how the responsibility is spread out so thinly that individuals don't feel a strong sense of personal responsibility. It's like each person's contribution is so small that it's hard to see the impact, so they don't feel the agency to act. So maybe it's about the idea that individually restricting pollution isn't rational because the impact is so fragmented. 

But I'm a bit confused between options C and D. Option C is about the number of agents contributing, while D is about the rationality of individual action. Gardiner's article discusses the paradox where, despite each individual contributing, the collective impact is significant, but individually it's hard to see the point of reducing pollution. So "fragmentation of agency" refers to how the problem is spread out, making individual action seem less impactful, hence why it's not rational for each person to act on their own. 

So I think the answer is D: the idea that it's not rational for each individual to restrict his or her own pollution.
