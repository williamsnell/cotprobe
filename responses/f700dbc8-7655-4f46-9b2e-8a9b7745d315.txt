Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about entropy change for a reaction. Hmm, I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder, and when substances react, their entropy changes contribute to the overall change in the system. The question gives me a reaction: Ti(s) + 2Cl₂(g) → TiCl₄(l). I need to find the entropy change (ΔS°) for the system at 298 K using the standard entropy data provided.

Let me list out the steps I think I should follow. First, I recall that the formula for calculating the entropy change of a reaction is the sum of the standard entropies of the products multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients minus the sum of the standard entropies of the reactants multiplied by their coefficients. So, ΔS° = Σ S°(products) - Σ S°(reactants).

Looking at the reaction, the reactants are Ti(s) and Cl₂(g), and the product is TiCl₄(l). The coefficients are 1 for Ti, 2 for Cl₂, and 1 for TiCl₄.

The standard entropy values given are:
- Ti(s): 7.2 eu/mole
- Cl₂(g): 53.3 eu/mole
- TiCl₄(l): 60.4 eu/mole

So, I need to calculate the total entropy for the products and the reactants.

For the products: Only TiCl₄ is produced, and its coefficient is 1. So, S°(products) = 60.4 eu/mole.

For the reactants: Ti(s) has an entropy of 7.2, and Cl₂(g) is 53.3. Since there are 2 moles of Cl₂, I multiply 53.3 by 2. So, S°(reactants) = 7.2 + (2 * 53.3).

Let me compute that. 2 times 53.3 is 106.6. Adding Ti's entropy: 106.6 + 7.2 equals 113.8 eu/mole.

Now, subtract the reactants' entropy from the products' entropy to get ΔS°. So, 60.4 (products) minus 113.8 (reactants) equals -53.4 eu/mole.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 53.3 multiplied by 2 is indeed 106.6. Adding 7.2 gives 113.8. Then, 60.4 minus 113.8 is definitely -53.4. That makes sense because the reactants are gases and solids, which have higher entropy than the liquid product. So the system's entropy decreases.

Looking at the options, option F is -53.4eu. But wait, the options include E and F as -107.4 and -53.4. Oh, I see, so the correct answer should be F.

The entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction is calculated by subtracting the total entropy of the reactants from the total entropy of the products. Using the given data:

ΔS° = [S°(TiCl₄)] - [S°(Ti) + 2×S°(Cl₂)]  
ΔS° = 60.4 - (7.2 + 2×53.3)  
ΔS° = 60.4 - 113.8  
ΔS° = -53.4 eu/mole  

The entropy change is -53.4 eu, corresponding to option F.

Answer: F
