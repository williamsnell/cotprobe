Question:

Two objects, a sphere and a block of the same mass, are released from rest at the top of an inclined plane. The sphere rolls down the inclined plane without slipping. The block slides down the plane without friction. Which object reaches the bottom of the ramp first?

Options:

A: The block, because it slides down faster due to its shape
B: The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does
C: The sphere, because it has less surface area in contact with the ramp
D: Both reach at the same time, as gravity acts equally on both objects
E: The block, because it has more surface area in contact with the ramp
F: The sphere, because its shape allows it to roll faster
G: The sphere, because it gains mechanical energy due to the torque exerted on it, but the block does not
H: The sphere, because it gains rotational kinetic energy, but the block does not
I: Both reach at the same time, as they both have the same mass
J: The block, because it does not lose mechanical energy due to friction, but the sphere does

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about two objects—a sphere and a block—both having the same mass. They’re released from rest at the top of an inclined plane. The sphere rolls down without slipping, and the block slides down without friction. The question is asking which one reaches the bottom first.

Hmm, I remember that when objects roll down inclined planes, their acceleration depends on their moment of inertia. The moment of inertia is like how resistant the object is to rotational motion. So, the sphere and the block probably have different moments of inertia because of their shapes.

Wait, the sphere is a solid object, so I think its moment of inertia is lower compared to the block. Because the sphere's mass is distributed more towards the center, whereas a block (which I assume is like a rectangular prism) has its mass distributed away from the center, right?

So, when the sphere rolls down, it's not just translating (moving straight) but also rotating. That means some of the gravitational potential energy is converted into both translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy. Oh right, because the sphere is rolling without slipping, there's a relationship between its linear velocity and angular velocity.

On the other hand, the block is sliding down without friction, so all of its gravitational potential energy is converted into translational kinetic energy. It doesn't have any rotational component because it's not rotating, it's just sliding.

Wait, so let me think about the acceleration. For objects rolling without slipping, the acceleration is given by a formula that depends on the moment of inertia. The formula is a = (g sin θ) / (1 + I/(m r²)), where I is the moment of inertia, m is mass, and r is the radius. Since the sphere has a lower moment of inertia (I = (2/5) m r² for a solid sphere), the denominator becomes 1 + (2/5) = 7/5. So the acceleration would be (5/7) g sin θ.

What about the block? Since it's just sliding without friction, it's treated as a point mass, so its moment of inertia is zero, right? Because all the mass is concentrated at a point. So the formula would be a = g sin θ. That makes sense because it's just moving straight down without any rotation, so it should have a higher acceleration.

Wait, but wait, the block's acceleration would be higher? Because a = g sin θ is higher than (5/7)g sin θ which is about 0.714 g sin θ. So the block accelerates faster than the sphere. That would mean the block reaches the bottom first.

Let me double-check. So, the sphere's acceleration is less because some of the energy is going into rotation. The block, not having any rotation, has all the energy going into linear motion, so it's faster. So the block should reach the bottom before the sphere.

Looking at the options, option B says, "The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does." That sounds right. Because the sphere has to distribute some energy into rotation, so it doesn't move as fast as the block.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's see. Option A says the block because it slides faster due to shape. Well, shape affects the moment of inertia, so that's a related reason but maybe not the most direct. Option J says the block because it doesn't lose energy to friction, but the sphere does. Wait, but the sphere is rolling without slipping, so friction is static and not dissipating energy. Both are losing energy? Or no, because in both cases, the energy is conserved. The sphere's energy is split between translation and rotation, but the block's is all translation. So maybe J isn't the right reason.

Wait, but in reality, if there were friction, it might cause some energy loss, but in this problem, the sphere isn't losing energy to friction—it's rolling without slipping, so static friction is doing work to rotate it, not kinetic friction. So I think J's reasoning isn't correct because both are losing no mechanical energy (since friction isn't causing energy loss here; for the sphere, it's torque causing rotation without energy loss). So J's reasoning is incorrect.

Option B is the right reason because the block doesn't have rotational KE, so all its energy goes into linear motion, making it faster. The sphere has to share its energy between rotation and translation, so it's slower.

So the correct answer should be option B.
</think>

The block reaches the bottom of the ramp first because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, while the sphere does. The sphere's gravitational potential energy is partially converted into rotational kinetic energy due to its moment of inertia, which slows its linear acceleration compared to the block. The block, having no rotational component, converts all its potential energy into translational kinetic energy, resulting in a higher acceleration. Therefore, the block reaches the bottom first.

Answer: B
