Question:

In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?

Options:

A: R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis
B: R2P always involves economic sanctions, whereas humanitarian intervention does not
C: R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention
D: R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress
E: R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not
F: Humanitarian intervention is essentially the same as R2P
G: Humanitarian intervention always requires UNSC approval while R2P does not
H: Humanitarian intervention requires a call for assistance by the State in distress while R2P does not
I: R2P is more arbitrary because it does not require UNSC input
J: R2P is a broader concept that includes economic sanctions, whereas humanitarian intervention is strictly military

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that R2P is a concept in international relations that deals with preventing mass atrocities. It's sometimes called a "doctrine" or a set of principles. From what I recall, R2P was developed as a response to situations where the international community felt compelled to intervene to protect people from their own governments, like in cases of genocide, war crimes, etc.

Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is when a country or an international body like the UN steps in to prevent humanitarian crises, usually without the consent of the target state. I think the key here is that R2P is more about the collective responsibility of the international community, not just individual states acting on their own.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and aims to avert a humanitarian crisis. Hmm, I remember that R2P does involve the UN Security Council, but I'm not sure if it's less arbitrary. Also, the primary objective of R2P is to prevent mass killings, so that makes sense.

Option B claims R2P always involves economic sanctions. I don't think that's right. R2P can involve a range of measures, including diplomatic, economic, and even military actions, but not necessarily always sanctions. So B might be incorrect.

Option C says R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention. No, I think R2P is broader and more structured, so C is probably not correct.

Option D states R2P requires a call for assistance from the State. I thought that R2P can be applied even if the state doesn't call for help, especially if the state is the cause of the problem. So D might not be right.

Option E says R2P always uses armed force. I know that's not true because R2P can involve non-military measures first. So E is incorrect.

Option F is the opposite of C, saying humanitarian intervention is the same as R2P. Still, I think they're different, so F is wrong.

Option G suggests humanitarian intervention always needs UNSC approval. I don't think so. Sometimes, states act unilaterally, like in Kosovo, without UNSC backing. So G is likely incorrect.

Option H says humanitarian intervention requires a call for help, while R2P doesn't. Wait, I'm not sure. I think R2P can apply even if the state isn't asking for help because the problem might be that the state is causing harm to its own people. So H could be correct, but I need to check.

Option I claims R2P is more arbitrary because it doesn't require UNSC input. That doesn't sound right. I thought R2P is meant to be a structured approach, possibly involving the UNSC, so I is probably wrong.

Option J says R2P is broader, including sanctions, while humanitarian intervention is strictly military. I think R2P includes various measures, including economic sanctions, whereas humanitarian intervention might be more military-focused, but I'm not entirely sure if J is accurate.

Wait, going back to the main points. R2P was developed to address the shortcomings of humanitarian intervention, which often happened without clear authorization and sometimes led to inconsistencies. R2P is a more formalized concept that includes a spectrum of measures, not just military. Also, I remember that R2P doesn't require the state's invitation necessarily, unlike some interpretations of humanitarian intervention which might require it.

Looking at the options again, Option A says R2P is less arbitrary because it requires UNSC input. But I think R2P doesn't always require UNSC approval. It can be invoked even if the UNSC is deadlocked, which happened in cases like Libya. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option H says humanitarian intervention requires a call for assistance, while R2P doesn't. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Humanitarian intervention often required the state's consent or at least a call for help, whereas R2P can be applied without the state's invitation if there's a mass atrocity.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought R2P was about the international community's responsibility, which could involve acting even without the state's consent. So if a state is committing atrocities, R2P allows for intervention without the state asking. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention might have sometimes required the state's request, though in practice, it's often not strictly necessary.

So looking at the options, H says humanitarian intervention requires a call for assistance by the state, while R2P does not. That seems correct because R2P is about the international community's responsibility to act even if the state doesn't ask.

But wait, I'm not 100% certain. Let me think of examples. The intervention in Kosovo in 1999 was a humanitarian intervention without UNSC approval and without Serbia's invitation. R2P was invoked in the case of Libya in 2011 with a UNSC resolution. So in that case, R2P did involve UNSC input, but in other cases, like the possibility of not getting UNSC approval, R2P might still be applied by individual states.

Hmm. So perhaps the key difference is that R2P doesn't require the state's invitation, whereas humanitarian intervention sometimes does. So H would be correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, H is: "Humanitarian intervention requires a call for assistance by the State in distress while R2P does not." So that would make H the correct answer.

Alternatively, Option A says R2P is less arbitrary because it requires UNSC input. But I think R2P doesn't always require UNSC input. It can be invoked by the General Assembly or other bodies if the UNSC is deadlocked. So A might not be correct.

So putting it all together, the difference is that R2P doesn't require the state's invitation, whereas humanitarian intervention might. Therefore, the correct answer is H.

The key distinction lies in whether the state's invitation is required. Humanitarian intervention often requires the state's call for assistance, while R2P can be applied without the state's consent, focusing on preventing mass atrocities.
