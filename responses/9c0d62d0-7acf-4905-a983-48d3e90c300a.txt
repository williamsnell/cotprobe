Okay, so I have this question about property law, specifically about tenancy by the entirety. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the scenario is that a wife and husband own a dairy as tenants by the entirety. Now, the wife transfers her interest to her aunt via a quitclaim deed without her husband's knowledge. I need to figure out what interest, if any, the aunt has.

I remember that tenancy by the entirety is a type of joint ownership, usually between spouses. The key features are that each spouse owns the whole property, and there's a right of survivorship. That means if one dies, the other automatically gets the entire interest; you can't transfer or dispose of your share without the other spouse's consent because the interest is considered as one.

So when the wife tries to transfer her interest, the big question is whether she can do that without the husband's knowledge. I think in a tenancy by the entirety, each spouse can't transfer their interest individually. Even if one signs a deed, it doesn't bind the other. So the wife alone can't convey her interest because the ownership is joint and the right of survivorship is a key feature.

Wait, but what about a quitclaim deed? A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time. But if the wife doesn't have the authority to transfer her interest because of the tenancy by the entirety, then the deed might not convey any valid interest. So the aunt wouldn't get anything because the wife couldn't legally transfer her share without the husband's consent.

Looking at the options, option H says "No interest." That makes sense because the wife couldn't transfer her interest in the tenancy by the entirety without the husband's agreement. The other options talk about various interests, but none apply here because the transfer was invalid.

So the answer should be H: No interest.

The wife and husband own the dairy as tenants by the entirety, meaning neither can transfer their interest without the other's consent. The wife's quitclaim deed is ineffective, so the aunt gains no interest.

Answer: H
