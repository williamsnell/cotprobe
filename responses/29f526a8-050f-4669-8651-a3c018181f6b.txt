Question:

A technician is working with dry ice (solid CO_2) in a closed 6000 liter fume hood maintained at a constant pressure of 1.00atmand a constant temperature of 27°C. If he has not been conditioned to tolerate CO_2, he will succumb to CO_2 poisoning when the concen-tration rises to 10%, by volume, of the atmosphere. If the ventilation stops, what minimum weight of dry ice must sublimate to constitute a hazard? Assume that there was no CO_2 present initially.

Okay, so I have this problem about dry ice in a fume hood, and I need to figure out the minimum weight of dry ice that must sublime to cause CO2 poisoning. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that dry ice is solid CO2, and when it sublimates, it turns directly into CO2 gas. The fume hood is closed, so the gas stays inside. The technician will be in trouble when the CO2 concentration reaches 10% by volume. The fume hood's volume is 6000 liters, and the conditions are constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (27°C). Initially, there's no CO2, so all the CO2 comes from the sublimated dry ice.

Hmm, I think I should use the ideal gas law here. PV = nRT. Since the pressure and temperature are constant, the volume of CO2 gas produced will be directly proportional to the number of moles of CO2.

Wait, but the problem is about volume percentage. So, if the total volume of the fume hood is 6000 liters, 10% of that is 600 liters. That means the volume of CO2 gas needs to reach 600 liters to be dangerous.

Wait, no. Wait, the volume of CO2 as a percentage of the total volume. So 10% of 6000 L is 600 L of CO2. So the volume of CO2 needed is 600 liters.

But wait, the ideal gas law relates n to V? Let me think. At constant P and T, V is proportional to n. So, if I can find n for 600 L of CO2, then I can find the mass of dry ice needed.

Wait, but CO2 when it sublimes becomes gas. So, the volume of CO2 gas at 1 atm and 27°C is 600 liters. So, how many moles is that?

I remember that at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. But wait, STP is 0°C and 1 atm. Here, the temperature is 27°C, which is 300 K. So I need to adjust for that.

The ideal gas law: V = nRT/P. So, n = PV/(RT).

P is 1 atm, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 27°C which is 300 K.

So, plugging in the numbers:

n = (1 atm * 600 L) / (0.0821 * 300)

Let me calculate that.

First, calculate the denominator: 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63.

So, n = 600 / 24.63 ≈ 24.36 moles.

So, 24.36 moles of CO2 are needed.

Now, the molar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol (12 from C and 32 from O2, so 44).

So, the mass is 24.36 mol * 44 g/mol ≈ 1071.84 grams.

Wait, but the options don't have 1071 g. The closest is option H: 1750 g, but that's higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, when I calculated n, I used V=600 L. Wait, but wait, when dry ice sublimes, does it produce CO2 gas at the same temperature and pressure? Yes, because the system is at constant 1 atm and 27°C.

Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Since the fume hood is at 1 atm and 27°C, the volume of CO2 produced is 600 L, so n is 600 L / (22.4 L/mol) but adjusted for the temperature.

Wait, wait, another approach: at STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L. But at 27°C, which is 300 K, the volume increases because V is proportional to T.

So, at STP (273 K), V = n * 22.4 L/mol.

At 300 K, V = n * (22.4 * (300/273)) L/mol.

So, 22.4 * (300/273) ≈ 22.4 * 1.10 ≈ 24.64 L/mol.

So, n = 600 L / 24.64 L/mol ≈ 24.35 mol.

Same as before. So 24.35 mol * 44 g/mol ≈ 1071 g.

Looking at the options, the closest higher value is H (1.75 kg = 1750 g), but that's way higher. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume.

Wait, the problem says the concentration is 10% by volume. So the volume of CO2 is 10% of the fume hood's volume. Fume hood is 6000 L, so 10% is 600 L. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the moles calculation is off. Let me recalculate n.

n = PV/(RT) = (1 atm * 600 L) / (0.0821 * 300) = 600 / (24.63) ≈ 24.36 mol.

Mass = 24.36 * 44 = 1071.84 g.

Looking at the options again, the choices are A:1kg, B:1.25kg, C:800g, D:1.1kg, E:500g, F:650g, G:2kg, H:1.75kg, I:950g, J:1.5kg.

Hmm, 1071g is about 1.07 kg. The options don't have that. The closest higher is D:1.10 kg (1100g), which is close. Or maybe I did a mistake in the volume.

Wait, wait, perhaps the volume I should use isn't 600 L. Let me think again.

Wait, the fume hood's volume is 6000 L. The CO2 needs to be 10% of that, so 600 L. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that when the dry ice sublimates, the volume of CO2 is 600 L, but the molar volume at 27°C is higher than 22.4 L/mol. So perhaps I should have used the molar volume at 27°C.

Wait, but I did that. So 24.36 mol * 44 g/mol = 1071g, which is about 1.07 kg. So the options don't have that exactly, but option D is 1.10 kg, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the n.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

n = (1 * 600) / (0.0821 * 300) = 600 / 24.63 ≈ 24.36.

So 24.36 *44= 1071.84g, which is 1.07184 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is D:1.10 kg.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial pressure is not standard, but since the fume hood is at 1 atm, and the CO2 is also at 1 atm, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the molar volume at 27°C is approximately 24.46 L/mol. Let me check that.

At 27°C (300 K), 1 mole of gas occupies V = RT/P = (0.0821)(300)/1 ≈ 24.63 L. So yes, 24.63 L/mol.

So 600 L /24.63 L/mol ≈24.36 mol.

So, yes, 24.36 *44=1071g. So 1071g is 1.071 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is D:1.10 kg. But wait, perhaps the options are rounded. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait another thought: when the dry ice sublimates, it becomes CO2 gas at 1 atm and 27°C. So the moles of CO2 would be n = PV/(RT). So, P is 1 atm, V is 600 liters, R is 0.0821, T is 300 K.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I should think in terms of grams. So, 24.36 mol *44 g/mol= 1071g, which is approximately 1.07 kg. Since the options don't have that, perhaps I have to choose the nearest option, which is D:1.10 kg.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial volume. Wait, the fume hood is 6000 liters, so 10% is 600 liters of CO2 gas.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the CO2 is in the same fume hood, so perhaps the pressure is fixed, but the volume doesn't change. So the number of moles is determined by the volume of CO2 in that fixed space.

So, I think the calculation is correct, and the answer should be approximately 1071 grams, which is about 1.07 kg. The closest option is D:1.10 kg.

But wait, looking back, I see that option B is 1.25 kg, which is 1250g, and option D is 1.10 kg (1100g). My calculation is 1071g, so closer to 1.10 kg.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the exact calculation.

n = 600 / (0.0821 * 300) = 600 /24.63.

Let me compute 24.63 *24 = 591.12, 24.63*24.36=?

Wait, 24 *24.63= 591.12, 0.36 *24.63≈8.8668, total≈599.9868, which is 600. So 24.36 is correct.

So 24.36 *44= 24.36 *40=974.4, 24.36*4=97.44, total 1071.84g.

So, 1071.84g is 1.07184 kg, which is approximately 1.07 kg. But the options don't have that. The closest is D:1.10 kg.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 1.25 kg, which is option B. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the volume of CO2 is 600 liters at 27°C, but maybe the ideal gas law should account for the initial conditions.

Wait, but I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conversion factor of 22.4 L/mol at STP, then adjust for temperature.

At STP, 22.4 L/mol. At 27°C (300 K), the volume increases by a factor of 300/273 ≈1.0989.

So, molar volume at 27°C is approximately 22.4 *1.0989 ≈24.6 L/mol.

So, n=600/24.6 ≈24.39 mol.

Same as before.

So, same answer.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but I think the closest is D:1.10 kg.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A:1.00 kg

B:1.25 kg

C:800 g

D:1.10 kg

E:500 g

F:650 g

G:2.00 kg

H:1.75 kg

I:950 g

J:1500 g

So, 1071g is 1.071 kg, which is between option D (1.10kg) and C (800g), perhaps closer to D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to not adjust for the temperature change, assuming STP. Let me try that.

If I assume that the CO2 volume is at STP, then n=600/22.4 ≈26.79 mol.

Then mass is 26.79 *44= 1182.76g ≈1.18kg, which would be about 1.25 kg, which is option B.

But wait, the problem states the temperature is 27°C, so I should use that. Using STP would be incorrect. So the correct approach is to use 27°C, giving about 1.07 kg.

So the closest option is D:1.10 kg.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the temperature change, using 22.4 L/mol directly. Let me see:

n=600/22.4=26.79 mol.

Mass=26.79 *44=1183g≈1.18 kg, which would round to 1.25 kg (option B).

But that's assuming STP, which is not the case here. So that approach is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct calculation should give around 1.07 kg, so the closest option is D:1.10 kg.

Wait, but I'm not seeing option D as 1.10 kg. Let me check the options again.

Yes, option D is 1.10 kg.

So, I think the correct answer is D:1.10 kg.

To determine the minimum weight of dry ice needed to reach a dangerous CO₂ concentration, we start by calculating the volume of CO₂ gas required. The fume hood has a total volume of 6000 liters, and the dangerous concentration is 10% by volume. Thus, the volume of CO₂ needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of CO}_2 = 0.10 \times 6000 \, \text{L} = 600 \, \text{L}.
\]

Using the ideal gas law at constant pressure and temperature, the number of moles of CO₂ can be calculated:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}.
\]

Here, \(P = 1 \, \text{atm}\), \(V = 600 \, \text{L}\), \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\), and \(T = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300 \, \text{K}\). Substituting these values:

\[
n = \frac{1 \times 600}{0.0821 \times 300} = \frac{600}{24.63} \approx 24.36 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molar mass of CO₂ is \(44 \, \text{g/mol}\). Therefore, the mass of dry ice required is:

\[
\text{Mass} = n \times \text{Molar Mass} = 24.36 \, \text{mol} \times 44 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 1071.84 \, \text{g} \, (\text{or } 1.07 \, \text{kg}).
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \(1.07 \, \text{kg}\) is \(1.10 \, \text{kg}\). Thus, the minimum weight of dry ice needed is:

**D: 1.10 kg**
