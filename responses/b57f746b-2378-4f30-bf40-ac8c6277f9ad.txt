Okay, so I have this question about language development in children. It's asking about changes during the latter part of their first year. The options are A through I. Let me think about what I know about language acquisition.

I remember that in the first year, babies go through a lot of changes. Early on, they start babbling, which is those random consonant-vowel sounds. Then, around 6-9 months, they start to understand more, like recognizing their name or simple words. But when does the significant change happen towards the end of the first year?

Option A says they begin to utter words in an unsystematic and random manner. Wait, isn't that more like the babbling phase which comes earlier? Maybe before they start forming actual words. So A might not be the right choice for the latter part of the first year.

Option B is about forming full sentences. I think that happens later, like in the second or third year. So B is probably not correct for the first year.

Option C suggests they produce more language than they can comprehend. That sounds a bit off because early on, they understand more than they can speak. As they start to talk, maybe around 1-2 years, they produce more, but I'm not sure if that's during the latter part of their first year. I'll keep this in mind.

Option D says they begin to utter their first words in a systematic way due to selective reinforcement of babbling. Selective reinforcement makes me think of how parents respond to certain sounds, encouraging the child to repeat them. So when they babble, and parents reinforce specific sounds, the child starts to form actual words. This seems right because that's when they start to say their first words, like "mama" or "dada." That would be around 9-12 months, which is the latter part of the first year.

Option E says they lose the ability to understand words in their own language. That doesn't make sense because understanding usually increases as they grow, not decreases. So E is probably wrong.

Option F is about sensitivity to speech rhythms. I think infants are sensitive to rhythms from a young age, maybe even in the first few months. So F might not be a change happening later in the first year.

Option G suggests losing the ability to perceive sound distinctions. Actually, I remember that without reinforcement, they might lose the ability to distinguish sounds not used in their native language. But G says they lose the ability, and that might happen later, not necessarily during the latter part of the first year.

Option H says they can perceive sound distinctions in multiple languages. I think this is more about their ability to hear different sounds, which might be present early but isn't the main change happening later in the first year.

Option I states they become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language. That sounds familiar. I think as they grow, they start to lose the ability to hear sounds not present in their native language. This process might occur around the first year, especially as they focus more on their own language's sounds. So I could be a contender.

Wait, but the question is about changes in their language-learning ability. So D is about starting to form first words, which is a significant milestone. I is about their ability to perceive sounds, which is also a change, but perhaps a later one.

So during the latter part of the first year, children start to say their first real words, which is D. I think that's the more accurate answer here. They go from babbling to actual words, which is a systematic progression because parents reinforce certain sounds, leading to more structured utterances.

The correct answer is D: begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling. This occurs during the latter part of the first year as children start to form meaningful words through reinforced babbling.

Answer: D
