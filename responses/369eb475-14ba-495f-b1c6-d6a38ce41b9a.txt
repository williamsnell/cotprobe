Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a sodium ethanoate solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that sodium ethanoate is the sodium salt of ethanoic acid. Ethanoic acid is another name for acetic acid, right? So sodium ethanoate would dissociate in water into sodium ions and ethanoate ions. The formula for sodium ethanoate is probably CH3COO Na, but more accurately, it's CH3COONa. 

Since sodium ions are spectator ions, they don't affect the pH. The ethanoate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of ethanoic acid. That means it will hydrolyze in water to produce hydroxide ions, making the solution basic. So the pH should be above 7.

Now, the problem gives me 0.0300 mol of sodium ethanoate dissolved in 50 mL of solution. Wait, 50 mL is 0.05 liters. So the concentration (molarity) would be moles divided by liters. Let me calculate that: 0.0300 mol / 0.05 L = 0.6 M. So the concentration of ethanoate ions is 0.6 M.

Next, I need to find the pH. Since it's a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the solution will be basic. I'll probably need to use the Kb expression for the ethanoate ion. But wait, I know the Ka for ethanoic acid is given as 1.8 × 10^-5. So to find Kb, I can use Kw = Ka * Kb. Kw is 1.0 × 10^-14 at 25°C, right?

So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1.0 divided by 1.8 is about 0.555..., so 0.555e-9, which is 5.56e-10. 

Now, the ethanoate ion will react with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb is 5.56e-10. 

I can set up the ICE table. Let me denote the concentration as c, which is 0.6 M. Let x be the amount of ethanoate that reacts. So:

Initial:
CH3COO^-: 0.6 M
H2O: lots, so negligible
CH3COOH: 0
OH^-: 0

Change:
CH3COO^-: -x
H2O: +x (but negligible)
CH3COOH: +x
OH^-: +x

Equilibrium:
CH3COO^-: 0.6 - x ≈ 0.6 (since Kb is small, x is tiny)
CH3COOH: x
OH^-: x

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / 0.6 = 5.56e-10.

Solving for x: x^2 = 0.6 * 5.56e-10 ≈ 3.336e-10. So x = sqrt(3.336e-10) ≈ 1.826e-5 M. 

That's the concentration of OH^- ions. Now, to find pOH: pOH = -log(1.826e-5). Let's compute that.

Log(1.826) is about 0.262, so log(1.826e-5) is 0.262 -5 = -4.738. So pOH ≈ 4.738. 

Then pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 4.738 = 9.262. Looking at the options, H is 9.26, which seems to match. 

Wait, but let me double-check the Kb calculation. Ka is 1.8e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = approximately 5.555...e-10. So that's correct. 

Also, the approximation that x is negligible compared to 0.6 M is valid because Kb is so small. So the solution should be around pH 9.26. Looking at the choices, option H is 9.26, so that should be the answer.

The pH of the solution is calculated by determining the basicity of the sodium ethanoate, which dissociates into ethanoate ions (CH₃COO⁻). These ions hydrolyze in water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻) and making the solution basic. The concentration of ethanoate ions is 0.6 M, and the Kb is calculated using Kw = Ka × Kb, where Ka for ethanoic acid is 1.8 × 10⁻⁵. This gives Kb ≈ 5.56 × 10⁻¹⁰. Using the ICE table and the small Kb value, the concentration of OH⁻ ions is found to be approximately 1.826 × 10⁻⁵ M. The pOH is then calculated as 4.738, and the pH is 14 - 4.738 ≈ 9.26. Among the options, the closest match is **H: 9.26**.
