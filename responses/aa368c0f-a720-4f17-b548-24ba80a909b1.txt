Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: Calculate the approximate molar weight of 35.0 grams of a non-electrolyte in solution with 100ml of water. The boiling point of the solution is 102.16°C. The options are from A to J, each giving a different value for molar weight.

Hmm, right. I remember that boiling point elevation is a colligative property, which depends on the number of particles in the solution. Since the solute is a non-electrolyte, it doesn't dissociate in water, so each mole of solute contributes one mole of particles.

First, I think I need to use the formula for boiling point elevation. The formula is ΔT = Kb * molality * i, where ΔT is the change in boiling point, Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for the solvent (here, water), molality is the concentration of solute, and i is the van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into).

Since the solute is a non-electrolyte, i should be 1. That simplifies things.

I remember that the Kb for water is 0.52°C·kg/mol. I think that's correct. Let me double-check that in my notes. Yeah, I think that's right.

So the boiling point of pure water is 100°C. The solution boils at 102.16°C, so ΔT is 102.16 - 100 = 2.16°C.

Now, plugging into the formula: ΔT = Kb * molality * i. Since i=1, it's 2.16 = 0.52 * molality. So molality = 2.16 / 0.52.

Let me calculate that. 2.16 divided by 0.52. Hmm, 0.52 times 4 is 2.08, which is close to 2.16. So 4.15 approximately. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

2.16 / 0.52 = ?

Well, 0.52 * 4 = 2.08. Subtract that from 2.16: 2.16 - 2.08 = 0.08. Bring down a zero: 0.080. 0.52 goes into 0.080 about 0.1538 times. So total is approximately 4.1538. So molality is about 4.15 mol/kg.

Wait, no, wait. Let me do that division properly. 2.16 ÷ 0.52.

Another way: 2.16 ÷ 0.52 = (216 ÷ 52) * (10 ÷ 100) → Wait, maybe better to compute 2.16 / 0.52.

Let me compute 0.52 times 4.15. 0.52 *4 = 2.08, 0.52 *0.15=0.078. So 2.08+0.078=2.158. Which is very close to 2.16. So 4.15 is correct. So molality is about 4.15 mol/kg.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because molality is moles of solute per kg of solvent. The solvent here is 100 ml of water. I need to convert that to kg. Since 100 ml of water is approximately 100 grams (because 1 mL of water is about 1 gram). So 100 grams is 0.1 kg.

So, molality is moles solute / kg solvent. So moles solute = molality * kg solvent.

Wait, no, molality is moles per kg solvent. So moles = molality * kg solvent.

So, moles = 4.15 mol/kg * 0.1 kg = 0.415 mol.

But wait, I have 35.0 grams of solute. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 35.0 g / M = 0.415 mol.

So solving for M: M = 35.0 g / 0.415 mol.

Calculating that: 35 / 0.415. Let me compute this.

Well, 0.415 is approximately 4/9.6, but perhaps a better approach is to compute 35 divided by 0.415.

Let me compute 0.415 into 35.

0.415 * 84 = let's see: 0.4*84=33.6, 0.015*84=1.26 → total 34.86. That's close to 35. So 84 * 0.415 = 34.86. So 35 is a bit more than 84. Let's compute 84.2 * 0.415.

84 *0.415=34.86, 0.2 *0.415=0.083 → total 34.943. Still under 35.

84.3 *0.415: 84 *0.415=34.86, 0.3*0.415=0.1245 → total 34.9845. Closer.

84.4 *0.415: 84*0.415=34.86, 0.4*0.415=0.166 → total 35.026. So 84.4 gives 35.026, which is just over 35. So 35 / 0.415 ≈84.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 35 ÷ 0.415 more accurately.

Dividing 35 by 0.415:

35 ÷ 0.415 = ?

Let me write it as 35000 ÷ 415.

415 × 84 = ?

415×80=33200, 415×4=1660 → total 34860.

35000 - 34860 = 140. So 84 with a remainder of 140.

Now, 140 ÷ 415 = 0.337 approximately.

So 84.337. So M ≈84.3 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 84 g/mol, which is very close. So the answer should be option I.

To determine the molar mass of the solute, we use the boiling point elevation formula:

\[
\Delta T = K_b \cdot m \cdot i
\]

Given:
- \( \Delta T = 102.16^\circ \text{C} - 100^\circ \text{C} = 2.16^\circ \text{C} \)
- \( K_b \) (for water) = 0.52 \(^\circ \text{C·kg/mol}\)
- \( i = 1 \) (since the solute is a non-electrolyte)

Rearranging for molality (\( m \)):

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T}{K_b} = \frac{2.16}{0.52} \approx 4.15 \, \text{mol/kg}
\]

The solution uses 100 mL of water, which is approximately 0.1 kg. Molality is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent:

\[
\text{Moles of solute} = m \cdot \text{kg of solvent} = 4.15 \cdot 0.1 = 0.415 \, \text{mol}
\]

The solute mass is 35.0 g. Using the formula \( \text{Molar mass} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Moles}} \):

\[
\text{Molar mass} = \frac{35.0 \, \text{g}}{0.415 \, \text{mol}} \approx 84.4 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

From the options, the closest value is **84 g/mol**, corresponding to option I.
