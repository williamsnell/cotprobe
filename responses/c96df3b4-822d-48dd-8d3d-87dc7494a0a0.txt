Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum of the function f(x, y) = 2x - 5y, given that x² + y² = 144. Hmm, this looks like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that when dealing with such problems, especially involving functions of two variables and a circular constraint, using Lagrange multipliers is a good approach. Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the constraint and substitute into the function to turn it into a single-variable optimization problem. Let me think through both methods.

First, Lagrange multipliers. The idea is to find the points where the gradient of f is parallel to the gradient of the constraint function g(x, y) = x² + y² - 144. So, I'll set up the equations ∇f = λ∇g.

Calculating the gradients:
∇f = (df/dx, df/dy) = (2, -5)
∇g = (dg/dx, dg/dy) = (2x, 2y)

Setting them proportional:
2 = λ * 2x  → 2 = 2λx → λ = 1/x
-5 = λ * 2y → -5 = 2λy → substituting λ from above, -5 = 2*(1/x)*y → -5 = (2y)/x → 2y = -5x → y = (-5/2)x

Now, substitute y into the constraint equation x² + y² = 144. So y = (-5/2)x, so y² = (25/4)x².

So x² + (25/4)x² = 144 → (1 + 25/4)x² = 144 → (29/4)x² = 144 → x² = (144 * 4)/29 = 576/29 → x = ±√(576/29) = ±24/√29.

So, x can be 24/√29 or -24/√29. Let me calculate both possibilities.

Case 1: x = 24/√29
Then y = (-5/2)*(24/√29) = (-120)/(2√29) = -60/√29.

Then f(x, y) = 2x -5y = 2*(24/√29) -5*(-60/√29) = 48/√29 + 300/√29 = 348/√29. Let me compute 348 divided by √29. But wait, since √29 is about 5.385, 348/5.385 ≈ 64.62. Hmm, that's a positive value. So that's a maximum, perhaps? Because we're looking for the minimum, maybe the other case is the minimum.

Case 2: x = -24/√29
Then y = (-5/2)*(-24/√29) = (120)/(2√29) = 60/√29.

Then f(x, y) = 2*(-24/√29) -5*(60/√29) = (-48/√29) - 300/√29 = (-348)/√29 ≈ -64.62.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -64.62. So that's a candidate. But let me check if that's indeed the minimum.

Alternatively, I could parameterize the circle using trigonometric functions. Since x² + y² = 144, I can write x = 12 cosθ and y = 12 sinθ, where θ is from 0 to 2π.

Substituting into f(x, y): f(θ) = 2*(12 cosθ) -5*(12 sinθ) = 24 cosθ -60 sinθ.

Now, this is a function of θ, and I can find its minimum. The expression 24 cosθ -60 sinθ can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude. Alternatively, since the maximum and minimum of a function a cosθ + b sinθ is ±√(a² + b²).

Wait, more accurately, the amplitude R is √(24² + (-60)^2) = √(576 + 3600) = √4176. Let me compute that. 4176 divided by 16 is 261, so √(4176)=√(16*261)=4√261. Now, what's √261? 16^2=256, so √261≈16.16. So R≈4*16.16≈64.64. So the maximum would be about 64.64, and the minimum would be -64.64, which aligns with the previous result.

So the minimum value is approximately -64.62, which is option B.

Wait, but in the Lagrange multiplier method, I got exactly -348/√29. Let me compute that exactly. 348 divided by √29. Let me see: √29 is about 5.385164807. So 348 / 5.385164807 ≈ let's compute 348 ÷ 5.385164807.

Calculating 5.385164807 × 64 = 345.648 (since 5.385164807 × 60 = 323.1098884, plus 5.385164807 ×4=21.54065923, so total 323.1098884+21.54065923=344.6505476). So 64 × 5.385164807 ≈ 344.6505476. The difference is 348 - 344.6505476 = 3.3494524. So now, 3.3494524 ÷ 5.385164807 ≈ 0.6216. So total is 64.6216, so 348/√29 ≈ 64.6216, so negative is -64.6216, which rounds to -64.62, matching option B.

Alternatively, maybe I can rationalize it. 348/√29 multiplied by √29/√29 is (348√29)/29. Let me compute 348 ÷ 29: 29×12=348, so 348=29×12. So (348√29)/29 = 12√29. So 12√29 is exactly the value. Since √29 is about 5.385, 12×5.385≈64.62. So f(x,y) at the minimum is -12√29, which is approximately -64.62, so that's correct.

The problem involves minimizing the function \( f(x, y) = 2x - 5y \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 144 \). Using Lagrange multipliers, we find that the minimum occurs at \( x = -24/\sqrt{29} \) and \( y = 60/\sqrt{29} \), giving \( f(x, y) = -12\sqrt{29} \approx -64.62 \). This matches option B.
