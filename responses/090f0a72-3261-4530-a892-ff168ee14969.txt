Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about tuning forks and beat notes. Hmm, I remember that when two tuning forks are played together, they can create a beat note. The beat note's frequency is the difference between the frequencies of the two forks. So, the formula I think is beat frequency = |f1 - f2|, where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two forks.

The problem says that when two tuning forks are sounded, the beat note is 5 cycles per second. One fork has a known frequency of 256 Hz. Then, when a small piece of adhesive tape is stuck to this fork, the beat note reduces to 3 Hz. I need to find the frequency of the other fork.

Wait, so the first scenario: beat note is 5 Hz. Let's call the known fork A, with fA = 256 Hz, and the other fork B with fB as what we need to find. So the beat is |256 - fB| = 5. But wait, which one is higher? If the beat is 5, then either fB is 256 +5=261 or 256-5=251.

Then, when the tape is applied to fork A, its frequency changes. I think adding mass to a tuning fork would lower its frequency because mass affects the vibrating length or something. So, when the tape is added, the frequency of A decreases. Let me think, when you add mass, the fork's effective length changes, making it slower, so the frequency goes down.

So, after adding the tape, the beat note becomes 3 Hz. So now, the new frequency of A is fA'. So the beat is |fA' - fB| =3.

Wait, but fA' is less than 256. Let's say originally fB was either 261 or 251. Then, after the tape, the beat is 3. Let me test both possibilities.

First possibility: If fB was 261. Then, after the tape, the beat is 3. So |fA' -261|=3. That would mean fA' is either 264 (which is higher than 256, but tape should lower it, so that's not possible) or 258. Wait, 261-3=258. So fA' would be 258. But the original fA was 256, and the tape made it lower, so 258 is higher than 256. That can't be right. So this possibility is invalid.

Second possibility: If fB was 251. Then, after the tape, the beat is |fA' -251|=3. So fA' could be 254 or 258. But since the tape lowers the frequency of A, fA' has to be less than 256. So 254 is possible. So fA' =254, which is lower than 256. That makes sense.

Wait, but let me think again. Before the tape, the beat was 5 Hz. So when A was 256 and B was 251, the beat is 5. Then, when A is lowered to 254, the beat becomes |254-251|=3. That fits the problem statement.

So the other fork B must be 251 Hz. Looking at the options, option D is 251.

When two tuning forks are sounded simultaneously, the beat note is the absolute difference between their frequencies. Initially, the beat note is 5 Hz, and one fork has a known frequency of 256 Hz. Let the frequency of the other fork be \( f_B \). Thus, \( |256 - f_B| = 5 \), giving two possibilities: \( f_B = 261 \) Hz or \( f_B = 251 \) Hz.

When a small piece of adhesive tape is fastened to the first fork, its frequency decreases. The beat note then reduces to 3 Hz. Let the new frequency of the first fork be \( f_A' \). Now, \( |f_A' - f_B| = 3 \). Since the tape lowers the frequency of the first fork, \( f_A' < 256 \).

Testing the possibilities:
1. If \( f_B = 261 \), then \( |f_A' - 261| = 3 \). This implies \( f_A' = 258 \) or \( 264 \). However, \( f_A' \) must be less than 256, so this is not possible.
2. If \( f_B = 251 \), then \( |f_A' - 251| = 3 \). This implies \( f_A' = 254 \) or \( 258 \). Since \( f_A' < 256 \), \( f_A' = 254 \) is valid.

Thus, the frequency of the other fork is \( 251 \) Hz, corresponding to option D.
