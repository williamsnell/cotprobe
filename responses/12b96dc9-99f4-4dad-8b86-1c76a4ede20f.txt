Question:

A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?

Options:

A: Hematoma of the left thigh
B: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
C: Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization
D: Side effect of prolonged bed rest
E: Peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes
F: Spinal cord injury during IVC filter placement
G: Sciatic nerve damage during hospitalization
H: Adverse reaction to warfarin
I: Complication of the IVC filter placement
J: Deep vein thrombosis in the left leg

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the cause of the patient's decreased sensation in her left thigh. Let me start by going through the information given.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman who had a pulmonary embolism and was treated in the hospital for three weeks. During her stay, she had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which led to temporarily stopping her anticoagulant therapy. She also had an IVC filter placed. She had a hematoma that was resolving when she was discharged two weeks ago. Now, she's reporting a persistent tingling and numbness in her left thigh that she didn't mention before because she thought it would go away. It has improved a bit, but it's still there.

Her medications are only warfarin. Her vital signs are normal, and her skin looks fine. Muscle strength is normal, but she has decreased sensation to light touch over a 5x5 cm area on the lateral aspect of her left anterior thigh.

So, I need to think about what could cause decreased sensation in that area. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Hematoma of the left thigh. She had a resolving hematoma, but usually, hematomas cause pain and swelling, not necessarily numbness. Plus, the area is the lateral thigh, and the hematoma was elsewhere, maybe? Not sure.

Option B: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This nerve is responsible for sensation in the lateral thigh. If it's compressed, like from a hematoma or something pressing on it, that could cause the symptoms. That seems possible.

Option C: Cerebral infarction. She didn't have any signs of stroke, like weakness or aphasia. Her muscle strength is normal, so probably not.

Option D: Prolonged bed rest. Prolonged immobility can cause issues like deep vein thrombosis or pressure sores, but peripheral neuropathy from bed rest? I'm not too sure. Maybe, but not the first thing that comes to mind.

Option E: Diabetic neuropathy. She doesn't have diabetes mentioned, so probably not the cause here.

Option F: Spinal cord injury during IVC filter placement. That's a possibility, but IVC filters are usually placed without causing spinal injuries. Plus, she didn't report any back pain or other symptoms.

Option G: Sciatic nerve damage. The sciatic nerve is in the back of the thigh, and the area described is the lateral anterior thigh. So maybe not sciatic, which is more about the back of the leg and foot.

Option H: Adverse reaction to warfarin. Warfarin can cause skin necrosis or other issues, but usually not localized numbness. More about bleeding or skin changes.

Option I: Complication of IVC filter placement. IV filters can sometimes cause issues like vein perforation or thrombosis. But how would that cause lateral thigh numbness? Maybe if it's compressing some structure, but I'm not sure.

Option J: Deep vein thrombosis. DVT can cause pain and swelling, but the symptoms here are more about sensation. Maybe if the DVT is causing pressure on a nerve, but her DVT was treated, and she has an IVC filter now.

Wait, considering that she had an IVC filter placed, sometimes the placement can cause injury to nearby structures. The IVC filter goes into the vena cava, but the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is near the groin. Maybe during the placement, there was some compression or injury to that nerve.

Alternatively, the retroperitoneal hemorrhage and temporary discontinuation of anticoagulants led to placement of the IVC filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving, which might have pressed on the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

The area of decreased sensation is on the lateral anterior thigh, which is exactly where the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve supplies. So compression or injury to this nerve could cause the symptoms.

Looking back, during her hospital stay, she had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which required stopping her anticoagulants. She had an IVC filter placed, which is typically inserted percutaneously, often through the femoral vein. That procedure might have caused some pressure or injury to the nearby structures, like the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

So the most likely cause is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which is option B. Alternatively, could it be from the IVC filter placement complication? Option I. But the IVC filter is more about the vena cava, so maybe the compression happened during the procedure, leading to temporary or minor nerve compression.

Another possibility is that the IVC filter placement caused some local inflammation or compression of the nerve. But the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is a sensory nerve, so its compression would lead to the symptoms described.

So I think the answer is B: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.
</think>

The patient's symptoms of decreased sensation in the lateral anterior thigh align with the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Given her recent hospitalization, including IVC filter placement and a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, it is plausible that the nerve was compressed or injured during these procedures. The decreased sensation is localized and consistent with nerve compression rather than other causes like diabetes or spinal injury. 

Answer: B
