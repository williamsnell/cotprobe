Okay, so I have this question about Anscombe's claims regarding an adequate moral psychology. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that Elizabeth Anscombe was a 20th-century philosopher known for her work in ethics, particularly in the context of modern moral philosophy. She was critical of certain aspects of utilitarianism and wrote about the role of intention in ethics.

The question is asking what an adequate moral psychology would include based on Anscombe's views. The options are A through J, with G being "all of the above." I need to figure out which of these she would emphasize.

Let's go through each option:

A: Detailed understanding of societal norms and expectations. I'm not sure if Anscombe focused on societal norms as the basis for moral psychology. She might have considered them, but I think she was more into the structure of moral reasoning rather than just societal expectations.

B: Comprehensive review of historical philosophical theories. That sounds more like a general philosophy approach rather than specific to moral psychology. Anscombe might have built on historical theories, but I don't think this is what she emphasized as necessary for moral psychology.

C: Influence of personal experiences on moral decisions. This seems more aligned with a more relativistic or empirical approach. Anscombe's work, as I recall, was more about the structure of moral concepts rather than personal experiences.

D: Analyses of concepts such as “action” and “intention.” This rings a bell. Anscombe wrote about the role of intention in moral actions. She was critical of utilitarianism for not focusing enough on the role of intentions. So this seems correct.

E: Integration of religious beliefs into moral decisions. I don't think Anscombe necessarily tied moral psychology to religious beliefs. She might have had her own views, but I don't recall this being a central point in her moral psychology framework.

F: Thorough study of the subconscious mind. This sounds more like psychology or even Freudian concepts. Anscombe was a philosopher, so I don't think this was her focus. She was more about the conceptual analysis of moral terms.

G: All of the above. If D is correct, but others aren't, then G isn't right. So I need to check if any others are correct.

H: Exploration of 'good' and 'evil.' While these are important in ethics, I'm not sure if Anscombe's moral psychology specifically includes this. She might discuss them, but it's not her main point about what moral psychology should include.

I: Answer to the mind-body problem. That's a metaphysical issue, and while related to philosophy, it's not directly about moral psychology as such.

J: Explanation of how free will is possible. This is a significant topic in ethics, but I'm not certain if Anscombe's focus was on this within moral psychology. She might have discussed it, but I think her main point was about intention.

So, from this, D seems correct. She emphasized the analysis of concepts like action and intention. The other options don't fit as well with her specific contributions. Therefore, the answer should be D.
