Question:

In a simple ecosystem there exists a field of clover. Mice eat theclover and skunks eat the mice. The skunks are in turn eatenby wolves. According to the ten percent rule of ecologicalefficiency, how much energy would a wolf receive fromthe original clover plants?

Options:

A: 0.01 calories
B: 5 calories
C: 100 calories
D: 0.1 calories
E: 50 calories
F: 10 calories
G: 1,000 calories
H: 500 calories
I: 25 calories
J: 1 calorie

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this ecology question about the ten percent rule. Let's see. The question is about a simple ecosystem with clover, mice, skunks, and wolves. The setup is a classic food chain: clover → mice → skunks → wolves.

The question asks how much energy a wolf would receive from the original clover plants, using the ten percent rule. The options are from A to J, with various calorie amounts.

First, I remember that the ten percent rule, or the law of the minimum, says that only about 10% of the energy at one trophic level is passed on to the next. So each time you move up a level, the energy is reduced by a factor of ten.

Let's break it down step by step. Suppose the clover plants have a certain amount of energy, say E calories. The mice, being the primary consumers, would get about 10% of that, so E * 0.1. Then the skunks, which eat the mice, would get 10% of the mice's energy, which is (E * 0.1) * 0.1 = E * 0.01. Finally, the wolves, which eat the skunks, would get 10% of the skunks' energy, so (E * 0.01) * 0.1 = E * 0.001.

Wait, but the question is asking how much energy the wolf gets from the original clover. So if the clover starts with, say, 1000 calories, the mice would get 100, skunks 10, and wolves 1. But wait, the options don't necessarily have 1 calorie as an answer unless I'm missing something.

Looking at the options, option J is 1 calorie. But I think I might have made a mistake because the options don't specify the starting point. Let me think again. Maybe the question assumes the clover has 100 calories. So mice get 10, skunks get 1, and wolves get 0.1. But looking at the options, D is 0.1 calories, which would match if the clover was 100 calories.

Wait, the question says "how much energy would a wolf receive from the original clover plants." So the energy transfer goes through three steps: from clover to mice (10%), mice to skunks (another 10%), and skunks to wolves (another 10%). So it's (10% of 10% of 10%) of the clover's energy.

If the clover has, for example, 1000 calories, then mice get 100, skunks 10, wolves 1. So the wolf gets 1 calorie from the clover. But looking at the options, J is 1 calorie. Alternatively, if the starting point is 100 calories, the wolf would get 0.1 calories, which is option D.

Hmm, the question doesn't specify the starting amount of energy in the clover. That's a problem. But perhaps the question assumes that the wolf receives 0.1% of the clover's energy. Wait, let me calculate again: each transfer is 10%, so three steps would be 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.001, or 0.1% of the original energy.

If the original clover has, say, 1000 calories, then the wolf gets 1 calorie. If the clover has 100 calories, the wolf gets 0.1 calories. But looking at the options, some are in whole numbers, others are fractions.

Wait, the options don't give the starting value, so I must have to consider that the correct answer is 0.1% of whatever the starting energy is. But looking at the options, I see option D is 0.1 calories, which would be if the starting point is 100 calories. But without knowing the starting point, I can't be certain. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of the percentage, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the starting energy is 100 calories. Let me check: Clover (100) → Mice: 10 → Skunks: 1 → Wolves: 0.1. So the wolf gets 0.1 calories from the clover. That would make option D the correct answer.

But wait, another way to think: the ten percent rule applies at each level. So if the clover has X calories, the mice have 0.1X, skunks have 0.01X, and wolves have 0.001X. So the wolf gets 0.1% of the clover's energy. The question is about how much the wolf receives from the original clover, so it's 0.001X.

If the options are given without knowing X, perhaps the question expects a general answer. But the options are specific numbers, so maybe the question is implying that the starting energy is 100 calories, making the wolf get 0.1 calories (option D).

Alternatively, maybe the starting energy is 1000 calories: then the wolf gets 1 calorie (option J). But without knowing the starting point, it's ambiguous. However, in the options, the only possible answers are D and J. Looking back, the options are A:0.01, B:5, C:100, D:0.1, E:50, F:10, G:1000, H:500, I:25, J:1.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the exact number but the general application. The wolf is three steps away, so 10% each time: 10% *10% *10% = 1%, which is 0.01 in decimal. So 0.01 times the original energy. If the original was 100, then 1, but if the original was 10, then 0.1.

Wait, but the options include 0.01 (A) and 0.1 (D). The options don't specify the starting point, so perhaps the correct answer is 0.1 calories, assuming the starting point is 100. Alternatively, it's 1 calorie if the starting point is 1000. But without that info, I'm a bit stuck.

But in most textbook examples, they often use 100 calories as the starting point for simplicity. So 100 → 10 → 1 → 0.1. So the wolf gets 0.1 calories, which is option D.

The question involves a simple food chain where energy transfer follows the ten percent rule. Clover → mice → skunks → wolves. Each step transfers 10% of the energy from the previous level. If the clover has 100 calories, the mice receive 10 calories, skunks receive 1 calorie, and wolves receive 0.1 calories. Thus, the wolf receives 0.1 calories from the original clover. 

Answer: D
