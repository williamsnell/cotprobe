Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the theoretical variance of a random variable. The distribution is given with specific probabilities for each value of x. Let's see... x can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the probabilities are 1/4, 1/2, 1/8, and 1/8 respectively. Hmm, I remember variance involves some kind of squared differences from the mean, right?

First, I think I should calculate the expected value or the mean of the distribution because variance depends on that. The formula for variance is E[X²] minus (E[X])². So I need to find both the mean (E[X]) and E[X squared].

Let me start with E[X]. To find this, I multiply each x by its probability and sum them up. 

So for x=0: 0 * (1/4) = 0
x=1: 1 * (1/2) = 1/2
x=2: 2 * (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4
x=3: 3 * (1/8) = 3/8

Adding these up: 0 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 3/8. Let me convert everything to eighths to make it easier. 1/2 is 4/8, 1/4 is 2/8, so adding them: 4/8 + 2/8 + 3/8 = 9/8. So E[X] is 9/8, which is 1.125. That's the mean.

Next, I need E[X²]. For this, I square each x, multiply by its probability, and sum them. 

x=0: 0² * (1/4) = 0
x=1: 1² * (1/2) = 1/2
x=2: 2² * (1/8) = 4/8 = 1/2
x=3: 3² * (1/8) = 9/8

Adding these up: 0 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 9/8. Let's convert to eighths again. 1/2 is 4/8, so 4/8 + 4/8 = 8/8, plus 9/8 is 17/8. So E[X²] is 17/8, which is 2.125.

Now, variance is E[X²] - (E[X])². So that's 2.125 minus (9/8)^2. Let's compute (9/8)^2. 9 squared is 81, 8 squared is 64, so 81/64. 81 divided by 64 is approximately 1.265625.

So variance is 2.125 minus 1.265625. Let me subtract these. 2.125 is 34/16 (since 2.125 = 2 + 1/8 = 17/8, which is 34/16). Wait, maybe it's easier to convert 2.125 to 68/32 and 1.265625 to 81/64, which is 12.65625/16. Hmm, maybe decimals would be easier.

2.125 minus 1.265625 is 0.859375. Let me check: 2.125 is 2.1250 and 1.265625 is subtracted. So 2.1250 -1.265625 = 0.859375.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 0.859, which is approximately 0.859375. So the variance is about 0.859, which would be option I.

To find the variance, calculate the mean (E[X]) and E[X²], then use the formula Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])². The mean is 9/8 (1.125), and E[X²] is 17/8 (2.125). Subtracting (9/8)² (1.265625) from 2.125 gives approximately 0.859, matching option I.

Answer: I
