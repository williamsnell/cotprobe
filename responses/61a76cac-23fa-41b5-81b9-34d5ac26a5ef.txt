Question:

Costs for producing one widget: Materials:2 parts (a) $25.00 per part Expenses :$10.00 Labor :20 operations (a) $5.00 per operation Based on the above information, which is the only valid conclusion? (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget. (B) labor rates are excessive (C) output is labor intensive (D) material costs are low

Options:

A: Each widget requires $50.00 in labor for 10 operations
B: Material costs represent the smallest fraction of the total production cost
C: output is labor intensive
D: material costs are low
E: Expenses are greater than the combined costs of materials and labor
F: The selling price should be $160 per widget
G: The most significant cost in producing a widget is the expense fee
H: labor rates are excessive
I: The total cost of production is less than $100 per widget
J: There are 10 operations involved in labor, each at $10.00 per operation

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which conclusion is valid based on the given costs for producing one widget. Let me break down the information first.

The materials cost is 2 parts at $25 each, so that's 2 times 25, which is $50. Then there are expenses of $10. I'm not sure what these expenses areâ€”maybe overhead or something else. Then labor is 20 operations at $5 each, so that's 20 times 5, which equals $100.

So adding all that up: materials are $50, expenses are $10, and labor is $100. Total cost per widget would be 50 + 10 + 100 = $160. Wait, but let me check each option to see which conclusion is valid.

Looking at the options:

Option A says each widget requires $50 in labor for 10 operations. But according to the data, it's 20 operations, so A is wrong.

Option B claims material costs are the smallest fraction. Materials are $50, labor is $100, so materials are half the cost. Wait, but the total is $160, so 50 is a third, not the smallest. Expenses are only $10, which is the smallest. So B is incorrect.

Option C says output is labor intensive. Since labor is the highest cost at $100, which is over 60% of the total, that makes sense. So C could be a valid conclusion.

Option D says material costs are low. Well, $50 is a significant portion, so D might not be correct.

Option E says expenses are greater than materials and labor combined. Materials plus labor is 50 + 100 = 150. Expenses are only $10, so E is wrong.

Option F suggests selling price should be $160. That's the total cost, but the question is about conclusions, not pricing. Plus, the selling price should probably be higher than cost, but the question doesn't give info on profit margins, so F might not be the only valid conclusion.

Option G says the most significant cost is the expense fee. No, labor is the biggest at $100, so G is wrong.

Option H says labor rates are excessive. There's no data to support that; it's just given as $5 per operation, so H isn't necessarily true.

Option I claims total cost is less than $100. But we calculated $160, so I is wrong.

Option J says there are 10 operations at $10 each. No, it's 20 operations at $5 each, so J is incorrect.

So the only valid conclusion seems to be option C: output is labor intensive because labor costs make up the majority of the production cost.

The only valid conclusion is that the output is labor intensive, as labor costs account for the majority of the production cost.

Answer: C
