Okay, so I've got this question about the statute of limitations and a promissory note. Let's break it down. The debtor owed $12,000, and the creditor had until September 30 last year to file a lawsuit. But then, on June 1 of this year, the debtor sent a letter promising to pay $5,000 on July 1 as full satisfaction. However, the debtor didn't pay, and now on August 1, the creditor is suing, and the debtor is using the statute of limitations as a defense.

Hmm, I think the key here is understanding when the statute of limitations period restarts. I remember that if a debtor makes a partial payment or acknowledges the debt, it can reset the statute of limitations. But in this case, the debtor said they'd pay $5,000 "in full satisfaction." So does that mean they're offering a partial payment or actually promising to settle the entire debt?

Wait, "in full satisfaction" suggests that they're offering to pay the $5k and that settles everything. If the debtor had paid $5k, maybe the debt would be considered settled, but since they didn't pay, what happens? Does the promise to pay affect the statute of limitations?

I think that even a promise to pay can restart the SOL if it's a new acknowledgment of the debt. So when the debtor sent the letter on June 1, promising to pay $5k on July 1, that might have reset the statute of limitations. So the creditor now has a new period from that date.

But wait, the original SOL deadline was September 30 last year. If the debtor made a new promise on June 1, the new SOL period would start then. So the creditor would have, say, six years from June 1 to file, but in this case, they're filing on August 1, which is within that period, so the SOL defense wouldn't apply anymore.

But the question is about whether the creditor can get a judgment for the full $12k. If the debtor's promise was to pay $5k in full, and then didn't pay, does that mean the entire debt is still owed? Or does the creditor only get $5k?

Wait, the debtor didn't pay the $5k, so the entire $12k is still owed. But because the debtor made a new promise, the statute of limitations was reset, so the creditor can sue for the full amount.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says on July 1, the creditor is entitled to judgment for $12k. But why July 1? The promise was on June 1, so the reset would happen then, not on July 1 when payment was due.

Option B says on June 1, creditor gets judgment. That doesn't make sense because the payment wasn't due until July 1. The creditor can't get a judgment before the payment is due unless there's a default, which hasn't happened yet.

Option D says on August 1, the creditor becomes entitled. Since August 1 is after the July 1 due date, maybe the creditor can now sue for the full amount because the debtor failed to pay after the SOL was reset.

Wait, but the SOL was reset on June 1, so the creditor had until June 1 plus the SOL period. But in this case, the creditor filed on August 1, which is within the new period, so the SOL isn't a defense anymore. Therefore, the creditor can sue for the full $12k, because the SOL was reset, and the debtor didn't pay, so they're liable for the full amount.

Looking at the options again, option D says on August 1, the creditor became entitled for $12k. But I think the entitlement happens when the debtor failed to pay on July 1, which would be when the creditor could sue for the full amount. So maybe August 1 is when the creditor actually files, but the right to sue for the full amount would be from July 1 when the payment was due.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, because on August 1, the statute of limitations hasn't expired yet because it was reset, so the creditor can sue for the full amount.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A, on July 1, the creditor is entitled. Because once the payment was due and not made, the creditor can sue for the full amount, but the SOL was reset on June 1, so the suit on August 1 is within the new period.

Alternatively, perhaps the promise to pay in full satisfaction didn't work because the debtor didn't pay. So the debt remains for the full $12k, and the SOL was reset on June 1, so the creditor can sue. So the answer would be D: on August 1, entitled for $12k.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option F says on July 1, the creditor became entitled for full $12k due to failure to pay. That makes sense because on July 1, the payment was due, and the debtor didn't pay. So the creditor could sue for the full amount from that point.

But the SOL was reset on June 1, so the creditor had until some date after that. So the creditor can sue on August 1, and the debtor can't use SOL as a defense because the period started on June 1, and August 1 is within that period.

Wait, but the question is about the creditor's rights on August 1. The SOL was reset on June 1, so the creditor can sue for the full amount because the SOL hasn't expired yet. So option D says on August 1, the creditor became entitled for $12k. But I'm a bit confused because the payment was due on July 1, so the creditor could sue then, but the question is about August 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, because on July 1, the payment was due, and the debtor's failure to pay means the creditor can now sue for the full amount. But the SOL was reset on June 1, so the creditor could have sued any time after that.

Wait, but the question states that the creditor brings suit on August 1, so the SOL is not a defense anymore because the period started on June 1, and August 1 is within the new period. Therefore, the creditor can get a judgment for $12k, so the answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, because on July 1, the failure to pay allows the creditor to sue for the full amount, but the SOL was reset on June 1, so the creditor can sue on August 1.

Wait, but the options are about when the creditor became entitled. So on June 1, when the debtor promised to pay, did that restart the SOL, so the creditor could sue from then? Or on July 1, when the payment was due, the creditor could sue.

I think the key is that a new promise to pay can restart the SOL. So on June 1, the SOL period starts anew. So the creditor can sue any time within that new period. Therefore, on August 1, when the creditor sues, the SOL hasn't expired, so the creditor can get a judgment for $12k because the debtor didn't pay the $5k and thus the entire debt remains.

So the correct answer would be D: On August 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment for $12k.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: July 1, entitled for $12k.

B: June 1, entitled for $12k.

C: $5k regardless.

D: August 1, $12k.

E: $7k.

F: July 1, $12k.

G: Not entitled.

H: July 1, $5k.

I: Not entitled.

So based on this, the correct answer is D. Because on August 1, the creditor sues and the SOL has been reset, so they can get the full $12k.

The key issue revolves around the statute of limitations and the effect of the debtor's promise to pay. The original statute of limitations expired on September 30 of last year, but the debtor's letter on June 1, promising to pay $5,000 on July 1 "in full satisfaction," likely reset the statute of limitations. This means the creditor now has a new period to sue, starting from June 1. Since the creditor filed on August 1, which is within this new period, the statute of limitations defense is invalid. Additionally, the debtor's failure to pay the $5,000 on July 1 means the full $12,000 remains owed. Therefore, the creditor is entitled to a judgment for the full $12,000 on August 1.

Answer: D
