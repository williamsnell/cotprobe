Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this question about amortizing a debt. The problem is that a debt of $25,000 is to be amortized over 7 years with a 7% interest rate. I need to find the monthly payment that will achieve this. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I should remember the formula for calculating the monthly payment on an amortized loan. I think it's the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula is:

P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where:
- P is the monthly payment
- r is the monthly interest rate
- PV is the present value, which is the loan amount
- n is the total number of payments

So, let's break down the numbers. The loan amount (PV) is $25,000. The annual interest rate is 7%, so the monthly rate would be 7% divided by 12. That's 0.07 / 12, which is approximately 0.0058333. 

The term is 7 years, so the number of monthly payments (n) is 7 * 12 = 84 months.

Now plug these into the formula. Let me write that out:

P = (0.0058333 * 25,000) / (1 - (1 + 0.0058333)^-84)

Let me calculate the numerator first. 0.0058333 multiplied by 25,000 is:

0.0058333 * 25,000 = 145.8325

So the numerator is approximately $145.83.

Now the denominator is a bit trickier. Let's compute (1 + 0.0058333)^-84. That's the same as 1/(1.0058333)^84.

I might need to use a calculator for this part. Let me think about how to compute (1.0058333)^84. Alternatively, I can use logarithms or recall that the present value annuity factor is a standard calculation. 

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity factor, which is [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r. Wait, but in the formula I used earlier, it's P = (r * PV) / [1 - (1 + r)^-n], so the denominator is [1 - (1 + r)^-n], which is the same as the annuity factor multiplied by r.

So, perhaps it's easier to compute the annuity factor first. Let me compute (1.0058333)^84.

I can approximate this. Let me see: taking natural logs, ln(1.0058333) ≈ 0.005817. Multiply this by 84: 0.005817 * 84 ≈ 0.4896. Then exponentiate: e^0.4896 ≈ 1.6323. So 1/(1.6323) ≈ 0.6128.

Wait, but that would be (1.0058333)^-84 ≈ 0.6128.

So, [1 - 0.6128] = 0.3872.

So the denominator is 0.3872.

So now, P = 145.83 / 0.3872 ≈ 376.14. That can't be right because the options are in the thousands. Wait, I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait a minute, I think I messed up the exponent calculation. Let me double-check. Let me compute (1.0058333)^84 again. Maybe using a different approach.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the monthly payment without getting into exponentials, but maybe I should look for a better way.

Wait, another approach: using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula, which is:

PV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

So, rearranged to solve for P:

P = PV / [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r] = (PV * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

So that's correct. Let me compute (1 + 0.0058333)^84 again more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the present value interest factor of an annuity (PVIFA). PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r.

So, PVIFA = [1 - (1.0058333)^-84] / 0.0058333

But since I don't have a calculator, maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an alternative method or check if I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the exponent. Wait, 7 years is 84 months, so n=84, and r=0.0058333 per month.

Let me try to compute (1.0058333)^84 using logarithms.

ln(1.0058333) ≈ 0.005817 (as before). Multiply by 84: 0.005817 * 84 = 0.4897. So e^0.4897 ≈ e^0.49 ≈ 1.6323, as before. So (1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1.6323. Therefore, (1.0058333)^-84 ≈ 1/1.6323 ≈ 0.6128.

So [1 - 0.6128] = 0.3872.

So denominator is 0.3872.

So P = (25,000 * 0.0058333) / 0.3872 ≈ (145.8325) / 0.3872 ≈ 376.14.

Wait, that's about $376 per month, but the options are all in the thousands. That's way off. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the interest rate. Let me check: 7% annual rate, so monthly rate is 7% / 12, which is 0.07 / 12 ≈ 0.0058333. That's correct.

Wait, but $376 per month over 84 months would be about 376*84 ≈ $31,600, which is less than $25,000. So that can't be right. I must have miscalculated.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the monthly payment using the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0058333)^84. Let me try to calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rule of 78 or another method, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation for (1.0058333)^84.

Wait, let me try to compute (1.0058333)^84 step by step.

We can compute it as:

First, note that (1 + r)^n = e^(n*ln(1+r)).

We have r = 0.0058333, so ln(1.0058333) ≈ 0.005817.

n = 84, so 84 * 0.005817 ≈ 0.4897.

e^0.4897 ≈ 1.6323.

Wait, that's what I had before. So (1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1.6323.

So 1/(1.0058333)^84 ≈ 0.6128.

So [1 - 0.6128] = 0.3872.

So P = (0.0058333 * 25,000) / 0.3872 = 145.8325 / 0.3872 ≈ 376.14.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are all in the thousands, like $3500, $3895, etc.

Wait, maybe I inverted the formula. Let me check the formula again.

The formula is correct: P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n). So I think I did that right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check the exponent again. 7 years at 7% annual rate, so n=84 months, yes. So r=0.0058333 per month.

Wait, but perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me try to compute the monthly payment using another method, perhaps using the Excel PMT function.

The PMT function in Excel is PMT(r, n, PV). So for this case, it would be PMT(7%/12, 84, 25000). Let me try to approximate this.

I can use an online calculator or a financial formula to compute this accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula correctly this time.

Let me compute the denominator again: 1 - (1 + 0.0058333)^-84.

We have (1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1.6323, so 1/(1.6323) ≈ 0.6128.

So 1 - 0.6128 = 0.3872.

So P = (0.0058333 * 25,000) / 0.3872 ≈ 145.8325 / 0.3872 ≈ 376.14.

Wait, that's the same result as before. But the options don't have anything near that. So I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the monthly payment, but the options are in thousands, so maybe I'm miscalculating the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let me try to compute (1.0058333)^84 more accurately.

I can compute this using the formula for compound interest. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 to estimate how many months it takes for the investment to double, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation for (1.0058333)^84.

Let me try to compute it step by step.

We can compute (1.0058333)^84 as follows:

First, note that (1.0058333)^12 ≈ 1 + 0.0725 (approximately, since (1 + 0.0058333)^12 ≈ e^(0.07) ≈ 1.0725). But actually, (1 + 0.07/12)^12 ≈ e^0.07 ≈ 1.0725, which is the effective annual rate. Wait, but here we're dealing with 84 months, which is 7 years.

So, (1.0058333)^84 = [(1.0058333)^12]^7.

We can compute (1.0058333)^12 first.

(1.0058333)^12: Let's compute this.

Using the formula (1 + r)^n, where r=0.0058333 and n=12.

Compute step by step:

1.0058333^1 = 1.0058333

^2: 1.0058333 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0117361

^3: 1.0117361 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0176832

^4: 1.0176832 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0236655

^5: 1.0236655 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0296826

^6: 1.0296826 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0357342

^7: 1.0357342 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0418302

^8: 1.0418302 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0479606

^9: 1.0479606 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0541353

^10: 1.0541353 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0603539

^11: 1.0603539 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0666270

^12: 1.0666270 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0730109

So, (1.0058333)^12 ≈ 1.0730109.

Now, we need to compute (1.0730109)^7.

Let's compute that step by step.

^1: 1.0730109

^2: 1.0730109 * 1.0730109 ≈ 1.1516516

^3: 1.1516516 * 1.0730109 ≈ 1.2345568

^4: 1.2345568 * 1.0730109 ≈ 1.321999

^5: 1.321999 * 1.0730109 ≈ 1.414072

^6: 1.414072 * 1.0730109 ≈ 1.510707

^7: 1.510707 * 1.0730109 ≈ 1.618034

So, (1.0730109)^7 ≈ 1.618034.

Therefore, (1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1.618034.

So, 1/(1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1/1.618034 ≈ 0.617.

So, 1 - 0.617 = 0.383.

Now, P = (0.0058333 * 25,000) / 0.383.

Compute numerator: 0.0058333 * 25,000 = 145.8325.

So, P ≈ 145.8325 / 0.383 ≈ 380.24.

Still, that's around $380 per month, which doesn't match any of the options. There's a problem here because the options are much higher.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the annual payment, not the monthly. But the question says monthly payments, so that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let me check (1.0058333)^84 again.

Another approach: using semi-annual calculations. Wait, no, it's monthly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the present value of annuity formula correctly.

Wait, let me try plugging the numbers into the formula again.

P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

r = 0.07 / 12 = 0.00583333

PV = 25,000

n = 84

So,

P = (0.00583333 * 25,000) / (1 - (1 + 0.00583333)^-84)

We've computed (1.00583333)^84 ≈ 1.618034, so (1.00583333)^-84 ≈ 0.617.

So,

Denominator: 1 - 0.617 = 0.383.

Numerator: 0.00583333 * 25,000 = 145.8333.

So,

P = 145.8333 / 0.383 ≈ 380.24.

Hmm, that's still around $380 per month, which isn't matching any of the options. The options are all in the thousands. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps the loan is $25,000, but the payment is monthly, so over 84 months. Let me compute what the total payments would be at each option and see which one gets closest to paying off $25,000 with interest.

Looking at the options, G is $3,895.67, which seems high. Let me compute the total payments at that rate and see if it's about $25,000.

Wait, but that would be 84 * 3,895.67 ≈ $328,000, which is way too high. That can't be right. So perhaps the options are in thousands, but that doesn't make sense because $3,895 per month is over $46k per year, which is a lot for a $25k loan.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me check again.

Options are:

A: $4925.00

B: 4500.00

C: $4750.00

D: $4333.33

E: $4100.00

F: $3500.00

G: $3895.67

H: 4638.83

I: 5000.00

J: 4800.00

Wait, all these options are in the thousands, which suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the total payment per period, but that can't be right because $4,000 per month is way too high for a $25k loan.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for an annual payment, not a monthly one. But the question clearly states "monthly payments."

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe it's a simple interest loan, but that's unlikely because amortized loans use compound interest.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a loan where the interest is compounded monthly, but the payment is made annually. No, the payment is monthly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the monthly payment using the correct formula, but let me try using an online calculator or a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity:

PV = P * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So, rearranged:

P = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] = (PV * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute (1 + r)^-n more accurately.

Let me try to compute (1.0058333)^84 using logarithms.

Take natural log: ln(1.0058333) ≈ 0.005817.

Multiply by 84: 0.005817 * 84 = 0.4897.

Exponentiate: e^0.4897 ≈ 1.6323.

So, (1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1.6323, so 1/(1.6323) ≈ 0.6128.

So, denominator: 1 - 0.6128 = 0.3872.

P = (25,000 * 0.0058333) / 0.3872 ≈ 145.83 / 0.3872 ≈ 376.14.

Wait, that's the same result again. So, I must be missing something because none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total payment, not the monthly payment. Let's compute the total payment at each option and see which one results in the loan being paid off.

Wait, but that would be time-consuming, and I might not have time for that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the future value approach, but that's not correct because we're dealing with the present value.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the loan is $25,000, but the payment is monthly, so perhaps the correct payment is around $460 per month. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the exponent. Let me try to compute (1.0058333)^84 using a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 78 to estimate, but that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the monthly payment as:

P = (P * r * (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Wait, perhaps I should use a financial calculator approach.

Let me try to compute the present value interest factor (PVIFA) for 84 months at 0.0058333.

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

So, [1 - (1.0058333)^-84 ] / 0.0058333

We have (1.0058333)^-84 ≈ 0.6128

So, 1 - 0.6128 = 0.3872

Divide by 0.0058333: 0.3872 / 0.0058333 ≈ 66.379

So, PVIFA ≈ 66.379

Then, P = PV / PVIFA = 25,000 / 66.379 ≈ 376.14.

Again, same result. So, I must be missing something because the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for an annual payment instead of monthly. Let me check.

If it's an annual payment, n=7, r=0.07.

Then, P = (0.07 * 25,000) / (1 - (1.07)^-7 )

Compute denominator:

(1.07)^7 ≈ 1.6057

So, 1/(1.6057) ≈ 0.6227.

1 - 0.6227 = 0.3773.

Numerator: 0.07 * 25,000 = 1,750.

So, P = 1,750 / 0.3773 ≈ 4,638.83.

Looking at the options, H is 4638.83, which would be the annual payment. But the question specifies monthly payments, so that can't be the answer.

But the options include H: 4638.83, which would be the annual payment. So, perhaps the question had a typo, or I'm misreading it.

Wait, but the options are all in thousands, so perhaps the correct monthly payment is around $4638.83 divided by 12, which is approximately $386.57, which is close to my earlier calculation of $376.14. But again, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the interest rate is 7% annual, but compounded monthly, and the payments are monthly. So, perhaps the formula is correct, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the monthly payment using the formula and then see which option it matches when rounded.

P = (0.0058333 * 25,000) / (1 - (1.0058333)^-84 )

As calculated, P ≈ 376.14. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0058333)^84. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, (1.0058333)^84.

Compute step by step:

Let me use the formula for compound interest:

A = P*(1 + r)^n

Where P=1, r=0.0058333, n=84.

So, A = 1*(1.0058333)^84.

I can compute this using logarithms:

ln(1.0058333) ≈ 0.005817

Multiply by 84: 0.005817 * 84 ≈ 0.4897

Exponentiate: e^0.4897 ≈ 1.6323

So, (1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1.6323

Thus, 1/(1.6323) ≈ 0.6128

So, 1 - 0.6128 = 0.3872

P = (25,000 * 0.0058333) / 0.3872 ≈ 145.83 / 0.3872 ≈ 376.14.

Same result again. So, I'm confident that the monthly payment is approximately $376.14, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the loan is $250,000 instead of $25,000. Let me check that.

If PV were $250,000, then P = (0.0058333 * 250,000) / 0.3872 ≈ 1458.33 / 0.3872 ≈ 3,761.4.

Which is close to option G: $3,895.67, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, but the question states $25,000, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest rate is 7% per month, which would be 840% annually, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of periods. 7 years is 84 months, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about an annuity due, but that would change the formula slightly.

Wait, for an annuity due, the formula is:

P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n) * (1 + r)

But that would increase the payment by a factor of (1 + r), which is about 0.0058333, so 376.14 * 1.0058333 ≈ 378.36, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is about a simple interest loan, not compound interest. Let me try that.

In simple interest, the formula for the monthly payment is:

P = (PV * r * (1 + r * n)) / (12 * (1 + r * n))

Wait, no, that's not correct. For simple interest, the payment is calculated as:

Total interest = PV * r * t, where t is time in years.

Total amount = PV + interest.

Number of payments = 84.

So, P = (PV + PV*r*t) / 84

Where t=7 years.

So, total interest = 25,000 * 0.07 *7 = 25,000 * 0.49 = 12,250.

Total amount = 25,000 + 12,250 = 37,250.

P = 37,250 / 84 ≈ 443.33.

Still, that's around $443 per month, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, but the options are much higher. So, perhaps the question intended to ask for the annual payment instead.

If I compute the annual payment using the same formula, with n=7, r=0.07.

P = (0.07 * 25,000) / (1 - (1.07)^-7 )

(1.07)^7 ≈ 1.6057

1/(1.6057) ≈ 0.6227

1 - 0.6227 = 0.3773

P = (1,750) / 0.3773 ≈ 4,638.83.

Which is option H: 4638.83.

But the question specifies monthly payments, so this can't be the answer. However, given that the options don't include the correct monthly payment, perhaps the intended answer is H, but that would be for annual payments.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for monthly payments, and perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interest rate is compounded annually, but that would be unusual for a 7-year loan.

Wait, if the interest is compounded annually, then the monthly payment formula would be different. Let me try that.

If interest is compounded annually, then the effective annual rate is 7%, and the monthly payment can be calculated using the present value of an ordinary annuity with annual compounding.

So, in that case, the formula would be:

P = (PV * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Where r=0.07, n=7.

So,

P = (25,000 * 0.07) / (1 - (1.07)^-7 )

(1.07)^7 ≈ 1.6057

So, 1/(1.6057) ≈ 0.6227

1 - 0.6227 = 0.3773

P = 1,750 / 0.3773 ≈ 4,638.83.

Which is the same as the annual payment I calculated earlier, which is option H.

But the question specifies monthly payments, so this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to ask for the annual payment, and the correct answer is H: 4638.83.

But the question clearly says monthly payments, so that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me check a reference.

Upon checking, the formula for the monthly payment is indeed P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ), so I think I did that correctly.

Given that, I'm confident that the monthly payment is approximately $376.14, but that's not among the options. So perhaps the question has an error, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the loan amount is $250,000 instead of $25,000. Let me check that.

If PV = $250,000,

P = (0.0058333 * 250,000) / 0.3872 ≈ (1,458.33) / 0.3872 ≈ 3,761.4.

Looking at the options, G is $3,895.67, which is close but not exact. Perhaps due to rounding differences.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: $3,895.67.

But the question says $25,000, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G: $3,895.67, but that would be for a much larger loan. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the monthly payment using the correct formula and see.

Given that, I think the correct monthly payment is approximately $376, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G: $3,895.67, but that would be for a much larger loan amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the annual payment, in which case the answer is H: 4638.83.

But the question specifies monthly payments, so I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the monthly interest rate is 7% / 12, which is approximately 0.0058333, which I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ), which I did.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately $376 per month, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is incorrect.

But given the options, perhaps the closest is G: $3,895.67, but that would be for a much larger loan.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I'm using the correct number of periods.

Wait, 7 years is 84 months, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a balloon payment, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a loan where the interest is simple, but that would give a higher payment than compound interest.

Wait, with simple interest, the total interest is 25,000 * 0.07 *7 = 12,250, total amount 37,250, so monthly payment 37,250 /84 ≈ 443.33.

Which is still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to say 7% per annum, compounded monthly, and the payment is monthly, but the options are wrong.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is G: $3,895.67, but that would be for a loan amount of approximately $250,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are in thousands, so perhaps the correct answer is G: $3,895.67, but that would be for a 7% annual rate on a larger loan.

But given that, I think the correct answer must be G: $3,895.67, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the monthly payment as:

P = [Pv * i * (1 + i)^n] / [(1 + i)^n - 1]

Where i is the monthly rate.

So,

P = [25,000 * 0.0058333 * (1.0058333)^84 ] / [ (1.0058333)^84 - 1 ]

We have (1.0058333)^84 ≈ 1.6323.

So,

Numerator: 25,000 * 0.0058333 * 1.6323 ≈ 25,000 * 0.009527 ≈ 238.175.

Denominator: 1.6323 - 1 = 0.6323.

So,

P ≈ 238.175 / 0.6323 ≈ 376.14.

Same result again. So, I'm confident that the correct monthly payment is approximately $376.14.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the question intended to ask for the annual payment, which would be H: 4638.83.

But given that, I'm unsure. However, perhaps the correct answer is G: $3,895.67, but that doesn't align with the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option G is $3,895.67, which is close to $3,761.4 that I calculated for a $250,000 loan. So perhaps the question had a typo, and the loan amount is $250,000, making the correct answer G.

But the question states $25,000, so I'm confused.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is not listed, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is G: $3,895.67, but I'm not certain.

The question involves calculating the monthly payment for amortizing a $25,000 loan over 7 years at a 7% annual interest rate. The formula for the monthly payment is:

\[
P = \frac{r \cdot PV}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
\]

Where:
- \( r = \frac{0.07}{12} \approx 0.0058333 \) (monthly interest rate),
- \( PV = 25,000 \) (loan amount),
- \( n = 7 \times 12 = 84 \) (total number of monthly payments).

### Step 1: Calculate the numerator
\[
r \cdot PV = 0.0058333 \cdot 25,000 \approx 145.83
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
\[
(1 + r)^{-n} = (1.0058333)^{-84} \approx 0.6128
\]
\[
1 - 0.6128 = 0.3872
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment
\[
P = \frac{145.83}{0.3872} \approx 376.14
\]

This result, approximately $376.14, does not match any of the provided options. The options are all in the thousands, suggesting a possible misunderstanding or error in the question. If the payment were annual instead of monthly, the calculation would yield approximately $4,638.83, which corresponds to option **H**. However, the question specifies monthly payments.

Given the discrepancy, the most plausible explanation is that the question intended to ask for the annual payment, making the correct answer **H: 4638.83**.
