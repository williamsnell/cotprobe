Okay, so I've got this question about collision insurance deductibles and how much the insurance would pay out in two different scenarios. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a deductible is. From what I remember, a deductible is the amount the insured person has to pay out of pocket before the insurance kicks in. So, if you have a $100 deductible, you pay the first $100 of the repair bill, and the insurance covers the rest. But wait, I think I should double-check that. Oh right, yes, that's correct. So the insurance doesn't pay anything until the deductible is met.

Alright, the first part of the question is about a $100-deductible policy. The repair bill is $89.90. Let me calculate how much the insurance would pay. Since the deductible is $100 and the bill is only $89.90, which is less than the deductible, the insurance wouldn't pay anything. The policyholder would have to cover the entire $89.90 themselves. So for the first scenario, the insurance pays $0.

Now, the second part of the question is a bit trickier. It's about a $50-deductible policy with a repair bill of $76.40. Again, I need to compare the bill to the deductible. The bill is $76.40, and the deductible is $50. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the deductible is the amount you pay before insurance starts paying. But here, the bill is $76.40, which is more than the deductible of $50. Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. Oh no, I think I made a mistake. If the bill is $76.40 and the deductible is $50, the policyholder pays the first $50, and the insurance covers the rest. So the insurance would pay $76.40 minus $50, which is $26.40. So the insurance would pay $26.40.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. The first scenario: $89.90 repair, $100 deductible. Since 89.90 < 100, the insurance pays nothing. That's correct.

Second scenario: $76.40 repair, $50 deductible. Since 76.40 is more than 50, the policyholder pays the first $50. So the insurance pays 76.40 - 50 = $26.40.

So looking at the options, I need to find which option has $0 for the first part and $26.40 for the second. Let's look at the options:

Option A: $0 and $26.40. That matches my calculation.

Option B: $10.10 and $0. No, because the first scenario should be $0, and the second should be $26.40.

Option C: $0 and $76.40. No, because the insurance only pays the part after the deductible, not the whole bill.

Option E: $39.90 and $26.40. Hmm, where would $39.90 come from? Maybe if the deductible was 100 and the bill was 140, then 140-100=40, but no, in the first case, the bill is 89.90, which is under 100.

Option G: $10.10 and $26.40. Where would $10.10 come from? Maybe if the deductible was 90 and the bill was 89.90, but no, the first scenario has a 100 deductible.

So the correct answer should be Option A: $0 and $26.40.

The insurance pays $0 for the first scenario because the repair bill is less than the deductible. For the second scenario, the insurance pays the amount after the deductible is met, which is $26.40.
