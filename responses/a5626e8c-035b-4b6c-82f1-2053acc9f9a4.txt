Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about alpha particles being deflected by a gold foil. Hmm, I remember something about Rutherford's gold foil experiment from my classes. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the fraction of 7.7-MeV alpha particles that get deflected at an angle of 90 degrees or more when they hit a gold foil that's 10^-6 meters thick. The options are all pretty small numbers, like 5e-05 and so on. So it's a small fraction, which makes sense because I think most alpha particles don't get deflected much, right?

First, I need to recall the formula for the deflection angle of alpha particles. I remember that the deflection angle depends on the distance of closest approach of the alpha particle to the nucleus. The formula for the distance of closest approach (r_min) is given by:

r_min = (Z² * e^4) / (4 * π² * ε₀² * m * v² * b²)

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, another approach is using conservation of energy and the coulomb potential. The alpha particle's kinetic energy is converted into electric potential energy at the point of closest approach.

The kinetic energy (K) of the alpha particle is given as 7.7 MeV. I should convert that into joules to use in the equations, but maybe I can work with it in eV for now since the constants might have eV units.

The electric potential energy at closest approach (U) is given by U = (k * e²) / r_min, where k is Coulomb's constant, e is the elementary charge, and r_min is the distance of closest approach.

At the point of closest approach, all the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, so K = U. So,

K = (k * e²) / r_min

Solving for r_min gives:

r_min = (k * e²) / K

Now, I need to compute this. Let's plug in the numbers. K is 7.7 MeV, which is 7.7e6 eV. Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². The elementary charge e is 1.602e-19 C.

Calculating r_min:

r_min = (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2) / (7.7e6 * 1.602e-19)

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate more carefully.

First, compute e²: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Then, k*e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 2.307e-28 N·m².

Now, K is 7.7 MeV. Converting that to joules: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 7.7e6 eV is 7.7e6 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.2335e-12 J.

So, r_min = (2.307e-28) / (1.2335e-12) ≈ 1.87e-16 meters. That's on the order of 1e-15 meters, which is femtometers, which makes sense because atomic nuclei are around that size. Wait, gold has a higher atomic number, so maybe that affects it.

Wait, no, in the formula for r_min, the atomic number Z comes in. Oh right, because the alpha particle is approaching a gold nucleus, which has Z=79. So earlier, I think I missed the Z factor. The correct formula should be:

r_min = (Z² * k * e²) / (K * e), wait no, let me think again.

Wait, no. The potential energy is (Z * e) * (e) / r_min, because the nucleus has charge Z*e and the alpha has charge 2e (since it's a helium nucleus). So the potential energy is (Z * e * 2e) / (4πε₀ r_min) )

Wait, no, the Coulomb force is k*(Z*e)*(e)/(r_min), but wait, the alpha has charge +2e, so it's k*(Z*e)*(2e)/r_min.

Wait, maybe I should write it properly. The potential energy is U = (k * Z * e * 2e) / r_min. So U = (2k Z e²) / r_min.

But earlier, I had set K = U, so K = (2k Z e²) / r_min.

So solving for r_min: r_min = (2k Z e²) / K.

Wait, that makes sense because a higher Z would mean a smaller r_min, so more deflection.

So plugging in the numbers again: Z for gold is 79.

So,

r_min = (2 * 8.988e9 * 79 * (1.602e-19)^2) / (7.7e6 * 1.602e-19)

Let me compute each part.

First, compute numerator: 2 * 8.988e9 *79 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Then, 2 *8.988e9 = 1.7976e10.

Multiply by 79: 1.7976e10 *79 ≈ 1.417e12.

Then multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.417e12 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 3.637e-26.

Denominator: 7.7e6 * 1.602e-19 = 1.2335e-12.

So r_min = 3.637e-26 / 1.2335e-12 ≈ 2.946e-14 meters. Hmm, that's about 2.946e-14 m, which is 29.46 femtometers. Wait, that seems a bit large, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent calculations. Let me double-check:

Wait, 7.7e6 eV is correct? Because 7.7 MeV is 7.7e6 eV. So when I converted to joules, 7.7e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 7.7e6 *1.602e-19 = let's compute that: 7.7 *1.602 = ~12.335, and 1e6 *1e-19 = 1e-13. So 12.335e-13 J, which is 1.2335e-12 J. That part is correct.

Now, numerator: 2 *8.988e9 = 1.7976e10.

Multiply by Z=79: 1.7976e10 *79 ≈ 1.417e12.

Multiply by e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 1.417e12 * 2.566e-38 = 3.637e-26.

Then, denominator is K in joules: 1.2335e-12 J.

So r_min = 3.637e-26 / 1.2335e-12 ≈ 2.946e-14 m. Okay, that's correct.

Now, the next step is to find the number of alpha particles that get deflected by 90 degrees or more. I remember that the deflection angle depends on the impact parameter (b), which is the perpendicular distance from the nucleus when the alpha particle approaches.

The formula for the maximum angle of deflection (θ) is given by tan(θ/2) = (e^2)/(2 b r_min K), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, another approach is to use the relation between the impact parameter and the deflection angle.

Alternatively, I think the formula is tan(θ/2) = (e^2)/(4 π ε_0 b r_min m v^2). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula for the deflection angle comes from the conservation of momentum and energy. The maximum angle occurs when the impact parameter is such that the kinetic energy just equals the potential energy needed for that angle. Alternatively, I think the formula for the maximum angle θ is given by:

sin(θ/2) = (e^2 Z) / (4 π ε_0 b K)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, another approach is to use the impact parameter formula. For a deflection to θ, the impact parameter b is given by:

b = (e^2 Z) / (4 π ε_0 K (1 + cos θ))

Wait, I think that's the correct formula. Let me check: for θ = 180 degrees, cos θ = -1, so denominator becomes zero, which makes sense because the particle would have to pass very close, which requires a very small b, which is impossible, so it can't be deflected 180 degrees by a nucleus. For θ=90 degrees, cos θ = 0, so denominator is 1, so b = (e² Z)/(4 π ε_0 K).

Wait, that makes sense. So for θ=90 degrees, the impact parameter b_90 is:

b_90 = (e^2 Z) / (4 π ε_0 K)

But wait, I think I'm missing a factor. Let me make sure.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

b = (e^2 Z) / (4 π ε_0 K (1 + cos θ))

Yes, I think that's right. So for θ=90 degrees, cos θ = 0, so b_90 = (e² Z)/(4 π ε_0 K)

So plugging in the numbers, we can find b_90.

But wait, I'm using K in joules here, right? Because the formula uses energy in joules.

So K = 7.7 MeV = 7.7e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.2335e-12 J.

Z=79.

e=1.602e-19 C.

ε_0 = 8.854e-12 F/m.

So,

b_90 = ( (1.602e-19)^2 * 79 ) / (4 * π * 8.854e-12 * 1.2335e-12 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38. Multiply by 79: 2.566e-38 *79 ≈ 2.021e-36.

Denominator: 4 * π *8.854e-12 *1.2335e-12.

Compute 4 * π ≈ 12.566.

12.566 *8.854e-12 ≈ 1.112e-10.

Then multiply by 1.2335e-12: 1.112e-10 *1.2335e-12 ≈ 1.372e-22.

So,

b_90 = 2.021e-36 / 1.372e-22 ≈ 1.47e-14 meters.

So any alpha particles with impact parameter less than or equal to b_90 will be deflected by 90 degrees or more.

But wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the denominator calculation. Let me recalculate that more carefully.

Denominator:

4 * π * ε_0 * K

= 4 * π * 8.854e-12 F/m * 1.2335e-12 J.

Wait, 8.854e-12 F/m is the same as 8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²).

So units would be C²/(N·m²) * J (which is N·m) → C²/(N·m²) * N·m = C²/(m).

Wait, maybe I should just compute the numerical value.

4 * π ≈ 12.566.

12.566 *8.854e-12 ≈ 12.566 *8.854 ≈ 111.2, so 111.2e-12 = 1.112e-10.

Multiply by K=1.2335e-12:

1.112e-10 * 1.2335e-12 ≈ (1.112 * 1.2335) e-22 ≈ 1.372e-22.

So denominator is 1.372e-22.

Numerator is 2.021e-36.

So b_90 ≈ 2.021e-36 / 1.372e-22 ≈ 1.47e-14 m.

So impact parameter must be less than or equal to 1.47e-14 m for deflection of 90 degrees or more.

Now, the next step is to find how many alpha particles have impact parameters less than or equal to b_90. The foil's thickness is given as 10^-6 meters. So the number of gold nuclei that an alpha particle could encounter depends on the thickness and the density of the foil.

So the number of nuclei per unit area (n) is given by the thickness (t) multiplied by the number density (N/V), where V is the volume per nucleus.

Wait, alternatively, the number density N/V is Avogadro's number multiplied by the molar mass divided by the volume per mole. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of gold atoms per unit area that the alpha particles pass through.

The thickness of the foil is t=1e-6 m. Let me find the number of gold atoms per square meter in the foil.

The density of gold is about 19.3 g/cm³. Let me convert that to kg/m³: 19.3 g/cm³ = 19.3e3 kg/m³.

The molar mass of gold is about 197 g/mol, which is 0.197 kg/mol.

So the number of moles per cubic meter is density / molar mass = 19.3e3 kg/m³ / 0.197 kg/mol ≈ 98,020 mol/m³.

Each mole has Avogadro's number of atoms, which is 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So number of atoms per cubic meter is 98,020 mol/m³ *6.022e23 atoms/mol ≈ 5.90e28 atoms/m³.

Now, the number of atoms per square meter (n) in the thickness t is (number per m³) multiplied by t (meters), so:

n = 5.90e28 atoms/m³ * 1e-6 m = 5.90e22 atoms/m².

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me double-check.

Wait, 1e-6 m is 1 micrometer. So the number per square meter is 5.9e28 * 1e-6 = 5.9e22 atoms/m². Yes.

Now, the target thickness is 1e-6 m, and the number of nuclei per area is 5.90e22 atoms/m².

Each alpha particle will pass through this many nuclei.

The differential scattering cross-section (σ) for an alpha particle to be deflected by at least 90 degrees is given by the Rutherford scattering formula. The Rutherford scattering differential cross-section is:

dσ/dΩ = (e^4)/(4 ε_0^2 h^2) * (1/(sin^4(θ/2))) * (Z^4)/(b^2)

Wait, no, I think another form is more useful. Alternatively, the Rutherford scattering formula for the differential cross-section is:

dσ/dθ = ( (e^4 Z^4 ) / (4 ε_0^2 h^2) ) * (1/(sin^4(θ/2)) )

But perhaps I can find the total cross-section for angles ≥90 degrees. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the impact parameter b that corresponds to θ=90 degrees and then use that to find the fraction.

Wait, earlier I found that the impact parameter for θ=90 is b_90 ≈1.47e-14 m.

The maximum impact parameter that would cause a deflection of 90 degrees or more is b ≤ b_90. So the cross-section σ is the area around each nucleus where an alpha particle would be deflected by 90 degrees or more. So σ = π * (b_90)^2.

Wait, but wait, since the alpha particles are coming from a direction, the effective cross-section per nucleus is π b_90^2. So the total cross-section is the number of nuclei times the cross-section per nucleus.

Wait, no, the cross-section per nucleus is π b_90^2, and the number of nuclei per unit area is n (5.9e22/m²). So the total scattering cross-section per unit area (σ_total) is n * π b_90^2.

But wait, the total number of alpha particles that scatter is given by the product of the flux (number per area) and the cross-section. Alternatively, since all alpha particles are going through the same area, the fraction that scatters is (σ_per_nucleus * n) / (1), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think it's better to model it as the probability per nucleus. The probability that an alpha particle is deflected by 90 degrees or more by a single nucleus is (π b_90^2)/(4π r^2), but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the impact parameter.

Wait, no, for a single nucleus, the cross-section for scattering is π b_max^2, where b_max is the maximum impact parameter that leads to the desired deflection (here, b_90). So the cross-section per nucleus is σ = π * (1.47e-14 m)^2 ≈ π * (2.16e-28 m²) ≈ 6.79e-28 m².

Then, the number of nuclei per unit area is 5.9e22 nuclei/m².

So the total cross-section per unit area is 5.9e22 * 6.79e-28 m² ≈ 4.0e-5 m².

Wait, but the total area is 1 m², so the number of alpha particles that are deflected is the total cross-section times the number of alpha particles per unit area. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, the fraction of alpha particles that are deflected by 90 degrees or more is given by the product of the number of gold nuclei per unit area and the cross-section per nucleus for scattering at 90 degrees or more.

So fraction f = n * σ = n * π b_90^2.

So,

n = 5.9e22 nuclei/m².

σ = π * (1.47e-14)^2 ≈ 6.79e-28 m².

So,

f = 5.9e22 * 6.79e-28 ≈ 4.0e-5.

Which is 4.0e-5, which corresponds to option B: 4e-05.

Wait, that's one of the options. So the answer would be option B.

To determine the fraction of 7.7-MeV alpha particles deflected at an angle of 90° or more by a gold foil of thickness \( t = 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy and Distance of Closest Approach**:
   - The kinetic energy of the alpha particle is \( K = 7.7 \, \text{MeV} = 7.7 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \).
   - Using energy conservation, the distance of closest approach (\( r_{\text{min}} \)) is calculated as:
     \[
     r_{\text{min}} = \frac{2 k Z e^2}{K}
     \]
     where \( Z = 79 \) (gold's atomic number), \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \). Substituting the values:
     \[
     r_{\text{min}} \approx 2.946 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{m}.
     \]

2. **Impact Parameter for 90° Deflection**:
   - The impact parameter (\( b_{90} \)) corresponding to a 90° deflection is given by:
     \[
     b_{90} = \frac{e^2 Z}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 K}.
     \]
     Substituting \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \) and \( K = 1.2335 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J} \), we find:
     \[
     b_{90} \approx 1.47 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{m}.
     \]

3. **Number of Gold Nuclei per Unit Area**:
   - The density of gold is \( \rho = 19.3 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 19.3 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), and its molar mass is \( M = 0.197 \, \text{kg/mol} \). The number density of gold nuclei is:
     \[
     n_{\text{atoms}} = \frac{\rho}{M} \times N_A \approx 5.9 \times 10^{28} \, \text{atoms/m}^3,
     \]
     where \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \) is Avogadro's number.

   - The number of nuclei per unit area (\( n \)) in the foil is:
     \[
     n = n_{\text{atoms}} \times t = 5.9 \times 10^{28} \times 10^{-6} \approx 5.9 \times 10^{22} \, \text{atoms/m}^2.
     \]

4. **Fraction of Deflected Particles**:
   - The cross-section for scattering at 90° or more is \( \sigma = \pi b_{90}^2 \). Substituting \( b_{90} \):
     \[
     \sigma \approx \pi (1.47 \times 10^{-14})^2 \approx 6.79 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{m}^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of alpha particles deflected is:
     \[
     f = n \times \sigma = 5.9 \times 10^{22} \times 6.79 \times 10^{-28} \approx 4.0 \times 10^{-5}.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The fraction of 7.7-MeV alpha particles deflected at 90° or more is approximately \( 4.0 \times 10^{-5} \), corresponding to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
