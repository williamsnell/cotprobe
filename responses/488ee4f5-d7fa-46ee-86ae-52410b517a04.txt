Okay, so I've got this question about real GDP per capita growth and how long it takes for the standard of living to double. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that real GDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output per person. When this grows, it generally means that the average person's income is increasing, which is linked to an improvement in their standard of living.

The question says that real GDP per capita is growing at a rate of 10 percent per year. I remember there's a rule related to growth rates and doubling time. I think it's called the Rule of 72 or something like that. Let me recall: the Rule of 72 is a quick way to estimate how long it takes for an investment to double, given a fixed annual rate of interest. You divide 72 by the annual growth rate percentage to get the approximate number of years.

So, applying that here, the growth rate is 10%. Using the Rule of 72, I would calculate 72 divided by 10. Let me do that: 72 / 10 equals 7.2. Hmm, so that would be approximately 7.2 years. But looking at the options, I don't see 7.2 directly. The closest options are G:7 years and E:5 years. Wait, option G is 7 years, which is pretty close to 7.2.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm applying the right concept here. The standard of living is directly related to real GDP per capita, so if that's growing at 10% annually, the doubling time should be the same as using the Rule of 72. So 72 divided by 10 is indeed 7.2 years. So the answer should be around 7 years. Looking back at the options, G is 7 years, which seems correct.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. Let's say the initial GDP per capita is X. After one year, it's X * 1.10. After two years, it's X * (1.10)^2, and so on. We want to find the time 't' when it's equal to 2X. So, 1.10^t = 2.

To solve for t, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(1.10^t) = ln(2). That simplifies to t * ln(1.10) = ln(2). So t = ln(2) / ln(1.10).

Calculating that, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, and ln(1.10) is about 0.0953. Dividing 0.6931 by 0.0953 gives roughly 7.27 years. That's consistent with the Rule of 72 estimate. So again, that's about 7.27 years, which rounds to 7 years.

Looking at the options, option G is 7 years. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: 7 years.
