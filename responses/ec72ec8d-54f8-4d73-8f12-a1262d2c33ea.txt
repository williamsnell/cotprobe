Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 1 electronvolt (eV). Hmm, de Broglie wavelength... I remember that's the wavelength associated with a particle, calculated using its momentum. The formula is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum.

First, I need to find the momentum of the electron. But wait, the kinetic energy is given in eV, and I think I need to convert that into joules to work with standard units. I'm pretty sure 1 eV equals 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 1 eV would be 1.602e-19 J.

The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle is related to its momentum by the equation KE = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So I can rearrange this to solve for p. Let me write that down: p = sqrt(2 * m * KE).

The mass of an electron is about 9.109 x 10^-31 kilograms. So plugging in the numbers, KE is 1.602e-19 J. Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate 2 * m * KE. So 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-19 J. Let's do the multiplication: 9.109e-31 times 1.602e-19 is approximately 1.458e-49. Then multiply by 2, which gives 2.916e-49 kg²·J⁻¹. Hmm, but wait, I need to take the square root of that to find p.

Wait, no, wait a second. The formula is p² = 2mKE, so p is sqrt(2mKE). So let me compute 2mKE first. 2 * 9.109e-31 kg is about 1.8218e-30 kg. Multiply by 1.602e-19 J gives 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-19 = let's see, 1.8218 * 1.602 is roughly 2.918, so 2.918e-49 kg·J. But KE is in joules, which is kg·m²/s², so the units would be kg²·m²/s²? Wait, maybe I should double-check the units here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the momentum in terms of eV and known constants.

Alternatively, I've heard that there's a shortcut formula for the de Broglie wavelength when the kinetic energy is given in eV. I think the formula is λ (in angstroms) = 12.3 / sqrt(K.E. in eV). Wait, that sounds familiar. So for 1 eV, that would be 12.3 / 1 = 12.3 angstroms. But wait, that seems way too big because I remember electrons having much smaller wavelengths.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. Oh, wait, another approach. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The mass of the electron m is 9.11e-31 kg. The de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p, and p can be found from KE = p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mKE).

So let's compute p:

p = sqrt(2 * m * KE)
KE in joules is 1.602e-19 J.
So 2 * m * KE = 2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 1.602e-19 J = 2 * (9.11 * 1.602)e-50 = 2 * 14.58e-50 = 29.16e-50 = 2.916e-49 kg²·m²/s²? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the units. Let's just compute the numerical value.

2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-19 gives 1.822e-30 * 1.602e-19. Let's compute 1.822 * 1.602 ≈ 2.918, so 2.918e-49. So p = sqrt(2.918e-49) ≈ 5.4e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Oh, wait, 2.918e-49 inside the square root. The square root of 2.918e-49 is approximately 5.4e-25 kg·m/s. So p ≈ 5.4e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, λ = h / p. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So λ = 6.626e-34 / 5.4e-25.

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 / 5.4e-25 ≈ (6.626 /5.4 )e-9 ≈ 1.227e-9 meters. To convert that to centimeters, multiply by 100: 1.227e-7 cm. So λ ≈ 1.227e-7 cm.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.23 × 10^-7 cm. That matches closely. Alternatively, let me check the other options. Option A is 2.48e-8 cm, which is smaller. Option C is 8.66e-6 cm, which is larger. So option G seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Another approach: using the formula λ (in angstroms) ≈ 12.3 / sqrt(KE in eV). So for 1 eV, λ ≈ 12.3 / 1 = 12.3 angstroms. But 1 angstrom is 1e-8 cm, so 12.3 angstroms is 12.3e-8 cm or 1.23e-7 cm, which matches option G.

So yes, the correct answer should be G: 1.23 × 10^-7 cm.

The de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 1 eV is calculated using the formula λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the electron. The kinetic energy in joules is converted from 1 eV to 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J. Using the relationship KE = p²/(2m), the momentum p is found to be approximately 5.4 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s. Substituting into the de Broglie formula, λ ≈ 1.23 × 10⁻⁷ cm. This matches option G.
