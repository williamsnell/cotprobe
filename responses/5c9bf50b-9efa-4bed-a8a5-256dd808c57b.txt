Okay, so I have this physics question here about magnetic field lines around a current-carrying wire. Hmm, I remember studying something about this. Let me think. I think when you have a straight current-carrying wire, the magnetic field around it forms circles. Like, the field lines are circular because the magnetic field circles around the wire. 

Wait, why circles? Oh right, because of the right-hand rule. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines, which should be circular around the wire. So the field lines aren't straight or radial; they loop around. 

Looking at the options, option H is circles, which makes sense. Let me make sure I'm not confusing this with anything else. Sometimes I get mixed up between electric fields and magnetic fields. Electric field lines from a point charge are radial, but magnetic fields from a wire are different. 

So the other options: A is radial lines, which is for electric fields, not magnetic. B and G are squares and ellipses, which don't sound right. C is spirals, maybe if there's another influence like a magnetic field present, but the question is just about a wire with current. D is eddy currents, which are induced currents, not the field lines themselves. E is hexagons, that's unusual and I don't think that's correct. F is straight lines, which would be if the field was uniform, but around a wire, it's circular. I is energy loops, which isn't a term I recall for field lines. J is triangles, which doesn't make sense here.

Yeah, so the correct answer must be H: circles.

The magnetic field lines around a current-carrying wire form circles due to the circular nature of the magnetic field around the wire, as determined by the right-hand rule. 

Answer: H
