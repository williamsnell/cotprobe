Okay, so I have this question about rheumatoid arthritis, and I need to figure out which of the options A to J is correct. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I know about rheumatoid arthritis.

First, I know that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. It primarily affects the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and swelling. It's a chronic condition, so it lasts a long time.

Option A: It is always associated with psoriasis. Hmm, I think psoriasis is a different condition. Psoriasis is a skin condition with scaly patches, and psoriatic arthritis is a related arthritis. But RA isn't always associated with psoriasis. Some people with RA might have it, but it's not a given. So A might not be correct.

Option B: It is caused by deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints. Wait, that sounds familiar. Uric acid crystals in joints cause gout, not RA. RA is autoimmune, so B is incorrect.

Option C: It is an example of an oligoarthropathy. Oligoarthropathy means it affects few joints, usually 1-5. RA, on the other hand, is typically a polyarthropathy, affecting many joints, especially symmetrically in hands and feet. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Heberden's nodes are a feature. Heberden's nodes are bony enlargements in the joints of the fingers, often seen in osteoarthritis, particularly in the distal interphalangeal joints. RA can cause joint deformities, but Heberden's nodes are more specific to osteoarthritis. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases. Wait, I thought that rheumatoid factor (RF) is a blood test used to help diagnose RA, but not everyone with RA has it. However, I think the presence is higher than 25%. From what I remember, about 70-80% of RA patients have positive RF. So E might be incorrect because 25% seems too low.

Option F: It is a non-inflammatory condition. No, RA is definitely inflammatory. The inflammation leads to the joint damage and symptoms. So F is wrong.

Option G: High levels of calcium in the blood is a common symptom. High calcium (hypercalcemia) isn't typically associated with RA. In fact, RA might sometimes be associated with low calcium due to medications like steroids, but that's not a common symptom. So G is incorrect.

Option H: It is a type of infectious arthritis. RA isn't caused by an infection. Infectious arthritis is usually due to bacteria or viruses, whereas RA is autoimmune. So H is wrong.

Option I: It predominantly affects the lower limbs. RA usually affects the hands and feet more than the lower limbs. Lower limbs might get affected, but it's more symmetric and involves the small joints. So I think I is incorrect.

Option J: Anaemia is a common finding. I remember that anemia is common in RA patients. It's thought to be related to chronic inflammation and possibly nutritional factors. So J seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The correct answer should be J. But let me think again about each point.

Rheumatoid factor presence: I think in RA, about 80% of people test positive. So E says 25%, which is too low. So E is incorrect.

Heberden's nodes are more about osteoarthritis, so D is wrong.

Anaemia is common, so J is correct.

So the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J: Anaemia is a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis.

Answer: J
