Question:

Which of the following is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns (i.e. log-returns)?

Options:

A: They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices
B: They can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods
C: They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns
D: They are usually fat-tailed

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns, also known as log-returns. Let me start by recalling what I know about log-returns.

First, I remember that log-returns are calculated using the natural logarithm of the price ratio over a period. The formula is usually something like ln(S_t / S_{t-1}), where S_t is the price at time t. This gives a continuously compounded rate of return for that small time period.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Since log-returns are based on the continuous change in prices, I think this is correct. So A is a feature.

Option B: They can be added over time to give returns for longer periods. Wait, I remember that log-returns have a nice property where you can sum them over time. For example, the total return over two periods is ln(S2/S1) + ln(S3/S2) = ln(S3/S1). So adding them gives the total log return, which makes sense. So B is a feature.

Option C: They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns. I think this is also correct. When you have a portfolio with weights w_i for each asset, the portfolio's log return is the sum of each asset's log return multiplied by its weight. So yes, you can add them across assets. So C is a feature.

Option D: They are usually fat-tailed. Wait, what's fat-tailed? Fat tails mean that the distribution has more probability in the tails compared to a normal distribution. I'm a bit fuzzy here. I know that log-returns are often assumed to be normally distributed, but in reality, financial returns can exhibit fat tails, meaning more extreme events than a normal distribution would suggest. So are log-returns fat-tailed or not? Or is this a feature of the actual returns rather than the log-returns themselves?

Wait, no. The log-returns themselves are the returns after applying the log, which might not necessarily have fat tails. Or do they? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. If the actual price changes are fat-tailed, then their log-transformed versions (log-returns) might still have some issues. But I think log-returns are often used because they can turn multiplicative processes into additive ones, but the underlying distribution could still have fat tails.

Wait, another angle: the question is asking which is NOT a feature. So if log-returns are usually fat-tailed, then D would be a feature, but if they are not, then D is the correct answer. But I'm not sure if log-returns are fat-tailed. I think that in practice, financial returns (whether log or simple) are known to have fat tails, meaning they have higher kurtosis. So if log-returns are used, they might still exhibit fat tails. But I'm not certain if this is a feature of log-returns or a characteristic of the data itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is between simple returns and log-returns. Simple returns can have more extreme values, but log-returns tend to smooth them out. But I'm not sure about the fat-tailed part. Wait, no, the log transformation doesn't change the tails' fatness; it's just a transformation. So if the original data has fat tails, the log-returns might still have some, but perhaps less. Or maybe not. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think differently. The question is about what is NOT a feature. So the other options are all features. So which one is not?

Option D says they are usually fat-tailed. If log-returns are supposed to have normal distribution properties, then maybe they are not fat-tailed. But in reality, log-returns might still exhibit some fatness in the tails because the underlying asset prices often do. So I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct answer is D because log-returns are supposed to be additive and normally distributed, implying they might not have fat tails. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, another approach: the key feature of log-returns is that they can be added over time and across assets. So options A, B, and C are correct. The one that's not a feature would be D. Because log-returns are often assumed to be normally distributed, which would imply they are not fat-tailed. But in reality, they might still be, but the question is about features of log-returns, not their empirical distribution.

Wait, no. The question is which is NOT a feature. So if log-returns are not fat-tailed, then D is the answer. But I'm not sure if log-returns are fat-tailed or not. Alternatively, maybe log-returns actually have fatter tails than simple returns, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that log-returns are additive, so the fat-tailed part is not a feature. Or maybe D is correct because log-returns are not fat-tailed. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think I should go with D as the answer because the other options are features of log-returns, and D is about fat tails, which are more associated with non-log returns or the actual price changes rather than the log-returns themselves.

The question asks which option is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns (log-returns). Log-returns are calculated using the natural logarithm of price changes and have properties such as being additive over time and across assets. 

- **Option A**: Log-returns represent continuously compounded changes in prices, which is a correct feature.  
- **Option B**: Log-returns can be summed over time to calculate total returns over longer periods, which is also a correct feature.  
- **Option C**: Log-returns can be combined across assets to determine portfolio returns, another correct feature.  
- **Option D**: The statement that log-returns are "usually fat-tailed" is not a defining feature. While financial returns often exhibit fat tails, log-returns are typically assumed to be normally distributed, making this the correct answer.

ANSWER: D
