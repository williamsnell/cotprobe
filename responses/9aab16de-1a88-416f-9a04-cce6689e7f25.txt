Okay, so I've got this question here about Christian denominations and which one promotes a "stripped-down Christianity." The options are A through J, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I should understand what "stripped-down Christianity" means. From what I know, it refers to a form of Christianity that's simplified, without a lot of elaborate rituals or structures. It's more about the essential aspects of the faith, maybe focusing on direct connection with God and simplicity in worship and practices.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Roman Catholic - They have a lot of rituals, like the Mass with its elaborate ceremonies, confession, etc. So probably not this one.

B: Lutherans - They are part of the Protestant Reformation, but they still have some traditional practices and liturgies, like the Order of the Mass. So maybe not the most stripped-down.

C: Methodists - They focus on Methodist doctrines, which include things like social holiness and personal piety. Their services are more structured but perhaps not as minimal as some others.

D: Greek Orthodox - They have very structured liturgies and rituals, often in the original Greek, so probably not the stripped-down type.

E: Quakers - I've heard that Quakers emphasize simplicity and direct personal experience of God. Their meetings are often silent, with no formal rituals. This seems like it could fit the "stripped-down" idea.

F: Seventh-day Adventists - They have specific practices, like observing the Sabbath on Saturday, and have a structured belief system, but I'm not sure if it's particularly stripped-down.

G: Baptists - Baptists do focus on immersion baptism and often have simpler services compared to Catholics or Lutherans, but I'm not sure if they're the most stripped-down.

H: Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) - They have their own set of doctrines and practices, including temple worship and a hierarchical structure. I don't think they're known for simplicity in that sense.

I: Puritans - The Puritans were known for their strict interpretation of the Bible and wanted to purify the Church of England. They focused on simplicity and were against elaborate ceremonies, so this could also be a contender.

J: Anglicans - They have a more structured liturgy, similar to the Roman Catholic Church but with some Protestant elements. So probably not the stripped-down option.

Now, I need to compare Quakers and Puritans since both seem to fit the idea of simplicity. Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, have a very simple form of worship without pastors or formal services. They sit in silence and wait for the Spirit to move them to speak. That definitely sounds stripped-down.

On the other hand, the Puritans, while they emphasized simplicity and wanted to strip away what they saw as Catholic excess, their practices were more about reverting to a more primitive form of Christianity, which might include more emphasis on the Bible and less on rituals, but their services were still structured and involved sermons and other elements.

So between E and I, Quakers seem to represent a more stripped-down approach because their services are less structured and more about personal, immediate connection with God without formal rituals or hierarchy.

The Christian denomination that promotes a stripped-down Christianity is **E: Quakers**. Quakers emphasize simplicity, direct personal experience of God, and silent worship without formal rituals or hierarchy.

Answer: E
