Okay, so I have this question about a nursery rhyme and what type of ocean Columbus sailed in 1492. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nursery rhymes, but I think I can figure this out. Let me try to remember.

The question is asking about the rhyme that mentions Columbus. I recall there's a rhyme that goes something like "In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue." Yeah, that sounds familiar. So the line is "sailed the ocean blue." Now, the options are different adjectives describing the ocean. The options are calm, stormy, dangerous, vast, really big, endless, blue, rough, peaceful, windy.

Wait, the rhyme says "blue." So the ocean was blue. Looking at the options, option G is blue. So the answer should be G.

But just to make sure I'm not mixing things up, let me think again. The rhyme definitely mentions the ocean being blue. I don't remember any other color or description. So yeah, the answer is blue.

The answer is G.
