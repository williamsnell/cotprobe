Question:

On Thursday, March 7, an owner's home was destroyed by fire. The owner's house was insured against such fire loss by an insurance company. According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.
B: inadmissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony is considered second-hand information.
C: admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.
D: inadmissible, because it is the responsibility of the owner, not the bookkeeper, to ensure the insurance company received the notice.
E: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.
F: admissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony provides proof of the owner's attempt to notify the insurance company.
G: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.
H: inadmissible, because the bookkeeper cannot confirm the contents of the envelope.
I: admissible, because the owner's statement is considered a verbal act.
J: admissible, because the bookkeeper is a credible witness.

Alright, let me try to work through this question step by step. I'm a bit new to evidence law, so I'll take it slow and see if I can figure this out.

The question is about whether the bookkeeper's testimony is admissible. The scenario is that the owner's home was destroyed by fire on March 7. The insurance policy requires the owner to notify the company within 10 days. The owner didn't notify them on time, but he's suing for $750,000, and the insurance company is denying liability because they didn't receive the notice in time.

At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper. The bookkeeper wants to testify that on March 11, the owner gave her an envelope containing a notice form and that she mailed it. The issue is whether this testimony is admissible.

So, the key here is whether the bookkeeper's testimony about the owner's statement and the envelope's contents is allowed. I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

The bookkeeper is testifying about what the owner told herâ€”that the envelope had the notice form. That sounds like hearsay because the owner's statement is being offered to prove that the insurance company received or should have received the notice. But wait, there's a hearsay exception for statements against interest or maybe for a declaration against interest? Hmm, no, that's usually for statements made by someone who is unavailable. Or perhaps it's a statement that's not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth but to show the bookkeeper's actions.

Wait, the owner's statement to the bookkeeper would be non-hearsay if it's being offered to show the effect it had on the listener, not for the truth of the statement. Like, if the owner told the bookkeeper, "Here's the notice," and then the bookkeeper mailed it, that's about the owner's intent and the bookkeeper's actions. So maybe the owner's statement isn't hearsay here because it's being offered to show that the bookkeeper did something in response, not to prove that the notice was correct.

Alternatively, the bookkeeper's testimony about mailing the envelope could be relevant to show that the notice was sent, but the owner's statement about the envelope's contents is hearsay unless it falls under an exception.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the rules. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. But in this case, the owner is the party, and the bookkeeper is an employee. So if the owner told the bookkeeper something within the scope of her duties, that might be an exception.

Wait, that's the "opposing party's statement" exception under FRE 801(d)(2). So if the bookkeeper is testifying about what the owner said, and the owner is the opposing party (since the insurance company is the other side), then the statement would be admissible under this exception because it's a statement by the party's own employee, made within the scope of employment about a matter within the employee's authority.

Alternatively, maybe the statement isn't hearsay at all because it's being used to show that the bookkeeper mailed the envelope, not for the truth of the statement inside. That is, the statement's purpose is to show that the bookkeeper took action, not that the notice was properly filled out or anything. So if the statement is being offered to show the effect on the listener (the bookkeeper mailing the envelope), it's not hearsay. That's the "non-hearsay" purpose.

So, the bookkeeper is testifying about the owner's statement to show that she mailed the envelope, which is about the fact that she acted upon the instruction. Therefore, the statement isn't being offered for its truth but to show the action taken. That makes it non-hearsay.

Looking at the options, option A says it's admissible because the owner's statement is non-hearsay. Option F says it's admissible because it proves the owner's attempt to notify. Option G says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay not within an exception.

I think the correct reasoning is that the statement is non-hearsay because it's offered to show the bookkeeper's action, not the truth of the statement. So option A would be the right choice because the statement is not hearsay. Alternatively, option F is about proving the attempt, but the real issue is whether the statement is hearsay or not.

Wait, but the bookkeeper's testimony includes both the owner's statement and her mailing. The owner's statement is about the contents of the envelope, which is hearsay if offered for the truth. But if it's offered to show that she mailed it, then it's non-hearsay. So the statement is being used to show she mailed it, so non-hearsay.

So the testimony is admissible under A.

The bookkeeper's testimony about the owner's statement is admissible because the statement is being offered to show the effect it had on the bookkeeper, i.e., mailing the envelope, rather than for the truth of the matter asserted. This makes the statement non-hearsay.
