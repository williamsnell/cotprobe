<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Malus' law. I remember Malus' law is related to the polarization of light. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, then another at 40 degrees to the first, and then another at 15 degrees to the second. But the question specifically asks for the intensity coming out of the second polarizer, which is the middle one. Wait, no, the second polarizer is the one at 40 degrees from the first. So I need to find the intensity after the second polarizer, not the third.

Wait, no, the question says: "What percentage of the original intensity was the light coming out of the second polarizer?" So after the second polarizer, not the third. Got it.

First, I should recall Malus' law. The formula is I = I0 * cos²(theta), where theta is the angle between the polarizer and the incoming light's polarization direction.

But wait, when dealing with multiple polarizers, each subsequent polarizer affects the intensity based on the angle relative to the previous one. Also, the initial light here is unpolarized. Oh, right, when unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, the intensity becomes I0/2, because the average intensity is halved. So, the first polarizer reduces the intensity to half of the original.

Let me break it down:

1. Unpolarized light (intensity I0) passes through the first polarizer. The intensity after the first polarizer (I1) is I0/2. Because Malus' law for unpolarized light is I = I0 * 0.5. Or wait, no—wait, actually, unpolarized light has all possible polarization angles, so when it goes through a polarizer, the intensity is halved because only the component parallel to the polarizer's axis is transmitted. So I1 = I0 * (1/2) = I0/2.

2. Now, the light goes through the second polarizer at an angle of 40 degrees to the first. So the angle theta between the second polarizer and the first is 40 degrees. So the intensity after the second polarizer (I2) is I1 * cos²(theta). Substituting I1 = I0/2, so I2 = (I0/2) * cos²(40°).

Wait, but wait a second. Does the second polarizer's angle matter relative to the original polarization of the first, or is it relative to the transmitted polarization? Because Malus' law considers the angle between the two polarizers. So if the first polarizer is at 0 degrees, the second is at 40 degrees from that, so theta is 40 degrees.

So compute cos(40 degrees) first. Let me calculate cos(40°). I think cos(40°) is approximately 0.7660. So cos²(40) is (0.7660)^2 ≈ 0.5868. So I2 = (I0/2) * 0.5868 ≈ I0 * 0.2934.

So the intensity after the second polarizer is about 29.34% of I0. Looking at the options, option B is 30.4, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the cosine value. Let me double-check cos(40 degrees). Using a calculator, cos(40°) is approximately 0.7660444431. Squaring that gives (0.7660444431)^2 = 0.5868240888. So 0.586824 times I0/2 is 0.586824 * 0.5 = 0.293412, so 29.3412% of I0. That's about 29.3%, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is B:30.4%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because Malus' law applies when the light is already polarized. The first polarizer makes the light polarized at 0 degrees, then the second is at 40 degrees relative to that. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the angle between the second and first as 40 degrees, but perhaps it's the angle between the third and second that's 15 degrees. Wait, no—the third is at 15 degrees to the second, but that's after the second, so for the second polarizer, the angle is 40 degrees from the first.

Wait, but the question is only about the intensity after the second polarizer, not the third. So maybe I don't need to consider the third polarizer at all. So the answer is I2 = I0/2 * cos²(40°), which is approximately 29.34% of I0. The options don't have 29.34, but option B is 30.4. Hmm, that's a bit off. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more accurately. Let me compute cos(40 degrees) again. Using a calculator, cos(40°)=0.7660444431. Squared is 0.5868240888. Multiply by 0.5 (from the first polarizer): 0.5 * 0.586824 ≈ 0.293412, which is 29.3412%. So the answer would be approximately 29.34%, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B:30.4, but that's a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle. Wait, wait, the second polarizer is at 40 degrees to the first, so the angle between them is 40 degrees. So Malus' law applies as I did. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is measured differently, but I think I'm correct.

Wait, maybe the first polarizer is at some angle, and the second is 40 degrees relative to that. So I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use a different approach, like considering the third polarizer but no, the question is about the second. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see the options:

A:50.0

B:30.4

C:70.7

D:45.9

E:65.3

F:25.5

G:54.8

H:85.1

I:60.5

J:75.2

Hmm. So option B is 30.4, which is close to 29.34. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the exact value of cos(40 degrees). Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after the first polarizer, the intensity is I0/2, then the second polarizer is at 40 degrees, so I2 = (I0/2) * cos²(40), which is (I0/2)*(0.5868) = I0 * 0.2934, so 29.34%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should see if any of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, perhaps the second polarizer is at 40 degrees to the first, but the first is unpolarized, so maybe the angle is different. Wait no, the first polarizer sets the polarization direction, so the second's angle is 40 degrees relative to that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the angle between the second and first polarizers as 40 degrees, so the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the first polarizer reduces the intensity to I0/2, then the second polarizer is at 40 degrees, so I2 = I0/2 * cos²(40), which is approximately 29.34%. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Unpolarized light has intensity I0. After the first polarizer, it's I0/2. Then, the second polarizer is at 40 degrees to the first. So the intensity after the second is I0/2 * cos²(40). Then, the third is at 15 degrees to the second, but the question is only about the second.

So, perhaps the answer is approximately 29.34%, which isn't an option, but the closest is B:30.4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in cos(40). Let me compute it more precisely.

Using a calculator, cos(40°) is approximately 0.7660444431. Squared is 0.7660444431 * 0.7660444431 = 0.5868240888.

Then, 0.5868240888 * 0.5 (since I0/2) is 0.2934120444, which is 29.3412%. So 29.34% is approximately 29.3%.

Looking at the options, option B is 30.4, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should round up, but that's a jump of about 1%, which might be due to more precise calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem isn't considering the first polarizer's effect correctly. Wait, no, because unpolarized light through a polarizer gives I0/2. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the second polarizer's angle is relative to the original polarization direction, not relative to the first. But in the problem, it's stated as "another polarizer at angle 40 degrees to the first," so it's relative to the first polarizer. So I think that's correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the angle between the second and first is 40 degrees, so theta is 40 degrees, so cos(theta) is correct as 0.7660. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is using degrees instead of radians, but no, cos(40 degrees) is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second polarizer's angle is 40 degrees from the first, but the first is at some other angle. Wait, no, the first is arbitrary, so the angle between them is 40 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the intensity after the second polarizer, which is I2, but perhaps I'm being asked about the third. Wait, no, the question specifically says the second polarizer.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the intensity after the third polarizer, but the question is about the second. No, the question is clear.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the angle between the first and second is 40 degrees, but perhaps the angle between the second and third is 15 degrees, but that's after the second, so for the second polarizer, the angle is 40 degrees from the first.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second polarizer is at 40 degrees relative to the first, and the third is at 15 degrees relative to the second, but the question is about the second, so the third doesn't affect the intensity after the second.

So, perhaps the answer is approximately 29.34%, but since that's not an option, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the angle between the second and third as 40 degrees, but no, the problem says the second is at 40 degrees to the first, and the third at 15 degrees to the second.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after the second polarizer, the intensity is I2, which is I0/2 * cos²(40), and then the third polarizer would further reduce it, but the question is about the second.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the angle between the second and first is 40 degrees, so the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first polarizer is at 0 degrees, the second at 40 degrees, so the angle is 40 degrees. So I think that's right.

Wait, but maybe the options are considering the angle as 40 degrees from the original, not from the first polarizer. No, the problem says the second is at 40 degrees to the first, so it's relative to the first.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value more accurately.

Let me compute cos(40 degrees) precisely. Using a calculator, 40 degrees in radians is about 0.6981317 radians. The cosine of that is approximately 0.7660444431. So squared, that's 0.5868240888.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.5 * 0.5868240888 = 0.2934120444, which is 29.34120444% of I0.

Looking at the options again, the closest is B:30.4. Perhaps the problem expects rounding to one decimal place, but 29.34 is closer to 29.3, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Malus' law is applied differently. Let me think. When light passes through multiple polarizers, each polarizer's angle is relative to the previous one's polarization direction. So the first polarizer sets the polarization direction, the second is at 40 degrees to that, and the third is at 15 degrees to the second's direction.

So, the first step: I1 = I0 * (1/2) = I0/2.

Second step: I2 = I1 * cos²(40) = (I0/2) * cos²(40) ≈ (I0/2) * 0.5868 ≈ 0.2934 I0.

So, 29.34% of I0. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the product of cosines. Wait, no, because each polarizer's effect is cumulative. So I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after the first polarizer, the intensity is I0/2, then the second polarizer is at 40 degrees, so I2 = (I0/2) * cos²(40) ≈ 29.34% I0.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option B:30.4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the angle is 45 degrees instead of 40, but no, the problem says 40 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 30 degrees, but no, it's 40.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the intensity after the third polarizer, but the question is about the second. So no.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option B is 30.4, which is close to 29.34. Perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute cos(40 degrees) again. Using a calculator, 40 degrees, cos is 0.7660444431. Squared is 0.5868240888. Multiply by 0.5: 0.2934120444. So 29.34%.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option B:30.4, but that's not matching exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first polarizer doesn't reduce the intensity by half. Wait, no, unpolarized light through a polarizer does become polarized with intensity I0/2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first polarizer as not reducing the intensity. Wait, no, that's not correct. Unpolarized light has equal intensity in all directions, so a polarizer would pass half the intensity as the component in the direction of the polarizer's axis. So I think the first step is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the second polarizer at 45 degrees, which would give cos²(45) = 0.5, so I2 = (I0/2)*0.5 = I0/4 = 25%, which is option F:25.5. But that's not matching the problem statement, which says 40 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the second polarizer at 30 degrees, but again, the problem says 40.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the intensity after the third polarizer, but the question is about the second. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of cos(40). Let me compute it again precisely. Using a calculator, cos(40°) is approximately 0.7660444431. Squared is 0.5868240888. So 0.586824 * 0.5 = 0.293412, which is 29.34%.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use a different formula, such as considering the product of the cosines without squaring. No, that's not correct. Malus' law is I = I0 * cos²(theta).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the intensity after the second polarizer to be I0 * cos(40), not squared. But that would be incorrect. Malus' law uses the square.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 40 degrees, but the calculation uses the complementary angle, like 50 degrees. Wait, no, the angle is between the polarizers, so it's 40 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the angle is measured from the original direction or from the first polarizer. The problem says the second is at 40 degrees to the first, so it's relative to the first.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different convention, but I don't think so.

Hmm. So, given that, the correct calculation leads to approximately 29.34%, which isn't an option. But the closest option is B:30.4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute cos(40 degrees) more accurately. Let me try:

cos(40°) = cos(40 * π/180) ≈ cos(0.6981317 radians).

Using a calculator, cos(0.6981317) ≈ 0.7660444431.

So squared is 0.5868240888.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.2934120444.

So 29.34120444% of the original intensity. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B:30.4, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to include the third polarizer's effect, but the question is only about the second. So no.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the second polarizer's angle is 40 degrees relative to the third, but that's not what the problem says. The problem says the second is at 40 degrees to the first, and the third is at 15 degrees to the second.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the second polarizer at 45 degrees, but the problem says 40. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first polarizer reduces the intensity to I0/2, then the second polarizer is at 40 degrees, so I2 = I0/2 * cos(40). Wait, no, that's not correct. Malus' law uses cos squared.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the intensity after the third polarizer, but the question is about the second. So no.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the second polarizer at 40 degrees, and the third at 15 degrees from the second, but the question is about the second, so the third doesn't matter.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the intensity after the second polarizer, which is I2 = I0/2 * cos²(40), which is approximately 29.34%. But that's not an option, so perhaps the intended answer is B:30.4, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check: 0.7660 squared is 0.5868. 0.5868 * 0.5 is 0.2934, which is 29.34%. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 29.34%, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B:30.4. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the angle between the second and third polarizers, but the question is about the second.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between the first and second is 40 degrees, and between the second and third is 15 degrees, but the question is about the second, so we only consider the first two.

Hmm. I think I've done the correct calculation, but perhaps the intended answer is B:30.4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the intensity after the second polarizer relative to the initial intensity, which is correct. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polarizer's angle is 40 degrees from the third, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the second polarizer at 45 degrees, which would give 25%, which is option F, but the problem says 40 degrees.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Based on the calculation, the answer should be approximately 29.34%, but the closest option is B:30.4. So perhaps the intended answer is B.
</think>

The problem involves applying Malus' law to determine the intensity of light after passing through two polarizers. The first polarizer reduces the intensity of unpolarized light to half, \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \). The second polarizer is at an angle of \( 40^\circ \) relative to the first, so the intensity after the second polarizer is given by:

\[
I_2 = I_1 \cdot \cos^2(40^\circ)
\]

Substituting \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \) and \( \cos(40^\circ) \approx 0.7660 \), we calculate:

\[
\cos^2(40^\circ) \approx 0.5868
\]
\[
I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot 0.5868 \approx 0.2934 I_0
\]

This corresponds to approximately \( 29.34\% \) of the original intensity. Among the given options, the closest value is \( 30.4\% \), which aligns with option **B**.

Answer: B
