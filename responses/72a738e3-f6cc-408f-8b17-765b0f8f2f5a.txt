Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: A mixture consisting only of KOH and Ca(OH)₂ is neutralized by acid. It takes exactly 0.100 equivalents to neutralize 4.221 g of the mixture. We need to find the initial composition by weight of the mixture from the given options A to J.

Hmm, okay. So, the mixture has two components: KOH and calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)₂. When they're neutralized by an acid, they react to form their respective salts, water, etc. But the key here is the concept of equivalents because that's what the problem gives us.

I remember that equivalents are used to determine the amount of a substance that reacts with another. The equivalent weight is the molar mass divided by the number of reactive ions or H+ ions the substance can donate or accept. For neutralization reactions, it's about the H+ and OH- ions.

So, KOH is a strong base, and its reaction with acid would be a 1:1 ratio because each mole of KOH provides one OH- ion. Similarly, Ca(OH)₂ is a strong base as well. Each formula unit of Ca(OH)₂ provides two OH- ions because it dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 OH⁻. So, when neutralizing, each mole of Ca(OH)₂ would require two moles of H+ (from the acid), meaning each mole gives two equivalents.

Wait, let me get that straight. So, for KOH, each mole gives 1 equivalent, and for Ca(OH)₂, each mole gives 2 equivalents. That makes sense because Ca(OH)₂ has two OH- ions per formula unit.

The problem states that 0.100 equivalents are needed to neutralize the mixture. So, the total equivalents from both KOH and Ca(OH)₂ must add up to 0.100.

Let me denote the mass of KOH as m1 and the mass of Ca(OH)₂ as m2. We know that m1 + m2 equals 4.221 g.

Now, I'll calculate the number of moles for each component. Moles of KOH = m1 / molar mass of KOH. Similarly, moles of Ca(OH)₂ = m2 / molar mass of Ca(OH)₂.

The molar mass of KOH: K is about 39.10 g/mol, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So, 39.1 + 16 + 1.008 ≈ 56.108 g/mol.

Molar mass of Ca(OH)₂: Ca is 40.08, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So, 40.08 + 2*(16 + 1.008) = 40.08 + 34.016 = 74.096 g/mol.

Now, the equivalents from each would be:

Equivalents from KOH = moles of KOH * 1 (since each mole gives 1 equivalent)
Equivalents from Ca(OH)₂ = moles of Ca(OH)₂ * 2 (each mole gives 2 equivalents)

So, total equivalents = (m1 / 56.108) * 1 + (m2 / 74.096) * 2 = 0.100.

And we also have m1 + m2 = 4.221 g.

So, we have two equations:

1. m1 + m2 = 4.221
2. (m1 / 56.108) + (2 * m2 / 74.096) = 0.100

I can solve these two equations to find m1 and m2.

Let me write equation 1 as m1 = 4.221 - m2.

Substituting into equation 2:

( (4.221 - m2) / 56.108 ) + (2 m2 / 74.096) = 0.100

Let me compute the coefficients numerically to make it easier.

First, calculate 1/56.108 ≈ 0.017816 (since 56.108 ≈ 56, 1/56 ≈ 0.01786, so close enough).

And 2/74.096 ≈ 0.02700 (because 74.096 is ~74, 2/74 ≈ 0.02703).

So the equation becomes:

(4.221 - m2) * 0.017816 + m2 * 0.02700 ≈ 0.100

Let me compute each term.

Calculate (4.221 * 0.017816) ≈ 4.221 * 0.0178 ≈ 0.07505.

Then, the equation becomes:

0.07505 - 0.017816 m2 + 0.02700 m2 = 0.100

Combine the m2 terms:

(-0.017816 + 0.02700) m2 = (0.009184) m2.

So,

0.07505 + 0.009184 m2 = 0.100

Subtract 0.07505 from both sides:

0.009184 m2 = 0.100 - 0.07505 = 0.02495

So, m2 = 0.02495 / 0.009184 ≈ 2.715 g.

Wait, that's approximately 2.715 grams of Ca(OH)₂. Then, m1 = 4.221 - 2.715 ≈ 1.506 grams of KOH.

Looking at the options, let's check the closest one. Option E is 1.0g KOH and 3.221g Ca(OH)₂, which sums to 4.221g, but the amounts don't match. Option F is 1.4g KOH and 2.7g Ca(OH)₂. Sum is 4.1g, which is close but not exact. Option A: 1.7g KOH +2.521g Ca(OH)₂. Sum is 4.221g. Hmm, but our calculation gave m1≈1.5g and m2≈2.715g. None of the options exactly match, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me recalculate the coefficients more accurately.

1/56.108 = 0.017805 (exact division: 1 ÷ 56.108 = approximately 0.017805)
2/74.096 = 0.02700 (exactly: 2 ÷ 74.096 ≈ 0.02700).

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places for accuracy.

Let me recompute the equation with exact numbers.

The equation after substitution is:

(4.221 - m2) / 56.108 + (2 m2) / 74.096 = 0.100

Let me compute each term with more precision.

First, 4.221 / 56.108 = approximately 0.07517.

Then, (4.221 - m2)/56.108 = 0.07517 - (m2 /56.108).

Similarly, 2 m2 /74.096 = (2/74.096) m2 ≈ 0.02700 m2.

So, the equation becomes:

0.07517 - (m2 /56.108) + 0.02700 m2 = 0.100

Let me express m2 as a variable x.

So,

0.07517 - (x /56.108) + 0.02700 x = 0.100

Combine the terms with x:

x (0.02700 - (1/56.108)) = 0.100 - 0.07517

Compute (1/56.108) ≈ 0.017805

So,

x (0.02700 - 0.017805) = 0.02483

x (0.009195) = 0.02483

x = 0.02483 / 0.009195 ≈ 2.702 g.

So, m2 ≈ 2.702 grams of Ca(OH)₂, and m1 =4.221 -2.702 =1.519 grams of KOH.

Wait, that's about 1.519g KOH and 2.702g Ca(OH)₂.

Now, looking at the options, let me check each one:

Option C: 1.52g KOH and 2.701g Ca(OH)₂. That's very close to our calculated values. 1.519 is approx 1.52g, and 2.702 is approx 2.701g. So option C must be the correct one.

Wait, but in the options, option C is written as 1.52 g-KOH and 2,701 g Ca(OH)₂. I think that's a typo, the comma should be a period. So 2.701 grams.

Yes, that matches our calculation.

The problem involves determining the initial composition by weight of a mixture of KOH and Ca(OH)₂ that requires 0.100 equivalents of acid for neutralization. The mixture's total mass is 4.221 g. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Equivalents Calculation**:  
   - KOH provides 1 equivalent per mole.  
   - Ca(OH)₂ provides 2 equivalents per mole.  

2. **Molar Masses**:  
   - KOH: ~56.108 g/mol  
   - Ca(OH)₂: ~74.096 g/mol  

3. **Equations**:  
   - \( m_1 + m_2 = 4.221 \) g (total mass)  
   - \( \frac{m_1}{56.108} + \frac{2m_2}{74.096} = 0.100 \) (equivalents)  

4. **Solving**:  
   Substituting \( m_1 = 4.221 - m_2 \) into the equivalents equation yields:
