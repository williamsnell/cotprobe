Okay, so I have this question: "How many trees are there on 5 labeled vertices?" And I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my graph theory, but let me think this through.

Wait, I remember something about labeled trees and a formula called Cayley's formula. Wasn't that the one that tells you the number of trees with a certain number of vertices? I think Cayley's formula says that the number of labeled trees with n vertices is n^(n-2). So for n=5, that would be 5^(5-2) = 5^3. Let me calculate that: 5 times 5 is 25, and 25 times 5 is 125. So that would make 125 trees.

Looking back at the options, option F is 125. So that's probably the correct answer. Wait, but just to make sure I'm not confusing it with something else. Another way to think about it is using Prüfer sequences. Each labeled tree corresponds uniquely to a sequence of length n-2, where each element is a label of one of the vertices. So for 5 vertices, the number of such sequences is 5^3, which again is 125. Yep, that matches.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The formula is straightforward, and the reasoning with Prüfer sequences supports it. So I'm confident that the answer is F: 125.

The number of labeled trees with 5 vertices is given by Cayley's formula, which states that the number of labeled trees with \( n \) vertices is \( n^{n-2} \). For \( n = 5 \), this is \( 5^{5-2} = 5^3 = 125 \). 

Answer: F
