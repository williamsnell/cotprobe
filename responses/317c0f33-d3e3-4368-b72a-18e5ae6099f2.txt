Question:

An automobile battery produces a potential difference (or "voltage") of 12 volts between its terminals. (It really consists of six 2 volt batteries following one after the other.)

E: 3.33 amps, 3.6 ohms
F: 5 amps, 2.4 ohms
G: 4.5 amps, 2.67 ohms
H: 2.2 amps, 5.45 ohms
I: 2.5 amps, 4.8 ohms
J: 3.5 amps, 4 ohms

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an automobile battery and a headlight bulb. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says the battery produces a potential difference of 12 volts. Oh right, and it's made up of six 2-volt batteries connected in series. But I don't think that part matters for solving this particular question because the total voltage is given as 12V. So the bulb is connected directly across the terminals, meaning it's across the full 12V.

The bulb is supposed to dissipate 40 watts of joule heat. Joule heat is another term for power dissipation, right? So the bulb's power is 40 watts. I remember that power (P) can be calculated using different formulas. One of them is P = V * I, where V is voltage and I is current. Another is P = I² * R, where R is resistance. And there's also P = V² / R. So I think I can use these relationships to find the current and resistance.

The question is asking for two things: the current the bulb draws and its resistance. So I need to find both I and R.

Let me start with what I know. The voltage V is 12V. The power P is 40W. So using P = V * I, I can solve for I. Let me rearrange that formula: I = P / V. Plugging in the numbers, I get I = 40W / 12V. Let me compute that. 40 divided by 12 is... let's see, 12 times 3 is 36, so 40 minus 36 is 4, so 3 and 4/12, which simplifies to 3.333... amps. So that's approximately 3.33 amps.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 3.33 amps and 3.6 ohms. Let me check if that's correct. But I think I should also find the resistance to make sure.

To find resistance, I can use another formula. Since I already have P and V, perhaps using P = V² / R. Rearranging that gives R = V² / P. Let's plug in the values: V is 12V, so 12 squared is 144, and P is 40. So R = 144 / 40. Let me compute that. 40 goes into 144 three times (3*40=120), leaving 24. 24 divided by 40 is 0.6, so 3.6 ohms. So R is 3.6 ohms.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E says 3.33 amps and 3.6 ohms. That matches both the current and resistance I just calculated. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait a second, let me double-check. Another way to find R is using I = P / V, but wait, no, that's for current. Alternatively, using Ohm's law, V = I * R. Since I is 3.333A and V is 12V, R would be 12 / (10/3) = 12 * (3/10) = 36/10 = 3.6 ohms. Yep, that checks out.

Alternatively, using P = I² R. So I squared is (10/3)^2 = 100/9. So 100/9 * R = 40. Solving for R, R = 40 * 9 / 100 = 360/100 = 3.6 ohms. Again, same result.

So both methods give me R = 3.6 ohms and I = 3.33 amps. Looking at the options, that's option E.

The problem involves calculating the current and resistance of a headlight bulb connected to a 12V battery, given that it dissipates 40 watts of power. Using the power formula \( P = V \times I \), the current is found to be \( I = \frac{40}{12} = 3.33 \, \text{amps} \). For resistance, using \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), we find \( R = \frac{12^2}{40} = 3.6 \, \Omega \). Both values match option E.
