The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."…
We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.
We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.…
We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.

Alright, so I've got this history question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about what President Franklin D. Roosevelt did in response to political challenges from someone like Senator Huey P. Long. The passage provided is a speech by Huey P. Long, where he talks about a society called "Share Our Wealth Society" with the motto "Every Man a King." He mentions limiting the wealth of big men, suggesting that no one should own more than $50 million and ensuring every family has around $5,000. 

So, the context is the 1930s, during the Great Depression. Roosevelt was the president then, and he was dealing with various political challenges, including from figures like Long who were pushing for more radical economic reforms.

Now, the options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Abolishing Social Security and other welfare programs. Wait, I think Social Security was actually part of Roosevelt's New Deal. So he wouldn't abolish it; he probably started it. So A is unlikely.

Option B: Announcing he wouldn't run for re-election. I don't remember FDR announcing that. He was re-elected multiple times, but in 1944 he was running for a fourth term when he died. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Launching the Second New Deal, including Social Security. Yes, the Second New Deal was a series of programs, including Social Security, that came after the initial New Deal. This was in response to criticisms that the first New Deal didn't go far enough in helping the poor and regulating the economy. So C sounds plausible.

Option D: Launching a military campaign. FDR didn't start a military campaign in the 1930s in response to Long. He focused on domestic policies. Plus, WWII started later, and that was more of a global event than a response to Long. So D is probably not correct.

Option E: Diverting attention by letting Pearl Harbor be bombed. That's a conspiracy theory; the attack on Pearl Harbor was a real event, but FDR didn't allow it to happen. Plus, it's not related to responding to Long's political challenges. So E is wrong.

Option F: Proposing "Every Man a King" policy. That's actually what Senator Long was promoting, not FDR. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Implementing a policy to limit individual wealth to $50 million. Again, that was Long's proposal, not FDR's. So G is not the answer.

Option H: Opposing wealth redistribution. FDR's policies, like the New Deal, involved some redistribution through relief and social programs. So H is unlikely.

Option I: Proposing a guaranteed minimum income. I'm not sure if FDR proposed that specifically. The New Deal included various programs, but a guaranteed minimum income might be more associated with later policies or different figures. So I'm not sure about I.

Option J: Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate. FDR was more about government intervention and regulation, not cutting taxes or deregulating. So J is probably wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct response was the Second New Deal, which included Social Security. So the answer should be C.
