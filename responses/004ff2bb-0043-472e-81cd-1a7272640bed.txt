Okay, so I have this question about reinforcement schedules and which one results in behavior that's least resistant to extinction. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about reinforcement schedules.

From what I remember, reinforcement schedules are ways to deliver rewards after a certain number of responses or intervals. There are different types, like fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, variable interval, and continuous reinforcement. Each of these affects how the behavior is maintained and how resistant it is to extinction.

So the question is asking which schedule leads to the least resistant behavior to extinction. That means the behavior would stop more easily when the reinforcement stops.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Variable Ratio (VR). I think VR schedules are known for producing high and steady response rates. They're also very resistant to extinction because the reinforcement is unpredictable. So if the behavior is highly resistant, that's not the answer here because the question is about the least resistant.

Option B: Variable Interval (VI). VI schedules deliver reinforcement after an unpredictable time period. They also produce high resistance to extinction. So similar to VR, behavior is hard to extinguish, so probably not the answer.

Option C: Fixed Ratio with large ratio. Fixed Ratio (FR) schedules give a reward after a set number of responses. A large ratio means you have to make many responses before getting a reward. I think this might lead to more eager responses but maybe not as high resistance as VR or VI. But I'm not sure yet.

Option D: Continuous with long intervals. Continuous reinforcement means every response is rewarded. But if the intervals are long, that's a bit confusing. Wait, continuous usually means every response, but maybe this refers to a continuous schedule but with longer waits? Not sure. But continuous reinforcement typically leads to rapid extinction when the reinforcement stops because the subject is used to getting it every time. So if it's continuous, extinction happens quickly, making the behavior less resistant.

Option E: Continuous. As I said, continuous reinforcement is when every response is rewarded. This is known for producing behaviors that extinguish quickly when reinforcement stops. So this would be the least resistant, right? Because when the reinforcement stops, the subject has no reason to continue.

Option F: Fixed Ratio. FR schedules, like FR-5, give a reward after five responses. These are more resistant than continuous, but less than variable. So extinction might be quicker than VR or VI but not as quick as continuous.

Option G: Fixed Interval. FI schedules give reinforcement after a set time, not based on responses. These can lead to slow response rates, and when reinforcement stops, extinction happens a bit more quickly than variable schedules but maybe not as quickly as continuous.

Option H: Variable Ratio with large ratio. Wait, variable ratio is already a type. If it's a large ratio, like VR-50, that might mean the average is high. But variable ratio is generally very resistant, so maybe this is even more so? I'm not sure if this makes a difference. Maybe it's similar to option A.

Option I: Variable Ratio with small ratio. So like VR-2 or something. That's a lower ratio, meaning more frequent reinforcement. This might make the behavior more resistant because the subject gets rewards more often, so the schedule is tighter. Wait, but variable ratio is already high resistance. Maybe a small ratio (like VR-1) is actually continuous, but that's not right. Wait, VR-1 is continuous reinforcement. So perhaps a small ratio in variable terms would mean more frequent rewards, making extinction harder, so more resistant. So the least resistant would not be this.

Option J: Fixed Interval with long intervals. FI with longer times between reinforcements. FI schedules can lead to low response rates because the subject might wait for the interval to end. When reinforcement stops, extinction might come faster because the subject isn't as conditioned to respond quickly. So this might be less resistant.

Now, the question is about which is least resistant. So the behavior that stops easiest when reinforcement is removed.

Continuous reinforcement (option E) is known to produce behavior that extinguishes quickly. Because every response is rewarded, when that stops, the subject has no reason to continue. So E would be the least resistant.

Wait, but option D says 'continuous with long intervals.' That's a bit confusing. Continuous reinforcement is every response, regardless of time. So long intervals might not apply here. Or maybe it's a typo and refers to fixed intervals. Hmm, but D is continuous with long intervals. I'm not sure. But typically, continuous is every response, so D might not be the right way to describe it.

So the answer is E: continuous. Because continuous reinforcement leads to the least resistance to extinction.

The question asks which reinforcement schedule results in behavior that is least resistant to extinction. To determine this, it's important to understand how different reinforcement schedules affect the persistence of behavior when reinforcement is removed.

1. **Variable Ratio (VR)**: This schedule delivers reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses. It is known for producing highly resistant behavior to extinction because the uncertainty of reinforcement keeps the subject motivated to continue responding.

2. **Variable Interval (VI)**: This schedule provides reinforcement after an unpredictable time interval. Like VR, it also produces high resistance to extinction due to the unpredictable nature of the reinforcement.

3. **Fixed Ratio with Large Ratio (FR with large ratio)**: Fixed Ratio schedules reward a set number of responses. A large ratio (e.g., FR-10) requires more responses before reinforcement, which can lead to moderate resistance to extinction but is less resistant than VR or VI.

4. **Continuous with Long Intervals**: Continuous reinforcement means every response is rewarded. However, the mention of "long intervals" is confusing because continuous reinforcement typically involves immediate rewards for every response. Regardless, continuous reinforcement is known to produce behavior that extinguishes quickly when reinforcement stops.

5. **Continuous Reinforcement**: This schedule rewards every response, leading to rapid extinction when reinforcement is removed. It is the least resistant to extinction because the subject is conditioned to expect reinforcement for every response.

6. **Fixed Ratio (FR)**: Fixed Ratio schedules are more resistant than continuous reinforcement but less resistant than VR or VI. Extinction occurs more quickly than with VR or VI but not as quickly as with continuous reinforcement.

7. **Fixed Interval (FI)**: Fixed Interval schedules reward responses after a set time period. These schedules can lead to slower response rates and relatively quick extinction when reinforcement is removed.

8. **Variable Ratio with Large Ratio (VR with large ratio)**: Similar to VR, this schedule is highly resistant to extinction, as the unpredictability of reinforcement keeps behavior persistent.

9. **Variable Ratio with Small Ratio (VR with small ratio)**: A small ratio (e.g., VR-2) means reinforcement is given more frequently, which increases resistance to extinction. This makes it more resistant than continuous reinforcement.

10. **Fixed Interval with Long Intervals (FI with long intervals)**: Long intervals between reinforcements can lead to low response rates and relatively quick extinction when reinforcement stops.

Based on this analysis, **continuous reinforcement** (option E) is the schedule that results in behavior that is least resistant to extinction because the behavior extinguishes quickly when reinforcement is removed.
