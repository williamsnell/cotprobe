Question:

A manometer consists of a U-shaped tube containing a liquid. One side is connected to the apparatus and the other is open to the atmosphere. The pressure inside the apparatus is then determined from the difference in heights of the liquid. Suppose the liquid is water, the external pressure is 770 Torr, and the open side is $10.0 \mathrm{cm}$ lower than the side connected to the apparatus. What is the pressure in the apparatus? (The density of water at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $0.99707 \mathrm{g} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.)

Okay, so I have this manometer problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, manometers are used to measure pressure, right? The setup is a U-shaped tube with water. One end is connected to some apparatus, and the other is open to the atmosphere. The pressure in the apparatus is determined by the difference in the heights of the water on either side.

The question says the external pressure is 770 Torr. Wait, external pressure—so that's the atmospheric pressure on the open side, I think. And the open side is 10.0 cm lower than the apparatus side. Wait, lower—so does that mean the water level on the apparatus side is higher? Because if the open side is lower, the apparatus side must be higher, which would mean the pressure there is higher than atmospheric.

Wait, I should visualize this. Imagine a U-tube. On the left side (connected to the apparatus), the water level is higher than on the right, which is open. So the height difference is 10 cm. That makes sense because if the apparatus pressure is higher, it would push the water down on that side, making the other side lower.

I remember the formula for the pressure difference in a manometer: P = ρgh, where ρ is density, g is gravity, and h is the height difference. But wait, since the open side is lower, that means the pressure on the apparatus side is higher than atmospheric. So the pressure in the apparatus (P_app) would be atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the height of the water column.

Wait, no. Wait, when the manometer is open to atmosphere, the pressure on the apparatus side is P_atm plus the hydrostatic pressure. Or is it the other way around? Let me think again. If the apparatus side is higher, then the hydrostatic pressure is pushing downward on the apparatus side, so the pressure there is higher by that amount.

So the formula should be P_app = P_atm + ρgh. Because the water is higher on the apparatus side, so the pressure is higher by the height of the water times density and gravity.

But wait, the problem states that the open side is 10 cm lower. So the height difference (h) is 10 cm. So h is 10 cm, which is 0.1 meters.

Wait, but the units are in cm, and the density is given in g/cm³. Hmm, let's get all the units right.

Density ρ = 0.99707 g/cm³. But I need to convert that to kg/m³ because standard units for pressure are in Pascals, which are kg/(m·s²).

Wait, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 0.99707 g/cm³ is 997.07 kg/m³.

Gravity g is 9.81 m/s².

Height h is 10 cm, which is 0.1 m.

So the pressure due to the water column is P = ρgh = 997.07 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 0.1 m.

Let me compute that. 997.07 * 9.81 is approximately... Let's see, 1000 * 10 is 10,000, but 997.07 is about 0.997 of that. So 997.07 * 9.81 ≈ 9770.7 Pa/m. Wait, actually, let me compute it more accurately.

997.07 * 9.81 = let's calculate:

997.07 * 9 = 8,973.63

997.07 * 0.81 = 807.7667

Adding them together: 8,973.63 + 807.7667 ≈ 9,781.3967 Pa/m.

Then multiply by h=0.1 m: 9,781.3967 * 0.1 = 978.13967 Pa, which is approximately 978.14 Pa.

Wait, but 1 Pa is 1 N/m². So that's about 978 Pa. To convert to kPa, divide by 1000: 0.97814 kPa.

Wait, that's only about 0.98 kPa. But the external atmospheric pressure is 770 Torr. Oh, right, I need to convert that to Pascals as well.

Wait, 1 Torr is 133.322368 Pascals. So 770 Torr is 770 * 133.322368 Pa.

Let me compute that: 770 * 133.322368 ≈ ?

Well, 700 Torr would be 700 * 133.322 ≈ 93,325.6 Pa.

100 Torr is 13,332.2368 Pa.

So 770 is 700 + 70. So 700 is 93,325.6, and 70 Torr would be 70 * 133.322 ≈ 9,332.56 Pa.

Adding together: 93,325.6 + 9,332.56 = 102,658.16 Pa.

Wait, that's 102,658.16 Pa, which is 102.658 kPa.

Wait, so the atmospheric pressure is about 102.658 kPa.

Now, the pressure in the apparatus is atmospheric plus the pressure from the water column.

Wait, no, wait: in the manometer, when the apparatus side is higher, that means the pressure is higher than atmospheric by the hydrostatic pressure. So P_app = P_atm + P_water.

Wait, but wait, when the open end is lower, the water is higher on the apparatus side, so the pressure in the apparatus is higher by the hydrostatic pressure. So adding the two.

So P_app = 102,658 Pa + 978.14 Pa ≈ 103,636.14 Pa, which is 103.636 kPa.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 102 kPa, option J is 105 kPa, and option H is 110, etc.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, in a manometer, if the open side is lower, that means the apparatus side is higher, so the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric. So the formula is correct: P_app = P_atm + ρgh.

But wait, perhaps I should consider units more carefully.

Wait, the density was given as 0.99707 g/cm³. Let me make sure I converted that correctly.

1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 0.99707 g/cm³ is 997.07 kg/m³. That's correct.

Gravity is 9.81 m/s².

Height h is 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. So yes, that's correct.

So ρgh = 997.07 * 9.81 * 0.1 = ?

Wait, let me compute that again:

997.07 * 9.81 = let me compute 1000 *9.81 = 9810, then subtract 2.93 *9.81, since 997.07 is 1000 - 2.93.

Wait, 2.93 *9.81 = approx 28.745. So 9810 - 28.745 = 9781.255 Pa per meter. Multiply by 0.1 m gives 978.1255 Pa, which is 0.9781255 kPa.

So P_app = 102.658 kPa (from 770 Torr) + 0.978 kPa ≈ 103.636 kPa.

Hmm, but the options don't have 103.6. The closest options are A:102 kPa, J:105 kPa.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the external pressure calculation. Let me check that again.

770 Torr to Pascals: 770 * 133.322368 ≈ ?

Let me compute 770 * 133.322368:

770 * 133 = 770*100=77,000; 770*30=23,100; 770*3=2,310. So 77,000 + 23,100 = 100,100; +2,310 = 102,410. Then 770 * 0.322368 ≈ 770 * 0.3 = 231, and 770 * 0.022368 ≈ 17.24. So total ≈102,410 +231=102,641 +17.24≈102,658.24 Pa, which is 102.658 kPa. So that's correct.

So the total P_app is 102.658 + 0.978 ≈103.636 kPa.

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Options are:

A: 102 kPa

B:88

C:130

D:120

E:97

F:115

G:85

H:110

I:92

J:105

So the calculated 103.6 is between A (102) and J (105). Hmm, but I might have made a mistake in the way I set up the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the pressure in the apparatus is lower than atmospheric, so the hydrostatic pressure is subtracted. But that would imply that the open side is higher, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says the open side is 10 cm lower. So the open side is lower, so the apparatus side is higher. So the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric by the hydrostatic pressure. So the correct approach is to add the two pressures.

But perhaps I should check the formula again. Alternatively, perhaps the manometer measures the gauge pressure, which is P_app - P_atm = ρgh. So P_app = P_atm + ρgh.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So the calculation seems correct. But the options don't have 103.6. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the height difference is 10 cm, but I should use cm in the formula with g in cm/s².

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using cm units, then convert to kPa.

Let me try that.

Density ρ = 0.99707 g/cm³.

g = 980 cm/s² (since 1 m/s² = 100 cm/s²).

Height h = 10 cm.

So P = ρ * g * h = 0.99707 g/cm³ * 980 cm/s² * 10 cm.

Compute that: 0.99707 * 980 = let's see, 1 *980=980, so 0.99707 is about 0.997 *980≈977.06.

Multiply by 10 cm: 977.06 *10 = 9770.6 g·cm/s² per cm, but wait, units are a bit messy. Alternatively, since 1 g·cm/s² = 0.001 kg·m/s² = 0.001 N = 0.001 Pa.

Wait, no, actually, 1 g·cm/s² is equal to 0.001 kg * 0.01 m = 0.01 kg·m/s² = 0.01 N. So 1 g·cm/s² = 0.01 N/m², which is 0.01 Pa.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think: 1 Pa = 1 N/m².

1 N = 100,000 dynes.

So 1 Pa = 100,000 dynes/m².

But 1 g = 1000 mg, so 1 g·cm = 1000 mg·cm. Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the pressure in Pascals using cm units.

Wait, another approach: 1 cm of water at 4°C is approximately 98.0638 Pascals. But since the water is at 25°C and density is 0.99707 g/cm³, which is slightly less dense, so 1 cm would be slightly less than 98.0638 Pa.

Compute it exactly:

P = ρ * g * h in cm units.

ρ = 0.99707 g/cm³.

g = 980 cm/s².

h = 10 cm.

So P = 0.99707 * 980 *10 = 0.99707 * 9800 = let's compute that.

0.99707 * 9800 = ?

Well, 1 *9800=9800.

Subtract 0.00293 *9800: 0.00293 *9800 = 28.714.

So 9800 -28.714 = 9771.286 grams·cm/s² per cm? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the unit would be g·cm/s² = (g·cm/s²) → which is equivalent to dynes (since 1 dyne = 1 g·cm/s²).

So 9771.286 dynes per square cm.

Convert that to Pascals: 1 Pa = 10 dynes/cm². So 9771.286 dynes/cm² is 977.1286 Pa.

Ah, so same as before—about 97.71286 kPa? No, wait, 9771.286 dynes/cm² = 977.1286 Pa, which is 0.9771286 kPa. Wait, no—that can't be right because 1 cm of water is about 98 Pa, so 10 cm would be about 980 Pa, which is 0.98 kPa. So that's correct.

So back to the main calculation: P_app = P_atm + P_water.

P_atm is 770 Torr = 102,658 Pa.

P_water is 977.1286 Pa.

So total P_app ≈102,658 + 977.1286 ≈103,635.1286 Pa, which is 103.635 kPa.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is J:105 kPa. But perhaps I made a mistake in the setup again.

Wait, perhaps the pressure in the apparatus is lower than atmospheric. But that would mean the open side is higher, which isn't the case here. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should subtract the pressure because the open side is lower, meaning the pressure in the apparatus is lower. But that doesn't make sense because if the open side is lower, the apparatus pressure is higher.

Wait, let me think in terms of the manometer equation. The manometer equation is P_app = P_atm + ρgh, where h is the height difference with the apparatus side higher.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the gauge pressure, not the absolute pressure. But the question says the pressure in the apparatus is determined from the difference, so it's the absolute pressure.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the atmospheric pressure calculation. Let me double-check 770 Torr.

770 Torr * (133.322368 Pa/Torr) = ?

770 * 133.322368 = let me compute 700 *133.322368 = 93,325.6576.

70 *133.322368 = 9,332.56576.

Adding together: 93,325.6576 +9,332.56576 = 102,658.2234 Pa, which is 102.6582234 kPa.

So that's correct.

So P_app = 102.6582234 + 0.9771286 ≈103.635352 kPa.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:105 kPa, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is approximately 103.6 kPa, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is lower than atmospheric, meaning the open side is higher, but the question says the open side is lower. So that can't be.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the manometer is designed so that the open side is lower, meaning the pressure in the apparatus is lower by the hydrostatic pressure. That would mean P_app = P_atm - ρgh.

But why would that be the case? If the open side is lower, the apparatus side must be higher, implying higher pressure. So that would mean P_app is higher, so adding.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the direction of the pressure. If the open side is lower, the pressure in the apparatus must be higher to hold the water up. Therefore, P_app = P_atm + ρgh.

So the calculation is correct, but none of the options match exactly. Maybe the options approximate.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of P_water. Let me compute it again using the correct units.

P_water = 0.99707 g/cm³ * 9.81 m/s² * 0.1 m.

Wait, 0.99707 g/cm³ is 997.07 kg/m³.

So 997.07 kg/m³ *9.81 m/s² *0.1 m = 997.07 *9.81 *0.1.

Let me compute 997.07 *9.81 first.

997.07 *9 = 8,973.63.

997.07 *0.81 = 807.7667.

So total is 8,973.63 +807.7667 =9,781.3967.

Multiply by 0.1: 978.13967 Pa, which is 0.97813967 kPa.

So P_app = 102.658 kPa + 0.978 kPa = 103.636 kPa.

Hmm. The options don't include this. Let me see if I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the external pressure is the pressure in the apparatus, and I need to find the gauge pressure. But the question says, "the pressure inside the apparatus is then determined from the difference in heights of the liquid." So the absolute pressure would be P_atm plus the hydrostatic pressure.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the open side as the reference point. Let me think: if the open side is lower by 10 cm, then the pressure in the apparatus is P_atm plus the pressure from the 10 cm column.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure in the apparatus is P = P_atm + (h * density * g). Which is what I did.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the hydrostatic pressure as gauge pressure, but it's added to the atmospheric pressure.

So, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't include it. Alternatively, maybe I should round the numbers more.

Wait, 770 Torr is exactly 770 * 133.322368 ≈ 102,658.223 Pa, which is 102.658 kPa.

The water pressure is 0.978 kPa. So total is 103.636 kPa.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:105 kPa, but that's 1.364 kPa higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the water pressure.

Wait, perhaps the height is 10 cm, but in the manometer, the pressure is calculated as P = ρgh, but perhaps I should consider the pressure difference as the gauge pressure, and the total pressure is P_atm plus that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the manometer measures the gauge pressure as the difference in height, so P_gauge = ρgh. So the absolute pressure is P_atm + P_gauge.

Which is what I did.

But none of the options match. Maybe the problem expects to use the density as 1 g/cm³ for simplicity, which would make the calculation easier.

Let me try that. If density is 1 g/cm³, then ρ = 1000 kg/m³.

So P_water = 1000 kg/m³ *9.81 m/s² *0.1 m = 981 Pa, which is 0.981 kPa.

P_app = 102.658 + 0.981 ≈103.639 kPa.

Still no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the pressure in the apparatus is lower than atmospheric, so P_app = P_atm - ρgh. But why would that be the case? Because if the open side is lower, the apparatus must have higher pressure, pushing the water down, making the open side lower.

Wait, no, the open side is lower, so the pressure in the apparatus is higher. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the height is 10 cm, but in the calculation, I should use 10 meters? No, that can't be—it's clearly 10 cm.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is measured as the gauge pressure, but the question is asking for absolute pressure, which I calculated as 103.636 kPa. Since that's not an option, maybe I should check for calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pressure in Pascals as 978 Pa, which is 0.978 kPa, and add to 102.658 kPa to get 103.636 kPa. The options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the atmospheric pressure and just compute the gauge pressure. But the question asks for the pressure in the apparatus, which would be the absolute pressure, including atmospheric.

Wait, perhaps the answer is approximately 104 kPa, but the options don't have that. The closest is J:105, but that's a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 770 Torr.

Wait, 770 Torr × 133.322368 Pa/Torr = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

770 × 133.322368 = ?

700 ×133.322368 = 700 ×133 = 93,100; 700×0.322368≈225.6576 → total 93,325.6576.

70 ×133.322368 = 70×133=9,310; 70×0.322368≈22.56576 → total 9,332.56576.

Adding together: 93,325.6576 +9,332.56576 = 102,658.22336 Pa → 102.65822336 kPa.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is supposed to be 103 kPa, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, and the pressure is lower.

Wait, perhaps the pressure in the apparatus is lower than atmospheric. Let me think: if the open side is lower, that would mean the pressure in the apparatus is higher, pushing the water down. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the manometer is inverted. Maybe the open side is higher, but the problem says it's lower. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is P_atm - ρgh. Let's see: 102.658 - 0.978 ≈101.68 kPa. That's close to 102 kPa, option A. But that would imply the apparatus has lower pressure, which contradicts the setup.

Wait, perhaps the manometer is designed such that the open side is lower, meaning the pressure on the apparatus side is lower, which doesn't make sense because if the open side is lower, the pressure in the apparatus must be higher.

I'm confused. Let me think again.

Manometer setup:

- U-tube with water.

- One end connected to apparatus (left), the other open (right).

- Right side is 10 cm lower than left.

So, left side is higher. So pressure on left (apparatus) is higher than right (atmospheric).

So P_app = P_atm + ρgh.

So calculation is correct.

But the options don't have the exact value. So perhaps the intended answer is 103.6, which is approximately 104 kPa, but there's no option for that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kPa without considering the exact Torr to Pa conversion, using 760 Torr = 101.325 kPa.

Wait, 760 Torr = 1 atm ≈101.325 kPa.

So 770 Torr is 770 -760 =10 Torr above 1 atm.

10 Torr is 10 * (101.325 kPa /760) ≈ 1.333 kPa.

So 770 Torr ≈101.325 +1.333 ≈102.658 kPa, which matches our earlier calculation.

So P_app = 102.658 +0.978 ≈103.636 kPa.

But again, no such option. So perhaps the intended answer is 103.6, which rounds to 104, but that's not an option. The closest options are A:102 and J:105.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the water pressure. Let me compute it again.

ρ = 997.07 kg/m³.

g =9.81 m/s².

h=0.1 m.

P = 997.07 *9.81 *0.1.

Compute step by step:

997.07 *9.81 = let's compute:

997.07 *9 =8,973.63.

997.07 *0.81= 807.7667.

Sum:8,973.63 +807.7667=9,781.3967.

Multiply by 0.1:978.13967 Pa → 0.97813967 kPa.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem expects to ignore the atmospheric pressure and just report the gauge pressure, which is 0.978 kPa, but that's way off the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the answer in mmHg or another unit, but the question asks for kPa.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 1 cm of water is approximately 98 Pa, so 10 cm is 980 Pa, which is 0.98 kPa. So adding to 102.658 gives 103.638 kPa.

Still no match. Perhaps the intended answer is 103.6, which would round to 104 kPa, but that's not an option. The options are A:102, J:105.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use 10 cm as 0.1 meters, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 10 cm is 0.1 meters, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pressure is calculated as P = h * (density in kg/m³) * g, but perhaps I should multiply by 1000 somewhere.

Wait, no, I think the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 103.6 kPa, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should choose the closest one, which would be J:105 kPa. But that's a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure in the apparatus is just the pressure from the water column, which is 0.978 kPa, but that's way too low compared to the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. If the open side is lower, perhaps the pressure in the apparatus is lower. But that would mean the water is being pushed down by atmospheric pressure, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to subtract the pressure, so P_app = P_atm - ρgh. Let's compute that.

P_app =102.658 -0.978≈101.68 kPa.

Which is close to option A:102 kPa. But that would imply the apparatus pressure is lower than atmospheric, which contradicts the setup.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should check the options again.

The options are:

A: 102 kPa

B:88

C:130

D:120

E:97

F:115

G:85

H:110

I:92

J:105

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the water pressure. Let me compute it again using cm units.

Pressure in Pascals is given by:

P = (density in g/cm³) × 9.81 m/s² × height in meters.

But perhaps I should convert cm to meters correctly.

Wait, 10 cm is 0.1 m, correct.

Density is 0.99707 g/cm³ = 997.07 kg/m³.

So P = 997.07 *9.81 *0.1 = 978.13967 Pa → 0.978 kPa.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use 10 cm as 100 mm, but that's the same as 0.1 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the atmospheric pressure and just report the gauge pressure, which is 0.978 kPa, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the pressure in the manometer tube, not the absolute pressure. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pressure difference is 10 cm H2O, which is 10 cm * density *g.

But that's what I did.

I think the correct answer is approximately 103.6 kPa, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J:105 kPa. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Torr to Pascals. Let me compute 770 Torr again.

770 Torr × 133.322368 Pa/Torr = ?

770 ×133.322368 = ?

Let me compute 700 ×133.322368 = 93,325.6576.

70 ×133.322368=9,332.56576.

Adding:93,325.6576 +9,332.56576 = 102,658.2234 Pa → 102.658 kPa.

Yes, correct.

So the only conclusion is that the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest is J:105 kPa.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the pressure is calculated as P = h * (density in kg/m³) * g, but perhaps I should multiply by 1000 somewhere.

Wait, no, I think the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the pressure difference as gauge pressure, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the pressure in the manometer, which is the difference, not the absolute pressure. But the question says the pressure in the apparatus is determined from the difference, so it's the absolute pressure.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is approximately 103.6 kPa, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J:105 kPa. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Manometer equation: P_app = P_atm + ρgh.

Yes.

So the answer should be 102.658 +0.978 ≈103.636 kPa.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J:105 kPa.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to round to the nearest 5 kPa, making it 105 kPa.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should check for any miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps the water density was given as 0.99707 g/cm³, which is 997.07 kg/m³, correct.

g=9.81 m/s², correct.

h=0.1 m, correct.

So the calculation is correct. I think the intended answer is not present, but perhaps the closest is J:105 kPa.

To determine the pressure in the apparatus, we analyze the manometer setup. The manometer consists of a U-shaped tube containing water, with one side connected to the apparatus and the other open to the atmosphere. The pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric pressure by the hydrostatic pressure due to the 10 cm height difference of the water column.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Atmospheric Pressure (External Pressure):**  
   The external pressure is given as 770 Torr. Converting this to Pascals:  
   \[
   P_{\text{atm}} = 770 \, \text{Torr} \times 133.322368 \, \text{Pa/Torr} = 102,658.223 \, \text{Pa} = 102.658 \, \text{kPa}.
   \]

2. **Hydrostatic Pressure Due to Water Column:**  
   The height difference \( h \) is 10 cm \( = 0.1 \, \text{m} \). The density of water \( \rho \) is \( 0.99707 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 997.07 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), and gravity \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). The hydrostatic pressure is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{water}} = \rho g h = 997.07 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 0.1 \, \text{m} = 978.14 \, \text{Pa} = 0.978 \, \text{kPa}.
   \]

3. **Pressure in the Apparatus:**  
   Since the open side is lower, the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric pressure by the hydrostatic pressure. Thus:  
   \[
   P_{\text{app}} = P_{\text{atm}} + P_{\text{water}} = 102.658 \, \text{kPa} + 0.978 \, \text{kPa} = 103.636 \, \text{kPa}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated pressure in the apparatus is approximately \( 103.6 \, \text{kPa} \). However, this value does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is **J: 105 kPa**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. Given the options, the most reasonable choice is **J: 105 kPa**.
