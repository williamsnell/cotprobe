Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this bond question. Let me read it again carefully.

The bond was issued on June 1, year 1. It has interest payment dates on April 1 and October 1 each year. The question is asking about the period for which the bond interest expense is recorded for the year ended December 31, year 1.

Hmm, I think I need to determine how much time has passed from the bond's issue date until the end of the year when calculating the interest expense. So, the bond was issued on June 1, and the first interest payment is on April 1. Wait, but April comes before June in the year, so the first payment after issuance would actually be on October 1, right?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Bonds typically pay interest semi-annually, but the exact dates here are April 1 and October 1. So for the first year, after the bond is issued on June 1, the next interest payment is on October 1. Then the next would be April 1 of the following year.

So, the interest for the period from June 1 to October 1 would be the first interest period in year 1. Then, from October 1 to April 1 of the next year, that's the second period.

But the question is about the interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1. So, let's map this out.

Bond issued: June 1, year 1.

First interest payment: April 1. But since the bond was issued on June 1, the first payment after issuance is on October 1, year 1.

So, from June 1 to October 1 is five months. Then, after October 1, the next payment is April 1 of year 2, but that's outside the scope of the year 1.

Wait, but the interest is paid on those dates, so the interest accrues from the issue date until the payment date. So, when calculating the interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, I need to see how much time passed between June 1 and December 31, and during that time, how much interest has accrued up to the next payment date.

Wait, no. Wait, the interest is paid on April 1 and October 1. So, from June 1 to October 1 is the first period. Then, from October 1 to April 1 is the next. But since the year ends on December 31, year 1, the period from October 1 to December 31 is part of year 1.

Wait, let me think again. So, the bond is issued on June 1. The first interest payment is on April 1 of the same year, but since the bond was issued in June, the first payment after issuance is actually on October 1, year 1.

So, the interest that's accrued from June 1 to October 1 is five months. Then, from October 1 to December 31, year 1, is three months. So, the total time for which interest has accrued by the end of year 1 is from June 1 to December 31.

Wait, but the interest is paid on October 1, so up to that point, the interest would have been paid, right? So, the period from June 1 to October 1 is five months, and from October 1 to December 31 is three months. But since the next payment is on April 1 (which is in year 2), the interest for the period from October 1 to April 1 (which is six months) would have accrued, but only up to December 31, which is three months into that period.

Wait, no. Let me try a different approach. The bond was issued on June 1, year 1. The interest is paid on April 1 and October 1 each year. So, in year 1, the interest dates are April 1 and October 1.

But since the bond was issued on June 1, the first interest payment after issuance would be October 1. So, the first period is from June 1 to October 1 (5 months), and the second period would be from October 1 to April 1 of the next year (6 months).

Now, the year ends on December 31, year 1. So, up to December 31, how much interest has been accrued?

From June 1 to October 1: 5 months. Then, from October 1 to December 31: 3 months. So, total time from June 1 to December 31 is 5 + 3 = 8 months.

Wait, but wait. The interest is paid on October 1, so the interest for the period up to October 1 would have been paid, and then from October 1 to December 31, the interest is still accruing until the next payment date on April 1, but since the year ends on December 31, we're only counting up to that point.

So, the interest expense for the year ended December 31 would be for the period from June 1 to October 1 (5 months) plus from October 1 to December 31 (3 months), totaling 8 months.

Wait, but wait another thing. The interest is paid on those dates, so the interest for the period between the issue date and the first payment date is accrued. Then, from the first payment to the next, but since the year ends before the next payment, only part of that period is counted.

So, from June 1 to October 1: 5 months (accrued interest paid on October 1). Then, from October 1 to December 31: 3 months (accrued interest that hasn't been paid yet, as the next payment is on April 1 of the next year).

So, the total interest expense for the year would be for 5 + 3 = 8 months.

But wait, no. Because the interest is paid on the payment dates, so the interest from June 1 to October 1 is for 5 months, and that's the first period. Then, from October 1 to December 31, that's 3 months, but that's part of the next period which would be paid on April 1, so the interest for those 3 months would still be part of the year 1's expense because the year ends before the next payment.

So, the total period is 5 + 3 = 8 months. So, the interest expense is for 8 months.

Looking at the options, option C is eight months.

The bond was issued on June 1, year 1, with interest payments on April 1 and October 1. For the year ended December 31, year 1, the interest expense period includes the time from June 1 to October 1 (5 months) and from October 1 to December 31 (3 months), totaling 8 months.

Answer: C
