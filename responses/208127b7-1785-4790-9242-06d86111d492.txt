Question:

A builder sold a new house to a buyer for use as the buyer's residence. The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?

Options:

A: No, because the builder cannot accept the deed while also holding the mortgage.
B: No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.
C: Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.
D: No, because the builder coerced the buyer into deeding the house back.
E: Yes, because the buyer defaulted on the mortgage payments.
F: Yes, because the builder originally held the mortgage.
G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.
H: No, because the buyer still technically owns the house until foreclosure.
I: No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.

Okay, so I have this question about property law, specifically dealing with mortgages and deeds. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a builder sold a house to a buyer. The buyer paid 10% down and financed the rest with a promissory note and a purchase money mortgage. A year later, the buyer missed several payments and couldn't keep up, so the builder suggested the buyer deed the house back to settle everything. The buyer did that. Now, the question is whether the builder now owns the fee simple title to the house.

First, I need to understand what each part means. A purchase money mortgage is when the buyer gives a mortgage to the seller as part of the payment for the property. So the builder is both the seller and the mortgagee (the lender) in this case.

When the buyer stops making payments, the builder is probably facing default. Normally, the builder could foreclose on the mortgage. Foreclosure would allow the builder to take back the property, but it's a lengthy and costly process. Instead, the builder suggested a deed in lieu of foreclosure. A deed in lieu is when the buyer transfers the title back to the builder to satisfy the mortgage debt.

Now, the key question is: does this deed transfer the fee simple title?

I remember that a mortgage gives the mortgagee (builder) a security interest in the property, not ownership. The buyer still owns the property until foreclosure. But when the buyer deeds the house back, they're transferring ownership. So, if the deed is valid, the builder would own the house outright.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because the builder can't accept the deed while holding the mortgage. But I think that's not correct. The mortgage is a lien, and if the deed is given, it extinguishes the mortgage because the debt is settled. So the builder can accept both.

Option B says no because the buyer can't waive the right to foreclosure. But the buyer can agree to a deed in lieu, which is a waiver. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says yes because it was reasonable and fair. This seems plausible, but the main issue isn't reasonableness but whether the deed transfers title.

Option D says no because of coercion. The question doesn't mention any duress, so D might not apply.

Option E says yes because the buyer defaulted. Default allows the builder to foreclose, but the deed in lieu is an alternative. So E suggests that default gives the builder title, which I think isn't correct because default only gives the right to foreclose, not ownership until then.

Option F says yes because the builder held the mortgage. But holding the mortgage doesn't transfer title; it's a lien. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G mentions equitable redemption. Equitable redemption is when a mortgagor redeems the property by paying off the mortgage, but here the buyer is transferring the title, so maybe this applies. If the deed is a form of redemption, the builder would own the fee.

Option H says no because the buyer still owns until foreclosure. But if the deed is valid, the buyer no longer owns it. So H is incorrect.

Option I says no because the deed is a disguised mortgage. That would mean the builder holds it as security again, but a deed in lieu usually extinguishes the mortgage. So I might not be correct unless there's some hidden mortgage.

So, considering all this, the correct answer would likely be C, G, or maybe E. Wait, but E says yes because of default. But default doesn't automatically transfer title; it allows foreclosure. So the key is the deed in lieu.

When the buyer deeds the house back, that's a conveyance of title. So the builder would have fee simple. Therefore, the answer is yes, so options C or G or E.

Wait, let me think again. Equitable redemption is when the mortgagor pays off the mortgage and takes back the property. But in this case, the buyer is giving the property back, so it's not redemption but a transfer. So maybe G isn't the right reason.

Alternatively, the deed in lieu is a form of satisfaction of the mortgage. So once the deed is delivered, the mortgage is satisfied, and the builder gets the title. So yes, the builder owns the fee simple.

Looking at the options, option C says yes because it's reasonable and fair. But the main legal reason is that the deed transfers title. So perhaps the correct answer is C or G. But I'm not sure about G because equitable redemption usually involves the buyer paying off the debt to get back the property, not giving it up.

Wait, maybe the doctrine of equitable redemption applies when the mortgagor (buyer) transfers the property to the mortgagee (builder) to settle the debt, which effectively extinguishes the mortgage. So under equitable redemption, the builder would get the fee simple. That would make option G correct.

Alternatively, some might say that the deed in lieu is a separate agreement, so the answer is C. But I think the doctrine of equitable redemption is the legal principle here.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check. Equitable redemption typically involves the mortgagor paying the debt and getting the property back. But in this case, the buyer is giving up the property. So maybe it's not redemption. Instead, it's a deed in lieu of foreclosure, which transfers title. So the builder does get fee simple.

In that case, the correct answer would be C: Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances. Or perhaps E, but E's reasoning is about default, which isn't exactly the case here. The buyer defaulted, but the deed is an alternative to foreclosure.

But the question is whether the builder now owns the fee simple. So the correct answer would be yes, because the deed in lieu transfers the title. So the answer is C or G, but I'm more confident it's C, as the deed is valid and transfers title.

The builder now owns fee simple title to the house because the deed in lieu of foreclosure effectively transferred ownership. 

Answer: C
