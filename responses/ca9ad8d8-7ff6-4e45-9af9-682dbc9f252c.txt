Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about closing a deflationary gap by adjusting government spending. I need to figure out the right change in G to get the equilibrium Y up to the full employment level of 600. Let me start by recalling what I know.

From the problem, the initial equilibrium Y is 500, but the full employment level is 600, so there's a gap of 100. That means we need to increase Y by 100 to reach 600. The question is, how much should G change to achieve this?

The model given has the following equations:

Y = C + I + G  
C = 100 + 0.6Y  
I = 0.2Y -50i  
M_D = 0.25Y -30i  
M_s = 65  
G = 100

Wait, but M_s is 65, and it's held constant. So the money supply doesn't change, which might affect the interest rate. But since we're adjusting G, maybe the interest rate will adjust accordingly.

First, I think I need to find the equilibrium condition again but with the new G. Alternatively, maybe I should use the multiplier effect to find out how much G needs to change.

Let me think about how Y is determined. In equilibrium, Y = C + I + G. But C and I depend on Y and i. Also, the money market equilibrium is M_D = M_s.

So, the steps I should take:

1. Find the current equilibrium Y, which is given as 500. So with Y=500, let's see the interest rate.

From M_D = M_s:  
0.25*500 -30i = 65  
125 -30i =65  
125 -65=30i  
60=30i  
i=2.

So the interest rate is 2.

Now, if G increases, that should increase Y. But since M_s is fixed at 65, the increase in Y might cause i to change because M_D depends on Y and i.

But wait, in the initial equilibrium, Y=500, i=2. Now, we want Y to reach 600, so I need to find the new i and then adjust G accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the relationship between Y and G, considering the effect on i.

Let me try to express Y in terms of G and i.

From Y = C + I + G  
C = 100 +0.6Y  
I =0.2Y -50i  
So Y = (100 +0.6Y) + (0.2Y -50i) + G  
Combine terms: Y = 100 +0.6Y +0.2Y -50i + G  
Y =100 + G + (0.8Y) -50i  
Bring 0.8Y to left: Y -0.8Y =100 + G -50i  
0.2Y =100 + G -50i  
Multiply both sides by 5: Y =500 +5G -250i  
Hmm, that's one equation.

Now, the money market: M_D = M_s  
0.25Y -30i =65  
So 0.25Y =65 +30i  
Multiply both sides by 4: Y=260 +120i  
So Y=260 +120i.

Now we have two expressions for Y:

1. Y=500 +5G -250i  
2. Y=260 +120i  

Set them equal:

500 +5G -250i =260 +120i  
Let's rearrange terms:  
500 -260 +5G =120i +250i  
240 +5G =370i  
So 5G =370i -240  
G =74i -48.

Now, we want Y to be 600. So plug Y=600 into equation 2:  
600=260 +120i  
600-260=120i  
340=120i  
i=340/120≈2.8333.

So i≈2.8333.

Now, plug i into G equation:  
G=74*(2.8333) -48  
Calculate 74 * 2.8333:  
74 *2 =148  
74 *0.8333≈61.666  
Total≈148+61.666=209.666  
Then subtract 48: 209.666 -48≈161.666.

Wait, but initial G was 100. So the change in G would be 161.666 -100=61.666. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the steps again.

When I set Y=600, using equation 2: Y=260+120i, so 600=260+120i → 340=120i → i=340/120=17/6≈2.8333.

Then equation 1: Y=500+5G-250i. But when Y=600, 600=500+5G -250*(17/6).

Let me compute 250*(17/6): 250*17=4250, divided by 6 is≈708.333.

So 600=500 +5G -708.333  
500 +5G =600 +708.333  
500 +5G=1308.333  
5G=1308.333 -500=808.333  
G=808.333/5=161.666.

So G needs to be about 161.666. Since initial G was 100, the change is +61.666. Looking at the options, F is 61.5, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the multiplier method. Let me try that.

The initial equilibrium was Y=500. The desired Y is 600, so a change of +100.

The government spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC), but wait, in this model, the multiplier might be affected by the interest rate and money supply.

Alternatively, the total multiplier considering both the fiscal and monetary effects.

Wait, but since M_s is fixed, an increase in G will lead to an increase in Y, which will cause M_D to increase, leading to an increase in i. So the interest rate rises, which affects both C and I.

This makes it a bit more complicated. So perhaps using the two equations I set up earlier is the way to go.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, G needs to increase by about 61.666 to reach Y=600. But the options don't have that exactly. The closest is F:61.5.

But wait, let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the value of i when G increases. Let me try another approach.

The initial equilibrium is Y=500, i=2.

If G increases by ΔG, then Y will increase, and i will adjust accordingly.

We can model the change in Y as ΔY = ΔG + (some multiplier considering the effect on i).

But this seems a bit vague. Alternatively, using the IS-LM model.

The IS equation is Y = C + I + G = 100 +0.6Y +0.2Y -50i + G  
So Y =100 + G +0.8Y -50i  
→ Y -0.8Y=100 + G -50i  
→ 0.2Y=100 + G -50i  
→ Y=500 +5G -250i.

The LM equation is M_D = M_s: 0.25Y -30i=65  
→ 0.25Y=65 +30i  
→ Y=260 +120i.

So, setting IS=LM: 500 +5G -250i =260 +120i  
→ 500 +5G -260 = 370i  
→ 240 +5G =370i  
→ 5G =370i -240  
→ G=74i -48.

We want Y=600. So from LM: 600=260 +120i → i= (600-260)/120=340/120=17/6≈2.8333.

Then G=74*(17/6) -48.

Calculate 74*(17/6):

74 *17 = 1258.  
1258 /6≈209.6667.

Then G=209.6667 -48=161.6667.

So ΔG=161.6667 -100=61.6667, which is approximately 61.67. The closest option is F:61.5.

But wait, the options are given as A:80, B:75, C:55, D:90, E:50, F:61.5, G:70, H:85, I:100, J:65.

So F is 61.5, which is very close to 61.67. So the answer should be F.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using the expenditure multiplier.

The initial equilibrium is Y=500. The desired Y is 600, so ΔY=100.

The multiplier here would be 1/(1 - MPC + (MPC * tax rate adjustment?) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the IS-LM framework, the change in G needed to shift the IS curve to reach the desired Y.

The IS equation is Y=500 +5G -250i.

The LM equation is Y=260 +120i.

We want Y=600, so from LM: i= (600-260)/120=340/120≈2.8333.

Then, plugging into IS: 600=500 +5G -250*(17/6).

Calculate 250*(17/6)= (250*17)/6=4250/6≈708.333.

So 600=500 +5G -708.333  
→ 600=500 +5G -708.333  
→ 600= -208.333 +5G  
→ 5G=600 +208.333=808.333  
→ G=808.333/5=161.666, so ΔG=61.666.

Again, the same result. So I think the correct answer is F:61.5.
</think>

To close the deflationary gap and raise the equilibrium income from 500 to 600, the required change in government spending (ΔG) is approximately **61.5**. This is derived by solving the IS-LM model equations to determine the new equilibrium interest rate and corresponding government spending needed to achieve the target income.
