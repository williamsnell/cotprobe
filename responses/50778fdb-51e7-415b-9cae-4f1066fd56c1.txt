Okay, so I've got this question here: What is the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321? The options are A through J, with various numbers. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I remember that a factor of a number is another number that divides into it without leaving a remainder. The question is asking for the largest factor that's less than 54,321 itself. Well, the largest factor of any number, except the number itself, is the number divided by its smallest prime factor. So, I think I should start by finding if 54,321 has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let me check if 54,321 is a prime number. If it is, then the largest factor less than itself would be 1, but looking at the options, 1 isn't even there. So, it's probably not a prime.

I can try dividing 54,321 by some small primes to see if it's divisible. Let's start with 3. The sum of the digits of 54,321 is 5+4+3+2+1 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 54,321 is divisible by 3. Let me divide it: 54,321 ÷ 3 = 18,107. So, 3 is a factor, and 18,107 is another factor. Now, I should check if 18,107 is further divisible by any number.

Wait, but the options include 18,107 as option C. So, is 18,107 the correct answer? Or could there be a larger factor?

Wait, 54,321 divided by 3 is 18,107. But what's the largest factor less than 54,321? Well, factors come in pairs. So, if 3 is a factor, then 18,107 is the corresponding pair. But is there a larger factor than 18,107 that's still less than 54,321?

Hmm, let me think. The factors of 54,321 would include 1, 3, 18,107, and 54,321 itself. Are there any other factors? Let me check if 18,107 is prime. If it is, then 54,321 would have only those four factors. But if 18,107 is composite, then there might be larger factors.

Wait, 18,107. Let me try dividing it by 3 again. 1+8+1+0+7 = 17, which isn't divisible by 3. How about 7? 18,107 ÷ 7... Let's see: 7 goes into 18 two times (14), remainder 4. Bring down 1 to make 41. 7 into 41 is 5 times (35), remainder 6. Bring down 0 to make 60. 7 into 60 is 8 times (56), remainder 4. Bring down 7 to make 47. 7 into 47 is 6 times (42), remainder 5. So, not divisible by 7.

How about 11? The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. So, (1 + 1 + 7) - (8 + 0) = (9) - (8) = 1, which isn't divisible by 11. So, not divisible by 11.

What about 13? Let me try 18,107 ÷13. 13 into 18 is once, remainder 5. Bring down 1 to make 51. 13 into 51 is 3 times (39), remainder 12. Bring down 0 to make 120. 13 into 120 is 9 times (117), remainder 3. Bring down 7 to make 37. 13 into 37 is 2 times (26), remainder 11. So, nope, not divisible by 13.

This is getting time-consuming. Maybe another approach. Since 54,321 is 3 × 18,107, and if 18,107 is prime, then the factors are just 1, 3, 18,107, and 54,321. So the largest factor less than 54,321 would be 18,107, which is option C.

Wait, but let me check if 18,107 is indeed a prime. Alternatively, maybe 54,321 has a larger factor than 18,107 but less than itself. For example, if 54,321 is a square number, then its square root would be a factor, but 54,321's square root is around 233, since 233² is 54,289, which is close. Wait, 233² is 54,289, and 234² is 54,756, which is higher than 54,321. So, 54,321 isn't a perfect square, so the factors won't be around that number.

Alternatively, perhaps 54,321 is divisible by another number. Let me check 11. Wait, I already checked 18,107 for 11 and it didn't work. How about 54,321 ÷ 11? Let's do that. 11 into 54 is 4 times (44), remainder 10. Bring down 3 to make 103. 11 into 103 is 9 times (99), remainder 4. Bring down 2 to make 42. 11 into 42 is 3 times (33), remainder 9. Bring down 1 to make 91. 11 into 91 is 8 times (88), remainder 3. So, not divisible by 11.

How about 5? The last digit is 1, so no. 7? Let me check 54,321 ÷7. 7 into 54 is 7 times (49), remainder 5. Bring down 3 to make 53. 7 into 53 is 7 times (49), remainder 4. Bring down 2 to make 42. 7 into 42 is 6 times, remainder 0. Bring down 1. 7 into 1 is 0 times, so remainder 1. So, no, not divisible by 7.

Wait, but earlier I found that 54,321 is divisible by 3, giving 18,107, which is a factor. So, the factors are 1, 3, 18,107, 54,321. Therefore, the largest factor less than 54,321 is 18,107, which is option C. So, I think the answer is C.
