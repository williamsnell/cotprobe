Okay, so I need to find the forward rate f_{1,2} given the spot rates for 1 and 2 years, which are s1=6.3% and s2=6.9%. Hmm, I remember that the forward rate is related to the spot rates. I think it's calculated using the formula that involves the difference in the logarithmic returns or something like that. Wait, maybe it's based on the idea that the forward rate is the geometric mean of the two spot rates over the period.

Let me recall the formula. I think the forward rate formula is f_{1,2} = ( (1 + s2 * 2) / (1 + s1 * 1) )^(1/1) ) - 1. Wait, no, that might be for continuously compounded rates. Or is it the other way around? Maybe I'm mixing up the formulas for continuously compounded and annually compounded rates.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is f_{1,2} = ( (1 + s2 * 2) / (1 + s1) )^(1/(2-1)) ) -1. But wait, the denominators and numerators might be a bit different. Let me think again.

Oh right, the formula for the 1-year forward rate for the second year is derived from the relationship between the two-year spot rate and the one-year spot rate. The formula is f_{1,2} = ( (1 + s2 * 2) / (1 + s1) )^(1/1) ) -1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the exponents would be wrong. Let me correct that.

Actually, the correct formula is f_{1,2} = ( (1 + s2 * 2) / (1 + s1) )^(1/(2-1)) ) -1. But wait, 2-1 is 1, so it's just ( (1 + 2s2)/(1 + s1) ) -1. Is that right? Or maybe I should use the formula that involves the difference in the logs. Let me think.

Alternatively, using the formula: f_{1,2} = ( (1 + s2)^2 / (1 + s1) )^(1) ) -1. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me get the formula straight.

I think the formula is f_{1,2} = ( (1 + s2 * 2) / (1 + s1) )^(1/(2-1)) ) -1. Wait, but that's the same as before. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

s1 is 6.3%, so 0.063, and s2 is 6.9%, 0.069. So, 1 + s2 * 2 = 1 + 0.069 * 2 = 1.138. Wait, no, wait. Wait, s2 is the two-year spot rate. Oh wait, no, s2 is the two-year rate, so the two-year growth is (1 + s2)^2? Or is s2 the rate for two years, meaning it's applied over two years. So the formula is f_{1,2} = [(1 + s2)^2 / (1 + s1)]^(1/1) ) -1.

Wait, no, that would be (1 + s2)^2 / (1 + s1) then take the 1/(2-1) power, which is just 1. So the formula simplifies to ((1 + s2)^2 / (1 + s1)) -1. Let me compute that.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to write it as (1 + s2)^2 = (1 + s1)*(1 + f_{1,2}*1). Because the two-year return is the same as first year at s1 and then the next year at f_{1,2}.

So, (1 + s2)^2 = (1 + s1)*(1 + f_{1,2}).

So solving for f_{1,2}: f_{1,2} = ( (1 + s2)^2 / (1 + s1) ) -1.

Let me plug in the numbers. s2 is 6.9%, so 0.069. So 1 + s2 = 1.069. Squared, that's (1.069)^2 = let's calculate that. 1.069 *1.069 = approximately 1.1436. Let me do it more accurately: 1.069 *1.069. 1*1=1, 1*.069=0.069, 0.069*1=0.069, 0.069*0.069=0.004761. So adding up: 1 + 0.069 + 0.069 + 0.004761 = 1.142761.

So (1 + s2)^2 ≈ 1.142761.

Then, 1 + s1 is 1.063.

So (1.142761)/(1.063) = let me compute that. 1.142761 ÷ 1.063.

Hmm, 1.063 * 1.075 = let's see: 1.063 *1=1.063, 1.063 *0.07=0.07441, 1.063*0.005=0.005315. So total 1.063 +0.07441 +0.005315 = 1.142725. That's very close to 1.142761, so 1.063 *1.075 ≈1.142725. So 1.142761 /1.063 ≈1.075 or approximately 7.5%.

So f_{1,2} = 1.075 -1 =0.075. So 7.5%. Looking at the options, H is 0.075.

The forward rate \( f_{1,2} \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_{1,2} = \left( \frac{(1 + s_2)^2}{1 + s_1} \right) - 1
\]

Given \( s_1 = 6.3\% = 0.063 \) and \( s_2 = 6.9\% = 0.069 \), we compute:

\[
(1 + s_2)^2 = (1.069)^2 \approx 1.142761
\]
\[
1 + s_1 = 1.063
\]
\[
\frac{1.142761}{1.063} \approx 1.075
\]
\[
f_{1,2} = 1.075 - 1 = 0.075
\]

Thus, the forward rate is approximately \( 7.5\% \), corresponding to option **H**.
