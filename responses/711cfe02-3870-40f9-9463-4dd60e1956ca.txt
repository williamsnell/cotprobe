Question:

A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho

Options:

A: Development of polycythemia
B: Formation of antibodies to RhB
C: Development of lymphocytosis
D: Formation of antibodies to RhO
E: immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother?
F: Development of leukocytosis
G: Formation of antibodies to RhD
H: Development of anemia
I: Formation of antibodies to RhC
J: Development of natural killer cells

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about a pregnant woman and some treatment related to her blood type. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. The woman is 30 years old, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1. That means she's had two pregnancies, no live births, and one abortion. She's currently at 28 weeks' gestation. Her vital signs are normal, and the physical exam shows a uterus size consistent with 28 weeks. The fetal ultrasound shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative, and the father is B, Rh-positive.

The physician recommends administration of Rho immune globulin. The question is asking what this treatment is most likely to prevent in this mother.

The options are A through J, each suggesting a different outcome or condition.

I remember that Rho immune globulin, also known as Rho(D) immune globulin, is given to Rh-negative women during pregnancy to prevent Rh incompatibility. So, let's think about why that's given.

Rh incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive. The mother's immune system can produce antibodies against the baby's red blood cells, which can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). However, the mother's health can also be affected if she develops Rh sensitization.

In this case, the mother is Rh-negative, and the father is Rh-positive. So, there's a chance the baby could be Rh-positive. Since the mother is Rh-negative, her body might produce antibodies against the Rh-positive blood cells of the baby, especially if this is her second exposure to Rh-positive blood.

The first exposure usually happens during a previous pregnancy with an Rh-positive baby, but in this case, her previous pregnancy was a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks. Wait, but she's Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, so any children she has could be Rh-positive if the father contributes the Rh+ allele.

The key here is that if the mother's immune system is exposed to Rh-positive red blood cells, she might develop anti-RhD antibodies. These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause issues in the current pregnancy, like HDN in the baby. But the treatment with Rho immune globulin is meant to prevent the mother from developing these antibodies.

So, how does Rho immune globulin work? It's a type of immunoglobulin that contains antibodies against RhD. When given to an Rh-negative mother, it binds to any RhD antigens on the mother's red blood cells, preventing her immune system from reacting and producing her own antibodies. This is called passive immunization.

In this case, the woman hasn't had any prior exposure to Rh-positive blood except maybe in her previous abortion. But since she's Rh-negative, and the father is Rh-positive, the current pregnancy is at risk. Administering Rho immune globulin would prevent her from developing antibodies to RhD, which would otherwise cause problems in this pregnancy or future ones.

Looking at the options, option G is about the formation of antibodies to RhD. So, the treatment is meant to prevent her from forming these antibodies. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: Polycythemia is a condition with too many red blood cells, not directly related to Rh incompatibility. Unlikely.

Option B: Formation of antibodies to RhB. RhB is a different antigen, I think, but the main issue here is RhD. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: Lymphocytosis is increased white blood cells, not directly linked to Rh treatment. Probably not.

Option D: Anemia. While Rh incompatibility can cause anemia in the baby, the mother's treatment is about preventing her from developing antibodies, not treating anemia. So D might not be it.

Option E: That's the treatment given, so it's not an outcome but the intervention. So irrelevant for the question.

Option F: Leukocytosis is increased white blood cells again, unrelated to this scenario.

Option G: Formation of antibodies to RhD. Yes, this makes sense because Rho immune globulin prevents the mother from making these antibodies.

Option H: Anemia again, same as D.

Option I: RhC antibodies. I think RhC is another Rh antigen, but the main focus is RhD incompatibility in this context. So probably not I.

Option J: Natural killer cells. Not directly related to Rh treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer should be G: Formation of antibodies to RhD.

The correct answer is G: Formation of antibodies to RhD. Rho immune globulin is administered to Rh-negative mothers to prevent the formation of RhD antibodies, which could lead to complications in the pregnancy. 

Answer: G
