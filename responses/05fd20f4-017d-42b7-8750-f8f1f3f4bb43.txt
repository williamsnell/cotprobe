Question:

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?

Options:

A: Nitroprusside
B: Verapamil
C: Alteplase
D: Furosemide
E: Phentolamine
F: Atorvastatin
G: Carvedilol
H: Metoprolol
I: Lisinopril
J: Warfarin

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient who comes into the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the patient is a 25-year-old man with no significant medical history. He's never taken cocaine before, which is important because cocaine can have different effects on first-time users versus regular users. The vital signs are pretty concerning: blood pressure is 200/100 mmHg, which is really high. His pulse is 110, which is tachycardic, and he's diaphoretic, meaning he's sweating a lot, which can be a sign of anxiety or stress.

He reports chest pain rated 7/10, radiating to the left arm. That's a classic presentation of angina or a heart attack, but given the context of cocaine use, I need to consider what's happening here. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia without any ST-segment or T-wave changes, which is a bit confusing. Usually, a STEMI or unstable angina would show those changes, but here it's just sinus tachycardia. His oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, so that's okay, but the blood pressure is really high.

He received some treatments already: supplemental oxygen, aspirin 325 mg, IV nitroglycerin, and lorazepam. Despite that, he's still having chest pain and shortness of breath. So the initial treatments didn't fully help him.

Looking at the options for additional pharmacotherapy:

A: Nitroprusside – That's a vasodilator, often used in hypertensive emergencies. But he's already on IV nitroglycerin, which is also a vasodilator. Maybe if his blood pressure is still too high, but I'm not sure if this is the next step.

B: Verapamil – A calcium channel blocker, used for hypertension and sometimes in chest pain. It can help reduce blood pressure and decrease cardiac workload.

C: Alteplase – That's a clot-dissolving drug, used in heart attacks when there's a blockage. But his ECG doesn't show the signs of a STEMI, so maybe not.

D: Furosemide – A diuretic, used for fluid overload or high blood pressure. But he doesn't have edema or signs of heart failure on exam, so maybe not the best choice.

E: Phentolamine – Another vasodilator, often used in cases of cocaine-induced hypertension. It's an alpha-adrenergic blocker, which can help lower blood pressure quickly.

F: Atorvastatin – A statin, used for cholesterol lowering. Probably not relevant in the acute setting here.

G: Carvedilol – A beta-blocker with some alpha-blockade. It's used for hypertension and heart failure, but beta-blockers can sometimes worsen angina in some cases, especially if there's coronary artery disease.

H: Metoprolol – Another beta-blocker. Same concerns as carvedilol; might not be the first choice if there's ongoing chest pain.

I: Lisinopril – An ACE inhibitor, used for blood pressure and heart failure. Doesn't directly address the acute chest pain.

J: Warfarin – An anticoagulant, but again, without evidence of a clot or PE, probably not indicated.

So, the main issue here is cocaine-induced coronary artery vasospasm or hypertension leading to chest pain. Nitroglycerin is a nitrate, which works as a vasodilator. If it's not enough, maybe adding another vasodilator or a calcium channel blocker would help.

Verapamil (option B) is a calcium channel blocker that can reduce blood pressure and decrease the heart's workload. It's sometimes used in the setting of chest pain, especially if the patient doesn't respond to nitrates. Alternatively, phentolamine (E) is another option because it's an alpha-blocker, which can help in cases of cocaine-induced hypertension by blocking the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine.

Wait, but the initial treatment included IV nitroglycerin, which is a potent vasodilator. If that's not working, maybe adding a different type of vasodilator or a calcium channel blocker would be better. Verapamil is often used in Prinzmetal angina, which is caused by coronary artery spasm. Since the ECG shows no ST changes, maybe it's a spasm causing the pain.

Alternatively, phentolamine could be used in a hypertensive emergency, but the patient's blood pressure is 200/100, which is quite high. However, the main issue is the chest pain, so addressing the coronary spasm might be more important.

Another angle: the patient was given IV nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Lorazepam is for anxiety, but if the chest pain persists, it's possible the spasm isn't fully resolved. So adding a calcium channel blocker like verapamil could help relax the coronary arteries.

Wait, but verapamil can sometimes cause heart block, so it's used with caution. In an acute setting, maybe IV verapamil is given, but I'm not sure if that's the standard approach here.

Alternatively, if the patient's blood pressure is still too high despite nitroglycerin, adding phentolamine could help lower it more effectively, which might relieve the chest pain.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between B and E. Let me think about the standard treatments. In cocaine-induced chest pain, the initial treatment is usually nitrates and beta-blockers, but beta-blockers can sometimes be avoided in acute settings because of the risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects. Alternatively, calcium channel blockers can be used, especially if the patient doesn't respond to nitrates.

So, perhaps verapamil (B) would be the next step. It can help reduce the spasm in the coronary arteries and lower blood pressure. Alternatively, phentolamine could help with the hypertension but might not directly address the coronary issue.

Wait, but the question mentions that despite therapy with nitroglycerin and others, the pain persists. So maybe the issue is that the nitroglycerin isn't working, possibly due to tolerance or the cause being something else like spasm. So adding a calcium channel blocker like verapamil could be the next step.

Alternatively, if the blood pressure is really high, using a different vasodilator like nitroprusside (A) could be considered, but he's already on IV nitroglycerin.

Hmm, but the options don't have nitroprusside as the first choice. So considering the options, B: Verapamil seems like a plausible answer. Or E: Phentolamine.

Wait, another thought: the patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia. High blood pressure and anxiety can cause that. If the chest pain is due to increased cardiac workload from high BP, then using a vasodilator to lower BP would help. But nitrates didn't help enough, so maybe adding a different one.

Phentolamine is used in cases of cocaine-induced hypertension because it's an alpha-adrenergic blocker, which can reverse the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine. So perhaps that's the better option here.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again: the patient's main issues are chest pain, high BP, tachycardia, and no response to initial treatments. So adding a different vasodilator might be needed.

Between E and B, I'm leaning towards E: Phentolamine because it specifically targets the alpha-adrenergic effects caused by cocaine, which can cause intense vasoconstriction. So using phentolamine could help lower BP and relieve the chest pain caused by the increased cardiac workload.

Alternatively, verapamil would help with coronary artery spasm, which could be another cause of the chest pain. But without ST changes, maybe it's more about the hypertension causing the symptoms.

I think I'll go with E: Phentolamine as the additional therapy.

The patient is a 25-year-old man presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time. His vital signs indicate severe hypertension (200/100 mmHg), tachycardia (110/min), and diaphoresis. Despite initial treatments with IV nitroglycerin, aspirin, and lorazepam, his symptoms persist. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, suggesting no acute coronary ischemia but possibly coronary artery vasospasm or cocaine-induced hypertension.

Cocaine use can cause intense vasoconstriction and increased cardiac workload, leading to chest pain. The initial treatments aim to reduce blood pressure and relieve chest pain, but the lack of response suggests the need for additional therapy. Among the options, **phentolamine (E)** is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that can reverse the vasoconstriction caused by cocaine, effectively lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiac workload. While verapamil (B) could address coronary artery spasm, the primary issue here appears to be the severe hypertension and its impact on chest pain. Therefore, phentolamine is the most appropriate next step.

Answer: E
