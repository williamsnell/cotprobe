Okay, so I've got this question about directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. I'm a bit rusty on my graph theory, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says, given a finite DAG G with |E| > 0, which of the statements I, II, III must be true. The options are A to J, each combining these statements.

First, let me recall what a DAG is. A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That means there's no way to start at a vertex and follow the edges to come back to it. So, DAGs are kind of like a hierarchy or a timeline where you can't loop back.

Now, the statements:

I. G has a vertex with no incoming edge.
II. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.
III. G has an isolated vertex, one with neither incoming nor outgoing edges.

I think I remember that in a DAG, there's at least one source and at least one sink. A source is a vertex with no incoming edges, and a sink is one with no outgoing edges. But wait, is that always true?

Let me think. If the graph is a single vertex, but the question says |E| > 0, so that's not possible. So G has at least one edge. So for a DAG with edges, can it have no sources or sinks?

Wait, no. Because if there's a cycle, but since it's a DAG, there are no cycles. So the graph must have a topological order. In a topological order, the first vertex has no incoming edges (so it's a source), and the last vertex has no outgoing edges (a sink). So I and II must be true.

So I is true, II is true. Now what about III? Does it have an isolated vertex? An isolated vertex has no edges at all, neither incoming nor outgoing.

Wait, in a DAG with |E|>0, could all vertices have at least one incoming or outgoing edge? Like, suppose every vertex has at least one edge. Is that possible?

Let me think of a simple example. Consider two vertices A and B, with an edge from A to B. Then A has no incoming edges (so I is true), and B has no outgoing edges (so II is true). Neither is isolated because each has at least one edge. So in this case, III is false because there's no isolated vertex.

Another example: three vertices A->B, B->C. Then A is a source (no incoming), C is a sink (no outgoing). All vertices have at least one edge, so no isolated vertices. So III is false in this case.

Wait, but what if the graph has more edges? Like A->B, B->C, and maybe A->C. But that doesn't change the fact that no vertex is isolated. So in this case, III isn't necessarily true.

So III doesn't have to be true, but I and II must be true. So the correct statements are I and II only.

Looking back at the options, option C says I and II only. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: I and II only. 

In a finite directed acyclic graph (DAG) with |E| > 0, there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges (a source) and at least one vertex with no outgoing edges (a sink). However, it is not necessary for the graph to have an isolated vertex, as shown by examples where all vertices have at least one edge. 

Answer: C
