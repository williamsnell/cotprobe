Question:

Berscheid’s (1983) emotion-in-relationship model proposes that strong positive emotions are LESS likely to be elicited during the later stages of an intimate relationship than in its initial stages because:

Options:

F: in the later stages, each partner's behavior has become more predictable.
G: over time, partners become more independent and less reliant on each other for emotional support.
H: in the later stages, each partner is more focused on their own emotional needs.
I: in the later stages, each partner has less emotional investment in the relationship.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Berscheid’s (1983) emotion-in-relationship model. The question is asking why strong positive emotions are less likely to be elicited during the later stages of an intimate relationship compared to the initial stages. The options are labeled A to I, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should recall what Berscheid's model says. From what I remember, Berscheid's work discusses how emotions in relationships change over time. The initial stages of a relationship are usually filled with strong positive emotions because of the excitement, novelty, and the "honeymoon period." As the relationship progresses, these emotions might diminish. But why is that?

Looking at the options:

A: over time, partners become more emotionally distant due to familiarity. Hmm, this sounds plausible. Familiarity can sometimes lead to taking each other for granted, which might reduce strong emotions. But I'm not sure if this is the exact reason Berscheid proposed.

B: "over time, people become ""emotionally immune"" to the behaviors of others." Emotional immunity sounds like they stop feeling strong emotions because they're used to each other's behaviors. That rings a bell. I think Berscheid talked about how people become less reactive because they're too familiar, which would reduce those strong positive feelings.

C: later stages have more erratic behavior. I don't think that's right. Relationships usually stabilize rather than becoming erratic. So probably not C.

D: partners work harder to be sensitive. This sounds more like a positive thing, which might actually increase positive emotions, but I don't think that's the case here. The question says positive emotions are less likely, so D might not be the answer.

E: partners become more self-centered. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason. Self-centeredness could lead to less emotional investment, but I'm not certain.

F: behavior becomes more predictable. So, if partners' behaviors are predictable, maybe the surprise and excitement that create strong emotions fade away. That could make sense. Predictability might reduce the intensity of emotions because there's less novelty.

G: partners become more independent. If they rely less on each other, perhaps they don't feel the same strong emotions. But I'm not sure if this is the main point Berscheid made.

H: focused on their own needs. Similar to E, but again, I'm not sure if this is the main reason.

I: less emotional investment. If they invest less emotionally, then strong emotions would decrease. But does Berscheid's model focus on investment, or more on predictability or emotional immunity?

I think the key is in the emotional response. Berscheid's model suggests that as relationships become more stable, the emotional highs decrease because the partners are more predictable and familiar. So, the initial stages have a lot of excitement and surprise, which are sources of strong emotions. As time goes on, these factors diminish, leading to fewer strong positive emotions.

So, looking at the options again, B talks about being emotionally immune, which would mean they don't feel as strongly because they're used to each other. F says behavior becomes more predictable, which might reduce the emotional highs because there's less of the novel or exciting behavior.

Wait, but the question is about strong positive emotions being less likely. So, if partners are more predictable, maybe the positive emotions are less intense because the behaviors that once excited them are now routine. Alternatively, if they become emotionally immune, they might not feel as strongly because they're no longer as emotionally reactive.

I think both B and F could be candidates, but I need to figure out which one Berscheid emphasized. From what I recall, Berscheid's model talks about how the initial stages have high positive emotions because of the excitement and the exploration of the relationship. As time passes, the relationship becomes more routine, and the strong emotions fade because the partners have become emotionally immune or because their behavior is more predictable, leading to less emotional response.

Wait, let me think again. Emotional immunity (option B) refers to being less responsive to each other's behaviors because they've become too familiar. So, the same actions that once brought joy now don't have the same impact because you're 'immune' to them. That seems to fit the idea of why positive emotions would decrease.

On the other hand, predictable behavior (F) might also lead to less strong emotions, but I think the key term Berscheid used was about becoming emotionally immune. So, I think the answer is B.

The correct answer is **B**. Berscheid’s model suggests that as relationships progress, individuals become "emotionally immune" to their partner's behaviors due to familiarity, leading to a reduction in strong positive emotions.

Answer: B
