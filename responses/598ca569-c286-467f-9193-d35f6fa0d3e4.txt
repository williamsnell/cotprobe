Question:

Say the incidence of a disease D is about 5 cases per 100 people (i.e., P(D) = 0.05). Let Boolean random variable D mean a patient “has disease D” and let Boolean random variable TP stand for "tests positive." Tests for disease D are known to be very accurate in the sense that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, and the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97. What is P(TP), the prior probability of testing positive.

Options:

A: 0.051
B: 0.091
C: 0.0368
D: 0.025
E: None of the above
F: 0.473
G: All of the above
H: 0.099
I: 0.078
J: 0.065

Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about calculating the prior probability of testing positive for a disease D. The incidence rate is given as 5 cases per 100 people, so P(D) is 0.05. There are two Boolean random variables: D for having the disease and TP for testing positive. 

The test characteristics are as follows: the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, which is the true positive rate or sensitivity. The probability of testing negative when you don't have the disease is 0.97, which means the false positive rate is 1 - 0.97 = 0.03.

I need to find P(TP), which is the overall probability of testing positive in the population. From what I remember, this involves considering both the true positives and the false positives.

So, the formula should be P(TP) = P(TP|D) * P(D) + P(TP|¬D) * P(¬D). 

Breaking this down:
- P(TP|D) is the sensitivity, which is 0.99.
- P(D) is the prevalence, which is 0.05.
- P(TP|¬D) is the false positive rate, which is 0.03.
- P(¬D) is 1 - P(D) = 0.95.

Now plugging in the numbers:
True positives = 0.99 * 0.05 = 0.0495
False positives = 0.03 * 0.95 = 0.0285

Adding these together gives the total P(TP) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078.

Wait, let me double-check that. Because 0.0495 plus 0.0285 is indeed 0.078. So looking at the options, I see option I is 0.078. 

But wait, I should make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let me recalculate each part.

0.99 * 0.05: 0.05 * 1 is 0.05, so 0.05 * 0.99 is 0.0495. Correct.

0.03 * 0.95: Hmm, 0.03 * 0.95. Let's see, 0.03 * 0.9 is 0.027, and 0.03 * 0.05 is 0.0015, so adding those gives 0.027 + 0.0015 = 0.0285. Yes, that's right.

Adding 0.0495 and 0.0285: 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078. So that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option I is 0.078. So the answer should be I.

The prior probability of testing positive, P(TP), is calculated by considering both true positives and false positives. Using the given values, P(TP) = (0.99 * 0.05) + (0.03 * 0.95) = 0.078.

Answer: I
