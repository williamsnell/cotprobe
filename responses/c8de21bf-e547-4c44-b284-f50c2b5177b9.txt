Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about conductors and charges. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The problem says: An isolated conductor has a net charge of +10 microcoulombs and a cavity with a particle of charge q = +3.0 microcoulombs. We need to find the charge on the cavity wall.

Wait, isolated conductor. So that means it's not connected to anything else, right? So any charges inside will affect the charges on the walls.

I remember something about conductors and the charges they hold. When a conductor is isolated, the charges can move freely. If there's a charge inside a cavity, the inner walls of the cavity will have an induced charge opposite to that inside charge. But wait, how does that work exactly?

Oh right, the cavity is inside the conductor. So the particle with charge +3.0 microcoulombs is inside the cavity. Since the conductor is a metal, the charges can move. The presence of the +3 C inside the cavity will induce a charge on the inner wall of the conductor. The inner wall must have an equal and opposite charge to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner wall should have -3.0 microcoulombs.

But wait, the conductor has a net charge of +10 microcoulombs. How does that factor in? Oh, because the conductor as a whole must have a net charge, which comes from the charges on the outer surface and the inner cavity.

So the total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charges on the inner cavity wall and the outer surface. Let me think: the conductor's net charge is the charge on the outer surface plus the charge on the inner surface (since the inner surface is inside the conductor, but wait, no, the inner surface is inside the cavity, but the conductor's charges move. So the inner surface has an induced charge of -3.0 microcoulombs, and the outer surface must then have a charge that, when added to the inner, gives the net charge of +10.

So, total conductor charge = charge on outer surface + charge on inner surface. Wait, no: the inner surface's charge is -3.0, and the outer surface's charge plus the inner's equals the conductor's total.

Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is the outer surface charge. Because the inner surface's charge is induced by the cavity's charge and is part of the conductor.

Let me get this straight. The conductor has a net charge of +10. The cavity has a charge of +3. The inner cavity wall must have an induced charge of -3 to cancel the field in the conductor's material. Now, the outer surface of the conductor must carry the remaining charge so that the total is +10.

So the outer surface charge (Q_outer) plus the inner surface charge (Q_inner) should equal the total charge of the conductor. Wait, no, because the inner surface's charge is part of the conductor's charges. So the conductor's total charge is Q_outer + Q_inner. But wait, no, the inner surface's charge is -3, and the outer surface's charge is what's left after considering that.

Wait, no, think again. The conductor's net charge is the charge on the outer surface. Because the inner surface's charge is induced and is part of the conductor. So the total charge of the conductor is the charge on the outer surface. But wait, the conductor's net charge is given as +10. So the outer surface must be +10. But then the inner surface is -3.0, so the sum of the outer and inner is +10 (outer) plus (-3) inner, but wait, no, because the conductor's charge is just the outer surface. Because the inner surface's charge is induced and part of the conductor's total, but the total given is the conductor's charge, which includes both inner and outer.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the principle. The charge on the inner surface of the conductor must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. So Q_inner = -q_cavity = -3.0 microC.

The conductor's total charge is the sum of the charges on the outer surface and the inner surface, but wait, no. Because the conductor's net charge is the sum of the charge on the outer surface and the inner surface. But wait, the inner surface's charge is part of the conductor's total charge. So the conductor's net charge is Q_outer + Q_inner.

Given that, the conductor's net charge is +10 microC. Q_inner is -3.0 microC, so Q_outer must be +13.0 microC to make the sum +10.

Wait, no. Because +13 + (-3) = +10. That makes sense. So the outer surface charge is +13 microC, and the inner is -3.

But wait, the question is asking for the charge on the cavity wall, which is the inner surface. So the charge on the cavity wall is -3.0 microC. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B is -3.0 Ã—10^-6 C, but wait, looking at the options: Option B is written as " -3.0 10^{-6} C" which I think is a typo, but probably -3.0e-6 C, same as -3 microC.

Wait, but I thought the outer surface would be +13, but the question is about the cavity wall, which is the inner surface, so -3.0.

Wait, but another approach: Gauss's law. The electric field inside the conductor must be zero. So the charges inside the cavity will induce a charge on the inner surface of the conductor, equal and opposite. So the inner surface is -3 microC. The outer surface then would be the total charge of the conductor plus the inner's charge. No, wait, the conductor's net charge is the sum of the inner and outer. So conductor's charge is Q = Q_inner + Q_outer. So Q_outer = Q - Q_inner = 10e-6 - (-3e-6) = 13e-6. So the inner is -3e-6, outer is +13e-6.

So the cavity wall (inner surface) is -3e-6 C. So the answer should be option B, which is -3.0e-6 C.

The problem involves an isolated conductor with a net charge of $+10 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$ and a cavity containing a particle of charge $q = +3.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$. To determine the charge on the cavity wall, we analyze the induced charges.

When a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity wall to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Thus, the charge on the inner surface (cavity wall) is $-3.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$.

The conductor's total charge is the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Since the conductor's net charge is $+10 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$ and the inner surface has $-3.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$, the charge on the outer surface must be $+13.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$ to satisfy the total charge. However, the question specifically asks for the charge on the cavity wall, which is the inner surface.

From the options provided, the charge on the cavity wall corresponds to **Option B: $-3.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$**.

Answer: B
