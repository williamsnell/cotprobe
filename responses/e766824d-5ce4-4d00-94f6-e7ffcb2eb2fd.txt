Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the heat of dilution for ethanol. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me two heat of solution values at 77°F. The first is ΔH = -4.45 Btu/mole when the solution is X(C)2(H)5(OH) = 1/6. The second is ΔH = -6.66 Btu/mole for X(C)2(H)5(OH) = 1/10. I'm supposed to find the heat of dilution when going from the more concentrated to the more diluted solution, per mole of ethanol.

Wait, so the more concentrated solution is 1/6, and the more diluted is 1/10. Dilution means moving from higher concentration to lower, so from 1/6 to 1/10. The heat of dilution would be the heat change when this happens.

I remember that the heat of solution (ΔH soln) is the enthalpy change when a solute dissolves in a solvent. But when you dilute a solution, you're effectively adding more solvent, so maybe the heat of dilution is related to the difference in heat of solution between two concentrations.

Let me think about how this works. If I have a solution at a certain concentration and I dilute it, the process can be thought of as dissolving the same amount of solute in more solvent. So the heat of dilution (ΔH dilution) would be the heat released or absorbed when the solution goes from the more concentrated to the more diluted state.

So, if I have two concentrations, say C1 and C2, where C1 is more concentrated than C2, the heat of dilution would be the difference in their heat of solutions. But wait, I'm not sure if it's just the difference or if I need to consider the moles involved.

Let me think in terms of equations. Suppose the heat of solution for concentration C1 is ΔH1, and for C2 is ΔH2. Then, when you dilute from C1 to C2, you're effectively adding more solvent, which would involve dissolving the same amount of solute in more solvent. So the heat change for dilution would be the difference between ΔH2 and ΔH1, but I need to check the signs.

Wait, no. Because when you dilute, you're not dissolving more solute; you're just adding more solvent. So the process is similar to dissolving the same amount of solute in a larger amount of solvent. So the heat of dilution would be the heat released or absorbed when that happens.

Alternatively, maybe the heat of dilution can be calculated as the difference between the two heats of solution, but scaled appropriately.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say I have a certain amount of ethanol in a solution. When I dilute it, I'm effectively dissolving the same amount of ethanol in a larger volume of water. So the heat of dilution would be the heat of solution when the ethanol is dissolved in the additional amount of water needed to reach the more diluted solution.

Alternatively, another approach is that the heat of dilution per mole is the difference between the heat of solution at the two concentrations, divided by the moles of ethanol involved.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think in terms of the data given.

We have two data points: at 1/6 concentration, ΔH is -4.45 Btu/mole; at 1/10 concentration, ΔH is -6.66 Btu/mole.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the way the data is presented is a bit confusing. It says for X(C)2(H)5(OH) = 1/6, ΔH = -4.45 Btu/mole. And for X(C)2(H)5(OH) = 1/10, ΔH = -6.66 Btu/mole.

Wait, X(C)2(H)5(OH) — could that be the formula for something else? Maybe it's a typo or perhaps an alternative way of writing ethanol. Let me check. Ethanol is C2H5OH, which can also be written as C2H6O. So X might represent ethanol. So X(C)2(H)5(OH) is probably ethanol, C2H5OH. So the X is probably a typo or placeholder.

So the data is for ethanol in solution at concentrations 1/6 and 1/10. So, for example, when ethanol is dissolved in a solution where its mole fraction is 1/6, the heat of solution is -4.45 Btu/mole. Similarly, at 1/10, it's -6.66 Btu/mole.

Wait, but how does the concentration relate to the heat of solution? Typically, the heat of solution is per mole of solute, so I think the given ΔH is per mole of ethanol.

Now, the question is about the heat of dilution when going from the more concentrated solution (1/6) to the more diluted (1/10). So we're moving from higher concentration (1/6) to lower (1/10).

So the process is: starting with a 1/6 solution, we dilute it to a 1/10 solution. The heat of dilution would be the heat change associated with this process.

But how do we calculate this? I think I need to find the difference in heat of solution between the two concentrations, but considering the moles involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat of dilution is calculated by the formula:

ΔH_dilution = n2 * ΔH2 - n1 * ΔH1

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the difference in heat of solution per mole of ethanol between the two concentrations.

Wait, another approach: when you dilute a solution, you're effectively dissolving the same amount of solute in a larger amount of solvent. So the heat of dilution would be the heat released or absorbed when the same amount of ethanol dissolves in more water to reach the lower concentration.

So perhaps the heat of dilution is the difference between the two heats of solution, but scaled by the amount of ethanol.

Wait, but both ΔH values are given per mole of ethanol. So if I have one mole of ethanol, when it's in a 1/6 solution, the heat is -4.45 Btu; when it's in a 1/10 solution, the heat is -6.66 Btu.

But wait, that can't be right, because the heat of solution should depend on the amount of solvent. Or perhaps the given ΔH is the heat when dissolving in a specific amount of solvent, which changes with concentration.

Wait, maybe I should consider the heat of solution per mole of ethanol as a function of concentration. So if I have a more concentrated solution, the heat of solution is less (since it's easier to dissolve when there's more solvent?), but wait, the given data shows that as the concentration increases (from 1/10 to 1/6), the heat of solution becomes less negative. Wait, no: 1/6 is more concentrated than 1/10, and -4.45 is higher (less negative) than -6.66.

So, the more concentrated solution (1/6) has a less negative ΔH than the more diluted solution (1/10). That suggests that dissolving ethanol in a more concentrated solution releases less heat than when dissolved in a more diluted solution. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because in a more concentrated solution, there's less solvent available, so the solute might have a harder time dissolving, possibly releasing more heat. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the given ΔH is the enthalpy change when the solution is made, so for each mole of ethanol, the heat released or absorbed when the solution is made at that concentration.

So, when you go from a more concentrated solution to a more diluted one, you're effectively adding more solvent to the same amount of solute. So the process would involve dissolving the same amount of ethanol in more water, which would have a certain heat effect.

So, to find the heat of dilution, perhaps I need to calculate the difference in heat of solution between the two concentrations, but considering the change in the amount of solvent.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider that the heat of dilution is the heat change when you take a solution and dilute it. So, for example, if I have a solution at concentration C1 and I dilute it to C2, the heat change would be the difference in the heat of solution at these two concentrations, multiplied by the moles of ethanol.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_dilution = (ΔH2 - ΔH1) per mole of ethanol.

In this case, ΔH1 is -4.45 (for 1/6) and ΔH2 is -6.66 (for 1/10). So ΔH2 - ΔH1 = (-6.66) - (-4.45) = -2.21 Btu/mole.

But wait, wait a second. The process of dilution would involve going from a more concentrated solution to a more diluted one. So if the heat of solution becomes more negative when the solution is more diluted, that suggests that dissolving the same amount of ethanol in more solvent releases more heat. So when you dilute, you're adding more solvent, which would lead to more heat being released (since ΔH is negative, exothermic).

So the heat of dilution would be the heat change when moving from 1/6 to 1/10, which is the difference in ΔH. So if moving from 1/6 to 1/10, the heat change is ΔH2 - ΔH1 = (-6.66) - (-4.45) = -2.21 Btu/mole.

But wait, that would mean the heat of dilution is -2.21 Btu/mole, which is option E.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the process. When you dilute, you're effectively dissolving the same amount of ethanol in more water, so the heat of solution at the lower concentration minus the heat of solution at the higher concentration would give the heat of dilution.

So, the heat of dilution would be (ΔH_lower_conc - ΔH_higher_conc) per mole of ethanol. So that's (-6.66) - (-4.45) = -2.21 Btu/mole, which is option E.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If I have a solution at 1/6 concentration, and I dilute it to 1/10, I'm adding more solvent. So the process is: the solution at 1/6 concentration is diluted to 1/10. The heat of dilution would be the heat associated with this process.

The heat of dilution can be calculated as the difference in the heat of solution between the two concentrations. Since the solution is becoming more diluted, the heat of solution becomes more negative, meaning more heat is released. So the heat of dilution would be the heat released when moving to a more diluted solution.

So, the calculation would be ΔH_dilution = ΔH2 - ΔH1 = (-6.66) - (-4.45) = -2.21 Btu/mole.

Looking at the options, option E is -2.21 Btu/mole.

To calculate the heat of dilution when moving from a more concentrated ethanol solution (1/6 concentration, ΔH = -4.45 Btu/mole) to a more diluted solution (1/10 concentration, ΔH = -6.66 Btu/mole), we consider the difference in heat of solution between the two concentrations. The heat of dilution is the heat change associated with dissolving the same amount of ethanol in a larger amount of solvent, which corresponds to the difference in ΔH values.

The formula used is:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{dilution}} = \Delta H_{\text{2}} - \Delta H_{\text{1}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{dilution}} = (-6.66) - (-4.45) = -2.21 \, \text{Btu/mole}
\]

This result indicates that the process of dilution releases heat, as the heat of dilution is negative. Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

**E: -2.21 Btu/mole**
