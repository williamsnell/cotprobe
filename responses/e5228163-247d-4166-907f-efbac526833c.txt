Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly states when the effect of the spending multiplier is lessened. Hmm. I remember that the spending multiplier refers to how an initial increase in spending leads to a larger increase in overall economic output. But wait, the question is about when its effect is lessened. So, what factors would reduce the impact of the multiplier effect?

I think the spending multiplier is part of Keynesian economics, where an increase in spending, say by the government, leads to higher income and consumption, which further boosts aggregate demand. But if certain conditions are met, this effect might be weaker.

Let me recall the formula for the multiplier. It's 1 divided by (1 minus the marginal propensity to consume, MPC). So, if MPC is high, the multiplier is larger. But that's about the size of the multiplier, not when its effect is lessened.

Wait, the spending multiplier effect is lessened when the economy can't respond as much to the increased spending. That might happen in different scenarios. Like, if the economy is already at full employment, increasing spending won't lead to more output because there are no available resources. Or, if prices rise, maybe because of sticky wages or other factors, that could affect the multiplier.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Price level rises with a decrease in aggregate demand. Hmm, not sure. If AD decreases, price level might fall, but this says it rises. Maybe if AD decreases but prices go up, perhaps due to supply constraints. But how does that affect the multiplier? If AD decreases, maybe the economy is not in a position to respond to more spending, so the multiplier effect would be less. Wait, but this option is about a decrease in AD leading to a price rise. That could be a case of cost-push inflation, where higher prices occur despite lower demand. But I'm not sure how that directly affects the multiplier.

Option B: Price level is constant with a decrease in AD. So, if AD decreases but prices stay the same, that might mean the economy is operating in a region where prices are sticky, and output can decrease without affecting prices much. How does that impact the multiplier? If the price level is constant, perhaps the real money supply changes, affecting interest rates and investment. But I'm not quite sure.

Option C: Price level rises with an increase in AD. That sounds like demand-pull inflation. If AD increases and prices rise, the economy might be near full employment, so the multiplier effect is lessened because the increase in spending leads to higher prices rather than higher output. That makes sense because when the economy is at full capacity, more spending can't increase output; it just drives up prices. So the multiplier effect is weaker because the output effect is limited.

Option D: Price level is constant with a decrease in LRAS. Long-run aggregate supply decreasing would mean the economy's potential output is lower. If AD decreases but price level is constant, maybe because the economy is adjusting in the short run. Not sure how this affects the multiplier. Maybe if LRAS is lower, the multiplier could be smaller because the economy can't produce as much.

Option E: Price level is constant with an increase in AD. So, if AD increases but prices don't change, this might mean that output increases without inflation. That would actually amplify the multiplier effect, not lessen it. Because more spending leads to more output without price increases, so the multiplier is strong here.

Option F: Price level falls with an increase in supply. If AS increases and prices fall, that could lead to lower inflation or even deflation. But how does that affect the multiplier? If prices are falling, maybe consumers delay spending, which could reduce the multiplier effect. Or perhaps if AS increases, the economy can produce more without price increases, so the multiplier might be stronger because more spending leads to more output. Not sure.

Option G: Price level constant with an increase in short-run AS. If SRAS increases and price level stays the same, that might mean more output without inflation. So, the multiplier effect would be stronger because the increase in spending can lead to more output. So this wouldn't be the case where the multiplier is lessened.

Option H: Price level constant with an increase in long-run AS. If LRAS increases, the economy can produce more. So, if AD increases and LRAS also increases, maybe the multiplier effect is stronger because the economy can respond more. So this isn't the scenario where the multiplier is lessened.

Option I: Price level decreases with a decrease in AD. If AD decreases and prices fall, that could indicate a recession. But how does that affect the multiplier? If prices are falling, perhaps consumers spend less, which could amplify the decrease in AD, but I'm not sure how that directly lessens the multiplier effect.

Option J: Price level falls with a decrease in AS. If AS decreases, that could lead to higher prices, but this option says prices fall. Maybe if AS decreases but somehow prices fall, perhaps due to reduced demand. Not sure how that affects the multiplier.

Going back, I think the key is when the economy's response to increased spending is blunted. If the price level rises when AD increases (Option C), that suggests the economy is at or near full employment. So the multiplier effect is lessened because the increase in spending doesn't lead to as much output increase as it would in a slack economy. Instead, it causes inflation.

Alternatively, another scenario where the multiplier is lessened is when prices are sticky. If prices don't fall when AD decreases, that could mean that the real value of money changes, affecting the multiplier. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the spending multiplier effect is about the change in real GDP resulting from a change in spending. If the economy is in a situation where prices are rising, maybe due to cost-push factors, the effectiveness of the multiplier could be reduced because the increase in spending is absorbed by higher prices rather than leading to more production.

So, looking again, Option C says the price level rises with an increase in aggregate demand. That fits the scenario where the multiplier is lessened because the economy is operating near full capacity, and increased demand leads to inflation rather than higher output. So the multiplier effect is lessened because the output response is dampened.

Alternatively, another factor is the availability of resources. If the economy is at full employment, increasing spending won't lead to more production, only higher prices. So, that's when the multiplier effect is reduced.

So, the correct answer should be Option C.
</think>

The spending multiplier effect is lessened when the economy's response to increased spending is blunted, often due to the economy operating near full capacity. In such cases, an increase in aggregate demand leads to a rise in the price level rather than a significant increase in output. This occurs because resources are fully employed, and firms cannot expand production to meet higher demand without raising prices. Therefore, the correct answer is when the price level rises with an increase in aggregate demand.
