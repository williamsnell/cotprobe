Question:

A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?

Options:

A: Deltoid
B: Infraspinatus
C: Supraspinatus
D: Triceps Brachii
E: Subscapularis
F: Coracobrachialis
G: Teres Major
H: Pectoralis
I: Brachialis
J: Biceps Brachii

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient with shoulder pain. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 45-year-old man who came in with right shoulder pain after chopping wood two days ago. Chopping wood is probably an activity that involves a lot of repetitive or forceful shoulder movements, maybe some overhead work or twisting. That makes sense because shoulder pain often comes from overuse or specific movements.

When the doctor examined him, there were no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. So it's probably not a fracture or a clear bony issue. The pain is reproduced when he externally rotates his shoulder against resistance. Externally rotating the shoulder... Hmm, which muscles are involved in that?

Wait, external rotation of the shoulder is typically done by the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. Both of these are part of the rotator cuff. The question says that besides the teres minor, which other tendon is likely inflamed. So the options include several tendons, but I need to think about which one would cause pain on external rotation.

Supraspinatus is more about abduction, like lifting the arm out to the side. If the teres minor is already mentioned, and the pain is on external rotation, then the infraspinatus is a likely suspect. Because both are involved in rotation. The supraspinatus might be a trap, but it's more about the upward movement.

Also, the patient has no weakness, so it's probably not a complete tear but more of a strain or tendinitis.

Looking at the options, the question is which tendon is inflamed along with teres minor. So the main other one is infraspinatus. Let me check the options. Option B is infraspinatus, C is supraspinatus. So B would be the answer.

The patient's shoulder pain after chopping wood suggests an overuse injury. External rotation against resistance is a key movement that involves the infraspinatus and teres minor tendons. Since the teres minor is already mentioned, the most likely inflamed tendon is the infraspinatus. 

Answer: B
