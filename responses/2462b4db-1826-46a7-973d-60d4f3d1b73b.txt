Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Suppose that 100 separate firms were tested to determine how many of them "beat the market" using a Jensen-type regression, and it is found that 3 fund managers significantly do so. Does this suggest prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency?

Options:

A: The results would be different if a different type of regression was used
B: This suggests evidence for stock market efficiency, not inefficiency
C: Yes
D: In order to answer this question, you would need to test every fund manager trading in that market
E: There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.
F: No
G: The results are inconclusive without knowing the performance of the market as a whole
H: It's impossible to draw conclusions based on the performance of only 100 firms
I: This indicates that the majority of fund managers do not significantly beat the market
J: This suggests that only a small percentage of fund managers can beat the market

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether some fund managers beating the market suggests that the stock market is inefficient. Let me try to break this down.

First, the question says that 100 firms were tested using a Jensen-type regression, and 3 fund managers significantly beat the market. The question is whether this is prima facie evidence for market inefficiency.

Hmm, I remember that Jensen's alpha is a measure used in performance evaluation. It's part of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), right? If a fund manager has a positive Jensen's alpha, it means that they're outperforming the market after adjusting for risk. So, in this case, 3 out of 100 managers are doing that.

Wait, but what does that imply about the market's efficiency? I think efficient markets are supposed to be hard to beat because all information is already priced in. So if many managers are beating the market, it would suggest inefficiency because there are opportunities to exploit. But here, only 3 out of 100 are doing so. That seems like a small number.

But the question is whether this is prima facie evidence. Prima facie means "at first glance." So, on the surface, does having a few managers beat the market indicate inefficiency? I'm not so sure. Maybe it's just that those 3 are good, but the majority aren't. Or perhaps it's due to luck or short-term performance, not necessarily inefficiency.

I also recall that the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) comes in different forms: weak, semi-strong, and strong. Each deals with different types of information being reflected in prices. But regardless, if most managers aren't beating the market, it supports EMH because it's hard to find consistent outperformers.

So, looking at the options:

Option C says "Yes," implying that it does suggest inefficiency. Option F says "No," suggesting it doesn't support inefficiency. Option I says that the majority don't beat the market, which is true but doesn't directly answer about efficiency. Option G says we need to know the market's performance as a whole, which I'm not sure about. Option E says there's insufficient info, but the question gives specific numbers, so maybe not.

Wait, but the question is about whether this finding suggests inefficiency. If only 3 out of 100 beat the market, does that indicate inefficiency? I think not, because it's not a large number. So, maybe the correct answer is that this doesn't suggest inefficiency, meaning F: No.

Alternatively, the presence of any significant alpha might suggest inefficiency, but the question is about 3 out of 100. I think the key is that the majority aren't beating the market, which supports the idea that it's efficient because it's hard to beat if the market is efficient.

So, I'm leaning towards option F: No. It doesn't suggest inefficiency because only a few are beating it. Or perhaps option I, but I think the question is about the presence of some, not the majority. So, F might be the right answer.

The question examines whether 3 out of 100 fund managers beating the market using Jensen's alpha suggests market inefficiency. Jensen's alpha measures whether a manager outperforms the market after adjusting for risk, with a positive alpha indicating success. Efficient markets are hard to beat, as prices reflect all available information. Here, only 3 managers outperformed, which doesn't strongly indicate inefficiency, as most did not beat the market. This supports the idea of market efficiency rather than inefficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: No

Answer: F
