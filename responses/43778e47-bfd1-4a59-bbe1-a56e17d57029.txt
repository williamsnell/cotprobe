<think>
Okay, so I need to find the Fourier sine series of f(x) = x² over the interval (0,1). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Fourier series, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the Fourier sine series is used when we're dealing with an odd extension of a function. Since the interval is from 0 to 1, the sine series will represent the function as an odd function beyond that interval. 

The general formula for the Fourier sine series is:

f(x) ~ Σ [b_n * sin(nπx)] from n=1 to ∞

where the coefficients b_n are given by:

b_n = (2) ∫[0 to 1] f(x) sin(nπx) dx

Wait, no, I think it's actually:

b_n = (2) times the integral from 0 to L of f(x) sin(nπx/L) dx. But since our interval is from 0 to 1, L=1, so it simplifies.

So for f(x) = x², L=1, so the formula becomes:

b_n = 2 ∫₀¹ x² sin(nπx) dx

I need to compute this integral. Let me write it down:

b_n = 2 ∫₀¹ x² sin(nπx) dx

This integral looks like it can be solved by integration by parts. Integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du.

Let me set u = x², so du = 2x dx. Then dv = sin(nπx) dx, so v = - (1/(nπ)) cos(nπx).

Wait, actually, the integral of sin(ax) dx is - (1/a) cos(ax), so yes, that's right.

So applying integration by parts:

∫x² sin(nπx) dx = - (x² / (nπ)) cos(nπx) + (2/nπ) ∫x cos(nπx) dx

Now, I have to evaluate this from 0 to 1.

But wait, let me compute the first part first:

Evaluate - (x² / (nπ)) cos(nπx) from 0 to 1.

At x=1: - (1²)/(nπ) cos(nπ) = - (1)/(nπ) * (-1)^n because cos(nπ) = (-1)^n.

At x=0: - (0)/(nπ) cos(0) = 0.

So the first part is [ - (1/(nπ)) (-1)^n ] - 0 = (-1)^{n+1} / (nπ)

Now, the remaining integral is (2/nπ) ∫ x cos(nπx) dx from 0 to 1.

Hmm, I need to compute ∫x cos(nπx) dx. Let's do another integration by parts.

Let u = x, so du = dx. dv = cos(nπx) dx, so v = (1/(nπ)) sin(nπx).

So ∫x cos(nπx) dx = (x/(nπ)) sin(nπx) - ∫ [ (1/(nπ)) sin(nπx) ] dx

Evaluate ∫ [ (1/(nπ)) sin(nπx) ] dx = (1/(nπ)) * (-1/(nπ)) cos(nπx) ) + C = -1/(n²π²) cos(nπx) + C

So putting it together:

∫x cos(nπx) dx = (x/(nπ)) sin(nπx) + (1/(n²π²)) cos(nπx) ) + C

Now evaluate from 0 to 1.

At x=1: (1/(nπ)) sin(nπ) + (1/(n²π²)) cos(nπ) = 0 + (1/(n²π²)) (-1)^n

At x=0: (0/(nπ)) sin(0) + (1/(n²π²)) cos(0) = 0 + (1/(n²π²))(1)

So the integral from 0 to 1 is [ (1/(n²π²)) (-1)^n ] - [ (1/(n²π²)) (1) ) ] = [ (-1)^n - 1 ] / (n²π²)

Putting this back into the earlier expression:

The second part of the original integral is (2/nπ) * [ (-1)^n - 1 ] / (n²π²) )

Simplify:

(2/nπ) * [ (-1)^n - 1 ] / (n²π²) ) = 2 [ (-1)^n - 1 ] / (n^3 π^3 )

So now, putting everything together for b_n:

b_n = 2 [ (-1)^{n+1} / (nπ) ) + (2 [ (-1)^n - 1 ] ) / (n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, wait. Let me check the signs again.

Wait, the first part was (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ), and the second part was (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n - 1 ) / (n² π²) ) ]

So the second term is (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n - 1 ) / (n² π²) ) ] = 2 [ (-1)^n -1 ] / (n^3 π^3 )

So the entire b_n is:

b_n = 2 [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 2 [ (-1)^n -1 ] / (n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the initial integral was ∫x² sin(nπx) dx, which after first integration by parts gave:

- x²/(nπ) cos(nπx) + (2/nπ) ∫x cos(nπx) dx

Evaluated from 0 to 1, which gave us [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) ] + (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 ) / (n² π²) ) ]

So when we multiply by 2 for b_n, we have:

b_n = 2 * [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 ) / (n² π²) ) ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, the integral after first parts is:

∫x² sin(nπx) dx = [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) ] + (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n² π²) ) ]

So then, b_n = 2 times that:

b_n = 2 [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) + 2 [ ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, the integral after first parts is:

∫x² sin(nπx) dx = [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) ] + (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n² π²) ) ]

So when multiplied by 2:

b_n = 2 * [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) ] + 2 * (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n² π²) ) ]

Wait, no, the 2 is the multiplier for the entire integral, so:

b_n = 2 * [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) + (2/nπ) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n² π²) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

b_n = 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4*( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, let me factor out terms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express it as:

b_n = [ (-1)^{n+1} * 2/(nπ) ] + [ 4*( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, but let me see if I can simplify this expression.

First, let's look at the terms:

The first term is 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ)

The second term is [4*(-1)^n -4]/(n^3 π^3 )

Alternatively, perhaps factor out some constants.

Wait, 4*( (-1)^n -1 ) = 4*(-1)^n -4

So the second term can be written as (4*(-1)^n -4 )/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, so putting it all together:

b_n = [2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ)] + [4*(-1)^n -4]/(n^3 π^3 )

Wait, perhaps we can combine these terms in a better way. Let me factor out (-1)^n where possible.

First term: 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) = -2*(-1)^n/(nπ)

So b_n = (-2*(-1)^n)/(nπ) + (4*(-1)^n -4)/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, maybe factor out (-1)^n from the first two terms:

= [ (-2/(nπ)) + (4/(n^3 π^3 )) ] * (-1)^n - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

Wait, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor the 4:

Wait, 4*(-1)^n -4 = 4[ (-1)^n -1 ]

But maybe I should just leave it as it is.

Now, let's see the answer options. Let's look through them.

Option A: (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) * sin(nπx)

But that's just the first term. Our result has two terms, so A can't be right.

Option B: 2/(nπ) * sin(nπx). That's a term without alternating signs, which doesn't match our first term, which has (-1)^{n+1}. So B is incorrect.

Option C: (-1)^n/(n^3 π^3) * sin(nπx). Hmm, that's only the second part, but perhaps scaled differently. Let me check.

Wait, in our result, the coefficients are:

b_n = [ -2*(-1)^n/(nπ) ) ] + [4*(-1)^n -4 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

b_n = [ (-2/(nπ)) (-1)^n ) ] + [4*(-1)^n -4 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

So combining terms, perhaps factor (-1)^n:

= (-1)^n [ -2/(nπ) + 4/(n^3 π^3) ) ] - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, but this might not be the way it's presented in the options.

Looking at option F: It has (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 2[1 - (-1)^n]/(n^3 π^3 )

Wait, let's check that.

Option F: [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) + (2 [1 - (-1)^n ] )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, so let's compute that:

(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) = - (-1)^n/(nπ)

And 2[1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) = 2/(n^3 π^3 ) - 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

So combining these terms:

= [ - (-1)^n/(nπ) ) + 2/(n^3 π^3 ) - 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Hmm, comparing to our b_n:

b_n = [ -2*(-1)^n/(nπ) + (4*(-1)^n -4 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, that's different. Because in option F, the coefficients are:

- (-1)^n/(nπ) + 2/(n^3 π^3 ) - 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

Which would be:

[ - (-1)^n/(nπ) ] + [ 2/(n^3 π^3 ) - 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

But our result is:

-2*(-1)^n/(nπ) + (4*(-1)^n -4 )/(n^3 π^3 )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the integral. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me go back through the steps carefully.

First, the integral ∫x² sin(nπx) dx from 0 to 1.

Integration by parts: u = x², dv = sin(nπx) dx.

du = 2x dx, v = -cos(nπx)/(nπ)

So ∫x² sin(nπx) dx = -x² cos(nπx)/(nπ) + (2/nπ) ∫x cos(nπx) dx

Evaluated from 0 to 1:

At x=1: -1² cos(nπ)/(nπ) = - (-1)^n/(nπ)
At x=0: 0, because x² is zero.

So the first term is [ - (-1)^n/(nπ) ) ] = (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ)

Now, the integral ∫x cos(nπx) dx from 0 to 1.

Again, integration by parts: u = x, dv = cos(nπx) dx

du = dx, v = sin(nπx)/(nπ)

So ∫x cos(nπx) dx = x sin(nπx)/(nπ) - ∫ sin(nπx)/(nπ) dx

Which is x sin(nπx)/(nπ) + cos(nπx)/(n² π² )

Evaluated from 0 to 1.

At x=1: sin(nπ) =0, cos(nπ)=(-1)^n, so term is 0 + (-1)^n/(n² π² )

At x=0: sin(0)=0, cos(0)=1, so term is 0 + 1/(n² π² )

So the integral ∫x cos(nπx) dx from 0 to 1 is [ (-1)^n/(n² π² ) - 1/(n² π² ) ] = [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

Now, going back to the original integral:

∫x² sin(nπx) dx = (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + (2/nπ) * [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

Multiply by 2 for b_n:

b_n = 2 [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) + (2 [ (-1)^n -1 ] )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

So:

b_n = 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4 [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Now, let's simplify 2*(-1)^{n+1}:

2*(-1)^{n+1} = -2*(-1)^n

So:

b_n = -2*(-1)^n/(nπ) + 4*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, maybe factor out (-1)^n:

= (-1)^n [ -2/(nπ) + 4/(n^3 π^3 ) ] - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

Alternatively, perhaps express it as:

= [ (-1)^n * (-2/(nπ) + 4/(n^3 π^3 )) ] - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

But looking at the options, perhaps the form is easier to match without factoring.

Looking again at the options, option F is:

x^2 ~_s 2 ∞∑_{n=1} [ (-1)^{n+1} / (nπ) ) + (2 [1 - (-1)^n ] ) / (n^3 π^3 ) ] sin(nπx)

Wait, so let's compute that.

Option F's coefficient is:

[ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) + 2(1 - (-1)^n)/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Which is:

= (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 2/(n^3 π^3 ) - 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

= [ - (-1)^n/(nπ) ) ] + 2/(n^3 π^3 ) + 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(n^3 π^3 )

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, let's compute the entire expression.

Wait, our b_n is:

b_n = 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4*( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 )

= [2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ)] + [4*(-1)^n -4]/(n^3 π^3 )

If we factor 2, this becomes:

= 2 [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + (2*(-1)^n -2 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

But let's see if any options match this.

Looking at option I:

x^2 ~_s 2 ∞∑ [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2(1 - (-1)^n)/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Hmm, let me compute that.

Option I's coefficient is:

[ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) - 2*(1 - (-1)^n)/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

= (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2/(n^3 π^3 ) + 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

= [ - (-1)^n/(nπ) ) ] - 2/(n^3 π^3 ) + 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

But our b_n is:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

Which is:

-2*(-1)^n/(nπ) + 4*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, comparing to option I:

Option I: [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) - 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Which is:

(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2/(n^3 π^3 ) + 2*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

Multiply by 2, does that give our expression?

Wait, no, because our expression is 2 times the [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + terms ]

Wait, perhaps option F is:

Option F: 2 times [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 2(1 - (-1)^n)/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Which would be:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4(1 - (-1)^n)/(n^3 π^3 )

Which is:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4/(n^3 π^3 ) - 4*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, comparing with our result:

Our b_n = 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) - 4/(n^3 π^3 )

Which can be written as:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + [4*(-1)^n -4 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

So, the second term in option F is 4/(n^3 π^3 ) -4*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ), which is the negative of what we have.

So our second term is 4*(-1)^n -4, while option F has 4 -4*(-1)^n.

So the signs are opposite. Therefore, option F's second term isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs during integration by parts.

Wait, let me re-examine the integral ∫x cos(nπx) dx from 0 to 1.

The result was [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

Wait, because at x=1, it's (-1)^n/(n² π² ), and at x=0, it's 1/(n² π² )

So the integral is [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

So when I multiply by (2/nπ), it becomes (2/nπ) * [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² ) = 2 [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

So when I plug this into the original expression for the integral ∫x² sin(nπx) dx, it's:

(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 2 [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Multiply by 2 for b_n: 

b_n = 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4 [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

So that's correct.

Now, looking at the options again, perhaps option I is the correct one.

Option I:

x^2 ~_s 2 ∞∑ [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

So the coefficient is:

(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 )

= (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2/(n^3 π^3 ) + 2 (-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

Which is:

= [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) ] + [ 2 (-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) - 2/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

= [ - (-1)^n/(nπ) ) ] + [ 2 (-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) - 2/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Hmm, if I multiply this by 2, I get:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + 4 (-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) -4/(n^3 π^3 )

Which matches our b_n exactly.

Wait, no. Wait, option I is:

x^2 ~_s 2 ∞∑ [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

So each term is multiplied by 2, so the entire series is 2 times the sum of these terms.

So the coefficient is:

2 * [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) - 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Which equals:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) -4 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 )

= 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) -4/(n^3 π^3 ) +4 (-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

But our b_n is:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) +4*(-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 ) -4/(n^3 π^3 )

Which is the same as:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) + [4*(-1)^n -4 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Which matches with option I's expression after expansion.

Wait, because option I's expression is:

2 [ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) - 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

= 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) -4 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 )

= 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) -4/(n^3 π^3 ) +4 (-1)^n/(n^3 π^3 )

Which is exactly our b_n. So option I is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. In option I, the coefficient is:

[ (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) ) - 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

And when multiplied by 2, it gives:

2*(-1)^{n+1}/(nπ) -4 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Which is the same as our b_n.

So the correct answer is option I.
</think>

The Fourier sine series of \( f(x) = x^2 \) over the interval \( (0, 1) \) is found by computing the coefficients \( b_n \) using the formula:

\[
b_n = 2 \int_0^1 x^2 \sin(n\pi x) \, dx
\]

Through integration by parts, the integral is evaluated, and the coefficients are determined to be:

\[
b_n = \frac{2(-1)^{n+1}}{n\pi} + \frac{4[(-1)^n - 1]}{n^3\pi^3}
\]

This matches the form in option I, which is:

\[
x^2 \sim_s 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n\pi} - \frac{2[1 - (-1)^n]}{n^3\pi^3} \right) \sin(n\pi x)
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I**
