Question:

A man conveyed land by quitclaim deed as a gift to his cousin, who did not then record the deed or take possession of the land. Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?

Options:

A: For the friend, because the cousin did not take possession of the land.
B: For the friend, because the cousin did not record her deed in time.
C: For the cousin, because she has the original deed.
D: For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.
E: For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.
F: For the cousin, because the friend did not pay for the land.
G: For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend.
H: For the friend, because he was first in possession.
I: For the friend, because he was not aware of the previous deed.
J: For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question about quitclaim deeds and recording acts. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the situation is that a man (let's call him Man A) gave a quitclaim deed as a gift to his cousin. The cousin didn't record the deed and didn't take possession right away. Then, six months later, Man A, who's still in possession, gives another quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend. The friend didn't know about the cousin's deed and also didn't record it. Then, Man A vacated the land, and the friend took possession. 

The recording act in the jurisdiction says that no unrecorded conveyance or mortgage is good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who then record first. 

Now, the cousin found out about the friend's deed and possession. She immediately recorded her deed and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all defenses. 

The question is, who's likely to win?

First, I need to understand the key concepts here. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has, without warranties. So, if Man A had already conveyed the land to the cousin, then when he conveyed it again to the friend, which conveyance is valid?

Under the recording act, the priority of deeds depends on who records first, especially when the subsequent purchaser is without notice and pays value. But here, both the cousin and the friend received the land as gifts, so they didn't pay value. 

Wait, but the recording act says it's about subsequent purchasers for value without notice. So, if someone is a bona fide purchaser (BFP) for value, they take priority over prior unrecorded conveyances. But in this case, both the cousin and the friend didn't pay value; they were donees. 

The cousin didn't record her deed initially but sued after the friend took possession. The friend, upon learning, recorded his deed. 

So, let's think about the timeline. Man A first conveyed to the cousin, who didn't record. Then, Man A conveyed again to the friend, who also didn't record. The friend took possession after Man A vacated. 

The cousin found out and recorded her deed. The friend then recorded his. 

Under the recording act, the key is whether the subsequent purchaser (even if a donee, but the act specifies "purchasers for value") can take priority. But here, the friend didn't pay value either. Wait, the act says "subsequent purchasers for value without notice." So, if the friend is not a purchaser for value, does the act apply?

Wait, no, because in this case, the friend didn't pay value. So, the recording act's protection is for purchasers for value without notice. Since both the cousin and the friend are donees, maybe the act doesn't apply in the same way.

So, the issue is who has the superior claim. Because both are donees, and the first conveyance was to the cousin, but she didn't record. The friend took possession later but also didn't record until after the cousin recorded.

But since both are donees, perhaps the first in time rule applies. The first conveyance (to the cousin) would generally be valid unless the second conveyance (to the friend) had priority under some doctrine, but since the friend didn't pay value, maybe the first in time still holds.

Wait, but the friend was a subsequent donee. If the first donee (cousin) didn't record, and the second donee (friend) didn't know about the first deed, would the second have priority?

Alternatively, under the recording act, if a subsequent purchaser for value without notice records first, they take priority. But here, the friend isn't a purchaser for value. So, maybe the recording act doesn't help the friend, and the first conveyance (to the cousin) is valid, regardless of recording, because the friend isn't a BFP for value.

But wait, the cousin didn't record her deed until after the friend took possession and then recorded his. So, when the cousin recorded, she did so after the friend had possession. Does that affect anything?

Let me think about the recording act again. The act says an unrecorded conveyance is not good against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice who records first. But since the friend didn't pay value, he's not a subsequent purchaser for value. Therefore, the recording act doesn't protect him. So, the friend's claim would be junior to the cousin's prior conveyance, regardless of recording.

Wait, but if Man A conveyed to the cousin first, then the cousin has a prior interest. Even though she didn't record, the friend didn't pay value, so the friend can't take priority over the prior unrecorded deed. Because for the recording act to apply, the subsequent party needs to be a purchaser for value without notice. The friend wasn't a purchaser for value, so the act doesn't help him. So, the cousin's prior conveyance would still be valid against the friend, even if unrecorded.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, a subsequent donee can take priority over an unrecorded prior conveyance if they are bona fide purchasers without notice. But the recording act here specifically refers to "purchasers for value," so maybe donees aren't covered. 

Alternatively, without the recording act, the first conveyance would be valid, but if the first conveyance is unrecorded, and the second is a BFP for value, the second would take. But in this case, the second is not a BFP for value. So the first conveyance (to cousin) would take priority.

But the cousin didn't record until after the friend took possession. So, under the recording act, if the friend had been a BFP for value, he would have priority. But since he isn't, the cousin's prior conveyance is still valid.

So, the court would likely decide for the cousin because she was first in time, and the friend wasn't a purchaser for value. Therefore, the friend's deed doesn't take priority over the cousin's prior unrecorded deed.

Wait, but another angle: since the friend didn't record until after the cousin, but the recording act's protection is for subsequent purchasers for value. Since the friend isn't a value purchaser, maybe the cousin's recording after the fact doesn't matter. The cousin's prior conveyance is still valid, so she would win.

Looking at the options:

Option J says, "For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser." That seems to fit.

Option D says, "For the friend, because a subsequent good-faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record." But I think that applies only if the recording act covers donees, which it might not. The act refers to "purchasers for value," so donees might not be protected.

Option B says, "For the friend, because the cousin did not record her deed in time." But since the friend isn't a purchaser for value, the recording act doesn't apply, so the timing of recording doesn't matter for the friend.

Option G says, "For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend." That's more about the first conveyance being effective, but the issue is whether the second conveyance can take effect. Since Man A gave it to the cousin first, he no longer owned it, so he couldn't give it to the friend. But wait, in a quitclaim deed, the grantor only transfers whatever interest they have. If the grantor had already conveyed it to the cousin, then when he conveyed again to the friend, he had nothing to convey. So, the friend's deed wouldn't have any effect because Man A had already parted with his interest.

Wait, that's a good point. If the first conveyance to the cousin was effective, then the second conveyance to the friend was ineffective because Man A had no title left. So, the friend never acquired the land from Man A because Man A had already given it to the cousin. Therefore, the cousin would have the valid title.

So, the court would likely decide for the cousin because the man had already conveyed the land to her before conveying to the friend. Therefore, the friend's deed is ineffective.

Looking at the options, option G says exactly that: "For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend." That makes sense because the first conveyance would transfer the title, and the second conveyance would be ineffective.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought about the recording act earlier. But if the first conveyance was effective, regardless of recording, then the friend's deed is a nullity. So the cousin would win on that basis.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is either G or J. Let me check the options again.

Option J: For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.

Option G: For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend.

Which is correct? Well, under the common law, the first in time rule applies, so the first conveyance is effective, even if unrecorded. The friend's deed would not affect the title because Man A had already transferred it. So, the cousin would have the valid title, making option G correct.

Alternatively, if the recording act applies, but since the friend isn't a purchaser for value, the act doesn't protect him, so the first conveyance to the cousin stands, making option J also a possibility. But I think the key here is that the first conveyance was effective, so the friend never got the land. Therefore, option G is the right answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **G: For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend.**

Under the common law rule of "first in time, first in right," the first conveyance from the man to the cousin is effective, even if unrecorded. When the man later attempted to convey the land to the friend, he no longer had any interest to transfer because the title had already passed to the cousin. The friend's deed is ineffective because Man A had already parted with his interest. Additionally, the recording act in this jurisdiction protects subsequent purchasers for value without notice, but the friend did not pay value, so the act does not apply to his situation. Therefore, the cousin is the rightful owner.

**Answer: G**
