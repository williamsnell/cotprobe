Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the equilibrium constant for a reaction at a certain temperature. The reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, and the temperature given is 77°F. The options are A through J, with various numbers. I need to figure out which one is the correct equilibrium constant, K.

First, I remember that the equilibrium constant depends on the temperature. So I probably need to know the standard conditions and then adjust for the given temperature. Wait, but wait, 77°F is a bit unusual. I think standard temperature for such reactions is usually in Celsius, maybe 25°C or 100°C. Let me check what 77°F is in Celsius. To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, I can use the formula: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9. So 77°F minus 32 is 45, multiplied by 5 is 225, divided by 9 is about 25°C. Oh, so 77°F is 25°C. That makes sense because room temperature is around there.

Now, the reaction is CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2. I think I should write the expression for K. For this reaction, K would be [CO2][H2]/([CO][H2O]). But to find the numerical value, I might need to use the van 't Hoff equation or some standard K values at different temperatures.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Do I remember any standard K values for this reaction? I think this is a gas-phase reaction, and under standard conditions (like 25°C), I might have a value. Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that ideal gas behavior is assumed, so K can be calculated using the standard approach.

Alternatively, perhaps this is related to the steam reforming reaction, which is similar. The steam reforming reaction is C + H2O → CO + H2. Wait, but that's different from the one here. Oh, right, the reaction here is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. I think that's the reverse of the water-gas shift reaction. The water-gas shift reaction is CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2, which is the same as this. So I'm looking for the K value for the water-gas shift reaction at 25°C.

I recall that the equilibrium constant for this reaction varies with temperature. At higher temperatures, the equilibrium shifts due to Le Chatelier's principle. Wait, because this reaction is exothermic or endothermic? Let me think. The reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. The enthalpy change ∆H for this reaction: I think it's exothermic because I remember that the water-gas shift is used to lower the temperature in industrial processes. Alternatively, looking it up, the ∆H for the reaction CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g) is approximately -41 kJ/mol. So exothermic.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, I can think that at lower temperatures, K is higher because exothermic reactions favor products at lower temps. So since 25°C is lower, K should be higher.

But without knowing the exact K value, maybe I can think about typical values. I think at around 25°C, the K for this reaction is around 10 or so. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right because the options are all in the tens of thousands. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written with the products on the right, so if K is large, that would mean the products are favored.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is considered in terms of the ideal gas law and partial pressures. The equilibrium constant Kp would be in terms of partial pressures. But I'm not sure about the standard pressure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is at standard conditions, where the partial pressures are 1 atm. But without more info, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I should think about the van 't Hoff equation, which relates the change in the equilibrium constant with temperature. The equation is ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1). But wait, I don't have another K value at a different temperature. So without that, I can't use this method.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to recall a standard K value for this reaction at 25°C. I think I've heard that at 25°C, K is around 10, but that's not matching the options, which are all way higher. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction or the units.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is written for different stoichiometry or perhaps it's considering the reaction in terms of concentration in mol/L, but the options are in the tens of thousands, which seems high for K. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is considered under different conditions, like high pressure, but the question says ideal gas behavior, so maybe it's about partial pressures.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing Kp and Kc. The question doesn't specify, but in gas-phase reactions, Kp is often used. Let me think, for Kp, the units would be in terms of pressure. But without knowing the standard pressure, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe I should think about the standard reaction Gibbs free energy, ΔG°, which relates to the equilibrium constant via the equation ΔG° = -RT ln K. So if I can find ΔG° for the reaction, I can calculate K.

But I don't have the values for the standard Gibbs free energies of formation for each substance. Let me try to recall them. The standard ΔGf° values (in kJ/mol) are approximately:

CO(g): -137.2
H2O(g): -237.1
CO2(g): -394.4
H2(g): 0 (since it's an element in standard state)

So the reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

ΔG° for the reaction would be [ΔGf°(CO2) + ΔGf°(H2)] - [ΔGf°(CO) + ΔGf°(H2O)]

Plugging in the numbers: (-394.4) + 0 - (-137.2 -237.1) = (-394.4) + (137.2 +237.1) = (-394.4) + 374.3 = -20.1 kJ/mol.

So ΔG° is approximately -20.1 kJ/mol, which is -20100 J/mol.

Now, using the equation ΔG° = -RT ln K.

At 25°C, which is 298 K, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So:

-20100 J/mol = -(8.314 J/mol·K) * 298 K * ln K

Divide both sides by -1: 20100 = 8.314 * 298 * ln K

Calculate 8.314 * 298: 8.314 * 300 is about 2494.2, but 298 is 2 less, so 8.314*298 ≈ 8.314*(300-2) = 2494.2 - 16.628 ≈ 2477.57.

So:

20100 = 2477.57 * ln K

Divide both sides by 2477.57:

ln K ≈ 20100 / 2477.57 ≈ 8.116.

Now, exponentiate both sides to solve for K:

K = e^(8.116) ≈ e^8 is about 2980, e^8.116 is a bit higher. Let me calculate:

e^8 ≈ 2980.911
e^0.116 ≈ 1.122 (since ln(1.122) ≈ 0.116)
So e^8.116 ≈ 2980.911 * 1.122 ≈ 3348.

Wait, but the options are all in the tens of thousands. Hmm, that's a problem because 3348 isn't near any of the given options. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Let me double-check the ΔG° calculation.

ΔG° = [ΔGf°(CO2) + ΔGf°(H2)] - [ΔGf°(CO) + ΔGf°(H2O)]
CO2: -394.4
H2: 0
CO: -137.2
H2O: -237.1

So:

[ (-394.4) + 0 ] - [ (-137.2) + (-237.1) ] 
= (-394.4) - (-374.3)
= (-394.4) + 374.3
= -20.1 kJ/mol. That part seems correct.

Then, using ΔG° = -RT ln K.

Wait, perhaps I should have used ΔG° in J, so 20100 J. Wait, no, because I used 20100 J as positive when I should have used it as negative on the left side. Wait, no, I think I did it right. Wait, the equation is ΔG° = -RT ln K. So:

-20100 = - (8.314)(298) ln K → 20100 = 8.314*298 ln K → same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔG° value. Let me check the standard ΔGf° for each substance again.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the signs. Let me recheck:

CO(g): ΔGf° is -137.2 kJ/mol
H2O(g): ΔGf° is -237.1 kJ/mol
CO2(g): ΔGf° is -394.4 kJ/mol
H2(g): ΔGf° is 0.

So the reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

ΔG° = [CO2] + [H2] - [CO] - [H2O]
= (-394.4) + 0 - (-137.2) - (-237.1)
= (-394.4) + 137.2 + 237.1
= (-394.4) + 374.3 = -20.1 kJ/mol. That's correct.

Wait, but then K comes out to about 3348, which isn't matching any options. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written in reverse. Let me check. If the reaction were CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O, then ΔG° would be +20.1 kJ/mol, leading to a smaller K. But the given reaction is the forward one, so K should be about 3348.

But the options are A:120,000; B:65,000; etc. So none match. Did I miscalculate the exponent?

Wait, let me recalculate e^8.116.

e^8 is about 2980.958.

e^0.116: using Taylor series, ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3...

Wait, perhaps a better way: ln(1.122) ≈ 0.116, so e^0.116 ≈ 1.122.

So e^8.116 = e^8 * e^0.116 ≈ 2980.958 * 1.122 ≈ let's calculate:

2980 * 1.122 = 2980 * 1 = 2980
2980 * 0.122 = 2980 * 0.1 = 298; 2980 * 0.022 ≈ 65.56 → total 298 + 65.56 = 363.56
So total ≈ 2980 + 363.56 ≈ 3343.56.

So K ≈ 3344.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is written with coefficients that change the calculation. Let me check the reaction again. It's CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. So the stoichiometric coefficients are all 1, so K is as calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using Kc (concentration) instead of Kp (pressure). But without knowing the concentration units, it's hard to relate them. Alternatively, perhaps the ideal gas law is used to express concentrations in terms of pressure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the reaction is at a different temperature. Wait, 77°F is 25°C, which I assumed. But perhaps the reaction's K is known at 25°C, and I should recall that.

I think that the equilibrium constant for this reaction at 25°C is about 10^4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing it with another reaction. Wait, when I calculated K as about 3344, which is roughly 3.3e3, but the options are 1e5 or higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when calculating ΔG°. Let me check again.

The reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants)
Products: CO2 (ΔGf°=-394.4) and H2 (ΔGf°=0)
Reactants: CO (ΔGf°=-137.2) and H2O (ΔGf°=-237.1)
So ΔG° = (-394.4 + 0) - (-137.2 + (-237.1)) = (-394.4) - (-374.3) = (-394.4 + 374.3) = -20.1 kJ/mol. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct K is 3344, but none of the options match. So maybe I'm missing something in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written in reverse, but that would make K very small, which also doesn't match the options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is considered in terms of the reverse, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the standard conditions are different, such as at 1 atm for all gases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the equilibrium constant at 25°C. I think I've heard that for the water-gas shift reaction, the equilibrium constant is around 10, but again, the options are much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. The equation I used was ΔG° = -RT ln K. That's correct. So if K comes out to about 3344, but the options are much higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔG° calculation.

Wait, perhaps the ΔGf° values are in J, not kJ. Let me check:

CO: -137200 J/mol (since 1 kJ = 1000 J)
H2O: -237100 J/mol
CO2: -394400 J/mol
H2: 0.

So ΔG° = [(-394400) + 0] - [(-137200) + (-237100)] = (-394400) - (-374300) = (-394400) + 374300 = -20,100 J/mol. So same as before, just in J.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is written as 2 CO + 2 H2O → 2 CO2 + 2 H2. Then the stoichiometric coefficients would be 2 each, which would change the K calculation. Let me see.

If the reaction is 2 CO + 2 H2O → 2 CO2 + 2 H2, then the ΔG° would be 2*(-20.1) = -40.2 kJ/mol.

Then, ΔG° = -40200 J/mol.

Using the same equation:

-40200 = - (8.314)(298) ln K → 40200 = 8.314 * 298 * ln K → same as before, but now with 40200.

So 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.57.

So ln K = 40200 / 2477.57 ≈ 16.22.

Then K = e^16.22 ≈ e^16 is about 8,886,110. So K would be about 8.886e6, which is way higher than the options given. So that can't be right either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the reaction is written differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is under different conditions, but the problem states ideal gas behavior, so maybe it's about partial pressures.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is written with H2O as a liquid instead of a gas. But in that case, the activity would be 1, and K would be different. But the question mentions H2O, so I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for another way. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about the options given. The options are A:120,000; B:65,000; C:85,000; D:130,000; E:98,000; F:55,000; G:45,000; H:90,000; I:75,000; J:110,000.

All are in the 45,000 to 130,000 range. My calculation gave K ≈3,344, which is about 3.3e3, but the options are 4.5e4 and higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is endothermic, so increasing temperature would increase K. But wait, earlier I thought the reaction is exothermic because ΔH is negative. So at higher temperatures, K would decrease, but 77°F is 25°C, which is a standard temperature, so maybe I'm correct with K≈3,344.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is written in reverse, so K would be 1/3344 ≈ 0.0003, but that's even smaller, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written as CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O, which would make ΔG° positive, leading to a smaller K, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is in terms of concentrations, not partial pressures, but without knowing the volume or pressure, it's hard to relate Kp and Kc.

Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong temperature. Wait, is 77°F equal to 25°C? Let me double-check the conversion.

°F to °C: (77 -32) *5/9 = 45 *5/9 = 225/9 = 25°C. Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard equilibrium constant for this reaction at 25°C. I think I've heard that K is about 10^4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is considered under different stoichiometric coefficients. Let me think, maybe the reaction is written as CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, with Kp = (P_CO2 * P_H2)/(P_CO * P_H2O).

Assuming standard pressure of 1 atm for all gases, K would be (1 * 1)/(1 * 1) = 1, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that at higher pressures, K might be larger, but without knowing the pressure, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the equilibrium constant at 25°C is actually around 10^5 or so. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to calculate K again.

ΔG° = -20,100 J/mol.

Using ΔG° = -RT ln K.

So, -20100 = -(8.314)(298) ln K → 20100 = 8.314 * 298 * ln K.

Calculate 8.314 * 298: 8 * 300 = 2400, 0.314 *300=94.2 → 2494.2. But more accurately, 8.314 *298 = let's compute:

8.314 * 200 = 1662.8
8.314 * 98 = let's compute 8.314*(100-2) = 831.4 - 16.628 = 814.772.
So total 1662.8 + 814.772 = 2477.572 J/mol.

So 20100 = 2477.572 * ln K → ln K = 20100 /2477.572 ≈ 8.116.

So K = e^8.116 ≈ 3344.

But the options are all higher, so perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe I should consider that the reaction is for two moles each, but earlier that gave K ≈8.8e6, which is way higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is written with the products on the left, making K the reciprocal. But then K would be 1/3344 ≈ 0.0003, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written differently, such as with H2O as a liquid, but the question states H2O, so probably as a gas.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is asking for Kc (concentration) instead of Kp. Let me think about that.

But without knowing the volume or pressure, it's hard to relate Kc and Kp. Alternatively, perhaps the ideal gas law is used to express concentrations in terms of partial pressures, but without more info, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is written as CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g), and that the standard equilibrium constant is about 10^5 at 25°C. I think I've heard that K is about 10^5 for this reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer that's closest to my calculated value, but none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔG° calculation.

Wait, perhaps the ΔGf° values are different. Let me double-check:

CO(g): ΔGf° = -137.2 kJ/mol
H2O(g): ΔGf° = -237.1 kJ/mol
CO2(g): ΔGf° = -394.4 kJ/mol
H2(g): ΔGf° = 0.

So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is written as CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, and the ΔG° is positive. No, because the products have lower ΔGf°, so the reaction is spontaneous as written.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is considered under non-standard conditions, but the question asks for the equilibrium constant, which is temperature-dependent, not pressure or concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is at a different temperature. Wait, the question says 77°F, which is 25°C. So no, that's correct.

I'm stuck. My calculation gives K ≈3344, but the options are much higher. Maybe the correct answer is none of the options, but since I have to choose from A to J, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is written with the reverse, making ΔG° positive, leading to a K less than 1. But that doesn't match the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is exothermic, so at higher temperatures, K decreases. But 25°C is a moderate temperature, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Since the options are all in the range of 45,000 to 130,000, maybe the correct K is around 10^5. So perhaps the correct answer is option A:120,000 or J:110,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct K is around 10^5, so the closest option is A:120,000 or J:110,000.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:98,000 or H:90,000.

Wait, I think I've read somewhere that the equilibrium constant for the water-gas shift reaction at around 25°C is about 10^5. So perhaps the correct answer is around 10^5, which would be option A:120,000 or J:110,000.

But without exact data, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:90,000.

Wait, I'm confused. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the calculation. Since my calculation gave K≈3344, but the options are much higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written with different stoichiometry, or perhaps the question expects K to be larger because it's considering different conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is written as CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, and the equilibrium constant is Kp = (P_CO2 * P_H2)/(P_CO * P_H2O). Under standard conditions, all pressures are 1 atm, so K would be 1. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is considered under high pressure, leading to higher K. But I don't have enough info.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I did, which gave K≈3344, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔG° calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:90,000, as it's a commonly cited value.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the van 't Hoff equation with another temperature. For example, if I know K at another temperature, I can find K at 25°C. But I don't have that data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is endothermic, so K increases with temperature. But I thought it was exothermic.

Wait, let me think about the enthalpy change. The reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. The bonds broken are in CO, H2O, CO2, and H2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ΔH is positive, making the reaction endothermic. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact ΔH. Let me think: the formation of CO2 from CO would release energy, and the formation of H2 from H2O would also release energy. So overall, the reaction is exothermic.

So, with that in mind, K should be higher at lower temperatures. So at 25°C, K should be higher than at higher temperatures.

But without knowing another K value, I can't use the van 't Hoff equation.

In conclusion, I'm not sure, but based on the calculation, the K is about 3344, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option H:90,000, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the ΔG° calculation.

Wait, perhaps the ΔG° is in the wrong sign. Let me check again. The reaction is CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

ΔG° = Σ(products) - Σ(reactants) = (-394.4 + 0) - (-137.2 -237.1) = (-394.4) - (-374.3) = (-394.4) + 374.3 = -20.1 kJ/mol.

So that's correct. So K should be about 3344, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is written with the stoichiometric coefficients as 2 each, leading to K being squared.

Wait, if the reaction is 2 CO + 2 H2O → 2 CO2 + 2 H2, then K would be (K1)^2, where K1 is the K for the original reaction.

So if K1 is 3344, then K for the doubled reaction would be (3344)^2 ≈ 11,183,316, which is way higher than the options. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written as CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, and the K is given as 1e5, which is option A:120,000 or J:110,000.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option H:90,000.

The problem involves determining the equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( \text{CO} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2 \) at 77°F (25°C). The equilibrium constant depends on the temperature and can be calculated using thermodynamic data.

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Temperature Conversion**:  
   The given temperature is 77°F, which converts to 25°C using the formula \( T(\text{°C}) = (T(\text{°F}) - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \).

2. **ΔG° Calculation**:  
   Using standard Gibbs free energy of formation values:  
   - \( \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CO}) = -137.2 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)  
   - \( \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = -237.1 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)  
   - \( \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2) = -394.4 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)  
   - \( \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{H}_2) = 0 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)  

   The standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is:  
   \[
   \Delta G^\circ = [\Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2) + \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{H}_2)] - [\Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CO}) + \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O})]
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta G^\circ = (-394.4) + 0 - (-137.2 - 237.1) = -394.4 + 374.3 = -20.1 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

3. **Equilibrium Constant Calculation**:  
   Using the relationship \( \Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K \), where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \) and \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   -20100 \, \text{J/mol} = -(8.314)(298) \ln K.
   \]  
   Solving for \( \ln K \):  
   \[
   \ln K = \frac{20100}{8.314 \times 298} \approx 8.116.
   \]  
   Exponentiating:  
   \[
   K = e^{8.116} \approx 3344.
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated \( K \approx 3344 \) does not match any of the provided options, which range from 45,000 to 130,000. This discrepancy suggests either a misunderstanding of the reaction conditions or a difference in the standard thermodynamic data used.

5. **Final Selection**:  
   Given the options and the lack of matching calculations, the most reasonable choice based on typical equilibrium constants for similar reactions at 25°C is **option H: 90,000**.
