Question:

A research worker was interested in racial differences in the standard of living of farm operators in the southeastern United States. He used the presence of running water in farm dwellings as a crude index of the standard of living. For each of 31 economic areas in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia in 1945, he calculated two mea-sures : X = farms operated by nonwhites per 100 white farm operators and Y = percent of farms having running water in dwellings. The fol-lowing values were obtained: \sum X = 1,860\sum Y = 465\sum XY = 23,400 \sum X^2 = 201,600\sum Y^2 = 7,925n = 31 Compute the regression line and the correlation of X and Y.

Options:

A: Y = 18 - 0.05 X, r = - .4867
B: Y = 16 - 0.08 X, r = -0.6000
C: Y = 20 - 0.05 X, r = - .4867
D: Y = 18 - 0.05 X, r = - .4000
E: Y = 20 - 0.07 X, r = -0.5500
F: Y = 18 + 0.06 X, r = 0.4867
G: Y = 18 - 0.06 X, r = - .4867
H: Y = 22 - 0.04 X, r = -0.3000
I: Y = 15 + 0.03 X, r = 0.3500
J: Y = 19 - 0.05 X, r = 0.4867

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because regression and correlation aren't my strongest topics yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about computing the regression line and the correlation coefficient between two variables, X and Y. The data given is for 31 economic areas in three southern states. X is the number of farms operated by nonwhites per 100 white farm operators, and Y is the percentage of farms with running water. The sums provided are: sum X = 1860, sum Y=465, sum XY=23400, sum X²=201600, sum Y²=7925, and n=31.

First, I remember that the regression line is given by Y = a + bX, where a is the intercept and b is the slope. The formula for the slope (b) is (nΣXY - ΣXΣY) / (nΣX² - (ΣX)²), and the intercept a is (ΣY - bΣX)/n.

Wait, let me double-check that. Yeah, I think that's right. So I'll need to compute b first.

Let me plug in the numbers:

n = 31
ΣX = 1860
ΣY = 465
ΣXY = 23400
ΣX² = 201600
ΣY² = 7925

So, the numerator for b is (31 * 23400) minus (1860 * 465). Let me calculate that.

31 * 23400 = let's see, 30*23400=702000, plus 1*23400=23400, so total 725400.

Then, 1860 * 465. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down. 1860 * 400 = 744,000. 1860 * 65 = 120,900. So total is 744,000 + 120,900 = 864,900.

So the numerator is 725,400 - 864,900 = -139,500.

Now the denominator is (31 * 201600) minus (1860)^2.

31 * 201600 = let me compute that. 30*201600=6,048,000. 1*201,600=201,600. So total is 6,048,000 + 201,600 = 6,249,600.

Next, (1860)^2. Hmm, 1860 times 1860. Let's see, 1800^2=3,240,000. Then, 60^2=3,600, and cross terms 2*1800*60=216,000. So adding them: 3,240,000 + 216,000 + 3,600 = 3,459,600.

So denominator is 6,249,600 - 3,459,600 = 2,790,000.

So b = -139500 / 2,790,000. Let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: -1395 / 27,900.

Hmm, let me see if I can simplify this fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 15.

1395 ÷15=93, 27900 ÷15=1860.

So now it's -93/1860. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3.

93 ÷3=31, 1860 ÷3=620.

So now it's -31/620. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 31: 31 ÷31=1, 620 ÷31=20. So b= -1/20 = -0.05.

So the slope b is -0.05. That's the first part of the regression equation.

Now, to find a, the intercept. The formula is a = (ΣY - bΣX)/n.

So ΣY is 465, b is -0.05, ΣX is 1860, n=31.

So a = (465 - (-0.05)(1860)) /31.

First compute (-0.05)(1860) = -93. So 465 - (-93) = 465 +93=558.

So a=558 /31. Let me compute that.

31*18=558, because 30*18=540, and 1*18=18, totaling 558.

So a=18.

Thus, the regression equation is Y = 18 - 0.05X.

Now, looking at the options, option A is Y=18 -0.05X, r=-0.4867; option C is Y=20-0.05X, r=-0.4867; option G is Y=18-0.06X, r=-0.4867; option D is Y=18-0.05X, r=-0.4000; etc.

So the equation matches options A, D, and G. But looking at the equations, option A is correct for the equation. Now, I need to compute the correlation coefficient r.

The formula for r is [nΣXY - ΣXΣY] / sqrt( [nΣX² - (ΣX)^2][nΣY² - (ΣY)^2] )

Wait, no, that's the numerator for b. The actual formula for r is:

r = [nΣXY - ΣXΣY] / sqrt( (nΣX² - (ΣX)^2)(nΣY² - (ΣY)^2) )

Wait, so that's the same numerator as for b, but the denominator is sqrt of the product of the denominators we used earlier.

We already have the numerator as -139500.

Now, compute the denominator: sqrt( (2,790,000) * (nΣY² - (ΣY)^2) )

Wait, let me compute nΣY² - (ΣY)^2 first.

nΣY² =31 *7925. Let's calculate that.

31*7000=217000, 31*925=28,675. So total is 217000 +28,675=245,675.

(ΣY)^2=465^2. Let's compute 465*465.

Well, 400^2=160,000, 65^2=4225, and 2*400*65=52,000. So 160,000 +52,000 +4,225=216,225.

So nΣY² - (ΣY)^2 =245,675 -216,225=29,450.

So the denominator for r is sqrt(2,790,000 *29,450).

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute it step by step.

First, multiply 2,790,000 by 29,450.

Wait, 2,790,000 *29,450 = ?

Hmm, perhaps I can factor it:

2,790,000 = 2.79e6, 29,450=2.945e4.

Multiplying them: 2.79e6 *2.945e4 = (2.79 *2.945) * 1e10.

Wait, 2.79 *2.945. Let's compute that.

2 *2.945=5.89, 0.7 *2.945=2.0615, 0.09*2.945=0.26505. Adding them: 5.89 +2.0615=7.9515 +0.26505=8.21655.

So 8.21655e10.

Taking the square root: sqrt(8.21655e10).

Well, sqrt(8.21655e10) = sqrt(8.21655)*1e5.

sqrt(8.21655) is approximately 2.866, since 2.866^2 ≈8.216.

So sqrt(8.21655e10)=286,600 (approx).

Wait, wait, maybe I'm making a miscalculation here. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, 2,790,000 *29,450 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as:

2,790,000 *29,450 = 2,790,000 * (30,000 - 550) = 2,790,000*30,000 - 2,790,000*550.

Compute each part:

2,790,000 *30,000 = 83,700,000,000

2,790,000 *550 = ?

Compute 2,790,000 *500 =1,395,000,000

2,790,000 *50=139,500,000

So total 1,395,000,000 +139,500,000 =1,534,500,000.

So subtracting: 83,700,000,000 -1,534,500,000 =82,165,500,000.

So the product is 82,165,500,000.

Now, sqrt(82,165,500,000).

Hmm, that's the same as sqrt(8.21655e10), which is approximately 286,650 (since 286,650^2 ≈8.216e10).

Wait, let me check 286,650 squared:

286,650^2 = (2.8665e5)^2 = approx 8.216e10, which matches.

So the denominator is approximately 286,650.

Now, the numerator for r is -139,500.

So r = -139500 / 286650.

Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 150: numerator becomes -930, denominator 1911.

Wait, 139500 ÷150=930, 286650 ÷150=1911.

Hmm, 930 ÷1911 ≈0.4865.

So r≈-0.4865, which is approximately -0.4867 when rounded to four decimal places.

So the correlation coefficient r is approximately -0.4867.

Looking back at the options, the equation Y=18-0.05X is option A and G, but option A has r=-0.4867, which matches our calculation.

Wait, option G has Y=18-0.06X, which is a different slope. So the correct option is A: Y=18 -0.05X, r=-0.4867.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation for r. Did I make any mistakes?

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator part because I think I might have miscalculated.

The denominator is sqrt( (nΣX² - (ΣX)^2) * (nΣY² - (ΣY)^2) )

We have:

nΣX² - (ΣX)^2 =2,790,000

nΣY² - (ΣY)^2=29,450

So the product is 2,790,000 *29,450 =82,165,500,000.

So sqrt(82,165,500,000) = approx 286,650 as before.

So r = -139500 /286,650 ≈-0.4865.

Yes, that's correct. So option A is the right answer.
</think>

To compute the regression line and correlation coefficient, we start by calculating the slope (b) and intercept (a) of the regression line Y = a + bX. Using the given sums:

1. **Slope (b):**
   \[
   b = \frac{n\Sigma XY - \Sigma X \Sigma Y}{n\Sigma X^2 - (\Sigma X)^2} = \frac{31 \times 23400 - 1860 \times 465}{31 \times 201600 - 1860^2} = \frac{-139500}{2790000} = -0.05
   \]

2. **Intercept (a):**
   \[
   a = \frac{\Sigma Y - b \Sigma X}{n} = \frac{465 - (-0.05)(1860)}{31} = \frac{558}{31} = 18
   \]
   Thus, the regression line is \( Y = 18 - 0.05X \).

3. **Correlation Coefficient (r):**
   \[
   r = \frac{n\Sigma XY - \Sigma X \Sigma Y}{\sqrt{(n\Sigma X^2 - (\Sigma X)^2)(n\Sigma Y^2 - (\Sigma Y)^2)}} = \frac{-139500}{\sqrt{2790000 \times 29450}} \approx -0.4867
   \]

The regression line matches option A, and the correlation coefficient is approximately \(-0.4867\).
