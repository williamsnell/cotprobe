Okay, so I've got this question about information theory and dice rolls. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that information theory deals with the amount of information contained in messages, often measured in bits. The key concept here is probably entropy, which quantifies uncertainty or information content.

The question says a man is told that the sum of a pair of dice rolled was a "seven". I need to find out how much information is in this message. The options are various bit values, so I have to calculate the information content.

First, I should figure out the probability of rolling a sum of seven with two dice. A standard die has six faces, so two dice have 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Now, how many of these outcomes result in a sum of seven?

Let me list the combinations that add up to seven:
- 1 and 6
- 2 and 5
- 3 and 4
- 4 and 3
- 5 and 2
- 6 and 1

That's six outcomes. So the probability P of rolling a seven is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6. 

In information theory, the information content I is calculated using the formula I = log2(1/P). So plugging in P = 1/6, I get I = log2(6). Let me compute that. Log base 2 of 6 is approximately 2.585 bits. 

Wait, does that make sense? Because if the probability is lower, the information content should be higher. Since seven is a common sum, it's not the rarest but it's more probable than some other sums. For example, the probability of rolling a two is 1/36, which would give log2(36) ≈5.17 bits, which is much higher. So seven being 1/6, its information is around 2.585 bits. 

Looking at the options, option C is 2.585 bits, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be C.

The information content is calculated using the probability of the event. Rolling a sum of seven with two dice has a probability of 1/6. Using the formula for information content, log2(6) ≈ 2.585 bits.
