Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: If people expect the price of a particular product to increase in the near future, what will happen? The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my basic economics that expectations about future prices can affect current behavior. Let's think about supply and demand. So, if people expect the price to go up, what would that mean for the market?

Well, if consumers think the price is going to be higher later, they might want to buy the product now before it gets more expensive. That would increase the demand for the product in the present. So, higher demand now because they're anticipating higher prices later.

Wait, but what about the supply side? Producers might also react. If they expect the price to rise, maybe they'll hold onto their inventory, hoping to sell it later for a higher price. That would mean they might not supply as much now, or maybe they'll increase production to sell more later. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

But the question is about the effect on demand, right? Because if people expect higher prices, they might rush to buy now, increasing current demand. So looking at the options, E says this will increase the demand for the product. That seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check the options. Option E is about demand, so that's the one. The other options are about supply or no effect. So, the correct answer should be E.
