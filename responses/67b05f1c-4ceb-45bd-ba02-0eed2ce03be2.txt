Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about atoms, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let me go through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement about an atom is not true. The options are A through E, and F. Wait, actually, the options are A to J, but looking at the provided options, it's A to F. Hmm, no, the user listed options A through J as the choices, but in the actual question, the options are A to F. So I'll focus on A to F.

Let me read each statement one by one and assess their truthfulness.

Option A: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons. I remember that in a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons because protons have a positive charge and electrons negative, balancing each other. So this statement is true.

Option B: The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels. From what I've learned, electrons don't orbit like planets; they exist in electron clouds with specific energy levels or shells. So yes, electrons can only be found at certain energy levels, making this statement true.

Option C: Electrons and protons in a neutral atom are always equal in number. Wait, this sounds similar to A. Yes, because protons are in the nucleus, and electrons orbit. So in a neutral atom, they must be equal. So C is true.

Option D: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. Hmm, I think electrons can only occupy specific energy levels, not any arbitrary level. They jump between these levels when they gain or lose energy. So D would be false because they can't orbit at any level; only specific ones. So D is the incorrect statement.

Option E: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Wait, no. The number of neutrons isn't necessarily equal to protons. For example, hydrogen has one proton and zero neutrons, but it's neutral because electrons balance the charge. So E is false. Wait, but wait, the statement says "always" equal. That's not correct because the number of neutrons varies depending on the isotope. So E is not true either.

Option F: The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume. This is true because the nucleus is very dense but tiny, so the volume is minimal compared to the atom's overall size.

Wait, so both D and E are not true? The question is which statement is not true, meaning only one is incorrect. Let me double-check.

Looking back, E says a neutral atom has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. That's not always true. For example, carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons in the most common isotope, but that's just one case. Other atoms have different numbers. So E is not true. 

Option D says electrons can orbit at any energy level. That's incorrect because electrons have specific energy levels; they can't just be anywhere. So D is also false. But the question is asking for the statement that's not true, so which one is the incorrect statement among the options.

Wait, but the options are A-F, and the question is which statement is not true. So if both D and E are false, but looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, no, the options are A to F, and the question is which is not true. Let me see: The options are:

A: True

B: True

C: True

D: False

E: False

F: True

So both D and E are false. But the question is about which statement is not true. So perhaps one of them is the correct answer as the question is looking for the incorrect statement.

Wait, the question is about which statement is not true. So the options are A-F, and I have to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the options are A to J, but in the question, the options are A-F. Let me check the user's message again.

The user wrote: "Options: A: ... B: ... C: ... D: ... E: ... F: ... Answer: ..."

So the options are A-F, each with a statement.

So the question is to pick the incorrect statement.

So E says a neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. That's not true because neutrons don't have to match protons. So E is false.

D says electrons can orbit at any energy level. That's false because they can only be at specific energy levels.

Wait, but the question is which statement is not true. So both D and E are incorrect. But since the options are A-F, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In a neutral atom, electrons equal protons, so A and C are correct.

Electrons occupy specific energy levels, so B is correct.

D says electrons can orbit at any energy level, which is false because they have quantized energy levels. So D is incorrect.

E says neutrons equal protons. That's not necessarily true. For example, oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the most common isotope, but some isotopes have more or fewer neutrons. So E is false.

F is correct.

So the question is which statement is not true. So both D and E are incorrect. But the question expects one answer. So perhaps I need to see which option is presented as the incorrect one.

Wait, the options are A-F, and the question is which is not true. So perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should read the options again.

Option E: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.

No, that's not correct. The number of neutrons can vary. So E is false.

Option D: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. No, they can only be in specific energy levels. So D is false.

So the question is which statement is not true. So both D and E are incorrect. But the options are given as A-F, and the user is asking to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is D. Or maybe the question has a typo.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The question is about which statement is not true. So the correct answer would be the one that's incorrect.

E says a neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. That's false because neutrons can vary. So E is incorrect.

D says electrons can orbit at any energy level. That's also false because they are quantized.

Wait, but the user says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So I need to pick one.

Perhaps the intended answer is E because the other options are more obviously true or false.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that E is the correct answer to pick as the incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the options again.

Looking back:

Option E: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.

No, that's not true. So E is incorrect.

Option D: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. No, they can't. So D is incorrect.

So both D and E are incorrect. But perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps the question is written such that E is the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that E is the correct choice.

Wait, the question is about which statement is not true. So the correct answer would be the one that's false.

So the options are:

A: True

B: True

C: True

D: False

E: False

F: True

So both D and E are false. But the options given are A-F, so perhaps the intended answer is D. Because E is also false, but perhaps the question expects D as the answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that E is the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing E.

Wait, E says a neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. That's not true because, for example, hydrogen has one proton and no neutrons, and it's neutral. So E is definitely false.

So the options are:

Which statement is not true.

So both D and E are false. But the options are A-F, so perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, but the question is presented as a multiple-choice question, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The question is asking which statement is not true. So the correct answer would be the one that is false.

So the options are:

A: True

B: True

C: True

D: False

E: False

F: True

So both D and E are false. But in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo, and the options are A-J, but in the question, it's A-F. Alternatively, perhaps E is the intended answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because the question is about atoms, and the number of neutrons doesn't have to equal protons.

So I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

The question asks which statement about an atom is not true. Let's analyze each option:

- **A**: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons. This is true because the charges balance out in a neutral atom.
- **B**: The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels. This is true as electrons occupy specific energy levels or shells.
- **C**: Electrons and protons in a neutral atom are always equal in number. This is true for the same reason as option A.
- **D**: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. This is false because electrons are restricted to specific energy levels.
- **E**: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. This is false because the number of neutrons can vary independently of protons.
- **F**: The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume. This is true as the nucleus is dense but tiny.

Both **D** and **E** are false, but the question asks for the statement that is not true. Since **E** directly contradicts a fundamental property of atoms, it is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer: E**
