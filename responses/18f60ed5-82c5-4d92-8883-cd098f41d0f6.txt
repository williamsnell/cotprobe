Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about thin film interference. Hmm, thin films... I remember that when light hits a thin film, some of it reflects off the top surface, and some goes through and reflects off the bottom surface. Depending on the thickness and the refractive indices, these two reflected waves can interfere either constructively or destructively.

The question says blue light with a wavelength of 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off an oil film on glass. So, the setup is oil (n=1.2) on glass (n=1.6). Wait, the oil is less dense than glass because the refractive index is lower. So, when light goes from air (n=1) to oil (n=1.2), it's a small increase, and then from oil to glass (n=1.6), a larger increase.

I think the key here is understanding the phase changes upon reflection. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a 180-degree phase shift, which is like a half-wavelength shift. So, when light reflects off the top of the oil film (from air to oil), since oil has a higher index than air (1.2 > 1), there's a phase shift of λ/2. Then, the light that goes through the oil and reflects off the glass: glass has a higher index than oil (1.6 > 1.2), so another phase shift of λ/2 here.

Wait, so both reflections have a phase shift. So the total phase shift between the two reflected waves would be λ/2 + λ/2 = λ. But wait, does that matter for constructive interference?

Wait, no, because when you have two reflections, each causing a phase shift, the total phase difference between the two waves depends on both the path difference and any phase shifts from reflection.

So the condition for constructive interference (since the problem says it's most strongly reflected, which is constructive interference) is that the path difference plus any phase shifts results in a total that's a multiple of the wavelength.

So, let's model this. The first reflection is at the air-oil interface (top of the film), which has a phase shift of λ/2. The second reflection is at the oil-glass interface (bottom), which also has a phase shift of λ/2. So, the total phase shift from reflections is λ/2 + λ/2 = λ. But wait, when two waves interfere, the condition depends on whether their phase shifts cause them to be in or out of phase.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of whether the two reflected waves are in phase or out of phase. The first reflection (air-oil) has a phase shift of 180 degrees (λ/2). The second reflection (oil-glass) also has a phase shift of 180 degrees. So, when these two reflected waves come back, they have each undergone a phase shift of λ/2. But how does this affect their relative phase?

Wait, another approach: the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference plus any phase shifts equals an odd multiple of half-wavelengths. Wait, no, let's get the formula right.

The general condition for constructive interference when you have two reflections (each possibly causing a phase shift) is:

If both reflections cause a phase shift (so 2*λ/2 = λ), then the condition becomes:

2t = (m + 1/2)λ, where t is the film thickness, m is an integer (0,1,2...).

Wait, no, perhaps I should break it down more carefully.

The first reflection (air to oil) has a phase shift of λ/2 because n increases (1 to 1.2). The second reflection (oil to glass) also has a phase shift of λ/2 because n increases again (1.2 to 1.6). So the total phase shift from reflections is λ/2 + λ/2 = λ. But when you add the phase shift from the path difference, which is 2t (since the light goes down the film and back up, so 2t in thickness, which translates to 2t*(n) in wavelength terms, but wait, let me think about the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, the wavelength in the medium is λ/n_medium. So the actual path difference in terms of the wavelength in the medium is (2t) * (n_oil) * (wavelength in vacuum) / wavelength in oil. Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of the wavelength in the film.

Alternatively, the optical path length is 2t*n_oil, because the light travels down t and back up t, each time in the oil. So the optical path difference is 2t*n_oil*(wavelength in vacuum)/(wavelength in oil). Hmm, wait, the wavelength in oil is λ/n_oil, so the optical path length is 2t * n_oil.

Wait, but the phase change from reflection is λ (from the two λ/2 shifts). So the total phase difference would be (2t * n_oil * 2π/λ) + (2π * (λ/(2π)) * (1 + 1)) ), wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, another approach. The condition for constructive interference when there are two reflections is that the path difference plus any additional phase shifts equals an integer multiple of the wavelength.

In this case, both reflections cause a phase shift of λ/2, so the total phase shift from reflections is λ. But since phase is periodic mod λ, a phase shift of λ is equivalent to zero. Wait, no, because in terms of the path, a phase shift of λ would mean an extra wavelength, so it's like adding that to the path.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

For constructive interference, (2t * n_oil) = (m + 1/2) * λ,

where m is an integer, because when you have two reflections that each cause a phase shift of λ/2, the total phase shift is λ, which is equivalent to a path difference of λ. But wait, no, because when you have two phase shifts of λ/2 each, that's a total phase shift of λ. But since the condition for constructive interference is that the total phase difference is an integer multiple of 2π (or full wavelengths), the phase shifts from reflections must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is:

2t * n_oil = (m + 1) * λ/2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the phase changes. So the first reflection (air to oil) causes a phase shift of λ/2. The second reflection (oil to glass) also causes a phase shift of λ/2. So the two reflected waves have a combined phase shift of λ. Now, the path difference is 2t*n_oil*(wavelength in vacuum)/λ, which is 2t*n_oil*(1/λ) * 2π. Wait, perhaps to avoid confusion, let's model the condition as:

The total phase difference between the two reflected waves should be 2π*(m + 1/2), where m is an integer, for constructive interference.

The phase difference comes from two sources: the path difference and the phase shifts upon reflection.

The path difference is 2t*n_oil*(2π/λ), because the light goes down and back up, so 2t in the medium, and the wavelength in the medium is λ/n_oil. So the number of wavelengths in the path is (2t)/(λ/n_oil) )= 2t*n_oil/λ. Thus, the phase from the path is (2π) * (2t*n_oil/λ) = (4π t n_oil)/λ.

The phase shifts from reflection are: first reflection (air-oil) is 180 degrees (π), and second reflection (oil-glass) is another 180 degrees (π). So total phase shift from reflections is π + π = 2π, which is equivalent to zero (since 2π is a full cycle).

So the total phase difference is (4π t n_oil)/λ.

Wait, but wait, when you have phase shifts, you have to add them. So if the two reflections each cause a phase shift of π, then the total phase shift is 2π, which is equivalent to 0 modulo 2π. So, the total phase difference between the two reflected waves is just (4π t n_oil)/λ.

For constructive interference, this phase difference should be an integer multiple of 2π. So,

(4π t n_oil)/λ = 2π m,

where m is an integer.

Dividing both sides by 2π,

(2 t n_oil)/λ = m.

So,

t = (m λ)/(2 n_oil).

We need the minimum thickness, so m=1.

So,

t = (1 * 480 nm) / (2 * 1.2) = 480/(2.4) = 200 nm.

Wait, that gives t=200 nm. Looking at the options, option I is 200 nm. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, because I thought the condition might require a phase shift of λ, leading to a different condition, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me go through this again. The first reflection (air to oil) causes a phase shift of λ/2 because oil has a higher index than air. The second reflection (oil to glass) also causes a phase shift of λ/2 because glass has a higher index than oil. So the total phase shift from reflections is λ/2 + λ/2 = λ. Now, the path difference is 2t n_oil (in terms of optical path length). So the total phase difference is (2t n_oil) * (2π/λ) + 2π (because of the λ phase shift from reflections).

Wait, that's because each reflection contributes a phase of λ/2, which is π in terms of phase (since λ corresponds to 2π). So, two phase shifts of π each sum to 2π, which is equivalent to 0 mod 2π. So the total phase difference is just (2t n_oil) * (2π/λ).

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The general formula for thin film interference when there are two reflections (each causing a phase shift of 180 degrees, which is λ/2) is that the condition for constructive interference is 2t n = (m + 1/2) λ.

Because the two reflections contribute a total phase shift equivalent to a path difference of λ/2. So the formula becomes 2t n = (m + 1/2) λ.

Wait, that makes sense because each reflection gives a phase shift of λ/2, so together they add up to a phase shift of λ. But in terms of the path, that's like having an extra λ/2 path difference because the first reflection is shifted by λ/2, and the second by another λ/2, so the total is λ. But since the path difference is 2t n, the condition for constructive interference is that 2t n equals (m + 1/2) λ.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of m being zero. Let me see.

So the correct condition is:

2 t n = (m + 1/2) λ.

So t = (m + 1/2) λ / (2 n).

We want the minimum thickness, so m=0.

t = (0 + 1/2) * 480 nm / (2 * 1.2) = (0.5 * 480) / 2.4 = 240 / 2.4 = 100 nm.

Wait, that's 100 nm, which is option D. But earlier I thought it was 200 nm. Hmm, now I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to get the correct condition.

When light reflects off a higher index medium, it undergoes a phase shift of λ/2. So in this case, both reflections have a phase shift of λ/2 each. So the two reflections have a total phase shift of λ. But since the path difference is 2t n, the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference plus the phase shifts from reflection equals an integer multiple of λ.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be 2t n = (m) λ, because the two phase shifts add up to λ, which is like adding a full wavelength, which doesn't change the condition. So then the condition is 2t n = m λ.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when you have two phase shifts of λ/2 each, the total is λ, which is equivalent to zero in terms of phase. So the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference is m λ. So 2t n = m λ. Then t= (m λ)/(2 n).

With m=1, t= (480)/(2 * 1.2 ) = 200 nm, which is option I.

But earlier, when I considered m=0, I got 100 nm, but that would be for when the two phase shifts result in a λ phase, which would require the path difference to be an odd multiple of λ/2.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the condition again. The standard formula is:

If the two reflected waves undergo an even number of phase inversions (e.g., both have a phase shift of λ/2, so total phase shift is λ), then the condition for constructive interference is 2t n = m λ.

If there's an odd number of phase inversions (like one reflection causes a phase shift, the other doesn't), then the condition is 2t n = (m + 1/2) λ.

In this problem, both reflections cause a phase shift, so it's an even number (2) of phase inversions, each of λ/2. So the total phase shift from reflections is λ, which is equivalent to zero. So the condition becomes 2t n = m λ.

Therefore, for the minimum thickness (m=1), t = (1 * 480)/(2 * 1.2) = 480/(2.4)=200 nm.

So the answer should be 200 nm, which is option I.

To determine the minimum thickness of the oil film, we analyze the interference condition for light reflecting off the thin film. The setup involves light reflecting off two surfaces: air-oil and oil-glass. Both reflections cause a phase shift of λ/2 because the refractive index increases at each interface (air to oil, and oil to glass). The total phase shift from reflections is therefore λ, which is equivalent to zero modulo 2π.

The path difference for the reflected waves is determined by the optical path length, which is \( 2t \cdot n_{\text{oil}} \), where \( t \) is the thickness of the oil film and \( n_{\text{oil}} = 1.2 \). For constructive interference, the total phase difference (path difference plus phase shifts) must be an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \). Since the phase shifts from reflections do not contribute an additional path difference, the condition simplifies to:

\[
2t \cdot n_{\text{oil}} = m \lambda
\]

where \( m \) is an integer. To find the minimum thickness, we set \( m = 1 \):

\[
t = \frac{m \lambda}{2 n_{\text{oil}}}
\]

Substituting the given values (\( \lambda = 480 \, \text{nm} \) and \( n_{\text{oil}} = 1.2 \)):

\[
t = \frac{1 \cdot 480}{2 \cdot 1.2} = \frac{480}{2.4} = 200 \, \text{nm}
\]

Thus, the minimum thickness of the oil film is **200 nm**, corresponding to option I.
