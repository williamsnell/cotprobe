Okay, so I've got this question about PCA and SVD, and I need to figure out what to do in PCA to get the same projection as SVD. Hmm, I remember that both PCA and SVD are dimensionality reduction techniques, but they have some differences in how they're applied.

Wait, PCA is usually applied to the covariance matrix of the data, right? So you first center the data by subtracting the mean, which makes it zero mean. SVD, on the other hand, can be applied directly to the data matrix without centering, but I think the projections might differ because SVD doesn't assume that the data is centered.

So the question is asking what transformation in PCA would make its projection match SVD's. I think the key here is that PCA typically centers the data, which SVD doesn't do by default. So if PCA didn't center the data, its projection would be different. Therefore, to make PCA's projection the same as SVD's, we must ensure that PCA doesn't perform any centering. But wait, normally PCA does center the data. So maybe the opposite is neededâ€”like not transforming it in a certain way.

Wait, no. Let me think again. PCA involves computing the covariance matrix, which requires the data to be centered (subtracting the mean). SVD doesn't require this step. So if we don't subtract the mean in PCA, would it then be like SVD? Or is it that without centering, PCA would behave differently.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is that PCA and SVD give the same projection when the data is centered. Because PCA's covariance matrix is equivalent to the data matrix multiplied by its transpose after centering. SVD, when applied to the centered data matrix, would give the same principal components as PCA. So perhaps the question is about what PCA step ensures that.

Wait, the question is phrased as: what would you do in PCA to get the same projection as SVD? So in PCA, you'd have to do something specific so that its projection matches SVD's. Since SVD doesn't assume centered data, but PCA does, perhaps the answer is that you don't do any centering in PCA, but that's not an option here.

Wait, looking at the options: option I is "Transform data to zero mean," which is the standard step in PCA. So if PCA does that, then PCA's projection would match SVD's when SVD is applied to the centered data. But the question seems to be asking what PCA needs to do to match SVD's projection, assuming that SVD is applied without centering. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that PCA and SVD give the same projection when PCA is applied without centering. But I think the standard PCA does center the data, so if you don't center it, then PCA's projection would be different from SVD's.

Wait, but the question is about what to do in PCA to get the same projection as SVD. So if SVD is applied to the raw data (without centering), then PCA, which centers the data, would have a different projection. Therefore, to make PCA's projection match SVD's, PCA should not subtract the mean. But the options don't have an "don't subtract the mean" option. Let me check the options again.

Options are A to J. Option I is "Transform data to zero mean," which is what PCA does. So if PCA does that, then its projection is different from SVD, which doesn't do that. So to get the same projection, PCA shouldn't subtract the mean. But the question is, what would you do in PCA to get the same as SVD. So perhaps the answer is that you don't do any transformation except what SVD does, which is none. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another angle: PCA computes the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix (which is data centered), while SVD computes the singular vectors of the data matrix. If the data is not centered, then the principal components from PCA and SVD would differ. So if we don't center the data in PCA, then PCA would compute the same as SVD. But PCA typically does center the data. So the question is, what step in PCA would make it not center the data? Well, in practice, if you skip the centering step in PCA, then it's equivalent to applying SVD on the data matrix. So the answer would be that in PCA, you don't subtract the mean. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back at the options: option I is "Transform data to zero mean," which is the standard step. If PCA does that, its projection is different from SVD. To match SVD, PCA shouldn't subtract the mean. But the options don't have that as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is "None of these," because the question is about what PCA needs to do, but none of the options are correct.

Wait, but let me think again. PCA and SVD are related but not the same. PCA involves centering, SVD doesn't. So if you apply SVD directly to the data matrix, you get something different from PCA. But if you apply SVD to the centered data matrix, then the principal components would be the same as PCA's. So the question is what PCA needs to do to match SVD's projection. So if PCA doesn't center the data, then its projection would match SVD's when SVD is applied to the raw data.

But the options don't include "don't subtract the mean." The options are about transformations. So maybe the correct answer is that you don't do anything in PCA that SVD doesn't do, so the answer is none of these, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that you don't need to do anything because PCA and SVD are the same when the data is centered. Wait, no. PCA uses the covariance matrix, which is (X^T X)/n after centering. SVD on X gives the same principal components as PCA when X is centered. So if PCA is applied correctly (centering the data), then PCA's projection is the same as SVD's projection on the centered data. But the question is about getting the same projection as SVD, which might be applied without centering.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it step by step.

- PCA standard step: center data (subtract mean), compute covariance, eigenvectors, etc.
- SVD: decomposes the data matrix into U, S, V. The right singular vectors (V) are the principal components if the data is centered.

So if in PCA, you don't subtract the mean, then PCA's projection would be different from SVD's. But if you do subtract the mean, then PCA's projection matches SVD's when SVD is applied to the centered data.

But the question is asking what to do in PCA to get the same projection as SVD. So if SVD is applied without centering, then PCA would have to not center the data. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is that you don't need to do anything; it's already the case when you apply PCA correctly, which includes centering. But that's not matching the question.

Wait, the question is phrased as: what would you do in PCA to get the same projection as SVD. So SVD's projection is perhaps without any centering. So to match that, PCA must not subtract the mean. But if the options don't include that, then perhaps the correct answer is "None of these," because the question is implying that you have to do something, but in reality, PCA and SVD are different unless PCA is applied without centering, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that you don't need to do anything in PCA because PCA and SVD are equivalent under certain conditions. But that's not exactly right because they differ in the step of centering.

Wait, I think the key is that PCA requires centering, while SVD does not. So to get the same projection as SVD, PCA must not perform the centering step. But in the options, the only step that deals with centering is option I, which is to transform to zero mean. So if PCA does that (option I), then it's not the same as SVD. Therefore, to get the same projection as SVD, PCA must not do that. But the options don't have that as a choice. So the answer must be that none of these options apply, hence option C.

The question asks what transformation in PCA would make its projection match SVD's. PCA typically involves centering the data (subtracting the mean), while SVD does not require this step. If PCA is applied without centering, its projection would align with SVD's projection. However, the options provided do not include an option for not subtracting the mean. The standard PCA process includes centering the data (option I), which results in a different projection compared to SVD. Since none of the options directly address the necessary adjustment to make PCA's projection match SVD's, the correct answer is "None of these."

Answer: C
