Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about break-even points. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on break-even analysis, but I'll try to think it through.

Break-even point is where the total cost equals total revenue, right? So for each option, I need to find the value of x where C equals R. Let's go through each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): C = $10x + $600 and R = $30x. So, set 10x + 600 equal to 30x. Let me write that down:

10x + 600 = 30x

Subtracting 10x from both sides gives 600 = 20x. Dividing both sides by 20 gives x = 30. Wait, but looking at the options, when I check, I'm not seeing 30 in the answers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. 30x -10x is 20x, and 600 = 20x. So x is 30. But the options don't have 30. Did I miss something? Oh wait, maybe I should check the other options first.

Option A says 32, 72, 480, 4 4/7. Hmm, none of the options have 30, so perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the break-even is when total costs equal total revenue, but perhaps I'm not considering the units correctly. Oh, no, x is units, so 30 units would be the correct answer. But looking at the options, the first number in each option is the break-even for each part.

Wait, let me check part (b): C =5x +200 and R=8x. So 5x +200 =8x. Subtract 5x: 200=3x. So x=200/3 ≈66.666... So that's 66 and 2/3, which is 66.666... units. Looking at the options, option I has 30, 66.666, 500, 4 2/7. So part (b) would be 66.666, which is option I's second number.

But wait, the problem is asking for the break-even for each part. Let's go through each part again.

(a) C=10x+600, R=30x. 10x +600=30x → 20x=600 → x=30 units.

(b) C=5x+200, R=8x → 5x+200=8x →3x=200 → x=200/3 ≈66.6667.

(c) C=0.2x +50, R=0.3x →0.2x +50=0.3x →50=0.1x →x=500 units.

(d) C=1800x +3000, R=2500x →1800x +3000=2500x →3000=700x →x=3000/700=300/70=30/7 ≈4.2857 units. Wait, but 30/7 is approximately 4.2857, which is 4 and 2/7. So that's 4.2857 units.

So the break-even for each part would be:

a) 30

b) 200/3 ≈66.6667

c)500

d)30/7 ≈4.2857

Wait, but looking at the options, the first number is the break even for part (a), the second for (b), etc.

So the four break-even points are:

a)30, b)66.6667, c)500, d)4.2857.

Looking at the options, each option has four numbers. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A to J, each with four numbers. Let me check each option:

Option I: 30, 66(2/3), 500, 4(2/7). So 30 (part a), 200/3 (part b), 500 (part c), 30/7 (part d). So that's exactly matching.

Option I's numbers: 30, 66.666..., 500, 4 2/7. Which matches our calculations.

So the correct option should be I.

The correct answer is **I: 30 units, 66(2/3) units, 500 units, 4(2/7) units**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the break-even point for each part:**
   - **Part (a):** Set \( C = R \), so \( 10x + 600 = 30x \). Solving gives \( x = 30 \) units.
   - **Part (b):** Set \( C = R \), so \( 5x + 200 = 8x \). Solving gives \( x = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.6667 \) units.
   - **Part (c):** Set \( C = R \), so \( 0.2x + 50 = 0.3x \). Solving gives \( x = 500 \) units.
   - **Part (d):** Set \( C = R \), so \( 1800x + 3000 = 2500x \). Solving gives \( x = \frac{3000}{700} = \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.2857 \) or \( 4\frac{2}{7} \) units.

2. **Match the calculated break-even points to the options:**
   - **Option I:** 30, \( \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.6667 \), 500, \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4\frac{2}{7} \).
   - This exactly matches the break-even points calculated for each part.

Thus, the correct option is **I**.

**ANSWER: I**
