Okay, so I've got this question about the human genome and what fraction of it encodes proteins. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about genetics, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers. Let me think this through.

First, I know that the human genome is made up of DNA, and most of it is in the form of genes. Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins, right? But wait, I've also heard that a lot of the genome doesn't code for proteins. There's a lot of non-coding regions. I think those are sometimes called "junk DNA," but I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate because some of it might have functions we don't fully understand yet.

So the question is asking what fraction of the genome actually encodes proteins. The options are A to J, with percentages ranging from 2% to 90%. I remember that the figure is much lower than I initially thought. I think it's around 1-5%, but I'm not certain. Let me try to recall some specific numbers.

I think the human genome is about 3 billion base pairs long. If about 1% of that is coding, that would be 30 million base pairs. But wait, maybe it's a bit higher. I've heard that approximately 1.5% to 2% of the genome is coding. So looking at the options, option I is 2%, which fits into that range.

Wait, but another thought: I've also heard that some sources say about 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins. So 2% is close to that. But I'm not sure if it's exactly 2% or a bit lower. Let me think about other sources. I remember reading that about 98-99% of the genome is non-coding, which would mean that about 1-2% is coding. So 2% makes sense.

Let me check other options to make sure. Option B is 5%, which seems a bit high. I don't think 5% is right because I remember the number being lower. Option F is 10%, which is even higher. No, that's too much. Option J is 35%, which is way too high. So the correct answer should be around 1-2%, which is option I: 2%.

Wait, but I've also heard that some estimates include other factors. For example, introns are non-coding regions within genes, but the exons (coding parts) make up a smaller portion. So maybe the total coding regions are about 1.5%, but the question is asking for the fraction that encodes proteins. So I think 2% is the closest correct answer among the options given.

The question asks what fraction of the human genome encodes proteins. The human genome is approximately 3 billion base pairs long, with a significant portion of it being non-coding. While about 1-2% of the genome is coding, the exact figure is often cited as around 1.5%. Among the options provided, 2% (option I) is the closest and most reasonable estimate. Other options, such as 5%, 10%, or higher, are too high based on known data.

Answer: I
