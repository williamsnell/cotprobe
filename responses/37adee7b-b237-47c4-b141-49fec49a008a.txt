Okay, so I've got this problem about a cumulative compound motor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my motor types, but I remember that cumulative compound motors have both series and parallel (shunt) fields. The way they work is that the series field adds to the shunt field, which makes the motor's flux increase with the armature current. 

The problem says the load varies, so the armature current changes from 50 amps to 100 amps. The question is about the ratio of torques developed at these two currents. I think torque in a motor depends on the flux and the armature current. The formula I remember is Torque (T) is proportional to flux (φ) multiplied by armature current (Ia), so T = kφIa, where k is some constant.

Wait, but in a cumulative compound motor, the flux isn't just from the shunt field. The series field contributes too, so when the armature current changes, the series field current changes, which affects the total flux. The problem states that the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10 amp of armature current. So, for each 10 amps, the flux changes by 3%. 

Let me break this down. The armature current goes from 50A to 100A, which is an increase of 50A. Since for every 10A, flux changes by 3%, then for 50A, that's 5 intervals of 10A. So 5 times 3% is 15%. Wait, but does that mean the flux increases by 15%? Or does it compound each time? Hmm, no, the problem says it's a varying load, so I think it's a linear change per 10A. So from 50A to 100A is 50A increase, which is 5 steps of 10A, so 5 *3% =15% increase in flux. So the flux at 100A is 115% of the flux at 50A.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The series current is part of the armature current. So when the armature current increases, the series field current also increases. The problem says that the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10A. So when the armature current increases by 10A, the flux increases by 3%. 

So from 50A to 100A, that's a 50A increase. So 50A divided by 10A per step is 5 steps. Each step is a 3% increase. So the flux increases by 5 * 3% =15% overall. So flux at 100A is 1.15 times the flux at 50A.

Now, the torque is proportional to flux times armature current. So torque at 50A (T1) is φ1 * 50. Torque at 100A (T2) is φ2 *100. The ratio T2/T1 would be (φ2 *100) / (φ1 *50) = (φ2/φ1) * 2. 

Since φ2 is 1.15 φ1, the ratio becomes 1.15 * 2 = 2.3. Wait, but none of the options is exactly 2.3. Let me check the options again. The options are A:2.26, B:0.66, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the flux change.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10A of armature current. So for each 10A increase in armature current, the flux increases by 3%. So from 50A to 100A, the change is 50A, which is 5 increments of 10A. So each 10A adds 3%, so 5*3% =15%. So the flux increases by 15% overall.

So φ2 = φ1 * 1.15. So torque at 100A is (1.15φ1) *100. Torque at 50A is φ1 *50. So the ratio T2/T1 is (1.15 *100)/(50) = (115)/(50) = 2.3. But looking at the options, the closest is A:2.26 and E:2.89, but 2.3 isn't there. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 3% change is per 10A of series current, not armature current. Oh, but in a cumulative compound motor, the series field current is the same as the armature current. Because in a cumulative compound motor, the series field is part of the armature circuit. So when the armature current is Ia, the series field current is also Ia. So when Ia increases, Is also increases. So the flux change is based on the series current, which is the same as Ia. So for each 10A increase in Ia, the flux increases by 3%.

So from 50A to 100A, that's a 50A increase. So 5 steps of 10A, each adding 3%, so 15% increase in flux. So φ2 =1.15 φ1.

Then, torque ratio is (φ2 * Ia2) / (φ1 * Ia1) = (1.15 φ1 * 100) / (φ1 *50) = 1.15 * 2 = 2.3.

But the options don't have 2.3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way the flux changes. Maybe it's multiplicative, not additive. Let's think again. If each 10A adds 3%, then for 50A, it's 5 steps. So the flux increases by (1+0.03)^5. Because each 10A step multiplies the flux by 1.03. So for 50A, that's 5 steps, so 1.03^5.

Calculating 1.03^5: Let's compute that. 1.03^1=1.03, ^2=1.0609, ^3≈1.0927, ^4≈1.1255, ^5≈1.1593. So approximately 15.93% increase, so φ2 ≈1.1593 φ1.

So then, T2/T1 = (1.1593 φ1 *100)/(φ1 *50) = (1.1593 *100)/50 = 2.3186. Hmm, that's about 2.32. Now, looking at the options, option A is 2.26 and E is 2.89. 2.32 is closer to 2.26 than 2.89, but it's not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the 3% is the percentage change per 10A, so the change is 3% per 10A, so for 50A, the flux at 50A is φ1, and at 100A, the flux is φ1 + (100-50)/10 *3% = φ1 + 5*3% = φ1 +15%. So 1.15 φ1. So same as before.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the flux increases by 3% for each 10A of series current. Since the series current is Ia, so for each 10A of Ia, flux increases by 3%. So for Ia from 50 to 100, that's 50A, so 5*3% =15% increase. So φ2=1.15φ1.

So T2 = φ2 * Ia2 =1.15 φ1 *100.

T1=φ1 *50.

So T2/T1 = (1.15 *100)/(50) =2.3.

But the options don't have 2.3. Wait, the options are A:2.26, E:2.89, etc. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the exponentials earlier. Let me check 1.03^5 again. 1.03^5 is approximately 1.15927, so about 15.93%. So T2/T1 is 1.15927 *2 ≈2.3185. So approximately 2.32.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:2.26, which is 2.26. Hmm, but 2.32 isn't exactly there. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the flux at 100A is 1.15 times, without considering the compounding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that for each 10A of armature current, the flux increases by 3%, so from 50A to 100A, that's 50A, so 5 steps, each adding 3%, so total 15% increase. So φ2=1.15φ1.

So torque ratio is (1.15 *100)/(50) =2.3.

But since the options don't have 2.3, perhaps the correct answer is option A:2.26, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the torque is proportional to φ * Ia, but if the motor is cumulative compound, the total flux is the sum of the series and shunt fluxes. But in this problem, perhaps the shunt flux remains constant, and the series flux increases with Ia. So total flux φ_total = φ_shunt + φ_series.

But the problem states that the series field current causes the air gap flux to change by 3% for each 10A of armature current. So perhaps the series flux is proportional to Ia, and the shunt flux is constant.

Wait, but in a cumulative compound motor, the series field is in series with the armature, so when Ia increases, the series current Is increases, which increases the series flux. The shunt field is in parallel, so its current is fixed (assuming the field is fed from a separate source, which it usually is). So the total flux is φ_total = φ_shunt + φ_series.

But the problem says the series field current causes the flux to change by 3% per 10A of Ia. So perhaps the series flux is changing, and the shunt flux is constant.

Wait, but in that case, the total flux would be φ_total = φ_shunt + Is * R_shunt (assuming R_shunt is the resistance of the series field). So if Is increases, φ_series increases.

But the problem states that the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10A of armature current. So perhaps the change in flux is due to the series field, and the total flux is the sum of shunt and series.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says that for each 10A increase in armature current, the flux increases by 3%. So from 50A to 100A, the flux increases by 15%, as calculated earlier.

So T2/T1 = (1.15 *100)/(50) =2.3.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the flux increases by 3% per 10A of series current, which is the same as armature current. So from 50A to 100A, it's 50A, so 5 steps of 3%, making a total of 15% increase. So same result.

Wait, looking back at the options, I see option A is 2.26, which is close to 2.3. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the flux change as 3% per 10A, but starting from 50A, which is 5 steps, but perhaps the initial flux is at 50A, and then each step is 10A more. Wait, no, the problem states that the series current causes the flux to change by 3% for each 10A of armature current. So regardless of where you start, each 10A adds 3%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change per 10A as a relative change, not absolute. So for each 10A, the flux increases by 3% of its current value. So it's a multiplicative factor each time.

Let me model this. Let's say that for each 10A increase in Ia, the flux increases by 3% of its current value. So the flux grows exponentially.

So from 50A to 100A, that's 5 steps of 10A each. So the flux at 50A is φ1. After each 10A, the flux increases by 3%. So after 10A: φ1 *1.03.

After 20A: φ1*(1.03)^2.

...

After 50A (5 steps): φ1*(1.03)^5 ≈1.1593 φ1.

So same as before. So T2/T1 is (1.1593*100)/(50) =2.3186, which is approximately 2.32.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:2.26, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using simple addition, not multiplication, so 15% increase, leading to 2.3.

But since 2.3 isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is considering that the torque is proportional to (flux)*(armature current), but the flux includes both series and shunt fields. Wait, but the problem states that the series field is causing the flux change, so perhaps the shunt flux is constant, and the series flux is changing.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let's say that the series field flux is varying, and the shunt flux is constant. So the total flux at 50A is φ_shunt + φ_series_50.

At 100A, it's φ_shunt + φ_series_100.

The problem says that the series current causes the flux to change by 3% per 10A of Ia. So if Ia increases by 10A, the series flux increases by 3% of its previous value.

Wait, but that might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the series flux increases by 3% per 10A of Ia. So for each 10A, the series flux increases by 3% of the initial series flux. So it's an additive 3% per 10A.

Wait, but that would make the series flux at 50A be initial series flux plus (50/10)*3% =15%.

But that's the same as before. So the total flux would be φ_shunt + φ_series_50 and φ_shunt + φ_series_100, where φ_series_100 = φ_series_50 *1.15.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should just go with the initial assumption that the flux increases by 15%, leading to a torque ratio of 2.3, and since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.26, which is approximately 2.26, close to 2.3.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the flux increases by 3% per 10A, but starting from zero. No, that doesn't make sense because flux can't be zero.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the series field current is in addition to the armature current. No, in a series compound motor, the series field is part of the armature circuit, so the series current is the same as the armature current.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the flux is proportional to the series current. So flux is proportional to Ia. So when Ia increases from 50 to 100, the flux doubles. But that would make torque ratio (2*100)/(50) =4, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute 1.03^5 precisely. 1.03^5 is:

1.03 *1.03 =1.0609

1.0609 *1.03 ≈1.092727

1.092727 *1.03 ≈1.125508

1.125508 *1.03 ≈1.159273

So 1.159273. So 1.159273 *2 =2.318546.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:2.26, which is 2.26. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate 1.03^5 as 1.159, leading to 2.318, which is approximately 2.32, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.26.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use simple percentage increase, not compounding. So 5 steps of 3% each, totaling 15%, leading to 2.3. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A:2.26, which is 2.26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem says the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10 amp of armature current. So, for each 10A increase in Ia, the flux increases by 3% of the original flux (not cumulative). So from 50A to 60A: flux increases by 3%, from 60A to70A: another 3%, etc., up to 100A, which is 5 steps, each adding 3%, so 15% total increase. So φ2=1.15 φ1.

So torque ratio is (1.15 *100)/(50) =2.3.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.26, which is approximately 2.26, close to 2.3.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the flux changes by 3% per 10A, but the initial flux is at 50A, and the change is calculated as 3% of 50A's flux for each 10A step. Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the torque proportional to (flux)*(Ia), but the flux is proportional to Ia as well, making torque proportional to Ia^2. But that would be the case if the flux is proportional to Ia, which would make torque proportional to Ia^2. But in that case, the ratio would be (100/50)^2=4, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the series field is such that the flux is proportional to Ia, so φ =k*Ia. Then torque T=φ*Ia= k Ia^2. So T2/T1=(Ia2/Ia1)^2= (100/50)^2=4. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.

"A cumulative compound motor has a varying load upon it which requires a variation in armature current from 50 amp to 100 amp. If the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3 percent for each 10 amp of armature current, find the ratio of torques developed for the two values of armature current."

So, the flux change is due to the series field current, which is the same as Ia. So for each 10A increase in Ia, the flux increases by 3%, so from 50A to 100A, that's 5 steps, each adding 3%, so 15% increase in flux.

So, T1=φ1 *50.

T2=φ2 *100 =1.15φ1 *100.

Ratio T2/T1= (1.15*100)/50=2.3.

But since 2.3 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.26, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the flux increases by 3% for each 10A, but starting from the initial value. So for Ia=50A, the flux is φ1. When Ia increases by 10A to 60A, flux increases by 3% to 1.03φ1. Then another 10A to 70A, flux increases another 3% to 1.03*1.03φ1=1.0609φ1, and so on until 100A.

So after 5 steps, the flux is 1.03^5 φ1≈1.1593φ1.

So T2/T1= (1.1593 *100)/50=2.3186, which is approximately 2.32.

Again, the closest option is A:2.26, which is 2.26. But wait, perhaps the problem is using a different method. Maybe the flux change is 3% per 10A, but the calculation is done as a continuous function.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a linear approximation, treating the flux as changing by 0.3% per amp (3% per 10A). So for 50A, the flux would be φ1 + (50/10)*3% =15% increase, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply expecting us to calculate the ratio as (1.15 *100)/(50)=2.3, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.26.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate 1.03^5 as 1.159, which is approximately 1.16, leading to 1.16*2=2.32, which is close to 2.3, but again not matching the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 2.26, which is 2.26, and option E is 2.89. Hmm, 2.26 is 2.26, which is 2.26, which is about 2.26. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the flux increases by 3% per 10A, but the initial flux is at 50A, and then for each 10A beyond that, it adds 3%. So from 50A to 100A is 50A, which is 5 steps of 10A, so 5*3%=15% increase in flux.

So, the torque ratio would be (1.15 *100)/(50)=2.3.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A:2.26, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the flux increases by 3% for each 10A, but the 3% is of the initial flux, not the current one. So each 10A adds 3% of the initial flux, making the total increase 15% of the initial flux. So φ2=φ1 +0.15φ1=1.15φ1. So same as before.

I think I've exhausted the possibilities. The correct ratio is approximately 2.3, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.26, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the flux increases by 3% for each 10A, but the initial flux is at 50A, and then for each 10A beyond that, the flux increases by 3% of the initial flux. So from 50A to 100A, that's 5 steps, each adding 3% of φ1. So total increase is 15% of φ1, making φ2=1.15φ1. So same as before.

So, the ratio remains 2.3. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.26.

But wait, looking at the options again, option A is 2.26, which is approximately 2.26. Now, 2.3 is closer to 2.26 than to 2.89. So perhaps the intended answer is A:2.26.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the torque per ampere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the torque is given by T = k φ Ia. If the flux increases by 3% per 10A, then for Ia=50A, flux is φ1. For Ia=100A, flux is φ1 + (100-50)/10 *3% = φ1 +15%=1.15φ1.

So T2/T1 = (1.15φ1 *100)/(φ1 *50) = (1.15 *100)/50 =2.3.

But since 2.3 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A:2.26.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the flux increases by 3% per 10A, but the increase is based on the original flux, not compounding. So from 50A to 100A, that's 50A, which is 5 steps of 10A, each adding 3% of the original flux. So φ2=1.15φ1.

So same as before.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The closest option to 2.3 is A:2.26, so I'll go with that.
</think>

The problem involves a cumulative compound motor where the armature current varies from 50 A to 100 A, causing the air-gap flux to change by 3% for each 10 A increase in armature current. Torque in a motor is proportional to the product of flux (φ) and armature current (Ia), i.e., \( T \propto \phi I_a \).

For each 10 A increase in armature current, the flux increases by 3%. From 50 A to 100 A, this represents a 50 A increase, which translates to 5 steps of 10 A. Each step adds 3%, resulting in a total flux increase of \( 5 \times 3\% = 15\% \). Thus, the flux at 100 A is \( \phi_2 = 1.15 \phi_1 \), where \( \phi_1 \) is the flux at 50 A.

The torque at 50 A (\( T_1 \)) is \( T_1 = \phi_1 \times 50 \), and the torque at 100 A (\( T_2 \)) is \( T_2 = \phi_2 \times 100 = 1.15 \phi_1 \times 100 \). The ratio of torques is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1.15 \phi_1 \times 100}{\phi_1 \times 50} = \frac{1.15 \times 100}{50} = 2.3
\]

However, 2.3 is not an exact match to any of the provided options. The closest option is **A: 2.26**, which is approximately 2.26. Given the available choices, the most reasonable answer is:

**A: 2.26**

ANSWER: A
