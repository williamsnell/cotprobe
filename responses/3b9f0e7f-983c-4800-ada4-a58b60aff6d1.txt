Okay, so I've come across this question about brain scans and which one would be most useful in disproving the statement that "Most people only use 10 percent of their brains." I'm not super familiar with all the different types of brain scans, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the idea that we only use 10% of our brains is a common myth. So, the question is asking which imaging technique would help disprove this. To do that, the scan should show that more than 10% of the brain is active under normal circumstances.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

A: CAT scan. I think CAT stands for Computerized Axial Tomography. It's good for showing structural details of the brain, like tumors or injuries. But I'm not sure if it shows real-time activity. Maybe it's not the best for measuring brain activity percentage.

B: X-ray. X-rays are mainly for bones and can sometimes image other dense structures, but the brain isn't that dense. Plus, X-rays don't show soft tissue details well, so probably not useful here.

C: EEG. Electroencephalogram measures electrical activity on the surface of the scalp. It's used to detect things like seizures or sleep stages. But since it's on the scalp, it might not give a full picture of all the brain's activity. Also, it's more about electrical signals than overall brain usage.

D: PET scan. Positron Emission Tomography uses a radioactive tracer to show metabolic activity. I think it can show which areas of the brain are active by measuring glucose usage. That sounds promising because if most of the brain is active, PET could show higher metabolism across more regions.

E: MRI. Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides detailed images of soft tissues, including the brain. It can show structure, but does it show activity? I think there are functional MRIs, like fMRI, which do show activity. But regular MRI might not be the same.

F: SPECT. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography is similar to PET but uses different tracers. It also shows metabolic activity. So maybe similar to PET in this aspect.

G: MRA. Magnetic Resonance Angiography is a type of MRI that focuses on blood vessels. It's useful for looking at blood flow and detecting things like aneurysms. Not sure about measuring brain activity.

H: Ultrasound. Uses sound waves to image structures, mostly used for things like pregnancies or heart issues. The brain is surrounded by skull bone, which might limit its effectiveness for detailed imaging.

I: DTI. Diffusion Tensor Imaging is a type of MRI that looks at the white matter tracts in the brain. It's useful for studying things like multiple sclerosis or brain connectivity, but I'm not sure it's used to measure overall brain activity.

J: fMRI. Functional MRI detects changes in blood flow related to neural activity. It's commonly used to see which parts of the brain are active during specific tasks. Since it's functional, it should be good at showing which areas are being used.

So, the goal is to show that more than 10% of the brain is active. Methods that show metabolism or blood flow are probably the best. PET and fMRI both seem relevant. PET shows metabolic activity, which correlates with brain usage, while fMRI shows changes in blood flow as a result of neural activity.

But which one would be more useful for disproving the 10% claim? PET can show the overall metabolic activity across the brain, which might give a clearer picture of how much of the brain is being used on average. fMRI is more task-specific, showing activity in response to specific stimuli, but maybe not the baseline activity.

Wait, but if the question is about disproving the myth, perhaps showing that even at rest, more than 10% is active. I think resting-state fMRI can show that. But alternatively, PET scans can show continuous metabolic activity, which is a measure of overall usage.

Alternatively, maybe both PET and fMRI are good, but the question is asking for the most useful. I'm trying to remember which scan is typically used to show overall brain activity percentage.

I think PET scans are often used in studies that measure total brain glucose metabolism, which can indicate the percentage of the brain being used. For example, studies have shown that even at rest, the brain uses about 20% of the body's glucose, which would correspond to a significant portion of the brain's neurons being active. So a PET scan could effectively show that more than 10% is being used.

On the other hand, fMRI is excellent for mapping specific areas activated during tasks but might not give a comprehensive view of overall usage unless many tasks are performed. So for disproving the myth, a PET scan might be more direct in showing the overall metabolic activity.

Wait, but the question is about which scan would be most useful. So between D (PET) and J (fMRI), which is better? I think both are valid, but perhaps PET is better for showing overall usage without being task-dependent.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is fMRI because it's more commonly used for showing active regions in the brain, and the 10% myth is about usage in general. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think again. The 10% figure is a rough estimate, but in reality, most of the brain is active. Both PET and fMRI can show this. But in terms of the method, which one is more suited to measure overall activity percentage.

I think PET is better for that because it measures metabolism across the entire brain, providing a percentage of activity. Whereas fMRI shows activation in specific regions during tasks but might not give a global percentage as effectively.

So, the answer would be either D (PET) or J (fMRI). But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is fMRI because it's more commonly associated with showing which parts are active, and thus can demonstrate that more than 10% is used.

Wait, but the question is which scan would be most useful in disproving the statement. If the statement is that only 10% is used, then showing that more is used would be the goal. Both PET and fMRI can do that, but perhaps fMRI is more suited to show the areas being used during various tasks, thereby demonstrating higher usage.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is fMRI because it's more detailed and widely used for functional studies. I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is either D or J.

Wait, another angle: The 10% figure is often cited as the percentage of brain volume used. PET measures metabolic activity, which would correlate with the percentage of the brain's neurons being active. So if a PET scan shows that, say, 20% of the brain's metabolic activity is occurring at rest, that would directly counter the 10% claim.

In that case, the answer would be D: PET.

But I'm still a bit uncertain. Alternatively, maybe fMRI is better because it can show that even at rest, a significant portion is active. However, I think PET is more about metabolism and overall usage.

I think I'll go with D: PET as the answer.

The question asks which brain scan would be most useful in disproving the statement that "Most people only use 10 percent of their brains." To address this, the scan should demonstrate that more than 10% of the brain is active under normal circumstances. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: CAT** and **B: X-ray** are primarily used for structural imaging and do not measure brain activity.
- **C: EEG** detects electrical activity on the scalp but does not provide a comprehensive view of the entire brain's activity.
- **D: PET** measures metabolic activity using a radioactive tracer, which correlates with brain function. It can show overall metabolic activity across the brain, making it effective for disproving the 10% claim.
- **E: MRI** provides structural details, but regular MRI does not measure activity. Functional MRI (fMRI) is task-specific and can show active regions, but it may not provide a global percentage of activity.
- **F: SPECT** is similar to PET but less commonly used for this purpose.
- **G: MRA** focuses on blood vessels and is not suitable for measuring brain activity.
- **H: Ultrasound** is not effective for detailed brain imaging due to the skull.
- **I: DTI** examines white matter connectivity and is not relevant for measuring overall activity.
- **J: fMRI** detects blood flow changes related to neural activity, often in specific tasks, but may not provide a global percentage of activity as effectively as PET.

PET scans are particularly useful for showing overall metabolic activity, which can directly counter the 10% claim by demonstrating that a larger portion of the brain is active. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Answer: D**
