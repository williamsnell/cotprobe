Question:

A defendant suspected her long-term boyfriend was cheating on her. On a hunch, she went to her boyfriend's apartment one afternoon and, using her key, she entered the apartment. Once inside, she found her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in bed together. In a rage, the defendant retrieved the gun from the nightstand and killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend. After the shooting, the defendant left on a two-day trip to the mountains to get the week's events off her mind. She called her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment while she was gone and to look after her 4-year-old daughter. That night, after the defendant left, the police came to the apartment. They asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found in the defendant's bedroom the gun used to kill her boyfriend. At a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial, which of the following facts would the defendant's attorney be LEAST likely to attempt to prove?

Options:

A: The neighbor did not have the authority to give permission to search the apartment.
B: The police did not read the neighbor her rights before asking for consent to search.
C: The defendant's daughter was not present at the time of the search.
D: The defendant did not own the gun used to kill her boyfriend.
E: The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.
F: The gun was not visible without a thorough search of the defendant's bedroom.
G: The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.
H: The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.
I: The defendant had an alibi for the time of the murder.
J: The police did not have a search warrant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case. Let me read the question carefully and break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant who suspected her boyfriend was cheating. She went to his apartment, found him with his new girlfriend, got angry, and killed both with a gun. After that, she went on a trip and asked her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment and her daughter. The police came, asked the neighbor for permission to search, and found the gun in the defendant's bedroom. Now, the defendant is moving to suppress the gun as evidence, and the question is about which fact her attorney is least likely to try to prove.

The options are from A to J, each presenting a different fact. The goal is to determine which fact is least relevant to the suppression motion.

First, I need to recall the legal principles involved. The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. A search without a warrant is generally illegal unless an exception applies. One such exception is consent. If a person with authority to consent gives permission, the search is valid. But if the person doesn't have the authority, the consent is ineffective.

So, in this case, the police obtained consent from the neighbor. The defendant's attorney would likely argue that the search was unlawful if the neighbor didn't have the authority to consent. Let's look at the options.

Option A: The neighbor did not have the authority to give permission. This is directly relevant because if the neighbor lacked the authority, the consent was invalid, making the search unconstitutional. The attorney would definitely try to prove this.

Option B: The police did not read the neighbor her rights before asking for consent. Wait, Miranda rights are about custodial interrogation, not about the right to refuse a search. So, this might not be relevant. The police don't need to read Miranda rights to ask for consent. However, if the neighbor felt compelled to consent because of the police presence or being read rights, maybe, but I'm not sure. But generally, Miranda doesn't apply here, so this fact might not help the motion to suppress.

Option C: The defendant's daughter wasn't present during the search. I'm not sure how this relates. The presence of the daughter might affect the neighbor's authority to consent? Maybe if the daughter was there, the neighbor couldn't consent because the minor's presence could imply someone else was in the apartment, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might not matter because the issue is about the neighbor's authority, not the defendant's daughter's presence.

Option D: The defendant didn't own the gun. If the gun wasn't hers, then maybe the police shouldn't have been looking for it. But wait, the issue is whether the evidence should be suppressed, not whether it's hers. Even if she didn't own it, if the search was illegal, the gun should be suppressed. But the ownership fact itself might not directly challenge the legality of the search. Unless the search was based on some other justification, but I think this fact is less relevant to the motion to suppress because the argument is about the search's legality, not the gun's ownership.

Option E: The police told the neighbor she'd be taken to the station if she refused. This could be coercion, making the consent involuntary. If the police coerced the neighbor into consenting, then the consent wouldn't be valid. So the attorney would definitely try to prove this to argue the consent was not freely given.

Option F: The gun wasn't visible without a thorough search. This might go to the issue of whether the police needed a warrant. If the gun was in plain view, the police could seize it without a warrant. If it wasn't visible, then they needed a warrant or consent. So if the gun wasn't visible, the search would require a warrant unless consent was given. Therefore, proving this fact would support the argument that the police needed a warrant and didn't have one, making the search unlawful. So the attorney would likely try to prove F.

Option G: The defendant gave her neighbor the keys. This is relevant because if the neighbor had the keys, it implies the defendant gave permission for the neighbor to enter. But wait, the police were asking the neighbor for consent. If the defendant gave the neighbor the keys, that might show the neighbor had authority to consent. So if the attorney can show that the neighbor didn't have authority, perhaps because the defendant didn't give consent for the neighbor to allow police in, then G would be relevant. But if the defendant did give the keys, then the neighbor might have authority, so the attorney would try to show that the neighbor lacked authority, perhaps because the keys were just for access to the apartment, not for police search.

Option H: The defendant told the neighbor not to answer the door. If the defendant instructed the neighbor not to let anyone in, and the neighbor did let the police in, that could mean the neighbor lacked authority. Because the defendant might have revoked consent. So H is relevant; the attorney would try to show that the neighbor didn't have permission to let the police search because the defendant told her not to answer the door.

Option I: The defendant had an alibi for the murder time. This seems unrelated. The alibi would be for the murder charge, but the issue here is the legality of the search that found the gun. So proving an alibi wouldn't affect whether the gun should be suppressed. The gun's admissibility doesn't depend on the defendant's guilt or alibi; it's about the search's legality. So I think this fact is irrelevant to the motion to suppress.

Option J: The police did not have a search warrant. Well, of course, they didn't because they relied on consent. But if the consent was invalid, then the lack of a warrant would be the issue. The attorney would argue that without a warrant and without valid consent, the search was illegal. So J is a fact that's directly relevant, and the attorney would try to prove it, but it's more of a given since the question is about the least likely fact to be proven.

So, putting it all together, the question is which fact is the attorney least likely to try to prove. The options are about what facts would support the motion to suppress.

The least relevant fact would be one that doesn't challenge the legality of the search. Option I, the alibi, is about her guilt, not the search's legality. The other options (A, B, E, F, G, H, J) all relate to whether the consent was valid or whether a warrant was needed. Option D, about not owning the gun, might seem relevant, but it's more about ownership than the legality of the search. However, the motion is about excluding the gun as evidence, so if she didn't own it, it might not be relevant to the search's legality. But I'm not sure; maybe it's more about whether the police had a reason to search for it.

Wait, but the issue is whether the search was legal, regardless of ownership. If the search was illegal, the gun is suppressed. So the ownership fact (D) is not directly about the legality of the search. The attorney would focus on whether the search was legal, not whether the gun was hers. So D is the least relevant fact because it doesn't address the legality of the search. The other options relate to consent, coercion, visibility (which affects the need for a warrant), authority, etc.

So, the answer would be either D or I. Between them, I is about the alibi, which is unrelated. So I think the correct answer is I, but wait, the options are A-J, and the question is which fact the attorney is least likely to prove. So the answer is I: the defendant had an alibi for the time of the murder.

Wait, no, the issue is the suppression of the gun. The alibi doesn't affect whether the gun was legally seized. So the attorney wouldn't need to prove the alibi to suppress the gun. Therefore, the least relevant fact is I.

The question revolves around a motion to suppress evidence where the defendant's attorney seeks to challenge the legality of the police search. The key issue is whether the search was conducted lawfully, particularly focusing on the consent provided by the neighbor. The attorney would likely focus on facts that undermine the validity of the consent or the necessity of a search warrant.

- **Option A** is relevant because it challenges the neighbor's authority to consent.
- **Option B** is less relevant because Miranda rights are not required for consent searches.
- **Option C** is not directly relevant as the presence of the daughter does not affect the neighbor's authority.
- **Option D** is not directly relevant because the gun's ownership does not impact the legality of the search.
- **Option E** is relevant as it could show coercion, making the consent invalid.
- **Option F** is relevant because it affects whether the gun was in plain view, justifying seizure without a warrant.
- **Option G** is relevant as it relates to the neighbor's authority based on having keys.
- **Option H** is relevant because it shows the defendant revoked consent.
- **Option J** is relevant as it highlights the lack of a warrant, which would be unlawful without valid consent.

The least relevant fact is **Option I**, as the alibi pertains to the defendant's guilt, not the legality of the search. Therefore, the attorney is least likely to prove this fact in a motion to suppress.

Answer: I
