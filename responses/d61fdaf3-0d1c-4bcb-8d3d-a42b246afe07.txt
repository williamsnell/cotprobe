Question:

How are the variable portions of heavy chains combined to create diversity in the antibody sequences?

Options:

A: Only two DNA regions, V and D, combine in heavy chains
B: V, D, and JH regions are combined in light chains
C: V and JH regions are combined, while D regions are excluded from heavy chains
D: Five separate DNA regions are combined in heavy chains, adding extra complexity
E: D and JH regions are combined, while V regions are excluded from heavy chains
F: Four separate DNA regions are combined in heavy chains
G: V, DH, and J regions combine in heavy chains, introducing an incorrect region name
H: Three separate DNA regions, V, D, and JH, must be combined in heavy chains
I: A single DNA region undergoes rearrangement to create diversity in heavy chains
J: V, D, JH, and CH regions are all combined in heavy chains

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about antibody diversity, specifically how the variable portions of heavy chains are combined. I remember from my immunology class that antibodies have variable and constant regions. The variable regions are crucial for recognizing different antigens, and this diversity comes from the way certain DNA segments combine.

I think the question is asking about the heavy chains. I remember that heavy chains have something called V, D, and J regions. Wait, no, maybe it's V, D, and JH? Because I recall that the V (variable) and J (joining) regions are part of the light chains too, but for heavy chains, it's V, D (diversity), and JH (joining) regions. So when these regions combine, they create the variable part of the heavy chain.

Let me look at the options. Option A says only V and D combine. But wait, the heavy chain uses V, D, and JH, right? So if only two regions are used, that's not right. Option B mentions V, D, and JH but says it's for light chains. No, heavy chains are the ones with these regions, so B is incorrect. Option C says V and JH combine, excluding D. But that's not right because D is part of the heavy chain's variable region. So C is wrong.

Option D says five regions are combined. I don't think so, because I thought it's three regions for heavy chains. Option E says D and JH combine without V, which can't be right. Option F says four regions. Hmm, I don't remember four regions for heavy chains. Option G combines V, DH, and J, but DH isn't a standard term. I think DH is sometimes used as a typo for D, but the correct regions are V, D, JH. So G might be incorrect because of DH. Option H says three regions: V, D, JH. That matches what I remember. Option I says a single region rearranges, which doesn't make sense for diversity. And J says all four regions (V, D, JH, CH) are used, but CH is the constant region, so it's not part of the variable portion. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be H: Three separate DNA regions, V, D, and JH, must be combined in heavy chains.

The variable portions of heavy chains are created by the combination of three separate DNA regions: V (variable), D (diversity), and JH (joining). These regions work together to generate diversity in the antibody sequences. 

Answer: H
