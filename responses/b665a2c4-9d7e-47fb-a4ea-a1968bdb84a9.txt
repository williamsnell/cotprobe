Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ and He. Hmm, I remember that stability in molecules often depends on the bonding and electron configurations. Let me think about what I know about helium and its molecules.

Helium is a noble gas, so it's already in a stable configuration with a full valence shell. In its atomic form, He has two electrons in the first shell, which is already filled. So He is pretty stable on its own.

Now, He₂ is a diatomic molecule of helium. I think He₂ is less stable than individual He atoms. Wait, why? Well, maybe because the bond between two He atoms isn't very strong. Since He is already a noble gas, forming bonds isn't favorable. The bond dissociation energy is low, so He₂ tends to dissociate easily. So He₂ is less stable than He itself.

What about He₂⁺? That's a helium dimer with a positive charge. I remember something about ionized molecules being more stable sometimes. Like, when you remove an electron, you might get a more stable structure because of the lower electron-electron repulsion. Oh right! The He₂⁺ molecule is actually more stable than He₂. Because in He₂⁺, the two helium nuclei are closer together, and the single electron shared between them reduces the repulsion between the electrons, making the molecule more stable. So He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but how does it compare to He?

Wait, but He is a single atom, which is already very stable. So even though He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂, I'm not sure if it's more stable than He. I think He is the most stable because it's a single atom with a filled shell. So He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but less stable than He. That makes sense because forming any molecule from atoms usually requires some energy, and He is already in the most stable state.

So putting it all together: He is the most stable, followed by He₂⁺, and then He₂ is the least stable. So the question is whether He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ and He. The question asks, "Would you expect He₂⁺ to be more stable than He₂? Than He?" So He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂, but less stable than He.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but less stable than He. That fits what I'm thinking.

Option D says He₂⁺ is the least stable, which isn't right.

Option E says He and He₂ have the same stability, which I don't think is true because He is more stable.

Option F says He₂⁺ is more stable than He but less than He₂, which is the opposite of what I think.

Option G says He₂⁺ is less stable than both, which isn't correct because He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂.

Option I says He₂⁺ and He are equally stable, but again, He is more stable.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The stability of helium species can be analyzed based on their electron configurations and bonding. Helium (He) is a noble gas with a complete valence shell, making it highly stable on its own. Helium dimer (He₂) is less stable because the bond between two He atoms is weak due to the low bond dissociation energy and the already stable nature of He atoms. On the other hand, He₂⁺, a positively charged helium dimer, is more stable than He₂. This is because the single electron shared between the two helium nuclei reduces electron-electron repulsion, making the molecule more stable. However, He₂⁺ is still less stable than He, as individual He atoms are already in their most stable form.

Given this reasoning, He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but less stable than He. The correct answer is:

B: He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but less stable than He.

Answer: B
