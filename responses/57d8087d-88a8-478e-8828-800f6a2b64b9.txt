Okay, so I've got this question about atoms, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down. The question is asking about where the mass of an atom comes from and what contributes to its volume. The options are A through J, each pairing two different parts of the atom.

First, I remember that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around it. I think the mass of an atom is mostly from the nucleus because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons. Electrons are super light, right? So the mass must come from the nucleons, which are protons and neutrons combined.

Now, for the volume part. Volume is about the space something takes up. Since electrons are the ones orbiting outside the nucleus, they create a sort of electron cloud. Even though electrons are tiny, their distribution around the nucleus gives the atom its overall volume. So the volume comes from the electrons.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one pairs nucleons (since that's where the mass comes from) with electrons (for the volume). Let me check each option:

A: neutrons; electrons. Hmm, neutrons are part of nucleons, but protons are too. So maybe not A.

B: protons; electrons. Protons are nucleons, but neutrons are also important for mass. So B might not be the best choice.

C: protons; neutrons. Wait, that's about both, but the question is mass and volume. So no, that's not it.

D: electrons; protons. That's opposite of what I think.

E: nucleons; electrons. Oh, this looks right. Nucleons for mass, electrons for volume.

F: nucleons; nucleons. No, that would cover both aspects, but volume isn't from nucleons.

G: neutrons; protons. Again, not matching the question.

H: electrons; protons. No, same as D.

I: electrons; nucleons. That's reversed what I'm thinking.

J: protons; nucleons. Wait, protons are part of nucleons, but the mass is from all nucleons, not just protons.

So the correct answer should be E: nucleons; electrons.

The mass of an atom comes mostly from its nucleons (protons and neutrons), while its volume is determined by the space occupied by its electrons.

Answer: E
