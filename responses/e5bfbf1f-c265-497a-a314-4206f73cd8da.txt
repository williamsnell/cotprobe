Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which of the options is NOT a mineral. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one and think about whether they're minerals or not.

First, I remember that a mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and crystal structure. So, I need to check each option against these criteria.

Option A: Calcite. I know calcite is a common mineral, a form of calcium carbonate. Definitely a mineral, so A is out.

Option B: Quartz. Quartz is a well-known mineral, part of the silicate minerals. So B is a mineral.

Option C: Topaz. Topaz is another mineral, a gemstone, so it's a mineral. C is out.

Option D: Diamond. Diamond is a form of carbon, and it's a mineral. So D is a mineral.

Option E: Gypsum. Gypsum is a mineral used in plaster, so E is a mineral.

Option F: Graphite. Graphite is a form of carbon, and I think it's a mineral. Wait, but isn't graphite also a allotrope of carbon like diamond? Yes, but it's still considered a mineral because it meets all the criteria. So F is a mineral.

Option G: Feldspar. Feldspar is a group of minerals, so G is definitely a mineral.

Option H: Lithium. Hmm, lithium is an element, right? It's a metal, atomic number 3. But wait, is lithium considered a mineral? I'm a bit confused here. Because minerals are inorganic solids, and elements can be minerals if they meet the criteria. Wait, but lithium is a metalloid or metal, and it's naturally occurring. But wait, wait—lithium is actually an element, not a compound, so it's a pure substance. However, minerals are typically compounds, though some elements can be considered minerals if they fit the definition. Wait, but I think elements like lithium are not classified as minerals because minerals are usually compounds. Or maybe they are? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again: minerals have a definite chemical composition, so elements do have that. They are inorganic, yes. So maybe lithium is a mineral. But wait, I'm not sure. I think I might have to come back to this.

Option I: Mica. Mica is a group of minerals, so I is a mineral.

So, looking back, all options except maybe H could be minerals. But wait, the question is which is NOT a mineral. So if H is lithium, which is an element, is it a mineral? I'm not entirely sure. Because minerals are typically compounds, but some sources say that elements can be minerals if they meet the criteria. Wait, but I think that's incorrect. Because, for example, gold is an element and considered a mineral. So maybe lithium is also a mineral. Then, all options are minerals except perhaps one.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The options are all minerals except one. So, perhaps H is lithium, which is an element, and maybe it's not considered a mineral. Because minerals are usually compounds, and elements are their own category. Or perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, all except one are minerals. Let me list each:

A: Calcite – mineral
B: Quartz – mineral
C: Topaz – mineral
D: Diamond – mineral
E: Gypsum – mineral
F: Graphite – mineral
G: Feldspar – mineral
H: Lithium – element, possibly not a mineral
I: Mica – mineral

So, if H is an element, and not a compound, then it's not a mineral. Because minerals are compounds, right? Or wait, no—minerals can be elements if they meet the criteria. For example, native sulfur is a mineral. So maybe lithium is a mineral. So then, all options are minerals except perhaps one. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options is not a mineral because it's not a solid. Wait, no, all these are solids. Or perhaps one is organic. But no, all are inorganic.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check each option again:

A: Calcite – yes, mineral
B: Quartz – yes
C: Topaz – yes
D: Diamond – yes
E: Gypsum – yes
F: Graphite – yes
G: Feldspar – yes
H: Lithium – element, so perhaps not a mineral
I: Mica – yes

So, if H is an element, then it's not a mineral. Therefore, the answer would be H.

The correct answer is H: Lithium. Lithium is an element, not a mineral, as minerals are typically compounds, whereas elements are pure substances.
