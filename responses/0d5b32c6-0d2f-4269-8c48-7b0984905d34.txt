Okay, so I have this property law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

A homeowner conveyed his property to his cousin "for life, with remainder to (the homeowner's) heirs." So, that means the cousin gets a life estate, and after that, the property goes to the homeowner's heirs. That makes sense; a life estate followed by a remainder to the heirs.

Then, the cousin later conveyed the property to a farmer "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." Hmm, that sounds a bit like a determinable fee simple because it's based on a condition—farming the land. So, if the farmer stops farming, the estate ends. Alternatively, it could be a life estate if it's tied to the farmer's life, but the wording says "for as long as he would continue to farm," which suggests it's not tied to his life but to the activity.

After the cousin's death, the homeowner's heirs sue the farmer to quiet title. So, the issue is about who owns the property now that the cousin has died. The heirs believe they should inherit after the life estate ends, but the farmer is still there. 

The question is about which common law doctrine applies here. Let's go through the options.

Option A: Doctrine of Lapse. That usually applies when a person dies without heirs, and their property goes to the state. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option B: Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie. Wait, that's when a life estate is created for someone else's life, not the grantor's. But the initial conveyance was "for life," so it's a life estate to the cousin. So this might be relevant because when the cousin dies, the remainder kicks in.

Option C: Doctrine of Worthier Title. I think this is when the remainder is in the grantor's heirs rather than in a third party, and it's given a higher priority. So if the grantor creates a life estate and the remainder goes to their heirs, this doctrine might make the remainder a vested remainder subject to open, which is stronger than a contingent remainder.

Option D: Rule in Shelley's Case. That deals with when a grant is made to A for life, then to A's heirs. The common law merged the two estates, so A has a fee simple. But in this case, the grant was to the cousin for life, then to the homeowner's heirs, not the cousin's heirs. So Shelley's Case doesn't apply here because the remainder isn't in the grantee's heirs but someone else's.

Option E: Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. If the remainder is contingent, it could be destroyed if it's not certain. But the remainder here is to the heirs, which is a class that's likely to vest, so it's a vested remainder subject to open, not contingent. So maybe not applicable.

Option F: Rule against Perpetuities. This deals with whether future interests are valid. The remainder to the heirs would be valid under the RAP because it's certain to vest or fail within a life in being. So maybe not the main issue here.

Option G: Doctrine of Merger. This happens when the same person owns both the present estate and the future interest, causing the estates to merge. But here, the farmer holds a fee simple determinable, and the heirs have a vested remainder. If the farmer's estate ended, the heirs would take. But the cousin is dead, so merger might not apply unless the farmer had both, which isn't the case.

Option H: Rule in Wild's Case. This is about future interests in land and whether they're valid. It's similar to the RAP but deals with whether the interest is too remote. Again, the remainder here is to the heirs, which is likely valid.

Option I: Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs. I'm not too familiar with this, but I think it's a rule that disfavors remainders in the grantee's heirs unless certain conditions are met. But in this case, the remainder is in the grantor's heirs, not the grantee's. So maybe not applicable.

Option J: Doctrine of Adverse Possession. That's about acquiring property through continuous, open, and hostile use. Not relevant here because the farmer's interest was through a conveyance, not adverse possession.

So, focusing back on the conveyances: the homeowner gave a life estate to the cousin, with remainder to his heirs. Then the cousin, who had a life estate, tried to convey to the farmer. But a life estate holder can only convey their interest, which is for life. If the cousin conveyed a fee simple to the farmer, that would be a problem, but the way it's worded, it's "for as long as he would continue to farm," which suggests a determinable fee. Alternatively, if the cousin tried to create a life estate for the farmer, but the cousin's own life estate ended when he died, so the farmer's estate would terminate then.

Wait, but the cousin conveyed to the farmer after the initial conveyance. So the homeowner's conveyance was to cousin for life, remainder to heirs. Then cousin conveys to farmer for as long as he farms. So the cousin had a life estate, so he could only transfer his interest, which is a life estate. But he tried to create a fee simple determinable for the farmer. Is that possible?

Wait, no. A life tenant can only convey their own interest, which is for life. So when the cousin conveys to the farmer, he can only transfer his life estate. But the way he worded it—"for as long as he would continue to farm"—might create a determinable life estate for the farmer. So the farmer gets a life estate pur autre vie, but tied to his farming.

But when the cousin dies, his life estate ends, so the remainder to the homeowner's heirs should take over. However, the farmer is still there under his own estate. So the issue is whether the farmer's estate is valid and what it is.

Wait, perhaps the cousin tried to create a fee simple determinable, but since he only had a life estate, he couldn't create a fee simple. So the farmer's interest is limited by the cousin's life estate. So when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends, and the heirs take over.

But the problem says that after the cousin's death, the heirs sue the farmer. So the court needs to determine who owns the property now.

I think the key here is that the cousin's conveyance to the farmer was ineffective to create a fee simple because the cousin only had a life estate. So the farmer only has a life estate pur autre vie (the cousin's life), but the cousin is dead, so the farmer's estate ends, and the remainder to the heirs takes effect.

But the problem is that the conveyance was "for as long as he would continue to farm," which might create a determinable fee. But if the cousin only had a life estate, he couldn't convey more than that. So the farmer's estate is a determinable life estate, which ends with the cousin's death. Therefore, the heirs' vested remainder should take over.

Which doctrine applies here? The Doctrine of Worthier Title (Option C) might apply because the remainder is in the grantor's heirs, which is a stronger form of remainder than a contingent one. This doctrine elevates the remainder to a vested remainder subject to open, which is more favorable than a contingent remainder. So when the cousin tried to convey to the farmer, it couldn't affect the vested remainder of the heirs.

Alternatively, the Rule in Shelley's Case (Option D) is about when the grant is to A for life, then to A's heirs. But here, it's to cousin for life, then to homeowner's heirs, so Shelley's Case doesn't apply.

So the main issue is that the remainder to the heirs is valid and takes effect upon the cousin's death, making the farmer's interest end. The doctrine that supports the heirs' claim is the Doctrine of Worthier Title, which makes the remainder vested, giving the heirs a stronger claim.

Therefore, the answer should be C: Doctrine of Worthier Title.

The question revolves around property ownership after a series of conveyances. The homeowner initially conveyed the property to his cousin for life, with a remainder to his heirs. The cousin later conveyed the property to a farmer "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." After the cousin's death, the homeowner's heirs sued the farmer to quiet title. The key issue is determining which doctrine applies to resolve the ownership dispute.

The homeowner's conveyance created a life estate in the cousin, with a remainder to his heirs. This remainder is a vested remainder subject to open, as it is in a class that is certain to vest (the homeowner's heirs). The cousin, having only a life estate, could not convey a fee simple interest to the farmer. Instead, the farmer's interest is limited to the cousin's life estate, which ended upon the cousin's death. Consequently, the vested remainder in the homeowner's heirs takes effect, and the farmer's interest terminates.

The Doctrine of Worthier Title (Option C) is most applicable here. This doctrine prioritizes remainders in the grantor's heirs over other forms of remainders, ensuring the heirs' interest is stronger and more favorable. It supports the heirs' claim that the property reverts to them upon the cousin's death, rendering the farmer's interest invalid beyond that point.
