Okay, so I have this question about half-life, and I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is: What is the half-life of an unstable substance if 75% of any given amount decomposes in one hour? The options are from A to J, with various time periods.

Alright, half-life is the time it takes for half of a substance to decay. So, normally, after one half-life, half remains, after two, a quarter, and so on. But here, they're saying that 75% decomposes in one hour. That means only 25% remains after one hour. Wait, that's interesting because 25% is a quarter of the original amount. So, if after one hour only a quarter is left, that would imply that two half-lives have passed, right? Because each half-life reduces the amount by half. Let me think.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. If the half-life is T, then after time t, the remaining amount is (1/2)^(t/T). So, when t=1 hour, the remaining is 25%, which is 1/4. So, 1/4 = (1/2)^(1/T). Hmm, how do I solve for T here.

Taking logarithms might help. Let's take natural logs on both sides. ln(1/4) = (1/T) * ln(1/2). Rearranging, T = ln(1/2) / ln(1/4). Now, ln(1/2) is negative, ln(1/4) is also negative. But the ratio would be positive. Let's compute the values.

Wait, I remember that ln(1/4) is ln(0.25) which is about -1.386, and ln(1/2) is about -0.693. So, T = (-0.693) / (-1.386) ≈ 0.5. So T is 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. But wait, that would mean the half-life is 30 minutes. Looking at the options, E is 1/4 hour, which is 15 minutes, and A is 1/2 hour, which is 30 minutes. So the calculation suggests the half-life is 30 minutes, option A.

But wait, let me double-check. If the half-life is 30 minutes, then after 30 minutes, half remains. After another 30 minutes, that's one hour total, a quarter remains. Which matches the given condition that 75% decomposes, so 25% remains. So yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I could think of it in terms of the decay formula. The remaining amount N is N0 * (1/2)^(t/T). So, 0.25 = 0.5^(1/T). Taking log base 0.5: log_0.5(0.25) = 1/T. But log base 0.5 of 0.25 is 2 because 0.5 squared is 0.25. So 2 = 1/T → T=0.5 hours. Yep, same result.

So the half-life is 30 minutes, which is option A: 1/2 hour.

The half-life is 30 minutes, which corresponds to option A.
