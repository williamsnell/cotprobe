Okay, so I've got this question here about modular arithmetic, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is: If p is a prime number and a is an integer, what is (a^p - a) mod p? And then there are several options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember learning something called Fermat's Little Theorem. I think that's related to primes and exponents. Let me try to recall. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p is congruent to a modulo p. So that would mean a^p ≡ a mod p. 

Wait, that sounds exactly like what the question is asking. So if I subtract a from both sides, I get a^p - a ≡ 0 mod p. That would mean (a^p - a) mod p is 0. 

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. I think the theorem also says that if a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. So maybe that's a different part. But the question here is about a^p, not a^(p-1). 

Let me think again: the theorem says a^p ≡ a mod p. So when I subtract a, it becomes 0. So regardless of whether a is divisible by p or not, this should hold. Because if a is divisible by p, then a mod p is 0, and a^p mod p is also 0, so 0 -0 is 0. If a isn't divisible by p, then a^p mod p is a, so a -a is 0. 

So in either case, (a^p - a) mod p is 0. 

Looking at the options, E is 0. So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: 0. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer a and prime p, a^p ≡ a mod p. Subtracting a from both sides gives a^p - a ≡ 0 mod p, making the result 0.

Answer: E
