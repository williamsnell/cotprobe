Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the World Bank's 1997 findings on the fraction of the world's population living in low and lower-middle-income countries. The income threshold is $1230 or less per capita. The options are from A to J, with values ranging from 25% up to 80%. 

First, I need to recall what I know about global income distribution. I remember that in the late 90s, a significant portion of the world was still living in poverty. The World Bank typically categorizes countries based on their GNI per capita. I think low-income countries are those with less than $1000, but wait, the question says $1230 or less, so maybe the threshold was a bit higher that year.

I also remember that around 2000, about 2.8 billion people, which is roughly half the world's population, lived on less than $2 a day. But that's a different metric, based on purchasing power parity, maybe. Alternatively, I think the World Bank's data might have shown that a significant chunk, like over 50%, were in low and lower-middle-income countries. 

Wait, let me think more carefully. I recall that by the late 90s, the global population was around 6 billion. If 55% of that would be about 3.3 billion people. That seems plausible. I also remember reading that in 1997, a little over half the world lived in countries with per capita incomes below $1230. So looking at the options, F is 55%, which seems close. 

But I should consider other options. Option E is 50%, which is a round number, but I think the figure was a bit higher. Option D is 40%, which seems low. Option J is 45%, which is close but maybe not exact. So I think F, 55%, is the correct answer.

The correct answer is F: 55%.
