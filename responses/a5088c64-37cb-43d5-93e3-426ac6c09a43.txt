Question:

The parathyroid glands in man are small, pealike organs. They are ususally four in number and are located on the surface of the thyroid. What is the function of these glands?

Options:

A: The parathyroid glands produce insulin to regulate blood sugar levels
B: The parathyroid glands regulate blood pressure
C: The parathyroid glands control breathing rate
D: The parathyroid glands secrete enzymes that break down proteins
E: The parathyroid glands control the balance of electrolytes in the body
F: The parathyroid glands secrete hormones that stimulate red blood cell production
G: The parathyroid glands are responsible for filtering waste from the blood
H: The parathyroid glands regulate the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues
I: The parathyroid glands regulate body temperature
J: The parathyroid glands aid in digestion

Answer:

Alright, so I've got this question about the parathyroid glands. I'm a bit rusty on my endocrine system, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is asking about their function.

Okay, first, I remember that the parathyroid glands are located near the thyroid gland. They're usually four small glands, right? Now, what do they do? I think they have something to do with calcium levels in the body. Because I've heard of parathyroid hormone (PTH) before. PTH is involved in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism.

Wait, so the options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says they produce insulin. No, that's the pancreas. Option B, regulate blood pressure. I'm not sure, but I don't think that's their main role. Option C, control breathing rate. No, that's the respiratory system, maybe the brain? D, secrete enzymes to break down proteins. Not sure, but parathyroids are endocrine, so they release hormones, not enzymes. E, control electrolyte balance. Hmm, electrolytes include calcium and others, but I think their main role is more specific than that.

Option F, secrete hormones that stimulate red blood cell production. That sounds like the kidneys or maybe the liver, not the parathyroids. G, filter waste from blood. That's the kidneys again. H, regulate calcium-phosphate balance. That rings a bell. I've read that PTH helps maintain calcium levels by acting on the bones, kidneys, and intestines. So that's probably correct.

Option I, regulate body temperature. That's the hypothalamus and thyroid gland, I think. J, aid in digestion. No, that's the pancreas and other digestive glands. So putting it all together, the function must be related to calcium and phosphate balance. So the answer should be H.

The parathyroid glands are responsible for regulating the calcium-phosphate balance in the body by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone helps maintain proper calcium levels by influencing the bones, kidneys, and intestines. 

Answer: H
