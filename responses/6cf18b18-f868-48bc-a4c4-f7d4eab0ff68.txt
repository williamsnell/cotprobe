Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why this synthesis for n-butane isn't efficient. The reaction given is CH3CH2CH2Br + CH3Br + 2 Na → CH3(CH2)2CH3 + 2 NaBr. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I recognize that sodium is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In such reactions, especially with alkyl halides, elimination or substitution can happen. But wait, when sodium is involved with two different alkyl halides, I think about the possibility of an elimination reaction forming alkenes, or maybe a coupling reaction.

Wait, I remember something about the Birch reduction or maybe the formation of alkanes from halides using sodium. Oh right, the reaction of alkyl halides with sodium metal can lead to dehydrohalogenation if there's elimination, but sometimes it can also lead to coupling. For example, when two different alkyl halides react, they might couple in a way that forms a larger molecule.

In this case, the two reactants are CH3CH2CH2Br (which is 1-bromo propane) and CH3Br (methyl bromide). When these react with sodium, perhaps the bromide ions act as leaving groups, and the sodium facilitates a coupling between the two carbons from each alkyl halide. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe this is a Grignard-like reaction, but sodium isn't as strong as magnesium. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a single electron transfer mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when two alkyl halides react with sodium metal, especially in a 1:1 ratio, they might undergo a coupling reaction to form a larger alkane. For example, if each alkyl group donates a carbon, maybe the products would combine. But wait, the product here is n-butane, which is CH3CH2CH2CH3. That's four carbons, but the starting materials are 3 carbons and 1 carbon. So 3 + 1 = 4, that makes sense. So each Br is replaced by a methyl or ethyl group.

Wait, no. Let's see: CH3CH2CH2Br has three carbons, and CH3Br has one. So if they couple, one from each would combine. But wait, if the ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3) combines with the methyl group (CH3), would they join end to end? So CH2CH2CH3-CH3? That would be CH2CH2CH2CH3, which is butane. Wait, but the product is CH3(CH2)2CH3, which is n-butane.

So that seems correct. But why is the synthesis not efficient? The question is asking why the efficiency is low.

Wait, another possibility: maybe instead of just forming n-butane, other products are formed as well. For example, when alkyl halides react with sodium, especially in the presence of excess sodium, elimination can occur, forming alkenes. Or perhaps, when two identical alkyl halides react, they might form an alkane, but when different ones react, maybe other products form.

Alternatively, perhaps side reactions occur. For instance, if the alkyl halides undergo elimination instead of coupling, they might form alkenes like propene or ethylene. Or maybe other substitution reactions happen, like forming bromoethane or something else.

Wait, the options include F: Formation of bromoethane and tribromomethane as side reactions. So maybe during the reaction, some of the alkyl halides don't just couple but instead undergo other reactions. For example, maybe the CH3Br could react with another CH3Br to form CH2CH2Br2? Or perhaps each Br could get replaced by another group.

Wait, another angle: when sodium reacts with alkyl halides, it can cause elimination. For example, CH3CH2CH2Br reacting with Na might form CH2=CHCH2 (but that's not a stable molecule). Alternatively, maybe elimination occurs to form alkenes. So if some of the starting materials undergo elimination instead of coupling, the desired product (n-butane) is formed less, making the process inefficient.

Looking at the options, option B says "Decrease in the production of n-butane due to formation of ethane and hexane." Hmm, wait, where would hexane come from? Hexane would require coupling of two three-carbon alkyl halides, but here we have a three-carbon and a one-carbon. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, if each alkyl group adds more than once, but that seems unlikely.

Option F says side reactions leading to bromoethane and tribromomethane. But how? Let's think: CH3CH2CH2Br + Na → CH3CH2CH2– (but then maybe it abstracts a Br from another molecule? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sodium could cause the alkyl halide to form a carbanion, which could attack another molecule.

But if the reaction conditions are not optimal, maybe the sodium isn't enough to drive the reaction to completion. Or perhaps the reaction could proceed through different mechanisms, leading to other products.

Wait, another thought: if the sodium is not in excess, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed efficiently. But the option C says "Incomplete reaction due to insufficient sodium." That could be a possibility, but the question is about inefficiency in the synthesis, not just about completion.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't as efficient because other products are being formed alongside n-butane, thus reducing the yield. For example, if some of the sodium reacts with the alkyl halides in a way that forms ethane or other alkanes, or perhaps elimination products like ethylene or butadiene.

Looking at the options again, option D mentions butadiene, which is an alkene. Option F talks about bromoethane and tribromomethane. Hmm.

Wait, when sodium reacts with methyl bromide (CH3Br), perhaps it could form CH3– which could then combine with another CH3– to form ethane (CH3CH3). Similarly, if the ethyl bromide (CH2CH2CH2Br) reacts, maybe the sodium could cause elimination, forming propene or ethylene. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group could combine with another ethyl group to form hexane (if two three-carbon groups combine), but that's not possible here because we have only one ethyl bromide and one methyl bromide.

Wait, another possibility: when sodium is used with two different alkyl halides, the coupling could lead to a mixture of products. For instance, the ethyl group could combine with the methyl group to form butane (as desired), but also, perhaps the ethyl group could combine with itself to form hexane, and the methyl could combine with itself to form ethane. But in the reaction as written, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for the two alkyl halides, so their coupling would produce butane. But if other reactions happen, like each halide coupling with itself, that would produce ethane and hexane as byproducts, which would take away from the desired n-butane production.

So if that's the case, then the production of n-butane would decrease because some of the starting materials are forming ethane and hexane instead of butane. That would align with option B: "Decrease in the production of n-butane due to formation of ethane and hexane."

Alternatively, option F talks about side products like bromoethane and tribromomethane. How would that happen? Maybe if the alkyl halides react with each other without coupling, perhaps adding Br atoms. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, another angle: in the reaction, sodium is a strong base. It could abstract a beta hydrogen from the ethyl bromide, leading to elimination and forming an alkene. So CH3CH2CH2Br could lose H and Br to form CH2=CHCH2, but that's not a stable molecule. Alternatively, maybe CH2=CH2 (ethylene) is formed if the ethyl group loses two carbons, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl bromide eliminates to form propene, but that's a three-carbon alkene.

If elimination occurs, then instead of coupling to form butane, we get alkenes. So the major product would be alkenes, not the desired n-butane, making the synthesis inefficient. But looking at the options, option D is about butadiene, which is a four-carbon alkene. But the starting materials are three and one carbons; I don't see how butadiene would form.

Wait, perhaps the reaction could also form other products like ethane and hexane through different coupling mechanisms, which would lead to lower yields of n-butane. So the inefficiency comes from producing other alkanes besides the desired product.

So considering all this, the main issue is that the reaction produces other alkanes (like ethane and hexane) in addition to n-butane, which means less n-butane is produced than expected. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: Decrease in the production of n-butane due to formation of ethane and hexane.

The reaction provided involves the coupling of CH3CH2CH2Br (1-bromo propane) and CH3Br (methyl bromide) with sodium metal to form n-butane (CH3(CH2)2CH3) and sodium bromide (NaBr). However, the synthesis is not efficient because side reactions occur, leading to the formation of other products such as ethane (CH3CH3) and hexane (CH3(CH2)4CH3). These side products arise when the alkyl halides couple with themselves instead of combining to form n-butane. For example, two molecules of CH3Br can couple to form ethane, and two molecules of CH3CH2CH2Br can couple to form hexane. As a result, the yield of n-butane is reduced due to the competing formation of these byproducts.
