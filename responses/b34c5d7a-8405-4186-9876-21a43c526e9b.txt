Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about vitamin A deficiency in children. I'm a bit rusty on my vitamins, but let's think it through. The question is asking what deficiency of vitamin A causes, and the options are from A to J, but looking at the options listed, it's A to F.

First, I remember that vitamin A is important for vision, skin health, and the immune system. In children, deficiency can lead to various issues. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Poor muscle development. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I think muscle development is more related to proteins and maybe other nutrients like B vitamins. Vitamin A's main roles don't immediately make me think of muscles. Maybe not A.

Option B: Increased risk of mortality. That sounds serious. I recall that vitamin A deficiency can lead to a weaker immune system, making children more susceptible to infections, which can be fatal. So B is a possibility.

Option C: Goitre. Wait, goitre is related to iodine deficiency, not vitamin A. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Increased risk of obesity. I don't think vitamin A deficiency is linked to weight gain. In fact, maybe the opposite happens if they have other deficiencies. So D might not be right.

Option E: Increased risk of heart disease. I'm not sure about this connection. I know that vitamin A is important for heart function, but does deficiency directly cause increased risk? I'm not certain, but I don't think this is the primary effect in children.

Option F: Poor cognitive development. I've heard that vitamin A affects brain development. It's involved in cell differentiation and growth, so deficiency could hinder cognitive functions. That makes sense, so F is another possibility.

Now, I need to decide between B and F. From what I remember, vitamin A deficiency is a major cause of preventable blindness in children. Also, it makes them more vulnerable to infections, which can lead to higher mortality rates. So B might be correct. But I also know that cognitive development is impaired if there's a lack of vitamin A. So which one is more directly caused?

I think the question is about the most direct and severe effect. Increased risk of mortality is a more immediate and severe consequence, especially in children. So I'm leaning towards B as the answer. But wait, another thought: poor cognitive development is a long-term effect, which is also significant. So both B and F could be correct. But the question asks what deficiency causes, so perhaps it's looking for the more commonly known severe effect.

Wait, the options are separate, so maybe the question lists more than one correct answer, but in this case, it's a single choice. Let me recall: in children, vitamin A deficiency is primarily associated with night blindness and increased susceptibility to infections, leading to higher mortality. Cognitive issues are also a concern, but maybe the question is pointing towards the increased risk of mortality as the main answer here.

The deficiency of vitamin A in children primarily leads to an increased risk of mortality due to weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections. While poor cognitive development is also a concern, the immediate and severe consequence is the increased risk of mortality. 

Answer: B
