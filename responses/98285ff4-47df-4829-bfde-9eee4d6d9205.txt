The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Statement 1| A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user’s computer from stealing the user’s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user’s computer is turned off. Statement 2| A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.

Options:

A: False, True
B: True, True
C: False, False
D: Both statements are partially true
E: False, Not enough information
F: Not enough information, Not enough information
G: True, False
H: True, Not enough information
I: Not enough information, True
J: Not enough information, False

Okay, so I've got this question about U2F USB dongles and authentication, and I need to figure out whether the two statements are true or not. Let me start by breaking down each statement and then think about what I know about U2F.

Statement 1 says that a U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user’s computer from stealing the user’s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user’s computer is turned off. Hmm, I remember that U2F is a two-factor authentication method that uses a physical device. So, the second factor is something you have, the dongle. But wait, if the computer is off, can malware still steal the second factor? Well, when the computer is off, the dongle isn't connected, right? So, maybe the malware can't steal it because the device isn't active. But I'm not entirely sure. I think U2F requires the device to be present and possibly the user's touch or presence, so when the computer is off, the dongle isn't providing any signals. So, Statement 1 is probably true because the dongle can't be accessed by malware when the computer is off.

Statement 2 claims that a server using U2F can reliably determine that the user attempting to log in is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request. From what I know, U2F doesn't provide location information. It just confirms that the user has possession of the dongle. So, the server can't tell where the user is; all it knows is that the dongle is being used. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because the server can't reliably determine the user's location relative to the computer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Does U2F do any kind of proof of presence beyond just having the device? I think it's based on the challenge-response mechanism. The server sends a challenge, the dongle signs it using the private key, and the server verifies the signature. That's all. It doesn't involve any location data. So, yes, the server can't know if the user is physically present at the computer; it just knows the dongle is there.

Putting it together, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. So looking at the options, that would be option G: True, False.

The first statement is true because the U2F dongle cannot be accessed by malware when the computer is off. The second statement is false because U2F does not provide location information. 

Answer: G
