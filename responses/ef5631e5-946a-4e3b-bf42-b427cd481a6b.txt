Question:

Suppose a bank has $250,000 in deposit liabilities, $ 175,000 in loans and $ 75,000 in reserves. What is the direct effect on the money supply if the bank lends an additional $ 25,000? What is the direct effect on the money supply when the loan is repaid (ignoring interest)?

Options:

A: The money supply has increased by $50,000
B: The money supply has increased by $ 25,000.
C: The money supply has decreased by $25,000
D: There is no change in the money supply

Okay, so I have this question about banking and the money supply. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The question says: A bank has $250,000 in deposit liabilities, $175,000 in loans, and $75,000 in reserves. Then the bank lends an additional $25,000. What's the direct effect on the money supply? And when the loan is repaid, ignoring interest, what happens then?

Hmm, I remember that banks create money through the fractional reserve system. So when a bank makes a loan, it's not just moving money around; it actually can increase the money supply because it's using the reserves to lend out, and the depositors can then spend that money, which in turn can be redeposited, leading to more loans and so on. But wait, the question is about the direct effect, not the multiplicative effect.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The money supply in this context is the M1 or M2 measure, right? So when a bank lends money, the borrower takes that money and spends it, which increases the deposits in the banking system. But I'm not sure if the question is considering the entire process or just the initial action.

Wait, the bank has reserves of $75k, loans of $175k, and deposits of $250k. So the reserve requirement is probably 10%, since 250k deposits, 25k in loans would have required 25k reserves, but wait, the bank has $75k in reserves. Hmm, maybe I should check the reserve ratio.

Wait, the reserve ratio is (Reserves)/(Deposits). So here, Reserves are $75k, deposits are $250k, so 75/250 = 0.3, or 30%. That's a higher than usual ratio, maybe they're holding excess reserves.

When the bank lends an additional $25k, how does that affect the money supply? Well, when the bank makes a loan, they create new money by effectively increasing the deposits. Because when they lend, the borrower's account increases, which is a liability for the bank. So the bank's loans increase, but how does that affect the money supply?

Wait, the initial deposit is $250k, and the bank's reserves are $75k, which is above the required 10% (which would be $25k), so they have $50k in excess reserves. When they lend $25k, they're using some of their excess reserves. So when they lend $25k, the borrower now has $25k more in their account, which is a deposit. So the deposits increase by $25k, from $250k to $275k. But since the bank is using its excess reserves, the money supply increases by that amount because the borrower can now spend that $25k, which will be deposited elsewhere, allowing more lending. But wait, the question is about the direct effect, so maybe it's just the increase in deposits, which is $25k. So the money supply increases by $25k. So looking at the options, that would be option B.

But wait, another way to think about it: when a bank makes a loan, they're not actually creating new money out of nothing if they're using their reserves. Because the reserves are part of the money supply already. So when they lend, they're moving money from reserves (which are part of the central bank's balance sheet) to the borrower's account, which is a deposit. So the total money supply doesn't change because the reserves are just being shifted around. Wait, no, because the reserves are held by the bank, which is part of the banking system's reserves, but when they lend, the borrower's money is in the deposit, which is part of M1. So the total money in circulation or in deposits would increase by $25k because the borrower now has that money to spend.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The bank's reserves are part of the money supply, right? So when they lend $25k, they take from their reserves (which are part of the money supply) and create a new deposit (which is also part of the money supply). So the total money supply remains the same? Because it's just moving from one part to another. But that can't be right, because when the bank lends, it's supposed to increase the money supply. Or is it?

Wait, maybe the money supply isn't just deposits and reserves. The money supply includes cash in circulation and demand deposits. So when the bank lends, the borrower now has more demand deposits, so the money supply increases by $25k. Because the bank didn't print new money; they just shifted reserves (which are part of the money supply) into the deposit account. So the total money supply goes up by $25k. So the answer would be B.

Now, when the loan is repaid, the borrower pays back the $25k. The bank then reduces the loan by $25k and adds to their reserves. So the deposits would decrease by $25k, going back to $250k. So the money supply decreases by $25k. But the question is only about the first part, the effect when the bank lends an additional $25k.

Wait, but another thought: the initial reserves were $75k, and after lending $25k, the reserves would be $50k (75-25=50). The deposits go up to $275k. So the money supply increases by $25k because deposits are part of the money supply. So the answer is B.

But wait, I'm mixing up different aspects. The money supply includes both cash and deposits. When the bank lends, the borrower's account increases by $25k, so the money supply increases by that amount. So the direct effect is an increase of $25k. So the answer is B.

The bank lends an additional $25,000, increasing its loans from $175,000 to $200,000. This action increases the borrower's deposits by $25,000, directly boosting the money supply by the same amount. When the loan is repaid, the money supply decreases by $25,000. However, the question focuses on the initial lending, so the direct effect is an increase of $25,000.

Answer: B
