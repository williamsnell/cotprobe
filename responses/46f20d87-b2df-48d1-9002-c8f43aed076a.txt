Okay, let's see. Mr. Fuller wants to put fencing around his yard. The yard is rectangular, so I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. 

So, the width is given as 55 feet and the length is 75 feet. Let me plug these numbers into the formula. That would be 2*(75) + 2*(55). 

Calculating each part: 2*75 is 150, and 2*55 is 110. Now, adding those together: 150 + 110 equals 260. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 75 times 2 is definitely 150. 55 times 2 is 110. Adding them, 150 + 110 is 260. So the total fencing needed is 260 feet. 

Looking at the options, D is 260. So the answer should be D.

To determine how many feet of fencing Mr. Fuller needs, calculate the perimeter of the rectangular yard using the formula: 

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)  
Perimeter = 2 × (75 feet + 55 feet)  
Perimeter = 2 × 130 feet  
Perimeter = 260 feet  

The correct answer is D: 260.
