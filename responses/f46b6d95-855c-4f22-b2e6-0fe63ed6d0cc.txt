Okay, so I've got this problem about heating water using a pipe, and I need to figure out the length of the pipe required and the maximum exit temperature. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the given data: Water is required at 340°K, and the flow rate is 4 kg/hr. The available water is at 300°K. The pipe has an inner diameter of 7 mm, and it provides 125 W per meter of heat. I think I need to calculate how much heat is needed to raise the water temperature from 300K to 340K, and then figure out how long the pipe needs to be to supply that heat.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the last character" but the answer options are A to J. I'll just focus on the calculation.

So, the formula I think I need is Q = m * c * ΔT, where Q is the heat required, m is mass flow rate, c is specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the temperature change.

But wait, the mass flow rate is given as 4 kg/hr. I'll need to convert that to kg/s because power is in watts, which is per second. So, 4 kg/hr divided by 3600 seconds in an hour. Let me calculate that: 4/3600 ≈ 0.001111 kg/s.

Next, the specific heat capacity of water, c. I remember it's about 4.18 kJ/(kg·K). So, in terms of J, that's 4180 J/(kg·K).

So, the temperature change ΔT is 340K - 300K = 40K.

Now, putting it all into the formula: Q = m * c * ΔT. So, Q = 0.001111 kg/s * 4180 J/(kg·K) * 40 K.

Let me compute that step by step. 0.001111 * 4180 = approx 4.639 J/s, which is 4.639 W. Then multiply by 40: 4.639 *40 = 185.56 W. So, the heat required per second is about 185.56 W.

Wait, but the pipe provides 125 W per meter. So, the heat supplied per meter is 125 W/m. To find the length, I think I need to divide the required power by the power per meter.

Wait, but is it that straightforward? Let me think. The heat transfer per unit length is 125 W/m. So, for L meters, the heat provided would be 125 * L W. So, to get the required heat of 185.56 W, L = 185.56 / 125 ≈ 1.484 meters. So, approximately 1.48 meters. That seems to match option B, which says 1.48m and 354.8K. Wait, but wait, the temperature in option B is higher than the required 340K. Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem says the water is to be heated to 340K. But option B says the exit temp is 354.8K. That's higher than required. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the heat transfer. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the maximum temperature, but the process requires 340K. So perhaps the exit temp is 340K, so why does option B have 354.8K? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the heat transfer is not just for the required temperature but considering heat loss or something else. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Let's recalculate Q.

m = 4 kg/hr = 4/3600 ≈ 0.0011111 kg/s.

c = 4180 J/kgK.

ΔT = 40 K.

Q = 0.0011111 * 4180 * 40.

Calculating 0.0011111 * 4180: 0.0011111 * 4000 = 4.4444, and 0.0011111 * 180 = 0.2000, so total ≈ 4.6444 J/s.

Then, 4.6444 *40 = 185.776 W. So, about 185.78 W required.

Now, the pipe delivers 125 W/m. So, L = 185.78 / 125 = approx 1.486 meters. So, around 1.486 m, which rounds to 1.49 m. Looking at the options, option B says 1.48m and 354.8K. Hmm, that's very close to my calculated length of 1.486 m. So, perhaps the slight discrepancy is due to rounding.

But then why is the exit temperature higher than 340K? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the heat transfer is based on the pipe providing more heat than required, so the exit temperature could be higher. But the process requires 340K, so perhaps the system is designed to reach that temperature. So, perhaps the exit temperature would be exactly 340K, but in reality, maybe the heat transfer isn't 100% efficient, but the problem might assume it's sufficient to reach the desired temperature. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some step here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the maximum temperature, which would be when all the heat provided by the pipe is used to raise the water temperature. So, if the pipe provides Q_pipe = 125 * L W, then the temperature rise would be ΔT = Q_pipe / (m * c). So, if I solve for L, then the ΔT would be exactly 40K, leading to the correct exit temp of 340K.

Wait, but according to that, the exit temp would be 340K, but option B says 354.8K. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of Q. Let me check again.

Wait, Q = m * c * ΔT. So, m=4 kg/hr = 4/3600 kg/s ≈ 0.0011111 kg/s.

c = 4180 J/kgK.

ΔT=40 K.

So, Q = 0.0011111 * 4180 *40.

0.0011111 *4180 = 4.639 J/s.

4.639 *40 = 185.56 J/s → 185.56 W.

So, correct.

Then, the pipe provides 125 W/m. So, L = 185.56 /125 ≈1.4845 m, which is approximately 1.48m, matching option B's length.

But why is the exit temp in option B 354.8K? That's 14.8K higher than the required 340K. That doesn't make sense because the process requires 340K, so the heating should stop at that point. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the water is being heated beyond the required temperature, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, perhaps the pipe's heat transfer isn't 100% efficient, but the problem states that the pipe provides 125 W/m, so perhaps I should take that as the actual heat transfer.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is a steady-state scenario, and the heat transfer is based on the entire length. So, perhaps I'm calculating the required length correctly, but the exit temperature is higher than needed. But that seems unlikely because the process requires 340K, so the system would stop heating once that temperature is reached. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible temperature given the available heat, but that's not the case because the process requires a specific temperature.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Q. Let me check the units again.

Wait, 4 kg/hr is correct. 4 divided by 3600 is 0.001111 kg/s.

c is 4180 J/kgK.

ΔT is 40K.

So, Q = 0.001111 *4180 *40 = (0.001111 *4180) = approx 4.639, then *40 = 185.56 W.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the length is L = 185.56 /125 ≈1.484 m, so approximately 1.48m.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.48m and 354.8K. But that exit temperature is higher than needed. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the available heat is more than needed, leading to a higher temperature. But the problem states that the process requires 340K, so the exit temp should be 340K. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exit temperature based on the heat provided by the pipe. So, if the length is L, then the heat provided is Q_pipe = 125 * L W. The heat used to raise the temperature is Q_used = m * c * (T_exit - T_in). So, setting Q_pipe = Q_used.

So, 125 * L = m * c * (T_exit - 300).

We can solve for T_exit = 300 + (125 * L)/(m * c).

But we also know that the process requires T_exit = 340K.

So, 340 =300 + (125 * L)/(m * c).

So, (125 * L)/(m * c) =40.

So, L= (40 * m * c)/125.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, L= (40 * (4/3600) * 4180)/125.

Wait, let me compute that:

40 * (4/3600) = 40 * 0.001111 ≈0.04444.

0.04444 *4180 = 185.56.

Then, 185.56 /125 =1.4845 m.

So, same result. So, T_exit =340K.

But option B says 354.8K. So, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about heating to 340K but about reaching a higher temperature due to additional factors, but the question says it's required for the process, so I think the exit temp should be 340K.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the pipe's heat transfer rate is given per meter, but I should consider the mass flow rate and the heat transfer coefficient.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer in a pipe, which is Q = (h * A) * ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

But wait, the problem states that the pipe provides 125 W per meter. So, perhaps that's the total heat transfer per meter, so Q per meter is 125 W. So, for L meters, Q =125 * L.

So, the earlier approach seems correct.

So, the exit temp should be 340K, but none of the options have 1.48m and 340K. Option B has 1.48m and 354.8K, which is higher. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the heat transfer is more than required, leading to a higher temperature. But why would that be the case? The process requires 340K, so the heating should stop at that point. Unless the available heat is more, but the problem states that the process requires 340K, so the exit temperature should be exactly that.

Wait, perhaps the options have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me check again. Maybe the mass flow rate is 4 kg/hr, which is correct. Let me compute the exact value without approximations.

m =4 kg/hr =4/(3600) =1/900 ≈0.001111111 kg/s.

c=4180 J/kgK.

ΔT=40 K.

So, Q= m*c*ΔT = (1/900)*4180*40.

Compute step by step:

(1/900)*4180 =4180/900 ≈4.644444 J/(s·K) *40 K= 4.644444*40=185.777778 W.

So, Q=185.777778 W.

The pipe provides 125 W/m.

So, L=185.777778 /125 =1.4862222 meters. Approximately 1.486 m, which is about 1.49 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.48m, which is very close. But the exit temp in B is 354.8K, which is higher than 340K. So, that doesn't make sense. Unless there's an error in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the heat transfer. Maybe the heat transfer is based on the entire length, so if the pipe is longer, more heat is added, leading to higher temp. But the process requires 340K, so the pipe length should be just enough to reach that temp.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 1.48m and 340K, but that option isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps the exit temp is higher because the heat transfer is more than needed, but that's not indicated in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer is not just for the required ΔT but for the maximum possible. But that doesn't align with the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different specific heat or flow rate. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, the flow rate is 4 kg/hr. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the pipe's heat output is per meter per second? No, the problem states 125 W per meter length.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the exit temperature to be higher because of the way heat is applied. But that's not logical because the process requires 340K, so the system should stop heating once that's achieved.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the heat transfer rate is Q = 125 * L, and the mass flow rate is 4 kg/hr, which is 4/3600 kg/s.

The temperature rise ΔT is Q/(m*c).

So, ΔT = (125 * L)/( (4/3600) * 4180 ).

We need ΔT =40 K.

So,

40 = (125 * L) / ( (4/3600)*4180 )

Solving for L:

L = (40 * (4/3600)*4180 ) /125.

Compute numerator: 40 *4 =160; 160/3600≈0.04444. 0.04444 *4180≈185.555.

So, L=185.555 /125≈1.484 m.

Again, same result. So, L≈1.48m, and T_exit=300+40=340K.

But none of the options have 340K with 1.48m. The closest is option B, which has 1.48m but 354.8K. So, perhaps the problem intended a higher temperature, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the heat transfer is calculated using the entire length, but the process requires a temp of 340K, so the length should be such that the heat provided equals the required heat. So, the exit temp is 340K, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 1.48m and 354.8K. Let me see what ΔT that would imply.

If L=1.48m, then Q=125 *1.48≈185 W.

Then, m=4 kg/hr=0.001111 kg/s.

c=4180 J/kgK.

ΔT=Q/(m*c)=185 / (0.001111*4180).

Compute denominator: 0.001111 *4180≈4.639.

So, ΔT=185 /4.639≈39.9 K.

So, exit temp=300+39.9≈339.9K≈340K. So, that would make sense. So, why does option B say 354.8K? That would imply a higher ΔT.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Q. Let me recheck.

Wait, if L is 1.48m, then Q=125 *1.48=185 W.

Then, ΔT=185/(0.001111 *4180)=185/(4.639)=39.9 K. So, T_exit=300+39.9=339.9K≈340K.

So, option B's exit temp is way off. So, perhaps option B is incorrect, but the length is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the pipe's inner diameter to calculate the area, but I don't see how that would affect the heat transfer since the problem states the heat provided per meter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heat transfer coefficient and flow velocity, but that's not provided in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with flow, but without more data, I can't apply that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the exit temperature to be higher because the heat transfer is more than needed, but that's not logical for the given process requirement.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct option would have 1.48m and 340K, but that's not present. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B, despite the discrepancy in the exit temp.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I've checked it multiple times and it seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the exit temp is 354.8K because the pipe is longer, but that would require more length. Let me see: If the exit temp is 354.8K, then ΔT=54.8K.

So, Q= m*c*ΔT=0.001111 *4180 *54.8.

Compute: 0.001111 *4180=4.639.

4.639 *54.8≈255.5 W.

So, L=255.5 /125≈2.044 m.

But option E is 2.8m and 358K, D is 2.1m and 353K, etc. So, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the maximum possible temperature given the pipe length, but the process requires 340K, so I think the exit temp should be exactly that.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but the exit temp is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the option with the correct length and see if the exit temp is correct.

But since option B's length matches my calculation, and the exit temp seems to be a miscalculation, perhaps I should go with option B, assuming it's the closest match.
</think>

To determine the length of piping required and the maximum temperature at the exit, we start by calculating the heat required to raise the water temperature from 300 K to 340 K. The mass flow rate is given as 4 kg/hr, which converts to approximately 0.001111 kg/s. The specific heat capacity of water is 4180 J/(kg·K), and the temperature change (ΔT) is 40 K. Using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \), the heat required is:

\[
Q = 0.001111 \cdot 4180 \cdot 40 \approx 185.56 \, \text{W}.
\]

The pipe provides 125 W of heat per meter. To find the length of piping required, we divide the total heat required by the heat provided per meter:

\[
L = \frac{185.56}{125} \approx 1.484 \, \text{m}.
\]

This length closely matches the 1.48 m specified in option B. However, the exit temperature in option B is 354.8 K, which is higher than the required 340 K. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem's options or an assumption that the pipe provides more heat than necessary. Despite this, the calculated length aligns with option B, making it the most appropriate choice.
