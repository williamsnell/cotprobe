Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It says that the height of a water column is 600 mm, and I need to find the height of the mercury column. Hmm, I remember from my classes that this has to do with pressure. Both water and mercury columns exert pressure based on their heights and densities.

Wait, pressure is equal to the density of the fluid multiplied by gravity and the height of the column, right? So the formula is P = ρgh. Since both columns are exerting the same pressure at their bases, I can set the two pressures equal to each other.

So, P_water = P_mercury. That means ρ_water * g * h_water = ρ_mercury * g * h_mercury. Oh, the gravity (g) cancels out because it's on both sides. So I can simplify it to ρ_water * h_water = ρ_mercury * h_mercury.

Now, I need to remember the densities. Mercury is much denser than water. I think the density of water is about 1000 kg/m³, and mercury is around 13,600 kg/m³. Let me double-check that. Yes, I'm pretty sure mercury's density is 13.6 times that of water.

So plugging in the numbers: 1000 kg/m³ * 600 mm = 13600 kg/m³ * h_mercury. Let me rearrange this to solve for h_mercury. Divide both sides by 13600: h_mercury = (1000 * 600) / 13600.

Calculating that: 1000 * 600 is 600,000. Divided by 13,600. Let me do the division. 600,000 ÷ 13,600. Hmm, 13,600 times 44 is 600,  because 13,600 * 40 is 544,000, and 13,600 *4 is 54,400. Wait, 544k +54.4k is 600, exactly. So 44 times. So h_mercury is 44 mm? Wait no, wait, wait. Because 13,600 *44 equals 600, 000? Let me check: 13,600 *44. Let's compute 13,600 *40=544,000, and 13,600*4=54,400. Adding them gives 600,000 + 4,000? Wait, no, 544,000 +54,400 is 600,000? No, wait, 544,000 +54,400 is 598,400, which is 598,400, not 600,000. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 600,000 ÷13,600. Let me do this step by step. 13,600 goes into 600,000 how many times? Let's see:

13,600 * 40 = 544,000. Subtract that from 600,000: 600,000 -544,000 =56,000. Now, 13,600 goes into 56,000 about 4 times because 13,600 *4=54,400. So 40 +4=44, and 56,000-54,400=1,600. So it's 44 and 1,600/13,600. 1,600 ÷13,600 is about 0.1176. So total is approximately 44.1176 mm. So rounding that, it's about 44.1 mm.

Looking at the options, option D is 44.1 mm Hg. So that must be the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Options are A:225, B:80, C:32.2, D:44.1, E:136, F:56.3, G:160, H:750, I:600, J:13.6. Yes, D is 44.1, so that's the one.

The height of the mercury column can be determined by equating the pressure exerted by the water column to that of the mercury column. Using the formula \( P = \rho g h \), and knowing the densities of water and mercury, we calculate the mercury height as approximately 44.1 mm.

Answer: D
