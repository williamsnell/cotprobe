Okay, so I have this question about the development of aggression from infancy to adolescence, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that aggression isn't something that just appears suddenly. It probably starts early on. Infancy is the beginning, so I should consider what happens there. I think infants might show aggression through crying or temper tantrums when they're not getting what they want. That makes sense because they can't express themselves clearly yet, so they might get frustrated and act out.

As they grow into early childhood, around toddlers, they start to explore more and interact with others. Their aggression might still be present, but maybe it becomes more directed. For example, hitting or biting when they can't share toys. This is influenced by how parents react. If a parent is more disciplinary, the child might learn to control their aggression better, or if the parent is inconsistent, the child might get confused and keep acting out.

Moving on to later childhood and adolescence, aggression can take more complex forms. Maybe it's not just physical anymore. It could be verbal or social, like bullying or starting rumors. Societal pressures come into play here too, like peer pressure or academic stress. Frustration from not fitting in or doing well in school can contribute to aggressive behaviors.

Looking at the options:

A says aggression develops only during adolescence. That doesn't sound right because I know babies can be aggressive too, even if it's just crying or tantrums.

B talks about aggression starting in infancy with tantrums, influenced by parents and society, then becoming more complex. This aligns with what I was thinkingâ€”infancy, parent influence, then societal factors as they grow.

C says it's innate and doesn't change. I don't think it's entirely innate because environment and learning play a big role. So C might not be correct.

D says it's learned in middle childhood with no prior signs. But I know kids show signs earlier, so D is probably wrong.

E attributes aggression solely to genetics. That's too narrow because environment and experiences also matter.

F says it's learned only from peers in early childhood. But parents and other caregivers influence it too, so F isn't comprehensive.

G claims aggression only happens in social settings. I don't think that's true because kids can be aggressive alone, like hitting a pillow when upset.

H says it's mainly caused by parents. While parents do influence, other factors like peers and school also play a role, so H is too focused on parents.

I says aggression starts with academic pressure in school years. But I know kids show aggression before school age, so I is incorrect.

J attributes it to an identity crisis in adolescence. While identity issues can contribute, aggression starts much earlier, so J is only partially correct.

So putting it all together, option B seems to cover the development from infancy, the influence of parents and society, and the progression into more complex forms later on. It makes sense because it considers both the early stages and the changes as the child grows, incorporating both family dynamics and broader societal influences.

The correct answer is B. Aggression begins in infancy, often manifesting through temper tantrums influenced by parental behavior and societal situations. As the child grows, it evolves into more complex forms, driven by factors like frustration and societal pressures.
