Question:

If a clock chimes every hour the same number of times as the hour it is (e.g., at 3 P.M. it chimes 3 times) and once for every 15-minute increment between hours (e.g., at 3:15, 3:30, and 3:45), what will the total number of chimes be between 5:10 and 7:35 P.M.?

Options:

A: 3
B: 18
C: 9
D: 12
E: 15
F: 24
G: 21
H: 27
I: 30
J: 33

Okay, so I need to figure out how many times the clock chimes between 5:10 P.M. and 7:35 P.M. The clock chimes every hour the same number of times as the hour, like 3 times at 3 P.M. Also, it chimes once for every 15-minute increment between hours, so at 3:15, 3:30, and 3:45, it chimes once each. 

First, I should probably break down the time periods. The time starts at 5:10 and ends at 7:35. So I need to consider each hour and the 15-minute marks within those hours.

Let me list out the hours involved: 5 P.M., 6 P.M., and 7 P.M. But wait, the start time is 5:10, so the 5 P.M. hour's chimes would start after 5:00. But the clock chimes on the hour, so at 5:00, it chimes 5 times. But since our start is at 5:10, do we include the 5:00 chime? Hmm, I think not because the chime happens exactly at the hour, and if we're starting at 5:10, we might miss that. But wait, the question says "between 5:10 and 7:35," so does that include the exact start and end times? That's a bit unclear, but I think it's safer to include the start and end times unless specified otherwise. Wait, no, "between" usually means not including the endpoints. So 5:10 to 7:35 would not include 5:00, 5:10, 7:35. Hmm, but the chimes happen at specific points. Let me think.

Wait, the clock chimes every hour on the hour, so that's at 5:00, 6:00, 7:00, etc. Also, it chimes once every 15 minutes after the hour, so at :15, :30, :45. So between 5:10 and 7:35, that means we need to consider all chimes that happen after 5:10 and before 7:35.

So let's break it down by each hour and the 15-minute marks.

First, the 5 P.M. hour: 
- The chimes at 5:00 have already happened before 5:10, so we don't count that.
- Then, at 5:15, 5:30, 5:45, each would chime once. So that's 3 chimes in the 5 P.M. hour after 5:10.

Next, the 6 P.M. hour:
- At 6:00, the clock chimes 6 times.
- Then, at 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, each chimes once. So that's 3 chimes from the 15-minute marks, plus 6 chimes at 6:00. So total for 6 P.M. is 6 + 3 = 9 chimes.

Then, the 7 P.M. hour:
- At 7:00, it chimes 7 times. But since our end time is 7:35, which is after 7:00, but before 7:45. So the 7:00 chime is included because it's after 5:10 but before 7:35.
- Then, the 15-minute marks: 7:15, 7:30, 7:45. But wait, our end time is 7:35, so 7:45 is after that. So we can only include 7:15 and 7:30 chimes. Each of those is once, so 2 chimes.

Now, let's add it up:
- 5 P.M. after 5:10: 3 chimes.
- 6 P.M.: 9 chimes.
- 7 P.M.: 7 (for 7:00) + 2 (15,30) = 9 chimes.

Wait, that would be 3 + 9 + 9 = 21 chimes. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, 5 P.M. after 5:10: 5:15, 5:30, 5:45 → 3 chimes.

6 P.M.:
- 6:00 → 6 chimes.
- 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 → 3 chimes.
Total for 6 P.M.: 6 + 3 = 9.

7 P.M.:
- 7:00 → 7 chimes.
- 7:15 → 1 chime.
- 7:30 → 1 chime.
- 7:45 → but 7:45 is after 7:35, so we don't count that. So only 2 chimes from 15-minute marks.
So 7 + 2 = 9.

Adding all together: 3 + 9 + 9 = 21.

Wait, but let me confirm if 7:00 is included. Since the end time is 7:35, 7:00 is at 7:00, which is before 7:35, so yes, it's included.

Wait, but another thing: does the 5:10 to 7:35 include the 7:35 time? Because if it's up to 7:35, the chimes at 7:30 are included, but 7:45 is not. So that part is correct.

So total chimes: 3 (5 PM) +9 (6 PM) +9 (7 PM) =21.

Looking at the options, G is 21. So the answer should be G.

The clock chimes every hour according to the hour and once every 15 minutes. Between 5:10 P.M. and 7:35 P.M., the chimes are as follows:

- **5 P.M.**: 3 chimes (at 5:15, 5:30, 5:45).
- **6 P.M.**: 6 chimes at 6:00 and 3 chimes at 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, totaling 9 chimes.
- **7 P.M.**: 7 chimes at 7:00, 1 chime at 7:15, and 1 chime at 7:30, totaling 9 chimes.

Adding these together: 3 + 9 + 9 = 21 chimes.

Answer: G
