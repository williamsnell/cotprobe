Question:

Each year, the local boys' and girls' club sponsors a "Baseball Card Bonanza. " During the three- day event, collectors of baseball cards gather, exchanging and swapping old cards. A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.
B: Yes, because the collector used his knowledge of the card's value to exploit the boy.
C: Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.
D: Yes, because the collector took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge about the card's value.
E: No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.
F: No, because the boy willingly accepted the offer made by the collector.
G: Yes, because the collector was obligated to disclose the true value of the card.
H: No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.
I: No, because the boy had the opportunity to decline the collector's offer.
J: No, because the collector didn't force the boy to sell the card.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the boy can prevail in his claim against the collector for deceit. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A 32-year-old collector approaches a 12-year-old boy and girl at a baseball card event. The collector asks to look through their cards, and they agree. He finds a 1948 Branch Rickey card, which he knows is worth over $500. He offers the boy 50 cents for it because he thinks Rickey isn't a major league player and thus the card isn't valuable. The boy accepts, but later finds out it's worth $600. Now, the boy is suing for deceit.

I remember that deceit, or fraud, generally involves some kind of misrepresentation of fact with the intent to deceive, which causes harm. So, I need to see if the collector did anything that fits this definition.

Looking at the options, the boy is claiming deceit. So, the key elements here are: did the collector make a false statement of fact, with knowledge that it was false, with the intent to deceive, and did the boy rely on that to his detriment?

The collector knew the card was worth over $500 but told the boy it was worth only enough for 50 cents. Wait, but did he explicitly state that it was worth 50 cents, or did he just offer 50 cents without explaining the value? The question says the collector offered 50 cents because he knew the card was worth more. So, the collector didn't necessarily say it's only worth 50 cents; he just made an offer. But maybe the offer was based on the false assumption that the boy thought it wasn't valuable.

The boy thought the card had little value because he didn't know Rickey was a significant figure. So, the collector might have known the boy didn't realize the card's true value. But did the collector actually lie about the card's value, or did he just take advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge?

In contract law, especially regarding minors, there's the concept of unfair contracts where one party takes advantage of the other's lack of knowledge or experience. But this is about deceit, not just unfair terms.

For deceit, the collector would need to have made a false statement. If he didn't explicitly say the card was worth 50 cents but just offered that amount, maybe he didn't make a false representation. He might have thought the boy would realize the offer's low value, but he didn't. But the key is whether there was a misrepresentation.

Wait, the collector knew the value, but the boy didn't. The collector didn't correct the boy's misunderstanding. That's more about taking advantage of someone's lack of knowledge, which could fall under undue influence or unfair dealing, but is it deceit?

Deceit requires intentional misrepresentation. If the collector didn't say anything false, just didn't correct the boy's belief, maybe it's not deceit. It could be seen as taking advantage, but not necessarily deceit.

Looking at the options, some say yes because the collector used his knowledge to exploit the boy (option B) or because he didn't disclose the true value (option C). Others say no because there were no false representations (option E) or the boy accepted the offer willingly (F), or had the chance to decline (I, J).

I think the key is whether the collector made a false statement. If he didn't say the card was worthless, just offered 50 cents, maybe there's no false representation. The boy might have thought the card was worth nothing, so when the collector offered 50 cents, he took it. But the collector didn't lie about the card's value; he just didn't correct the boy's belief.

So, without a false statement, there's no deceit. The collector's silence might not be enough. Therefore, the boy can't win because there was no false representation, just taking advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge.

Looking at the options, E says "No, because the collector made no false representations of fact." That seems correct. So the answer would be E.

The collector did not make a false representation of fact but took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge. Without a false statement, there is no deceit. 

Answer: E
