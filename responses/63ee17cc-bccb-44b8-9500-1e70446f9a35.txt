Okay, so I've got this question about job-scheduling policies and starvation. Hmm, starvation-free means that no job waits forever for service, right? I remember from my studies that some scheduling algorithms can cause certain jobs to be delayed indefinitely, especially if they're not the highest priority or if they're just not being selected often.

The options given are A through H, each with different policies. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Youngest job first. I'm not exactly sure what "youngest" refers to here. Maybe it's the job that arrived most recently? If that's the case, it's like a FIFO but prioritizes newer jobs. But would that cause starvation? I'm not certain. Maybe if older jobs are always waiting, but I'm not sure if it's starvation-free.

Option B: Least frequently used. That sounds like it's using some kind of memory management policy, like in caching. It schedules the job that's been used least often. But does that mean some jobs might be used so infrequently that they wait a long time? Possibly, but I'm not sure if that's considered starvation-free.

Option C: Round-robin. Oh right, round-robin scheduling gives each job a fixed time slice in a cycle. Since every job gets a turn, no job should wait indefinitely because each cycle it gets some CPU time. That sounds starvation-free to me. Because even if a job is long, after its turn, it goes back to the end of the queue, and it will get another chance.

Option D: Most recently used. Similar to option B, but in scheduling terms, it might prioritize jobs that were used more recently. Could lead to some jobs being used a lot but others waiting if they're not used as often. I'm not sure about starvation here.

Option E: Longest job first. Oh, that's the LIFO scheduling. It schedules the longest job first, hoping to get it out of the way. But wait, longer jobs take more time, and shorter jobs might have to wait longer, but does that cause starvation? I think it can, because if a short job comes in after a long one, it has to wait until the long job finishes. But does that mean it waits forever? No, because eventually, the long job will finish, so it's not indefinite. Wait, but starvation-free means no job waits indefinitely. So maybe LIFO isn't the best, but does it cause indefinite waiting? Hmm, I think it depends. If a job is always getting preempted by longer jobs, but each time, it does get to run eventually, so it's not indefinite. So maybe it's starvation-free? Or maybe not, because if the queue keeps getting longer with even longer jobs, a short job might have to wait for a very long time, but not forever. I'm a bit confused here.

Option F: Random job selection. Scheduling randomly could lead to some jobs never being selected for a long time, especially if the selection is purely random and doesn't ensure fairness. So that might cause starvation because a job could be left waiting for a long time without being chosen. So probably not starvation-free.

Option G: Priority queuing. Oh, this is tricky because priority queues can be starvation-free or not depending on how they're implemented. If the priority is static, like based on some fixed criteria, then lower priority jobs might wait indefinitely if higher priority jobs keep arriving. So that's not starvation-free. But if the priority is dynamic and ages over time, like in some real-time systems, then it can prevent starvation. But the question doesn't specify, so I think the default priority queuing might not be starvation-free.

Option H: Shortest job first. This one is interesting. SJF is optimal for minimizing waiting time, but does it cause starvation? Well, if a very long job arrives, all the shorter jobs can be processed quickly, and the long job will take a long time. But if a very long job is always in the queue, the shorter jobs keep getting processed, so the long job would have to wait a lot but eventually gets its turn. But wait, if a job is longer than any others, it might have to wait a long time, but not indefinitely. So does SJF cause starvation? Or does it ensure that each job, regardless of length, gets processed eventually? I think it does, because every job will have a turn once all shorter jobs are done. So SJF is starvation-free.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that in some cases, if a job is much longer than others, it can cause other jobs to wait a long time, but not indefinitely. So SJF is starvation-free because every job will eventually get scheduled, just not always in a timely manner.

So, going back, the question is which policy is starvation-free. Round-robin (C) is definitely starvation-free because each job gets a turn. SJF (H) is also starvation-free because all jobs will eventually be processed. But wait, the question is about which one is starvation-free, so maybe both C and H are correct? But the options are single choices, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, the question is about job-scheduling policies, so Round-robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm that's guaranteed to be starvation-free because each job gets a time slice. SJF is also starvation-free because each job will be processed eventually. But the question asks which one is starvation-free, and the options could have more than one correct, but the given options are A to H, and the answer is to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is Round-robin (C) and Shortest job first (H). But looking back at the options, the answer choices are A to H, and the correct ones are C and H.

Wait, the answer options are given as A to H, and the user provided the options as:

A: Youngest job first

B: Least frequently used

C: Round-robin

D: Most recently used

E: Longest job first

F: Random job selection

G: Priority queuing

H: Shortest job first

So the correct answers would be C and H. But the question says "which of the following," implying one correct answer, but I'm not sure. Wait, the original question says "which of the following" so it's possible that more than one is correct, but the options are A to H, and the answer should be one letter.

Wait, perhaps only Round-robin and Shortest job first are starvation-free. So in the options, both C and H are correct. But the answer provided is C and H. But the question might have intended one correct answer, perhaps only Round-robin is guaranteed to be starvation-free because SJF might have issues with long jobs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. Round-robin is definitely starvation-free because each job gets a turn in each cycle. SJF is also starvation-free because each job will be processed eventually, regardless of its length. But wait, in SJF, a job can only be processed when all shorter jobs before it are done. So if a very long job arrives after many short jobs, it has to wait a long time but will eventually get scheduled. So SJF is starvation-free.

So both C and H are starvation-free. But the question is multiple choice, so perhaps the intended answer is C: Round-robin, because it's a common example of a starvation-free policy, whereas SJF might be considered not starvation-free in some contexts. Alternatively, maybe H is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check some references. Round-robin scheduling is known to be starvation-free because every job gets a time slice. SJF is also starvation-free because each job will eventually be processed. So both C and H are correct. But the options are single letters, and the question expects one answer. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C: Round-robin and H: Shortest job first. But the options don't allow for two letters. So perhaps the question expects both, but the answer is to choose all that apply. But in the given options, the user has to choose one letter.

Wait, the initial question says "which of the following" and the options are A to H. So perhaps the correct answers are both C and H. But looking back at the options, the answer provided is only one letter. So maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is Round-robin (C) and Shortest job first (H). But the answer provided is only one, so perhaps the correct answer is C and H, but the options may have both. But the user's options are A-H, and the answer is to choose one. So perhaps the intended answer is both, but the options are separate. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about SJF. Let me think again.

Wait, in SJF, if a job is longer than all others, it will have to wait until all shorter jobs are processed. But that's not indefinite starvation because it will eventually get scheduled. So SJF is starvation-free. Round-robin is also starvation-free. So both C and H are correct. But the options are single letters, so perhaps the answer expects both, but the user's options are separate. Alternatively, maybe the question is designed to have only one correct answer, which is C: Round-robin.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both C and H, but the user's options don't allow for that. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Round-robin.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of which policies are definitely starvation-free. Round-robin is definitely starvation-free. SJF is also starvation-free. So both C and H are correct. But the answer options are single letters, so perhaps the correct answer is both, but the options are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer, and the intended answer is C: Round-robin.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: starvation occurs when a job is never selected for execution, waiting indefinitely. Round-robin ensures that every job gets a time slice, so no starvation. SJF ensures that every job is processed in order of their length, so the longest job waits until all shorter ones are done, but it's not indefinite. So both are starvation-free.

Therefore, the correct answers are C and H. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the answer is both, but the user's options are separate. Alternatively, the question may have intended only one correct answer, perhaps C: Round-robin.

Wait, but the initial question says "which of the following," so perhaps multiple are correct. But looking back, the options are A to H, and the answer should be one letter. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Round-robin.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both C and H, but I'm not sure how the options are structured. Since the user's answer is to choose one letter, perhaps the intended answer is C: Round-robin.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm certain that both Round-robin and SJF are starvation-free. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and H. But the options don't allow for that, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is C: Round-robin.

Wait, maybe the answer is H: Shortest job first. Because in SJF, every job is processed eventually, so it's starvation-free. But Round-robin is also starvation-free. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and H, but since the user's options are single letters, perhaps the answer is C and H.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The question is which policy is starvation-free. So both C and H are correct, but the answer expects one letter. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Round-robin.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: Shortest job first.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is both C and H. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is both. But the user's options are A to H, and the answer is to choose one. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Round-robin.

Wait, no, I think both are correct. But the options don't allow for multiple selections, so perhaps the answer is C and H. But since the user is to select one, perhaps the correct answer is C: Round-robin.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: Shortest job first.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the definitions again. Starvation-free means that no job waits indefinitely. So in Round-robin, each job gets a time slice, so no starvation. In SJF, each job is processed in order, but a very long job might have to wait a long time but not indefinitely. So SJF is starvation-free. Therefore, both C and H are correct.

But the options don't allow for multiple selections, so perhaps the intended answer is both, but the user is to choose all that apply. But the question is phrased as "which of the following," which can have multiple correct answers. So perhaps the correct answers are C and H.

But the user's options are A to H, and the answer must be one letter. So perhaps the intended answer is both, but the user has to choose all that apply. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: Round-robin.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. I'll go with the most certain one, which is Round-robin (C) is definitely starvation-free. SJF is also starvation-free, but perhaps the intended answer is C: Round-robin.

The question asks which job-scheduling policy is starvation-free, meaning no job waits indefinitely for service. Starvation occurs when a job is never selected for execution, waiting forever. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **A: Youngest job first** is unclear but may prioritize newer jobs, potentially causing older jobs to wait indefinitely.
- **B: Least frequently used** could leave infrequently used jobs waiting, possibly leading to starvation.
- **C: Round-robin** is guaranteed to be starvation-free because every job gets a fixed time slice in a cyclic manner, ensuring no job waits indefinitely.
- **D: Most recently used** may prioritize more recent jobs, leaving others waiting, which could cause starvation.
- **E: Longest job first** (LIFO) may cause shorter jobs to wait for longer jobs but not indefinitely, so it is starvation-free.
- **F: Random job selection** could leave some jobs waiting randomly, potentially causing starvation.
- **G: Priority queuing** may not be starvation-free if lower-priority jobs are indefinitely delayed by higher-priority ones.
- **H: Shortest job first** (SJF) is starvation-free because every job will eventually be processed, even if it waits for shorter jobs.

Both **C (Round-robin)** and **H (Shortest job first)** are starvation-free. However, since the question expects a single answer, **C: Round-robin** is the most definitive choice as it is guaranteed to prevent starvation.
