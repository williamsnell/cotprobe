Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find P(A ∩ B) given P(A), P(B), and P(A ∪ B). Let me try to remember how probability works with unions and intersections.

I think the formula for the probability of the union of two events is P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Yeah, that sounds right. So we're given P(A) = 0.8, P(B) = 0.5, and P(A ∪ B) = 0.9. I need to plug these into the formula to find P(A ∩ B).

Let me write down the formula again: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). So substituting the given values, that's 0.9 = 0.8 + 0.5 - P(A ∩ B).

Wait, let me add 0.8 and 0.5. 0.8 plus 0.5 is 1.3. So the equation becomes 0.9 = 1.3 - P(A ∩ B). Hmm, I need to solve for P(A ∩ B).

So subtract 0.9 from both sides? Or maybe rearrange the equation. Let's see: 0.9 = 1.3 - x, where x is P(A ∩ B). So to find x, I can rearrange it as x = 1.3 - 0.9. That would give x = 0.4. So P(A ∩ B) is 0.4.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If A and B have an intersection of 0.4, then the union would be 0.8 + 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.9, which matches the given P(A ∪ B). So that seems right.

Looking at the options, G is 0.4. So the answer should be G.

The probability of the intersection can be found using the formula P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Substituting the given values, 0.9 = 0.8 + 0.5 - P(A ∩ B), leading to P(A ∩ B) = 0.4. 

Answer: G
