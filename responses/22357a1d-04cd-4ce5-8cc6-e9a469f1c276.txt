Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about magnetic fields and surface current density. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The problem says that each atom has a magnetic dipole moment of 10^-23 A·m². And there are 10^27 atoms per cubic meter. I need to find the surface current density at a surface that makes a 45-degree angle with M, which I think is the direction of the magnetic field or the magnetization.

Wait, surface current density Ks is given by K = M * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the surface and M. Oh right, because the current density is the component of M perpendicular to the surface multiplied by the number of dipoles per unit area.

So first, let's find the magnetization M. Each atom contributes a dipole moment m, so M would be m multiplied by the number of atoms per unit volume, n. So M = n * m.

Plugging in the numbers: m is 1e-23 A·m², and n is 1e27 atoms/m³. So M = 1e27 * 1e-23 = 1e4 A/m. So M is 10,000 A/m.

Now, the surface current density K is M multiplied by sin(theta). Theta here is 45 degrees. Sin(45) is √2/2, which is approximately 0.7071.

So K = 10,000 A/m * 0.7071 ≈ 7071 A/m.

Looking at the options, option C is 7070 A/m, which is close. So the answer should be C.

To determine the surface current density \( K_s \), we use the formula:

\[
K_s = M \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]

where \( M \) is the magnetization and \( \theta \) is the angle between the surface and the magnetization direction.

1. **Calculate Magnetization \( M \):**
   Each atom has a magnetic dipole moment \( m = 10^{-23} \, \text{A·m}^2 \), and there are \( n = 10^{27} \, \text{atoms/m}^3 \). Thus,
   \[
   M = n \cdot m = 10^{27} \cdot 10^{-23} = 10^4 \, \text{A/m}.
   \]

2. **Compute \( \sin(45^\circ) \):**
   \[
   \sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.7071.
   \]

3. **Find Surface Current Density \( K_s \):**
   \[
   K_s = M \cdot \sin(45^\circ) = 10^4 \cdot 0.7071 \approx 7071 \, \text{A/m}.
   \]

The closest option is **C: 7070 A/m**.
