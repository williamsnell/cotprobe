Question:

Suppose you discovered a new species of bioluminescent worm . How could you prove that it was the worm itself and not some contaminating bacteria that was producing the light ?

Options:

A: Feed the worm with special food
B: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or examine it under a microscope
C: Observe the worm in a dark environment
D: Expose the worm to sunlight
E: Treat the worm with antibiotics to eliminate potential bacteria

Okay, so I have this question about proving that a new species of bioluminescent worm itself is producing light and not some contaminating bacteria. Hmm, let's break this down.

The main issue here is determining whether the light source is intrinsic to the worm or if it's coming from bacteria that might be present. So, the goal is to find a method that differentiates between the two.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Feed the worm with special food. I'm not sure how that would help. Maybe if the food affects the light production, but that doesn't directly show it's the worm and not bacteria. Plus, I don't know what the special food would contain.

Option B: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or examine it under a microscope. Wait, if I take the light-producing substance and put it in growth media, I might be able to see if it's bacteria by whether it grows. If it's the worm, maybe the substance isn't bacteria. Or maybe examining under a microscope could show if it's bacteria or part of the worm's structure. That sounds promising because if it's bacteria, they might appear as separate entities, whereas if it's the worm, maybe the light is from the worm's cells.

Option C: Observe the worm in a dark environment. Well, if the worm lights up in the dark, that's normal for bioluminescent organisms. But this doesn't prove it's the worm and not bacteria. Bacteria could also be bioluminescent and respond similarly. So this option doesn't solve the problem.

Option D: Expose the worm to sunlight. Sunlight might affect the worm's behavior or the light production, but I'm not sure how that would show it's the worm. Maybe if the light stops when exposed, but bacteria might react differently. Not a clear solution.

Option E: Treat the worm with antibiotics to eliminate potential bacteria. Oh, that's interesting. If the worm has bacteria, and you treat it with antibiotics, the bacteria would be killed. If the light production stops, that would suggest the bacteria were responsible. If the light continues, maybe it's the worm's own doing. So this could be a good method. But wait, what if the worm itself is affected by antibiotics? If the worm is killed by the treatment, that complicates things. So maybe this isn't the best approach because it might harm the worm.

Wait, but the question is about proving the worm itself is producing the light. So if you treat the worm with antibiotics and the light persists, that suggests it's not bacteria. Alternatively, if the light stops, the bacteria were the source. But I'm not sure if treating the worm with antibiotics is safe. Maybe the worm could die, making it impossible to observe.

Back to option B. If you take the light-producing substance and place it in growth media, you can see if it's bacteria. If it grows, then it's bacterial. If not, maybe it's something else, like part of the worm. Alternatively, looking under a microscope could show whether the light is coming from individual bacterial cells or from the worm's tissues. For example, if the light is uniform and seems to be part of the worm's structure, it's likely the worm. If there are moving bacteria under the microscope emitting light, that would indicate contamination.

So option B seems like a solid approach because it directly examines whether the light source is bacterial or not. It either allows the bacteria to grow, confirming their presence, or shows that the light isn't from bacteria. Option E is risky because it might kill the worm, making it unsuitable for observation. 

Therefore, the best answer is option B.

To determine whether the light is produced by the worm itself or by contaminating bacteria, the most effective approach is to analyze the light-producing substance directly. Option B suggests placing the substance in complete growth media or examining it under a microscope. If bacteria are present, they would grow in the media or appear as distinct entities under the microscope, indicating contamination. Conversely, if the light originates from the worm, no bacterial growth would occur, and the light would likely be uniform and integrated into the worm's structure. This method avoids the risks associated with treating the worm with antibiotics, making it the optimal choice.
