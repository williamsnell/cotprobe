Question:

During the 20th century, how has the focus of security studies changed regarding military security?

Options:

A: The importance of military security in security studies has decreased over the course of the 20th century, with a shifting focus towards personal and societal security.
B: The focus of security studies has been on military security throughout the 20th century, but there has been a growing recognition of the interplay between military security and other sectors, such as environmental and economic security.
C: The focus on military security in security studies has been consistent, but the methods of achieving it have shifted from traditional warfare to cyber warfare.
D: During the Cold War most security analysts agreed that military security should be the focus of security studies; as a result, there was not much discussion about what security entailed, other than the military sector. Following this period security studies have been broadened to include the wider range of sectors that we see today, including environmental and political security.
E: Military security has emerged since the Cold War as the dominant sector within security analysis; both scholars and practitioners recognise the paramount importance of pursuing military security, based on the idea that military capabilities pose the greatest threat to human and state survival.
F: Post-Cold War, security studies have shifted their focus entirely to environmental and economic security, neglecting military security.
G: Military security has remained the sole focus of security studies throughout the 20th century, with no consideration given to other sectors such as environmental or economic security.
H: Security studies has always favoured a wide range of subjects when considering the field of security. Different types of security, most notably of human security and economic security, have enjoyed a great deal of attention in traditional security studies, alongside military security. After the Cold War this approach was broadened to include other types of security such as environmental and personal security.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how the focus of security studies has changed regarding military security during the 20th century. Hmm, I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that security studies traditionally have been focused on military aspects, especially during the Cold War. But I also recall that in recent decades, the field has expanded to include other areas like economic, environmental, and human security. So the shift must have happened somewhere in the latter half of the 20th century.

Looking at the options:

Option A says military security's importance decreased, shifting to personal and societal. That seems possible because I know there's a concept called human security which became prominent, especially post-Cold War.

Option B suggests that military security remained a focus but with recognition of other sectors. This sounds plausible because while military is still important, other factors like environment and economy are now considered as well.

Option C talks about methods shifting from traditional warfare to cyber. While cyber warfare is a modern aspect, the question is about the focus, not the methods. So maybe not the best fit.

Option D mentions that during the Cold War, military was the main focus, and after that, it broadened. This aligns with what I knowâ€”during the Cold War, military was dominant, and post-Cold War, other areas gained attention.

Option E says military emerged as dominant post-Cold War, which contradicts because after the Cold War, the focus was more on other issues like environment and economy, not military.

Option F suggests a complete shift to environmental and economic, neglecting military. That doesn't seem right because military security is still crucial; it's just that other areas are now included.

Option G says military remained the sole focus, which isn't correct because the field has indeed diversified.

Option H talks about a wide range always being favored, including human and economic, and after Cold War more added. This seems accurate but perhaps more detailed than needed.

So, considering all, I think Option D is the best. It correctly states that during the Cold War, military was the focus, and after, it broadened. Option B is also good but maybe doesn't emphasize the shift as clearly as D. Wait, D says "Following this period security studies have been broadened," which is correct. So I'll go with D.

The focus of security studies during the 20th century evolved significantly. During the Cold War, military security was paramount, driven by the ideological and geopolitical tensions between the US and the USSR. However, after the Cold War, the field expanded to incorporate a broader range of issues, including environmental, economic, and human security. This shift reflected the changing nature of threats and challenges faced by states and societies.

Answer: D
