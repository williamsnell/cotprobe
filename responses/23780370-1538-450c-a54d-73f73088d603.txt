Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how economies of scale contribute to growth. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that businesses obtain due to their scale of operation. As a company increases its production, the average cost per unit decreases. This is because fixed costs are spread over more units, and sometimes there are learning curve effects where the firm becomes more efficient as it gains more experience.

Looking at the options:

Option A says economies of scale increase the price of goods. That doesn't seem right. If costs go down, prices might not necessarily increase. In fact, lower costs could allow companies to lower prices, making their products more competitive.

Option B claims they decrease the demand for goods. Lower prices due to economies of scale might actually increase demand because goods become more affordable. So I don't think B is correct either.

Option C states that economies of scale hinder growth by increasing production costs. That's the opposite of what I remember. Economies of scale should reduce costs as production scales up, so this option doesn't make sense.

Option D says they contribute to growth by enabling firms and countries to produce goods at lower average cost. This aligns with what I know. Lower costs mean more efficient production, which can lead to increased output, higher profits, and reinvestment, all of which contribute to economic growth.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.
