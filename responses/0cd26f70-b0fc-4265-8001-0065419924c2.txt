Okay, so I have this question about channel capacity in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Hmm, I remember that channel capacity is the maximum mutual information between the input and output, given the constraints on the input power. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says the expected output power constraint is P=2. So, Y = X + Z, where Z is a zero-mean Gaussian with unit variance, and independent of X. Oh wait, the constraint is on E(Y²) ≤ 2. Wait, but Y is X + Z, so let me think about that.

First, the output Y's expected power is E[Y²] = E[(X+Z)²]. Expanding that, it's E[X² + 2XZ + Z²]. Since X and Z are independent, E[XZ] = E[X]E[Z] = 0 because Z has mean zero. So E[Y²] = E[X²] + E[Z²]. E[Z²] is the variance of Z, which is 1 because Z ~ N(0,1). So E[Y²] = E[X²] + 1.

But the constraint is E[Y²] ≤ 2. So substituting, E[X²] + 1 ≤ 2 → E[X²] ≤ 1. Wait, that's the constraint on X? Because X is the input, and the output's power depends on X. So the input X must have E[X²] ≤ 1. Oh wait, but in the standard AWGN channel, the constraint is often E[X²] ≤ P, where P is the power. Here, it's given that E[Y²] ≤ 2, which translates to E[X²] ≤ 1.

So the input X is subject to E[X²] ≤ 1. Now, the capacity of an AWGN channel is given by the formula C = 0.5 * log2(1 + SNR), where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio. Wait, but what's the SNR here?

In the standard case, the noise has variance N0/2, but in this problem, Z has variance 1. Wait, because Z ~ N(0,1), so its variance is 1. So the noise power is 1. The signal power is E[X²], which is constrained to be at most 1. So SNR would be E[X²]/(variance of Z) = 1/1 = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The standard formula for capacity when the noise has variance N is C = (1/2) log2(1 + (E[X²]/N)). Here, N is 1, and E[X²] ≤ 1, so the maximum occurs when E[X²] =1. So the SNR is 1/1=1.

So substituting into the formula, C = 0.5 * log2(1 + 1) = 0.5 * log2(2) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 bits per channel use.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The output constraint is E[Y²] ≤2, which gives us E[X²] ≤1. So yes, the maximum power for X is 1, and the noise power is 1. So SNR is 1.

Alternatively, sometimes SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power spectral density. Wait, in some contexts, the noise is given as N0/2 per Hz, but in this problem, Z is just Gaussian with variance 1. So maybe the noise power is 1, and the signal power is 1, so SNR is 1.

So yes, the capacity is 0.5 * log2(1 + 1) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5. So that's 0.5 bits per second or per channel use.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.5. So the answer should be F.

The channel capacity is calculated using the formula for an AWGN channel, which depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Given the constraint \( E[Y^2] \leq 2 \), we find \( E[X^2] \leq 1 \) since \( E[Y^2] = E[X^2] + 1 \). The noise variance is 1, so the SNR is \( 1/1 = 1 \). Substituting into the capacity formula \( C = 0.5 \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}) \), we get \( C = 0.5 \log_2(2) = 0.5 \) bits per channel use.
