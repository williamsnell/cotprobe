Alright, let me work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to statistics, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, the question is about calculating three things for a sample of 25 female Drosophila: the mean number of eggs laid, the variance and standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean. The data provided is a list of 25 numbers representing the number of eggs each fly laid in 24 hours.

The options given are A through J, each providing values for mean, variance, standard deviation, and standard error. I need to figure out which option is correct.

Let's start with part (a): calculating the mean. The mean is the average of all the numbers. To find this, I'll add up all the eggs and then divide by the number of flies, which is 25.

So, let's list all the numbers again to make sure I add correctly:

97, 79, 88, 91, 88, 86, 104, 89, 91, 92, 103, 96, 101, 94, 91, 92, 94, 95, 88, 89, 90, 93, 84, 87, 93.

I'll add them one by one:

Let me group them to make adding easier.

First group: 97 + 79 = 176
Second: 88 +91=179 → total so far 176+179=355
Third:88 +86=174 → 355+174=529
Fourth:104 +89=193 → 529+193=722
Fifth:91 +92=183 → 722+183=905
Sixth:103 +96=199 → 905+199=1104
Seventh:101 +94=195 → 1104+195=1299
Eighth:91 +92=183 → 1299+183=1482
Ninth:94 +95=189 → 1482+189=1671
Tenth:88 +89=177 → 1671+177=1848
Eleventh:90 +93=183 → 1848+183=2031
Twelfth:84 +87=171 → 2031+171=2202
Thirteenth:93 → 2202+93=2295

Wait, that can't be right because adding 25 numbers shouldn't sum to 2295. Let me recount because 25 numbers at around 90 each would sum to about 2250, so maybe 2295 is possible. Let me double-check the addition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should add each number individually:

97
+79 = 176
+88 = 264
+91 = 355
+88 = 443
+86 = 529
+104 = 633
+89 = 722
+91 = 813
+92 = 905
+103 = 1008
+96 = 1104
+101 = 1205
+94 = 1299
+91 = 1390
+92 = 1482
+94 = 1576
+95 = 1671
+88 = 1759
+89 = 1848
+90 = 1938
+93 = 2031
+84 = 2115
+87 = 2192
+93 = 2285

Wait, that's 2285. So the sum is 2285. Now, the mean is 2285 divided by 25.

2285 ÷ 25 = ?

Well, 25 × 90 = 2250, so 2285 - 2250 = 35. So 90 + (35/25) = 90 + 1.4 = 91.4.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have a mean of 91.4. Let me check my addition again because I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recount using a different approach. Maybe I missed a number or added incorrectly.

Let me list all 25 numbers and add them step by step:

1. 97 → total=97
2. 79 → 97+79=176
3. 88 → 176+88=264
4. 91 → 264+91=355
5. 88 → 355+88=443
6. 86 → 443+86=529
7. 104 → 529+104=633
8. 89 → 633+89=722
9. 91 → 722+91=813
10. 92 → 813+92=905
11. 103 → 905+103=1008
12. 96 → 1008+96=1104
13. 101 → 1104+101=1205
14. 94 → 1205+94=1299
15. 91 → 1299+91=1390
16. 92 → 1390+92=1482
17. 94 → 1482+94=1576
18. 95 → 1576+95=1671
19. 88 → 1671+88=1759
20. 89 → 1759+89=1848
21. 90 → 1848+90=1938
22. 93 → 1938+93=2031
23. 84 → 2031+84=2115
24. 87 → 2115+87=2202
25. 93 → 2202+93=2295

Wait, I think I added correctly this time. So the sum is 2295, and the mean is 2295/25.

2295 ÷ 25 = 91.8.

Okay, that makes more sense. So the mean is 91.8. Looking at the options, option D has a mean of 91.8. So that's a good start.

Now, moving on to part (b): variance and standard deviation. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of variance.

Since this is a sample, we'll use the sample variance formula, which divides by (n-1) instead of n.

First, I need to calculate each (x_i - mean)^2, sum them, then divide by 24 (since n=25, n-1=24) to get the sample variance. Then, the standard deviation is the square root of that.

Let me start by calculating each (x_i - 91.8)^2.

But this will take a while. Maybe I can find a faster way or look for a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

Variance = (sum of squares) / (n-1), where sum of squares is the sum of each x_i squared.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to compute each (x_i - mean)^2, sum them, then divide by n-1.

Alternatively, another formula: sum of squares = sum(x_i^2) - (sum x_i)^2 / n.

Yes, that's a useful formula. So, sum of squares = sum(x_i^2) - (sum x_i)^2 / n.

Once I have sum(x_i^2), I can plug in the values.

First, I need to compute sum(x_i^2). Let me list each x_i and compute x_i squared.

Let's go through each number:

1. 97 → 97^2 = 9409
2. 79 → 6241
3. 88 → 7744
4. 91 → 8281
5. 88 → 7744
6. 86 → 7396
7. 104 → 10816
8. 89 → 7921
9. 91 → 8281
10. 92 → 8464
11. 103 → 10609
12. 96 → 9216
13. 101 → 10201
14. 94 → 8836
15. 91 → 8281
16. 92 → 8464
17. 94 → 8836
18. 95 → 9025
19. 88 → 7744
20. 89 → 7921
21. 90 → 8100
22. 93 → 8649
23. 84 → 7056
24. 87 → 7569
25. 93 → 8649

Now, let me sum these squares:

I'll add them step by step.

1. 9409
2. 9409 + 6241 = 15650
3. 15650 + 7744 = 23394
4. 23394 + 8281 = 31675
5. 31675 + 7744 = 39419
6. 39419 + 7396 = 46815
7. 46815 + 10816 = 57631
8. 57631 + 7921 = 65552
9. 65552 + 8281 = 73833
10. 73833 + 8464 = 82297
11. 82297 + 10609 = 92906
12. 92906 + 9216 = 102122
13. 102122 + 10201 = 112323
14. 112323 + 8836 = 121159
15. 121159 + 8281 = 129440
16. 129440 + 8464 = 137904
17. 137904 + 8836 = 146740
18. 146740 + 9025 = 155765
19. 155765 + 7744 = 163509
20. 163509 + 7921 = 171430
21. 171430 + 8100 = 179530
22. 179530 + 8649 = 188179
23. 188179 + 7056 = 195235
24. 195235 + 7569 = 202804
25. 202804 + 8649 = 211453

So, sum of squares is 211,453.

Now, sum(x_i) is 2295, so (sum x_i)^2 = 2295^2.

Let me compute that:

2295 × 2295.

I can compute this as (2300 - 5)^2 = 2300^2 - 2*2300*5 +5^2.

2300^2 = 5,290,000

2*2300*5 = 23,000

5^2 =25

So, (2300-5)^2 =5,290,000 -23,000 +25 =5,267,025.

Wait, no: (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b², so yes.

So, 5,290,000 - 23,000 +25 =5,267,025 +25=5,267,050.

Wait, 5,290,000 -23,000 is 5,267,000. Then +25 is 5,267,025.

Wait, no, because 2300*5=11,500, so 2*2300*5=23,000.

So, 5,290,000 -23,000 =5,267,000. Then +25 gives 5,267,025.

So, sum(x_i)^2 =5,267,025.

Now, sum(x_i^2) =211,453.

So, sum of squares = sum(x_i^2) - (sum x_i)^2 / n.

sum of squares =211,453 - (5,267,025 /25).

5,267,025 ÷25 =210,681.

So, sum of squares =211,453 -210,681 =772.

Wait, that can't be right because 211,453 minus 210,681 is 772. That seems very low. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, let me double-check sum(x_i^2). I added all the squares and got 211,453. Let me verify a few of them to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

For example:

97^2 =9409 (correct)
79^2=6241 (correct)
88^2=7744 (correct)
91^2=8281 (correct)
88^2=7744 (correct)
86^2=7396 (correct)
104^2=10816 (correct)
89^2=7921 (correct)
91^2=8281 (correct)
92^2=8464 (correct)
103^2=10609 (correct)
96^2=9216 (correct)
101^2=10201 (correct)
94^2=8836 (correct)

93^2=8649 (correct)
84^2=7056 (correct)
87^2=7569 (correct)
93^2=8649 (correct)

Adding them up again step by step:

1. 9409
2. 9409 +6241=15650
3. 15650 +7744=23394
4. 23394 +8281=31675
5. 31675 +7744=39419
6. 39419 +7396=46815
7. 46815 +10816=57631
8. 57631 +7921=65552
9. 65552 +8281=73833
10. 73833 +8464=82297
11. 82297 +10609=92906
12. 92906 +9216=102122
13. 102122 +10201=112323
14. 112323 +8836=121159
15. 121159 +8281=129440
16. 129440 +8464=137904
17. 137904 +8836=146740
18. 146740 +9025=155765
19. 155765 +7744=163509
20. 163509 +7921=171430
21. 171430 +8100=179530
22. 179530 +8649=188179
23. 188179 +7056=195235
24. 195235 +7569=202804
25. 202804 +8649=211453

Yes, that's correct. So sum(x_i^2) is indeed 211,453.

Now, sum(x_i)^2 =2295^2=5,267,025.

Then, sum(x_i^2) - (sum x_i)^2 /n =211,453 - (5,267,025 /25).

5,267,025 ÷25=210,681.

So, 211,453 -210,681=772.

That's the sum of squared deviations. Now, variance is this sum divided by (n-1)=24.

So variance=772/24≈32.1667.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says variance=31.17. Hmm, that's close but not exactly 32.1667. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Maybe I made an error in the sum of squares.

Wait, 772 divided by 24 is 32.1667, which is approximately 32.17. But none of the options have that. Option D's variance is 31.17. Let me check if I made a mistake in the sum of squares.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of squares. Let me recount a few of the squares to see if I added correctly.

Looking back at the squares:

1. 97^2=9409
2. 79^2=6241 → total after 2: 9409+6241=15650
3. 88^2=7744 → 15650+7744=23394
4. 91^2=8281 → 23394+8281=31675
5. 88^2=7744 → 31675+7744=39419
6. 86^2=7396 → 39419+7396=46815
7. 104^2=10816 → 46815+10816=57631
8. 89^2=7921 → 57631+7921=65552
9. 91^2=8281 → 65552+8281=73833
10. 92^2=8464 → 73833+8464=82297
11. 103^2=10609 → 82297+10609=92906
12. 96^2=9216 → 92906+9216=102122
13. 101^2=10201 → 102122+10201=112323
14. 94^2=8836 → 112323+8836=121159
15. 91^2=8281 → 121159+8281=129440
16. 92^2=8464 → 129440+8464=137904
17. 94^2=8836 → 137904+8836=146740
18. 95^2=9025 → 146740+9025=155765
19. 88^2=7744 → 155765+7744=163509
20. 89^2=7921 → 163509+7921=171430
21. 90^2=8100 → 171430+8100=179530
22. 93^2=8649 → 179530+8649=188179
23. 84^2=7056 → 188179+7056=195235
24. 87^2=7569 → 195235+7569=202804
25. 93^2=8649 → 202804+8649=211453

Yes, that's correct. So sum(x_i^2)=211,453.

Then sum(x_i)^2=2295^2=5,267,025.

So sum of squares=211,453 - (5,267,025 /25)=211,453 -210,681=772.

Now, variance=772/24≈32.1667.

Hmm, but option D says variance=31.17, which is close but not the same. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the variance using the other method: sum each (x_i - mean)^2 and then divide by n-1.

Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result.

Mean is 91.8.

Compute each (x_i -91.8)^2:

1. 97 -91.8=5.2 → 5.2^2=27.04
2. 79 -91.8=−12.8 → (−12.8)^2=163.84
3. 88 -91.8=−3.8 → 14.44
4. 91 -91.8=−0.8 → 0.64
5. 88 -91.8=−3.8 →14.44
6. 86 -91.8=−5.8 →33.64
7. 104 -91.8=12.2 →148.84
8. 89 -91.8=−2.8 →7.84
9. 91 -91.8=−0.8 →0.64
10. 92 -91.8=0.2 →0.04
11. 103 -91.8=11.2 →125.44
12. 96 -91.8=4.2 →17.64
13. 101 -91.8=9.2 →84.64
14. 94 -91.8=2.2 →4.84
15. 91 -91.8=−0.8 →0.64
16. 92 -91.8=0.2 →0.04
17. 94 -91.8=2.2 →4.84
18. 95 -91.8=3.2 →10.24
19. 88 -91.8=−3.8 →14.44
20. 89 -91.8=−2.8 →7.84
21. 90 -91.8=−1.8 →3.24
22. 93 -91.8=1.2 →1.44
23. 84 -91.8=−7.8 →60.84
24. 87 -91.8=−4.8 →23.04
25. 93 -91.8=1.2 →1.44

Now, let's add all these squared differences:

Let me list them:

27.04, 163.84, 14.44, 0.64,14.44,33.64,148.84,7.84,0.64,0.04,125.44,17.64,84.64,4.84,0.64,0.04,4.84,10.24,14.44,7.84,3.24,1.44,60.84,23.04,1.44.

Adding step by step:

Starting with 0.

1. +27.04 →27.04
2. +163.84 →190.88
3. +14.44 →205.32
4. +0.64 →205.96
5. +14.44 →220.40
6. +33.64 →254.04
7. +148.84 →402.88
8. +7.84 →410.72
9. +0.64 →411.36
10. +0.04 →411.40
11. +125.44 →536.84
12. +17.64 →554.48
13. +84.64 →639.12
14. +4.84 →643.96
15. +0.64 →644.60
16. +0.04 →644.64
17. +4.84 →649.48

Yes! The sum of squared differences is 772, same as before. So variance is 772/24≈32.1667.

Wait, but none of the options have 32.17 as variance. The closest is option D with 31.17. Did I make a mistake in the mean calculation?

Wait, earlier I thought the mean was 91.8, which matches option D. But the variance is coming out as ~32.17, but option D says 31.17.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares. Let me recount the sum of squared differences.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the sum of squares again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in adding the squared differences. Let me recount that sum.

Wait, when I added them step by step, I got 772.00. So that seems correct.

But according to the formula, sum of squares is 772, so variance is 772/24≈32.1667.

But none of the options have that. Let me look back at the options.

Looking at option D:

(a) mean =91.8, (b) variance=31.17, standard deviation=5.58, (c) standard error=1.11.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, variance is ~32.17, which would make standard deviation sqrt(32.17)=5.67.

But option D says standard deviation=5.58, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the standard deviation from the variance.

If variance is 32.17, then standard deviation is sqrt(32.17)≈5.67.

But option D's standard deviation is 5.58, which is a bit lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.

Wait, let me check the sum of squared differences again.

Let me list each squared difference again:

1. 27.04
2. 163.84
3. 14.44
4. 0.64
5. 14.44
6. 33.64
7. 148.84
8. 7.84
9. 0.64
10. 0.04
11. 125.44
12. 17.64
13. 84.64
14. 4.84
15. 0.64
16. 0.04
17. 4.84
18. 10.24
19. 14.44

21. 3.24
22. 1.44
23. 60.84
24. 23.04
25. 1.44

Let me add them in pairs to see if I get the same total:

Pair 1: 27.04 +163.84=190.88
Pair 2:14.44 +0.64=15.08
Pair3:14.44 +33.64=48.08
Pair4:148.84 +7.84=156.68
Pair5:0.64 +0.04=0.68
Pair6:125.44 +17.64=143.08
Pair7:84.64 +4.84=89.48
Pair8:0.64 +0.04=0.68
Pair9:4.84 +10.24=15.08
Pair10:14.44 +7.84=22.28
Pair11:3.24 +1.44=4.68
Pair12:60.84 +23.04=83.88
Pair13:1.44 → remains 1.44

Now, adding all these:

190.88
+15.08 →205.96
+48.08 →254.04
+156.68 →410.72
+0.68 →411.40
+143.08 →554.48
+89.48 →643.96
+0.68 →644.64
+15.08 →659.72
+22.28 →682.00
+4.68 →686.68
+83.88 →770.56
+1.44 →772.00

Yes, that's correct. So the sum is indeed 772. Therefore, variance is 772/24≈32.1667.

But none of the options have this. Let me check other options. Option D has variance=31.17, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mean. Let me recalculate the mean.

Sum of all eggs:2295.

n=25.

2295 ÷25=91.8. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the variance is calculated differently. Maybe the question uses population variance, which divides by n instead of n-1.

If that's the case, variance=772/25=30.88.

Which is approximately 30.88, but that's not matching any option either. Option D's variance is 31.17, which is close to 30.88.

Wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed to calculate the standard error and see if it aligns with any option.

Standard error of the mean is standard deviation divided by sqrt(n).

If variance is 32.17, standard deviation is sqrt(32.17)=5.67.

Standard error=5.67 / sqrt(25)=5.67/5=1.134.

Looking at the options, option D's standard error is 1.11, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, if variance is 31.17, standard deviation would be sqrt(31.17)=5.58, which matches option D.

Wait, but I calculated variance as 32.17, which would give standard deviation=5.67 and standard error=1.134.

But option D says variance=31.17, standard deviation=5.58, and standard error=1.11.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares. Let me recount the sum of squares again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a value or added incorrectly. Let me recount the sum of the squared differences.

Let me list each squared difference:

1. 5.2^2=27.04
2. (-12.8)^2=163.84
3. (-3.8)^2=14.44
4. (-0.8)^2=0.64

6. (-5.8)^2=33.64
7. 12.2^2=148.84
8. (-2.8)^2=7.84
9. (-0.8)^2=0.64
10. 0.2^2=0.04
11. 11.2^2=125.44

23. (-7.8)^2=60.84
24. (-4.8)^2=23.04
25. 1.2^2=1.44

Adding them again:

27.04
+163.84=190.88
+14.44=205.32
+0.64=205.96
+14.44=220.40

+84.64=639.12
+4.84=643.96
+0.64=644.60
+0.04=644.64

+1.44=686.68
+60.84=747.52
+23.04=770.56
+1.44=772.00

Yes, sum is 772. So variance must be 772/24≈32.1667.

But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question uses population variance (divided by n) instead of sample variance. Let's try that.

Variance=772/25=30.88.

Standard deviation=sqrt(30.88)=5.556≈5.56.

Standard error=5.556/sqrt(25)=5.556/5=1.111≈1.11.

Looking at the options, option D says variance=31.17, standard deviation=5.58, standard error=1.11.

Hmm, if I use population variance, variance=30.88, which is close to 31.17 but not exact. The standard error would be 1.11, which matches option D.

But I'm confused because the question says "sample," so it should be sample variance (divided by n-1=24), which gives 32.17.

But perhaps the options have rounded numbers. Let me check the options again.

Option D: variance=31.17, standard deviation=5.58, standard error=1.11.

If I calculate variance as 31.17, then variance×24=31.17×24=748.08, but my sum of squares is 772, so that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean.

Wait, mean is sum divided by n, which is 2295/25=91.8. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to calculate standard error using the mean and standard deviation.

Wait, standard error is standard deviation divided by sqrt(n).

If standard deviation is 5.58, then standard error=5.58/5=1.116≈1.12. But option D says 1.11.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the variance is 31.17, which would give standard deviation=5.58, and standard error=5.58/5=1.116≈1.12.

But option D says standard error=1.11, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct variance is 31.17, which would mean that my initial calculation was wrong. But I can't see where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the sum of squares. Let me recount the sum of squared differences.

Let me list each squared difference and add them again:

1. 27.04
2. 163.84 → total=190.88
3. 14.44 → 205.32
4. 0.64 →205.96
5. 14.44 →220.40
6. 33.64 →254.04
7. 148.84 →402.88
8. 7.84 →410.72
9. 0.64 →411.36
10. 0.04 →411.40
11. 125.44 →536.84
12. 17.64 →554.48
13. 84.64 →639.12
14. 4.84 →643.96
15. 0.64 →644.60
16. 0.04 →644.64
17. 4.84 →649.48
18. 10.24 →659.72
19. 14.44 →674.16
20. 7.84 →682.00
21. 3.24 →685.24
22. 1.44 →686.68
23. 60.84 →747.52
24. 23.04 →770.56
25. 1.44 →772.00

Yes, sum is 772. So variance is 772/24≈32.1667.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a mistake, or I made a miscalculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should check the sum of the original data again.

Let me recount the sum:

97 +79=176

+88=264

+91=355

+88=443

+86=529

+104=633

+89=722

+91=813

+92=905

+103=1008

+96=1104

+101=1205

+94=1299

+91=1390

+92=1482

+94=1576

+95=1671

+88=1759

+89=1848

+90=1938

+93=2031

+84=2115

+87=2202

+93=2295.

Yes, sum is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the variance is 31.17, and I should proceed with that.

If variance is 31.17, then standard deviation is sqrt(31.17)=5.58, and standard error=5.58/5=1.116≈1.12.

Looking at option D, it's 1.11, which is close.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option D: (a)91.8, (b)variance=31.17, (c)standard error=1.11.

But according to my calculations, variance is 32.17, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, option D is the closest, so perhaps that's the intended answer.
</think>

The calculations yield a mean of 91.8 eggs per female. The variance and standard deviation were computed using the sum of squared deviations, resulting in a variance of approximately 32.17 and a standard deviation of approximately 5.67. However, none of the options exactly match these values. Option D provides the closest values: variance = 31.17, standard deviation = 5.58, and standard error = 1.11. Given the rounding and potential differences in calculation methods, option D is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: D
