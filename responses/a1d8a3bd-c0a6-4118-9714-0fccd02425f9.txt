Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
B: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
C: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
D: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read through it carefully.

In 1996, a developer bought a 100-acre tract in a northern county. Then, in 1997, they prepared a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre lots. They recorded the plan in the county recorder's office. From 1997 to 2003, the developer sold 60 lots, each with a deed that required recording and a restriction against mobile homes. In 2003, the developer sold the remaining 40 lots to a builder, using the same language as the previous deeds. This deed was recorded. By 2008, the builder sold all 40 lots, but the deeds didn't include the mobile home clause. Then, in 2009, a buyer who bought one of those 40 lots from the builder placed a mobile home on their property. The question is about the least accurate statement regarding the buyer's deed.

The options are A through D. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the concept of covenants running with the land. A covenant runs with the land if it's intended to benefit the land and touch and concern the land, among other criteria. Here, the restriction against mobile homes is a covenant that the developer included in the deeds. 

When the developer sold 60 lots, each deed had the mobile home restriction. Then, the developer sold the remaining 40 to the builder, also with the same language. However, when the builder sold those 40 lots, they didn't include the clause. Now, the buyer placed a mobile home, and we're assessing the statements about the buyer's deed.

Option A: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not as far as the buyer. Hmm. If the developer sold the 40 lots to the builder, and the deed had the covenant, then the covenant would run with the land to the builder. But when the builder sells to the buyer, if the builder didn't include the covenant in the deed, would it still apply? I think the covenant would only run if it's in the chain of title. Since the builder didn't include it, the buyer might not be bound. So A could be correct.

Option B: The covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. If the covenant is enforceable, neighboring property owners (lot owners) can enforce it. But if the covenant didn't run to the buyer, then B might not be accurate. Alternatively, if the covenant is part of the subdivision plan and recorded, all lot owners would be bound, regardless of whether the builder included it in their sales. Wait, but if the builder didn't include it in their deeds, does that mean the buyer isn't bound? Or does the recording of the original subdivision plan affect later buyers? I'm a bit confused here.

Option C: The buyer had constructive notice. Constructive notice comes from recording. The original subdivision plan and the developer's deeds were recorded. So the buyer, when purchasing from the builder, should have checked the records. If the restriction was in the original plan or in the developer's deed to the builder, the buyer would have constructive notice. But since the builder's deed didn't include it, maybe the buyer didn't have notice. But wait, the subdivision plan was recorded, so the buyer would know the general restrictions. So C might be correct because the buyer should have known about the restriction from the recorded plan.

Option D: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate. Privity of estate refers to the chain of title. If the builder's deed didn't include the covenant, then the subsequent grantees (like the buyer) wouldn't be in privity as far as the covenant is concerned. So D might be incorrect because the grantees aren't bound by a covenant not included in their deeds.

Wait, but the original developer's deed to the builder had the covenant. So the builder was subject to it. But when the builder sells, does the covenant run to the buyer? For a covenant to run, it needs to touch and concern the land, be intended to run, and be recorded. The original covenant was recorded, so when the builder sells, would the buyer be bound? Or does the builder's failure to include it in the deed break the chain?

I think when a covenant is in a deed, it runs with the land unless it's personal. Here, it's a servitude touching and concerning the land, so it should run. But if the builder's deed to the buyer didn't include it, does that mean the buyer isn't bound? Or does the covenant still apply because it was in the original developer's deed to the builder, and the builder's deed to the buyer is subject to prior encumbrances? 

Wait, when a grantor conveys property subject to a covenant, the grantee takes subject to that covenant. So if the developer conveyed to the builder with the covenant, the builder's title is subject to it. Then, when the builder conveys to the buyer, the buyer takes subject to the covenants in the builder's title. So the buyer would be bound by the covenant, even if the builder's deed didn't mention it. So in that case, the buyer should have constructive notice because the original plan was recorded, and the covenant would run. 

But that's a bit conflicting. Alternatively, if the covenant wasn't included in the builder's deed to the buyer, then the buyer might not have actual notice, but constructive notice comes from the records. So the buyer should have checked the chain of title and would have found the original covenant in the developer's deed to the builder. So the buyer would have constructive notice of the restriction. So option C would be correct because the buyer should have known.

But the question is about the least accurate statement. So which option is incorrect?

Looking at the options again:

A: The covenant ran to the builder but not the buyer. If the covenant runs, then it should bind the builder and the buyer. So A would be incorrect if the covenant does run to the buyer. So A is the least accurate.

B: Any lot owner can enforce. If the covenant is enforceable, then yes, any lot owner can. So B is accurate.

C: Buyer had constructive notice. Since the original plan and developer's deed were recorded, the buyer should have known. So C is accurate.

D: Subsequent grantees are in privity. If the covenant runs, then the buyer is in privity. So D is accurate.

Wait, but if the builder didn't include the covenant in their deed to the buyer, does the covenant still run? Or does the lack of inclusion in the deed break the chain? I'm a bit confused.

In real c covenant law, a covenant runs with the land if it's in the deed and touches and concerns the land. Once the developer's deed to the builder includes it, the builder is bound, and any subsequent grantees would take subject to that covenant, even if not mentioned in their deed. So the buyer would be bound, and thus the covenant runs. So A is incorrect because it says it didn't run to the buyer. Therefore, the least accurate statement would be A.

The question revolves around whether a covenant prohibiting mobile homes runs with the land from the developer to the builder and then to the buyer. The covenant was included in the developer's deeds to the initial 60 lot owners and the builder but not in the builder's deeds to the subsequent buyers. The key issue is whether the covenant remains enforceable against the buyer despite its omission in the builder's deed.

- **Option A** suggests the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not the buyer. However, covenants that touch and concern the land and are recorded typically run with the land, binding subsequent grantees even if not explicitly included in their deeds. Therefore, this statement is inaccurate because the covenant likely runs to the buyer.

- **Option B** states the covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. This is accurate because covenants that benefit the land can generally be enforced by neighboring property owners.

- **Option C** claims the buyer had constructive notice of the restriction. This is correct because the original subdivision plan and developer's deeds were recorded, giving the buyer constructive notice of the covenant.

- **Option D** asserts all subsequent grantees of the builder are in privity of estate. This is accurate because the covenant would bind subsequent grantees if it runs with the land.

The least accurate statement is **A**, as the covenant likely runs with the land to the buyer despite the builder's omission in their deed.
