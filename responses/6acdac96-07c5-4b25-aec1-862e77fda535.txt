Question:

Which of the following is true about the assessment of arm reflexes?

Options:

A: The biceps reflex is not related to any root value
B: Striking the Achilles tendon is used to assess arm reflexes
C: Brachioradialis reflex is assessed by tapping the bicep tendon

E: The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa
F: The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6
G: Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion
H: Absence of reflex when tapping a tendon indicates a higher motor neurone lesion
I: The root value of the triceps reflex is C5, C6

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the assessment of arm reflexes. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to think it through.

The question asks which of the options is true. The options are A to I. Let's go through each one carefully.

Option A: The biceps reflex is not related to any root value. Hmm, I remember that reflexes are related to specific spinal cord levels or roots. The biceps reflex is usually tested by tapping the biceps tendon, and I think it's associated with the C5 and C6 roots. So A might not be correct because it's saying it's unrelated, which I don't think is true.

Option B: Striking the Achilles tendon is used to assess arm reflexes. Wait, the Achilles tendon is in the leg, right? So tapping that would relate to the knee-jerk reflex, which is a leg reflex. So B is probably false because it's about arm reflexes, not leg.

Option C: Brachioradialis reflex is assessed by tapping the bicep tendon. I'm a bit confused here. The brachioradialis is a muscle in the forearm, isn't it? So its tendon is in the forearm. Tapping the bicep tendon would test the biceps reflex, not brachioradialis. So C might be false.

Option D: An absent reflex when tapping a tendon is a normal finding. Well, reflexes can vary, but generally, an absent reflex could indicate a problem, like a lesion in the nerve pathway. So D probably isn't correct because it's not normal to have no reflex unless there's an issue.

Option E: The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa. The antecubital fossa is the area on the front of the elbow. The triceps tendon is at the back of the elbow (olecranon fossa), so E is likely incorrect.

Option F: The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6. From what I remember, yes, the biceps reflex is at C5 and C6. So F sounds correct.

Option G: Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion. Wait, brisk reflexes are usually indicative of an upper motor neurone lesion because the lower motor neurones are intact, so the reflex is exaggerated. So G might be incorrect because brisk jerks suggest UMN lesion, not LMN.

Option H: Absence of reflex when tapping a tendon indicates a higher motor neurone lesion. If the reflex is absent, it usually points to a lower motor neurone lesion because the nerve isn't conducting the signal. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: The root value of the triceps reflex is C5, C6. I think the triceps reflex is at C6 and C7. So I is incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. The root value for biceps is C5 and C6.

The correct answer is F: The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6.
