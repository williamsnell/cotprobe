Okay, so I have this question here asking which number is a multiple of 7. The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 27 to 111. I need to figure out which one is divisible by 7. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a multiple of 7 is any number that can be expressed as 7 multiplied by an integer. So, if I can divide each option by 7 and see if the result is a whole number, that should tell me which one is a multiple.

Let me list out the options again to keep track:

A: 27
B: 74
C: 56
D: 83
E: 111
F: 61
G: 48
H: 102
I: 94
J: 75

I'll go through each one step by step.

Starting with A: 27. I know that 7 times 3 is 21, and 7 times 4 is 28. So 27 is between those, which means it's not a multiple of 7. Alternatively, I can do 27 divided by 7. 7*3=21, subtract that from 27, I get 6. So the remainder is 6, meaning 27 isn't a multiple.

Next, B: 74. Let me see, 7*10 is 70, so 74 minus 70 is 4. So the remainder is 4, not a multiple.

C: 56. Hmm, I think this might be a multiple. Let me check: 7*8 is 56. Yes, exactly. So C is a multiple. But I should check the others to be thorough.

D: 83. 7*11 is 77, and 7*12 is 84. So 83 is between them, which means it's not a multiple. Alternatively, 83 divided by 7 is around 11.85, so not a whole number.

E: 111. Let me calculate 7*15 is 105, and 7*16 is 112. So 111 is just before 112, hence not a multiple. 111 divided by 7 is about 15.857, not a whole number.

F: 61. 7*8 is 56, 7*9 is 63. So 61 is in between, not a multiple. 61/7 ≈8.714.

G: 48. 7*6 is 42, 7*7 is 49. So 48 is close to 49 but not a multiple. 48/7 is about 6.857.

H: 102. Let me see, 7*14 is 98, 7*15 is 105. So 102 is between them. 102 divided by 7 is approximately 14.571, not a whole number.

I: 94. 7*13 is 91, 7*14 is 98. 94 is in between, so not a multiple. 94/7 ≈13.428.

J: 75. 7*10 is 70, 7*11 is 77. So 75 is between them, not a multiple. 75/7 ≈10.714.

Wait, but I thought C was correct, but let me double-check C: 56. 7 times 8 is indeed 56, so that's definitely a multiple.

So the only one that works is option C:56.

The correct answer is C: 56, as it is divisible by 7 with no remainder.

Answer: C
