Okay, so I've got this question about cognitive distortions, specifically as defined by Aaron Beck. The question is about Samuel, who just got a bonus at work but feels like he's about to be fired. I need to figure out which cognitive distortion he's exhibiting.

First, I remember that cognitive distortions are patterns of thinking that are irrational and can lead to negative emotions. Aaron Beck identified several types, and each has a specific definition.

Let me think about each option:

A: Polarized Thinking – This is when someone sees things in black and white, like all or nothing. So, maybe if someone only sees success or failure, that's polarized. But in this case, Samuel got a bonus, which is positive, but he feels like he's about to be fired. So it's not exactly seeing things as all good or all bad; more like interpreting a positive as a sign of something bad.

B: Magnification – This is when someone blows things out of proportion. Like making a small mistake into a huge problem. But here, Samuel is getting a bonus, and he's worried about being fired. It's not exactly magnifying a negative event; it's more about misinterpreting a positive.

C: Minimization – This is downplaying positive aspects. Like saying a compliment doesn't count. But Samuel isn't minimizing his bonus; he's reacting to it negatively.

D: Arbitrary Inference – This is when someone draws conclusions without evidence. Like assuming something bad will happen without any signs. That seems close because he feels like he's about to be fired despite the bonus. So maybe he's making an arbitrary inference.

E: Overgeneralization – This is taking a single event and seeing it as a never-ending pattern. For example, failing once and thinking you'll always fail. Samuel got a bonus, but does that relate to overgeneralizing? Maybe not directly.

F: Mustabatory Thinking – This is feeling like things must be a certain way, often using words like "must," "should," etc. Like feeling like he must be fired because of some reason. But the question doesn't mention him using such language.

G: Mind Reading – Assuming what others are thinking without evidence. So if he thinks his boss thinks he's going to fire him, that's mind reading. But the statement just says he feels like he's about to be fired, not necessarily what his boss thinks.

H: Selective Abstraction – Focusing only on certain details and ignoring others. Like only seeing the negative in a situation. So if he's ignoring positive signs and only focusing on possible negatives, that could fit.

I: Personalization – Believing that negative events are personal when they might not be. Like thinking a bad event is because of something he did. But in this case, he's reacting to a positive event (bonus) with a negative expectation.

Now, breaking it down. Samuel got a bonus, which is positive, but he feels like he's about to be fired. It's like he's interpreting the bonus as a sign that something bad is going to happen. That sounds like he's making an arbitrary inference because there's no clear evidence that the bonus predicts being fired. He's just assuming it without basis.

Alternatively, selective abstraction might be a possibility if he's focusing on some negative cue and ignoring the positive. But the key here is that he's linking the bonus to an impending firing without any logical connection. So arbitrary inference seems more accurate.

Wait, could it be personalization? He's making it personal, thinking the bonus means he's about to be fired. But personalization is more about negative events being because of oneself. Here, he's taking a positive and using it to predict a negative outcome.

Hmm, another angle: arbitrary inference is drawing conclusions without sufficient evidence. So he's concluding that the bonus means he's about to be fired, which is an arbitrary leap without any evidence. So yes, that fits.

I think the answer is D: arbitrary inference.

Samuel is exhibiting **arbitrary inference**, as he is drawing a conclusion that the bonus indicates he will be fired without sufficient evidence or logical basis. 

Answer: D
