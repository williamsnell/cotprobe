Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says: A source particle is executing a periodic motion defined by y = 6 sin(π t). It sends out waves that travel through a homogeneous medium at a speed of 6 cm per second. We need to find the displacement of a second particle that's 80 cm away from the source one minute after the source began to vibrate. The medium is one-dimensional, like a stretched cord.

Hmm, I remember that when a source particle vibrates, it creates waves in the medium. The displacement of a particle in the medium depends on the wave's properties and its position relative to the source.

First, let me note down the given information:

- The equation of motion for the source is y = 6 sin(π t). So the amplitude here is 6 cm, right? Because the general form is y = A sin(ωt + φ), so A is 6 cm. The angular frequency ω is π rad/s.

- The wave speed, v, is 6 cm/s. That's the speed at which the wave propagates through the medium.

- The distance from the source to the second particle is 80 cm.

- The time elapsed is one minute, which is 60 seconds.

Wait, but wait a minute. When dealing with wave propagation, the wave equation is usually something like y(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ), where k is the wave number and ω is the angular frequency. But in this case, the source is moving in simple harmonic motion, so the wave emitted would be a sinusoidal wave traveling outward.

But the medium is one-dimensional, so the wave will propagate along a line. So, the displacement of any point x at time t would be given by the wave equation.

Let me think about the wave equation. The general form for a wave traveling in the positive x-direction is y(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt). But wait, sometimes it's written as y(x, t) = A sin(ω(t - x/v)), because the wave speed v is ω/k. So, yeah, that's another way to write it.

So, given that, I can write the displacement as y(x, t) = A sin(ω t - k x), where k = 2π/λ and λ is the wavelength. Alternatively, since v = ω/k, then k = ω/v.

Wait, let me confirm that. The wave speed v is equal to ω divided by k, so v = ω/k → k = ω/v.

So, for this problem, ω is π rad/s, and v is 6 cm/s. So, k = π / 6 cm⁻¹.

Now, the source is at x=0, and the second particle is at x=80 cm. We need to find y(80 cm, 60 s).

So, plugging into the equation: y = 6 sin(π*60 - (π/6)*80).

Wait, let me compute the arguments step by step.

First, calculate ωt: π * 60 = 60π.

Next, calculate kx: (π/6) * 80 = (80π)/6 = (40π)/3 ≈ 41.8879... radians.

So the argument becomes ωt - kx = 60π - (40π/3).

Let me compute that. 60π is the same as 180π/3. So, 180π/3 - 40π/3 = 140π/3.

Wait, so sin(140π/3). Let's see, 140 divided by 3 is approximately 46.6667. Let me find 140π/3 mod 2π to find the equivalent angle within the first 2π.

Wait, but 140π/3 divided by 2π is 140/(3*2) = 140/6 ≈23.3333. So, the integer part is 23, so 23*2π = 46π. Now, subtract 46π from 140π/3.

Wait, 46π is (138π)/3. So, 140π/3 - 138π/3 = 2π/3.

So, sin(140π/3) = sin(2π/3).

What's sin(2π/3)? That's the same as sin(60 degrees), which is √3/2 ≈0.8660.

So, y = 6 * (√3/2) = 6*(0.8660) ≈5.196 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 4.8 cm, and option E is 10.6 cm, but wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the argument. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the wave equation is y(x,t) = A sin(ωt - kx). So, with A=6, ω=π, v=6 cm/s, so k=ω/v= π/6.

So, at x=80 cm and t=60 s,

Argument = ωt - kx = π*60 - (π/6)*80.

Compute each part:

π *60 =60π.

(π/6)*80 = (80π)/6 = (40π)/3 ≈41.8879.

So, 60π is 180π/3. So 180π/3 minus 40π/3 is 140π/3.

Now, 140π/3 divided by 2π is (140π/3) / (2π) = (140)/(6) = 23.3333. So the integer part is 23, so 23*2π =46π, which is 138π/3.

So, 140π/3 - 138π/3 = 2π/3.

So, sin(2π/3) is indeed √3/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So, y=6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196 cm. Looking at the options, the closest is option F:4.8 cm, but wait, 5.196 isn't exactly an option. Hmm, let me check if I made an error in the sign or calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the wave equation as y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ), depending on the direction. Wait, sometimes the wave equation is written as y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ) for a wave moving in the negative x-direction. Alternatively, for a wave moving in the positive x-direction, it's y(x,t) = A sin(ωt - kx + φ). Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say that when the wave moves in the positive x-direction, the equation is y(x,t) = A sin(ωt - kx + φ). So, perhaps I've got it right.

Wait, but let me think about this again. The general wave equation for a wave moving to the right (positive x) is y(x,t) = A sin(ωt - kx + φ). So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should check if the wave equation should be y(x,t) = A sin(ω(t - x/v)) instead. Let me see: ω(t - x/v) = ωt - ω x /v. But since k = ω/v, this becomes ωt - kx, which matches the earlier form.

So, that's correct.

Wait, but then perhaps the displacement is positive, so 5.196 cm, but looking at the options, the closest is F:4.8 cm. Hmm, but 5.196 isn't an option. Let me check the options again.

Options: A:13.3, B:9, C:80, D:5.2, E:10.6, F:4.8, G:6, H:7.5, I:3, J:0.

Wait, option D is 5.2 cm, which is very close to 5.196 cm. So, perhaps the correct answer is D:5.2 cm.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the argument.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should express the argument in terms of modulo 2π to find the equivalent angle.

So, 140π/3 = (46 * 2π) + (2π/3), because 46*2π = 92π, which is 276π/3. So, 140π/3 minus 276π/3 is negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should find how many times 2π fits into 140π/3.

Wait, 2π = 6π/3. So, 140π/3 divided by 6π/3 is 140/6 ≈23.3333. So, 23 full rotations (each 2π), so 23*6π/3=138π/3=46π.

So, 140π/3 - 46π = 140π/3 - 138π/3 = 2π/3.

So, sin(2π/3)=√3/2≈0.8660.

So, 6 * 0.8660≈5.196 cm, which is approximately 5.2 cm, which is option D.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the displacement is zero because the particle hasn't started vibrating yet. Wait, no, because the wave takes time to reach the particle. Let me check the time it takes for the wave to reach the particle at 80 cm.

The wave speed is 6 cm/s, so the time it takes for the wave to travel 80 cm is t=80/6≈13.3333 seconds. But the total time is 60 seconds, which is much larger than 13.333 seconds, so the wave has definitely reached the particle. So, the displacement isn't zero. So, option J is not correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the wave equation. Let me think again. The source is executing y=6 sin(π t). So, the wave equation would be y(x,t)=6 sin(π t - (π/6)x). Because k=π/6 cm⁻¹.

So, at x=80 cm and t=60 s, the argument is π*60 - (π/6)*80.

Which is 60π - (80π/6) = 60π - (40π/3) = (180π -40π)/3 = 140π/3.

As before, sin(140π/3)=sin(2π/3)=√3/2. So, y=6*(√3/2)=3√3≈5.196 cm, which is approximately 5.2 cm, option D.

Wait, but the options have D as 5.2 cm, which is very close. So, perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps I should consider the phase difference between the source and the particle.

The wave speed is v=6 cm/s. The time taken for the wave to reach the particle at 80 cm is t0=80/6≈13.333 s.

At t=60 s, the source has been vibrating for 60 s. The wave that reaches the particle at t=60 s was emitted at t=60 -13.333≈46.6667 s.

So, the displacement of the particle at t=60 s is the same as the displacement of the source at t=46.6667 s.

So, the source's displacement at t=46.6667 s is y=6 sin(π *46.6667).

Compute π *46.6667 ≈146.6667 radians.

Now, let's find 146.6667 mod 2π.

146.6667 / (2π) ≈146.6667 /6.2832≈23.333.

So, 23 full cycles, each 2π. So, 23*2π=144.513 radians.

Wait, wait, no: 23*2π is 46π, which is 144.513 radians. Wait, 46π is 144.513 radians?

Wait, 2π is approximately 6.2832, so 46π=46 *3.1416≈144.513.

So, 146.6667 -144.513≈2.1537 radians.

So, sin(2.1537)=sin(π - (π -2.1537))=sin(π - 1.002)=sin(1.002)≈0.842.

Wait, but wait, 2.1537 radians is about 123.4 degrees, which is in the second quadrant, so sin is positive.

But let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 2.1537 radians:

sin(2.1537) ≈ sin(2π/3) because 2π/3≈2.0944 rad, which is about 120 degrees. Wait, but 2.1537 is a bit more than that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as 2.1537 ≈ π - 1.002, so sin(2.1537)=sin(1.002)≈0.842.

So, y=6 * 0.842≈5.052 cm.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me approximately 5.196 cm, which is around 5.2 cm. So, this approach gives about 5.05 cm, which is close to 5.2 cm.

Hmm, perhaps the discrepancy is due to the approximation in the calculations. Let me see.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase approach. Because the wave reaches the particle at t=60 s, which was emitted at t=60 - 80/6 =60 -13.333=46.6667 s. So, the displacement is the same as the source's displacement at t=46.6667 s.

So, y_source(t)=6 sin(π t). So, y=6 sin(π*46.6667).

Compute π*46.6667: 46.6667 is 140/3. So, π*(140/3)=140π/3 radians.

Which is the same argument as before. So, 140π/3 mod 2π is 2π/3, so sin(2π/3)=√3/2, as before.

So, y=6*(√3/2)=3√3≈5.196 cm, which is approximately 5.2 cm, so D.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D:5.2 cm.

The problem involves a source particle executing simple harmonic motion described by \( y = 6 \sin(\pi t) \), emitting waves traveling through a medium at 6 cm/s. We need to find the displacement of a particle 80 cm from the source after 60 seconds.

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Equation**: The displacement of a particle at position \( x \) and time \( t \) is given by:
   \[
   y(x, t) = A \sin(\omega t - kx)
   \]
   where \( A = 6 \, \text{cm} \), \( \omega = \pi \, \text{rad/s} \), and \( k = \frac{\omega}{v} = \frac{\pi}{6} \, \text{cm}^{-1} \).

2. **Substitute Values**: For \( x = 80 \, \text{cm} \) and \( t = 60 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   y(80, 60) = 6 \sin\left(\pi \cdot 60 - \frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 80\right)
   \]
   Simplify the argument:
   \[
   \pi \cdot 60 = 60\pi, \quad \frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 80 = \frac{40\pi}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Argument} = 60\pi - \frac{40\pi}{3} = \frac{180\pi - 40\pi}{3} = \frac{140\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Simplify Angle**: Reduce \( \frac{140\pi}{3} \) modulo \( 2\pi \):
   \[
   \frac{140\pi}{3} \div 2\pi = \frac{140}{6} \approx 23.333 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 23 \times 2\pi = \frac{138\pi}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{140\pi}{3} - \frac{138\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Compute Sine**: \( \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \sin\left(120^\circ\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660 \).

5. **Displacement**: 
   \[
   y = 6 \times 0.8660 \approx 5.196 \, \text{cm}
   \]
   The closest option is **5.2 cm**.

### Conclusion:
The displacement of the particle is approximately **5.2 cm**, corresponding to option **D**.
