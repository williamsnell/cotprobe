Question:

Albert Attorney was a solo practitioner in Littletown who operated a general law practice. In 1990, Albert drafted a document for a client's estate plan that unfortunately violated the rule against perpetuities. Upon the testator's death in 2004, the mistake was discovered. Because of the error, the estate plan was not admitted to probate so the assets were distributed under the state intestacy statute. Gordon Greedy was named as a substantial taker under the estate plan, but did not take under the intestate statute since he was not a relative. The state statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. If Gordon sues Albert for professional malpractice in 2005, the best defense Albert can assert is

Options:

A: Albert did not intentionally make the mistake in the estate plan.
B: The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.
C: Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.
D: The error in the estate plan was due to a change in legislation.
E: The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand.
F: Albert Attorney was not practicing at the time of the testator's death.
G: Albert was not aware of the mistake until the testator's death.
H: The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.
I: Gordon Greedy was not a direct client of Albert Attorney.
J: Gordon Greedy was not a relative and therefore cannot sue for professional malpractice.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about professional malpractice. Let me break it down step by step. 

The question is about Albert Attorney, who drafted an estate plan in 1990 that violated the rule against perpetuities. The testator died in 2004, and because of that mistake, the estate plan wasn't admitted to probate. As a result, the assets were distributed according to the state's intestacy statute. Gordon Greedy was supposed to get something under the estate plan but didn't because he's not a relative and thus not a taker under intestacy. Now, Gordon is suing Albert in 2005 for professional malpractice.

We need to find the best defense Albert can use. The options are A through J.

First, I need to think about the elements of a professional malpractice claim. Generally, it involves proving that the professional (here, Albert) owed a duty of care to the client, breached that duty, and as a result caused damages.

In this case, Albert drafted a document that violated the rule against perpetuities. That's a clear breach of duty because violating that rule can invalidate parts of an estate plan. The damage here is that Gordon didn't receive what was intended, so he's suing for that loss.

Now, looking at the statute of limitations. The state's statute is three years. The mistake was discovered upon the testator's death in 2004, so the cause of action would likely start from that point. If Gordon sues in 2005, that's just one year after the discovery. Hmm, wait, but the statute of limitations is three years, so if the cause of action started in 2004, then the lawsuit in 2005 is within the three-year window. So the statute of limitations hasn't run yet. That makes option B (statute of limitations has run) not applicable because it's still within the time limit.

Wait, wait. When does the cause of action accrue in professional malpractice? Typically, it's when the plaintiff knew or should have known about the injury. Here, the mistake was discovered in 2004 when the testator died. So the clock starts ticking in 2004. The lawsuit is in 2005, so it's within three years. So B isn't the right defense because the statute hasn't run yet.

Next, looking at other options. Option I says Gordon wasn't a direct client. But in estate planning, usually, the client is the testator, not a third party like Gordon. So Albert's client was the testator, and Gordon is a beneficiary. However, in professional malpractice, the beneficiary can sometimes sue if they were intended third-party beneficiaries. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question is about who the client is. If Gordon wasn't a client, maybe he can't sue? But I think third parties can sue if they can show proximate cause and reliance, etc. So I'm not sure if I is the best defense.

Option H: The legal fee wasn't paid. I don't think that's a defense to malpractice. Non-payment of fees doesn't bar a malpractice claim; it might affect whether the attorney can recover fees in a counterclaim, but it doesn't prevent the client from suing for malpractice.

Option E: The rule is too complicated for the average lawyer. That's not a valid defense. Lawyers are expected to know the applicable laws in their practice areas. The rule against perpetuities is a fundamental concept in estates and trusts, so Albert should have known it.

Option D: The error was due to a change in legislation. If the rule against perpetuities changed after 1990, maybe that's a factor. But the rule is a common law rule, and it's well-established. Changes in legislation would be more about statutes, not common law rules. Also, if the law changed, Albert should have kept up with it as a practicing attorney.

Option A: Albert didn't intend to make the mistake. But in malpractice, intent isn't required; it's about whether the professional acted negligently. So even if Albert didn't intend, if he breached the standard of care, that's enough. So A isn't a good defense.

Option C: Gordon wasn't an eligible taker. That's about the estate plan, but the issue is whether Albert was negligent. So even if Gordon wasn't eligible, if Albert made a mistake that caused the plan to fail, that's malpractice. So C doesn't address the malpractice claim.

Option J: Gordon wasn't a relative, so he can't sue. But malpractice is about the attorney's duty to the client. If the client (testator) was harmed, which led to Gordon not getting anything, then Gordon can sue as a third party. So J isn't a valid defense.

Option F: Albert wasn't practicing at the time of death. That might be relevant to whether he had ongoing duties, but malpractice occurs at the time of the negligent act (drafting the document in 1990). So even if he wasn't practicing in 2004, the malpractice claim would still be valid as long as it's within the statute of limitations.

Wait, but the statute of limitations is three years from when the cause of action accrued. If the cause of action was in 2004, and the lawsuit is in 2005, it's within the window. So B (statute of limitations) isn't applicable because it's not too late yet.

So looking back, the best defense isn't about the statute of limitations. Let me think again. The options: which one is the best defense.

Wait, another angle: the statute of limitations. If the cause of action accrued in 2004, then the deadline is 2007 (2004 + 3). So 2005 is within the time. So B isn't the defense.

Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me check other options.

Option I: Gordon wasn't a direct client. So Albert's duty was to the testator, not Gordon. But in some cases, third parties can sue for malpractice if they're foreseeable beneficiaries and the attorney's negligence directly affects their interests. So I don't think I is a valid defense.

Wait, another point: in some jurisdictions, only the client can sue for malpractice unless the third party is a foreseeable beneficiary and the attorney owed them a duty. But I'm not sure about that. If Albert's duty was to the testator, and Gordon is suing, perhaps the correct defense is that Gordon wasn't the client, so he can't sue. That would make option I the best defense.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes third parties can sue. For example, in real estate transactions, buyers can sometimes sue the seller's attorney for malpractice if they were intended third-party beneficiaries.

Alternatively, in estate planning, the intended beneficiaries (like Gordon) might have standing to sue if the attorney's negligence directly affected their interests. So maybe I isn't the best defense.

Wait, another angle: the testator is the client. The testator died in 2004, and Gordon is suing in 2005. The testator's estate might have to bring the malpractice claim, but if the testator is deceased, perhaps the personal representative can sue. But Gordon is a third party. So if the testator's estate didn't sue, could Gordon do so?

I think in some cases, third-party beneficiaries can sue for malpractice if they were intended to be the primary beneficiaries and the attorney's negligence directly harmed their interests. So maybe I isn't the right defense here.

Hmm, perhaps the best defense is that the statute of limitations hasn't run yet, but that's not an option. Wait, no, the question is about the best defense Albert can assert. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the mistake was in 1990. The testator died in 2004, and the error was discovered then. So the cause of action would be in 2004. The statute runs for three years, so until 2007. So suing in 2005 is within time. So B isn't the defense.

So which defense is left? The options are A to J. Let's see:

Option I: Gordon wasn't a direct client. So Albert's duty was to the testator, not Gordon. So Gordon can't sue because he wasn't the client. That might be the best defense.

Alternatively, option J says Gordon wasn't a relative and can't sue. But that's about intestacy, not about whether he can sue for malpractice. He can sue for malpractice regardless of being a relative.

So perhaps I is the correct answer: Gordon wasn't a direct client, so he can't sue Albert for malpractice. Because the duty was to the testator, not Gordon.

Wait, but in some cases, third parties can sue. For example, if the estate plan was intended to benefit Gordon, and Albert's negligence caused Gordon to lose that benefit, Gordon might have standing. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the testator's estate would be the one to sue, but if the testator's estate didn't sue, perhaps Gordon can't. But the question says Gordon is suing, so maybe I is the correct defense.

Alternatively, maybe the defense is that the statute of limitations hasn't run yet, but that's not the case because the lawsuit is within the three-year period.

Wait, another thought: when does the statute of limitations start? If the testator died in 2004, and the mistake was discovered then, the cause of action starts in 2004. So the statute runs until 2007. So in 2005, it's within time. So B isn't the defense.

So going back, the best defense is that Gordon wasn't a direct client, so I is the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Another angle: the duty in professional malpractice is to the client, so if Gordon wasn't the client, he can't sue. So I think I is the best defense.

The question revolves around whether Gordon Greedy can successfully sue Albert Attorney for professional malpractice due to a drafting error in an estate plan that violated the rule against perpetuities. The key issue is identifying the best defense Albert can assert.

1. **Statute of Limitations (Option B):** The statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. The cause of action likely accrued in 2004 when the testator's death revealed the drafting error. Since Gordon sues in 2005, the claim is within the three-year window, making this defense inapplicable.

2. **Client Relationship (Option I):** Albert's duty was to the testator, not Gordon. While third parties like intended beneficiaries may sometimes sue for malpractice, the primary duty is to the client (the testator). If the testator's estate did not pursue the claim, Gordon's ability to sue as a third party is questionable. This makes Option I a strong defense.

3. **Other Options:** 
   - **A, D, E, F, G, H, J:** These options either do not address the core issue of professional malpractice or are factually irrelevant. For example, intent (A), legislative changes (D), and payment status (H) are not valid defenses to malpractice.

The best defense is that Gordon was not a direct client, as Albert's duty was to the testator. This makes Option I the strongest defense.

Answer: I
