Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about Warner and Myrdal's claim regarding black former slaves not joining the 'ethnic melting pot' of North American cities. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the 'ethnic melting pot' refers to the idea that different ethnic groups blend together into a homogeneous society. So the question is asking why, according to Warner and Myrdal, black former slaves didn't join this melting pot in Northern cities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The cities didn't offer advantages over the South. Hmm, I think during the Great Migration, many blacks moved north for better economic opportunities. So if the cities didn't offer advantages, maybe they wouldn't come. But I'm not sure if that's the main reason Warner and Myrdal cited.

Option B: Whites didn't believe in liberty, equality, and democracy. That seems a bit broad. While discrimination was a problem, I'm not sure if this was the specific reason they gave for not joining the melting pot.

Option C: They weren't physically capable. That doesn't make sense. There's no reason to think they were physically incapable of moving.

Option D: Government didn't allow them to join. This could relate to legal barriers, like segregation laws or Jim Crow. But I think the issue was more about social and economic factors rather than explicit government prohibition.

Option E: They wanted to retain their ethnic identity. This seems plausible. Maybe they chose to maintain their culture rather than blend in completely.

Option F: Not prepared to leave the South. That's possible, but the question is about why they didn't join the melting pot once they were in the North. So this might not be the best fit.

Option G: Not economically capable. Economic barriers could prevent migration, but again, the question is about not joining the melting pot after moving, so maybe not the main reason.

Option H: Promise of citizenship contradicted by discrimination. This seems related. Even if they had citizenship, they faced discrimination, which might have discouraged them from fully integrating.

Option I: Afraid of losing cultural heritage. Similar to E, but more about fear rather than a desire to retain identity.

Now, I recall that Warner and Myrdal discussed the concept of the "melting pot" and how it didn't apply to African Americans. They pointed out that despite the opportunities in the North, blacks were not fully integrated because of ongoing discrimination and a lack of acceptance. This suggests that the reason wasn't about their own desire to retain identity but more about the social structures preventing their inclusion.

Looking back, option H says the promise of citizenship was contradicted by continued discrimination. That aligns with the idea that even though they were in the North, they weren't truly part of the melting pot because of the systemic issues. Alternatively, option E is about retaining their identity, which might be more about their choice, whereas H is about the external factors preventing them from joining despite the opportunity.

Wait, but the question is why they weren't joining the melting pot. So it's about their actions or the reasons behind their not participating. If the melting pot was supposed to blend everyone, but they weren't blending, why? Was it because they chose to keep their identity (E) or because they were excluded despite wanting to join (H)?

I think Warner and Myrdal focused on the failure of the melting pot to integrate blacks due to persistent discrimination, not because blacks didn't want to join. So the issue wasn't their desire to retain identity but the reality of ongoing discrimination. So H might be the answer.

Alternatively, some sources say that they didn't join because of economic reasons or other barriers, but I'm not sure. Another angle: the melting pot idea in the North was supposed to be more accepting, but if blacks were still facing discrimination, they couldn't join, making H correct.

So, after considering, I think the correct answer is H: the promise of citizenship was contradicted by continued discrimination.
