Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about employment obligations. The question is asking about what obligations workers have towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read the question again carefully. It says, "______ are the obligations of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws." So, we're looking for a term that describes what workers (employees) must do according to their contracts and the laws.

Looking at the options:

A: Employer obligations - Hmm, this is about what the employer must do, not the employees. So probably not this one.

B: Employment laws - These are the laws that regulate employment, but the question is specifically about the obligations of workers, so maybe not directly this.

C: Employer benefits - Benefits are what employers provide to employees, not what employees have to do. So not this.

D: Employer duties - Similar to A, this is about the employer's responsibilities, not the employees'.

E: Employee rights - Rights are what employees are entitled to, not what they must do. So this might not be it.

F: Employer rights - Again, this is about the employer's perspective, so not the right choice.

G: Employee duties - This seems closer. Duties refer to what employees must do. So this could be the answer.

H: Employee benefits - Same as C, these are what the employer provides, not what employees must do.

I: Employee contracts - Contracts outline the terms between employer and employee, but the question is about the obligations themselves, not the contracts.

So, putting it together, the obligations of workers towards their employer would be their duties. Therefore, the correct answer should be G: Employee duties.
