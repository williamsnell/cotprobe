Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the x value of the solutions to a linear system. The system is given by two equations:

1. 7x - y = 15x
2. -6x + 8y = 15y

And I have to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the first equation: 7x - y = 15x. Hmm, I think I can simplify this. Let me subtract 7x from both sides to get the y term by itself. So, subtracting 7x gives me:

7x - y - 7x = 15x - 7x

Simplifying both sides, the 7x and -7x on the left cancel out, leaving -y. On the right, 15x -7x is 8x. So now the equation is:

-y = 8x

I can multiply both sides by -1 to solve for y. That gives me:

y = -8x

Okay, so from the first equation, I have y expressed in terms of x. Now, let's move on to the second equation: -6x + 8y = 15y.

I think I can substitute the expression for y I found into this equation. Since y is -8x, I'll plug that into wherever y is in the second equation.

So, substituting y = -8x into the second equation:

-6x + 8*(-8x) = 15*(-8x)

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, calculate 8*(-8x): that's -64x.

Then, 15*(-8x) is -120x.

So now the equation becomes:

-6x + (-64x) = -120x

Combine the terms on the left side:

-6x -64x is -70x.

So now the equation is:

-70x = -120x

Hmm, let's see. I'll add 120x to both sides to get all x terms on one side.

-70x + 120x = -120x + 120x

Simplifying, that's:

50x = 0

Wait, so 50x equals zero. Then, dividing both sides by 50, I get x = 0.

Wait, but looking back at the options, G is 0. So that would be the answer, right? But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with the first equation: 7x - y =15x. Subtract 7x: -y=8x → y=-8x. That seems correct.

Second equation: -6x +8y=15y. Substitute y=-8x:

-6x +8*(-8x)=15*(-8x)

Which is -6x -64x = -120x → -70x = -120x → adding 120x: 50x=0 → x=0.

Yes, that seems right. So x is 0, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check if this makes sense. If x is 0, then from y=-8x, y would be 0 too. So plugging x=0 and y=0 into both equations.

First equation: 7(0) - 0 = 15(0) → 0=0, which works.

Second equation: -6(0) +8(0) =15(0) → 0=0, also works. So both equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the x value is 0, which is option G.

The solution to the system is x = 0.
