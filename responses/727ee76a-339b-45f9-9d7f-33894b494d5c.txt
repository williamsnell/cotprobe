Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what the simplest form of 27 over 36 is. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that simplifying a fraction means dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, or GCD. So, I need to find the GCD of 27 and 36. 

Hmm, 27 is a number that I know is 3 cubed, so 3×3×3. And 36, I think is 6 squared, which is 6×6, but let me break it down further. 36 can be divided by 2 first: 2×18, then 18 is 2×9, and 9 is 3×3. So, 36 is 2×2×3×3. 

Now, looking at the prime factors of both numbers: 27 is 3×3×3, and 36 is 2×2×3×3. The common factors are the 3s. So, how many 3s do they have in common? Well, 27 has three 3s, and 36 has two 3s. The minimum is two, so the GCD is 3×3, which is 9.

Wait, no, that's not right. The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common primes. So, both have 3 as a common prime factor, and the lowest power is 3^2, which is 9. So, the GCD is 9.

Now, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9. 

27 divided by 9 is 3, and 36 divided by 9 is 4. So, the simplified fraction is 3 over 4. 

Looking at the options, option I is 3/4, so that must be the answer. 

Wait, let me double-check. Did I correctly identify the GCD? Let me see. 27 and 36. Another way to find the GCD is to list the factors. Factors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, 27. Factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. The common factors are 1, 3, 9. The largest is 9, so yes, GCD is 9. 

Dividing both by 9: 27 ÷9=3, 36 ÷9=4. So, yes, 3/4 is correct. So the answer should be option I.

The fraction 27/36 simplifies by dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCD, which is 9. This results in 3/4.
