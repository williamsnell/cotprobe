Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because electromagnetism can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the electric and magnetic fields E and B at a point given the forces on a test charge for three different velocities. Hmm, right, I remember that the Lorentz force law is F = q(E + v × B). So each force F given must be equal to q times (E + v × B). Let's break it down.

The problem gives three scenarios with different velocities and corresponding forces. Each F is expressed in terms of E0, B0, and v0. The velocities are along the i_x, i_y, and i_z directions respectively. I'll need to write equations for each case and solve for E and B.

Let me write down each case:

Case 1: v1 = v0 i_x
F1 = q [ E0 i_x + (E0 - v0 B0) i_y ]

Case 2: v2 = v0 i_y
F2 = q [ (E0 + v0 B0) i_x + E0 i_y ]

Case 3: v3 = v0 i_z
F3 = q [ E0 i_x + E0 i_y ]

Wait, for Case 3, the velocity is along i_z, so v × B in that case will involve the cross product of i_z and B. But the force F3 doesn't have any terms beyond i_x and i_y, which suggests that the z-component of v × B must be zero, but maybe that's not directly relevant. Let me think.

Since F = q(E + v × B), I can write each F as q times (E + v cross B), then divide by q to get E + v × B. Let me set up the equations for each case.

Starting with Case 1: v1 = v0 i_x
So, v × B is v0 i_x × B. Let me denote B as Bx i_x + By i_y + Bz i_z.
Wait, but wait, the problem states that E and B are constants at the point, so B has components in x, y, z directions. Let me represent B as Bx i_x + By i_y + Bz i_z.

So, v × B = v0 i_x × (Bx i_x + By i_y + Bz i_z)
The cross product i_x × i_x = 0, i_x × i_y = i_z, and i_x × i_z = -i_y.

So v × B = v0 (0 + By i_z - Bz i_y) = v0 ( By i_z - Bz i_y )

Wait, wait, no, because cross product is anti-commutative. Let me compute that again.

Wait, i_x × i_y = i_z, so By i_y cross i_x would be -i_z. Wait no, no, wait: cross product of i_x × i_y = i_z, so when you have i_x × By i_y, it's By (i_x × i_y) = By i_z.

Similarly, i_x × Bz i_z = Bz (i_x × i_z) = Bz (-i_y) because i_x × i_z is -i_y.

So v × B = v0 [ By i_z - Bz i_y ]

So the Lorentz force for Case 1 is F1 = q (E + v × B) = q [ E + (v0 By i_z - v0 Bz i_y) ]

But F1 is given as q [ E0 i_x + (E0 - v0 B0) i_y ]

Wait, wait, the given F1 is q[ E0 i_x + (E0 - v0 B0) i_y ]

Wait, but according to Lorentz, F = q (E + v × B )

So let's equate the components:

E_x + v0 (By) (because v × B has a z-component which in the equation would be E_z + v0 By). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the components of F would be q*(E_x + v × B_x, E_y + v × B_y, E_z + v × B_z).

Wait no, no. Let me re-express.

Wait, F = q (E + v × B )

So, F_x = q (E_x + (v × B)_x )
Similarly for F_y and F_z.

In Case 1, v is along i_x, so v = v0 i_x.

So, v × B is (v0 i_x) × (Bx i_x + By i_y + Bz i_z )

Which is v0 (i_x × Bx i_x) + v0 (i_x × By i_y) + v0 (i_x × Bz i_z )

i_x × i_x = 0, so first term is 0.

i_x × i_y = i_z, so second term is v0 By i_z.

i_x × i_z = -i_y, so third term is v0 Bz (-i_y) = -v0 Bz i_y.

So v × B = v0 By i_z - v0 Bz i_y.

So, the components:

(v × B)_x = 0
(v × B)_y = -v0 Bz
(v × B)_z = v0 By

Now, E is E = Ex i_x + Ey i_y + Ez i_z.

So, F = q (E + v × B ) becomes:

F_x = q (Ex + (v × B)_x ) = q Ex, since (v × B)_x is 0.

F_y = q (Ey + (v × B)_y ) = q (Ey - v0 Bz )

F_z = q (Ez + (v × B)_z ) = q (Ez + v0 By )

Now, looking back at F1: F1 = q [ E0 i_x + (E0 - v0 B0) i_y ]

Which means F1_x = q E0, F1_y = q (E0 - v0 B0), F1_z = 0.

So, from F1:

F1_x = q Ex → q Ex = q E0 → Ex = E0.

F1_y = q (Ey - v0 Bz ) → q (Ey - v0 Bz ) = q (E0 - v0 B0 )

So, Ey - v0 Bz = E0 - v0 B0 → Ey = E0 - v0 B0 + v0 Bz → Ey = E0 + v0 ( Bz - B0 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure about B0 yet. Wait, B0 is given as a constant in the problem, but perhaps it's the magnitude of B? Or maybe a component. Wait, the problem says "E_0, B_0 are constants." So perhaps B0 is a component. Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

Also, F1_z is zero → F1_z = q (Ez + v0 By ) = 0 → Ez + v0 By = 0 → Ez = -v0 By.

So from F1, we have:

Ex = E0,

Ey = E0 + v0 (Bz - B0),

Ez = -v0 By.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because F1_z is zero, so Ez + v0 By = 0 → Ez = -v0 By.

Now, moving to Case 2: v2 = v0 i_y.

So, v = v0 i_y.

v × B = (v0 i_y) × (Bx i_x + By i_y + Bz i_z )

= v0 (i_y × Bx i_x + i_y × By i_y + i_y × Bz i_z )

i_y × i_x = -i_z → because i_x × i_y = i_z, so i_y × i_x = -i_z.

i_y × i_y = 0.

i_y × i_z = i_x.

So,

v × B = v0 [ Bx (-i_z) + Bz i_x ]

= v0 ( -Bx i_z + Bz i_x )

So, the components:

(v × B)_x = v0 Bz,

(v × B)_y = 0,

(v × B)_z = -v0 Bx.

Now, F2 = q (E + v × B )

So,

F2_x = q ( Ex + v0 Bz )

F2_y = q ( Ey + 0 ) = q Ey,

F2_z = q ( Ez - v0 Bx )

But F2 is given as q [ (E0 + v0 B0) i_x + E0 i_y ]

So, F2_x = q (E0 + v0 B0 ), F2_y = q E0, F2_z = 0.

So:

From F2_x: q (Ex + v0 Bz ) = q (E0 + v0 B0 )

→ Ex + v0 Bz = E0 + v0 B0.

We know from Case 1 that Ex = E0, so:

E0 + v0 Bz = E0 + v0 B0 → v0 Bz = v0 B0 → Bz = B0.

That's a useful relation.

From F2_y: q Ey = q E0 → Ey = E0.

So now, from Case 1, Ey = E0 + v0 (Bz - B0 )

But since Bz = B0,

Ey = E0 + v0 (B0 - B0 ) → Ey = E0.

So, now, we have Ex = E0, Ey = E0, Bz = B0.

Now, from F1_z: Ez = -v0 By.

From F2_z: Ez - v0 Bx = 0 → Ez = v0 Bx.

Wait, but according to F2_z, F2_z is zero → q (Ez - v0 Bx ) = 0 → Ez = v0 Bx.

But from F1_z: Ez = -v0 By → So,

v0 Bx = -v0 By → Bx = - By.

Hmm, so Bx = - By.

Now, let's move to Case 3: v3 = v0 i_z.

v = v0 i_z.

v × B = (v0 i_z) × (Bx i_x + By i_y + Bz i_z )

= v0 [ i_z × Bx i_x + i_z × By i_y + i_z × Bz i_z ]

i_z × i_x = i_y (since i_z × i_x = i_y, because the right-hand rule: i_z cross i_x is i_y).

i_z × i_y = -i_x.

i_z × i_z =0.

So,

v × B = v0 [ Bx i_y - By i_x + 0 ]

= v0 ( Bx i_y - By i_x )

So, the components:

(v × B)_x = - v0 By,

(v × B)_y = v0 Bx,

(v × B)_z = 0.

Now, F3 = q ( E + v × B )

So,

F3_x = q ( Ex + (-v0 By) )

F3_y = q ( Ey + v0 Bx )

F3_z = q ( Ez + 0 ) = q Ez.

But F3 is given as q ( E0 i_x + E0 i_y ), so F3_x = q E0, F3_y = q E0, F3_z = 0.

So,

From F3_x: Ex - v0 By = E0.

But Ex is E0, so:

E0 - v0 By = E0 → -v0 By = 0 → By = 0.

Wait, that's a big conclusion. So By must be zero.

From earlier, Bz = B0,

And Bx = - By → since By = 0, Bx = 0.

So, Bx=0, By=0, Bz = B0.

So, B = B0 i_z.

Wait, that's a big simplification. So B is along the z-axis, B = B0 i_z.

Now, let's check what we have so far.

E has components:

Ex = E0,

Ey = E0,

Ez = - v0 By.

But By is zero, so Ez = 0.

So, E = E0 i_x + E0 i_y + 0 i_z → E = E0 (i_x + i_y).

Wait, but let me check this because I may have made an error.

Wait, from F1_z: Ez = -v0 By. But By is zero, so Ez = 0.

So E is E0 i_x + E0 i_y.

So E is E0 (i_x + i_y), B is B0 i_z.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: E= E0 (i_x +i_y), B= B0i_z → This would seem correct.

Option F: E= E0 (i_x +i_y), B= -B0i_z → B is negative, but we found Bz = B0, so B is positive in z.

Option G: E= E0 (i_x -i_y), B= B0i_z → E's y component would be negative, but we have Ey = E0.

So Option A is matching.

Wait, but let me verify with all three cases to make sure.

Let me recheck each case with E = E0 (i_x + i_y) and B = B0 i_z.

Case 1: v1 = v0 i_x.

v × B = v0 i_x × B0 i_z = v0 (i_x × i_z) = v0 (-i_y).

So,

F = q ( E + v × B )

= q [ E0 i_x + E0 i_y - v0 B0 i_y ]

= q [ E0 i_x + (E0 - v0 B0) i_y ]

Which matches F1 given.

Case 2: v2 = v0 i_y.

v × B = v0 i_y × B0 i_z = v0 (i_y × i_z) = v0 i_x.

So,

F = q [ E0 i_x + E0 i_y + v0 B0 i_x ]

= q [ (E0 + v0 B0) i_x + E0 i_y ]

Which matches F2.

Case3: v3 = v0 i_z.

v × B = v0 i_z × B0 i_z = 0 → since cross product of same vectors is zero.

So,

F = q ( E + 0 ) = q (E0 i_x + E0 i_y ), which matches F3.

Yes, so all cases are satisfied.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is option A: E= E0 (i_x +i_y), B= B0i_z.

The problem involves determining the electric field **E** and magnetic field **B** at a point given the forces on a test charge for three different velocities. The Lorentz force law, **F = q(E + v × B)**, is used to analyze each case. By equating the given forces to the Lorentz force expression and solving the resulting equations, the components of **E** and **B** are determined.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Case 1**: For **v₁ = v₀ iₓ**, the force is **F₁ = q[E₀ iₓ + (E₀ - v₀ B₀) iᵧ]**. Using the Lorentz force expression, the components of **E** and **B** are derived:
   - **Ex = E₀**
   - **Ey = E₀ + v₀ (Bz - B₀)**
   - **Ez = -v₀ By**
   - **Bz = B₀** (from matching terms).

2. **Case 2**: For **v₂ = v₀ iᵧ**, the force is **F₂ = q[(E₀ + v₀ B₀) iₓ + E₀ iᵧ]**. Solving for **E** and **B**:
   - **Ex = E₀**
   - **Ey = E₀**
   - **Bz = B₀**
   - **Bx = -By** (from matching terms).

3. **Case 3**: For **v₃ = v₀ i_z**, the force is **F₃ = q[E₀ iₓ + E₀ iᵧ]**. This implies:
   - **By = 0** (since **Ez = 0** and **Bz = B₀**).

### Final Results:
From the analysis:
- **E = E₀ (iₓ + iᵧ)**
- **B = B₀ i_z**

### Option Matching:
The correct option is **A: E = E₀ (iₓ + iᵧ), B = B₀ i_z**, as it satisfies all three cases.

**Answer:**
A
