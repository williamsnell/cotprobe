Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the internal efficiency and reheat factor for a three-stage turbine. Hmm, I remember that turbines are devices that expand steam and produce work, right? But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas and concepts. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the turbine operates between an initial pressure of 100 psia with saturated steam and a final pressure of 1 psia. The approach velocity is negligible, and each stage has an efficiency of 65%. The process is isentropic, so I guess I'll be dealing with ideal processes here.

First, I need to recall what internal efficiency and reheat factor mean. Internal efficiency (η) is the ratio of the actual work done by the turbine to the ideal work (isentropic work). So, η = actual work / isentropic work.

Reheat factor is a bit trickier. I think it's related to the temperature changes during the expansion. It accounts for the fact that in a multi-stage turbine, the steam might reheat or undergo other processes that affect the work output. The reheat factor (R) is usually the ratio of the actual enthalpy drop to the isentropic enthalpy drop over the same pressure range.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify. The reheat factor is actually the ratio of the actual heat drop (or enthalpy drop) to the isentropic heat drop. But wait, isn't the reheat factor used in the context of steam expanding in a turbine where the steam might reheat, increasing the enthalpy drop beyond what isentropic expansion would predict? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, I remember that when steam undergoes reheat, the enthalpy drop per stage is higher than the isentropic drop because some heat is added (reheating) which increases the enthalpy. So the reheat factor would make the actual enthalpy drop higher than the isentropic drop. But in this problem, it's stated that the process is isentropic, so maybe the reheat factor comes into play differently.

Wait, no, the process is isentropic, so reheat factor wouldn't apply here because reheat implies an increase in temperature due to heat addition, which isn't happening in an isentropic process. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is a factor that adjusts the isentropic efficiency when considering multi-stage expansion. I think I need to look up the formula for reheat factor. Oh wait, but in this problem, since the process is isentropic, maybe the reheat factor is just 1.0? Or perhaps it's calculated based on the actual work and isentropic work.

Wait, no. Let me approach this differently. The turbine has three stages. Each stage has a pressure ratio. The initial pressure is 100 psia, final is 1 psia. So the overall pressure ratio is 100:1. But since it's three stages, each stage's pressure ratio would be the cube root of 100, but wait, no, because each stage's pressure ratio depends on the number of stages. Alternatively, each stage might have a pressure ratio of (100/1)^(1/3) ≈ 4.64. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the stages' pressure ratios might be designed for optimal efficiency.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the isentropic enthalpy drop for each stage. Let me think: for an isentropic process, the work done per stage is the change in enthalpy. So, for each stage, the actual work would be the isentropic work multiplied by the stage efficiency.

But wait, the problem says the stage efficiency is 65%, so each stage's actual work is 0.65 times the isentropic work for that stage. Since it's a three-stage turbine, I'd have to compute the total actual work and compare it to the total isentropic work to find the internal efficiency.

Wait, internal efficiency is the ratio of the actual total work to the isentropic total work. So, η_internal = (sum of actual work per stage) / (sum of isentropic work per stage).

But wait, each stage's isentropic work would be based on the pressure ratio of that stage. Alternatively, maybe each stage is designed with the same pressure ratio. So for three stages, the overall pressure ratio is 100:1, so each stage's pressure ratio would be (100)^(1/3) ≈ 4.6416. Let me check that: 4.6416^3 ≈ 100, yes.

So each stage's pressure ratio (r) is about 4.6416. Now, for each stage, the isentropic work (w_i) would be the enthalpy drop across that stage, which is h1 - h2s, where h2s is the isentropic exit enthalpy. But wait, actually, I need to compute the specific enthalpy change for each stage.

But since the turbine is isentropic, the actual process is isentropic, so maybe each stage's process is isentropic, and the actual work is the isentropic work multiplied by the stage efficiency. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, no. The stage efficiency is the ratio of the actual work to the isentropic work for that stage. So for each stage, η_stage = w_actual / w_isentropic. So w_actual = η_stage * w_isentropic.

Since there are three identical stages, each with the same pressure ratio and thus same isentropic work, the total actual work would be 3 * (η_stage * w_isentropic). The total isentropic work would be 3 * w_isentropic. So the internal efficiency η_internal would be (3 * η_stage * w_isentropic) / (3 * w_isentropic) ) = η_stage, which is 65%. But that can't be right because the options don't have 0.65 as the internal efficiency except for option C, but option C's reheat factor is 1.675, which seems high.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding internal efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps internal efficiency isn't just the stage efficiency but considers the effect of multiple stages, possibly including reheat factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the internal efficiency is calculated differently when considering the reheat factor. Let me think about the reheat factor (R). The reheat factor is defined as R = (h1 - h2_act) / (h1 - h2s), where h2_act is the actual exit enthalpy after expansion. But wait, in an isentropic process, h2s is the exit enthalpy. So if the process is isentropic, the actual exit enthalpy would be the same as the isentropic exit enthalpy, so R would be 1. But that's not the case here because each stage has a certain efficiency.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up internal and external efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is the ratio of the actual heat drop to the isentropic heat drop over the same pressure range. So, R = (h1 - h2_act) / (h1 - h2s). But if the process is isentropic, then h2_act = h2s, so R would be zero, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is used when the steam reheats, causing the enthalpy to increase, thus increasing the enthalpy drop beyond what isentropic expansion would give. But in this problem, the process is isentropic, so reheat wouldn't occur. So maybe the reheat factor is 1.0.

Wait, but the options include a reheat factor, so I must be missing something. Let me try to approach this differently.

The formula for internal efficiency (η) for a multi-stage turbine is given by η = (1 - (v1 * Vmech * (1 - η_stage)) / (h1 - h2s)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the actual work and the isentropic work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the isentropic enthalpy drop for the entire turbine and then compute the actual enthalpy drop considering each stage's efficiency, then find the internal efficiency as the ratio.

Let me try that. The initial state is 100 psia, saturated steam. Let me find the specific enthalpy at 100 psia, saturated steam. From steam tables, at 100 psia, the saturation temperature is around 328.9 °F. The specific enthalpy h1 is 1137.5 BTU/lb.

The final pressure is 1 psia. For saturated steam at 1 psia, the temperature is around 358.2 °F, and the specific enthalpy h2s (isentropic) would be approximately 1137.5 - (v1 * Vmech * (1 - η_stage)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the isentropic enthalpy at 1 psia when expanding from 100 psia.

Wait, no. For an isentropic expansion from 100 psia to 1 psia, the specific enthalpy at the exit would be h2s. So the isentropic enthalpy drop is h1 - h2s.

To find h2s, I can use the steam tables. Let me look up the enthalpy at 1 psia. At 1 psia, the saturation temperature is about 358.2 °F. The specific volume of saturated steam at 1 psia is approximately 177.2 ft³/lb.

Wait, but for isentropic expansion, the entropy remains constant. So the entropy at 100 psia, saturated steam is s1 = s_g(100 psia). From the steam tables, s_g at 100 psia is about 1.5377 BTU/lb·R.

At 1 psia, the entropy of saturated steam is s_g(1 psia) ≈ 7.3595 BTU/lb·R. Wait, that's higher than s1, which is 1.5377. That can't be right because entropy should increase with expansion. Wait, no, wait: when steam expands isentropically, the entropy remains constant, so we need to find the state at 1 psia where the entropy equals s1.

Wait, no. Wait, s1 is the entropy at 100 psia, saturated steam, which is s1 = 1.5377 BTU/lb·R. At 1 psia, the entropy of saturated steam is much higher, but for an isentropic expansion, the final state at 1 psia would have the same entropy as the initial state, so it would be a superheated vapor.

So I need to find the specific enthalpy h2s at 1 psia and s = 1.5377 BTU/lb·R.

Looking at the steam tables for 1 psia:

At 1 psia, the saturation temperature is about 358.2 °F. The entropy of saturated liquid (s_f) is 1.4001 BTU/lb·R, and s_g is 7.3595 BTU/lb·R. Since s1 = 1.5377 is between s_f and s_g, the state at 1 psia and s=1.5377 is a two-phase mixture. Wait, that can't be right because entropy increased, but wait, no: when you expand steam isentropically from a higher pressure to a lower pressure, the entropy remains the same, but if the initial entropy is lower than the saturation entropy at the lower pressure, then the final state is a two-phase mixture. Wait, no, in this case, s1 = 1.5377 is greater than s_f at 1 psia (1.4001), so the state is a mixture.

But wait, that's confusing because I thought when you expand isentropically from a higher pressure, if the entropy is lower than the saturation entropy at the lower pressure, you get a two-phase mixture. But here, s1 is higher than s_f at 1 psia, so maybe it's superheated vapor.

Wait, let me double-check. At 100 psia, the entropy is s1 = 1.5377. At 1 psia, the entropy of saturated steam is s_g = 7.3595, which is higher than s1. So if we expand isentropically to 1 psia, the entropy remains 1.5377, which is less than s_g at 1 psia. Therefore, the final state must be a two-phase mixture.

Wait, but that's not possible because when you expand isentropically, you can't have a lower entropy than the saturation entropy at the lower pressure. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I should instead consider that the isentropic expansion from 100 psia to 1 psia would result in a state where s = 1.5377 at 1 psia.

So looking at the steam tables for 1 psia, I can find the enthalpy h where s = 1.5377.

From the steam tables at 1 psia:

- At 358.2 °F (saturation temperature), s_f = 1.4001, s_g = 7.3595.
- The specific entropy s = 1.5377 is between s_f and s_g, so it's a two-phase mixture.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you expand isentropically from a higher pressure, the entropy remains the same. So if the initial s is 1.5377, and at 1 psia, s_f = 1.4001 and s_g = 7.3595, then s = 1.5377 is within the two-phase region. So the final state is a mixture of liquid and vapor.

So the specific enthalpy h2s would be the saturated enthalpy at 1 psia, which is h_g = 1137.5 BTU/lb (wait, but that's the same as the initial h1? That can't be right because expansion should result in lower enthalpy.)

Wait, no. At 100 psia, h1 is 1137.5 BTU/lb (saturated steam). At 1 psia, h_g is about 1137.5 BTU/lb as well. Wait, that can't be correct because the enthalpy should decrease as pressure decreases during expansion.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong values. Let me check the steam tables more carefully.

At 100 psia, the saturated steam (quality 1) has h1 = 1137.5 BTU/lb, s1 = 1.5377 BTU/lb·R.

At 1 psia, the saturation temperature is 358.2 °F. The saturated liquid (quality 0) has h_f = 197.5 BTU/lb, s_f = 1.4001 BTU/lb·R. Saturated vapor (quality 1) has h_g = 1137.5 BTU/lb, s_g = 7.3595 BTU/lb·R.

Wait, so at 1 psia, h_g is 1137.5 BTU/lb, same as at 100 psia. That seems odd, but I think that's correct because at lower pressures, the enthalpy of the saturated vapor can be similar or even higher, depending on the pressure.

But in this case, when we expand isentropically from 100 psia to 1 psia, the entropy remains s1 = 1.5377 BTU/lb·R. Since s1 is between s_f and s_g at 1 psia, the final state is a two-phase mixture. So the specific enthalpy h2s is given by:

h2s = h_f + x * h_fg,

where x is the quality, given by:

x = (s - s_f) / (s_g - s_f)

Plugging in the numbers:

x = (1.5377 - 1.4001) / (7.3595 - 1.4001) = (0.1376) / (5.9594) ≈ 0.0231.

So h2s = 197.5 + 0.0231 * (1137.5 - 197.5) = 197.5 + 0.0231 * 940 ≈ 197.5 + 21.81 ≈ 219.31 BTU/lb.

Wait, that's a significant drop from h1 = 1137.5 to h2s ≈ 219.31 BTU/lb. So the isentropic enthalpy drop is Δh_isen = h1 - h2s ≈ 1137.5 - 219.31 ≈ 918.19 BTU/lb.

Now, each of the three turbine stages would have an equal isentropic enthalpy drop. So each stage's isentropic enthalpy drop would be Δh_stage_isen = 918.19 / 3 ≈ 306.06 BTU/lb.

The actual work done per stage would be w_actual = η_stage * Δh_stage_isen = 0.65 * 306.06 ≈ 198.94 BTU/lb.

So the total actual work for three stages is 3 * 198.94 ≈ 596.82 BTU/lb.

The total isentropic work would be 3 * 306.06 ≈ 918.19 BTU/lb.

Therefore, the internal efficiency η_internal = actual work / isentropic work = 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65. Wait, that's the same as the stage efficiency, which is 65%. But looking at the options, option C has efficiency 0.65 and reheat factor 1.675. But I'm not sure about the reheat factor yet.

Wait, but the problem states that the process is isentropic, so reheat shouldn't be a factor here. So maybe the reheat factor is 1.0, but option B has efficiency 0.70 and reheat 1.00, which doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the internal efficiency.

Alternatively, perhaps the internal efficiency is calculated differently. Wait, internal efficiency is the actual work output divided by the isentropic work output. So as I calculated, it's 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65, so 65%. That would align with option C, but option C's reheat factor is 1.675, which seems high.

Wait, but earlier I thought the reheat factor is 1.0 because the process is isentropic, but maybe I'm missing something about how reheat factor is calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is the ratio of the actual heat drop to the isentropic heat drop across all stages.

Wait, the actual heat drop would be the same as the actual work done, which is 596.82 BTU/lb. The isentropic heat drop is 918.19 BTU/lb. So the reheat factor R = (h1 - h2_act) / (h1 - h2s) = (h1 - h2_act) / 918.19.

But wait, in an isentropic process, h2_act = h2s, so R would be zero, which doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is used in a different context, like when the steam is reheated in a boiler, but in this problem, it's just a turbine expansion.

Wait, maybe the reheat factor isn't applicable here because the process is isentropic, and the answer would have a reheat factor of 1.00, but looking at the options, option B has efficiency 0.70 and R=1.00, which doesn't match my calculation of 0.65 efficiency.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the internal efficiency. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the internal efficiency is not the same as the stage efficiency when considering multiple stages. I think I need to use the formula for internal efficiency in a multi-stage turbine. The formula is η_internal = η_stage * (1 + (1 - η_stage) * (r^v - 1) / (r^v * η_stage)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the actual enthalpy drop and compare it to the isentropic drop.

Wait, another approach: the actual work per stage is w_actual = η_stage * (h1_stage - h2s_stage), where h1_stage is the initial enthalpy for that stage, and h2s_stage is the isentropic exit enthalpy for that stage.

But in a three-stage turbine, each stage's initial enthalpy is the exit enthalpy of the previous stage. So for stage 1, h1_1 = 1137.5, h2s_1 = h1_1 - w_isen_1 / η_stage.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model each stage's actual enthalpy drop.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall internal efficiency can be found using the formula:

η_internal = (1 - (1 - η_stage) * (r^v - 1)) / (1 - (r^v - 1)),

where r^v is the vane row ratio, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the actual work per stage and sum them up.

Wait, maybe I should compute the actual enthalpy drop for each stage. For each stage, the actual enthalpy drop is Δh_actual = η_stage * Δh_isen_stage.

But since each stage has the same pressure ratio, the isentropic enthalpy drop per stage is the same, so Δh_isen_stage = (h1 - h2s) / 3 ≈ 918.19 / 3 ≈ 306.06 BTU/lb.

Thus, actual enthalpy drop per stage is 0.65 * 306.06 ≈ 198.94 BTU/lb.

So the total actual enthalpy drop is 3 * 198.94 ≈ 596.82 BTU/lb.

The total isentropic enthalpy drop is 918.19 BTU/lb.

Thus, internal efficiency η = 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65, so 65%, which matches option C's efficiency.

But what about the reheat factor? I thought earlier that the reheat factor would be 1.00, but option C has a reheat factor of 1.675. That seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the reheat factor.

Wait, perhaps the reheat factor is the ratio of the actual enthalpy drop to the isentropic enthalpy drop multiplied by the number of stages or something else. Or perhaps it's the inverse, (h1 - h2s) / (h1 - h2_act). Let me think.

Reheat factor R is defined as:

R = (h1 - h2_act) / (h1 - h2s)

In this case, h2_act is the actual exit enthalpy after all three stages. Wait, but in an isentropic process, the actual exit enthalpy h2_act would be the same as h2s, which is 219.31 BTU/lb. So h1 - h2_act = 1137.5 - 219.31 ≈ 918.19 BTU/lb, and h1 - h2s is the same, so R would be 1.00. But that contradicts the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of reheat factor. Maybe it's the ratio of the actual work to the isentropic work, which would be the internal efficiency, which is 0.65. But then the reheat factor would be 1.00, but that's not matching any options except B.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me check some references.

Upon checking, the reheat factor is defined as the ratio of the actual heat drop (h1 - h2_act) to the isentropic heat drop (h1 - h2s). So R = (h1 - h2_act) / (h1 - h2s).

In an isentropic process, h2_act = h2s, so R = (h1 - h2s) / (h1 - h2s) = 1.00. So the reheat factor would be 1.00, and the internal efficiency would be 0.65, which would correspond to option C's efficiency of 0.65 and R=1.675, but that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating h2_act.

Wait, no, because each stage's actual work is based on the stage efficiency, so the actual exit enthalpy after each stage would be:

h2_act = h1 - w_actual / (1 lb) 

But wait, in terms of enthalpy, the actual work per stage is w_actual = η_stage * (h1_stage - h2s_stage)

So for stage 1:

h1_1 = 1137.5 BTU/lb
h2s_1 = h1_1 - (Δh_isen_stage) = 1137.5 - 306.06 ≈ 831.44 BTU/lb
w_actual_1 = η_stage * (h1_1 - h2s_1) = 0.65 * 306.06 ≈ 198.94 BTU/lb
h2_act_1 = h1_1 - w_actual_1 ≈ 1137.5 - 198.94 ≈ 938.56 BTU/lb

Then, for stage 2:

h1_2 = h2_act_1 ≈ 938.56 BTU/lb
h2s_2 = h1_2 - 306.06 ≈ 938.56 - 306.06 ≈ 632.50 BTU/lb
w_actual_2 = 0.65 * 306.06 ≈ 198.94 BTU/lb
h2_act_2 = 938.56 - 198.94 ≈ 739.62 BTU/lb

Stage 3:

h1_3 = 739.62 BTU/lb
h2s_3 = 739.62 - 306.06 ≈ 433.56 BTU/lb
w_actual_3 = 0.65 * 306.06 ≈ 198.94 BTU/lb
h2_act_3 = 739.62 - 198.94 ≈ 540.68 BTU/lb

So the total actual work is 3 * 198.94 ≈ 596.82 BTU/lb, and the actual exit enthalpy h2_act is 540.68 BTU/lb.

The isentropic exit enthalpy h2s is 219.31 BTU/lb, as calculated earlier.

So the actual heat drop is h1 - h2_act = 1137.5 - 540.68 ≈ 596.82 BTU/lb.

The isentropic heat drop is h1 - h2s = 1137.5 - 219.31 ≈ 918.19 BTU/lb.

So the reheat factor R = (h1 - h2_act) / (h1 - h2s) = 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65.

Wait, that can't be right because the reheat factor is supposed to be greater than 1 when there's reheat. But in this case, since the process is isentropic, the reheat factor would be less than 1, which contradicts the options provided.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should consider that the reheat factor isn't applicable here because the process is isentropic, so R=1.00, and the internal efficiency is 0.65, which would correspond to option C, but option C's R is 1.675, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the actual exit enthalpy. Let me try a different approach. Since each stage's actual work is 0.65 * isentropic work per stage, the total actual work is 3 * 0.65 * (918.19/3) ) = 3 * 0.65 * 306.06 ≈ 596.82 BTU/lb, as before.

The actual exit enthalpy h2_act = h1 - total actual work = 1137.5 - 596.82 ≈ 540.68 BTU/lb.

So the actual heat drop is 596.82 BTU/lb, and the isentropic heat drop is 918.19 BTU/lb.

Thus, R = 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65.

But that's less than 1, which suggests that the reheat factor is 0.65, which doesn't make sense because reheat factor is usually greater than 1 when reheat occurs. But since the process is isentropic, perhaps reheat factor isn't applicable, and the answer is R=1.00, but then the internal efficiency is 0.65, which isn't among the options except C, but C has R=1.675.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the internal efficiency is calculated differently, perhaps considering the actual work per stage and the isentropic work per stage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the internal efficiency is the same as the stage efficiency when the stages are identical and there's no reheat. So η_internal = 0.65, and the reheat factor is 1.00, which would correspond to option B, but option B's efficiency is 0.70.

Hmm. I'm not confident in my calculations. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option F has efficiency 0.953 and R=1.1124, which seems plausible if the internal efficiency is high. But I calculated 0.65 efficiency.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the isentropic exit enthalpy. Let me try that again.

At 1 psia, with entropy s=1.5377 BTU/lb·R, which is between s_f=1.4001 and s_g=7.3595. So it's a two-phase mixture. The quality x is (1.5377 - 1.4001)/(7.3595 - 1.4001) ≈ (0.1376)/(5.9594) ≈ 0.0231.

So h2s = h_f + x * h_fg = 197.5 + 0.0231*(1137.5 - 197.5) = 197.5 + 0.0231*940 ≈ 197.5 + 21.81 ≈ 219.31 BTU/lb.

So the isentropic heat drop is 1137.5 - 219.31 ≈ 918.19 BTU/lb.

Each stage's isentropic work is 918.19 /3 ≈ 306.06 BTU/lb.

Each stage's actual work is 0.65 * 306.06 ≈ 198.94 BTU/lb.

Total actual work: 3 * 198.94 ≈ 596.82 BTU/lb.

So internal efficiency η = 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65.

Reheat factor R = (h1 - h2_act) / (h1 - h2s) = (1137.5 - 540.68) / 918.19 ≈ 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65.

But that can't be right because R should be greater than 1 if there's reheat. Wait, no, in this case, the actual heat drop is less than the isentropic heat drop, so R is less than 1, which would imply that the process is more efficient than isentropic, which doesn't make sense.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the reheat factor isn't applicable in this problem because the process is isentropic, so the reheat factor is 1.00, and the internal efficiency is 0.65, which would point to option C. But option C's reheat factor is 1.675, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the actual exit enthalpy. Let me try again.

After three stages, the actual exit enthalpy h2_act = h1 - total actual work = 1137.5 - 596.82 ≈ 540.68 BTU/lb.

So the actual heat drop is 596.82 BTU/lb, and the isentropic heat drop is 918.19 BTU/lb.

So R = 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65.

But this doesn't match any options where R is greater than 1. So perhaps the reheat factor isn't applicable here, and the correct answer is option B: efficiency 0.70, R=1.00, but that doesn't align with my calculations.

I'm really confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is calculated based on the actual enthalpy drop per stage compared to the isentropic drop per stage.

Wait, for each stage, the actual enthalpy drop is 198.94 BTU/lb, and the isentropic drop is 306.06 BTU/lb. So R per stage would be 198.94 / 306.06 ≈ 0.65. But that's the same as the stage efficiency, so it doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is the sum of the actual enthalpy drops divided by the isentropic sum, which would be 0.65, but again, that doesn't match the options.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest one where efficiency is 0.65 is option C, but its R is 1.675, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake and the correct answer is option F with efficiency 0.953 and R=1.1124, but I can't see how that aligns with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the internal efficiency isn't just the sum of the actual work over the isentropic work but involves some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for internal efficiency in a multi-stage turbine with the same pressure ratio and efficiency.

The formula for internal efficiency in a multi-stage turbine is given by:

η = (1 - (1 - η)^n * (r^v - 1)) / (1 - (r^v - 1)),

where n is the number of stages, η is the stage efficiency, and r^v is the vane row pressure ratio. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the actual work and compare it to the isentropic work, which I did earlier, leading to η = 0.65 and R = 0.65, but that doesn't match any options.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess. Since my calculation leads to η=0.65 and R=0.65, but none of the options have that, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reheat factor. Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is the inverse, so R=1/0.65≈1.538, which is close to option F's R=1.1124 or option E's R=1.15. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reheat factor differently. The reheat factor is sometimes defined as the actual enthalpy drop per stage divided by the isentropic enthalpy drop per stage. So R_stage = w_actual / w_isen = η_stage = 0.65. But for three stages, the total R would be the product of each stage's R, but that doesn't make sense because R_stage is the same for each stage.

Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is the ratio of the total actual enthalpy drop to the total isentropic enthalpy drop, which would be 0.65, but again, none of the options match.

I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Based on my calculations, the internal efficiency is 0.65, which matches option C, but the reheat factor doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F with efficiency 0.953 and R=1.1124, but I can't see how that aligns with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the actual exit enthalpy. Let me try one more time.

After three stages, the actual exit enthalpy is h2_act = h1 - 3 * (η_stage * (h1 - h2s)/3) ) = h1 - η_stage * (h1 - h2s) = 1137.5 - 0.65 * 918.19 ≈ 1137.5 - 596.82 ≈ 540.68 BTU/lb.

So the actual heat drop is 1137.5 - 540.68 ≈ 596.82 BTU/lb.

The isentropic heat drop is 918.19 BTU/lb.

Thus, R = 596.82 / 918.19 ≈ 0.65.

But this still doesn't match any options where R is greater than 1. I'm stuck, so I'll go with option C: Efficiency = 0.65, Reheat factor = 1.675, but I'm not confident.

The problem involves calculating the internal efficiency and reheat factor for a three-stage turbine operating between 100 psia (saturated steam) and 1 psia, with a stage efficiency of 65%. The process is isentropic, meaning no heat is added or removed, and the approach velocity is negligible.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Initial and Final Enthalpy**:
   - At 100 psia (saturated steam), the specific enthalpy is \( h_1 = 1137.5 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).
   - At 1 psia, the entropy of saturated steam is \( s_1 = 1.5377 \, \text{BTU/lb·R} \). Using steam tables, the specific enthalpy at 1 psia with this entropy is \( h_2s \approx 219.31 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).

2. **Isentropic Enthalpy Drop**:
   - The total isentropic enthalpy drop is \( \Delta h_{isen} = h_1 - h_2s = 1137.5 - 219.31 \approx 918.19 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).

3. **Work per Stage**:
   - Each stage has an equal isentropic enthalpy drop: \( \Delta h_{isen,\text{stage}} = \frac{918.19}{3} \approx 306.06 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).
   - The actual work per stage is \( w_{\text{actual}} = \eta_{\text{stage}} \cdot \Delta h_{isen,\text{stage}} = 0.65 \cdot 306.06 \approx 198.94 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).

4. **Total Actual and Isentropic Work**:
   - Total actual work for three stages: \( W_{\text{actual}} = 3 \cdot 198.94 \approx 596.82 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).
   - Total isentropic work: \( W_{isen} = 3 \cdot 306.06 \approx 918.19 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).

5. **Internal Efficiency**:
   - Internal efficiency is the ratio of actual work to isentropic work:  
     \[
     \eta_{\text{internal}} = \frac{W_{\text{actual}}}{W_{isen}} = \frac{596.82}{918.19} \approx 0.65
     \]

6. **Reheat Factor**:
   - The reheat factor \( R \) is defined as the ratio of the actual heat drop to the isentropic heat drop:  
     \[
     R = \frac{h_1 - h_2}{h_1 - h_2s}
     \]
   - Here, \( h_2 \) (actual exit enthalpy) is calculated as \( h_2 = h_1 - W_{\text{actual}} = 1137.5 - 596.82 \approx 540.68 \, \text{BTU/lb} \).
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     R = \frac{1137.5 - 540.68}{1137.5 - 219.31} = \frac{596.82}{918.19} \approx 0.65
     \]
   - However, this result contradicts the expected behavior of the reheat factor, which is typically greater than 1 when reheat occurs. Since the process is isentropic, the reheat factor is not applicable, and \( R = 1.00 \).

### Conclusion:
The internal efficiency is calculated to be \( \eta_{\text{internal}} = 0.65 \), which matches option C. However, the reheat factor does not align with the provided options, as it should be \( R = 1.00 \) for an isentropic process. Despite this discrepancy, the closest match based on efficiency is:
