Alright, so I've got this question about Rawls' claims regarding how students with fewer native assets should be treated in terms of educational resources. Hmm, I remember Rawls was a philosopher who talked a lot about justice and fairness, especially in his work "A Theory of Justice." He introduced the idea of the "veil of ignorance," where people decide principles of justice without knowing their place in society. That's to ensure fairness.

The question is asking about students who have fewer native assets, like intelligence. So, should they get the same attention and resources, more, less, or something else? Let's think about Rawls' principles. He emphasized equality and fairness, particularly in the context of what he called the "original position," where individuals would agree to principles that would be the most advantageous for the least advantaged. That makes me think he would support policies that help those who are less fortunate.

Looking at the options, option I says more attention and resources than those with more native assets. That seems in line with trying to level the playing field. Rawls' idea of the "difference principle" suggests that inequalities are only justified if they benefit the least advantaged. So, providing more resources to those who have less would help reduce disparities and promote equality of opportunity.

Other options don't fit as well. Option A says same attention and resources, but I think Rawls would argue for more for the less advantaged to make up for their initial disadvantages. Option E suggests less, which goes against his principles. Option J is about basic education, but I think Rawls would want more comprehensive support.

Rawls' philosophy emphasizes fairness and equality, particularly advocating for policies that benefit the least advantaged. His "difference principle" supports providing more resources to those with fewer native assets to reduce disparities and promote equality of opportunity. Therefore, the correct answer is I: more attention and resources than those with more native assets.

Answer: I
