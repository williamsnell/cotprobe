Okay, let me try to solve this problem. So, the question is about figuring out how much the vice president of sales spent on lunch after adding a 20% tip. The lunch itself cost $44, and she gave a 20% tip on that amount. I need to calculate the total amount she spent.

First, I think I should understand what a 20% tip means. A tip is usually a percentage of the total bill, which in this case is $44. So, 20% of $44 is the tip she gave. Then, I'll add that tip to the original $44 to get the total amount spent.

Let me break it down step by step. To find 20% of $44, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 20% is the same as 0.20. So, I multiply $44 by 0.20. Let me calculate that.

44 multiplied by 0.20 equals... let's see. 44 times 0.20 is 8.80. So, the tip is $8.80.

Now, I need to add this tip to the original lunch cost to find the total amount spent. The original lunch was $44, and the tip is $8.80. So, I add them together: 44 + 8.80.

Adding those together, 44 plus 8 is 52, and then adding 0.80 makes it 52.80. So, the total amount she spent is $52.80.

Looking at the options provided, option C is $52.80. So, that must be the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The process was straightforward: calculate the tip and add it to the original amount. I converted the percentage correctly and did the multiplication right. Double-checking the addition, 44 plus 8.80 definitely equals 52.80. So, I'm confident that option C is the right choice.
