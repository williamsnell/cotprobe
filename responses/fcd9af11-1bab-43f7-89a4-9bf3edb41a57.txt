Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about Maine's aphorism. The question is asking in what way the statement is often misunderstood. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the statement is: "the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract." I remember that Maine was a legal historian, so this probably relates to his analysis of societal changes, especially in legal terms.

The key terms here are "status" and "contract." From what I recall, Maine contrasts the idea of a society based on status (where individuals are defined by their position in a hierarchy, like feudal systems) with one based on contract (where individuals are free to make agreements and are more mobile). So, progressive societies move away from the former to the latter.

The question is about how this statement is misunderstood. The options are A to G, each suggesting a different misinterpretation.

Looking at the options:

A: His concept of status is misrepresented. Maybe people think status is something else, like social status in general, but perhaps it's more about legal status.

B: Misinterpreted as a prediction. Maybe people think he's saying societies will continue moving this way, but perhaps he's describing past movements.

C: Considered inapplicable to Western legal systems. If his idea is about moving from status to contract, which seems applicable to Western systems, this might not be it.

D: Related to economic progression. Not sure, but the movement is more about legal and social structures than just economics.

E: Taken literally. That could mean people think it's a direct, physical movement, but it's more abstract.

F: Misconstrued use of 'progressive.' Maybe 'progressive' is misunderstood as meaning something else, like politically progressive.

G: Misinterpretation of 'contract.' Perhaps people think it's about written contracts, but it's more about the broader legal and social shift.

Now, considering the statement, Maine is talking about a historical movement, not predicting the future. So if people take it as a prediction about what will happen, that would be a misunderstanding. That would align with option B: it's misinterpreted as a prediction.

Wait, but could it be option F? Because sometimes 'progressive' can be confused with modern progressive movements. But I think the key here is that the aphorism is often taken as a prediction, not just a description of past trends. So B seems more likely.

Alternatively, maybe people think it's a literal movement, like physically moving, but that seems less likely than misinterpreting it as a future prediction.

So I think the answer is B.

The statement is often misunderstood as a prediction about future societies rather than a description of historical trends. 

Answer: B
