Question:

What is the heat shock response ?

Options:

A: Heat shock is a response where cells decrease the overall transcription rate and maintain only vital functions at high temperatures
B: Heat shock is a response where cells increase the transcription of all genes uniformly in response to high temperatures
C: Heat shock is a response to cold temperatures
D: Heat shock is a response where cells only transcribe heat shock genes under normal temperature conditions
E: Heat shock is a response where cells stop transcribing the previously active genes and instead transcribe a new set of genes called heat shock genes when the temperature is raised.
F: Heat shock is a state where cells rapidly divide in response to high temperatures
G: Heat shock is a response where cells continue to transcribe the same genes despite high temperatures
H: Heat shock is a response where cells primarily transcribe heat shock genes in extremely low temperatures
I: Heat shock is a cellular process that repairs DNA damage caused by high temperatures without altering gene transcription
J: Heat shock is a gene mutation caused by high temperatures

Okay, so I have this question about the heat shock response, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the heat shock response is something that happens when cells are exposed to high temperatures. I think it's a stress response, right? So when the cell is under stress, like heat, it activates certain genes to help it cope.

From what I've studied, when the temperature rises, cells produce proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs). These proteins help in various ways, like refolding denatured proteins or cleaning up damaged ones. So, the cell must be changing its gene expression to produce these proteins.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the cells decrease transcription and only maintain vital functions. Wait, but during heat shock, I thought the transcription of some genes, like heat shock genes, increases. So A might not be right.

Option B suggests all genes are transcribed more uniformly. That doesn't sound right because the cell is specifically upregulating certain genes, not all.

Option C says it's a response to cold. No, heat shock is about high temps, so C is wrong.

Option D states that cells only transcribe heat shock genes under normal conditions. That doesn't make sense because heat shock genes are activated when the temperature rises, not normally.

Option E mentions stopping previous transcription and starting new genes. Hmm, I think the cell does start transcribing heat shock genes more, but does it stop others? Maybe not entirely, but the focus is on the new genes. So E could be a contender.

Option F is about cell division. I don't recall heat shock causing rapid division; it's more about stress response and protein repair, so F is probably wrong.

Option G says transcription continues the same despite high temps. No, because the cell changes its transcription to produce heat shock proteins, so G is incorrect.

Option H talks about extreme low temps. Again, no, because heat shock is about high temps, so H is wrong.

Option I suggests DNA repair without altering transcription. I know that heat shock proteins are involved in DNA repair, but the process does involve changing gene expression to produce those proteins. So I is incorrect.

Option J says it's a gene mutation caused by heat. No, mutations are changes in DNA sequence, but heat shock response is about activating genes, not causing mutations. So J is wrong.

Wait, going back to E: "cells stop transcribing the previously active genes and instead transcribe a new set called heat shock genes." But do they stop all previous? I think the cell might downregulate some genes to conserve resources but not necessarily stop all. However, among the options given, E seems the closest to the correct description of the heat shock response.

The heat shock response is a stress reaction in cells when exposed to high temperatures. It involves the transcription of specific heat shock genes to produce proteins that aid in protein refolding and cellular repair. Among the options, E best describes this process by highlighting the shift to new gene transcription, even if not entirely stopping all previous activity. 

Answer: E
