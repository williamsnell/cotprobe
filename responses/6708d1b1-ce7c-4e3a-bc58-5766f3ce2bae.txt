Question:

After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 42-year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel. During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?

Options:

A: Advise her to drink more wine to help with the pain
B: Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone
C: Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally
D: Recommend a consultation with a psychiatrist to address her fears of addiction
E: Suggest biofeedback therapy to control pain
F: Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam
G: Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule
H: Administer methadone as an alternative to morphine
I: Increase the dose of morphine to relieve her anxiety
J: Encourage the patient to endure the pain without medication to prevent addiction

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to think through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The patient is a 42-year-old woman who's been through a lotâ€”severe beating, gunshot wound to the abdomen, and then surgery involving resection of a perforated small bowel, plus some facial reconstruction and fixing her left femur. She's 36 hours post-op, awake but not fully alert. She's on IV morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says she needs the morphine for pain but is worried about becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder but drinks a little wine weekly.

So the question is about the initial action the physician should take. The options are A to J.

First, I need to consider her current situation. She's post-major surgery, so pain management is crucial. Morphine is a strong opioid, and she's using it as prescribed. Her main concern is about addiction, even though she's never had a problem before. She drinks a bit, but that's not a problem here.

Looking at the options:

A: Advise more wine. That doesn't make sense. Alcohol can interact with meds and isn't helpful for pain. Plus, it's not addressing her fear of addiction.

B: Maintain morphine with naloxone. Naloxone is for reversing opioid effects, but giving it periodically might just cause more anxiety. It's not standard practice unless there's an overdose.

C: Switch to oral acetaminophen. She might not be ready for oral meds yet, and acetaminophen isn't as strong as morphine. Plus, her pain is probably too severe for that.

D: Consult a psychiatrist. Her fear is about addiction, which is a real concern, but maybe she just needs reassurance. A psychiatrist might be overkill unless there's a deeper issue.

E: Biofeedback therapy. I don't think that's the first line for pain management, especially with such severe pain.

F: Switch to IM lorazepam. That's a benzodiazepine, which can be habit-forming and doesn't treat pain. It might help anxiety but not the pain.

G: Reassure her about addiction risk. Since she has no history, the risk is low. This seems reasonable.

H: Methadone as alternative. Methadone is another opioid, so it doesn't solve her fear. Plus, it's not better than morphine in this context.

I: Increase morphine dose for anxiety. That could lead to more risk without addressing the underlying fear. Plus, anxiety might not be from pain but fear of addiction.

J: Endure pain without meds. That's not patient-centered and could cause more harm.

So, the best options seem to be G or D. But she's not showing signs of addiction, just fear. Reassurance would be appropriate. Option G says her chance is minuscule, which is true for someone without a history. Option D might be for more severe anxiety or if her fears are interfering, but initial action is likely reassurance.

The patient is in a post-operative state with severe pain managed by morphine, expressing concerns about addiction despite no history of substance use disorder. The most appropriate initial action is to reassure her about her low risk of addiction, addressing her fears directly. 

Answer: G
