Okay, so I've got this question about a prenatal patient, and I need to figure out the next step in her management. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, which means she's had two pregnancies and has one child. She's currently at 12 weeks' gestation and feels well. Her first pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated, so no prior issues there. She's taking folic acid and a multivitamin, which is good because they're important for pregnancy.

Her vital signs are a bit elevated: temperature is 37.2°C, which is 99°F. That's slightly above normal, so maybe a low-grade fever. Blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. I know that in pregnancy, blood pressure can vary, but 108/60 seems a bit low. Maybe she's just a bit dehydrated, but I'm not sure if that's significant here.

Pelvic exam shows the uterus is consistent with a 12-week gestation, so no issues there in terms of size. The urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase, which is a sign of possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The urinalysis confirms that with WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. Gram-negative rods in urine often point towards bacteria like E. coli, which are common in UTIs.

So, putting this together, she likely has a UTI. UTIs in pregnancy can be problematic if untreated because they can lead to pyelonephritis, which is a kidney infection and can be serious. Also, UTIs during pregnancy are more common due to hormonal changes and increased bladder pressure.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Recommend drinking 8 oz of cranberry juice daily. Cranberry juice is often suggested for UTIs because it can make the urine more acidic and potentially prevent bacteria from adhering to the bladder wall. However, it's more of a preventive measure and not a treatment. If she already has a UTI, she needs antibiotics, not just cranberry juice.

B: Oral amoxicillin therapy. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic, but wait—amoxicillin is typically used for gram-positive bacteria. The urine here has gram-negative rods, which are more likely to be resistant to amoxicillin. Plus, in pregnancy, we generally prefer safer antibiotics. Also, amoxicillin isn't the first-line choice for UTIs; more commonly, it's trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin.

C: Oral metronidazole therapy. Metronidazole is used for infections caused by anaerobes, like Bacteroides, and for certain protozoal infections like trichomoniasis. But in this case, the urinalysis suggests a bacterial UTI, not a protozoal one. So metronidazole probably isn't the right choice here.

D: Intravenous cefazolin therapy. Cefazolin is a cephalosporin, which is effective against gram-negative bacteria. IV antibiotics are usually reserved for more severe cases, like pyelonephritis, or when oral antibiotics aren't sufficient or when the patient can't take them orally. Since this patient is 12 weeks pregnant and has a UTI, she might be able to take oral antibiotics unless her condition is severe.

Wait, but why IV? If she's asymptomatic except for the UTI, maybe oral is sufficient. However, I'm a bit confused because UTIs in pregnancy often require treatment to prevent complications. The standard approach is to start oral antibiotics. But the question is about the next step—so perhaps they're considering possible pyelonephritis, which would require IV antibiotics.

But her symptoms are minimal—she doesn't have back pain, nausea, vomiting, or other signs of a upper urinary tract infection. She just has a low-grade fever and positive urinalysis. So maybe she doesn't need IV antibiotics yet.

Wait, but let me think again. The options are about the next step. If she has a UTI, the usual treatment is oral antibiotics. But given that she's pregnant, which option is best.

Option B is amoxicillin, which I was thinking might not be the best choice because gram-negative rods are more likely resistant. So maybe the better option would be trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, nitrofurantoin is another option, but again, not listed.

Wait, but the options are B, C, D. So, if B is amoxicillin, which is a beta-lactam, and the bacteria are gram-negative, would that work? Amoxicillin has some activity against E. coli, which is common in UTIs. But sometimes E. coli can be resistant, especially in recurrent infections. So maybe amoxicillin isn't the best. Alternatively, perhaps she needs IV antibiotics if she can't take oral meds, but she's 12 weeks along and can probably take oral.

Wait, but why is option D IV cefazolin an option? Maybe because she's a gravida 2, but that shouldn't influence the choice. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of rare gram-negative rods suggests a possible resistant strain, so they might go for IV to ensure effectiveness.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing the knowledge that in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, certain antibiotics are preferred. For example, cephalosporins are considered safe. So IV cefazolin might be used if the infection is more severe.

But wait, she's just 12 weeks, and she's feeling well except for the low-grade fever. So maybe oral is sufficient. But the options don't have trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin.

So looking at the options again: B is amoxicillin, D is IV cefazolin.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. She has a UTI with gram-negative rods. The standard treatment for a UTI is oral antibiotics. So the next step would be to start oral antibiotics.

But looking at the options, B is oral amoxicillin. However, if the bacteria are gram-negative, and especially if they're resistant to amoxicillin, then maybe that's not effective. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of WBCs and bacteria suggests a UTI, so antibiotics are needed.

But wait, in this case, the urinalysis shows WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. So it's likely a UTI, but maybe it's asymptomatic bacteriuria? No, because she has a fever, so it's more than that.

Wait, asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is when you have bacteria in the urine without symptoms. But here, she has a fever, so it's more than that—it's an infection that's causing symptoms.

So the next step is to treat the UTI. The options are B and D. If she's able to take oral meds, then oral antibiotics are preferred. But if she's not, then IV.

In this case, she's a 12-week pregnant woman with a UTI. She's probably able to take oral meds, so B or D. But amoxicillin may not be the best choice because of possible resistance. Maybe the better option is IV cefazolin, but that's usually for more severe cases.

Wait, but the presence of a fever suggests that the infection has spread beyond the bladder, possibly to the kidneys, which would require IV antibiotics. So if she has pyelonephritis, she needs IV antibiotics.

But the question says she feels well. Her temperature is slightly elevated, but maybe it's a low-grade fever. Uterus size is normal, so no hydronephrosis or other signs.

So, in this case, is she presenting with a simple UTI or pyelonephritis? The symptoms are minimal—fever, positive urinalysis. Without more severe symptoms, it's probably a UTI, not pyelonephritis.

Therefore, the next step is oral antibiotics. But the options are B and D. Amoxicillin is an option, but perhaps it's not the best. Alternatively, the patient is taking folic acid, and some antibiotics can interact with that, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, another consideration: in pregnancy, trimethoprim is used, but it's not an option. So the available options are B and D. If oral is possible, then B; if the infection is more severe, D.

But without more severe symptoms, I think oral is sufficient. So B would be the next step. However, I've heard that amoxicillin isn't the first choice for UTIs because of resistance. Trimethoprim is more commonly used.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The urinalysis shows rare gram-negative rods. If it's a UTI, the common cause is E. coli, which is gram-negative. So, amoxicillin might be effective, but if she's had prior UTIs, maybe resistance is a concern.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is D, IV cefazolin, because in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, IV antibiotics are often used to ensure effectiveness and avoid any risk with oral medications, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question says she feels well. So, she might not need IV. Maybe the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that she's gravida 2, para 1, and had an uncomplicated first pregnancy doesn't relate here. So, the presence of WBCs and gram-negative rods indicates a UTI, and the next step is treatment with antibiotics.

Given the options, B is oral amoxicillin. But I'm not entirely confident because I thought amoxicillin isn't the best for gram-negative. Maybe the correct answer is D, IV cefazolin.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But I think the standard approach is to start oral antibiotics for a UTI in pregnancy unless it's a severe case. So the next step would be oral amoxicillin, option B. But wait, another thought: metronidazole is option C. But that's for anaerobic infections or trichomonas, which isn't the case here.

So, I think the correct answer is B: Oral amoxicillin therapy.
</think>

The patient is a 27-year-old woman at 12 weeks' gestation with a low-grade fever, positive urine dipstick for leukocyte esterase, and urinalysis showing WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. This suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs in pregnancy require prompt treatment to prevent complications like pyelonephritis. 

Option A, cranberry juice, is more preventive and not a treatment for an active UTI. Option C, metronidazole, is used for anaerobic or protozoal infections, not bacterial UTIs. Option D, IV cefazolin, is typically reserved for severe infections or when oral therapy is not feasible. Since the patient feels well and has no signs of pyelonephritis, oral antibiotics are appropriate. Amoxicillin (Option B) is an option, though it may not be the first-line choice for gram-negative bacteria. However, given the options, oral amoxicillin is the most suitable next step.

Answer: B
