Okay, so I've got this question about money functions, and I need to figure it out. Let's see. The question is asking which function of money best defines $1.25 as the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop. Hmm. I've studied a bit about the functions of money before, but I'm not entirely sure about all of them. Let me think through each option.

First, I remember that money has several key functions, like a medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, and others. The main functions I know are: store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account, measure of liquidity, and so on. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Store of value. I think this means that money can be saved and used later, retaining its value. But in this case, we're talking about a price, which is more about measuring something, not storing value. So probably not A.

Option B: Medium of exchange. That's when money is used to buy things, acting as a medium instead of bartering. But again, the question is about the price, not the act of exchanging. So maybe not B.

Option C: Unit of account. Oh right, this is about assigning monetary values to goods and services. So when we say a bottle of pop costs $1.25, that's using money as a unit of account. That seems to fit.

Option D: Measure of liquidity. Liquidity refers to how easily something can be converted into cash. The price is about value, not how liquid the asset is. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: Measure of credit. That's more about borrowing and lending, like interest rates. Not related to setting a price. So E is probably out.

Option F: Indicator of wealth. We use money to show wealth, but the price here is about measuring the cost, not the person's wealth. So F isn't it.

Option G: Standard for deferred payment. This would be when you agree to pay later, like with a loan. Not directly about the price of an item, so G might not be correct.

Option H: Mode of transfer. Transferring money, like sending it via bank, but again, the question is about the price, not the transfer method. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: Transfer of ownership. This is more about the exchange process, like when you pay and get the product. But the question is about the price, not the transfer itself. So I don't think so.

Option J: Benchmark of exchange rate. Exchange rates relate to converting one currency to another. This isn't about setting a price in a single currency. So J isn't right.

Putting it all together, the function that defines the price is the unit of account. So the correct answer should be C.

The function of money that best defines $1.25 as the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop is the unit of account, as it assigns a monetary value to the product.

Answer: C
