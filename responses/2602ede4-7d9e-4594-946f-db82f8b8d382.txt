D: 12.22222
E: 5.55556

G: 6.66667
H: 8.88889
I: 7.77778
J: 4.44444

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the average number of coin tosses until two consecutive heads appear. The probability of heads is 3/7, which is a bit less than 0.5. Hmm, I remember this is a type of probability problem, maybe involving states or recursion.

Let me think. When dealing with consecutive events like this, it's often useful to model it using states. Each state represents the recent history of the tosses. So, in this case, the states could be:

- Start: No heads yet.
- H: One head has just been tossed.
- HH: Two consecutive heads, which is the ending state.

I need to find the expected number of tosses to reach the HH state starting from Start.

Let me denote the expected number of tosses from each state as follows:
- E: Expected tosses from Start.
- E_H: Expected tosses from state H.

Our goal is to find E.

First, from Start, when I toss the coin, there's a 3/7 chance of getting a head (moving to state H) and a 4/7 chance of getting a tail (staying in Start).

So, the equation for E would be:
E = 1 + (3/7) * E_H + (4/7) * E

Wait, that makes sense because each toss takes 1 step, and then depending on the outcome, we go to H or stay in Start.

Next, from state H, if I toss the coin:
- 3/7 chance to get H again, which ends the experiment. So, no more tosses needed.
- 4/7 chance to get a tail, which takes us back to Start.

So, the equation for E_H is:
E_H = 1 + (3/7)*0 + (4/7)*E

Because if we get a head, we're done, contributing 0 additional tosses, and if we get a tail, we go back to Start, expecting E more tosses.

Now, I have two equations:
1. E = 1 + (3/7) E_H + (4/7) E
2. E_H = 1 + (4/7) E

Let me rearrange equation 1 to solve for E.

Subtract (4/7) E from both sides:
E - (4/7) E = 1 + (3/7) E_H
(3/7) E = 1 + (3/7) E_H

Multiply both sides by 7 to eliminate denominators:
3E = 7 + 3E_H
Divide both sides by 3:
E = (7 + 3E_H)/3 → E = 7/3 + E_H

Now, from equation 2, E_H = 1 + (4/7) E

Let me substitute E_H into the equation for E.

E = 7/3 + [1 + (4/7) E]
E = 7/3 + 1 + (4/7) E
Combine the constants:
7/3 is approximately 2.333 and 1 is 1, so together it's 3.333... which is 10/3.

So:
E = 10/3 + (4/7) E

Now, I need to solve for E. Let's subtract (4/7) E from both sides.

E - (4/7) E = 10/3
Factor E:
(1 - 4/7) E = 10/3
(3/7) E = 10/3

Multiply both sides by 7/3 to solve for E:
E = (10/3) * (7/3) = 70/9

Calculate 70 divided by 9: 70 ÷ 9 is approximately 7.777...

Looking at the options, option I is 7.77778. So, the answer should be I.
</think>

The average number of tosses is calculated using states and expected values. The expected value starting from the beginning is 70/9, which is approximately 7.77778.

Answer: I
