Question:

A market demand curve is defined as a horizontal summation of all the individual demand curves. Why is this summation taken horizontally rather than vertically?

Options:

A: A vertical summation fits the definition of a market demand curve.
B: The horizontal summation reflects the prices at which consumers are willing to purchase a given quantity.
C: A vertical summation would represent the sum of the prices for each quantity, which is not meaningful.
D: The proper horizontal point is a summation of all the individual quantities demanded.
E: The market demand curve is a schedule of prices.
F: The horizontal summation allows for the calculation of the total quantity demanded at various price levels.
G: A vertical summation would show the total revenue, not the quantity demanded.
H: A vertical summation would aggregate individual demands in terms of price, not quantity.
I: The vertical summation would reflect the cumulative willingness to pay, rather than the total quantity demanded.
J: The vertical point is a summation of all individual quantities demanded.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about market demand curves. Hmm, I remember that a market demand curve is the sum of all individual demand curves, but I'm a bit fuzzy on why it's a horizontal summation rather than a vertical one. Let me think this through.

First, I recall that an individual demand curve shows the quantity a person is willing to buy at each price. So, for each price point, there's a specific quantity. Now, when we talk about the market demand, we're aggregating all these individual curves to get the total quantity demanded at each price across all consumers.

Wait, so if we're adding up individual quantities at the same price, that sounds like a horizontal sum. Because at a given price (the same Y-axis point), each person has a certain quantity (X-axis). So adding those Xs together gives the total quantity for that price. That makes sense because the market demand is about total quantity across all buyers at each price.

On the other hand, a vertical summation would be adding up the prices for each quantity. But that doesn't seem right because prices are the same across different quantities. I'm not sure, but I think that would mess up the relationship between price and quantity. Like, if each person's demand curve has a price at a certain quantity, adding them vertically would add prices for each quantity, which isn't how the market demand works. Because the market demand is for one price level, total quantity.

So looking at the options, option B says the horizontal summation reflects the prices at which consumers are willing to purchase a given quantity. Wait, no, the prices are the same across individuals for each quantity. But the market curve shows the total quantity at each price, so maybe not B. Option C says vertical summation would sum the prices for each quantity, which isn't meaningful. That sounds correct because if you add prices vertically, you're adding them across different quantities, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Option D says the horizontal point is a sum of individual quantities, which is true, but why is it horizontal? Option F mentions calculating total quantity at various prices, which aligns with horizontal summation. Option H says vertical sums would aggregate in terms of price, not quantity. That makes sense too because if you sum vertically, you're adding the prices, not the quantities. So vertical summation doesn't give you the right metric for the market demand, which is about quantity at each price.

Wait, so why is horizontal the right way? Because for each price (same Y), each individual has a Q (X), and we sum those Qs to get the total Q for that P. So horizontal because we're summing across the same Y-axis value, varying X. So the horizontal axis is quantity, and each Y is a price point.

Looking back at the options, option F says the horizontal summation allows calculation of total quantity demanded at various price levels. That's exactly what we need. Because the market demand curve is showing, for each price, how much total quantity is demanded. So F seems correct.

Another angle: the market demand curve is a horizontal aggregation because each price level is the same for all consumers. So at P1, each consumer has a Q1, Q2, etc., and adding those gives the total Q at P1. That's the horizontal sum.

So, the reason is that a horizontal summation adds up the quantities at each price level, which is how the market demand works. If it were vertical, we'd be adding prices for each quantity, which isn't how the market demand is structured.

So the correct answer should be F. But wait, let me check the other options again.

Option C: vertical sums would sum prices for each quantity. That's not meaningful because in market demand, for each price, you sum quantities. So vertical summation would be adding prices across different quantities, which doesn't make sense because the price is the same for each quantity in the individual curves. So option C is also a valid reason why vertical doesn't work.

Wait, but the question is asking why the summation is horizontal. So both F and C are correct in their reasoning, but which is the better answer?

The question is about why horizontal is used. So the correct reason is that the horizontal summation adds up the quantities at each price, giving the total quantity for that price. So F explains the purpose of the horizontal sum. Option C explains why vertical wouldn't work, but the question is about why it's horizontal.

So the answer is F: The horizontal summation allows for the calculation of the total quantity demanded at various price levels.
</think>

The market demand curve is a horizontal summation of individual demand curves because it aggregates the total quantity demanded at each price level across all consumers. This approach ensures that for a given price, the quantities demanded by each individual are summed to reflect the total market demand. A horizontal summation is appropriate because it maintains the relationship between price and quantity, whereas a vertical summation would incorrectly aggregate prices for each quantity, which is not meaningful for determining market demand.

Answer: F
