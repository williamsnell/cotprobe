Question:

A bank teller was on trial for embezzlement. The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?

Options:

A: Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.
B: No, because the records are considered public documents and do not need further authentication.
C: No, because the defense did not provide any counter evidence to dispute the records.
D: Yes, because the prosecution must also prove the bank teller had access to manipulate these records.
E: Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.
F: No, because the records are self-authenticating and do not require additional proof of authenticity.
G: No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.
H: Yes, because the prosecution failed to provide a chain of custody for the records.
I: No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.
J: Yes, because the records must be certified by a public official, not just a bank employee.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question about whether the bank's daily deposit and tally records are admissible in court without further proof. The scenario is that a bank teller is on trial for embezzlement, and the prosecution is trying to use these records to show that the deposits don't reconcile with the funds received and recorded. The defense is objecting on hearsay grounds, so I need to think about whether the court will exclude this evidence.

From what I remember, business records are generally admissible under the hearsay exception. The Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 803(6), allow for the admission of records of an activity kept in the regular course of business. These records can be admitted if they were made at or near the time of the event and by someone with knowledge. They don't necessarily need to be authenticated by a live witness, but the proponent (here, the prosecution) needs to lay a foundation for their admissibility.

Wait, but in this case, the prosecution is trying to enter the records without certification or testimony from an official custodian. So the question is whether the court will require more proof of authenticity. I think the key here is whether the records are self-authenticating or if they need some form of certification or testimony.

I remember that some records, like those from a business regularly kept, can be admitted without the custodian testifying if they're authenticated in some other way. For example, a company might certify the records, and then they can be admitted. But here, the prosecution hasn't done that; they're just offering the records as exhibits without any such authentication.

Looking at the options, option G says that business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required. But wait, isn't there more to it? I think that while the records qualify under the business records exception, the proponent still needs to establish the foundation for their admission. So even if they're business records, they need to show that the records were made in the regular course of business, that they were kept by someone with knowledge, and that the circumstances indicate trustworthiness.

But in this case, the prosecution hasn't presented any testimony or certification. So maybe the court would require more. Option A says yes because a qualified bank employee must authenticate them in person or provide certification. That makes sense because without any authentication, the defense could argue that the records are unreliable or that they were fabricated or altered.

Option F says no because the records are self-authenticating. I don't think business records are self-authenticating in the sense that they don't need any foundation. They still need some form of authentication. For example, a party offering a business record would usually need someone to testify that the record is authentic, or provide a certification. So F might not be correct.

Option G is about business records being allowed without further proof. But I think that's not entirely accurate because while the exception applies, the proponent still needs to lay the foundation. So without any testimony or certification, the court might require more.

Option J says yes because the records must be certified by a public official. Wait, no, business records don't need to be certified by a public official. They just need to be shown to be made in the regular course of business. So J is incorrect.

Option H mentions chain of custody, but that's more relevant for physical evidence like items taken from a crime scene. Here, it's about authentication, so H might not apply.

So putting it together, the prosecution is trying to admit business records but hasn't provided the necessary authentication. Therefore, the court is likely to exclude them without further proof. So the correct answer is A: Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.

The court is likely to order the evidence inadmissible because the prosecution has not provided sufficient authentication for the bank's daily deposit and tally records. Under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, such records can be admitted if they are shown to have been made in the regular course of business and authenticated. However, the records must be authenticated either through testimony from a qualified employee or through a certification. Since the prosecution has not done either, the court would require further proof of authenticity before admitting the records.
