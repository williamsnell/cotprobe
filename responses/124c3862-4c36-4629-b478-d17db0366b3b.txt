Okay, so I have this question about the normal heart rate for an adult at rest, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my biology class that the heart rate varies, but what's considered normal?

I think the normal resting heart rate is around 60-100 beats per minute, but wait, no, that's the general range including when someone is exercising or excited. At rest, it should be lower. Oh, right, resting heart rate is usually between 60 to 100 bpm, but I think the average is around 70 bpm. So the normal range is a bit broader.

Wait, let me make sure. Athletes might have a lower resting heart rate, like in the 40s or 50s, but that's not the average. For the general adult population, the normal range is 60-100 bpm. But some sources say 60-100, others might specify 60-90. I'm a bit confused now.

Looking at the options: E is 60-90, J is 60-100. Which one is correct? I think the standard normal range is 60-100, so J would be the answer. But wait, sometimes they consider 60-90 as the normal range, excluding the higher end because 100 is a bit high. Or is it?

Wait, no, I'm pretty sure the normal resting heart rate is 60-100 bpm. So option J is 60-100, which should be correct. But I'm second-guessing because I remember that sometimes the upper limit is 90, but maybe that's for more specific cases. No, I think the standard is 60-100. So the answer should be J.

The normal resting heart rate for an adult is generally considered to be between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm). This range accounts for variations in different individuals and activities. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: 60-100 bpm.

Answer: J
