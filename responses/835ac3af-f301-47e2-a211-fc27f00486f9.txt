Okay, so Mr. Balfour has $1,000 to invest, and he's trying to decide between two options: tax-free municipal bonds that pay 6% interest and a savings account that pays 8% interest. His marginal tax rate is 30%. I need to figure out which investment is better for him after considering taxes.

First, I should understand the tax implications of each investment. Municipal bonds are known for being tax-free at the federal level, but I'm not sure about state taxes. However, the question says they're tax-free, so I'll assume that means federal and possibly state, depending on where he lives, but since it's not specified, I'll go with the given info.

The savings account pays 8% interest, but since that's taxable income, he'll have to pay 30% of that 8% in taxes. So I need to calculate the after-tax return for both options.

For the municipal bonds: 6% interest, tax-free. So his return is straightforwardâ€”6% of $1,000 is $60. No taxes to pay on that.

For the savings account: 8% interest, which is taxable. So the interest earned is $80 (8% of $1,000). Then, 30% of that $80 goes to taxes. Let me calculate that: 0.3 * 80 = $24. So his after-tax return is $80 - $24 = $56.

Comparing the two, the municipal bonds give him $60 after taxes, and the savings account gives him $56 after taxes. So the municipal bonds are better in this case.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any other factors? Like, maybe the savings account could have state taxes, but the question says it's a savings account, which is likely a regular bank account, so the interest is taxed at the federal rate. Since the municipal bonds are tax-free, they come out on top.

So the options are A: Municipal bonds and I: Savings account. Based on the after-tax returns, A is better. So the answer should be A.

Mr. Balfour should choose municipal bonds because, after accounting for taxes, they provide a higher return.
