Question:

Walter, a widower, died in 1997 leaving $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company in trust to pay the income to his son, Stan, for life. Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. "Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?

Options:

A: No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.
B: Yes, because Grace is the only surviving child of Harriet and therefore is entitled to the income from the trust.
C: Yes, because the death of Stan and Morgana in an airplane crash in 2009 triggered the provision for the income to be paid to the living children of Harriet.
D: Yes, because that was Walter's intent.
E: No, because the trust was to be paid to Grace only after the death of any widow of Stan, and Morgana's death nullified this provision.
F: Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income from the trust.
G: Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.
H: No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow.
I: No, because the Rule against Perpetuities prevents the trust from being held indefinitely.

Okay, let's try to figure out this trust question. So, Walter left $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company in trust. The income from this trust is supposed to go to his son Stan for his life. After Stan dies, the income goes to any widow of Stan. Then, upon the death of that widow, the income goes to the living children of Walter's sister Harriet, in equal shares.

Now, let's break down the facts. Walter died in 1997. Stan was married to Morgana and had two kids: Andrew and Beverly. But then both Stan and Morgana died in 2009 in an airplane crash. Harriet's only surviving child is Grace, born in 2001. So, Harriet is bringing an action on behalf of Grace to get the trust income.

The question is whether Harriet is likely to prevail. So, I need to look at the trust terms and see how they apply after Stan and Morgana's deaths.

First, the trust provides that after Stan's death, the income goes to any widow of Stan. But since both Stan and Morgana died in 2009, Morgana was Stan's widow at the time of his death, right? Because they were both in the crash together, so I guess Morgana was his widow upon Stan's death. So, the income would go to Morgana for her life. But then, Morgana also died in 2009. Wait, so after Morgana's death, the income should go to the living children of Harriet.

Wait, but Harriet's only living child is Grace. So, after both Stan and Morgana die, the income should go to Harriet's children. But let me check the trust terms again.

The trust says: Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, then the income goes to the living children of Harriet, in equal shares.

So, when Stan died in 2009, Morgana became the widow, and the income went to her. But Morgana also died in 2009. So, upon her death, the income should shift to Harriet's living children. Since Harriet only has Grace, that's who should get it.

But wait, the options are about whether Harriet can get the income for Grace now. So, after both Stan and Morgana died, the income should go to Harriet's children. So, Harriet is the sister, and Grace is her only child. So, Grace should be getting the income.

Let me look at the options. Option C says yes because the deaths triggered the provision for income to go to Harriet's children. That seems correct. But let me check the other options.

Option E says no because the trust was to be paid to Grace only after the death of any widow of Stan, and Morgana's death nullified this. Wait, no. Because after Morgana's death, the income should go to Harriet's children. So, E is saying that because Morgana died, the provision is nullified, but that's not right. It just means the next step happens.

Option H says no because the trust says income goes to Harriet's living children only after the death of Stan's widow. So, that's exactly what happened. So, H is saying that the trust's terms are clear, so Harriet can't get it yet. But wait, no, because after the widow dies, which is Morgana, the income goes to Harriet's children. So, since Morgana is dead, it should go to Harriet's children, which is Grace.

Wait, but the trust says "the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares." So, if Harriet has only Grace, then Grace gets it all.

So, looking at the options, option C says yes because the deaths triggered the shift to Harriet's children. But option H says no because the trust requires the death of the widow, which happened, so the income should go to Harriet's children.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The options are a bit tricky. Let me think again.

The trust says upon Stan's death, income to any widow. Then upon widow's death, to Harriet's children.

Stan died in 2009, so income goes to Morgana (his widow) for her life. Then, when Morgana died in 2009, the income should go to Harriet's children. So, the income should now go to Grace.

So, Harriet is bringing an action to have the income paid to Grace. So, the question is whether the trust is set up so that the income is now to go to Grace.

Option H says no because the trust says the income goes to Harriet's children only after the death of Stan's widow. So, that's exactly what has happened. So, H is saying that because the trust requires the death of the widow, which happened, Harriet's children should get it. So, Harriet should prevail because the condition has been met.

Wait, but H says "No, because the trust explicitly states..." So, H is arguing against Harriet. But that can't be right because if the conditions are met, Harriet's children should get it.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read option H again. It says, "No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow." So, H is saying that because the death of the widow has happened, the income should go to Harriet's children. But the option is phrased as a reason to say No, which doesn't make sense. Because if the condition is met, Harriet should get it, so the answer should be Yes.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at the options again.

Option H: No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow.

But if the widow has died, then the income should go to Harriet's children. So, the answer should be Yes, not No. So, H is incorrect because it's saying No, but the correct answer is Yes.

So, looking again, option C says Yes because the deaths triggered the provision. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option E says No because the death of the widow nullified the provision. But no, the death of the widow triggers the next step.

Option D says Yes because it was Walter's intent. That's true, but perhaps the main issue is whether the trust terms have been satisfied.

Option F says Yes because there's no statute modifying the common law. But the common law might have something about this.

Wait, but the key issue is whether the trust's terms have been fulfilled. Since both Stan and Morgana are dead, the income should go to Harriet's children. So, Harriet should be able to collect for Grace.

So, the correct answer is likely option C or H. But I'm getting confused because of how the options are phrased.

Wait, option H says No because the trust requires the death of the widow. But since the widow has died, the income should go to Harriet's children. So, H is arguing against Harriet, but that's incorrect because the condition is met. So, the correct answer should be Yes, so H is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is C, which says Yes because the deaths triggered the provision. Alternatively, perhaps H is trying to say that the income is only for after the widow's death, which has happened, so the income should go to Harriet's children, meaning Harriet is entitled, so the answer is Yes.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the order:

1. Stan's life: income to him.

2. Upon Stan's death: income to his widow (Morgana) for her life.

3. Upon widow's death: income to Harriet's children.

So, since both Stan and Morgana died in 2009, after Stan's death, Morgana became the widow and received the income for her life. But since she died in the same year, upon her death, the income should go to Harriet's children.

So, the income should now be going to Grace.

So, Harriet is bringing an action to have the income paid to Grace, which is correct because the conditions have been met.

So, looking at the options, option C says Yes because the deaths triggered the shift. Option H says No because the trust requires the widow's death, which has happened, so the income should go to Harriet's children. So, H is incorrect because it's a No, but the correct outcome is Yes.

Therefore, the correct answer is C or H. Wait, no, because H is phrased as a reason why Harriet shouldn't prevail, but that's incorrect because the condition has been met, so she should prevail.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is with the Rule against Perpetuities. Let me check the options.

Option A: No, because provisions violate RAP. But when does the income go to Harriet's children? It's upon the death of the widow, which could be any time after Stan's death. So, the interest is for Harriet's children, but if Harriet has no children except Grace, then it's certain. But if Harriet could have more children after the trust, that might create a problem. But in this case, Harriet's only child is Grace, born in 2001, and the deaths happened in 2009, so Grace is alive.

Wait, but the trust says "the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares." So, if Harriet has more children after the trust is created, they would also be entitled. But the Rule against Perpetuities requires that the interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years of a life in being at the creation of the interest.

In this case, the interest for Harriet's children is a contingent remainder. The question is whether it violates RAP.

The contingency is that after the death of Stan's widow, the income goes to Harriet's children. So, the class is Harriet's children living at the time of the widow's death. But since Harriet was alive in 1997, when the trust was created, and any children born to her after that would have to be born within her lifetime, which is a life in being. So, the interest would vest within 21 years after Harriet's death, which is a life in being. So, it doesn't violate RAP.

So, A is incorrect.

So, back to the main issue. The income should now go to Grace because the widow has died, so option C is correct.

Wait, but option H says No because the trust requires the death of the widow. But that's exactly what happened. So, H is incorrect because it's saying No when the answer should be Yes.

So, the correct answer is C. Because the deaths triggered the provision, so the income should go to Harriet's children, which is Grace.
</think>

The trust created by Walter provides that the income is to be paid to Stan for his life, then to Stan's widow for her life, and finally to the living children of Harriet in equal shares upon the death of Stan's widow. Both Stan and Morgana (Stan's widow) died in 2009, triggering the next stage of the trust. Since Harriet's only surviving child is Grace, the income should now go to Grace.

Option C correctly states that the deaths of Stan and Morgana triggered the provision for the income to be paid to Harriet's children. Option H incorrectly argues against Harriet's entitlement by stating that the trust requires the death of the widow, which has already occurred, making it irrelevant to deny the claim. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Yes, because the death of Stan and Morgana in an airplane crash in 2009 triggered the provision for the income to be paid to the living children of Harriet.

Answer: C
