Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here asking which of the given elements is a metal. The options are from A to J, each labeled with a chemical symbol. I need to figure out which one is a metal. Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: Ne. I remember that Ne stands for Neon, which is a noble gas. Noble gases are non-metals, so A is out.

Option B: N. That's Nitrogen. Nitrogen is a diatomic gas at room temperature and is a non-metal. So B isn't a metal either.

C is S. Sulfur is another non-metal. It's a yellow crystalline solid and part of the oxygen family. So C is not a metal.

D is I. I think that's Iodine. Iodine is a halogen, which makes it a non-metal. So D is out.

E is F. Fluorine, another halogen, definitely a non-metal. So E isn't the answer.

F is Se. Selenium is part of the oxygen family. I believe it's a non-metal as well, though I'm a bit fuzzy on whether it's sometimes considered a metalloid. Wait, no, I think it's a non-metal. So F is not a metal.

G is Ga. Hmm, Ga is Gallium. I'm not as sure about this one. Gallium is a metal, right? It's a post-transition metal, used in electronics, like in semiconductors. So Ga is a metal, so G could be the answer.

H is O. Oxygen is a non-metal, part of the chalcogens. So H is out.

I is He. Helium is a noble gas, so definitely a non-metal. I is not the answer.

J is H. Hydrogen is a bit tricky. It's a diatomic gas and is considered a non-metal, though sometimes it's placed separately in the periodic table. So J isn't a metal.

So the only option left that's a metal is G: Ga, which is Gallium. I think that's correct, but I should double-check. Gallium is indeed a metal, used in alloys and electronics. So yeah, G is the metal in the list.

The correct answer is G: Ga, as Gallium is a metal.

Answer: G
