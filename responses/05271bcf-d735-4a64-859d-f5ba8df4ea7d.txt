Question:

When a person invents a new product, he is often granted a patent which is intended to protect his idea from being stolen by others. Explain how the issuance of patents fosters the growth of monopoly.

Options:

A: Patents have no effect on monopoly.
B: Patents are awarded to multiple inventors for the same idea, fostering competition rather than monopoly.
C: Patents ensure that only government-owned companies can become monopolies.
D: Patents grant exclusive rights for a short period, after which a monopoly is impossible.
E: Patents allow for an unlimited number of competitors, preventing any form of monopoly.
F: Patents hinder the growth of a monopoly.
G: Patents require the inventor to share the idea with the public, which leads to increased competition and no monopoly.
H: Patents always lead to monopoly.
I: A patent, as a barrier to entry, may cause a monopoly to arise.
J: Patents provide temporary monopoly rights which can be easily bypassed by competitors.

Okay, so I have this question about how patents foster the growth of monopolies. I'm a bit new to this, so let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that a patent is a form of intellectual property that grants the inventor exclusive rights to their invention for a certain period. The idea is to protect their creation so they can profit from it without others copying it immediately.

The question is asking how the issuance of patents helps in fostering monopolies. Monopolies, as I understand them, are market situations where a single seller or company dominates the entire market, leading to lack of competition and sometimes higher prices because there's no one else to undercut them.

So, how do patents tie into this? Well, when someone gets a patent, they're the only ones allowed to make, use, or sell their invention during the patent period. If a company has a patent on a product, others can't produce the same thing without permission. That sounds like it could create a situation where the patent holder is the sole provider, which is a key feature of a monopoly.

Looking at the options:

Option A says patents have no effect on monopoly. That seems wrong because if someone has exclusive rights, it could create a monopoly situation.

Option B suggests patents are given to multiple inventors, fostering competition. But I think patents are usually exclusive to the original inventor, so this might not be correct.

Option C talks about government-owned companies becoming monopolies. I don't think that's the case; patents can be granted to any qualifying individual or company, regardless of ownership.

Option D says patents grant exclusive rights for a short period, making a monopoly impossible after that. Well, the period is usually 20 years for a utility patent, which is long enough for a company to establish a market presence, so maybe a monopoly could form during that time.

Option E suggests an unlimited number of competitors, preventing monopolies. But with a patent, competitors are limited during the patent's term, so this seems opposite.

Option F claims patents hinder monopoly growth. But I think they can help create a monopoly situation, so F might be incorrect.

Option G says inventors must share ideas, increasing competition. No, that's not rightâ€”patents are about keeping the idea exclusive.

Option H states patents always lead to monopoly. That's too absolute. While they can contribute to it, not all patents result in a monopoly because other factors in the market can prevent it.

Option I says patents as entry barriers can cause a monopoly. That makes sense because if others can't enter the market easily due to the patent, the patent holder might dominate the market, leading to a monopoly.

Option J suggests patents provide temporary rights easily bypassed. I don't think they're easily bypassed; patents are meant to be enforceable, though they can be challenged in court.

So, the best options seem to be I and maybe D. The question is about how patents foster monopolies. I think I is correct because patents act as barriers to entry, allowing the patent holder to be the sole provider, which can lead to a monopoly. D says it's for a short period, but the period is long enough, and it's the barrier aspect that's key.

Therefore, the answer should be I.

The issuance of patents fosters the growth of monopolies by acting as a barrier to entry, allowing the patent holder exclusive rights to their invention, which can dominate the market and lead to a monopoly.
