Okay, so I've got this question about SNR, which I think stands for Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The question says that the peak voltage of the signal is 20 times the peak voltage of the noise. I need to find the SNR and then its value in decibels, with three significant figures. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that SNR is usually calculated as the ratio of the signal's power to the noise's power. Oh wait, but sometimes people talk about it in terms of voltage amplitudes. Since the question gives me peak voltages, maybe I should think about how that translates to power.

Wait, power is proportional to the square of the voltage, right? So if the signal voltage is V_s and the noise voltage is V_n, then the SNR in terms of power would be (V_s / V_n)^2. Because power is V squared over resistance, and assuming the same resistance for both, it cancels out, so we just get the square of the voltage ratio.

So in this case, the signal's peak voltage is 20 times that of the noise. So V_s/V_n = 20. Then, the SNR (linear) would be (20)^2 = 400. That makes sense because power scales with the square.

But wait, the question also asks for SNR in decibels, which is the logarithmic scale. The formula for SNR in dB is 10 times the log base 10 of the linear SNR. So SNR_dB = 10 * log10(SNR_linear).

So plugging in the numbers, SNR_dB = 10 * log10(400). Let me calculate that. Log10 of 400 is log10(4 * 10^2) = log10(4) + log10(10^2) = log10(4) + 2. Log10(4) is approximately 0.60206, so adding 2 gives 2.60206. Multiply by 10, that's about 26.0206 dB.

Wait, but wait a second. Sometimes I've seen SNR calculated using RMS values instead of peak values. Oh right, because in that case, the RMS is V_peak divided by sqrt(2). So if we were using RMS voltages, the ratio would be (V_s_rms / V_n_rms) = (V_s_peak / sqrt(2)) / (V_n_peak / sqrt(2)) ) = V_s_peak / V_n_peak, which is 20. Then the SNR_linear would be (20)^2 = 400 again. So whether we use peak or RMS, the SNR_linear comes out the same because the ratio of RMS is the same as the ratio of peaks when considering the same type of signal (like both being sine waves). So that part is okay.

So the SNR_linear is 400, and SNR_dB is approximately 26.0 dB. Now looking at the options, E is 26.0. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake with the dB calculation. Let me recalculate log10(400). Let's see, 10^2 is 100, 10^3 is 1000, so 400 is 4 * 10^2. So log10(400) = log10(4) + 2. Log10(4) is about 0.60206, so 0.60206 + 2 = 2.60206. Multiply by 10 gives 26.0206 dB, which rounds to 26.0 dB. So yes, E is correct.

The SNR in linear terms is calculated as (20)^2 = 400. Converting this to dB: 10 * log10(400) â‰ˆ 26.0 dB. 

Answer: E
