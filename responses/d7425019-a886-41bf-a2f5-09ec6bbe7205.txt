Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the rate of a first-order reaction and calculating the decrease in activation enthalpy when a catalyst is added. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the rate increases from 1.5 × 10^-2 sec^-1 to 4.6 sec^-1 when a catalyst is added. The temperature is 260°C, which I should probably convert to Kelvin for any calculations. Wait, 260°C is 260 + 273.15 = 533.15 K. I'll keep that in mind.

Since it's a first-order reaction, the rate equation is r = k [A]. But when the catalyst is added, the rate increases, which means the rate constant k has increased. Catalysts lower the activation energy, which speeds up the reaction.

The problem asks for the decrease in activation enthalpy, ΔH#. Wait, but the question specifies that the activation entropy (S°‡) isn't affected by the catalyst. So, I think I can use the Arrhenius equation, but maybe the two-point form because there are two rates at the same temperature? Or wait, no, the temperature is the same—so maybe it's a comparison of the two rate constants, but at the same temperature. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the same temperature and same reaction wouldn't change the rate without a catalyst. Oh, wait no, the catalyst changes the activation energy but not the entropy. So I think I need to compare the two rate constants with the same temperature but different activation energies.

Wait, the Arrhenius equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(RT)). Since the catalyst affects Ea (the activation energy), but not the pre-exponential factor A, right? Because catalysts provide an alternative pathway, lowering Ea but not changing the S°‡, as given.

So the ratio of the rate constants after and before catalyst would be k2/k1 = exp( (Ea1 - Ea2)/(R T) ), because when Ea decreases, k increases. Let me set that up.

Given that k2 is the rate after catalyst, which is 4.6 sec^-1, and k1 is 1.5e-2 sec^-1. So k2/k1 = (4.6)/(0.015) = let me calculate that. 4.6 divided by 0.015 is approximately 306.666... So about 306.667.

So, 306.667 = exp( (Ea1 - Ea2)/(R T) ), because the catalyst lowers Ea, so Ea2 < Ea1, so (Ea1 - Ea2) is positive.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(306.667) = (Ea1 - Ea2)/(R T).

So, ln(306.667) is approximately ln(300) is about 5.7038, but 306.667 is a bit more. Let me calculate it more accurately. Let's see, ln(300)=5.70378, ln(306.667)=?

Using calculator steps: 306.6667 ≈ e^5.723? Let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, I can compute ln(306.667) = ln(300*(1 + 6.667/300)) ≈ ln(300) + (6.667/300) = 5.7038 + 0.02222 = 5.726 approx. So ln(k2/k1) ≈5.726.

Now, R is the gas constant. Since the activation enthalpy is in kcal/mol, I should use R in kcal/mol·K units. R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K), which is 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K). Wait, no, 1 cal is 4.184 J, but wait, let me think: 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4184 J. But R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 / 4184 ≈ 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K).

So R = 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K).

T is 533.15 K, as calculated earlier.

So, Ea1 - Ea2 = ln(k2/k1) * R*T.

Plugging in the numbers: 5.726 * 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K) * 533.15 K.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5.726 * 0.001987 = approximately 0.011346.

Then, 0.011346 * 533.15 ≈ let's see. 0.011346 * 500 = 5.673, 0.011346 *33.15≈0.3758. So total ≈5.673 + 0.3758 = 6.0488 kcal/mol.

Wait, that's the value of Ea1 - Ea2. So the decrease in activation enthalpy is Ea1 - Ea2 = 6.0488 kcal/mol. So the activation enthalpy decreased by approximately 6.05 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 6.063 kcal/mol, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps my approximations introduced a slight error. Let me check the calculations more precisely.

Wait, maybe I should compute ln(306.6667) more accurately.

Using a calculator: ln(306.6667) = let me compute it.

Let me try to compute ln(306.6667):

We know that e^5 = 148.413, e^6=403.429. So 306.6667 is between e^5.7 and e^5.72.

Compute e^5.7: e^5 is 148.413, e^0.7 is about 2.01375, so 148.413 * 2.01375 ≈ 148.413 * 2 = 296.826 plus 148.413 *0.01375≈2.036. So ~298.862. Hmm, 298.862 is less than 306.6667.

Next, e^5.72: Let me compute 5.72.

We can write 5.72 as 5.7 + 0.02.

We know e^5.7 ≈ 300 (as above, e^5.7≈300). So e^(5.7+0.02) = e^5.7 * e^0.02 ≈ 300 * 1.020201 = 300 * 1.020201 ≈306.0603.

Wait, that's close to 306.06, which is very close to 306.6667. So ln(306.06) is 5.72, so ln(306.6667) is slightly higher than 5.72.

So perhaps ln(306.6667) ≈5.722.

Alternatively, let me compute with more precision. Let me use the formula ln(x) = ln(a) + (x-a)/a - ((x-a)^2)/(2a²) + ... for x near a.

Let a=306.06, x=306.6667.

So (x - a) = 306.6667 -306.06=0.6067.

So ln(x) = ln(a) + (0.6067)/a - (0.6067)^2/(2a²) + ...

We know ln(a)=5.72.

So (0.6067)/306.06 ≈0.001982.

And (0.6067)^2=0.3681, divided by (2*(306.06)^2)=2*(93662.7)=187325.4.

So 0.3681 / 187325.4 ≈1.964e-6.

So ln(x) ≈5.72 +0.001982 -0.000001964≈5.72198.

So ln(306.6667)= approximately 5.722.

Wait, that's more precise. So ln(k2/k1)=5.722.

So Ea1 - Ea2 =5.722 * R*T.

R=0.001987 kcal/(mol·K), T=533.15 K.

So 5.722 * 0.001987 = let's compute 5 *0.001987=0.009935, 0.722 *0.001987≈0.001433. So total ≈0.011368.

Then, 0.011368 *533.15 = Let's compute 0.01 *533.15=5.3315, 0.001368 *533.15 ≈0.7292. So total ≈5.3315 +0.7292=6.0607 kcal/mol.

Wait, that's about 6.0607, which is close to option I (6.063 kcal/mol) and option C is 6.560, D is 6.563. Hmm, but I got approximately 6.06 kcal/mol, so the closest option is I:6.063.

But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in units. Oh wait, R is in kcal/(mol·K), so the calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait, in the Arrhenius equation, the activation enthalpy Ea is in the exponent as Ea/(R T). So the formula I used is correct.

So the decrease in activation enthalpy is approximately 6.06 kcal/mol. Looking at the options, option I is 6.063 kcal/mol, which is very close. So the answer should be I.

The rate of a first-order reaction increases from \( r_1 = 1.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{sec}^{-1} \) to \( r_2 = 4.6 \, \text{sec}^{-1} \) when a catalyst is added at \( 260^\circ \text{C} \) (converted to \( T = 533.15 \, \text{K} \)). The goal is to calculate the decrease in activation enthalpy (\( \Delta H^\# \)).

Using the Arrhenius equation, the ratio of rate constants is given by:

\[
\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \exp\left(\frac{E_a1 - Ea2}{RT}\right)
\]

where \( R = 0.001987 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)} \). The ratio of rate constants is:

\[
\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \frac{4.6}{0.015} \approx 306.667
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right) = \ln(306.667) \approx 5.722
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
E_a1 - Ea2 = \ln\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right) \cdot R \cdot T
\]

\[
E_a1 - Ea2 = 5.722 \cdot 0.001987 \cdot 533.15 \approx 6.06 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

The decrease in activation enthalpy is approximately \( 6.06 \, \text{kcal/mol} \), which matches option I (\( 6.063 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)).
