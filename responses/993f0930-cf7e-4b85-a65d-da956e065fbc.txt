Okay, so I have this problem about finding the missing mass in fluorine-19. Hmm, I remember that missing mass usually refers to the mass defect, which is the difference between the sum of the masses of individual nucleons and the actual mass of the nucleus. The mass defect is related to the binding energy, right? So, the steps should involve calculating the expected mass of the nucleus and then comparing it to the given atomic weight.

Let me start by jotting down the given data. The masses are:
- Proton: 1.00728 amu
- Neutron: 1.00867 amu
- Electron: 0.000549 amu (but wait, electrons are part of the atom, not the nucleus. So maybe I don't need to include them here.)

The isotope is ^19_9F, which means it has 9 protons (since the atomic number is 9) and a mass number of 19. So the number of neutrons should be 19 - 9 = 10 neutrons.

So the total mass of the protons and neutrons would be (9 * mass of proton) + (10 * mass of neutron). Let me calculate that.

Calculating protons: 9 * 1.00728 = let's see, 1.00728 * 9. Hmm, 1.00728 * 10 is 10.0728, minus 1.00728 gives 9.06552 amu.

Neutrons: 10 * 1.00867 = 10.0867 amu.

Adding them together: 9.06552 + 10.0867 = 19.15222 amu.

Wait, but the atomic weight of fluorine-19 is given as 18.9984 amu. But wait, the atomic weight includes electrons, right? Because the protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, and electrons are in the atom. Oh wait no, actually, the atomic weight is the mass of the entire atom, which includes electrons. However, when calculating the mass defect, I think we only consider the nucleus. So maybe I should subtract the electrons' mass from the atomic weight to get the mass of the nucleus?

Wait, let me think. The atomic weight (18.9984 amu) is the mass of the atom, which includes electrons. But the sum of protons and neutrons gives the mass of the nucleus. So to find the mass defect, I should compare the nucleus' expected mass (sum of protons and neutrons) to the actual nucleus' mass.

But wait, the actual nucleus' mass is the atomic weight minus the mass of the electrons. How many electrons does fluorine have? Fluorine has 9 electrons. Each electron has a mass of 0.000549 amu. So the total mass of electrons is 9 * 0.000549 = let's compute that.

9 * 0.000549 = 0.004941 amu.

So the nucleus mass would be atomic weight minus electrons' mass: 18.9984 - 0.004941 = approximately 18.993459 amu.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the expected nucleus mass as 19.15222 amu. Wait, that can't be right because 19.15 is higher than the atomic weight. But that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is part of the atom. Oh wait, no, the sum of protons and neutrons is higher than the actual nucleus mass because of mass defect. So the expected mass (sum) is higher than the actual nucleus mass.

Wait, the expected mass is 19.15222 amu, and the actual nucleus mass is approximately 18.993459 amu. So the mass defect would be the difference between these two.

So mass defect = expected mass - actual nucleus mass.

So that's 19.15222 - 18.993459 = let's compute this.

19.15222 minus 18.993459.

Let me subtract:

19.15222
-18.993459
= ?

19.15222 - 18 = 1.15222
Then subtract 0.993459: 1.15222 - 0.993459 = 0.158761 amu.

So the mass defect is approximately 0.158761 amu. Looking at the options, option H is 0.1588 amu. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check because I might have made a mistake in the steps. Let me go through it again.

1. Calculate total mass of protons and neutrons: 9 * 1.00728 = 9.06552; 10 * 1.00867 =10.0867. Sum is 19.15222 amu.

2. Atomic weight of F-19 is 18.9984 amu. This is the mass of the entire atom, which includes electrons. So the nucleus mass is atomic weight minus electrons' mass.

3. Electrons: 9 * 0.000549 = 0.004941 amu.

4. Nucleus mass: 18.9984 - 0.004941 = 18.993459 amu.

5. Mass defect: 19.15222 - 18.993459 = 0.158761 amu.

Which is about 0.1588 amu, matching option H.

The missing mass, or mass defect, is calculated by comparing the sum of the individual nucleon masses to the actual nuclear mass. For ^19_9F, the expected nuclear mass is 19.15222 amu, while the actual nuclear mass is 18.993459 amu. The mass defect is 0.158761 amu, which corresponds to option H.
