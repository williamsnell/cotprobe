Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the supplement of a 40-degree angle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but I'll try to work through it. Let me think... I remember that supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Right, that's the key point. So if one angle is 40 degrees, the other angle that complements it to 180 degrees is its supplement.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. No, wait, that's for supplementary angles. So, yeah, the sum should be 180. So, the supplement of an angle is what you add to it to get 180. So, if the angle is 40 degrees, then the supplement would be 180 minus 40.

Let me do the math. 180 minus 40 is 140. So, the supplement should be 140 degrees. Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one is 140. Let me check the options again: A is 100, B is 160, C is 140, D is 120, E is 90, F is 130, G is 50, H is 110, I is 220, J is 150. Oh, so option C is 140. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing supplementary with complementary angles. Complementary angles add up to 90 degrees, right? So, if the question had asked for the complement, it would be 50 degrees. But since it's the supplement, it's definitely 140. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the answer is C: 140.

The supplement of a 40° angle is calculated by subtracting it from 180°, resulting in 140°.
