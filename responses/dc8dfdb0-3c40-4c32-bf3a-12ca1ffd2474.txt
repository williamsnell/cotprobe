Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about entropy change during an adiabatic expansion. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem says: We have a sample of nitrogen gas with a mass of 14 grams at 298 K and 1.00 bar. It undergoes an adiabatic reversible expansion, doubling its volume. I need to calculate the total change in entropy.

Hmm. Adiabatic means no heat exchange with the surroundings, right? So Q=0. But wait, entropy change isn't just about heat; it's also about the process itself. Oh, right, for a reversible process, the entropy change is calculated using the integral of dQ_rev divided by T. But since it's adiabatic, dQ is zero, so does that mean entropy change is zero?

Wait, but wait. I remember that in an adiabatic process, entropy can still change if the process is irreversible, but this is a reversible adiabatic process. Oh, right! For reversible adiabatic processes, the entropy change is zero. Because for a reversible process, the entropy change is zero only if it's isothermal, isn't that right? Or wait, no. Wait, no, in a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy doesn't change because the process is reversible and there's no entropy generation.

Wait, let me clarify. The entropy change for a process is given by ΔS = S_final - S_initial. For a reversible adiabatic process, since it's reversible, the process is quasistatic, and for such a process, there's no entropy generation. So the total entropy change of the universe is zero, meaning the system's entropy change is zero. Because in an adiabatic process, Q=0, and for reversible processes, the entropy change is zero.

Wait, but wait, sometimes when dealing with gases expanding, even in adiabatic processes, the entropy can change if the process isn't reversible. But here it's specified as reversible. So in a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy change should be zero. Because entropy is a state function, and for a reversible process, the system's entropy change is zero.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For an adiabatic process, Q=0. The entropy change ΔS is equal to ∫(dQ_rev / T). But if Q is zero, then ΔS is zero, but that's only if the process is reversible. Because if the process is irreversible, even if Q=0, the entropy change of the system could be non-zero because entropy is generated.

So in this case, it's a reversible adiabatic expansion. Therefore, the entropy change of the system is zero.

Wait, but wait, nitrogen is diatomic, and we're considering the change in entropy. Let me think again. Maybe I should check the formula for entropy change in terms of volume and temperature.

The formula for entropy change when both temperature and volume change is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1). But wait, for an ideal gas. Oh, but in an adiabatic process, Q=0, and for a reversible adiabatic process, the process follows PV^γ = constant, where γ is Cp/Cv.

But since the process is reversible and adiabatic, the entropy change should be zero. Because for a reversible process, the system's entropy change is zero. So the total entropy change would be zero, meaning the answer is F: 0.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the process. The gas is expanding, so it's doing work. Since it's adiabatic, the internal energy decreases, so the temperature drops. But how does that affect entropy?

In an adiabatic expansion, the gas does work, so its internal energy decreases, leading to a drop in temperature. But for entropy, the change depends on how the volume and temperature change.

Wait, but in a reversible adiabatic process, the process is isentropic. So the entropy of the system doesn't change. Because the process is reversible, meaning the system and surroundings are in equilibrium at every step, so no entropy is generated. Hence, ΔS = 0.

So the answer should be F: 0.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the total entropy change during a reversible adiabatic expansion of nitrogen gas. Since the process is both reversible and adiabatic, the entropy change of the system is zero because there is no heat exchange (Q=0) and no entropy generation in reversible processes. Therefore, the total entropy change is zero.

Answer: F
