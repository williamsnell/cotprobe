Okay, so I need to figure out which case was the first to define the meaning of the doctrine of 'margin of appreciation' as applied by the European Court of Human Rights. The options are A through J, each with different cases.

First, I remember that the margin of appreciation is a principle used by the ECHR to determine how much leeway states have in implementing their obligations under the Convention. It's about balancing the need to respect the rights set out in the Convention against the practical implementation by member states, considering their specific circumstances.

I think the term 'margin of appreciation' comes from a key case. I'm trying to recall some of the landmark cases. Let me go through each option:

A: Dudgeon v UK (1981) - This case was about Article 8, right to respect for private life, concerning homosexual relationships. I don't think this was the first case on margin of appreciation.

B: Marckx v Belgium (1979) - This case dealt with the right to marry and found that the law preventing a woman from remarrying without her children's consent was a violation. It's about gender equality, but not sure about margin of appreciation.

C: Osman v UK (1998) - This was about the right to life (Article 2) and the state's failure to protect. Not directly about margin of appreciation, I think.

D: Tyrer v UK (1978) - This case involved a child being given a custodial sentence in a borstal, which was seen as degrading. It's about Article 3, right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. The ECHR found a violation, but I'm not sure if this was the first margin case.

E: McCann v UK (1995) - This case is about the killing of three children by the state, but more about the right to life and the obligation to protect. Again, not directly the first margin case.

F: Soering v UK (1989) - This was about extradition to a state where there's a real risk of the death penalty, which violates Article 3. The UK's margin was discussed here, but I'm not sure if it's the first time the doctrine was defined.

G: Airey v Ireland (1979) - This case was about the right to marry and equal status of men and women. Ireland had a law that men could marry at 18, women at 21, which was struck down. Again, not directly about margin of appreciation.

H: Handyside v UK (1976) - This is about freedom of expression under Article 10. The court held that the UK's ban on a book was a violation. The term 'margin of appreciation' might have been introduced here. I think this case is significant because it's one of the earlier ones where the court discussed the balance between rights and state implementation.

I: Sunday Times v UK (1979) - This was about the right to freedom of expression (Article 10) concerning the publication of a newspaper article. The case dealt with the limits of that right, but I'm not certain if it's the first margin case.

J: Goodwin v UK (2002) - This case was about gender reassignment and discrimination. The court found the UK's laws inadequate, but again, not the first margin case.

Wait, I might be mixing up some cases. From what I remember, the margin of appreciation was first discussed in the case of Handyside v UK (1976). The court stated that there is a margin of appreciation that the Contracting States have in defining the limits of what is acceptable within their society, particularly regarding the rights set out in the Convention. This was a key case because it established that while the ECHR has jurisdiction, member states have some flexibility in how they implement the rights, as long as they are within the acceptable margins.

So, the correct answer should be H: Handyside v UK (1976).

The correct answer is H: Handyside v UK (1976), as it was the first case to define the doctrine of the margin of appreciation.
