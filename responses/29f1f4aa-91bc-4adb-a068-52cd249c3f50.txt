Okay, so I've got this question here about surface areas when small pieces are put together into a larger piece. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my classes that when you combine materials, the surface area doesn't just add up directly because some surfaces get covered.

Wait, like when you have two cubes and you stick them together, the total surface area doesn't just double. Because where they touch, those two faces are now internal, right? So each cube has 6 faces, so two would be 12. But when you put them together, they share a face, so the total surface area becomes 10. So it's actually less than double. So the combined surface area decreases compared to the sum of individual areas.

But the question is about the combined surface area. So if you have multiple small pieces, when you assemble them, the total surface area of the whole thing is less than the sum of each piece's surface areas because some surfaces are now internal and not exposed anymore.

So the options are A: greatly increases, B: slightly increases, C: is halved, D: zero, E: greatly decreases, F: quadrupled, G: doubled, H: unchanged, I: slightly decreases, J: decreases.

Wait, so E is "greatly decreases," but J is "decreases." The example I thought of with two cubes: two separate cubes have 12 units of surface area, but when stuck together, they have 10. So the decrease is 2 units, which is a 16.6% decrease. So that's a decrease, but not a huge one. So it's a decrease, but not a slight one? Or is it slight?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about more pieces. Suppose I have four small cubes. Each has 6, so total 24. If I put them together into a bigger cube, the surface area is 6*(2^2) = 24? Wait, no, wait. Wait, a 2x2x2 cube made from eight 1x1x1 cubes. Each small cube has 6 units. So 8 cubes would have 48. But the bigger cube has 6*(2*2) = 24. So the total surface area went from 48 to 24. So that's a big decrease, right? So in that case, the surface area halves.

Wait, wait, that's for a cube. But in the question, it's just small pieces assembled into a larger piece, not necessarily a cube. So maybe depending on how they're put together, the decrease can vary. But generally, when you assemble small pieces into a bigger one, the surface area would decrease because some surfaces are covered.

So looking at the options, E is "greatly decreases," and J is "decreases." Which one is correct? In the case of the 2x2 cube, it's halved, which is a significant decrease. So maybe E is the right answer. But wait, the first example with two cubes only decreased by 16%, which is a slight decrease. So is it always a certain way?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the surface area of the individual pieces. When you combine them, the total surface area of all the small pieces would decrease because some areas are now internal. But for the assembled larger piece, the surface area is that of the larger object, which is less than the sum of the individual surface areas.

Wait, the question says, "the combined surface area." So when you combine small pieces into a larger one, the total surface area of the larger piece is less than the sum of the individual surface areas because of the overlapping. So the combined surface area decreases.

So from the options, J is "decreases," which is correct. But wait, in the cube example, the surface area was halved, which is a significant decrease. So E is "greatly decreases." Hmm, maybe it depends on how the pieces are arranged. If the pieces are put together in a way that minimizes the exposed surface area, like a cube, then it's a significant decrease. But if they're just stuck together in a straight line, the decrease might be less.

Wait, let me think. If I have two cubes stuck together in a line, the combined surface area is 10 units, as I thought earlier. So 10 compared to 12. So a decrease of 2 units, which is 16.6%. So that's a slight decrease. But if I have four cubes in a 2x2 arrangement (a square), then the surface area would be 4*(each side's area times 4 sides) but wait, maybe I'm confusing 2D and 3D here.

Wait, maybe the initial example is better. When you have two cubes, the surface area goes from 12 to 10. So a decrease of 16.6%. So that's a slight decrease, making option I ("slightly decreases") correct. But wait, the options are E: greatly decreases and J: decreases. So I'm confused now.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the combined surface area of all the small pieces after being assembled. So if you have small pieces, each has their own surface area, but when you put them together, the total surface area is the surface area of the larger piece. So the total is lower than the sum of the individual pieces. So the combined surface area decreases.

So in that case, the correct answer would be J: decreases. But earlier, in the cube example, it's a significant decrease, but maybe the question is more general.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: greatly decreases. Because when you make a larger structure, the surface area per unit volume decreases. But the question is about the total surface area, not per unit.

Wait, the question says, "the combined surface area." So when you have small pieces, the sum of their surface areas is S1 + S2 + ... + Sn. When you assemble them into a larger piece, the total surface area becomes S_total, which is less than the sum because some areas are covered. So the combined surface area (of the larger piece) is less than the sum of the individual surface areas. Therefore, the combined surface area decreases.

So the answer would be J: decreases.

But wait, in the two-cube example, the sum is 12, the combined is 10. So a decrease of 2, which is 16.6% of 12. So it's a decrease, but not a great one. So maybe the answer is J: decreases. But some might say it's a slight decrease, which is option I. But the options don't have I as correct. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: greatly increases

B: slightly increases

C: is halved

D: becomes zero

E: greatly decreases

F: is quadrupled

G: is doubled

H: is unchanged

I: slightly decreases

J: decreases

So J is "decreases." I is "slightly decreases." So in the two-cube case, it's a decrease of 16.6%, which is a slight decrease. But if you have more pieces, like four cubes arranged into a 2x2x2 cube, the surface area is 24, which is exactly half of 48 (the sum of four cubes). So that's a more significant decrease, halving.

But the question doesn't specify the number of pieces or the arrangement. So perhaps the general case is that the combined surface area decreases, but the extent depends on how they're assembled. So the safest answer is J: decreases. Because in all cases, the combined surface area is less than the sum of individual surface areas.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think about it: when you break a material into smaller pieces, the total surface area increases because more surfaces are exposed. Conversely, when you assemble small pieces into a larger one, the total surface area decreases because some surfaces are no longer exposed. So the combined surface area decreases.

When small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece, the total surface area of the larger piece is generally less than the sum of the surface areas of the individual small pieces. This is because some surfaces become internal and are no longer exposed when the pieces are joined. For example, two cubes each with a surface area of 6 units have a combined surface area of 12 units when separate. When stuck together, the combined surface area becomes 10 units, resulting in a decrease. Similarly, assembling more pieces into a larger structure, such as a 2x2x2 cube, results in a significant decrease in surface area compared to the sum of the individual pieces. 

While the extent of the decrease can vary depending on the arrangement and number of pieces, the general principle is that the combined surface area decreases. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J
