Okay, so I've got this entropy change problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question has two parts, (a) and (b), each involving phase changes of water. The options provided are A through D, giving different entropy values for each part. I need to calculate the entropy change for both processes and then pick the correct option.

Starting with part (a): H2O(s, -20°C) → H2O(s, 0°C). So, it's ice at -20°C warming up to 0°C. Since it's still solid, we only need to consider the temperature change without a phase change. The formula for entropy change when only temperature changes is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1). But since the problem gives Cp in cal/(deg·mole), I should use the formula with temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait. The temperatures are given in Celsius. To convert to Kelvin for the entropy calculation, I just add 273.15. So initial temperature T1 is -20°C, which is 253.15 K. T2 is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. 

The heat capacity Cp for solid H2O is given as 9 cal/(°C·mole). So, plugging into the formula: ΔS = 9 cal/(°C·mole) * ln(273.15/253.15). Let me calculate that. 

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should calculate the ratio first. 273.15 / 253.15 ≈ 1.0788. The natural log of that is approximately 0.076. So ΔS ≈ 9 * 0.076 = 0.684 cal/(mole·K). Since 1 cal/(mole·K) is about 4.184 J/(mole·K), but wait, the options are in eu, which I think stands for entropy units, so maybe they are in cal/(mole·K) directly. So part (a) entropy change is approximately 0.68 eu/mole.

Now moving to part (b): H2O(s, -20°C) → H2O(liquid, 20°C). This involves two steps: first, warming the ice from -20°C to 0°C, then melting it at 0°C (fusion), and then warming the liquid from 0°C to 20°C.

So the total entropy change will be the sum of three parts: ΔS1 (warming ice), ΔS2 (fusion), ΔS3 (warming liquid).

Calculating each step:

1. ΔS1: Same as part (a), which is 0.684 eu/mole.

2. ΔS2: This is the entropy change during fusion. The formula is ΔS = ΔH_fusion / T. The given ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/(mole·°C)? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the units given are ΔH_fusion = 1440 cal deg^-1 mole^-1, which I think means per degree. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, standard enthalpy of fusion is energy per mole, not per degree. Wait, perhaps the given ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/(mole·K) or per °C? Hmm, wait, maybe the units are in cal/(mole), since it's per mole. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states: ΔH_fusion = 1440 cal deg^-1 mole^-1. Oh, that's 1440 cal/(°C·mole). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because enthalpy of fusion is typically in cal/mol, not per degree. Maybe it's a typo, and it's 1440 cal/(mol), but the way it's written is 1440 cal deg^-1 mole^-1, which would be cal/(°C·mole). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1440 cal/(mole·K). Wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended it as 1440 cal/(mol), so per mole, regardless of temperature.

Wait, but if T is in Kelvin, then using the formula ΔS = ΔH_fusion / T. So if the fusion occurs at 0°C, which is 273.15 K.

So if ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/mol, then ΔS = 1440 / 273.15 ≈ 5.27 cal/(mol·K) → which is 5.27 eu/mole.

Wait, but the given ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal deg^-1 mole^-1. So maybe it's 1440 cal/(°C·mole), which would be 1440 cal/(K·mole) since a change of 1°C is the same as 1 K. Hmm, that would make ΔS = 1440 cal/(K·mole) * 1 K (since the process is at constant T). So 1440 cal/(mole·K) → which is 1440 * (1/273.15) ??? Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no. The formula is ΔS = ΔH_fusion / T_fusion. So if ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/(mole·°C), then perhaps it's 1440 cal/(mole·K), because 1°C change is 1 K change. Wait, but no, the enthalpy change for fusion is a certain number of calories per mole, not per degree. So perhaps the given ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/mol, as a total, not per degree.

Wait, perhaps I misread the units. The problem says: "ΔH_fusion= 1440 cal deg^-1 mole^-1". So that's 1440 cal/(°C·mole), which is 1440 cal/(K·mole), since 1°C = 1 K. So then the entropy change would be ΔS = 1440 cal/(K·mole) * (1 K) = 1440 cal/(mole·K). That seems very high, but let me check.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the formula is ΔS = ΔH / T. So if ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/(mole·K), then T is 273.15 K, so ΔS = 1440 / 273.15 ≈ 5.27 cal/(mole·K), which matches the 5.27 eu/mole I thought earlier.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

If ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/(mole·°C), then when you melt at 0°C, the temperature is 273.15 K. So the entropy change would be ΔS = (1440 cal/(mole·°C)) * (1 °C) / (273.15 K) → because ΔH is per degree, so per mole, it's 1440 cal/(mole·°C). So when you use it in ΔS=ΔH/T, it's (1440 cal/(mole·°C)) * (1 °C) / (273.15 K) ) → 1440/(273.15) ≈ 5.27 cal/(mole·K), which is 5.27 eu/mole.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The correct way is that if ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/mol, then it would be 1440 / 273.15 ≈5.27 eu/mole. But the problem gives it as 1440 cal deg^-1 mole^-1. So that's 1440 cal/(°C·mole), which is 1440 cal/(K·mole) because each degree Celsius is one Kelvin. So when you calculate ΔS = (1440 cal/(K·mole)) * (1 K) ) → 1440 cal/(mole·K). But that's way too high. So perhaps the given ΔH_fusion is actually 1440 cal/mol, and the units were mistyped.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to give ΔH_fusion as 1440 cal/mol, so I should proceed with that. Then ΔS_fusion would be 1440 / 273.15 ≈5.27 eu/mole.

But wait, the problem says ΔH_fusion=1440 cal deg^-1 mole^-1. So that's 1440 cal/(°C·mole), which would be 1440 cal/(K·mole). So using that, ΔS_fusion would be 1440 / 273.15 ≈5.27 eu/mole. Wait, no, because 1440 cal/(K·mole) when T is 273 K would give 1440 / 273 ≈5.27. So that's correct.

Now, moving on.

3. ΔS3: Warming the liquid from 0°C to 20°C. The Cp for liquid water is given as 18 cal/(°C·mole). So using the same entropy formula: ΔS = Cp ln(T2/T1). The temperatures in Kelvin are 273.15 and 293.15. So T2 = 293.15 K, T1 = 273.15 K.

So the ratio is 293.15 / 273.15 ≈1.073. Ln(1.073) ≈0.0703.

So ΔS3 = 18 * 0.0703 ≈1.265 cal/(mole·K) → approximately 1.27 eu/mole.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since it's a temperature change from 0 to 20°C, which is a ΔT of 20°C, perhaps it's easier to calculate using ΔS = Cp * ΔT / T_avg. But the problem says to assume Cp is independent of temperature, so using the integral method is okay. But since we're using the ln(T2/T1) approach, as I did earlier, that's correct.

So adding up all three parts for part (b):

ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 + ΔS3.

ΔS1 is 0.684 eu/mole,

ΔS2 is 5.27 eu/mole,

ΔS3 is 1.27 eu/mole.

Adding them together: 0.684 +5.27 = 5.954, plus 1.27 gives 7.224 eu/mole. So approximately 7.22 eu/mole.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the signs. Since all these are increases in temperature and phase change from solid to liquid, all the entropy changes should be positive, so that's correct.

Wait, but in part (a), the process is only warming the solid. So from part (a), the entropy change is 0.684 eu/mole, which is approximately 0.68 eu/mole, matching option A or C for part (a).

In part (b), the total is 7.22 eu/mole, which matches options A and B. So looking at the options:

Option A: 0.68 for (a) and 7.22 for (b).

Option B: 1.27 for (a) and 7.22.

Wait, but in part (a), I calculated 0.684, which is ~0.68, so part (a) is 0.68, so option A or C.

But wait, let me think again. Did I make any mistake in part (a)?

Wait, the calculation for part (a):

ΔS = Cp * ln(T2/T1) = 9 cal/(°C·mole) * ln(273.15/253.15).

Calculating 273.15 / 253.15 = approximately 1.0788.

ln(1.0788) ≈0.076.

So 9 * 0.076 = 0.684 cal/(mole·K), which is 0.68 eu/mole, correct.

So part (a) is 0.68, part (b) is 7.22.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.68 for (a), 7.22 for (b).

Option B: 1.27 for (a), 7.22 for (b).

So if part (a) is 0.68, option A or C would be correct, but looking at part (b), only options A and B have 7.22 for (b). So option A is the one where (a) is 0.68 and (b) is 7.22.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation for part (b)'s ΔS3. Because when I calculated it, I got approximately 1.27 eu/mole, which would mean the total is 0.68 +5.27 +1.27 = 7.22. But perhaps I made a mistake in the Cp for liquid. Let me check.

Cp for liquid is 18 cal/(°C·mole). The temperature change from 0 to 20°C is 20°C. So alternatively, using ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) or using ΔS = n Cp * ΔT / T_avg.

Wait, using the formula with ln(T2/T1):

T1 = 273.15 K, T2 = 293.15 K.

ln(293.15/273.15) ≈ ln(1.073) ≈0.0703.

So 18 * 0.0703 ≈1.265, which is ~1.27. So that's correct.

So part (b) is indeed 7.22.

So the correct option is option A: 0.68 for (a) and 7.22 for (b).

The entropy change for part (a) involves warming solid water from -20°C to 0°C. Using the formula for entropy change with constant heat capacity, ΔS = Cp ln(T2/T1), where Cp (solid) = 9 cal/(°C·mole), T1 = 253.15 K, and T2 = 273.15 K. The ratio T2/T1 ≈ 1.0788, and ln(1.0788) ≈ 0.076. Thus, ΔS ≈ 9 * 0.076 ≈ 0.684 cal/(mole·K), or 0.68 eu/mole.

For part (b), the process includes three steps: warming the ice, melting it, and warming the liquid. 

1. **Warming the ice (ΔS1):** This is the same as part (a), giving ΔS1 ≈ 0.684 eu/mole.
2. **Melting the ice (ΔS2):** Using ΔS = ΔH_fusion / T, where ΔH_fusion = 1440 cal/(mole·°C) and T = 273.15 K, ΔS2 ≈ 1440 / 273.15 ≈ 5.27 eu/mole.
3. **Warming the liquid (ΔS3):** Using Cp (liquid) = 18 cal/(°C·mole), T1 = 273.15 K, and T2 = 293.15 K, the ratio T2/T1 ≈ 1.073, and ln(1.073) ≈ 0.0703. Thus, ΔS3 ≈ 18 * 0.0703 ≈ 1.27 eu/mole.

Summing these contributions: ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 + ΔS3 ≈ 0.68 + 5.27 + 1.27 ≈ 7.22 eu/mole.

From the options, only option A matches the calculated values: 0.68 eu/mole for (a) and 7.22 eu/mole for (b).
