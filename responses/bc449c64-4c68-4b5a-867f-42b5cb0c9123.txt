Okay, so I have this question about Walen and Roth's cognitive model of the sexual response. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to remember. The question describes a situation where an adult feels aroused when looking at a child, realizes it's inappropriate, and then feels anxiety instead of arousal. I need to figure out which term from the options fits this scenario according to their model.

First, I should recall what Walen and Roth's model entails. From what I remember, their model suggests that sexual arousal isn't just a physiological response but also involves cognitive processes. They probably talk about how thoughts and evaluations influence sexual feelings.

The key here is that the person realizes their arousal is inappropriate. So, the initial arousal is physical, but then cognitive processes kick in. The model likely has stages where perception and evaluation happen. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, A to J. The question is about the result of realizing the arousal is inappropriate. So, the person's initial positive arousal (sexual) is followed by a negative perception or evaluation because they realize it's wrong.

Option B is negative perception. That sounds like the person's cognitive assessment of the situation as negative. Option H is negative evaluation, which might be similar. Wait, what's the difference between perception and evaluation? Perceptions are more about how you see the situation, while evaluations are judgments about it.

In the model, I think the process goes:刺激 → 初步认知（perception）→ 评估（evaluation）→ 反应. So, the person first perceives the situation, then evaluates it. In this case, the perception might be that the child is attractive, leading to arousal. Then the evaluation is that this is wrong, leading to anxiety.

But the question is about the result of the realization. So, after realizing it's inappropriate, the person feels anxiety. That would be a negative evaluation because they're evaluating the situation negatively. Alternatively, maybe it's about cognitive dissonance because there's a conflict between arousal and the realization that it's wrong.

Wait, cognitive dissonance (option J) is a state of tension when there's an inconsistency between thoughts. Here, the person has conflicting feelings: arousal and knowing it's wrong. But the question is about the example according to the model, so maybe it's not dissonance but the evaluation itself.

So, the model probably has stages where after the initial arousal, the person evaluates the situation. If they evaluate it negatively, that leads to anxiety. So, the example is a negative evaluation.

Looking back at the options, H is negative evaluation. That seems to fit. The person's negative evaluation of the situation causes anxiety rather than continuing arousal.

Wait, but the initial arousal is positive, then the evaluation is negative. So the model might have positive and negative evaluations. The person's evaluation here is negative, leading to anxiety. So the correct term is negative evaluation, which is option H.

The question describes a scenario where an adult experiences arousal upon seeing a child, realizes its inappropriateness, and subsequently feels anxiety. According to Walen and Roth's cognitive model, sexual arousal involves both physiological responses and cognitive processes like perception and evaluation. Initially, the person may perceive the child as arousing, but upon evaluating the situation, they recognize it as wrong. This negative evaluation leads to anxiety. 

Among the options, "negative evaluation" (H) best fits the scenario, as it refers to the cognitive judgment that causes the emotional shift from arousal to anxiety. 

Answer: H
