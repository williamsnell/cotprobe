Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Ashford's article. The question is asking what particular paralysis the article is meant to address. The options are A through J, each describing a different issue.

First, I remember that Ashford's article is related to ethics and global issues, probably something to do with poverty or moral responsibility. I think she might be addressing a common problem people face when trying to help with global issues.

Looking at the options, let's break them down:

A: Solving worldwide economic imbalance. That's a big issue, but I'm not sure if Ashford focused on economic imbalance specifically.

B: Meeting everyone's basic needs. That's a fundamental issue, but I'm not certain if that's the main point of paralysis she addresses.

C: Giving up wealth due to Singer's arguments. Singer's arguments, like in "The Singer Solution to World Poverty," do talk about donating to help others, so maybe this is about personal sacrifice.

D: Choosing between immediate harm and structural injustice. This sounds like a dilemma between short-term fixes and long-term systemic changes. Ashford might discuss this as a source of paralysis because people don't know where to focus their efforts.

E: Reconciling conflicting moral theories. That's more about ethics in general, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue she addresses.

F: Prioritizing multiple global issues. That's a broad issue, but again, I'm not certain if that's the specific paralysis she targets.

G: Implementing sustainable solutions to poverty. Sustainable solutions are important, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

H: The scope of global poverty. This is a large issue, but maybe it's more about the overwhelming nature of the problem.

I: Addressing world hunger's responsibility. Similar to H, but more specific to hunger.

J: Environmental issues' complexity. That's another big area, but perhaps not the main focus of Ashford's article.

Now, thinking about Ashford's work, she often discusses the challenges in moral decision-making, especially regarding global poverty. One key point is the tension between addressing immediate harms and working on structural changes. People might feel paralyzed because they don't know whether to help the immediate needs or tackle the underlying issues. This dilemma could cause a lot of hesitation and inaction, which would make sense for an article to address.

Option D seems to capture this. It's about having to choose between immediate harm and structural injustice, which directly relates to the paralysis of not knowing where to start or what's more important.

So, considering all options, D seems like the best fit.

The answer is D.

Answer: D
