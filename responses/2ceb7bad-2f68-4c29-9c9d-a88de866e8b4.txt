Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these buffer solution problems. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question is asking me to find the pH of a 0.10 M HOAc solution that has 0.20 M NaOAc dissolved in it. The dissociation constant (Ka) of HOAc is given as 1.75 × 10^-5. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, so I remember that when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base in the same solution, it's a buffer solution. Buffer solutions resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. The pH of a buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). 

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Yes, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log (base/acid). So in this case, HOAc is the acid (HA) and NaOAc is the conjugate base (A-).

First, I think I need to calculate the pKa. The Ka is given as 1.75 × 10^-5. To find pKa, I take the negative logarithm of Ka. So pKa = -log(1.75e-5). Let me calculate that.

Hmm, log(1.75) is about 0.243, so log(1.75e-5) would be 0.243 -5, which is -4.757. Taking the negative of that gives pKa = 4.757. So approximately 4.76. 

Wait, but maybe I should be more precise. Let me double-check the calculation. Using a calculator, 1.75 ×10^-5. Log(1.75) is indeed about 0.243, so log(1.75e-5) is 0.243 -5 = -4.757, so yes, pKa is 4.757.

Next, I need to find the concentrations of the base (A-) and the acid (HA). The solution is 0.10 M HOAc and 0.20 M NaOAc. Wait, but wait a second—does that mean they're both in the same solution? Because HOAc is a weak acid, and NaOAc is its sodium salt, which dissociates completely to give OAc^- ions. So in the solution, [HA] is 0.10 M and [A-] is 0.20 M, right?

So plugging into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.757 + log(0.20/0.10). 

Wait, 0.20 divided by 0.10 is 2. So log(2) is approximately 0.301. So pH = 4.757 + 0.301 = 5.058. Hmm, that's about 5.06. Looking at the options, option C is 5.07, which is very close. But let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, did I get the ratio right? [A-] is 0.20, [HA] is 0.10, so [A-]/[HA] is 2, so log(2) is 0.3010. So adding to 4.757 gives 5.058, which rounds to 5.06 or 5.07. So option C is 5.07, which would be the correct answer. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values. Let's see, exact calculation of pKa. Let me compute 1.75 ×10^-5.

Ka = 1.75e-5. pKa = -log(1.75e-5). Let me compute this more accurately. Using a calculator, log(1.75) is approximately 0.2430. So pKa = 4.75698, which is about 4.757.

Then log(2) is approximately 0.3010, as I thought. So 4.757 + 0.3010 = 5.058, which is 5.06. But the options have 5.07 as option C, so that must be the intended answer. 

Wait, but wait, maybe the concentrations are given in a way that I need to check if they are in the same solution. The problem says 0.10 M HOAc solution with 0.20 M NaOAc. So that's correct; the concentrations are as given. So I think I'm confident that the pH is approximately 5.06, which rounds to 5.07, so option C.

To determine the pH of the solution, we recognize it as a buffer system consisting of a weak acid (HOAc) and its conjugate base (OAc⁻ from NaOAc). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]

1. **Calculate pKa**:  
   Given \( K_a = 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \),  
   \[
   \text{pKa} = -\log(1.75 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.757
   \]

2. **Determine concentrations**:  
   The solution contains \( [\text{HA}] = 0.10 \, \text{M} \) (HOAc) and \( [\text{A}^-] = 0.20 \, \text{M} \) (OAc⁻ from NaOAc).

3. **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 4.757 + \log\left(\frac{0.20}{0.10}\right) = 4.757 + \log(2)
   \]
   Since \( \log(2) \approx 0.301 \),  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 4.757 + 0.301 = 5.058
   \]

4. **Round the result**:  
   The pH is approximately \( 5.06 \), which aligns with option \( C \) as \( 5.07 \).
