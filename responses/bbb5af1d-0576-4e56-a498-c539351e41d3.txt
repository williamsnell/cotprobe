Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 5% to 50%. I'm a bit rusty on the exact figures, but I'll try to recall what I know.

I remember that in recent years, extreme poverty rates have been decreasing globally. I think the World Bank or some international organization tracks this data. From what I've heard before, the percentage has gone down significantly in the past couple of decades. 

Let me think about the numbers. I think around 2015, the poverty rate was around 10%, and it's been decreasing further. Wait, but I might be mixing up the years. Maybe it's even lower now? Or was it lower in 2019?

I recall that China has made a huge impact in reducing poverty. A lot of people there have moved out of extreme poverty, so that would bring down the global average. Also, countries in other regions like Southeast Asia and parts of Africa have seen improvements, though some areas still struggle.

So, if the global rate was around 10% a few years back, maybe by 2019 it's even lower. But I'm not sure if it's exactly 10% or if it's a bit higher. I think I've heard that it's about 8-10%, but that's from a couple of years ago. Maybe it's a bit higher in 2019 because of economic factors or other issues?

Looking at the options, B is 10%, which might be a possible answer. I'm also considering E, which is 5%, but that seems too low. I don't think the global rate has dropped to 5% yet. Option F is 20%, which seems too high if the trend is downward. So, between B (10%) and maybe another option.

Wait, I think in 2019, the World Bank reported that about 9.2% of the global population lived on less than $1.90 a day. That's close to 10%, so option B would be the right choice. I don't remember it being higher than 10%, and 5% is probably too optimistic for 2019.
