Okay, so I've got this question about when the gender of a fetus becomes clear from the appearance of the external genitals. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timing, but I'll try to think it through. 

I remember that in biology class, we talked about fetal development stages. The first few months are crucial for organ development. The question is about when the external genitals become distinct enough to determine the gender. 

From what I recall, during the first trimester, the fetus is developing internal organs and other basic structures. The external genitalia start to form, but they might not be clearly male or female until later. I think it's around the third or fourth month, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again. Conception happens, and by the end of the first month, the embryo is developing into a fetus. By the second month, the basic body plan is set, and some external features start to appear, but the genitalia might still be too early to tell. 

I think the key point is that the external genitals become visible and distinct enough for gender determination around the third or fourth month. So looking at the options, option C is 3, E is 4. I'm leaning towards around 3 months, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bit later, like 4 months.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in ultrasounds, they can sometimes get an idea of gender around 16-20 weeks, which is about 4 months. So that would be option E, 4 months. But I'm a bit confused because I think sometimes it's a bit earlier, but maybe the external features aren't clearly defined until then.

Alternatively, I read somewhere that the development of external genitalia is more pronounced by the third month. So maybe option C is correct. Hmm, I'm a bit torn. I think the answer is either C or E. 

Let me try to recall the timeline. The first trimester is up to 12 weeks. By about 12 weeks, the fetus is around 3 months old, and the external genitalia should be forming. So maybe by 3 months, the gender can be determined. But I'm not sure if it's that early. I think it's more accurate to say that the gender becomes clear around 4 months, so option E.
