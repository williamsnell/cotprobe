Question:

Distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes.

Options:

A: Structural proteins provide temporary cellular functions, while functional proteins provide permanent structure to cells
B: Structural proteins control cell activity while functional proteins are part of the cell protoplasm
C: Structural proteins catalyze chemical reactions while functional proteins are involved in the structure of the cell
D: Structural proteins are soluble in the cell while functional proteins are generally insoluble
E: Structural proteins are found only outside the cell, while functional proteins are exclusively found inside the cell
F: Structural proteins are only used for muscle contraction, while functional proteins are responsible for energy production
G: Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth, while functional proteins control cell activity such as hormone production or nutrient metabolism.
H: Structural proteins are unable to catalyze any reactions, while functional proteins form the structural components of ribosomes
I: Structural proteins are synthesized from amino acids in the cytoplasm, while functional proteins are synthesized in the nucleus
J: Structural proteins are produced by free ribosomes, while functional proteins are produced by membrane-bound ribosomes

Okay, so I have this question about proteins produced by ribosomes and I need to distinguish between two types. Hmm, I remember that ribosomes make proteins, but there are different kinds of proteins. Let me think about what I learned before.

Wait, I think proteins are either structural or functional. Structural proteins probably help in building structures in the cell, like the cytoskeleton or something. Functional proteins must be enzymes or other proteins that do specific jobs, like catalyzing reactions or signaling.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly describes this difference. Let's read through each option.

Option A says structural proteins provide temporary functions, while functional ones provide permanent structure. That doesn't sound right. I thought structural proteins are the ones that make structures, so maybe this is the other way around. So probably A is wrong.

Option B: Structural proteins control cell activity, functional are part of the protoplasm. No, that doesn't fit. Control cell activity sounds more like functional proteins, like enzymes or hormones. Structural proteins would be part of the structure, like in the cytoplasm's structure, so B might be incorrect.

Option C: Structural proteins catalyze reactions, functional are involved in structure. Wait, no, that's opposite. Catalyzing reactions is what enzymes do, which are functional proteins. Structural proteins build structures, so C is wrong.

Option D: Structural proteins are soluble, functional are insoluble. I'm not sure about this. I think some structural proteins might be part of the cytoplasm and could be soluble, but I'm not certain. Maybe D isn't the right choice.

Option E: Structural only outside, functional inside. No, I know that structural proteins are inside too, like in the cytoskeleton. So E is wrong.

Option F: Structural only for muscle contraction, functional for energy. That seems too limited. Structural proteins do more than just muscle contraction, and functional proteins do more than energy production. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Structural are part of protoplasm and contribute to growth, functional control activity like hormones or metabolism. That makes sense. Structural proteins are part of the cell's structure and help with growth, while functional proteins manage activities like hormone production and nutrient breakdown. So G sounds right.

Option H: Structural can't catalyze reactions, functional form ribosome structures. Wait, functional proteins include enzymes which do catalyze reactions. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Structural synthesized in cytoplasm, functional in nucleus. No, both are made in the cytoplasm, except for some that might be imported. So I is wrong.

Option J: Structural by free ribosomes, functional by membrane-bound. Oh, I think this is correct. Free ribosomes make proteins that stay in the cytoplasm (like structural proteins), while membrane-bound ribosomes make proteins destined for secretion or membranes, which are functional. So J could be right.

Wait, but earlier I thought G was correct. Now I'm confused. Let me think again.

Structural proteins are part of the cell's structure, like actin and tubulin. These are made by free ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Functional proteins, such as enzymes or membrane proteins, are made by ribosomes attached to the ER (membrane-bound), which then go to the Golgi for processing.

So J says structural proteins are produced by free ribosomes, functional by membrane-bound. That seems accurate. But what about G? G says structural proteins are part of the protoplasm and contribute to growth, functional control activities like hormone production. That also sounds correct.

Wait, so which option is right? The question is about the types of proteins produced by ribosomes. Both G and J seem to address different aspects. But the question is about distinguishing between the two types based on their function or location of synthesis.

I think the correct answer is J because it's about how and where the proteins are made. Structural proteins are made by free ribosomes (so they stay in the cytoplasm), while functional proteins are made by ribosomes attached to the ER and are secreted or used in membranes.

Alternatively, G describes their roles: structural for structure and growth, functional for control activities. Both G and J seem correct, but I need to choose the best option.

Wait, the question is about the types of proteins produced; perhaps it's about their functions. So G is about their functions, J about their synthesis location.

Looking back at the options, the question is "distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes." So the distinction is about their roles. So G talks about their functions, while J talks about how they're synthesized.

Wait, but the options are about the types of proteins. So perhaps J is correct because it's about the destination of the proteins. Structural proteins are cytosolic, made by free ribosomes, while functional are secreted or membrane, made by membrane-bound.

I think J is the correct answer because it correctly identifies that structural proteins are made by free ribosomes and functional by membrane-bound. So the answer is J.

The question asks to distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes. Structural proteins are involved in building cellular structures, such as the cytoskeleton, and are typically synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Functional proteins, on the other hand, are responsible for specific cellular activities, such as catalyzing reactions or hormone production, and are synthesized by membrane-bound ribosomes. This distinction is best captured in option J, which correctly identifies the types of ribosomes responsible for each protein type based on their synthesis location and function.

Answer: J
