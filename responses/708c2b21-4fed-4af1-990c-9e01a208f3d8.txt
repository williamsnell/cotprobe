Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the force on the bottom of an aquarium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the aquarium has a base that's 1 foot by 2 feet. So the base area must be 1 ft multiplied by 2 ft, which is 2 square feet. Got that. The water depth is one foot deep. So the water is filling up one foot high in this aquarium.

Wait, I remember that the force exerted by a fluid on a surface is related to the pressure of the fluid. Pressure in fluids increases with depth, right? The formula for pressure at a certain depth is P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the depth.

But wait, the force isn't just pressure; force is pressure multiplied by the area, right? So Force = P * A. That makes sense because pressure can vary across a surface, so integrating over the area gives the total force. But in this case, since the aquarium has a uniform depth, maybe I can calculate the average pressure and multiply by the area.

Wait, no. Actually, for a flat surface submerged vertically, the pressure varies with depth. So the average pressure would be the pressure at the top plus the pressure at the bottom, divided by two. Because pressure increases linearly with depth. So the average pressure would be (P_top + P_bottom)/2. Then the force would be average pressure multiplied by the area.

Let me see. The top of the water is at depth 0, so pressure there would be atmospheric pressure, which we usually neglect in these kinds of problems because we're only considering the pressure due to the water. So P_top is zero, and P_bottom is ρgh. So the average pressure would be (0 + ρgh)/2 = (ρgh)/2.

So then, the force F would be (ρgh)/2 multiplied by the area A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the formula for force on a submerged surface is the pressure at the centroid multiplied by the area. The centroid is at half the depth, so yeah, that's the same as the average pressure approach. So that's correct.

So I need to find the density of water, gravity, the depth, and the area.

First, let's convert everything to consistent units. Since the measurements are in feet, maybe I should convert them to meters? Or perhaps use the appropriate units for the density.

Wait, the density of water is typically given in kg/m³, but maybe I can find it in pounds per cubic foot because the measurements are in feet, which might make the calculations easier.

Yes, I think that's better. Let me recall: the density of water is about 62.4 pounds per cubic foot (lb/ft³). So ρ = 62.4 lb/ft³.

Gravity, g, is approximately 32.2 ft/s² in the English system.

The depth h is 1 foot.

So plugging into the formula: P = ρgh.

Wait, but wait—using the units, since ρ is in lb/ft³, and g is in ft/s², the units would be (lb/ft³) * ft/s² * ft = (lb/ft²) * ft = lb/ft²? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, actually, the units for pressure in the English system are pounds per square foot (psf). So when I calculate ρgh, let's see:

ρ is 62.4 lb/ft³,

g is 32.2 ft/s²,

h is 1 ft.

Multiplying them: (62.4 lb/ft³) * (32.2 ft/s²) * (1 ft) = ?

Let me calculate that:

62.4 * 32.2 = let's see, 60*32=1920, 2.4*32=76.8, so 1920+76.8=1996.8, and then 62.4 * 0.2 = 12.48, so total is 1996.8 + 12.48 = 2009.28? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 32.2 is 32 + 0.2, so 62.4 *32= 1996.8, and 62.4 *0.2=12.48. So total is 1996.8 +12.48= 2009.28 lb/(ft² s²) * ft? Hmm, not sure about the units here. Wait, actually, maybe I should think of it as force per unit area, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average pressure first.

Average pressure P_avg = (ρgh)/2 = (62.4 lb/ft³ * 32.2 ft/s² * 1 ft)/2.

Let me compute that:

62.4 *32.2 = let's do 60*32 = 1920, 60*0.2=12, 2.4*32=76.8, 2.4*0.2=0.48. So adding up:

1920 + 12 = 1932,

76.8 + 0.48 = 77.28,

Total 1932 +77.28= 2009.28 lb/(ft² s²) * ft? Wait, no, perhaps better to compute the actual value.

Wait, 62.4 *32.2 = ?

Let me compute 62.4 *32.2.

32.2 can be written as 32 + 0.2.

62.4 *32 = 62.4 *30=1872, 62.4 *2=124.8 → 1872+124.8=1996.8.

62.4 *0.2=12.48.

So total is 1996.8 +12.48=2009.28 lb/(ft³ * ft/s² * ft). Wait, but units would be lb/(ft² s²) * ft → lb/(ft s²) ? That doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting confused with units here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The pressure at depth h is P = ρgh. The units would be (lb/ft³) * (ft/s²) * (ft) = (lb/ft²). Because lb is a force, so lb/ft² is pressure.

So ρgh is 62.4 lb/ft³ * 32.2 ft/s² * 1 ft = ?

Let me compute that:

62.4 *32.2 = 62.4 *30=1872, 62.4 *2.2=137.28 → total 1872 +137.28 = 2009.28 lb/ft².

Wait, no, because 32.2 is ft/s², and h is 1 ft.

Wait, 62.4 lb/ft³ * 32.2 ft/s² * 1 ft = (lb/ft³) * (ft/s²) * ft = lb/(ft² s²) * ft → Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe it's better to just compute the numerical value correctly without worrying about units for now.

So 62.4 *32.2 = 2009.28. Then multiply by 1, so 2009.28 lb/ft²·s²? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard formula. The force on a submerged surface is the area times the average pressure. The average pressure is (ρgh)/2. So F = A*(ρgh)/2.

So A is 2 ft² (since base is 1x2ft), h is 1 ft, so:

F = 2 ft² * (62.4 lb/ft³) * 32.2 ft/s² * 1 ft / 2.

Wait, the division by 2 comes from the average pressure, as I thought earlier.

So let's compute:

First, calculate (62.4) * (32.2) * (1) → that's 62.4 *32.2 = 2009.28.

Then multiply by 2 (the area) → 2009.28 *2 = 4018.56.

Then divide by 2 (from the average pressure) → 4018.56 /2 = 2009.28 lb.

Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the highest is 374.4 lb (option A). So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back.

The correct formula for the force on a submerged flat surface is F = ρ * g * h * A, but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the force is the integral of pressure over the area. Since pressure varies with depth, the average pressure is (P_top + P_bottom)/2, which is (0 + ρgh)/2. So F = average pressure * area = (ρgh/2) * A.

So let me plug in the numbers again.

ρ = 62.4 lb/ft³,

g = 32.2 ft/s²,

h = 1 ft,

A = 1 ft * 2 ft = 2 ft².

So F = (62.4 lb/ft³) * (32.2 ft/s²) * (1 ft) * (2 ft²) / 2.

Wait, so the 2 from the area and the /2 from the average pressure cancel each other out. So it's F = 62.4 *32.2 *1 *2 / 2.

Which simplifies to F = 62.4 *32.2 *1.

So 62.4 *32.2 = let me calculate that again.

62 *32 = 1984,

62 *0.2=12.4,

0.4*32=12.8,

0.4*0.2=0.08.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 62.4 *32.2.

32.2 = 30 + 2 + 0.2.

62.4 *30 = 1872,

62.4 *2 = 124.8,

62.4 *0.2 = 12.48.

Adding them together: 1872 +124.8 = 1996.8; 1996.8 +12.48=2009.28.

So F = 2009.28 lb.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. The options go up to 374.4 lb. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check the units again.

Wait, in the English system, density is often expressed as slugs per cubic foot because slug is the unit of mass. Oh wait, I'm confusing myself. Wait, in the English system, the density of water is actually 62.4 pounds per cubic foot, but pounds can be a bit tricky because they can represent force (lb_f) or mass (lb_m). Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong density.

Wait, no, in the English system, when we use lb/ft³ for density, it's actually lb_m/ft³, but that's not standard. Wait, no, actually, the standard density of water is 62.4 lb_f·s²/ft⁴, which is equivalent to 62.4 lb/ft³ when considering pressure. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the metric system for this calculation. Let's try converting everything to meters and kilograms.

Density of water, ρ = 1000 kg/m³,

g = 9.81 m/s²,

Depth h = 1 ft = 0.3048 meters.

Area A = 1 ft * 2 ft = 0.3048 m * 0.6096 m ≈ 0.1858 m².

Pressure at the bottom P = ρgh = 1000 *9.81 *0.3048 ≈ 1000 *9.81 *0.3048 ≈ let's compute 9.81 *0.3048 ≈ 2.982, so P ≈ 1000 *2.982 ≈ 2982 Pa.

Wait, but then force F = P * A = 2982 Pa * 0.1858 m² ≈ 2982 *0.1858 ≈ let me compute that: 3000 *0.1858 ≈ 557.4, minus 18 *0.1858≈3.344, so approx 554.06 N.

Wait, but that's in Newtons. To convert to pounds, since 1 N ≈ 0.2248 lb_f, so 554.06 *0.2248 ≈ ?

554 *0.2248 ≈ let's compute:

500 *0.2248 = 112.4,

54 *0.2248 ≈ 12.13,

So total ≈ 112.4 +12.13 = 124.53 lb.

Looking at the options, option D is 124.8 lb. That's very close. So maybe the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier when I tried using the English system, I got 2009 lb, which was way off. So perhaps I made a mistake in the English system approach.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the English system calculation, perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Let me think again. The formula for force on a submerged vertical surface is F = ρ * g * A * h, but that's not correct. Wait, no, that's for a horizontal surface. For a vertical surface, the pressure varies with depth, so the force is the integral from 0 to h of (ρ * g * y) * width(y) dy. But in this case, the aquarium's base is a rectangle, so the width is constant. So the integral becomes ρ * g * width * ∫ y dy from 0 to h.

Wait, the aquarium's base is 1 ft by 2 ft. So if it's 1 ft in the vertical direction and 2 ft in the horizontal, then the width would be 2 ft, and the depth is 1 ft. So the force would be the integral from y=0 to y=1 of (ρ * g * y) * 2 dy.

So integrating y dy from 0 to1 is (1/2)y² evaluated from 0 to1, which is 1/2.

So F = ρ * g * 2 * (1/2) = ρ * g * 1.

So F = ρ * g * 1 ft.

Wait, but ρ is in lb/ft³, g in ft/s², so F would be lb/ft³ * ft/s² * ft = lb/ft² * ft → which is lb·ft/s², which is lb_f (since lb_f is a force unit, equivalent to lb·ft/s²).

So F = 62.4 lb/ft³ * 32.2 ft/s² * 1 ft = 62.4 *32.2 = 2009.28 lb_f.

But that's way off from the metric calculation of about 124.8 lb. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait a minute, perhaps the aquarium's base is 1 ft by 2 ft, but the depth is 1 ft, so the water is filling the base to 1 ft. So the aquarium is a rectangular prism, 1 ft wide, 2 ft long, and 1 ft deep. So the base is at the bottom, and the water is 1 ft high.

Wait, but when considering the force on the base, which is the bottom, the base is at a depth of 1 ft. So the pressure at the base is P = ρgh. So the pressure is uniform across the base, so force is P * A.

Wait, that's a different approach. Because if the base is at depth h, and the surface is horizontal, then the pressure at the base is uniform. So the force is simply P * A.

So in that case, F = ρgh * A.

So let me compute that.

ρ = 62.4 lb/ft³,

g = 32.2 ft/s²,

h =1 ft,

A = 1 ft *2 ft = 2 ft².

So F = 62.4 *32.2 *1 *2 = 62.4 *32.2 = 2009.28 *2 = 4018.56 lb_f.

But that's even higher, which can't be right because the metric system gave me about 124.8 lb, which is option D.

Wait, now I'm really confused. What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Let me make sure about the units for density in the English system.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in using the density in lb/ft³. Because in the English system, the correct density of water is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot, but that's in terms of mass or force?

Wait, no, in the English system, the density is often expressed as slugs per cubic foot, because a slug is the unit of mass. 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So the density of water is approximately 2.2046 slugs/ft³. Because 1 slug ≈ 32.174 lb, so 2.2046 slugs/ft³ would be equivalent to 62.4 lb/ft³.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Because when using the formula P = ρgh, ρ should be in mass density, which in the English system is slugs/ft³. So perhaps I should have used 2.2046 slugs/ft³ instead of 62.4 lb/ft³.

Let me try that approach. So ρ = 2.2046 slugs/ft³,

g = 32.2 ft/s²,

h =1 ft,

A =2 ft².

So P = ρgh = 2.2046 *32.2 *1 = 71.0 lb/ft².

Because pressure P in the English system is lb/ft².

Then force F = P * A =71.0 lb/ft² *2 ft² =142 lb.

Hmm, 142 isn't one of the options. But option D is 124.8 lb. Close, but not exact. Maybe I used an approximate value for ρ.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is different. Let me check.

Wait, the exact density of water in slugs per cubic foot is 62.4 lb/ft³ divided by 32.174 ft/s² (since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft). So 62.4 lb/ft³ /32.174 ft/s² ≈ 1.94 slugs/ft³. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Because 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft. So to convert lb/ft³ to slugs/ft³, you divide by g in ft/s².

So ρ_slugs = ρ_lb/(g) = 62.4 lb/ft³ /32.2 ft/s² ≈ 1.938 slugs/ft³.

So P = ρ_slugs *g *h =1.938 *32.2 *1 ≈ 1.938 *32.2 ≈ let's compute that.

1.938 *30=58.14,

1.938 *2.2≈4.2636,

Total≈58.14 +4.2636≈62.4036 lb/ft².

So P ≈62.4036 lb/ft².

Then F = P * A =62.4036 lb/ft² *2 ft² ≈124.807 lb.

Which is approximately 124.8 lb, which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense now. So my initial mistake was using the density in lb/ft³ directly without converting it to slugs/ft³, which is the correct unit for mass density in the English system when using the formula P = ρgh.

So the correct answer is D: 124.8 lb.
</think>

To find the force acting on the bottom of the aquarium, we use the formula for fluid force on a submerged surface: 

\[
F = \rho \cdot g \cdot h \cdot A
\]

Where:
- \( \rho \) is the density of water,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( h \) is the depth of the water,
- \( A \) is the area of the base.

### Step 1: Convert Units
In the English system:
- \( \rho = 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \),
- \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \),
- \( h = 1 \, \text{ft} \),
- \( A = 1 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 2 \, \text{ft}^2 \).

### Step 2: Calculate Pressure
The pressure at the bottom of the aquarium is given by:

\[
P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h = 62.4 \cdot 32.2 \cdot 1 = 2009.28 \, \text{lb/ft}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Force
The force is the pressure multiplied by the area:

\[
F = P \cdot A = 2009.28 \cdot 2 = 4018.56 \, \text{lb}
\]

This result is inconsistent with the provided options, indicating a mistake in the approach. Revisiting the calculation using the correct density in slugs/ft³:

- \( \rho = \frac{62.4}{32.2} \approx 1.938 \, \text{slugs/ft}^3 \),
- \( P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h = 1.938 \cdot 32.2 \cdot 1 \approx 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^2 \),
- \( F = P \cdot A = 62.4 \cdot 2 = 124.8 \, \text{lb} \).

Thus, the correct force is **124.8 lb**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
