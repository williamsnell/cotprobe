Question:

Mr. Samuels purchased 50 shares of stock when the round lot price was 146(1/8). The odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point. Using the table of Brokerage Rates below, calculate the Commission on the sale. BROKERAGE RATES ON ODD LOTS Amount of Purchase Commission $100 - $799 2.0% plus $4.40 up to $65 $800 - $2,499 1.3% plus $10 up to $65 $2,500 and above .9% plus $20 up to $65

Options:

A: $85.87
B: $92.50
C: $75.25
D: $7,318.75
E: $49.99
F: $65
G: $20
H: $110
I: $35
J: $57.50

Okay, so I need to figure out the commission Mr. Samuels has to pay when he sells his shares. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, he bought 50 shares of stock. The price per share was 146 and 1/8. Wait, what's 1/8 in decimal? I think it's 0.125, so 146.125 per share. To find the total purchase amount, I multiply the number of shares by the price per share. That would be 50 * 146.125. Let me calculate that: 50 times 146 is 7300, and 50 times 0.125 is 6.25. So total is 7306.25 dollars. 

But wait, the question is about the sale, not the purchase. Oh right, the problem mentions the odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point. An odd lot is when you buy or sell less than a round lot, which is usually 100 shares. Since he bought 50 shares, that's an odd lot. 

The odd-lot differential is a price difference per share. So 1/4 of a point is $0.25 per share. But I'm not sure if this affects the commission calculation. Maybe it's part of the sale price, but the commission is based on the brokerage rates provided.

Looking at the brokerage table: 

- For amounts between $100 and $799, the commission is 2.0% plus $4.40, up to a maximum of $65.
- For $800 to $2,499, it's 1.3% plus $10, up to $65.
- $2,500 and above: 0.9% plus $20, up to $65.

Wait, but the maximum commission is $65 in all cases. So regardless of the calculation, the commission can't exceed $65.

Now, the sale amount. When he sells, the price per share would be adjusted by the odd-lot differential. So the selling price per share is 146.125 plus 0.25, which is 146.375. But wait, no, the problem says the odd-lot differential is on the sale. Maybe it's a discount or a surcharge. Since he's selling, perhaps it's a differential added to the price per share. So the selling price is higher by 0.25 per share.

So the total sale proceeds would be 50 shares * 146.375. Let me calculate that. 50 * 146 = 7300, 50 * 0.375 = 18.75. So total is 7318.75 dollars.

But wait, wait, the commission is based on the amount of the purchase, right? Or the sale? The question says "calculate the Commission on the sale." So I think the commission is based on the sale amount. 

Wait, no. Let me recheck the brokerage rates. The rates are based on the amount of the purchase. So perhaps the commission is calculated on the purchase amount, not the sale. Because he's selling, but the commission is based on the original purchase amount. Or is it based on the sale proceeds? Hmm, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

"Using the table of Brokerage Rates below, calculate the Commission on the sale." The table is about "BROKERAGE RATES ON ODD LOTS Amount of Purchase Commission..." So the commission is based on the amount of the purchase, not the sale. So the purchase was 50 shares at 146.125, which is $7,306.25. 

Wait, no, the purchase amount is 7306.25. But the sale proceeds are 7318.75. But the commission is based on the purchase amount, as per the table. So the commission would be based on $7,306.25.

Looking at the table, the purchase amount is over $2,500, so the rate is 0.9% plus $20, but up to $65. So let's calculate 0.9% of 7306.25. That's 0.009 * 7306.25. Let me compute that: 7306.25 * 0.009. 7000 *0.009=63, 306.25*0.009=2.75625. So total is approximately 65.75625. Then add $20: 65.75625 +20=85.75625. But wait, the maximum is $65. So the commission is capped at $65.

Wait, but wait. Let me read the table again. It says "up to $65." So if the calculation is more than $65, the commission is $65. So in this case, 0.9% of 7306.25 is around 65.75, which is over 65, so the commission is $65.

But wait, the options don't have $65 as an option. Wait, looking at the options, option F is $65. So is that the answer? But wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The brokerage rates are for the purchase amount, but the commission is on the sale. Maybe the sale amount is considered for commission. Let's check that.

If the sale proceeds are $7,318.75, which is over $2,500, so 0.9% plus $20, but wait, the cap is $65. Let me calculate 0.9% of 7318.75: 7318.75 *0.009=65.86875. Plus $20 would be 85.86875, which is way over 65. So the commission would be $65. But again, option F is $65.

Wait, but the options include F: $65. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me go back to the question. It says "the odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point." So the selling price per share is higher. But does that affect the commission? Because the commission structure is based on the amount of the purchase, not the sale. Or is it based on the sale proceeds?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again: "calculate the Commission on the sale." The table is called "Brokerage Rates on Odd Lots," and the rates are based on the "Amount of Purchase." So perhaps the purchase amount is what's used to calculate the commission. So the purchase amount is 7306.25, which is over $2,500, so 0.9% +20, but the max is $65. So the commission is $65.

But the options include F: $65. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the commission is based on the purchase or the sale. If it's based on the sale, then the sale amount is 7318.75, which is also over $2,500. 0.9% is 65.86875, plus $20 would be 85.86875, but capped at $65. So again, $65.

Alternatively, perhaps the commission is calculated on the sale amount, but the rates are based on the purchase amount. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, another approach: maybe the commission is based on the sale proceeds. So the sale proceeds are 7318.75. Looking at the table, the first tier is up to $799, then 800-2499, then 2500+. So 7318.75 is in the 2500+ tier. So 0.9% plus $20, but the maximum is $65. So 0.9% of 7318.75 is 65.86875. Adding $20 gives 85.86875, but since the max is $65, the commission is $65.

So the answer should be F: $65.

But wait, looking at the options, F is $65. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thought: when selling, perhaps the commission is based on the selling price, not the purchase price. Because the commission is for the sale. So if the sale proceeds are 7318.75, then the commission is based on that amount.

So 0.9% of 7318.75 is approximately 65.86875, plus $20 is 85.86875. But the max is $65, so commission is $65.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is F: $65.
</think>

The commission is calculated based on the sale proceeds of $7,318.75. Using the brokerage rate for amounts over $2,500, the commission is 0.9% of the sale amount plus $20, which totals approximately $85.87. However, the maximum commission cap is $65. Therefore, the commission is $65.

Answer: F
