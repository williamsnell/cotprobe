Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which procedure an accountant is least likely to perform when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that nonissuers are companies that don't issue public securities, so their financial statements aren't subject to the same level of scrutiny as public companies. But accountants still need to perform due diligence to ensure the statements are accurate and reliable.

Looking at the options:

A: Assessing risk management. That sounds relevant because understanding where the company's risks lie can help identify potential areas for misstatements.

B: Inquiring of management about board actions. Board meetings are crucial for strategic decisions, so this makes sense as part of the review process.

C: Identifying internal controls. Internal controls are key to preventing or detecting errors or fraud, so this is definitely something an accountant would do.

D: Studying relationships of financial elements for predictable patterns. This seems a bit abstract. I'm not sure how common it is to look for patterns in the financials beyond standard analysis. Maybe this is more about detecting anomalies, but I'm not certain.

E: Reviewing tax returns. Tax compliance is part of the financial review, especially since taxes can impact the financial statements. So this is likely done.

F: Interviewing employees. Talking to employees, especially those involved in financial processes, helps in understanding how things work and can uncover issues. So this is probably done.

G: Evaluating compliance with regulations. Nonissuers still have to follow laws and regulations, so checking compliance is important.

H: Checking mathematical accuracy. This is a basic part of any audit or reviewâ€”ensuring that the numbers add up correctly.

I: Comparing statements with budgets and forecasts. This helps in assessing the company's performance and can indicate if there are discrepancies that need investigating.

Now, the question is which one is least likely. Option D stands out because it's more about the relationships and patterns in the financial elements. While other options involve direct procedures like interviews, checking controls, and reviewing documents, D seems more like an analytical step that might be done, but perhaps it's not as common or maybe it's more of a preliminary step that's part of the overall analysis rather than a specific procedure an accountant would perform. Alternatively, maybe it's something that's more about trend analysis, which could be part of the review but perhaps less so than the others. Or perhaps it's more about how the financial statements relate to each other, which is part of understanding the entity but not a specific procedure an accountant would least likely perform.

Wait, but option I is about comparing with budgets and forecasts, which is a common procedure. So maybe D is the one that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's E or H. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: For nonissuers, the level of assurance is lower than for issuers. So maybe some procedures are not performed as thoroughly. But assessing risk management, internal controls, compliance, interviewing employees, reviewing tax returns, checking math, and comparing to budgets are all standard. So perhaps the least likely is D, studying the relationships of financial elements for predictable patterns. Maybe that's more of an analytical procedure that's done for larger companies or when there's a specific issue, but not necessarily for every nonissuer review.

Alternatively, perhaps D is more about analytical procedures, which are more common in audits. In a review engagement, analytical procedures are still performed but maybe to a lesser extent. So perhaps the accountant is less likely to perform D in a review compared to a full audit. But wait, the question is about the least likely procedure during the engagement to review financial statements. So maybe D is still done, but perhaps not as a primary procedure. Or perhaps it's more about the other options.

Wait, the options are A through I, and the question is which is least likely. So, considering all, D seems to be the least likely because it's more about the patterns and relationships, which might be more of a deeper dive or part of the analytical phase that might not be as emphasized in a review engagement compared to an audit. Alternatively, maybe it's H, checking mathematical accuracy, but that's a basic step, so that's probably done.

I think I'm leaning towards D being the least likely. So the answer would be D.

The accountant is least likely to perform the procedure described in option D. This is because studying the relationships of financial statement elements for predictable patterns is more of an analytical step that may not be as commonly performed in a review engagement for a nonissuer. Other options involve more direct and routine procedures such as assessing risk management, inquiring of management, identifying internal controls, reviewing tax returns, interviewing employees, evaluating compliance, checking mathematical accuracy, and comparing financial statements with budgets and forecasts. These are standard practices in a review engagement, whereas the procedure in D is more specialized and less likely to be part of the routine review process.
