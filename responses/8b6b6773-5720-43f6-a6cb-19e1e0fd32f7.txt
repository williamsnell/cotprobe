Question:

A 2.0 L flask holds 0.40 g of helium gas. If the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, what will the effect on the entropy of the helium be?

Options:

A: It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.
B: It will remain constant as the helium is simply transferred to a larger container.
C: It will remain constant because the volume of the flask does not affect entropy.
D: It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.
E: It will increase as the temperature is held constant.
F: It will decrease as the pressure of the gas will decrease in the larger flask.
G: It will decrease as there will be fewer collisions between the helium molecules in the larger flask.
H: It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.
I: It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.
J: It will increase because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask more often than they did in the smaller flask.

Okay, so I've got this question about entropy when helium gas is moved from a 2.0 L flask to a larger container while keeping the temperature constant. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. When a gas expands, especially under constant temperature, its entropy usually increases. Because when the volume increases, the gas molecules have more space to move around, so they become more spread out, which means higher entropy. 

The question says the helium is evacuated into a larger container, and temperature is constant. So, the number of moles (or molecules) of helium doesn't change; it's just moving from a smaller to a larger volume. I think that when the volume increases, the gas can disperse more, leading to higher entropy.

Looking at the options, option A says entropy increases because the gas is more dispersed. That makes sense. Option B says it remains constant because it's just transferred, but that doesn't consider the effect of volume on entropy. Option D says it remains constant because the number of molecules doesn't change, but the distribution does, so D might not be correct. 

Option E says it increases because temperature is constant, but I think the temperature isn't directly causing the increase; it's the volume change. Option F and G suggest entropy decreases, which doesn't fit because expansion usually increases entropy. Options H and I also suggest decreases, which I don't think is right. Option J says entropy increases because they collide more, but in a larger container, collisions should happen less frequently because there's more space. Wait, no, more space might lead to more collisions because the molecules have more area to move, but that's not necessarily the case. Hmm, maybe J is incorrect because collision frequency doesn't directly determine entropy in this context.

So considering all that, the correct answer should be A: entropy increases because the gas is more dispersed. The larger volume allows the molecules to spread out more, increasing disorder.

The entropy of the helium will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger container.
