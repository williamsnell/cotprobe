B: Mars Odyssey
C: Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN)
D: Phoenix Mars Lander
E: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
F: Mars Express

Okay, so I have this question about a Mars mission, and I need to figure out which one it is. The question says the mission will land on May 25, 2008, and dig a trench into ice-rich soil. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll recall what I know about Mars missions. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Mars Science Laboratory. I think this is Curiosity, which landed in 2012. It's a rover, but I don't remember it digging trenches. It does have a drill, but the main focus is on analyzing rocks and soil, not necessarily digging for ice. So probably not A.

Option B: Mars Odyssey. This was an orbiter, right? It's been around since 2001, providing data from orbit, not landing on Mars. So B is out.

Option C: MAVEN. That's the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, which I believe launched in 2013. It's another orbiter studying the Martian atmosphere, so it doesn't land. So C isn't the answer.

Option D: Phoenix Mars Lander. I remember Phoenix was a lander that touched down in 2008. Let me check the date: May 25, 2008. That matches the question. Phoenix's main mission was to study the Martian arctic, and it did dig trenches using a robotic arm to search for water ice in the soil. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing. So D seems like a strong candidate.

Option E: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. That's another orbiter, launched in 2005. It's been taking high-resolution images from orbit, so it doesn't land. So E is not the one.

Option F: Mars Express. This is a European mission, an orbiter, launched in 2003. It's still operational, but it's not landing on Mars. So F is out.

Option G: Mars Global Surveyor. That was an orbiter from the 90s, I think it stopped working around 2006. Not relevant here.

Option H: Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). Also known as Mangalyaan, launched by India in 2013. It's an orbiter, so no landing. So H is not the answer.

Option I: ExoMars. This is a joint mission between ESA and Roscosmos. The ExoMars rover, I think, is scheduled for launch in 2022 or 2023. But the question is about 2008, so I can rule out I.

Option J: Mars Exploration Rovers. These are Spirit and Opportunity, which landed in 2004. They were rovers, not landers, and they didn't dig trenches for ice. They focused on finding evidence of past water. So J is not the answer.

Putting it all together, the mission that fits the description is Phoenix Mars Lander, option D. It landed on May 25, 2008, and its primary goal was to dig into the soil to search for water ice.

The correct answer is D: Phoenix Mars Lander.
