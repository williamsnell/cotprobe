Okay, so I need to find the mean weight of a sample of rats. The weights given are 2 lbs, 3 lbs, 6 lbs, 8 lbs, and 9 lbs. Hmm, mean is the average, right? So I remember that to find the mean, I have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. 

Let me start by adding the weights. Let's see: 2 plus 3 is 5. Then 5 plus 6 is 11. Next, 11 plus 8 is 19. And then 19 plus 9 is 28. Wait, does that add up correctly? Let me double-check: 2 + 3 = 5, plus 6 is 11, plus 8 is 19, plus 9 is 28. Yep, that's correct. So the total is 28 lbs.

Now, how many rats are there? Let me count: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9. That's five numbers, so five rats. So the mean would be 28 divided by 5. 

Calculating that: 28 รท 5. Let's see, 5 times 5 is 25, which leaves 3, so 5.6. Wait, 5 times 5 is 25, 28 minus 25 is 3, so 3 divided by 5 is 0.6. So 5.6 lbs. 

Looking at the options, I see option F is 5.6 lbs. So the answer should be F.

The mean weight is calculated by adding all weights (28 lbs) and dividing by the number of rats (5), resulting in 5.6 lbs.

Answer: F
