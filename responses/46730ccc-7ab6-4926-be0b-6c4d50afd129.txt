Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about machine learning concepts, specifically about SVMs and Perceptrons with radial basis kernels. I need to figure out whether the two statements are true or false. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its objective function." 

I remember that SVMs are optimization-based algorithms. The key thing about SVMs is that they maximize the margin between the separating hyperplane and the support vectors. This is a convex optimization problem, which means that any local minimum is also a global minimum. So, if the problem is set up correctly and there's a solution (meaning the data is separable in the transformed feature space), SVM should find the global optimum. So, I think Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: "After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space (though we can’t guarantee this)."

Radial basis functions (RBF) are a type of kernel used in algorithms like SVM and also in kernelized Perceptrons. The idea is that by mapping the data into a higher-dimensional space, the model can find a separating hyperplane that wasn't possible in the original space. The Perceptron algorithm without a kernel can only find a linear separator in the original space. But with an RBF kernel, it's effectively using a non-linear decision boundary in the original space by learning in a higher-dimensional space. 

So, does using an RBF kernel in a Perceptron improve performance? Well, it's possible because it allows the model to capture more complex patterns. However, the Perceptron with a kernel isn't guaranteed to converge if the data isn't linearly separable in the new feature space. Wait, but the statement says it "may" achieve better performance, so that's a possibility. The key here is the word "may," which implies that it's possible but not guaranteed. So Statement 2 is true because it correctly states that it's possible (not guaranteed) to have better performance.

Wait, but I should double-check. The Perceptron algorithm with a kernel is essentially the same as the kernelized version, which is similar to SVM in a way. But the Perceptron doesn't optimize for the maximum margin; it just finds any separating hyperplane. So, if the data is separable in the higher-dimensional space, it might find a better separator than in the original space. But if the data isn't separable even after mapping, it won't converge. However, the statement says it may achieve better performance, which is correct because sometimes it does, but it's not guaranteed for all cases.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is True. Looking at the options, that would be option F: True, True.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Perceptron algorithm is a linear classifier, but when using a kernel, it's still a linear classifier in the feature space. So the decision boundary is linear in Q, but non-linear in the original space. However, the Perceptron doesn't guarantee convergence unless the data is linearly separable in the transformed space. So if the data becomes separable with the RBF kernel, then yes, it can classify better, but if not, it won't. So the statement is correct in saying that it "may" achieve better performance. So Statement 2 is True.

Therefore, both statements are True, so the answer should be F: True, True.

The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis because it solves a convex optimization problem. The Perceptron with an RBF kernel may achieve better classification performance, as the RBF maps data to a higher dimension, potentially allowing a better separator, though it's not guaranteed.
