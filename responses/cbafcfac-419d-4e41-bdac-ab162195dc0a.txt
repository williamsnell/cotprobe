Okay, so I've got this question about which state has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my international law, but let me think through this.

The question is asking about the ordinary jurisdiction for crimes on ships. I remember that ships are considered part of the country they're registered in, right? So like, if a ship is flying the flag of a certain country, that country has some authority over what happens on it. But wait, is that always the case?

I think there's something called the "flag state" which is the country where the vessel is registered. So the flag state usually has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the ship. But wait, what about when the ship is in another country's waters or port? Does the coastal state or port state take over then?

Oh, right! There's the idea of "port jurisdiction." When a ship is in a port, the port state can exercise jurisdiction. So if a crime happens while the ship is in another country's port, that country can step in. But the question is about the "ordinarily" exercised jurisdiction. So maybe it's not just limited to the port state.

Also, there's the concept of "universal jurisdiction" for certain serious crimes like piracy, but I don't think that's the usual case. The question is about crimes in general, not just specific ones.

So, putting it together: the flag state is the primary jurisdiction for crimes on board. But sometimes, the port state can also exercise jurisdiction when the ship is in their waters. Wait, but the question is about which state "ordinarily" does this. So maybe it's the flag state because that's the usual case unless the ship is in another state's port.

Looking at the options, I see option I is the flag state. Option D is the port state. The question is which one is "ordinarily" the case. So I think the answer is the flag state, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the port state can have jurisdiction too.

Wait, I remember the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) says that the flag state has exclusive jurisdiction over crimes on board its vessels, except in cases where the port state can exercise jurisdiction if the crime affects them. But the question is about the ordinary case, so the flag state would be the usual answer.

So the answer should be I: The flag State.

The State that ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels is the flag State, as it is the vessel's registered country and has primary authority over such incidents.

Answer: I
