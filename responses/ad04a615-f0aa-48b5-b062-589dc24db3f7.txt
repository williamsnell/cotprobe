Okay, so I've got this question about chick embryos and the extraembryonic membrane that provides nourishment. Hmm, I remember that in embryology, there are several extraembryonic membranes, each with a specific function. Let me think.

The question is asking which one provides nourishment. I think the options are A to J. Let me go through each one.

A: Amnion – I recall that the amnion forms the amniotic cavity, which surrounds the embryo in amniotes like birds. Its main function is to protect the embryo from mechanical damage and maybe help in the formation of the body axes. But does it provide nourishment? I'm not sure; I think it's more about protection and maybe preventing drying out.

B: Blastoderm – Wait, isn't the blastoderm the early layer of cells that develops into the embryo? Like, in the early stages, it's the structure that starts forming the body. But I don't think it's the one providing nourishment; more about developing into the actual embryo structures.

C: Embryonic disc – That's part of the early embryo, right? In reptiles and birds, the embryonic disc is where the embryo develops, but again, I'm not sure if it's the source of nourishment. Maybe it's more about the structure where the embryo is embedded.

D: Chorion – Oh, the chorion is one I'm a bit confused about. I think the chorion is the outer membrane and it fuses with the amnion to form the amniotic sac. Wait, but in some cases, the chorion might contribute to the formation of the placenta in mammals. But in birds, how does it function? Maybe it's involved in nutrient exchange.

E: Yolk sac – Oh, the yolk sac! I remember that in birds, the yolk sac is crucial. The yolk is the source of nutrition for the embryo. The yolk sac membrane would enclose the yolk, allowing the embryo to absorb nutrients from it. That makes sense because in avian embryos, the yolk is a major nutrient source.

F: Eggshell – The eggshell is the outer layer of the egg, protecting it. It's not a membrane but more like the shell. It might allow gas exchange but doesn't provide nourishment directly.

G: Egg yolk – That's the yellow part inside the egg. The yolk is the actual nutrient, but the question is about the membrane. So the egg yolk itself is the food, but the membrane (yolk sac) is the structure that provides it.

H: Placenta – Wait, birds don't have a placenta like mammals do. The placenta is a mammalian structure for nutrient exchange and development. So in chicks, this isn't applicable.

I: Zona pellucida – That's the clear outer layer of the egg, right? It's involved in preventing polyspermy and is part of the egg's protective layers, but it doesn't provide nourishment.

J: Allantois – The allantois is another membrane. I think it's associated with the formation of the umbilical cord in mammals, but in birds, I'm not sure. Maybe it helps in gas exchange or stores waste, but not the main source of food.

Putting it together: The yolk sac (option E) is the membrane that encloses the yolk, delivering nutrients to the embryo. The chorion (option D) might be involved in some nutrient exchange, but I'm more confident that the yolk sac is the primary source here. 

Wait, another thought: In mammals, the yolk sac is less important because the placenta takes over, but in birds, the yolk is the main food source, so the yolk sac would be the membrane providing that nourishment. So the answer should be E: yolk sac.

The extraembryonic membrane in chick embryos that provides nourishment to the fetus is the yolk sac. This structure encloses the yolk, which serves as the primary nutrient source for the developing embryo.

Answer: E
