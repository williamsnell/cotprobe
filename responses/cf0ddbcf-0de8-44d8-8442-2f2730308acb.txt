Okay, so I need to figure out the units digit of 7 raised to the 25th power. Hmm, units digit... I remember that when you raise numbers to powers, the units digit follows a pattern that repeats every certain number of exponents. So, maybe I can find a pattern in the units digits of powers of 7.

Let me start by calculating the first few powers of 7 and noting their units digits.

7^1 is 7, so the units digit is 7.

7^2 is 49, so the units digit is 9.

7^3 is 343, so the units digit is 3.

7^4 is... let me calculate that. 7^3 is 343, so 343 * 7 is 2401. The units digit here is 1.

7^5 would be 2401 * 7. Let's see, 2400 *7 is 16800, and 1*7 is 7, so 16807. Units digit is 7 again.

Wait a minute, so the units digits are 7, 9, 3, 1, and then back to 7. So the pattern repeats every 4 exponents. That means the cycle is 7, 9, 3, 1, and then repeats.

So the cycle length is 4. Now, to find the units digit of 7^25, I can figure out where 25 falls in this cycle.

Since the cycle repeats every 4, I can divide 25 by 4 and find the remainder. Let's do that: 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1, because 4*6=24 and 25-24=1.

That means 7^25 will have the same units digit as 7^1, which is 7. Wait, but looking back at the cycle: the first position after division with remainder 1 would correspond to the first number in the cycle, which is 7.

Wait, let me double-check. The exponents go like this:

1: 7

2: 9

3:3

4:1

5:7 (which is 4*1 +1, so remainder 1)

6:9 (remainder 2)

7:3 (remainder 3)

8:1 (remainder 0, because 8/4 is 2 with no remainder, so it's the 4th position in the cycle)

So for exponent n, the position in the cycle is determined by n modulo 4.

If n mod 4 is 1, units digit is 7.

If n mod 4 is 2, it's 9.

If n mod 4 is 3, it's 3.

If n mod 4 is 0 (i.e., divisible by 4), it's 1.

So for 25, 25 mod 4 is 1. So units digit is 7.

Wait, but looking back at the options, G is 7. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me confirm with another approach. Maybe using modular arithmetic.

We can write 7^25 mod 10, since we're interested in the units digit, which is equivalent to mod 10.

We can use Euler's theorem, but since 7 and 10 are coprime, Euler's theorem says that 7^φ(10) ≡ 1 mod 10, where φ(10) is Euler's totient function. φ(10)=4 because the numbers less than 10 that are coprime to 10 are 1,3,7,9. So φ(10)=4.

So 7^4 ≡ 1 mod 10.

Then 7^25 can be written as 7^(4*6 +1) = (7^4)^6 * 7^1.

Since 7^4 ≡1 mod10, this becomes 1^6 *7 ≡7 mod10.

So the units digit is 7, which is option G.

The units digit of 7^25 is determined by observing the repeating pattern in the units digits of powers of 7, which cycles every 4 exponents: 7, 9, 3, 1. Since 25 mod 4 is 1, the units digit corresponds to the first number in the cycle, which is 7.

Answer: G
