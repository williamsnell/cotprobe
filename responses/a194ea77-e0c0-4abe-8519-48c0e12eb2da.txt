Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about what's not a component of an agile organization. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall what defines an agile organization. From what I remember, agile methodologies in business focus on being flexible, adaptable, and responsive to change. They usually emphasize collaboration, customer satisfaction, and the ability to quickly deliver products or services.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that doesn't fit with these characteristics. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Market focus and position. Agile organizations are definitely market-focused because they need to adapt to market changes quickly. So this is a component, not the answer.

Option B: Flexibility and adaptability. This is a core aspect of agility. They thrive on being able to change and adapt to new information and market demands. So not the answer.

Option C: Frequent software updates. Hmm, in software development, agile practices do involve frequent updates like sprints and continuous delivery. So this is part of it, not the answer.

Option D: Resistance to change. Wait, resistance to change is the opposite of agility. Agile organizations are supposed to embrace change, not resist it. So this could be the correct answer.

Option E: Traditional hierarchy structure. Agile tends to move away from rigid hierarchies towards more flat or team-based structures. So a traditional hierarchy might not be a component, but I need to check other options too.

Option F: Human resources: multi-skilling. Agile organizations encourage cross-functional teams where members have multiple skills. So this is a component, not the answer.

Option G: Organisational structure. Well, an agile organization does have a structure, but it's more fluid. So this is part of it; not the answer.

Option H: Long-term strategic planning. Wait, agile is more about short-term, iterative planning. Long-term strategic planning might be more aligned with traditional approaches. So this could be a contender.

Option I: Project-based culture. Agile often uses project-based teams, especially in methodologies like Scrum. So this is a component, not the answer.

Option J: Customer satisfaction metrics. Agile focuses heavily on satisfying the customer, so measuring this is part of their approach. Not the answer.

Now, between options D and H. Option D is resistance to change, which is definitely not part of agile. Option H is long-term strategic planning. I think traditional organizations do long-term planning, while agile prefers shorter, iterative plans. So H might also be a correct answer.

Wait, the question is asking what is NOT a component. So both D and H could be possible answers. But looking back, the options are A to J, and I need to choose one.

I think the key here is that resistance to change (D) is the opposite of agility. So it's definitely not a component. Long-term strategic planning (H) might not fit as well, but some agile organizations can have high-level strategies but execute them in sprints. So perhaps H is not as directly contradictory as D.

Therefore, the answer is D: Resistance to change.

The correct answer is D: Resistance to change.
