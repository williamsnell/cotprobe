Okay, I need to figure out the structure of the United Nations Security Council based on the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about the UN Security Council.

I remember that the UN Security Council has 15 members in total. These are divided into two categories: permanent and rotating members. The permanent members have a significant role, including the veto power. 

From what I've studied, there are five permanent members. These are the major powers that were victorious in World War II: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia (previously the Soviet Union), and China. These five have the ability to veto any substantive resolution, which is a key point.

Then, the remaining members are non-permanent and they rotate. I think there are 10 rotating members. These are elected by the General Assembly every two years, and they don't have the veto power. So, the structure is 5 permanent with veto and 10 rotating without.

Looking at the options:

Option G says 5 permanent with veto and 10 rotating without. That matches what I remember. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A: 5 permanent without veto. No, that's wrong because they do have veto power.

Option B: 15 rotating, no veto. No, because there are 5 permanent members.

Option C: 10 permanent with veto, 5 rotating. No, the numbers are reversed.

Option D: 15 with veto. No, only the permanent five have veto.

Option E: 20 members, which is incorrect because it's 15.

Option F: 10 permanent without veto, 5 rotating with. No, again the numbers and veto are wrong.

Option H: 15 permanent with veto. No, only 5 are permanent.

Option I: 7 permanent with veto, 8 rotating. No, it's 5 permanent.

Option J: 5 permanent and 10 rotating, all with veto. No, only the permanent have veto.

So, the correct answer is option G: 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members without.

The United Nations Security Council consists of 15 members: 5 permanent members with veto power (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China) and 10 rotating members without veto power.
