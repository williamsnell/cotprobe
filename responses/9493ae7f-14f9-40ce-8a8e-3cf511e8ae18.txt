Okay, so I've got this question about converting liters-atmospheres to joules. Hmm, I remember that in chemistry, work is often measured in these units, especially when dealing with pressure-volume work. Let me think about what I learned.

I recall that 1 atmosphere is a unit of pressure, and 1 liter is a unit of volume. When you multiply them together, you get a unit of work, specifically pressure-volume work. But I need to convert that to joules because the question is asking for joules equivalent.

Wait, I think the conversion factor is something like 1 L·atm equals approximately 100 joules, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me try to remember any specific numbers. Oh right, I think it's around 101.3 joules because 1 atm is about 101.325 kPa. But wait, that's pressure. How does that relate to work?

Work done is pressure multiplied by the change in volume. So, if you have 1 L·atm, that's like 1 atm multiplied by 1 liter. I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately equal to 101.3 joules. That number sounds familiar from my textbook or maybe a formula sheet.

Let me check the options again. Option E is 101.3 joules. That seems right. But wait, sometimes I get confused between the conversion of 1 atm to joules and 1 L·atm. Because 1 atm is about 101325 pascals, but that's pressure, not work. Work is pressure times volume, so when you have liters (which is volume) times atm (pressure), that gives work in L·atm, which is then converted to joules.

Another thought: 1 joule is 1 Pa·m³. Since 1 atm is about 101325 Pa, and 1 liter is 0.001 m³, so 1 L·atm would be 101325 Pa * 0.001 m³ = 101.325 joules. Oh, so that's exactly 101.325 J. But looking at the options, option E is 101.3, which is the closest. So the answer should be E.

The conversion from 1 L·atm to joules is approximately 101.3 joules. This is because 1 L·atm equals 101325 Pa multiplied by 0.001 m³, which equals 101.325 J. Among the given options, the closest value is 101.3 joules.

Answer: E
