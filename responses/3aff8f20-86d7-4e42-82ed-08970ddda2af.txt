Question:

A fortune teller told fortunes by means of Tarot cards. An elderly woman, who was worried about her failing health, had heard that the fortuneteller was clairvoyant and could see into the future. Consequently, the woman decided to see the fortuneteller in order to have her Tarot cards read. As the fortuneteller was telling the woman her fortune, she suddenly said, "I have a vision. If you give me $25,000 tomorrow, you will live to be 100 years old. " The woman, who was 72 years of age, believed the fortuneteller and gave her the money the next day. The following week, the woman's physician informed her that she had a serious heart disease and he didn't expect her to live for more than a year or two. If the woman asserts a claim against the fortuneteller based on deceit, the plaintiff should

Options:

A: not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed.
B: not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties.
C: prevail, if the fortuneteller had a history of fraudulent activities.
D: prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.
E: not prevail, because the fortuneteller didn't force her to give the money.
F: not prevail, if the woman did not ask for a refund.
G: not prevail, if she cannot prove the fortuneteller's deceit.
H: prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.
I: prevail, if the fortune teller cannot prove her clairvoyant abilities.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about deceit and whether the woman can prevail in her claim against the fortuneteller. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: An elderly woman goes to a fortuneteller who claims to be clairvoyant. The fortuneteller tells her that if she gives $25,000, she'll live to 100. The woman believes this, gives the money, and then her doctor tells her she has a serious heart disease and won't live more than a couple of years. Now she's suing for deceit.

So, the question is about whether the plaintiff (the woman) can win her claim. The options are A through I, each giving a different condition for her to prevail or not.

I remember that in tort law, particularly in deceit or fraud cases, the plaintiff needs to prove certain elements. Let me recall what those elements are. Typically, deceit requires a false statement of fact, made with the intent to deceive, reliance by the plaintiff, and resulting damage.

Looking at the facts, the fortuneteller made a specific prediction that the woman would live to 100 if she paid $25k. The woman believed this and paid, which resulted in her suffering emotional distress and financial loss when the prediction didn't come true. Her doctor's diagnosis suggests that the prediction was false.

Now, the options are about what the plaintiff needs to prove or whether she can prevail based on certain conditions.

Option A: "not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed." Hmm, does the fortuneteller need to have warranted the truth? I'm not sure. Maybe this is about whether there was a guarantee or a promise. But I think the key here is whether the statement was a misrepresentation of fact.

Option B: "not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship." A fiduciary relationship would mean one party has a duty to act in the other's best interest. But a fortuneteller isn't typically a fiduciary. So unless the fortuneteller had a specific role that creates a fiduciary duty, this might not apply. But I'm not certain if the existence of a fiduciary relationship is a requirement here.

Option C: "prevail if the fortuneteller had a history of fraudulent activities." That sounds like it's about the fortuneteller's past behavior. If she had a history, maybe that would show intent to deceive. But does the plaintiff need to prove the defendant's past fraud to win? I'm not sure. It might be relevant, but I don't think it's a necessary condition for the claim to prevail.

Option D: "prevail if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe the prediction." So, if the fortuneteller didn't actually believe the woman would live to 100, that could show intent to deceive. Because if she didn't believe it, she knew it was a lie. So this seems like a valid condition for the plaintiff to win. But is this the only condition?

Option E: "not prevail because the fortuneteller didn't force her to give the money." That seems off. The fact that it wasn't forced doesn't negate deceit. Deceit can happen even if the victim volunteers the information or action, as long as they were tricked.

Option F: "not prevail if she didn't ask for a refund." I don't see how asking for a refund is relevant. Whether she asked for her money back doesn't determine if the fortuneteller was deceitful. It might affect remedies but not liability.

Option G: "not prevail if she cannot prove the fortuneteller's deceit." Well, that's the crux. In any tort case, the plaintiff must prove the elements, including deceit. So if she can't prove the fortuneteller was deceitful, she can't win. But the question is about what she needs to show, not whether she can.

Option H: "prevail because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling." This seems to touch on reliance, which is an element of deceit. If she relied on the statement and was harmed, that would support her claim. So if she can show that she relied and was damaged, she might prevail.

Option I: "prevail if the fortuneteller cannot prove her clairvoyant abilities." That doesn't seem right. The fortuneteller's ability to predict the future isn't the issue here; it's whether she lied about the prediction. Even if the fortuneteller genuinely believed she could see the future, if that belief was wrong, that's a different issue. But the question is about deceit, not whether the clairvoyance actually worked.

Putting it together, the key elements are: false statement, intent to deceive, reliance, and damage. So for the woman to prevail, she needs to show that the fortuneteller made a false statement with the intent to deceive, she relied on it, and was damaged.

Looking at the options, D says she prevails if the fortuneteller didn't honestly believe the prediction. That would mean the fortuneteller knew it was false, satisfying the intent element. H says she prevails if she relied to her detriment, which is another element.

But the question is about what the plaintiff should do. The options are about conditions for her to prevail.

In many jurisdictions, for deceit, the plaintiff must show that the defendant made a false representation with intent to deceive, which the plaintiff relied upon, causing damage. So if the fortuneteller didn't honestly believe the prediction, that shows the intent to deceive. Therefore, D could be a correct condition for her to prevail.

But another angle: in some cases, a statement about the future, even if false, might not be actionable unless it's made with the knowledge that it's false. So if the fortuneteller honestly believed (even if mistakenly) that the woman would live to 100, she might not have the intent to deceive. But if she knew it was a lie, then she did.

So, the woman would need to show that the fortuneteller did not honestly believe her prediction. That is, the fortuneteller knew it was false. If she can prove that, then she can prevail because it shows the intent to deceive.

Option H is about reliance and detriment, which are also necessary. But the question is about what the plaintiff "should" do, i.e., what is a condition for her to win. So both D and H are about conditions, but the question is which one is correct.

Wait, the options are structured as: "the plaintiff should [condition]". So, the correct answer would be the condition that, if met, allows the plaintiff to prevail.

Option D says she prevails if the fortuneteller didn't honestly believe. So if she can prove that, she wins. Similarly, H says she prevails because she relied to her detriment, which is another condition.

But I think the correct approach is that the plaintiff must prove all elements: false statement, intent to deceive, reliance, and damage. So both D and H are necessary conditions, but looking at the options, perhaps the question is more about the intent element.

Wait, the options are separate; each option states a condition. So the correct answer is the condition that, if true, allows the plaintiff to win.

So, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe, that shows intent to deceive. So D is a condition for her to prevail.

Alternatively, H says she relied and was harmed, which is part of the reliance element. But the question is about the plaintiff's assertion of a claim based on deceit. So, the plaintiff must show that the statement was false and that the fortuneteller knew it was false (or didn't honestly believe it), and that the plaintiff relied on it.

So, the correct answer is D: prevail if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe the prediction.

The woman can prevail in her claim against the fortuneteller if she can show that the fortuneteller did not honestly believe the prediction, as this would demonstrate the intent to deceive. 

Answer: D
