Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei when a gamma ray is emitted. The reaction given is (19_8)O* (excited state) → (19_8)O (ground state) + gamma. The energy change ΔE is 1.06 × 10^8 kcal/mole. And I need to find Δm in grams per mole. The options are A through J, so I'll have to pick the right one.

Hmm, alright, let's start by recalling what I know. This seems like a mass-energy equivalence problem. I remember Einstein's equation E=mc², which relates energy and mass. But wait, here the energy is given per mole, so I'll have to handle that carefully.

First, the problem is about the emission of a gamma ray. Gamma rays are high-energy photons emitted when an atom transitions from an excited state to a ground state. The mass difference between the two states would lead to a release of energy, which in this case is the gamma photon.

So, the excited state nucleus (19_8O*) decays to the ground state (19_8O) and emits a gamma photon. The mass of the excited state must be slightly higher than the ground state because when it loses mass (as energy), it emits the gamma.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei. So, if the initial is excited and the final is ground, and the gamma is emitted, I think the initial nucleus (excited) has a higher mass than the final (ground). So, Δm = m_final - m_initial would be negative, which makes sense why the options have negative values.

So, the formula I need is ΔE = Δm * c². But since ΔE is given in kcal/mol, I need to convert that to joules because the mass will be in grams, and c is in m/s. Let me jot that down.

First, let's get the constants right. The speed of light, c, is approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s. But when dealing with energy and mass, sometimes using c² in different units can be helpful. Alternatively, I remember that 1 eV is 1.602 × 10^-19 joules, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go here.

Wait, the energy given is in kcal per mole. I think I can convert kcal to joules. Let me recall: 1 kcal is approximately 4184 joules. So, 1 kcal/mol = 4184 J/mol.

So, ΔE is 1.06 × 10^8 kcal/mol. Let's convert that to joules per mole.

ΔE (J/mol) = 1.06e8 kcal/mol * 4184 J/kcal.

Calculating that: 1.06e8 * 4184 = let's see, 1.06e8 * 4e3 is approximately 4.24e11, but more accurately:

4184 = 4.184e3, so 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = 1.06 * 4.184 * 1e11. 1.06 *4.184 is approximately 4.442, so 4.442e11 J/mol.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.06 * 4.184 = let's compute:

1.06 *4 = 4.24

1.06 *0.184 = approx 0.19424

So total is 4.24 + 0.19424 = 4.43424. So 4.43424e11 J/mol.

Now, using E=Δm c², we can solve for Δm:

Δm = ΔE / (c²)

But wait, units are important. ΔE is in J/mol, so Δm would be in kg/mol, which I can then convert to grams/mol.

So, c² is (2.998e8 m/s)^2 = approx 8.988e16 m²/s².

So,

Δm = (4.43424e11 J/mol) / (8.988e16 m²/s²) )

Because 1 J = 1 kg m²/s². So when we divide J by m²/s², we get kg.

So,

Δm = 4.43424e11 / 8.988e16 = let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e11: 4.43424 / 8.988e5 ≈ 4.43424 / 898800 ≈ approx 4.935e-6 kg/mol.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

4.43424e11 / 8.988e16 = (4.43424 / 8.988) ) * 1e(11-16) )= (0.4935) * 1e-5 = 4.935e-6 kg/mol.

But 1 kg is 1000 g, so in grams, that's 4.935e-3 g/mol.

Wait, that can't be right because 4.935e-6 kg is 4.935e-3 grams. So, Δm = 4.935e-3 g/mol.

But wait, since the excited state is higher in mass, when it decays to the ground state, the mass decreases, so Δm = m_final - m_initial is negative. So the answer would be negative.

So Δm ≈ -4.935e-3 g/mol.

Looking at the options:

Option G is -4.92 ×10^-3 g/mole.

Option J is -5.92 ×10^-3.

Option F is -3.92e-3.

So, 4.93e-3 is closest to option G, which is -4.92e-3.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations because sometimes unit conversions can be tricky.

Wait, let me redo the calculation step by step.

Given:

ΔE = 1.06e8 kcal/mol.

Convert kcal to J:

1 kcal = 4184 J, so 1.06e8 kcal * 4184 J/kcal = ?

1.06e8 * 4184 = Let me compute that accurately.

Compute 1.06 * 4184 = ?

1.06 * 4000 = 4240

1.06 * 184 = 195. 44 (since 184 *1=184, 184*0.06=11.04, total 195.04)

So 4240 + 195.04 = 4435.04.

So 4435.04e8 J = 4.43504e11 J/mol.

Now, E = mc², so m = E/(c²).

c² = (2.998e8 m/s)^2 = approx 8.988e16 m²/s².

So,

m = (4.43504e11 J/mol) / (8.988e16 m²/s²) = (4.43504 / 8.988) )e(11-16) = 0.4935e-5 kg/mol.

Which is 4.935e-6 kg/mol.

Convert kg to grams: 4.935e-6 kg = 4.935e-3 grams.

So Δm = 4.935e-3 g/mol. But since the mass decreases, Δm is negative: -4.935e-3 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option G is -4.92e-3, which is very close.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The problem involves calculating the mass difference between the excited and ground states of an oxygen nucleus when a gamma ray is emitted. Using Einstein's equation \( E = mc^2 \), the energy change \( \Delta E \) is converted from kcal/mol to joules, and the mass difference \( \Delta m \) is determined. After careful calculations, the mass difference is found to be approximately \( -4.93 \times 10^{-3} \) g/mol, which corresponds to option G.
