Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the reflectance of a quarter-wave antireflection film. Hmm, I remember that antireflection coatings are used to reduce the reflection of light when it hits a surface, like on camera lenses or glasses. The idea is to make the surface appear clearer by minimizing the glare.

The question gives me the materials involved: magnesium fluoride with a refractive index of 1.35, and it's coated on optical glass with an index of 1.52. I think the film is a quarter-wave thick, which is important because the thickness determines how the light waves interfere.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here. Oh right, for an antireflection coating, the goal is to have destructive interference between the reflected waves. So when the light hits the coating, part of it reflects off the top surface, and part goes through and reflects off the bottom surface. If the path difference between these two reflections is a quarter wavelength (which is what a quarter-wave film is), they should destructively interfere, reducing the reflection.

But wait, the condition for destructive interference when dealing with thin films is that the path difference is (n2 * 2t) = (lambda/2), where t is the thickness. Since it's a quarter-wave film, the thickness t is lambda/(4n), where lambda is the wavelength in the medium. So 2t would be lambda/(2n), which fits the condition for destructive interference. But wait, no, I think I might have mixed that up. Let me think again. Oh right, for a quarter-wave film, 2t = lambda/(4n) * 2 = lambda/(2n), so the path difference is lambda/(2n), which is a quarter wavelength in air, but maybe that's for a different condition.

Wait, no, the phase shift upon reflection also matters. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees (or pi radians). So, when the light goes from air (n=1) to magnesium fluoride (n=1.35), since 1.35 >1, there's a phase shift. Then, when it reflects off the magnesium fluoride/glass interface, since glass has a higher index (1.52 >1.35), there's another phase shift. So each reflection at a higher index interface causes a phase shift.

Wait, so the first reflection is at the top of the MgF2 film: air to MgF2. Since MgF2 has higher n than air, there's a phase shift of pi. The second reflection is at the MgF2/glass interface. Glass has higher n than MgF2, so another phase shift of pi. So the total phase shift between the two reflected waves is 2pi, which is a full cycle. But wait, the path difference also contributes to phase shift.

The path difference is 2t, because the light goes down and back up, so 2t. And the condition for destructive interference is that the total phase shift (from path difference and reflection) should result in destructive. So the formula for the condition is 2t = (lambda/2n2) * (m + 1/2), where m is an integer. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the phase change.

Alternatively, I remember that for a quarter-wave coating, the formula for the reflectance is given by R = ( (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1) )^2, but that's for the reflected light when the film is designed to minimize reflection. Wait, no, that's the formula for the reflection when you have a single surface, but for a thin film, it's a bit different.

Wait, another approach: The reflectance of the film can be calculated using the formula for a quarter-wave coating. The general formula for the reflectance R is given by R = ( (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1) )^2, where n1 is the substrate's refractive index, and n2 is the coating's. Wait, no, that's when you have a single surface reflection. But in a thin film, the reflection involves both the top and bottom surfaces, so it's a bit more involved.

Let me think again. The condition for destructive interference in a quarter-wave film is that the thickness t is equal to lambda/(4n2), where lambda is the wavelength in vacuum. But the key is that the phase shift upon reflection at each interface plus the phase shift from the path difference leads to destructive interference.

So, the first reflection (air to MgF2) has a phase shift of pi because MgF2 has higher n than air. The second reflection (MgF2 to glass) also has a phase shift of pi because glass has higher n than MgF2. So total phase shift from reflections is 2pi. The path difference is 2t, which in terms of wavelength is 2t * n2 (since in the medium, wavelength is lambda/n). So the path difference in terms of phase is (2t * n2 * 2pi)/lambda. Wait, no: the phase change from the path is (2pi * 2t * n2)/lambda, where lambda is the wavelength in vacuum.

But since t = lambda/(4n2), substituting in gives 2t = lambda/(2n2). So the phase change from the path is (2pi * (lambda/(2n2)) * n2)/lambda) = (2pi * (lambda/(2)) ) / lambda ) = pi. So the path contributes a phase shift of pi.

So the total phase shift is 2pi (from reflections) plus pi (from path) = 3pi. But for destructive interference, the total phase shift should be an odd multiple of pi, which it is (3pi). So that works out. So the two reflected waves are out of phase by pi, leading to destructive interference, thus minimizing reflection.

But wait, the question is about the reflectance, not whether it's constructive or destructive. So the formula for the reflectance when using a quarter-wave coating is given by R = ( (n_substrate - n_coating)/(n_substrate + n_coating) )^2. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.

The reflectance for a single interface can be found using the Fresnel equations. For normal incidence, the reflection coefficient r is (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1), where n1 is the incident medium, n2 is the substrate. But in the case of a thin film, the total reflection is a combination of the two reflections: the first at the air-MgF2 interface and the second at the MgF2-glass interface.

But since the film is a quarter-wave thick and designed for destructive interference, the total reflected light should be minimized. So the formula for the reflectance R would be R = ( (n_air - n_MgF2)/(n_air + n_MgF2) )^2 + ( (n_glass - n_MgF2)/(n_glass + n_MgF2) )^2, but considering the phase shifts.

Wait, no. Because the two reflections interfere destructively, the total reflectance should be approximately the sum of the squares of the individual reflection coefficients, but adjusted for phase. Alternatively, since the two reflections destructively interfere, the total reflectance is the square of the sum of the reflection coefficients, considering their phase.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the reflection coefficients and then find the total reflection considering the phase difference.

So, first reflection: r1 = (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1) where n1 is air (1), n2 is MgF2 (1.35). So r1 = (1.35 -1)/(1.35 +1) = 0.35 / 2.35 ≈ 0.149.

Second reflection: r2 = (n_glass - n_MgF2)/(n_glass + n_MgF2) = (1.52 -1.35)/(1.52 +1.35) = 0.17 / 2.87 ≈ 0.059.

But wait, the second reflection happens after the light has gone through the film twice (down and back up), so the path difference is 2t. As it's a quarter-wave film, t = lambda/(4n2), so 2t = lambda/(2n2). The phase shift due to path is (2pi * 2t * n2)/lambda = (2pi * (lambda/(2n2)) *n2)/lambda = pi. So the path contributes a phase shift of pi.

Additionally, each reflection at a higher index interface causes a phase shift of pi. The first reflection (air to MgF2) is higher index, so phase shift of pi. The second reflection (MgF2 to glass) is higher index again, so another pi. So total phase shift from reflections is 2pi.

So the total phase shift between the two reflected waves is phase_shift = phase from path (pi) + phase from reflections (2pi) = 3pi. Since 3pi is equivalent to pi modulo 2pi, the two reflections are out of phase by pi, leading to destructive interference.

Wait, but when two waves are out of phase by pi, their amplitudes subtract. So the total reflection coefficient R_total is r1 + r2 * e^{i*(phase_shift)}.

Wait, but the phase shift between the two paths is (from path and reflections) 3pi. So e^{i*3pi} = -1. So R_total = r1 + r2 * (-1).

So R_total = r1 - r2.

Then the reflectance is |R_total|^2.

So plugging in the numbers:

r1 ≈ 0.149, r2 ≈ 0.059.

So R_total = 0.149 - 0.059 = 0.09.

Then |R_total|^2 = (0.09)^2 = 0.0081, which is 0.81%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.8%, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the r2 calculation. MgF2 is 1.35, glass is 1.52. So r2 = (1.52 -1.35)/(1.52 +1.35) = 0.17 / 2.87 ≈ 0.0592, which I'll approximate to 0.059.

So R_total = 0.149 - 0.059 = 0.09.

0.09 squared is 0.0081, so 0.81% reflectance, which matches option A: 0.8%.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the reflectance when using a quarter-wave coating is R = ( (n_substrate - n_film)/(n_substrate + n_film) )^2.

Wait, that would be R = (1.52 -1.35)/(1.52 +1.35)^2 = (0.17)/(2.87)^2 ≈ 0.17/(8.2369) ≈ 0.0206, so 2.06%. That's not matching 0.8%.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps I should think again.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. The formula R = ( (n_substrate - n_film)/(n_substrate + n_film) )^2 gives the reflectance when light goes from substrate to film, but in this case, the film is on top of the substrate, so the initial reflection is from air to film, and the second from film to substrate.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the total reflectance when using a quarter-wave coating is R = ( (n_film - n_air)/(n_film + n_air) )^2 * ( (n_substrate - n_film)/(n_substrate + n_film) )^2 + some interference term.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the reflection using the formula for a thin film with quarter-wave thickness. The formula for the minimum reflection (antireflection coating) is when the thickness is a quarter wavelength, which leads to destructive interference.

The formula for the reflectance R can be found by considering the two reflected waves and their interference.

So, R = (r1 + r2 e^{i(2πt n2/λ + phase_shift)})².

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the reflectance when using a quarter-wave coating. The standard formula for a quarter-wave coating is that the reflectance R is given by R = ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2, where n_sub is the substrate's refractive index.

Wait, but in this case, the substrate is glass (n=1.52), and the film is MgF2 (n=1.35). So R = (1.52 -1.35)/(1.52 +1.35))^2 = (0.17/2.87)^2 ≈ (0.0592)^2 ≈ 0.0035, which is 0.35%, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the reflection at each interface and then combine them considering the phase shift.

Wait, first reflection (air to MgF2): r1 = (1.35 -1)/(1.35+1) = 0.35/2.35 ≈ 0.149.

Second reflection (MgF2 to glass): r2 = (1.52 -1.35)/(1.52+1.35) ≈ 0.17/2.87 ≈ 0.059.

The path difference is 2t, and since t = λ/(4n2), 2t = λ/(2n2). So the phase shift from the path is (2π * 2t * n2)/λ = (2π * (λ/(2n2)) * n2)/λ = π.

But each reflection causes a phase shift. The first reflection (air to MgF2) is from lower to higher index, so phase shift of π. The second reflection (MgF2 to glass) is also lower to higher index, so another π. So the total phase shift from reflections is 2π.

Adding the path phase shift of π, the total phase shift is 3π. So when combining the two reflections, the second reflection is delayed by 3π, which is equivalent to π, so it's like a negative of the first reflection.

So the total reflection coefficient R_total is r1 + (-r2) = 0.149 - 0.059 = 0.09.

The reflectance is |R_total|^2 = (0.09)^2 = 0.0081, which is 0.81%, so approximately 0.8%, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the formula gave me 0.81%, which matches option A. But I'm a bit confused because I've seen some sources say that the reflectance of a quarter-wave coating is R = ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2, which in this case would be (1.52-1.35)/(1.52+1.35))^2 = (0.17/2.87)^2 ≈ 0.0035, or 0.35%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again. When you have a quarter-wave coating, the reflection is minimized, and the formula for the minimum reflection is R = ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2, but perhaps that's when the film is on a substrate with higher index than the film. Wait, in this case, the film (n=1.35) is on glass (n=1.52), which is higher, so the formula applies.

So R would be (1.52-1.35)/(1.52+1.35))^2 = (0.17/2.87)^2 ≈ 0.0035, which is 0.35%. But that's not an option either. The options are A:0.8%, B:0.2%, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, perhaps the formula for the reflectance when using a quarter-wave coating is R = ( (n_film - n_air)/(n_film + n_air) )^2 * ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2. But that would be the product of the two reflection coefficients squared, but that doesn't account for the phase shifts. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approach of combining the two reflections with their phase shifts.

Earlier calculation gave me R_total = 0.09, leading to 0.81% reflectance, which matches option A. But I'm a bit confused because another approach gave me 0.35%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is the first one, considering the phase shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the reflectance when using a quarter-wave coating is R = ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2. Let me plug in the numbers again.

n_sub = 1.52, n_film=1.35.

(1.52-1.35)=0.17; (1.52+1.35)=2.87.

(0.17/2.87)=0.0592.

Squaring that gives ≈0.0035, which is 0.35%. But that's not an option here. The closest option is B:0.2%, which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the formula. Maybe the correct formula for the reflectance when using a quarter-wave coating is R = ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2 * ( (n_film - n_air)/(n_film + n_air) )^2. That would be the product of the two reflection coefficients squared. So let's calculate that.

r1 = (1.35-1)/(1.35+1)=0.35/2.35≈0.149.

r2=(1.52-1.35)/(1.52+1.35)=0.17/2.87≈0.059.

So R = (0.149)^2 * (0.059)^2 ≈ (0.0222)(0.0035) ≈ 0.0000777, which is 0.00777%, way too small. That's not matching any option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the first approach where I considered the reflection coefficients and their phase shifts. We found R_total = 0.09, leading to 0.81% reflectance, which is option A.

But wait, another approach: the reflectance R can be calculated using the formula for a quarter-wave coating, which is R = ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2. So with n_sub=1.52 and n_film=1.35, R= (1.52-1.35)^2/(1.52+1.35)^2 = (0.17)^2/(2.87)^2 ≈ 0.0289/8.2369 ≈ 0.0035, which is 0.35%. Not matching any option.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the quarter-wave film is designed for a specific wavelength, say in the visible spectrum. But the question doesn't specify the wavelength, so I think we can proceed with the general calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = ( (n_film - n_air)/(n_film + n_air) )^2 + ( (n_sub - n_film)/(n_sub + n_film) )^2.

So r1^2 + r2^2.

r1=0.149, r2=0.059.

So R= (0.149)^2 + (0.059)^2 ≈ 0.0222 + 0.0035 ≈ 0.0257, which is 2.57%, close to option D:2.2% or option E:1.8%. Hmm, but that doesn't match exactly.

Wait, but this approach doesn't account for the phase shift between the two reflections. So perhaps the correct way is to consider their destructive interference, leading to a lower reflectance than the sum of squares.

In our earlier calculation, we found that R_total = r1 - r2 = 0.149 - 0.059 = 0.09, so R=0.0081 or 0.81%, which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is A:0.8%.

To calculate the reflectance of a quarter-wave antireflection film of magnesium fluoride (n = 1.35) coated on optical glass (n = 1.52), we analyze the interference of light reflected from the air-MgF₂ interface and the MgF₂-glass interface. The quarter-wave thickness ensures destructive interference between these reflections, minimizing the total reflectance.

### Key Steps:
1. **Reflection Coefficients**:
   - At the air-MgF₂ interface:  
     \[
     r_1 = \frac{n_{\text{MgF}_2} - n_{\text{air}}}{n_{\text{MgF}_2} + n_{\text{air}}} = \frac{1.35 - 1}{1.35 + 1} \approx 0.149
     \]
   - At the MgF₂-glass interface:  
     \[
     r_2 = \frac{n_{\text{glass}} - n_{\text{MgF}_2}}{n_{\text{glass}} + n_{\text{MgF}_2}} = \frac{1.52 - 1.35}{1.52 + 1.35} \approx 0.059
     \]

2. **Phase Shifts**:
   - Each reflection at a higher refractive index interface introduces a phase shift of \( \pi \). Thus, the total phase shift from reflections is \( 2\pi \).
   - The path difference due to the quarter-wave thickness contributes an additional phase shift of \( \pi \), making the total phase shift \( 3\pi \) (equivalent to \( \pi \) modulo \( 2\pi \)).

3. **Total Reflection Coefficient**:
   The total reflection coefficient is given by:
   \[
   R_{\text{total}} = r_1 - r_2 = 0.149 - 0.059 = 0.09
   \]

4. **Reflectance**:
   The reflectance is the square of the total reflection coefficient:
   \[
   R = |R_{\text{total}}|^2 = (0.09)^2 = 0.0081 \, \text{or} \, 0.81\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated reflectance of the quarter-wave antireflection film is approximately **0.8%**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
