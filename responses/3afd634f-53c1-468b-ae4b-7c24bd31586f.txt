Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spherical light bulb and a steel ball bearing acting as a lens or something. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The bulb is 2 inches in diameter, and the ball bearing is 1 inch in diameter. The bulb is 20 inches away from the ball. I need to find where the image is located and its diameter.

Wait, the ball bearing is a sphere, right? So when light passes through a sphere, especially a convex lens, it can form an image. But wait, the ball bearing is made of steel, which is a conductor, so maybe it's acting more like a mirror? Or perhaps it's transparent, so it's a lens. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, steel is not transparent, so maybe it's acting as a mirror? Or maybe it's a convex lens because it's a sphere. Wait, no, steel isn't a transparent material, so perhaps this setup is about the reflection of light, not refraction. So maybe it's a spherical mirror problem.

But wait, the question says it's imaged by the steel ball bearing. So maybe the ball bearing is acting as a converging lens? But steel isn't a lens material. Oh, perhaps the bulb is emitting light, and the ball bearing is acting as a lens by refraction. Wait, but steel doesn't transmit light. So maybe it's a concave mirror or convex mirror. Wait, no, because a ball bearing is a sphere, which would make a spherical mirror. But mirrors can form real or virtual images depending on where the object is.

Alternatively, maybe it's a lens setup, but since the ball bearing is solid, perhaps it's a lens made of another material with steel? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the lens formula. For a spherical lens, the image can be found using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.

Wait, but the ball bearing is a sphere. The radius would be half the diameter, so 0.5 inches. Steel has a certain refractive index, but I'm not sure. Wait, but steel is mostly iron, which has a refractive index of about 2.4 or something like that. Wait, no, the refractive index of steel is around 2.4? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with other materials. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ball bearing as a thin lens. Wait, but I think the problem is more about the image formation by a spherical surface, perhaps using the lensmaker's equation.

Alternatively, maybe it's a simple case of similar triangles, considering the object and image sizes. The bulb is 2 inches in diameter, and the ball bearing is 1 inch. So the ratio of diameters would be 1/2. So the image might be half the size. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the object is 20 inches away from the ball bearing. The ball bearing is 1 inch in diameter, so the radius is 0.5 inches. If I'm treating the ball as a lens, the focal length would depend on the refractive index. The lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). But for a single spherical surface, R2 is infinity, so 1/f = (n-1)/R. But wait, if it's a lens, it's two spherical surfaces, but if it's just a single surface, like a meniscus lens, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ball is acting as a mirror. Wait, but mirrors use the same formula as lenses but with a negative sign.

Wait, maybe I should consider the ball as a convex lens. So the radius R is 0.5 inches. If the refractive index of steel is n, then 1/f = (n-1)/R. But I don't know the refractive index of steel. Let me check: I think the refractive index of steel is around 2.4. So 1/f = (2.4-1)/(0.5) = 1.4 / 0.5 = 2.8. So f = 1/2.8 ≈ 0.357 inches. So the focal length is about 0.357 inches.

Now, the object is 20 inches away. Wait, but in lens terms, the object distance u is the distance from the lens to the object. So u = 20 inches. Using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. So 1/v = (1/f) - (1/u) = (1/0.357) - (1/20). Let me calculate that.

1/0.357 ≈ 2.8, and 1/20 = 0.05. So 2.8 - 0.05 = 2.75. So 1/v = 2.75, so v ≈ 0.364 inches. So the image is formed at approximately 0.364 inches from the lens on the other side. But wait, the lens's focal length is positive, so the image is real and on the opposite side.

Wait, but the lens is a convex lens, so if the object is beyond the focal length, the image should be real and on the other side. But wait, the object is 20 inches away, which is much larger than the focal length of ~0.357 inches. So the image distance v would be positive, meaning it's on the same side as the object? Wait, no, in the lens formula, u is positive when the object is on the same side as the incoming light. Wait, I might be getting confused with signs.

Wait, in the standard lens formula, the object distance u is positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light (real object). The image distance v is positive if the image is on the opposite side (real image) for converging lenses. Since this is a convex lens (n > 1), the focal length is positive.

So, u = 20 inches, f = 0.357 inches. So 1/f = 1/v + 1/u → 1/v = 1/f - 1/u = (1/0.357) - (1/20) ≈ 2.8 - 0.05 = 2.75. So v ≈ 0.364 inches. So the image is 0.364 inches from the lens on the opposite side.

So the image is located 0.364 inches behind the lens. The ball bearing is 1 inch in diameter, so if the image is 0.364 inches behind the lens, it's within the ball. Wait, no, because the ball is 1 inch in diameter, so the lens is a single spherical surface, perhaps. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the ball is acting as a mirror. Let me reconsider.

If the ball is acting as a concave mirror, the focal length would be R/2, so R = 0.5 inches, so f = 0.25 inches. Then, using the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Here, u is the object distance, which is 20 inches. So 1/v = (1/f) - (1/u) = (1/0.25) - (1/20) = 4 - 0.05 = 3.95 → v ≈ 0.253 inches. So the image is 0.253 inches behind the mirror. Wait, but mirrors invert the image, so the image would be real and inverted.

But the options don't mention inversion, just the size. The object is 2 inches in diameter. The magnification m is v/u. So m = v/u = 0.253 / 20 ≈ 0.01265. So the image diameter would be 2 * 0.01265 ≈ 0.0253 inches. So about 0.025 inches in diameter.

Wait, but the options have some with 0.05, like option I and J. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the mirror approach again.

Wait, if the ball is a concave mirror, the radius is 0.5 inches, so f = R/2 = 0.25 inches. The object is at u = 20 inches, which is much greater than f, so the image is real and located at v = (u * f) / (u - f) → (20 * 0.25)/(20 - 0.25) = 5 / 19.75 ≈ 0.253 inches. So image distance is 0.253 inches from the mirror, behind it.

The magnification is m = -v/u = -0.253 / 20 ≈ -0.01265. So the image is inverted and has a diameter of 2 * 0.01265 ≈ 0.0253 inches. So the diameter is approximately 0.025 inches, and the image is located 0.253 inches behind the mirror.

Looking at the options, option J says 0.025 inches, located 0.25 inches beneath the surface. Since the ball is 1 inch in diameter, the surface is 0.5 inches from the center. Wait, the image is 0.253 inches behind the mirror, so from the surface of the ball, it's 0.253 inches into the mirror. So the distance beneath the surface is approximately 0.25 inches, matching option J.

Alternatively, if the ball were acting as a convex lens, but earlier calculation gave a larger image distance, but the diameter came out differently. Wait, for the convex lens approach, the image distance was 0.364 inches, and the magnification would be v/u = 0.364 /20 ≈ 0.0182. So image diameter is 2 * 0.0182 ≈ 0.0364 inches, which isn't matching the options. So maybe the mirror approach is correct.

Wait, but in the options, option I has 0.05 inches and 0.49 inches beneath the surface. How does that fit? Maybe I made a mistake in the mirror's focal length. Wait, mirrors have f = R/2, so for a concave mirror, f is positive. So for R=0.5 inches, f=0.25 inches. So the calculation seems right.

Wait, but the options for J are 0.025 inches and 0.25 inches beneath. That seems to match our calculation. So the image is 0.253 inches behind the mirror, so beneath the surface by that distance. So option J is the closest.

The problem involves a spherical light bulb (2 inches in diameter) being imaged by a steel ball bearing (1 inch in diameter) located 20 inches away. The ball bearing acts as a concave mirror, with a radius of curvature \( R = 0.5 \, \text{inches} \), giving it a focal length \( f = R/2 = 0.25 \, \text{inches} \). Using the mirror formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

where \( u = 20 \, \text{inches} \) (object distance) and \( f = 0.25 \, \text{inches} \), we solve for \( v \) (image distance):

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{0.25} - \frac{1}{20} = 4 - 0.05 = 3.95
\]

\[
v \approx 0.253 \, \text{inches}
\]

The image is located \( 0.253 \, \text{inches} \) behind the mirror. The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{0.253}{20} \approx -0.01265
\]

The image diameter is:

\[
\text{Diameter} = 2 \times |m| \times \text{Object Diameter} = 2 \times 0.01265 \times 2 \approx 0.0253 \, \text{inches}
\]

The image is \( 0.025 \, \text{inches} \) in diameter and located \( 0.25 \, \text{inches} \) beneath the surface of the ball bearing. This matches option J.
