Okay, so I've got this problem about a bookstore trying to figure out the best price to maximize profit per book. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the facts given:

- The bookstore buys 200 anthropology textbooks for $3 each. So, the total cost for the books is 200 * $3 = $600. That's a fixed cost because it's a one-time expense regardless of how many they sell.

- The store thinks it can sell these books at $15 each. But here's the catch: for every 50-cent reduction in the price, they can sell 10 more books. So, if they lower the price by $0.50, they sell 10 more, and so on.

The goal is to find the price that maximizes the profit per book. Wait, wait, actually, let me read that again. It says, "the price that maximizes its profit per book." Hmm, maybe I should clarify: is it the price per book that gives the maximum profit per unit, or the total profit? Because profit per book could mean the profit margin per unit, but I think in this context, they might be asking for the price point that gives the highest total profit. But I'll keep that in mind as I go through.

So, to model this, I think I need to express profit as a function of the price. Let me define some variables:

Let x be the number of 50-cent reductions. Each reduction is $0.50, so the price becomes (15 - 0.5x) dollars per book.

Now, how many books will they sell? At the original price of $15, they can sell 200 books. But for each 50-cent reduction, they sell 10 more. So, the number of books sold will be 200 + 10x.

Wait, but I need to make sure that x is such that the number of books sold doesn't exceed the number they have. They have 200 books. Hmm, but wait, the way it's phrased is that they can sell 10 more for every 50-cent reduction. So, if they reduce the price by 50 cents, they can sell 10 more, but only if they have enough books. Since they have exactly 200, and each reduction allows selling 10 more, but wait, they only have 200, so if they reduce the price, they can sell beyond 200? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misread that.

Wait, perhaps the store can only sell up to 200 books. So, if they reduce the price, they can sell all 200, but if they reduce further, perhaps they can't sell more than 200. Hmm, but the way the problem is stated is that they can sell 10 more for every 50-cent reduction. So, if they reduce the price by 50 cents, they can sell 210 books, but they only have 200. So that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the store can get more books if needed. But the problem says they can obtain 200 books at $3 each. So perhaps the store is limited to selling 200 books, and any additional sales beyond that would require ordering more, which isn't considered here. So, perhaps they can only sell up to 200, so the number sold is 200 regardless of price. But that contradicts the problem statement, which says they can sell 10 more for each 50-cent reduction. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that they can sell more than 200 if they reduce the price, but since they only have 200, perhaps the maximum they can sell is 200. But that doesn't make sense because the problem states they can sell 10 more per 50-cent reduction. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the initial 200 is just the number they have, but they can sell up to that number, and if they reduce the price, they can sell all 200, but each reduction allows them to sell more, but they can't sell more than 200, so the number sold would be 200. That seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's assume that the number of books they can sell is 200 + 10x, where x is the number of 50-cent reductions. So, each reduction allows them to sell 10 more, but they have only 200 in stock. Wait, that doesn't add up because 200 +10x would require more than 200 books if x is positive. So, perhaps the problem assumes that the store can sell up to 200 books regardless, and the 10 more refers to additional sales beyond 200, but that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says the bookstore can obtain 200 books. So, perhaps the maximum number they can sell is 200, and any attempt to sell more would require ordering more, which isn't considered here. So, perhaps the number of books sold is 200, regardless of the price. But then, the problem mentions selling 10 more for each 50-cent reduction, which suggests that the number sold increases as the price decreases. So, perhaps the initial 200 is the number they can sell at $15, and each 50-cent reduction allows them to sell 10 more, but only up to some limit. However, since they have exactly 200, perhaps the number sold is 200 +10x, but only up to the point where 200 +10x equals the number they can actually sell, which might require ordering more books, but that's beyond the scope here. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that they can sell as many as they want beyond 200, but that doesn't make sense because they only have 200.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the store can only sell 200 books, so the number sold is 200 regardless of the price. But that contradicts the statement about selling 10 more for each 50-cent reduction. I'm stuck here. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the store can sell 200 books at $15 each, and for each 50-cent reduction, they can sell 10 more books beyond 200, but they can't sell more than 200 because that's all they have. So, perhaps the number sold is 200, and the price is $15, but if they reduce the price, they can sell more, but they can't because they only have 200. That doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the store can sell 200 books, but if they reduce the price, they can sell more than 200. But since they have only 200, they can't actually do that. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that they have an unlimited supply, but that's not stated. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the number of books sold is 200 +10x, and that the store can sell as many as they want beyond 200 by reducing the price, but that's not realistic given the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the model as given, even if it's a bit confusing. So, let's model the number of books sold as 200 +10x, where x is the number of 50-cent reductions. So, for each x, the price is (15 - 0.5x) dollars, and the number sold is (200 +10x) books.

Wait, but that would mean that as x increases, the number sold increases beyond 200, but the store only has 200. So, perhaps this model isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the store can order more books if needed, but the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe we can ignore the stock limit and proceed.

So, profit is calculated as (price per book - cost per book) * number of books sold. The cost per book is $3, so profit P is:

P = (15 - 0.5x - 3) * (200 +10x)
= (12 - 0.5x) * (200 +10x)

Now, to find the value of x that maximizes P, I can expand this equation and then take the derivative with respect to x, set it to zero, and solve for x.

Expanding the equation:

P = (12)(200) + 12*(10x) -0.5x*(200) -0.5x*(10x)
= 2400 + 120x -100x -5x²
= 2400 +20x -5x²

Now, to find the maximum, take the derivative of P with respect to x:

dP/dx = 20 -10x

Set derivative to zero:

20 -10x = 0
10x =20
x=2

So, x=2. That means two 50-cent reductions, so the price is 15 - 0.5*2 = $14.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. The derivative was correct: dP/dx = 20 -10x. Setting to zero gives x=2. So the price is $14, which is option G.

But wait, let me check the profit at x=2:

P = (12 - 0.5*2) * (200 +10*2)
= (12 -1) * (200 +20)
= 11 *220 = $2420

What about x=1:

P=(12 -0.5*1)*(200+10*1)=11.5 *210=2415

x=3:

P=(12 -1.5)*(200+30)=10.5*230=2415

So, at x=2, profit is higher than at x=1 and x=3, so x=2 gives maximum profit.

Therefore, the price that maximizes profit is $14, which is option G.
</think>

The bookstore aims to maximize its profit by determining the optimal price. The cost per book is $3, and the initial selling price is $15 for 200 books. For every $0.50 reduction, the store can sell 10 more books. Let \( x \) represent the number of $0.50 reductions. The price becomes \( 15 - 0.5x \) dollars, and the number of books sold is \( 200 + 10x \).

Profit \( P \) is calculated as:
\[
P = (15 - 0.5x - 3) \times (200 + 10x) = (12 - 0.5x)(200 + 10x)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
P = 2400 + 20x - 5x^2
\]
Taking the derivative with respect to \( x \):
\[
\frac{dP}{dx} = 20 - 10x
\]
Setting the derivative to zero to find the maximum:
\[
20 - 10x = 0 \implies x = 2
\]
Thus, the optimal price is \( 15 - 0.5 \times 2 = 14 \) dollars. Verifying the profit at \( x = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), and \( x = 3 \) confirms that \( x = 2 \) yields the highest profit. Therefore, the price that maximizes profit is **$14**.
