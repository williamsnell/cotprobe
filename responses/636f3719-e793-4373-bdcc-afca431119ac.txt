Okay, so I've got this real estate question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a man who conveys a property to his wife's cousin with the words "to cousin and the heirs of his body." Then, he conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. The question is asking what interest, if any, the niece has under modern real estate laws in most states today.

Alright, so first, I need to break down each conveyance and understand the interests created.

Starting with the first conveyance: the man gives the property to his wife's cousin "and the heirs of his body." I remember that when someone conveys property "to A and the heirs of his body," that's a way of creating a fee simple subject to an executory interest. Wait, no, maybe it's a fee simple in severalty? Or is it a fee simple determinable? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. When you grant to someone "and their heirs of the body," that's typically a fee simple absolute, because it's going to pass to their heirs. So the cousin gets a fee simple, right? Because "heirs of his body" means that the property will go to the cousin's own heirs upon his death. So this is a fee simple gift to the cousin, and upon his death, it goes to his heirs.

Then, the man conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. Now, this is the second conveyance. But wait, the same property can't be conveyed twice, can it? So the first conveyance to the cousin would have transferred ownership, so the second conveyance would be ineffective unless there's some kind of future interest involved.

Wait, but maybe the first conveyance wasn't a fee simple. Let me think again. If he conveys to the cousin "and the heirs of his body," that's a fee simple, because it's to the cousin and his heirs. So the cousin has a fee simple, and upon his death, the property goes to his heirs. So the property is now in the cousin's name, and the niece's conveyance comes after that. But that would mean the niece didn't get anything because the property was already transferred to the cousin.

Wait, but the options include A, which says the niece gets nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to the cousin. But that seems straightforward. So the answer might be A.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the first conveyance isn't a fee simple. Let me think about the terminology again. "To cousin and the heirs of his body." I think that's a fee simple because it goes to the cousin and their heirs. So the cousin has a fee simple, and the property is no longer owned by the man. So when he tries to convey it to the niece, it's too late because ownership has already passed to the cousin.

Therefore, the niece gets nothing because the property was already given away. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, maybe there's a possibility of future interests. If the first conveyance was a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, then the cousin's interest would end upon some event, and the niece's conveyance might take effect. But in this case, the wording was "to cousin and the heirs of his body." That's more like a fee simple because it's giving it to the cousin and his heirs, without any condition.

Alternatively, if the first conveyance was a life estate, then the second conveyance could create a remainder. But the wording doesn't sound like a life estate. It's "to cousin and the heirs of his body," which sounds more permanent.

Wait, but in real estate law, when someone conveys the same property twice, the second conveyance is usually ineffective unless it's a future interest. So if the first conveyance was a fee simple, the second conveyance to the niece would be a gift after the fact, which wouldn't take effect. So the niece gets nothing.

So I think the correct answer is A: The conveyance gives the niece nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to his wife's cousin.

The man first conveys the property to his wife's cousin, granting a fee simple interest because the language "to cousin and the heirs of his body" indicates a transfer to the cousin and their heirs. This means the cousin owns the property in fee simple, and the property is no longer owned by the man. When the man later attempts to convey the same property to his niece, it is ineffective because the property has already been transferred. Therefore, the niece receives no interest in the property.

Answer: A
