Okay, so I have this series to evaluate: S = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... and so on. Hmm, I remember that series like this are called geometric series because each term is a constant multiple of the previous one. So first, I should figure out if this is a geometric series and what the common ratio is.

Looking at the terms, the first term is 1/2. The next term is 1/4, which is half of 1/2. Then 1/8 is half of 1/4, and 1/16 is half of 1/8. So yeah, each term is multiplied by 1/2 to get the next term. That means the common ratio r is 1/2.

I remember that the sum of an infinite geometric series can be found using the formula S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio, but only if the absolute value of r is less than 1. In this case, r is 1/2, which is less than 1, so the formula applies.

So plugging in the values: a is 1/2, and r is 1/2. So S = (1/2) / (1 - 1/2). Let me calculate the denominator first. 1 - 1/2 is 1/2. So now it's (1/2) divided by (1/2). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so (1/2) * (2/1) = 1.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the sum S is 1. Let me double-check that. The series is adding up 1/2, then another 1/4, another 1/8, etc. So each term is getting smaller and smaller, approaching zero. Adding them all up should get closer and closer to a limit. Since each term is half the previous, the sum should converge. 

Another way to think about it: The first term is 1/2. Adding the second term (1/4) gives 3/4. Adding the third term (1/8) gives 7/8. Then adding 1/16 gives 15/16, and so on. Each time, the sum gets closer to 1 but never exceeds it. So the limit as the number of terms approaches infinity should be 1.

Looking back at the options, option I is 1. So that must be the correct answer.

The series is a geometric series with first term 1/2 and common ratio 1/2. The sum converges to 1.
