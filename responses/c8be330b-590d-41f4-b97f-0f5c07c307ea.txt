Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. There's a bag with 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. So that's a total of 10 marbles. The question is asking for the probability that when I draw two marbles without replacement, both are the same color.

Hmm, right. So I need to find the probability that both are red or both are blue. Since those are the two possibilities where the colors are the same.

First, let me think about how probabilities work when drawing without replacement. The first draw affects the second because there's one less marble in the bag.

So, the total number of marbles is 10. The number of red marbles is 4, and blue is 6.

I think I should calculate the probability of both being red and the probability of both being blue separately, then add them together.

Starting with both red. The probability of drawing a red marble first is 4 out of 10, right? Because there are 4 red marbles. So that's 4/10.

After drawing one red marble, there are now 3 red marbles left and the total is 9. So the probability of drawing another red marble is 3/9.

So the probability of both events happening (first red then red again) is 4/10 multiplied by 3/9. Let me calculate that.

4/10 is 0.4, and 3/9 is about 0.333... So 0.4 * 0.333 is approximately 0.1333, which is 1/7.5, but maybe it's better to keep it as fractions.

Wait, 4/10 * 3/9 = (4*3)/(10*9) = 12/90. Simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 6, so 12 รท6=2, 90รท6=15. So 2/15. So that's the probability for both red.

Now, let's do the same for both blue. The probability of drawing a blue marble first is 6 out of 10, so 6/10.

After drawing one blue, there are 5 blue marbles left and the total is now 9 marbles. So the probability of drawing another blue is 5/9.

Multiply those together: 6/10 * 5/9 = (6*5)/(10*9) = 30/90. Simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 30: 30 รท30=1, 90 รท30=3. So 1/3. Wait, but 30/90 is 1/3, which is 3/9, but that's not correct. Wait, 30/90 is 1/3, but let me check: 6/10 is 3/5, 5/9 is as is. So 3/5 *5/9 is (3*5)/(5*9) = 15/45 = 1/3. Hmm, that seems right. So 1/3 is the probability for both blue.

Now, to get the total probability of both marbles being the same color, I need to add the probability of both red and both blue.

So that's 2/15 (for red) plus 1/3 (for blue). But wait, 1/3 is the same as 5/15, right? Because 1/3 = 5/15. So adding 2/15 + 5/15 gives 7/15.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because 2/15 + 5/15 is indeed 7/15. So the total probability is 7/15.

Let me check the options again. The options are from A to J, and option I is 7/15. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in calculating the probabilities? Let me go through it again.

For both red: first draw is 4/10, second is 3/9. 4/10 * 3/9 = 12/90 = 2/15. Correct.

For both blue: first draw is 6/10, second is 5/9. 6/10 * 5/9 = 30/90 = 1/3. Which is 5/15. So 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it another way. The total number of ways to choose two marbles is 10 * 9 = 90 possible ordered pairs. The number of favorable outcomes where both are red: 4 * 3 = 12. Both blue: 6 *5 =30. So total favorable is 12 + 30 =42. So the probability is 42/90, which simplifies to 7/15. Yep, that checks out.

So the answer should be option I: 7/15.

The probability of drawing two marbles of the same color is calculated by considering both red and blue possibilities. For red, the probability is (4/10) * (3/9) = 2/15. For blue, it's (6/10) * (5/9) = 5/15. Adding these gives 7/15.
