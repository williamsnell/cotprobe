Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

You drive a beat-up pickup truck along a straight road for $8.4 \mathrm{~km}$ at $70 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$, at which point the truck runs out of gasoline and stops. Over the next $30 \mathrm{~min}$, you walk another $2.0 \mathrm{~km}$ farther along the road to a gasoline station.
What is your overall displacement from the beginning of your drive to your arrival at the station?

Options:

A: 9.4 km
B: 10.0 km
C: 12.0 km
D:  10.4 km
E: 11.4 km
F: 7.4 km
G: 6.4 km
H: 12.4 km
I: 8.4 km
J: 13.4 km

Okay, so I need to figure out the overall displacement from the start to when I arrive at the gasoline station. Hmm, displacement is the straight-line distance from the initial point to the final point, right? So I don't need to worry about the path taken, just the starting and ending points.

The problem says I drove a beat-up pickup truck along a straight road for 8.4 km at 70 km/h. Then the truck ran out of gas and stopped. After that, I walked another 2.0 km for 30 minutes to reach the station. 

Wait, so I drove 8.4 km, then walked another 2.0 km in the same direction? Because the problem says "farther along the road," which implies the same direction. So the total distance I moved from the start is 8.4 km plus 2.0 km. Let me add those together. 8.4 plus 2 is 10.4 km. 

But wait, displacement is just the straight-line distance, so if I went straight without turning, the displacement would be the sum of both distances. So that would be 10.4 km. Looking at the options, option D is 10.4 km. 

I think that's the answer because both movements are in the same direction. The time taken for each part doesn't matter for displacement, only the total distance in the direction traveled.

The overall displacement is calculated by adding the distance driven (8.4 km) and the distance walked (2.0 km), as both are in the same direction. The total displacement is 10.4 km.

Answer: D
