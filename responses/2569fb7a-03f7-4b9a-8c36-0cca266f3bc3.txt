Question:

One of the key areas of debate in the early stages of Developmental Psychology was the so called, Nature vs. Nurture debate. Academics agreed that there was interaction between these two factors but there was wide disagreement concerning the degree of interaction. Which of the following terms, that relate to either genetic or environmentally caused changes, describes the differences in timing of physical changes that are found in children belonging to different cohorts?

Options:

A: Secular trends.
B: Epigenesis.
C: Genotype-environment interaction.
D: Canalization?
E: Critical period.
F: Phenotypic plasticity.
G: Genomic imprinting.
H: Genetic drift.
I: Sensitive period.
J: Genetic correlation.

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this developmental psychology question about the Nature vs. Nurture debate. The question is asking about a term related to genetic or environmental changes that describes differences in the timing of physical changes in children from different cohorts. The options are A through J.

First, let me break down the question. We're dealing with factors that cause changes, either genetic or environmental, and the key here is the timing of physical changes across different groups of children. So it's about when these changes happen, not necessarily what causes them.

Looking at the options:

A: Secular trends. I think this refers to long-term changes in society or behavior over generations. Maybe related to trends in intelligence or health, but not specifically about timing of physical changes in different cohorts.

B: Epigenesis. This term refers to the process of development where the genotype is expressed into a phenotype through environmental influences. It's about how genes are expressed, but I'm not sure if it's about timing differences between cohorts.

C: Genotype-environment interaction. This is when an individual's genotype interacts with the environment to influence traits. It's about the interaction, not the timing across different groups.

D: Canalization. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think it refers to the process where genetic factors guide development along a specific pathway, making the phenotype more consistent despite variation in the environment. So it's about how genes shape the outcome, not the timing.

E: Critical period. This is a specific time in development when certain events must occur for normal development. It's more about a specific time rather than differences across cohorts.

F: Phenotypic plasticity. This is the ability of an organism to adjust its phenotype in response to environmental changes. It's about flexibility in development, but not specifically about timing differences between groups.

G: Genomic imprinting. This is the phenomenon where genes are expressed differently depending on which parent they come from. It's more about gene expression based on origin, not timing across cohorts.

H: Genetic drift. This is a concept from population genetics, referring to random changes in allele frequencies. Not related to the timing of physical changes in children.

I: Sensitive period. Similar to critical period but maybe a bit broader. It's a time when certain stimuli have a greater effect on development. Again, more about specific timing than cohort differences.

J: Genetic correlation. This refers to the correlation between traits due to shared genetic influences. Not about timing.

Wait, the question is about the timing of physical changes in children from different cohorts. Cohorts here likely refer to groups of children born at different times, perhaps experiencing different environmental factors. So we're looking for a term that describes changes in when physical developments occur across generations.

I recall that "secular trends" do refer to long-term changes in traits or behaviors over time, possibly due to environmental factors. For example, increases in average height over generations could be a secular trend. This would involve the timing of physical changes across different cohorts.

Epigenesis (B) is about gene expression and environment, but not the timing across generations. Canalization (D) is about the trajectory, not timing. So the best fit seems to be A: Secular trends.

The question asks for a term related to genetic or environmental changes that describes differences in the timing of physical changes in children from different cohorts. The correct answer is **A: Secular trends**, as this term refers to long-term changes in traits or behaviors over generations, which aligns with the timing differences across cohorts.

Answer: A
