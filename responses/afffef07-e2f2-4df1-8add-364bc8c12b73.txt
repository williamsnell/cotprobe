Okay, so I've got this question about psychology theories and a particular belief about children's misbehavior. The question is asking which theory aligns with the idea that a child's misbehavior has one of four goals: attention, revenge, power, or displaying inadequacy. The options are from A to J, each representing a different psychologist and their theory.

First, I need to understand the belief mentioned. It's about why children misbehave. The four goals listed are attention-seeking, desire for revenge, seeking power, and feeling inadequate. I remember that this approach is often used in understanding child behavior, maybe in a therapeutic or parenting context.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Bandura's social learning theory. This is about learning through observation and imitation. It focuses on how children learn behaviors by watching others. But does it specifically address the reasons or goals behind misbehavior? I'm not sure if it's about the goals like attention or revenge.

B: Skinner's operant conditioning. This is about behavior being shaped by consequences—rewards and punishments. It's more about how behaviors are strengthened or weakened through reinforcement. So it's about the cause and effect, but does it explain the reasons or goals behind the behavior? Maybe not directly, but perhaps indirectly through what reinforces the behavior.

C: Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This theory is about human needs arranged in a hierarchy, from basic needs to self-actualization. It explains motivation based on fulfilling these needs. Could misbehavior be linked to unmet needs? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it specifically targets the four goals mentioned.

D: Beck’s cognitive-behavioral therapy. This approach focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It's more about changing negative thought patterns to improve behavior. It might explain behavior in terms of underlying thoughts but not necessarily the specific goals like attention or revenge.

E: Pavlov's classical conditioning. This is about learning through associations, like the famous dog experiment. It's more about involuntary responses to stimuli, not really about the intent or goals behind behavior.

F: Freud's psychoanalytic theory. This deals with the unconscious mind, id, ego, superego, and how past experiences influence behavior. Misbehavior could be seen as a manifestation of underlying conflicts or desires, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about the four goals listed.

G: Mahler’s object relations theory. This is about the child's internalized relationships and how they develop, affecting behavior. It might explain behavior in terms of attachment issues but not specifically the four goals.

H: Jung’s analytical psychology. Focuses on the collective unconscious and archetypes. It's more about understanding the deeper parts of the psyche but not directly about the goals of misbehavior.

I: Perls’s Gestalt therapy. This emphasizes the wholeness of the individual and resolving unfinished business. It's more about personal growth and self-awareness, not specifically about the reasons for misbehavior.

J: Adler’s individual psychology. Adler focused on the individual's striving for superiority and how early experiences influence behavior. He believed that misbehavior is an attempt to gain attention, feel powerful, or compensate for feelings of inadequacy. This sounds exactly like the four goals mentioned in the question.

So putting it together, the belief described aligns with Adler's theory, which is option J. He talked about the four types of mistaken goals in children's behavior: attention, power, revenge, and inadequacy. Therefore, the correct answer should be J.

The belief that a child's misbehavior has one of four goals—attention, revenge, power, or displaying inadequacy—is most consistent with **Adler’s individual psychology**. Adler focused on understanding misbehavior in terms of these specific goals, which aligns directly with the options provided.

Answer: J
