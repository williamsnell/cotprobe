Alright, so I have this logic problem to solve. It's about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.

First, let me parse the problem. The argument is given in two parts: the premises and the conclusion.

The premises are:
1. J ≡ ~K
2. J ∨ L

The conclusion is:
~K / L

Wait, that notation might be a bit confusing. I think the slash (/) here represents the conclusion, so the argument is structured as: If ~K, then L. Or maybe it's that from ~K, we conclude L. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as an implication: ~K implies L, based on the premises.

But let me break it down step by step.

First, let's write the argument in a more logical form. The premises are:

1. J is equivalent to not K (J ≡ ~K)
2. J or L (J ∨ L)

The conclusion is: Therefore, not K implies L, which can be written as ~K → L.

Wait, no, actually, in the problem statement, the conclusion is written as ~K / L. I think that might mean that from ~K, we infer L. So, the argument is:

Premises:
1. J ≡ ~K
2. J ∨ L

Conclusion:
~K → L

So, the argument is: Given that J is equivalent to ~K and that J or L is true, therefore, if ~K then L.

But wait, the way it's written, perhaps the conclusion is simply ~K leading to L. So, the argument is:

From J ≡ ~K and J ∨ L, conclude ~K → L.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is presented as:

Premise 1: J ≡ ~K

Premise 2: J ∨ L

And the conclusion is ~K → L.

So, I need to see if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's a row in the truth table where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that row would be a counterexample.

So, to construct the truth table, I need to consider all possible truth values for the atomic propositions, which are J, K, and L. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

Let me list all possible combinations:

1. J=T, K=T, L=T
2. J=T, K=T, L=F
3. J=T, K=F, L=T
4. J=T, K=F, L=F
5. J=F, K=T, L=T
6. J=F, K=T, L=F
7. J=F, K=F, L=T
8. J=F, K=F, L=F

Now, for each of these, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

First, let me note the premises and conclusion:

Premise 1: J ≡ ~K

Premise 2: J ∨ L

Conclusion: ~K → L

Wait, but the argument as given is J ≡ ~K and J ∨ L leading to ~K / L, which I think is the same as ~K → L.

So, the conclusion is ~K → L.

So, for each row, I'll compute:

- J, K, L
- Premise1: J ≡ ~K
- Premise2: J ∨ L
- Conclusion: ~K → L

Then, check if in any row, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. If such a row exists, the argument is invalid, and that row is a counterexample.

Let me go through each possible row.

1. J=T, K=T, L=T

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → T ≡ ~T → T ≡ F → F

So, Premise1 is F.

Premise2: J ∨ L → T ∨ T → T

Conclusion: ~K → L → ~T → T → F → T

But since Premise1 is F, this row doesn't make both premises true, so it's irrelevant for the argument's validity.

2. J=T, K=T, L=F

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → T ≡ F → F

Premise2: J ∨ L → T ∨ F → T

Conclusion: ~K → L → F → F → T (because F → F is T)

Again, Premise1 is F, so irrelevant.

3. J=T, K=F, L=T

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → T ≡ T → T

Premise2: J ∨ L → T ∨ T → T

Conclusion: ~K → L → T → T → T

All premises true, conclusion true. No problem.

4. J=T, K=F, L=F

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → T ≡ T → T

Premise2: J ∨ L → T ∨ F → T

Conclusion: ~K → L → T → F → F

Here, both premises are true, but the conclusion is F. So this is a counterexample. So the argument is invalid.

Wait, but let's check all rows to see if there are others.

5. J=F, K=T, L=T

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → F ≡ F → T

Because ~K when K=T is F. So J=F ≡ F is T.

Premise2: J ∨ L → F ∨ T → T

Conclusion: ~K → L → F → T → T

So, premises are T, conclusion T. No issue.

6. J=F, K=T, L=F

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → F ≡ F → T

Premise2: J ∨ L → F ∨ F → F

So, Premise2 is F. Doesn't matter for validity.

7. J=F, K=F, L=T

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → F ≡ T → F

Because ~K when K=F is T, so F ≡ T is F.

Premise2: J ∨ L → F ∨ T → T

Conclusion: ~K → L → T → T → T

But since Premise1 is F, row is irrelevant.

8. J=F, K=F, L=F

Premise1: J ≡ ~K → F ≡ T → F

Premise2: J ∨ L → F ∨ F → F

So, both premises F, irrelevant.

So, the only row where both premises are true is row 4 (J=T, K=F, L=F) and row 3 (J=T, K=F, L=T).

Wait, in row 3, both premises are true, and the conclusion is also true.

In row 4, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So that's the counterexample.

So, the argument is invalid because in row 4, when J=T, K=F, L=F, the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option corresponds to this scenario.

The options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false

B: Valid. No counterexample exists.

C: Valid

D: Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are true and L is false

E: Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are false and L is true

F: Invalid. Counterexample when J and L are true and K is false

G: Invalid. Counterexample when all are false.

H: Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and J and K are false

I: Invalid. Counterexample when K and L are true and J is false

J: Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and J and L are false

So, the counterexample we found is J=T, K=F, L=F.

Looking at option A: J is true, K and L are false. That's exactly our case.

Option D: J and K are true, L is false. That's J=T, K=T, L=F.

Option F: J and L are true, K is false. So J=T, L=T, K=F.

Option A matches our counterexample.

So, the answer should be option A.

The argument is invalid because there exists a counterexample where J is true, K is false, and L is false.
