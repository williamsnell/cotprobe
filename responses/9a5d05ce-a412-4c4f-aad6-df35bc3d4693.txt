Question:

A TCP entity sends 6 segments across the Internet. The measured round-trip times (RTTM) for the 6 segments are 68ms, 42ms, 65ms, 80ms, 38ms, and 75ms, respectively. Assume that the smooth averaged RTT (RTTs) and Deviation (RTTD) was respectively 70ms and 10ms just before the first of these six samples. According to the Jacobson's algorithm, the retransmission timeout (RTO) is given by one RTTs plus 4 times the value of RTTD. Determine the value of RTO (in ms) after the six segments using the Jacobson's algorithm if the exponential smoothing parameters (a and B) are 0.15 and 0.2 for calculating RTTs and RTTD respectively.

Okay, so I have this question about TCP retransmission timeout using Jacobson's algorithm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a TCP entity sends 6 segments, and the measured round-trip times (RTTMs) are 68ms, 42ms, 65ms, 80ms, 38ms, and 75ms. Before the first of these six samples, the smoothed average RTT (RTTs) was 70ms, and the deviation (RTTD) was 10ms.

I remember that Jacobson's algorithm uses exponential smoothing to calculate the average RTT and the deviation. The RTO is computed as RTTs + 4*RTTD. So I need to calculate the new RTTs and RTTD after processing all six samples, and then compute the RTO.

The parameters given are a (alpha) = 0.15 for RTTs and B (beta) = 0.2 for RTTD.

Wait, let me make sure I get the formulas right. The smoothed RTT (RTTs) is updated using a formula like RTTs = a * sampleRTT + (1 - a) * RTTs_prev. Similarly, the deviation RTTD is updated using RTTD = B * |sampleRTT - RTTs_prev| + (1 - B) * RTTD_prev.

But wait, sometimes I've seen the formula for RTTD as RTTD = B * (current deviation) + (1-B)*RTTD_prev. Oh right, because the deviation is the standard deviation, so it's based on the difference between the current sample and the previous RTT estimate.

So I'll start by initializing RTTs as 70ms and RTTD as 10ms. Then, for each of the six samples, I'll update RTTs and RTTD accordingly.

Let me list the samples in order: 68, 42, 65, 80, 38, 75.

So, first sample: 68ms.

Compute new RTTs: RTTs = a * 68 + (1 - a)*70.

a is 0.15, so 0.15*68 = 10.2. (1 - 0.15) is 0.85, so 0.85*70 = 59.5. So 10.2 +59.5 = 69.7ms.

Then compute RTTD: RTTD = B * |68 -70| + (1-B)*10.

|68-70|=2. B is 0.2, so 0.2*2=0.4. (1-0.2)=0.8, so 0.8*10=8. So RTTD=0.4+8=8.4ms.

So after first sample: RTTs=69.7, RTTD=8.4.

Next, second sample:42ms.

RTTs update: 0.15*42 + 0.85*69.7.

0.15*42=6.3. 0.85*69.7=69.7*0.85. Let me calculate that: 69.7 * 0.8 =55.76, 69.7 *0.05=3.485. So 55.76 +3.485=59.245. So 6.3 +59.245=65.545ms.

RTTD update: 0.2*|42 -69.7| + 0.8*8.4.

|42-69.7|=27.7. 0.2*27.7=5.54. 0.8*8.4=6.72. So RTTD=5.54 +6.72=12.26ms.

Now, after second sample: RTTs=65.545, RTTD=12.26.

Third sample:65ms.

RTTs update: 0.15*65 + 0.85*65.545.

0.15*65=9.75. 0.85*65.545: Let's compute 65.545 * 0.85.

65 *0.85=55.25, 0.545*0.85≈0.46325. So total≈55.25+0.46325=55.71325. So 9.75 +55.71325=65.46325≈65.4633.

RTTD update: 0.2*|65 -65.545| +0.8*12.26.

|65-65.545|=0.545. 0.2*0.545=0.109. 0.8*12.26=9.808. So RTTD=0.109 +9.808≈9.917ms.

Now, RTTs≈65.4633, RTTD≈9.917.

Fourth sample:80ms.

RTTs: 0.15*80 +0.85*65.4633.

0.15*80=12. 0.85*65.4633: 65.4633 *0.85 ≈ 55.643305. So 12 +55.643305=67.643305 ≈67.6433.

RTTD: 0.2*|80 -65.4633| +0.8*9.917.

|80-65.4633|=14.5367. 0.2*14.5367≈2.9073. 0.8*9.917≈7.9336. So RTTD=2.9073 +7.9336≈10.8409.

So now RTTs≈67.6433, RTTD≈10.8409.

Fifth sample:38ms.

RTTs update: 0.15*38 +0.85*67.6433.

0.15*38=5.7. 0.85*67.6433≈57.5018. So 5.7 +57.5018≈63.2018.

RTTD: 0.2*|38 -67.6433| +0.8*10.8409.

|38-67.6433|=29.6433. 0.2*29.6433≈5.9287. 0.8*10.8409≈8.6727. So RTTD=5.9287+8.6727≈14.6014.

Now, RTTs≈63.2018, RTTD≈14.6014.

Sixth sample:75ms.

RTTs update:0.15*75 +0.85*63.2018.

0.15*75=11.25. 0.85*63.2018≈53.7215. So 11.25+53.7215≈64.9715.

RTTD update:0.2*|75 -63.2018| +0.8*14.6014.

|75-63.2018|=11.7982. 0.2*11.7982≈2.3596. 0.8*14.6014≈11.6811. So RTTD=2.3596 +11.6811≈14.0407.

So after all six samples, RTTs≈64.9715ms, RTTD≈14.0407ms.

Now, compute RTO: RTTs +4*RTTD.

So 64.9715 +4*14.0407 = 64.9715 +56.1628≈121.1343ms.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A:140, B:97.56, C:114.28, D:138.32, E:150.34, F:130.45, G:120.48, H:110.22, I:105.62, J:125.78.

Hmm, 121.13 is close to option G:120.48 or J:125.78. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the steps.

Let me double-check the last few steps, especially the sixth sample.

Wait, the sixth sample is 75ms.

RTTs_prev before sixth sample was 63.2018.

So RTTs = 0.15*75 + 0.85*63.2018.

0.15*75=11.25.

0.85 *63.2018: Let me compute that again. 63.2018 *0.85.

Compute 63 *0.85=53.55. 0.2018*0.85≈0.17153. So total≈53.55+0.17153≈53.72153. So RTTs=11.25+53.72153≈64.97153.

RTTD: 0.2*|75-63.2018| +0.8*14.6014.

|75-63.2018|=11.7982.

0.2*11.7982=2.35964.

0.8*14.6014=11.68112.

Sum:2.35964+11.68112=14.04076.

So RTO=64.97153 +4*14.04076.

4*14.04076=56.16304.

Adding:64.97153+56.16304=121.13457 ms.

Looking at the options, the closest is G:120.48, but that's a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a rounding error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places to minimize error.

Let me recompute the RTTD after the sixth sample more accurately.

Wait, let's see each step again, perhaps I missed some decimal points.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the RTTD after the fifth sample correctly, as that affects the sixth.

After fifth sample (38ms):

RTTs was 63.2018, RTTD was 14.6014.

Then, sixth sample is 75ms.

So RTTs update:

0.15*75 = 11.25.

0.85 *63.2018 = ?

63.2018 *0.85:

Let me compute 63.2018 *0.85:

= (60 *0.85) + (3.2018 *0.85)

=51 + 2.72153=53.72153.

So 11.25 +53.72153=64.97153.

RTTD: 0.2*|75 -63.2018| +0.8*14.6014.

Compute |75-63.2018|=11.7982.

0.2 *11.7982 =2.35964.

0.8 *14.6014=11.68112.

Sum is 2.35964 +11.68112=14.04076.

So RTTD after sixth sample is 14.04076.

RTO =64.97153 +4*14.04076.

4*14.04076=56.16304.

Total RTO=64.97153 +56.16304=121.13457 ms.

Hmm, but the options don't have this exactly. The closest is option J:125.78, which is higher, and option G:120.48, which is lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the order of the samples. Let me check the order again. The samples are 68,42,65,80,38,75. Did I process them in the right order?

Yes: 68, then 42, then 65, then 80, then 38, then 75.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated RTTD for the second sample. Let me recheck.

Second sample:42ms.

RTTs_prev was 69.7ms after first sample.

So |42-69.7|=27.7.

RTTD update: 0.2*27.7 +0.8*8.4.

0.2*27.7=5.54. 0.8*8.4=6.72. So RTTD=5.54+6.72=12.26. That seems correct.

Third sample:65ms.

RTTs_prev=65.545.

|65-65.545|=0.545.

RTTD update: 0.2*0.545=0.109. 0.8*12.26=9.808. So RTTD=9.917. Correct.

Fourth sample:80ms.

RTTs_prev=65.4633.

|80-65.4633|=14.5367.

RTTD=0.2*14.5367=2.90734. Previous RTTD was 9.917.

0.8*9.917=7.9336. So RTTD=2.90734 +7.9336=10.84094. Correct.

Fifth sample:38ms.

RTTs_prev=67.6433.

|38-67.6433|=29.6433.

RTTD=0.2*29.6433=5.92866. Previous RTTD=10.84094.

0.8*10.84094≈8.67275. So RTTD=5.92866 +8.67275≈14.60141. Correct.

Sixth sample:75ms.

RTTs_prev=63.2018.

|75-63.2018|=11.7982.

RTTD=0.2*11.7982=2.35964. Previous RTTD=14.60141.

0.8*14.60141≈11.68113.

So RTTD=2.35964 +11.68113≈14.04077.

So yes, the RTTD is 14.04077.

RTO=64.97153 +4*14.04077=64.97153 +56.16308≈121.13461.

Looking at the options, the closest is G:120.48, which is about 120.48. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sixth RTTs and RTTD.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places to be accurate.

Let me recompute each step with more precision.

After first sample: RTTs=69.7, RTTD=8.4.

Second sample:42ms.

RTTs=0.15*42 +0.85*69.7.

42*0.15=6.3.

69.7*0.85: 69.7 *0.8=55.76, 69.7 *0.05=3.485 → 55.76+3.485=59.245. So RTTs=6.3+59.245=65.545.

RTTD:0.2*27.7=5.54. 0.8*8.4=6.72 → 5.54+6.72=12.26.

Third sample:65ms.

RTTs=0.15*65 +0.85*65.545.

65*0.15=9.75.

65.545 *0.85=55.71325. So RTTs=9.75 +55.71325=65.46325.

RTTD: 0.2*(65-65.545)=0.2*(0.545)=0.109. 0.8*12.26=9.808 → 0.109+9.808=9.917.

Fourth sample:80ms.

RTTs=0.15*80 +0.85*65.46325.

0.15*80=12.

65.46325*0.85=55.6432625.

RTTs=12 +55.6432625=67.6432625.

RTTD:0.2*(80-67.6432625)=0.2*(12.3567375)=2.4713475.

0.8*9.917=7.9336.

RTTD=2.4713475 +7.9336=10.4049475.

Wait a minute, earlier I thought RTTD after fourth sample was 10.8409, but this calculation shows 10.4049475. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, no, I think I messed up this step. Let me recalculate the fourth sample.

Wait, sample is 80ms. RTTs before this sample is 65.46325.

So |80 -65.46325|=14.53675.

RTTD update: 0.2*14.53675=2.90735. Previous RTTD was 9.917.

0.8*9.917=7.9336.

So new RTTD=2.90735 +7.9336=10.84095.

Ah, I see, I must have miscalculated earlier. So RTTD after fourth sample is 10.84095, not 10.4049.

So earlier steps were correct.

Continuing, fifth sample:38ms.

RTTs_prev=67.6432625.

|38-67.6432625|=29.6432625.

RTTD update:0.2*29.6432625=5.9286525. Previous RTTD=10.84095.

0.8*10.84095=8.67276.

So new RTTD=5.9286525 +8.67276=14.6014125.

Then, sixth sample:75ms.

RTTs_prev=63.20178.

Wait, let me recompute RTTs after fifth sample.

After fifth sample:38ms.

RTTs=0.15*38 +0.85*67.6432625.

0.15*38=5.7.

67.6432625 *0.85=57.501773125.

So RTTs=5.7 +57.501773125=63.201773125.

Now, sixth sample:75ms.

RTTs=0.15*75 +0.85*63.201773125.

0.15*75=11.25.

63.201773125 *0.85=53.72151215625.

So RTTs=11.25 +53.72151215625=64.97151215625.

RTTD: |75 -63.201773125|=11.798226875.

0.2*11.798226875=2.359645375.

Previous RTTD=14.6014125.

0.8*14.6014125=11.681130000.

So RTTD=2.359645375 +11.681130000=14.040775375.

So RTO=64.97151215625 +4*14.040775375.

4*14.040775375=56.1631015.

Adding:64.97151215625 +56.1631015=121.13461365625.

Hmm, that's about 121.1346 ms.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J:125.78, which is higher. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should carry more decimal points.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the precision of the calculations. Let me try to compute each step with higher precision.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the correct RTO is approximately 121.13, which is closest to option G:120.48, but that's 120.48. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:125.78, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should check the RTO formula again. Oh wait, the RTO is RTTs + 4*RTTD. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the RTTD calculation after the sixth sample. Let me recheck that.

After sixth sample, RTTD is 14.040775375.

So 4*14.040775375=56.1631015.

Adding to RTTs of 64.97151215625 gives:

64.97151215625 +56.1631015=121.13461365625.

Hmm, 121.1346 ms.

Looking at the options:

A:140.00

B:97.56

C:114.28

D:138.32

E:150.34

F:130.45

G:120.48

H:110.22

I:105.62

J:125.78

The closest is option G:120.48 and option J:125.78. Hmm, 121.13 is closer to 120.48 than to 125.78. But perhaps the options have rounded to two decimal places.

Wait, maybe I should present 121.13 as approximately 121.13, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine each step again.

Wait, after the fifth sample, the RTTs was 63.2018 and RTTD was14.6014.

Then, sixth sample is75ms.

RTTs update: 0.15*75=11.25. 0.85*63.2018=53.72153. So RTTs=64.97153.

RTTD: 0.2*(75-63.2018)=0.2*11.7982=2.35964. Previous RTTD was14.6014. So 0.8*14.6014=11.68112. So RTTD=2.35964+11.68112=14.04076.

RTO=64.97153 +4*14.04076=64.97153 +56.16304=121.13457.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded to two decimal places, so 121.13 is the correct value, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. I've heard that RTTD is sometimes calculated as B*(current deviation) and added to (1-B)*RTTD_prev. But perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the RTTD is calculated as RTTD = B * |sampleRTT - RTTs| + (1-B)*RTTD_prev.

Wait, that's what I did. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the RTTs is calculated as (a * sampleRTT) + (1-a)*RTTs_prev.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is 121.13, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial RTTs and RTTD are before the first sample, and the first sample is the first to be processed. So the initial RTTs is 70, RTTD 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step.

Let me recheck the first sample:

Sample 68ms.

RTTs after first sample: 70 +0.15*(68-70) ? No, wait, the formula is RTTs = a * sampleRTT + (1 -a) * RTTs_prev.

So 0.15*68 + 0.85*70.

0.15*68=10.2. 0.85*70=59.5. So 10.2+59.5=69.7. Correct.

RTTD: 0.2*|68-70| +0.8*10.

|68-70|=2. 0.2*2=0.4. 0.8*10=8. So 0.4+8=8.4. Correct.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fifth sample.

After fourth sample, RTTs was 67.6432625, RTTD=10.84095.

Fifth sample is38ms.

RTTs update:0.15*38 +0.85*67.6432625.

0.15*38=5.7.

67.6432625 *0.85=57.501773125.

So RTTs=5.7+57.501773125=63.201773125.

RTTD:0.2*|38 -67.6432625|=0.2*29.6432625=5.9286525.

Plus 0.8*10.84095=8.67276.

So RTTD=5.9286525+8.67276=14.6014125.

Yes, correct.

Then sixth sample:75ms.

RTTs_prev=63.201773125.

RTTs=0.15*75 +0.85*63.201773125.

0.15*75=11.25.

63.201773125 *0.85=53.72151215625.

So RTTs=11.25 +53.72151215625=64.97151215625.

RTTD:0.2*|75-63.201773125|=0.2*11.798226875=2.359645375.

Previous RTTD=14.6014125.

0.8*14.6014125=11.681130000.

So RTTD=2.359645375 +11.681130=14.040775375.

RTO=64.97151215625 +4*14.040775375=64.97151215625 +56.1631015=121.13461365625.

Hmm, 121.1346 is approximately 121.13, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as using the sample variance instead of exponential smoothing for RTTD. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of processing the samples.

Wait, perhaps the initial RTTs and RTTD are after the first sample, not before. Wait, the question says, "just before the first of these six samples." So the initial values are before any of the six samples are sent. So the first sample is the first one processed. So my approach was correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to use the average of all six samples for RTT, but that's not how Jacobson's algorithm works; it's based on exponential smoothing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to compute the average RTT and the standard deviation of all six samples and then calculate RTO as average +4*std dev.

Let me try that approach to see what happens.

The six samples: 68,42,65,80,38,75.

Average RTT: sum/6.

Sum=68+42=110, +65=175, +80=255, +38=293, +75=368.

So average=368/6≈61.3333 ms.

Variance: sum of (x - avg)^2 for each x.

Compute each (x-61.3333)^2:

68-61.3333≈6.6667 → (6.6667)^2≈44.4444.

42-61.3333≈-19.3333 → (-19.3333)^2≈373.9444.

65-61.3333≈3.6667 → ≈13.4444.

80-61.3333≈18.6667 → ≈348.4444.

38-61.3333≈-23.3333 → ≈544.4444.

75-61.3333≈13.6667 → ≈186.7111.

Sum of squares:44.4444 +373.9444=418.3888; +13.4444=431.8332; +348.4444=780.2776; +544.4444=1324.722; +186.7111≈1511.4331.

Variance=1511.4331/6≈251.9055. So std dev≈√251.9055≈15.87.

RTO=61.3333 +4*15.87≈61.3333 +63.48≈124.8133 ms.

That's close to option J:125.78, but not exact. But this approach isn't what Jacobson's algorithm uses; it uses exponential smoothing, so this is probably not the correct approach.

Wait, but the options don't have 121.13. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial value setup again.

Wait, perhaps the initial RTTs and RTTD are for the first sample, not before. But the question says they were just before the first sample, so initial values are 70 and 10.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the RTO as RTTs +4*RTTD without considering the four times factor correctly.

Wait, no, the problem says RTO is one RTTs plus four times RTTD, so that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the RTO with more precise decimal places.

After sixth sample, RTTs=64.97151215625, RTTD=14.040775375.

RTO=64.97151215625 +4*14.040775375=64.97151215625 +56.1631015=121.13461365625.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option G:120.48, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:125.78, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fifth sample's RTTD calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the fifth sample:

Sample is38ms.

RTTs_prev=67.6432625.

So |38-67.6432625|=29.6432625.

RTTD update:0.2*29.6432625=5.9286525.

Previous RTTD=10.84095.

0.8*10.84095=8.67276.

So RTTD=5.9286525+8.67276=14.6014125.

Yes, correct.

Sixth sample:75ms.

RTTs_prev=63.201773125.

So |75-63.201773125|=11.798226875.

RTTD update:0.2*11.798226875=2.359645375.

Previous RTTD=14.6014125.

0.8*14.6014125=11.681130000.

So RTTD=2.359645375 +11.681130=14.040775375.

Yes, correct.

So RTO=64.97151215625 +4*14.040775375=64.97151215625 +56.1631015=121.13461365625.

Hmm. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the correct answer is option G:120.48, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J:125.78, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the initial parameters.

Wait, the parameters are a=0.15 and B=0.2. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for RTTD is B*(current deviation) + (1-B)*RTTD_prev, where current deviation is |sampleRTT - RTTs_prev|.

Wait, that's what I did.

I think I'm stuck here. The calculation leads me to approximately 121.13, but that's not an option. The closest option is G:120.48, but that's 0.65 ms off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Maybe I should consider that the initial RTTs and RTTD are already after the first sample, but the question says they are before the first sample. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial RTTs and RTTD are before the first sample, and the first sample is processed, then the second, etc. So the initial values are 70 and 10, and after six samples, I end up with RTTs≈64.97 and RTTD≈14.04, leading to RTO≈121.13.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is option G:120.48, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck all steps once more.

After rechecking, I think my calculations are correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option G:120.48, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:125.78. Wait, 121.13 is closer to 120.48 than to 125.78.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:125.78, but I'm not sure. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the RTO as 64.97 +4*14.04=64.97+56.16=121.13, which is approximately 121.13. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula RTTD = B * |sampleRTT - RTTs| + (1-B)*RTTD_prev, but perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for RTTs is (a * sampleRTT) + (1 - a) * RTTs_prev, which is correct.

I think I've done everything correctly, but perhaps the intended answer is option J:125.78. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G:120.48.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the RTO as RTTs + 4*RTTD, which is 64.97 +56.16=121.13, which is approximately 121.13, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option G:120.48, which is the closest.
</think>

After calculating the updated RTTs and RTTD using exponential smoothing with parameters \(a = 0.15\) and \(B = 0.2\), the final RTO is determined to be approximately \(121.13\) ms. However, since this value is not among the provided options, the closest match is **G: 120.48**.

Answer: G
