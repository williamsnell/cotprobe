Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this differential equation to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let me take it step by step.

The equation is (d²x/dt²) - 2(dx/dt) -3x = 10a sin t + b(2t +1). Hmm, wait, actually, looking closer, I think it's 10a sin t plus b times (2t +1), right? Or maybe it's 10a sin t multiplied by b(2t +1)? No, I think it's 10a sin t plus b multiplied by (2t +1). Because the way it's written, it's 10a sin t + b(2t +1). So the RHS is the sum of two terms: one is a sine function, the other is a linear function in t, multiplied by constants a and b respectively.

So, the general approach for solving a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation is to find the complementary solution (the solution to the homogeneous equation) and then find a particular solution. Then, the general solution is the sum of these two.

First, let's write the homogeneous equation: d²x/dt² - 2 dx/dt -3x = 0. The characteristic equation would be r² -2r -3 = 0. Let me solve for r.

r² -2r -3 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: r = [2 ± sqrt(4 +12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)]/2 = [2 ±4]/2. So r = (2+4)/2=3, and r=(2-4)/2=-1. So the roots are 3 and -1. Wait, no: wait sqrt(16)=4, so 2±4. So 3 and -1? Wait, 2+4=6, 6/2=3. 2-4=-2, -2/2=-1. Yes, so the roots are 3 and -1. Therefore, the complementary solution is x_c = c1 e^{3t} + c2 e^{-t}.

Wait, wait. Wait, the standard form is r² + ar + b=0. Our equation is r² -2r -3=0, so a=-2, b=-3. So the roots are r= [2 ± sqrt(4 +12)]/2 = [2 ±4]/2, so 3 and -1. So the complementary solution is x_c = c1 e^{3t} + c2 e^{-t}.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see, option A has c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{2t}, which doesn't match because our roots are 3 and -1, so e^{3t} and e^{-t}. So option A's complementary part is e^{-t} and e^{2t}, which is wrong. Option B: c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t}, that matches. Option C: e^{-t} and e^{t}, so that's wrong. Option D: e^{-t} and e^{3t}, which is correct. Option E: e^{t} and e^{3t}, no. Option F: e^{-t} and e^{3t}, correct. Option G: e^{-t} and e^{3t}, correct. Option H: e^{-2t} and e^{3t}, no. Option I: e^{t} and e^{-3t}, no. Option J: e^{2t} and e^{-t}, no. So the correct complementary solution is in options B, D, F, G. Wait, but wait, F's complementary is e^{-t} and e^{3t}, correct. G same. Hmmm.

Wait, the complementary solution is correct in B, D, F, G. So I'll have to look at the particular solutions to narrow it down.

Now, the nonhomogeneous term is 10a sin t + b(2t +1). So we can split this into two parts: the first part is 10a sin t, and the second part is b(2t +1). So the particular solution will be the sum of the particular solutions for each part.

So, let's find the particular solution for each part.

First, for 10a sin t. The standard form for a particular solution when the RHS is sin t is A cos t + B sin t. But we need to check if sin t is already part of the complementary solution. Our complementary solution has e^{3t} and e^{-t}, which don't involve sine or cosine terms, so we can use A cos t + B sin t as our guess.

Now, taking the second part: b(2t +1). The RHS here is a linear polynomial in t, so we can guess a particular solution of the form Ct + D.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The nonhomogeneous term is 10a sin t + b(2t +1). So the particular solution will be the sum of two parts: x_p1 for 10a sin t, and x_p2 for b(2t +1).

So, for x_p1: Assume x_p1 = A cos t + B sin t.

For x_p2: Assume x_p2 = Ct + D.

But wait, let's make sure. The RHS for the polynomial is a linear function, so the particular solution for that will be a linear function, but we need to check if our complementary solution includes any terms that might conflict. Since the complementary solution is in exponentials, not polynomials, so it's safe.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise: the RHS is 10a sin t + b(2t +1). So the particular solution will be x_p = x_p1 + x_p2, where x_p1 is for the sine term and x_p2 is for the polynomial.

So, let's compute x_p1 first.

Compute x_p1:

x_p1 = A cos t + B sin t.

Compute x_p1'' - 2x_p1' -3x_p1.

First, x_p1' = -A sin t + B cos t.

x_p1'' = -A cos t - B sin t.

Now plug into the equation:

x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1 = (-A cos t - B sin t) -2(-A sin t + B cos t) -3(A cos t + B sin t).

Let's expand this:

= (-A cos t - B sin t) + 2A sin t - 2B cos t -3A cos t -3B sin t.

Now, collect like terms:

cos t terms: (-A -2B -3A) = (-4A -2B) cos t.

sin t terms: (-B + 2A -3B) = (-4B +2A) sin t.

Set this equal to 10a sin t.

So, the equation is:

(-4A -2B) cos t + (-4B +2A) sin t = 10a sin t + 0 cos t.

So, we can equate coefficients:

For cos t: -4A -2B = 0.

For sin t: -4B +2A =10a.

So, we have two equations:

1. -4A -2B =0.

2. 2A -4B =10a.

Let me write them as:

-4A -2B =0 → 4A +2B =0.

2A -4B =10a.

Let me solve these equations.

From equation 1: 4A +2B=0 → 2A + B =0 → B = -2A.

Now substitute B =-2A into equation 2:

2A -4*(-2A) =10a → 2A +8A =10a →10A=10a → A=a.

Then, B= -2a.

So, x_p1 = a cos t -2a sin t.

Wait, but let's check: the coefficients are correct? Let me plug back in.

So, A=a, B=-2a. Then equation 1: 4a +2*(-2a) =4a-4a=0, correct. Equation 2: 2a -4*(-2a)= 2a +8a=10a, correct. So that's correct.

So x_p1 = a cos t - 2a sin t.

Now, moving on to x_p2 for the polynomial part, which is b(2t +1). So, the RHS is a linear function in t, so we'll assume x_p2 = Ct + D.

Compute x_p2'' -2x_p2' -3x_p2.

x_p2' = C.

x_p2''=0.

So, substituting into the equation:

0 -2*C -3*(Ct + D) = -2C -3Ct -3D.

Set this equal to b(2t +1) = 2b t + b.

So, the equation is:

-3C t + (-2C -3D) = 2b t + b.

So, equating coefficients:

For t: -3C = 2b → C = -(2b)/3.

For the constant term: -2C -3D = b.

We already have C= -2b/3. So substitute into the second equation:

-2*(-2b/3) -3D = b → (4b/3) -3D =b → 4b/3 -3D =3b/3 → (4b -3b)/3 =3D → b/3=3D → D = b/(9).

So, x_p2 = Ct + D = (-2b/3) t + b/9.

So, putting it all together, the particular solution x_p = x_p1 +x_p2 = a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t + b/9.

Now, the general solution is x = x_c + x_p. So,

x = c1 e^{3t} + c2 e^{-t} + a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t + b/9.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Let me check each option.

Looking at option D: x=Y+A = c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t} + a(sin t -2 cos t) +b[(2/3) t + (1/9)]. Hmm, wait, but in my solution, the particular solution for x_p1 is a cos t -2a sin t, which is a cos t -2a sin t. So that's a (cos t - 2 sin t), which is the same as a (cos t - 2 sin t). In option D, it's a(sin t - 2 cos t), which is a different order. That would be -2a cos t +a sin t, which is different from what I have. So option D's x_p1 is wrong.

Similarly, option A: x_p1 is a (cos t -2 sin t), which matches. Let me check the other terms.

Option A: x=Y+A = c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{2t} +a(cost - 2 sin t) +b[- (2/3) t + (1/9)].

Wait, but in our solution, the complementary solution is c1 e^{3t} + c2 e^{-t}, but option A has c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{2t}, which is incorrect because the roots are 3 and -1, so e^{3t} and e^{-t}. So option A's complementary solution is wrong.

Option B: x=Y+A = c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} -a(cost - 2 sin t) -b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

So, the complementary solution is correct here: c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t}.

The x_p1 term is -a (cost -2 sin t) = -a cos t +2a sin t. But in our solution, x_p1 is a cos t -2a sin t. So this is the negative of that. So that would be incorrect.

Option C: x_p1 is a(3 cos t + sin t). That's different from our a cos t -2a sin t, so not correct.

Option D: x_p1 is a(sin t - 2 cos t), which is -2a cos t +a sin t. That's not the same as our a cos t -2a sin t. So incorrect.

Option E: x_p1 is a(cost - 2 sin t), which matches. But the complementary solution in E is c1 e^t +c2 e^3t, which is wrong because the roots are 3 and -1. So E's complementary is wrong.

Option F: x_p1 is a(2 sin t - cost). That's -a cos t +2a sin t, which is the negative of our x_p1. So F's x_p1 is incorrect.

Option G: x_p1 is a(cost + 2 sin t). That's a cos t +2a sin t, which is different from our a cos t -2a sin t, so wrong.

Option H: x_p1 is a(sin t + cost). Again, different from ours.

Option I: x_p1 is a(sin t +2 cost). Again, different.

Option J: x_p1 is -a(2 cost + sin t), which is -2a cos t -a sin t, which is different.

So, looking at the x_p1 terms, only option A and E have x_p1 as a(cost -2 sin t), but their complementary solutions are wrong. Let me check option A's complementary solution again: c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{2t}. No, that's incorrect because the roots are 3 and -1. So the correct complementary solution is c1 e^{3t} + c2 e^{-t}.

Looking at the options, only option B, D, F, and G have the correct complementary solution.

Wait, let me check option B: x_p1 is -a (cost -2 sin t) = -a cos t +2a sin t. But in our solution, it's a cos t -2a sin t. So the signs are opposite. That would affect the final result, so option B's x_p1 is incorrect.

Option D's x_p1 is a(sin t -2 cos t) = a sin t -2a cos t, which is the opposite in sign compared to our solution. So that's wrong.

Option F: x_p1 is a(2 sin t - cost) = -a cos t +2a sin t. Again, opposite signs.

Option G: x_p1 is a(cost +2 sin t) = a cos t +2a sin t. Again, not matching.

So none of these options have the correct x_p1 except for option A and E, but their complementary solutions are wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs somewhere. Let me double-check the particular solution x_p1.

Wait, our x_p1 is a cos t -2a sin t. So in the options, we're looking for that.

Looking back, option A has +a (cost -2 sint), which is correct. But option A's complementary solution is c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{2t}, which is wrong because the roots are 3 and -1, so the complementary should have e^{3t} and e^{-t}.

So perhaps none of the options have the correct complementary solution except B, D, F, G.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the particular solution. Let me recheck the x_p1 calculation.

We had x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1 =10a sin t.

We assumed x_p1 = A cos t + B sin t.

Compute derivatives:

x_p1' = -A sin t + B cos t.

x_p1'' = -A cos t - B sin t.

Substitute into equation:

(-A cos t - B sin t) -2(-A sin t + B cos t) -3(A cos t + B sin t) =10a sin t.

Expanding:

- A cos t - B sin t + 2A sin t -2B cos t -3A cos t -3B sin t.

Combine like terms:

cos t: (-A -2B -3A) = (-4A -2B).

sin t: (-B +2A -3B) = (2A -4B).

Set equal to 10a sin t:

So,

-4A -2B =0 (for cos t term, which must equal 0 because RHS has no cos t).

2A -4B =10a (for sin t term).

So,

Equation 1: 4A +2B =0 → 2A +B=0 → B= -2A.

Equation 2: 2A -4B=10a.

Substitute B=-2A into equation 2:

2A -4*(-2A) = 2A +8A =10A=10a → A=a.

Then B=-2a.

So x_p1= A cos t + B sin t = a cos t -2a sin t.

So that's correct.

Now, the options:

Looking for x_p1 = a cos t -2a sin t.

Which is a (cos t -2 sin t).

Looking at the options:

Option A: +a (cost -2 sint). Correct.

Option B: -a (cost -2 sint) → -a cos t +2a sin t.

Option E: +a (cost -2 sint). Correct in x_p1, but E's complementary is wrong.

So, among the options, only A and E have the correct x_p1. But their complementary solutions are wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in the complementary solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the characteristic equation. Let me check.

The DE is d²x/dt² -2 dx/dt -3x=0.

Characteristic equation: r² -2r -3=0.

r = [2 ± sqrt(4 +12)]/2 = [2 ±4]/2 → r=3 and r=-1.

So the complementary solution is c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t}.

Looking at the options:

Option B: c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} → same as our solution, just c1 and c2 swapped.

So the complementary solution in B is correct.

Wait, but in our particular solution, x_p1 is a cos t -2a sin t, but option B has -a (cost -2 sint) → -a cos t +2a sin t.

Hmm, which would only be correct if the equation had a RHS of -10a sin t. Because our particular solution gives x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1=10a sin t.

But in option B, x_p1 is -a (cost -2 sint), which would give x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1= -10a sin t.

Wait, so perhaps the problem's RHS is 10a sin t, but in option B, the x_p1 is such that it would match a RHS of -10a sin t.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing the particular solution.

Wait, let me check the substitution again.

x_p1 = A cos t + B sin t.

Compute x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1:

x_p1'' = -A cos t - B sin t.

x_p1' = -A sin t + B cos t.

So,

x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1 = (-A cos t - B sin t) -2*(-A sin t + B cos t) -3*(A cos t + B sin t).

Expanding:

- A cos t - B sin t + 2A sin t -2B cos t -3A cos t -3B sin t.

Combine like terms:

cos t: (-A -2B -3A) = (-4A -2B).

sin t: (-B +2A -3B) = (2A -4B).

Set equal to 10a sin t.

So,

-4A -2B =0 → 4A +2B=0 → B=-2A.

2A -4B=10a.

Substituting B=-2A:

2A -4*(-2A)=2A +8A=10A=10a → A=a.

B=-2a.

So x_p1= a cos t -2a sin t. Correct.

Therefore, in the options, the only option with correct x_p1 and correct complementary is none, because option A and E have the correct x_p1 but wrong complementary, while option B has correct complementary but wrong x_p1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the other part of the particular solution, x_p2.

x_p2 is for the polynomial part: b(2t +1). We found x_p2= (-2b/3) t + b/9.

In option A, the particular solution for the polynomial part is b[- (2/3) t + (1/9)], which is - (2b/3) t + b/9. Wait, that's the same as our x_p2. So the x_p2 in option A is correct. But the x_p1 in option A is correct as well. So why does option A's complementary solution have e^{-t} and e^{2t}? That's the issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the complementary solution. Let me check the characteristic equation again.

The DE is d²x/dt² -2 dx/dt -3x=0.

So characteristic equation r² -2r -3=0 → r=(2±sqrt(4+12))/2 → (2±4)/2 → 3 and -1.

So the complementary solution should be c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t}.

Looking at the options, only option B and D have this correct.

Wait, option B: c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} → same as our solution, just c1 and c2 swapped. So the complementary solution is correct.

But in option B, the x_p1 is -a (cost -2 sint) → -a cos t +2a sin t. Which would imply that when we compute x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1, it would equal -10a sin t, not 10a.

So, perhaps the mistake is in the sign when solving for A and B. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the equation for x_p1, the RHS is 10a sin t.

So when I set up the equations:

-4A -2B =0.

2A -4B =10a.

We solved and got A=a, B=-2a.

So x_p1= a cos t -2a sin t.

So in the options, the correct x_p1 is a (cost -2 sint), which is present in option A and E.

But option A's complementary solution is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the RHS is 10a sin t + b(2t +1), but in the options, some have negative signs.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the particular solution for x_p2.

x_p2= Ct + D.

Compute x_p2'' -2x_p2' -3x_p2 =0 -2C -3(Ct + D) → -2C -3Ct -3D.

Set equal to 2b t +b.

So,

-3C t + (-2C -3D) =2b t +b.

Which gives:

-3C =2b → C= -2b/3.

-2C -3D =b → substituting C= -2b/3:

-2*(-2b/3) -3D =b → 4b/3 -3D =b → 4b/3 -3D=3b/3 → (4b -3b)/3=3D → b/3=3D → D= b/9.

So x_p2= (-2b/3) t +b/9.

So in option A, the polynomial part is b[- (2/3) t + (1/9)], which is correct.

So, the general solution is x= c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t} +a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t +b/9.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option A: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{2t} +a(cost - 2 sin t) +b[- (2/3) t + (1/9)].

Wait, the complementary solution in A is e^{-t} and e^{2t}, which is wrong. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} -a(cost -2 sin t) -b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

So the complementary solution is correct, but x_p1 is -a (cost -2 sin t) → which is -a cos t +2a sin t, which is different from our a cos t -2a sin t. So this would imply that x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1 = -10a sin t, but our RHS is +10a sin t. So this would be incorrect.

Option D: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} +a(sin t -2 cost) +b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

So x_p1 is a(sin t -2 cost) → a sin t -2a cos t. Our x_p1 is a cos t -2a sin t. So this is the opposite of what we have, so incorrect.

Option E: x=Y+A =c1 e^t +c2 e^3t +a(cost -2 sin t) +b[(1/3) t + (1/9)].

Complementary solution is wrong (e^t and e^3t), and the polynomial part is (1/3) t +1/9, which is different from our (-2b/3 t + b/9). So incorrect.

Option F: x=Y+A =c3 e^{-t} +c4 e^{3t} +a(2 sin t - cost) +b[(2/3) t + (1/7)].

x_p1 is a(2 sin t - cost) → -a cos t +2a sin t, which is the negative of our x_p1. So incorrect.

Option G: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} +a(cost +2 sin t) +b[(2/3) t - (1/9)].

x_p1 is a(cost +2 sin t) → a cos t +2a sin t. Not matching.

Option H: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-2t} +c2 e^{3t} +a(sin t + cost) +b[(3/2) t - (1/9)].

Complementary solution wrong.

Option I: x=Y+A =c1 e^t +c2 e^{-3t} +a(sin t +2 cost) -b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

Complementary wrong, x_p1 not matching.

Option J: x=Y+A =c1 e^{2t} +c2 e^{-t} -a(2 cost + sin t) +b[(2/4) t + (1/8)].

Complementary solution has e^{2t} and e^{-t}, but the correct are e^{3t} and e^{-t}.

So none of the options seem to match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the particular solution for x_p1 should be multiplied by t if the homogeneous solution includes sine or cosine. Wait, but in our case, the homogeneous solution is in exponentials, not sines or cosines, so we don't need to multiply by t. So our approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs when solving for A and B.

Wait, the equation after substitution was:

(-4A -2B) cos t + (2A -4B) sin t =10a sin t.

So,

-4A -2B =0 → 4A +2B=0 → 2A +B=0 → B=-2A.

2A -4B=10a.

Substituting B=-2A into 2A -4*(-2A)=2A+8A=10A=10a → A=a.

Thus, B=-2a.

So x_p1= a cos t -2a sin t.

So the options must have this. Now, looking again:

Option A: a(cost -2 sint) → correct.

Option B: -a(cost -2 sint) → incorrect.

Option D: a(sint -2 cost) → incorrect.

So the only option that has the correct x_p1 and correct complementary solution is none of them. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I've overlooked option D.

Option D: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} +a(sin t -2 cost) +b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

So, x_p1 is a (sin t -2 cost) = a sin t -2a cos t. Which is different from our a cos t -2a sin t.

So, perhaps I should consider that the particular solution could be written as a linear combination with different coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs when solving for x_p1.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the particular solution is written as x_p = x_p1 +x_p2, where x_p1 is for 10a sin t and x_p2 is for b(2t +1).

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the RHS is 10a sin t multiplied by b(2t +1), but that seems unlikely. More likely, it's 10a sin t plus b(2t +1).

Wait, perhaps the nonhomogeneous term is 10a sin t + b*(2t +1), which is what I thought.

So, going back, the general solution is x= c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t} +a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t +b/9.

Looking at the options, perhaps option A is the closest, but it has the wrong complementary solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the complementary solution.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the roots. Let me check again.

The characteristic equation is r² -2r -3=0.

r = [2 ± sqrt(4 +12)]/2 = [2 ±4]/2 → 3 and -1.

So the complementary solution is c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t}.

Looking at the options, option B has c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t}, which is the same as our solution.

So, option B's complementary solution is correct.

Now, in option B, the particular solution is:

x_p1: -a(cost -2 sint) → -a cos t +2a sin t.

x_p2: -b[(2/3) t + (1/9)] → - (2b/3) t -b/9.

Wait, in our solution, x_p2 is (-2b/3) t +b/9.

So in option B, x_p2 has a negative sign in front of the entire term, which would make it - (2b/3) t -b/9, which is different from our x_p2. So that's incorrect.

Hmm. So none of the options seem to match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the particular solution.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the particular solution for the polynomial part, the coefficient C is positive.

Wait, no, because when I solved, I got C= -2b/3.

Wait, perhaps in the options, some have the signs wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution for the polynomial part is correct in option A.

In option A, x_p2 is b[ - (2/3) t + (1/9) ] → - (2b/3) t + b/9, which matches our solution.

But option A's complementary solution is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the homogeneous solution in option B is correct, but the particular solution has the wrong sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the complementary solution being wrong. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the particular solution.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the equation, the nonhomogeneous term is 10a sin t +b(2t +1), but in option A, the particular solution is a(cost -2 sint) +b[ - (2/3) t + (1/9) ], which correctly matches our solution, except for the complementary solution.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but with the wrong complementary. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the equations for A and B.

Wait, let me re-solve the equations:

From x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1 =10a sin t.

We have:

(-4A -2B) cos t + (2A -4B) sin t = 10a sin t.

So,

-4A -2B =0 → equation 1.

2A -4B=10a → equation 2.

From equation 1: 4A +2B=0 → 2A +B=0 → B= -2A.

Substituting into equation 2:

2A -4*(-2A)=2A +8A=10A=10a → A=a.

Then, B=-2a.

So x_p1= a cos t -2a sin t.

So the only option with this is option A and E.

Option A: x_p1= a (cost -2 sint), correct. But complementary solution is wrong.

Option E: x_p1= a (cost -2 sint), correct. Complementary solution is c1 e^t +c2 e^3t, which is wrong.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the complementary solution being wrong. But that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the complementary solution.

Wait, perhaps the characteristic equation is r² +2r -3=0 instead of r²-2r-3=0. Let me check the original equation.

The original DE is (d²x/dt²) -2 (dx/dt) -3x= 10a sin t +b(2t +1).

So the homogeneous equation is (d²x/dt²) -2 (dx/dt) -3x=0.

So characteristic equation is r² -2r -3=0, which gives r=3 and r=-1.

So the complementary solution is correct as c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t}.

Looking at the options again, perhaps I overlooked option D.

Option D: x=Y+A=c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} +a(sin t -2 cost) +b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

So x_p1 is a(sin t -2 cost) → a sin t -2a cos t.

Which is different from our x_p1, which is a cos t -2a sin t.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the x_p1 calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Let me assume that the particular solution for the sine term is of the form A cos t + B sin t. Then, when substituted into the equation, it should give 10a sin t.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of undetermined coefficients differently.

The operator method: Let me write the equation as (D² -2D -3)x =10a sin t +b(2t +1), where D is d/dt.

The characteristic equation is r² -2r -3=0, as before.

The particular solution for 10a sin t can be found using the formula:

x_p1 = [1/(r² -2r -3)] evaluated at r=i (for sin t) multiplied by 10a.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of undetermined coefficients, the particular solution for sin t is A cos t + B sin t, as before.

Wait, perhaps I should try using a different approach for the particular solution. Let me consider that the RHS is 10a sin t, so the particular solution is x_p1 = A cos t + B sin t.

Compute x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1.

x_p1' = -A sin t + B cos t.

x_p1'' = -A cos t - B sin t.

So,

x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1 = (-A cos t - B sin t) -2*(-A sin t + B cos t) -3*(A cos t + B sin t).

Expanding:

= (-A cos t - B sin t) + 2A sin t -2B cos t -3A cos t -3B sin t.

Combine like terms:

cos t: (-A -2B -3A) = (-4A -2B).

sin t: (-B +2A -3B) = (2A -4B).

Set equal to 10a sin t:

So,

-4A -2B =0 → equation 1.

2A -4B=10a → equation 2.

Solving:

From equation 1: 4A +2B=0 → 2A +B=0 → B=-2A.

Substitute into equation 2:

2A -4*(-2A)=2A +8A=10A=10a → A=a.

So, B=-2a.

Thus, x_p1= a cos t -2a sin t.

So, this confirms our earlier result.

Therefore, the correct particular solution for x_p1 is a cos t -2a sin t.

Looking back at the options, the only one that has this is option A and E.

Option A's complementary solution is wrong, but the particular solutions are correct.

Option E's complementary solution is wrong.

Thus, the correct answer must be option A, despite the complementary solution being wrong, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the complementary solution.

Wait, perhaps the DE is written as (d²x/dt²) -2 dx/dt -3x=0, so the characteristic equation is r² -2r -3=0, which gives r=3 and r=-1.

So the complementary solution is c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t}.

Looking at the options, option B has this correct.

Option B: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} -a(cost -2 sint) -b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

So the complementary is correct, but the particular solution is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the particular solution's sign.

Wait, perhaps when solving for A and B, the signs are opposite.

Wait, if I assume x_p1 = A cos t + B sin t, and after substitution, I get:

(-4A -2B) cos t + (2A -4B) sin t =10a sin t.

So,

-4A -2B=0 → equation 1.

2A -4B=10a → equation 2.

Solving equation 1: 4A +2B=0 → 2A +B=0 → B= -2A.

Substituting into equation 2:

2A -4*(-2A)=2A +8A=10A=10a → A=a.

So, B=-2a.

Thus, x_p1= a cos t -2a sin t.

So, the particular solution is correct as in option A.

Therefore, the correct general solution is x= c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t} +a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t +b/9.

Looking at the options, none have this exactly. But option A has the particular solution correct but complementary wrong. Option B has complementary correct but particular solution wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the particular solution for the polynomial.

Wait, x_p2= Ct + D.

Compute x_p2'' -2x_p2' -3x_p2=0 -2C -3(Ct + D) → -2C -3Ct -3D.

Set equal to 2b t +b.

So,

-3C t + (-2C -3D) =2b t +b.

Thus,

-3C=2b → C= -2b/3.

-2C -3D =b → substituting C= -2b/3:

-2*(-2b/3) -3D =b → 4b/3 -3D =b → 4b/3 -3D=3b/3 → (4b -3b)/3=3D → b/3=3D → D= b/9.

So x_p2= (-2b/3) t +b/9.

Thus, the particular solution for the polynomial is correct in option A.

Therefore, the correct general solution should be:

x= c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t} +a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t +b/9.

Looking at the options, none have this, but perhaps option A is the closest, but it has the wrong complementary solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the complementary solution.

Wait, perhaps the DE is (d²x/dt²) -2 dx/dt -3x=0, so the characteristic equation is r² -2r -3=0, roots 3 and -1.

Thus, the complementary solution is correct as c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t}.

Looking again, option B has the complementary solution correct.

Option B: x=Y+A =c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} -a(cost -2 sint) -b[(2/3) t + (1/9)].

So, the complementary solution is correct, but the particular solution has x_p1 as -a (cost -2 sint) → -a cos t +2a sin t, which would give x_p1'' -2x_p1' -3x_p1 = -10a sin t, which is the negative of what we need.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the complementary solution being wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the particular solution for the polynomial part is Ct + D, but perhaps the DE's operator method would require a different form if the homogeneous solution includes polynomials, but in our case, the homogeneous solution is exponentials, so it's safe.

Hmm.

After reviewing, the correct general solution is x= c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t} +a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t +b/9.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the signs when solving.

Wait, perhaps I should check the particular solution for the polynomial again.

x_p2= Ct + D.

x_p2' = C.

x_p2''=0.

So, x_p2'' -2x_p2' -3x_p2= 0 -2C -3*(Ct + D) =-2C -3Ct -3D.

Set equal to 2b t +b.

So,

-3C t + (-2C -3D)=2b t +b.

Thus,

-3C=2b → C= -2b/3.

-2C -3D =b → substituting C= -2b/3:

-2*(-2b/3) -3D =b →4b/3 -3D =b →4b/3 -3D=3b/3 →4b/3 -3b/3=3D →b/3=3D →D= b/9.

So, x_p2= (-2b/3) t +b/9.

Which matches option A's x_p2.

Thus, the correct general solution is:

x= c1 e^{3t} +c2 e^{-t} +a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t +b/9.

Looking at the options, the only option with the correct x_p1 and x_p2 is option A, but its complementary solution is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement had a typo, and the correct answer is option A.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The differential equation is a second-order linear nonhomogeneous equation. To find the general solution, we first solve the homogeneous part, \( (d^2x/dt^2) - 2(dx/dt) - 3x = 0 \), whose characteristic equation is \( r^2 - 2r - 3 = 0 \). Solving this yields roots \( r = 3 \) and \( r = -1 \), giving the complementary solution as \( x_c = c_1 e^{3t} + c_2 e^{-t} \).

Next, we find the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. The right-hand side (RHS) is \( 10a \sin t + b(2t + 1) \), which we split into two parts: \( 10a \sin t \) and \( b(2t + 1) \).

1. **Particular solution for \( 10a \sin t \):**  
   Assume \( x_{p1} = A \cos t + B \sin t \). Substituting into the equation and equating coefficients, we find \( A = a \) and \( B = -2a \). Thus, \( x_{p1} = a \cos t - 2a \sin t \).

2. **Particular solution for \( b(2t + 1) \):**  
   Assume \( x_{p2} = Ct + D \). Substituting into the equation and equating coefficients, we find \( C = -\frac{2b}{3} \) and \( D = \frac{b}{9} \). Thus, \( x_{p2} = -\frac{2b}{3}t + \frac{b}{9} \).

Combining these, the general solution is:  
\[
x = c_1 e^{3t} + c_2 e^{-t} + a \cos t - 2a \sin t - \frac{2b}{3}t + \frac{b}{9}.
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A:** The complementary solution is incorrect (\( e^{-t} + e^{2t} \)), but the particular solutions are correct.  
- **Option B:** The complementary solution is correct (\( e^{-t} + e^{3t} \)), but the particular solution for \( 10a \sin t \) has the wrong sign.  
- **Option D:** The complementary solution is correct, but the particular solution for \( 10a \sin t \) is incorrect.  
- Other options either have incorrect complementary solutions or incorrect particular solutions.

Given the analysis, **Option A** is the closest match despite the incorrect complementary solution.
