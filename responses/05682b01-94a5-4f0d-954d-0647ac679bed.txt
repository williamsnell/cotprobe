Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the mass of helium in a certain volume under pressure and temperature. Let's see, I'll need to use the ideal gas law for this. The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT, right? 

Alright, the given values are: volume (V) is 50 liters, temperature (T) is 15 degrees Celsius, pressure (P) is 100 standard atmospheres. I need to find the mass of helium. 

First, I should convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin because the ideal gas law uses absolute temperature. So, 15°C plus 273.15 equals 288.15 K. I'll just approximate that to 288 K for simplicity.

Next, pressure is given as 100 standard atmospheres. I remember that 1 standard atmosphere is about 101325 Pascals, but wait, maybe it's easier to keep it in atm units because the gas constant R might be useful that way. Oh right, the gas constant R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). That should work since all the units will be in liters and atmospheres.

So, plugging into the ideal gas equation: P = 100 atm, V = 50 L, R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T = 288 K. 

Let me rearrange the equation to solve for n (moles): n = (P*V)/(R*T). 

Calculating that: n = (100 * 50) / (0.0821 * 288). Let's compute the denominator first. 0.0821 * 288 ≈ 23.5968. Then the numerator is 5000. So n ≈ 5000 / 23.5968 ≈ 211.17 moles. 

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. 100 atm is a high pressure, so a lot of moles makes sense. 

Now, I need the mass. Helium has a molar mass of about 4 grams per mole. So mass m = n * molar mass. 

So m = 211.17 mol * 4 g/mol ≈ 844.68 grams. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option I is 840 grams. That's pretty close. 

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake with the units or calculations. Let me recalculate the denominator: 0.0821 * 288. 0.08 * 288 is 23.04, and 0.0021 * 288 is about 0.6048, so total is approximately 23.6448. 

So n = 5000 / 23.6448 ≈ 211.03 mol. Multiply by 4 g/mol gives 844.12 grams. So the closest option is I: 840 grams. 

But wait, another thought: sometimes pressure is converted to different units. Did I handle that correctly? I used pressure in atm and volume in liters, so R should be correct. Yeah, that's right. So I think 840 grams is the right answer.

To determine the mass of helium in a 50-liter volume under 100 standard atmospheres of pressure at 15°C, we use the ideal gas law: 

\[ PV = nRT \]

### Given:
- **Volume (V):** 50 L  
- **Pressure (P):** 100 atm  
- **Temperature (T):** 15°C = 288 K (converted to Kelvin)  
- **Gas constant (R):** 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)  

### Step 1: Solve for moles (n)
Rearranging the ideal gas law:

\[ n = \frac{P \cdot V}{R \cdot T} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ n = \frac{100 \cdot 50}{0.0821 \cdot 288} \]
\[ n \approx \frac{5000}{23.6448} \]
\[ n \approx 211.17 \, \text{mol} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of helium
The molar mass of helium is approximately 4 g/mol. Thus, the mass (m) is:

\[ m = n \cdot \text{Molar mass} \]
\[ m = 211.17 \cdot 4 \]
\[ m \approx 844.68 \, \text{g} \]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated mass is approximately 844.68 g, which is closest to option **I: 840 g**.
