Question:

Define Piaget's preoperational stage of cognitive development. Name and describe its twosubstages. The Conceptual Period of Intelligence Stage 1. Preoperational (2 - 7 yrs.) a.Preconceptual (18 mos. - 4 yrs.) First such use of representational thought and symbols, such as words, for objects; classification of objects. b. Intuitive thought (4 - 7 yrs.) Beginning of reasoning, but thinking is fragmented, centered on parts of things, rigid, and based wholly on appearances. 2. Concrete operations (7 - 11 yrs.) Can perform mental operations and reverse them. Can add up "all the marbles." Operations are however confined to concrete and tangible objects that are immediately present. 3. Formal operations (12 - 15 yrs.) Can form hypotheses, can go beyond operations appearances to deal with the truth or falsity of propositions.

Options:

A: The preoperational stage includes the intuitive thought substage from ages 2 to 4 and the formal operations substage from ages 4 to 7.
B: The preoperational stage consists of a single phase of development that spans from ages 2 to 7, without distinct substages.
C: The preoperational stage includes the preconceptual substage from ages 7 to 11 and the intuitive thought substage from ages 11 to 15.
D: The preoperational stage is characterized by abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning from ages 4 to 7.
E: The preoperational stage is from birth to 2 years.
F: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The preconceptual which lasts from ages 2 to 4 and the intuitive thought which extends from ages 4 to 7.
G: The preoperational stage consists of three substages: The preconceptual, concrete operations, and formal operations.
H: The preoperational stage involves logical thinking and reasoning.
I: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The sensorimotor stage which lasts from birth to age 2, and the concrete operational stage which begins at age 2.
J: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The symbolic function substage from ages 2 to 4 and the operational thought substage from ages 4 to 7.

Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's stages of cognitive development, specifically the preoperational stage and its substages. Hmm, I remember that Piaget divided his theory into four main stages, each with its own characteristics. 

The question is asking me to define the preoperational stage and describe its two substages. Let me think about what I learned. Piaget's stages are: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. So the preoperational stage comes after the sensorimotor stage, right?

From what I recall, the preoperational stage is from about 2 to 7 years old. It's divided into two substages. The first substage is the preconceptual, which is earlier in this period, and the second is the intuitive thought, which is later. 

Wait, the preconceptual substage is from around 18 months to 4 years, and the intuitive thought is from 4 to 7 years. So within the preoperational stage, there are these two parts. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly states that the preoperational stage has two substages: preconceptual (2-4) and intuitive thought (4-7). Let me go through each option.

Option A says the preoperational stage includes intuitive thought from 2-4 and formal operations from 4-7. No, that's wrong because formal operations are part of the formal operational stage, which is after preoperational.

Option B says preoperational is a single phase without substages. That's not right because I know it has two.

Option C says preoperational includes preconceptual from 7-11 and intuitive from 11-15. No, those ages are in the concrete and formal stages, so C is incorrect.

Option D talks about abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning in preoperational. Wait, isn't that formal operations? So D is wrong.

Option E says preoperational is from birth to 2, but that's the sensorimotor stage, so E is incorrect.

Option F states that preoperational has two substages: preconceptual (2-4) and intuitive thought (4-7). That matches what I remember.

Option G says preoperational has three substages, but I think it's two, so G is wrong.

Option H mentions logical thinking and reasoning, which is more in concrete operations, not preoperational.

Option I talks about sensorimotor and concrete operations, which are different stages.

Option J refers to symbolic function and operational thought, but I'm not sure about the exact terms. Wait, symbolic function could relate to preconceptual, but I'm not certain if that's how Piaget phrased it. I think the correct terms are preconceptual and intuitive thought.

So, the correct answer should be F because it accurately describes the two substages within the preoperational stage with the correct age ranges.

The preoperational stage in Piaget's theory spans from ages 2 to 7 and is divided into two substages: the preconceptual substage (2-4 years) and the intuitive thought substage (4-7 years). The preconceptual substage involves the emergence of representational thought, such as using words as symbols, and early classification skills. The intuitive thought substage is characterized by the beginning of reasoning, but thinking is still fragmented, rigid, and based on appearances.
