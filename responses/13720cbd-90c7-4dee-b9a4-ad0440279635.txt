Okay, so I have this question about a gravity fed lock in a shipping canal, and they're using a model that's 1/100th scale to study it. The question has two parts: part (a) asks me to estimate the time for the prototype to fill if the model fills in 0.8 minutes. Part (b) is about finding the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in the model and prototype locks.

Hmm, let's start with part (a). I remember that when dealing with scale models, especially hydraulic ones, you have to consider the scaling laws, like how time, velocity, flow rates, etc., change with scale. Since the model is 1/100th the scale of the prototype, the geometric scaling factor λ is 1/100. 

I think the key here is to figure out how time scales with the model. Time is related to velocity and length. Velocity in such systems might depend on gravity and the height, so maybe I should think about the velocity scaling.

Wait, gravity is a constant, so maybe the velocity in the model would scale differently. Let me think about the flow. For gravity-driven flows, the velocity v is proportional to sqrt(2gh), where h is the height. If the model is scaled down, the height h in the model is λ times the prototype's height. So the model's velocity v_model would be sqrt(2g(λ h_proto)) = sqrt(λ) * sqrt(2g h_proto) = sqrt(λ) * v_proto.

Wait, but velocity scales with sqrt(λ) because velocity is proportional to sqrt(h), and h is scaled by λ. So velocity in the model is sqrt(λ) times the prototype's velocity. But wait, no, because the model is smaller, so the velocity would actually be higher? Or lower? Let me think. If the model is 1/100th the size, then h_model = λ h_proto. So v_model = sqrt(2g h_model) = sqrt(2g λ h_proto) = sqrt(λ) * sqrt(2g h_proto) = sqrt(λ) * v_proto. So v_model is sqrt(λ) times v_proto. Since λ is 1/100, sqrt(1/100) is 1/10. So v_model is 1/10 of v_proto.

But how does this relate to time? Time is related to length over velocity. The time for filling would depend on the time it takes for the flow to cover a certain length. Let's say the lock has a certain length L. The time t to fill would be L / v. So in the model, t_model = L_model / v_model. Similarly, t_proto = L_proto / v_proto.

Since L_model = λ L_proto, and v_model = sqrt(λ) v_proto, let's plug into t_model: t_model = (λ L_proto) / (sqrt(λ) v_proto) )= (λ / sqrt(λ)) * (L_proto / v_proto) ) = sqrt(λ) * (L_proto / v_proto).

Wait, that's t_model = sqrt(λ) * t_proto. So t_proto = t_model / sqrt(λ).

Wait, no, wait, let me redo that.

Wait, t_model = L_model / v_model. L_model is λ L_proto, and v_model is sqrt(λ) v_proto. So t_model = (λ L_proto) / (sqrt(λ) v_proto) ) = (λ / sqrt(λ)) * (L_proto / v_proto) ) = sqrt(λ) * (L_proto / v_proto). But L_proto / v_proto is t_proto. So t_model = sqrt(λ) * t_proto. Therefore, t_proto = t_model / sqrt(λ).

So given that λ is 1/100, sqrt(λ) is 1/10. So t_proto = t_model / (1/10) )= 10 * t_model. The model fills in 0.8 minutes, so the prototype would take 0.8 * 10 = 8 minutes. So part (a) answer is 8 min.

Now, part (b) asks for the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in the model and prototype. Mass flow rate is mass per unit time, which is density * velocity * area. But density might scale differently. Wait, in hydraulics, when you scale models, the density is often adjusted to maintain Reynolds number similarity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the mass flow rate as being proportional to velocity times area.

Wait, mass flow rate Q is typically area A multiplied by velocity v multiplied by density ρ. So Q = ρ A v.

In scaling, if the model is geometrically similar, the area scales with λ², and velocity scales with sqrt(λ) as we found earlier. But what about density?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. In some scaling laws, the density might scale differently. Wait, for gravity-driven flows, sometimes the Froude number is important. But perhaps for this problem, the model uses the same fluid as the prototype, so the density ratio ρ_model/ρ_proto is 1. But wait, that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, maybe the model uses a fluid with different density to match Reynolds number or some other similarity.

Wait, but the problem says it's a geometrically similar model. So perhaps we can assume that the model is scaled in such a way that the flow regimes are similar, which might require matching Reynolds numbers. Reynolds number Re = (v L) / ν, where ν is kinematic viscosity.

For geometrically similar models, to have the same Re, the velocity scales as Re scales with λ. So Re_model = Re_proto. So (v_model * L_model) / ν_model = (v_proto * L_proto) / ν_proto.

But L_model = λ L_proto. So (v_model * λ L_proto) / ν_model = (v_proto L_proto) / ν_proto.

So v_model = (ν_model / ν_proto) * (1/λ) v_proto.

But if we're maintaining the same Reynolds number, then ν_model/ν_proto = 1 (assuming the same fluid, which in real cases might not be possible, but perhaps the problem assumes this). Or maybe the problem just assumes that the model uses the same fluid, so ν_model = ν_proto. Then, v_model = (1/λ) v_proto. Wait, but earlier I thought v_model = sqrt(λ) v_proto.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach the mass flow rate ratio directly, considering scaling factors.

Assuming the model and prototype are geometrically similar, the area scales as λ², velocity scales as λ^(1/2), since velocity is proportional to sqrt(h), and h scales as λ, so velocity scales as sqrt(λ).

But if the model's velocity is v_model = sqrt(λ) v_proto, and area model A_model = λ² A_proto.

Assuming density is the same (ρ_model = ρ_proto), then mass flow rate Q_model = ρ A_model v_model = ρ λ² A_proto * sqrt(λ) v_proto.

But the prototype's mass flow rate is Q_proto = ρ A_proto v_proto.

So the ratio Q_model/Q_proto would be (λ² * sqrt(λ)) ) = λ^(5/2).

Wait, that would make the ratio λ^(5/2).

Wait, but looking at the options, for part (b), the options are given as various lambdas. Let's see the options:

Options for part (b):

A: λ^7/2

B: λ^3/2

C: λ^4

D: λ^5/3

E: λ^4/2

F: λ^6/2

G: λ^5/2

H: λ^2

I: λ^3

J: λ^7/3

So for part (b), the ratio is λ^(5/2), which is option G.

Wait, but earlier I thought the velocity scales with sqrt(λ), so v_model = sqrt(λ) v_proto. So then, for mass flow rate, which is ρ A v, we have:

Q_model = ρ_model * A_model * v_model.

Similarly, Q_proto = ρ_proto * A_proto * v_proto.

Assuming same fluid, ρ_model = ρ_proto.

Then, Q_model/Q_proto = (A_model/A_proto) * (v_model/v_proto).

A_model/A_proto = λ².

v_model/v_proto = sqrt(λ).

So the ratio is λ² * sqrt(λ) = λ^(5/2).

So the ratio is λ^(5/2), which is option G.

Wait, but some sources say that for flow rates, the scaling might involve different exponents. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of dimensional analysis. Mass flow rate has dimensions of MLT^{-1}.

The scaling factors are:

Length scale λ = L_model / L_proto = 1/100.

Time scale: from part (a), we found t_proto = t_model / sqrt(λ), so tau (time scale) = 1/sqrt(λ).

Velocity scale: v_model = sqrt(λ) v_proto, so v scales with sqrt(λ).

Density scales: If we're using the same fluid, then density is same, so ρ scale is 1.

So, mass flow rate Q is rho * A * v. So in model, Q_model = rho * (lambda^2 A_proto) * (sqrt(lambda) v_proto).

Q_proto = rho * A_proto * v_proto.

So Q_model/Q_proto = lambda^2 * sqrt(lambda) = lambda^(5/2).

Yes, that's correct. So part (b) is lambda^5/2, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options again, the options are:

A: 5 min, λ^7/2

B: 9 min, λ^3/2

C: 11 min, λ^4

D: 12 min, λ^5/3

E: 7 min, λ^4/2

F: 6 min, λ^6/2

G: 8 min, λ^5/2

H: 4 min, λ^2

I: 10 min, λ^3

J: 15 min, λ^7/3

So for part (a), the time is 8 min, which is option G's first part, and part (b) is λ^5/2, which is also option G's second part. So the correct option is G.
</think>

The time for the prototype to fill is estimated using scaling laws. For a 1/100-scale model, the time scales with the square root of the length scale, resulting in a prototype time of 8 minutes. The mass flow rate ratio is determined by the product of the area scaling (λ²) and velocity scaling (√λ), yielding a ratio of λ^(5/2). Thus, the correct answer is:

G: 8 min, λ^5/2

The final answer is:

G
