Okay, so I've got this accounting question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. The question is about correcting an error in depreciation reported by Holt Co. in the prior year. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario says that Holt Co. failed to report $40,000 of depreciation related to a newly constructed building in the prior year. Hmm, so they didn't account for that depreciation when they should have. But wait, the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes. That's interesting because it means the tax authorities have already considered the correct depreciation amount.

Now, the question is about how to correct this error in the current year. I remember that when a company discovers an error in its previous financial statements, they need to correct it by adjusting the current year's accounts. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact treatment here.

Depreciation is an expense that reduces the value of an asset over time. If they didn't record $40,000 of depreciation in the prior year, that means their expenses were understated by that amount. So, their net income for that prior year was too high because they didn't expense $40,000. Now, to correct this, they need to adjust the current year's accounts.

Wait, no, actually, the correction should be made in the current year's financial statements. So, how does that work? I think when you correct an error, you adjust the retained earnings, but sometimes it can be done through the income statement in the current period.

Wait, but the options are about how to report the correction. The options are about increasing or decreasing depreciation expense or accumulated depreciation by certain amounts.

So, the prior year's depreciation was $40,000 less than it should have been. That means their accumulated depreciation was understated by $40,000 because they didn't record that expense. Now, to correct this, in the current year, they need to adjust their books.

But wait, when you correct an error from the prior year, you typically adjust the current year's income statement or perhaps the balance sheet. Since depreciation is an expense, if they didn't record it before, they need to record it now, but how?

I think the correction would involve increasing the depreciation expense in the current year by the $40,000 that was missed. Because the prior year's financials were wrong, and you can't change past financials, you adjust the current year to reflect the correct figure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The error was that in the prior year, they didn't record $40k of depreciation. So their depreciation expense was too low by $40k, making their net income too high. So, to correct this, they should increase their depreciation expense in the current year by that $40k. That way, it's as if the prior year's error is corrected by adjusting the current period.

But wait, no, that doesn't quite make sense. Because you can't just adjust the current year's expense to fix a prior year error. Or can you? I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, maybe the correction is made by increasing the accumulated depreciation on the balance sheet by $40k. Because accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account, and if they didn't record the depreciation before, their accumulated depreciation is too low, so they need to increase it.

Wait, but how does that affect the income statement? Because increasing accumulated depreciation doesn't directly affect the income statement. Hmm. Or does it?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. So, let's think about it. Depreciation expense is an expense on the income statement, and it also affects the accumulated depreciation on the balance sheet. So, if in the prior year, depreciation expense was understated by $40k, then the accumulated depreciation would also be understated by $40k because each year's depreciation expense adds to the accumulated depreciation.

Therefore, to correct this, the company needs to increase both the depreciation expense and the accumulated depreciation by $40k in the current year. But wait, can you just add that to the current year's depreciation? Or is there a different way?

Wait, no, I think the correction would involve adjusting the accumulated depreciation. Because the prior year's financials can't be changed, so in the current year, you adjust the balance sheet and the income statement by the amount that was missed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline what the accounts involved are:

- Depreciation Expense (Income Statement): understated by $40k in the prior year.

- Accumulated Depreciation (Balance Sheet): understated by $40k in the prior year.

So, to correct this, the company needs to increase both the current year's depreciation expense by $40k and increase the accumulated depreciation by $40k. But wait, can you adjust the current year's depreciation expense for a prior year error?

I think that's acceptable because you're correcting the error in the current period. So, in the current year, you would record an additional depreciation expense of $40k, which would flow through the income statement, and also increase the accumulated depreciation by $40k on the balance sheet.

But looking at the options, the choices are about how to report the correction in the current year. Let's look at the options again:

A: Increase depreciation expense by $32k. B: Increase by $40k. C: Increase by $48k.

Wait, why would it be $32k or $48k? The error is $40k, so I'm confused.

Wait, the tax rate is 20%. So perhaps the tax impact is considered here? Because the question mentions that the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes. That means that the tax authorities have already allowed the full $40k depreciation in the prior year, so the company's taxable income was correctly reduced by $40k, but their book income was higher because they didn't record the depreciation.

Wait, so the company's book income was higher, but their taxable income was lower because they took the depreciation for tax purposes. That means that the prior year's financial statements had an overstatement of income, but the tax return was correct.

So, when correcting this, the company needs to adjust their books to match their taxes. So, they need to record the $40k depreciation as an expense in the prior year. But since they can't go back, they adjust the current year.

Wait, but how? Because the prior year's financials are already closed. So, in the current year, they need to make the adjustment as if it's a prior period adjustment.

Wait, prior period adjustments are accounted for by adjusting retained earnings. So, the correction would involve debiting Depreciation Expense (Prior Year) for $40k and crediting Accumulated Depreciation for $40k. But this affects the balance sheet and the income statement for the prior year, which isn't possible. So, instead, the adjustment is made in the current year by increasing the depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correction is made by increasing the accumulated depreciation by $40k, which would decrease the net book value of the asset, and also increasing the depreciation expense by $40k in the current year to reflect the missed amount.

Wait, but why would the tax rate come into play? The tax rate is 20%, so perhaps the company needs to recognize the tax impact on the prior year's correction.

Wait, no, because the depreciation was already computed correctly for tax purposes, so the tax authorities allowed the $40k deduction. So, the company's books are the ones that are wrong, not the tax returns. Therefore, the company doesn't need to adjust their taxes for this correction because the tax return already accounted for the depreciation.

But the question is about how to report the correction in the current year. So, the company needs to adjust their financial statements to include the $40k depreciation that was missed. That would mean increasing depreciation expense in the current year by $40k, which would decrease net income by $40k, and increasing accumulated depreciation by $40k to correctly reflect the asset's value.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are about increasing or decreasing depreciation expense or accumulated depreciation. So, the correction would involve an increase in depreciation expense of $40k and an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40k.

Looking at the options, option B is an increase in depreciation expense of $40k, and option J is an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40k. But the question is about how to report the correction, so perhaps both need to be considered, but the options don't combine them.

Wait, but the options are separate. So, perhaps the correct answer is to increase depreciation expense by $40k, which would be option B. But I'm not sure because the correction also affects accumulated depreciation, but the question is about how the correction is reported, so it's about the current year's adjustment.

Alternatively, maybe the correction is made through the accumulated depreciation account. Because the prior year's depreciation was understated, the accumulated depreciation is too low. So, in the current year, the company would need to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which would be an increase in the contra-asset account. That would be option J: increase accumulated depreciation by $40k.

But wait, if you increase accumulated depreciation, that's a decrease in the asset's value, which is correct because the building should have had more depreciation. But does that also impact the current year's depreciation expense?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The error was that in the prior year, they didn't record $40k of depreciation. So, their depreciation expense was too low by $40k, and their accumulated depreciation was also too low by $40k.

To correct this, in the current year, they need to adjust both. But since the prior year's financials are already closed, they can't change them. So, the correction is made by increasing the current year's depreciation expense by $40k and increasing the accumulated depreciation by $40k.

But looking at the options, option B is an increase in depreciation expense of $40k, and option J is an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40k. So, which one is the correct way to report the correction?

Wait, the question is asking how Holt should report the correction in the current year. So, the correction involves both adjusting the income statement and the balance sheet. But the options only mention one adjustment each, so perhaps the answer is both, but the options don't have a combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the correction is to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which would be option J. But that doesn't directly address the income statement. Or maybe the correction is to increase depreciation expense by $40k, which would be option B.

Wait, but the error is that the prior year's depreciation was understated. So, the correct way to fix that is to adjust the current year's depreciation expense to include the $40k that was missed. Because if you don't adjust the current year's expense, the prior year's error remains uncorrected in the financial statements.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think the correct approach is to adjust both the accumulated depreciation and the current year's depreciation expense. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is option J.

Wait, but the options also mention a tax rate of 20%. So, maybe I need to consider that. The tax rate is 20%, so perhaps the impact on taxes is $40k * 20% = $8k. But that doesn't fit with the options given.

Wait, but the question says that the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes. So, the tax return already included the $40k deduction. Therefore, the company doesn't need to adjust taxes because the tax return was correct. So, the only adjustment needed is to the financial statements, not to the taxes.

So, the company needs to increase their depreciation expense in the current year by $40k to correct the prior year's error. That would mean that the net income for the current year is reduced by $40k, which would also adjust the retained earnings to reflect the prior period error.

Wait, but prior period adjustments are made through the retained earnings account. So, the correction would involve debiting Depreciation Expense (Prior Year) for $40k and crediting Accumulated Depreciation for $40k. But since the prior year's financials are closed, the adjustment is made in the current year by increasing the current year's depreciation expense by $40k and increasing accumulated depreciation by $40k.

So, looking back at the options, the correct answer would be to increase depreciation expense by $40k (option B) and increase accumulated depreciation by $40k (option J). But the options don't have a combination, so perhaps the correct answer is to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k and also adjust the current year's depreciation expense accordingly.

But the question is asking how to report the correction in the current year. So, the immediate effect is on the current year's accounts. Therefore, the current year's depreciation expense should be increased by $40k, making option B the answer.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to find a definitive approach.

When a prior period error is discovered, the correction is made by adjusting the current period's financial statements. For an error like this, where depreciation was understated, the correction involves increasing the depreciation expense in the current year by the amount of the error, $40k, and also increasing the accumulated depreciation by $40k.

So, in the current year, both the income statement and the balance sheet are adjusted. Therefore, the correct reporting would involve both an increase in depreciation expense and an increase in accumulated depreciation. However, the options don't offer a combination, so perhaps the question is focusing on one aspect.

Wait, the question is about how to report the correction in the current year. So, the correction would involve increasing the current year's depreciation expense by $40k to recognize the prior error. That would be option B.

Alternatively, if the correction is made to the balance sheet, it's an increase in accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is option J.

But I'm a bit stuck because both seem correct. But perhaps the primary adjustment is to the accumulated depreciation because it's a balance sheet account, and the income statement adjustment is a consequence of that.

Wait, no, because depreciation expense is the charge against income for the period, so the correction would involve increasing the current year's depreciation expense to account for the missed amount.

I think the correct answer is option B: As an increase in depreciation expense of $40,000.

Wait, but another angle: perhaps the company should increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which would require an increase in the expense in the current year, but the accumulated depreciation adjustment is on the balance sheet.

So, looking at the options, option J is an increase in accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is correct. But the question is about how the correction is reported in the current year, which would involve both adjusting the income statement and the balance sheet.

But the options don't combine these, so perhaps the answer is to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is option J.

Wait, but the question is asking how to report the correction, so perhaps it's about the impact on the income statement. If the prior year's depreciation was too low, the current year's depreciation needs to be increased to correct the error, which affects the income statement.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall accounting standards. When a prior period error is found, the correction is made by adjusting the current period's financial statements. The adjustment affects the current year's net income and the balance sheet.

In this case, the error was in the prior year's depreciation. To correct it, the company would increase the current year's depreciation expense by $40k and increase accumulated depreciation by $40k. So, in the current year's income statement, depreciation expense goes up by $40k, and on the balance sheet, accumulated depreciation increases by $40k.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: Increase depreciation expense by $32k (which is 80% of 40k, but why?)

B: Increase by $40k.

C: Increase by $48k (which is 120% of 40k, but why?)

D: Decrease by $32k.

E: Decrease accumulated depreciation by $32k.

F: Decrease by $40k.

G: Increase accumulated depreciation by $32k.

H: Increase by $48k.

I: Decrease by $40k.

J: Increase by $40k.

Wait, so the options for the income statement are B, C, D, F. The options for accumulated depreciation are E, G, H, I, J.

So, the correct answer would be both B and J, but since the options are separate, perhaps the question is focusing on one aspect. But the question is about how to report the correction, so perhaps it's about the income statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correction is made by increasing accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is option J, because that's the balance sheet adjustment, and the income statement adjustment is a consequence.

Wait, but the question is about reporting the correction in the current year. So, the correction would involve an adjustment to the current year's financials. That would mean both increasing the current year's depreciation expense and the accumulated depreciation.

But the options don't have both, so perhaps the answer is to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm still confused. Let me try to find a clear example. Suppose in the prior year, the company didn't record $40k depreciation. So, their financial statements show lower depreciation expense and lower accumulated depreciation than they should.

To correct this, in the current year, they need to increase both the current year's depreciation expense by $40k and increase accumulated depreciation by $40k.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer would involve both, but since the options are separate, perhaps the question is asking about the effect on the income statement, which would be an increase in depreciation expense of $40k (option B). Alternatively, the effect on the balance sheet would be an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40k (option J).

But the question is about how to report the correction, so perhaps both need to be considered, but the options don't combine them. However, the options are separate, so I think the correct answer is to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: perhaps the company should increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which would require an increase in depreciation expense in the current year, but the accumulated depreciation adjustment is on the balance sheet.

So, the correct answer is option J: As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40,000.

But earlier I thought it was option B. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the treatment for adjusting prior period errors. When you find a prior period error, you adjust the current period's retained earnings. But for the income statement, you adjust the current year's expenses.

Wait, no, prior period adjustments are accounted for by adjusting retained earnings, not the current period's income. So, the correction would involve debiting Depreciation Expense (Prior Year) for $40k and crediting Accumulated Depreciation for $40k. But since the prior year's financials are closed, the adjustment is made in the current year by increasing the accumulated depreciation and decreasing retained earnings.

But that's more about the treatment in the financial statements. So, the accumulated depreciation is increased by $40k, which is option J.

I think I've circled enough. The correct answer is to increase accumulated depreciation by $40k, which is option J.

The question involves correcting a prior year error where Holt Co. failed to report $40,000 of depreciation related to a building. The depreciation was correctly computed for tax purposes, meaning the tax return already included the $40,000 deduction. The task is to determine how Holt Co. should report the correction in the current year.

To correct the error, the company must adjust both the income statement and the balance sheet. The prior year's depreciation expense was understated by $40,000, leading to an overstatement of net income. Additionally, the accumulated depreciation on the balance sheet was also understated by $40,000. 

Since the prior year's financial statements are closed, the correction must be made in the current year. This involves increasing the current year's depreciation expense by $40,000 to reflect the missed amount and increasing the accumulated depreciation by $40,000 to correctly reflect the asset's value. 

Among the options provided, the focus is on how the correction is reported in the current year. The adjustment to the balance sheet, increasing accumulated depreciation by $40,000, is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the error and aligns with the accounting treatment for prior period adjustments.
