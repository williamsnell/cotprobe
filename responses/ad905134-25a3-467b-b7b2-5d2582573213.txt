Options:

B: Attitudes and expectancy only affect long-term memory.
C: Attitudes and expectancy alter the intensity of stimuli required to capture attention.
D: Attitudes and expectancy only affect attention during high-stress situations.

F: Attitudes and expectancy only influence our perception of size and duration.
G: Attitudes and expectancy change the sensory modalities we pay attention to.
H: Attitudes and expectancy guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.
I: Attitudes and expectancy primarily determine the accuracy of our visual attention.
J: Attitudes and expectancy have no effect on attention.

Okay, so I have this question about the role of attitudes and expectancy in attention. Hmm, I remember that attention is about how we focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others. Attitudes are like our evaluations or feelings about things, right? And expectancy is about what we anticipate will happen.

I think attitudes can influence what we pay attention to. For example, if someone has a positive attitude towards a particular brand, they might pay more attention to ads from that brand. So it affects what stands out to them.

Expectancy might make us more alert to certain things. Like if I'm expecting the phone to ring, I might be more attentive to any sounds that could be the phone. So it's about making certain stimuli more noticeable.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option H says that attitudes and expectancy guide the focus by making relevant info salient and excluding others. That sounds right because if you expect something, you're more likely to notice it, and your attitude towards it makes it more relevant.

Option C says they alter the intensity needed to capture attention. I'm not sure. Maybe that's more about the actual strength of the stimulus, not about our internal states. 

Option E talks about increasing the speed of processing for all info. That doesn't seem right because it's more specific; expectancies and attitudes make some info faster but not all.

Option I says they determine the accuracy of visual attention. I think it's broader than just accuracy; it's about what gets focused on in the first place.

Option J says they have no effect, which is wrong because I know they do influence attention.

So, the best fit is option H. It captures how our internal states (attitudes and expectancies) shape what we focus on by making some info more prominent and others less so.

The role of attitudes and expectancy in attention involves shaping what we focus on by making certain information more prominent. Attitudes influence our evaluations and feelings toward stimuli, affecting what stands out, while expectancy makes us more alert to anticipated events. Option H correctly states that these factors guide attention by highlighting relevant information and excluding others. 

Answer: H
