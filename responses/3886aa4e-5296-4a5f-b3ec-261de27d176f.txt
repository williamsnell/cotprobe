Okay, so I need to find the minimum vertex cover of an undirected graph G. The edges are given as E = {<0,1>, <4,1>, <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>, <1,3>}. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. And the minimum vertex cover is the smallest such set.

First, I should probably draw the graph to visualize it better. Let's list out the nodes involved: 0,1,2,3,4. So nodes are 0,1,2,3,4.

Edges:
- 0 connected to 1
- 1 connected to 4
- 2 connected to 0
- 2 connected to 1
- 2 connected to 3
- 1 connected to 3

So, node 0 is connected to 1 and 2.
Node 1 is connected to 0,4,2,3.
Node 2 is connected to 0,1,3.
Node 3 is connected to 2,1.
Node 4 is connected to 1.

Hmm, the graph looks a bit like this:

- 0 is connected to 1 and 2.
- 1 is in the center, connected to 0,4,2,3.
- 2 is connected to 0,1,3.
- 3 is connected to 2 and 1.
- 4 is only connected to 1.

I remember that the vertex cover problem is equivalent to finding a dominating set, and it's NP-hard, but since the graph is small, I can probably find the minimum manually.

The goal is to select the smallest number of vertices such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set.

Let me think about possible strategies. One approach is to look for edges and see which vertices cover the most edges.

Looking at node 1: it's connected to 0,4,2,3. So selecting node 1 would cover edges <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>.

That's four edges covered just by selecting 1. That's a lot. Then, what's left are the edges not covered by 1.

Wait, what edges are left? Let's see:

If I pick 1, the edges covered are <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>. What remains are the edges that don't involve 1. Let's check:

- <2,0>: This edge connects 2 and 0. Neither is 1, so this edge remains.
- <2,3>: This connects 2 and 3. 3 is connected via 1, but the edge between 2 and 3 is another edge. Wait, no. Since 1 is connected to 3, so if 1 is in the cover, then <1,3> is covered, but <2,3> is another edge. So if 1 is selected, does that cover <2,3>? No, because 1 is not connected to 2 and 3 in that edge. So <2,3> is still an edge that needs to be covered.

Wait, no. The edge <2,3> is between 2 and 3. So, if I have 1 in the cover, that doesn't affect <2,3>. So after selecting 1, the remaining edges are <0,2> and <2,3>.

So the remaining edges are between 0-2 and 2-3.

So after selecting 1, I need to cover these two edges. How can I do that with the fewest vertices.

Option 1: Select 2. If I select 2, then both edges <0,2> and <2,3> are covered. So that would cover everything. So the vertex cover would be {1,2}, which has size 2.

But wait, is that correct? Let me check:

Edges covered by 1: <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>.
Edges covered by 2: <0,2>, <2,3>.
So all edges are covered. So the vertex cover is {1,2}, which is option H.

But wait, let me see if there's a smaller vertex cover. The minimum cannot be less than 2 because there are edges that are not overlapping. For example, the edges <0,2> and <2,3> both involve 2, so selecting 2 covers both. Alternatively, selecting 0 and 3 would also cover <0,2> and <2,3> via 0 and 3 respectively, but that would be a size of 2 as well.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to have a vertex cover of size 2 without including 1. Let's see.

Suppose I don't select 1. Then I need to cover all edges connected to 1 via other nodes.

Edges connected to 1 are <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>.

To cover <0,1> without selecting 1, I need to select 0.

To cover <4,1> without selecting 1, I need to select 4.

To cover <2,1> without selecting 1, I need to select 2.

To cover <1,3> without selecting 1, I need to select 3.

So that would require selecting 0,2,4,3. Which is four nodes, which is larger than 2, so worse.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting 0,2,3.

Wait, let's see. If I select 0,2,3, would that cover all edges?

Edges:

<0,1>: covered by 0.

<4,1>: need to cover 4 or 1. 4 is not selected, 1 is not selected. So this edge is not covered. So that's a problem. So that approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, selecting 0,4,2,3: but that's four nodes, which is worse than 2.

So, selecting 1 and 2 seems better.

Another approach: Let's try to find the maximum matching and use Konig's theorem, which states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching. But wait, is this graph bipartite?

Looking at the connections. Let's see if there's any odd-length cycles.

Looking at the graph:

0-1-2-0: that's a triangle, a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So the graph is not bipartite. Therefore, Konig's theorem doesn't apply, so I can't use that method here.

Hmm, okay, so back to manual checking.

Let me list all possible vertex covers of size 2 and see if any of them cover all edges.

Option A: [0,1]. Let's see:

Edges:

<0,1>: covered.

<4,1>: covered by 1.

<2,0>: covered by 0.

<2,1>: covered by 1.

<2,3>: neither 0 nor 1 is in the edge, so this edge is not covered. So [0,1] is not a valid vertex cover.

Option B: [1,3,4]. Wait, that's size 3. But I think I can do better with size 2. So I'll skip for now.

Option C: [1,2,3]. Size 3. Not better than 2.

Option D: [2,3,4]. Size 3.

Option E: [0,2,4]. Size 3.

Option F: [0,1,2]. Size 3.

Option G: [0,4]. Size 2.

Check if [0,4] is a vertex cover.

Edges:

<0,1>: covered by 0.

<4,1>: covered by 4.

<2,0>: covered by 0.

<2,1>: neither 0 nor 4 is connected to 2 or 1. So edge <2,1> is not covered. So [0,4] is not a valid vertex cover.

Option H: [1,2]. Size 2.

Check edges:

<0,1>: covered by 1.

<4,1>: covered by 1.

<2,0>: covered by 2.

<2,1>: covered by 1 or 2.

<2,3>: covered by 2.

<1,3>: covered by 1.

So all edges are covered. So [1,2] is a valid vertex cover of size 2.

Is there a vertex cover of size 1? Let's check.

If I pick 1: does it cover all edges?

Edges connected to 1 are covered, but what about <2,3>? 1 is not connected to 2 or 3 in that edge, so <2,3> is not covered. So 1 alone is insufficient.

Similarly, if I pick 2: does it cover all edges?

Edges connected to 2 are <0,2>, <2,1>, <2,3>. So those are covered. But what about <0,1> and <4,1>? Neither 0 nor 4 is selected, so those edges are not covered. So 2 alone is insufficient.

If I pick 3: covers <2,3> and <1,3>, but leaves other edges uncovered.

If I pick 4: covers <4,1>, but leaves others.

If I pick 0: covers <0,1> and <2,0>, but leaves others.

So no single vertex can cover all edges. So minimum size is 2.

So the minimal vertex cover is [1,2], which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option H is [1,2], which is size 2.

Is there any other vertex cover of size 2 that's smaller? Well, size 2 is the minimal possible given that some edges are non-overlapping.

Another option: [2,3]. Let's see.

[2,3] covers:

<2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>, <3,1>.

But what about <0,1>, <4,1>? Neither 0,1 is selected, so those edges are not covered. So [2,3] is not sufficient.

Similarly, [0,3]:

Covers <0,1>, <0,2>, <3,1>, <3,2>.

But <4,1> is not covered, as neither 4 nor 1 is selected. So that's not a cover.

What about [1,3]:

Covers <0,1>, <4,1>, <1,3>, <2,1>, <2,3> (because 3 is selected, so <2,3> is covered). But what about <2,0>? Neither 2 nor 0 is selected, so edge <2,0> is not covered. So that's a problem. So [1,3] is not a cover.

Another option: [1,4]. Let's see.

Covers <0,1>, <4,1>, <1,3>, and <2,1>. But <2,0> and <2,3> are not covered. So no.

So the only vertex cover of size 2 I found is [1,2], which is option H.
</think>

The minimum vertex cover of the given graph G is found by selecting the smallest set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in the set. After analyzing the graph and testing various combinations, the smallest vertex cover is determined to be [1, 2], which covers all edges in the graph.
