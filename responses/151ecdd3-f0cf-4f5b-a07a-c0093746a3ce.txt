Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?

Options:

A: A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.
B: After consuming a large amount of alcohol at a party, a defendant decided to set a neighbor's car on fire out of spite. He was seen by witnesses and later arrested and charged with arson.
C: A defendant had been drinking at a local pub and got into a heated argument with another patron. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the other patron. The defendant is arrested and charged with attempted murder.
D: A defendant had consumed a fifth of bourbon. Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.
E: A defendant spent the evening drinking at a bar. On his way home, he broke into a house, intending to steal valuables. However, he fell asleep on the couch before he could steal anything. He was discovered by the homeowners and arrested and charged with attempted robbery.
F: At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.
G: A defendant was drinking at a bar when he noticed a woman leave her purse unattended. He stole the purse and was later arrested and charged with theft.
H: A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.
I: A defendant had been drinking heavily at a friend's house. Later that evening, he decided to drive home despite being significantly over the legal blood alcohol limit. On the way, he ran a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The defendant is arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter.
J: After a night of heavy drinking, a defendant broke into a jewelry store and stole several expensive items. He was caught on the store's surveillance cameras and later arrested and charged with burglary.

Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So the question is about when a defendant's intoxication can't negate their criminal culpability. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal law, but I remember that intoxication can sometimes be a defense, depending on the situation.

The question is asking which of the options (A to J) is a situation where the defendant's intoxication wouldn't help them avoid criminal responsibility. So I need to look at each option and see if the crime is specific intent or general intent, because I think that's the key here. Specific intent crimes require the defendant to have a particular intent, and if they're too intoxicated, they might not have that intent. But general intent crimes don't require that specific state of mind, so intoxication might not be a defense there.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. Conspiracy is a specific intent crime because it requires the intent to agree and to commit the underlying crime. If the defendant was too drunk to form that intent, maybe he could use intoxication as a defense. So in this case, his intoxication might negate his culpability.

Option B: Arson after consuming a lot of alcohol. Arson is a specific intent crime because you have to willfully set fire to a structure. If he was so drunk he didn't have the intent, maybe he can use that. But wait, I'm not sure if intent is the same as being aware of what he's doing. If he was so intoxicated he didn't know what he was doing, maybe it's still possible to negate intent. But I'm not certain. I'll have to think more.

Option C: Attempted murder after a heated argument and stabbing. Attempted murder is a specific intent crime because you need the intent to kill. If he was too drunk to form that intent, maybe he can argue it. But sometimes, if the act is so inherently dangerous, like using a knife, the intent to cause serious harm might be inferred. But I'm not sure. Maybe intoxication could still be a defense here.

Option D: Assault with intent to commit rape. So this is also a specific intent crime because you need the intent to commit the underlying felony (rape). If the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, maybe he can use that as a defense. Wait, but sometimes, for assault, it's about the intent to cause harmful contact. But if the intent is for rape, which is specific, maybe intoxication could negate that.

Option E: Attempted robbery after drinking. Attempted robbery requires specific intent to commit the robbery. If he was too intoxicated to form that intent, he might have a defense. But in this case, he actually fell asleep, so maybe he didn't take any actions towards the robbery. But the charge is attempted robbery, so maybe the intent is what matters. If he was too drunk, he might not have the specific intent, so intoxication could negate it.

Option F: Statutory rape after drinking. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime regarding the age, I think. So even if he thought she was older, he's still guilty because he had sex with someone under the age of consent. Intoxication doesn't negate the mens rea here because it's strict liability; you don't need to have the intent to commit a specific act beyond the sexual act itself. So in this case, his intoxication wouldn't matter because the law doesn't require specific intent for statutory rape. He just needs to have committed the act, regardless of his intoxication.

Option G: Theft after drinking. Theft is a specific intent crime in some jurisdictions, requiring the intent to permanently deprive the owner of their property. If he was too drunk to form that intent, maybe he can use that as a defense. But some places treat theft as a general intent crime, so intoxication wouldn't help. I'm not sure about this one.

Option H: Assault with intent to commit battery. Battery is usually a general intent crime, but if it's with the intent to commit a battery, maybe it's specific. The defendant threw a tire iron, missing the attendant and hitting someone else. If he was too drunk to form the intent, perhaps he could argue it. But again, not sure.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter after drinking. Vehicular manslaughter typically requires recklessness or negligent conduct. If he was too intoxicated to form the intent to be reckless, maybe he can't be held responsible. But I think vehicular manslaughter is a general intent crime, so intoxication might not negate it. Wait, no, because if he was so drunk that he didn't realize the risk, maybe he can't form the mens rea.

Option J: Burglary after heavy drinking. Burglary is the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. If he was too drunk to form that intent, he might have a defense. But if the act of breaking in was so obvious that the intent can be inferred, maybe not. But I think burglary requires specific intent, so intoxication could negate it.

Now, the question is which situation where intoxication cannot negate culpability. So the answer would be the situation where the crime doesn't require specific intent, meaning intoxication isn't a defense. From the above, I think F is the right answer because statutory rape is strict liability regarding the age, so even if the defendant was intoxicated, he can't use that as a defense because he didn't need to have specific intent beyond the act itself. The other options involve specific intent crimes where intoxication could potentially negate the required intent, but F is a strict liability crime, so intoxication doesn't help.

In this question, the key is to determine which crime is a strict liability offense, meaning the defendant's intoxication cannot negate their criminal culpability because the crime does not require a specific intent. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime in many jurisdictions, where the age of the victim is the determining factor, and the defendant's belief or intoxication does not matter. Therefore, the defendant's intoxication cannot negate his culpability in this situation.

Answer: F
