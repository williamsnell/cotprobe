Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear reaction problem. The question is about finding the Q value of a reaction when given the kinetic energies of outgoing particles. Hmm, I remember that the Q value is related to the energy released or absorbed in the reaction. 

Alright, let me start by recalling some concepts. In nuclear reactions, the Q value is calculated as the difference between the rest mass energies of the products and reactants. But wait, when the reaction is initiated by alpha particles, which are moving, I think I need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum. 

The problem states that the incoming alpha particles have an energy of 5.5 MeV. The outgoing particles have kinetic energies of 1.1 MeV and 8.4 MeV. So, the reaction probably involves an alpha particle colliding with another nucleus, producing two particles as products.

I remember that in such reactions, the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle contributes to the Q value. But wait, the Q value is the total energy released, considering the rest masses. Or is it just the kinetic energy part? Hmm, maybe I should think about the total energy involved.

Wait, the Q value is the total energy released in the reaction, considering the rest mass differences. So, the formula should be Q = (sum of rest masses of products) - (sum of rest masses of reactants). But since the alpha particle is moving, its kinetic energy might be part of the total energy.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the conservation of energy. The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energy of the alpha particle plus any other reactants, plus the kinetic energy of the alpha. The total final energy would be the rest masses of the products plus their kinetic energies. But this might get complicated because I don't have the masses of the reactants and products.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of kinetic energies only. The Q value is the kinetic energy released in the reaction. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Actually, the Q value is the net energy change in the reaction, which includes the rest mass differences. So, if an alpha particle (He-4 nucleus) hits another nucleus, say X, and produces two particles, Y and Z, then the Q value is (mass of Y + mass of Z) - (mass of X + mass of alpha). But I don't have the masses here, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The outgoing particles' kinetic energies are given, and we need to find the Q value. I think the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products minus the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the initial kinetic energy is part of the system, but the Q value represents the energy available for the reaction, which would be the kinetic energy plus any rest mass changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the Q value is the total kinetic energy of the products minus the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle. So, let's see: the products have kinetic energies of 1.1 and 8.4 MeV, so total is 9.5 MeV. The alpha has 5.5 MeV. So, 9.5 - 5.5 = 4.0 MeV? But wait, that would be the case if the Q was the sum of the products' kinetic energies minus the initial, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in a nuclear reaction, the Q value is the total energy released, which would be the sum of the kinetic energies of all products minus the initial kinetic energy of the projectile (alpha particle) plus any other reactants. But in this case, the problem states it's initiated by alpha particles, so maybe the target is a stationary nucleus, and the initial energy is just the alpha's kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the Q value is the kinetic energy of the products minus the initial kinetic energy of the alpha. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the Q value is the maximum kinetic energy available for the products when the reaction is at threshold. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy conservation. The total initial energy is the kinetic energy of the alpha plus the rest mass energy of the target nucleus. The total final energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products plus their rest mass energies. But without knowing the masses, this might not be possible.

Wait, but perhaps the Q value is the difference between the kinetic energies of the products and the initial alpha's kinetic energy. So, 1.1 + 8.4 = 9.5 MeV, minus 5.5 MeV gives 4.0 MeV. That would be option D.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. Q value is the total energy released, so if the alpha has 5.5 MeV, and the products have 9.5 MeV in kinetic energy, then the reaction must have Q = 9.5 -5.5 =4.0 MeV. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe the Q value is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products. But that would be 9.5, which isn't an option. The options include 4.0 (D) and 9.0 (B), but 9.5 isn't there, so probably 4.0 is the right choice.

The Q value of the reaction can be determined by considering the kinetic energies of the incoming and outgoing particles. The incoming alpha particle has a kinetic energy of 5.5 MeV, while the outgoing particles have kinetic energies of 1.1 MeV and 8.4 MeV. The total kinetic energy of the outgoing particles is 1.1 + 8.4 = 9.5 MeV. The Q value represents the net energy released in the reaction, which is the difference between the total kinetic energy of the products and the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle. Therefore, the Q value is calculated as:

\[
Q = 9.5 \, \text{MeV} - 5.5 \, \text{MeV} = 4.0 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the Q value of the reaction is **4.0 MeV**.
