Question:

The police received a report that women dressed as superheroes had robbed a man in his house and stolen many of his valuables. The only way onto or off the island where he lived was a ferry. The last ferry was getting ready to leave for the night when the report came in to the police. Without attempting to get a warrant, the police stopped all the cars waiting for the ferry. In one vehicle, the police noticed three women fidgeting rather nervously. Upon searching their auto, the police found the victim's stolen property hidden under the front seat. The defendants were immediately placed under arrest. At their trial for armed robbery, the defendants move to suppress the use of the property confiscated by the police as evidence. Their motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the police did not have specific evidence linking the women to the crime before searching their car.
B: denied, because the police had probable cause to search their car and, under the circumstances, no warrant was required.
C: granted, because the police violated the women's Fourth Amendment rights by searching their car without a warrant.
D: denied, because the police had the right to search any vehicle in the vicinity of a reported crime.
E: denied, because the situation constituted an exception to the warrant requirement due to exigent circumstances.
F: granted, because the police did not have a warrant and also did not have reasonable suspicion to search their car.
G: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to search their car.
H: denied, because the police had the right to stop and search vehicles at the ferry terminal due to the public safety risk.
I: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to suspect that their car contained evidence of the crime.
J: denied, because even though the detention was unlawful, the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that their car contained evidence of the crime since they observed the women fidgeting nervously.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the Fourth Amendment and the admissibility of evidence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that some women dressed as superheroes robbed a man in his house and stole his valuables. The only way on or off the island is a ferry. The last ferry was about to leave when the police got the report. The police stopped all cars waiting for the ferry without getting a warrant. In one car, the women were fidgeting nervously, and the police found stolen property under the front seat. The defendants are moving to suppress the evidence. The question is whether the motion should be granted or denied and why.

I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, which generally require a warrant based on probable cause. However, there are exceptions where a warrant isn't needed. Exigent circumstances is one such exception. Exigent circumstances mean that there's an urgent need for action, like when evidence might be destroyed or when there's a risk of immediate harm.

In this case, the police stopped all cars at the ferry terminal. The ferry was the only way off the island, so the women would likely try to escape. The fact that the ferry was about to leave suggests that the police had a reason to act quickly to prevent the suspects from fleeing. That sounds like an exigent circumstance because they needed to act before the ferry departed to catch the criminals.

When the police stopped all the cars, they saw the women fidgeting nervously. Fidgeting can be a sign of nervousness, which might give the police some reasonable suspicion. But in this case, the main issue is whether the search of the car was legal without a warrant.

I think the key here is whether the police had probable cause and whether exigent circumstances applied. Since the ferry was about to leave, and the suspects were likely trying to escape with the stolen goods, the police could argue that they needed to search the cars immediately to prevent the evidence from being taken off the island. This would fall under the exigent circumstances exception, making the search lawful without a warrant.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the motion should be denied because the situation was an exception due to exigent circumstances. That seems correct because the urgency of the situation justified the search without a warrant.

Option B also mentions probable cause and no warrant needed. But I think the reasoning here is more about the specific exception rather than just probable cause alone. Probable cause is required for a search, but without a warrant, you need an exception like exigent circumstances.

Option F and G talk about not having a warrant and no reasonable suspicion, but the police did have probable cause because they found the stolen goods, and the situation was urgent. So those options don't seem right.

Option J mentions reasonable suspicion because of the fidgeting. But the main issue is the need to act quickly, not just reasonable suspicion. The fidgeting might support reasonable suspicion, but the key exception is exigent circumstances.

So I think the correct answer is E because the police had an exception under exigent circumstances, allowing them to search without a warrant.

The scenario involves a police search conducted without a warrant due to the urgency of the situation, which falls under the Fourth Amendment's exception for exigent circumstances. The ferry was the only means of escape, and the police acted promptly to prevent the theft from being carried off the island. This justified the search without a warrant. 

Answer: E
