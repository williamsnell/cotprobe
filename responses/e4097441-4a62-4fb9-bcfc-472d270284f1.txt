Okay, so I've got this question about astronomical units, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about AU. I remember that an astronomical unit is a unit of length used in astronomy, and it's roughly the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. I think it's about 150 million kilometers, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, I've heard it's approximately 93 million miles, and since 1 mile is about 1.60934 kilometers, I can calculate that. So 93 million times 1.60934... Let me do that roughly. 93 million is 93,000,000. Multiply by 1.60934: 93 million * 1.6 is about 148.8 million km. So that's around 149 million km. Hmm, but I also remember sometimes it's approximated as 150 million for simplicity.

Looking at the options: A is 150 million, B is 140, C is 180, D is 170, E is 200, F is 210, G is 190, H is 160, I is 100, J is 130. So the closest is A at 150 million. But wait, I thought the exact figure is about 149.6 million km. So 150 would be the approximate value. Therefore, option A is correct.

I'm pretty confident it's A. I don't think it's any other number because the other options are either too high or too low. For example, 140 million is a bit off from 149.6, and 160 is even further away. So yeah, A makes sense.

The correct answer is A: 150 million km.
