Okay, so I have this question about banking and how excess reserves change. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is: Excess reserves in the banking system will increase if... and there are several options to choose from. I remember that excess reserves are the funds a bank holds beyond the required reserves set by the central bank. So, when a bank has more reserves than required, that's excess reserves.

Let me recall what factors affect excess reserves. I think the reserve ratio, which is the percentage of deposits that banks must hold as reserves, is one of them. If the reserve ratio decreases, banks are required to hold less money in reserves. So, if they have the same amount of deposits, their required reserves go down, which means their excess reserves go up. So option A, where the reserve ratio is decreased, might be a correct scenario for excess reserves increasing.

Another factor is the discount rate, which is the interest rate the Fed charges when banks borrow from it. If the discount rate decreases, it becomes cheaper for banks to borrow money. But wait, why would that increase excess reserves? Maybe if borrowing is cheaper, banks might borrow more, but that would actually increase their liabilities, not necessarily their reserves. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this one. Maybe a lower discount rate makes it easier for banks to get funds, but I'm not sure how that directly affects their excess reserves. I'll have to think about this more.

Option C says the Fed reduces the amount of money in circulation. If there's less money in circulation, that could mean that people have less money to deposit into banks. So banks would have fewer deposits, which means their required reserves would be lower. But if their deposits go down, and they have to hold a lower reserve, maybe their excess reserves could increase because their required reserves are lower. Or, wait, less money in circulation might mean less deposits, so banks have less to work with, but their excess reserves are what's left after required reserves. So if deposits decrease, required reserves decrease, but if the Fed reduces the money supply, maybe the banks' excess reserves could increase? I'm not entirely certain.

Option D is if the discount rate is increased. A higher discount rate would make borrowing more expensive for banks. But why would that affect excess reserves? If banks find it more expensive to borrow, they might not borrow as much, but again, I'm not sure how that impacts their excess reserves. Maybe if they have fewer borrowings, their reserves might not go up necessarily. I'm not too confident about this one either.

Option E says checking deposits increase. Checking deposits are part of the money that banks must hold as reserves. If deposits go up, the required reserves increase because required reserves are calculated as a percentage of deposits. So if E happens, required reserves go up. But the question is about excess reserves increasing. Excess reserves are total reserves minus required reserves. If required reserves increase, but total reserves don't change, excess reserves would decrease. So E would lead to lower excess reserves, not higher. So E is not the answer.

Option F is checking deposits decrease. If deposits go down, required reserves go down. If the total reserves (which are fixed unless other actions happen) are more than the new lower required reserves, then excess reserves would increase. So F could be a possibility. But wait, do banks' total reserves change when deposits change? If the Fed doesn't change anything else, like not adjusting the money supply, then if deposits drop, required reserves drop, so excess reserves could go up. But maybe the Fed's actions also affect total reserves. I'm a bit confused here.

Option G: the Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks. When the Fed sells securities, it's a contractionary move. Banks buy these securities, which means they pay money to the Fed. That would decrease the banks' reserves because they're using their reserves to buy the securities. So selling securities would reduce excess reserves, making G not the correct answer.

Option H: the interest rate on loans is increased. If banks charge more interest on loans, they might make more profit, but how does that affect their reserves? Maybe they'd have more income, but that doesn't directly increase their reserves. Or perhaps if the interest rate increases, it might encourage more borrowing, which could increase deposits, but that would tie back to E, which we saw might decrease excess reserves. Not sure, but H doesn't seem directly related to increasing excess reserves.

Option I: the Fed buys Treasury securities from commercial banks. When the Fed buys securities, it's an expansionary move. It pays for them by increasing the reserves in the banks. So when the Fed buys, it adds money to the banks' reserves. This would increase their total reserves. If their required reserves haven't changed, then excess reserves would go up because total reserves are up. So I think I is a correct scenario for excess reserves increasing.

Option J: the reserve ratio is increased. If the reserve ratio goes up, banks must hold more reserves relative to deposits. If the reserve ratio increases, required reserves go up, so excess reserves (total minus required) would decrease unless total reserves also increase, which isn't mentioned here. So J would likely decrease excess reserves.

So summarizing:

- A: Decrease reserve ratio → required reserves decrease, so excess reserves increase. So A is a possibility.
- I: Fed buys securities → total reserves increase, so excess reserves increase. So I is another possibility.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the question is asking which action would increase excess reserves. So both A and I could be correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are single letters, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

When the Fed buys securities (I), it adds to the banks' reserves, so total reserves go up. If required reserves are the same (reserve ratio hasn't changed), then excess reserves would increase because total is up. So I is correct.

When the reserve ratio decreases (A), required reserves go down. If total reserves stay the same, excess reserves would increase. So A is also correct.

Wait, but in the options, the answer is only one option. So perhaps I need to see which options are presented.

Looking back at the options, the options are A through J. The question is asking when excess reserves will increase.

So both A and I could lead to increased excess reserves. But perhaps in the given options, only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: reserve ratio decreased.

I: Fed buys securities.

So in reality, both actions can increase excess reserves. But perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the Fed buying securities (I) increases the banks' total reserves, so if their total reserves go up, and required reserves are the same, excess goes up. So I is correct.

Similarly, if the reserve ratio is decreased (A), required reserves decrease, so excess reserves increase if total reserves are the same.

So both A and I would lead to increased excess reserves. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is either A or I, but in the options, I is option I.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The question is a multiple-choice, and perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I is correct because the Fed's action directly adds to the banks' reserves. Similarly, A is correct because a lower reserve ratio allows more excess. So both A and I would increase excess reserves. But in the options, are both A and I present?

Looking back, the options are:

A: reserve ratio decreased.

I: Fed buys securities.

So in some cases, both could be correct, but the options might have only one as the correct answer. Maybe the question expects both, but in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A and I. But since it's a single choice, maybe only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and I, but the options list them as separate. So perhaps the intended answer is I, because the Fed's action directly increases the total reserves, leading to higher excess. Or it could be both, but in the options, only one is provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is either A or I, depending on the context. Wait, the question is about when excess reserves will increase. So both actions would cause it.

But looking for the options, perhaps the correct answers are A and I. But in the options provided, perhaps only I is correct because A would allow banks to hold less, but if their deposits are the same, their excess would increase.

Wait, but the question is about which action causes excess reserves to increase. So both A and I are correct. But looking back, perhaps the correct answer is I. Because the Fed buying securities directly increases the banks' reserves, which would definitely increase their excess reserves, assuming required reserves don't change.

But then again, if the reserve ratio is decreased, the required reserves go down, so excess goes up.

So perhaps both A and I are correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, perhaps the answer is A and I.

But the options are from A to J, and the answer requires selecting one. So perhaps the intended correct answer is I, because that's a direct action by the Fed that adds to the banks' reserves, whereas a lower reserve ratio is a regulatory change that allows more excess, but perhaps the question is looking for the Fed's action.

Wait, the question is about what will cause excess reserves to increase, and the options include both Fed actions and reserve ratio changes.

So perhaps the correct answer is I, because when the Fed buys securities, it injects money into the banking system, increasing their reserves, thus increasing excess reserves.

Alternatively, a lower reserve ratio (A) would also increase excess reserves, but perhaps the question expects I as the answer.

Wait, but I think both A and I are correct. However, perhaps the intended answer is I because it's a more direct method.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it differently.

Excess reserves = total reserves - required reserves.

If the Fed buys securities (I), total reserves increase. If required reserves stay the same, excess goes up.

If the reserve ratio decreases (A), required reserves decrease. If total reserves stay the same, excess goes up.

So both A and I can cause excess reserves to increase. But the options are separate, so perhaps the answer includes both, but the options are single letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and I, but since the options are single letters, perhaps the intended answer is I because it's an action by the Fed, which is more likely to be the correct choice in this context.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider each option's impact again.

Option A: reserve ratio decreased. Yes, this reduces required reserves, so excess increases.

Option I: Fed buys securities. Yes, this increases total reserves, so excess increases.

So both A and I are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is A and I. But since it's a multiple-choice with only one correct option, perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is both A and I, but the options don't include such a choice. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is also A, because lowering the reserve ratio allows more excess. So perhaps both are correct, but the options only have one.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for which options are correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and I, but in the options, the user is to select one. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but in the options, the correct answer is I and A. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the correct answer is I.

I think I'll go with I as the correct answer because the Fed buying securities directly adds to the banks' reserves, which increases excess reserves. So the answer is I.
</think>

Excess reserves in the banking system increase when factors that reduce required reserves or increase total reserves occur. 

- **Option A**: Decreasing the reserve ratio reduces the amount banks must hold as required reserves, allowing excess reserves to increase.  
- **Option I**: When the Fed buys Treasury securities, it injects money into the banking system, increasing total reserves. If required reserves remain unchanged, excess reserves rise.  

Both A and I can increase excess reserves, but the question asks for a single answer. The Fed buying securities (I) directly increases total reserves, making it the more immediate cause. 

Answer: I
