Okay, so I have this question about the Internal-External Control Scale. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking to characterize someone who scores high on internality. Let me remember what internality means in this context.

From what I recall, the Internal-External Control Scale is about locus of control. People with an internal locus of control believe that they are the primary determinant of their success and that their own efforts and skills lead to their outcomes. On the other hand, those with an external locus of control think that external factors like luck, fate, or other people are more influential.

So the question is about high internality. Let's look at the options:

Option A says high internality believes success is mainly due to external factors. That sounds like the opposite of what I remember. High internal would mean they think it's their own doing, not external. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says high internality is dependent and easily influenced. That doesn't sound right. Internal people are more self-reliant, so B is likely wrong.

Option C describes someone as achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks using skills over chance. That fits with what I know about internal locus of control. They take charge and rely on their skills, so C seems correct.

Option D says they're passive and wait for others. That sounds more external because they're not taking control. So D is incorrect.

Option E says they're unsuccessful and lack ambition. High internal people are proactive, so E doesn't fit. They should be more successful, so E is wrong.

Option F claims they feel little influence over outcomes. That's the opposite again. High internal people think they have control, so F is incorrect.

Option G says they prefer tasks relying on luck. No, internal people prefer skill-based tasks, so G is wrong.

Option H says they blame others for mistakes. That's more external, because internal people take responsibility. So H is incorrect.

Option I says they experience anxiety due to uncontrollable events. Internal people believe they can control things, so maybe not as much anxiety. I'm not sure, but I think C is better.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: A person with high internality on the Internal-External Control Scale is likely to be achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks relying on skills rather than chance.
