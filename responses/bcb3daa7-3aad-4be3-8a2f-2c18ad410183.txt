Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about transmission probability in a semiconductor junction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the barrier has a height of 2.0 eV and a length of 100 pm. The electron has an energy of 1.5 eV. I need to find the transmission probability. The options are A to J, with various numbers.

Wait, transmission probability in a potential barrier... Oh right, this sounds like a problem involving the tunnel effect. Because when the electron's energy is less than the barrier height, it can tunnel through, and the transmission depends on the barrier's height and thickness.

I remember the formula for the transmission coefficient, T, which is given by something like T = exp(-2π∫√(V(x)-E)/ħ² dx), but maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, another approach is the WKB approximation. Because for thin barriers, the transmission is higher.

So the WKB formula for transmission probability T is exp(-2*(sqrt(2m(V-E)πL))/ħ), where L is the barrier thickness. Let me jot down the variables.

Given:
V0 = 2.0 eV (barrier height)
L = 100 pm = 1e-8 cm? Wait, better to keep it in meters. 100 pm is 1e-10 meters.
E = 1.5 eV.

Wait, but since E < V0, it's a tunneling scenario.

First, I think I should convert all energies to Joules because the constants like ħ and m are in SI units.

E = 1.5 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.5 * 1.602e-19 = 2.403e-19 J.

V0 = 2.0 eV = 3.204e-19 J.

The barrier height is V0, but in the WKB approximation, the relevant term is (V0 - E), right? Because that's the potential difference the electron has to overcome.

So, V0 - E = 3.204e-19 J - 2.403e-19 J = 0.801e-19 J.

But wait, the formula uses the square root of (V - E), so we'll have sqrt( (V0 - E) * 2m / ħ² ) multiplied by the barrier length L, then multiplied by 2π.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The transmission coefficient T is given by:

T = exp( - (2π/ħ) * sqrt(2m(V0 - E)) * L )

Wait, that's for the case where the barrier is rectangular. Let me make sure.

Yes, the WKB approximation for a rectangular barrier gives the transmission coefficient as T = exp(-2π sqrt(2m(V-E)L)/(ħ)). So that's the formula I need to use.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute sqrt(2m(V0-E)).

Mass m of an electron is 9.109e-31 kg.

So, 2m(V0-E) = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 0.801e-19 J.

Wait, let's compute that:

2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

Multiply by 0.801e-19 J: 1.8218e-30 * 0.801e-19 = let's compute that.

1.8218e-30 * 0.801 ≈ 1.459e-30, and then times 1e-19? Wait no, 0.801e-19 is 8.01e-20 J. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.801e-19 J is 8.01e-20 J.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. 0.801e-19 J is equal to 8.01e-20 J. So,

2m(V0 - E) = 2 * m * (V0 - E) = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-20 J.

Wait, no, no. Wait, V0 - E is 0.801e-19 J. So,

2m(V0-E) = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 0.801e-19 J.

Compute 9.109e-31 * 0.801e-19 = 9.109 * 0.801 = approx 7.299e-50? Wait, wait, exponents:

9.109e-31 * 0.801e-19 = 9.109 * 0.801 = ~7.299, and the exponents are 1e-31 * 1e-19 = 1e-50. So 7.299e-50.

Multiply by 2: 1.4598e-49 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s². So, 2m(V0-E) is in kg^2 m²/s²? Hmm, not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Anyway, let's compute the square root of 2m(V0-E):

sqrt(2m(V0-E)) = sqrt(1.4598e-49 kg^2 m²/s²) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(2m(V0-E)) as sqrt( (2m(V0-E)) ) which is in sqrt(kg·J), but maybe it's easier to compute it numerically.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: Let me compute the argument inside the square root, then take the square root.

So,

sqrt(2m (V0 - E)) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 0.801e-19 J).

Wait, but 0.801e-19 J is the same as 0.801e-19 kg·m²/s².

So, 2m(V0-E) is 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 0.801e-19 kg·m²/s².

Wait, that would be 1.459e-49 kg^2 m²/s².

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should compute it numerically.

Let me compute 2m(V0-E):

2 * 9.109e-31 kg = 1.8218e-30 kg.

Multiply by (V0-E) = 0.801e-19 J:

1.8218e-30 kg * 0.801e-19 J = 1.8218 * 0.801 = ~1.46e-49 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so 1.46e-49 kg * kg·m²/s² = 1.46e-49 kg² m²/s².

So, sqrt(2m(V0-E)) = sqrt(1.46e-49 kg² m²/s²) = sqrt(1.46e-49) ) * sqrt(kg² m²/s²).

Wait, sqrt(1.46e-49) is about 3.82e-25.

So, sqrt(kg² m²/s²) is kg m/s, so overall it's 3.82e-25 kg m/s.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm doing the units correctly. Maybe I should just proceed with the numbers.

Now, multiply this by the barrier length L = 100 pm = 1e-10 meters.

So, (sqrt(2m(V0-E)) ) * L = 3.82e-25 kg m/s * 1e-10 m = 3.82e-35 kg m²/s.

Now, the exponent in the transmission coefficient is (2π / ħ) multiplied by this value.

Wait, ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So,

(2π / ħ) * (sqrt(2m(V0-E)) * L ) = (2π / 1.0545718e-34) * 3.82e-35.

Let me compute each part.

First, compute 2π ≈ 6.2832.

Then compute 6.2832 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 6.2832 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 5.96e+34 s/J.

Wait, because J is kg m²/s², so 1/J = s²/(kg m²). Hmm, not sure, but let's proceed numerically.

Now, multiply that by 3.82e-35.

So,

(6.2832 / 1.0545718e-34) ) * 3.82e-35 ≈ (5.96e34) * 3.82e-35.

Multiply 5.96e34 by 3.82e-35:

5.96e34 * 3.82e-35 = (5.96 * 3.82) * 1e-1 = approx 22.76 * 0.1 = 2.276.

Wait, wait, 5.96 * 3.82 is approximately 5 * 3.82 = 19.1, plus 0.96 *3.82≈ 3.66, so total ≈ 22.76. So 22.76 * 1e-1 = 2.276.

So the exponent is approximately 2.276.

So the transmission coefficient T is exp(-2.276).

Compute exp(-2.276): e^(-2.276) ≈ 0.102.

Wait, e^2.276 is about e^2 is 7.389, e^0.276≈1.318, so 7.389 * 1.318 ≈ 9.736. So 1/9.736 ≈ 0.1027.

So T ≈ 0.103.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.1, which is close. But wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, first, the barrier height is 2 eV, and electron energy is 1.5 eV, so V0-E is 0.5 eV. Wait, wait, wait a second. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 2 eV minus 1.5 eV is 0.5 eV, not 0.801 eV as I thought earlier.

Ah! I think I messed up the numbers earlier. Because 2.0 eV minus 1.5 eV is 0.5 eV. So V0-E = 0.5 eV.

So I must have messed up the initial calculation, which would change everything.

Let me correct that.

So, V0-E = 0.5 eV = 0.5 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-20 J.

Now, 2m(V0-E) = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-20 J.

Compute 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

Multiply by 8.01e-20 J: 1.8218e-30 * 8.01e-20 = 1.8218 * 8.01 = about 14.59, and exponents 1e-30 * 1e-20 = 1e-50. So 14.59e-50, which is 1.459e-49 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so 2m(V0-E) is in kg^2 m²/s²?

Hmm, but I'm more concerned about the numerical value.

So sqrt(2m(V0-E)) = sqrt(1.459e-49 kg·m²/s²) = sqrt(1.459e-49) ) * m/s.

sqrt(1.459e-49) is approximately 3.82e-25 m/s.

Wait, no, because sqrt(kg·m²/s²) is (kg^(1/2) m)/s. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating the units. Let's just proceed.

So sqrt(2m(V0-E)) = 3.82e-25 m/s.

Multiply by L = 1e-10 m: 3.82e-25 * 1e-10 = 3.82e-35 m²/s.

Now, multiply by (2π/ħ):

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, 2π ≈ 6.2832.

So, (2π/ħ) = 6.2832 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 5.96e34 s/J.

Now, multiply this by (sqrt(2m(V0-E)) * L):

5.96e34 s/J * 3.82e-35 m²/s = 5.96e34 * 3.82e-35 = (5.96 * 3.82) * 1e-1.

5.96 * 3.82 ≈ 22.76, so 22.76 * 0.1 = 2.276.

So the exponent is 2.276, and the transmission coefficient T = exp(-2.276) ≈ 0.1027.

So T is approximately 0.103, which is about 0.1 or 10%. Looking at the options, option I is 0.1, and option J is 0.6. So the closest is I: 0.1.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, another approach: The transmission probability for a rectangular barrier in WKB approximation is T = exp(-2 * (sqrt(2m(V-E)) * L ) / ħ ).

Wait, I think I may have missed a factor of 2 in the exponent. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, no, in the WKB formula, the transmission coefficient is T = exp( - (2π/ħ) * sqrt(2m(V-E)) * L ), right? Because the expression inside the exponential is the integral of the exponential term times 2π over ħ.

Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as T = exp( - 2 * sqrt(2m(V-E) L^2 ) / ħ ), but I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula with the integral. The general form is T = exp( - (2π/ħ) * ∫ sqrt(2m(V-E)) dx ), integrated over the barrier region. For a rectangular barrier of length L, the integral is sqrt(2m(V-E)) * L.

So, yes, the correct exponent is (2π/ħ) * sqrt(2m(V-E)) * L.

So, my earlier calculation should be correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers once more.

Compute each step:

V0-E = 0.5 eV = 0.5 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-20 J.

2m = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg = 1.8218e-30 kg.

2m(V0-E) = 1.8218e-30 kg * 8.01e-20 J = 1.8218e-30 * 8.01e-20 = 1.8218 * 8.01 = 14.59e-50, so 1.459e-49 kg·J.

sqrt(1.459e-49 kg·J) = sqrt(1.459e-49) ) * sqrt(kg·J). Hmm, but wait, J is kg·m²/s², so sqrt(kg·J) would be sqrt(kg^2·m²/s²) ) → kg·m/s. So the units are kg·m/s.

Value: sqrt(1.459e-49) = approx 3.82e-25.

Multiply by L = 1e-10 m: 3.82e-25 m/s * 1e-10 m = 3.82e-35 m²/s.

Now, multiply by 2π/ħ:

(2π) = 6.2832.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, 6.2832 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 5.96e34 s/J.

Multiply that by 3.82e-35 m²/s:

5.96e34 * 3.82e-35 = (5.96 * 3.82) * 1e-1 ≈ 22.76 * 0.1 ≈ 2.276.

So the exponent is 2.276, and T = exp(-2.276) ≈ 0.1027.

So T ≈ 0.103, which is about 0.1, so option I is 0.1.

But wait, I'm a bit surprised because a 0.5 eV barrier with 1.5 eV electrons is a 10% probability. That seems low, but perhaps it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I got the formula correctly. Another version of the transmission coefficient is T = exp( - (2π/ħ) * sqrt(2m(V-E)) * L ). So yes, that's what I used.

Alternatively, sometimes it's written with (V0 - E) as the barrier height, but that's what I used. So I think the calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option I: 0.1.

The problem involves calculating the transmission probability of an electron with energy \( E = 1.5 \, \mathrm{eV} \) through a semiconductor barrier of height \( V_0 = 2.0 \, \mathrm{eV} \) and thickness \( L = 100 \, \mathrm{pm} \). Since the electron's energy is less than the barrier height (\( E < V_0 \)), the transmission probability is determined by quantum tunneling, which can be approximated using the WKB method.

### Key Steps:
1. **Convert Energies to Joules**:  
   \( E = 1.5 \, \mathrm{eV} = 1.5 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} = 2.403 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \),  
   \( V_0 = 2.0 \, \mathrm{eV} = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \).  

2. **Barrier Height Difference**:  
   \( V_0 - E = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} - 2.403 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} = 0.801 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \).  

3. **WKB Transmission Coefficient**:  
   The transmission coefficient \( T \) is given by:  
   \[
   T = \exp\left(-\frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \sqrt{2m(V_0 - E)} \cdot L\right),
   \]  
   where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) is the electron mass, \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \), and \( L = 100 \, \mathrm{pm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \).  

4. **Compute \( \sqrt{2m(V_0 - E)} \)**:  
   \[
   2m(V_0 - E) = 2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \times 0.801 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} = 1.459 \times 10^{-49} \, \mathrm{kg^2 \cdot m^2/s^2}.
   \]  
   \[
   \sqrt{2m(V_0 - E)} = \sqrt{1.459 \times 10^{-49}} = 3.82 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot m/s}.
   \]  

5. **Multiply by Barrier Thickness**:  
   \[
   \sqrt{2m(V_0 - E)} \cdot L = 3.82 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot m/s} \times 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} = 3.82 \times 10^{-35} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot m^2/s}.
   \]  

6. **Compute Exponent**:  
   \[
   \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} = \frac{6.2832}{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 5.96 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{s/J}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \cdot \sqrt{2m(V_0 - E)} \cdot L = 5.96 \times 10^{34} \cdot 3.82 \times 10^{-35} \approx 2.276.
   \]  

7. **Transmission Probability**:  
   \[
   T = \exp(-2.276) \approx 0.103.
   \]  

### Final Answer:
The transmission probability is approximately \( 0.1 \), which corresponds to **option I**.
