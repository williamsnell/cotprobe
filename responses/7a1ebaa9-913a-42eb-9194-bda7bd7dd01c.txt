Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options was not a guest villain in the 1960s Batman TV series. I remember that the show was pretty campy and had a lot of colorful, quirky villains. Each of the Riddler's goons had a specific trade or profession, and their names usually included a play on that. 

Let's go through each option one by one. 

Option A: The Painter. I'm pretty sure the Painter was one of them. He was a guy who used paint-related tricks, like painting things gold or using paint thinner. So he was a guest villain.

Option B: The Plumber. The Plumber was definitely there. He used plumbing tools and gags, like dropping pipes and using drain cleaner. So he's a yes.

Option C: The Librarian. Hmm, I'm not as sure about this one. I remember the show had a lot of different characters, but I'm trying to recall if the Librarian was actually a guest villain. I think the Librarian might not have been one of them, but I'm not entirely certain yet.

Option D: The Minstrel. Wait, wasn't the Minstrel one of the Riddler's men? He probably used musical tricks, maybe a lute or something. So yes, he was a guest villain.

Option E: The Bookworm. Oh right, the Bookworm was definitely a character. He was super smart, used books as weapons, and had a high-pitched voice. So he was a guest villain.

Option F: The Chef. The Chef was there too. He used cooking utensils and food-related gags. So yes, he was a villain.

Option G: The Squeegee Guy. I think the Squeegee Guy was part of the show. He used a squeegee to commit crimes, like cleaning windows but in a sneaky way. So he was a guest villain.

Option H: The Gardener. I'm pretty sure the Gardener was one of them. He used gardening tools and plants to commit crimes. So yes, he was a guest villain.

Option I: The Archer. The Archer was definitely a character. He used a bow and arrows, sometimes with unusual tips. So he was a guest villain.

Option J: The Jester. The Jester was another one. He used juggling balls and tricks, which fit his character as a jester. So he was a guest villain.

Wait, but I thought the Librarian might not have been a guest villain. Let me think again. The Riddler's men included the Riddler himself, the Joker, the Penguin, and others like the Catwoman. But the guest villains were the ones with professions. The Librarian sounds like it could be a stretch because I don't recall a specific episode centered around a librarian as a villain. Maybe the Librarian wasn't one, making option C the correct answer.

The correct answer is C: The Librarian.
