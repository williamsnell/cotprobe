Question:

On his 21st birthday, a son enlisted in the army. As he was about to leave for eight weeks of basic training, his father said, "I will buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise me not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at basic training. " The son replied, "You can order the new car right away. I promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol, as you requested. "At the end of basic training, the son was given a leave and returned home. His father asked, "Did you abide by your promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol?" The son replied, "Yes, Father. " The father then told the son that he had already ordered the new car and that it would be available for delivery within one month. One week later, the son received the tragic news that his father had died suddenly. At the funeral, the executor of the father's estate told the son that he did not feel compelled to give the son the newly arrived car. In a suit against the executor of the father's estate to recover the new car, the son will

Okay, so I've got this question here about a legal issue involving a father and son. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

So the scenario is: A son turns 21 and enlists in the army. Before leaving for basic training, his father makes a promise to buy him a new car at the end of training if the son doesn't take illegal drugs or drink alcohol during basic training. The son agrees and even says the father can order the car right away. After training, the son comes home, confirms he kept his promise, and the father tells him the car is on its way. But then the father dies suddenly, and the executor of his estate refuses to give the son the car. The son is suing the executor, and the question is whether he will succeed.

First, I need to figure out what kind of legal issue this is. It seems like a contract or maybe a promise that's enforceable. The son agreed to refrain from drugs and alcohol, and in exchange, the father promised a car. So it looks like a contract where each party made a promise.

But wait, the father is making a promise in exchange for the son's promise. For a contract to be valid, there needs to be consideration. Consideration means that each party gives something of value. The son's promise to not use drugs or alcohol is considered valid consideration because it's a legal detriment—meaning he's agreeing not to do something he's legally allowed to do. So that part seems okay.

Now, the father's death—does that affect the contract? Well, when one party dies, their estate typically steps into their shoes, so to speak. The estate would carry out the obligations of the deceased unless it's a personal service contract, which this isn't. The father's promise was to buy the car, which is an obligation that can be fulfilled by the estate.

Wait, but the father ordered the car before he died, and it was on its way. So the father had already taken steps to fulfill his promise. The question is whether the executor can refuse to deliver it after the father's death.

Another angle: was the father's promise enforceable? Sometimes, gifts or promises can be gifts, which don't require consideration. But here, the father tied the gift to the son's promise. So it's more of a contract than a pure gift. Because the son had to promise something in exchange.

So, the son performed his part by not using drugs or alcohol. The father then had the obligation to deliver the car. The father even started the process by ordering it. The death shouldn't negate the enforceability of the contract because the son's performance was already completed.

Wait, but what about the executor's argument? The executor says they don't feel compelled to give the car. But legally, the estate is responsible for fulfilling the father's obligations unless there's a reason not to, like the contract being invalid.

Looking at the options:

A: Not succeed because father's death nullifies promise. That doesn't make sense because the death doesn't typically void a contract; the estate is responsible.

B: Not succeed because the father's promise was void. Why would it be void? There was consideration, so it's a valid contract.

C: Not succeed because executor has final say. No, the executor can't just refuse; the estate is bound by the father's contractual obligations.

D: Not succeed because son's promise wasn't a contract. But the son's promise was sufficient consideration, so this is incorrect.

E: Succeed because the son's promise provided consideration. That seems correct because consideration was present, so the son should get the car.

F: Not succeed because father's promise was a conditional gift. Wait, a conditional gift might not require consideration, but here it's a promise in exchange for a promise, making it a contract. So F might be incorrect.

Wait, but conditional gifts are different. If it's a gift, then perhaps the father's promise doesn't need consideration. But in this case, the son gave a promise, so it's more of a contract. So E would be the right answer because the consideration was there, making the contract enforceable.

The son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol and taking illegal drugs was sufficient consideration for the father's promise to buy the car, forming a valid contract. The father's death does not nullify the contract, as the estate is responsible for fulfilling his obligations. The executor cannot refuse to deliver the car without valid legal grounds. 

Answer: E
