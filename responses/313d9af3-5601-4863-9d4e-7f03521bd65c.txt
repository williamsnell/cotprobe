The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: Yes, because the employer has a financial interest in the outcome of the clerk's case.
F: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
G: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
H: Yes, because the employer's claim and the clerk's claim arose from the same incident.
I: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
J: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I have this question about whether an employer can intervene in a lawsuit. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the scenario. There's a mail clerk who lives in State A. He slipped and fell on ice near the loading dock of a building in State B where his employer (which is based in State B) leases space. The building is owned and operated by a corporation from State C. Because of the fall, the clerk was injured, and he was carrying an expensive employer computer that got damaged. Now, the clerk is suing the building owner for negligence in a federal court in State B, asking for $100,000 for his personal injuries. The employer wants to intervene and is claiming negligence against the building owner for the computer damage, seeking $80,000.

The question is whether the court will grant the employer's motion to intervene.

I remember that intervention in a lawsuit is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. There are two types of intervention: as of right and permissive. 

Intervention as of right requires that the movant (here, the employer) has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact, and that the movant is so situated that the disposition of the action in the court may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect the movant's interest. Additionally, the movant's interest must be inadequately represented by the existing parties.

Permissive intervention allows the court to permit a person to intervene if the court determines that the intervention is appropriate to protect the movant's interests and if the other parties are not so opposed. It's more flexible but still requires some showing.

Looking at the options, I need to see which applies here.

The employer's claim is for the damage to the computer, which is a separate claim from the clerk's personal injury. However, both claims arise from the same incident—the fall caused both the injury and the damage to the computer. So there's a common incident, but does that translate to common questions of law or fact?

In this case, the employer is not a party to the clerk's injury; their claim is about their own property damage. So, the employer's claim is separate but related. 

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: No, because the employer can't intervene in a personal injury case. I think that's incorrect because intervention doesn't require the case to be a certain type. It's about the claims and interests.

Option B: No, because the employer's claim isn't directly related. But the claims are related—they both stem from the same accident. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Yes, because the employer has a direct claim. But does that alone suffice? It's about having a direct claim, but also whether the intervention is proper under the rules.

Option D: No, because the employer's interest isn't impaired. Wait, isn't the employer's interest in the outcome (getting compensated for the computer) separate from the clerk's personal injury? If the clerk recovers, maybe that affects the employer's claim? Or maybe not directly. The employer's claim is for their own damages, so perhaps their interest is not impaired if the clerk's case is decided without them.

Option E: Yes, because the employer has a financial interest. But having a financial interest isn't enough for intervention. They need to show more than that; they need to show that their interest is potentially impaired if they aren't part of the case.

Option F: No, because the employer's claim is higher. But the amounts are just about the damages sought; the employer is seeking $80k, which is less than the clerk's $100k. I don't think the amount matters here; it's about the claims' relation.

Option G: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party. I don't think so. The employer is a third party with a separate claim, but they aren't necessary to the case between clerk and building owner.

Option H: Yes, because both claims arose from the same incident. That's correct in terms of relation, but does that mean intervention is granted? It's one factor but not the only one.

Option I: Yes, because there are common questions of law and fact. That's likely true because the negligence claim (duty, breach, causation, damages) is the same for both. So, yes, common issues.

Option J: No, because the clerk didn't join the employer. The clerk is suing on his own, but the employer is moving to intervene, not necessarily to be a co-plaintiff. The issue is whether the employer can join in the existing case, not whether the clerk should have included them.

So, focusing on Rule 24(a)(2), for intervention as of right, the employer must show (1) an interest in the action, (2) the interest is impaired if they don't intervene, and (3) the existing parties don't adequately represent their interest.

The employer has a clear interest in the computer damage. If the building owner is found negligent, the employer can recover. If the case proceeds without the employer, the outcome could affect their ability to recover. For example, if the clerk settles for $100k, maybe the employer's claim is for $80k, but if the building's liability is found, the employer wants to recover their loss. If the clerk's case doesn't include the employer, the employer's claim might be impacted because the building's liability is determined without their input.

But wait, the employer's claim is separate. The clerk is suing for personal injury, and the employer for property damage. The building owner's potential liability is the same in both cases, so the issues are related. Therefore, the employer's interest could be affected if the case proceeds without their involvement. For example, if the clerk's case leads to a judgment that limits the building owner's liability, that could affect the employer's claim.

Also, the existing parties—the clerk and the building owner—might not adequately represent the employer's interest. The clerk is seeking damages for his injury, while the employer is seeking for the computer. The clerk might settle for an amount that leaves less for the employer, or the building owner might fight the clerk's case in a way that's not optimal for the employer.

Therefore, the employer has a direct claim and the claims share common issues. So, the motion should be granted, likely under the reasoning that their claim shares common questions of law and fact.

Looking at the options, option I says yes because the claims share common questions. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option H says yes because the claims arose from the same incident. That's also correct, but the key factor is whether the legal and factual issues overlap.

So the correct answer should be either H or I. But the more precise reason under Rule 24 is the common questions of law and fact, which makes I the better choice.

The employer can intervene because its claim for property damage shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's personal injury claim, satisfying the requirements for intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2).
