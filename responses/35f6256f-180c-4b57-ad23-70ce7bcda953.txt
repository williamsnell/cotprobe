Alright, so I've got this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out which one matches the description given. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about a fallacy where someone suppresses evidence by eliminating a source because they claim it's flawed, but there's no real connection between that flaw and the source's reliability. So, the key points here are: suppressing evidence, eliminating a source, claiming a flaw, and no true relationship between the flaw and reliability.

First, I should think about what each of the options means to see which one fits.

Option A: Straw man. I remember that a straw man is when someone misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. It's about distorting, not really about evidence suppression or flaws in sources. So probably not A.

Option B: Snob appeal. That's when someone uses the idea that only certain people (like the elite or educated) understand an issue, to make others feel they need to follow their lead. Doesn't seem related to evidence suppression or flaws in sources. So B is out.

Option C: Bandwagon fallacy. This is about believing something just because many people do. It's about popularity, not about attacking evidence sources. So C isn't it.

Option D: Appeal to anonymous authority. This is when someone cites an unnamed authority to support a claim. It's about the authority, but the question is about a flaw in the source. Not exactly the same, but maybe related? Hmm.

Option E: False dilemma. This is when someone presents two options as the only possibilities when more exist. Not about evidence suppression, so E is out.

Option F: Significance. Wait, significance isn't a fallacy I'm familiar with in this context. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps I'm mixing it up. Not sure, but probably not F.

Option G: Appeal to ignorance. This is when someone argues that a claim is true because there's no evidence against it. It's about lack of evidence, not about attacking a source's reliability. So G is not it.

Option H: Argumentum ad populum. Similar to bandwagon fallacy, it's about appealing to the public's emotions or beliefs rather than logic. Again, not about evidence suppression.

Option I: Poisoning the well. Oh, wait, this sounds familiar. Poisoning the well is when you attack the source of an argument to discredit it, often by introducing irrelevant negative information about the source. That fits the description the question is giving. So when someone says, "Well, you can't trust Dr. Smith because he once said something wrong," even if that has nothing to do with the current argument. That's exactly what the question is describing.

Option J: Cherry picking. This is selecting evidence that supports a conclusion while ignoring contradictory evidence. It's more about selecting data rather than attacking the source's credibility based on a flaw.

So putting it all together, the fallacy in the question is about attacking a source's reliability with a false claim of a flaw. That's exactly what poisoning the well is. So the answer should be I.

The fallacy described involves attacking a source's reliability by falsely claiming it has a flaw, which is known as poisoning the well. This matches option I.

Answer: I
