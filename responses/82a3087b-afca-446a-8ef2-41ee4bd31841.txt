Okay, so I have this physics question here about Einstein's equation E=mc². I need to figure out what it means, right? Let's see the options and think through each one.

The question is asking what the equation indicates about energy. I remember that E stands for energy, m for mass, and c squared is the speed of light squared. So the equation shows a relationship between energy and mass.

Let's look at the options:

A: and mass are closely related. Hmm, that sounds plausible because the equation directly ties energy to mass. So energy and mass aren't separate; they're connected.

B: is equal to the square of the speed of light. Wait, that's not quite right. The equation is m times c squared, not just c squared. So B is incorrect.

C: equals moving mass. Not sure about this. Moving mass might imply velocity, but the equation doesn't mention velocity. It's just mass times the speed of light squared. So probably not C.

D: is fundamentally different than mass. No, because the equation shows they can be converted into each other. So D is wrong.

E: equals mass divided by the speed of light squared. That would be E= m/(c²), which is not the equation here. So E is wrong.

F: and mass are not related at all. Definitely not, because the equation shows they are directly related. So F is incorrect.

G: equals the sum of mass and the speed of light squared. No, that's not the case. It's a product, not a sum. So G is wrong.

H: is inversely proportional to mass. Inversely would mean E increases as m decreases, but the equation shows E increases with m. So H is incorrect.

I: equals mass moving at the speed of light squared. That doesn't make sense. The equation is E = m multiplied by c squared, not mass moving at c squared. So I is wrong.

J: equals mass multiplied by the speed of light. Oh wait, that's close but not the same. The equation has c squared, not just c. So J is incorrect.

So the only correct option is A. The equation shows that energy and mass are closely related because mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. So the answer should be A.

The equation E = mc² demonstrates a direct relationship between energy and mass, showing they are interchangeable.
