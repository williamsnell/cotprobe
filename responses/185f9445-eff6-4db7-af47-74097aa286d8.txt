Okay, so I have this question about colors when red and blue light are overlapped. Hmm, I remember from school that when different colors of light are mixed together, they can create other colors. Let me think about the color wheel. Red and blue are primary colors, right? So when you mix them, I think they make purple. But wait, sometimes people talk about mixing pigments versus light. Oh, right, this is about light, not paint. When you mix red and blue light, the result is magenta, which is a type of purple. Or is it magenta considered a separate color? I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down. Red light has longer wavelengths, and blue has shorter. When they overlap, the combined wavelengths might create a color that's perceived as magenta. I've heard that mixing red and blue in light gives magenta, whereas mixing red and blue paints gives a darker purple or maybe even black if the colors are too dark. So in this case, since it's about overlapping light, the answer should be magenta. Looking at the options, C is magenta. So I think the correct answer is C.
