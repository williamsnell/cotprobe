Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the data rate for a video. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says the video is 30 seconds long and is in color, which means it's RGB. The resolution is 352x288 pixels, and it's digitized at 30 frames per second. I need to find the data rate in megabits per second, with three significant figures.

Hmm, data rate is usually calculated by finding out how much data is generated per second and then converting that into the desired unit. So, I should break it down into parts: pixels per frame, bits per pixel, frames per second, and then the total time.

Let me jot down the numbers:

- Resolution: 352 pixels wide and 288 pixels tall. So, each frame has 352 * 288 pixels.
- Color depth: RGB. Since each color (R, G, B) is typically represented by 8 bits, that's 24 bits per pixel.
- Frames per second: 30.
- Time: 30 seconds.

Wait, but data rate is per second, so the time might not directly factor in unless it's for total data, but here since rate is per second, the 30 seconds might not affect the rate directly. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The formula for data rate (in bits per second) is:

Data Rate (bps) = (Number of Pixels per Frame) * (Bits per Pixel) * (Frames per Second)

So let's compute each part.

Number of pixels per frame: 352 * 288. Let me calculate that. 352 * 288... Let's see, 350 * 288 = 100,800, and 2 * 288 = 576, so total is 101,376 pixels per frame.

Bits per pixel: Since it's RGB, 3 bytes per pixel, which is 24 bits. Because each byte is 8 bits, right? So 3 * 8 = 24.

Frames per second: 30.

So putting it all together:

101,376 pixels/frame * 24 bits/pixel = total bits per frame. Let me compute that: 101,376 * 24.

Hmm, 100,000 *24 = 2,400,000, and 1,376 *24. Let's compute 1,376 *20=27,520 and 1,376 *4=5,504, so total 27,520 +5,504=33,024. So total bits per frame is 2,400,000 +33,024=2,433,024 bits per frame.

Now multiply by frames per second: 2,433,024 bits/frame *30 frames/sec = 72,990,720 bits per second.

But wait, the question asks for megabits per second, so I need to convert bits to megabits. There are 1,000,000 bits in a megabit (since mega is 10^6). So I'll divide by 1,000,000.

72,990,720 / 1,000,000 = 72.99072 Mbits/s.

But wait, the options don't have 73. Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 73.1. That's close. Wait, did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Let me double-check the pixel count. 352 *288: 352 * 200 is 70,400, 352*88 is 31,136. So 70,400 + 31,136 = 101,536 pixels per frame. Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought 352 *288 is 101,376, but actually, 352 * 288 is 352*(200+88) = 352*200=70,400 + 352*88.

Wait, 352 *88: 352*80=28,160 and 352*8=2,816. Adding those gives 30,976. So 70,400 +30,976=101,376. Wait, that's what I had before. So why am I confused now? Oh, perhaps I miscalculated when I thought 352*288. Wait no, 352 * 288 is indeed 101,376. Because 352 * 288 = (350 +2) * 288 = 350*288 + 2*288 = 100,800 + 576 = 101,376. So perhaps that part is correct.

Wait, then why am I getting 72.99 Mbits/s, which is approximately 73.0. But option I is 73.1, which is very close. Did I make a mistake in the bits per frame calculation?

Wait, let's recalculate:

101,376 pixels/frame *24 bits/pixel = ?

101,376 *24:

Let me compute it as (100,000 + 1,376) *24 = 100,000*24 + 1,376*24.

100,000*24=2,400,000.

1,376 *24: Let's compute 1,376 *20=27,520 and 1,376*4=5,504. So 27,520 +5,504=33,024.

Adding together: 2,400,000 +33,024=2,433,024 bits per frame.

Then, 2,433,024 bits/frame *30 frames/sec = 72,990,720 bits/sec.

Divide by 1e6 to get Mbits: 72.99072 Mbits/s.

Rounded to three significant figures, that's 73.0 Mbits/s. But the options don't have 73.0; the closest is I:73.1, which is 73.1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the color depth.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, color video uses fewer bits per pixel, like 16 bits (5-6-5 or similar), but the problem says RGB digitization, which I think implies 24 bits. So that should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering bytes instead of bits. Let me see: 352x288=101,376 pixels. Each pixel is 3 bytes (24 bits), so 101,376 *3 = 304,128 bytes per frame. Then, 304,128 bytes/frame *30 frames/sec=9,123,840 bytes/sec. Bytes to bits: multiply by 8, so 9,123,840 *8=72,990,720 bits/sec, same as before. So that's correct.

72,990,720 bits/sec is 72.99072 Mbits/s, which is approximately 73.0. But the options have I as 73.1. Did I miscalculate the exact value?

Wait, let me compute the exact value more precisely.

101,376 *24 = ?

Let me compute 101,376 *24:

101,376 *20 = 2,027,520

101,376 *4 = 405,504

Adding them: 2,027,520 +405,504 =2,433,024 bits per frame.

Yes, that's correct.

2,433,024 *30 = 72,990,720 bits/s.

Divide by 1e6 to get Mbits/s: 72.99072 ≈73.0.

But perhaps I should round to three significant figures. 72.99072 is approximately 73.0 when rounded to three sig figs. But looking at the options, the closest is I:73.1, which is 73.1. Hmm, but 72.99072 is closer to 73.0 than 73.1. So perhaps there's a mistake in the options, or maybe I made an error in calculation.

Wait, wait—maybe the problem uses a different frame rate? No, the problem says 30 frames per second.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the video is 30 seconds long, but in the calculation, I didn't use that. Wait, data rate is bits per second, so it's per second, so 30 seconds doesn't affect the rate. So that part is correct.

Wait another thought: Maybe the calculation is in terms of 8 bits per pixel, but considering RGB as 3 separate bytes. No, that's the same as 24 bits per pixel.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different color depth, perhaps 16 bits. Let me see what happens if I use 16 bits per pixel.

16 bits per pixel: 101,376 *16 = 1,622,016 bits per frame.

Multiply by 30: 48,660,480 bits/s → 48.66048 Mbits/s. That's about 48.7, which isn't an option. So probably not.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in megabytes, but no, the question is about megabits.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial multiplication. Let me double-check 352 *288.

352 *288: let's compute 352*200=70,400, 352*80=28,160, 352*8=2,816. So 70,400 +28,160=98,560 +2,816=101,376. Correct.

So, the calculation seems correct, leading to 72.99072 Mbits/s, which is approximately 73.0. But the options don't have that. The closest is I:73.1. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different way of counting pixels, or perhaps the frame rate is 30 Hz, which is the same as 30 frames per second. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each color channel is 8 bits, so 3 bytes, but sometimes, video compression might be involved, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think it's just raw data rate.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different resolution. Let me check the numbers again: 352x288. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each frame is 352x288x3 bytes, but no, that's same as 352x288 pixels *3 bytes per pixel.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bits per second calculation. Let me recompute the exact number.

352 *288 =101,376 pixels.

Each pixel is 24 bits, so 101,376 *24 = 2,433,024 bits per frame.

30 frames per second: 2,433,024 *30 =72,990,720 bits per second.

Now, 72,990,720 /1,000,000 =72.99072 Mbits/s.

Rounded to three significant figures: 73.0 Mbits/s. So, the answer should be approximately 73.0.

Looking at the options, I:73.1 is the closest. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely, maybe using exact figures without approximation.

Let me compute 352*288 exactly: 352 *288.

Let me compute 352 * 288:

= (300 +50 +2) *288

=300*288 +50*288 +2*288

=86,400 +14,400 +576

=86,400 +14,400 =100,800 +576=101,376. Correct.

So, 101,376 *24 = ?

Let me compute 101,376 *24:

= (100,000 +1,376) *24

=100,000*24 +1,376*24

=2,400,000 + (1,300*24 +76*24)

=2,400,000 + (31,200 +1,824) =2,400,000 +33,024=2,433,024.

Then, 2,433,024 *30=72,990,720.

So 72,990,720 bits/s → 72.99072 Mbits/s.

Rounded to three sig figs: 73.0 Mbits/s. But the options don't have that. The closest is I:73.1.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise intermediate steps. Let's see:

72,990,720 bits/s is 72,990,720 /1,000,000 =72.99072.

So, three significant figures: the first three digits are 72.9, and the next digit is 9, which is more than 5, so we round up the third digit from 9 to 10, which carries over. So 72.99072 → 73.0 when rounded to three sig figs.

But the options have I as 73.1. Hmm, maybe the problem expects the answer to be 73.1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different number of bits per pixel. Let me think: sometimes, video standards might use 16 bits per pixel (like YCrCb with 4:4:4 sampling), but the problem says RGB with digitization, which is typically 24 bits. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each frame is transmitted as a continuous stream, so perhaps some synchronization bits are added, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think it's just raw data.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses 352x288 as the resolution, but sometimes, video resolutions are given in terms of active pixels, not including borders, but the problem states 352x288, so I think it's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should check the options again. The options are:

A: 69.6
B: 64.3
C: 45.6
D: 91.2
E: 60.8
F: 78.4
G: 56.2
H: 82.5
I: 73.1
J: 85.3

So, I:73.1 is the closest to my calculated 73.0. But why is there a discrepancy of 0.1? Maybe I made a miscalculation in the exact value.

Let me compute 72,990,720 divided by 1,000,000:

72,990,720 ÷ 1,000,000 =72.99072.

So, 72.99072 Mbits/s.

Rounded to three sig figs: 73.0.

But 73.0 isn't an option. The options have I:73.1, which is 73.1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me compute 352*288 again.

352 *288:

352 * 200 =70,400

352 * 80 =28,160

352 *8=2,816

Adding: 70,400 +28,160 =98,560 +2,816=101,376. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, like considering the video as a whole. Wait, 30 seconds of video, so total data is:

Bits per frame * frames = 2,433,024 *30 =72,990,720 bits.

Total time is 30 seconds, so data rate is 72,990,720 /30 =2,433,024 bits per second. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, data rate is bits per second, so it's bits per frame multiplied by frames per second. So I think I did it correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different frame rate, but no, the problem states 30 frames per second.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses 3 bytes per pixel, but I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using exact numbers without any rounding until the end.

Let me try that.

352 *288 =101,376.

101,376 *24 =2,433,024.

2,433,024 *30 =72,990,720.

72,990,720 /1e6 =72.99072.

So, 72.99072 Mbits/s.

Rounded to three significant figures: 73.0.

But the options don't have 73.0. The closest is I:73.1.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer as 73.1, considering that 0.99072 is almost 1.0, so it rounds up to 73.1. But 72.99072 is 72.99072, which is 72.99 when rounded to two decimal places, but for three sig figs, it's 73.0.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial multiplication.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is 352 *288 *30 *24 /1e6.

Let me compute that step by step:

352 *288 =101,376.

101,376 *30 =3,041,280.

3,041,280 *24 =72,990,720.

72,990,720 /1e6 =72.99072.

Same result.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer as 73.0, but since it's not an option, I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem considers the video as 30 seconds, so total data is (352*288*24)*30 bits, and then data rate is total bits /30 seconds, which is the same as bits per second. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the data rate is in megabits per second, so perhaps I should have divided by 1e6, but maybe I missed a step.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different color depth, like 18 bits (6 bits per color), but that's not standard. So I think 24 bits is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximately 73.0, but the options don't have that. The closest is I:73.1.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I multiplied correctly.

Wait, 352 *288 =101,376.

101,376 *24 =2,433,024.

2,433,024 *30 =72,990,720.

72,990,720 /1e6 =72.99072.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is I:73.1, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the color depth.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, video uses 4:4:4 chroma subsampling, which uses 24 bits per pixel. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer as 73.0, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is I:73.1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as 352 *288 *30 *3 bytes, then convert to bits and divide by 1e6.

352 *288 =101,376.

101,376 *30 =3,041,280.

3,041,280 *3 =9,123,840 bytes.

9,123,840 bytes *8 bits =72,990,720 bits.

72,990,720 /1e6 =72.99072 Mbits/s.

Same result.

So, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 73.0 Mbits/s, but since the options don't include that, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is I:73.1.
</think>

To calculate the data rate for the video, we break it down into the following steps:

1. **Pixels per frame**:  
   The video resolution is \(352 \times 288\) pixels, so:  
   \[
   352 \times 288 = 101,376 \text{ pixels/frame}
   \]

2. **Bits per pixel**:  
   Since the video is in RGB format, each pixel is represented by 24 bits (3 bytes). Thus:  
   \[
   101,376 \text{ pixels/frame} \times 24 \text{ bits/pixel} = 2,433,024 \text{ bits/frame}
   \]

3. **Frames per second**:  
   The video has a frame rate of 30 frames per second. Therefore:  
   \[
   2,433,024 \text{ bits/frame} \times 30 \text{ frames/sec} = 72,990,720 \text{ bits/sec}
   \]

4. **Convert to megabits per second**:  
   To convert bits per second to megabits per second:  
   \[
   \frac{72,990,720 \text{ bits/sec}}{1,000,000} = 72.99072 \text{ Mbits/sec}
   \]

5. **Rounding to three significant figures**:  
   \[
   72.99072 \text{ Mbits/sec} \approx 73.0 \text{ Mbits/sec}
   \]

However, the closest option provided is **73.1 Mbits/sec**. This slight discrepancy may arise from rounding conventions or minor differences in intermediate steps. Based on the options given, the best answer is:

**I: 73.1**

Answer: I
