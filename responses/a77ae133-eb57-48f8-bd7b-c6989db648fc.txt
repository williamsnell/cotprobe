Okay, so I've got this question about insurance coverage, and I'm trying to figure out what the right answer is. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that Tom Patrick went through a red light and hit another car, injuring five people. Through a court action, he had to pay them specific amounts: $27,000, $14,000, $6,000, $5,000, and $2,700 respectively. Now, the question is about his insurance policy, which is a 50-and-100 policy. I need to figure out how much his insurance company paid.

Hmm, wait, what does a 50-and-100 insurance policy mean? I think it refers to the coverage limits. So, 50/100 usually means $50,000 for bodily injury per person and $100,000 per accident. But wait, sometimes it's presented as 50/100/25, where the first number is per person, the next is per accident, and the last is property damage. But the question doesn't mention property, so maybe it's just 50/100.

So, the policy would have a per-person limit of $50,000 and a total per accident limit of $100,000. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: in some states, the 50/100/25 means 50k per person for injury, 100k per accident, and 25k for property. But here, the question is about bodily injury, so property isn't an issue.

Wait, but the question says the insurance is 50-and-100. So perhaps it's 50,000 per person and 100,000 total per accident. So the per-person limit is $50k, and the total for all injured in the accident can't exceed $100k.

Now, the total amount Tom had to pay was $27k + $14k + $6k + $5k + $2.7k. Let me add these up. 

27k + 14k is 41k. 41k +6k is 47k. 47k +5k is 52k. 52k +2.7k is 54.7k. So the total sum is $54,700.

But wait, the insurance has a per-person limit of $50k. So each person's claim can't exceed $50k. Let me check each individual amount:

- $27k: that's under $50k, so the insurance would pay all of it.
- $14k: same, under 50k, so paid in full.
- $6k: under, so paid.
- $5k: under, paid.
- $2.7k: under, paid.

So each claim is within the per-person limit, so the insurance would pay each in full. So the total would be the sum of all payments, which is $54,700.

Wait, but the insurance has a per-accident limit of $100k. Since the total sum is $54,700, which is less than 100k, the insurance would pay all of it. So the total paid by the insurance company is $54,700.

Looking at the options, J is $54,700. So that must be the answer.

The insurance policy has a per-person limit of $50,000 and a total per-accident limit of $100,000. Each individual claim is under $50,000, so the insurance covers all amounts. The total sum of claims is $54,700, which is within the $100,000 limit. Therefore, the insurance company paid $54,700.

Answer: J
