When we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…"

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question based on a passage from Ibn Battuta's Voyages. The passage describes his experiences in China, specifically Hangzhou, around the 14th century. I need to determine which conclusion about the period 600–1450 C.E. is supported by the passage.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that the Chinese are considered infidels because they worship images and burn their dead, similar to Hindus. The King of China is described as a Tartar, a descendant of Genghis Khan. This suggests that the Yuan Dynasty, established by Kublai Khan, was in power at the time, which aligns with the 1332–1346 period mentioned.

The passage also talks about Muslims in China, noting that in all provinces, there are towns for Muslims with colleges, mosques, and they are favored by the kings. In Hangzhou, Ibn Battuta met the judge, elders of Islamism, great merchants, and was told there were twelve thousand guards. He stayed with Muslims for fifteen days and was treated honorably.

Looking at the options, I need to see which conclusion is supported. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Technological developments were hindered due to religious beliefs. The passage doesn't mention anything about technology or its development, so probably not A.

Option B: Technological developments spread across trade routes. Again, the passage doesn't discuss technology, so B is unlikely.

Option C: The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. The Yuan Dynasty was indeed a steppe empire (Mongol), and they did facilitate trade through the Silk Road. The presence of various groups like Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others in Hangzhou suggests a connected trade network. This seems plausible.

Option D: Religious tolerance was not practiced in major empires. The passage describes Muslims being treated honorably, having their own areas, and being respected. The king supports them, so it seems like there was religious tolerance. Therefore, D is not supported; in fact, the opposite is suggested.

Option E: New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. The passage mentions that the Chinese burned their dead like Hindus and that the King is a descendant of Genghis Khan, but it doesn't say that new religions overturned old ones. It just describes the presence of different groups, so E might not be the best fit.

Option F: The Chinese empire was isolated and had little contact with other civilizations. The presence of diverse groups like Muslims, Jews, and others indicates extensive contact and trade, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Trade was primarily conducted within individual civilizations and not between them. The passage shows trade with various groups and mentions different districts, suggesting that trade was indeed happening across different groups, so G is not correct.

Option H: The spread of Islam was primarily through military conquest. The passage doesn't talk about military conquests but rather about the presence and treatment of Muslims, so H isn't supported.

Option I: The Chinese empire was primarily Jewish and Christian during this period. The passage describes Muslims, Jews, and others, but it doesn't say they were the majority, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated. Again, the presence of diverse groups suggests active contact, so J is not correct.

So, the most supported conclusion is Option C: The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. The Yuan Dynasty, a steppe empire, facilitated trade, and the description of Hangzhou's diverse population supports this.

The passage describes the presence of various religious and ethnic groups in China under the Yuan Dynasty, indicating a period of trade and cultural exchange facilitated by the Mongol Empire. This supports the idea that steppe nomad empires united trade links across Eurasia.

Answer: C
