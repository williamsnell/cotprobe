Question:

In one year Juan earned $30,000. and Don earned $20,000 as free-lance commercial artists. Juan paid $10,000. in taxes. Don paid $6,000. They know that lb + a = T is the linear equation used in computing their tax payments, where I stands for 'income' and T, the amount of tax to be paid. What are the values of the constants a and b?

Options:

A: b = .5, a = -2
B: b = .4, a = 2
C: b = .6, a = - 2
D: b = .1, a = 1
E: b = .4, a = - 2
F: b = .4, a = -3
G: b = .3, a = 0
H: b = .5, a = -1
I: b = .2, a = - 1
J: b = .2, a = -3

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Juan and Don's taxes. Let me read the question again. 

The question says that the tax calculation uses the formula lb + a = T. Wait, I think maybe it's supposed to be (l * b) + a = T? Because in some linear equations, the form is y = mx + b. So maybe they used the same concept here. 

Wait, the problem mentions that 'I' stands for 'income' and 'T' is the tax amount. So the equation is T = l * b + a, where l is the income. So it's a linear equation in the form T = b*l + a, which is the same as T = m*l + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

So, in this case, l is Juan's income or Don's income. Let me get the data straight. 

Juan earned $30,000 and paid $10,000 in taxes. Don earned $20,000 and paid $6,000. So, we can set up two equations based on the formula.

For Juan: T = b * l + a
10,000 = b * 30,000 + a --> equation 1

For Don: T = b * l + a
6,000 = b * 20,000 + a --> equation 2

Now, I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a and solve for b.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:
10,000 - 6,000 = (30,000b + a) - (20,000b + a)
4,000 = 10,000b

So, 10,000b = 4,000 → b = 4,000 / 10,000 = 0.4. So, b is 0.4.

Now, substitute b back into one of the equations to find a. Let's use Don's numbers:

6,000 = 0.4 * 20,000 + a
6,000 = 8,000 + a
a = 6,000 - 8,000 → a = -2.

So, a is -2. 

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one has a = -2 and b = 0.4. 

Looking through the options:

Option B: b = 0.4, a = 2 → No, a is 2, not -2.

Option F: b = 0.4, a = -3 → No, a is -3.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake? Because in my calculation, a came out to be -2. Let me check again.

Wait, for Don, 0.4 * 20,000 is 8,000. So 8,000 + a = 6,000 → a is -2. That's correct.

So, looking for a = -2 and b = 0.4.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: b = 0.4, a = -3 → No.

Option B: a is 2, no.

Option G: b = 0.3, a=0 → No.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the problem statement. It says the equation is (l * b) + a = T. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the problem says "the linear equation used in computing their tax payments, where I stands for 'income' and T, the amount of tax to be paid. What are the values of the constants a and b?"

Wait, perhaps the equation is written as T = l * b + a, which is same as T = b*l + a. So, yes, the same approach.

Wait, what if the equation was (l + a) multiplied by b? Oh no, the equation is T = (l * b) + a. So the way I solved it is correct.

So, the correct values are a = -2 and b = 0.4. Looking at the options, that's option F? Wait, option F is b=0.4 and a=-3, which is not correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in arithmetic.

Wait, let's recheck the Don's substitution.

Don's case: T = 6,000 = 0.4 * 20,000 + a → 0.4 *20,000 =8,000. 8,000 + a =6,000 → a=6,000-8,000 = -2. Yes.

So a = -2, b=0.4.

Looking at the options again:

A: b=0.5, a=-2 → No, a is correct.

B: b=0.4, a=2 → No.

C: b=0.6, a=-2 → No.

D: b=0.1, a=1→ No.

E: b=0.4, a=-2 → No, a is -2, which matches. So option E is b=0.4, a=-2. 

Option E is: b=0.4, a=-2. That's correct. So the answer should be option E.

The problem involves determining the constants \( b \) and \( a \) in the linear tax equation \( T = b \cdot l + a \), where \( l \) is income and \( T \) is tax. Using the given data:

- **Juan's case:** \( T = 10,000 \), \( l = 30,000 \)
- **Don's case:** \( T = 6,000 \), \( l = 20,000 \)

Setting up the equations:

1. \( 10,000 = 30,000b + a \)
2. \( 6,000 = 20,000b + a \)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

\[
10,000 - 6,000 = (30,000b + a) - (20,000b + a) \\
4,000 = 10,000b \\
b = 0.4
\]

Substituting \( b = 0.4 \) into Don's equation:

\[
6,000 = 0.4 \cdot 20,000 + a \\
6,000 = 8,000 + a \\
a = -2
\]

Thus, \( b = 0.4 \) and \( a = -2 \). Among the options, **E: \( b = 0.4, a = -2 \)** matches these values.
