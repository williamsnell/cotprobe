Okay, so I've got this question about Mill's response to the complaint that utilitarianism is a doctrine fit for swine. I remember that Mill was a big proponent of utilitarianism, which is all about maximizing overall happiness or utility. The phrase "doctrine worthy of swine" probably refers to the idea that utilitarianism reduces everything to simple pleasure, which might be seen as base or animalistic.

The question is asking what Mill says about the nature of pleasures in response to that criticism. From what I recall, Mill argued that pleasures are not all the same. He distinguished between higher and lower pleasures. Higher pleasures, like those from art, literature, and philosophy, are more valuable than the lower ones, like physical pleasures.

Looking at the options, the question is about how pleasures differ. The options are A through J, including things like cost, weight, species, etc. I think the key here is the distinction Mill made between different types or qualities of pleasures. He said that some pleasures are more desirable because they are of a different quality, not just because they feel stronger or last longer.

So, the term "species" comes to mind, which refers to the type or kind of pleasure. In Mill's words, I think he talks about the "quality" or "species" difference. The idea is that a rational being would prefer a higher quality pleasure over a greater quantity of lower ones. For example, the pleasure of learning something new is of a different quality and more valuable than mere physical gratification.

Looking at the options, C is species, and G is quality. Wait, are these the same thing? Let me think. Species refers to the type or kind, while quality is more about the characteristics of the pleasure. In Mill's context, he's talking about the distinction based on the type or nature of the pleasure, so "species" might be the right term he used. Alternatively, he might have referred to the quality as in the nature or intrinsic value.

Wait, in the actual text, Mill says, "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied." He's contrasting the higher (human) pleasures with lower (pig) ones, which is about the quality or species of pleasure. I think he used the term "species" in his argument. So the answer should be C: species.

Wait, but sometimes people refer to this as the qualitative distinction. So maybe G: quality is also correct. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the exact wording. In Mill's "Utilitarianism," he writes, "The happiness of the lower animals is not the same thing as the happiness of men." He argues that the pleasures of the mind are of a different quality. So maybe "quality" is the term used, making G the correct answer.

Wait, but in the original quote, he refers to the "kinds" or "species" of pleasures. I think the term "species" is more precise here because he's distinguishing between different types based on their sourceâ€”animal versus human. So the answer is C: species.

When faced with the complaint that utilitarianism is a doctrine worthy of swine, Mill responds by emphasizing that pleasures differ in their quality. He argues that higher pleasures, such as those derived from intellectual or moral activities, are of a different and more valuable quality compared to lower pleasures, such as physical gratification. This distinction is based on the idea that rational beings value the quality of pleasure over mere quantity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: species.

The answer is C.

Answer: C
