Question:

Define tariffs, and differentiate revenue tariffs from protective tariffs.

Options:

A: Protective tariffs are imposed on exported goods to protect domestic consumption.
B: Revenue tariffs are imposed to regulate the quantity of goods imported rather than to raise revenue.
C: Revenue tariffs are higher than protective tariffs and are used to increase the price of imported goods to match domestic prices.
D: Tariffs are taxes on exported goods
E: Protective tariffs are set at a fixed percentage of the value regardless of the product type.
F: Protective tariffs are imposed to raise the government's revenue
G: Tariffs are excise taxes on imported goods. Revenue tariffs are imposed primarily for the purpose of raising revenue and are usually applied to products not produced in the imposing country. Protective tariffs are imposed to protect domestic producers from foreign competition.
H: Revenue tariffs are specific to luxury items, while protective tariffs are applied across all essential commodities.
I: Tariffs are uniform charges applied to all goods crossing a border, without distinction between revenue and protective purposes.
J: Revenue tariffs are imposed to protect domestic producers

Okay, so I've got this question about tariffs, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what tariffs are. I remember that tariffs are taxes imposed on goods, but I'm not exactly sure whether they're on imports or exports. I think they're usually on imports, but I'm not certain. Let me check the options to see if that's the case.

Looking at the options, option D says tariffs are taxes on exported goods. Hmm, but I vaguely recall that tariffs are more commonly on imports. So maybe D is incorrect. Let's move on.

The question also asks to differentiate between revenue tariffs and protective tariffs. I think revenue tariffs are meant to raise money for the government, while protective tariffs are meant to protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, thus encouraging people to buy local products. So revenue tariffs are about money, and protective are about protection.

Looking at the options, option G says: "Tariffs are excise taxes on imported goods. Revenue tariffs are imposed primarily for the purpose of raising revenue and are usually applied to products not produced in the imposing country. Protective tariffs are imposed to protect domestic producers from foreign competition." That seems to fit what I was thinking. Tariffs are on imports (excise taxes), revenue tariffs for money, protective for domestic industries.

Let me check other options to make sure. Option F says protective tariffs are imposed to raise revenue, which contradicts because protective should be about protection, not revenue. So F is wrong. Option J says revenue tariffs are for protection, which is also wrong because that's the role of protective tariffs.

Option A says protective tariffs are on exported goods to protect domestic consumption. That doesn't make sense because if you tax exports, you'd be discouraging domestic producers from selling abroad, which might not protect domestic consumption. Plus, I thought tariffs are usually on imports to protect domestic producers. So A seems incorrect.

Option C says revenue tariffs are higher than protective and used to make imported goods match domestic prices. That might be true for protective tariffs, where higher tariffs make imports more expensive. But revenue tariffs are about raising money, so maybe they could be high, but I'm not sure if C is correct. Also, the description in G seems more accurate.

Option E says protective tariffs are set at a fixed percentage regardless of product type. Not sure, but I think protective tariffs might vary depending on the industry's need, so E might not be correct.

Option H says revenue tariffs are specific to luxury items, while protective are on essentials. That doesn't sound right because revenue tariffs should be on a broader range to maximize income, not just luxury goods.

Option I says tariffs are uniform charges without distinction. No, because revenue and protective tariffs have different purposes, so I is likely incorrect.

So, putting it all together, option G seems to correctly define tariffs as excise taxes on imports and properly differentiates between revenue and protective tariffs. Therefore, the answer should be G.
