Okay, so I've got this question about the circular flow models in economics and what they don't capture. Hmm, I remember that circular flow models are used to show how money and goods flow between different sectors like households, firms, government, and maybe even the rest of the world. But wait, the question is asking about what important aspects are NOT captured by these models.

Let me think. Circular flow models, as I recall, typically show the flow of resources and products between the main sectors. They might include things like consumption, investment, government spending, and taxes. But I'm trying to remember what's missing. Oh right, they often don't delve into the details of how prices are determined. Like, they show that money flows from firms to households as wages, but not how prices for goods and services are set. That's one thing.

Also, I think these models might not explain the composition of the flows in detail. They might show that there's a flow from firms to households, but not break down what's in that flowâ€”like whether it's wages, profits, or something else. Plus, they might ignore the public sector entirely or just show government as a single entity without much detail.

Another point is that circular flow models probably don't illustrate fluctuations in employment, output, and income. They might show a steady flow, but not the ups and downs of the economy. And what about the role of money in the economy? Do they capture how money is used and its effects? I don't think so; they might treat money as just a medium of exchange without exploring its broader impacts.

Looking at the options, option C says that the models omit the description of principal elements, don't explain the composition of flows, ignore price determination, can't show fluctuations in employment, output, and income, omit the public sector, and don't highlight the effects of using money. That seems to cover all the points I was thinking about.

Option A says the models include all aspects, which can't be right because we've just thought of several things they miss. Option B talks about detailed explanations, but the models are more simplified, so they don't provide detailed explanations. Option D says they include governmental operations, but I think the basic models might not detail the public sector beyond maybe taxes and government spending, so they might omit it or treat it superficially.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C.

The circular flow models in economics are simplified representations that focus on the flow of resources and products between sectors like households, firms, and the government. While they show basic interactions such as consumption, investment, and government spending, they omit several key aspects. These include the detailed composition of flows, the determination of prices, fluctuations in economic variables like employment and output, and the broader effects of money in the economy. Additionally, they often overlook the complexities of the public sector and fail to illustrate the dynamic interactions that lead to economic fluctuations. 

Answer: C
