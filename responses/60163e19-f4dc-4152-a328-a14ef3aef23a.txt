Okay, so I need to find the product of 0.07 multiplied by 5.8. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I'll try to work this out step by step.

First, maybe I can ignore the decimals and just multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. So 0.07 is the same as 7 hundredths, and 5.8 is the same as 58 tenths. If I multiply 7 by 58, what's that? Let me do that: 7 times 58. Well, 7 times 50 is 350, and 7 times 8 is 56, so adding those together gives 406. So 7 times 58 is 406.

But wait, I have to remember the decimal places. The original numbers had decimals. 0.07 has two decimal places, and 5.8 has one decimal place. So in total, that's three decimal places. So I need to move the decimal point three places to the left in the product 406. Let me count: starting from 406, moving the decimal three places left. So first, after 406 becomes 40.6, then 4.06, then 0.406. Oh, so that would make it 0.406.

Let me check if that makes sense. Another way to think about it is that 0.07 is a small number, and 5.8 is a bit more than 5. So multiplying a small number by a number just over 5 should give something a little over 0.35, because 0.07 times 5 is 0.35. And 0.07 times 0.8 is 0.056, so adding that to 0.35 gives 0.406. Yep, that matches what I got earlier.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.406, which is what I calculated. The other options don't seem to fit. B is 0.0406, which is way too small. C is 4.06, which is way too big. D is 40.6, which is even bigger. So the correct answer must be A.

The product of 0.07 and 5.8 is calculated by ignoring the decimals, multiplying 7 by 58 to get 406, then adjusting for the three decimal places, resulting in 0.406. This matches option A.

Answer: A
