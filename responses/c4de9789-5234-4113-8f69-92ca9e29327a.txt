Okay, so I've got this problem about an electric motor and I need to figure out the current it requires and the electrical energy used. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given.

The motor is rated at 1 horsepower. I remember that horsepower is a unit of power, but I'm more comfortable working in watts. So I think I need to convert horsepower to watts. Wait, how much is 1 horsepower in watts? I recall that 1 horsepower is approximately 746 watts. Yeah, that sounds right because I've heard that figure before.

The motor operates from a 100-volt line. So the voltage is 100 volts. It runs for 1 hour, and I need to find the current and the energy used. 

First, let's tackle the current. I know that power (P) is equal to voltage (V) multiplied by current (I), so P = V * I. I need to find I, so rearranging the formula gives I = P / V.

Since the motor is rated at 1 hp, which is 746 watts, I can plug that into the equation. So I = 746 W / 100 V. Let me calculate that: 746 divided by 100 is 7.46. So the current should be 7.46 amperes. 

Wait, but I should double-check if there are any efficiency considerations. Oh, right, motors aren't 100% efficient, but the problem doesn't mention efficiency. It just says it's rated at 1 hp. I think that means the motor's output is 1 hp, but the input power might be higher due to inefficiency. Hmm, but the question is probably assuming that the motor's power rating is the input power, not the output. Wait, no, usually when a motor is rated at a certain horsepower, that's the output power. But in electrical terms, the input power would be higher because of efficiency losses. 

Oh, this complicates things. Because if the motor is 1 hp (746 W) output, but the input power is higher, then I can't directly use 746 W for the calculation. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says the motor is "rated at 1 hp." I think in most cases, especially in problems like this, the power given is the input power, not the output. Or perhaps it's considering that the motor's electrical power is 1 hp. Wait, no, horsepower is a unit of mechanical power, so I think the motor's mechanical output is 1 hp, but the electrical input would be higher because of efficiency. But since the problem doesn't provide the efficiency, maybe it's assuming that the electrical power is 1 hp, or that it's 746 W.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things and treating the motor's power as 1 hp, which is 746 W, and then using that to calculate the current. So I think for this problem, they might be ignoring efficiency and just using P = 746 W.

So using P = 746 W, V = 100 V, I = 746 / 100 = 7.46 A. So that's the current part.

Now for the energy used. Energy is power multiplied by time. The motor runs for 1 hour. Power is in watts, so energy in watt-hours. So 746 W * 1 hour = 746 Wh. To convert that to kilowatt-hours, divide by 1000: 746 / 1000 = 0.746 kW-hr.

Looking at the options, option E is 7.46 A and 0.746 kW-hr. That matches what I calculated. So the answer should be E.

The motor is rated at 1 horsepower, which is equivalent to 746 watts. Using the formula \( I = \frac{P}{V} \), where \( P = 746 \, \text{W} \) and \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \), the current is calculated as \( I = \frac{746}{100} = 7.46 \, \text{A} \). For energy, the motor operates for 1 hour, so the energy used is \( 746 \, \text{W} \times 1 \, \text{hr} = 0.746 \, \text{kW-hr} \).
