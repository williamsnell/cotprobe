Okay, I'm trying to figure out which statement about embryonic cleavage is not true. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. Hmm, I remember that the amount of yolk affects the type of cleavage. Eggs with a lot of yolk, like telolecithal eggs, undergo meroblastic cleavage where only part of the egg divides. So if there's a lot of yolk, does that inhibit cleavage? Wait, no—meroblastic cleavage is a type of cleavage that happens because of the yolk distribution, but it doesn't mean it inhibits it. Maybe A is false because the presence of yolk doesn't inhibit cleavage; instead, it changes how it happens.

Option B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. I think this is correct. Telolecithal eggs have a large concentration of yolk at the vegetal pole, so the cleavage is partial, hence meroblastic. So B is true.

Option C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. Wait, in telolecithal eggs, the yolk is at the vegetal pole, so cleavage tends to start at the animal pole. So the animal pole cleaves more readily, not the vegetal. Therefore, C is false because it's the opposite. Or maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me think again. In telolecithal, the cleavage starts at the animal pole because the yolk is at the bottom. So C says the vegetal pole does more cleavage, which would be incorrect. So C is a false statement, making it the incorrect option. But let me check the other options.

Option D: The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. Yes, cleavage is a series of rapid cell divisions that produce blastomeres, the early cells of the embryo. So D is true.

So, the question is which statement is NOT true. Option A says yolk presence inhibits cleavage. From what I know, yolk presence (like in telolecithal) leads to meroblastic cleavage, not inhibition. So A is not true because yolk doesn't inhibit; it causes a different type of cleavage. But wait, maybe in some cases, like when there's a lot of yolk, does it actually slow down cleavage? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, if the egg has a lot of yolk (telolecithal), the cleavage is more at the animal pole, and the yolk-rich area doesn't divide as much. So the presence of yolk doesn't inhibit cleavage entirely, but changes where it happens. So A is saying that yolk presence inhibits cleavage, which might be incorrect because cleavage still occurs, just in a different pattern.

Wait, another angle: in holoblastic cleavage (like in humans, which are mesolecithal with moderate yolk), cleavage occurs throughout. If yolk were to inhibit, then maybe in species with more yolk, cleavage is less. But in reality, meroblastic is a type of cleavage, so the presence of yolk doesn't inhibit it; it just changes the cleavage type. So A is incorrect because it's not that yolk inhibits, but alters the cleavage.

So the false statement is A and C. Wait, because I thought C was wrong too. Let me reevaluate.

Option C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. In telolecithal eggs, the cleavage starts at the animal pole because the yolk is concentrated at the vegetal pole. So the animal pole cleaves more readily, making C false because it's the opposite.

So which one is the incorrect statement? The question asks which is NOT true.

Looking back: the options. The question is about which is NOT true.

So, the options are:

A: Presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. (Probably false because yolk leads to meroblastic, not inhibition.)

B: Telolecithal undergo meroblastic. (True.)

C: Vegetal pole cleaves more readily. (False; animal pole does.)

D: Cleavage divisions give blastomeres. (True.)

So the question is which is NOT true. So both A and C are incorrect. But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The presence of yolk (like in telolecithal) affects where cleavage happens but doesn't inhibit it. So A is incorrect because it's not that yolk inhibits, but that it changes the cleavage pattern.

Alternatively, maybe in some cases, yolk can inhibit cleavage. For example, in very yolk-rich eggs, perhaps cleavage is less, but I'm not sure. I think the main point is that yolk presence does not inhibit cleavage but causes it to be meroblastic.

So among the options, the incorrect statement (not true) is A.

Wait, but what about option C? If the statement is that the vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily, that's wrong because in telolecithal, it's the animal pole that does. So C is also a false statement. But the question is which one is NOT true, meaning it's the incorrect fact.

Hmm, perhaps the question is designed so that more than one option is incorrect, but I have to choose the one that's not true.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the options again.

Option A: Presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. Is this true? I think this is incorrect because yolk doesn't inhibit, it just changes cleavage into meroblastic. So A is false.

Option C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily. This is also false because in telolecithal, the animal pole cleaves more.

So both A and C are incorrect statements. But the question asks for which is NOT true, implying one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should check what the options are.

The options are A through J, but the given options are only four (A to D). So the question is which of these four is NOT true.

In that case, which is incorrect.

I think the correct answer is A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. Because yolk presence doesn't inhibit cleavage; it leads to a different kind of cleavage. So A is false.

Alternatively, perhaps another perspective: in eggs with a lot of yolk (telolecithal), the cleavage is not as extensive because the yolk is concentrated, but cleavage still occurs, just not as much as in holoblastic. So does yolk presence inhibit cleavage? Maybe in a way, but the main point is that cleavage still occurs, just in a different manner.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the question is about which statement is NOT true.

So, looking for the incorrect fact.

Option C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. This is incorrect because in telolecithal, the cleavage starts at the animal pole, where the yolk is less. So C is false.

So the question is, which is not true. So both A and C are incorrect, but only one is an option.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.

B: Telolecithal undergo meroblastic cleavage.

C: Vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than animal.

D: Cleavage divisions give blastomeres.

So the incorrect statements are A and C.

But the question asks which is NOT true, so perhaps one of these is not true.

Alternatively, perhaps A is correct. Wait, maybe the presence of yolk, especially in telolecithal, does inhibit cleavage because the yolk is so concentrated that the cytoplasm is not as supportive for division, making the cleavage less extensive. So A could be true.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the correct facts.

Meroblastic cleavage occurs in telolecithal eggs, where most of the yolk is at the vegetal pole. The cleavage starts at the animal pole because there's less yolk there, making it easier for the cells to divide. So the animal pole cleaves more readily, making statement C incorrect.

So the false statement is C.

Wait, the question is which statement is NOT true.

So if C says the vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily, which is false. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought A was incorrect. So I need to decide which one is the false statement.

Alternatively, perhaps A is true. If an egg has a lot of yolk, such as in telolecithal, the cleavage is inhibited because the yolk is so concentrated that the embryo can't develop properly unless it goes through segmentation. Wait, no, meroblastic cleavage does occur, so cleavage isn't inhibited, just modified.

So A is incorrect because presence of yolk doesn't inhibit cleavage but changes its type.

So the NOT true statements are A and C.

But the options only have one correct answer. Maybe the question is phrased such that the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about inhibition in general. For example, in some eggs, a lot of yolk may require more nutrients to be allocated, so cleavage is slower or less, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize.

The options are:

A: Presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.

B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage.

C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole.

D: Rapid mitotic divisions give blastomeres.

So:

B is correct.

D is correct.

Now, A and C.

Meroblastic cleavage occurs in telolecithal eggs, so A says yolk inhibits cleavage. Since cleavage still occurs, just meroblastically, A is incorrect. So A is not true.

C says the vegetal pole cleaves more readily, which is incorrect because the animal pole does.

So both A and C are incorrect, but among the options, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, but the question is which statement is NOT true. So the answer could be both A and C, but since it's a multiple-choice with one correct answer, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

I think I need to make a decision.

Given that, I'll go with option C as the incorrect statement because in telolecithal eggs, the animal pole cleaves more readily, not the vegetal. So C is false.

The question asks which statement about embryonic cleavage is NOT true. Let’s analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage." This is incorrect because the presence of yolk does not inhibit cleavage; instead, it changes the type of cleavage. In telolecithal eggs, the yolk distribution leads to meroblastic cleavage, where only part of the egg divides. Thus, yolk does not inhibit cleavage but modifies its pattern.

- **Option B**: "Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage." This is correct. Telolecithal eggs, with their large concentration of yolk at the vegetal pole, undergo meroblastic cleavage, where division occurs primarily at the animal pole.

- **Option C**: "The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole." This is incorrect. In telolecithal eggs, cleavage starts at the animal pole, where there is less yolk, making it easier for divisions to occur. The vegetal pole does not cleave more readily.

- **Option D**: "The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres." This is correct. Cleavage is characterized by rapid cell divisions that produce blastomeres, the early cells of the embryo.

Both **A** and **C** are false statements. However, since the question asks for the statement that is NOT true, and only one answer is expected, **C** is the best choice because it directly contradicts the known behavior of cleavage in telolecithal eggs.

Answer: C
