Question:

A graduate student designed and conducted a research project for her dissertation and subsequently wrote a journal article describing the study and its results. The original idea for the study was derived from the work of the student’s faculty advisor who also provided the facilities for the student's research. The faculty advisor wants to be listed as first author on the article when it is published. In this situation:

Options:

A: authorship should be determined by the dean of the school.
B: the student and advisor should decide authorship through a coin flip.
C: the student should file a complaint against the advisor with the Ethics Committee.
D: the student should abandon the project to avoid conflict.
E: it is up to the student to determine authorship credit.
F: the advisor should be listed as the only author.
G: the student should be listed as the first author.
H: it is up to the advisor to determine authorship credit.
I: both the student and advisor should be listed as co-first authors.
J: the advisor should be listed as the first author.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about authorship in a research project. Let me read through the scenario again.

A graduate student did a research project for her dissertation. She wrote a journal article about it. The original idea for the study came from her faculty advisor, who also provided the facilities for her research. Now, the advisor wants to be the first author on the article. Hmm, what's the right thing to do here?

I remember that in academic publishing, authorship can be tricky. Usually, the order of authors matters, with first author being the one who contributed the most, or at least is the primary contributor. But sometimes, it's based on other factors like who came up with the idea, who did the work, who wrote the paper, etc.

In this case, the advisor came up with the original idea. That's a big deal because the idea is often a key part of a research paper. But the student did the actual work—she conducted the research, designed the experiments, and wrote the article. So, who should get the first authorship?

I think there's a guideline about authorship. Typically, the first author is the one who did the most work, especially in the analysis and writing. The person who provides the idea might be a senior author or listed later, depending on the contribution. But if the advisor is the one who originated the idea and provided the facilities, maybe they should be first? Or maybe the student, since she did the work.

Wait, but sometimes in academia, the advisor's role is to mentor and provide guidance, but the student is the one executing the project. So for a dissertation, the student is the primary contributor. Therefore, she should be the first author, right?

But the question says the advisor wants to be first author. Is that appropriate? Or is the student's contribution more significant for the article? I'm a bit confused.

I think the main factors are who contributed more to the actual work and writing. If the student designed and conducted the study and wrote the article, she probably deserves first authorship. The advisor might be more of a contributor in the background, perhaps as a senior author.

Looking at the options, G says the student should be first author. J says the advisor should be first. Which is right?

I've heard that the person who does the work is typically first author. So even if the advisor had the idea, the student's work might make her first. Alternatively, sometimes the order is determined by contribution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the faculty advisor might have a more significant role in the research, like securing funding, providing resources, and guiding the project. But in this case, the student did the actual work. So maybe the student should be first author, and the advisor could be a co-author or listed after.

In the options, G says the student should be first author, which seems right. But J says the advisor should be first. So which is it?

I think the correct answer is that the student should be first author because she conducted the research and wrote the article. The advisor might be a contributor but not necessarily first. So the answer would be G.

The correct answer is that the student should be listed as the first author because she conducted the research and wrote the article, despite the advisor providing the idea and facilities. 

Answer: G
