Okay, so I have this question about the first ship to sail around the world. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my history, but I'll try to think it through. Let me go through the options one by one.

The options are A to J, and the question is asking for the name of the first ship to circumnavigate the globe. I remember that Ferdinand Magellan led an expedition that was the first to sail around the world, right? But wait, was it his ship or the name of the fleet?

Looking at the options, I see option E is Magellan. But I think that's the name of the explorer, not the ship. So maybe the ship itself was named something else. I recall that the Santa Maria was one of the ships in Columbus's voyage, but that was to the Americas, not around the world. So F is probably not it.

Option A is HMS Beagle. That rings a bell as the ship that Charles Darwin was on during his voyage, which was much later, in the 19th century. So not the first.

Option B is Columbus. That's the name of the explorer, not a ship. The ships he used were named differently, like Santa Maria, which I already thought about.

Option C is Titanic. That's a famous ship, but it sank on its maiden voyage and never made it around the world. Plus, it was in the early 20th century, way after the first circumnavigation.

Option D is Mayflower. That's the ship that brought the Pilgrims to America in 1620. Definitely not the first around the world.

Option G is Endeavour. That's another ship I think Captain Cook sailed on, again much later.

Option H is Elizabeth II. That's a modern ship, probably a royal yacht or something, not from the Age of Exploration.

Option I is Triton. Not sure about this one. Maybe a submarine or a later ship.

Option J is Victoria. Wait, I think that's the name of the ship that finally completed the circumnavigation after Magellan's death. Because Magellan started the journey, but his ship, the Trinidad, didn't make it all the way. Instead, the Victoria was the ship that actually completed the trip, captained by Juan Sebastián Elcano. So did the Victoria make it the first ship to sail around the world?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought the first circumnavigation was by the fleet led by Magellan, but only the Victoria completed the journey. So the ship's name would be Victoria, which is option J.

Alternatively, sometimes the fleet is remembered under Magellan's name, but the individual ship that completed the trip was Victoria. So I think the answer is J: Victoria.
