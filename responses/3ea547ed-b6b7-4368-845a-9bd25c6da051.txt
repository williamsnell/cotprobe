Okay, so I have this question about a two-level system and its temperature. Hmm, I remember that in thermodynamics, the population distribution between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the ratio of the populations of two states depends on the energy difference between them and the temperature.

The question states that the energy separation is 400 cm⁻¹. Oh wait, I need to convert that into energy units compatible with temperature. I recall that 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to about 1.44 × 10⁻²³ J, but maybe it's easier to use the relation between energy and temperature via the Boltzmann constant. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 1 cm⁻¹ is approximately 1.44 K because the Boltzmann constant k is about 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K, so 1 cm⁻¹ is k multiplied by 1 cm⁻¹, but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of wavenumbers and temperature conversion.

Wait, another approach: the relation between energy E and temperature T is given by E = k*T, where k is the Boltzmann constant. But wait, the energy separation here is given in wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), so I should convert that into energy first, then relate it to the temperature.

So, the energy difference ΔE is 400 cm⁻¹. Let's convert that to Joules. Since 1 cm⁻¹ = 1.986 × 10⁻²³ J (because 1 eV ≈ 8065.5 cm⁻¹, and 1 eV is 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J), so ΔE = 400 * 1.986e-23 J ≈ 7.944e-21 J.

But maybe using the relation between wavenumber and temperature directly is easier. Oh wait, I think the relation is that the thermal energy kT is equal to the energy ΔE in units where the conversion is considered. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the ratio of populations.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the populations N_upper / N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Wait, no, wait: the general form is N_i / N_j = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(kT)). Since the upper state is higher in energy, E_upper = E_lower + ΔE. So N_upper / N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

In this problem, the population of the upper state is one-third that of the lower state. So N_upper = (1/3) N_lower. So the ratio N_upper/N_lower = 1/3. Therefore:

1/3 = exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -ΔE/(kT)

ln(1/3) is ln(3⁻¹) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So, -ln(3) = -ΔE/(kT) → ln(3) = ΔE/(kT).

So, T = ΔE/(k ln(3)).

Now, I need to compute T. But wait, the units here are important. ΔE is given in cm⁻¹, and I need to convert that into energy in Joules, or there's a way to directly relate cm⁻¹ to temperature.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the fact that 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to about 1.44 × 10³ K, because k (Boltzmann constant) is approximately 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K, and 1 cm⁻¹ is 1.986 × 10⁻²³ J. So T = ΔE/(k) when ΔE is in J.

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

First, compute ΔE in J:

ΔE = 400 cm⁻¹ × (1.986e-23 J/cm⁻¹) ≈ 400 * 1.986e-23 ≈ 7.944e-21 J.

Now, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, T = ΔE / (k * ln(3)).

Plugging in the numbers:

T = (7.944e-21 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1.0986) 

Compute denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.0986 ≈ 1.518e-23 J/K.

So T ≈ 7.944e-21 / 1.518e-23 ≈ approximately 523.5 K.

Looking at the options, option G is 524 K, which matches closely.

The temperature of the two-level system can be determined using the Boltzmann distribution. The energy separation is given as \( 400 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \), which corresponds to approximately \( 7.944 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{J} \). The population ratio of the upper to lower state is \( 1/3 \), leading to the equation \( \ln(3) = \Delta E / (kT) \). Solving for \( T \) gives \( T \approx 524 \, \mathrm{K} \).
