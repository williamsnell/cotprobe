Okay, I've got this question about Jaina groups and specifically about which group allows only women to lead a life of semi-renunciation. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I should recall what I know about Jainism. Jainism has different sects, each with its own practices and beliefs. The main ones I remember are the Svetambaras and the Digambaras. But there are others too, like the Terapanthis and the Yapaniyas, I think.

The question is about semi-renunciation led by women. So, semi-renunciation usually refers to a middle path between full lay life and full renunciation. In some traditions, women have specific roles or practices. I remember that the Yapaniya sect is known for allowing women to practice asceticism, which might be a form of semi-renunciation.

Wait, the Yapaniya Jains are a sub-sect, right? They are part of the Svetambara tradition, I believe. Svetambaras are one of the main branches, and they do have specific practices regarding women. The Yapaniya women are called 'Yaties' and they practice a form of asceticism, which might involve semi-renunciation.

Looking at the options, option D is Yapaniya. That seems right. Let me check the other options quickly. Murtipujaka (A) are image-worshippers, so probably not. Digambara (B) are the sky-clad Jains who don't wear clothes, but I think they don't allow women to become ascetics. Terapanthi (F) is another sub-sect, but I'm not sure if they're the ones allowing women's semi-renunciation.

Jina (G) is more of a title for the Tirthankaras, not a sect. Shramana (H) is a broader term for ascetics. Svetambara (I) is a main sect, but Yapaniya is a sub-sect under them, so I think the answer is D.

The answer is D: Yapaniya.
