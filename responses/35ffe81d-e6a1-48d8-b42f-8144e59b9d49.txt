Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack Conlon's earnings. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, Jack is on a salary-plus-commission plan. His salary is $200 a week, and he gets a 3% commission on his sales. He made $3,550 in sales over two weeks. I need to find his total earnings for those two weeks.

First, I think I should calculate his base salary for two weeks. Since he earns $200 each week, over two weeks that would be 2 times $200. Let me do that: 2 * 200 = $400. So his salary part is $400.

Next, I need to calculate the commission. His commission rate is 3%, and his total sales were $3,550. To find the commission, I multiply the sales by 3%. So that's 3% of 3,550. 

Hmm, 3% as a decimal is 0.03. So 3,550 * 0.03. Let me calculate that. 

3,550 * 0.03. Well, 3,000 * 0.03 is 90, and 550 * 0.03 is 16.5. Adding those together, 90 + 16.5 = $106.50. So his commission is $106.50.

Now, to find his total earnings, I add his salary and commission together. That's $400 (salary) + $106.50 (commission) = $506.50.

Let me check if that makes sense. Wait, looking at the options, J is $506.50. So that should be the correct answer.

Jack's total earnings are calculated by adding his two-week salary of $400 to his $106.50 commission, resulting in $506.50.
