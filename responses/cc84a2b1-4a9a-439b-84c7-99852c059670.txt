Okay, so I have this problem about the longevity of people in a certain area. The standard deviation is given as 14 years, and I know that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. I need to find the mean longevity, assuming a normal distribution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that in a normal distribution, about 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, and so on. But here, only 30% live longer than 75 years. So, that means 70% live 75 years or less. Wait, no, actually, let me think: if 30% live longer than 75, then 70% live at or below 75. So 75 is the point where 70% are below it and 30% are above. 

In terms of the standard normal distribution, I think this corresponds to a percentile. Since 30% are above 75, that means 75 is the 70th percentile. Because percentiles are the value below which a certain percentage falls. So the 70th percentile is the point where 70% are below it, which matches 75 years being the point where 70% live up to that age.

Now, to find the mean, I think I need to relate this to the z-score. The z-score formula is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. Here, X is 75, σ is 14, and the z-score corresponds to the 70th percentile.

I remember that the z-score for the 70th percentile can be found using a z-table or a calculator. Let me recall: the z-score for 70% is around 0.5244. Because the standard normal distribution table tells us that a z-score of about 0.5244 corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.70. Let me double-check that. Oh right, because the area to the left of the z-score is 0.70, which means 70% are below it, and 30% are above.

So, using the formula: z = (X - μ) / σ → μ = X - (z * σ). Plugging in the numbers: μ = 75 - (0.5244 * 14). Let me calculate that. 0.5244 multiplied by 14 is about 7.3416. So 75 minus 7.3416 is approximately 67.6584. Wait, that doesn't seem right because if the mean is lower than 75, then the 70th percentile would be 75. Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If X is 75, which is the 70th percentile, then the z-score is positive 0.5244. So the formula should be μ = X - z * σ. Wait, no, that would give μ = 75 - (0.5244*14), which is lower than 75, but that would mean that 75 is above the mean. But if the mean is lower than 75, then 75 is to the right of the mean, so the area to the right of 75 would be 30%, which matches. So that makes sense.

Wait, let me visualize this. The normal curve has the mean at μ. 75 is a point to the right of μ, where 30% is beyond it. So yes, μ is less than 75, so the mean is lower. So using μ = X - z*σ, where X is 75, z is 0.5244, and σ is 14. So 0.5244 *14 is 7.3416, so μ =75 -7.3416 ≈67.66 years.

But wait, looking at the answer options, I don't see 67.66. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 75 - 0.30(14)
B: 75 + 0.30(14)
C: 75 - 0.70(14)
D: 75 + 0.70(14)
E: 75 + 0.60(14)
F: 75 - 0.5244(14)
G: 75 + 0.4756(14)
H: 75 - 0.4756(14)
I: 75 - 0.60(14)
J: 75 + 0.5244(14)

So, μ =75 -0.5244*14, which is option F. But wait, let me check the calculation again. Because sometimes I get confused whether it's X = μ + zσ, so maybe I should re-express it.

Wait, the formula is X = μ + zσ. So, X is 75, z is 0.5244, σ is14. So 75 = μ + 0.5244*14 → μ =75 - (0.5244*14). Yep, that's correct. So option F is 75 -0.5244(14), which is the correct formula. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way: If 30% are above 75, then the z-score for 75 is 0.5244, so the mean is 75 minus that z-score times the standard deviation. So yes, F is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes I might confuse whether it's the upper or lower tail. Since 30% are above 75, the z-score is positive, and the formula would subtract that from X to get μ. So yes, F is correct.

The problem involves finding the mean longevity of a population with a standard deviation of 14 years, where 30% live longer than 75 years, assuming a normal distribution. 

To solve this, we recognize that 75 years corresponds to the 70th percentile, as 70% of the population lives at or below this age. Using the standard normal distribution, the z-score for the 70th percentile is approximately 0.5244. 

The z-score formula is:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Rearranging to solve for the mean (\(\mu\)):

\[
\mu = X - z \cdot \sigma
\]

Substituting the given values (\(X = 75\), \(\sigma = 14\), \(z = 0.5244\)):

\[
\mu = 75 - (0.5244 \cdot 14)
\]

This corresponds to option F.
