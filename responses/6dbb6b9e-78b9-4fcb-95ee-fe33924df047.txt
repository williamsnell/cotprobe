Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many daps equal 42 baps. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: If 4 daps equal 7 yaps, and 5 yaps equal 3 baps, how many daps equal 42 baps? The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to convert baps to yaps first, and then yaps to daps. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that 5 yaps = 3 baps. So, if I have 42 baps, I can find out how many yaps that is. Let me write that as a conversion factor.

So, 5 yaps = 3 baps. That means 1 bap = 5/3 yaps. Wait, no, actually, to find how many yaps equal 42 baps, I should set up a ratio. If 3 baps = 5 yaps, then 42 baps would be how many yaps?

Let me think. If 3 baps = 5 yaps, then 1 bap = 5/3 yaps. So, 42 baps would be 42 * (5/3) yaps. Let me calculate that.

42 divided by 3 is 14. 14 multiplied by 5 is 70. So, 42 baps equal 70 yaps. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, I need to convert those 70 yaps into daps. The first part of the problem says 4 daps = 7 yaps. So, how many daps are in 70 yaps?

Again, I'll set up a conversion. 4 daps = 7 yaps. So, 1 yap = 4/7 daps. Therefore, 70 yaps would be 70 * (4/7) daps.

Let me compute that. 70 divided by 7 is 10. 10 multiplied by 4 is 40. So, 70 yaps equal 40 daps. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. 

Starting with 42 baps:
- Convert to yaps: 42 baps * (5 yaps / 3 baps) = 70 yaps.
- Then convert yaps to daps: 70 yaps * (4 daps /7 yaps) = 40 daps.

Yes, that looks correct. So, 42 baps equal 40 daps. Let me check the options. Option B is 40, so that should be the answer.

The correct answer is B: 40. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Convert 42 baps to yaps using the given ratio: 5 yaps = 3 baps.
   - 42 baps × (5 yaps / 3 baps) = 70 yaps.

2. Convert 70 yaps to daps using the given ratio: 4 daps = 7 yaps.
   - 70 yaps × (4 daps / 7 yaps) = 40 daps.

Therefore, 42 baps equal 40 daps.

Answer: B
