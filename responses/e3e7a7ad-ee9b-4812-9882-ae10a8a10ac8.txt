Question:

An owner operated a successful retail business. He decided he wanted to retire and listed his business for sale. A buyer saw the listing and visited the retail business. The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect "unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. " Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract?

Options:

A: The buyer's lack of effort in obtaining a loan is a breach of good faith and fair dealing.
B: The buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of her decision not to seek a loan.
C: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.
D: The owner suffered financial loss due to the buyer's inaction in seeking a loan.
E: The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.
F: The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a "condition" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.
G: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.
H: The buyer did not explicitly state in the contract that she would not seek a loan.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it carefully. 

The scenario is about a business owner who wants to sell his business. He lists it for sale, a buyer comes along, says she's interested but needs a bank loan. They draft a contract where the sale won't take effect unless she gets the loan. The buyer didn't make any effort to get the loan, and now the owner is suing for breach of contract.

The question is, what's the owner's strongest argument?

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one is correct based on contract law principles. Let me break it down.

First, the contract includes a provision that the sale is conditional on the buyer getting a bank loan. So, this is a condition precedent. A condition precedent is something that must happen before the main obligation is fulfilled. So, the buyer's duty to purchase is contingent on her securing the loan.

Now, the buyer didn't make any effort to get the loan. So, the question is whether the buyer's inaction constitutes a breach.

In contract law, generally, a condition precedent isn't a promise but an event that must occur. If the event doesn't happen, the contract isn't breached; it's just that the condition wasn't met. However, sometimes there's a duty to make a reasonable effort to fulfill the condition. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Buyer's lack of effort is a breach of good faith and fair dealing. Good faith is a general principle, but I think the key here is whether the lack of effort breaches the contract.

Option B: Buyer had a duty to inform the owner of her decision not to seek a loan. I'm not sure about this. If the buyer decided not to pursue the loan, maybe she should inform the owner, but the contract didn't specify that. It just said the sale wouldn't take effect unless she gets the loan. So maybe the duty is just to perform, not necessarily to inform.

Option C: The condition should be excused because non-occurrence causes forfeiture. This seems to argue that the condition is onerous and should be waived, but the owner is the one relying on the condition being met. So the court might not excuse it easily.

Option D: Owner suffered financial loss due to buyer's inaction. But proving financial loss isn't necessarily the issue here. The issue is whether the buyer's inaction breaches the contract, regardless of loss.

Option E: Buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort. Hmm, this might be relevant. If the contract requires the buyer to get a loan, she's not just supposed to wait passively; she needs to make a reasonable effort. If she doesn't, that's a breach.

Option F: The loan wasn't worded as a condition. But the contract did state it as a condition, so F seems incorrect.

Option G: The condition is unconscionable. Unconscionability requires that the term be unfair and that no reasonable person would agree to it. I don't think just having a loan condition makes it unconscionable, especially if both parties agreed to it.

Option H: Buyer didn't explicitly state she wouldn't seek a loan. But the issue is whether she made any effort, not whether she communicated her decision.

So, focusing on E. The buyer had a duty to make a reasonable effort to obtain the loan. If she didn't even try, that's a breach of that implied duty. Alternatively, if the contract includes a condition that requires the buyer to actively seek the loan, her failure would breach that.

Wait, another angle: If the condition is that the buyer secures a loan, but she makes no effort, she hasn't breached the condition itself. The condition is whether she obtained the loan, not whether she tried. But in some jurisdictions, there's an implied duty to use reasonable efforts to satisfy a condition. So, the buyer's failure to make any effort could be a breach of that duty, even if the condition wasn't met.

So, looking at the options, E seems correct because it's about breaching an implied promise to make a reasonable effort. Alternatively, A is about good faith, but I think E is more specific.

Another thought: The contract's condition is that the sale won't take effect unless she's successful in getting the loan. So, the failure to get the loan doesn't necessarily breach the contract unless she failed to make a reasonable effort. So, the owner can argue that the buyer didn't just fail to secure the loan, but also failed to make any effort, thus breaching an implied duty.

Therefore, the strongest argument is E: the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort.

The strongest argument for the owner is that the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain the loan, as her complete lack of effort constitutes a failure to fulfill this implied duty.

Answer: E
