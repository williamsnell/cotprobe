Question:

Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the cereal box was not in plain sight during the search.
B: denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.
C: granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.
D: granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.
E: denied, because the landlord gave the police permission to enter the apartment.
F: granted, because the police had no proof of the husband's involvement at the time of the search.
G: denied, because the fingerprint evidence was crucial to the investigation.
H: granted, because the police did not have the husband's consent to search his apartment.
I: denied, because the husband was not present during the search of his apartment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a motion to suppress evidence. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a woman called the police about a disturbance, they went to the address, found the homeowner dead, and the murder weapon was a baseball bat with blood. The victim had recently separated from her husband, who moved away. The police then questioned friends and relatives and concluded the husband was a prime suspect. Two detectives went to his apartment, persuaded the landlord to let them in, found no one, and then searched the place. They took a box of cereal to use for fingerprints, which matched those on the bat. Now, the husband is subpoenaed to testify, but he's moving to suppress the evidence, saying it was obtained illegally.

The question is whether his motion should be granted or denied, and the options are A to I.

First, I need to think about the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The police searched the husband's apartment without a warrant. They got in because the landlord let them in. So, did they have legal authority to search?

I remember that for a search to be legal without a warrant, there needs to be either consent or another exception. Here, the landlord gave permission, but does that count? Wait, the landlord owns the property, but the husband is the tenant. So, the landlord's consent might not be sufficient because the tenant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in their own apartment. I think the Supreme Court case about this is Florida v. Jardines, where they said that a police officer coming onto the porch of a home is a search. But in this case, the police entered the apartment with the landlord's permission. Hmm, but the landlord isn't the occupant. So, does the landlord have the authority to consent to a search of the tenant's apartment? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

I think generally, a landlord's consent isn't enough because the tenant has a reasonable expectation of privacy. So, the police entering without a warrant and without the tenant's consent would be an unconstitutional search. Therefore, any evidence found during that search, like the cereal box, would be subject to the exclusionary rule.

Wait, but the exclusionary rule applies to suppress evidence in criminal prosecutions. But here, the evidence is being presented to a grand jury. Does the exclusionary rule apply to grand jury proceedings? I'm not sure. I remember that the exclusionary rule primarily applies in criminal trials, not necessarily in grand jury investigations. So, even if the evidence was obtained illegally, the grand jury could still consider it because the exclusionary rule doesn't extend there.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option B says the motion should be denied because the exclusionary rule hasn't been extended to grand jury hearings. That seems plausible. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle: if the search was unconstitutional because it was warrantless and without consent, then the evidence should be suppressed. But if the grand jury is allowed to hear it regardless, then the suppression motion would be denied.

So, looking at the options, if the search was illegal (which it might be because the landlord's consent doesn't count), then the evidence should be suppressed, but if the exclusionary rule doesn't apply to the grand jury, then the motion is denied.

I think the key is whether the exclusionary rule applies to grand juries. From what I recall, the exclusionary rule applies in court proceedings, but grand juries are considered part of the investigatory process, so evidence obtained illegally might still be admissible. So, the motion would be denied because the exclusionary rule doesn't bar the grand jury from considering it.

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: denied because the exclusionary rule hasn't been extended to grand jury hearings. So, the motion should be denied.

Another point: the police took the cereal box during the search. If the search was illegal, then the evidence from that search (the fingerprints) should be suppressed. But if the grand jury isn't bound by the exclusionary rule, then it's allowed. So, the husband's motion to suppress is about whether this evidence can be used against him. If the grand jury can still use it, then the motion is denied.

So, putting it all together: the search was likely illegal because the landlord's consent doesn't suffice, but the exclusionary rule doesn't apply to grand juries. Therefore, the evidence isn't suppressed, and the motion is denied. So the answer would be B.

The question revolves around whether the husband's motion to suppress evidence should be granted or denied. The police conducted a warrantless search of the husband's apartment with the landlord's permission, which may not be sufficient under the Fourth Amendment. However, the exclusionary rule, which typically applies in criminal trials, has not been extended to grand jury proceedings. Therefore, the evidence obtained during the search can be considered by the grand jury, and the motion to suppress should be denied.

Answer: B
