Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the heating value of a coal sample using a bomb calorimeter. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on calorimetry, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the problem gives me the mass of the coal sample, which is 1.4447 grams. It's burned in an oxygen bomb calorimeter. The temperature rise is 7.795°C, right? Wait, actually, looking again, the question says the rise is 7.795 F0 = 4.331°C. Oh, maybe that's a typo or formatting issue. So I think the temperature change is 4.331°C because F0 probably refers to the Fahrenheit scale, but since the water equivalent is given in grams and the standard formula uses Celsius, I'll go with 4.331°C for the temperature change.

The water equivalent of the calorimeter is 2511 grams. Wait, what's water equivalent again? Oh right, the water equivalent (m_w + m_c(c_c/c_w)) is the mass of water that would absorb the same amount of heat as the calorimeter itself. So the total heat absorbed by the system (calorimeter and water) is calculated using this water equivalent.

So the formula for heat absorbed (q) is q = (m_w + m_c*(c_calorimeter/c_water)) * c_water * ΔT. But since the water equivalent already includes all that, q = (water equivalent) * c_water * ΔT.

Wait, no, water equivalent is m_w + m_c*(c_cal/c_w). So when you multiply by c_water, it's (m_w + m_c*(c_cal/c_w)) * c_water * ΔT. But wait, if c_cal is the specific heat of the calorimeter material (like metal), then m_c is the mass of the calorimeter. But in this case, the problem gives the water equivalent directly as 2511 grams. So I think that's the total effective mass in terms of water, so I can just use that as the water equivalent (W) which is W = m_w + m_c*(c_c/c_w).

So the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and water together is q = W * c_water * ΔT. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the water equivalent W is the mass of water that would absorb the same amount of heat as the entire calorimeter system. So the heat released by the coal burning is equal to the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and water, which is q = W * c_water * ΔT.

Wait, but sometimes people use the formula q = (m_water + m_calorimeter*(c_cal/c_water)) * c_water * ΔT. Since c_water is the specific heat of water, and m_calorimeter*(c_cal/c_water) is the equivalent mass in water terms. So when you factor that in, q = (m_water + m_cal*c_cal/c_water) * c_water * ΔT. Which simplifies to m_water * c_water * ΔT + m_cal * c_cal * ΔT. But that's the same as the total heat absorbed by both water and calorimeter.

But since the problem gives W as 2511 grams, which is m_w + m_c*(c_c/c_w), then q = W * c_water * ΔT. So I don't need to worry about the individual masses of the calorimeter and water; I can just use W directly.

So, first, calculate the heat absorbed by the calorimeter system. Let me note down the values:

W = 2511 grams
ΔT = 4.331°C
c_water = 1 cal/(g·°C) because usually, in calorimetry, the specific heat of water is taken as 1 cal/g°C for simplicity.

So q = W * c_water * ΔT = 2511 g * 1 cal/(g·°C) * 4.331°C = let me calculate that.

2511 * 4.331. Let me compute that step by step.

2511 * 4 = 10,044
2511 * 0.331 ≈ 2511 * 0.3 = 753.3, 2511*0.031≈77.841 → total ≈ 753.3 +77.841 = 831.141
So total q ≈ 10,044 + 831.141 = 10,875.141 calories. So approximately 10,875 calories.

Wait, but wait. The heat absorbed by the calorimeter is equal to the heat released by the coal. So the heat from the coal is 10,875 calories. But the coal's heating value is usually expressed in cal/g or Btu/lb.

The mass of the coal sample is 1.4447 grams. So the heating value (H) in cal/g would be q/m_coal.

So H = 10,875 cal / 1.4447 g ≈ let me compute that.

10,875 / 1.4447 ≈ Let me see. 1.4447 is roughly 1.4447 ≈ 1.445.

So 10,875 / 1.445 ≈ Let me compute:

1.445 * 7,000 = 1.445 *7k= 10,115

1.445 *7500=1.445*7.5k= 10,837.5

Wait, because 7,500 *1.445= 7,500 *1 + 7,500 *0.445= 7,500 + 3,337.5 = 10,837.5

So 7,500 gives 10,837.5, which is just a bit less than 10,875. The difference is 10,875 - 10,837.5 = 37.5 cal.

So 37.5 cal /1.445 g ≈ 25.98 cal/g. So adding that to 7,500 gives 7,525.98 cal/g. Approximately 7,526 cal/g.

Looking at the options, option C is 7525 cal/g, and option F is 8,200 cal/g. So 7,525 is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made an error in division.

Wait, 10,875 divided by 1.4447.

Let me compute 1.4447 * 7525 = ?

Let me compute 7525 * 1.4447:

But perhaps a better way is to do the division step by step.

10,875 ÷ 1.4447.

Let me approximate 1.4447 as 1.4447 ≈ 1.445.

Let me compute 10,875 ÷ 1.445.

1.445 * 7000 = 10,115 (as before)
1.445 * 7500 = 10,837.5
So 7500 gives 10,837.5, which is less than 10,875 by 37.5.

So, how much more is needed beyond 7500?

Each 1 cal/g gives 1.445 cal, so to get 37.5 cal:

37.5 /1.445 ≈ 25.98 cal/g.

So total is 7500 +25.98 ≈7525.98 cal/g, which rounds to 7526 cal/g, so option C is 7525 cal/g.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is 7525 cal/g, which matches. But looking at the options, I also see option E is 10,875 cal, which is the total heat in calories, but the question asks for heating value, which is per gram, so option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting Btu per lb. Let me think about units. The options have some in Btu/lb and some in cal/gm. So I have to make sure what the question is asking.

Wait, the question says, "What is the heating value of the coal sample?" without specifying units, but the options include both cal/g and Btu/lb. So perhaps I should check whether I need to convert to Btu/lb.

Wait, because the initial data is in grams, but the options include both. Let me see.

So first, we have the heating value in cal/g as 7525 cal/g. Now, to convert that to Btu/lb, because sometimes heating values are given in those units.

But wait, the question doesn't specify; it's just asking for the heating value. The options include both, so perhaps I need to calculate both.

Wait, but let's see the options again. Option C is 7525 cal/g, which is what I calculated. Option D is 13,520 Btu/lb. So perhaps I should compute it in Btu/lb as well.

Hmm, let's proceed.

Heating value in cal/g is 7525 cal/g.

Now, to convert cal/g to Btu/lb:

We know that 1 cal = 4.184 J, and 1 Btu ≈ 1055.06 J. So 1 cal ≈ 0.00239 Btu.

So 7525 cal/g = 7525 * 0.00239 Btu/g ≈ let me compute that.

7525 * 0.00239 ≈ ?

Well, 7525 * 0.002 = 15.05

7525 * 0.00039 ≈ 7525 * 0.0004 = 3.01, so approximately 3.01.

Adding them together: 15.05 +3.01=18.06 Btu/g.

Now, convert grams to pounds. 1 lb = 453.592 grams.

So, heating value per pound is 18.06 Btu/g * 453.592 g/lb ≈ 18.06 *453.592 ≈

Let me compute 18 *453.592 = 8164.656

0.06 *453.592 ≈27.2155

Total ≈8164.656 +27.2155 ≈8191.87 Btu/lb. Approximately 8200 Btu/lb.

Wait, but none of the options have 8200 Btu/lb except option B is 15,000 Btu/lb, and option D is 13,520 Btu/lb. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the cal/g to Btu/lb conversion.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

Heating value H = 7525 cal/g.

Convert cal to Btu: 1 cal = 0.000239 Btu (since 1 Btu = 250.343 cal, so 1 cal = 1/250.343 ≈ 0.00399 Btu? Wait, perhaps I confused the conversion factors earlier.

Wait, actually, 1 calorie (cal) is approximately 4.184 joules. 1 Btu is approximately 1055.06 joules. So 1 cal = 4.184 J = 4.184 / 1055.06 ≈ 0.003966 Btu.

So 7525 cal/g = 7525 * 0.003966 Btu/g ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 7525 * 0.003966:

7525 * 0.003 = 22.575

7525 * 0.000966 ≈ let's compute 7525 * 0.0009 = 6.7725, and 7525*0.000066≈0.49665. So total ≈6.7725 +0.49665≈7.26915.

So total Btu/g ≈22.575 +7.26915 ≈30.844 Btu/g.

Now, convert grams to pounds: 1 lb = 453.592 grams.

So per pound, it's 30.844 Btu/g * 453.592 g/lb ≈ 30.844 *453.592 ≈

Let me compute 30 *453.592 =13,607.76

0.844 *453.592 ≈ let's compute 0.8 *453.592=362.8736; 0.044 *453.592≈19.957. So total≈362.8736 +19.957≈382.8306.

Adding to 13,607.76: 13,607.76 +382.8306≈13,990.59 Btu/lb.

Looking at the options, option D is 13,520 Btu/lb, which is close but not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact conversions.

Let me try again.

H = 7525 cal/g.

Convert to Btu/lb:

1 cal = 0.000239006 Btu (since 1 Btu = 250.343 cal, so 1 cal = 1/250.343 ≈ 0.003992 Btu).

Wait, no, 1 cal = 4.184 J, 1 Btu = 1055.06 J. So 1 cal = 4.184 / 1055.06 ≈ 0.003966 Btu.

So 7525 cal/g =7525 *0.003966 ≈ 7525 *0.003966.

Let me compute 7525 *0.003966:

First, 7525 *0.003 =22.575.

7525 *0.000966= let's compute 7525 *0.0009=6.7725, and 7525*0.000066≈0.49665.

Adding, 6.7725 +0.49665≈7.26915.

So total Btu/g ≈22.575 +7.26915≈30.84415 Btu/g.

Now, per pound: 30.84415 Btu/g * 453.592 g/lb ≈30.84415 *453.592.

Let me compute this more accurately.

30.84415 *453.592.

First, 30 *453.592 =13,607.76.

0.84415 *453.592.

Compute 0.8 *453.592=362.8736.

0.04415 *453.592.

Compute 0.04 *453.592=18.14368.

0.00415 *453.592≈1.882.

So, 18.14368 +1.882≈20.02568.

So 0.84415 *453.592 ≈362.8736 +20.02568≈382.89928.

Now, total is 13,607.76 +382.89928≈13,990.659 Btu/lb.

Hmm, that's approximately 13,990 Btu/lb. But looking at the options, the closest is D:13,520 Btu/lb, which is slightly lower. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation of the heat absorbed. Let me check that again.

q = W * c_water * ΔT.

W =2511 g, ΔT=4.331°C, c_water=1 cal/g°C.

So q=2511 *4.331= let me compute that accurately.

2511 *4=10,044.

2511 *0.331= let's compute 2511 *0.3=753.3; 2511 *0.031=77.841.

753.3 +77.841=831.141.

So total q=10,044 +831.141=10,875.141 cal.

So that's correct.

Then, heating value H= q/m_coal=10,875.141 cal /1.4447 g≈7525 cal/g.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in Btu/lb, so 7525 cal/g equals approximately 13,990 Btu/lb. But the options don't have this exact value. The closest option is D:13,520 Btu/lb.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the water equivalent. Let me check.

Wait, the problem states that the water equivalent is 2511 grams. So W=2511 g, which includes the calorimeter and the water. So the heat absorbed is W * c_water * ΔT=2511 *1*4.331=10,875.141 cal.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question is in Fahrenheit, but no, the rise is given as 4.331°C because F0 is probably a typo and the correct value is in Celsius. Because if it were in Fahrenheit, the ΔT would be much higher, leading to a much higher q, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion from cal/g to Btu/lb.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me compute 7525 cal/g to Btu/lb.

7525 cal/g * (1 Btu/250.343 cal) * (453.592 g/lb).

So:

7525 * (1/250.343) *453.592 ≈

Compute 7525 /250.343 ≈ let's see:

250.343 *30=7,510.3, which is close to 7525.

So 30 *250.343=7,510.3.

7525-7510.3=14.7.

So 14.7 /250.343≈0.0587.

So total ≈30.0587 Btu/g.

Then, multiply by 453.592 g/lb: 30.0587 *453.592≈

30 *453.592=13,607.76.

0.0587 *453.592≈26.67.

So total≈13,607.76 +26.67≈13,634.43 Btu/lb.

Hmm, that's about 13,634 Btu/lb, which is still not matching option D:13,520.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

7525 /250.343 = let's compute 250.343 *30=7510.29.

7525-7510.29=14.71.

So 14.71 /250.343 ≈0.05878.

So 30.05878 Btu/g.

Multiply by 453.592 g/lb: 30.05878 *453.592.

Compute 30 *453.592=13,607.76.

0.05878 *453.592≈

Compute 0.05 *453.592=22.6796.

0.00878 *453.592≈4.000.

So total≈22.6796 +4≈26.6796.

So total≈13,607.76 +26.6796≈13,634.44 Btu/lb.

Hmm, that's about 13,634 Btu/lb, but the closest option is D:13,520, which is about 114 Btu less. That's a significant difference. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal/g, which is option C:7525 cal/g. Since that's one of the options, and the other calculation for Btu/lb doesn't match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Btu/lb conversion. Let me try using exact conversion factors.

1 cal = 4.184 J.

1 Btu = 1055.06 J.

So 1 cal = 4.184 / 1055.06 ≈ 0.003966 Btu.

So 7525 cal/g =7525 *0.003966≈30.844 Btu/g.

Now, 1 lb=453.592 grams.

So 30.844 Btu/g *453.592 g/lb ≈30.844 *453.592.

Let me compute 30 *453.592=13,607.76.

0.844 *453.592≈ compute 0.8 *453.592=362.8736; 0.044*453.592≈19.957.

Adding: 362.8736 +19.957≈382.8306.

Total Btu/lb≈13,607.76 +382.8306≈13,990.59 Btu/lb.

Hmm, that's about 13,990 Btu/lb, which still doesn't match any option except perhaps D:13,520, which is lower. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of q.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal/g, which is option C, and the Btu/lb is a distractor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of q.

Wait, let me double-check the value of W.

The problem states the water equivalent is 2511 grams. So W=2511 g. So q=2511 *1 cal/g°C *4.331°C=10,875.141 cal. That seems correct.

Then, heating value H=10,875.141 cal /1.4447 g≈7525 cal/g, which is option C.

Looking back at the options, option C is 7525 cal/g, which seems to be the correct answer based on the calculations. The other options either don't match the units or the values.

So, I think the correct answer is C:7525 cal/g.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the heating value of a coal sample using data from a bomb calorimeter. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Heat Absorbed by the Calorimeter System**:  
   The water equivalent of the calorimeter is given as 2511 grams, and the temperature rise is 4.331°C. The heat absorbed by the system is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   q = W \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   q = 2511 \, \text{g} \cdot 1 \, \text{cal/(g°C)} \cdot 4.331 \, \text{°C} = 10,875.141 \, \text{cal}
   \]

2. **Heating Value of the Coal Sample**:  
   The heating value \( H \) is the heat released per gram of coal:  
   \[
   H = \frac{q}{m_{\text{coal}}} = \frac{10,875.141 \, \text{cal}}{1.4447 \, \text{g}} \approx 7525 \, \text{cal/g}
   \]

3. **Conversion to Btu/lb**:  
   To convert \( 7525 \, \text{cal/g} \) to Btu/lb:  
   - \( 1 \, \text{cal} = 0.000239 \, \text{Btu} \)  
   - \( 1 \, \text{lb} = 453.592 \, \text{g} \)  
   \[
   H = 7525 \, \text{cal/g} \cdot 0.000239 \, \text{Btu/cal} \cdot 453.592 \, \text{g/lb} \approx 13,990 \, \text{Btu/lb}
   \]  
   However, the closest option provided is \( 13,520 \, \text{Btu/lb} \), which does not match exactly.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The calculated heating value in cal/g matches option C (\( 7525 \, \text{cal/g} \)), which is consistent with the data and calculations.

**Answer**: C
