Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about airflow through a nozzle and a shock wave. Let me try to unpack what's going on here. The question is asking how much the velocity changes across the shock. The given data is the upstream Mach number, Mx = 1.8, and the downstream static temperature, Ty = 800°R. The gamma, γ, is 1.4. The options are various velocities, so I need to find the change in velocity, ΔV, which is Vy - Vx.

First, I remember that when a shock wave occurs in a supersonic flow, there's a sudden change in the flow properties. Since Mx is 1.8, which is greater than 1, the flow upstream is supersonic, and the shock is likely a normal shock because it's in a nozzle, which typically has a steady, one-dimensional flow.

I think I should use the normal shock relations here. The key ones are the relations between Mach numbers, temperatures, pressures, and velocities before and after the shock.

I recall that for a normal shock, the Mach number upstream (Mx) and downstream (My) are related by the equation:

1/(My²) = (γ + 1)/(γ - 1) * (1/(Mx²)) + 2/(γ + 1)

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, there's another relation involving the temperatures. The temperature ratio across the shock can be given by:

Ty / Tx = ( (γ + 1) / (γ - 1) ) * Mx² / (1 + (γ - 1)/2 * Mx² )

Hmm, maybe that's a better starting point because I know Tx isn't given directly, but I can find it if needed.

Wait, I think another approach is to find the downstream Mach number first. Let's try that.

The formula for the downstream Mach number My in terms of Mx is:

My = [ (γ + 1) * Mx ] / [ (γ - 1) * Mx² + 2 ]

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the correct formula for My in terms of Mx.

I think the correct relation is:

1/My² = ( (γ + 1)/(γ - 1) ) * (1/Mx²) ) + 2/(γ + 1)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the normal shock relations again, but since I can't do that, I'll try to derive or recall correctly.

Another approach: The normal shock relation for temperatures is Ty = Tx * [ (γ + 1)/(γ - 1) ] * (Mx²) / [ 1 + (γ - 1)/2 * Mx² ]

But without Tx, maybe I can express the ratio of temperatures. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the upstream temperature Tx and then use that to find velocities.

Wait, but I don't know the upstream static temperature. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can express the velocities in terms of the speed of sound, which depends on the temperature.

The speed of sound a is given by sqrt(γ * R * T), where R is the specific gas constant. But since R might cancel out, maybe I can relate the velocities in terms of the sound speeds upstream and downstream.

The upstream velocity Vx is Mx * a_x, where a_x is the speed of sound upstream. Similarly, Vy = My * a_y.

So, the change in velocity ΔV = Vy - Vx = My*a_y - Mx*a_x.

But to find this, I need expressions for a_y and a_x in terms of known quantities.

I know that the temperature downstream Ty is related to the upstream temperature Tx via the normal shock relation. Let me try to find Ty in terms of Tx.

The temperature ratio across a normal shock is given by:

Ty / Tx = [ (γ + 1) * Mx² ] / [ (γ - 1) * Mx² + 2 ]

That's the formula I remember. Let me plug in the values. γ is 1.4, so γ + 1 = 2.4, γ - 1 = 0.4.

So,

Ty / Tx = (2.4 * (1.8)^2) / (0.4*(1.8)^2 + 2 )

Let me calculate numerator and denominator.

1.8 squared is 3.24.

Numerator: 2.4 * 3.24 = 7.776.

Denominator: (0.4 * 3.24) + 2 = 1.296 + 2 = 3.296.

So Ty / Tx = 7.776 / 3.296 ≈ 2.36.

So Ty = 2.36 * Tx.

But I don't know Tx. However, maybe I can express a_x and a_y in terms of Tx and Ty.

The speed of sound a is sqrt(γ * R * T). So,

a_x = sqrt(γ * R * Tx)
a_y = sqrt(γ * R * Ty) = sqrt(γ * R * (2.36 Tx)) = sqrt(2.36) * sqrt(γ R Tx) ) = sqrt(2.36) * a_x.

Wait, that's an interesting approach. So a_y = sqrt(2.36) * a_x.

But let me compute sqrt(2.36). Let's see, sqrt(2.25) is 1.5, so sqrt(2.36) is about 1.536.

Now, the downstream Mach number My can be found using the relation:

My = [ (γ + 1) * Mx ] / [ (γ - 1) * Mx² + 2 ]

Wait, I think that's the correct formula. Let me plug in the numbers.

γ +1 = 2.4, γ-1=0.4, Mx=1.8.

So numerator: 2.4 * 1.8 = 4.32.

Denominator: (0.4 * (1.8)^2) + 2 = 0.4 * 3.24 +2 = 1.296 +2 =3.296.

So My = 4.32 / 3.296 ≈ 1.31.

So My is approximately 1.31.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but let's go with it for now.

So, Vx = Mx * a_x = 1.8 * a_x.

Vy = My * a_y = 1.31 * a_y.

But a_y = sqrt(2.36) * a_x ≈ 1.536 a_x.

So Vy = 1.31 * 1.536 a_x ≈ 2.021 a_x.

So the change in velocity ΔV = Vy - Vx = (2.021 a_x) - (1.8 a_x) = 0.221 a_x.

Hmm, but I don't know a_x yet. Wait, maybe I can express a_x in terms of known variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities and then find the actual velocities using the temperatures.

Wait, another approach: Since the static temperature downstream is given as Ty = 800°R, and I have Ty = 2.36 Tx, so Tx = Ty / 2.36 ≈ 800 / 2.36 ≈ 338.983°R.

So Tx ≈ 338.983°R.

Now, the speed of sound upstream, a_x = sqrt(γ * R * Tx), and downstream, a_y = sqrt(γ * R * Ty).

But without knowing R, perhaps I can relate the velocities using the temperatures.

Let me compute a_x and a_y.

But wait, for an ideal gas, R is the specific gas constant. However, in the absence of specific values, perhaps I can express the velocities in terms of R and then see if it cancels out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of a_y to a_x.

a_y = sqrt(γ * R * Ty) = sqrt(γ R * 800) = sqrt(1.4 * R * 800)

a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx) = sqrt(1.4 R * 338.983)

So the ratio a_y / a_x = sqrt( (1.4 R * 800) / (1.4 R * 338.983) ) ) = sqrt(800 / 338.983) ≈ sqrt(2.36) ≈ 1.536, as before.

So, a_y = 1.536 a_x.

Now, Vx = 1.8 a_x.

Vy = My a_y = 1.31 * 1.536 a_x ≈ 2.021 a_x.

So ΔV = Vy - Vx = (2.021 a_x) - (1.8 a_x) = 0.221 a_x.

But I need to find the actual value of a_x to compute ΔV.

Wait, perhaps I can compute a_x using the upstream temperature.

a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx). I don't know R, but I can express it in terms of known constants. Wait, for air, R is approximately 1716 ft·lbf/(slug·°R), but maybe I can proceed without it because R might cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the velocities in terms of the speed of sound and then find the actual value using the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the static temperature ratio can be used to find the ratio of the speeds of sound, and then the velocities can be found using the Mach numbers.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently.

I know that the speed of sound a is proportional to sqrt(T). So, a_x = sqrt(Tx) and a_y = sqrt(Ty), but scaled by the square root of R and γ.

Wait, perhaps I can write a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx) and a_y = sqrt(γ R Ty). So the ratio a_y / a_x = sqrt(Ty / Tx).

From earlier, Ty = 2.36 Tx, so a_y / a_x = sqrt(2.36) ≈ 1.536.

So, a_y = 1.536 a_x.

Now, Vx = Mx a_x = 1.8 a_x.

Vy = My a_y = 1.31 * 1.536 a_x ≈ 2.021 a_x.

So, ΔV = Vy - Vx = (2.021 - 1.8) a_x = 0.221 a_x.

But I need to find a_x.

Wait, using the upstream speed of sound:

a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx) = sqrt(1.4 * R * 338.983).

But without knowing R, I can't compute a_x numerically. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can find the actual value of a_x using the upstream static temperature. Let me recall that for air, R is 1716 ft·lbf/(slug·°R), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed by expressing everything in terms of R and see if it cancels out.

Wait, another approach: Since both a_x and a_y are in terms of R, perhaps the R will cancel when calculating ΔV.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

Compute a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx) = sqrt(1.4 * R * 338.983)

Similarly, a_y = sqrt(1.4 * R * 800) = sqrt(1.4 R * 800).

So, a_x = sqrt(1.4 R * 338.983) ≈ sqrt(474.574 R)

a_y = sqrt(1.4 R * 800) = sqrt(1120 R) ≈ 33.466 sqrt(R)

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute a_x numerically.

But without R, I can't. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation between the velocities and the temperatures directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the change in velocity is ΔV = Vy - Vx = (My a_y) - (Mx a_x).

But since a_y = sqrt(Ty/(Tx)) * a_x, and we have Ty = 2.36 Tx, then a_y = sqrt(2.36) a_x ≈ 1.536 a_x.

So, ΔV = My * 1.536 a_x - 1.8 a_x = (My * 1.536 - 1.8) a_x.

But I need to find My, which I thought was approximately 1.31.

Wait, let's confirm My again.

The formula for My is:

My = [ (γ + 1) * Mx ] / [ (γ - 1) * Mx² + 2 ]

Plugging in the numbers:

(2.4 * 1.8) / (0.4 * (1.8)^2 + 2) = (4.32) / (0.4*3.24 + 2) = 4.32 / (1.296 + 2) = 4.32 / 3.296 ≈ 1.31.

So My ≈ 1.31.

So,

ΔV = (1.31 * 1.536 - 1.8) a_x.

Calculating 1.31 * 1.536 ≈ 2.021.

So, 2.021 - 1.8 = 0.221.

Thus, ΔV = 0.221 a_x.

But I still need a_x.

Wait, perhaps I can find a_x using the upstream temperature and the known R for air. Let me check: R for air is approximately 1716 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). But I'm not certain about the units here. Let's proceed.

So, a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx) = sqrt(1.4 * 1716 * 338.983).

Compute 1.4 * 1716 ≈ 2402.4.

Then, 2402.4 * 338.983 ≈ let me approximate that.

Well, 2400 * 340 ≈ 816,000.

But more accurately: 2402.4 * 338.983 ≈ let's compute 2400 * 338.983 ≈ 2400 * 339 ≈ 813,600, and 2.4 * 338.983 ≈ 813.56. So total ≈ 813,600 + 813.56 ≈ 814,413.56.

So a_x = sqrt(814,413.56) ≈ 902.45 ft/s.

Wait, that seems high, but let's proceed.

So, a_x ≈ 902.45 ft/s.

Then, ΔV = 0.221 * 902.45 ≈ 200.0 ft/s.

Wait, but that's about 200 ft/s. But looking at the options, the choices are much higher, like 880, 950, 1050, etc. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the relation for My or the temperature ratio.

Let me double-check the temperature ratio formula.

The correct formula for the temperature ratio across a normal shock is:

Ty / Tx = [ (γ + 1) * Mx² ] / [ (γ - 1) * Mx² + 2 ]

Yes, that's correct.

So plugging in Mx=1.8, γ=1.4:

(2.4 * 3.24) / (0.4 *3.24 +2) = 7.776 / (1.296 + 2) = 7.776 /3.296 ≈ 2.36. That's correct.

So Tx = Ty /2.36 ≈800 /2.36≈338.983°R. That's correct.

Now, the speed of sound a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx).

But wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for R. Let me confirm: For air, R is approximately 1716 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). But sometimes in some contexts, it's given as 53.353 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). Wait, but in the US system, specific gas constant R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). But since the units here are in slugs, perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, 1 slug is 32.174 lbm. So R in terms of slugs would be R = 53.35 * 32.174 ≈ 1716 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). So that's correct.

So, a_x = sqrt(1.4 * 1716 * 338.983).

Let me compute 1.4 *1716 = 2402.4.

Then, 2402.4 * 338.983 = let's compute that accurately.

Wait, 2402.4 * 300 = 720,720.

2402.4 * 38.983 ≈ 2402.4 *39 ≈ 93,693.6.

Adding them: 720,720 +93,693.6 ≈814,413.6.

So sqrt(814,413.6) ≈ 902.45 ft/s. That's correct.

So a_x ≈902.45 ft/s.

Now, ΔV =0.221 *902.45 ≈ 200 ft/s.

But the options are all in the hundreds, like 880, 950, 1050, etc. So I must have made a mistake in calculating ΔV.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of My.

Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the velocities directly using the temperatures and Mach numbers.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the downstream Mach number My can be found from:

My = [ (γ + 1) * Mx ] / [ (γ - 1) * Mx^2 + 2 ]

Which we did earlier, getting My≈1.31.

But perhaps I should use another relation for the velocity change.

Wait, another formula for the change in velocity across a normal shock is:

ΔV = Vx - Vy = ( (γ + 1)/(γ - 1) )^(1/2) * [ ( (γ - 1) Mx^2 ) / (1 + (γ - 1)/2 Mx^2 ) ]^(1/2) * a

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the actual velocities using the temperatures and Mach numbers.

Wait, Vx = Mx * a_x = 1.8 * 902.45 ≈ 1624.41 ft/s.

Now, to find Vy, I need My and a_y.

We have My≈1.31, and a_y = sqrt(γ R Ty) = sqrt(1.4 * 1716 * 800).

Compute 1.4 *1716 = 2402.4.

2402.4 *800 = 1,921,920.

a_y = sqrt(1,921,920) ≈ 1386 ft/s.

So Vy = My * a_y = 1.31 * 1386 ≈ 1820.26 ft/s.

Then, ΔV = Vy - Vx = 1820.26 - 1624.41 ≈ 195.85 ft/s.

Hmm, but that's still around 200 ft/s, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a second, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Maybe the velocity decreases across the shock. Because when a shock forms in a nozzle, the flow decelerates after the shock. So perhaps ΔV should be Vx - Vy, which would be negative, indicating a decrease.

Wait, but the question is asking how much the velocity has changed, so it's the absolute value. But in any case, I'm getting about 200 ft/s change, which isn't any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps I should use the stagnation temperatures or other relations. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the velocities and the temperatures more directly.

Wait, another formula I remember is:

Vx^2 = (2 γ/(γ + 1)) * Tx

Similarly, Vy^2 = (2 γ/(γ + 1)) * Ty

So,

Vx = sqrt( (2 γ/(γ + 1)) * Tx )

Vy = sqrt( (2 γ/(γ + 1)) * Ty )

So, the change in velocity ΔV = Vy - Vx.

But let's compute this.

First, compute (2 γ)/(γ + 1) = (2*1.4)/(2.4) = 2.8/2.4 ≈ 1.1667.

So,

Vx = sqrt(1.1667 * Tx )

Vy = sqrt(1.1667 * Ty )

We have Tx = 338.983°R and Ty=800°R.

So,

Vx = sqrt(1.1667 * 338.983) ≈ sqrt(395.65) ≈ 19.89 ft/s.

Vy = sqrt(1.1667 *800) ≈ sqrt(933.333) ≈ 30.55 ft/s.

ΔV = 30.55 -19.89 ≈10.66 ft/s.

Wait, that can't be right. That's way too low. I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, no, that formula gives the speed of sound, but perhaps I'm not using it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

a^2 = γ R T.

So, the speed of sound a = sqrt(γ R T).

Then, the velocity V = M * a.

So, Vx = Mx * sqrt(γ R Tx )

Vy = My * sqrt(γ R Ty )

So, the change in velocity is Vy - Vx = (My * sqrt(Ty) - Mx * sqrt(Tx )) * sqrt(γ R )

Because sqrt(γ R) is a common factor.

So,

ΔV = sqrt(γ R) [ My sqrt(Ty) - Mx sqrt(Tx) ]

But since Ty = 2.36 Tx,

ΔV = sqrt(γ R) [ My sqrt(2.36 Tx) - Mx sqrt(Tx) ]

= sqrt(γ R Tx) [ My sqrt(2.36) - Mx ]

Because sqrt(Tx) is common.

Now, sqrt(γ R Tx) is a_x.

So,

ΔV = a_x [ My sqrt(2.36) - Mx ]

We have My ≈1.31, sqrt(2.36)=1.536, Mx=1.8.

So,

ΔV = a_x [1.31 *1.536 -1.8 ].

Compute 1.31 *1.536 ≈ 2.021.

So,

2.021 -1.8 =0.221.

ΔV = a_x *0.221.

Now, a_x is sqrt(γ R Tx ) = sqrt(1.4 *1716 *338.983 ) ≈902.45 ft/s.

So,

ΔV ≈902.45 *0.221 ≈200 ft/s.

Again, same result. But the options are way higher. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating My. Let me double-check.

The formula for My is:

My = [ (γ +1) Mx ] / [ (γ -1) Mx² + 2 ]

Plugging in:

(2.4 *1.8) / (0.4*(1.8)^2 +2 ) =4.32/(0.4*3.24 +2 )=4.32/(1.296 +2)=4.32/3.296≈1.31.

That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula for My. Let me think again.

Alternative formula for My:

My = [ (γ +1) Mx ] / [ (γ -1) Mx² + 2 ]

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between the velocities and the temperatures more directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocities using the stagnation temperatures, but I think that's complicating things.

Wait, another approach: The velocity before the shock is Vx = Mx * a_x.

The velocity after the shock is Vy = My * a_y.

We can express a_x and a_y in terms of R and T.

But without knowing R, perhaps I can express the velocities in terms of the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I can write Vx = Mx * sqrt(γ R Tx )

Vy = My * sqrt(γ R Ty )

So, ΔV = Vy - Vx = sqrt(γ R) [ My sqrt(Ty) - Mx sqrt(Tx) ]

But since Ty =2.36 Tx,

ΔV = sqrt(γ R) [ My sqrt(2.36 Tx) - Mx sqrt(Tx) ]

= sqrt(γ R Tx ) [ My sqrt(2.36) - Mx ]

Because sqrt(Tx) is factored out.

So, ΔV = a_x [ My sqrt(2.36) - Mx ]

With My=1.31, sqrt(2.36)=1.536, Mx=1.8.

So,

ΔV = a_x (1.31 *1.536 -1.8) = a_x (2.021 -1.8)=a_x *0.221.

Again, same as before.

But a_x is about 902 ft/s, so 0.221 *902≈200 ft/s.

But the options don't have anything near 200. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute change, regardless of direction, so maybe it's |ΔV|=200 ft/s. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature ratio. Let me check again.

The temperature ratio across a normal shock is:

Ty / Tx = [ (γ +1) Mx² ] / [ (γ -1) Mx² +2 ]

With γ=1.4, Mx=1.8.

(γ+1)=2.4, (γ-1)=0.4.

So,

Ty / Tx = (2.4 *3.24) / (0.4 *3.24 +2 )=7.776/(1.296+2)=7.776/3.296≈2.36.

Yes, correct.

So Tx=800 /2.36≈338.983°R.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the relation between the velocities in terms of the stagnation temperatures, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the speed of sound after the shock is higher, leading to a higher velocity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity change. Let me think: When a shock forms in a nozzle, the flow decelerates after the shock, so Vy < Vx. So ΔV = Vy - Vx would be negative, meaning the velocity decreases. But the question is asking how much it has changed, so perhaps the magnitude is what's important. But in any case, I'm getting about 200 ft/s, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating My. Let me try a different approach to find My.

Another formula for My is:

1/My² = (γ +1)/(γ -1) * (1/Mx²) + 2/(γ +1)

So,

1/My² = (2.4/0.4)*(1/3.24) + 2/(2.4)

=6*(0.3086) + 0.8333

=1.8516 +0.8333≈2.6849

So My²=1/2.6849≈0.3723 → My≈0.61.

Wait, that can't be right because My should be greater than 1 if the flow is subsonic downstream. Wait, no, in a nozzle, after a shock, the flow becomes subsonic, so My <1.

Wait, that makes sense. So My≈0.61.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating My. Let me recalculate using this formula.

Compute 1/My²:

= (γ +1)/(γ -1) * (1/Mx²) + 2/(γ +1)

= (2.4/0.4) * (1/(1.8)^2) + 2/(2.4)

=6 * (1/3.24) + (0.8333)

6 *0.3086≈1.8516

1.8516 +0.8333≈2.6849.

So 1/My²=2.6849 → My²=1/2.6849≈0.3723 → My≈0.61.

So My≈0.61.

That's different from my earlier calculation. So My is about 0.61, not 1.31.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I used the wrong formula for My. The correct formula is the one involving 1/My², leading to My≈0.61.

So now, let's recalculate everything with My=0.61.

So,

a_x = sqrt(γ R Tx )= sqrt(1.4 *1716 *338.983 )≈902.45 ft/s.

a_y = sqrt(γ R Ty )= sqrt(1.4 *1716 *800 )≈ sqrt(1.4 *1,372,800 )= sqrt(1,921,920 )≈1386 ft/s.

Vx = Mx * a_x =1.8 *902.45≈1624.41 ft/s.

Vy = My * a_y =0.61 *1386≈846.06 ft/s.

So ΔV = Vy - Vx =846.06 -1624.41≈-778.35 ft/s.

The magnitude is about 778 ft/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J:880 ft/s, but that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let's recalculate a_y.

a_y = sqrt(1.4 *1716 *800 )

1.4 *1716=2402.4.

2402.4 *800=1,921,920.

sqrt(1,921,920)=1386 ft/s.

Vy=0.61 *1386≈846.06 ft/s.

Vx=1.8 *902.45≈1624.41.

ΔV=846.06-1624.41≈-778.35 ft/s.

So the change is about 778 ft/s. The options don't have this exact value, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for My.

Let me compute 1/My²=2.6849.

So My²=1/2.6849≈0.3723 → My≈sqrt(0.3723)=0.61.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute My more accurately.

1/My²=2.6849.

So My=1/sqrt(2.6849)=1/1.638≈0.61.

So My≈0.61.

Thus, Vy=0.61*1386≈846 ft/s.

So ΔV=846 -1624≈-778 ft/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J:880 ft/s, but that's 102 ft/s higher than my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a_x.

Wait, let me recompute a_x:

Tx=338.983°R.

a_x = sqrt(1.4 *1716 *338.983 )

Compute 1.4 *1716=2402.4.

2402.4 *338.983≈2402.4 *339≈814,413.6.

sqrt(814,413.6)=902.45 ft/s.

So that seems correct.

Hmm, so I'm getting a ΔV of approximately -778 ft/s, but the options don't have that. Did I make a mistake in the formula for My?

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the relation between the velocities and the temperatures without going through My.

We have:

Vx = sqrt( (2 γ)/(γ+1) * Tx ) = sqrt(2.8/2.4 *338.983 )=sqrt(1.1667 *338.983 )=sqrt(395.65)=19.89 ft/s.

Wait, that can't be right because that's way lower than the a_x I calculated earlier. I think I'm mixing up the formulas again.

Wait, no, that formula is for the speed of sound, but perhaps I'm confusing it with something else. Let me clarify.

The speed of sound a = sqrt(γ R T).

The velocity V = M * a.

So, Vx = Mx * a_x =1.8 *902.45≈1624.41 ft/s.

Ok, that's correct.

So, perhaps the correct ΔV is about 778 ft/s, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the relation between the stagnation temperatures, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the velocities and the pressure ratios, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the velocity change is much larger because I'm dealing with a supersonic flow. But I'm not seeing where the mistake is.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the velocities using the stagnation temperatures.

The stagnation temperature relation across a normal shock is:

T0y = T0x * [ ( (γ +1) Mx ) / (2 + (γ -1) Mx² ) ]^2

But I don't know the upstream stagnation temperature, so that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the stagnation temperature increases across a shock.

But without knowing the upstream stagnation temperature, I can't proceed that way.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can find the velocity change using the formula:

ΔV = Vx - Vy = ( (2 γ Mx ) / (γ +1) ) * a_x

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the velocities and the temperatures more directly.

Wait, another approach: The velocity change can be found using the formula:

ΔV = Vx - Vy = (2 γ Mx^2 )/(γ +1) * a_x

But I'm not sure about this formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the energy equation, but that might be too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the kinetic energy changes, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The closest to my calculated ΔV of 778 ft/s is option J:880 ft/s, but that's still a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the My calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate My using the correct formula.

The correct formula is:

1/My² = ( (γ +1)/(γ -1) ) * (1/Mx²) + 2/(γ +1)

Plugging in the numbers:

(2.4/0.4) * (1/3.24) + 2/2.4 =6*(0.3086) +0.8333≈1.8516+0.8333≈2.6849.

So 1/My²=2.6849 → My²=0.3723 → My≈0.61.

So Vy=0.61 *1386≈846 ft/s.

Vx=1.8 *902≈1624 ft/s.

ΔV=846-1624= -778 ft/s.

So the magnitude is 778 ft/s. Since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating a_y.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate a_y.

a_y = sqrt(γ R Ty )= sqrt(1.4 *1716 *800 )

1.4 *1716=2402.4.

2402.4 *800=1,921,920.

sqrt(1,921,920)=1386 ft/s.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the velocity change is Vx - Vy, which would be 1624 -846=778 ft/s. So the change is 778 ft/s, but the options don't have this. The closest higher option is J:880 ft/s, but that's 102 ft/s higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a_x.

Wait, let me recalculate a_x.

Tx=338.983°R.

a_x = sqrt(1.4 *1716 *338.983 )

1.4 *1716=2402.4.

2402.4 *338.983= let me compute more accurately.

338.983 *2402.4:

338.983 *2000=677,966.

338.983 *400=135,593.2.

338.983 *2.4=813.56.

Adding them: 677,966 +135,593.2=813,559.2 +813.56=814,372.76.

So a_x= sqrt(814,372.76)= approx 902.42 ft/s.

So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D:1160 ft/s or E:1050 ft/s, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity change.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute change, so the magnitude is 778 ft/s, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the velocity increases, but that's not the case in a nozzle with a shock.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and I should use a different formula. Let me try to find another approach.

I found a formula online (though I can't access it right now) that the change in velocity across a normal shock can be found using:

ΔV = (2 γ Mx)/(γ +1) * a_x

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between the pressure and velocity changes, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the velocity after the shock is subsonic, so My <1, and use that to find the velocity change.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is option D:1160 ft/s, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier and the correct answer is option G:1100 ft/s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity change using the formula:

ΔV = Vx - Vy = Mx a_x - My a_y.

We have a_x=902.45, a_y=1386, Mx=1.8, My=0.61.

So,

ΔV=1.8*902.45 -0.61*1386≈1624.41 -846.06≈778.35 ft/s.

So the change is approximately 778 ft/s. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the velocity change is in the opposite direction, so the change is Vy - Vx = -778 ft/s, but the magnitude is 778. Still, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, such as using the stagnation temperatures or other relations, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option D:1160 ft/s, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and the correct answer is option G:1100 ft/s.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the velocities in terms of the temperatures without using My.

Vx = Mx * sqrt(γ R Tx ) =1.8 *902.45≈1624.41.

Vy = My * sqrt(γ R Ty )=0.61 *1386≈846.06.

ΔV=1624.41-846.06≈778.35.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the velocity change as Vx - Vy, which is 778.35 ft/s, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of My.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use another formula for My.

Wait, another formula for My is:

My = [ (γ +1) Mx ] / [ (γ -1) Mx² + 2 ]

Which gave My≈1.31 earlier, but that led to a higher ΔV.

Wait, perhaps I should use that approach again.

So My≈1.31.

Then,

a_y = sqrt(γ R Ty )=1386 ft/s.

Vy=1.31 *1386≈1820.26 ft/s.

Vx=1.8 *902.45≈1624.41.

ΔV=1820.26 -1624.41≈195.85 ft/s.

But that's still not matching any options.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think I should go with the initial approach where My≈0.61, leading to a ΔV of about 778 ft/s, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J:880 ft/s.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option D:1160 ft/s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using My≈1.31 and a_x=902.45.

Vy=1.31 *1386≈1820.26.

Vx=1.8 *902.45≈1624.41.

ΔV=1820.26 -1624.41≈195.85 ft/s.

No, that's too low.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

ΔV = (My a_y ) - (Mx a_x )

= My * sqrt(γ R Ty ) - Mx * sqrt(γ R Tx )

= sqrt(γ R ) [ My sqrt(Ty ) - Mx sqrt(Tx ) ]

= sqrt(γ R ) [ My sqrt(2.36 Tx ) - Mx sqrt(Tx ) ]

= sqrt(γ R Tx ) [ My sqrt(2.36) - Mx ]

= a_x [ My sqrt(2.36) - Mx ]

With My=0.61:

=902.45 [0.61 *1.536 -1.8 ]≈902.45 [0.937 -1.8 ]=902.45*(-0.863)= -778.35 ft/s.

So, the magnitude is 778 ft/s.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the velocity change is given by:

ΔV = Vx - Vy = Mx a_x - My a_y.

But using My=0.61, a_y=1386:

ΔV=1.8*902.45 -0.61*1386≈1624.41 -846.06≈778.35 ft/s.

So, the answer should be approximately 778 ft/s. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option J:880 ft/s, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of My.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

My = [ (γ +1) Mx ] / [ (γ -1) Mx² + 2 ]

Which gave My≈1.31.

But that led to a ΔV of about 195 ft/s, which doesn't match.

I'm really stuck here. Given the options, I think the intended answer is option D:1160 ft/s, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G:1100 ft/s.

But without further progress, I'll have to make an educated guess. Given the calculations, the closest I got was 778 ft/s, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the velocity change is larger, and the correct answer is option D:1160 ft/s.

To determine the change in velocity across the shock, we analyze the given data: upstream Mach number \( M_x = 1.8 \), downstream static temperature \( T_y = 800^\circ \text{R} \), and \( \gamma = 1.4 \). The goal is to calculate \( \Delta V = V_y - V_x \), where \( V_x \) and \( V_y \) are the velocities upstream and downstream of the shock, respectively.

### Key Steps:
1. **Temperature Ratio Across the Shock**:
   Using the normal shock temperature relation:
   \[
   \frac{T_y}{T_x} = \frac{(\gamma + 1) M_x^2}{(\gamma - 1) M_x^2 + 2}
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1.4 \) and \( M_x = 1.8 \):
   \[
   \frac{T_y}{T_x} = \frac{2.4 \cdot 3.24}{0.4 \cdot 3.24 + 2} = \frac{7.776}{3.296} \approx 2.36
   \]
   Thus, \( T_x = \frac{T_y}{2.36} \approx \frac{800}{2.36} \approx 338.983^\circ \text{R} \).

2. **Speed of Sound**:
   The speed of sound is given by \( a = \sqrt{\gamma R T} \). Using \( R = 1716 \, \text{ft·lbf/(slug·°R)} \):
   \[
   a_x = \sqrt{1.4 \cdot 1716 \cdot 338.983} \approx 902.45 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]
   \[
   a_y = \sqrt{1.4 \cdot 1716 \cdot 800} \approx 1386 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]

3. **Downstream Mach Number \( M_y \)**:
   Using the normal shock Mach number relation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{M_y^2} = \frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1} \cdot \frac{1}{M_x^2} + \frac{2}{\gamma + 1}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{M_y^2} = \frac{2.4}{0.4} \cdot \frac{1}{3.24} + \frac{2}{2.4} = 6 \cdot 0.3086 + 0.8333 \approx 2.6849
   \]
   \[
   M_y^2 = \frac{1}{2.6849} \approx 0.3723 \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_y \approx 0.61
   \]

4. **Velocities**:
   Using \( V = M \cdot a \):
   \[
   V_x = M_x \cdot a_x = 1.8 \cdot 902.45 \approx 1624.41 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]
   \[
   V_y = M_y \cdot a_y = 0.61 \cdot 1386 \approx 846.06 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]

5. **Change in Velocity**:
   \[
   \Delta V = V_y - V_x = 846.06 - 1624.41 \approx -778.35 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]
   The magnitude of the velocity change is approximately \( 778 \, \text{ft/s} \).

### Conclusion:
The calculated velocity change is approximately \( 778 \, \text{ft/s} \), but this value does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **J: 880 ft/s**, which is likely the intended answer despite the discrepancy.
