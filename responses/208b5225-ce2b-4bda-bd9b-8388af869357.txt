Okay, so I have this question about Lukianoff and Haidt's argument regarding American colleges and universities. The question is asking what they argue that these institutions now encourage. The options are A: emotional reasoning, B: critical reasoning, C: reflective reasoning, and D: all of the above.

Hmm, I remember that Lukianoff and Haidt have written about the state of higher education, particularly about the challenges students face with regard to free speech and ideological polarization. I think their work touches on how campuses have become more politically charged, possibly affecting the way students engage in discussions.

Wait, I'm trying to recall if they discussed reasoning styles. I think they might have talked about the shift from encouraging open discussion and critical thinking to something else. Maybe they argue that colleges now encourage more emotional reasoning rather than the more traditional critical reasoning. Emotional reasoning would involve decisions and arguments based on feelings rather than logic.

So, if that's the case, then the answer might be A: emotional reasoning. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Critical reasoning is about analyzing arguments logically, which has always been a staple in higher education. If they argue that colleges are moving away from this, then perhaps they're encouraging something else, like emotional reasoning.

I don't recall them mentioning reflective reasoning specifically, so maybe C isn't the right choice. So, if it's either A or B, and considering that I think they focus on the emotional aspect, I would lean towards A. But wait, maybe the question is reversed. Do they argue that colleges encourage more critical reasoning now, or less? Or perhaps it's a shift towards more emotional reasoning.

Wait, another angle: I think in their book "The Coddling of the American Mind," Lukianoff and Haidt discuss how universities have become more focused on emotional safety, which might lead to encouraging emotional reasoning over critical reasoning. So, they might argue that colleges now encourage emotional reasoning, making A the correct answer.

The answer is A: emotional reasoning. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that American colleges and universities now encourage emotional reasoning over critical reasoning, as discussed in their work on the challenges facing higher education.
