Okay, so I need to figure out which explanation best illustrates Kohlberg's conventional level of morality for why a 17-year-old drives at or below the speed limit. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should remember what Kohlberg's stages of morality are. Kohlberg proposed that moral development occurs in three levels, each containing two stages. The conventional level, which is the second level, is where people start to internalize societal norms and laws because they're seen as good or to maintain social order.

So, the conventional level includes two stages: the good-interiorized stage and the law-and-order stage. In the good-interiorized stage, individuals follow rules because they believe it's the right thing to do and because it aligns with their perception of how a good person should behave. In the law-and-order stage, they follow rules because they respect authority and the law, believing that laws are there to maintain social order and that breaking them could lead to problems for everyone.

Now, looking at the options, I need to determine which one reflects a conventional level response. Let's go through each option:

A: "I don't want to waste gas." - This seems more about personal economics or practicality. It doesn't necessarily relate to morality based on societal norms.

B: "I'm not in a rush." - This is about personal convenience or time management, not a moral reasoning.

C: "I want to impress my friends." - This is about social approval but might be more related to seeking peer approval rather than internalizing societal norms.

D: "I find it relaxing to drive slowly." - Personal preference, not a moral stance.

E: "It's the law." - This is about obeying laws, which fits the law-and-order stage within the conventional level. The reasoning here is that laws are in place for everyone's good, so following them is the right thing to do.

F: "I want my parents to approve of my driving." - This is about seeking parental approval, which might be part of the good-interiorized stage but could also be more about personal gain rather than societal norms.

G: "I don't want to get any tickets." - Avoiding punishment is more about external consequences rather than internalizing the moral value of the law.

H: "I don't want to crash my car." - Safety concern, a personal reason, not necessarily moral based on societal norms.

I: "I'm afraid of going fast." - Personal fear, not a moral consideration.

J: "I want to be a good example for my younger siblings." - This is about setting a moral example, which could be part of the good-interiorized stage as it's about being a good person and role model.

Now, between E and J. E is about the law, which is more about the law-and-order stage, while J is about being a good example, which is more about the good-interiorized stage. Both are part of the conventional level.

But the question is asking for the best illustration of the conventional level. So, E is about following the law because it's the right thing to do for society's order, while J is about personal moral behavior to be a good person.

Wait, but Kohlberg's conventional level includes both stages. So, both E and J are correct in a way, but the question is about which explanation best illustrates it. The conventional level is about internalizing societal norms, so E is about the law, which is a societal norm, and J is about being a good person, which is also societal but more about personal behavior.

Hmm. The conventional level is about understanding the law and social order. So E might be more directly about the law, which is part of the conventional level. J is more about personal moral behavior, which is also conventional but perhaps more in the good-interiorized stage. 

Wait, but the question is about why he drives at the speed limit. The reason has to be because he's following the law as a societal norm. So E is the best answer because it's about obeying the law, which is a societal norm, fitting the conventional level.

The explanation that best illustrates Kohlberg's conventional level of morality is "It's the law." This reflects an understanding of societal norms and the belief that laws are in place for the greater good, fitting the law-and-order stage within the conventional level.

Answer: E
