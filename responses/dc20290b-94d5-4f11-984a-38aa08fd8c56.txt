Okay, so I've got this economics question here about comparative and absolute advantage. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which option is NOT correct, so I need to figure out which one doesn't fit the theories I remember.

Alright, the setup is that there are only two goods, x and y. The options are about whether a country can have certain combinations of absolute and comparative advantages.

First, let me recall what absolute and comparative advantage mean. Absolute advantage is when a country can produce more of a good with the same resources compared to another country. Comparative advantage is about specializing in the production of a good where you have a lower opportunity cost.

The question is about which of the options is incorrect. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: One can have comparative advantage in producing both goods. Hmm, I remember that comparative advantage arises from differences in opportunity costs. But if two countries have the same opportunity costs for both goods, they wouldn't have a comparative advantage in either. But if their opportunity costs are different, each can have a comparative advantage in one good. Wait, can a country have a comparative advantage in both? I think that's possible if their production possibilities are such that they have lower opportunity costs in both, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll come back to this.

Option B: One can have both an absolute advantage and a comparative advantage in x. I think this is possible. For example, if Country A is more efficient at producing x and y than Country B, it has an absolute advantage. But depending on the slope of their PPCs, A might also have a comparative advantage in x. So B seems correct.

Option C: One can have absolute advantage and no comparative advantage in producing x. Is this possible? Let me think. If a country has an absolute advantage in x, it means it can produce more x with the same resources. But comparative advantage depends on opportunity costs. Suppose Country A can produce more x and y than Country B. If A's opportunity cost of producing x is higher than B's, then B would have a comparative advantage in x. But wait, can A have absolute advantage but no comparative advantage in x? I think yes. Because even though A is better at producing x, if producing x costs A more in terms of y, then B might have a lower opportunity cost for x, giving B the comparative advantage. So A has absolute advantage in x but no comparative advantage in it. So C is correct.

Option D: One can have comparative advantage and no absolute advantage in producing x. This makes sense. Comparative advantage doesn't require having an absolute advantage. For example, Country B might have a lower opportunity cost in producing y, so it has a comparative advantage in y, even if Country A can produce more y. So D is correct.

Now, back to Option A. Can a country have a comparative advantage in both goods? I'm a bit confused. I think that in the case of two goods, each country typically has a comparative advantage in one good. If both countries have the same opportunity costs for both goods, then there's no basis for trade. But if their opportunity costs differ, each will specialize in the good where they have a lower opportunity cost. So if someone says they can have a comparative advantage in both, that might not be possible because that would imply that for both goods, their opportunity cost is lower than the other's, which might not be possible unless their PPCs are such that they have different slopes. Wait, actually, in the case of two goods, each country can have a comparative advantage in one good but not both. Because if Country A has a lower opportunity cost in x, then Country B must have a lower opportunity cost in y. So A can't have a comparative advantage in both; that's not possible. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.

So the question is which option is NOT correct. A says one can have comparative advantage in both, which is not possible. Therefore, the answer should be A.

The question asks which option is NOT correct regarding comparative and absolute advantages in producing two goods, x and y. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: States that one can have a comparative advantage in both goods. However, in the case of two goods, each country typically has a comparative advantage in only one good. If one country has a lower opportunity cost for producing x, the other must have a lower opportunity cost for y. Therefore, it is not possible for a country to have a comparative advantage in both goods. This makes Option A incorrect.

- **Option B**: States that one can have both an absolute advantage and a comparative advantage in x. This is possible if a country is more efficient in producing x and y (absolute advantage) and also has a lower opportunity cost for x (comparative advantage). Thus, Option B is correct.

- **Option C**: States that one can have an absolute advantage and no comparative advantage in producing x. This is possible if a country has an absolute advantage in x but a higher opportunity cost for x compared to another country, giving the other country a comparative advantage in x. Therefore, Option C is correct.

- **Option D**: States that one can have a comparative advantage and no absolute advantage in producing x. This is possible if a country has a lower opportunity cost for producing x, giving it a comparative advantage, even if it does not have an absolute advantage in x. Thus, Option D is correct.

The option that is NOT correct is **A**, as it is not possible for a country to have a comparative advantage in both goods when there are only two goods.
