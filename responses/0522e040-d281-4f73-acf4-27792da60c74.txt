Okay, so I have this question about executive orders, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that executive orders are directives from the President that have the force of law. They don't go through Congress, right? So, looking at the options, let's go one by one.

Option A says that presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I think sometimes presidents do use executive orders for controversial things because it's a way to bypass Congress. Like, if they can't get something passed through legislation, they might issue an order instead. So maybe A is false because they actually do use them for controversial stuff.

Option B claims that executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress. I think this is true because both have the force of law. So B is true, meaning it's not the correct answer.

Option C states that presidents have increased their use of executive orders since the 1970s. I've heard that presidents, especially more recent ones, have used executive orders more often. So C is true, not the answer.

Option D says executive orders bypass congressional approval. That sounds correct because by definition, executive orders are unilateral actions by the President without needing Congress to pass a law. So D is true.

So putting it together, the incorrect statement is A because presidents do use executive orders for controversial actions. Therefore, the answer should be A.
