Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a clock pendulum losing time due to temperature changes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the problem says the clock is controlled by a pendulum that correctly beats seconds at 20°C. The pendulum is a light iron rod with a coefficient of linear expansion of 16×10^-6 per degree Celsius. There's a concentrated mass at one end. So, the question is, how many seconds does it lose in a week if the temperature is kept at 30°C?

Wait, so the temperature increases from 20 to 30°C, which is a 10-degree increase. Since the pendulum is made of iron, it will expand. But wait, how does the expansion affect the pendulum's period?

Right, the period of a pendulum is given by T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length and g is the acceleration due to gravity. So, if the length L changes due to thermal expansion, the period will change too.

The formula for linear expansion is ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT, where α is the coefficient of linear expansion, L0 is the original length, and ΔT is the change in temperature. So, the new length L = L0 + ΔL = L0 (1 + α ΔT).

Now, since the period depends on the square root of the length, the change in period ΔT will be approximately proportional to (ΔL)/(2L0) because T is proportional to sqrt(L). So, ΔT ≈ T0 * (ΔL)/(2L0) = T0 * α ΔT / 2.

Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing up some terms here. Let me think again. The original period is T0 = 2π√(L0/g). The new period T will be T = 2π√(L/g) = T0 * sqrt( (L0 + ΔL)/L0 ) ≈ T0 * (1 + (ΔL)/(2L0)) ), using the binomial approximation for small changes.

So, the change in period ΔT is T - T0 ≈ T0 * (ΔL)/(2L0) = T0 * α ΔT / 2.

But wait, since ΔT is the temperature change, which is 10°C, and α is 16e-6 per degree. So, substituting that in, we can find the change in period.

But wait, the pendulum is designed to beat seconds correctly at 20°C. That means at 20°C, the period T0 is exactly 1 second because each second is one beat. So, T0 = 1 s.

So, ΔT (change in period) = T0 * (α * ΔT) / 2. Plugging in the numbers: α is 16e-6 per °C, ΔT is 10°C, so:

ΔT = 1 s * (16e-6 * 10) / 2 = 1 * (160e-6) / 2 = 1 * 80e-6 = 8e-5 seconds per beat.

Wait, that seems really small. Each beat is 1 second, so if the period increases by 8e-5 seconds, the pendulum is actually taking a bit longer to complete each oscillation. So, each second, it's losing 8e-5 seconds? Wait, no, because if the period increases, the clock runs slower. So, each period is longer, so the clock will lose time over time.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm getting this right. The period increases, so each cycle takes longer. So, if the clock is supposed to beat a second each cycle, but each cycle is now longer, the clock will tick less frequently, making it lose time.

So, over a certain time, say T_total, how much time does it lose? Let's think: if the correct period is 1 second, but the actual period is T = T0 (1 + (α ΔT)/2) ≈ 1 + (α ΔT)/2. So, each oscillation takes longer by α ΔT / 2.

But wait, when the pendulum is longer, the period is longer, so each beat occurs later. So, in a real second, the clock will only have completed a fraction of a beat. So, the clock will run slow.

Wait, perhaps another approach: if the pendulum's period increases, the clock will take more real time to complete each beat, so in a real week, the clock will have fewer beats than it should, thus losing time.

So, to find out how much time is lost in a week, let's calculate how many beats the clock should make in a week and how many it actually makes due to the longer period.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of how much the period changes and then how much time is lost per beat, and then accumulate that over a week.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the fractional change in the period and then find the corresponding time lost.

Wait, let me try this again. The period increases by ΔT = α ΔT * L0 / (2L0) * T0. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express the fractional change in the period.

The fractional change in period is (ΔT / T0) ≈ (α ΔT) / 2.

So, since T0 is 1 second, ΔT is (16e-6 *10)/2 = 8e-5 seconds. So, each period is longer by 8e-5 seconds.

So, in each period, the clock is taking an extra 8e-5 seconds. So, over time, the clock will fall behind.

But how to find the total time lost in a week?

Wait, perhaps the clock is supposed to tick every 1 second, but each tick now takes longer. So, in real time t, the number of ticks N is t / T, where T is the new period. So, the time measured by the clock would be N * 1 second, but the actual time is t.

So, the difference is t - N *1 = t - (t / T) *1 = t (1 - 1/T) = t ( (T -1)/T ). But since T is close to 1, we can approximate (T -1) ≈ ΔT, so the time lost would be approximately t * (ΔT / 1) = t * ΔT.

Wait, perhaps that's a quicker way. Because if the period increases by ΔT, then for each real second, the clock only advances by (1 - ΔT) seconds. So, the time lost per real second is ΔT seconds.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently. Suppose the actual period is T = 1 + δ, where δ is the change in period. So, δ = 8e-5 s.

In one real second, how many beats does the clock make? Well, the period is T, so the number of beats per second is 1/T. So, in one real second, the clock beats 1/T times, which is approximately 1 - δ, using the approximation 1/(1+δ) ≈ 1 - δ for small δ.

So, the clock loses δ seconds per real second. So, over a week, which is 7 days, each day having 86400 seconds, so total real time is 7*86400 seconds.

So, the total time lost would be δ * total_real_time.

So, δ = 8e-5 s, total_real_time = 7 * 86400 = 604800 s.

So, time lost = 8e-5 s * 604800 s.

Let me compute that: 8e-5 * 604800 = 8 * 604800 * 1e-5.

Calculate 604800 * 8 = 4,838,400.

Then, 4,838,400 * 1e-5 = 48.384 s.

Hmm, so approximately 48.4 seconds lost in a week. Looking at the options, option H is 48.4 s. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The coefficient of linear expansion α is 16e-6 per °C.

2. The temperature change ΔT is 30-20 =10°C.

3. The change in length ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT = 16e-6 * L0 *10 = 160e-6 L0.

4. The period T is proportional to sqrt(L), so the fractional change in T is approximately (ΔL)/(2 L0) ) = (160e-6 L0)/(2 L0) ) = 80e-6 = 8e-5.

5. So, each period increases by 8e-5 seconds. So, the period becomes 1 + 8e-5 seconds.

6. The clock runs slow because each beat takes longer. So, in real time t, the number of beats is t / (1 + 8e-5) ≈ t (1 - 8e-5) using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x for small x.

7. So, the clock loses (8e-5) * t seconds every t seconds.

8. Over a week, t = 7*24*3600 = 604800 seconds.

9. Time lost = 8e-5 * 604800 = (8 * 604800) * 1e-5 = 4,838,400 * 1e-5 = 48.384 s ≈48.4 s.

Yes, that matches option H.
</think>

The clock's pendulum loses time due to thermal expansion. The pendulum's length increases with temperature, which increases its period. The fractional change in the period is approximately half the fractional change in length. With a temperature rise of 10°C, the period increases by 8e-5 seconds per beat. Over a week (604,800 seconds), the total time lost is 48.4 seconds.
