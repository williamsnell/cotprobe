Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the voltage of a cell. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the standard voltage E° is 1.1 volts. The setup is a cell where the copper half-cell is at standard conditions, but the zinc ion concentration is only 0.001 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the reaction is Zn + Cu²+ → Cu + Zn²+. 

Wait, I remember that the overall cell voltage can be found using the Nernst equation. The formula is E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q), but since temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I can probably use 2.303RT/F as 0.0592 V, so the equation simplifies to E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q).

First, I need to figure out the cell reaction and which way the electrons are flowing. The given reaction is Zn being oxidized to Zn²+ and Cu²+ being reduced to Cu. So in this cell, zinc is the anode (oxidation) and copper is the cathode (reduction). 

The standard cell potential E° is given as 1.1 V. But since the concentration of zinc ions isn't standard (it's 0.001 M instead of 1 M), the cell potential will change.

The Nernst equation depends on the reaction quotient Q. For this reaction, the cell reaction is:

Zn(s) → Zn²+(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation, anode)
Cu²+(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (reduction, cathode)
Overall: Zn + Cu²+ → Cu + Zn²+

The reaction quotient Q is [Zn²+]/[Cu²+]. Wait, but wait—because in the cell notation, the anode is on the left and cathode on the right. So the cell notation would be Zn | Zn²+ || Cu²+ | Cu. 

In the Nernst equation, Q is products over reactants. So for the reaction, the products are Cu(s) and Zn²+, and the reactants are Zn(s) and Cu²+. But solids don't affect Q because their concentration is 1. So Q = [Zn²+]/[Cu²+].

Wait, but in the problem, the concentration of Zn²+ is 0.001 M, and the copper is at standard conditions, so [Cu²+] is 1 M. So Q = 0.001 / 1 = 0.001.

The number of electrons transferred (n) in the reaction is 2, since each Zn gives two electrons and each Cu²+ accepts two.

Putting it all together, the Nernst equation becomes E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). Plugging in the numbers: E = 1.1 - (0.0592/2) * log(0.001).

Wait, log(0.001) is log(1e-3) which is -3. So:

E = 1.1 - (0.0296) * (-3)
E = 1.1 + (0.0296 * 3)
0.0296 *3 is 0.0888.

So E = 1.1 + 0.0888 = 1.1888 volts. That's approximately 1.19 volts.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.19 volts. So the answer should be C.

The voltage of the cell is calculated using the Nernst equation: 

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q
\]

Given:
- \( E^\circ = 1.1 \, \text{V} \)
- \( n = 2 \) (number of electrons transferred)
- \( [\text{Zn}^{2+}] = 0.001 \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{Cu}^{2+}] = 1 \, \text{M} \) (standard conditions for copper)

The reaction quotient \( Q \) is:

\[
Q = \frac{[\text{Zn}^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]} = \frac{0.001}{1} = 0.001
\]

Substituting into the Nernst equation:

\[
E = 1.1 - \frac{0.0592}{2} \log(0.001)
\]

\[
\log(0.001) = -3
\]

\[
E = 1.1 - \frac{0.0592}{2} (-3) = 1.1 + 0.0888 = 1.1888 \, \text{V}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( E \approx 1.19 \, \text{V} \).
