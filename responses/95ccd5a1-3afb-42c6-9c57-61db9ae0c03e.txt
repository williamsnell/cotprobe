Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

Alright, the problem says that a fluid with a flow rate of 5 lbm/sec passes through a pipe where heat is transferred at 50 Btu/sec. I need to find out how much work can be done by this system. The given data includes the velocity, enthalpy, and height at both the entrance and exit, as well as the specific volume of the fluid. Also, I need to find the area of the inlet.

First, I remember that in thermodynamics, the first law applies here, which for a control volume is often expressed as the energy balance equation. The general form is:

ΔH + ΔKE + ΔPE = Q - W

Where ΔH is the change in enthalpy, ΔKE is the change in kinetic energy, ΔPE is the change in potential energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system.

Wait, but wait. I think I got that sign wrong. Let me think. In the energy equation, the general form is:

m*(h1 + (v1²)/2 + gz1) + Q = m*(h2 + (v2²)/2 + gz2) + W

Where m is mass flow rate, h is specific enthalpy, v is velocity, g is gravity, z is height, Q is heat added, and W is work done by the system.

Alternatively, rearranged, it's:

W = m*(h1 + (v1²)/2 + gz1 - h2 - (v2²)/2 - gz2) + Q

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get the correct form. The energy balance equation for a steady flow system (control volume) is:

Q - W = m [ (h2 - h1) + (v2² - v1²)/2 + g(z2 - z1) ]

So, rearranged:

W = Q - m [ (h2 - h1) + (v2² - v1²)/2 + g(z2 - z1) ]

Wait, but I think I should double-check the signs. The first law for a control volume is:

Energy in = Energy out + Accumulation

But since it's steady flow, accumulation is zero. So,

Q (heat in) + H_in (enthalpy in) + KE_in + PE_in = W (work out) + H_out + KE_out + PE_out

So,

Q + m [ h1 + (v1²)/2 + g z1 ] = W + m [ h2 + (v2²)/2 + g z2 ]

Rearranging,

W = Q + m [ h1 + (v1²)/2 + g z1 - h2 - (v2²)/2 - g z2 ]

Wait, but the problem says that heat is transferred at 50 Btu/sec. I'm not sure if it's entering or leaving. The problem states "heat is transferred at the rate of 50 Btu/sec." Typically, if it's a heat transfer to the system, it's positive. So Q is +50 Btu/sec.

Now, let me plug in the values.

Given:

m_dot = 5 lbm/sec

h1 = 1000 Btu/lbm

h2 = 1020 Btu/lbm

v1 = 100 ft/sec

v2 = 50 ft/sec

z1 = 100 ft

z2 = 0 ft

g = 32.2 ft/sec² (I think that's the standard value)

So, let's compute each term.

First, compute the changes in enthalpy, KE, and PE.

Δh = h2 - h1 = 1020 - 1000 = 20 Btu/lbm

So, m_dot * Δh = 5 * 20 = 100 Btu/sec

Next, the kinetic energy change:

ΔKE = (v2² - v1²)/2

v1² = 100^2 = 10,000 (ft²/sec²)

v2^2 = 50^2 = 2500

ΔKE = (2500 - 10,000)/2 = (-7500)/2 = -3750 ft²/sec²

But since we're dealing with energy per unit mass, and then multiplied by m_dot, let's compute it in Btu.

Wait, but I need to convert the kinetic energy from (ft²/s²) to Btu/lbm.

I remember that 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, and 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s² (from F=ma).

So, 1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf s²)/(lbm) )? Hmm, perhaps better to compute the KE in ft·lbf and then convert to Btu.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the KE term in Btu per lbm.

So, KE per lbm at entrance: (v1²)/2 = (100^2)/2 = 5000 ft²/s²

Similarly, KE per lbm at exit: (50^2)/2 = 1250 ft²/s²

ΔKE per lbm: 1250 - 5000 = -3750 ft²/s²

Now, to convert ft²/s² to Btu/lbm. Since 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, and 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s², so 1 ft²/s² equals (1 ft·lbf) / (32.2 lbm).

Wait, let me think. Let me use the conversion factor.

1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf

So, 1 ft·lbf = 1/778 Btu.

And 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s² → 1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf)/(32.2 lbm)

So, 1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf)/(32.2 lbm) = (1/778) Btu / (32.2 lbm) ) → because 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s².

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute:

1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf s²) / (32.2 lbm·ft/s²) ) → Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, since 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, and 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s² → so 1 ft·lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft²/s².

Wait, perhaps another approach: The kinetic energy term (v^2/2) in ft²/s² can be converted to Btu/lbm using the relation.

So, 1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf)/(32.2 lbm) → because F = ma → a = F/m → F = m*a, so a in ft/s² is F (lbf) / m (lbm) * (1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s²) → So, a = (F * 32.2) / m → so F = a * m / 32.2.

Wait, maybe better to find how much energy is in KE per lbm.

KE per lbm is (v^2)/2 in ft²/s².

So, (v^2)/2 = 100^2/2 = 5000 ft²/s².

But to get this in Btu/lbm:

We know that 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf.

And 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s² → so 1 ft·lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft²/s².

So, 1 ft²/s² = (1 ft·lbf) / 32.2 lbm.

So, (v^2)/2 = 5000 ft²/s² = 5000 * (1 ft·lbf / 32.2 lbm) = 5000 / 32.2 ft·lbf/lbm.

Then, converting ft·lbf to Btu: 1 ft·lbf = 1/778 Btu.

So, 5000 / 32.2 ft·lbf/lbm = (5000 / 32.2) * (1/778) Btu/lbm.

Let me compute that:

5000 / 32.2 ≈ 155.28 ft·lbf/lbm.

Then, 155.28 * (1/778) ≈ 0.199 Btu/lbm.

Similarly, for v2 =50 ft/s, KE is (50^2)/2 = 1250 ft²/s².

1250 /32.2 ≈ 38.82 ft·lbf/lbm.

38.82 * (1/778) ≈ 0.05 Btu/lbm.

So, ΔKE per lbm = 0.05 - 0.199 ≈ -0.149 Btu/lbm.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the change in KE as:

ΔKE per lbm = (v2² - v1²)/(2*2*32.2*778) ) → Wait, perhaps another way.

Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor for KE:

1 ft²/s² = 1/(2*32.2) slug·ft/s²? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the specific energy conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy change in Btu per lbm.

ΔKE = (v2² - v1²)/(2*c), where c is the conversion factor to Btu.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the total KE change for the mass flow and then convert to Btu.

So, the kinetic energy change per second (power) is:

ΔKE_dot = (m_dot) * [(v2² - v1²)/2 ]

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔKE_dot = 5 lbm/s * [(50^2 - 100^2)/2 ] (ft²/s²)

=5 * [ (2500 - 10000) / 2 ] 

=5 * (-7500/2) =5 * (-3750) = -18,750 ft²/s² · lbm/s.

Hmm, but I need to convert this to Btu/s.

We know that 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, and 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s².

So, 1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf)/(32.2 lbm) → because F=ma → a = F/m → F = m*a → a in ft/s² is F (lbf) / m (lbm) * (1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s²). So, a = F/(m) → F = a * m → but perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, let's compute the KE in ft·lbf per second.

So, KE is (1/2) m v².

Here, m is in lbm, v in ft/s. So,

(1/2) * m_dot * v1² = 0.5 *5 * 100^2 = 0.5 *5 *10,000 = 25,000 ft·lbm/s².

Wait, but that's not correct because the units would be (lbm)·(ft²/s²), which is ft·lbf (since 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s² → 1 ft²/s² = 1 lbf/(32.2 lbm)).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy.

The kinetic energy term (1/2 m v²) for the mass flow rate is:

KE_dot = 0.5 * m_dot * v1² = 0.5 *5 *100^2 = 0.5 *5 *10,000 = 25,000 lbm·ft²/s².

But 1 lbm·ft²/s² = 1/(32.2) lbf·ft (since F=ma → F = m a → a=F/m → so m a = F → a = F/m → 1 ft/s² = (1 lbf)/(m) → so m a = F → a = F/m → 1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf)/(m) → so m a = lbf → but perhaps this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, 1 lbm·ft²/s² = (1/32.2) lbf·ft.

Because 1 lbf = 32.2 lbm·ft/s² → So, 1 lbm·ft²/s² = (1/32.2) lbf·ft.

So, KE_dot = 25,000 lbm·ft²/s² = 25,000 / 32.2 lbf·ft/s.

Which is 25,000 /32.2 ≈ 776.6 lbf·ft/s.

Now, convert lbf·ft to Btu:

1 Btu = 778 lbf·ft → so 776.6 lbf·ft/s = 776.6 /778 ≈ 0.998 Btu/s ≈ 1 Btu/s.

But wait, that's the KE at the entrance. The exit KE would be:

KE_dot_exit = 0.5 * m_dot * v2^2 = 0.5 *5 *50^2 = 0.5 *5 *2500 = 0.5 *12,500 = 6,250 lbm·ft²/s².

Convert to lbf·ft/s:

6,250 /32.2 ≈ 194.1 lbf·ft/s.

Which is 194.1 /778 ≈ 0.249 Btu/s.

So, the change in kinetic energy is KE_dot_exit - KE_dot_entrance = 0.249 - 1 ≈ -0.751 Btu/s.

Wait, but earlier I thought the KE change was negative. So, the system is losing kinetic energy, which makes sense because the velocity is decreasing.

Now, potential energy change.

ΔPE per lbm is g(z2 - z1).

So, m_dot * g (z2 - z1) =5 *32.2 ft/s² * (0 - 100) ft.

=5 *32.2 * (-100) =5*(-3220) =-16,100 ft·lbm/s².

Again, converting to Btu/s.

1 ft·lbm/s² = (1 lbf·ft/s²) /32.2 → because 1 lbf =32.2 lbm·ft/s² → so 1 ft·lbm/s² = (1 lbf·ft/s²) /32.2.

But wait, 1 lbf·ft = 1/778 Btu.

So, -16,100 ft·lbm/s² = (-16,100) * (1 lbf·ft/s²) /32.2 → which is (-16,100 /32.2) lbf·ft/s² → approximately -499.999 ≈ -500 lbf·ft/s².

Wait, no, because ft·lbm/s² is mass times acceleration, which is force. So, 1 ft·lbm/s² = 1 lbf (since F=ma, so lbm·ft/s² = lbf).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, the potential energy term is m_dot * g * (z2 - z1).

Which is 5 lbm/s *32.2 ft/s² * (-100 ft) =5 *32.2*(-100) =5*(-3220)= -16,100 ft²·lbm/s².

But to convert this to Btu/s:

We know that 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf.

And 1 lbf =32.2 lbm·ft/s² → so 1 ft·lbf =32.2 lbm·ft²/s².

Wait, so 1 ft²·lbm/s² = (1 ft·lbf) /32.2.

Because F = m a → a = F/m → so 1 ft/s² = (1 lbf)/(m) → m ft/s² = lbf.

So, m·ft²/s² = lbf·ft.

Thus, m·ft²/s² = lbf·ft.

So, 1 lbm·ft²/s² = 1 lbf·ft /32.2.

So, the potential energy change is -16,100 lbm·ft²/s² = (-16,100/32.2) lbf·ft/s².

Which is (-16,100/32.2) lbf·ft/s² → let me compute that:

16,100 /32.2 ≈ 500 → so approximately -500 lbf·ft/s².

Now, convert lbf·ft to Btu:

-500 lbf·ft/s² * (1 Btu /778 lbf·ft) )= -500 /778 ≈ -0.643 Btu/s.

Wait, but that's the potential energy change per second, so ΔPE_dot = -0.643 Btu/s.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy is m_dot * g * (z2 - z1) → which is 5 *32.2*(0-100) =5*(-3220) =-16,100 lbm·ft²/s². But as before, converting to Btu/s gives approximately -0.643 Btu/s.

Now, putting all together into the energy equation:

W = Q + m_dot [ (h1 + (v1²)/2 + g z1) - (h2 + (v2²)/2 + g z2) ]

Wait, no, the correct equation is:

W = Q + m_dot [ (h1 + (v1²)/2 + g z1 - h2 - (v2²)/2 - g z2) ]

So,

W = Q + m_dot [ (h1 - h2) + (v1² - v2²)/2 + g(z1 - z2) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

h1 - h2 = 1000 - 1020 = -20 Btu/lbm.

v1² - v2² = 100^2 -50^2 =10,000 -2500 =7500 ft²/s².

So, (v1² -v2²)/2 =7500/2=3750 ft²/s².

g(z1 - z2)=32.2*(100-0)=32.2*100=3220 ft²/s².

So, combining these:

m_dot [ (-20) + 3750/32.2 + 3220/32.2 ]

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because h is in Btu/lbm, and the KE and PE terms are in (ft²/s²), which we need to convert to Btu/lbm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each term in Btu/lbm.

So,

h1 - h2 = -20 Btu/lbm.

Then, (v1² - v2²)/2 =7500/2 =3750 ft²/s² → convert to Btu/lbm.

As before, 1 ft²/s² = (1 lbf)/(32.2 lbm) → and 1 lbf = 1/778 Btu → so 1 ft²/s² = (1/778) /32.2 Btu/lbm → 1 ft²/s² = 1/(778*32.2) Btu/lbm.

So, 3750 ft²/s² =3750/(778*32.2) Btu/lbm.

Compute denominator:778 *32.2 ≈778 *32=24,896; 778*0.2=155.6 → total ≈25,051.6.

So, 3750 /25,051.6 ≈0.15 Btu/lbm.

Similarly, g(z1 - z2)=3220 ft²/s² → convert to Btu/lbm.

Same factor:1 ft²/s²=1/(778*32.2) Btu/lbm.

So,3220/(778*32.2) =3220/25,051.6≈0.1285 Btu/lbm.

So, the total in the bracket is:

(-20) +0.15 +0.1285 = (-20) +0.2785 ≈-19.7215 Btu/lbm.

Multiply by m_dot=5 lbm/s:5*(-19.7215) =-98.6075 Btu/s.

Now, W = Q + m_dot [ ... ] → Q is 50 Btu/s.

So, W=50 + (-98.6075) =-48.6075 Btu/s.

Wait, but that would be negative, which would imply that the system is doing negative work, which I think would mean work is being done on the system. But the question is asking how much work can be done by the system, which would be positive. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let me go back to the energy equation. The correct form is:

Q - W = m_dot [ (h2 - h1) + (v2² -v1²)/2 + g(z2 -z1) ]

So,

W = Q - m_dot [ (h2 -h1) + (v2² -v1²)/2 + g(z2 -z1) ]

So, plugging in:

h2 -h1 =20 Btu/lbm.

(v2² -v1²)/2 = (2500 -10,000)/2 =-3750 ft²/s².

g(z2 -z1)=32.2*(0-100)= -3220 ft²/s².

So, the bracket becomes:

20 + (-3750/32.2) + (-3220/32.2) → Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused again.

Wait, let me compute each term in Btu/lbm.

h2 -h1=20 Btu/lbm.

(v2² -v1²)/2 =-3750 ft²/s² → which is -3750/(778*32.2) Btu/lbm ≈-3750/25,051.6 ≈-0.15 Btu/lbm.

g(z2 -z1)=32.2*(0-100)= -3220 ft²/s² → which is -3220/(778*32.2) → same as -3220/25,051.6 ≈-0.1285 Btu/lbm.

So, the bracket:

20 -0.15 -0.1285 ≈19.7215 Btu/lbm.

Multiply by m_dot=5 →5*19.7215≈98.6075 Btu/s.

Then, W=Q - m_dot [ ... ] → W=50 -98.6075= -48.6075 Btu/s.

Wait, but negative work implies that work is done on the system, not by the system. But the question asks how much work can be done by the system. Hmm, this suggests that the system is actually doing negative work, which would mean that work is being done on the system. But that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Did I make a mistake in the sign convention?

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the energy equation. The correct form is:

Q - W = m_dot [ (h2 -h1) + (v2² -v1²)/2 + g(z2 -z1) ]

So, solving for W:

W = Q - m_dot [ ... ]

If the result is negative, that would mean that the system is doing negative work, i.e., work is being done on the system. But the problem states that heat is transferred at 50 Btu/sec. So, perhaps the system is absorbing heat and doing work. Wait, but according to the calculation, W is negative, which would mean that work is done on the system, not by it.

This seems contradictory. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy equation. Let me write it again correctly.

The energy balance equation for a control volume is:

Q - W = m_dot [ (h2 - h1) + (v2² -v1²)/2 + g(z2 - z1) ]

So, if Q is positive (heat in), and the right side is positive, then W would be Q minus that. So, if the right side is larger than Q, W becomes negative, meaning work is done on the system.

In this case, m_dot [ ... ] is 5 * (20 -0.15 -0.1285) →5*(19.7215)=98.6075.

So, W=50 -98.6075= -48.6075 Btu/s.

This suggests that the system is doing -48.6 Btu/s of work, which implies that work is being done on the system at 48.6 Btu/s.

But the question asks how much work can be done by the system. If the result is negative, that would mean the system cannot do work; instead, work is done on it.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the work term. Maybe the correct form is W_dot = m_dot [ ... ] - Q.

Wait, perhaps the correct form is:

W_dot = m_dot [ (h1 + (v1²)/2 + g z1 ) - (h2 + (v2²)/2 + g z2) ] - Q

Which would be:

W_dot = m_dot [ (h1 - h2) + (v1² - v2²)/2 + g(z1 - z2) ] - Q

Plugging in the numbers:

h1 - h2 = -20.

(v1² -v2²)/2 = 3750/2=1875 → but in the correct units.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done by the system is the output work, so if the equation gives a negative value, it means the system is doing negative work, i.e., work is done on the system.

But the problem states that heat is transferred at 50 Btu/sec. So, perhaps the system is absorbing heat and using some of it to do work. But according to the calculation, the net work is negative, which implies that the system is actually requiring work to be done on it.

This doesn't align with the problem's implication that the system can do work. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is:

W_dot = Q + m_dot [ (h1 + (v1²)/2 + g z1 ) - (h2 + (v2²)/2 + g z2) ]

Which would be:

W_dot =50 +5*( [1000 + (100^2)/2 +32.2*100] - [1020 + (50^2)/2 +32.2*0] )

Compute each part:

h1 + (v1²)/2 +g z1 =1000 + (10000)/2 +32.2*100 →1000 +5000 +3220=9220.

h2 + (v2²)/2 +g z2 =1020 + (2500)/2 +0 →1020 +1250=2270.

So, the bracket is 9220 -2270=6950.

Multiply by m_dot=5 →5*6950=34,750.

Add Q=50 →34,750 +50=34,800 Btu/s.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't go that high. So, I must have made a mistake in the units.

Ah, wait a minute! I think I messed up the unit conversions for the kinetic and potential energy terms. Because h is in Btu/lbm, but the kinetic and potential energy terms are in different units, I need to convert them correctly.

Let me try this again, more carefully.

Compute the energy terms per unit mass:

h1 =1000 Btu/lbm.

(v1²)/2 = (100)^2/2 =5000 ft²/s².

g z1=32.2 *100=3220 ft²/s².

Convert these to Btu/lbm.

As before, 1 ft²/s² =1/(32.2 *778) Btu/lbm.

So,

(v1²/2) =5000 ft²/s² →5000 * (1/(32.2*778)) Btu/lbm.

Similarly, g z1=3220 ft²/s² →3220 * (1/(32.2*778)) Btu/lbm.

Compute these:

Denominator:32.2 *778≈25,051.6.

So,

(v1^2/2) →5000 /25,051.6≈0.1996 Btu/lbm.

g z1 →3220/25,051.6≈0.1285 Btu/lbm.

So,

h1 + KE1 + PE1 =1000 +0.1996 +0.1285≈1000.3281 Btu/lbm.

Similarly, for exit:

h2=1020 Btu/lbm.

(v2^2)/2= (50)^2/2=1250 ft²/s² →1250/25,051.6≈0.0499 Btu/lbm.

g z2=0.

So, h2 + KE2 + PE2=1020 +0.0499 +0≈1020.0499 Btu/lbm.

Now, the change in specific energy is:

Δs = (h2 + KE2 + PE2) - (h1 + KE1 + PE1 )=1020.0499 -1000.3281≈19.7218 Btu/lbm.

So, m_dot * Δs =5 *19.7218≈98.609 Btu/s.

Now, the energy equation is:

Q - W = m_dot * Δs → so,

W = Q - m_dot * Δs → W=50 -98.609≈-48.609 Btu/s.

Hmm, so that's the same result as before. The negative work implies that the system is doing negative work, i.e., work is being done on the system.

But the question asks how much work can be done by the system. If W is negative, it means the system is doing -48.6 Btu/s of work, which is equivalent to 48.6 Btu/s of work being done on the system.

But the options provided are all positive values for work, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the energy equation. Let me check again.

The correct energy equation is:

Q - W = m_dot [ (h2 + (v2^2)/2 + g z2 ) - (h1 + (v1^2)/2 + g z1 ) ]

So,

W = Q - m_dot [ (h2 -h1) + (v2^2 -v1^2)/2 + g(z2 -z1) ]

Which is,

W=50 -5*(20 + (-3750/2) + (-3220) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute each term correctly.

Wait, let me compute the bracket correctly.

h2 -h1=20 Btu/lbm.

(v2^2 -v1^2)/2 = (2500-10,000)/2= (-7500)/2=-3750 ft²/s².

g(z2 -z1)=32.2*(0-100)=-3220 ft²/s².

Now, convert these to Btu/lbm.

(v2^2 -v1^2)/2 =-3750 ft²/s² →-3750/(32.2*778) →-3750/25,051.6≈-0.15 Btu/lbm.

g(z2 -z1)=-3220/(32.2*778)= -3220/25,051.6≈-0.1285 Btu/lbm.

So, the bracket:

20 -0.15 -0.1285≈19.7215 Btu/lbm.

Multiply by m_dot=5 →5*19.7215≈98.6075 Btu/s.

So,

W=50 -98.6075≈-48.6075 Btu/s.

This suggests that the work done by the system is negative, meaning the system is actually doing -48.6 Btu/s of work, which implies that 48.6 Btu/s of work is being done on the system.

But the problem is asking how much work can be done by the system. So, perhaps the answer is negative, but the options are positive. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign convention.

Wait, perhaps the work done by the system is W_dot = m_dot [ (h1 + (v1^2)/2 +g z1 ) - (h2 + (v2^2)/2 +g z2 ) ] - Q.

In that case:

m_dot [ (h1 -h2) + (v1^2 -v2^2)/2 +g(z1 -z2) ] - Q.

Which is,

5*( -20 + (100^2 -50^2)/2 +32.2*(100-0) ) -50.

Compute each part:

h1 -h2= -20.

(v1^2 -v2^2)/2= (10000-2500)/2=7500/2=3750 ft²/s².

g(z1 -z2)=32.2*100=3220 ft²/s².

Now, convert these to Btu/lbm:

3750 ft²/s² →3750/(32.2*778)=3750/25,051.6≈0.15 Btu/lbm.

3220 ft²/s² →3220/25,051.6≈0.1285 Btu/lbm.

So,

-20 +0.15 +0.1285≈-19.7215 Btu/lbm.

Multiply by m_dot=5 →5*(-19.7215)= -98.6075 Btu/s.

Now, subtract Q=50:

W_dot= -98.6075 -50= -148.6075 Btu/s.

This doesn't make sense either. I think I'm getting stuck in the sign conventions. Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps the work done by the system is the net energy output, which would be the energy entering (heat) plus the energy from the fluid's change. So,

W = Q + (m_dot * (h1 + KE1 + PE1) ) - (m_dot * (h2 + KE2 + PE2) )

Which is,

W=50 + (5*(1000 +5000 +3220 )) - (5*(1020 +1250 +0)).

Wait, but again, I'm mixing units. Let me make sure to convert everything to Btu.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the energy in Btu per second.

Compute the energy at the inlet and outlet in Btu/s.

Inlet:

h1 =1000 Btu/lbm.

KE1= (100^2)/2=5000 ft²/s² → convert to Btu/lbm:5000/(32.2*778)=5000/25,051.6≈0.1996 Btu/lbm.

PE1=32.2*100=3220 ft²/s² →3220/(32.2*778)=3220/25,051.6≈0.1285 Btu/lbm.

Total specific energy at inlet:1000 +0.1996 +0.1285≈1000.3281 Btu/lbm.

Outlet:

h2=1020 Btu/lbm.

KE2=(50^2)/2=1250 ft²/s² →1250/25,051.6≈0.0499 Btu/lbm.

PE2=0.

Total specific energy at outlet:1020 +0.0499≈1020.0499 Btu/lbm.

Energy change per unit mass:1020.0499 -1000.3281≈19.7218 Btu/lbm.

So, m_dot * ΔE =5 *19.7218≈98.609 Btu/s.

Now, the energy equation is:

Q - W = m_dot * ΔE → W=Q - m_dot * ΔE → W=50 -98.609≈-48.609 Btu/s.

Again, negative work. So, the system is doing negative work, meaning work is done on the system at 48.6 Btu/s.

But the question asks how much work can be done by the system, which would be positive. Therefore, perhaps the answer is negative, but the options don't have negative values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the magnitude, so 48.6 Btu/s, which is approximately 48.5, matching option J.

Wait, looking at the options:

J: -48.5 Btu/sec, 0.75 ft².

Wait, no, option J is -48.5 Btu/sec, but the question is about work done by the system, which would be positive. So, perhaps the correct answer is -48.6, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area of the inlet as well.

The specific volume is given as 15 ft³/lbm. So, the area A can be found using the flow rate equation:

m_dot = (density) * A * V → but specific volume is 1/v, where v is specific volume. So, density ρ =1/v=1/15 lbm/ft³.

Alternatively, m_dot = (specific volume)^-1 * A * V → but wait, m_dot= (A * V) / specific volume.

Wait, mass flow rate m_dot = ρ * A * V = (1/specific volume) * A * V → so,

A= m_dot * specific volume / V.

Wait, but I don't have the velocity at the inlet. Wait, the velocity at the inlet is given as 100 ft/s.

So,

A = m_dot * specific volume / V_inlet.

m_dot=5 lbm/s.

specific volume=15 ft³/lbm.

V_inlet=100 ft/s.

So,

A=5 *15 /100=75/100=0.75 ft².

So, the area is 0.75 ft².

Now, looking at the options, option J has work as -48.5 Btu/sec and area 0.75 ft². But since the work is negative, perhaps the intended answer is option F, which has -49 Btu/sec and 0.6 ft². But wait, no, option J has 0.75 ft² and -48.5, which matches our calculation.

But the problem is that the work is negative, implying work is done on the system. However, the options have positive work values, but in the options, the first part is the work, but in the question, the work done by the system would be negative. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the magnitude, so 48.5 Btu/s, which is option J.

But looking back, the options are:

A: -50, 0.5

B: -50, 1

C: -45, 0.8

D: -42, 0.65

E: -43.5, 0.9

F: -49, 0.6

G: -45, 1.2

H: -40, 0.7

I: -47, 0.85

J: -48.5, 0.75

So, our calculated work is approximately -48.6 Btu/s, which is closest to option J: -48.5 Btu/sec and area 0.75 ft².

So, the answer would be option J.
</think>

To determine the work done by the system and the inlet area, we apply the first law of thermodynamics for a control volume:

\[
Q - W = \dot{m} \left[ (h_2 - h_1) + \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2} + g(z_2 - z_1) \right]
\]

### Step 1: Known Values
- \( \dot{m} = 5 \, \text{lbm/s} \)
- \( Q = 50 \, \text{Btu/s} \)
- \( h_1 = 1000 \, \text{Btu/lbm}, \, h_2 = 1020 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \)
- \( v_1 = 100 \, \text{ft/s}, \, v_2 = 50 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- \( z_1 = 100 \, \text{ft}, \, z_2 = 0 \, \text{ft} \)
- \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \)
- Specific volume, \( v = 15 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{lbm} \)

### Step 2: Compute Changes in Energy
1. **Enthalpy change**:
   \[
   h_2 - h_1 = 1020 - 1000 = 20 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
   \]

2. **Kinetic energy change**:
   \[
   \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2} = \frac{50^2 - 100^2}{2} = \frac{2500 - 10000}{2} = -3750 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]
   Convert to \( \text{Btu/lbm} \):
   \[
   -3750 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2 \times \frac{1}{32.2 \times 778} \approx -0.15 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
   \]

3. **Potential energy change**:
   \[
   g(z_2 - z_1) = 32.2 \times (0 - 100) = -3220 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]
   Convert to \( \text{Btu/lbm} \):
   \[
   -3220 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2 \times \frac{1}{32.2 \times 778} \approx -0.1285 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
   \]

4. **Total energy change**:
   \[
   \Delta E = (h_2 - h_1) + \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2} + g(z_2 - z_1) = 20 - 0.15 - 0.1285 \approx 19.7215 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
   \]

5. **Energy flow rate**:
   \[
   \dot{m} \Delta E = 5 \times 19.7215 \approx 98.6075 \, \text{Btu/s}
   \]

### Step 3: Solve for Work
Using the energy equation:
\[
W = Q - \dot{m} \Delta E = 50 - 98.6075 \approx -48.6075 \, \text{Btu/s}
\]
The negative sign indicates that work is done on the system.

### Step 4: Compute Inlet Area
The mass flow rate is related to the inlet velocity and area:
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{A v_1}{v}
\]
Rearranging for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{\dot{m} v}{v_1} = \frac{5 \times 15}{100} = 0.75 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

### Final Answer
The work done by the system is approximately \( -48.6 \, \text{Btu/s} \) (indicating work is done on the system), and the inlet area is \( 0.75 \, \text{ft}^2 \). The closest option is:

**J: -48.5 Btu/sec, 0.75 ft²**

Answer: J
