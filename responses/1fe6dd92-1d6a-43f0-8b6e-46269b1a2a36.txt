Okay, so I need to figure out the return on invested capital (ROIC) based on the given data. Let me see what I remember about ROIC. From what I recall, ROIC is a financial metric that shows how much profit a company generates with the money it has invested. It's calculated by taking the net income and dividing it by the invested capital, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. 

Looking at the question, the net income for the year ended December 31, 1967, is $25,000. That's the numerator in the ROIC formula. Now, the tricky part is figuring out the denominator, which is the invested capital. The question provides two net investment figures: $250,000 as of December 31, 1966, and $350,000 as of December 31, 1967. 

Wait, ROIC typically uses the average invested capital during the period, right? Because it's about the return over the entire year, so taking the average makes sense. So I should average the two net investment values. Let me calculate that: (250,000 + 350,000) divided by 2. That gives me 600,000 divided by 2, which is $300,000. 

So now I have the net income ($25,000) divided by the average invested capital ($300,000). Let me do that division: 25,000 / 300,000. Hmm, 25 divided by 300 is 0.083333... which is approximately 8.3333%. The question asks for the nearest tenth of 1%, so that would be 8.3%. 

Looking at the options, option F is 8.3%, so that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Net income is 25k, average invested capital is 300k, 25/300 is indeed roughly 8.33%. Yep, that looks right.

The return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated by dividing the net income by the average invested capital and then converting it to a percentage. The average invested capital is the average of the net investments at the start and end of the period. 

- Net income = $25,000  
- Average invested capital = ($250,000 + $350,000) / 2 = $300,000  
- ROIC = ($25,000 / $300,000) × 100 ≈ 8.3%  

The closest option to 8.3% is F: 8.3%.

Answer: F
