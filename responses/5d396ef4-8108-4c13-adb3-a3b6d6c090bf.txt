Okay, so I have this question about treaties and their forms. I'm a bit rusty on international law, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking whether treaties should assume a particular form, and there are several options to choose from, labeled A to J.

First, I remember that treaties are agreements between states, and they can be in different forms. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. From what I recall, treaties don't necessarily have to be written in a specific legal jargon; sometimes they can be oral or even just exchanged through diplomatic notes. Wait, no, actually, I think most treaties are written because they need to be clear and binding. But I'm not certain about that.

I think the key here is understanding whether the form of a treaty is important. The options are about whether treaties must assume a particular form, or if they can be in any form, or if they need to be designated as such. Let me break down the options.

Option A says treaties don't need to be designated as such but must always assume a particular form. So, maybe they don't have to be called treaties, but they have to look a certain way. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Option B suggests they should be written in legal language regardless of form. I don't think that's right because I remember that some treaties can be less formal, like executive agreements, which might not use the same legal terminology as formal treaties.

Option C says they should always assume a particular form, no matter the designation. So whether they're called treaties or something else, they must have a specific structure. That might be more accurate, but I'm not entirely certain.

Option D states they should be designated as treaties but don't need a specific form. So, they have to be recognized as treaties, but their format can vary. That seems plausible because I think designation is important for their legal standing, but the form might not be as rigid.

Option E claims they don't have to assume a particular form or be designated. That seems unlikely because I believe designation is important for their validity, especially in international law.

Option F says they shouldn't be designated and don't need a specific form. I'm pretty sure that's incorrect because treaties are designated as such to have binding legal force.

Option G suggests they don't need designation or form but must be ratified by legislative bodies. Wait, but not all treaties need legislative ratification. For example, executive agreements don't always require that. So G might not be correct.

Option H says they must be designated as such, regardless of form. So the name is important, but the form can vary. That makes sense because the designation 'treaty' implies certain legal obligations.

Option I claims they must be designated and assume a particular form. So both designation and form are required, but I'm not sure if form is always necessary. I think designation is key, but form can be flexible.

Option J says they can assume any form but must be signed by heads of state. I think that's partially true because some treaties are signed by representatives, not necessarily heads of state. So J might not be entirely correct.

Now, I'm trying to remember the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. It deals with the rules around treaties. From what I recall, the convention doesn't require treaties to be in a specific form. They can be oral, written, or even partly oral and partly written. So the form isn't as important as the agreement and the intention to be bound by international law.

So, if form isn't required, then options that say they must assume a particular form are incorrect. That would eliminate options A, C, I, and J. Now, looking at the designation: does a treaty need to be called a treaty? I think as long as it's an agreement between states with the intention to be legally bound, it can be considered a treaty regardless of its designation. So maybe designation isn't always necessary either.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. The term 'treaty' implies a certain level of formality, but I think the actual requirements are more about the content and the agreement between states. So, perhaps the form isn't necessary, nor the designation. That would point towards option E, which says they don't have to assume a particular form or be designated. But I'm not entirely sure because I think in practice, treaties are usually written and designated, but legally, they don't have to be.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E because the Vienna Convention allows for treaties to be in any form, and they don't need to be specifically designated as such, as long as they meet the requirements of an agreement under international law.

Wait, but I think the key is that the form and designation aren't legally required. So the answer would be E. But let me double-check. The Vienna Convention does say that treaties can be authenticated in any form, so they don't need a specific form. As for designation, I think the name 'treaty' is more about the type of agreement rather than a legal requirement. So, E seems correct because it says they don't have to assume a particular form or be designated as such.

The question revolves around whether treaties must assume a particular form or be designated as such. Based on the analysis, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties indicates that treaties can be in any form—oral, written, or partially oral—and do not need to be specifically designated as "treaties" to be legally binding. Therefore, the correct answer is that treaties do not have to assume a particular form or be designated as such.

Answer: E
