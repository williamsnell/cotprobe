Okay, so I've got this question here. It says, "If you travel at high speed, then compared with your friends who 'stay at home,' you are..." and then there are options from A to J. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me read the question again. It's about traveling at high speed and comparing oneself to friends who stay home. So, the question is about the effects of high-speed travel on the traveler relative to those who aren't moving. I'm thinking this might relate to physics, maybe something like time dilation or length contraction from special relativity. But wait, maybe it's a trick question or a play on words.

So, the options are:

A: neither younger nor older.
B: taller.
C: shorter.
D: heavier.
E: faster.
F: longer.
G: lighter.
H: older.
I: younger.
J: slower.

Wait, the question is about how you compare to your friends who are staying home. So, if you're moving at high speed, does that affect your aging compared to them? From what I remember, in special relativity, time dilation occurs where a moving clock ticks slower than a stationary one. So, if you're traveling at high speed relative to your friends, from their perspective, you would age slower. That means, from their point of view, you would be younger than them when you return. But wait, the question is whether you are younger or older compared to them.

Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite. If you're moving, your own time is dilated, so when you return, you're younger than your friends. Let me think. Suppose you go on a space journey at a high speed, say near the speed of light. When you come back, you've aged less than the friends who stayed home. So, you would be younger. So, option I: younger.

But wait, the question says "you are" in comparison. So, from their perspective, you're moving, so your clock is running slow. So, they would see you as aging slower, meaning you would be younger. So, when you return, you're younger.

Alternatively, maybe the question is more about the perception. If you're moving fast, you might experience less time passing, so you'd be younger than those who stayed.

So, the answer should be I: younger. That's option I.

The question relates to the effects of high-speed travel on aging compared to stationary friends. According to special relativity, time dilation causes the traveler to age slower, making them younger upon return. 

Answer: I
