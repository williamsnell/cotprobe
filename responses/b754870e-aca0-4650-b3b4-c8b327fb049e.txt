Question:

How are whales adapted for their life in cold waters?

Options:

A: Whales have a specialized gill system to regulate temperature.
B: Whales are cold-blooded and adjust their body temperature to the water temperature.
C: Whales have a thick fur coat to keep them warm.
D: Whales have a unique enzyme that prevents their body fluids from freezing.
E: Whales maintain a nearly constant internal body temperature and have a tremendous amount of subcutaneous fat serving an insulating function.
F: Whales possess an advanced circulatory system that directs warm blood to the skin surface.
G: Whales have expandable bladders that they fill with warm water to maintain body temperature.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how whales are adapted for life in cold waters. Let's break down each option and see which makes the most sense.

Option A says whales have a specialized gill system to regulate temperature. Wait, but whales aren't fish. They're mammals, and they don't have gills. So this can't be right. Mammals breathe air, so gills wouldn't work for them. So I can rule out A.

Option B claims whales are cold-blooded and adjust their body temperature. Cold-blooded animals, like reptiles, rely on their environment for warmth. But whales are warm-blooded, meaning they maintain a constant internal temperature. So B doesn't seem correct.

Option C suggests a thick fur coat. I remember that whales do have some body hair, but their main insulation is actually blubber, which is a layer of fat under the skin. Fur alone might not be enough for such large animals in extremely cold water. So C might not be the best answer.

Option D says they have a unique enzyme to prevent body fluids from freezing. While it's true that some animals have antifreeze proteins, I'm not sure if whales are known for this. Their primary adaptation is probably more about insulation and maintaining body heat rather than preventing freezing directly. So D could be a possibility, but I'm not certain.

Option E states they maintain a nearly constant internal temperature and have a lot of subcutaneous fat as insulation. That sounds familiar. Whales, being mammals, are endothermic, so they do keep their body temperature constant. The layer of blubber (subcutaneous fat) acts as excellent insulation, which helps them retain heat in cold waters. This seems like the most likely correct answer.

Option F mentions an advanced circulatory system directing warm blood to the skin. While whales do have efficient circulatory systems, the primary method of heat retention is blubber, not just blood flow. I don't think F is correct.

Option G talks about expandable bladders filled with warm water. I haven't heard of this before. Bladders in whales are usually for buoyancy, not temperature regulation. So G is probably incorrect.

Putting it all together, the best explanation is Option E: whales maintain a constant internal temperature with a thick layer of blubber. This is how they stay warm in cold waters.

Whales are adapted to cold waters primarily through maintaining a nearly constant internal body temperature and having a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, known as blubber, which serves as insulation. This is the most accurate and well-known adaptation.

Answer: E
