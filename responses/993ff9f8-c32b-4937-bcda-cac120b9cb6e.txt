Okay, so I have this question about why ocean water looks greenish-blue. I'm a bit rusty on my optics and color science, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what happens to the light that causes the greenish-blue color. The options are various light phenomena: refracted, magnified, reflected, intensified, filtered, absorbed, transmitted, diffracted, polarized.

Hmm. I remember that when light hits water, some of it gets absorbed, some reflected, and some transmitted. The colors we see in the ocean are related to how light interacts with the water.

Wait, I think water absorbs certain wavelengths of light more than others. Red and violet light are absorbed more by water, right? So when light enters the ocean, the red and violet parts get absorbed, and the remaining colors, like blue and green, are transmitted or reflected.

But the question is about the light that hasn't been something. So the greenish-blue is the light that hasn't been... maybe absorbed? Because the absorbed part is the red and violet, which are taken in by the water. So the transmitted or reflected light would be the colors we see, which are greenish-blue.

Wait, but the question says "light that hasn’t been". So if the water absorbs some light, the remaining light is what we see. So the greenish-blue is due to the light that hasn't been absorbed. So the answer would be F: absorbed.

Alternatively, maybe it's about reflection. Like, when light reflects off the water surface, that's why we see the color. But I think the absorption plays a bigger role in the color of the water itself, not just the surface.

Another thought: when light is transmitted through water, the longer wavelengths (like red) are absorbed more as the light goes deeper. So the transmitted light that comes from below is missing those longer wavelengths, leaving blue and green. So the transmitted light hasn't been absorbed as much, but the question is about the color being due to light that hasn't been something.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the greenish-blue color is due mostly to light that hasn’t been...". So the color is from the light that hasn't been absorbed. Because the absorbed light is the red and violet, so the remaining is green and blue.

So looking at the options, F is absorbed. So the color is from the light that hasn't been absorbed. So the answer should be F: absorbed.

The greenish-blue color of ocean water is due to the light that hasn't been absorbed by the water. When sunlight enters the ocean, red and violet wavelengths are absorbed more, leaving blue and green to be transmitted or reflected, which we perceive as the ocean's color.

Answer: F
