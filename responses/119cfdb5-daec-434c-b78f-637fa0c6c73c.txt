Question:

A city ordinance forbids washing vehicles parked on city streets. A man washes his car while it is parked on the street in front of his home. The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?

Options:

A: The man had already planned to dry the water before it froze, but was unable to because of an unexpected emergency.
B: The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.
C: The city had been warned about the icy conditions but had not salted the streets.
D: The driver is not a resident of the city.
E: The man had been washing his car on the street for years without any previous incidents.
F: The driver had previously been involved in multiple accidents due to reckless driving.
G: The man had placed a warning sign near the puddle to alert drivers of the potential hazard.
H: The man was not aware of the ordinance.
I: The driver was driving at an excessively high speed at the time of the accident.
J: The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.

Okay, so I have this torts question here about negligence per se. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a city ordinance that forbids washing vehicles on the street. A man does exactly that, washes his car on the street, and the water freezes, causing an accident the next day. The driver sues the man, claiming negligence per se.

So, I remember that negligence per se occurs when a statute is violated, and the statute was intended to prevent the kind of harm that occurred. Here, the city ordinance likely exists to prevent slippery conditions on the streets, so washing cars there is prohibited to avoid accidents.

The question asks which additional fact would help the man most. So, the man is being sued for negligence per se, which means the plaintiff is arguing that the man violated a statute (washing the car) which was meant to prevent such accidents.

To defend against negligence per se, the defendant (the man) might need to present a defense. Possible defenses could include that the statute didn't apply, he had a reasonable excuse, or maybe the statute doesn't cover his actions. Alternatively, he might argue that even if he violated the statute, it wasn't the proximate cause of the accident, but that's more about causation, not the negligence per se itself.

Looking at the options:

A: He planned to dry the water but couldn't because of an unexpected emergency. This sounds like an excuse for violating the ordinance. If he had an emergency, maybe it's a defense to the negligence per se.

B: The driver saw him washing the car. Not sure how relevant that is. Maybe it shows foreseeability, but I'm not sure if it helps the man.

C: The city wasn't salted despite warnings. That might be a contributory negligence or comparative negligence point, but it's about the city's duty, not the man's.

D: Driver isn't a resident. Not sure how that affects the man's liability.

E: He washed the car for years without incidents. That could show he's been careful before, but if he violated the ordinance, it's about the current violation causing harm.

F: Driver had multiple accidents. Maybe the driver is reckless, but that doesn't directly help the man's defense against negligence per se.

G: He put up a warning sign. That could show he took steps to mitigate the risk, which might go against the negligence per se because he's taking reasonable steps. Or it might show he wasn't negligent because he warned people.

H: He wasn't aware of the ordinance. Ignorance of the law is usually not a defense, so this might not help.

I: Driver was speeding. Again, this could be a contributory negligence point, but doesn't directly defend the man's action.

J: The ordinance was enacted after a similar accident. That might show the purpose of the ordinance, which supports negligence per se, so it wouldn't help the man.

So, the options that could help the man are A and G. Option A provides an excuse for violating the ordinance, while G shows he took steps to warn, which might indicate he wasn't negligent. But negligence per se doesn't require a showing of negligence; it's strict liability for violating the statute. However, if the statute allows for exceptions, like an emergency, then A would help. Alternatively, if the man can show that even if he violated the statute, he wasn't negligent because he took precautions, but I think negligence per se is about the violation, not the reasonableness of the conduct.

Wait, in some cases, even if a statute is violated, if there's an excuse like an emergency, it might negate the negligence per se. So A could be a good defense. Alternatively, if the man had a permit or some exception, but that's not an option here.

Option G: putting up a warning sign. That might show that he took reasonable steps, but negligence per se is about the violation. Unless the sign negates the duty, but I think the duty is strict. So maybe G doesn't help because the violation is the key point.

So, the best option is probably A. If he had an emergency, he might have a defense to the negligence per se claim, as he couldn't have dried the water because of an unexpected situation, which could make his violation excusable.

Alternatively, E says he did it for years without incidents. That might show that his conduct was not inherently dangerous, but the fact that this time it caused an accident because it froze. But the ordinance is about preventing such situations, so past conduct without issues might not be a strong defense.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between A and E. But I think A is stronger because it provides a reason why he couldn't have prevented the puddle, which might be an excuse for the ordinance violation. So the answer is A.
</think>

The man is being sued for negligence per se due to violating the city ordinance against washing vehicles on the street, which led to a frozen puddle causing an accident. To defend himself, he needs a fact that either excuses the violation or shows he took reasonable steps. 

Option A suggests an unexpected emergency prevented him from drying the water, which could serve as an excuse for violating the ordinance. This directly addresses the negligence per se claim by providing a reason for the violation. Option E highlights his past safe behavior, but it doesn't address the current violation or its consequences. Other options either don't directly defend against the negligence per se claim or are less relevant. Therefore, the most helpful fact is that he couldn't dry the water due to an emergency.

Answer: A
