Okay, so I have this question about mystics and their beliefs regarding evil as a distortion that reveals divine love more clearly. I'm a bit rusty on my mystic theologians, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which mystic held the belief that evil is a distortion that makes divine love more apparent. The options are A through J, with various historical figures. I need to figure out who among these fits that description.

First, I'll try to recall what each of these mystics is known for. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Thomas Aquinas. He was a Scholastic theologian and philosopher, known for his Summa Theologica. He's more about integrating Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. I don't recall him focusing on evil as a distortion revealing divine love. He might have discussed evil in terms of sin and its opposition to good, but not in this specific way.

Option B: Catherine of Siena. She was a mystic and a reformer. She had visions and wrote about divine love. I think she might have had a more positive view of suffering and evil as a path to God, but I'm not sure if she specifically said that evil distorts to reveal divine love. She's more known for her strong spirituality and intercession.

Option C: Teresa of Avila. She was a Spanish mystic and Carmelite reformer. She wrote about the interior life and the threefold prayer. Her focus was more on the soul's journey towards God, including the dark night of the soul. She might have discussed evil as part of the purification process, but I'm not certain if she framed it as a distortion revealing divine love.

Option D: Hildegard of Bingen. She was an 11th-century mystic, known for her visions and writings on theology and natural history. She did talk about the interplay between light and shadow, good and evil. I think she might have seen evil as a necessary contrast that highlights the good, thereby revealing divine love more clearly. That seems to fit the question.

Option E: John of the Cross. He was a Spanish Carmelite mystic and poet. He wrote about the dark night of the soul, which is a purification process. His focus was more on the journey through darkness to reach God, but I'm not sure if he described evil as a distortion revealing love.

Option F: Julian of Norwich. She was an English mystic who had visions and wrote about God's love. She's known for saying that "all shall be well," and her focus was more on God's unconditional love and the positive aspects of suffering. I don't think she specifically tied evil to being a distortion that reveals love more clearly.

Option G: Bernard of Clairvaux. He was a Cistercian monk and a significant figure in the 12th-century reform of the Church. He's known for his writings on the love of God and mystical experiences, particularly through the Virgin Mary. I'm not sure if he discussed evil in the context of distortion revealing divine love.

Option H: Ignatius of Loyola. He founded the Jesuits and wrote the Spiritual Exercises. His focus was on finding God in all things and discerning His will. Evil was more about sin and the devil's influence, but I don't recall him saying evil distorts to reveal divine love.

Option I: Francis of Assisi. He's known for his poverty and love for all creation. He saw God in all things, but his focus was more on living in harmony with nature and the poor. I don't think he discussed evil as a distortion revealing love.

Option J: Meister Eckhart. He was a German mystic and theologian, known for his teachings on the inner life and the union of the soul with God. He talked about the "still point" and the necessity of detachment. I'm not sure if he discussed evil in this specific way.

Putting it all together, the key is the idea that evil is a distortion that makes divine love more clear. Hildegard of Bingen (Option D) comes to mind because she discussed the interplay between good and evil, where evil serves as a contrast, thereby highlighting the divine love more distinctly. Her writings often emphasized the tension between light and darkness, good and evil, as part of God's creation, which might align with the idea that evil's distortion reveals divine love more clearly.

So, I think the answer is D: Hildegard of Bingen.
