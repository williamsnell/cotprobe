Question:

A 37-year-old woman with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8- kg (4-lb) weight loss. During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal≥500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?

Options:

A: Cryptosporidium parvum
B: Cytomegalovirus
C: Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex
D: Salmonella enteritidis

Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, it's about a 37-year-old woman with AIDS who's presenting with some symptoms. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, her main issues are progressive diarrhea for a month and significant weight loss of 1.8 kg. She's having six large watery stools daily. She's on triple antiretroviral therapy, which is good, but her CD4 count is 400/mm³. That's below the normal of 500, so her immune system is compromised, but not as severely as if it were lower.

She works as a flight attendant and flies both domestically and internationally to Asia monthly. That might be relevant because certain infections are more common in different regions. For example, Cryptosporidium is more prevalent in areas with poor sanitation, and Salmonella might come from undercooked food.

Looking at her vital signs: temperature is normal, 37°C, which is body temperature. Pulse is 88/min, which is a bit on the higher side but not dangerously high. Blood pressure is 112/64, which is normal. Her BMI is 22, which is on the lower end but not underweight.

The abdomen is scaphoid, which means it's concave, often seen in wasting or dehydration. No other exam findings, so no hepatosplenomegaly or other organ issues mentioned.

Now, the options are:

A: Cryptosporidium parvum
B: Cytomegalovirus
C: Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex
D: Salmonella enteritidis

I remember that in AIDS patients, certain infections are more common. For diarrhea, common causes include Cryptosporidium, which is a protozoan parasite that causes chronic diarrhea, especially in immunocompromised individuals. It's transmitted through water or food contaminated with feces.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) usually causes more systemic symptoms, like fever, and can affect multiple organs, but I'm not sure if it's the main cause of diarrhea in this case. Plus, CMV is more associated with things like colitis but might present with more severe symptoms.

Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) typically causes systemic infections, like disseminated disease, and might present with symptoms like night sweats, weight loss, and fevers, but not necessarily acute diarrhea. It's more about the organs getting involved.

Salmonella enteritidis is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, usually from contaminated food. It can be severe, but in someone with a CD4 count of 400, would it present with such chronic symptoms? Or is it more acute and self-limited?

Wait, but she's been having this for a month and lost weight. Salmonella might come from food poisoning, but usually, it's more of an acute illness. Unless it's a chronic carrier state, which is less common in immunocompromised patients, but I'm not sure.

Considering her job as a flight attendant, she's frequently traveling, which might expose her to different pathogens. Cryptosporidium is known to be a common cause of diarrhea in travelers, especially in areas with poor sanitation. Plus, with her CD4 count, her immune system isn't strong enough to fight it off, leading to a chronic infection.

Another point: watery stools. Cryptosporidium often causes that type of diarrhea. Salmonella might cause more of a mucoid or bloody stool, but I'm not certain. Also, Salmonella is more likely in someone who eats undercooked food, but her job involves traveling, so that's a possibility too.

But wait, CMV is a virus that can cause colitis, which can lead to diarrhea. But I think CMV is more about more severe symptoms and might present with other signs like fever, which she doesn't have. Her temp is normal.

MAC is more about systemic symptoms, so maybe not the first choice for diarrhea.

Putting it all together: she's immunocompromised, has chronic diarrhea, and travels a lot. The most likely is Cryptosporidium parvum. So the answer should be A.
</think>

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with AIDS presenting with progressive diarrhea and significant weight loss. She has a CD4 count of 400/mm³, placing her at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Her job as a flight attendant exposes her to various pathogens, including those in Asia, where Cryptosporidium parvum is prevalent. The symptoms of chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and scaphoid abdomen align with cryptosporidiosis, a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. Other options like Salmonella enteritidis are less likely due to the chronic nature of her symptoms and her travel history. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) are more associated with systemic symptoms, which are not prominent here. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Cryptosporidium parvum.
