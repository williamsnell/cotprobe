Okay, so I need to calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the beta minus particle emitted when He-6 undergoes radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in beta minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton, an electron (beta minus particle), and an antineutrino. The decay process can be written as:

n → p + e⁻ + \overline{\nu}_e

But wait, the specific decay for He-6. Let me think about the decay product. Helium has atomic number 2. So, He-6 has 6 nucleons, 2 protons, and 4 neutrons. When it decays, it probably becomes another isotope. Let me check: He-6 decays into Li-6, right? Because Li has atomic number 3. So the decay equation would be:

He-6 → Li-6 + beta^- + antineutrino.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me get the numbers straight. He-6 has Z=2, so protons=2, neutrons=4. After beta decay, a neutron becomes a proton. So the new nucleus should have Z=3, which is Li. So He-6 → Li-6 + beta^- + antineutrino. Wait, but Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So He-6 (mass number 6) decays into Li-6 (mass number 6), plus a beta particle and antineutrino. That makes sense because the mass number doesn't change (since a neutron is converted, not lost).

But wait, when a nucleus emits a beta minus, it's because a neutron turns into a proton, so the atomic number increases by 1. So He-6 (Z=2) becomes Li-6 (Z=3). Okay, that's correct.

Now, the next step is to calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle. I remember that in beta decay, the available energy is the Q-value of the decay. The Q-value is the total energy released in the decay, which is divided among the kinetic energies of the emitted particles: the beta particle, the antineutrino, and the recoiling nucleus.

But the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle occurs when all the Q-value energy goes to the beta particle, which is only possible when the nucleus is initially at rest and the other products (antineutrino and recoiling nucleus) share the energy. Wait, no, actually, in the rest frame of the nucleus, the maximum energy the beta particle can have is when the recoiling nucleus and antineutrino take away the least possible energy. But I think the maximum beta energy is when the nucleus recoils with the least possible momentum, which would be when all the energy goes into the beta particle. Or perhaps when the nucleus doesn't recoil at all, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is equal to the total Q-value of the decay minus the energy carried away by the antineutrino and the recoiling nucleus. But in the case of maximum energy, the recoiling nucleus would have zero kinetic energy, but that's not possible because the system must conserve momentum. So perhaps the maximum energy occurs when the nucleus recoils with the least possible energy, allowing the beta particle to take as much as possible.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the Q-value of the decay and then use that to find the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle.

So first, I need to find the Q-value of the decay He-6 → Li-6 + beta^- + antineutrino.

The Q-value is given by:

Q = [M(He-6) - M(Li-6) - M(beta^-) - M(antineutrino)] * c²

But wait, the antineutrino is very light, and for practical purposes, its rest mass is zero. Similarly, the electron (beta^-) has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So the equation becomes:

Q = [M(He-6) - M(Li-6) - M(e^-)] * c²

But I think I can look up the atomic masses of He-6 and Li-6.

Alternatively, I can use the mass excess energy. Let me recall that the mass of a nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the atomic masses, including electrons, because beta decay involves the nucleus as well as the electrons.

Wait, but for beta decay, the process involves the nucleus, so maybe using the nuclear masses is better. Let me think: the decay is n → p + e^- + antineutrino. So the Q-value would be based on the nuclear masses.

Alternatively, I can use the atomic masses. Let me see.

The atomic mass of He-6 is approximately known. I think the atomic mass of He-6 is about 6.017093 u. And the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.012750 u. Wait, but wait, atomic mass includes electrons, so when He-6 decays into Li-6 plus a beta particle, we have to account for the electrons in both the initial and final states.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the nuclear masses. Let me see:

Nuclear mass of He-6: He-6 has Z=2, so it has 2 protons and 4 neutrons. The mass can be calculated using the mass formula, but perhaps it's easier to look up approximate values.

Alternatively, I can find the Q-value using the atomic masses. Let me try that.

The atomic mass of He-6: 6.017093 u.

The atomic mass of Li-6: 6.012750 u.

But when He-6 decays into Li-6, the Li-6 will have one more proton, so perhaps the number of electrons changes. Wait, no, the decay process is:

He-6 → Li-6 + beta^- + antineutrino.

So, the He atom has 2 protons and 2 electrons. After decay, the Li atom has 3 protons and 3 electrons. But since a beta^- is emitted, the number of electrons increases by one. So the total number of electrons goes from 2 to 3, which matches Li's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the way to calculate the Q-value is using the atomic masses.

The decay equation in terms of atoms is:

^6_2He → ^6_3Li + beta^- + antineutrino.

But when considering atomic masses, the He atom has 2 electrons, and the Li atom has 3 electrons. The beta^- is an electron, so the total electrons after decay would be 3 (from Li) plus 1 (the beta^-), but that's not correct because the beta^- is emitted from the nucleus. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the atomic masses without the electrons, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the nuclear masses. The nuclear mass of He-6 is the mass of the He-6 nucleus, which is He-6 minus the mass of 2 electrons. Similarly, the nuclear mass of Li-6 is Li-6 minus 3 electrons.

So the nuclear mass of He-6 is M_He6_nucleus = M_He6_atom - 2 * m_e.

Similarly, M_Li6_nucleus = M_Li6_atom - 3 * m_e.

But wait, the beta decay equation is:

n → p + e^- + antineutrino.

So in terms of nuclei, the He-6 nucleus (which has Z=2) decays into a Li-6 nucleus (Z=3) plus a beta^- and antineutrino.

So the Q-value for the decay is:

Q = [M(He-6 nucleus) - M(Li-6 nucleus) - M(e^-)] * c²

Because the antineutrino is massless.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, I need the nuclear masses of He-6 and Li-6.

Alternatively, I can find the atomic masses and adjust for the electrons.

Let me look up approximate values:

Atomic mass of He-6: approximately 6.017093 u.

Atomic mass of Li-6: approximately 6.012750 u.

Electron mass, m_e = 0.00054858 u.

So the nuclear mass of He-6 is:

M_He6_nucleus = 6.017093 u - 2 * 0.00054858 u ≈ 6.017093 - 0.001097 ≈ 6.0160 u.

Similarly, the nuclear mass of Li-6 is:

M_Li6_nucleus = 6.012750 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u ≈ 6.012750 - 0.0016457 ≈ 6.011104 u.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. The He-6 nucleus is He-6 minus 2 electrons, and Li-6 nucleus is Li-6 minus 3 electrons.

So M_He6_nucleus = M_He6_atom - 2 * m_e.

M_He6_nucleus = 6.017093 u - 2*(0.00054858 u) = 6.017093 - 0.00109716 ≈ 6.015996 u.

M_Li6_nucleus = M_Li6_atom - 3 * m_e = 6.012750 u - 3*(0.00054858 u) = 6.012750 - 0.00164574 ≈ 6.011104 u.

Now, the Q-value is:

Q = [M_He6_nucleus - M_Li6_nucleus - M_e] * c².

M_e is the mass of the emitted electron, which is approximately 0.00054858 u (same as m_e).

So,

Q = (6.015996 u - 6.011104 u - 0.00054858 u) * c².

Calculating that:

6.015996 - 6.011104 = 0.004892 u.

0.004892 u - 0.00054858 u ≈ 0.00434342 u.

So Q = 0.00434342 u * c².

Now, I need to convert this mass deficit into energy. 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So,

Q ≈ 0.00434342 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 0.00434342 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that:

0.00434342 * 931.5 ≈ ?

First, 0.004 * 931.5 = 3.726 MeV.

0.00034342 * 931.5 ≈ approximately 0.320 MeV.

Adding together: 3.726 + 0.320 ≈ 4.046 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.05 MeV. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is less than the Q-value because some energy goes into the antineutrino and the recoiling nucleus.

Wait, but in the case of maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle, the antineutrino and the recoiling nucleus would take away the least possible energy, but I think the maximum energy the beta particle can have is approximately equal to the Q-value minus any energy needed for the recoiling nucleus. But in reality, the maximum energy occurs when the recoiling nucleus has the least possible kinetic energy, which is when it recoils in the opposite direction of the beta particle, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is equal to the total Q-value minus the rest mass of the electron, but wait, the Q-value already factors in the mass of the electron, so perhaps the maximum kinetic energy is just the Q-value.

Wait, no, the Q-value is the total energy available, which includes the kinetic energies of the beta particle, antineutrino, and any recoiling nucleus. So the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle would be when the recoiling nucleus has no kinetic energy, but that's only possible if the nucleus doesn't recoil, which isn't possible because of conservation of momentum. So the beta particle's maximum kinetic energy is a bit less than the Q-value.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should use the formula for the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle, which is given by:

K_beta_max = Q - (M_recoil * c²) * (something)

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The maximum kinetic energy occurs when the beta particle and the recoiling nucleus are emitted in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. But perhaps a simpler way is to use the fact that the maximum kinetic energy is when the nucleus doesn't recoil, but that's not physically possible because the nucleus must share momentum. So the maximum energy the beta particle can have is when the nucleus recoils with the smallest possible kinetic energy, which would be when the nucleus's kinetic energy is zero, but that's not possible due to momentum conservation. So perhaps the maximum kinetic energy is when the nucleus recoils with the least possible energy, which would be when it recoils at the lowest possible speed.

Alternatively, I remember that the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is approximately equal to the Q-value minus the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus. But since the recoiling nucleus has a much larger mass, its kinetic energy is small compared to the beta particle's. So the maximum kinetic energy is approximately equal to the Q-value.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the Q-value as approximately 4.05 MeV. But looking at the options, option F is 4.51 MeV, and option H is 6.51 MeV. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the masses.

Atomic mass of He-6: 6.017093 u.

Atomic mass of Li-6: 6.012750 u.

So the difference is 6.017093 - 6.012750 = 0.004343 u.

But wait, that's the difference in atomic masses. Now, the Q-value would be this difference minus the mass of the emitted electron, right? Because the electron is part of the decay products.

Wait no, the Q-value is (M_He6_nucleus - M_Li6_nucleus - M_e) * c².

But earlier, I calculated M_He6_nucleus as 6.015996 u, and M_Li6_nucleus as 6.011104 u. The difference is 0.004892 u. Then subtract M_e (0.00054858 u) to get 0.00434342 u.

So Q ≈ 0.00434342 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 4.046 MeV.

So the Q-value is approximately 4.05 MeV.

But the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle can't exceed this Q-value. However, the beta particle can't take all of it because the nucleus must recoil. So the maximum kinetic energy is less than 4.05 MeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 4.51 MeV, but that's higher than my calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the atomic masses I used are not accurate. Let me check more precise values.

Looking up more precise atomic masses:

He-6 atomic mass: 6.017093 u.

Li-6 atomic mass: 6.012750 u.

So the difference is 6.017093 - 6.012750 = 0.004343 u.

But wait, when He-6 decays, it emits a beta minus, which is an electron. So the decay equation in terms of atomic masses would be:

^6_2He → ^6_3Li + e^- + antineutrino.

But to calculate the Q-value, we can use:

Q = [M_He6 - M_Li6 - M_e] * c².

So,

Q = (6.017093 u - 6.012750 u - 0.00054858 u) * 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating the mass difference:

6.017093 - 6.012750 = 0.004343 u.

0.004343 - 0.00054858 = 0.00379442 u.

Now, multiply by 931.5 MeV/u:

0.00379442 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

0.00379442 * 900 ≈ 3.41498.

0.00379442 * 31.5 ≈ 0.120.

Total ≈ 3.415 + 0.120 ≈ 3.535 MeV.

Wait, that's about 3.535 MeV. So the Q-value is approximately 3.54 MeV.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers here. Earlier, I thought the Q-value was around 4.05 MeV, but now it's about 3.54 MeV. Which is correct?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I subtracted 2 electrons for He-6 and 3 electrons for Li-6, but when considering the decay, the He-6 atom has 2 electrons, and the Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. The beta particle is an additional electron. So the correct approach is to consider the atomic masses correctly.

So the correct formula for Q-value when using atomic masses is:

Q = [M_He6 - M_Li6 - M_e] * c².

Because the He atom has 2 electrons, and the Li atom has 3 electrons. The emitted beta particle is an additional electron. So the total electrons after decay are 3 (from Li) + 1 (beta) = 4, but the initial He had 2 electrons. Wait, no, the He atom has 2 electrons, and the Li has 3. The beta particle is emitted, so the initial He atom's electrons are 2, and the final Li has 3 electrons plus the beta particle. But I'm getting a bit confused about how to account for the electrons in the Q-value calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the nuclear masses, not the atomic masses. Let me try that.

Nuclear mass of He-6: M_He6_nucleus = M_He6_atom - 2 * m_e.

Nuclear mass of Li-6: M_Li6_nucleus = M_Li6_atom - 3 * m_e.

So,

Q = (M_He6_nucleus - M_Li6_nucleus - m_e) * c².

Plugging in the numbers:

M_He6_nucleus = 6.017093 - 2*(0.00054858) ≈ 6.017093 - 0.00109716 ≈ 6.015996 u.

M_Li6_nucleus = 6.012750 - 3*(0.00054858) ≈ 6.012750 - 0.00164574 ≈ 6.011104 u.

So,

Q = (6.015996 - 6.011104 - 0.00054858) * 931.5.

Calculating the mass difference:

6.015996 - 6.011104 = 0.004892 u.

0.004892 - 0.00054858 ≈ 0.00434342 u.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u:

0.00434342 * 931.5 ≈ 4.046 MeV.

So the Q-value is approximately 4.05 MeV.

But this doesn't match the earlier calculation using atomic masses. So I think using nuclear masses is the correct approach because beta decay involves the nucleus.

Now, the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is less than the Q-value because the nucleus recoils. But in many cases, the nucleus is much heavier, so the kinetic energy carried away by the nucleus is small. For example, in this case, the He-6 nucleus has a mass of about 6 atomic mass units, and the beta particle is negligible in mass. So the recoiling nucleus's kinetic energy would be much smaller than the beta particle's.

But to find the maximum kinetic energy, I think it's when the nucleus recoils with the smallest possible kinetic energy, which is when it recoils in the opposite direction of the beta particle, sharing the momentum. But I'm not sure of the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is equal to the Q-value minus the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus. But since the nucleus is heavy, its kinetic energy is small, so the maximum beta energy is approximately Q. But in reality, the beta particle's maximum energy is Q minus its rest mass energy, but wait, the rest mass is already accounted for in the Q-value calculation.

Wait, no, because the Q-value includes the mass of the electron. So the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is simply Q, but that can't be right because the nucleus must recoil.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle occurs when the nucleus recoils with the smallest possible momentum, which would be when the nucleus has the maximum possible recoil velocity. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, I remember that the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is given by:

K_max = (Q) * ( (M_recoil) ) / (M_recoil + m_e) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: the total energy available is Q. This energy is shared between the kinetic energies of the beta particle, the antineutrino, and the recoiling nucleus. To find the maximum energy of the beta particle, we can assume that the nucleus recoils with the least possible energy, which would be when it recoils in the opposite direction to the beta particle, but in reality, the maximum occurs when the nucleus recoils with zero kinetic energy, but that's not possible because of conservation of momentum.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

K_beta_max = Q * ( M_recoil ) / ( M_recoil + m_e )

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the conservation of momentum. The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momentum of the beta particle plus the momentum of the recoiling nucleus plus the momentum of the antineutrino must equal zero.

Assuming the antineutrino has negligible mass and energy, we can ignore its momentum contribution, but that's not exactly correct because the antineutrino does carry away momentum. However, for the sake of approximation, perhaps we can model it as the beta particle and the recoiling nucleus having equal and opposite momenta.

So,

p_beta = p_recoil.

The kinetic energy of the beta particle is K_beta = (p_beta)^2 / (2 m_e).

The kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus is K_recoil = (p_recoil)^2 / (2 M_recoil).

Since p_beta = p_recoil,

K_beta = (p^2) / (2 m_e),

K_recoil = (p^2) / (2 M_recoil).

The total energy from the Q-value is:

K_beta + K_recoil + E_antineutrino = Q.

But E_antineutrino is hard to calculate, so perhaps it's negligible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the antineutrino's energy is part of the Q-value.

Wait, no, the Q-value is the total energy released, which includes the kinetic energies of all the products. So,

Q = K_beta + K_recoil + E_antineutrino.

But to maximize K_beta, we can assume that E_antineutrino is as small as possible, which would be when the antineutrino carries away the least energy. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation for the beta particle and the recoiling nucleus.

Let me denote:

M_recoil = mass of the recoiling nucleus (He-6 nucleus, which is about 6 u).

m_e = mass of the electron (about 0.00054858 u).

E_beta = kinetic energy of beta particle + m_e c² (its rest energy).

E_recoil = kinetic energy of recoiling nucleus + M_recoil c².

But since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy before decay is M_recoil c².

After decay, the total energy is E_beta + E_recoil + E_antineutrino.

But this is getting too involved. Maybe I should look for a simpler approximation.

I think the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is approximately equal to the Q-value minus the rest mass of the electron. But wait, that would be:

K_max ≈ Q - m_e c².

But wait, the Q-value already includes the rest mass of the electron, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, no, the Q-value is calculated as:

Q = [M_He6_nucleus - M_Li6_nucleus - m_e] c².

So the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle would be when the recoil energy is zero, which would give K_beta_max = Q. But that's not possible because the nucleus must recoil.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum kinetic energy is approximately Q, but this would only be the case if the nucleus doesn't recoil, which isn't possible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find the answer by checking the options. If the Q-value is around 4.05 MeV, the maximum kinetic energy would be less than that. Looking at the options, option F is 4.51 MeV, which is higher than Q, so that can't be right. Option G is 3.51 MeV, which is close to my earlier calculation of 3.54 MeV. But wait, earlier when using atomic masses, I got Q ≈ 3.54 MeV, but using nuclear masses, I got 4.05 MeV.

I'm confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the maximum kinetic energy is given by the difference in binding energy.

Wait, another thought: the decay of He-6 is actually a positron decay? No, wait, He-6 has 4 neutrons and 2 protons. It's more likely to undergo beta minus decay to become Li-6.

But perhaps I should check the standard Q-values for this decay. I think I've heard that the Q-value for He-6 beta decay is about 0.51 MeV, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that seems too low.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up different isotopes. Let me think again.

He-6 has 6 nucleons, 2 protons, 4 neutrons. When it decays, a neutron converts into a proton, emitting a beta minus and an antineutrino. The resulting nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of He-6 is about 6.017093 u.

The mass of Li-6 is about 6.012750 u.

So the difference is about 0.004343 u, which is about 0.004343 * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 4.046 MeV.

So the Q-value is approximately 4.05 MeV.

Now, the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle would be when the recoiling nucleus has the least possible kinetic energy, which would be when the nucleus recoils with the smallest possible momentum, allowing the beta particle to take as much energy as possible.

But how much energy does the nucleus take? The nucleus's kinetic energy would be (p^2)/(2M), where p is the momentum of the nucleus, which equals the momentum of the beta particle (since momentum must be conserved).

Let me denote:

p = momentum of beta particle = momentum of nucleus.

The kinetic energy of the beta particle is K_beta = (p²)/(2m_e).

The kinetic energy of the nucleus is K_nucleus = (p²)/(2M).

The total energy available is Q = K_beta + K_nucleus + E_antineutrino.

But since the antineutrino's energy is part of the Q-value, perhaps the maximum K_beta is when the nucleus's kinetic energy is as small as possible, which would be when the nucleus recoils with the smallest possible p.

Wait, but the nucleus can't have zero momentum because the beta particle has momentum p, so the nucleus must have equal and opposite momentum.

So, the minimum possible kinetic energy for the nucleus is when p is as small as possible, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum K_beta occurs when the nucleus recoils with the smallest possible speed, which would be when the nucleus's kinetic energy is negligible compared to K_beta.

In that case, K_beta ≈ Q.

But earlier calculation gave Q ≈ 4.05 MeV.

Looking at the options, option F is 4.51 MeV, which is higher, so that can't be. Option H is 6.51 MeV, which is way higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the Q-value using more precise values.

He-6 atomic mass: 6.017093 u.

Li-6 atomic mass: 6.012750 u.

Electron mass: 0.00054858 u.

Using atomic masses, Q = (M_He6 - M_Li6 - m_e) * c².

So,

M_He6 - M_Li6 = 6.017093 - 6.012750 = 0.004343 u.

Subtract m_e: 0.004343 - 0.00054858 = 0.00379442 u.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u: 0.00379442 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Calculating,

0.00379442 * 900 = 3.41498 MeV.

0.00379442 * 31.5 ≈ 0.120 MeV.

Total ≈ 3.535 MeV.

So Q ≈ 3.535 MeV.

Hmm, but earlier using nuclear masses I got 4.05 MeV. Which is correct?

I think I should use the atomic masses because beta decay involves the atom, including electrons.

So with Q ≈ 3.535 MeV, the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle would be less than that, considering the nucleus's recoil.

But how much less? Let's model it.

Assume that the nucleus recoils with some kinetic energy K_nucleus.

The maximum K_beta occurs when the nucleus recoils with the smallest possible K_nucleus, which would be when the nucleus has the maximum possible momentum opposite to the beta particle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider the energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote:

M = mass of the nucleus (Li-6 nucleus, which is same as He-6 nucleus, about 6 u).

m = mass of beta particle (m_e ≈ 0.00054858 u).

E = Q = total energy available.

The energy conservation equation is:

K_beta + K_nucleus + E_antineutrino = E.

But to maximize K_beta, we can assume that the antineutrino's energy is as small as possible, perhaps zero, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the antineutrino carries away minimal energy, so most of E goes into K_beta and K_nucleus.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can use the following approximation: the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is approximately Q minus the kinetic energy of the nucleus. But since the nucleus is much heavier, its kinetic energy is small compared to the beta particle's.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distribution, perhaps the maximum K_beta is approximately equal to Q.

But earlier calculation using atomic masses gave Q ≈ 3.535 MeV, which is close to option C: 2.51 MeV or option F:4.51 MeV.

Wait, 3.535 MeV is closest to option G:3.51 MeV.

But looking back, when I used nuclear masses, I got Q ≈4.05 MeV, which is close to option F:4.51 MeV.

I'm getting conflicting results based on whether I use atomic or nuclear masses. I think the correct approach is to use the nuclear masses because the decay occurs at the nuclear level.

So with Q ≈4.05 MeV, the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle would be close to that, but a bit less because the nucleus recoils.

But looking at the options, the closest is option F:4.51 MeV. However, that's higher than Q, which can't be right because the beta particle can't have more energy than the Q-value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check:

Using nuclear masses:

M_He6_nucleus = 6.017093 - 2*0.00054858 ≈6.015996 u.

M_Li6_nucleus =6.012750 -3*0.00054858 ≈6.011104 u.

Difference:6.015996 -6.011104=0.004892 u.

Subtract m_e:0.004892 -0.00054858=0.00434342 u.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u:0.00434342 *931.5≈4.046 MeV.

So Q≈4.05 MeV.

Now, the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is less than Q. But none of the options are exactly 4.05 MeV. The closest is option F:4.51 MeV, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Another way to calculate the Q-value is to use the binding energy.

The binding energy per nucleon for He-6 is about 6.017093 u - (2*1.007276 +4*0.939565) u.

Calculating:

2 protons: 2 *1.007276=2.014552 u.

4 neutrons:4 *0.939565=3.75826 u.

Total mass of nucleons:2.014552+3.75826=5.772812 u.

Mass defect:6.017093 -5.772812=0.244281 u.

Binding energy:0.244281 u *931.5 MeV/u≈227.5 MeV.

But wait, that's the total binding energy for He-6. Similarly, for Li-6:

Z=3, N=3.

Mass of nucleons:3*1.007276 +3*0.939565=3.021828 +2.818695=5.840523 u.

Mass of Li-6 nucleus:6.012750 u (atomic mass) minus 3 electrons (3*0.00054858)=6.012750 -0.00164574≈6.011104 u.

Mass defect:6.011104 -5.840523=0.170581 u.

Binding energy:0.170581 *931.5≈158.8 MeV.

So the Q-value is the difference in binding energies:227.5 -158.8≈68.7 MeV.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the Q-value way too high, which contradicts the earlier calculation.

I think I'm confusing the binding energy approach. The Q-value for beta decay isn't the same as the binding energy difference. Beta decay doesn't involve the binding energy in the same way as fission or fusion.

I think I should stick with the earlier approach using atomic or nuclear masses.

Given that using nuclear masses gives Q≈4.05 MeV, and using atomic masses gives Q≈3.53 MeV, but considering that beta decay involves the nucleus, the correct Q should be around 4.05 MeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option F:4.51 MeV, which is higher than Q. That can't be right because the beta particle can't have more energy than Q.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the exact masses again.

He-6 atomic mass:6.017093 u.

Li-6 atomic mass:6.012750 u.

Electron mass:0.00054858 u.

So,

Q = (6.017093 -6.012750 -0.00054858) *931.5.

= (0.004343 -0.00054858) *931.5.

=0.00379442 *931.5 ≈3.535 MeV.

So Q≈3.535 MeV.

Now, the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is less than this. But looking at the options, the closest is option C:2.51 MeV, which is about 3/4 of Q. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor here.

Wait, another approach: the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is given by:

K_max = (Q) * (M_recoil)/(M_recoil + m_e).

But I'm not sure if that's the correct formula.

Alternatively, using the relation:

K_beta_max = (Q²) / (4 M_recoil c²) ).

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

K_beta_max = (Q) * ( (M_recoil) ) / (M_recoil + m_e) )

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, considering that the nucleus recoils with velocity v, and the beta particle has velocity u.

Conservation of momentum:

M_recoil * v = m_e * u.

Energy conservation:

(1/2) M_recoil v² + (1/2) m_e u² = Q.

Substituting v = (m_e u)/(M_recoil).

So,

(1/2) M_recoil ( (m_e² u²)/(M_recoil²) ) + (1/2) m_e u² = Q.

Simplify:

( m_e² u² )/(2 M_recoil ) + ( m_e u² )/2 = Q.

Factor out (m_e u²)/2:

( m_e u² )/2 [ m_e / M_recoil + 1 ] = Q.

Let me denote x = m_e u².

Then,

x/2 [ m_e / M_recoil + 1 ] = Q.

Solving for x:

x = 2 Q / (1 + m_e / M_recoil ).

But m_e/M_recoil is very small (≈0.00054858 /6 ≈0.00009143), so approximately,

x ≈ 2 Q.

But x = m_e u² → u² = x/m_e = (2 Q)/m_e.

So,

K_beta = (1/2) m_e u² = (1/2) m_e * (2 Q/m_e ) ) = Q.

Wait, that suggests that K_beta_max = Q, which can't be right because then the nucleus wouldn't recoil. So perhaps this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

K_beta_max = (Q) * ( (M_recoil) ) / (M_recoil + m_e ) ).

Plugging in M_recoil =6 u, m_e=0.00054858 u.

So,

K_beta_max ≈ Q * (6)/(6 +0.00054858) ≈ Q * (6/6.00054858) ≈ Q * (0.99991) ≈ Q.

So this suggests that the beta particle's maximum kinetic energy is approximately equal to Q, which is about 3.53 MeV.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option C:2.51 MeV and option G:3.51 MeV.

But 3.53 MeV is very close to option G:3.51 MeV.

So the correct answer should be option G:3.51 MeV.

To calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the β⁻ emitted in the radioactive decay of He-6, we analyze the decay process:

**Decay Process**:  
He-6 undergoes beta-minus decay to become Li-6, emitting a β⁻ particle and an antineutrino. The decay equation is:  
\[
^6_2\text{He} \rightarrow ^6_3\text{Li} + \beta^- + \overline{\nu}_e
\]

**Q-value Calculation**:  
The Q-value of the decay is the total energy released, calculated using the atomic masses of He-6 and Li-6, and the rest mass of the electron (\(m_e\)):  
\[
Q = \left[ M(^6_2\text{He}) - M(^6_3\text{Li}) - m_e \right] c^2
\]  
Using approximate atomic masses:  
- \(M(^6_2\text{He}) = 6.017093 \, \text{u}\)  
- \(M(^6_3\text{Li}) = 6.012750 \, \text{u}\)  
- \(m_e = 0.00054858 \, \text{u}\)  

\[
Q = \left[ 6.017093 - 6.012750 - 0.00054858 \right] \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u}
\]  
\[
Q = \left[ 0.004343 - 0.00054858 \right] \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u}
\]  
\[
Q = 0.00379442 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 3.535 \, \text{MeV}
\]

**Maximum Kinetic Energy of β⁻**:  
The maximum kinetic energy of the β⁻ particle is approximately equal to the Q-value, as the recoiling nucleus (Li-6) has a much larger mass and thus carries away negligible kinetic energy. Therefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the β⁻ particle is approximately:  
\[
K_{\beta, \text{max}} \approx Q \approx 3.535 \, \text{MeV}
\]

**Comparison with Options**:  
The closest option to the calculated value of \(3.535 \, \text{MeV}\) is **G: 3.51 MeV**.

**Answer**:  
G
