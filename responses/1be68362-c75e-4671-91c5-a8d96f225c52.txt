This question refers to the following information.
"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal."
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921

Okay, so I'm faced with a question about historical developments that inspired Gandhi's instructions to boycott foreign cloth. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is referring to the fifth paragraph of the message from Mahatma Gandhi. The key instruction here is the call to "completely boycott foreign cloth" and to take up spinning or weaving during spare time. This immediately makes me think of the Swadeshi movement, which was a significant part of Gandhi's strategy during the Indian independence movement.

Now, the question is asking which historical event from 1450–1750 C.E. most inspired this instruction. Let's look at the options provided:

A: The spread of the Black Death in Europe. I'm not sure how the Black Death would relate directly to Gandhi's call for boycotting foreign cloth. The Black Death was a major pandemic in the 14th century, but the time frame here is 1450–1750, so maybe it's not the most relevant.

B: The discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus. This happened in 1492 and led to the Age of Exploration. The discovery opened up new trade routes, including the import of goods like cotton from India to Europe. However, I'm not immediately seeing a direct link to Gandhi's call for Swadeshi.

C: The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires. This happened during the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire, which was around the 13th to 18th centuries. The Mughals did have trade relations, including with Europe. But how does this relate to boycotting foreign cloth? Maybe through the impact of Mughal rule on Indian textile industries, but I'm not sure.

D: The rise of absolute monarchies in Europe. This was prevalent during the 16th to 18th centuries. Absolute monarchies would have controlled trade policies, possibly leading to mercantilism. But again, how does this tie into Gandhi's message?

E: The invention of the printing press. This was by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. It spread knowledge and宗教 reforms, like the Protestant Reformation. Not directly related to cloth boycotts.

F: The Scientific Revolution. Occurred in the 16th to 18th centuries. It led to technological advancements, but not directly connected to economic policies like Swadeshi.

G: The importation of food crops from the New World. This started with Columbus's voyages and included crops like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes. It increased food availability in Europe but doesn't seem linked to cloth boycotts.

H: The Protestant Reformation. Started in the early 16th century. It led to religious changes and, indirectly, some economic changes. But I don't see the connection to Gandhi's call for Swadeshi.

I: The African slave trade. This was active from the 15th to 19th centuries. The transatlantic slave trade was a major economic force, but again, not directly tied to cloth boycotts in India.

J: The development of joint-stock companies. These emerged in the 16th century, with companies like the East India Company. Joint-stock companies facilitated large-scale trade, including textiles. The East India Company had a monopoly on Indian textiles in Britain, which affected the Indian economy.

Wait, that's a key point. The East India Company's control over Indian textile exports would have led to the decline of local industries in India. By the 19th century, India's textile industry was in decline because British factories were producing cheaper cloth, and the Company's policies might have disrupted local production. So, when Gandhi called for a boycott of foreign cloth, he was encouraging people to spin and weave their own, supporting local industries and reducing dependence on British goods.

But the question is about the period 1450–1750. The joint-stock companies, especially the East India Company, were developing during this time. Their rise allowed for the expansion of British trade with India, which eventually led to the economic policies that Gandhi was opposing. So, the development of joint-stock companies probably inspired the Swadeshi movement's call to boycott foreign cloth because it was part of the broader economic exploitation that Gandhi sought to resist.

Alternatively, thinking about the period when joint-stock companies were established—like the late 16th century onwards—they played a role in the mercantile expansion that affected India's economy. By the time of the Swadeshi movement in the early 20th century, the legacy of these companies' policies would have influenced the need for self-reliance in production.

So, putting it together, the development of joint-stock companies (option J) is the most likely answer because it relates to the economic structures that Gandhi was opposing when he called for boycotting foreign cloth and promoting local industries.

The historical development that most inspired Gandhi's instructions to boycott foreign cloth was the rise of joint-stock companies, particularly the East India Company, which facilitated British economic dominance and exploitation in India. This led to the decline of local textile industries, prompting Gandhi to advocate for self-reliance through the Swadeshi movement.
