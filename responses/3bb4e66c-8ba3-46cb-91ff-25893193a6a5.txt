Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this Socrates question. Let me start by recalling what I know about Socrates and his philosophy. Socrates was a classical Greek philosopher who emphasized the importance of self-examination and understanding one's own life. He often talked about the concept of "examined life" and how it relates to virtue and happiness.

The question is asking about Socrates' view on the dependence of life's value on understanding the principles of human existence. It says that without such knowledge, life lacks virtue because of one of the given options. So I need to find which option best reflects Socrates' reasoning.

Looking at the options:

A: Understanding existence philosophically leads to personal satisfaction. Hmm, this seems related but maybe not exactly what Socrates emphasized. He was more about self-examination leading to virtue rather than just satisfaction.

B: One's life lacks virtue if they don't contribute to society. I'm not sure if Socrates focused on societal contribution as the main point. He was more about individual knowledge and self-awareness.

C: Ignorance is a virtue in itself, as it leads to humility. That sounds counter to Socratic thought. Socrates believed in seeking knowledge and wisdom, so this seems opposite.

D: Philosophical understanding isn't necessary as long as one is happy. Socrates would disagree because he stressed the importance of understanding to live a good life, not just happiness.

E: Acting virtuously means acting in a way that's informed about what one is doing and why. This sounds promising. Socrates often linked virtue with knowledge, suggesting that to act virtuously, one must know the right reasons.

F: Virtue is irrelevant to the quality of life. Socrates definitely believed virtue was central, so this is incorrect.

G: Someone who doesn't understand existence philosophically could never do anything right. That's a strong statement, but I don't recall Socrates saying that; he focused more on the importance of understanding for virtuous action rather than inability to act correctly.

H: Not only is virtue knowledge, but also the unexamined life is not worth living. This rings a bell. Socrates is famous for saying, "The unexamined life is not worth living," which ties into the idea that understanding (knowledge) is essential for virtue.

I: The value of life is determined by personal wealth and status. Definitely not Socratic; he focused on inner virtue and knowledge, not external factors.

J: To have the power or ability to do anything requires knowing what we're doing. This is related but perhaps more about action than virtue. Socrates linked knowledge with virtue more directly.

Now, comparing E and H. The question is why life lacks virtue without such knowledge. Socrates' statement about the unexamined life directly ties into the necessity of understanding principles for a life of virtue. He emphasized that without self-examination and understanding, one cannot live virtuously. 

Option E talks about acting virtuously being informed, which is true, but option H directly quotes Socrates' assertion about the unexamined life, which fits the context of the question. The question is about the absence of knowledge leading to a lack of virtue, which H addresses more directly by stating that the unexamined life isn't worth living, implying that without examination (knowledge), life lacks virtue.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is H: Not only is virtue knowledge but also the unexamined life is not worth living. This reflects Socrates' emphasis on the necessity of understanding principles for a virtuous life, as he famously stated that the unexamined life lacks value.
