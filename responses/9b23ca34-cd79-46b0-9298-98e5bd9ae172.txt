Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about neural networks and specific models. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has two statements:

1. Industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs.
2. The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.

I need to determine if each statement is true or false and then look at the options provided.

Starting with Statement 1: Industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs.

Hmm, I remember that GPUs are known for their parallel processing power, which is crucial for training large neural networks. CPUs are more general-purpose and slower for such tasks. So, I think that industrial-scale training, especially for big models, uses GPUs or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Therefore, Statement 1 is probably false.

Now, Statement 2: The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number of parameters in ResNet models. I recall that ResNet-50 is a medium-sized model. Let me think: ResNet-50 has 50 layers, right? Each layer adds some parameters. I think a ResNet-50 has around 25 million parameters. Wait, that's way less than a billion. On the other hand, models like ResNet-152 are larger, maybe around 60 million parameters. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong because sometimes people count parameters differently. Wait, another thought: maybe the number is higher. Let me check my memory. Oh wait, I think I might be confusing ResNet with other models. Wait, no, I think ResNet-50 is about 25.5 million parameters. So Statement 2 is false.

So, both statements are false.

Looking at the options:

A: False, True for ResNet-101 model only → No, because both are false, and this says Statement 2 is true for ResNet-101 only, but I think both statements are false.

B: True, True for ResNet-152 model only → No, because Statement 1 is false.

C: False, False for ResNet-101 model only → Hmm, but if both statements are false, the option should say Statement 2 is false for ResNet-50. Wait, option C says Statement 2 is false for ResNet-101 only. But the question is about Statement 2 being about ResNet-50. So this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Options are about the two statements being true or false, and for Statement 2, whether it's true for ResNet-101 or ResNet-152. Wait, no, the options are phrased as:

Each option starts with a choice for Statement 1 (True/False) and then for Statement 2.

Wait, no, looking again:

The options are:

A: False, True for ResNet-101 model only
B: True, True for ResNet-152 model only
C: False, False for ResNet-101 model only
D: True, True
E: True, False for ResNet-101 model only
F: False, False for ResNet-152 model only
G: False, False
H: True, False
I: True, True for ResNet-101 model only
J: False, True

Wait, perhaps I misread the question earlier. The statements are about ResNet-50 and ResNet-101. Let me recheck.

Wait, the question is:

Statement 2 says "The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters." So the option J says Statement 2 is true, which would be incorrect because ResNet-50 has about 25 million. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, so the two statements:

Statement 1: False (industrial training uses GPUs)
Statement 2: False (ResNet-50 does not have over 1B params)

So looking at the options, which one says both are false?

Option G: False, False → That would be correct if both are false.

Wait, but let me check again about ResNet-50's parameters.

I think I'm right. Let me see: according to some sources, ResNet-50 has about 25.5 million parameters. So over 1 billion is way off. So Statement 2 is false.

Thus, both statements are false, so the correct option is G: False, False.

Wait, but I need to make sure that none of the other options fit better. Let me check the other options:

Option G is False for both. So that's correct.

The first statement is false because industrial-scale neural networks are typically trained on GPUs, not CPUs. The second statement is also false because ResNet-50 has approximately 25.5 million parameters, not over 1 billion. Therefore, both statements are false.
