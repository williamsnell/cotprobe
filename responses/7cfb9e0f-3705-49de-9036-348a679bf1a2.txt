Question:

What is utility? What is marginal utility?

Options:

A: Utility is the measure of usefulness or pleasure. Marginal utility is the decrease in usefulness or pleasure as more units are consumed.
B: Utility is the quantity of a product. Marginal utility is the increase in quantity which a consumer gets from an additional unit of a specific good.
C: Utility is the power to satisfy a want. Marginal utility is the extra utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.
D: Utility is the duration of time a product can be used. Marginal utility is the increase in usage time with each additional unit consumed.
E: Utility is the measure of scarcity of a good. Marginal utility is the change in scarcity when one more unit of the good is produced.
F: Utility is the weight of a product. Marginal utility is the additional weight a consumer perceives when purchasing an extra unit of a specific good.
G: Utility is the power to make a good. Marginal utility is the extra power which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.
H: Utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount of a good. Marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from the last unit consumed, holding the level of consumption constant.
I: Utility is the price of a good. Marginal utility is the increase in price which a consumer pays for an additional unit of a specific good.
J: Utility is the demand for a product. Marginal utility is the change in demand as the supply of a specific good increases.

Okay, so I've got this question about utility and marginal utility, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

First, I remember that utility in economics refers to the satisfaction or happiness that a consumer gets from consuming a good or service. So, utility is like measuring how useful or pleasurable something is to a person. Marginal utility, on the other hand, is about the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of that good or service.

Looking at the options:

Option A says utility is the measure of usefulness or pleasure, which sounds right. Then marginal utility is the decrease in usefulness or pleasure as more units are consumed. Wait, that's about decreasing marginal utility, which is a concept I know. But does marginal utility specifically refer to the decrease, or is it just the additional utility regardless of whether it's increasing or decreasing? I think marginal utility can also be positive or negative, not just a decrease. So maybe A is too narrow.

Option B says utility is the quantity of a product, which doesn't sound right. Quantity is more about how much you have, not the satisfaction. Marginal utility here is about the increase in quantity a consumer gets, which is also wrong because marginal utility is about satisfaction, not quantity.

Option C: Utility is the power to satisfy a want. I think that's correct because utility is the satisfaction of wants. Then marginal utility is the extra satisfaction from an additional unit. That sounds accurate. So C could be the right choice.

Option D talks about duration of use, which doesn't fit. Utility isn't about how long you can use something, but the satisfaction from using it.

Option E mentions scarcity. I don't think utility is about scarcity; it's about the satisfaction. So E is probably wrong.

Option F is about weight, which seems unrelated. Utility isn't about physical measures like weight.

Option G says utility is the power to make a good. That doesn't make sense. Marginal utility here is about extra power, which also doesn't fit.

Option H describes utility as total satisfaction from a certain amount, which is correct. Marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, keeping consumption constant. Wait, that's another way to think about it. So H might also be correct. I need to compare C and H.

Option I talks about price, which is unrelated. Utility isn't about price.

Option J mentions demand and supply changes, which is more about market dynamics, not individual satisfaction.

So between C and H. Let me think. The standard definition is that utility is the total satisfaction, but some sources define it as the ability to satisfy wants. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from one more unit.

Option C says utility is the power to satisfy a want, which is another way of phrasing it. Marginal utility is the extra satisfaction from an additional unit. That's correct.

Option H says utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount, and marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, keeping consumption constant. That's also correct. So now I'm a bit confused because both C and H seem right, but maybe they are different perspectives.

Wait, the question is asking for both definitions. Let me check each option again.

In option C, the second part is about the extra utility from an additional unit. That's exactly what marginal utility is. In H, the marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, which is another way of saying the same thing because the last unit is one more than the previous.

So both C and H correctly define marginal utility. But the first part of the question is about utility. Does C define utility correctly? C says it's the power to satisfy a want. That's correct. H says utility is the total satisfaction received, which is also correct.

So I have two options that seem correct. How do I choose between them?

Looking at the options again, the question is "What is utility? What is marginal utility?" So both parts need to be correct. Let me check each option.

Option C: Utility is the power to satisfy a want. Marginal utility is the extra satisfaction from an additional unit. That's accurate.

Option H: Utility is the total satisfaction. Marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, keeping consumption constant. That's also correct.

Wait, but the wording might be different. In economics, utility is often considered as a measure of satisfaction, so H's first part is correct. Marginal utility is the change in total utility from an additional unit, which is the same as the satisfaction from the last unit when keeping consumption constant.

So both C and H seem correct, but perhaps the options are structured so that only one is correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: Utility is the power to satisfy a want. Marginal utility is the extra utility from an additional unit.

Option H: Utility is the total satisfaction. Marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, holding consumption constant.

Hmm. Both could be correct, but I think the standard definition is that utility is the total satisfaction, and marginal is the additional. So H might be the better option.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that utility is a measure of satisfaction, so H's first part is correct. But C's first part is also correct because utility is the power to satisfy wants. So perhaps both C and H are correct in their own ways, but looking for the best match.

Wait, but looking at the second parts. Option C says marginal utility is the extra utility from an additional unit, which is correct. Option H says marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, which is the same as the additional unit. So both are correct.

But the options are structured so that each option defines both terms. So perhaps the correct answer is C because it defines utility as the power to satisfy wants and marginal utility as the extra. Alternatively, H defines utility as total satisfaction and marginal as the last unit.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C. Because I think that's how it's typically taught: utility is the satisfaction (or the power to satisfy), and marginal is the additional.

Alternatively, maybe H is correct because it more precisely defines the marginal utility as the last unit's contribution.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of some notes. Utility is the total satisfaction, and marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from one more unit. So H's first part is correct, and the second part is correct as well. So H might be the right answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way to check: marginal utility is the derivative of the total utility function, which is the change in total utility when you consume one more unit. So it's the additional utility, which is what C says. So perhaps C is correct.

Wait, but in H, the marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit, which is the same as the additional unit when you hold consumption constant. So both are correct, but perhaps H is more precise in defining marginal utility as the last unit's contribution.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is C because it's more concise and accurate.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The standard definition is that marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit. So option C's second part is correct. For the first part, utility is the power to satisfy wants, which is correct.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The question asks about the definitions of utility and marginal utility. Utility refers to the satisfaction or pleasure derived from consuming a good or service, and marginal utility is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of that good or service. 

Option C correctly defines utility as the power to satisfy a want and marginal utility as the extra satisfaction from an additional unit. Option H also provides accurate definitions but focuses on total satisfaction and the last unit's contribution. However, the more precise and widely accepted definition aligns with Option C, as marginal utility is fundamentally about the additional utility from consuming one more unit.

Answer: C
