Question:

A 20-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting. She says that today she noticed a slight amount of blood in her vomit.

Okay, so I've got this question about a 20-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with nausea and vomiting for two days, and she noticed a bit of blood in her vomit today. She's a pre-med student under a lot of stress because of final exams and drinks a lot of coffee. Her vital signs are normal.

Hmm, the question is asking for the most appropriate initial test. Let's think through this.

First, her symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis (blood in the vomit). She's young, so that's a bit concerning because in older adults, GI bleeding could be from various causes, but in a 20-year-old, maybe something else is going on.

She drinks a lot of coffee. So, maybe she's on some medications or has reflux? But she doesn't mention any other symptoms like chest pain or heartburn. The stress could be a factorâ€”maybe causing stress ulcers? Or perhaps she's taking NSAIDs, but she didn't mention that. Wait, she's a pre-med student, maybe she's taking some study aids or other substances? But the question doesn't specify that.

Her vital signs are normal, so it's not an acute, life-threatening situation. But the presence of blood in the vomit is concerning. It suggests a possible upper GI bleed. Upper GI bleeds can come from peptic ulcers, gastritis, esophageal varices (but that's more in cirrhotics, and she doesn't have a history of liver issues mentioned), or maybe a Mallory-Weiss tear from vomiting.

So, initial tests. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Esophagram (barium swallow). That's a radiological test where you drink barium and they take X-rays. It can show strictures, obstructions, or other issues in the esophagus. But if she's vomiting blood, maybe an upper endoscopy would be better to directly visualize the esophagus and stomach.

Option B: Urine pregnancy test. She's a female, but unless there's a concern for ectopic pregnancy or something, but her symptoms are more GI. Maybe if she's of childbearing age, but the question doesn't mention any gynecological symptoms. Probably not the first choice here.

Option C: Abdominal flat plate radiography. That's just a plain X-ray. It can show things like obstruction, but if she's vomiting blood, it's more about the upper GI. A flat plate might not be the most direct test.

Option D: Blood alcohol level. She drinks a lot of coffee, but unless she's suspected of alcohol intoxication or overdose, this might not be necessary. The question doesn't mention any signs of alcohol use beyond coffee, which is a stimulant, but not an indication for blood alcohol.

Option E: Amylase level. Amylase is elevated in pancreatitis. She has nausea and vomiting, which can occur in pancreatitis, but without other symptoms like abdominal pain, especially in the epigastric region radiating to the back, or recent gallstones, it's less likely. Plus, the blood in the vomit is more suggestive of GI bleeding.

Option F: Thyroid function tests. Her symptoms don't point towards a thyroid issue. She's under stress, which can cause non-thyroidal issues, but this seems unrelated.

Option G: Liver function tests. If there were signs of liver disease, like jaundice, ascites, or encephalopathy, but she doesn't have those. Plus, the blood in the vomit is more about GI than liver function.

Option H: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This directly visualizes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It's the gold standard for evaluating upper GI bleeding. Since she has hematemesis, this seems like a strong candidate.

Option I: Complete blood count. A CBC would show if she's anemic, which could be a result of the bleeding. But it's not diagnostic of where the bleeding is coming from. It's useful but maybe not the initial test.

Option J: Stool culture. That's for infectious causes of diarrhea or GI issues. She's vomiting, not having diarrhea, and the blood is in the vomit, not stool, so this might not be relevant.

So, putting it all together. The main issue here is the presence of blood in the vomit, which suggests an upper GI source. The most direct and appropriate initial test would be an upper GI endoscopy (Option H). It allows visualization and can even treat the source if it's something like a bleeding ulcer.

Other tests like CBC (I) might be done to assess for anemia, but they're not the most immediate. Urine tests (B) and imaging (C, A) are less direct. So, the best initial test is H: upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

The most appropriate initial test to order is an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (H) to directly visualize and evaluate the source of the upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Answer: H
