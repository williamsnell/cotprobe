Question:

Two computers communicate with each other by sending data packets across a local area network. The size of these packets is 1,000 bytes.

The maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is approximately

Okay, so I've got this question about computer networks and data transfer rates. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that two computers are communicating over a local area network. Each data packet is 1,000 bytes. The network can carry 1,000 packets per second. Also, the CPU time needed to send one packet is 10 milliseconds. I need to find the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another.

Hmm, so I think the key here is to figure out how much data can be sent per second, considering both the network's capacity and the CPU time required for each packet.

First, the network can handle 1,000 packets every second. Each packet is 1,000 bytes, so the maximum data transfer rate without considering CPU time would be 1,000 packets/s * 1,000 bytes/packet = 1,000,000 bytes/second. But wait, that's just the network's capacity. But there's also the CPU time involved.

The CPU takes 10 milliseconds to send each packet. Let me convert that to seconds because the network's capacity is given per second. 10 milliseconds is 0.01 seconds. So, for each packet, it takes 0.01 seconds of CPU time.

Now, I'm a bit confused. Do I need to consider how many packets can be processed by the CPU in a second? Because if each packet takes 0.01 seconds, then the number of packets the CPU can handle per second is 1 / 0.01 = 100 packets per second. Wait, that can't be right because the network can handle 1,000 packets per second. So maybe the CPU is the bottleneck here.

Wait, let me think again. If the CPU can only process 100 packets per second (because 10 ms per packet is 100 per second), but the network can handle 1,000 packets per second, then the CPU is the limiting factor. That is, the CPU can't send more than 100 packets per second, even if the network could handle more.

So, the actual data rate would be based on the CPU's processing speed. So 100 packets per second, each 1,000 bytes, would be 100 * 1,000 = 100,000 bytes per second. So that would be 100 Kbps.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options exactly. Let me check the options again. Option H is 100,000 bytes/second, which matches this calculation. But wait, I think I made a mistake here because the network can handle 1,000 packets per second, but the CPU can only handle 100 per second. So the maximum rate would be limited by the CPU.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the CPU time. Perhaps the 10 ms is the time per packet, so how many packets can the CPU send in a second? 1,000 milliseconds in a second, so 1,000 / 10 = 100 packets per second. So same as before.

So the data rate would be 100 packets/s * 1,000 bytes/packet = 100,000 bytes/s, which is option H.

Wait, but some sources say that the maximum throughput is determined by the minimum of the network's capacity and the CPU's processing rate. So in this case, network is 1,000 packets/s, CPU can handle 100 packets/s. So the limiting factor is the CPU, so the maximum is 100 packets/s, leading to 100,000 bytes/s.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since each packet takes 10 ms to process, the number of packets that can be sent per second is 100, as each packet takes 0.01 seconds. So 100 packets/s * 1000 bytes = 100,000 bytes/s.

Wait, but the network can handle 1,000 packets/s. So if the CPU can only send 100 packets/s, the network isn't the bottleneck. So the maximum data rate is 100,000 bytes/s, which is option H.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the network's capacity is in terms of bandwidth, and the CPU time is about processing each packet. So perhaps the CPU time affects how many packets can be sent per second, which in turn affects the overall throughput.

Another angle: The network can carry 1,000 packets per second, but if the CPU can't send that many due to processing time, then the actual data rate is limited by the CPU. So, 100 packets/s * 1000 bytes = 100,000 bytes/s.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be H: 100,000 bytes/second.
</think>

The maximum rate is determined by the CPU's processing capacity, which limits the number of packets that can be sent per second. With 10 ms per packet, the CPU can handle 100 packets per second. Each packet is 1,000 bytes, so the data rate is 100 * 1,000 = 100,000 bytes/second.

Answer: H
