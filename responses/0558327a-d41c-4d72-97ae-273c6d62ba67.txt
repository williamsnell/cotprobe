Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an ideal battery and a circuit's power dissipation when the resistance changes. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an ideal battery with a constant voltage V is supplying current to a circuit with total resistance R. Then, R is doubled, and we need to find out what happens to the total power dissipated by the circuit.

Hmm, I remember that power in an electrical circuit can be calculated using different formulas. The one that comes to mind is P = V * I, where V is voltage and I is current. But since the battery is ideal, I think Ohm's Law applies here too, right? Ohm's Law states that V = I * R. So maybe I can express current in terms of V and R.

Wait, if V is constant, and R changes, how does the current change? Let me think. Ohm's Law says I = V/R. So if R doubles, the current should halve because the same voltage divided by a larger resistance gives a smaller current. That makes sense.

Now, power can also be written using P = I² * R. So if I plug in the new resistance, which is 2R, and the new current, which is I/2, let's calculate the new power.

Original power, P_initial, is I² * R. The new power, P_new, would be (I/2)² * (2R). Let me compute that: (I² /4) * 2R = (I² R) / 2. So the new power is half of the original power. Oh, wait, so the power decreases by a factor of 2, meaning it's halved.

Wait, another way to look at it is using P = V² / R. The original power is V²/R. When R doubles, the new power is V²/(2R) which is indeed half of the original. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

So when the resistance doubles, the power dissipated becomes half. Looking back at the options, option D says it will be halved. That should be the correct answer.

When the resistance R is doubled, the power dissipated in the circuit is halved. 

Answer: D
