Okay, so I need to figure out how much Best County should report as revenues in its capital projects fund at the end of the year. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me the receipts during the year for the capital projects fund. The receipts are broken down into three parts: a transfer from the general fund, a federal capital grant, and a special assessment for capital improvements.

So the amounts are:
- Transfer from general fund: $100,000
- Federal capital grant: $75,000
- Special assessment: $300,000

I remember that in governmental accounting, especially for funds like the capital projects fund, the revenues come from various sources. Now, I need to determine which of these receipts are considered revenues.

First, I think about what each of these represents. A transfer from the general fund is typically an internal transfer within the government. In fund accounting, transfers between funds aren't considered revenues because they're just moving money from one fund to another. So the $100,000 transfer might not count as revenue for the capital projects fund.

Next, the federal capital grant is probably a grant, which is a form of revenue. Grants are usually considered revenues because they're funds received from outside the government, right? So that $75,000 would be counted.

Then there's the special assessment for capital improvements. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Special assessments are usually a type of charge or tax levied specifically for a particular purpose, like capital improvements. In accounting terms, special assessments are typically considered revenues because they're a source of money coming in for a specific project or purpose. So that $300,000 would also count as revenue.

So adding up the revenues: $75,000 (grant) + $300,000 (special assessment) = $375,000. The transfer from the general fund doesn't add to revenue because it's an internal transfer, not an external inflow.

Wait, but sometimes transfers can be considered in some contexts. Let me think again. In fund accounting, each fund's revenues are what come in from outside the fund. Transfers between funds (like from general to capital) are not revenues of the capital fund; they're just adjustments to the fund's balance. So yes, the $100k transfer doesn't count as revenue for the capital projects fund.

So the total revenues would be $75k + $300k = $375k. Looking at the options, J is $375,000. So the answer should be J.

The revenues reported would be the sum of the federal capital grant and the special assessment, totaling $375,000. 

Answer: J
