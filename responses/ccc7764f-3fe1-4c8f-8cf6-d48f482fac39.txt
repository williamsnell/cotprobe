Alright, so I've got this question about silicon and germanium, and I need to figure out what type of elements they are. The options are from A to J, ranging from monovalent to decavalent. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, first, I remember that elements can have different valencies based on the number of electrons in their outer shell. Valency is the number of electrons an atom can lose, gain, or share to form a chemical bond. Silicon and germanium are both semiconductors, right? They're used a lot in electronics because of that property.

Wait, where are they on the periodic table? Silicon is in group 14, and so is germanium. I think group 14 elements have four valence electrons. Let me visualize the periodic table. Groups 1 and 2 are the alkali and alkaline earth metals, then group 13 is the boron group. So group 14 comes after that. Yeah, that's where carbon, silicon, germanium, and so on are.

Carbon is also in group 14 and has four valence electrons. That makes it tetravalent. Silicon and germanium have the same group, so they should also be tetravalent. So their valency is four. Looking at the options, option B is tetravalent. That seems right.

Wait, but sometimes I confuse valency with valence electrons. Valency is the number of bonds an atom can form, which is based on the number of valence electrons. For group 14 elements, they have four valence electrons, so their valency is four. So yes, tetravalent.

Let me think if there's any exception. I don't think so. Elements in group 14 can have a valency of 4, sometimes also 4 and 4 in different compounds, but generally tetravalent. So the answer should be B: tetravalent.

The correct answer is B: tetravalent. Silicon and germanium are group 14 elements with four valence electrons, making them tetravalent.

Answer: B
