Okay, so I've got this question here about probability, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question says: If a couple has had three sons and the woman is pregnant with their fourth child, what is the probability that child 4 will also be male? The options are A through J, with various fractions as possible answers.

Hmm. So, the couple already has three sons. Now they're expecting their fourth child. The question is about the probability that this fourth child is also a boy. I need to calculate that probability.

Wait, but I remember that each pregnancy is an independent event, right? So the gender of each child doesn't depend on the previous ones. So, the fact that they've had three sons shouldn't affect the probability of the next child being male.

But wait, let me think about this again. Sometimes people get confused because they think, "Oh, they've had three boys already, so maybe it's more likely to have a girl next to balance it out." But that's a common misconception. In reality, each birth is independent, so the probability remains the same for each child.

I think the general assumption is that the probability of a child being male is 1/2, or 50%. So, regardless of previous children, each new child has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The question doesn't mention any factors that could influence the gender ratio, like family history or medical conditions. So, I should assume the default probability applies.

So, the couple has three sons, which is just the prior outcome. The next child's gender isn't influenced by that. So the probability remains 1/2.

Looking at the options, option I is 1/2. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why are there other options like 3/4 or 1/3? Maybe some people think that with three boys already, the next one has a lower chance to be a boy. But that's not correct because each birth is independent.

Another angle: Maybe someone thinks that the probability is based on the number of children they've had. Like, since they've had three boys, the chance the next is a boy is 3 out of 4, so 3/4. But that's a misunderstanding because each child's gender is independent. So, it's not like the law of averages applies here, making it more likely to have a girl after several boys.

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that since the first three were boys, the next is more likely to be a girl, but that's not how probability works. Each trial is independent, so the probability stays constant.

So, the correct probability is 1/2, which is answer I.

The probability that the fourth child is male is independent of the previous three sons. Each birth has a 50% chance of being male. 

Answer: I
