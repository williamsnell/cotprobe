Question:

Under some circumstances, a star can collapse into an extremely dense object made mostly of neutrons and called a neutron star. The density of a neutron star is roughly $10^14$ times as great as that of ordinary solid matter. Suppose we represent the star as a uniform, solid, rigid sphere, both before and after the collapse. The star's initial radius was $7 \tims 10^5$ km (comparable to our sun); its final radius is 16 km. If the original star rotated once in 30 days, find the angular speed (in rad/s) of the neutron star.

Okay, so I have this physics problem about neutron stars and their rotation. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that a star collapses into a neutron star. The initial radius is 7e5 km, and the final radius is 16 km. The star originally rotates once every 30 days. I need to find the angular speed of the neutron star in radians per second.

Hmm, I remember that when a star collapses, it spins faster because of conservation of angular momentum. So angular momentum (L) should be conserved. The formula for angular momentum is L = I * ω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity.

Since the star is modeled as a solid, uniform sphere before and after collapse, the moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)MR². So initially, the star has I_initial = (2/5)M R_initial², and after collapse, I_final = (2/5)M R_final².

Wait, but since the mass M remains the same, the moment of inertia depends on R squared. So when the radius decreases, the moment of inertia decreases, which means the angular velocity must increase to keep L constant.

So, the initial angular momentum L_initial = I_initial * ω_initial, and the final L_final = I_final * ω_final. Since L_initial = L_final, I can set them equal:

I_initial * ω_initial = I_final * ω_final.

Substituting the moments of inertia:

(2/5) M R_initial² * ω_initial = (2/5) M R_final² * ω_final.

Oh, wait, the (2/5) M terms cancel out from both sides. So that simplifies to R_initial² * ω_initial = R_final² * ω_final.

I can rearrange this to solve for ω_final: ω_final = ω_initial * (R_initial² / R_final²).

Now, I need to find ω_initial first. The star rotates once every 30 days. To convert that into angular velocity in rad/s, I remember that one full rotation is 2π radians. So ω_initial = 2π / T, where T is the period in seconds.

So, T is 30 days. Let's convert days to seconds.

1 day = 24 hours, 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So 30 days = 30 * 24 * 3600 seconds. Let me calculate that.

30 *24 = 720 hours. 720 * 3600 = 2,592,000 seconds. So T = 2.592e6 seconds.

Wait, wait, 30 * 24 is 720, right. 720 * 3600: 720 * 3600. Let me compute that.

720 * 3600 = 720 * 3.6e3 = 720 * 3600. 700*3600 = 2,520,000, and 20*3600=72,000. So 2,520,000 + 72,000 = 2,592,000 seconds. Yep.

So ω_initial = 2π / 2,592,000 ≈ (6.2832) / 2,592,000 ≈ let me calculate that.

6.2832 divided by 2.592e6. Let's see, 6.2832 / 2.592e6 ≈ 2.42e-6 rad/s.

Wait, that seems really small. Let me check the calculation again. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 2π divided by (30 * 86400), since 30 days * 86400 seconds/day is 30*86400=2,592,000 seconds. Yeah, that's correct.

So ω_initial ≈ 2π / 2.592e6 ≈ 2.42e-6 rad/s.

Wait, that's indeed a very small value. But considering it's a 30-day period, it's correct.

Now, let's compute ω_final using the ratio of the radii.

The initial radius R_initial is 7e5 km. The final radius R_final is 16 km.

Wait, I should make sure the units are consistent. Since we're taking the ratio R_initial² / R_final², the units will cancel out as long as both are in the same unit. So let's convert them to kilometers.

R_initial = 7e5 km = 700,000 km.

R_final = 16 km.

So R_initial / R_final = 7e5 / 16 = let's compute that.

7e5 is 700,000, divided by 16. 700,000 ÷ 16 = 43,750.

Wait, 16 * 43,750 = 700,000. Correct.

So R_initial² / R_final² = (7e5 /16)^2 = (43750)^2. But wait, that's a huge number. Alternatively, since (R_initial/R_final)^2 = (7e5 /16)^2.

Wait, 7e5 is 700,000, so 700,000 /16 = 43,750. So (43,750)^2 = 1,914,062,500.

Wait, let me calculate that.

43,750 * 43,750: Let's compute 43,750 squared.

Well, 43,750 = 4.375e4.

So (4.375e4)^2 = (4.375)^2 * 1e8.

4.375 squared is 19.140625. So 19.140625e8 = 1.9140625e9.

So R_initial² / R_final² ≈ 1.914e9.

So ω_final = ω_initial * (R_initial² / R_final²) = 2.42e-6 rad/s * 1.914e9.

Calculating that: 2.42e-6 * 1.914e9 = ?

Well, 2.42 * 1.914 ≈ let's compute 2.4 * 1.9 = 4.56, but more accurately:

2.42 * 1.914 = let's calculate step by step.

2.42 * 1 = 2.42.

2.42 * 0.9 = 2.178.

2.42 * 0.014 ≈ 0.03388.

Adding them up: 2.42 + 2.178 = 4.598 + 0.03388 ≈ 4.63188.

So approximately 4.63 times 1e3 (since 1e-6 * 1e9 = 1e3).

So 4.63188e3 ≈ 4631.88 rad/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, C is 4600.0, which is close. So that's probably the right answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because I don't want to make any mistake.

Alternative approach: Let me recompute ω_initial.

ω_initial = 2π / T, where T is 30 days.

30 days = 30 * 86400 s = 2,592,000 s.

So ω_initial = 2 * π / 2,592,000 ≈ 6.28319 / 2,592,000 ≈ 2.420e-6 rad/s.

Then, the ratio R_initial² / R_final² = (7e5 km / 16 km)² = (7e5 /16)^2.

7e5 = 700,000. 700,000 /16 = 43,750.

So (43,750)^2 = let me compute that precisely.

43,750 * 43,750.

Well, 43,750 = 43.75 thousand. So (43.75)^2 = (43.75)^2 = 1914.0625. So (43.75e3)^2 = 1914.0625e6.

So R_initial²/R_final² = 1914.0625e6 = 1.9140625e9.

So ω_final = 2.420e-6 * 1.9140625e9.

Let me compute that.

2.420e-6 * 1.9140625e9 = 2.420 * 1.9140625 * 1e3.

2.420 * 1.9140625 = let's calculate.

1.9140625 * 2 = 3.828125.

1.9140625 * 0.42 = approximately 0.78390625.

So 3.828125 + 0.78390625 = 4.61203125.

So ω_final ≈ 4.61203125e3 rad/s, which is approximately 4612 rad/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 4600.0, which is the closest. So I think that's the answer.

The problem involves a star collapsing into a neutron star, where the radius decreases significantly, leading to an increase in angular velocity due to conservation of angular momentum. The initial angular velocity is calculated using the period of rotation, and the final angular velocity is determined using the ratio of the radii squared. After computations, the final angular velocity is approximately 4612 rad/s, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
