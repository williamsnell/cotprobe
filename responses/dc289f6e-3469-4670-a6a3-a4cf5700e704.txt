Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion."

Okay, so I need to figure out which Mughal Empire policy allowed zamindars to claim sovereignty. Let me read the passage again. It says that a zamindar paying revenue to the Mogul was dependent. But if they wanted to claim sovereignty, they'd stop paying revenue. However, not paying could be for other reasons, and in places like Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur, there were many chiefs and tribes in an "anomalous position." Sometimes they paid, sometimes rebelled, sometimes were independent because the Mughals didn't want to enforce control actively.

So the key point is that the Mughals didn't always interfere. That suggests a policy of non-interference, which would allow local rulers to have more autonomy. Looking at the options, option E is non-interference. The other options don't fit. For example, military conscription (B) or universal taxation (C) would imply more control, not less. So the answer should be E.

The passage indicates that the Mughal Empire's policy of not always interfering allowed zamindars to claim sovereignty. This aligns with non-interference (E).

Answer: E
