Question:

The STANDARD SCORES express raw score distance from mean by SD and considered the most satisfactory type of NR score. Which statement out of the following ones is about T-scores?

Options:

A: M=0, SD=1, often used in research studies
B: M=100, SD=15 or 16
C: They express raw scores in terms of percentiles
D: M=500, SD=100, often used in college entrance exams
E: Shows how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean: a score of +1.0 means it’s 1 SD above the mean
F: M=100, SD=10, commonly used in IQ tests
G: M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments
H: M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI
I: They express raw scores in terms of ranks
J: standard nine: M=5, SD=approx 2

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about standard scores, specifically about T-scores. I'm a bit rusty on my psychological testing terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is about T-scores. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: M=0, SD=1, often used in research studies. Hmm, M=0 and SD=1 sounds like z-scores to me. Z-scores are standardized scores where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. They are indeed often used in research, so A might not be about T-scores.

Option B: M=100, SD=15 or 16. Wait, I think this is about IQ scores. The most common IQ test has a mean of 100 and SD of 15. So B is probably not about T-scores.

Option C: They express raw scores in terms of percentiles. No, percentiles are a different concept. They show the percentage of people you scored higher than, not a standard score based on SDs. So C is out.

Option D: M=500, SD=100, often used in college entrance exams. That sounds like the SAT. The old SAT used a 200-800 scale with an average around 500 and SD of about 100. So D is likely not about T-scores.

Option E: Shows how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean: a score of +1.0 means it’s 1 SD above the mean. Wait, that sounds like a z-score again, not a T-score. T-scores are usually derived from z-scores, but they don't express the exact number of SDs. So E might be incorrect.

Option F: M=100, SD=10, commonly used in IQ tests. No, IQ tests typically have SD 15. So F is probably not correct.

Option G: M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments. I'm not too sure about this one. I know that some tests like the MMPI have different score types, but I'm not certain if T-scores have an SD of 24. Maybe not, but I'll keep it in mind.

Option H: M=50, SD=10, used on many psychological tests, MMPI. Oh, wait, yes! I remember that T-scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The MMPI does use T-scores, so H seems correct. But let me double-check.

Option I: They express raw scores in terms of ranks. That's about rank scores, not standard scores like T-scores. So I is out.

Option J: standard nine: M=5, SD=approx 2. That's the standard nine scale, used in some tests, but not T-scores. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought T-scores are usually M=50, SD=10. So H is about T-scores. But looking back at the options, the question is which statement is about T-scores. So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI. T-scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, and they are commonly used in psychological assessments like the MMPI.

H
