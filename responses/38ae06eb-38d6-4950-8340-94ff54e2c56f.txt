Okay, so I've got this economics question here about income elasticity of imports and interest elasticity of investments. I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that elasticity in economics refers to how responsive one variable is to a change in another. So when they talk about income elasticity of imports, I think it's about how much imports change when income changes. Wait, actually, imports are the goods a country buys from other countries. So if a country's income (like GDP) increases, do they import more or less? I think higher income might lead to higher imports because they can afford more, but I'm not sure if that's always the case. Maybe it's positive, but sometimes if domestic production increases, imports might decrease. Hmm, but elasticity is just about responsiveness, not the direction necessarily.

Now, interest elasticity of investments. Investments are like the money businesses spend on capital goods, right? So if the interest rate changes, how does that affect investment? I remember that when interest rates go up, the cost of borrowing increases, so businesses might invest less because it's more expensive to take loans. So higher interest rates would lead to lower investment. Therefore, the interest elasticity would measure how much investment changes with interest rates. So it's the responsiveness of investment to changes in the interest rate.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Income elasticity of imports measures responsiveness to price level, and interest elasticity of investments measures responsiveness to savings rates. Wait, I thought income elasticity was about income, not price level. And interest elasticity is about interest rates, not savings rates. So A might be wrong.

Option B: Both measure responsiveness of imports to income. No, because interest elasticity is about investments, not imports. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Both measure exports to income. No, because the question is about imports and investments. So C is out.

Option D: Income elasticity measures imports' response to income, and interest elasticity measures investments' response to interest rates. This sounds right based on what I was thinking earlier. Imports go up with income, and investments go down when interest rates go up.

Option E: Income elasticity is about exchange rates and interest elasticity about inflation. Doesn't match what I know, so E is wrong.

Option F: Both measure investment's response to interest rates. No, because one is about imports and the other about investments. F is incorrect.

Option G: Income elasticity is about interest rate, and interest elasticity is about income. That seems mixed up. Imports shouldn't be directly responsive to interest rates in the same way, and investments shouldn't be responsive to income changes. So G is wrong.

Option H: Swaps the terms, making interest elasticity about income and income elasticity about interest rates. Doesn't seem right. H is incorrect.

Option I: Income elasticity about consumer confidence and interest elasticity about government spending. Not related, so I is wrong.

Option J: Mixes up the variablesâ€”imports' response to income is now investment, and vice versa. So J is incorrect.

So the correct option should be D. It correctly defines both concepts: income elasticity of imports relates to income changes, and interest elasticity of investments relates to interest rate changes.

The correct answer is D. Income elasticity of imports measures how imports change with income, and interest elasticity of investments measures how investments change with interest rates.

Answer: D
