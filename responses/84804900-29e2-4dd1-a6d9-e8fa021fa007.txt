Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms."
Letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526
Source 2:
"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand—as though speaking in our name—what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory."
Instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512
The two letters best support which of the following conclusions?

Options:

A: Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial.
B: Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.
C: Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated.
D: Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about two historical letters, and I need to figure out which conclusion they best support. Let me read through the question and the sources again carefully.

The question is asking which conclusion the two letters support. The options are A through D, each making a different claim about the relationship and trade between Portugal and the Kingdom of Kongo.

First, I'll look at Source 1. It's a letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, written in 1526. The main points here are that Afonso is complaining about a problem in his kingdoms. He mentions that his people are eager for goods from Portugal, which are brought by Portuguese traders. Because of this, his people are being seized, and even noblemen and relatives are being kidnapped and sold to the white men (Portuguese) in their kingdoms. So, Afonso is upset about the capture and enslavement of his people by the Portuguese.

Next, Source 2 is a letter from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, dated 1512. In this, Manuel instructs the envoy to make the King of Kongo understand what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, copper, or ivory. The primary goal is to serve God and the king of Kongo, but it's also clear that the Portuguese want to return with goods, indicating a trade expedition. The envoy is supposed to negotiate or instruct the Kongo king to provide these goods—slaves, copper, ivory.

Now, I need to connect these sources to the options provided. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial.
Well, from Source 1, Afonso is complaining about the Portuguese taking his people as slaves. This seems more like a conflict or a problematic relationship rather than cordial. Source 2 shows the Portuguese are actively seeking goods, including slaves, which suggests trade but not necessarily cordiality. So A might not be the best fit.

Option B: Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.
Source 1 explicitly mentions that the Portuguese are seizing "freed and exempt men" and even noblemen and relatives. So this directly supports B. It sounds like this was happening a lot, given that Afonso is highlighting it as a significant issue.

Option C: Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated.
Looking at both sources, there's no mention of regulations. Source 2 talks about filling the ships with certain goods but doesn't suggest that trade was strictly controlled. Source 1 focuses on the negative impact of the trade, not on regulation. So C doesn't seem supported.

Option D: Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties.
Source 2 shows that the Portuguese were actively involved in trade, sending an expedition and wanting to bring back goods. Source 1 indicates that the Kongo people were eager for Portuguese goods, which suggests a mutual exchange. So trade was happening on both sides, and it seems active. This fits D.

Now, I need to decide between B and D because both seem relevant. Let's think again. The question is about which conclusion the letters best support. Source 1 is about the Portuguese taking people, which supports B. Source 2 is about the Portuguese wanting to bring back goods, which aligns with D, indicating active trade. So both B and D are supported, but the question asks for the best conclusion.

However, the letters don't just talk about one aspect. Source 1 is about the negative impact (taking people as slaves), and Source 2 is about the Portuguese wanting to get goods, including slaves, to fill their ships. So both letters together suggest that trade was happening, involving goods like slaves, copper, ivory, which makes D a good fit because it talks about brisk trade with both parties involved.

But wait, in Source 1, it's more about the issue of people being taken, which might imply that the trade was active but also problematic. So both B and D could be possible. However, looking at the options, B is more specific about noblemen being taken, which the first source clearly states. D is a broader statement about the trade being brisk.

But the question is asking for the conclusion that the letters best support. Since both sources are about trade (Source 2 is about the Portuguese wanting to bring goods, and Source 1 is about the consequences of that trade), the overall picture is that trade was happening actively between both parties, making D a strong candidate.

Alternatively, B is also supported because the first source directly talks about noblemen being taken. So I'm a bit torn. Let me check the options again.

Option D says "Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties." This implies that both sides were actively engaged in trading, which is supported by both sources. The Portuguese were sending envoys to negotiate goods, including slaves, and the Kongo people were eager for Portuguese goods, leading to their people being taken as slaves. So the trade was happening on both ends, making D correct.

Option B is also correct in that noblemen were taken, but it's a more specific conclusion, whereas D is a broader statement about the trade itself. Since the question asks for the best conclusion supported by both letters, I think D is the better answer because both sources contribute to the idea of active trade, even though one highlights a negative aspect.

The two letters provide insights into the trade dynamics between Portugal and the Kingdom of Kongo. Source 1 highlights the negative impact of Portuguese traders seizing Kongolese people, including noblemen, for slavery. Source 2 reveals the Portuguese interest in acquiring goods like slaves, copper, and ivory, indicating active trade. While both letters support the idea that trade was brisk, involving both parties, the broader conclusion aligns with the notion of active and mutual trade rather than focusing solely on the enslavement of noblemen. 

Answer: D
