Okay, so I've got this question about NMR frequency for 31P in a 20.0 T magnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that NMR frequency depends on the magnetic field strength and the isotope's gyromagnetic ratio. The formula is frequency (ν) equals the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) multiplied by the magnetic field (B), divided by 2π. So ν = γB/(2π). Right?

Wait, but I think each nucleus has a specific γ value. For phosphorus-31, I believe the gyromagnetic ratio is around 17.295 million per Tesla. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Oh yeah, I think it's approximately 17.295 × 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1. Or wait, sometimes it's given in MHz per Tesla. Because I remember that for protons, which are 1H, the gyromagnetic ratio is about 42.58 MHz per Tesla. So for 31P, I think it's lower. Let me check my notes. Oh right, for 31P, the resonance frequency is about 17.295 MHz per Tesla. So γ ≈ 17.295 MHz/T.

So if the magnetic field B is 20.0 T, then the frequency would be 17.295 MHz/T multiplied by 20 T. Let me calculate that: 17.295 * 20 = 345.9 MHz. Wait, that's around 345.9 MHz. Looking at the options, option G is 345.0 MHz, which is close. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me double-check the exact value of γ for 31P.

I think the exact value is about 17.295 MHz/T, so 17.295 * 20 = 345.9. So option G is 345.0, which is very close. But wait, I'm wondering if I need to account for any other factors, like the fact that sometimes the formula uses the Larmor frequency, which is ν = γB/(2π). Oh wait, no, because when γ is given in MHz/T, multiplying by B gives the frequency in MHz without needing to divide by 2π. Because γ is defined as ν/(B/(2π)), so ν = γ * B. So in this case, using γ in MHz/T directly gives the correct frequency.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the value of γ for 31P is given as approximately 17.295 × 10^6 Hz/(T·s), but when converted to MHz, it's 17.295 MHz/T. So no, my initial calculation should be correct. So 17.295 * 20 = 345.9 MHz, which is about 345.9, so option G is 345.0, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is a bit different, but looking at the options, that's the best fit.

The NMR frequency for 31P in a 20.0 T magnetic field is calculated using the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of 31P, which is approximately 17.295 MHz/T. Multiplying this by the magnetic field strength (20.0 T) gives a frequency of approximately 345.9 MHz. Among the given options, the closest match is 345.0 MHz.

Answer: G
