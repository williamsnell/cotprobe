Consequently, the woman decided to see the fortuneteller in order to have her Tarot cards read. As the fortuneteller was telling the woman her fortune, she suddenly said, "I have a vision. If you give me $25,000 tomorrow, you will live to be 100 years old. " The woman, who was 72 years of age, believed the fortuneteller and gave her the money the next day. The following week, the woman's physician informed her that she had a serious heart disease and he didn't expect her to live for more than a year or two. If the woman asserts a claim against the fortuneteller based on deceit, the plaintiff should

Okay, so I've got this legal question about deceit and whether a plaintiff can prevail in a lawsuit. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question involves a woman who went to a fortune teller, believing she could see into the future. The fortune teller told her that if she gave $25,000, she'd live to 100. The woman, who's 72, believed this and gave the money. Then her doctor told her she has a serious heart disease and doesn't expect her to live more than a couple of years. Now, she's suing the fortuneteller for deceit.

I remember that deceit, or fraud, usually involves some kind of misrepresentation of fact with the intent to deceive. So, for a claim of deceit, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant made a false statement, knowing it was false, with the intent to induce reliance, and the plaintiff actually relied on it to their detriment.

Looking at the options:

A says she prevails because she relied to her detriment. That seems like it's talking about reliance, which is a key element. But I think the key here is whether the fortuneteller knew the statement was false.

B says she prevails if the fortuneteller didn't honestly believe she'd live to 100. So, this is about the fortuneteller's belief. If the fortuneteller knew the statement was false, that's a key point. But I'm not sure if the law requires the defendant to know it's false or if it's enough that they made a false statement without belief.

C says she doesn't prevail unless there's a fiduciary relationship. I don't think a fiduciary relationship is required for a basic deceit claim. Fiduciaries have a higher duty, but deceit can exist in any relationship where someone makes a false statement to induce reliance.

D says she doesn't prevail unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed. Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Warranted truth might relate to whether the statement was made as a fact or as an opinion. If the fortuneteller presented it as a fact, that's different than opinion. But I'm not sure if that's the issue here.

So, focusing on the elements of deceit: false statement, knowledge of falsity, intent to deceive, reliance, and detriment. The fact that the woman relied on the statement and gave money is reliance to her detriment. But the key is whether the fortuneteller knew the statement was false.

In option B, if the fortuneteller didn't honestly believe, that would mean she knew it was false. So, if she knew the woman wouldn't live to 100, that satisfies the knowledge element. But I'm not sure if the law requires the defendant to know it's false or just to make a false statement with intent to deceive.

Wait, another point: the fortuneteller claimed to be clairvoyant, which is a belief in the supernatural. Does that affect whether the statement was false? If she genuinely believed she could see the future, maybe she didn't know it was false. But if she didn't honestly believe, then she knew it was a lie.

So, in the context of the question, the outcome hinges on whether the fortuneteller knew the statement was false. If she knew, then it's deceit. If she honestly believed, even if that belief was unreasonable, it might not be deceit.

Therefore, the correct answer is B because it hinges on whether the fortuneteller knew the statement was false. If she didn't honestly believe, that shows she knew it was a lie, satisfying the knowledge element of deceit.

The correct answer is B. The plaintiff can prevail if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe the woman would live to 100, as this demonstrates the fortuneteller knew the statement was false, satisfying the knowledge element of deceit.
