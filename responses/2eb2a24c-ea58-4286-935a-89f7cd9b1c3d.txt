Okay, so I've got this question about finding the variance of a random variable X plus a constant b. Hmm, I remember that variance measures how much the values of a random variable spread out. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules when you add a constant. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I know that variance has some properties. One thing I'm pretty sure about is that adding a constant to a random variable doesn't change its spread. Like, if you add 5 to every outcome of X, the distances between the outcomes don't change, so the variance should stay the same. So, Var(X + b) should just be the same as Var(X), right? Because b is a constant, not a random variable.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with something else. Oh right, the mean shifts by b, so E[X + b] is E[X] + b. But variance isn't affected by shifts in the mean. It's about the spread around the mean. So adding a constant to each value doesn't make them more spread out or less; it just moves them all up or down by the same amount.

Looking at the options, option J is just VarX, which fits what I'm thinking. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A is 2bE(X), which seems off because variance shouldn't involve the expected value multiplied by a constant like that. Plus, variance is unit squared, and that would involve E(X), which is in the same unit as X, so the units don't match here.

Option B is E(X²) minus [E(X)]², which is actually the definition of variance. So that would be VarX. But wait, the question is about Var(X + b), so why is option B just VarX? Oh, right, because Var(X) is E(X²) - [E(X)]². So option B is correct for VarX, but the question is about Var(X + b), which is also VarX. So both J and B would be correct? But wait, no, because the question is about Var(X + b), which is VarX, so J is correct, and B is just VarX, but it's not directly about X+b. Hmm, maybe in this case, both J and B are same, but J is more direct.

Option C is 2VarX + b. That doesn't make sense because adding a constant shouldn't add anything to the variance beyond what's already there, and 2 times VarX plus b seems arbitrary.

Option D is VarX minus b squared. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought. No, because adding a constant doesn't subtract from the variance. So D is wrong.

Option E is VarX plus 2bVarX. That would be VarX*(1 + 2b), which doesn't make sense because b is a constant, and adding it shouldn't scale the variance like that unless b is a variable, which it's not.

Option F is VarX plus b times E(X). Again, that's mixing variance with expected value, which doesn't fit because variance shouldn't directly depend on the expected value in that way when adding a constant.

Option G is b squared. That would be correct only if the variance was affected by b squared, but I thought variance remains the same when adding a constant. So G is incorrect.

Option H is VarX plus b squared. Wait, no, because that would imply that adding b increases the variance by b squared, which isn't the case. So H is wrong.

Option I is 2bVarX plus b squared. That seems way off; adding a constant shouldn't involve both terms like that.

So, after going through all the options, the correct answer must be J: VarX. Because adding a constant doesn't change the variance of X.
</think>

The variance of a random variable X plus a constant b is equal to the variance of X. This is because adding a constant shifts the mean but does not affect the spread of the data. Therefore, Var(X + b) = VarX.
