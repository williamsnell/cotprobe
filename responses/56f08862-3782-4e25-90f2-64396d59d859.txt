Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: The specific rate constant, k, for a certain first-order reaction is 86 h^-1. What mass of a 0.0500 g sample of starting material will remain after 58 seconds?

Hmm, right. So it's a first-order reaction. I remember that first-order reactions have a rate that depends linearly on the concentration of one reactant. The rate law for a first-order reaction is rate = k[A], where [A] is the concentration of the reactant.

But wait, the problem is about the remaining mass after a certain time. So I think I need to use the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction. I recall that the integrated rate law for first-order kinetics is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt, where [A]₀ is the initial concentration, [A] is the concentration at time t, and k is the rate constant.

But wait, the given k is in units of h^-1, and the time given is in seconds. Oh, that's an issue because the units don't match. I need to convert either the time into hours or the rate constant into per second. Let's see, 58 seconds is how many hours? Well, 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 58 s divided by 3600 s/h gives me the time in hours.

Calculating that: 58 / 3600 ≈ 0.01611 hours. So t is approximately 0.01611 h.

Now, plugging into the equation. Let me write down the formula again:

ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt

I can rearrange this to solve for [A], which is the concentration at time t:

[A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt)

But wait, the problem gives me the mass of the sample, not the concentration. Oh, right, but since it's a mass, and assuming the reaction is proceeding, the mass will decrease over time. Also, because it's a first-order reaction, the ratio of the remaining mass to the initial mass is the same as the ratio of the concentrations. So I can use the same formula but with masses instead of concentrations.

So, let me denote m as mass. Then:

ln(m₀/m) = kt

So m = m₀ * e^(-kt)

Okay, so m₀ is 0.0500 g. k is 86 h^-1, and t is 0.01611 h.

Plugging the numbers in:

m = 0.0500 g * e^(-86 * 0.01611)

First, calculate the exponent: 86 * 0.01611. Let me compute that.

86 * 0.01611 ≈ 86 * 0.016 = 1.376, but let me be more precise.

0.01611 * 86:

0.01 *86 = 0.86

0.00611 *86: 0.006 *86=0.516; 0.00011*86≈0.00946. So total ≈0.516 +0.00946=0.52546.

So 0.86 + 0.52546 = 1.38546 approximately.

So the exponent is about -1.38546.

Now, e^-1.38546. Hmm, I think e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.385 is about e^1.386 which is approximately 4. So e^-1.386 would be 1/4 ≈0.25. Wait, but let me check more accurately.

Wait, 1.386 is ln(4) because ln(4) is about 1.386294. Oh! So e^1.386294 = 4, so e^-1.386294 = 1/4 = 0.25. Since our exponent is -1.38546, which is just slightly less than 1.386294, so e^-1.38546 would be just a bit more than 0.25. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I can approximate. The exponent is -1.38546, so e^-1.38546 ≈ 0.25 + a tiny bit more, maybe around 0.251 or so.

But perhaps I can calculate it more accurately. Let me think. Let me compute 1.38546 as the exponent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(0.25) = -1.386294, so if the exponent is -1.38546, which is 0.00083 less than -1.386294, then the value is e^(0.00083) * 0.25.

Wait, because e^{a + b} = e^a * e^b. So e^{-1.386294 + 0.00083} = e^{-1.386294} * e^{0.00083} ≈ (0.25) * (1 + 0.00083) ≈ 0.25 * 1.00083 ≈ 0.2502075.

So approximately 0.2502.

So m ≈ 0.0500 g * 0.2502 ≈ 0.01251 g.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.0125 g. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's re-calculate the exponent: 86 h^-1 * 0.01611 h = 86 * 0.01611.

Compute 86 * 0.016 = 1.376, 86 * 0.00011 = 0.00946. So total is 1.376 + 0.00946 = 1.38546. Correct.

So exponent is -1.38546.

Now, e^(-1.38546) = 1 / e^(1.38546). Since e^1.386294 is 4, so e^1.38546 is slightly less than 4, so 1/ that is slightly more than 0.25.

Wait, but how much? Let me think, the exponent is 1.38546, which is 1.386294 minus 0.000834.

So e^(1.38546) = e^(1.386294 - 0.000834) = e^(1.386294) * e^(-0.000834) ≈ 4 * (1 - 0.000834) ≈ 4 * 0.999166 ≈ 3.996664.

So e^(-1.38546) = 1 / 3.996664 ≈ 0.25025.

So m = 0.0500 g * 0.25025 ≈ 0.0125125 g, which rounds to 0.0125 g, matching option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise calculation.

Wait, another approach: using the time in seconds and converting k to per second.

Since k is 86 h^-1, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds, so k in s^-1 is 86 / 3600 ≈ 0.023889 s^-1.

Then, time t is 58 seconds.

So exponent becomes kt = 0.023889 * 58 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.023889 * 50 = 1.19445

0.023889 * 8 = 0.191112

Total ≈1.19445 + 0.191112 = 1.385562.

So same as before, exponent is approximately -1.38556.

So e^(-1.38556) is the same as before, approximately 0.2502.

Thus, m ≈ 0.0500 * 0.2502 ≈ 0.01251 g, so 0.0125 g, which is option D.

So the correct answer must be D.
</think>

The specific rate constant, \( k \), for a first-order reaction is given as \( 86 \, \text{h}^{-1} \). To determine the remaining mass of a \( 0.0500 \, \text{g} \) sample after \( 58 \, \text{s} \), the time must be converted to hours:  
\[
t = \frac{58}{3600} \approx 0.01611 \, \text{h}.
\]  
Using the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction:  
\[
\ln\left(\frac{m_0}{m}\right) = kt,
\]  
where \( m_0 = 0.0500 \, \text{g} \) and \( k = 86 \, \text{h}^{-1} \), the remaining mass \( m \) is calculated as:  
\[
m = m_0 \cdot e^{-kt}.
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
m = 0.0500 \cdot e^{-86 \cdot 0.01611}.
\]  
The exponent is:  
\[
86 \cdot 0.01611 \approx 1.38546,
\]  
so:  
\[
e^{-1.38546} \approx 0.2502.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
m \approx 0.0500 \cdot 0.2502 \approx 0.0125 \, \text{g}.
\]  
The correct answer is **D**.
