Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the minimum sampling frequency for a given signal. The signal is f(t) = 3 sin(200πt) + 6 sin(400πt) + sin(500πt). Hmm, I remember that the Nyquist theorem is involved here, right? Nyquist says that the sampling frequency has to be at least twice the highest frequency in the signal to avoid aliasing. So my first step is probably to find the highest frequency component in this signal.

Looking at each term: the first term is 3 sin(200πt). The coefficient inside the sine function is 200π. I think the angular frequency ω is related to frequency f by ω = 2πf. So for this term, ω is 200π, so f would be 200π / 2π = 100 Hz. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 200π divided by 2π is 100, so yeah, 100 Hz. But wait, wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. Because 2πf = ω, so f = ω/(2π). So for 200π, f is 200π/(2π) = 100 Hz. Yeah, that's correct.

The next term is 6 sin(400πt). Using the same method, ω is 400π, so f is 400π/(2π) = 200 Hz.

The last term is sin(500πt). So ω is 500π, so f is 500π/(2π) = 250 Hz. Oh wait, that's 250 Hz. So the frequencies are 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. So the highest frequency component is 250 Hz.

According to Nyquist, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency, right? So 2 * 250 Hz = 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz. But wait, the options are given in πHz. Oh, wait, that's actually in terms of multiples of π. So wait, the problem says "determine the minimum sampling requency (in πHz) satisfying the Nyquist criterion." So I think they're expressing the frequency as something multiplied by π. So for example, 500 Hz would be 500/(2π) per radians? Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the units are in πHz. So, for example, 100 Hz is equivalent to 100/(2π) when expressed in terms of π. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sampling frequency is expressed as a multiple of π. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, the question specifies the sampling frequency in πHz. So, perhaps the answer is 500 Hz, which would be 500/(π) ? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, Hz is 1/s. So πHz would be π/s. So if the sampling frequency is F_s (in Hz), then the question asks to express F_s in terms of πHz, which would mean F_s = N * π, where N is the value we're choosing. So for example, if F_s is 500 Hz, then in πHz terms, that would be 500/(π) πHz? Wait, no, that's just 500 Hz. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the numerical value of the sampling frequency, but expressed in a unit that's per π. So, perhaps the frequencies are given in terms of multiples of π, so 200πt is 200π radians per second. So the actual frequency in Hz is 200π/(2π) = 100 Hz. So the highest frequency is 250 Hz as before.

So Nyquist says F_s >= 2 * F_max, which is 2*250=500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz. But wait, the options are given as numbers, and the options include E: 500. So the answer would be E: 500. But wait, the question says the answer is in πHz. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the units.

Wait, maybe the frequencies are already in terms of multiples of π. So for example, the first term is 200πt, which would correspond to a frequency of 200/2 = 100 Hz, same as before. So the highest term is 500πt, which is 500/(2) = 250 Hz.

So the sampling frequency must be at least 2 * 250 = 500 Hz.

But the options are given in πHz. So 500 Hz would be 500/(π) πHz? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the term πHz to mean that the angular frequency is ω = 2πf, so the frequencies in the signal are 200π, 400π, 500π. So the maximum ω is 500π.

Nyquist says that the sampling frequency in terms of ω (angular frequency) must be at least twice the maximum ω. Wait, no. Wait, the Nyquist theorem is usually stated in terms of f, not ω. So the sampling frequency f_s must be >= 2f_max. Alternatively, in terms of ω, the sampling angular frequency ω_s must be >= 2ω_max. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think again. The Nyquist theorem states that the sampling frequency f_s must satisfy f_s >= 2f_max to avoid aliasing. So in this case, f_max is 250 Hz, so f_s >= 500 Hz. So the minimum f_s is 500 Hz.

But the problem says "in πHz". So perhaps the sampling frequency is expressed as a multiple of π. So 500 Hz would be 500/(π) times π? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different unit where the frequency is given as ω/(2π) multiplied by π. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sampling frequency in terms of the angular frequency, but I'm not sure. Let me check the options. The options are numbers, like 550, 1000, etc. So if the correct answer is 500 Hz, then E is 500. So perhaps the answer is E. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the highest frequency component is 250 Hz, so the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz, which is option E. So the answer should be E: 500.

The signal is given as \( f(t) = 3\sin(200\pi t) + 6\sin(400\pi t) + \sin(500\pi t) \). To determine the minimum sampling frequency satisfying the Nyquist criterion, we first identify the highest frequency component in the signal. The frequencies of the components are:

- \( 3\sin(200\pi t) \): \( f = \frac{200\pi}{2\pi} = 100 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( 6\sin(400\pi t) \): \( f = \frac{400\pi}{2\pi} = 200 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( \sin(500\pi t) \): \( f = \frac{500\pi}{2\pi} = 250 \, \text{Hz} \)

The highest frequency component is \( 250 \, \text{Hz} \). According to the Nyquist theorem, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency to avoid aliasing. Thus, the minimum sampling frequency is:

\[
f_s = 2 \times 250 = 500 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Since the problem specifies the sampling frequency in \( \pi \text{Hz} \), the numerical value remains \( 500 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: 500
