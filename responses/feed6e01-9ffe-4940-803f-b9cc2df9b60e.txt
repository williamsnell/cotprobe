Question:

While relaxing at poolside one Sunday afternoon, a homeowner was struck by a golf ball driven by a 14-year-old boy who was playing the ninth hole at the local golf course. The fairway for the ninth hole was 65 feet wide and 437 yards long, with a dogleg in an easterly direction. Between the fairway and the homeowner's property was a "rough," containing brush and low-lying trees. The boy had hit a towering shot down the middle of the fairway that deflected off a tree and struck the homeowner in the head. The homeowner brought suit against the boy for his injuries suffered when he was hit by the golf ball. At trial, the boy offered uncontested evidence that golf balls from the golf course regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property two to three times a day. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the boy's liability for trespass?

Options:

A: The boy is not liable, because he did not intentionally cause the golf ball to traverse onto theplaintiff's property.
B: Because the golf ball did not substantiallyinterfere with the plaintiff's use and enjoymentof his land, the boy would not be held liable.
C: The boy is not liable because the golf course should have better protective measures to prevent golf balls from entering neighboring properties.
D: The boy would be liable only if he was aware that his golf balls regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property.
E: The boy is liable because the frequency of golf balls entering the homeowner's property suggests a lack of care in his play.
F: The boy would be liable for the unpermittedintrusion of the golf ball onto the plaintiff'sproperty.
G: The boy is liable because he was negligent in hitting the golf ball in the direction of the homeowner's property.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about golf and trespass liability. Let me break it down step by step.

The situation is that a homeowner was hit by a golf ball hit by a 14-year-old boy. The homeowner is suing the boy for his injuries. The key details are that the fairway is 65 feet wide and 437 yards long, with a dogleg to the east. Between the fairway and the homeowner's property is a rough with brush and low trees. The boy hit a shot that went down the middle, deflected off a tree, and hit the homeowner.

At trial, the boy provided evidence that golf balls from the course regularly land on the homeowner's property 2-3 times a day. So the question is about the boy's liability for trespass.

I remember that trespass to chattels or land involves an intentional entry onto someone's land without permission. But wait, in tort law, especially for children, there might be negligence involved instead. Since the boy is 14, maybe the focus is on whether he was negligent.

The options are A to G. Let's go through them.

Option A says the boy isn't liable because he didn't intend to send the ball onto the property. But I think intent isn't the main issue here. Trespass can be intentional or negligent. Since the boy was playing golf, it's more about negligence—did he act carelessly?

Option B claims no substantial interference, so no liability. But the homeowner was hit in the head, which is a significant interference. So B might not be right.

Option C suggests the golf course should have better measures. But the question is about the boy's liability, not the course's. So C might not apply here.

Option D says the boy is liable only if he knew his balls regularly went onto the property. But the evidence shows that the balls do go there regularly, but does that mean the boy knew? The evidence is that it's a regular occurrence, so maybe the boy should have been aware, making him negligent.

Option E states liability because the frequency suggests lack of care. This aligns with negligence—if the boy should have known his shots could end up there, he might have been negligent in how he played.

Option F talks about unpermitted intrusion. That sounds more like trespass, but again, the issue is whether it's intentional or negligent. Since the boy was playing, it's more about negligence.

Option G says he's liable for negligence in hitting the ball towards the property. That seems plausible because if he was hitting towards the area where the homeowner is, especially knowing the fairway isn't that wide and there are trees nearby, he might have owed a duty of care.

Wait, but the key here is that the golf balls regularly go onto the property. So the boy had evidence that this happens often. If the course is designed in a way that shots can go into the rough and onto neighboring properties, then the boy's action might be considered negligent if he didn't take reasonable care to prevent it.

In some cases, like with children and playing near roads, there's a duty to take care. Similarly, playing golf near homes requires taking reasonable precautions. If the boy knew or should have known that his shots could land on the property, then his hitting in that direction might be negligent.

So looking at the options, E and G seem relevant. E is about the frequency implying lack of care, which points to negligence. G directly states negligence in how he hit the ball.

But wait, the boy's evidence was that the balls regularly went onto the property, which might show that the homeowner was aware but not necessarily that the boy was negligent. Or it could mean that the boy should have been aware that his shots could end up there, making him negligent.

I think the key is whether the boy's actions were negligent. If the fairway is designed such that shots can go into the rough and onto the property, and if the boy was aware (or should have been) that his shot could go that way, then his negligence would make him liable.

So, looking back at the options:

E says the boy is liable because the frequency suggests a lack of care. That seems to fit because the regular occurrence implies that the boy wasn't taking proper care to prevent the balls from going onto the property.

Alternatively, G says the boy was negligent in how he hit the ball towards the property. That also fits, but perhaps E is more about the pattern of behavior indicating negligence, while G is about the specific act of hitting the ball.

Wait, but the question is about the boy's liability for trespass. Trespass to land is an intentional entry, but if it's through negligence, then it's a different tort—negligence causing trespass.

So the boy's liability would be based on negligence, not intentional trespass. Therefore, the correct answer would focus on negligence.

So between E and G. E says the frequency suggests lack of care, implying negligence. G says he was negligent in hitting the ball towards the property.

But the question is about trespass liability. So the trespass is the ball entering the property, but the liability is based on whether that was negligent.

I think the correct answer is E: the boy is liable because the frequency suggests a lack of care. Because if the balls frequently go onto the property, the boy should have known and taken precautions, making his act negligent.

The question revolves around whether the 14-year-old boy is liable for trespass due to a golf ball striking the homeowner. The key issue is whether the boy's actions constitute negligence, given the regular occurrence of golf balls entering the homeowner's property. 

Option E is the most accurate because the frequency of golf balls traversing the property implies a lack of care on the boy's part, establishing negligence. The regular occurrence suggests that the boy should have been aware of the risk and taken precautions, making him liable for the trespass through negligence.

Answer: E
