Question:

The owner of a large unimproved tract of land leased it to a tenant for five years at a monthly rental of $1,500. The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. "The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?

Options:

A: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.
B: The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement.
C: The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.
D: The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers, thereby breaching his responsibilities under the agreement.
E: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.
F: The owner had no legal obligation to share the proceeds of the sale as the tenant had continued to live on the property rent-free for a year.
G: The owner's agreement to pay the tenant was conditional upon the sale price exceeding $250,000, which it did not.
H: The tenant's decision to farm the land was against the rental agreement and hence, a violation of the contract.
I: The tenant's construction of the barn without the owner's explicit permission was a breach of the lease agreement.
J: The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully.

The owner leased land to a tenant for five years at $1,500 a month. The lease said the land was to be used as farmland. The tenant built a barn, which increased the land's value from $250k to $275k. Then, near the end of the lease, the owner decided to sell the land. They settled a dispute with the tenant, agreeing that upon sale, the owner would pay the tenant two-thirds of any proceeds over $250k, but the tenant had to stay for another year rent-free. After that, the tenant could stay until closing, paying $1k a month.

The owner initially asked $300k but then lowered it to $260k because of low interest. The tenant got angry and made negative comments to buyers. Eventually, 14 months later, the owner sold it for $256k to a buyer who visited when the tenant was away. The tenant didn't pay the last two months' rent and moved out. The owner refused to pay any sale proceeds, so the tenant sued.

The question is about the owner's best defense. The options are A to J.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: The tenant breached by not cooperating or hindering the sale. Did the tenant's negative comments count as hindering? If the tenant actively discouraged buyers, that could be a breach of an implied duty to cooperate.

Option B: Owner breached by lowering the price without consulting. But the agreement didn't say the owner had to consult the tenant on pricing, so maybe not.

Option C: The agreement voidable as a restraint on alienation. The agreement ties the sale proceeds to the tenant's right, but I think it's not an absolute restraint. It's a condition tied to the sale, so maybe not voidable.

Option D: Tenant didn't maintain the property. The tenant farmed, which is allowed, but did he make it un-presentable? The barn was built, which increased value, so maybe not.

Option E: Tenant failed to pay rent, so owner's duties discharged. The last two months' rent weren't paid. If that's material, the owner might not have to perform. But the agreement allowed the tenant to stay rent-free for a year, then $1k. So maybe the failure to pay rent could be a breach, but the question is about the sale proceeds, so maybe E isn't directly the best defense.

Option F: Owner had no obligation to share proceeds because tenant stayed rent-free a year. But the agreement specifically said to pay two-thirds over $250k, so F might not be correct.

Option G: Owner's payment was conditional on sale exceeding $250k. The sale was $256k, which is over $250k. So the condition was met, but the owner didn't pay. But G says the condition wasn't met, which is not true because 256k is over 250k. So G isn't correct.

Option H: Tenant farming was a violation. The lease allowed farming, so H is wrong.

Option I: Tenant built a barn without permission, which could be a breach. But the lease allowed use as farmland, and building a barn is part of farming. Maybe the lease didn't require permission, but if it did, then I could be a breach. But the owner didn't object at the time, so maybe it's not an issue now.

Option J: Tenant's negative comments were anticipatory repudiation. Anticipatory breach would mean the tenant indicated they won't perform. But the tenant was still under the agreement and made negative comments, which might be a breach of the implied duty to cooperate.

So looking at A and J. The tenant's negative comments could be seen as hindering the sale, which is a breach. Alternatively, it's a repudiation. But I think A is more about material breach, while J is about repudiation.

The owner's argument would likely be that the tenant's actions breached the implied duty to cooperate, making the tenant responsible for the lower sale price or the failure to get a higher price. If the tenant hindered the sale, the owner might not have to pay as much, or the tenant is liable for the loss.

Looking at the facts, the tenant made negative comments after the price reduction, which might have affected the sale. The sale was at $256k, which is below the initial $250k threshold, but wait, the agreement said two-thirds of any proceeds over $250k. The sale was 256k, which is over 250k by 6k. So two-thirds of 6k is 4k. The owner didn't pay that, so the tenant is suing for that 4k.

The owner's defense would be that the tenant didn't deserve it because they breached the agreement. So the best defense is that the tenant's negative comments hindered the sale, so they breached their duty to cooperate. That would be option A.

Alternatively, if the tenant's breach was material, the owner might argue that the tenant's actions made the sale impossible or worse, so the owner doesn't have to pay. Or maybe the owner can claim that because of the breach, the sale was at a lower price than it would have been.

So the most persuasive argument is A: the tenant committed a material breach by hindering the sale.

The owner's most persuasive argument is that the tenant committed a material breach by hindering the sale through negative comments to prospective buyers, thereby violating an implied duty to cooperate. This breach justifies the owner's refusal to pay the tenant's share of the sale proceeds.
