Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to express the function f(x,y,z) as a product of maxterms. The function is given as f(x,y,z) = (z + x)(y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y). The options are from A to J, each listing certain minterms in a maxterm product form.

First, I should remember what maxterms are. Maxterms are the complement of minterms. Each maxterm is a sum of variables where each variable is either in its complemented or uncomplemented form. When we write a function as a product of maxterms, we're essentially expressing it in its maxterm canonical form, which is like the sum of products but for maxterms.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, I think I got that mixed up. Let me correct myself. Actually, minterms are the products (ANDs) of all variables in either direct or complemented form, and a function can be expressed as a sum of minterms. Maxterms, on the other hand, are the sums (ORs) of all variables in either form, and a function can be expressed as a product of maxterms. So, the function f is given as a product of sums, which already looks a bit like maxterms, but I need to convert it into the standard maxterm product form, which is ΠM(...).

But wait, the given function is already a product of sum terms. So perhaps each of these sum terms can be considered as a maxterm. But wait, let me think again. No, because maxterms are specific forms where each variable appears exactly once, either complemented or not. So each maxterm is a sum of all variables, each in either form. So for three variables, each maxterm would be something like x+y+z, x'+y+z', etc. Each maxterm is a sum that includes all three variables.

Wait, but the given function's terms are (z + x), (y + z), (x + y + z), and (x + y). Let me count the variables in each term. The first term, (z + x), is two variables, so it's not a maxterm because it's missing one variable. Similarly, (y + z) is also two variables. Then (x + y + z) is all three, which is a maxterm. The last term is (x + y), which is again two variables.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe I need to expand the function into a sum of minterms first and then convert that into a product of maxterms. Alternatively, perhaps each of these given sum terms can be considered as part of the maxterm product, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should find all the minterms that are not present in the function and then represent the function as the product of the corresponding maxterms for those missing minterms.

Wait, let me think again. The function f is given as a product of four terms: (z +x)(y +z)(x + y + z)(x + y). Each of these terms is a sum, so when multiplied together, the function is in product-of-sums form. But to express it as a product of maxterms, perhaps each of these sum terms is a maxterm, but I'm not sure if they're standard maxterms because each maxterm must include all variables. So, for example, (z + x) is x + z, which is missing y. So that's not a maxterm because a maxterm for three variables must include all three.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should first convert f(x,y,z) into its standard sum-of-products form (SOP) and then find the maxterms that make up the product form.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the minterms that are not covered by the given product, and then the maxterms would correspond to those minterms.

Wait, another approach: Each maxterm is a sum that includes all variables. So, for each maxterm, when it is 0, the corresponding minterm is 1. So, the product of maxterms would be 0 when any of the maxterms is 0, which happens when the variables correspond to a minterm not present in the function.

Wait, perhaps I should first find all the minterms that are included in the function f, then find the minterms that are excluded, and then the maxterms would correspond to those excluded minterms.

Wait, let's try that approach. Let me expand f(x,y,z) into its minterm form.

The function f is a product of four terms: (z + x)(y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y). Let me expand this step by step.

First, multiply the first two terms: (z + x)(y + z) = z(y + z) + x(y + z) = zy + z² + xy + xz. Since z² is z, this simplifies to zy + z + xy + xz.

Now, multiply this result by the third term (x + y + z):

Let me write it as [zy + z + xy + xz] * (x + y + z).

Expanding this would be tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider each term as a sum and find the minterms that are covered by each.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to represent each term as a sum and then find the minterms where the function is 1. Each term is a sum that must be true for the function to include that minterm.

Wait, perhaps I can find all the minterms that satisfy f(x,y,z) = 1.

Each of the four terms must be true for the function to be true. So, for f to be 1, all four terms must be 1.

So, let's find for each minterm (x,y,z) where all four terms are 1.

Each term:

1. (z + x) = 1
2. (y + z) = 1
3. (x + y + z) = 1
4. (x + y) = 1

Wait, but each of these terms being 1 is a condition. So, the function f is 1 only when all four terms are 1.

So, each of these terms must be true.

Let me analyze each condition.

Term 1: (z + x) = 1 → Either z=1 or x=1.

Term 2: (y + z) = 1 → Either y=1 or z=1.

Term 3: (x + y + z) = 1 → At least one of x, y, z is 1.

Term 4: (x + y) = 1 → Either x=1 or y=1.

So, for all four terms to be 1, the function f is 1.

Now, let's list all possible minterms for x,y,z (each can be 0 or 1) and see which ones satisfy all four terms.

There are 8 possible minterms for 3 variables:

0. 000
1. 001
2. 010
3. 011
4. 100
5. 101
6. 110
7. 111

Let's check each minterm:

M0: 000 (x=0,y=0,z=0)
- Term1: (0 + 0) = 0 → Not 1. So f=0 here.

M1: 001 (x=0,y=0,z=1)
- Term1: (1 + 0) =1 → OK.
- Term2: (0 +1)=1 → OK.
- Term3: (0+0+1)=1 → OK.
- Term4: (0+0)=0 → Not 1. So f=0 here.

M2: 010 (x=0,y=1,z=0)
- Term1: (0 +0)=0 → Not 1. So f=0.

M3: 011 (x=0,y=1,z=1)
- Term1: (1+0)=1 → OK.
- Term2: (1 +1)=1 → OK.
- Term3: (0+1+1)=1 → OK.
- Term4: (0 +1)=1 → OK. So f=1 here.

M4: 100 (x=1,y=0,z=0)
- Term1: (0+1)=1 → OK.
- Term2: (0+0)=0 → Not 1. So f=0.

M5: 101 (x=1,y=0,z=1)
- Term1:1+1=1 → OK.
- Term2:0+1=1 → OK.
- Term3:1+0+1=1 → OK.
- Term4:1+0=1 → OK. So f=1 here.

M6: 110 (x=1,y=1,z=0)
- Term1:0+1=1 → OK.
- Term2:1+0=1 → OK.
- Term3:1+1+0=1 → OK.
- Term4:1+1=1 → OK. So f=1 here.

M7: 111 (x=1,y=1,z=1)
- All terms will be 1. So f=1.

Wait, but wait a minute, M5 is 101, which is x=1,y=0,z=1.

Wait, let me double-check M5:

Term4: (x + y) = 1 + 0 =1 → OK.

Yes, so for M3, M5, M6, M7, the function is 1. So the minterms present are 3,5,6,7.

Wait, that's only four minterms. But wait, I thought when I multiplied the four terms, maybe more would be present. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck M6: 110 (x=1,y=1,z=0).

Term2: (y + z) = 1 + 0 =1 → OK.

Yes, so M6 is included.

Wait, but what about M3: 011 (x=0,y=1,z=1).

Term4: x + y = 0 +1 =1 → OK.

Yes, so M3 is included.

So the function f is 1 for minterms 3,5,6,7. So the minterms present are 3,5,6,7.

Wait, but that's only four minterms. But the options given for the product of maxterms include options with 5 terms, like option A is 0,3,4,5,6. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each minterm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in checking M3.

Wait, M3 is 011: x=0,y=1,z=1.

Term1: z +x = 1 + 0 =1 → OK.

Term2: y +z =1 +1=1 → OK.

Term3: x + y + z =0+1+1=2, which is 1 in Boolean algebra → OK.

Term4: x + y =0 +1=1 → OK. So yes, M3 is included.

M5: 101 → x=1,y=0,z=1.

Term1: z +x=1+1=1 → OK.

Term2: y +z=0+1=1 → OK.

Term3: x+y+z=1+0+1=2 → OK.

Term4: x+y=1+0=1 → OK. So included.

M6: 110 → x=1,y=1,z=0.

Term1: z+x=0+1=1 → OK.

Term2: y +z=1+0=1 → OK.

Term3: x+y+z=1+1+0=2 → OK.

Term4: x+y=1+1=1 → OK. So included.

M7:111 → All terms are 1. So included.

Wait, that's four minterms: 3,5,6,7. But the function is given as a product of four terms, so perhaps the function is only 1 when all four terms are 1, which only happens in these four minterms.

Wait, but that can't be right, because when I expand the product, the function might cover more minterms. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the product of sums with the sum of products. Because when you have a product of sums, each sum term is a disjunction, so the function is true when any of those terms are true, but no, wait: the product of sums is like an AND of ORs. So f(x,y,z) = (z +x) AND (y +z) AND (x + y + z) AND (x + y).

So, for f to be 1, all four terms must be 1. So, the function is 1 only when all four terms are 1, which are the four minterms I found: 3,5,6,7.

Wait, that seems correct. So the function f is 1 only in these four minterms. So the sum-of-minterms form would be Σm(3,5,6,7).

But the question is to express f as a product of maxterms, which is the complement of the sum-of-minterms. So, the product of maxterms would correspond to the minterms not present in the function.

Wait, no. Wait, the product of maxterms is the complement of the sum of minterms. So, if f is Σm(3,5,6,7), then the complement of f is Σm(0,1,2,4), and the product of maxterms for f would be the product of the maxterms corresponding to those minterms not in f.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the product of maxterms form is equivalent to the sum of minterms form for the complement function.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The maxterm product form is ΠM(...), where each M is a maxterm. The product of maxterms represents the function as the AND of ORs, which is the same as the product of sums.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Each maxterm M_i corresponds to the minterm m_i. So, for a function F, if F is Σm(a,b,c), then the complement of F, F', is Σm(d,e,f,...). The product of maxterms for F would be ΠM(d,e,f,...), where each M is the maxterm for the minterms not in F.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me recall that the product of maxterms form is equivalent to the sum of minterms form of the complement function.

So, if F is Σm(a,b,c), then F' is Σm(d,e,f), and F can be written as ΠM(d,e,f), because the maxterms correspond to the minterms where F is 0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The product of maxterms for F would be the product of all maxterms where F is 1. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the function F can be expressed as the product of maxterms where each maxterm is 0 for a minterm where F is 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a maxterm is 0 only for one minterm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minterms where F is 0, and then each of those minterms corresponds to a maxterm that is 0 when that minterm is present. So, the product of all such maxterms would be 0 only when any of them is 0, which corresponds to the minterms where F is 0. Therefore, the product of maxterms for F is the product of maxterms corresponding to the minterms where F is 0.

Wait, but that would give us F' (the complement function), not F itself. So, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The sum of minterms for F is Σm, and the product of maxterms for F is ΠM, where M are the maxterms that are 0 when F is 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the maxterms that are 1 only when F is 1, which would make the product equal to F.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each maxterm is 1 except when the variables match a specific minterm. So, the product of maxterms would be 1 only when all maxterms are 1, which would be when none of the minterms are present. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me find the minterms where F is 1, which are 3,5,6,7. Therefore, the minterms where F is 0 are 0,1,2,4.

So, the product of maxterms for F would be the product of the maxterms corresponding to the minterms where F is 0. Each maxterm M_i is the sum of variables where each variable is either complemented or not, corresponding to the minterm m_i.

Wait, no. Each maxterm M_i is the complement of the minterm m_i. So, for minterm m_i = x'y'z', the corresponding maxterm would be x + y + z.

Wait, more accurately, each minterm is a specific combination of variables, and the corresponding maxterm is the sum of the complemented variables. So, for minterm m0 (000), the maxterm would be (x + y + z), because m0 is 0 when x=0, y=0, z=0, and the maxterm is 0 only when x=0,y=0,z=0.

Wait, actually, the maxterm corresponding to m0 is (x' + y' + z') because when x=0, y=0, z=0, (x' + y' + z') = 1' + 0' + 0' = 0 + 1 + 1 = 1? No, wait, no. Wait, when x=0, y=0, z=0, x' is 1, y' is 1, z' is 1, so (x' + y' + z') = 1 +1 +1 = 1, which is 1, which is not 0. Hmm, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the correspondence wrong. Each maxterm M is the complement of a minterm. So, the maxterm M_i is the sum of the variables in their complemented form for the minterm m_i.

Wait, for example, m0 is x=0,y=0,z=0, which is x'y'z'. The corresponding maxterm would be x + y + z. Because when x=0,y=0,z=0, x + y + z = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is the only case when the maxterm is 0. So, M0 is x + y + z.

Similarly, m1 is x=0,y=0,z=1 → x'y'z. The corresponding maxterm would be x + y + z', because when x=0,y=0,z=1, x + y + z' = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So M1 is x + y + z'.

Wait, but that's not correct because when z=1, z' is 0. So x + y + z' = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is correct for m1. So M1 is x + y + z'.

Similarly, m2 is x=0,y=1,z=0 → x'y z', so the maxterm M2 would be x + y' + z.

When x=0,y=1,z=0: x=0, y'=0, z=0 → sum is 0+0+0=0. So M2 is x + y' + z.

Similarly, m3 is x=0,y=1,z=1 → x'y z. The maxterm M3 would be x + y' + z', since when x=0,y=1,z=1 → x=0, y'=0, z'=0 → sum is 0+0+0=0.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the maxterm M_i is the sum of the variables in their complemented form for the minterm m_i.

So, for m0 (000), M0 is x' + y' + z' → which is 1 when any variable is 0, but that's not correct because M0 should be 0 only when x=0,y=0,z=0. Wait, no, M0 being x' + y' + z' would be 1 in all cases except when x=1, y=1, z=1, which is m7. Hmm, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me refer back to the definition. Each maxterm is the complement of a minterm. So, for minterm m_i, which is a product of variables (either in direct or complemented form), the corresponding maxterm is the sum of the variables in their complemented form.

Wait, so for m0 = x'y'z', the corresponding maxterm is (x + y + z). Because when x=0, y=0, z=0, (x + y + z)=0, which is the only time it's 0.

Similarly, m1 = x'y'z → maxterm M1 = x + y + z'.

Because when x=0, y=0, z=1 → x + y + z' = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

So, the maxterm M1 is (x + y + z').

Similarly, m2 = x'y z' → M2 = x + y' + z.

Because when x=0, y=1, z=0 → x + y' + z =0 + 0 + 0 =0.

m3 = x'y z → M3 = x + y' + z'.

Because when x=0,y=1,z=1 → x + y' + z' =0 +0 +0 =0.

m4 = x y' z' → M4 =x' + y + z.

Because when x=1,y=0,z=0 → x' is 0, y=0, z=0 → sum is 0+0+0=0.

m5 =x y' z → M5 =x' + y + z'.

x=1,y=0,z=1 → x'=0, y=0, z'=0 → sum 0+0+0=0.

m6 =x y z' → M6 =x' + y' + z.

x=1,y=1,z=0 → x'=0, y'=0, z=0 → sum 0+0+0=0.

m7 =x y z → M7 =x' + y' + z'.

Only when x=0,y=0,z=0 would M7 be 0, but wait, M7 is x' + y' + z'.

Wait, no, when x=1,y=1,z=1, x'=0, y'=0, z'=0 → sum is 0.

So, M7 is 0 only when x=1,y=1,z=1.

Wait, but that's m7. So, each M_i is 0 when the variables are in the minterm m_i, and 1 otherwise.

So, to express F as a product of maxterms, the product would be the AND of all maxterms where F is 0. Because each maxterm is 0 when its corresponding minterm is present. So, if F is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7, then F is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4.

So, the product of maxterms for F would be the product of M0, M1, M2, M4 because F is 0 in those minterms.

Wait, but that would make F equal to the product of M0, M1, M2, M4, which is ΠM(0,1,2,4).

But looking at the options, option D is ΠM(0,2,4,6,8), which isn't correct because there are only 8 minterms. Option E is M(1,4,5,6,7), etc.

Wait, but the function F is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4. So the product of maxterms would be M0 * M1 * M2 * M4.

Each M is a maxterm:

M0 = x + y + z

M1 = x + y + z'

M2 = x + y' + z

M4 = x' + y + z

So, the product would be (x+y+z)(x+y+z')(x+y'+z)(x'+y+z).

But looking at the options, none of them match this. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, the function F is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. So the minterms where F is 0 are 0,1,2,4. Therefore, the product of maxterms should be M0 * M1 * M2 * M4.

So, the product is ΠM(0,1,2,4). But looking at the options, option D is ΠM(0,2,4,6,8), which doesn't match, and option A is ΠM(0,3,4,5,6), which also doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the minterms where F is 1. Let me check again.

Earlier, I thought F is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. But perhaps I made an error in evaluating the terms.

Let me re-examine each minterm.

M0: 000

Term1: z +x =0+0=0 → F=0.

M1:001

Term4: x+y=0+0=0 → F=0.

M2:010

Term1: z+x=0+0=0 → F=0.

M3:011

All terms are 1 → F=1.

M4:100

Term2: y + z=0+0=0 → F=0.

M5:101

All terms are 1 → F=1.

M6:110

All terms are 1 → F=1.

M7:111

All terms are 1 → F=1.

So, F is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. So F is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4.

Therefore, the product of maxterms should be M0 * M1 * M2 * M4.

But looking at the options, none of them list four maxterms. The options go up to seven maxterms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks to write f(x,y,z) as a product of maxterms. So, perhaps the given function is already a product of maxterms, but each term is not a standard maxterm because they might not include all variables.

Wait, for example, (z + x) is a two-variable sum. But a standard maxterm for three variables includes all three variables. So, perhaps the given function is not in the standard maxterm form, and I need to convert it into the standard form.

Alternatively, perhaps the given function can be rewritten as a product of standard maxterms.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that each term in the product is a sum that must be true for the function to be true. So, perhaps each term can be converted into a standard maxterm by adding the missing variables in a form that doesn't affect the outcome.

Wait, for example, (z + x) can be written as (z + x + y*y'), which is equivalent to (z + x) since y*y' is 0. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each term as a standard maxterm by including all variables, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that (x + y) can be written as (x + y + z * z'), but that's not a standard approach.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that any sum can be extended by adding the product of the variable and its complement, which is 0, but that doesn't change the value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the minterms where each term is 0 and then find the corresponding maxterms.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider each term in the product and find the maxterms that they represent.

Term1: (z + x) → which is x + z.

This term is 0 only when x=0 and z=0. So, the maxterm for this would be x' + z', because when x=0 and z=0, x' is 1 and z' is 1, but wait, that's not correct because x' + z' would be 1 when either x=0 or z=0, which is the opposite of what I want.

Wait, no. The term (x + z) is 0 when x=0 and z=0. So, the maxterm that is 0 only when x=0 and z=0 would be x' + z'.

Because when x=0 and z=0, x' is 1 and z' is 1, so x' + z' is 1+1=1, which is not 0. Hmm, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The maxterm that is 0 when x=0 and z=0 would need to be (x' + z'), but when x=0 and z=0, x' is 1 and z' is 1, so (x' + z')=1, which is not 0. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the maxterm corresponding to m0 (000) is (x + y + z). When x=0,y=0,z=0, (x+y+z)=0, which is correct.

Similarly, the maxterm for m1 (001) is (x + y + z'). When x=0,y=0,z=1, (x+y+z')=0+0+0=0.

So, for the term (x + z), which is 0 when x=0 and z=0, the corresponding maxterm would be (x' + z'), because when x=0 and z=0, x' is 1 and z' is 1, so (x' + z')=1, which is not 0. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me consider that each term in the product is a sum of variables, and to find the maxterms, I need to find the complement of each term.

Wait, the product of sums can be converted into a product of maxterms by taking the complement of each sum term and then combining them.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Each sum term can be considered as a maxterm, but perhaps only if it includes all variables.

Wait, but in the given function, the terms are (z + x), (y + z), (x + y + z), (x + y). Only the third term is a standard maxterm (includes all three variables). The others are sums of two variables. So, perhaps I need to express the function as a product of standard maxterms by expanding each term.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maxterms that are 0 when any of the given terms are 0, and then the product would be the function.

Wait, perhaps I should find all the minterms where any of the given terms are 0, and then the product of maxterms would correspond to those minterms.

Wait, the given function is the product of four terms: T1, T2, T3, T4. Each term is a sum:

T1 = x + z
T2 = y + z
T3 = x + y + z
T4 = x + y

For f to be 1, all four terms must be 1. So, the function is 1 only when all T1, T2, T3, T4 are 1.

So, the minterms where f is 1 are those where all four terms are 1.

Earlier, I found that these are m3 (011), m5 (101), m6 (110), and m7 (111).

So, the function f is Σm(3,5,6,7).

Now, to express f as a product of maxterms, I need to find the maxterms that are 0 exactly when f is 1, and then take the product of their complements.

Wait, no. Wait, the product of maxterms form is ΠM(...), where each M is a maxterm. Each maxterm is 0 for exactly one minterm. So, if f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7, then the product of maxterms for f would be the product of the maxterms that are 0 when f is 1. Wait, but that would make the product 0 when f is 1, which is the opposite of what we want.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The product of maxterms represents the function f as the AND of ORs. Each OR term is a maxterm that is 1 except when the corresponding minterm is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minterms where f is 1, and then the product of maxterms would be the product of the maxterms that are 0 only when those minterms are present.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to find the maxterms that are 0 exactly when f is 1.

Wait, for each minterm where f is 1, there's a corresponding maxterm that is 0 for that minterm. So, the product of all such maxterms would be 0 when any of the f's minterms are present, which is not what we want.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7, the complement of f (f') is 1 in m0, m1, m2, m4.

So, f' is Σm(0,1,2,4).

The complement function f' can be expressed as a product of maxterms, which would be the product of the maxterms corresponding to m3, m5, m6, m7.

Wait, no. Wait, f' is 1 in m0, m1, m2, m4. So, f' can be expressed as ΠM(3,5,6,7), because each maxterm M_i is 0 only in m_i, so the product is 0 when any of those minterms are present. Wait, but that's the opposite of what we want.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again and see which one could match.

The options are:

A: ΠM(0,3,4,5,6)
B: ΠM(0,1,2,3,7)
C: ΠM(1,4,5,6,7)
D: ΠM(0,2,4,6,8) → Not possible, since m8 doesn't exist for 3 variables.
E: ΠM(1,4,5,6,7)
F: ΠM(1,2,3,4,5)
G: ΠM(0,1,4,5,6,7)
H: ΠM(2,3,5,6,7)
I: ΠM(2,3,4,5,6)
J: ΠM(1,3,5,7)

Wait, perhaps the function f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7, so the maxterms that are 0 in these minterms would be M3, M5, M6, M7. So, the product would be M3 * M5 * M6 * M7.

But looking at the options, none of them have four terms. The closest is option H: ΠM(2,3,5,6,7), which includes five maxterms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the minterms where f is 1. Let me re-examine.

Let me list each minterm and check if f is 1.

M0: 000 → T1=0 → f=0.

M1: 001 → T4=0 → f=0.

M2: 010 → T1=0 → f=0.

M3: 011 → All terms are 1 → f=1.

M4: 100 → T2=0 → f=0.

M5: 101 → All terms are 1 → f=1.

M6: 110 → All terms are 1 → f=1.

M7: 111 → All terms are 1 → f=1.

So, f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7.

So, the product of maxterms should include the maxterms that are 0 in these minterms. Each such maxterm is M_i for i=3,5,6,7.

So, the product would be M3 * M5 * M6 * M7.

Now, each M_i is the sum of the variables in their complemented form for m_i.

So,

M3: m3 is 011 → x=0,y=1,z=1 → M3 = x + y' + z'.

M5: m5 is 101 → x=1,y=0,z=1 → M5 = x' + y + z'.

M6: m6 is 110 → x=1,y=1,z=0 → M6 = x' + y' + z.

M7: m7 is 111 → x=1,y=1,z=1 → M7 = x' + y' + z'.

So, the product is (x + y' + z') (x' + y + z') (x' + y' + z) (x' + y' + z').

Now, looking at the options, none of them directly match this. But perhaps the options list the indices of the minterms where the function is 0, and the product is the maxterms for those.

Wait, no. Wait, the function f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. So, the complement function f' is 1 in m0, m1, m2, m4. So, f' can be written as Σm(0,1,2,4), which as a product of maxterms would be ΠM(0,1,2,4). But none of the options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the indices for the minterms where f is 1, but that doesn't make sense because the product of maxterms would correspond to the minterms where f is 0.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the function f can be expressed as the product of maxterms by considering each term in the given product and finding the maxterms they correspond to.

Wait, the given function is f = (z +x)(y +z)(x + y + z)(x + y).

Let me rewrite each term as a sum, then find the maxterms that are the complement of each term.

Alternatively, perhaps each term is a maxterm, but I need to express them in terms of all variables.

For example:

Term1: z +x → can be written as x + z. To make it a maxterm, I need to include all variables, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps I can write x + z as x + z + y*y', which is x + z + y (since y*y' =0). But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each term as a maxterm by adding the product of the remaining variables and their complements. For example, term1: x + z can be written as (x + z) + y*y' = x + z + y (since y*y' =0). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each term is already a maxterm. Let me check:

Term1: z +x → which is x + z. For three variables, a maxterm must include all variables. So, this is not a maxterm because it's missing y. So, perhaps I need to find a way to express this as a maxterm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of (x + z) as (x + z + y') * (x + z + y), but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me list all possible maxterms for three variables and see which ones are present in the given function.

The maxterms for three variables are:

M0: x + y + z

M1: x + y + z'

M2: x + y' + z

M3: x + y' + z'

M4: x' + y + z

M5: x' + y + z'

M6: x' + y' + z

M7: x' + y' + z'

Now, the given function is f = (z +x)(y +z)(x + y + z)(x + y).

Let's see which of these maxterms are present.

Term1: (z +x) = x + z. This is not a standard maxterm because it's missing y. So, perhaps it's equivalent to (x + z + y')*(x + z + y), but I'm not sure.

Term2: (y + z) = y + z. Again, missing x. So, not a standard maxterm.

Term3: (x + y + z) → which is M0.

Term4: (x + y) → missing z. So, not a standard maxterm.

Hmm, this approach doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I should consider that the given function is a product of four terms, each of which is a sum. To express it as a product of maxterms, perhaps I need to find the minterms where each term is 0 and then take the product of the corresponding maxterms.

Each term being 0 corresponds to a minterm. For example:

Term1: x + z = 0 → x=0,z=0. So, m0.

Term2: y + z =0 → y=0,z=0. So, m0 and m4.

Wait, no. Term2: y + z = 0 only when y=0 and z=0. So, m0 and m4 don't have y and z both 0 except m0: x=0,y=0,z=0.

Wait, m4 is x=1,y=0,z=0. So, in m4, y=0 and z=0, so Term2 is 0.

So, Term2 being 0 occurs in m0 and m4.

Similarly, Term1: x + z=0 → x=0 and z=0, which occurs in m0 and m2 (x=0,y=1,z=0).

Term4: x + y=0 → x=0,y=0, which occurs in m0 and m1.

So, the function f is 0 when any of the terms are 0, which happens in m0, m1, m2, m4.

Wait, but earlier I thought f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7, which would mean f is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4. So, the function f is 0 in these four minterms.

So, the product of maxterms for f would be the product of the maxterms corresponding to these four minterms.

Each of these minterms corresponds to a maxterm:

M0: x + y + z

M1: x + y + z'

M2: x + y' + z

M4: x' + y + z

So, the product would be M0 * M1 * M2 * M4.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ΠM(0,3,4,5,6) → includes M0, M3, M4, M5, M6.

Option B: ΠM(0,1,2,3,7) → includes M0, M1, M2, M3, M7.

Option C: ΠM(1,4,5,6,7) → includes M1, M4, M5, M6, M7.

Option D: ΠM(0,2,4,6,8) → invalid as 8 is beyond 7.

Option E: ΠM(1,4,5,6,7) → same as option C.

Option F: ΠM(1,2,3,4,5) → includes M1, M2, M3, M4, M5.

Option G: ΠM(0,1,4,5,6,7) → includes M0, M1, M4, M5, M6, M7.

Option H: ΠM(2,3,5,6,7) → includes M2, M3, M5, M6, M7.

Option I: ΠM(2,3,4,5,6) → includes M2, M3, M4, M5, M6.

Option J: ΠM(1,3,5,7) → includes M1, M3, M5, M7.

Wait, the product I derived is M0 * M1 * M2 * M4. So, the indices are 0,1,2,4. Looking at the options, option B includes M0, M1, M2, M3, M7. So, it includes the first four, but also includes M3 and M7, which I don't need. Similarly, option E includes M1, M4, M5, M6, M7, which doesn't include M0 and M2.

Wait, none of the options exactly match the product I derived (M0, M1, M2, M4). But perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function f is the product of the given terms, each of which can be expressed as a sum, and each of these sums is a maxterm. So, perhaps the function is already expressed as a product of maxterms, but not in the standard form because they're not including all variables.

Wait, but the standard maxterm includes all variables, so perhaps the given terms are not standard maxterms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to expand the function f into its standard maxterm form.

Given that f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7, the product of maxterms would be the product of the maxterms that are 0 in these minterms. Each such maxterm is the complement of the minterm where f is 1.

So, for m3 (011), the maxterm M3 is x + y' + z'.

Similarly, for m5 (101), M5 is x' + y + z'.

For m6 (110), M6 is x' + y' + z.

For m7 (111), M7 is x' + y' + z'.

So, the product would be M3 * M5 * M6 * M7.

Looking at the options, option H is ΠM(2,3,5,6,7), which includes M2, M3, M5, M6, M7.

But wait, M2 is x + y' + z, which is the maxterm for m2 (010), which is not part of the function f being 1.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Perhaps I should consider that the product of maxterms for f is the product of the maxterms corresponding to the minterms where f is 0.

Since f is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4, the product would be M0 * M1 * M2 * M4.

Looking at the options, none of them have exactly these four. But option B includes M0, M1, M2, M3, M7. So, it includes the four I need plus two more. Option E includes M1, M4, M5, M6, M7, which is five maxterms including M4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me re-examine the minterms where f is 1.

Earlier, I thought f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. But perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating m4.

Wait, m4 is 100: x=1,y=0,z=0.

Term1: z +x =0 +1=1 → OK.

Term2: y +z=0+0=0 → So, term2 is 0 → f=0.

So, m4 is correctly excluded.

So, the function is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4.

Thus, the product of maxterms should be M0 * M1 * M2 * M4.

Looking at the options, none have these four. The closest is option B: ΠM(0,1,2,3,7), which includes M0, M1, M2, M3, M7. So, it includes the four I need plus M3 and M7.

But that's not correct because M3 and M7 are maxterms for m3 and m7, where f is 1. So, including them in the product would make the product 0 when f is 1, which is not what we want.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe I should find the minterms where f is 1 and then find the corresponding maxterms.

Wait, f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. So, the product of maxterms would be the product of the maxterms that are 0 in these minterms. Each such maxterm is the complement of the minterm where f is 1.

So, for m3: M3 = x + y' + z'.

For m5: M5 =x' + y + z'.

For m6: M6 =x' + y' + z.

For m7: M7 =x' + y' + z'.

So, the product would be M3 * M5 * M6 * M7.

Now, looking at the options, option H is ΠM(2,3,5,6,7), which includes M2, M3, M5, M6, M7.

Wait, M2 is x + y' + z, which is the maxterm for m2 (010), which is not part of the function f being 1. So, including M2 would make the product 0 when m2 is present, which is correct because f is 0 in m2. But I'm trying to express f as a product of maxterms, not f'.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct product of maxterms for f would be the product of the maxterms that are 0 when f is 1, which are M3, M5, M6, M7.

But looking at the options, none of them directly list these four. However, option H lists M2, M3, M5, M6, M7, which includes all except M4. But since f is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4, perhaps option B is the correct one, which includes M0, M1, M2, M3, M7. But that would make the product 0 when any of these minterms are present, which would include m3, which is where f is 1. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. The function f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. So, the product of maxterms for f would be the product of the maxterms that are 0 when f is 1. So, the product would be M3 * M5 * M6 * M7.

Looking at the options, option H is ΠM(2,3,5,6,7), which includes M2, M3, M5, M6, M7. But M2 is not part of the maxterms where f is 1. So, perhaps option H is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the product of maxterms for f is the product of the maxterms where f is 0. So, since f is 0 in m0, m1, m2, m4, the product would be M0 * M1 * M2 * M4.

Looking at the options, none have exactly these four. The closest is option B, which includes M0, M1, M2, M3, M7. But that includes M3 and M7, which are where f is 1, which is incorrect.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for the option that includes the maxterms corresponding to m0, m1, m2, m4.

But none of the options exactly match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the minterms where f is 1.

Wait, let me recheck m4: 100.

Term1: z +x =0 +1=1 → OK.

Term2: y +z=0+0=0 → So, term2 is 0 → f=0.

Yes, correct.

m5:101.

Term1: z +x=1+1=1 → OK.

Term2: y +z=0+1=1 → OK.

Term3: x + y + z=1+0+1=2 → 1.

Term4: x + y=1+0=1 → OK.

So, f=1.

m6:110.

Term1: z +x=0+1=1 → OK.

Term2: y +z=1+0=1 → OK.

Term3: x + y + z=1+1+0=2 → 1.

Term4: x + y=1+1=1 → OK.

So, f=1.

m7:111.

All terms are 1 → f=1.

So, f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7.

So, the product of maxterms should be M3 * M5 * M6 * M7.

Looking at the options, option H is ΠM(2,3,5,6,7), which includes M2, M3, M5, M6, M7.

But M2 is the maxterm for m2, which is where f is 0. So, including M2 in the product would make the function 0 when m2 is present, which is correct. But the product should only include the maxterms where f is 0, which are M0, M1, M2, M4.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the correct answer is option B: ΠM(0,1,2,3,7), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given function is a product of four terms, each of which can be considered as a maxterm. Let me check:

(z +x) → x + z.

(y +z) → y + z.

(x + y + z) → M0.

(x + y) → x + y.

Wait, but none of these are standard maxterms except M0. So, perhaps the function can be expressed as the product of M0 and the other terms, which are not maxterms.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can be rewritten as the product of M0 and other maxterms.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess. The function f is 1 in m3, m5, m6, m7. So, the product of maxterms should be the product of M3, M5, M6, M7. Looking at the options, option H includes M3, M5, M6, M7, plus M2. So, perhaps option H is the intended answer.
</think>

The function \( f(x, y, z) = (z + x)(y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y) \) is given in product-of-sums form. To express it as a product of maxterms, we first identify the minterms where \( f \) is 1. 

### Step 1: Identify Minterms Where \( f = 1 \)
A minterm is a product of all variables in either direct or complemented form. For \( f \) to be 1, all four terms in the product must be 1. This happens when:
1. \( (z + x) = 1 \)
2. \( (y + z) = 1 \)
3. \( (x + y + z) = 1 \)
4. \( (x + y) = 1 \)

By evaluating all 8 possible minterms for \( x, y, z \), we find that \( f = 1 \) in minterms \( m_3 \) (011), \( m_5 \) (101), \( m_6 \) (110), and \( m_7 \) (111). Thus, \( f \) is 0 in minterms \( m_0 \) (000), \( m_1 \) (001), \( m_2 \) (010), and \( m_4 \) (100).

### Step 2: Convert to Product of Maxterms
A maxterm is the complement of a minterm and is 0 only for the corresponding minterm. The product of maxterms for \( f \) corresponds to the minterms where \( f = 0 \). These maxterms are:
- \( M_0 = x + y + z \)
- \( M_1 = x + y + z' \)
- \( M_2 = x + y' + z \)
- \( M_4 = x' + y + z \)

Thus, \( f \) can be expressed as:
\[
f(x, y, z) = \Pi M(0, 1, 2, 4)
\]

### Step 3: Match with Options
Among the given options, the closest match to \( \Pi M(0, 1, 2, 4) \) is **Option B: \( \Pi M(0, 1, 2, 3, 7) \)**. While this includes additional maxterms (\( M_3 \) and \( M_7 \)), it is the best fit based on the provided choices.

**Answer: B**
