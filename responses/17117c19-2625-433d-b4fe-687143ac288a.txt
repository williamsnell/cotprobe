Question:

A rancher was the owner of a parcel of land in fee simple. The rancher left the parcel in 1977 to move to the city. A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. Upon the rancher's death in 2010, his son, as his sole heir, brings an ejectment suit to recover possession of the property from the man. In his action, the son will most probably

Options:

A: lose, because the man's occupation of the property was continuous and hostile.
B: lose, because the man has been living on the property for more than 20 years.
C: lose, because the man's occupation of the land was uninterrupted.
D: win, because the man did not have a legitimate claim to the property.
E: win, because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year.
F: win, because the man did not have the rancher's permission to live on the property.
G: win, because the statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder- man until his interest becomes possessory.
H: lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.
I: win, because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.
J: win, because the man had abandoned the property for a year.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about adverse possession. Let me start by breaking down the facts and the law involved.

First, the rancher owned the land in fee simple, which means he owned it completely. He left the parcel in 1977. Then, in 1978, a man took possession as an adverse possessor. Adverse possession typically requires that the possessor takes the land without the owner's permission and with hostility, meaning he's acting as if he owns it.

The man was on the land from 1978 to 1988â€”that's ten years. Then he left for a year in 1989 to care for his mother. He came back in 1990 and stayed until 2010, so that's from 1990 to 2010, which is 20 years. So, total time on the land would be 1978-1988 (10 years), then 1990-2010 (20 years), but there's a one-year gap in 1989 when he left. 

Wait, but the statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. So, does the man's possession meet that period? Well, he was there for 10 years, then a year off, then another 20. But the key is whether the adverse possession is continuous. If there's a break in the chain, does that reset the period?

In many states, if the adverse possessor has to have continuous possession. If he leaves for a year, that might break the continuity. So, from 1978 to 1988 is 10 years. Then he leaves in 1989, which might end his adverse possession period. Then he comes back in 1990, which would start a new period. From 1990 to 2010 is 20 years, which meets the statutory period. So, he could have a claim of adverse possession because he met the 20-year requirement after 1990.

But wait, the rancher died in 2010, and his son is bringing the suit then. The rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. So, who had the interest when the man was on the land?

The rancher left the land in 1977 but didn't convey it. So he was the owner until he conveyed it to his son in 1994. So, when the man was on the land from 1978 to 1988, he was an adverse possessor against the rancher. Then, in 1994, the rancher conveyed it to the son. So, after 1994, the son is the owner. 

But the man continued to occupy the land until 2010. So, from 1994 to 2010, the man was on the land, but now the owner is the son. So, the question is whether the man can gain adverse possession against the son.

The key here is whether the adverse possession runs with the land. Adverse possession can be against a grantor, but if the grantor conveys the property, the adverse possession can sometimes be against the new owner if the period is met. But the issue is whether the time the man spent before the conveyance can count towards the statutory period.

In some jurisdictions, the period of adverse possession must be against the same owner. So, if the rancher conveyed the land, the man's adverse possession against the rancher doesn't count against the son unless the son's ownership is under a different chain. 

Alternatively, if the man's possession was continuous from 1978 to 2010, except for the 1989 gap, but if he started again in 1990, then from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years, which would meet the statutory period against the son, who is the new owner. But the problem is that the 1989 gap may have broken the continuity.

But wait, the statutory period is 20 years, so if the man's possession after 1990 is 20 years, that's enough. But the question is whether the son can eject the man.

Another angle: the rancher conveyed the land to the son in 1994. So, at that point, the son is the owner. The man was on the land from 1978 to 1988 (10 years) as an adverse possessor against the rancher. Then he left for a year, came back in 1990. From 1990 to 2010 is 20 years. But the rancher conveyed the land in 1994, so from 1994 to 2010 is 16 years. But the man's possession after 1994 would be against the son.

Does the man's possession after 1994 count as adverse against the son? The man was on the land without permission, so yes. But does the time count towards the statutory period?

In some states, the adverse possession period starts anew when the ownership changes. So, the 20 years would need to run against the son. If the man was there from 1990 to 2010, that's 20 years, but from 1994, it's 16 years. So, he may not have met the 20 years against the son.

Wait, but the rancher conveyed the land in 1994. So, from 1990 to 1994, the man was on the land, but the owner was the rancher until 1994. Then from 1994 to 2010, the owner was the son. So, the man's possession from 1990 to 1994 was against the rancher, and from 1994 to 2010 against the son.

But for adverse possession against the son, he needs to have been in possession for 20 years. From 1994 to 2010 is 16 years. So, he didn't meet the 20-year period against the son. Therefore, he can't claim adverse possession against the son because he didn't have continuous possession for 20 years against the current owner.

Alternatively, if the man's possession was considered continuous from 1978 to 2010, except for the one-year break, but the break might have ended his adverse possession against the rancher, so he couldn't have a claim against the rancher, and after the rancher conveyed it, he needs to start anew against the son, which he didn't meet the 20 years.

So, the man can't claim adverse possession against the son because he didn't have the required 20 years after the conveyance. Therefore, the son can eject him.

Looking at the options:

Option H says the son will lose because the man has acquired title by adverse possession. But if the man didn't meet the 20-year period against the son, H is incorrect.

Option G says the son will win because the statutory period doesn't run against a remainder-man until his interest becomes possessory. Wait, but the son is a grantee, not a remainder-man. So G might not apply here.

Option E: son wins because the man left for a year. That might be because the interruption broke the continuity, so the man didn't have the required 20 years against the son.

Alternatively, Option F: son wins because the man didn't have permission. That's correct, but the main issue is whether he met the statutory period.

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. From 1990 to 2010 is exactly 20 years. So, if the man was on the land continuously from 1990 to 2010, that's 20 years. But the issue is whether the 1989 break affects this.

If the man's possession was broken by the 1989 year, then from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years, which would meet the period, but only if the state allows for the periods before and after a break to be added together. Some states allow "tacking" of the periods if the possession is interrupted but not abandoned. Others require continuous possession for the full statutory period against the current owner.

If tacking is allowed, then the 10 years from 1978-1988 plus the 20 from 1990-2010 would make 30, which is more than enough. But if tacking isn't allowed, then the period must be against the current owner, which is 16 years (1994-2010) plus the time before conveyance doesn't count.

Wait, no. The statutory period must be met against the current owner. So, if the man's possession against the son is only from 1990 to 2010, that's 20 years, but the rancher conveyed the land in 1994, so from 1994 to 2010 is 16 years. So, he didn't meet the 20 years against the son.

Therefore, the man didn't have the required 20 years of adverse possession against the son. So, the son can eject him.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this reasoning.

Option E: son wins because the man left the property for a year. That's because the break in 1989 interrupts the period, so he didn't have continuous possession.

Option F: son wins because the man didn't have permission. That's true, but the main issue is the statutory period.

Option G: son wins because the period doesn't run against a remainder-man. Not applicable here.

Option H: son loses because man has title by adverse possession. But if the man didn't meet the 20 years against the son, H is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is likely E or F. But the better reasoning is that the man didn't meet the 20-year period because of the one-year absence, so E is correct.
</think>

The man's adverse possession claim fails because the statutory period of 20 years must be met against the current owner, the son. The man's possession was interrupted by a one-year absence in 1989, breaking continuity. From 1990 to 2010, he only achieved 16 years against the son, insufficient to establish adverse possession. Thus, the son will win because the man left the property for a year, interrupting his claim.
