Okay, so I've got this economics question here about what happens to the equilibrium price level and output when a major earthquake hits the West Coast and destroys a lot of plant and equipment. The question assumes that the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the aggregate supply curve represents the total output that firms are willing to produce at different price levels. If a major disaster like an earthquake happens, it would likely disrupt production. Specifically, destroying plant and equipment would reduce the productive capacity of firms. So, I think this would shift the aggregate supply curve.

Wait, but the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. Normally, the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is upward sloping because as prices rise, firms can produce more by increasing output, maybe due to higher prices making it worth producing more. But in the long run, the LAS (long-run aggregate supply) curve is vertical because all factors adjust, but here it's probably SRAS since the question is about a shift due to a disaster.

When a major event like an earthquake happens, it's a negative supply shock. This would cause the aggregate supply to decrease because firms can't produce as much. So, the SRAS curve would shift to the left. Let me visualize this: the original supply curve is AS1, and after the earthquake, it becomes AS2, which is to the left of AS1.

Now, the equilibrium is where aggregate demand (AD) intersects with AS. If AS shifts left, the new equilibrium will be at a higher price level and lower quantity. Because with less supply, prices go up, and the quantity produced goes down.

So, looking at the options, I'm looking for a scenario where the price level increases and output decreases. Let's go through the options.

Option D says the equilibrium price level increases while output decreases. That seems to fit. Option C says both decrease, which would be a demand-side issue, like a recession. Option A has price up but output same, which doesn't make sense because if supply is less, output should drop. Option H is the opposite, price down and same output, which isn't the case here. So D seems right.

I think that's the correct answer. The earthquake causes a leftward shift in SRAS, leading to higher prices and lower output.

When a major earthquake destroys much of the plant and equipment on the West Coast, it causes a negative supply shock, shifting the aggregate supply curve to the left. This results in a higher equilibrium price level and a lower equilibrium quantity of output. 

Answer: D
