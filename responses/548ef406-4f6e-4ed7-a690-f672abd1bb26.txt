Okay, so I have this question about solubility, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking: A sample of solid MgCl2 would be most soluble in which of the following solutions? The options are A through I. 

First, I remember that solubility often depends on the solute and the solvent. I think about the solubility rules I've learned before. I recall that salts (like MgCl2) are more soluble in solutions that have similar ions, because of something called the common ion effect. Wait, no, wait. The common ion effect actually decreases solubility because it adds more of one ion, making the solution less likely to dissolve more of the same salt. So if the solution already has lots of Cl⁻ ions, MgCl2 might not dissolve as much because Le Chatelier's principle says the system will shift to oppose that change. So, in that case, the solubility would be lower, meaning the salt is less soluble in such a solution.

But wait, the question is about the most soluble, so I'm looking for a solution where MgCl2 would dissolve the best. That probably means where the ions in the solution don't interfere with MgCl2's solubility. So maybe a solution with ions that are different or don't form similar salts.

Looking at the options:

A: AlCl3(aq) – this solution has Al³+ and Cl⁻ ions. Since MgCl2 also has Cl⁻, the common ion effect would make MgCl2 less soluble here. So A is probably not the best choice.

B: CBr4(aq) – CBr4 is a non-polar solvent. MgCl2 is ionic, so it would dissolve better in polar solvents. CBr4 is a non-solvent for ionic compounds, so MgCl2 wouldn't dissolve much here. So B is likely not the answer.

C: NaOH(aq) – NaOH has Na+ and OH⁻. MgCl2 dissociates into Mg²+ and Cl⁻. Na+ is a spectator ion, but OH⁻ might react with Mg²+. Oh right, Mg(OH)2 is not very soluble. So Mg²+ and OH⁻ could form Mg(OH)2 precipitate, which would reduce the solubility of MgCl2 in NaOH. So C is probably not the best choice.

D: HCl(aq) – HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates into H+ and Cl⁻. Again, Cl⁻ is a common ion with MgCl2. So the presence of Cl⁻ would decrease the solubility of MgCl2 due to the common ion effect. So D is worse for solubility, meaning MgCl2 would dissolve less here.

E: LiOH(aq) – LiOH dissociates into Li+ and OH⁻. Similar to option C, OH⁻ could react with Mg²+ to form Mg(OH)2, which is insoluble. So MgCl2 would precipitate, making it less soluble. So E is not good.

F: CH3COOH(aq) – Acetic acid is a weak acid. It can donate H+ ions, but I'm not sure how that affects MgCl2. Since acetic acid is a weak electrolyte, maybe it doesn't contribute much in terms of ions that interfere with MgCl2. So MgCl2 might be more soluble here because there's no Cl⁻ or OH⁻ in high concentration. So F could be a contender.

G: NaCl(aq) – NaCl gives Na+ and Cl⁻. Cl⁻ again, so common ion effect. MgCl2 would have lower solubility here. So G is not the answer.

H: Mg(NO3)2(aq) – This solution has Mg²+ and NO3⁻. Wait, MgCl2 has Mg²+ and Cl⁻. So in this solution, the Mg²+ is already present. But MgCl2's solubility depends on Cl⁻, not Mg²+. So adding Mg²+ wouldn't directly cause a common ion effect for MgCl2. Or does it? Hmm, I think the solubility is more about the anion in this case. Wait, no, the common ion effect applies to the specific ions in the salt. MgCl2 dissociates into Mg²+ and Cl⁻. So if the solution already has Mg²+, that might not affect the solubility as much because the Ksp depends on the product of the concentrations of Mg²+ and Cl⁻. So if Mg²+ is already high, adding more would lower the solubility. Wait, but Mg(NO3)2 provides Mg²+ which is part of the MgCl2 salt. So the presence of Mg²+ would shift the equilibrium, making MgCl2 less soluble. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here because in a solution where Mg²+ is already present, adding MgCl2 would precipitate because Q would exceed Ksp. So H might not be the best option.

I: Mg(NO3)2(aq) – Wait, didn't I already consider that in H? Oh, I think I may have confused the options. Looking back, option H is Mg(NO3)2 and option I is Mg(NO3)2? No, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

H: Mg(NO3)2(aq)

I: Mg(NO3)2(aq)

Wait, that can't be. Let me check the original question again. Oh no, the user might have made a typo. Let me look:

Options:

H: MgCl2(aq)

I: Mg(NO3)2(aq)

Ah, okay. So H is MgCl2(aq) and I is Mg(NO3)2(aq). So option I is Mg(NO3)2, which has Mg²+ and NO3⁻. So if we have a solution of Mg(NO3)2, adding MgCl2 would mean that the Mg²+ concentration is already high. So the common ion effect would apply, making MgCl2 less soluble. So MgCl2 would precipitate out, meaning lower solubility in I.

So going back, the options where MgCl2 would be most soluble are those where the ions in the solution don't contribute to the common ion effect and don't react with Mg²+ or Cl⁻.

So looking at the options, F is CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute much Cl⁻ or OH⁻. It might provide some H+ and CH3COO⁻. Since MgCl2's ions are Mg²+ and Cl⁻, the presence of CH3COO⁻ might not interfere. So MgCl2 would dissolve more in a solution with fewer ions that compete.

Another angle: the solubility of MgCl2 is higher in solutions that can stabilize the ions. Since Mg²+ is a small, highly charged ion, it might precipitate in solutions with high OH⁻ or other anions that form insoluble salts. But in a solution like CH3COOH, which is weakly acidic, the H+ ions might help dissolve Mg(OH)2 if any precipitate forms, but since CH3COOH is weak, maybe it doesn't provide enough H+ to dissolve it. Alternatively, the presence of acetate ions (CH3COO⁻) might not react with Mg²+ because Mg(OH)2 is more insoluble than Mg(CH3COO)2, which I think is soluble. Wait, magnesium acetate is soluble, right? So if MgCl2 is in a solution with CH3COOH, perhaps some of the OH⁻ could be consumed by the weak acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the best option is D: HCl(aq). Wait, but HCl provides Cl⁻, which would decrease the solubility. So that's not good.

Wait, another thought: the solubility of MgCl2 is higher in cold water but even higher in hot. But the question is about the solution it's being dissolved in. So perhaps the solution that is most like a solvent that doesn't have ions that compete.

Wait, another approach: look for a solution where the anions don't form precipitates with Mg²+. For example, if the solution has nitrate ions (NO3⁻), which are usually soluble. So in a solution of Mg(NO3)2, the Mg²+ is already present, so adding MgCl2 would have lower solubility because of the common ion effect. So I is not good.

Wait, but the question is about the solution in which MgCl2 is most soluble. So the solution that doesn't have ions that would cause MgCl2 to precipitate.

So, which solution doesn't have ions that would react with Mg²+ or Cl⁻?

Looking at the options:

A: AlCl3 – Cl⁻, so MgCl2 less soluble.

B: CBr4 – non-polar, so low solubility.

C: NaOH – OH⁻, which could react with Mg²+ to form Mg(OH)2 precipitate.

D: HCl – Cl⁻, so MgCl2 less soluble.

E: LiOH – OH⁻, same as C.

F: CH3COOH – H+ and CH3COO⁻; H+ might not react, and CH3COO⁻ might not form a precipitate with Mg²+. So MgCl2 would dissociate into Mg²+ and Cl⁻, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so H+ is not very high. So Mg²+ might stay in solution.

G: NaCl – Cl⁻, so MgCl2 less soluble.

H: MgCl2(aq) – same as the solute, so adding more would have lower solubility.

I: Mg(NO3)2 – Mg²+ already present, so MgCl2 would have lower solubility.

So the best option is F: CH3COOH. Because it doesn't contribute Cl⁻ or OH⁻, and the acetate ion is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it might not form a precipitate. Therefore, MgCl2 would be more soluble in CH3COOH than in other options.

To determine which solution MgCl₂ would be most soluble in, we analyze the options based on solubility principles, such as the common ion effect and potential precipitation reactions.

- **A: AlCl₃(aq)**  
  AlCl₃ provides Cl⁻ ions, which would decrease the solubility of MgCl₂ due to the common ion effect. Thus, MgCl₂ is less soluble here.

- **B: CBr₄(aq)**  
  CBr₄ is a non-polar solvent and does not dissolve ionic compounds like MgCl₂. MgCl₂ would be poorly soluble here.

- **C: NaOH(aq)**  
  NaOH provides OH⁻ ions, which can react with Mg²⁺ to form Mg(OH)₂, a precipitate. This reduces the solubility of MgCl₂.

- **D: HCl(aq)**  
  HCl provides Cl⁻ ions, which again cause the common ion effect, reducing the solubility of MgCl₂.

- **E: LiOH(aq)**  
  LiOH provides OH⁻ ions, similar to NaOH, which can react with Mg²⁺ to form Mg(OH)₂, reducing solubility.

- **F: CH₃COOH(aq)**  
  CH₃COOH is a weak acid, providing H⁺ and CH₃COO⁻ ions. Neither of these ions interfere with MgCl₂'s solubility, as CH₃COO⁻ does not react with Mg²⁺ to form a precipitate. This makes MgCl₂ more soluble in this solution.

- **G: NaCl(aq)**  
  NaCl provides Cl⁻ ions, causing the common ion effect and reducing MgCl₂ solubility.

- **H: MgCl₂(aq)**  
  This is the same salt as the solute, so adding more MgCl₂ would result in lower solubility due to the common ion effect.

- **I: Mg(NO₃)₂(aq)**  
  Mg(NO₃)₂ provides Mg²⁺ ions, which are part of the MgCl₂ salt. The common ion effect reduces MgCl₂ solubility in this solution.

Among the options, **CH₃COOH(aq)** (F) is the best choice because it does not contribute ions that interfere with MgCl₂'s solubility, making it the most suitable solution for dissolving MgCl₂.
