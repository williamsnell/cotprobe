A young boy was one of the players on a little league baseball team. The boy's father hated the coach because he rarely gave his son any playing time. The boy was mostly a benchwarmer who played only an inning or two during the game. One night, the father hid behind some shrubbery in front of the coach's home. Armed with a baseball bat, the father intended to break the coach's kneecaps when he came home from work. A man, who resembled the coach, was walking down the street. The father mistakenly believed that this man was the coach. The father jumped out of the bushes and hit the man in the kneecaps with the baseball bat. The man, who was a hemophiliac, died as a result of the injuries suffered in the beating. The father is

Options:

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this criminal law question. Let me read through the scenario carefully and break it down step by step.

The question involves a father who's upset because his son isn't getting much playing time on the baseball team. The father hates the coach and plans to attack him by hiding behind some bushes near the coach's home. He has a baseball bat with the intent to break the coach's kneecaps. Now, a man who looks like the coach walks by, and the father mistakes him for the coach. He jumps out and hits this man in the kneecaps. The man turns out to be a hemophiliac and dies from his injuries.

So, the father's actions here can be analyzed under criminal law principles. Let's consider the elements of the crimes involved.

First, the father intended to attack the coach. He was waiting, armed with a bat, intending to commit an assault. But instead, he attacked a different person he thought was the coach. I think this involves the concept of transferred intent. Transferred intent happens when the intent to commit a crime against one person is transferred to another person when that other person is the one actually harmed. This usually applies to specific intent crimes like assault, battery, or murder.

In this case, the father's intent was to harm the coach. When he attacked the wrong person, the intent transfers to the person he actually attacked. So, the intent to commit battery or assault against the coach is now applied to the man he beat up.

Now, the man was a hemophiliac and died because of the injuries. So, the father's action caused the man's death. The question is, does this make the father guilty of murder or manslaughter?

Murder typically requires malice aforethought, which can be express or implied. Express malice is intent to kill, which the father didn't have because he didn't intend to kill the coach, just harm him. However, if the act was inherently dangerous to human life, it could be considered implied malice. Using a baseball bat to beat someone in the kneecaps could be seen as a dangerous act, potentially leading to death, so it might qualify as implied malice, making it murder.

Alternatively, if the father's actions were reckless but without the specific intent to kill, it could be manslaughter. But since he intended to cause serious bodily harm (kneecaps), it's more likely to be considered as a felony murder if the victim's condition (hemophilia) led to death. Wait, but felony murder usually applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, like robbery or burglary. In this case, the father was committing an assault, which might not be a felony unless it's an aggravated assault. Alternatively, since he intended serious harm, it could still be murder under the felony murder rule if the jurisdiction recognizes assault as a qualifying felony.

But wait, in this scenario, the father didn't actually commit a felony like burglary or robbery. He was just hiding and then committing an assault. So, maybe it's better to analyze under the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, which applies when a misdemeanor involving dangerous conduct causes death. However, battery or assault might be misdemeanors or felonies depending on the jurisdiction. If it's a misdemeanor, then under misdemeanor manslaughter, the father might be guilty of manslaughter.

But I think the key here is that the father intended to cause serious bodily injury, which could make the resulting death murder. Because he acted with the intent to cause serious harm (batter the man's kneecaps), which is a form of malice, it would be murder. So, the father intended to commit battery against the coach, but due to transferred intent, he's guilty of battery against the man. But since the man died, it's murder.

Wait, but the father's intent was to harm the coach, not to kill him. So, the intent was to commit battery, not murder. But battery can sometimes be considered as a general intent crime. However, when the act leads to death, especially through an inherently dangerous act, it can be considered as malice, thus murder.

Alternatively, if the father intended to commit battery, but the victim's death results from that battery, it's considered second-degree murder under the "depraved heart" malice theory if the act was so dangerous that it shows a wanton disregard for human life. Alternatively, if the battery was with a deadly weapon, that could also be considered murder.

But wait, a baseball bat is a deadly weapon, so using it to hit someone in the legs (kneecaps) could be considered as using a deadly weapon. Therefore, the battery would be with a deadly weapon, which can elevate the charge to murder.

So, putting that together, the father intended to commit battery against the coach, but he actually committed battery against the man, which resulted in the man's death. The intent to commit battery transfers to the man he attacked, so he's guilty of battery, but because the battery resulted in death, it's murder.

Wait, but battery is a specific intent crime. So, the father's intent was to hit the coach, but he transferred that intent to the man. Therefore, he's guilty of battery towards the man. But battery causing death would be murder.

So, the father's actions would be considered murder as to the man, and as for the coach, he intended to commit battery but didn't actually do it because he attacked the wrong person. So, what's the status regarding the coach?

The father attempted to commit battery against the coach but didn't actually do it because he attacked the wrong person. So, in terms of the coach, the father attempted to commit battery. So, he's guilty of attempted battery as to the coach.

Wait, but can you attempt battery if the person you're attempting to batter isn't actually there? Because the coach wasn't home, and the father attacked someone else. So, the coach wasn't present, so the father couldn't have committed battery against him. Therefore, the father's intent towards the coach would be an attempt, but since the coach wasn't there, the attempt to commit battery failed. So, the father would be guilty of the attempt.

So, the father is guilty of attempted battery as to the coach and murder as to the man.

Looking at the options:

A: guilty of battery of the coach and murder of the man. No, because he didn't battery the coachâ€”he attempted it.

B: guilty of the murder of the man, but not guilty of any crime against the coach. No, because he attempted battery against the coach.

C: guilty of attempted battery of both the coach and the man. No, because he didn't attempt battery against the man; he intended to hit the coach but hit the man.

D: guilty of attempted manslaughter of both the coach and the man. No, because he intended battery, not manslaughter.

E: guilty of attempted assault of the coach and murder of the man. Assault is a different crime. Battery is the intentional harmful or offensive touching. So, he intended to commit battery, not assault.

F: guilty of attempted murder of both the coach and the man. No, because he didn't intend to kill either; he intended to batter.

G: guilty of attempted battery of the coach and murder of the man. Yes, this seems to fit. He attempted battery against the coach but didn't commit it, and he committed murder against the man.

H: guilty of attempted manslaughter of the coach and murder of the man. No, because he intended to commit battery, not manslaughter.

I: guilty of attempted murder of the coach and manslaughter of the man. No, because he didn't intend to kill the coach.

So, the correct answer should be G: guilty of attempted battery of the coach and murder of the man.

The father intended to commit battery against the coach but attacked the wrong person, transferring his intent to the man he actually harmed. This makes him guilty of battery (murder due to the fatal outcome) regarding the man. As for the coach, since the father attempted to commit battery but didn't succeed, he is guilty of attempted battery. 

Answer: G
