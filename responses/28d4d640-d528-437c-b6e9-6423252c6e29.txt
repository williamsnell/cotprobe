Okay, so I've got this DNA question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The original DNA segment is 5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’. They're asking what it would look like after both a point mutation and a deletion. The options are A to J. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that DNA is double-stranded, with complementary strands. The given sequence is the top strand, so the bottom strand would be the reverse complement. But wait, when mutations happen, they can occur in either strand, right? But since the question is about the resulting DNA segment, I think I need to focus on how the mutations change the given sequence.

So the original is 5' GGATCCTCATG 3'. Let me write that out to visualize it better. Let's count the bases: G G A T C C T C A T G. That's 11 bases. Wait, let me count again: 11 letters, so 11 nucleotides.

Now, the question involves two types of mutations: a point mutation and a deletion. A point mutation is a change in a single base pair, like a substitution. A deletion is when one or more nucleotides are lost from the DNA sequence.

Wait, but wait—deletions can affect the reading frame, but in this question, maybe it's just a small deletion. So, the original is 11 bases, and after deletion, it's shorter. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A: 5' - GGATCCTCA - 3' → That's 9 bases. So a deletion of two bases, but wait, the question says a point mutation and a deletion. Hmm, but the point mutation could be a substitution, and a deletion of one or more. So maybe the original has a substitution and a deletion.

Wait, but the original is 11 bases. If a deletion occurs, let's say one base is deleted, making it 10 bases. But looking at the options, some are shorter, some longer.

Wait, perhaps the point mutation is a substitution (changing one base) and a deletion of one or more bases. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 5' - GGATCCTCA - 3' → Length is 9. So from 11 to 9, deletion of 2. Maybe a deletion of two bases. But then, if that's the case, maybe a substitution and a deletion of two—like a deletion mutation. But the question says "both a point mutation and a deletion." So perhaps one substitution and one deletion.

Wait, but maybe the point mutation is a substitution, and the deletion is of a single base. Let me check each option:

Option A: 9 bases. So 2 deleted. So perhaps a deletion of two bases, but also a substitution? Or maybe only a deletion. Hmm, but the question says both happen. So maybe the original has a substitution and a deletion elsewhere.

Let me look for a substitution and a deletion in the options.

Original: GGATCCTCATG (11 bases)

Option C: 5’ – GGATCCATG – 3’ → Let's count: G G A T C C A T G → that's 9? Wait, no: G G A T C C A T G → that's 9 bases? Wait, original is G G A T C C T C A T G → so in option C, the 7th base is A instead of T. So the 7th base changed from T to A. Also, the length is 9, so two bases are missing. Wait, original is 11, option C is 9. So deletion of two bases, and substitution of one. But that would require three mutations, but the question says both a point mutation and a deletion. So perhaps a substitution and a deletion of two, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a substitution and a single deletion, but that would make 10 bases.

Wait, perhaps the point mutation is a substitution, and a single base is deleted. Let's see.

Looking at option I: 5' - GGATCCTCAG - 3' → G G A T C C T C A G. Original is G G A T C C T C A T G. So in option I, the last base is G instead of T G. Wait, original ends with ATG. Option I ends with AG. So the last two bases are T and G in original (positions 10 and 11). In option I, it's AG, so the 11th base is G. So that's a deletion of the 10th base (which was T), making the last two G. So that's a deletion of one base (T) and perhaps a substitution? Wait, no, the 10th base was T, and now it's G. Wait, no, because in option I, the sequence is GGATCCTCAG. So let's compare:

Original: positions 1-11: G G A T C C T C A T G
Option I: G G A T C C T C A G → so position 10 is A, 11 is G. Wait, original position 9 is A, 10 is T, 11 is G.

In option I, position 9 is A, 10 is G. So that's a substitution at position 10: T → G. Plus, the last base (originally G at position 11) is now at position 10. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps a deletion of the 10th base (T), making the sequence shorter by one, so 10 bases. So option I is 10 bases. Let me count: G G A T C C T C A G → that's 10. So the original is 11, so deletion of one base (the T at position 10). But then, is there a substitution? Or is it just a deletion?

Wait, but the question says both a point mutation and a deletion. So perhaps in option I, there's a substitution and a deletion. Let me check:

Original: ... T C A T G (positions 8-12)
Option I: ... T C A G (positions 8-11)

So position 8 is C, position 9 is A, position 10 is G. Original position 10 is T. So in option I, position 10 is G instead of T, which is a substitution. Also, the original had position 11 as G, but in option I, that G is now at position 10. So that would imply a deletion of the 11th base, which was G. Wait, but that can't be because the 11th base was G, and in option I, position 10 is G. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the point mutation is a substitution, and the deletion is of one base, making the total length 10. Let's look for an option that's 10 bases long and has a substitution.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9 bases → deletion of 2. Maybe, but the question says both a point and a deletion. So perhaps a substitution and a deletion of two, but that's two mutations (substitution and deletion of two bases), but the question says the original experienced both a point mutation and a deletion. So perhaps one substitution and one deletion, but maybe the deletion is of one base.

Let me think of each option.

Option C: 5’ – GGATCCATG – 3’ → length 9. So 2 deletions. Let's see the changes:

Original: G G A T C C T C A T G → positions 1-11.

Option C: G G A T C C A T G → positions 1-9. So positions 7-9 in original are T C A → in option C, positions 7-9 are A T G. So the T at position 7 is now A, which is a substitution. Then, the C and A (positions 8 and 9) are missing, so deletion of two bases. So that's a substitution and a deletion of two. But the question says both a point mutation and a deletion. So that would involve two mutations: a substitution (point) and a deletion of two. But the question says the original experienced both, so perhaps it's a point mutation (substitution) and a deletion, which could be a single base.

Wait, perhaps the point mutation is a substitution, and a single base is deleted elsewhere.

Looking at option I again: 5' - GGATCCTCAG - 3' → 10 bases. So original is 11. So one deletion. Let's compare:

Original: G G A T C C T C A T G
Option I: G G A T C C T C A G → so the last T (position 10) is now G, and the last base (G at position 11) is missing. So that's a substitution at position 10 (T→G) and a deletion of position 11. So that's a substitution (point mutation) and a deletion of one base. That fits the question: both a point mutation and a deletion.

So option I would be the result. But wait, let me check if any other options fit.

Option H: 5' - GGATCCTCAT - 3' → ends with AT. Original ends with ATG. So in option H, the last G is missing. So that's a deletion of one base (G). But is there a substitution? Let's see. Original is GGATCCTCATG (positions 1-11). Option H is GGATCCTCAT (positions 1-10). So only the last G is deleted. So that's a single deletion, no substitution. So that's only a deletion, not both. So option H is just a deletion, not both.

Option I has both a substitution and a deletion. So that fits.

Another option: option D: 5' - GGATCCTCGT - 3' → so original is G G A T C C T C A T G. Option D is G G A T C C T C G T. So in position 9, original is A, now it's G. That's a substitution. And the last two bases are T and G. Wait, original ends with T G. Option D ends with G T. So that would be a substitution at position 9 and a substitution at position 10. No deletion. So that's two substitutions, not a deletion. So option D is two substitutions, not a deletion.

Option B: 5’ – TGATCCCAG – 3’ → that's a different sequence, starts with T, which is different from G. So that's a substitution at position 1 and a deletion of several bases. But I don't think that's the case.

Option G: 5' - GGATCTCATG - 3' → original is GGATCCTCATG. Option G is GGATCTCATG. So position 6 is T instead of C. So substitution at position 6. No deletion, so that's just a substitution, not both.

Option E: 5’ – GGTCCTCATC – 3’ → starts with GGTC, so position 3 is T instead of A. That's a substitution. Also, the length is 10, so maybe a deletion of one base. Let me see: original is 11, option E is 10. So perhaps a substitution and a deletion. But where?

Original: positions 1-11: G G A T C C T C A T G
Option E: G G T C C T C A T C → Wait, that's not matching. Let me write it correctly. Option E is 5' GGTCCTCATC 3', which is 10 bases. So positions:

1: G
2: G
3: T (originally A)
4: C
5: C
6: T
7: C
8: A
9: T
10: C

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is at position 3 (A→T) and a deletion of position 4, making the sequence shorter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is I, which has both a substitution and a deletion. Let me confirm.

Option I: 5' - GGATCCTCAG - 3' → so positions:

1: G
2: G
3: A
4: T
5: C
6: C
7: T
8: C
9: A
10: G

Original:

1: G
2: G
3: A
4: T
5: C
6: C
7: T
8: C
9: A
10: T
11: G

So in option I, position 10 is G instead of T, and position 11 is missing. So substitution at position 10 (T→G) and deletion of position 11 (G). So that's both a point mutation and a deletion. That fits the question.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The original DNA segment is **5' – GGATCCTCATG – 3'**, which is 11 bases long. The question asks for the result after both a point mutation (substitution) and a deletion. 

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A (5' - GGATCCTCA - 3')**: This is 9 bases long, indicating a deletion of 2 bases. However, there is no substitution observed, so this does not fit the requirement of both a point mutation and a deletion.

2. **Option B (5’ – TGATCCCAG – 3’)**: This sequence starts with "T" instead of "G," indicating a substitution at position 1. However, the rest of the sequence does not align with the original, and there is no clear deletion. This does not fit the criteria.

3. **Option C (5’ – GGATCCATG – 3’)**: This is 9 bases long, indicating a deletion of 2 bases. Additionally, there is a substitution at position 7 (T → A). This involves both a substitution and a deletion, fitting the criteria.

4. **Option D (5' - GGATCCTCGT - 3')**: This sequence shows substitutions at positions 9 and 10 (A → G and T → G), but no deletion. This does not fit the criteria.

5. **Option E (5’ – GGTCCTCATC – 3’)**: This sequence shows a substitution at position 3 (A → T) and is 10 bases long, indicating a deletion of 1 base. This fits the criteria of both a substitution and a deletion.

6. **Option F (5' - GGATCCGCATG - 3')**: This sequence shows substitutions at positions 7 and 8 (T → G and C → C), but no deletion. This does not fit the criteria.

7. **Option G (5' - GGATCTCATG - 3')**: This sequence shows a substitution at position 6 (C → T), but no deletion. This does not fit the criteria.

8. **Option H (5' - GGATCCTCAT - 3')**: This is 10 bases long, indicating a deletion of 1 base (G at position 11). However, there is no substitution observed, so this does not fit the criteria.

9. **Option I (5' - GGATCCTCAG - 3')**: This is 10 bases long, indicating a deletion of 1 base (G at position 11). Additionally, there is a substitution at position 10 (T → G). This fits the criteria of both a substitution and a deletion.

10. **Option J (5’ – GCATCCTCATG – 3’)**: This sequence starts with "GCT" instead of "GGAT," indicating multiple substitutions and no clear deletion. This does not fit the criteria.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option I (5' - GGATCCTCAG - 3')**, as it involves both a substitution (T → G at position 10) and a deletion (loss of G at position 11).

**Answer: I**
