Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about William Safire's statement in American Heritage Magazine. The question is asking about the logical fallacy used in the provided quote. The options are A through J, each representing a different fallacy.

Okay, let's break it down. The statement says that the greatness of Lincoln was his purposefulness. He saw that the democratic experiment was centered on the Union and majority rule. Then he argues that if you allowed secession, it would lead to continued subdivision, making democracy an absurdity.

Hmm, so Safire is talking about Lincoln's perspective. Lincoln was against secession because he believed it would break apart the Union. Safire is explaining why Lincoln felt that way. Now, the question is about the logical fallacy here.

Looking at the options, I need to match the statement to one of these fallacies. Let's go through each option:

A: Questionable Analogy – This is when someone draws an analogy that's not really relevant. Not sure if that's what's happening here.

B: Red Herring – This is a distraction, taking attention away from the issue. Doesn't seem to fit.

C: Appeal to Ignorance – Arguing that something is true because it hasn't been proven false. Not applicable here.

D: Appeal to Authority – Using someone's authority to back an argument. Safire is quoting Lincoln, so maybe this is about appealing to Lincoln's authority. But I'm not sure if that's the fallacy here because he's explaining Lincoln's reasoning, not just using Lincoln's name to persuade.

E: Ad Hominem – Attacking the person rather than the argument. Not the case here.

F: Slippery Slope – Arguing that a small step will lead to a series of negative events. That sounds familiar. The statement says allowing secession would lead to continued subdivision, implying a chain of events leading to the end of democracy. That fits the slippery slope fallacy.

G: Circular Argument – Repeating the same point without proving it. Not here.

H: False Dilemma – Presenting a false choice between two options. Not applicable.

I: Straw Man – Misrepresenting someone's argument to knock it down. Doesn't fit.

J: Hasty Generalization – Drawing a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. Not the case.

So, the key part is where Safire says allowing secession would lead to continued subdivision, making democracy absurd. This is a prediction of a chain of events, which is the definition of a slippery slope fallacy. Therefore, the answer should be F.

The statement describes a chain of events where allowing secession would lead to continued subdivision and the end of democracy, fitting the slippery slope fallacy. 

Answer: F
