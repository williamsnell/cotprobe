Question:

You and three friends go to a concert. The total cost for four tickets is $112. Write and solve an equation to find the cost of one ticket t.

Options:

A: 4 - t = 112; -$108
B: 4t = 112; $28
C: t over 4 = 112; $448
D: t + 4 = 112; $108
E: t over 4 = 112; $28
F: 4t - 112 = 0; $448
G: 4t = 112; $448
H: t/112 = 4; $0.0357
I: 112t = 4; $44800
J: t - 4 = 112; $116

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about figuring out the cost of one concert ticket when four tickets cost $112 in total. I need to write an equation and solve for the price of one ticket, which is t.

Hmm, so I remember that if you have multiple items costing the same, you can multiply the number of items by the cost per item to get the total cost. In this case, there are four tickets, each costing t dollars. So the total cost would be 4 times t, right?

So the equation should be 4t = total cost, which is 112. So the equation is 4t = 112. Now, to find t, I need to divide both sides by 4. Let me do that: t = 112 divided by 4. 

Wait, what's 112 divided by 4? Let me calculate. 4 goes into 112 how many times? 4 times 28 is 112 because 4 times 20 is 80, and 4 times 8 is 32, so 80 +32 is 112. So t is 28 dollars. 

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one has the equation 4t = 112 and the solution t = 28. Let me check each option.

Option A: 4 - t = 112. That doesn't make sense because it's subtracting t, not multiplying. Also, solving that would give a negative number, which isn't right for a ticket price. So A is wrong.

Option B: 4t = 112; $28. That's exactly what I thought. So B looks correct.

Option C: t over 4 equals 112. Wait, that's t/4 = 112. If I solve that, t would be 112 *4, which is 448. That's way too high, so C is wrong.

Option D: t +4=112. That's adding the number of tickets, which doesn't fit. Solving for t would be 108, which is too high, so D is wrong.

Option E: t over 4 equals 112. Wait, that's the same as option C. So E is also wrong because t would be 448.

Option F: 4t -112 =0. That can be rewritten as 4t =112, which is correct, but the solution given is 448, which is wrong because 112/4 is 28. So F is incorrect.

Option G: 4t =112; but the solution says $448. That's wrong because 112 divided by 4 is 28, not 448. So G is incorrect.

Option H: t/112 =4. Solving that would give t=448, which is way too high. So H is wrong.

Option I: 112t=4. Solving that gives t=4/112, which is about $0.0357. That's nothing; concert tickets don't cost that. So I is wrong.

Option J: t -4=112. Solving that gives t=116, which is way too high. So J is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B: 4t =112; $28.

The correct equation is 4t = 112, leading to t = $28.
