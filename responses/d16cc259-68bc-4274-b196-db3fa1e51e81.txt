Okay, so I've got this question here: "Who declared Muhammad a prophet?" with options from A to J. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

First, I remember that Muhammad was the founder of Islam, and his life is well-documented. The question is about who recognized him as a prophet first. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A is Ali. Ali was a close companion of Muhammad; he was his cousin and married to his daughter Fatimah. I think Ali became a Muslim early on, but was he the first to declare Muhammad a prophet? I'm not sure. Maybe not, since I recall that some others came before him.

Option B is Abu Bakr. He was one of the first converts to Islam and a very important companion. Abu Bakr was a close friend of Muhammad and later became his successor as the first Caliph. He might have been among the first to recognize Muhammad's prophethood, but I'm not certain if he was the first.

Option C is Khadijah. Khadijah was Muhammad's wife, and she was one of the first people to convert to Islam after he received his first revelation. She was a wealthy and influential woman in Mecca. I think she was the first to believe in Muhammad's prophethood, which would make her the answer. But wait, wasn't there someone else before her? Let me think.

Option D is Uthman. He was another early convert and later became the third Caliph. But I don't think he was the first to declare Muhammad a prophet.

Option E is Abu Talib. He was Muhammad's uncle and a prominent figure in Mecca. I remember that he protected Muhammad but didn't convert to Islam until later, perhaps even on his deathbed. So probably not the first.

Option F is Waraqah. He was a Christian convert and a cousin of Khadijah. I've heard that he met Muhammad and supported him, maybe even before Khadijah. So perhaps Waraqah was the first to declare Muhammad a prophet. That could make sense because he was a scholar and recognized the signs.

Option G is Umar. He was a prominent companion who converted later, after some conflicts. He became a significant leader but wasn't the first to recognize Muhammad's prophethood.

Option H is Bilal. He was an African companion known for his strong voice and as the first muezzin. He converted early, but I don't think he was the first to declare Muhammad a prophet.

Option I is Gabriel. He's the archangel who delivered the revelations to Muhammad. But Gabriel is an angel, not a human, so he wouldn't be someone who declared Muhammad publicly as a prophet among humans.

Option J is Aisha. She was Muhammad's wife and a prominent figure, but she converted after Muhammad's marriage to her, so she wasn't the first.

Wait, so I'm a bit confused between Waraqah (F) and Khadijah (C). I think when Muhammad first received the revelations, he went to Khadijah and she believed in him. But before that, maybe Waraqah had some interaction. I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that Waraqah was the first human to recognize Muhammad as a prophet because he was a Christian and saw similarities in the messages. So maybe Waraqah declared it first, and then Khadijah followed. Or was it the other way around?

Alternatively, I might be mixing up events. I think after Muhammad received the first revelation, he went to Khadijah for support, and she was the first to believe in him as a prophet. So perhaps she is the correct answer. But I'm a bit uncertain because Waraqah might have been the first to declare it publicly or recognize it among the people.

Wait, another angle: in the early days, Muhammad was very concerned about the revelations and went to Khadijah for reassurance. She, being a strong and wise woman, supported him. Then, perhaps Waraqah, upon hearing from Khadijah or Muhammad, also recognized his prophethood. So who was first? I think Khadijah was the first person to declare her belief in Muhammad's prophethood, followed by Abu Bakr and others.

But I'm not 100% sure. Some sources might say that Waraqah, being a Christian, recognized the signs and declared Muhammad a prophet before Khadijah. But I'm more confident that Khadijah was the first among the humans to do so because she was close to Muhammad and had a strong influence.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to recall the correct sequence. After Muhammad received the first revelation (in the cave of Hira), he went to Khadijah and told her about it. She comforted him and sent him to Waraqah, who was a Christian monk and her cousin. Waraqah then told Muhammad that he was indeed a prophet. So in that case, Waraqah would have been the first to declare Muhammad a prophet after Khadijah's belief.

But wait, no. Because Khadijah herself believed in Muhammad's prophethood before others. So she was the first person to declare her belief in him as a prophet, followed by Abu Bakr, then others. So the answer would be C: Khadijah.

Alternatively, if the question is about who declared it publicly, maybe it's someone else, but I think the question is about who was the first to recognize him as a prophet, which would be Khadijah.

The question asks who first declared Muhammad a prophet. After considering the options, Khadijah, Muhammad's wife, was the first to believe in his prophethood after his initial revelation. While Waraqah, a Christian cousin of Khadijah, later recognized Muhammad as a prophet, Khadijah was the first among humans to do so.

Answer: C
