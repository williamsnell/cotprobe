Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ballistic rocket being launched from the equator. Let me try to unpack what's going on and figure out the solution step by step.

The question says the rocket is launched eastward at a 60-degree angle from the horizontal. Its initial speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s. We're supposed to find the great circle distance around the Earth that the rocket covers. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that a ballistic rocket, once launched, doesn't have any thrust after the initial burn. So its motion is governed by gravity and the Earth's rotation. Since it's launched from the equator and going east, it's moving in the same direction as Earth's rotation, which might give it an extra boost. 

Wait, but the rocket's speed is given as 6 km/s relative to Earth. So I need to figure out if this speed includes Earth's rotational speed or not. Hmm, I think Earth's rotational speed at the equator is about 465 m/s, which is much less than 6 km/s. So the rocket's initial speed is much higher than Earth's, which means it's moving east faster than the Earth's surface.

But wait, does the Earth's rotation affect the rocket's velocity in space? Well, once the rocket is in space, it's moving relative to an inertial frame, but when calculating the distance traveled around Earth, we might need to consider how much it circles the Earth while it's in orbit, if it's orbiting.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The problem says it's a ballistic rocket, so I think it's not powered after launch. So it's just going to follow a ballistic trajectory under the influence of gravity. But is it going into orbit? Or is it just a suborbital flight?

Wait, the speed is 6 km/s. Let me think about orbital velocities. The circular orbital speed at the Earth's surface would require a much higher speed, but the actual orbital speed at low Earth orbit is about 7.8 km/s. Since 6 km/s is lower than that, I think the rocket won't be in orbit. It would follow a ballistic trajectory, perhaps an ellipse, but it might not complete an orbit.

Wait, but the question is about the great circle distance covered. That suggests the rocket goes all the way around the Earth along some path. Or maybe it goes into orbit and completes a full circle. Hmm.

Wait, but Earth's circumference is about 40,075 km, so a great circle distance is that. But the options given are in the millions of meters, which would be thousands of kilometers. So let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth, but in the inertial frame, considering Earth's rotation, it's moving faster. Wait, but Earth's rotation at the equator is about 463 m/s eastward. So the rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame would be 6 km/s (6000 m/s) plus 463 m/s, totaling 6463 m/s. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, but the problem states that the speed is measured with respect to Earth. So perhaps we don't need to add Earth's rotational speed because the rocket's speed is already given relative to Earth's surface.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to realize that the rocket will be moving eastward at 6 km/s relative to Earth. Since Earth itself is rotating eastward, the rocket's speed relative to the inertial frame would be Earth's surface speed plus the rocket's speed. But I'm not sure if that matters for the distance traveled around Earth.

Alternatively, maybe the rocket's trajectory is such that it's moving in a circular path around Earth, but that seems unlikely because the initial speed is lower than orbital speed. So perhaps the rocket just goes up, follows a ballistic arc, and comes back down, but in the meantime, Earth has rotated underneath it, so the rocket would have covered some distance along the great circle path.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the rocket is launched eastward with a speed of 6 km/s relative to Earth, and since Earth's circumference is about 40,075 km (40,075,000 meters), the time it takes to go around once is circumference divided by speed. But wait, that's assuming it's moving in a circular path at that speed, which might not be the case because the rocket's speed is higher than Earth's rotational speed but lower than orbital speed. So maybe it doesn't complete an orbit but just arcs around, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the concept of the rocket's speed relative to Earth. Since it's moving at 6 km/s eastward, which is much faster than Earth's rotation, the rocket would effectively be moving faster than Earth's surface. So when it's launched, it's going to follow a ballistic path, and during the time it's in the air, Earth's surface would have rotated underneath it, so the rocket would land some distance eastward. But the problem is asking for the great circle distance covered, which would be the arc length along Earth's surface from launch to landing points.

Wait, but for that, I think I need to find out how much the rocket has moved eastward during its flight time, and then calculate the arc length based on Earth's radius.

Alternatively, maybe it's a question of how many times the rocket circles the Earth during its flight. But since it's launched eastward and with a speed higher than Earth's rotation, perhaps it's going to make multiple loops, but that's probably more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should first find the time the rocket is in the air. Since the rocket is launched at an angle of 60 degrees from the horizontal. The initial velocity can be broken into horizontal and vertical components.

The initial speed is V1 = 6 km/s. So the vertical component is V1y = V1 * sin(60°) and the horizontal component is V1x = V1 * cos(60°).

Wait, but is the rocket subject to gravity? Yes, so the time of flight will be determined by the vertical motion.

Assuming no air resistance, the time the rocket is in the air can be found by considering the vertical motion. The time to reach the maximum height is (V1y)/g, where g is 9.81 m/s². Then the total time of flight is twice that, so T = 2 * (V1y)/g.

So let's compute that.

V1y = 6 km/s * sin(60°) = 6000 m/s * (√3 / 2) ≈ 6000 * 0.8660 ≈ 5196 m/s.

Time to reach max height: t_up = V1y / g = 5196 / 9.81 ≈ 529.7 seconds.

Total flight time: T = 2 * t_up ≈ 1059.4 seconds.

Now, the horizontal distance traveled by the rocket relative to Earth is V1x * T.

V1x = 6000 * cos(60°) = 6000 * 0.5 = 3000 m/s.

So distance relative to Earth: D = 3000 m/s * 1059.4 s ≈ 3,178,200 meters, which is about 3.178 × 10^6 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 2.154 × 10^6 m, and option E is 1.732 ×10^6 m. So my calculation doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rocket's speed is relative to Earth, but during its flight, Earth is rotating. So maybe the rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame is higher, which affects the time of flight. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe this approach is incorrect because the rocket is actually in orbit, and the distance covered is the circumference of the orbit. But wait, earlier I thought 6 km/s is less than orbital speed, which is about 7.8 km/s. So maybe it's not orbiting but just a suborbital flight.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.

If the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth, moving eastward, and Earth is rotating eastward at about 463 m/s, then the rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame would be 6000 + 463 ≈ 6463 m/s.

But how does that affect the distance covered? If the rocket is in orbit, then the orbital circumference would be 2πr, where r is the radius of the orbit. But without knowing the orbit, this might not help.

Wait, but the problem states it's a ballistic rocket, which typically refers to a suborbital trajectory, not an orbit. So perhaps the approach I took earlier is correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the time of flight.

V1y = 6000 * sin(60) = 6000 * (√3/2) = 6000 * 0.8660 ≈ 5196 m/s.

Time to reach max height: 5196 / 9.81 ≈ 529.7 seconds. So total flight time is about 1059.4 seconds.

Horizontal speed: 3000 m/s.

Distance: 3000 * 1059.4 ≈ 3,178,200 m.

Wait, that's 3.178e6 meters. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: 2.154e6 m and option H: 7.238e6 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the rocket's speed is given as 6 km/s relative to Earth, but since Earth is rotating, the rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame is higher. But I'm not sure if that affects the time of flight because gravity is acting in the Earth's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Earth's rotation, so the effective speed relative to Earth's surface is higher, leading to a longer distance.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the rocket is moving eastward, so as it's in the air, Earth rotates underneath it, so the rocket would cover more distance than just horizontal speed times time.

Wait, but the rocket's horizontal speed is 3000 m/s relative to Earth. So during the flight time, the rocket moves eastward relative to Earth, but Earth itself is also rotating. So perhaps the distance covered is (V1x + Earth's rotational speed) * T.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Let me see.

Earth's rotational speed at equator is ω * R, where ω is angular velocity, R is Earth's radius.

ω = 2π radians per day, which is approximately 7.27e-5 rad/s.

R is about 6,371,000 meters.

So Earth's rotational speed v_earth = ω * R ≈ 7.27e-5 * 6.371e6 ≈ 463.3 m/s eastward.

So, if the rocket's horizontal speed relative to Earth is 3000 m/s eastward, then relative to an inertial frame, it's moving at 3000 + 463.3 ≈ 3463.3 m/s.

Wait, but does that affect the time of flight? Because the time of flight is determined by the vertical motion relative to Earth. So perhaps the time is the same, but the horizontal distance is more because the rocket is moving faster relative to the stars.

Wait, but in Earth's frame, the horizontal distance would just be V1x * T, which is 3000 * 1059.4 ≈ 3.178e6 m, as before.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider the rocket's path as a great circle. That is, perhaps the rocket is moving in a circular path around Earth, and the great circle distance is the circumference of that path.

But then, for a circular orbit, the speed is sqrt(G*M_e / r), where M_e is Earth's mass and r is the radius of the orbit.

But the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth. So perhaps the rocket is in a circular orbit, and the great circle distance would be the circumference, which is 2πr.

But I'm not sure if the rocket is in orbit because 6 km/s is less than the orbital speed of about 7.8 km/s. So maybe it's not orbiting, but perhaps the question is considering that.

Alternatively, perhaps the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth, but when you add Earth's rotational speed, the actual speed in space is higher, allowing it to orbit.

Wait, maybe I should compute the orbital radius where the rocket's speed (relative to Earth) is 6 km/s. Wait, but that's confusing because the rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s eastward, but in space, it's moving faster.

Alternatively, perhaps the rocket is moving in a circular orbit, and the problem is asking for the circumference.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the orbital radius r where the rocket's speed v is such that v = sqrt(μ / r), where μ is the standard gravitational parameter for Earth. But the problem states that the rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the rocket is moving eastward at 6 km/s relative to Earth, but Earth's rotation gives it an additional 463 m/s, so in space, it's moving at 6463 m/s.

Then, using that speed, we can find the orbital radius where this speed would be the circular orbital speed.

So, v = sqrt(μ / r), where μ = G*M_e ≈ 3.986e14 m³/s².

So, r = μ / v².

v = 6463 m/s.

v² = (6463)^2 ≈ 4.177e7 m²/s².

r = 3.986e14 / 4.177e7 ≈ 9.544e6 meters ≈ 9,544 km.

But Earth's radius is about 6,371 km, so this would be a low Earth orbit, maybe. Then the circumference would be 2πr ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 9.544e6 ≈ 5.995e7 meters, which is 59,950 km, or 5.995e7 m. But that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial approach.

The rocket is launched eastward at 60 degrees with speed 6 km/s relative to Earth. Let's find the time of flight and then the horizontal distance.

V1y = 6 km/s * sin(60) ≈ 5.196 km/s.

Time up: (5.196 km/s) / (9.81 m/s²). Wait, but units are inconsistent. 5.196 km/s is 5196 m/s.

So time up: 5196 / 9.81 ≈ 529.7 seconds.

Total flight time: 2 * 529.7 ≈ 1059.4 seconds.

Horizontal speed: V1x = 6 * cos(60) = 3 km/s.

So distance relative to Earth: 3 km/s * 1059.4 s ≈ 3178 km, which is 3.178e6 meters.

Looking back at the options, option C is 2.154e6 m and option E is 1.732e6 m. Neither matches 3.178e6 m. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth, but I should consider that the rocket is moving in Earth's frame, so the time of flight is calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider Earth's rotation in the horizontal component.

Wait, another approach: The horizontal speed relative to Earth is 3 km/s eastward. But Earth itself is rotating eastward at 463 m/s. So the rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame is 3000 + 463 ≈ 3463 m/s.

But how does that affect the distance? If the rocket is in the air for 1059.4 seconds, then the distance relative to Earth would be 3000 * 1059.4 ≈ 3.178e6 m, as before. But relative to an inertial frame, it's 3463 * 1059.4 ≈ 3.668e6 m. Still, neither matches the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance along the great circle, which is the arc length corresponding to the angle the rocket has moved around Earth. So the great circle distance would be R * θ, where θ is the angle in radians.

Wait, but how do I find θ? The rocket's horizontal speed is 3 km/s relative to Earth. So in time T, it would have moved 3 km/s * T seconds eastward relative to Earth.

But Earth's circumference is 40,075 km. So the angle θ in radians would be (distance moved) / Earth's radius.

Wait, Earth's radius R is 6,371 km, so 6,371,000 meters.

So in our case, the distance moved relative to Earth is 3 km/s * T. Wait, but T is 1059.4 seconds, so 3000 m/s * 1059.4 s ≈ 3,178,200 meters, which is about 3178 km.

So the angle θ in radians is 3178 km / 6371 km ≈ 0.5 radians.

Then the great circle distance would be R * θ ≈ 6,371,000 m * 0.5 ≈ 3,185,500 meters, which is about 3.185e6 m. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the rocket's speed relative to Earth's surface, but in reality, the Earth's rotation has to be considered for the actual orbital mechanics. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler than I'm making it. Maybe it's asking for the distance the rocket would cover in a circular orbit with speed 6 km/s. But 6 km/s is less than the orbital speed, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rocket's speed as 6 km/s relative to an inertial frame, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, the question says the speed is 6 km/s as measured with respect to Earth. So perhaps the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth's surface, but in space, it's moving faster.

Wait, perhaps there's another factor: when you launch eastward, you get a boost from Earth's rotation. So the rocket's speed relative to Earth's surface is 6 km/s, but relative to the stars, it's higher. But I'm not sure how that affects the distance traveled around Earth.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The rocket is launched eastward, so as it goes up, Earth rotates beneath it. The rocket's horizontal speed relative to Earth is 3 km/s, so in the time it's in the air, it would have moved eastward 3 km/s * 1059.4 s ≈ 3178 km relative to Earth. But the great circle distance is the shortest path along Earth's surface between launch and landing points. But is that the same as 3178 km? Or is it the arc length corresponding to the angle the rocket has moved around Earth?

Wait, the Earth's circumference is about 40,075 km, so moving 3178 km eastward would be an angle of 3178 / 40075 ≈ 0.0793 radians, which is about 4.55 degrees. So the great circle distance would be the chord length or the arc length. But the problem states 'great circle distance,' which is the shortest path along the surface, so it's the arc length, which would be R * θ, where θ is 0.0793 radians. So R is 6.371e6 meters, so 6.371e6 * 0.0793 ≈ 5.05e5 meters, which is 505 km. That's not matching any options either.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rocket's speed relative to Earth, but the great circle distance is calculated based on the rocket's orbital period. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance the rocket travels along its trajectory, not along Earth's surface. But the question specifies 'around the earth,' so it's likely the path along Earth's surface.

Wait, another thought: maybe the rocket's trajectory is such that it follows a great circle path, so the great circle distance is the length of the path it would take to go around Earth. But I'm not sure how that connects to the given speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the rocket's speed is such that it circles Earth exactly once, so the distance would be Earth's circumference. But that would require a speed of 40,075 km / T, where T is the orbital period. But with a speed of 6 km/s, that's much lower than required for orbit, so it can't circle Earth.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.732 ×10^6 m, which is approximately √3 × 10^6 m, since √3 ≈ 1.732. That makes me think of 6 km/s * sin(60°) which is 5.196 km/s, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rocket's tangential speed relative to Earth's rotation to find how much it circles the Earth. So if the rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s eastward, and Earth's rotation speed is 463 m/s, then the rocket's speed relative to Earth's rotation is 6000 - 463 = 5537 m/s. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and since the rocket is launched eastward, it's gaining on Earth's rotation, so the distance would be based on the relative speed. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the rocket's horizontal speed is 3 km/s, and the time of flight is about 1059 seconds, so the distance is 3 * 1059 ≈ 3177 km, which is 3.177e6 meters. But that's not an option. The closest option is H: 7.238e6 m, but that's more than twice as much.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the time of flight. Let me double-check.

V1y = 6000 * sin(60) ≈ 5196 m/s.

Time to max height: 5196 / 9.81 ≈ 529.7 s.

Total time: 1059.4 s.

V1x = 3000 m/s.

Distance: 3000 * 1059.4 ≈ 3.178e6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Earth's circumference and how much of it the rocket covers during its flight. If the rocket is in the air for 1059.4 seconds, and Earth rotates at 463 m/s, then the distance Earth's surface moves during that time is 463 * 1059.4 ≈ 490,000 meters, or 490 km. But the rocket's horizontal speed relative to Earth is 3000 m/s, so it moves 3000 * 1059.4 ≈ 3,178,000 meters, which is 3178 km. So the distance covered relative to Earth is 3178 km, which is about 3.178e6 m.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth, but in space, it's moving faster, allowing it to orbit Earth. So the great circle distance would be the circumference of the orbit.

So, let's compute the orbital circumference. The rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s eastward, but relative to an inertial frame, it's 6 + 463 ≈ 6463 m/s.

Then, the orbital radius r can be found using v = sqrt(μ / r), where μ = 3.986e14 m³/s².

So r = μ / v² = 3.986e14 / (6463)^2 ≈ 3.986e14 / 4.177e7 ≈ 9.54e6 meters, which is about 9540 km.

Then, the circumference is 2πr ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 9.54e6 ≈ 6.0e7 meters, which is 60,000 km. That's 6.0e7 m, which is 6.0 × 10^7 m. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering Earth's rotation, and the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to an inertial frame. But the question says it's measured with respect to Earth, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option E: 1.732e6 m. Because 6 km/s * sin(60) is approximately 5.196 km/s, which is about 5.196e3 m/s, but that's not directly matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the horizontal distance relative to an inertial frame, which would be (6 km/s + Earth's rotation speed) * time of flight.

Earth's rotation speed is 463 m/s, so total speed relative to inertial frame is 6000 + 463 ≈ 6463 m/s.

Then, distance would be 6463 * 1059.4 ≈ 6,858,000 meters, or 6.858e6 m. That's close to option H:7.238e6 m, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the rocket's speed relative to Earth includes Earth's rotation, so the actual speed in space is higher, leading to a longer distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply using the rocket's speed relative to Earth and the time of flight to calculate the distance, as I did earlier, and the correct answer is 3.178e6 m, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculations again.

V1y = 6000 m/s * sin(60) = 6000 * (√3/2) ≈ 5196 m/s.

Time up: 5196 /9.81 ≈ 529.7 s.

Total time: 1059.4 s.

V1x = 6000 * cos(60) = 3000 m/s.

Distance: 3000 * 1059.4 = 3,178,200 m = 3.178e6 m.

But none of the options match. The closest is option C:2.154e6 m and option H:7.238e6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s, but Earth's rotation adds to it, making the rocket's actual speed in space higher, thus reducing the time of flight because it's moving faster and might go into orbit, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for g, such as 9.8 m/s² instead of 9.81, but that wouldn't change the result significantly.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth, but because it's moving eastward, the effective speed relative to Earth's surface is higher, leading to a longer distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Earth's circumference and how much of it the rocket covers. For example, if the rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s, and Earth's circumference is about 40,075 km, then the time to circle Earth once would be 40,075,000 m / 6000 m/s ≈ 6679 seconds. So if the rocket's flight time is longer than that, it would have circled Earth multiple times.

But earlier, the flight time was about 1059 seconds, which is less than 6679 seconds, so the rocket wouldn't have completed a full circle. So the distance covered would be 6 km/s * 1059 s ≈ 6354 km, which is 6.354e6 m. Still, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the distance along the great circle path that the rocket takes, not the distance along Earth's surface. But that would require knowing the rocket's trajectory, which is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple application of the formula for the range of a projectile, but on a rotating Earth. The standard projectile range formula is (V0² sin(2θ)) / g, but that's in a non-rotating frame. On Earth, the rotation adds a Coriolis effect, which complicates things.

But perhaps the problem is ignoring the Coriolis effect and just using the basic projectile motion, which would give the range as 3 km/s * 1059.4 s ≈ 3.178e6 m, as before.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the rocket's speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth, but it's actually in orbit, so the great circle distance is the circumference of its orbit. Let's compute that.

v = 6 km/s.

Using v = sqrt(μ / r), so r = μ / v².

μ = 3.986e14 m³/s².

v = 6000 m/s.

r = 3.986e14 / (6000)^2 ≈ 3.986e14 / 3.6e7 ≈ 1.107e7 meters, which is 11,070 km.

Circumference: 2πr ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 1.107e7 ≈ 6.95e7 meters, or 69,500 km. That's 6.95e7 m, which is 6.95 × 10^7 m. Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rocket's speed relative to Earth as 6 km/s, but in reality, it's moving at 6 km/s relative to an inertial frame, which would make it orbit with a certain radius. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance the rocket travels relative to Earth's surface, which would be 3 km/s * 1059 s ≈ 3.178e6 m, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking back at the options, option E is 1.732e6 m, which is exactly √3 × 1e6 m. Since sin(60) is √3/2, perhaps the problem is asking for the vertical component of the speed multiplied by time, but that would be the vertical distance, not the great circle distance.

Wait, but the vertical component is 5.196 km/s, and time is about 1059 s, so 5.196 * 1059 ≈ 5.5e6 m, which is 5.5e6 m, but that's not an option either.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the problem is considering that the rocket's path is a great circle, so the distance is the length of that circle, which would be 2πR, where R is Earth's radius. But 2π * 6.371e6 ≈ 4.007e7 m, which is 40,070 km. That's option I:4.317e6 m, but it's not close.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the distance the rocket travels along its trajectory, not along Earth's surface. But that would require integrating the path, which is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply using the rocket's speed relative to Earth and the time of flight to find the distance, which would be 3 km/s * 1059 s ≈ 3.178e6 m, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C:2.154e6 m, which is approximately 2.154e6 m. Wait, 2.154 is roughly √3 * 1.23, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the time of flight. Let me check the time again.

V1y = 6000 * sin(60) = 6000 * 0.8660 ≈ 5196 m/s.

Time to reach max height: 5196 / 9.81 ≈ 529.7 s.

Total time: 1059.4 s.

Yes, that's correct. So the distance is 3 km/s * 1059.4 s ≈ 3.178e6 m.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's considering the rocket's speed relative to Earth's rotation, so the effective speed is higher, leading to a longer distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the distance around Earth that the rocket would cover in one orbit, but given that 6 km/s is less than orbital speed, it can't complete an orbit. So perhaps the answer is zero, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance the rocket travels in space, but that's not clear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s, but in the inertial frame, it's 6 km/s plus Earth's rotation speed, so 6.463 km/s. Then, the time to orbit Earth once would be Earth's circumference divided by that speed: 40,075 km / 6.463 km/s ≈ 6,200 seconds. But the flight time is only 1059 seconds, so the rocket doesn't complete an orbit.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the distance the rocket travels relative to Earth's surface, which is 3 km/s * 1059 s ≈ 3.178e6 m, but since that's not an option, maybe the intended answer is option E:1.732e6 m, which is √3 × 1e6 m. Since the vertical component is 5.196e3 m/s, which is √3 × 3e3 m/s, and the time is about 1059 s, perhaps the intended distance is based on the vertical component, but that doesn't make sense for a great circle distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Earth's radius and the rocket's speed to find the angular distance, then multiply by radius. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options in terms of √3. Option E is 1.732e6 m, which is √3 × 1e6. So maybe the intended answer is option E, but I'm not certain how that connects.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the initial speed and the sine of the angle to find the great circle distance. So 6e3 m/s * sin(60) * time. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the correct answer is option E:1.732e6 m, as it's the only option involving √3, which appears in the calculations.

The problem involves a ballistic rocket launched eastward from the equator at a 60° angle with an initial speed of 6 km/s relative to Earth. The goal is to determine the great circle distance around Earth covered by the rocket.

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The rocket's speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s.  
   - The angle of launch is 60°, so the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity are:  
     \[
     V_{1y} = 6000 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 5196 \, \text{m/s}, \quad V_{1x} = 6000 \cdot \cos(60^\circ) = 3000 \, \text{m/s}.
     \]

2. **Time of Flight**:  
   - The time to reach maximum height is:  
     \[
     t_{\text{up}} = \frac{V_{1y}}{g} = \frac{5196}{9.81} \approx 529.7 \, \text{seconds}.
     \]  
   - Total time of flight is twice this:  
     \[
     T = 2 \cdot t_{\text{up}} \approx 1059.4 \, \text{seconds}.
     \]

3. **Horizontal Distance**:  
   - The horizontal distance relative to Earth is:  
     \[
     D = V_{1x} \cdot T = 3000 \cdot 1059.4 \approx 3.178 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}.
     \]  
   - This value does not match any of the provided options.

4. **Revisiting Earth's Rotation**:  
   - Earth's rotational speed at the equator is approximately 463 m/s.  
   - The rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame is:  
     \[
     V_{\text{inertial}} = 6000 + 463 \approx 6463 \, \text{m/s}.
     \]  
   - Using this speed, the time to orbit Earth once is:  
     \[
     T_{\text{orbit}} = \frac{\text{Earth's circumference}}{V_{\text{inertial}}} = \frac{40,075,000}{6463} \approx 6,200 \, \text{seconds}.
     \]  
   - Since the flight time is only 1059.4 seconds, the rocket does not complete a full orbit.

5. **Alternative Approach**:  
   - The problem may be asking for the great circle distance based on the rocket's speed relative to Earth's surface.  
   - The distance covered relative to Earth is:  
     \[
     D = 3000 \cdot 1059.4 \approx 3.178 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}.
     \]  
   - This value still does not match any options. However, the closest match involving \(\sqrt{3}\) (from the angle of 60°) is option E: \(1.732 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\).

Given the complexity and the mismatch in calculations, the most plausible answer based on the provided options and the involvement of \(\sqrt{3}\) is:

**Answer: E**
