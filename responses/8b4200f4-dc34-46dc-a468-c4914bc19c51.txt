Question:

A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder
B: Social anxiety disorder
C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder
D: Adjustment disorder
E: Post-traumatic stress disorder
F: Hypothyroidism
G: Panic disorder
H: Agoraphobia
I: Specific phobia
J: Acute stress disorder

Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 2-week history of symptoms: increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. She was robbed at knifepoint three weeks ago. So, that's a significant stressful event. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism, treated with levothyroxine, and she uses an OTC inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. 

Her vital signs: blood pressure is 140/80, which is a bit high—maybe in the prehypertensive range. Pulse is 100/min, which is tachycardia. On exam, she has dry skin and hair, which makes me think about hypothyroidism because dry skin is a common symptom. She's cooperative but looks anxious, glancing around quickly when there's a loud noise outside. That sounds like hypervigilant behavior, which is a symptom of anxiety or PTSD.

The lab results: leukocyte count is 12,000/mm³. That's elevated, which might suggest infection or stress response. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 5.0 μU/mL. Normal TSH is usually around 0.4-4.0, so 5 is slightly elevated, indicating possible hypothyroidism. But she's already on levothyroxine, so maybe her levels are being monitored.

ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia can be due to anxiety, fever, or stress.

Now, considering the options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) – persistent worry, but her symptoms started after a trauma, which makes me think more about PTSD.

B: Social anxiety disorder – fear of social situations, which doesn't seem to fit here.

C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) – intrusive thoughts and compulsions, not matching the symptoms described.

D: Adjustment disorder – reaction to a stressful event, but it's usually less severe and more about emotional disturbance without the re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD.

E: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – caused by a traumatic event, with symptoms like hypervigilance, re-experiencing, and avoidance. Fits well with her history of robbery and current symptoms.

F: Hypothyroidism – her TSH is slightly elevated, but she's on medication. Her anxiety and tachycardia could be due to hypothyroidism, but her symptoms started after a trauma, which makes me think it's more likely PTSD.

G: Panic disorder – panic attacks, which she doesn't describe, though her tachycardia could be part of that.

H: Agoraphobia – fear of places, but she doesn't describe specific fears of places.

I: Specific phobia – fear of a specific object or situation, which isn't indicated here.

J: Acute stress disorder – occurs within a month of trauma, with symptoms like dissociation, confusion. It's similar to PTSD but shorter duration. She's been symptomatic for 2 weeks, so it's possible, but I think PTSD is more likely as the symptoms are more severe and persistent.

Putting it together: She experienced a traumatic event (robbery), and now has symptoms like anxiety, irritability, hypervigilance (glancing around when a noise happened), and physiological symptoms like tachycardia. Her thyroid levels are slightly elevated, but given she's on treatment, it's less likely to be the primary issue unless her dosage is off. However, her symptoms align more with PTSD than hypothyroidism because of the trauma history and the nature of her anxiety.

Wait, though, could her symptoms be both? She has a thyroid issue and PTSD. But the question is asking for the most likely diagnosis. The robbery happened three weeks ago, and her symptoms started two weeks ago. So the timing aligns with an adjustment disorder or PTSD. Adjustment disorder is a reaction to a specific stressor, but PTSD involves re-experiencing the event, which I'm not sure she has described. Let me check the symptoms again.

She has increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, difficulty concentrating. No mention of flashbacks or nightmares, but hypervigilance is present. Her physical signs like tachycardia could be due to anxiety or stress. The ECG tachycardia supports that.

Alternatively, could it be acute stress disorder? Acute stress disorder occurs within a month after trauma, with symptoms like dissociation, confusion, and anxiety. She's been two weeks, so it's possible, but the question is about the most likely.

Another angle: Her thyroid levels are slightly elevated. Levothyroxine is for hypothyroidism. If her TSH is 5.0, maybe her dose isn't adequate, leading to symptoms of hypothyroidism (like anxiety, dry skin, fatigue, weight gain). But she's on levothyroxine, so maybe she isn't compliant, or her levels are subclinical. However, her anxiety could be due to hypothyroidism, but the robbery happened three weeks ago, which is a possible trigger for her symptoms, making me think it's more likely PTSD or adjustment disorder.

Wait, the options include both F (hypothyroidism) and E (PTSD). So, could it be both? But the question is about the most likely diagnosis. Her symptoms started after the robbery, so the trauma is a precipitating factor. Her anxiety, irritability, and hypervigilance are classic for PTSD. The hypothyroidism may be contributing, but it's a chronic condition she's managing. The acute symptoms seem more aligned with PTSD.

Another point: Her thyroid levels are slightly elevated, but she's on levothyroxine. Maybe her TSH is 5.0 because her dose needs adjustment, but her anxiety and other symptoms are more likely due to the trauma.

So, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is E: Post-traumatic stress disorder.

The patient's symptoms, including anxiety, irritability, hypervigilance, and physiological signs like tachycardia, align with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a traumatic robbery. While hypothyroidism could contribute, her symptoms are more consistent with PTSD given the trauma history and symptom onset. 

Answer: E
