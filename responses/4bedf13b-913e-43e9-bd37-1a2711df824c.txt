Okay, so I have this question about the second law of thermodynamics, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about the second law.

The second law of thermodynamics is all about the direction of natural processes, especially regarding heat transfer. I remember that it states that heat tends to flow from a hotter object to a colder one, and it doesn't go the other way without some external intervention.

The question is asking, "The second law of thermodynamics tells us that heat doesn’t flow from..." So I'm looking for a situation where heat wouldn't naturally occur. The options are A through J.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: hot to cold without external energy. Wait, isn't that normal? Heat naturally flows from hot to cold. So if it's without external energy, that's the usual case. So the second law doesn't say it doesn't happen; it says without external energy, it goes from hot to cold. So probably not the answer.

Option B: cold to hot ever. Hmm, that's interesting. So does heat ever flow from cold to hot? Well, yes, but it requires some kind of work or external energy. So the second law says it can't happen spontaneously. So if the option is saying "cold to hot ever," that's not correct because it can happen, just not without some work.

Option C: hot to cold without internal energy. Wait, internal energy is the energy contained within a system. So if heat flows from hot to cold without internal energy, I'm not sure. Maybe this is a tricky way of phrasing it. But I think the key is whether external energy is involved.

Option D: cold to hot without a change in state. I'm not certain about this. Changing state might involve phase changes, but I'm not sure how that relates. The second law is more about the direction without external energy.

Option E: hot to cold without a change in temperature. That doesn't make sense because when heat flows, the temperature of the hotter object decreases and the colder one increases. So without a change in temperature, heat transfer wouldn't happen. But wait, the question is about what the second law says doesn't happen. So E says heat doesn't flow from hot to cold without a change in temp. But actually, when heat flows from hot to cold, there is a change in temp. So maybe E is correct because without a change, it can't happen. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option F: hot to cold without a change in state. I'm not sure what "change in state" refers to here. Maybe phase changes? But the second law doesn't specifically say anything about state changes. So I'm not sure if F is correct.

Option G: cold to hot without internal pressure. Internal pressure? I'm not sure. The second law usually talks about the impossibility of heat flowing from cold to hot without work. So G might not be the right choice.

Option H: cold to hot without a change in temperature. Similar to E, but in reverse. If there's no change in temperature, heat can't flow. But H says cold to hot without a change in temp, which is impossible because if heat flows from cold to hot, the temperatures would change. So H might be correct, but I'm not certain.

Option I: hot to cold ever. No, that's not right because heat does flow from hot to cold all the time.

Option J: cold to hot without external energy. Yes, this aligns with the second law. Heat can't flow from cold to hot without some external work being done. So J is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what the second law says doesn't happen. So looking back, the second law states that heat can't spontaneously flow from a colder to a hotter body without external work. So the correct answer would be the option that says heat doesn't flow from cold to hot without external energy.

Looking at the options, J says "cold to hot without external energy." So J is the correct answer because the second law prohibits that without external work.

Wait, but looking back at the initial analysis, I thought J was correct. So the answer should be J.

The second law of thermodynamics states that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body without external energy. Among the options provided, the correct answer is the one that describes this condition accurately. 

The answer is J.
