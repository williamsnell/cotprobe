Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: Using the given formula, if a reaction is provided with 84g of ethane and unlimited oxygen, how many grams of carbon dioxide would result? The options are from A to J, with various grams listed.

The reaction given is the unbalanced equation: C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. So, my first thought is that I need to balance this chemical equation because right now, the atoms aren't balanced on both sides. Balancing equations is a crucial step in stoichiometry problems like this.

Let me write down the unbalanced equation again:

C2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O

Now, I'll count the atoms on each side. On the left, I have 2 C atoms and 4 H atoms from ethane, and O2 is diatomic, so each molecule has 2 O atoms. On the right, CO2 has one C and two O per molecule, and H2O has two H and one O per molecule.

Starting with carbon, on the left, there are 2 C in C2H4, and on the right, each CO2 has 1 C. So I'll need 2 CO2 molecules to balance the C. Let me write that down:

C2H4 + O2 → 2CO2 + H2O

Now looking at hydrogen. Ethane has 4 H, so each H2O has 2 H. Therefore, I need 2 H2O molecules to balance the H:

C2H4 + O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O

Now I'll check oxygen. On the right, each CO2 has 2 O, so 2 CO2 gives 4 O. Each H2O has 1 O, so 2 H2O gives 2 O. Total O on the right is 4 + 2 = 6 O atoms. Since each O2 molecule has 2 O atoms, I'll need 3 O2 molecules to provide 6 O atoms (because 3 * 2 = 6). So the balanced equation is:

C2H4 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O

Great, now the equation is balanced. Next, I need to find out how much CO2 is produced when 84 grams of ethane (C2H4) reacts. Since oxygen is unlimited, it won't be a limiting reagent, so we only need to consider ethane.

I'll start by finding the molar mass of ethane (C2H4). Carbon's atomic weight is 12 amu, and hydrogen is 1 amu. So the molar mass of C2H4 is:

(2 * 12) + (4 * 1) = 24 + 4 = 28 g/mol.

Now, I need to find out how many moles of C2H4 are present in 84 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass. So:

84 g / 28 g/mol = 3 moles of C2H4.

Looking at the balanced equation, 1 mole of C2H4 produces 2 moles of CO2. So, 3 moles of C2H4 will produce (3 * 2) = 6 moles of CO2.

Next, I'll find the molar mass of CO2. Carbon is 12, oxygen is 16, so:

12 + (2 * 16) = 12 + 32 = 44 g/mol.

Now, the mass of CO2 produced is moles * molar mass:

6 moles * 44 g/mol = 264 grams.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might make a calculation mistake. Let me go through each step again.

1. Molar mass of C2H4: 2*12=24, 4*1=4, total 28 g/mol. Correct.
2. Moles of ethane: 84g /28g/mol=3 moles. Right.
3. Molar ratio: 1 mole C2H4 → 2 moles CO2. So 3→6 moles. Correct.
4. Molar mass CO2: 44 g/mol, so 6*44=264g. Yep.

Looking at the options, option G is 264g. But wait, I should check if I considered everything correctly. Oh, the reaction is complete because oxygen is unlimited, so no issue there. Therefore, the correct answer should be 264 grams, which is option G.
</think>

The balanced reaction is C₂H₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O. The molar mass of ethane (C₂H₄) is 28 g/mol, so 84 g corresponds to 3 moles. From the balanced equation, 1 mole of ethane produces 2 moles of CO₂, giving 6 moles of CO₂. The molar mass of CO₂ is 44 g/mol, so the mass of CO₂ is 6 × 44 = 264 g. 

Answer: G
