Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the 5th term in a series. Let me read it again carefully. The first term is 2, and each subsequent term is -2 multiplied by the preceding term. Hmm, that sounds like a geometric sequence because each term is a multiple of the previous one.

Alright, so in a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio. Here, the common ratio is -2. So the first term, a1, is 2. Let me try to write down the terms one by one to see the pattern.

The first term, a1, is 2. To get the second term, a2, I multiply a1 by -2: 2 * (-2) = -4. So a2 is -4.

Now, a3 would be a2 multiplied by -2: (-4) * (-2) = 8. So a3 is 8.

Next, a4 is a3 times -2: 8 * (-2) = -16. So a4 is -16.

Then, a5 would be a4 times -2: (-16) * (-2) = 32. Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check that. Oh, no, wait, no, because when you multiply two negatives, you get a positive. So yes, 16 times 2 is 32. But wait, no, a4 is -16, so multiplying by -2 would be (-16)*(-2) = 32. So a5 is 32.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 32. So is that the answer? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the terms. Sometimes it's easy to get confused whether we're starting at term 1 or term 0.

Wait, the first term is term 1, so term 2 is second, term 3 third, term 4 fourth, term 5 fifth. So a1 is 2, a2 is -4, a3 is 8, a4 is -16, a5 is 32. So the fifth term is 32. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence. The formula is a_n = a1 * r^(n-1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

So here, a1 is 2, r is -2, and n is 5. Plugging in, a5 = 2 * (-2)^(5-1) = 2 * (-2)^4. Now, (-2)^4 is (-2)*(-2)*(-2)*(-2). Let's calculate that: (-2)*(-2) is 4, 4*(-2) is -8, -8*(-2) is 16. So (-2)^4 is 16. So a5 = 2 * 16 = 32. Yep, that matches what I got before.

So the fifth term is 32, which is option C. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.

The series is a geometric sequence where each term is -2 times the previous term. Starting with 2, the terms are calculated as follows:

- a₁ = 2  
- a₂ = 2 × (-2) = -4  
- a₃ = (-4) × (-2) = 8  
- a₄ = 8 × (-2) = -16  
- a₅ = (-16) × (-2) = 32  

Using the geometric sequence formula, aₙ = a₁ × r^(n-1):  
a₅ = 2 × (-2)⁴ = 2 × 16 = 32.

Answer: C
