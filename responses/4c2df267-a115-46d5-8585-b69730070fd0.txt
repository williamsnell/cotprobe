Question:

assume you are Indonesian. In 2010, the rupiah exchange rate was around IDR15,000/USD, and the consumer price index in Indonesia and the United States was at 100. In 2019, the exchange rate changed to IDR14,000/USD. Simultaneously, Indonesia’s inflation rose 5% due to the consumer price index rising to 105. Meanwhile, the United States’ inflation rate rose 10% due to the consumer price index rising to 110. Whats the real exchange rate?

Options:

A: 14000.00
B: 15500.00
C: 15000.00
D: 16000.00
E: 13500.00
F: 14666.67
G: 13888.89
H: 14800.00
I: 15200.00
J: 13333.33

Okay, so I've got this question about exchange rates and inflation, and I'm supposed to figure out the real exchange rate. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, the question says that in 2010, the exchange rate was IDR15,000 per USD. Both Indonesia and the US had a consumer price index (CPI) of 100. Then, in 2019, the exchange rate changed to IDR14,000 per USD. Indonesia's inflation went up by 5%, so their CPI is now 105. The US had a 10% inflation rate, so their CPI is 110. I need to find the real exchange rate.

Wait, real exchange rate... I remember that the real exchange rate adjusts the nominal exchange rate for inflation differentials. The formula, I think, is something like:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate × (Foreign CPI / Domestic CPI)

But wait, which way around? Because sometimes it's the other way. Let me get this right. The real exchange rate formula is usually expressed as:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate × (Domestic CPI / Foreign CPI)

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The real exchange rate is the nominal rate adjusted by the price levels. So if the domestic country has higher inflation, the real exchange rate would appreciate or depreciate accordingly.

Wait, so the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) × (Price Level Abroad / Price Level Domestic)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (Price Level Domestic / Price Level Abroad). Let me think. Let's say the exchange rate is IDR per USD. So when the US's price level increases, the real exchange rate should change.

Wait, another way: The real exchange rate equation is often written as:

(e) = (E) * (P^*/P)

Where e is the real exchange rate, E is the nominal exchange rate (domestic currency per foreign currency), P* is the foreign price level, and P is the domestic price level.

So in this case, E is the nominal exchange rate, which is IDR14,000 per USD. So E is 14,000. P* is the US's CPI, which is 110, and P is Indonesia's CPI, which is 105.

So real exchange rate e = 14,000 * (110 / 105). Let me calculate that.

110 divided by 105 is approximately 1.0476. Multiply that by 14,000.

14,000 * 1.0476 = let's see:

14,000 * 1 = 14,000

14,000 * 0.0476 ≈ 666.4

So total is approximately 14,000 + 666.4 = 14,666.4.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's an option F which is 14,666.67. That must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way: the real exchange rate can also be thought of as the nominal rate multiplied by the ratio of foreign prices to domestic prices. Since the US inflation was higher, its prices went up more. So the real exchange rate should be higher than the nominal rate, because the US goods are more expensive relative to Indonesia.

So with the nominal rate at 14,000, and the ratio 110/105 = 1.0476, the real rate is 14,000 * 1.0476 ≈14,666.67, which is option F.
</think>

The real exchange rate is calculated by adjusting the nominal exchange rate for inflation differentials. Using the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate × (Foreign CPI / Domestic CPI)

Given the nominal exchange rate of IDR14,000/USD, Indonesia's CPI of 105, and the US's CPI of 110, the real exchange rate is:

14,000 × (110 / 105) ≈ 14,666.67.

Thus, the correct answer is:

F

Answer: F
