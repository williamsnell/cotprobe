Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a boat and a bottle. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the boat is going upstream, which means against the current. The boat's speed relative to the water is v, but we don't know it. When the boat starts, someone drops a bottle into the water, and 15 minutes later, the boat turns around and goes downstream. Eventually, the boat catches up with the bottle, and by then, the bottle has drifted one mile downstream from where it was dropped.

I need to find the speed of the current, right? Let's denote the current's speed as c. Since the bottle is just drifting, it's moving at the speed of the current, so the bottle's speed relative to the ground is c.

Let me think about the timeline. The boat goes upstream for 15 minutes, then turns around and goes downstream. The bottle is moving at c the whole time. When the boat turns around, the bottle has already been moving for 15 minutes, so it's c*(15/60) = c/4 miles downstream.

Wait, but the bottle ends up one mile downstream from the drop point when the boat catches up. So the total time the bottle was in the water is the same as the time the boat was going upstream plus the time the boat took to come back downstream.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The boat starts upstream, drops the bottle, and then 15 minutes later, the boat turns around. So the bottle has been drifting for 15 minutes before the boat turns around, and then some more time after that until the boat catches up.

So the total time the bottle is in the water is 15 minutes plus the time it takes for the boat to come back and catch it. Let me denote the time after the boat turns around as t. So the total time the bottle has been drifting is 15 minutes + t.

Wait, but time is in hours because the speed is in miles per hour. So 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. So the bottle's total drift time is 0.25 + t hours. Therefore, the distance the bottle has moved is c*(0.25 + t) = 1 mile.

So equation one: c*(0.25 + t) = 1.

Now, let's think about the boat's motion. When the boat is going upstream, its speed relative to the ground is (v - c). Because the current is against it, so the ground speed is boat speed minus current. It's moving upstream for 0.25 hours, so the distance it covers upstream is (v - c)*0.25.

Then, the boat turns around and goes downstream. Its speed relative to the ground is (v + c). The distance it needs to cover to reach the bottle is the distance it went upstream plus the distance the bottle has moved in the time t. Wait, no. The bottle is moving downstream, so when the boat turns around, the bottle is already c*(0.25) miles downstream. Then, during time t, the bottle moves another c*t miles. So the total distance the bottle is from the drop point when the boat starts downstream is c*(0.25 + t) = 1 mile, as before.

Wait, but the boat has to cover the distance it went upstream plus the distance the bottle moved during t. So the boat's downstream distance is (v - c)*0.25 + c*t, and it's moving at speed (v + c) during time t. So the distance the boat covers downstream is (v + c)*t.

Setting these equal: (v + c)*t = (v - c)*0.25 + c*t.

Wait, because the boat is trying to cover the distance it went upstream plus the additional distance the bottle moved during time t. So:

(v + c)*t = (v - c)*0.25 + c*t.

Let me rearrange this equation.

(v + c)*t = (v - c)*0.25 + c*t.

Subtract c*t from both sides:

v*t + c*t - c*t = (v - c)*0.25.

So v*t = (v - c)*0.25.

Hmm, that's one equation. Now I have two equations:

1) c*(0.25 + t) = 1.

2) v*t = (v - c)*0.25.

I need to solve for c. Let's see.

From equation 2: v*t = 0.25v - 0.25c.

Rearranging: v*t - 0.25v = -0.25c.

Factor out v: v(t - 0.25) = -0.25c.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe express t from equation 1.

From equation 1: 0.25 + t = 1/c.

So t = (1/c) - 0.25.

Now plug this into equation 2.

v * [(1/c) - 0.25] = (v - c) * 0.25.

Let me expand the left side:

v*(1/c) - v*0.25 = 0.25v - 0.25c.

Wait, let's write it out:

(v/c) - 0.25v = 0.25v - 0.25c.

Bring all terms to one side:

(v/c) - 0.25v - 0.25v + 0.25c = 0.

Simplify:

(v/c) - 0.5v + 0.25c = 0.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can multiply both sides by c to eliminate the denominator.

v - 0.5v c + 0.25c² = 0.

Wait, that's:

v - 0.5 v c + 0.25 c² = 0.

Let me rearrange terms:

0.25 c² - 0.5 v c + v = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of c. Let me write it as:

0.25 c² - 0.5 v c + v = 0.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate decimals:

c² - 2v c + 4v = 0.

Hmm, quadratic in c: c² - 2v c +4v =0.

Let me see if I can factor this or use quadratic formula.

Discriminant D = (2v)^2 -4*1*4v =4v² -16v.

Wait, but this seems messy. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The relative speed when the boat is going downstream. When the boat turns around, the bottle is moving at c. The boat is moving at (v + c) relative to ground, while the bottle is moving at c. So the relative speed between the boat and the bottle is (v + c) - c = v. Because the boat is going downstream faster than the bottle is moving downstream, so the boat is approaching the bottle at speed v.

Wait, that's a good point. So the distance between the boat and the bottle when the boat turns around is the distance the boat went upstream, which is (v - c)*0.25. But the bottle is moving downstream, so the separation is (v - c)*0.25 - (c * 0.25) ? Wait, not sure. Let me think again.

At the moment the boat turns around, the bottle has moved c*0.25 miles downstream. The boat has moved (v - c)*0.25 upstream. So the distance between the boat and the bottle is (v - c)*0.25 + c*0.25 = v * 0.25. Because the boat is upstream, the bottle is downstream. So the separation is (v - c)*0.25 + c*0.25 = v*0.25.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the boat went upstream (v - c)*0.25, and the bottle went downstream c*0.25. So the total distance between them when the boat turns around is (v - c)*0.25 + c*0.25 = v*0.25.

Then, the boat is going downstream at speed (v + c), and the bottle is moving at c. So the relative speed of the boat with respect to the bottle is (v + c) - c = v. So the time it takes to catch up is the separation distance divided by the relative speed: (v * 0.25) / v = 0.25 hours, which is 15 minutes.

Wait, that's interesting. So t = 0.25 hours.

But from equation 1, c*(0.25 + t) =1.

We have t=0.25, so c*(0.25 +0.25)=1 → c*0.5=1 → c=2 miles per hour.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the current is 2 mph.

Wait, but let me check that. Because when the boat turns around, the separation is v *0.25, and the relative speed is v, so time to catch up is 0.25 hours, which is 15 minutes. So t =0.25.

Then, the bottle has been in the water for 0.25 +0.25=0.5 hours, so c*0.5=1 → c=2 mph.

Yes, that makes sense. So the current is 2 mph.

The problem involves a boat traveling upstream and then downstream, with a bottle dropped into the water at the start. The key is to determine the speed of the current. Let’s denote the current’s speed as \( c \) (in miles per hour) and the boat’s speed relative to the water as \( v \).

### Step 1: Analyze the bottle’s motion
The bottle is dropped at the start of the trip and drifts with the current. After 15 minutes (0.25 hours), the boat turns around and heads downstream. By the time the boat catches up with the bottle, the bottle has drifted 1 mile downstream. The total time the bottle is in the water is the time the boat spends going upstream (0.25 hours) plus the time it takes for the boat to turn around and catch up (\( t \) hours). Thus, the bottle’s total drift time is \( 0.25 + t \) hours, and the distance it drifts is:

\[
c \cdot (0.25 + t) = 1
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the boat’s motion
When the boat is going upstream, its ground speed is \( v - c \). It travels upstream for 0.25 hours, covering a distance of \( (v - c) \cdot 0.25 \). When the boat turns around, it goes downstream with a ground speed of \( v + c \). During the time \( t \), the boat covers a distance of \( (v + c) \cdot t \) to catch up with the bottle.

At the moment the boat turns around, the bottle is \( c \cdot 0.25 \) miles downstream. The boat must cover the distance it traveled upstream plus the additional distance the bottle drifts during \( t \), which is \( (v - c) \cdot 0.25 + c \cdot t \). Setting the distances equal:

\[
(v + c) \cdot t = (v - c) \cdot 0.25 + c \cdot t
\]

Simplify:

\[
v \cdot t = (v - c) \cdot 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( t \)
From the bottle’s motion:

\[
c \cdot (0.25 + t) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0.25 + t = \frac{1}{c} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{1}{c} - 0.25
\]

Substitute \( t \) into the boat’s motion equation:

\[
v \cdot \left( \frac{1}{c} - 0.25 \right) = (v - c) \cdot 0.25
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{v}{c} - 0.25v = 0.25v - 0.25c
\]

Rearrange:

\[
\frac{v}{c} = 0.5v - 0.25c
\]

Multiply through by \( c \):

\[
v = 0.5v \cdot c - 0.25c^2
\]

Rearrange terms:

\[
0.25c^2 - 0.5vc + v = 0
\]

Multiply by 4 to eliminate decimals:

\[
c^2 - 2vc + 4v = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( c \). Solving for \( c \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
c = \frac{2v \pm \sqrt{(2v)^2 - 16v}}{2}
\]

Simplify the discriminant:

\[
(2v)^2 - 16v = 4v^2 - 16v = 4v(v - 4)
\]

For real solutions, \( v > 4 \). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the relative speed between the boat and the bottle when the boat turns around is \( v \). The separation distance is \( v \cdot 0.25 \), and the time to catch up is:

\[
t = \frac{v \cdot 0.25}{v} = 0.25 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the total time the bottle is in the water is \( 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 \) hours. Using the bottle’s drift distance:

\[
c \cdot 0.5 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = 2 \, \text{mph}
\]

### Final Answer:
The speed of the current is **2 miles per hour**.
