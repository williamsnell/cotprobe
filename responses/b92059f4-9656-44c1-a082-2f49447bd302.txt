Question:

A shopper slipped and fell on a wet spot at the local mall, suffering injuries. The shopper has sued the mall owner for negligence. At trial, the shopper's housekeeper testified that the shopper was bedridden and unable to work for a month because of the sprained back she suffered when she fell at the mall. The housekeeper also testified that about one week after the shopper returned home from the hospital, the shopper told her, "My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again. " The mall's counsel then moved to strike the housekeeper's testimony. The motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the housekeeper's testimony is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
B: granted, because the housekeeper's testimony is based on the shopper's subjective self-assessment.
C: denied, because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as an excited utterance.
D: denied, because the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible as an adoptive admission.
E: granted, because the housekeeper's testimony is not related to the case.
F: denied, because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.
G: denied, because the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible as a present sense impression.
H: denied, because the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible as a statement for the purpose of medical treatment.
I: granted, because the housekeeper's testimony is not based on her firsthand knowledge.
J: granted, because the housekeeper's testimony would be self-serving.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about hearsay exceptions. Let me take it step by step.

The scenario is that a shopper sued the mall owner for negligence after slipping and falling. The shopper's housekeeper testified about the shopper's inability to work and her statements about her back pain. The mall's counsel moved to strike the testimony, so we need to determine if the motion should be granted or denied.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If it's hearsay, it's generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception.

Looking at the testimony, the housekeeper is recounting what the shopper said: "My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again." This is definitely an out-of-court statement being used to prove the truth of the statement (i.e., that the shopper was in severe pain), so it's hearsay.

Now, I need to see if any exception applies. Let's go through the options.

Option A says it's hearsay not within any exception. But maybe there's an exception here, so I shouldn't jump to A yet.

Option B claims it's based on the shopper's subjective self-assessment. I'm not sure how that applies. Subjective statements can sometimes be admitted if they're about a present state of mind, but I think there's a specific exception for that.

Option C suggests it's an excited utterance. Excited utterances are made under the stress of a startling event and relate to it. The shopper's statement was a week after the fall. That might be too long; excited utterances usually happen contemporaneously. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D says it's an adoptive admission. Adoptive admissions are statements that the party has adopted, like by words or conduct. Here, the shopper made the statement, but the housekeeper is testifying about it. I think adoptive admissions are more about the opposing party's statements, not the plaintiff's own statements, unless they're offered against them. Not sure if this applies here.

Option E says the testimony isn't related to the case. That doesn't seem right because the shopper's condition is directly relevant to her injuries and the damages she's claiming.

Option F suggests it's admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition. I remember there's an exception for statements about the declarant's then-existing state of mind or emotion, which includes statements about pain. So if the statement was made while the pain was happening or shortly after, it might fit. The shopper said this a week after returning home, so maybe it's still about her present condition then.

Option G mentions present sense impression. That's when a statement describes an event made while perceiving it or immediately thereafter. The statement here was a week later, so probably not a present sense impression. So G might not be correct.

Option H says it's for medical treatment. I think the exception is for statements made to a medical professional for diagnosis or treatment. The shopper didn't necessarily say this to a doctor, so H doesn't apply.

Option I claims the testimony isn't based on firsthand knowledge. Wait, the housekeeper heard it directly from the shopper, so she has firsthand knowledge of the statement. So I's argument that it's not firsthand knowledge doesn't hold. So I should be denied, not granted. So the motion shouldn't be granted because of that.

Option J says it's self-serving. Self-serving statements are often inadmissible when offered by a party in their own interest. But here, the shopper is the plaintiff, and the statement is being offered by her (through the housekeeper) to support her case. But the hearsay rule is about whether it's an exception, not necessarily about self-serving per se. So J might not be the right reason here.

Putting it together, the key issue is whether the statement is admissible under an exception. The statement about the pain seems to fit the exception for declarations of present bodily condition (Option F). The shopper was describing her current pain a week after the incident, which relates to her then-existing condition. So the testimony should be admitted as such, meaning the motion to strike should be denied.

Looking back at the options, F says it's admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition. So the correct answer would be F, meaning the motion should be denied.

The housekeeper's testimony recounting the shopper's statement about severe back pain is hearsay. However, it falls under the exception for declarations of present bodily condition, as the statement describes the shopper's then-existing pain. Therefore, the motion to strike should be denied.
