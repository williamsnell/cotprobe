Question:

When the AQR partnership was formed, partner Acre contributed land with a fair market value of $100,000 and a tax basis of $60,000 in exchange for a one-third interest in the partnership. The AQR partnership agreement specifies that each partner will share equally in the partnership’s profits and losses. During its first year of operation, AQR sold the land to an unrelated third party for $160,000. What is the proper tax treatment of the sale?

Options:

A: Each partner reports a capital gain of $40,000.
B: Each partner reports a capital gain of $50,000.
C: The entire gain of $160,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.
D: Each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.
E: The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.
F: The first $60,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $40,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.
G: The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.
H: The entire gain of $60,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.
I: The first $40,000 of gain is shared equally by all the partners, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is allocated to Acre.
J: The entire gain of $100,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tax question about the AQR partnership. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

So, partner Acre contributed land with a fair market value of $100,000 and a tax basis of $60,000. He got a one-third interest in the partnership. The partnership agreement says they share profits and losses equally. Then, the partnership sold the land for $160,000. The question is about the tax treatment of that sale.

Hmm, I remember that when a partner contributes property to a partnership, the basis in the partnership's books is usually the same as the partner's basis. So Acre's basis is $60k, right? But the fair market value is higher, at $100k. So when the partnership sells the land for $160k, the total gain is $60k because 160 - 100 = 60k. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the basis for the partnership's asset is the partner's basis, which is $60k. So the gain would be 160k - 60k = 100k? Or is it based on the original partner's basis?

Wait, let me think again. Acre contributed land with a tax basis of $60k and FMV $100k. The partnership records the land at $100k because that's the fair market value, right? So when the partnership sells it for $160k, the gain is $60k (160 - 100). But wait, no—the tax basis is $60k. So the gain is 160 - 60 = 100k. Wait, that's confusing. Because the partnership's basis is $60k, so the gain is $100k. But I think when a partnership sells property, the gain is based on the partnership's basis, not the individual partner's.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. When a partner contributes property to a partnership, the partnership takes the basis as the partner's adjusted basis. So Acre's basis is $60k. So the partnership's basis in the land is $60k. When they sell it for $160k, the gain is $100k (160 - 60). But wait, that's the total gain for the partnership. But how does this get allocated to the partners?

The partnership agreement says profits and losses are shared equally. So since it's a three-person partnership, each gets one-third. So each partner would report a share of the gain. But wait, there's also the initial contribution to consider. The land's FMV was $100k, which might affect the basis.

Wait, no. The partnership's basis is $60k. So the gain is $100k. Since they share equally, each partner gets 1/3 of $100k, which is about $33,333.33. So each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.33.

Looking at the options, option D says each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333, which matches. But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes when a partner contributes property, their basis in the partnership is based on their contribution. But I think I'm correct that the gain is 160-60=100k, split equally.

Wait, but another angle: when the partner contributes land, their basis in the partnership is based on their contribution. So Acre's basis in the partnership is $60k, but the other partners' basis would be whatever they contributed. But the question doesn't say anything about other contributions. So perhaps the sale's gain is calculated as 160-60=100k, which is a total gain. Since the partnership agreement says they share equally, each partner (assuming three partners) gets 1/3 of 100k, which is about $33,333. So option D.

Wait, but let me think about whether the gain is considered as a sale by the partnership, which would then pass through to the partners. So the partnership's basis is $60k, sold for $160k, so gain is $100k. Each partner shares equally, so each gets 100/3 ≈ 33,333. So D is correct.

Alternatively, is there any other consideration, like Acre's basis and whether any part is treated as a return of basis or something else? No, I think the gain is all capital gain, split equally.

When the AQR partnership sold the land for $160,000, the tax basis of the land was $60,000 (Acre's tax basis). The gain on the sale is calculated as $160,000 - $60,000 = $100,000. Since the partnership agreement specifies that profits and losses are shared equally among the partners, and assuming there are three partners, each partner would share one-third of the gain. Therefore, each partner would report a capital gain of $100,000 / 3 ≈ $33,333. 

The correct answer is:

D: Each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.
