Question:

An automobile of mass 50 slugs is traveling at 30 ft/sec. The driver applies the brakes in such a way that the velo-city decreases to zero according to the relation v = v_0 - kt^2, where v_0 = 30 ft/sec, k = 0.30 ft/sec^3, and t is the time in seconds after the brakes are applied. Find the resultant force decelerating the automobile, 5 sec after the brakes are applied.

Options:

A: -225 lb
B: -100 lb
C: -50 lb
D: -200 lb
E: -150 lb
F: -75 lb
G: -300 lb
H: -250 lb
I: -175 lb
J: -125 lb

Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the resultant force decelerating an automobile 5 seconds after the brakes are applied. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that force is related to mass and acceleration through Newton's second law, F = ma. So I'll need to find the acceleration at t=5 seconds to compute the force.

The problem gives the velocity as a function of time: v = v₀ - kt². Here, v₀ is 30 ft/sec, k is 0.30 ft/sec³, and t is time in seconds. I think I should find the acceleration by taking the derivative of velocity with respect to time because acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

Taking the derivative of v with respect to t: dv/dt = -2kt. Oh wait, because the derivative of kt² is 2kt, so with the negative sign, it becomes -2kt. So acceleration a(t) = -2kt.

Now, plugging in the values at t=5 seconds: a(5) = -2 * 0.30 * 5. Let me calculate that. 0.3 times 5 is 1.5, multiplied by 2 gives 3. So a(5) = -3 ft/sec². The negative sign indicates deceleration, which makes sense since the car is slowing down.

Next, I need to find the force. The mass of the automobile is given as 50 slugs. I remember that in the English system, mass in slugs, acceleration in ft/sec², so force F = m * a. So F = 50 * (-3) = -150 lb. The negative sign here indicates the direction is opposite to the motion, which is correct for a decelerating force.

Looking at the options, E is -150 lb. So I think that's the correct answer. Wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check the steps. Velocity function correct, derivative taken correctly, then plugging in t=5. Mass and acceleration multiplied right. Yeah, I think E is correct.

To find the resultant force decelerating the automobile 5 seconds after the brakes are applied, we start by determining the acceleration at that time. The velocity is given by \( v = v_0 - kt^2 \), where \( v_0 = 30 \, \text{ft/sec} \), \( k = 0.30 \, \text{ft/sec}^3 \), and \( t = 5 \, \text{sec} \). Taking the derivative of velocity with respect to time gives the acceleration:  
\[
a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -2kt
\]
Substituting \( k = 0.30 \) and \( t = 5 \):  
\[
a(5) = -2 \cdot 0.30 \cdot 5 = -3 \, \text{ft/sec}^2
\]
The negative sign indicates deceleration. Using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where the mass \( m = 50 \, \text{slugs} \):  
\[
F = 50 \cdot (-3) = -150 \, \text{lb}
\]
The negative sign confirms the force is decelerating the automobile.
