Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about marketing functions according to the British Government. The question asks which of the options is NOT a marketing function. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one doesn't belong.

First, I should recall what marketing functions typically include. Marketing is about promoting products, understanding customers, creating strategies, and managing relationships. Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Create advertising campaigns. That's definitely marketing. Advertising is a core part of promoting products, so A is a marketing function.

B: Organize marketing events. Marketing events like product launches or promotional events are part of marketing strategies, so B is also a marketing function.

C: Promote marketing intelligence. Marketing intelligence involves gathering and analyzing data about the market, competitors, and customers. Promoting this intelligence might mean sharing it within the company, which supports marketing decisions. So C is a marketing function.

D: Develop sales tactics. Hmm, sales tactics are more about the actual selling process, like how to approach customers or close deals. While sales and marketing are related, they're not the same. Marketing is more about attracting customers, and sales is about converting them. So D might not be a marketing function.

E: Develop pricing strategies. Pricing is a key part of marketing because it affects how products are perceived in the market. So E is definitely a marketing function.

F: Work with other business functions and third parties. Marketing often collaborates with other departments like sales, production, and even external agencies. This is part of integrating marketing efforts, so F is a marketing function.

G: Conduct market research. Market research is fundamental to marketing. It helps understand the market and customers, so G is definitely a marketing function.

H: Develop the customer proposition. The customer proposition is about what value a company offers to its customers, which is central to marketing. So H is a marketing function.

I: Oversee product development. Product development is more on the product management or R&D side. While marketing influences product development by providing insights, overseeing it is more about product lifecycle management, which is a different function. So I might not be a marketing function.

J: Manage customer relationships. Customer relationship management (CRM) is a key part of marketing, ensuring customer satisfaction and retention. So J is a marketing function.

Wait, so both D and I seem like they might not be marketing functions. Let me think again. Sales tactics are about the sales process, which is sales, not marketing. Product development is handled by product managers or R&D, not marketing. But in some cases, marketing does influence product development by providing feedback. However, overseeing product development is more of a product management role.

Looking back, the question is which is NOT a marketing function. So options D and I are candidates. But which one is more likely the correct answer?

I think the answer is D: Develop sales tactics. Because sales tactics are part of the sales function, not marketing. Marketing is about creating demand, while sales is about converting that demand into revenue. So D is not a marketing function. Alternatively, I could be wrong because sometimes marketing does support sales with strategies, but developing sales tactics is more sales-focused.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes marketing and sales are closely linked. Maybe I should double-check the definitions. Marketing functions typically include market research, product positioning, pricing, advertising, promotions, public relations, and customer relationship management. Sales functions include lead generation, sales tactics, negotiation, and closing deals.

So, Develop sales tactics (D) is a sales function, not marketing. Similarly, Oversee product development (I) is more product management. But according to the options, which one is considered not a marketing function.

I think both D and I could be correct, but the question is asking which one is NOT. So perhaps the answer is I: Oversee product development because product development is handled by product managers, not marketers.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The marketing function includes developing the customer proposition (H), which is about how the product is positioned. So product development is more about creating the product, while marketing is about how it's sold. Therefore, overseeing product development would be more of a product management role, not marketing.

So the answer is I: Oversee product development.

The correct answer is **I: Oversee product development**.

**Answer: I**
