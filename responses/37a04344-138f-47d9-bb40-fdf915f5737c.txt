Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the wavelength of a specific spectral line in the hydrogen spectrum. The question is about the first line in the visible Balmer series, which involves an electron transitioning from orbit 3 to orbit 2. Hmm, I remember that the Balmer series deals with transitions that end in the second energy level, so that makes sense.

Wait, the Balmer series is the one that's in the visible part of the spectrum, right? I think the first line is the one with the longest wavelength, so it's probably the H-alpha line or something like that. But wait, no, the first line is the transition from n=3 to n=2, I guess. Or maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me think. The Balmer series starts with higher energy levels transitioning down to n=2. So the first line would be the one where the transition is from n=3 to n=2.

I need to use the Rydberg formula for this. The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant, n₁ is the final energy level, and n₂ is the initial higher energy level. Wait, no, actually, I think it's 1/λ = R * (1/n_final² - 1/n_initial²), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check. Oh right, in the Rydberg formula, n_initial is the higher energy level, and n_final is the lower one. So in this case, the electron is moving from n=3 to n=2, so n_initial is 3, and n_final is 2.

So plugging into the formula: 1/λ = R * (1/2² - 1/3²). Let me compute that. 1/2 squared is 1/4, which is 0.25. 1/3 squared is 1/9, which is approximately 0.1111. Subtracting these gives 0.25 - 0.1111 = 0.1389. So 1/λ = R * 0.1389.

The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹. So 1.097e7 multiplied by 0.1389. Let me calculate that. 1.097e7 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.523e6 m⁻¹. So 1/λ ≈ 1.523e6, meaning λ ≈ 1 / 1.523e6 meters. Wait, that's in meters, but we need to convert that to angstroms because the options are in A or Å. Oh wait, actually, the options are in Å, so let me make sure. 1 meter is 1e10 angstroms, so let me compute λ in meters first.

λ ≈ 1 / 1.523e6 m ≈ 6.567e-7 meters. To convert to angstroms: 6.567e-7 m * 1e10 Å/m = 6.567e3 Å, which is 6567 Å. Looking at the options, option H is 6560A, and option J is 4861A. Hmm, 6560 is close to what I calculated. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the Balmer series starts with n=4 down to n=2, but the first line is the one from n=3. Or does the first line correspond to the longest wavelength, which is the transition from n=3? Let me think again. The Balmer series includes transitions ending at n=2, so the transitions are from n=3,4,5,... to n=2. The first line in the series is the one with the largest wavelength, which corresponds to the smallest energy difference. That would be the transition from n=3 to n=2 because it's the closest in energy, so the photon emitted has the longest wavelength. So yes, this should be the correct approach.

Another thing to check: sometimes the Rydberg constant is given with a different value, like 1.097e4 cm⁻¹, but I think I used the correct value in meters⁻¹. Let me confirm the calculation again. 1/(2²) is 0.25, 1/(3²) is 0.1111, so their difference is 0.1389. Multiply by R=1.097e7 m⁻¹: 0.1389 * 1.097e7 ≈ 1.523e6 m⁻¹. So λ ≈ 6.56e-7 m, which is 656 nm, or 6560 Å. So the answer should be H: 6560A.

The problem involves calculating the wavelength of the first line in the visible Balmer series of the hydrogen spectrum, corresponding to the electron transition from orbit 3 to orbit 2. The Rydberg formula is used: 

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{final}}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{\text{initial}}^2} \right)
\]

Here, \( n_{\text{final}} = 2 \) and \( n_{\text{initial}} = 3 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right) = R \left( 0.25 - 0.1111 \right) = R \times 0.1389
\]

The Rydberg constant \( R \) is approximately \( 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \times 0.1389 \approx 1.523 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

Solving for \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{1}{1.523 \times 10^6} \approx 6.567 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

Converting to angstroms (\( 1 \, \text{m} = 10^{10} \, \text{Å} \)):

\[
\lambda \approx 6.567 \times 10^{-7} \times 10^{10} \approx 6567 \, \text{Å}
\]

The closest option is \( 6560 \, \text{Å} \), corresponding to option H. This matches the expected wavelength for the transition from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 2 \), which is the first line in the visible Balmer series.
