Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out if the set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. The propositions given are:

1. (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)
2. T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)
3. (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W

And the options are from A to E, with some saying inconsistent and others giving specific consistent valuations. I'm a bit rusty on my logic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that an indirect truth table is used to check for consistency. The idea is that if there's no row in the truth table where all propositions are true, then the set is inconsistent. Otherwise, it's consistent, and we can find a valuation where all propositions are true.

So, the plan is to construct a truth table for all four variables: T, U, W, X. There are 16 possible combinations, but maybe I can find a way to narrow it down.

Alternatively, since each proposition is a conditional, maybe I can find a way to find a valuation that makes all three propositions true. Let's try to assign truth values step by step.

Let me start by considering each proposition and see what they imply about the variables.

Proposition 1: (T → U) → (W → U)

This is a bit complicated. Let me parse it. It's equivalent to ~ (T → U) ∨ (W → U), which is equivalent to (¬T ∨ U) ∨ (¬W ∨ U), which simplifies to ¬T ∨ U ∨ ¬W ∨ U, so ¬T ∨ ¬W ∨ U.

So, proposition 1 simplifies to ¬T ∨ ¬W ∨ U. So, if T is true, then either W is false or U is true. If T is false, then the implication holds regardless.

Proposition 2: T → ~ (U → X)

Again, let's break it down. U → X is equivalent to ¬U ∨ X. So, ~ (U → X) is ¬(¬U ∨ X), which is U ∧ ¬X. So proposition 2 becomes T → (U ∧ ¬X). Which is equivalent to ¬T ∨ (U ∧ ¬X).

Proposition 3: (T → ~X) → W

This is equivalent to ¬(T → ~X) ∨ W. T → ~X is ¬T ∨ ~X, so ¬(T → ~X) is T ∧ X. So proposition 3 becomes (T ∧ X) → W, which is equivalent to ¬(T ∧ X) ∨ W, which is ¬T ∨ ¬X ∨ W.

So now, the three propositions are:

1. ¬T ∨ ¬W ∨ U
2. ¬T ∨ (U ∧ ¬X)
3. ¬T ∨ ¬X ∨ W

Now, I need to find a truth assignment to T, U, W, X that makes all three propositions true. Let's see.

Perhaps I can try to find a valuation where all three are true. Let's consider possible cases based on the truth value of T.

Case 1: T is true.

If T is true, then let's look at each proposition.

Proposition 1: ¬T is false, so for the whole proposition to be true, ¬W ∨ U must be true. So either W is false or U is true.

Proposition 2: ¬T is false, so (U ∧ ¬X) must be true. So U must be true and X must be false.

Proposition 3: ¬T is false, so ¬X ∨ W must be true. Since X is false, ¬X is true, so proposition 3 is automatically true regardless of W.

So, under T being true, proposition 2 requires U to be true and X to be false. Proposition 1 requires that either W is false or U is true. Since U is true, proposition 1 is satisfied. Proposition 3 is satisfied because X is false, making ¬X true.

So let's see: T is true, X is false, U is true. What about W? From proposition 1, since U is true, it doesn't matter about W. From proposition 3, since X is false, ¬X is true, so W can be anything. So W can be true or false, but let's see if there's a restriction.

Wait, proposition 3 is (T ∧ X) → W. Since T is true and X is false, (T ∧ X) is false, so the implication is true regardless of W. So W can be either true or false.

So, in this case, when T is true, U is true, X is false, and W can be either true or false. Let's pick W as false to see if that works.

So, T = true, U = true, X = false, W = false.

Let me check each proposition:

1. (T → U) → (W → U). T → U is true (since both are true). W → U: W is false, U is true, so the implication is true. So the whole proposition is true → true, which is true.

2. T → ~(U → X). U → X: U is true, X is false → U → X is false. So ~ (U → X) is true. So T → true is true.

3. (T → ~X) → W. T is true, ~X is true (since X is false). So T → ~X is true. So the antecedent is true, so the implication is equivalent to true → W. So W must be true for this to hold. But in our assignment, W is false. So this would make proposition 3 false.

Ah, so W can't be false in this case. So in this scenario, W must be true. Because if W is false, proposition 3 fails.

So, let's try W = true. So T = true, U = true, X = false, W = true.

Check each proposition again:

1. (T → U) → (W → U). T → U is true, W → U is true (since W is true, U is true). So true → true is true.

2. T → ~(U → X). U → X is false, so ~ is true. So T → true is true.

3. (T → ~X) → W. T → ~X is true (as ~X is true). So true → W is true only if W is true. So it's true.

So this assignment works. So the set is consistent because there exists at least one valuation where all propositions are true. So the answer must be one of the options that says consistent.

Looking at the options:

C: Consistent. Consistent valuation when T, U, and X are true and W is false.

D: Consistent. Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false.

Wait, in my assignment, T is true, U is true, X is false, W is true. So that's not exactly option C or D. Let me see what the options are.

Option C: T, U, X are true, W is false. But in my case, X is false, so that's not matching.

Option D: U, W, X are true, T is false. But in my case, T is true, so that's not matching.

Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps there's another assignment.

Wait, maybe I should check another case where T is false.

Case 2: T is false.

If T is false, then let's see what each proposition requires.

Proposition 1: ¬T is true, so the entire proposition is true regardless of W and U.

Proposition 2: ¬T is true, so the entire proposition is true regardless of U and X.

Proposition 3: ¬T is true, so the entire proposition is true regardless of X and W.

So, when T is false, all propositions are automatically true, regardless of the other variables. So any assignment where T is false will satisfy all three propositions. So, for example, T = false, U can be anything, W can be anything, X can be anything.

So that's another consistent valuation. So the set is definitely consistent because there are valuations where all propositions are true.

So looking back at the options, which ones suggest a consistent valuation?

Option C: T, U, X are true, W is false. Let's check that.

T = true, U = true, X = true, W = false.

Check each proposition:

1. (T → U) → (W → U). T → U is true. W → U: W is false → U is true, so implication is true. So the whole proposition is true → true = true.

2. T → ~ (U → X). U → X is true (both U and X are true). So ~ (U → X) is false. So T → false is equivalent to false (since T is true). So proposition 2 is false. Thus, this assignment doesn't work.

So option C is incorrect because in this case, proposition 2 is false.

Option D: U, W, X are true, T is false.

So T = false, U = true, W = true, X = true.

Check each proposition:

1. (F → U) → (W → U). F → U is true (since antecedent is false). W → U: W is true, U is true → implication is true. So the whole proposition is true → true = true.

2. F → ~ (U → X). F → anything is true. So proposition 2 is true.

3. (F → ~X) → W. F → ~X is true. So the implication is true → W, which is true because W is true. So proposition 3 is true.

So this assignment works. So option D is a valid consistent valuation.

Another assignment is T = true, U = true, X = false, W = true. So that's another consistent valuation, but it's not listed in the options. The options only give specific valuations, so perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the options are:

C: T, U, X true; W false

D: U, W, X true; T false

E: Inconsistent

So since the set is consistent, E is out. So the correct answer is either C or D, but as I saw, C's valuation makes proposition 2 false, so it's invalid. D's valuation works.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option C.

Wait, let me recheck option C: T, U, X are true; W is false.

So T = true, U = true, X = true, W = false.

Proposition 1: (T → U) → (W → U). T → U is true. W → U: W is false → U is true, so W → U is true. So the entire proposition is true → true = true.

Proposition 2: T → ~ (U → X). U → X is true (both true). So ~ (U → X) is false. So T → false is false (since T is true). So proposition 2 is false.

So this assignment doesn't work, making option C invalid. So the only valid option among the choices is D, which gives a consistent valuation.

Wait, but earlier I found another assignment where T is true, U is true, X is false, W is true. Let me check that.

In that case:

Proposition 1: (T→U) is true, (W→U) is true (since W is true, U is true). So the whole is true.

Proposition 2: T → ~ (U→X). U→X: U is true, X is false → U→X is false. So ~ is true. So T→true is true.

Proposition 3: (T→~X) → W. T is true, ~X is true (since X is false). So T→~X is true. So the implication is true → W (which is true). So proposition 3 is true.

So this is another consistent valuation. So the set is consistent, and there are multiple valuations possible. But the options only give specific ones. The options for consistent are C, D, and E is inconsistent. But in the options, E is inconsistent, which we know is wrong because the set is consistent.

So the answer must be either C or D. But C's valuation doesn't work because proposition 2 is false. So D is the correct option.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Inconsistent, when all variables are false.

B: Inconsistent, when all variables are true.

C: Consistent, T, U, X true; W false.

D: Consistent, U, W, X true; T false.

E: Inconsistent.

So since the set is consistent, E is wrong. Now, among the others, D gives a correct valuation, so the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should construct the indirect truth table. The indirect method involves assuming the set is inconsistent and deriving a contradiction.

So, the set being inconsistent means that for all possible valuations, at least one proposition is false. So, to test for inconsistency, we assume that all propositions are true and see if that leads to a contradiction.

Wait, no, that's not right. Indirect truth table construction is a bit different. Let me recall.

The method involves assuming the negation of what we want and deriving a contradiction. So, to check consistency, we assume that all propositions are true and see if there's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach is to construct a truth table where all propositions are true and see if any row satisfies that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a truth table for all four variables and see if any row makes all three propositions true.

But with four variables, that's 16 rows. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps using logical equivalences to simplify the propositions.

Let me try to simplify the three propositions.

Proposition 1: (T → U) → (W → U) ≡ ¬(T → U) ∨ (W → U) ≡ (¬T ∨ U) ∨ (¬W ∨ U) ≡ ¬T ∨ U ∨ ¬W ∨ U ≡ ¬T ∨ ¬W ∨ U.

Proposition 2: T → ¬(U → X) ≡ T → (U ∧ ¬X).

Proposition 3: (T → ¬X) → W ≡ ¬(T → ¬X) ∨ W ≡ (T ∧ X) ∨ W.

So now, the three propositions are:

1. ¬T ∨ ¬W ∨ U
2. T → (U ∧ ¬X)  ≡ ¬T ∨ (U ∧ ¬X)
3. (T ∧ X) ∨ W

Now, let's see if I can find a truth assignment that satisfies all three.

Let me consider possible cases for T.

Case 1: T is true.

Then, from proposition 2: ¬T is false, so (U ∧ ¬X) must be true. So U is true and X is false.

From proposition 1: ¬T is false, so ¬W ∨ U must be true. Since U is true, this holds regardless of W.

From proposition 3: (T ∧ X) is (T is true and X is false) → (T ∧ X) is false. So the entire proposition is (false) ∨ W, which is equivalent to W. So proposition 3 requires W to be true.

So in this case, T is true, U is true, X is false, W must be true.

Let me check each proposition:

1. ¬T ∨ ¬W ∨ U: F ∨ F ∨ T → T.

2. T → (U ∧ ¬X): T → (T ∧ T) → T → T → T.

3. (T ∧ X) ∨ W: (T ∧ F) ∨ T → F ∨ T → T.

So this assignment works.

Case 2: T is false.

Then, proposition 1: ¬T is true → the entire proposition is true regardless.

Proposition 2: ¬T is true → the entire proposition is true regardless.

Proposition 3: (F ∧ X) ∨ W → F ∨ W → W. So W must be true.

Wait, no: (F ∧ X) is F, so F ∨ W is equivalent to W. So for proposition 3 to be true, W must be true.

So when T is false, W must be true, but U and X can be anything else.

So, for example, T=F, U=T, X=F, W=T.

Let me check:

1. ¬F ∨ ¬T ∨ T → T ∨ F ∨ T → T.

2. F → (T ∧ F) → F → anything → T.

3. (F ∧ F) ∨ T → F ∨ T → T.

So this works.

Alternatively, T=F, U=F, X=T, W=T.

1. ¬F ∨ ¬T ∨ F → T ∨ F ∨ F → T.

2. F → (F ∧ F) → F → T.

3. (F ∧ T) ∨ T → F ∨ T → T.

So this also works.

So, in this case, when T is false, as long as W is true, the other variables can be anything.

So the set is consistent because there are valuations where all propositions are true.

Looking back at the options, option D says: Consistent. Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false.

So in this case, U=T, W=T, X=T, T=F.

Let me check:

1. ¬F ∨ ¬T ∨ T → T ∨ F ∨ T → T.

2. F → (T ∧ F) → F → T.

3. (F ∧ T) ∨ T → F ∨ T → T.

Yes, that works. So option D is correct.

Option C's valuation is T, U, X=T; W=F. Let's check:

1. ¬T is F, so ¬W ∨ U must be T. W=F → ¬W=T. So T ∨ T → T.

2. T → (U ∧ ¬X): T → (T ∧ F) → T → F → F.

So proposition 2 is false. Hence, option C is invalid.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The set of propositions is consistent because there exists at least one truth assignment where all propositions are true. Specifically, when T is false, U, W, and X are true, the propositions hold. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: Consistent. Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false.

Answer: D
