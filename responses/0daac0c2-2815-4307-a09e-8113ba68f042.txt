Okay, so I've got this question about identifying the antecedent in a conditional proposition. I'm a bit rusty on my logic terms, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The proposition given is: "The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." Hmm, I remember that "if and only if" is a biconditional statement, meaning both conditions imply each other. So it's like saying A if and only if B, which translates to A ↔ B. That means A happens exactly when B happens.

Wait, but the question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition. Antecedent usually refers to the 'if' part in an 'if-then' statement. But here, it's an 'if and only if' which is a bit different. So the structure is: University raises tuition ↔ (Governor approves AND Board recommends).

I think in a biconditional, both parts are considered as antecedent and consequent in a way. But the way the question is phrased, it's about the antecedent of the conditional proposition. So perhaps the entire proposition is structured as P if and only if Q, where Q is the conjunction of two conditions.

But wait, the antecedent in a conditional is the 'if' part. So in a standard conditional like P → Q, P is the antecedent. But here, it's a biconditional, so it's P ↔ (Q ∧ R), where P is the university raises tuition, Q is the governor approves, and R is the board recommends.

But the question is phrased as a single conditional proposition. So the entire statement is that the university raises tuition (P) is equivalent to both Q and R happening. So the antecedent would be the part after 'if'—which is the part that triggers the consequent.

Wait, but the structure is P if and only if (Q and R). So the 'if' part here is (Q and R), and the 'then' part is P. Because it's a biconditional, both P implies (Q and R) and (Q and R) imply P are true.

So in the conditional sense, the antecedent is the part that, if it happens, causes the consequent. So in this case, the antecedent would be (Q and R)—both the governor approves and the board recommends. But looking at the options, the options are A through J, but the options given are:

A: The university raises tuition.
B: The governor approves of it.
C: The board of trustees recommends it.
D: None of the above.

Wait, none of the options directly say both B and C. The options are individual conditions, not their conjunction. So the antecedent is the conjunction of B and C, but that's not an option here. So the question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition, which in this case is the entire condition (Q ∧ R). Since that's not an option, the correct answer would be D: None of the above.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The proposition is P if and only if (Q ∧ R). So in terms of a conditional, it's P ↔ (Q ∧ R). So the antecedent in a conditional is the part after 'if', which is (Q ∧ R). But since the options don't include that, the answer is D.

The antecedent of the conditional proposition is the conjunction of two conditions: the governor approves and the board of trustees recommends it. Since this conjunction is not listed as an option, the correct answer is D.

Answer: D
