Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the molecular weight of a gas under certain conditions. Hmm, I remember that the ideal gas law might come into play here. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the gas has a density of 2.50 g per liter at 98°C and 0.974 atm. I need to find the molecular weight, which is the molar mass of the gas.

Wait, density is given as grams per liter. I think density (d) relates to molar mass (M) through the ideal gas equation. Oh right, the formula is d = (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

First, I should convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. So, 98°C plus 273.15 equals 371.15 K. Let me double-check that: 98 + 273 is 371, so yeah, 371.15 K is correct.

Next, I know the pressure is 0.974 atm. The gas constant R is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? So I can plug all these values into the equation.

Rearranging the formula to solve for M: M = (dRT)/P.

Plugging in the numbers:
d = 2.50 g/L
R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T = 371.15 K
P = 0.974 atm.

So M = (2.50 * 0.0821 * 371.15) / 0.974.

Let me calculate the numerator first: 2.50 * 0.0821 is about 0.20525. Then multiply that by 371.15. Hmm, 0.20525 * 371.15... Let me compute that. 0.2 * 370 is 74, but more accurately, 0.20525 * 371.15 ≈ 76.06 g/mol? Wait, wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 2.50 * 0.0821 = 0.20525. Then 0.20525 * 371.15. Let me compute this step by step.

0.20525 * 300 = 61.575
0.20525 * 71.15 = let's see, 0.20525 * 70 = 14.3675, and 0.20525 *1.15 ≈ 0.236. So total is about 14.3675 + 0.236 ≈ 14.6035. Adding to 61.575 gives 76.1785.

So numerator ≈76.1785. Now divide by P, which is 0.974 atm.

So M ≈76.1785 / 0.974 ≈78.15 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option H is 78.1 g, which matches closely. Let me see if I did any miscalculations. Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the multiplication.

Let me recalculate 0.20525 * 371.15 more accurately. Let's break it down:

0.20525 * 300 = 61.575
0.20525 * 70 = 14.3675
0.20525 * 1.15 = let's compute 0.20525 *1 = 0.20525, 0.20525 *0.15 = 0.0307875. So total is 0.20525 + 0.0307875 = 0.2360375.

Adding them all together: 61.575 +14.3675 =75.9425; plus 0.2360375 gives 76.1785375.

Divide that by 0.974: 76.1785 / 0.974 ≈ Let's calculate 76.1785 ÷ 0.974.

Hmm, 0.974 * 78 = let's see: 78 * 0.974. 78 * 0.97 is 75.66, and 78 *0.004=0.312, so total 75.972. That's higher than 76.1785. So 78 *0.974 ≈75.972, which is less than 76.1785.

The difference is 76.1785 -75.972 = 0.2065. So how much more than 78? Let me see: 0.2065 /0.974 ≈0.212. So approximately 78.212. So M≈78.2 g/mol.

Looking at the options, H is 78.1 g, which is very close. So the answer should be H.

To determine the molecular weight (molar mass) of the gas, we use the relationship between density, pressure, temperature, and molar mass derived from the ideal gas law:

\[
d = \frac{PM}{RT} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M = \frac{dRT}{P}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperature to Kelvin
\[
T = 98^\circ\text{C} + 273.15 = 371.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Plug values into the formula
\[
M = \frac{(2.50 \, \text{g/L}) \cdot (0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}) \cdot (371.15 \, \text{K})}{0.974 \, \text{atm}}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the numerator
\[
2.50 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.20525
\]
\[
0.20525 \cdot 371.15 \approx 76.1785
\]

### Step 4: Divide by pressure
\[
M = \frac{76.1785}{0.974} \approx 78.15 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 78.15 \, \text{g/mol} \) is **H: 78.1 g**.
