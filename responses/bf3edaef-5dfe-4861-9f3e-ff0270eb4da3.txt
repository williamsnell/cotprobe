Okay, so I have this question about present value, and I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is again.

The question is asking: What is the present value of $10 received in two years' time if the discount rate is 9%? The options are from A to J, with various numbers listed.

Hmm, present value. I remember that present value is like figuring out how much money you need today to have a certain amount in the future, considering the interest rate or discount rate. So, it's the opposite of future value. Instead of growing money, we're discounting it back.

The formula for present value when you have a single future amount is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods. So in this case, FV is $10, r is 9% or 0.09, and n is 2 years.

Let me plug the numbers in. So PV = 10 / (1 + 0.09)^2. Let's calculate the denominator first. 1 + 0.09 is 1.09. Then, raising that to the power of 2.

Calculating 1.09 squared. I think 1.09 times 1.09. Let me do that step by step. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.09 is 0.09, 0.09 times 1 is 0.09, and 0.09 times 0.09 is 0.0081. Adding those up: 1 + 0.09 + 0.09 + 0.0081. That's 1 + 0.18 + 0.0081, which totals 1.1881.

So now the denominator is 1.1881. So PV is 10 divided by 1.1881. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 1.1881.

Hmm, I might need to approximate this division. Let's see, 1.1881 times 8 is 9.5048, because 1.1881 * 8 = (1 *8) + (0.1881*8) = 8 + 1.5048 = 9.5048. That's less than 10. What's 1.1881 * 8.4? Let's see, 8 *1.1881 is 9.5048, plus 0.4 *1.1881 is 0.47524. So 9.5048 + 0.47524 = 9.98004, which is almost 10. So 8.4 times 1.1881 is approximately 9.98, which is very close to 10. So 10 / 1.1881 is approximately 8.417, which I can round to about 8.42.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that division. Because 8.42 times 1.1881 should be around 10. Let me check 8.42 * 1.1881.

Calculating 8 * 1.1881 is 9.5048. Then 0.42 * 1.1881. Let's compute 0.4 *1.1881 = 0.47524, and 0.02 *1.1881= 0.023762. Adding those together: 0.47524 + 0.023762 = 0.499002. So total is 9.5048 + 0.499002 = 10.0038, which is just over 10. So 8.42 times 1.1881 is about 10.0038, which is a bit over. So maybe the exact value is a little less than 8.42. But for practical purposes, 8.42 is close enough, considering we're dealing with money and the options given.

Looking back at the options, option B is $8.42, and option C is $8.26. Wait, but wait, maybe I should use a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1.09 squared more accurately. Let's do that. 1.09 times 1.09.

1.09 * 1.09: 

1.09
times 1.09
----------
Multiply 1.09 by 9 (the hundredths place): 9 *1.09 = 9.81, but since it's the hundredths, it's 0.9810.
Then multiply 1.09 by 1 (the units place): 1.09, shifted one position: 10.9000.
Adding 0.9810 + 10.9000 = 11.8810. So 1.09^2 is 1.1881, which is correct.

So PV is 10 / 1.1881. Let me compute this division more accurately.

I can write 10 ÷ 1.1881.

Let me think: 1.1881 * 8 = 9.5048. 10 - 9.5048 = 0.4952. So I have 8 with a remainder of 0.4952.

Now, 0.4952 divided by 1.1881. Let me see how much that is. 0.4952 / 1.1881 ≈ 0.4167. Because 1.1881 * 0.4167 ≈ 0.4952.

So 8 + 0.4167 = 8.4167, which is approximately 8.42. So yes, the present value is about $8.42, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option B is $8.42, and option C is $8.26. Hmm, that's a difference. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, another way to compute PV is using the formula PV = FV × (1 + r)^-n. So 10 × (1.09)^-2. Alternatively, I can use the present value factor.

Looking up the present value factor for 9% over 2 years: (1.09)^-2 = 1 / (1.1881) ≈ 0.8417. So 10 × 0.8417 = 8.417, which rounds to 8.42. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use a calculator to get a more precise value. Let me compute 10 / 1.1881 exactly.

Let me compute 1.1881 × 8.42:

8.42 × 1.1881.

Compute 8 × 1.1881 = 9.5048.

0.42 × 1.1881: Let's break it down.

0.4 × 1.1881 = 0.47524.

0.02 × 1.1881 = 0.023762.

Adding 0.47524 + 0.023762 = 0.499002.

So total is 9.5048 + 0.499002 = 10.003802, which is about $10.0038, which is just a bit over $10. So 8.42 gives us about 10.0038, which is very close. So the present value is approximately $8.42, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with more decimal places. Let me calculate 10 / 1.1881.

Using a calculator approach:

1.1881 × 8 = 9.5048.

Subtract that from 10: 10 - 9.5048 = 0.4952.

Now, 0.4952 / 1.1881 ≈ 0.4167.

So total is 8.4167, which is about 8.4167, which rounds to 8.42. So yes, the correct present value is approximately $8.42, so the answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 8.26, which is lower. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.09)^2 more accurately. Let me use a calculator for that.

1.09 × 1.09.

Calculating step by step:

1.09 × 1.09:

= (1 + 0.09) × (1 + 0.09)
= 1×1 + 1×0.09 + 0.09×1 + 0.09×0.09
= 1 + 0.09 + 0.09 + 0.0081
= 1.1881.

Yes, that's correct.

So 10 / 1.1881 = 8.4167, which is approximately 8.42.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: $8.42.

The present value of $10 received in two years at a 9% discount rate is calculated using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Plugging in the values, PV = 10 / (1.09)^2 ≈ 8.42.
