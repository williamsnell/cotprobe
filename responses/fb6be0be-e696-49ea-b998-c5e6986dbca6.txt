Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where the maximum electric stress occurs on a long wire that's a smooth, round conductor running above and parallel to the ground, which is assumed to be a large conducting plane. There's a high voltage between the conductor and the ground. Hmm, electric stress... I think that's related to the electric field strength or maybe the stress on the conductor's surface.

Let me start by recalling what I know about electric fields and conductors. I remember that in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero because charges rearrange themselves to cancel any internal fields. But wait, this isn't a static situation exactly because the wire is above the ground, which is also a conductor. So maybe it's more about how the electric field behaves around conductors in such a setup.

The wire is smooth and round, so its shape should affect the distribution of charges. Since it's a conductor, the charges would reside on the surface. But how does the proximity to the ground affect this? The ground is a conducting plane, so it's like a big sheet of conductor. When the wire has a high voltage relative to the ground, charges will be induced on both the wire and the ground.

I think the electric field is strongest where the field lines are most concentrated. For a single isolated conductor, the electric field is strongest perpendicular to the surface at points where the curvature is highest, like the ends of a cylinder. But here, the wire is near another conductor, the ground. So maybe the field lines are influenced by both the wire and the ground.

Wait, when you have two conductors with charges, the electric field between them is influenced by the charges on both. The ground, being a conducting plane, will have induced charges opposite to those on the wire. The wire is positively charged, the ground negative, or vice versa. But regardless, the field lines would go from the wire to the ground.

Now, considering the shape of the field lines, they tend to be perpendicular to the surfaces of conductors. So near the wire, the field lines should be perpendicular to the wire's surface. But because the wire is above the ground, the field lines would also be influenced by the ground's surface. The ground is a plane, so the field near it should be perpendicular to it.

But the question is about the maximum electric stress, which I think refers to the maximum electric field strength. Where would the field be strongest? Let me think about a similar situation. I recall that near sharp points or where the geometry causes the field lines to be most concentrated, the electric field is strongest.

In this case, the wire is above the ground. The electric field between them would be stronger where the distance between the conductor and the ground is smallest. But wait, the wire is a cylinder, so the distance from the wire to the ground is roughly the same all along its length, except maybe at the ends. But the wire is long, so end effects might be minimal.

Wait, but the wire is a smooth cylinder. So the electric field around it would be similar to the field around a charged cylinder. For a charged cylinder, the electric field outside is strongest perpendicular to the surface, so along the axis. But when it's near another conductor, the field might be different.

Alternatively, think about the concept of stress in the dielectric around the conductor. The electric stress is the force per unit area experienced by the dielectric material. The maximum stress occurs where the electric field is strongest.

In the case of a conductor above a ground plane, the electric field is influenced by both. The field lines start from the wire, go towards the ground, and because the ground is a conductor, the field just above the ground is strong. But wait, the field just inside the conductor is zero, so the maximum field should be just outside the conductor's surface.

Wait, but for the wire, the maximum electric field would be at the surface where the curvature is highest. But the wire is a cylinder, so its curvature is uniform along its length, except perhaps at the ends. But the ends are not the point in question here because the question is about the conductor farthest from the ground.

Wait, the wire is above the ground, so the closest point on the wire to the ground is the point directly above the ground, but the wire is parallel, so each point is the same distance away. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum electric stress occurs at the point where the conductor is closest to the ground. But since the wire is parallel, every point on the wire is equidistant from the ground. Wait, but the ground is a plane, so the distance from the wire to the ground is uniform. So the electric field strength would be uniform around the wire? Or not?

Wait, no, because the wire is a conductor, the charges will redistribute. In a uniform electric field, the charges on a conductor will arrange to make the internal field zero. But when the wire is near a conducting plane, the charges on the wire and the induced charges on the ground will create an electric field that's stronger near the ground.

Wait, maybe the electric field is strongest at the lower surface of the wire. Because the wire is above the ground, the lower surface is closer to the ground, so the field lines would be more concentrated there. Alternatively, the field might be strongest at the lower surface because that's where the proximity to the ground's induced charges is greatest.

Wait, but the electric field due to a charged conductor is stronger the closer you are to it. So if the wire has a positive charge, the field near the lower surface (closer to the ground) would be stronger because the ground's negative charge is just below it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the image method. The image of a charge above a conducting plane would be a charge of opposite sign mirrored below the plane. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, another approach: the electric field just outside a conductor's surface is given by E = σ/ε₀, where σ is the surface charge density. So the maximum electric stress would be where σ is maximum. So where is σ the highest on the wire?

In a conductor with a high voltage, charges tend to accumulate where the curvature is highest. For a cylinder, the curvature is uniform along the length, but at the ends, the curvature is higher. But the wire is long, so maybe end effects are minimal. Alternatively, if the wire is a smooth cylinder, the charge distribution is uniform, so σ is the same everywhere on the surface. But wait, that can't be right because a long cylinder in electrostatic equilibrium would have uniform charge distribution along its length.

Wait, but when it's above a conducting plane, maybe the charge distribution isn't uniform. The induced charges on the ground would cause the field lines to be more perpendicular near the ground. So perhaps the electric field is stronger at the lower surface of the conductor.

Wait, but if the conductor is a cylinder, the field outside is strongest where the curvature is highest. For a cylinder, the field lines are radial, so the field strength would be the same at all points equidistant from the axis. But when near another conductor, like the ground, the field lines would be influenced. Maybe the field is stronger near the lower surface because the ground's presence causes the field lines to bend more there, increasing the field strength.

Alternatively, think of a point charge above a conducting plane. The field is strongest near the point charge. But in this case, the wire is a cylinder. So perhaps the maximum field is along the axis, at the surface of the wire. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the concept of stress in the insulating material around the conductor. The stress is the force per unit area. The maximum stress occurs where the electric field is strongest. So where is the E-field strongest?

In the region between the wire and the ground, the E-field is strongest where the distance between the wire and ground is smallest, but since the wire is parallel, the distance is uniform. Wait, but the wire is a conductor, so the field inside is zero, but just outside, the field is highest where the charge density is highest.

Wait, but if the wire is a perfect conductor, the charge density on the surface would be uniform, leading to a uniform E-field just outside. But in reality, maybe the proximity to the ground affects this. The ground being a conductor would cause the field lines to be more perpendicular near it, making the E-field stronger there.

So if the wire is above the ground, the lower surface is closer to the ground, and the induced charges on the ground would cause the E-field just outside the wire's lower surface to be stronger than elsewhere on the wire. Therefore, the maximum electric stress would be on the lower surface of the conductor.

Looking back at the options, option B is the lower surface of the conductor. So the answer should be B.

The maximum electric stress occurs where the electric field is strongest. In this scenario, the wire is a smooth, round conductor above a conducting ground plane, and the electric field is influenced by the charges on the wire and the induced charges on the ground. The electric field just outside a conductor's surface is proportional to the surface charge density, and in this case, the field is strongest near the lower surface of the wire due to its proximity to the ground. This proximity causes the field lines to be more concentrated, leading to the maximum electric stress at the lower surface.

Answer: B
