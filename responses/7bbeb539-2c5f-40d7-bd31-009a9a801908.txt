Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of adults aged 18 and older who were overweight as of 2016. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I remember hearing some statistics about this before.

I think the question is talking about adults in the United States, but I'm not 100% sure. Anyway, I'll assume it's about the US unless specified otherwise. From what I've heard, the obesity rate in the US has been increasing over the years. I remember a few years ago, around 2010, the obesity rate was around 30-35%, but that's just for obesity, not including those who are merely overweight.

Wait, the question is about being overweight, which includes both obesity and being overweight but not obese. So, the percentage should be higher than just obesity rates. I think the term "overweight" in this context refers to a BMI of 25 or higher, while obesity is 30 or higher. So, the combined percentage would be higher than just obesity.

I recall that in 2016, the obesity rate in the US was around 39.8% for adults. But that's just obesity. Adding the overweight category, which includes those with a BMI of 25-29.9, would bring the total to a higher percentage. I think the combined figure for overweight and obesity was around 70%. But wait, let me think again. I might be mixing up some numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the percentage of adults who are overweight or obese. If the obesity rate was about 40%, and the overweight rate (but not obese) was maybe another 30%, that would make 70% overall. But I'm not certain. I've also heard that globally, the rate is lower, but again, I'm not sure if this question is about the US or the world.

Wait, another angle: in the US, as of recent years, the combined rate for overweight and obesity is often cited as around 70%. So, looking back at the options, option E is 70%, which would make sense. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to "overweight" as including obesity, but sometimes they differentiate between the two. The question here says "overweight," so maybe it's only including those with a BMI of 25 and above, which includes both overweight and obese categories. So, if that's the case, then the percentage would be higher than just obesity.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "overweight" as just being in the overweight category, not including obesity. But that seems less likely. Usually, when people talk about being overweight, they include obesity as part of that term.

Wait, let me think about the numbers again. In 2016, the CDC reported that approximately 39.8% of adults were obese. The overweight category (not including obesity) was around 33.5%. So adding those together, 39.8 + 33.5 is about 73.3%. That's close to 70%, but the options don't have 73%. So the closest option is E:70%.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking just about obesity, not the combined overweight and obesity. But the wording says "overweight," which I think includes both categories.

Wait, no, actually, in some contexts, "overweight" refers to a BMI between 25 and 30, and "obese" is above 30. So maybe the question is only asking about those who are overweight (25-30), not including the obese. In that case, the percentage would be around 33-34%, which isn't one of the options. The options include 30% (F), which is close. But I'm not sure if the question is distinguishing between the two.

Alternatively, if the question is asking about the percentage of adults who are either overweight or obese, that combined figure is about 70%, which is option E.

I think I need to go with that. So the answer is E:70%.

The answer is E:70%.
