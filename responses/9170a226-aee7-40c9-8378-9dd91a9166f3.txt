Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about why there's been a relative shift from farming. The question is asking for some reasons, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what a "relative shift from farming" means. I think it refers to people moving away from farming as their primary occupation. So, what factors could cause this shift?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The invention of automated systems that have made traditional farming obsolete. Hmm, automation does play a role, but I'm not sure if it's the main reason people are leaving farming. Maybe it affects efficiency but doesn't directly cause people to shift away from it.

Option B: Emergence of widespread diseases that make farming untenable. Diseases can affect crops, but I'm not sure if that's a main reason people stop farming. It might lead to specific instances of crop failure, but not a general shift.

Option C: Shift in consumer preferences towards synthetic foods. This could be a factor, especially with the rise of processed foods. But I'm not sure if this is the main reason people are leaving farming.

Option D: A global decrease in the demand for agricultural products. If demand decreases, maybe farmers would have less incentive to stay, but I think demand is generally high, especially with a growing population. So this might not be the main reason.

Option E: People seek the higher incomes of the city, shorter hours, and better social life in town. This sounds plausible. Many people move to cities for better jobs and lifestyle, which could lead them away from farming. I've heard this is a common reason in developing countries as urbanization increases.

Option F: Government policies against farming. If governments impose restrictions, that could affect farming. But unless policies are explicitly against it, it's more likely they support it through subsidies or other means. I'm not sure this is a primary cause.

Option G: The depletion of essential non-renewable farming resources. This is a possibility, like soil degradation or water scarcity. If farming resources are depleted, it could make farming harder, leading people to leave. But is this the main cause of a shift, or more of a contributing factor alongside other issues?

So, considering all options, E seems the most likely. People moving to cities for better opportunities is a well-known trend. Automation and other technologies might make farming more efficient, but the main shift is due to people seeking better lives elsewhere.

The relative shift from farming can be attributed to various factors, but the most significant one is people seeking better opportunities in cities. This includes higher incomes, shorter working hours, and improved social lives, which are key reasons for the urban migration trend. 

Answer: E
