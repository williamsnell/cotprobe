Okay, so I've got this question about angular magnification when looking through a pane of glass. Hmm, let me think. I remember that angular magnification relates to how things appear larger or smaller when viewed from a distance. But wait, the question is about a pane of glass. Oh right, I think it's about the effect of looking through a thin transparent medium, like glass, and how it affects the apparent size of an object.

The object is at 33 cm, and the glass is 5 mm thick. So the setup is that the viewer is looking at something 33 cm away, but the glass itself is 5 mm thick. I guess the glass acts like a medium that might cause some kind of displacement in the image, which affects magnification.

I recall that when you look through a thin layer, the image appears to be displaced. The displacement depends on the thickness of the medium and the angle at which you're viewing it. Wait, but how does that translate to angular magnification?

Angular magnification is usually calculated using the formula M = (25 cm) / (f), where f is the focal length of the lens. But wait, this isn't a lens; it's a pane of glass. Maybe it's a different approach. Oh, perhaps it's about the apparent shift in the position of the object when viewed through the glass, which causes a change in the angle, hence magnification.

I think the formula for the angular magnification when looking through a transparent medium is M = 1 + (t * 2) / (d * n), where t is the thickness of the glass, d is the distance to the object, and n is the refractive index of the glass. Wait, or was it something else? Maybe I'm mixing up formulas.

Another thought: when you look through a thin film, the light bends at the two surfaces, causing a shift in the image. The shift is given by (t * (n-1)) / sin(theta), where theta is the angle of incidence. But since the object is at a distance, maybe we can approximate theta as small, so sin(theta) is approximately equal to tan(theta), which is roughly the same as theta in radians.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the change in apparent position. The glass causes the light to bend, making the object seem displaced. The displacement s is given by s = t * (n-1) * (1 + cos(theta)), where theta is the angle of the light inside the glass. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that when looking through a medium, the angular magnification can be calculated using the formula M = (1 + (2t)/(d)) / (n - 1), but I'm not certain about the exact formula. Let me try to reconstruct it.

The glass has a thickness t = 5 mm = 0.5 cm. The distance d = 33 cm. The refractive index n for glass is typically around 1.5, but sometimes 1.6 or 1.65. Let's assume n = 1.5 for this calculation.

Wait, another approach: the angular displacement caused by the glass would lead to a magnification. The formula I think is M = (1 + (2t)/(d)) / (n - 1). Let's plug in the numbers.

t = 0.5 cm, d = 33 cm. So 2t/d = (2 * 0.5)/33 = 1/33 ≈ 0.0303. Then n-1 is 0.5. So M = (1 + 0.0303) / 0.5 ≈ 1.0303 / 0.5 ≈ 2.0606. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't go that high. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M = (2t)/(d*(n-1)), which would be (2*0.5)/(33*(0.5)) = 1/(33*0.5) = 1/16.5 ≈ 0.0606, which is about 6%. But that's not an option either. The options are all under 5%, mostly single digits.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. If the glass causes the image to shift, the angular magnification is the ratio of the shift to the distance. The shift s is given by t*(n-1), but considering the angle, maybe s ≈ t*(n-1) * (1 + cos(theta)), where theta is the angle of the object's light as it enters the glass.

But for small angles, cos(theta) ≈ 1, so s ≈ t*(n-1)*2. Wait, no, perhaps s is t*(n-1). Let me clarify.

Wait, when light passes through a medium of thickness t with refractive index n, the optical path length is n*t. The real physical path is t, so the extra path is t*(n-1). But how does that translate to angular displacement?

Alternatively, the shift in the image (s) is given by s = t * (n-1) / sin(theta). But for small theta, sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ theta. The object is at 33 cm, so the angle theta from the normal is small. Theta can be approximated as theta ≈ (t) / (d), since tan(theta) ≈ opposite/adjacent = t/d. So theta ≈ 0.5 cm / 33 cm = 0.01515 radians.

So s ≈ t*(n-1) / theta. Plugging in the numbers: t=0.5 cm, n=1.5, theta≈0.01515.

s ≈ 0.5 * 0.5 / 0.01515 ≈ 0.25 / 0.01515 ≈ 16.5 cm. Wait, that's a huge shift. But that can't be right because the options are small percentages. Maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the shift in terms of angular displacement is delta_theta = (t*(n-1)) / d. So delta_theta = (0.5 cm * 0.5) / 33 cm = (0.25) /33 ≈ 0.00758 radians. To convert that to a percentage, we can take (delta_theta *100)% ≈ 0.758%. Looking at the options, option A is 0.7%, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe the formula is delta_theta = (2*t*(n-1)) / d. Then delta_theta = (2 * 0.5 * 0.5)/33 = (0.5)/33 ≈ 0.01515 radians. 0.01515 radians is about 0.87% (since 0.01515 * 100 ≈ 1.515%, which is around option J: 0.5%? Wait, no, 1.5% is option D, but that's not matching.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The angular magnification M is given by the ratio of the apparent size to the actual size. When looking through glass, the image shifts, causing a slight magnification.

The formula I think is M = 1 + (2t)/ (d*(n-1)) ). Hmm, let's plug in the numbers: t=0.5 cm, d=33 cm, n=1.5.

So M = 1 + (2*0.5) / (33*(0.5)) ) = 1 + (1) / (16.5) ≈ 1 + 0.0606 ≈ 1.0606. So the magnification is about 6%, which isn't matching any options given. Wait, the options don't have 6%.

Alternatively, maybe it's M = (t*(n-1))/(d), which would be (0.5*0.5)/33 = 0.25/33 ≈ 0.00758, which is 0.758%—so about 0.7%, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Another way: the shift in the image's position is s = t*(n-1). The angle is then s/d, so theta = s/d = (0.5 * 0.5)/33 = 0.25/33 ≈ 0.00758 radians. To get the percentage, multiply by 100: 0.758%, which rounds to 0.7% (option A).

Wait, but some sources say the angular magnification is given by M = (n-1)*t/d. So M= (1.5-1)*0.5/33 = 0.5*0.5/33 = 0.25/33 ≈ 0.00758, which is 0.758%, so 0.7% (option A). That seems to fit.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.7%, which would be the correct answer.

The question involves calculating the angular magnification when viewing an object 33 cm away through a 5 mm thick pane of glass. The refractive index of glass is assumed to be 1.5. Angular magnification arises due to the displacement of the object's image caused by the glass. The formula used is:

\[
M = \frac{(n-1) \cdot t}{d}
\]

Where:
- \( n = 1.5 \) (refractive index of glass),
- \( t = 0.5 \, \text{cm} \) (thickness of glass),
- \( d = 33 \, \text{cm} \) (distance to the object).

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{(1.5-1) \cdot 0.5}{33} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{33} = \frac{0.25}{33} \approx 0.00758
\]

This corresponds to an angular magnification of approximately \( 0.758\% \), which rounds to \( 0.7\% \). Among the given options, the closest match is **A: 0.7%**.
