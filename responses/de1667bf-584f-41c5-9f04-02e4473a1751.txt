Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that John's MPC (which I remember stands for Marginal Propensity to Consume) is constant at 3/4. His break-even point occurs at $7,000, and the question is asking how much John will have to borrow when his income is $3,000. The options are from A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, first, I need to recall what MPC means. I think MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes. So if someone's MPC is 3/4, that means for every extra dollar they earn, they spend 75 cents of it. So MPC = 3/4.

Next, the break-even point is mentioned as $7,000. I remember that the break-even point is the level of income where a person's total spending equals their total income, meaning their saving is zero. At this point, they don't need to borrow or save because they're exactly covering their expenses with their income.

So, the break-even point formula is often written as:

Break-even point (BE) = (1 - MPC) * Income

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The break-even point is where planned expenditure equals income. But maybe another way to look at it is through the consumption function.

The consumption function is usually C = C0 + MPC * Y, where C0 is autonomous consumption (the amount people consume even if they earn nothing), and Y is income.

At the break-even point, consumption equals income, so:

Y = C0 + MPC * Y

Let me solve for C0. Rearranging:

C0 = Y - MPC * Y
C0 = Y * (1 - MPC)

So, C0 = BE * (1 - MPC), because at BE, Y=BE. Wait, but wait, the BE is the income where C=BE. So actually, BE = C0 / (1 - MPC). Because from the equation above, C0 = BE * (1 - MPC), so BE = C0 / (1 - MPC). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to write this down.

So, with MPC = 3/4, which is 0.75, (1 - MPC) is 0.25.

At break-even point, BE = $7,000.

So using the break-even formula, BE = C0 / (1 - MPC). So, C0 = BE * (1 - MPC) = 7000 * 0.25 = 1750.

So C0 is $1,750.

Now, when John's income is $3,000, we need to find out his consumption and then see how much he needs to borrow. Because if his income is less than his consumption, he has to borrow the difference.

Wait, but let me think. Consumption is C = C0 + MPC * Y. So when Y is $3,000, C = 1750 + 0.75 * 3000.

Calculating that: 0.75 * 3000 = 2250. So C = 1750 + 2250 = $4,000.

So his income is $3,000, and his consumption is $4,000. That means he needs to borrow the difference between consumption and income. So 4000 - 3000 = $1,000.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because sometimes, the break-even point is calculated differently. Another approach is that the break-even point is where planned savings equal zero. Savings would be Y - C. So if Y = C, then savings are zero.

Alternatively, the break-even point can also be thought of as the point where taxes and other non-discretionary spending are met, but I think in this case, it's simpler.

Wait, let's cross-verify. If C0 is $1,750, and MPC is 0.75, then C = 1750 + 0.75Y.

At BE, Y=7000, so C = 1750 + 0.75*7000 = 1750 + 5250 = 7000, which matches, so that's correct.

Now, when Y=3000, C=1750 + 0.75*3000 = 1750 + 2250 = 4000.

So John's income is $3,000, but he's spending $4,000. Therefore, he needs to borrow $1,000 because he can't cover his spending from his income alone.

Wait, but I'm seeing that one of the options is F: $1,000, so that's probably the answer. But let me double-check.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the break-even income is the point where he doesn't need to borrow or save. So with lower income, he has to make up the difference by borrowing.

So, when Y=3,000, C=4,000. So he needs to borrow 4,000 - 3,000 = $1,000. So the answer should be F.

The break-even point occurs where income equals consumption. Given John's MPC of 3/4, we calculate his autonomous consumption (C0) as C0 = BE × (1 - MPC) = $7,000 × 0.25 = $1,750. At an income of $3,000, his consumption is C = $1,750 + 0.75 × $3,000 = $4,000. Since his income ($3,000) is less than his consumption ($4,000), he must borrow $1,000.

Answer: F
