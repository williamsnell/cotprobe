Question:

A 35-year-old man comes to the office because of 1-week history of mid low back pain that radiates down his right leg. The pain began after the patient lifted a heavy box onto his truck. He rates his current pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. He has been unable to find a comfortable position and has been sleeping in a recliner. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, and he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday and Saturday nights. BMI is 27 kg/m2 . He appears uncomfortable and stands during the physical examination. Vital signs are normal. Straight-leg raise test is positive on the right, with loss of right ankle reflex. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?

Options:

A: Piriformis syndrome
B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus
C: Compression fracture of the spine
D: Ankylosing spondylitis
E: Osteophyte formation
F: Spondylolisthesis
G: Lumbar spinal stenosis
H: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction
I: Hypertrophy of the facet joints

Okay, so I have this question about a patient with back pain, and I need to figure out the most likely diagnosis. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The patient is a 35-year-old man who came in with a 1-week history of mid to low back pain that's radiating down his right leg. The pain started after he lifted a heavy box, which is a classic scenario for something like a herniated disc. He rates the pain as an 8 out of 10, which is pretty significant. He can't find a comfortable position and is sleeping in a recliner, which makes sense because lying down might make the leg pain worse.

Looking at his medical history, it's unremarkable, so no prior issues to consider. He doesn't take any medications, but he's a smoker with a pack a day for 25 years. Smoking isn't directly related to back issues but can affect healing. He drinks beer on weekends, but that's probably not directly relevant here.

His BMI is 27, which is a bit overweight, increasing the load on his spine. He appears uncomfortable and stands during the exam, which might be because sitting or lying down hurts more. Vital signs are normal, so no fever or other systemic issues.

The key physical exam findings: straight-leg raise (SLR) test is positive on the right. That usually indicates a nerve issue, like a herniated disc, because the test compresses the nerve root. Also, there's loss of the right ankle reflex, which suggests a neurological deficit, possibly from a compressed nerve, like L5 or S1. The rest of the exam is normal, so no other obvious issues like muscle weakness elsewhere or other deficits.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Piriformis syndrome – This causes sciatica but typically the pain is more in the buttock and doesn't usually cause a positive SLR. The reflex loss isn't typical either.

B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus – That's another term for a herniated disc, which fits with the SLR positive and reflex loss. The history of lifting makes it more likely.

C: Compression fracture – Usually occurs in older adults, especially with osteoporosis. His age is 35, and he's smoking but not necessarily osteoporotic. Also, compression fractures can cause back pain but may not present with a positive SLR or reflex loss unless there's a neurological component, which is less common.

D: Ankylosing spondylitis – This is an inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine, but it's more chronic and bilateral, and the patient doesn't have the typical morning stiffness or history of it.

E: Osteophyte formation – These are bone spurs, often due to degeneration. They can cause nerve compression, but at 35, it's less likely unless there's significant prior wear and tear. The acute onset after lifting points more towards a herniation.

F: Spondylolisthesis – This is a slipping of one vertebra over another, often causing back pain. It can sometimes cause sciatica, but the positive SLR and reflex loss are more specific to a disc issue.

G: Lumbar spinal stenosis – Narrowing of the spinal canal typically affects older adults and causes pain that worsens with walking. He doesn't have a history of that, and his symptoms are more acute.

H: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction – This can cause lower back pain and sometimes leg pain, but the SLR test is usually negative. The reflex loss isn't a typical finding here.

I: Hypertrophy of the facet joints – This is part of degenerative changes. It can cause back pain but again, less likely in a 35-year-old without prior issues, and the acute onset suggests something else.

Putting it all together, the positive straight-leg raise test, loss of reflex, and the history of lifting a heavy object make a herniated nucleus pulposus (displaced disc) the most likely diagnosis. The pain radiating down the leg (sciatica) fits with a disc pressing on a nerve root in the lumbar spine.

The patient's symptoms, including mid to low back pain radiating down the right leg, a positive straight-leg raise test, and loss of the right ankle reflex, strongly suggest a herniated disc. The history of lifting a heavy box aligns with the onset of such an injury. Other options like piriformis syndrome, compression fractures, or facet joint issues are less likely given the presentation and patient age. 

B: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus

Answer: B
