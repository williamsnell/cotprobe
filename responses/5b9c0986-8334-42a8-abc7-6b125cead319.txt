Okay, let's try to figure out how much HarryHyppeis will be paid. So, the problem says he's paid a straight wage of $2.89 and a half per hour. Hmm, wait, "1/2" after the dollar amountâ€”does that mean he's paid $2.89 plus half of something? Or is it $2.89 per hour, and the half is part of the rate? I think it's the latter. So his hourly wage is $2.89 multiplied by 1.5, which is the same as $2.89 plus half of $2.89.

Let me calculate that first. Half of $2.89 is $1.445, so adding that to $2.89 gives me $4.335 per hour. Wait, that seems a bit high for an hourly wage, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, maybe the "1/2" is a typo or misinterpretation. Oh, perhaps it's $2.89 per hour, and he gets paid 1.5 times for some hours, like overtime? But the question doesn't specify overtime, so maybe it's a straightforward calculation.

Wait, the wording is "paid a straight wage of $2.89 (1/2) per hour." The parentheses might mean that the 1/2 is part of the rate, so maybe it's $2.89 for half an hour, meaning the full hour would be double that, so $5.78 per hour. That makes more sense. Let me check that again. If $2.89 is for half an hour, then per hour it's $5.78. That seems more reasonable.

So, if he works 9 hours a day for 6 days, the total hours are 9 * 6 = 54 hours. At $5.78 per hour, his total pay would be 54 * 5.78.

Let me calculate that. 54 times 5 is 270, and 54 times 0.78 is... let's see, 54 * 0.7 = 37.8, and 54 * 0.08 = 4.32. Adding those together gives 37.8 + 4.32 = 42.12. So total pay is 270 + 42.12 = $312.12. Wait, but that's not one of the options. The highest option is I: $198.72, which is way lower. So maybe I misinterpreted the rate.

Let me go back. Maybe the "1/2" is part of the dollar amount, like $2.89 and a half, meaning $2.895 per hour. So $2.895 per hour. Let me recalculate that. So 54 hours * $2.895.

Let me compute that step by step. 54 * 2 = 108, 54 * 0.895 = ?

Wait, 54 * 0.895: let's break it down. 54 * 0.8 = 43.2, 54 * 0.09 = 4.86, 54 * 0.005 = 0.27. Adding those gives 43.2 + 4.86 = 48.06 + 0.27 = 48.33. So total is 108 + 48.33 = $156.33. Looking at the options, option C is $156.33. That seems to fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe the rate was $5.78 per hour, but that gave a much higher number not in the options. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that his hourly wage is $2.89 multiplied by 1.5, which is $4.335 per hour. Let me check that again.

54 hours * $4.335 per hour. Let's compute 54 * 4 = 216, 54 * 0.335 = ?

54 * 0.3 = 16.2, 54 * 0.035 = 1.89. So 16.2 + 1.89 = 18.09. So total is 216 + 18.09 = $234.09, which isn't an option either. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the "1/2" is a typo, and the wage is just $2.89 per hour. Then total pay would be 54 * 2.89. Let's compute that.

54 * 2 = 108, 54 * 0.89 = 48.06. So total is 108 + 48.06 = $156.06. Hmm, which is close to option C ($156.33), but not exact. But maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the "1/2" means he's paid $2.89 for half an hour, so per hour it's $5.78. But that led to $312, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct way is $2.89 per hour, so 54 * 2.89. Let me compute that more accurately.

54 * 2 = 108. 54 * 0.89: Let's compute 54 * 0.8 = 43.2, 54 * 0.09 = 4.86. So 43.2 +4.86=48.06. So total is 108 +48.06=156.06. But the options don't have that. Option C is 156.33. Hmm, so perhaps I should consider that maybe the "1/2" is a mistake, and the intended rate is $2.89 per hour, leading to 54 * 2.89 = 156.06, which rounds to 156.33? Or maybe the "1/2" is a decimal point, so it's $2.895 per hour. Let me check that.

54 * 2.895: Let's compute 54 * 2 =108, 54 * 0.895. 54 *0.8=43.2, 54 *0.095=5.13. So 43.2 +5.13=48.33. So total is 108 +48.33=156.33, which matches option C. So that must be the correct answer.

HarryHyppeis is paid a wage of $2.89 (1/2) per hour, which likely means $2.895 per hour. Working 9 hours a day for 6 days totals 54 hours. Multiplying 54 by $2.895 gives $156.33, corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
