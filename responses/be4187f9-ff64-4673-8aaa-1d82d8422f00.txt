Okay, so I've got this optics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... the question is about finding a single lens equivalent to a combination of a converging lens and a diverging lens. 

Alright, the setup is a thin converging lens with a focal length of 6 cm placed in contact with a thin diverging lens of focal length 10 cm. Wait, wait, I should make sure I got that right. So the converging lens has f1 = +6 cm because converging lenses have positive focal lengths. The diverging lens has f2 = -10 cm because diverging lenses have negative focal lengths. 

I remember there's a formula for combining two lenses when they are in contact. I think it's related to their focal lengths. Let me try to recall. Oh right, when two lenses are in contact, the combined focal length (F) can be found using the formula: 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2. Yeah, that sounds right. 

So plugging in the values, f1 is 6 cm and f2 is -10 cm. Let me compute that. 

1/F = 1/6 + 1/(-10). Let's calculate each part. 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, and 1/(-10) is -0.1. Adding them together: 0.1667 - 0.1 = 0.0667. So 1/F is approximately 0.0667. To find F, I take the reciprocal. 

F ≈ 1 / 0.0667 ≈ 15 cm. Wait, that can't be right because if I have a converging and a diverging lens, the sign of the combined focal length will depend on which one has a stronger effect. Let me double-check the calculation. 

1/6 is about 0.16667. 1/(-10) is -0.1. Adding them: 0.16667 - 0.1 = 0.06667. So yes, 1/F is 0.06667, so F is approximately 15 cm. But wait, the diverging lens has a larger magnitude (10 cm) than the converging one (6 cm). Does that affect the sign? Because when you add 1/6 and 1/(-10), the result is positive. So 1/F is positive, which means F is positive, indicating a converging lens. 

Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because the diverging lens usually would spread out the light, but maybe because the converging lens is stronger (since 6 is smaller than 10 in magnitude, but since it's converging, it's stronger). Hmm, actually, wait, no. The strength of a lens is related to the reciprocal of the focal length. So a 6 cm focal length lens has a higher power (1/6 ≈ 0.1667) compared to a 10 cm (1/10 = 0.1). So the converging lens (positive power) is stronger than the diverging one (negative power), so their combination should be positive, leading to a converging lens. 

Wait, but let me see the numbers again. So 1/6 is about 0.1667, and 1/(-10) is -0.1. Adding them gives 0.0667, so F is 15 cm, positive. So the equivalent lens is a converging lens of 15 cm focal length. 

Looking at the options, option I is 15 cm converging. So the answer should be I. 

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The formula for lenses in contact is indeed 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2. So yes, that's correct. 

Wait, another way to think about it: if you have a converging lens (positive f) and a diverging lens (negative f), the combined effect depends on the sum of their reciprocals. Since the converging lens has a higher power (1/6 > 1/10 in magnitude), the sum will be positive, so the equivalent lens is converging. So yeah, F is positive 15 cm. 

So the single lens equivalent is a converging lens with focal length 15 cm. Looking at the options, option I is that. So the answer is I.

The problem involves finding the equivalent single lens for a combination of a converging lens (f₁ = +6 cm) and a diverging lens (f₂ = -10 cm) in contact. Using the formula for combining lenses in contact, 1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂, the calculation yields 1/F = 1/6 + (-1/10) = 0.0667. Taking the reciprocal gives F ≈ 15 cm, and since 1/F is positive, the equivalent lens is a converging lens. Among the options, the correct answer is I: 15 cm converging lens.
