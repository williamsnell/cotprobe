Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the function f(z) that's analytic on the upper half-plane, meaning the imaginary part of z is greater than zero. The conditions given are that f(f(z)) equals z, which suggests that f is its own inverse function. Additionally, the derivative f'(z) is given as 1/z squared. I need to find the most general expression of f(z) and then determine the value of f(2).

First, let me break down what I know. Since f is analytic and f(f(z)) = z, f must be a bijective function, right? Because for a function to have an inverse, it needs to be both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). So f is invertible, and applying it twice gives the identity function.

Now, the derivative f'(z) is 1/z². I remember that if I have the derivative of a function, I can integrate it to find the function itself, up to a constant. So integrating f'(z) should give me f(z), plus a constant term. Let me write that down.

The integral of f'(z) dz is the integral of 1/z² dz. The integral of 1/z² is -1/z + C, where C is the constant of integration. So f(z) = -1/z + C.

Wait, but I need to make sure that this function satisfies f(f(z)) = z. Let me test this. If I substitute f(z) into itself, I should get back z.

Let me compute f(f(z)):

f(f(z)) = f(-1/z + C) = -1/( (-1/z + C) ) + C.

Simplify that: -1/( (-1/z + C) ) is equal to -1 divided by (C - 1/z). Let me write that as -1/(C - 1/z). To make this clearer, maybe I can write it as -1 divided by ( (C z - 1)/z ), which would be -z/(C z - 1). So f(f(z)) becomes -z/(C z - 1) + C.

But according to the condition, f(f(z)) must be equal to z. So:

-z/(C z - 1) + C = z.

Let me rearrange this equation:

-z/(C z - 1) + C = z.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by (C z - 1) to eliminate the denominator.

Multiplying each term by (C z - 1):

-z + C (C z - 1) = z (C z - 1).

Expanding both sides:

Left side: -z + C² z - C.

Right side: C z² - z.

So let's write that out:

(-z + C² z - C) = C z² - z.

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:

(-z + C² z - C) - (C z² - z) = 0.

Simplify term by term:

- z + C² z - C - C z² + z = 0.

The -z and +z cancel out, leaving:

C² z - C - C z² = 0.

Factor out C:

C (C z - 1 - z²) = 0.

So either C = 0, or the term in the parentheses is zero.

If C = 0, let's see what happens. Then f(z) = -1/z.

Then f(f(z)) = f(-1/z) = -1/(-1/z) = -1 * (-z) = z, which satisfies the condition. So that's good.

Alternatively, if C ≠ 0, then we have:

C z - 1 - z² = 0.

That would imply z² - C z + 1 = 0.

But this is a quadratic equation, and for this to hold for all z, the coefficients must be zero. However, that's only possible if C = 0 and 1 = 0, which is impossible. So the only possibility is C = 0.

Therefore, f(z) = -1/z is the only function that satisfies both f(f(z)) = z and f'(z) = 1/z².

Wait, but the problem states that f is defined on the upper half-plane, IM(z) > 0. So I need to check if f(z) = -1/z maps the upper half-plane to itself. Let me think about that.

Suppose z is in the upper half-plane, so Im(z) > 0. Then what is Im(-1/z)?

Let me represent z as x + iy, where y > 0.

Then 1/z = (x - iy)/(x² + y²), so -1/z = (-x + iy)/(x² + y²).

The imaginary part of -1/z is y/(x² + y²), which is positive since y > 0. So yes, -1/z is also in the upper half-plane. Thus, f(z) = -1/z maps the upper half-plane to itself, which is consistent with the given domain.

So f(z) = -1/z is the function we're looking for.

Now, the question asks for f(2). Plugging in z = 2:

f(2) = -1/2 = -0.5.

Looking at the options, option I is -0.5. So the answer should be I.

The function f(z) is determined to be -1/z, which satisfies both the given conditions. Evaluating at z=2 gives f(2) = -0.5.
