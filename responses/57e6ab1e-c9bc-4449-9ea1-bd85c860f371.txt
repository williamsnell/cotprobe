Okay, so I've got this problem about a hospital using a Co-60 source for cancer therapy. The question is asking me to find the value of X, which represents the rate of gamma rays incident on the patient in units of 10^11 Bq. The options are given from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let's start by understanding the problem. The source is 3.0 x 10^14 Bq, which means it's decaying at that rate. Each disintegration of Co-60 emits two gamma rays: one at 1.1 MeV and another at 1.3 MeV. So, for every decay, two gamma rays are emitted. But wait, the question is about the rate of gamma rays incident on the patient, so I think I need to calculate how many gamma rays reach the patient per second.

The patient is located 4.0 meters away from the source and has an area of 0.30 m². So, this is a geometry problem involving the spread of gamma rays from the source to the patient. 

First, I remember that the number of decays per second is the activity, which is given as 3.0 x 10^14 Bq. Since each decay produces two gamma rays, the total number of gamma rays emitted per second is 2 times the activity. So that would be 2 * 3.0e14 = 6.0e14 gamma rays per second.

But these gamma rays spread out in space, so the intensity (number per unit area) at the patient's location depends on the inverse square law. The area over which the gamma rays are spread can be calculated using a sphere with a radius equal to the distance from the source to the patient. The radius is 4.0 meters, so the surface area of the sphere is 4πr². 

Calculating that: 4 * π * (4.0)^2 = 4 * π * 16 = 64π ≈ 201.06 m². 

So, the number of gamma rays per square meter per second (intensity) at the patient's location would be the total gamma rays emitted per second divided by the surface area of the sphere. 

So that's 6.0e14 gamma rays/s divided by 201.06 m². Let me compute that: 6e14 / 201.06 ≈ 2.985e12 gamma rays/(m²·s).

But wait, the patient has an area of 0.30 m². So the total number of gamma rays incident on the patient per second is the intensity multiplied by the patient's area. 

So, 2.985e12 * 0.30 ≈ 8.955e11 gamma rays per second. 

Wait, but the question states the rate is X*10^11 Bq. So X would be approximately 8.955, which is close to option J: 8.95.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

1. Activity is 3.0e14 Bq → 3.0e14 decays/s.
2. Each decay emits 2 gamma rays → 6.0e14 gamma rays/s.
3. The gamma rays spread over a sphere of radius 4m → surface area 4π(4)^2 = 64π ≈ 201.06 m².
4. Intensity (gamma rays per m² per second) → 6e14 / 201.06 ≈ 2.985e12.
5. Patient area 0.30 m² → 2.985e12 * 0.3 ≈ 8.955e11.
6. So X is 8.955, which rounds to 8.95 → option J.

Wait, but another thought: Since the question is about the rate in Bq, but wait, Bq is decays per second. Gamma rays per second would be a different unit. Hmm, but wait, the question states the rate is X*10^11 Bq. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the units here.

Wait, no, the question says "the rate of gamma rays incident on a patient... is X*10^11 Bq." But Bq is the unit of activity, which is decays per second. Gamma rays are not decays, though each decay produces gamma rays. So the rate of gamma rays would be in number per second, not Bq. So perhaps the question is using Bq as a way of expressing the rate, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly, and it's actually asking for the number of gamma rays per second, which would be expressed in something like 1/s, but the options have X*10^11 Bq. So perhaps the intended approach is to compute the number of gamma rays per second, and express it in terms of Bq, even though technically that's incorrect. So maybe the question is just using Bq as a unit for the count rate, which is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I need to consider the number of gamma rays emitted per second, so my calculation seems correct, and the answer is option J: 8.95.

To determine X, the rate of gamma rays incident on the patient in units of \(10^{11}\) Bq, we proceed as follows:

1. **Activity and Gamma Rays Produced**:  
   The Co-60 source has an activity of \(3.0 \times 10^{14}\) Bq, meaning \(3.0 \times 10^{14}\) disintegrations occur per second. Each disintegration emits two gamma rays, so the total gamma rays emitted per second are:  
   \[
   2 \times 3.0 \times 10^{14} = 6.0 \times 10^{14} \, \text{gamma rays/s}.
   \]

2. **Intensity of Gamma Rays at Patient’s Location**:  
   The gamma rays spread uniformly over the surface of a sphere with radius \(4.0 \, \text{m}\). The surface area of the sphere is:  
   \[
   4\pi r^2 = 4\pi (4.0)^2 = 64\pi \approx 201.06 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]  
   The intensity of gamma rays at the patient’s location (gamma rays per square meter per second) is:  
   \[
   \frac{6.0 \times 10^{14}}{201.06} \approx 2.985 \times 10^{12} \, \text{gamma rays/(m}^2\text{s)}.
   \]

3. **Gamma Rays Incident on Patient**:  
   The patient has an area of \(0.30 \, \text{m}^2\). The total gamma rays incident on the patient per second are:  
   \[
   2.985 \times 10^{12} \times 0.30 \approx 8.955 \times 10^{11} \, \text{gamma rays/s}.
   \]

4. **Expressing in Terms of \(X \times 10^{11}\) Bq**:  
   The rate of gamma rays incident on the patient is \(8.955 \times 10^{11}\), so \(X \approx 8.95\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

J: 8.95
