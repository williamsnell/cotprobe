Question:

A previously healthy 40-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of constant substernal chest pain for 12 hours that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?

Options:

A: Pulmonary alveoli
B: Aortic intima
C: Myocardium
D: Cardiac valves
E: Vascular endothelium
F: Esophageal sphincter
G: Pleural membrane
H: Tracheal tissue
I: Bronchial epithelium
J: Pericardium

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through it carefully and think step by step.

The patient is a 40-year-old man with a history of being healthy. He comes to the ER with substernal chest pain lasting 12 hours, which gets worse when he coughs or breathes in. The pain is relieved when he sits up and leans forward. His vital signs are a bit off: temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 120/min, and BP is 110/60. 

On exam, the lungs are clear, but cardiac exam shows distant heart sounds. The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. The chest X-ray is normal. So, the question is asking which tissue is injured, with options from A to J.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the chest pain characteristics. It's substernal, meaning it's under the sternum. It's constant, worse with coughing and inspiration. Relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. That sounds familiar—maybe something related to the pericardium or esophagus? Because I remember that pericarditis can cause pain that's worse when lying down and better when sitting up. But wait, in this case, it's worse with coughing and inspiration. Also, the heart sounds being distant might indicate pericardial effusion or something affecting heart sound transmission.

The ECG showing diffuse ST elevation in all leads is interesting. That's a bit unusual. Typically, ST elevation in multiple leads can suggest things like STEMI (which is usually in specific leads depending on the artery affected), but if it's in all leads, that's more concerning for something like pericarditis. Wait, pericarditis usually causes ST elevation in the limb leads and maybe some precordial leads, but not all. Alternatively, maybe it's a false positive or another condition.

The chest X-ray is normal, so no obvious pneumonia or pleurisy. Lungs are clear on auscultation, so probably no pulmonary cause for the pain.

Looking at the options:

A: Pulmonary alveoli – probably not, since the lungs are clear.

B: Aortic intima – could be a dissection, but that would present with different symptoms, maybe more sudden and tearing pain. Also, ECG would vary.

C: Myocardium – if it's a STEMI, but the ST elevation is too widespread. Plus, pericarditis can mimic STEMI sometimes.

D: Cardiac valves – unlikely, as valvular issues usually present with murmurs or other symptoms.

E: Vascular endothelium – not sure, but maybe related to inflammation.

F: Esophageal sphincter – could cause chest pain, but usually more related to reflux. The pain here is more positional and severe.

G: Pleural membrane – pleuritis would cause sharp pain with breathing, but the ECG and heart sounds would be different. Plus, the x-ray is normal.

H: Tracheal tissue – maybe, but usually causes more upper airway symptoms, and the heart sounds wouldn't be affected.

I: Bronchial epithelium – similar to pleuritis; maybe not.

J: Pericardium – this seems to fit. Pericarditis can cause substernal pain worse with inspiration, relieved by sitting up. The distant heart sounds (muffled) are a classic sign. The ECG might show diffuse ST elevation, though that's more specific for pericarditis.

Wait, but why is the ECG showing ST elevation in all leads? I thought pericarditis usually causes ST elevation in the limb leads and maybe some precordial ones, but not all. Or maybe it's a variant. Alternatively, could it be something else like acute pericardial injury leading to pericarditis, which would involve the pericardium.

Another thought: the patient's ECG showing diffuse ST elevation could also be a sign of myocarditis, but that's more about the myocardium. But the pain presentation and heart sounds point more towards pericardium.

Alternatively, could it be esophageal injury? Because sometimes esophageal issues can cause chest pain that's positional. For example, esophagitis or a tear (like from vomiting). The pain would be worse with swallowing or coughing, which fits. But the ECG would probably not show ST elevation in all leads. Also, the heart sounds being distant might not fit.

Wait, but the ECG findings are crucial here. If it's diffuse ST elevation, that's a big clue. Pericarditis can indeed cause this, as the inflammation affects the pericardium, leading to ST elevation in multiple leads, especially if it's a widespread pericarditis.

The patient's temperature is elevated, which suggests an inflammatory process, supporting pericarditis. His pulse is high, maybe due to pain or fever.

So, putting it all together: substernal pain, worse with coughing (which can increase intra-thoracic pressure), relieved by sitting up (classic for pericarditis). Distant heart sounds (muffled due to pericardial effusion). ECG with diffuse ST elevation. Chest X-ray normal, so no pleurisy or lung issues.

Therefore, the injury is to the pericardium. So the answer should be J.

The patient presents with substernal chest pain that worsens with coughing and inspiration and is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. These characteristics are consistent with pericarditis, a condition where the pericardium becomes inflamed. The elevated temperature, tachycardia, and distant heart sounds further support this diagnosis. The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads, which is a hallmark of pericarditis. Additionally, the chest X-ray is normal, ruling out pulmonary causes. The most likely cause of the condition is injury to the pericardium.

Answer: J
