Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Mr. Ed Williams bought a new truck, and we need to find out the amount he needs to finance and the monthly payment to pay it off in a year with a 5% finance charge.

First, let's list out all the given information:

- Price of truck: $3,000
- Additional equipment: $240
- Sales tax: 5%
- Insurance: $60
- Cash deposit: $500
- Used car allowance: $732
- Finance charge: 5%

Hmm, I think the first step is to calculate the total amount before the finance charge. So, we need to add up the truck price, additional equipment, and insurance. Then, calculate the sales tax on that sum, and then add it all together.

Wait, no, I think sales tax is applied to the truck and equipment because those are taxable. Insurance might not be taxable, but I'm not sure. But I think in this case, the problem says "sales tax 5%", so I'll assume it's only on the truck and equipment.

So, step by step:

1. Calculate the sum of the truck and additional equipment: $3,000 + $240 = $3,240.

2. Then apply the 5% sales tax on that amount: 5% of 3,240 is 0.05 * 3,240 = $162.

3. So, the total before considering the deposit and allowance is $3,240 + $162 = $3,402.

Wait, but insurance is $60. Does that get added here? I think insurance is a separate cost, so maybe it's added after. Or perhaps it's part of the financed amount. I'm a bit confused. Let me see.

Wait, the problem says "the amount to be financed". So, the cash deposit and used car allowance are probably subtracted from the total cost to find the financed amount.

So, total cost includes the truck, equipment, tax, and insurance. Let's calculate that:

- Truck and equipment: $3,000 + $240 = $3,240
- Sales tax: 5% of 3,240 = $162
- Insurance: $60
So total cost is $3,240 + $162 + $60 = $3,462.

Now, subtract the cash deposit and used car allowance:

$3,462 - $500 (deposit) - $732 (allowance) = $3,462 - $1,232 = $2,230.

Wait, that can't be right. Because $500 + $732 is $1,232. So, 3,462 minus 1,232 is indeed $2,230. So the amount to be financed is $2,230.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, the deposit and allowance might be applied before tax, but I think in this case, the problem is structured so that the deposit and allowance are subtracted after adding everything else.

Now, the amount to be financed is $2,230, and there's a 5% finance charge. So, the total amount owed would be 2,230 plus 5% interest on that amount.

Wait, but is the finance charge calculated on the amount to be financed, or is it a simple interest? Since it's a one-year plan, maybe it's simple interest.

So, finance charge: 5% of $2,230 = 0.05 * 2,230 = $111.50.

Therefore, total amount to be paid back is $2,230 + $111.50 = $2,341.50.

Now, to find the monthly payment, we divide this by 12 months. So, 2,341.50 / 12 = let's calculate that.

2,341.50 รท 12: 12 * 195 = 2,340. So, 195 would be 12*195=2,340, so 2,341.50 is 195.125 per month. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the amount to be financed. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the insurance is added before the finance charge. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the total cost is truck + equipment + tax + insurance.

So, truck + equipment: 3,000 + 240 = 3,240.

Tax: 5% of 3,240 = 162. So 3,240 + 162 = 3,402.

Add insurance: 3,402 + 60 = 3,462.

Then subtract cash deposit (500) and used car allowance (732): 3,462 - 500 = 2,962; 2,962 -732=2,230. So that's correct.

Now, the finance charge is 5% on 2,230: 111.50. Total amount: 2,230 + 111.50 = 2,341.50.

Divide by 12: 2,341.50 รท12 = 195.125. So approximately $195.13 per month.

Looking at the options, option D is $195, option H is $210.50, which is higher. Option A is $196.50, which is close to our calculated 195.13.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the finance charge again. Maybe it's compound interest or something else, but for a one-year term, simple interest is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the insurance is not part of the financed amount. Let me see the problem again: "the amount to be financed". So, maybe the insurance is a separate cost, not part of the financing. So, the initial total would be truck + equipment + tax, then subtract deposit and allowance, then add finance charge.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me try that.

So, truck + equipment = 3,000 + 240 = 3,240.

Tax: 5% of 3,240 = 162. So total before deposit and allowance is 3,240 + 162 = 3,402.

Subtract cash deposit: 3,402 - 500 = 2,902.

Subtract used car allowance: 2,902 - 732 = 2,170.

Now, apply 5% finance charge on 2,170: 0.05 * 2,170 = 108.50.

Total amount to pay: 2,170 + 108.50 = 2,278.50.

Wait, but then the insurance is $60. Is that part of the amount to be financed? Hmm, the problem says "the amount to be financed", which likely includes all costs except perhaps the insurance, which might be paid separately. Or maybe the insurance is included.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states: "find the amount to be financed, and determine the amount to be paid each month to pay off the truck in one year." So, the amount to be financed includes all costs except perhaps any down payments, like the cash deposit and used car allowance.

Wait, perhaps the used car allowance is a reduction in the purchase price. So, the total cost is truck + equipment + tax + insurance, then subtract the deposit and allowance.

So, total cost: 3,000 + 240 + 162 (tax) + 60 (insurance) = 3,462.

Subtract deposit (500) and allowance (732): 3,462 - 500 = 2,962; 2,962 -732=2,230.

So, amount to be financed is $2,230.

Now, the finance charge is 5% on 2,230: 0.05 * 2,230 = 111.50.

Total amount to pay: 2,230 + 111.50 = 2,341.50.

Monthly payment: 2,341.50 / 12 = 195.125, which is about $195.13.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: $195. But option A is $196.50, which is a bit higher. Let me check if I made a calculation error.

Wait, maybe the finance charge is calculated differently. Perhaps it's not simple interest but something else. Or perhaps the insurance is not part of the financed amount. Let me try that approach.

If insurance is not part of the financed amount, then the amount to be financed would be:

Truck + equipment + tax = 3,000 + 240 + 162 = 3,402.

Subtract deposit (500) and allowance (732): 3,402 - 500 = 2,902; 2,902 -732=2,170.

Finance charge: 5% of 2,170 = 108.50.

Total amount: 2,170 + 108.50 = 2,278.50.

Then, add the insurance cost of $60? Or is that separate? The problem says to pay off the truck, so maybe the insurance is a separate payment. But the question is about the amount to be financed, which might not include insurance. So, the amount to be financed is $2,170, plus 5% interest, making it $2,278.50. Then, insurance is an extra $60 per month or total?

Wait, the problem says "to pay off the truck in one year", so perhaps the insurance is a monthly cost, but not part of the financed amount. So, the insurance would be an additional $60 per month. But the question is about the amount to be financed, so perhaps we don't include it in the financed amount.

Alternatively, maybe the insurance is part of the total cost, so we have to include it in the amount to be financed.

I think the initial approach where total cost includes insurance is correct, leading to $2,230 to be financed, plus 5% interest, totaling $2,341.50, and monthly payments of approximately $195.13, which rounds to $195.13. But since the options don't have that, and option D is $195, that's the closest.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is $2,341.50, which is the total amount to be paid, not the monthly payment. So the question has two parts: amount to be financed and the monthly payment. But the options only show one value per option, so perhaps the question is only asking for the monthly payment.

Wait, the question says: "find the amount to be financed, and determine the amount to be paid each month...". So, the answer options might list both, but the options given are single values, so perhaps the question is only asking for the monthly payment.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, each a single number. So, perhaps the question is asking for the monthly payment. So, from our calculation, $195.13, which is closest to option D ($195) or option A ($196.50). Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the amount to be financed. Let me recalculate the total cost.

Truck: $3,000
Additional equipment: $240
Sales tax: 5% on (3,000 +240) = 5% * 3,240 = 162
Insurance: $60

Total cost: 3,000 + 240 + 162 +60 = 3,462.

Cash deposit: $500
Used car allowance: $732

So, amount to be financed: 3,462 - 500 -732 = 3,462 -1,232=2,230.

Finance charge: 5% of 2,230 = 111.50.

Total amount to pay: 2,230 +111.50=2,341.50.

Monthly payment: 2,341.50 /12= 195.125, so $195.13.

Looking at the options, D is $195, which is the closest. But let me check if the finance charge is applied differently. Perhaps it's calculated on the total amount including insurance, but that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the finance charge is applied to the amount after subtracting the deposit and allowance, but that's what I did.

Alternatively, maybe the used car allowance is subtracted before tax. Let me try that.

Truck + equipment = 3,000 +240=3,240.

Subtract used car allowance: 3,240 -732=2,508.

Then, add tax: 5% of 2,508=125.40.

Add insurance: 2,508 +125.40=2,633.40.

Subtract cash deposit: 2,633.40 -500=2,133.40.

Now, amount to be financed is $2,133.40.

Finance charge: 5% of 2,133.40=106.67.

Total amount: 2,133.40 +106.67=2,240.07.

Monthly payment: 2,240.07 /12โ186.67. Hmm, that's not matching any options either.

Wait, but this approach is different because I subtracted the used car allowance before tax. I'm not sure if that's correct. The problem says "used car allowance" which is likely a reduction in the purchase price, so it should be subtracted before tax.

So, let me recalculate that way.

Truck + equipment: 3,000 +240=3,240.

Subtract used car allowance: 3,240 -732=2,508.

Add tax: 5% of 2,508=125.40. So total is 2,508 +125.40=2,633.40.

Add insurance: 2,633.40 +60=2,693.40.

Subtract cash deposit: 2,693.40 -500=2,193.40.

Amount to be financed: 2,193.40.

Finance charge: 5% of 2,193.40=109.67.

Total amount: 2,193.40 +109.67=2,303.07.

Monthly payment: 2,303.07 /12โ191.92. Hmm, still not matching any options.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to include the insurance in the amount to be financed, leading to $2,230, with a finance charge of $111.50, total $2,341.50, and monthly payment of approximately $195.13, which would be option D ($195).

Alternatively, perhaps the finance charge is applied on a different basis. Let me check if the total amount to be financed is $2,230, and the monthly payment is calculated with simple interest.

Simple interest formula: I = P * r * t.

Where P=2,230, r=0.05, t=1 year.

I=2,230 *0.05*1=111.50.

Total amount: 2,230 +111.50=2,341.50.

Divide by 12: 2,341.50 /12=195.125, so $195.13.

Looking at the options, the closest is D: $195.

But wait, option G is $2,341.50, which is the total amount, so perhaps the question is asking for the amount to be financed, which is $2,230, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A to J, and the values are for the monthly payment, I think.

Wait, the question says to find the amount to be financed and the monthly payment. But the options are single numbers, so perhaps the question is only asking for the monthly payment, which is $195.13, so option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try another approach: perhaps the used car allowance is subtracted after tax and before insurance.

Truck + equipment: 3,000 +240=3,240.

Add tax: 5% of 3,240=162. Total: 3,240 +162=3,402.

Subtract used car allowance: 3,402 -732=2,670.

Add insurance: 2,670 +60=2,730.

Subtract cash deposit: 2,730 -500=2,230.

Amount to be financed: $2,230.

Finance charge: 5% of 2,230=111.50.

Total: 2,230 +111.50=2,341.50.

Monthly payment: 2,341.50 /12=195.13.

Same result as before. So, the monthly payment is approximately $195.13, which is closest to option D: $195.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D: $195.
</think>

To determine the monthly payment, we first calculate the total cost of the truck, including additional equipment, sales tax, and insurance. Then, we subtract the cash deposit and used car allowance to find the amount to be financed. Applying a 5% finance charge to this amount gives the total amount to be paid. Finally, dividing this total by 12 months yields the monthly payment.

1. **Total Cost Before Finance Charge**:  
   - Truck + Equipment = $3,000 + $240 = $3,240  
   - Sales Tax = 5% of $3,240 = $162  
   - Insurance = $60  
   - Total = $3,240 + $162 + $60 = $3,462  

2. **Subtract Cash Deposit and Used Car Allowance**:  
   - Amount to be Financed = $3,462 - $500 (Deposit) - $732 (Allowance) = $2,230  

3. **Calculate Finance Charge**:  
   - Finance Charge = 5% of $2,230 = $111.50  

4. **Total Amount to be Paid**:  
   - Total = $2,230 + $111.50 = $2,341.50  

5. **Monthly Payment**:  
   - Monthly Payment = $2,341.50 รท 12 โ $195.13  

The closest option to $195.13 is **D: $195**.

Answer: D
