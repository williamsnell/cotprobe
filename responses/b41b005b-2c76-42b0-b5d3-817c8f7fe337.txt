Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about corporate responsibility reporting by the world's largest companies. The question is asking what percentage of these companies reported their corporate responsibility in a 2008 survey. The options are A through J, ranging from 10% to 90%.

First, I need to think about what I know regarding corporate responsibility reporting. I remember that in recent years, there's been a significant push for companies to be more transparent about their social and environmental impacts. But I'm not sure about the exact figures, especially for 2008.

I think back to some articles I've read. I recall that around the mid-2000s, more companies started adopting sustainability reports. However, I'm not certain if it was as high as 90% or more like 50-70%. I also remember some surveys indicating that a majority of large companies were reporting, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage.

Wait, maybe I should consider the context. In 2008, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was quite prominent. They had a lot of companies using their framework for sustainability reporting. I think GRI's adoption was growing, but was it as high as 80-90%? Or was it more like 60-70%?

I also remember reading that while many companies were starting to report, not all of them were doing it. Some might have been in the early stages of adopting such practices, especially in industries that were more resistant. So the percentage might not have been 100%, which is option D. It's also unlikely to be as low as 10-20%, so options H and J are probably too low.

Looking at the options again, E is 80%, F is 70%, and G is 60%. I'm trying to recall if it was closer to 70-80% or more moderate. I think a survey around that time might have found that a significant majority, but not the vast majority, were reporting. Maybe around 60-70%? Or perhaps even higher.

Wait, I think the figure I remember is that around 70% of the top companies were reporting their corporate responsibility in 2008. That would point towards option F, which is 70%. Alternatively, maybe it was 80%, but I'm not as confident about that.

Another angle: the question specifies the "world's largest companies." These are typically more established and might have more resources to dedicate to reporting. So the percentage is likely higher than the general population of companies. If I'm considering the top 100 or top 500 companies, perhaps 70-90% were reporting.

But I'm still unsure whether it's 70% or 80%. I think I've heard that by the late 2000s, a substantial number of large companies were on board with sustainability reporting. Maybe 70% is a commonly cited figure, or perhaps 80% is more accurate.

Wait, I think I read a report that stated that around 70% of the world's largest companies were reporting their corporate responsibility in 2008. That would make option F the correct answer.
