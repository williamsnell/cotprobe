Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is: What is the area, in square units, of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of 12π units? The options are A through J, with numbers like 24, 18, 36, etc.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the area of a square. The square's side length is equal to the radius of a particular circle. And that circle has a circumference of 12π units. So first, maybe I should find the radius of the circle, and then use that as the side length of the square to find its area.

Let me start by recalling the formula for the circumference of a circle. I remember that the circumference C is equal to 2π times the radius r. So the formula is C = 2πr. They've given me that the circumference is 12π. So I can plug that into the formula and solve for r.

So plugging in, I get 12π = 2πr. Now I need to solve for r. Let's see, if I divide both sides of the equation by 2π, that should isolate r. Let me do that:

12π / (2π) = r

Simplify the left side: 12 divided by 2 is 6, and π divided by π is 1. So 6 * 1 = 6. So r = 6 units. That makes sense.

Now that I have the radius, which is 6 units, I can use this as the side length of the square. The problem says the sides of the square are the same length as the radius. So each side of the square is 6 units long.

Next, I need to find the area of the square. The formula for the area of a square is side length squared. So area A = s², where s is the side length. In this case, s is 6 units. So plugging that in, A = 6².

Calculating that, 6 times 6 is 36. So the area of the square is 36 square units.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The circumference was 12π, which when divided by 2π gives 6 for the radius. Then the area of the square with side 6 is 6*6=36. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options, C is 36. So the answer should be option C.

The radius of the circle is 6 units, so the square has sides of 6 units. The area is 6² = 36.

Answer: C
