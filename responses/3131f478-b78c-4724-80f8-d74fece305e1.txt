Okay, so I've got this question about logical fallacies, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking: When someone tries to support a proposition with information that has nothing to do with the claim, which fallacy have they committed? The options are A through C, with C being irrelevant conclusion.

First, I need to recall what each of these fallacies means. Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. Each fallacy has a specific pattern of flawed reasoning.

Option A is the straw person fallacy. From what I remember, this happens when someone misrepresents someone else's argument to make it easier to attack. It's like creating a straw man that's easy to knock down because it's not the real argument. So, if I'm arguing against a position and I misstate it, that's a straw person. But the question here is about using irrelevant information, not misrepresenting someone's argument. So I don't think A is the right answer.

Option B is the genetic fallacy. I think this fallacy occurs when the argument attacks the source of the claim rather than the claim itself. For example, saying that a claim is wrong because it comes from a biased source. That's about the origin, not the relevance of the information. So if someone uses information that's irrelevant, it's not because they're attacking the source but because the info doesn't relate to the claim. So B might not be it either.

Option C is irrelevant conclusion. Wait, is that correct? I think the term might actually be "irrelevant conclusion," but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with something else. The irrelevant conclusion fallacy, or sometimes called the red herring, is when someone introduces an unrelated topic to divert attention from the issue at hand. But wait, the question is about supporting a proposition with irrelevant information. So maybe it's more about using irrelevant evidence to support a claim, which would be the "irrelevant conclusion" fallacy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another term that comes to mind is "appeal to irrelevant authority," but that's a different fallacy. Or perhaps "red herring," which is a type of distraction, but that's more about diverting the topic rather than using irrelevant info to support a point.

I think I might have made a mistake. Let me clarify: the irrelevant conclusion fallacy occurs when the conclusion is not supported by the premises and is irrelevant to them. So if someone's argument doesn't connect to their conclusion, that's irrelevant conclusion. But in this case, the person is using information that doesn't relate to the claim they're making. So that's supporting with irrelevant info, which would mean their evidence is not connected to the proposition. So yes, the fallacy here is irrelevant conclusion.

Wait, but sometimes this fallacy is also known as the "red herring," but I think red herring is more about introducing a distraction. So in the context of evidence, using irrelevant information to support a claim would fall under the irrelevant conclusion fallacy.

So putting it all together, the person is using information that's unrelated to the proposition they're trying to support. That's committing the irrelevant conclusion fallacy. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: irrelevant conclusion. The person has used information that doesn't relate to the proposition, making their evidence irrelevant to the claim.

Answer: C
