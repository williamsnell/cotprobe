The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Which of the following is the primary difference between an experiment and an observational study?

Options:

A: In an experiment, the researcher has no control over variables; in an observational study, the researcher can manipulate variables.
B: Experiments are only conducted on human subjects; observational studies can be conducted on nonhuman subjects.
C: Observational studies are conducted in a lab setting, while experiments can be conducted in any environment.
D: Experiments must be double-blind; observational studies do not need to be.
E: In an experiment, the researcher observes without interfering; in an observational study, the researcher manipulates the environment.
F: Experiments can only be conducted once; observational studies can be repeated.
G: Experiments must use randomized treatment and control groups; observational studies also use treatment and control groups, but they do not need to be randomized.
H: Experiments involve quantitative data; observational studies involve qualitative data.
I: In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations.
J: Experiments require a hypothesis; observational studies do not require a hypothesis.

Okay, so I've got this question about the difference between an experiment and an observational study. Hmm, I remember from my stats class that experiments involve some kind of manipulation, right? Let me think. 

In an experiment, the researcher actually changes one variable to see how it affects another. Like, if I'm testing if coffee makes people more alert, I'd give some people coffee and others a placebo, then see who's more alert. That's the treatment and control group thing. 

On the other hand, observational studies are where the researcher doesn't interfere. They just watch and record what happens naturally. Like observing birds to see their mating habits without changing anything. So the key is whether the researcher is manipulating variables or not.

Looking at the options, option I says that in an experiment, the researcher manipulates a variable to see its effect, while in an observational study, they just observe without interfering. That sounds right. 

Wait, let me check the other options. Option A says the opposite: in the experiment, no control, which isn't correct. Option E is similar but flips it, so that's wrong. Option G talks about randomization, which is more about the design but not the primary difference. 

So yeah, the primary difference is whether the researcher manipulates variables. So the answer should be I.

The primary difference is whether the researcher manipulates variables. Experiments involve manipulation to observe effects, while observational studies are conducted without interference.

Answer: I
