Okay, so I need to figure out how many sides a square-based pyramid has, including the bottom. Hmm, let me think about what a square-based pyramid looks like. I know a pyramid usually has a base and triangular faces that meet at a point, which is the apex. 

So, the base is a square, right? That means the base has four sides. Now, the pyramid will have triangular faces connecting each side of the base to the apex. Since the base is a square, there are four triangular faces around it. 

Wait, the question says "including the bottom." The bottom would be the base itself, which is a square. So, does the base count as one face or four sides? I think when they ask about the number of sides, they might be referring to the faces. So the base is one face, and each of the four triangular sides is another face. 

Let me add them up: one base face plus four triangular faces. That makes five faces in total. So the answer should be five. Looking at the options, G is five. 

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The base is one face, and each side is a triangle, so four triangles. Yeah, that adds up to five. So the correct answer is G.

The square-based pyramid has a square base (1 face) and four triangular sides connecting to the apex, totaling 5 faces.

Answer: G
