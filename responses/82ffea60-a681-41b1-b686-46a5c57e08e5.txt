Okay, so I have this differential equation problem here: dy/dt equals the square root of t, and the initial condition is y(1) = 1. I need to find y(4). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that dy/dt is the derivative of y with respect to t. So to find y(t), I need to integrate the right-hand side of the equation. The equation is dy/dt = sqrt(t), which is the same as t^(1/2). 

So, integrating both sides with respect to t should give me y(t). The integral of t^(1/2) dt. I think the integral of t^n is (t^(n+1))/(n+1) plus a constant, right? So applying that here, n is 1/2. So the integral becomes (t^(3/2))/(3/2) + C. Simplifying that, dividing by 3/2 is the same as multiplying by 2/3, so it's (2/3) * t^(3/2) + C.

Now, I need to find the constant C using the initial condition y(1) = 1. Let me plug t=1 into the equation. So y(1) = (2/3)*(1)^(3/2) + C = 1. Since 1 to any power is 1, that simplifies to (2/3) + C = 1. Solving for C, I subtract 2/3 from both sides, so C = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. 

So the equation for y(t) is (2/3)t^(3/2) + 1/3. Now, I need to find y(4). Let me plug t=4 into this equation. 

First, calculate t^(3/2). 4 to the power of 3/2 is the same as sqrt(4) cubed. The square root of 4 is 2, and 2 cubed is 8. So t^(3/2) is 8. 

Now plug that into the equation: (2/3)*8 + 1/3. Let me compute that. 2/3 of 8 is (2*8)/3 = 16/3. Then add 1/3: 16/3 + 1/3 = 17/3. 

What's 17 divided by 3? Well, 3 times 5 is 15, so 17/3 is 5 and 2/3, which is approximately 5.666... Looking at the options, option G is 5.667. So I think that's the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I integrate correctly? Yes, the integral of t^(1/2) is (2/3)t^(3/2). Then plugging in t=1: (2/3)(1) + C =1, so C=1/3. Then at t=4, (2/3)(8) +1/3 is 16/3 +1/3=17/3≈5.666, which is option G. So I think I did it right.

The differential equation dy/dt = sqrt(t) is integrated to find y(t) = (2/3)t^(3/2) + C. Using the initial condition y(1) = 1, the constant C is determined to be 1/3. Substituting t=4 into the solution gives y(4) = 17/3 ≈ 5.667. 

Answer: G
