Okay, so I've got this question about Justin and his fear of flying. He went through some therapy to overcome it, and I need to figure out which treatment he used. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question describes his therapy process. His therapist taught him relaxation exercises. He started by looking at pictures of airplanes, then moved on to seeing them take off at the airport, then went into an empty plane that wouldn't take off, and finally took a short flight. So it sounds like a gradual approach where he was exposed to the feared object or situation in increasing steps.

I remember that exposure therapy is a type of behavior therapy where the person is exposed to the feared object or situation in a controlled way, often starting with less anxiety-provoking situations and gradually moving to more intense ones. This is part of a broader approach called systematic desensitization. The idea is that by repeatedly facing the fear in a safe environment, the person learns to relax and the fear response diminishes.

Looking at the options, I need to match this description to one of the treatments listed. Let's go through the options one by one.

A: Psychoanalysis - This is more about exploring the unconscious mind and past experiences, often through free association. Doesn't seem to fit because Justin is practicing relaxation exercises and gradual exposure.

B: Behavior therapy - This focuses on observable behaviors and uses techniques like conditioning, such as exposure therapy. Fits because he's being exposed to his fears in a controlled way.

C: Cognitive therapy - Involves identifying and changing negative thought patterns. While he might have some cognitive work, the main method here is the exposure, which is more behavior-oriented.

D: Humanistic therapy - Focuses on personal growth and self-actualization, often using techniques like client-centered therapy. Doesn't match the structured exposure approach.

E: Existential therapy - Deals with meaning, freedom, and existence. Not really about exposure to fears.

F: Rational emotive behavior therapy - Part of cognitive therapy, focuses on changing irrational beliefs. More about thoughts than exposure.

G: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy - Combines mindfulness with cognitive techniques. Again, more about thoughts and being present, but the main method here seems to be exposure.

H: Group therapy - Involves group sessions, but the question describes individual therapy with specific steps.

I: Gestalt therapy - Focuses on the here and now, using techniques like role-playing. Doesn't match the exposure steps.

J: Reality therapy - Helps people focus on present realities and take actions to improve their situation. More about taking action in the present, but not specifically about exposure.

So, putting it all together, the process Justin went through is systematic desensitization, which is a form of behavior therapy. Therefore, the answer should be B: behavior therapy.

The treatment Justin underwent is best described as behavior therapy, specifically systematic desensitization, where he was gradually exposed to his fears in a controlled manner. 

Answer: B
