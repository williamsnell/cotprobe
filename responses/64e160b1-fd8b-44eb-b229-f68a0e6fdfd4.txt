Question:

Alex needs to borrow $\$10,\!000$ from the bank. The bank gives him two options. 1. A ten-year loan with an annual interest rate of $10\%$ compounded quarterly, with the condition that at the end of 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes. The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of the ten years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance. 2. A ten-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of $12\%$, with just one lump-sum payment at the end of the ten years. Find the positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes. Round your answer to the nearest dollar.

Okay, so I need to figure out the difference in total payments Alex has to make under two different loan schemes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand both options. 

Option 1 is a 10-year loan with a 10% annual interest rate compounded quarterly. But there's a condition: after 5 years, Alex has to pay half of what he owes at that point, and the other half will continue to accrue interest for the next 5 years. Then he'll pay off the remaining balance at the end of 10 years.

Option 2 is a 10-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of 12%, and he just makes one lump-sum payment at the end of the 10 years.

I need to calculate the total amount Alex pays back under each option and then find the positive difference between them.

Let's start with Option 1.

**Option 1: 10% Compounded Quarterly with a Mid-Term Payment**

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($10,000).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 0.10).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (quarterly means 4 times, so n=4).
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

First, we need to find out how much Alex owes after 5 years. Then, he'll pay half of that, and the other half will continue to accrue interest for another 5 years.

Calculating the amount after 5 years:
P = $10,000
r = 0.10
n = 4
t = 5

A = 10000*(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5)
Let me compute that step by step.

0.10 divided by 4 is 0.025. So each quarter, the interest rate is 2.5%.

4*5 is 20, so it's compounded 20 times over 5 years.

So A = 10000*(1.025)^20.

I can calculate (1.025)^20. Let me see, 1.025^20 is approximately... I think it's around 1.6386, but I should double-check.

Yes, (1.025)^20 ≈ 1.6386164.

So A = 10000 * 1.6386164 ≈ 16,386.16.

So after 5 years, Alex owes about $16,386.16. He pays half of that, which is 16,386.16 / 2 = $8,193.08.

The remaining $8,193.08 will continue to accrue interest for another 5 years. Now, we need to calculate the amount after another 5 years on this $8,193.08.

Again, using the same formula:

A2 = 8193.08*(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5)
Which is the same as 8193.08*(1.025)^20.

We already know (1.025)^20 ≈ 1.6386164.

So A2 = 8193.08 * 1.6386164 ≈ Let me calculate that.

First, 8000 * 1.6386164 = 13,108.9312
Then, 193.08 * 1.6386164 ≈ Let's approximate.

193.08 * 1.6386 ≈ Let's see, 193 * 1.6 is 308.8, and 193 * 0.0386 is about 7.45. So total ≈ 308.8 + 7.45 ≈ 316.25.

So total A2 ≈ 13,108.93 + 316.25 ≈ 13,425.18.

Wait, but that seems a bit rough. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 8193.08 * 1.6386164:

Let me compute 8193.08 * 1.6386164.

First, 8000 * 1.6386164 = 13,108.9312.

Then, 193.08 * 1.6386164.

193.08 * 1.6 = 308.928
193.08 * 0.0386164 ≈ Let's compute 193.08 * 0.03 = 5.7924, and 193.08 * 0.0086164 ≈ approx 1.666.

So total ≈ 5.7924 + 1.666 ≈ 7.4584.

So total for 193.08 is 308.928 + 7.4584 ≈ 316.3864.

So adding to 13,108.9312 gives 13,108.9312 + 316.3864 ≈ 13,425.3176.

So approximately $13,425.32.

So after the second 5 years, the amount is about $13,425.32.

Therefore, the total amount paid under Option 1 is the amount paid after 5 years plus the amount paid at 10 years.

Amount paid at 5 years: $8,193.08

Amount paid at 10 years: $13,425.32

Total paid: 8,193.08 + 13,425.32 = 21,618.40

Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Because the first payment is half of the 5-year amount, which is 16,386.16 / 2 = 8,193.08, and the second payment is the remaining 8,193.08 after 5 more years, which grows to about 13,425.32.

So total payments: 8,193.08 + 13,425.32 = 21,618.40.

Hmm, that seems correct. So Option 1 total is approximately $21,618.40.

**Option 2: 12% Simple Interest, 10-Year Loan**

Simple interest formula is A = P(1 + rt), where:
- P = principal ($10,000)
- r = annual interest rate (12%, so 0.12)
- t = time in years (10)

So A = 10,000 * (1 + 0.12*10) = 10,000*(1 + 1.2) = 10,000*2.2 = $22,000.

So under Option 2, Alex pays $22,000 at the end of 10 years.

**Finding the Positive Difference**

Now, the question asks for the positive difference between the total amounts paid under the two schemes.

Option 1: ~$21,618.40
Option 2: $22,000

Difference: 22,000 - 21,618.40 = $381.60.

Rounded to the nearest dollar, that's $382.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Option 1:

After 5 years, amount is 10000*(1 + 0.10/4)^(20) = 10000*(1.025)^20 ≈ 16,386.16.

Half of that is 8,193.08, which is paid. The other half, 8,193.08, is then subject to the same compounding for another 5 years, so 8,193.08*(1.025)^20 ≈ 13,425.32.

Total paid: 8,193.08 + 13,425.32 = 21,618.40.

Option 2: 10,000*(1 + 0.12*10) = 22,000.

Difference: 22,000 - 21,618.40 = 381.60, which rounds to 382.

Looking at the options, D is 382.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the exact value of (1.025)^20.

Using a calculator, (1.025)^20 is approximately 1.6386164155.

So 10,000 * 1.6386164155 = 16,386.164155.

Half is 8,193.0820775.

Then, 8,193.0820775 * 1.6386164155 = ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me compute 8,193.0820775 * 1.6386164155.

First, 8,000 * 1.6386164155 = 13,108.931324.

Then, 193.0820775 * 1.6386164155.

Let me compute 193.0820775 * 1.6386164155.

I can compute this as:

193.0820775 * 1.6386164155 ≈ Let's compute step by step.

First, 193.0820775 * 1.6 = 308.931324.

Then, 193.0820775 * 0.0386164155 ≈ Let's compute:

0.03 * 193.0820775 = 5.792462325

0.0086164155 * 193.0820775 ≈ Let's compute 0.008 * 193.0820775 = 1.54465662, and 0.0006164155 * 193.0820775 ≈ ~0.119.

So total ≈ 1.54465662 + 0.119 ≈ 1.66365662.

Adding to 5.792462325 gives ≈ 7.456118945.

So total 193.0820775 * 1.6386164155 ≈ 308.931324 + 7.456118945 ≈ 316.3874429.

So total A2 ≈ 13,108.931324 + 316.3874429 ≈ 13,425.318767.

So the total paid under Option 1 is 8,193.0820775 + 13,425.318767 ≈ 21,618.4008445, which is approximately $21,618.40.

So Option 2 is $22,000.

Difference: 22,000 - 21,618.40 = 381.60, which is $382 when rounded to the nearest dollar.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is 382, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for Option 1. Did I consider the correct compounding periods?

Yes, 10% compounded quarterly for 5 years is 20 quarters, so (1.025)^20. Then the remaining 5 years is another 20 quarters, so same factor.

So the calculations seem correct.

Therefore, the positive difference is $382, which is option D.
</think>

The total amount paid under Option 1 is approximately $21,618.40, while Option 2 totals $22,000. The positive difference is $381.60, which rounds to $382.
