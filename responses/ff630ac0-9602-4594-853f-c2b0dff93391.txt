Okay, so I've got this problem here about the diffusion coefficient of a tRNA molecule, and I need to find out how long it takes for these molecules to travel from the nucleus to the cell wall. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the diffusion coefficient D is given as 1.0 × 10^-11 m²/s. The distance the molecules need to cover is 1.0 micrometer, which is 1.0 × 10^-6 meters. Wait, I remember that diffusion equations often involve time, distance, and the coefficient D. Oh right, the formula I think is t = (x²)/(2D), where x is the distance.

Let me write that down. So, x is 1e-6 m. Squaring that gives (1e-6)^2 = 1e-12 m². Now, plug into the formula: t = (1e-12)/(2 * 1e-11). Let's compute the denominator first. 2 * 1e-11 is 2e-11. So, t = (1e-12)/(2e-11). 

Wait, when you divide exponents, you subtract them. So 1e-12 divided by 1e-11 is 0.1, because 1e-12 is 10^-12 and 1e-11 is 10^-11. 10^-12 / 10^-11 = 10^(-12+11) = 10^-1 = 0.1. But since the denominator is 2e-11, I think I should write it as (1e-12)/(2e-11) = (0.1)/(2) = 0.05 seconds. 

Wait, 0.05 is 5e-2 seconds. Let me check the options. Option C is 5.5e-2, which is close. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Wait, (1e-6)^2 is 1e-12. So numerator is 1e-12. Denominator is 2 * 1e-11 = 2e-11. So 1e-12 / 2e-11 equals (1/2) * (1e-12/1e-11) = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 s. So that's 5e-2 s, which is 0.05 s. But looking at the options, option C is 5.5e-2 and option D is 1.7e-2, etc. Hmm, my calculation gives exactly 5e-2, but I don't see that as an option. Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 5.5e-2, which is 0.055 s, and option A is 1.2e-2, which is 0.012 s. Oh wait, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, 1e-12 divided by 2e-11. Let me compute that. 1e-12 ÷ 2e-11 = (1/2) * (1e-12 / 1e-11) = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05. So that's 5e-2 s, which is 0.05 s. But none of the options have exactly 5e-2. Wait, option C is 5.5e-2, which is 0.055, very close. Did I perhaps miss a step?

Wait, another thought: the formula I used is t = x²/(2D). Is that the correct formula for the time it takes for a molecule to reach a certain distance via diffusion? I think so. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Another possibility is using the mean square displacement formula, but I think x² = 2Dt is the correct approach for the mean distance squared. So for the mean time to reach a certain distance, the formula should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's considering a sphere and using a different formula, but I don't think so. The question is about the time for molecules to reach a distance, so the formula t = x²/(2D) should apply.

Wait, maybe I confused micrometers with meters correctly. The distance is 1.0 micrometer, which is 1e-6 meters. So no mistake there.

Hmm, the calculation gives t = 0.05 s, which is 5e-2 s. Looking at the options, option C is 5.5e-2, which is 0.055 s, and option E is 4e-2. Wait, but none is exactly 5e-2. Did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me double-check.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes in diffusion problems, especially in 3D, the formula for the time to reach a certain point isn't straightforward. Oh wait, wait, I think I might have confused the formula. Because in 3D diffusion, the mean distance squared is given by <r²> = 6Dt, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think the formula I used is for 3D, where the mean squared displacement is 6Dt. Wait no, wait, maybe it's different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should be using is different. Oh, wait, I think the formula for the expected time to reach a certain distance in 3D is t = r²/(6D), because in 3D, the mean square displacement is 6Dt. So if r is the distance, then r² = 6Dt → t = r²/(6D).

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh no, I think I confused 1D and 3D. Because in 1D, the mean square displacement is 2Dt. But in 3D, it's 6Dt. So the correct formula for the time to reach a distance r would be t = r²/(6D).

Oh! So I must have used the wrong formula earlier. That's my mistake. So let me redo the calculation with this correction.

So, x is 1e-6 m. So x squared is (1e-6)^2 = 1e-12 m². Then, t = (1e-12) / (6 * 1e-11) ) = (1e-12) / (6e-11) = (1/6) * (1e-12 / 1e-11) ) = (1/6) * 0.1 = 0.016666... seconds, which is approximately 1.666...e-2 s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.7e-2 s, which matches closely. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, that makes sense because I initially used the wrong formula for 1D, but in reality, diffusion in cells is more accurately modeled in 3D. So using the 3D formula gives a time of about 1.67e-2 s, which is 0.0167 s. So the closest option is D: 1.7e-2 s.

I think that's the correct approach now. So the answer should be D.

The problem involves calculating the time it takes for tRNA molecules to diffuse from the nucleus to the cell wall, given the diffusion coefficient \( D = 1.0 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1} \) and a distance of \( x = 1.0 \, \mu\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m} \). 

To solve this, the correct formula for the time to reach a distance in 3D diffusion is \( t = \frac{x^2}{6D} \). Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{(1.0 \times 10^{-6})^2}{6 \times 1.0 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-12}}{6.0 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{1}{6} \times 0.1 = 0.0167 \, \mathrm{s} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}.
\]

This matches option D.
