Okay, so I need to figure out the effective yield of this bond. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the bond is $1,000 and it's maturing in one year. I bought it for $960. The nominal annual interest rate is 6%. Hmm, effective yield usually refers to the total return I get over the year, right?

So, the bond pays 6% interest annually. That would be 6% of $1,000, which is $60. So, I'll get $60 in interest at the end of the year. But I bought the bond for $960, so I paid $40 less than face value. Wait, no, actually, the purchase price is $960, so the difference from the face value is $40. So when the bond matures, I'll get $1,000 back. That means I gain $40 on top of the $60 interest.

So, let me add that up. The total return is the interest plus the capital gain. $60 interest + $40 capital gain = $100 total. So, I make $100 over the year from a $960 investment.

To find the effective yield, I think I need to calculate the return as a percentage of the purchase price. So, ($100 / $960) * 100. Let me do that division: 100 divided by 960. Hmm, 960 goes into 100... wait, 960 is bigger than 100, so it's less than 1. Let me compute 100 รท 960. Let's see, 960 ร 0.104 = 99.84, which is close to 100. So approximately 10.4%.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 100 divided by 960. Let me write it out:

100 รท 960 = 0.1041666... So, that's about 10.416666...%. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, that would be 10.4%.

Looking at the options, option F is 10.4%, so that must be the correct answer.

The effective yield is calculated by dividing the total return ($100) by the purchase price ($960), resulting in approximately 10.4%.

Answer: F
