Okay, so I have this problem where an impulse signal is passed through a filter, and I need to find the output. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the input signal is v(t) = I δ(t). That's the Dirac delta function, which means it's an impulse. When an impulse goes through a filter, the output should be the filter's impulse response, right? Because the filter's response to an impulse is its impulse response.

The filter's function is given as (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω). Wait, but usually, the transfer function H(ω) is represented in terms of Fourier transforms. Oh, wait, the question says the filter has this function, so I think H(jω) is (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω). Or maybe it's H(ω) as a function of ω.

Wait, I need to confirm. The transfer function H(ω) is typically defined as the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t). So if I can find h(t) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of H(ω), that would give me the impulse response.

So H(ω) = [1 - e^{-jωτ}]/(jω). Hmm. Let me see. I remember that some standard Fourier transforms might help here. For example, the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). Also, the Fourier transform of the step function u(t) is π δ(ω) + 1/(jω). But wait, actually, the Fourier transform of u(t) is π δ(ω) + 1/(jω), but the principal value is often considered as 1/(jω), ignoring the delta function.

Wait, but let's think about H(ω). It's [1 - e^{-jωτ}]/(jω). Let me split this into two terms: 1/(jω) minus e^{-jωτ}/(jω). So H(ω) = H1(ω) - H2(ω), where H1 is 1/(jω) and H2 is e^{-jωτ}/(jω).

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is... What's the time domain function whose Fourier transform is 1/(jω)? I think it's -j u(t), but wait, let me check. The Fourier transform of u(t) is π δ(ω) + 1/(jω). So if H1 is 1/(jω), then its inverse transform is u(t) multiplied by the Fourier transform's inverse. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of known transforms.

Wait, the Fourier transform of u(t) is π δ(ω) + 1/(jω) (in the distributional sense). So 1/(jω) corresponds to u(t) without the delta function, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, I remember that the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω + a) is e^{-at} u(t). So if a=0, it's 1/(jω), which would be the transform of -j u(t), because I think the transform of u(t) is π δ(ω) + 1/(jω). So maybe the inverse of 1/(jω) is u(t) multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about differentiation. The derivative of u(t) is δ(t), and the Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1. Hmm, maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, let's consider H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Let's break it into two parts:

H(ω) = 1/(jω) - e^{-jωτ}/(jω).

So, the first term is 1/(jω), and the second is e^{-jωτ}/(jω).

I think the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is -j u(t), but wait, let me double-check. The Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse transform of (1/(jω)) is u(t) minus the delta function part, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Fourier transform pairs.

Wait, I think the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). So if a=0, it's 1/(jω), which implies that the inverse transform is e^{0*t} u(t) = u(t), but scaled by something. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the inverse Fourier transform of each term separately.

First term: 1/(jω). Let me think: the Fourier transform of u(t) is π δ(ω) + 1/(jω). So the inverse transform of 1/(jω) would be u(t) minus the delta function part. But wait, that's probably getting into distributional terms, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of differentiating the delta function. Because the derivative of u(t) is δ(t), and the Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the time domain function corresponding to each term.

Let me consider H1(ω) = 1/(jω). The inverse Fourier transform of H1(ω) would be h1(t) = F^{-1}{1/(jω)}.

Wait, I think F{u(t)} = π δ(ω) + 1/(jω). So F^{-1}{1/(jω)} = u(t) - π δ(t). But I'm not entirely confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the principal value, so 1/(jω) corresponds to u(t) scaled by 1/(j), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inverse transform using integration. The inverse Fourier transform is (1/2π) ∫ H(ω) e^{jωt} dω.

So for H1(ω) = 1/(jω), the inverse transform would be (1/2π) ∫ [1/(jω)] e^{jωt} dω.

Hmm, that integral might be tricky. I think it's related to the signum function or something else.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of known Fourier pairs. Another approach: the impulse response h(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of H(ω). So H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω).

I can rewrite H(ω) as [1/(jω)] - [e^{-jωτ}/(jω)].

So h(t) = h1(t) - h2(t), where h1(t) is the inverse transform of 1/(jω), and h2(t) is the inverse transform of e^{-jωτ}/(jω).

What's h2(t)? Well, e^{-jωτ} is a time shift in the frequency domain. So the inverse transform of e^{-jωτ}/(jω) would be the time shifted version of 1/(jω). So if the inverse of 1/(jω) is some function, then shifting it by τ would give h2(t).

Wait, earlier I thought that 1/(jω) might correspond to u(t), but perhaps it's better to think that 1/(jω) is the Fourier transform of u(t) minus the delta function. Alternatively, perhaps the function is related to the sign function or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time domain function for H(ω) = 1/(jω). Let's see: the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). So if a=0, it's 1/(jω), which would correspond to e^{0} u(t) = u(t). But wait, that can't be right because the transform of u(t) also includes the delta function. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the second term, e^{-jωτ}/(jω). The inverse Fourier transform of this is e^{-jωτ} * [1/(jω)] inverse. Which would be the time shifted version of h1(t) by τ.

So if h1(t) is the inverse of 1/(jω), then h2(t) = h1(t - τ).

Putting it together, h(t) = h1(t) - h1(t - τ).

Now, what is h1(t)? As discussed, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps h1(t) is u(t) minus a delta function. Alternatively, another approach: the system's impulse response is the inverse transform of H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω).

Wait, I remember that the function (1 - e^{-jωτ}) is related to the sinc function or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the time domain function is a step function that starts at t=0 and ends at t=τ.

Wait, think about the inverse transform of (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Let me make a substitution: let’s write this as H(ω) = [1/(jω)] [1 - e^{-jωτ}].

So, H(ω) = [1/(jω)] - [e^{-jωτ}/(jω)].

Which is H1(ω) - H2(ω), as I said earlier.

Now, I think that the inverse Fourier transform of [1/(jω)] is u(t), but perhaps scaled by something. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the sign function.

Wait, wait, another approach: the transfer function H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω) can be rewritten as [e^{jωτ/2} (e^{-jωτ/2} - e^{jωτ/2}) ] / (jω) ).

Wait, that might not help immediately. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize the impulse response as a rectangular function in time.

Wait, another thought: the function (1 - e^{-jωτ}) is the Fourier transform of the rectangular function. Wait, the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width τ is something like (1 - e^{-jωτ}) multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, actually, the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse from t=-τ/2 to t=τ/2 is (sin(ωτ/2))/(ω/2)) e^{-jωτ/2}.

Hmm, that's more complicated. Maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inverse transform directly.

So H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω).

Let me compute the inverse Fourier transform:

h(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} [ (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω) ] e^{jωt} dω.

Hmm, that integral might be a bit tricky, but perhaps it can be split into two parts:

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω - ∫ (e^{-jωτ}/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω ]

So h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ I1 - I2 ], where I1 is ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω and I2 is ∫ (e^{-jωτ}/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω.

Now, I think I1 is the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω), which I'm not entirely sure of, but perhaps it's related to u(t).

Wait, perhaps I can recall that the Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse transform of 1/(jω) would be u(t) minus π δ(t). But I'm not entirely confident about that, and I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach it using integration.

Let me consider I1 = ∫_{-∞}^∞ [1/(jω)] e^{jωt} dω.

But that integral is tricky because 1/(jω) has a singularity at ω=0. Maybe I should consider the principal value.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral I1 is the same as the transform of u(t), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can take the derivative of H(ω) with respect to ω to make the integral easier. Because sometimes derivatives in the frequency domain correspond to multiplication by t in the time domain.

Wait, but perhaps integrating H(ω) directly isn't the best approach. Let me think differently.

Wait, I know that the impulse response of an RC filter is an exponential decay. But the given H(ω) doesn't look like an RC filter's transfer function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the system's response to an impulse. The impulse response h(t) is the output when the input is δ(t). So h(t) is the inverse transform of H(ω).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the inverse transform using known pairs.

Let me think again: H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω).

I can write this as H(ω) = [1/(jω)] - [e^{-jωτ}/(jω)].

So h(t) is the inverse transform of each term.

As I said earlier, I think the inverse of 1/(jω) is u(t), but perhaps scaled by something. Wait, let me check: the Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse transform of 1/(jω) would be u(t) minus the delta function part. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the inverse of 1/(jω) is -j u(t). Let me test that. The Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So if I take the inverse transform of 1/(jω), it would be u(t) minus π δ(t). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the inverse transform as (1/(jω)) corresponds to u(t) multiplied by some factor. Let me think: if I have H(ω) = 1/(jω), then h(t) = F^{-1}{1/(jω)}.

I think that the inverse transform is u(t), but perhaps without the delta function. Alternatively, perhaps it's -j u(t). Let me check: F{u(t)} = π δ(ω) + 1/(jω). So if H(ω) = 1/(jω), then h(t) would be u(t) - π δ(t). But I'm not sure if that's correct, and whether the delta function is involved here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of H(ω) as the Fourier transform of (1 - e^{-at})/a, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inverse transform using partial fractions or integration.

Wait, another approach: H(ω) can be written as (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Let me consider the case when τ approaches zero. Then H(ω) approaches (1 - 1 + jωτ)/(jω) = τ/(jω) → 0 as τ→0. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can use integration techniques. Let's compute the inverse Fourier transform:

h(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} [ (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω) ] e^{jωt} dω.

Let me split this into two integrals:

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω - ∫ (e^{-jωτ}/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω ]

= (1/(2π)) [ I1 - I2 ]

Now, I1 is the integral of (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω from -infty to infty.

I know that the integral of e^{jωt}/(jω) dω is π u(t). Wait, I think that's correct. Because the Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse transform of 1/(jω) would be u(t) if we ignore the delta function, but perhaps more accurately, it's u(t) minus the delta function. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe we can consider I1 as π u(t).

Wait, wait, perhaps I should check the integral:

I1 = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} [ e^{jωt} / (jω) ] dω.

This is the same as the Fourier transform of 1/(jω), which is known to be u(t). So I1 would be π u(t). Wait, no, because the Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse transform of 1/(jω) is u(t) because the delta function part is the transform of the impulse.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, let me consider using the fact that the integral over all ω of e^{jωt}/(jω) dω is π u(t). So I1 = π u(t).

Similarly, I2 is the integral of e^{-jωτ} e^{jωt}/(jω) dω.

Which is the same as ∫ e^{jω(t-τ)}/(jω) dω.

This is the same as I1 evaluated at t - τ, so I2 = π u(t - τ).

So putting it back into h(t):

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ π u(t) - π u(t - τ) ) ] = (1/(2π)) * π [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ) ].

Simplify: (1/2) [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ) ].

Wait, but wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the scaling. Because the inverse Fourier transform is (1/(2π)) ∫ H(ω) e^{jωt} dω. So in this case, H(ω) is [1 - e^{-jωτ}]/(jω), so when taking the inverse transform, each term would be scaled by (1/(2π)).

Wait, I think I might have missed the 1/(2π) factor in each integral.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω) = 1/(jω) - e^{-jωτ}/(jω).

The inverse transform is h(t) = F^{-1}{H(ω)}.

So,

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ ∫ e^{jωt}/(jω) dω - ∫ e^{jω(t - τ)} / (jω) dω ]

Each integral is evaluated over all ω.

Let me compute the first integral:

Integral 1: ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{jωt}/(jω) dω.

I think this is equal to π u(t). Similarly, the second integral:

Integral 2: ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{jω(t - τ)}/(jω) dω = π u(t - τ).

So,

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ π u(t) - π u(t - τ) ) ].

Simplify:

h(t) = (1/(2π)) * π [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ) ] = (1/2) [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ) ].

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the system's impulse response should be the inverse of H(ω), and if H(ω) is (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω), the time domain function should be a step that starts at t=0 and ends at t=τ, but perhaps scaled.

Wait, but the result I got is (1/2) [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ]. So that's a step that is 1/2 from t=0 to t=τ, and 0 elsewhere. But let's think about the units. If I is the amplitude of the impulse, then the output would be I times this function.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly show this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: v_o(t) = I [δ(t) * e^(-t/τ)] → Not sure.

B: v_o(t) = I [e^(-jωt) - u(t - τ)] → Hmm, complex exponential minus step.

C: v_o(t) = I [1 - e^(-jωτ)] → Looks like H(ω), but in time domain.

D: v_o(t) = I [u(t) / (u(t) + u(t - τ))] → Not sure, seems more like a logical expression.

E: v_o(t) = I [u(t) / u(t - 	au)] → Again, not sure.

F: v_o(t) = I [u(t) + u(t - 	au)] → Sum of steps, but doesn't match.

G: v_o(t) = I [u(t) * u(t - 	au)] → Product of steps, which would be a rectangular pulse from 0 to τ.

H: v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - 	au)] → This is a rectangular pulse from 0 to τ, because u(t) is 1 for t>0, and u(t-τ) is 1 for t>τ. So their difference is 1 between 0 and τ, 0 elsewhere.

Wait, that's exactly what I got for h(t) multiplied by I. Because h(t) is (1/2) [u(t) - u(t - τ)], but wait, in the calculation, I got (1/2) [ ... ], but looking at the options, option H is [u(t) - u(t - τ)], which is twice what I have. So perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse Fourier transform. Let me double-check the calculation.

H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω).

Inverse transform h(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫_{-∞}^∞ [ (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω) ] e^{jωt} dω.

Split into two terms:

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω - ∫ (e^{-jωτ}/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω ]

= (1/(2π)) [ I1 - I2 ]

As before, I1 = ∫ e^{jωt}/(jω) dω = π u(t), and I2 = ∫ e^{jω(t - τ)}/(jω) dω = π u(t - τ).

So,

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ π u(t) - π u(t - τ) ) ] = (1/2) [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

So the impulse response h(t) is (1/2) [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

But looking at the options, option H is [u(t) - u(t - τ)], which is twice what I have. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct scaling is that the inverse Fourier transform is (1/(2π)) times the integral. Let me check: the inverse Fourier transform formula is h(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫ H(ω) e^{jωt} dω.

In this case, H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). So the integral becomes:

∫ [ (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω) ] e^{jωt} dω = ∫ [ e^{jωt}/(jω) - e^{jω(t-τ)}/(jω) ] dω.

Which is I1 - I2.

I1 = ∫ e^{jωt}/(jω) dω = π u(t) (from earlier).

I2 = ∫ e^{jω(t-τ)}/(jω) dω = π u(t - τ).

So,

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ π u(t) - π u(t - τ) ) ] = (1/2) [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ].

So the impulse response is (1/2)[u(t) - u(t - τ)].

But the output v_o(t) is I times h(t), since the input is I δ(t).

So v_o(t) = I * (1/2) [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

But looking at the options, none have a factor of 1/2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is u(t), not (1/2) u(t). Let me check.

Wait, I think I might have confused the scaling factors. Let me think again.

The Fourier transform pair for u(t) is:

F{u(t)} = (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω).

So, F^{-1}{1/(jω)} = u(t) - π δ(t).

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can consider that the inverse of 1/(jω) is u(t), ignoring the delta function, since it's part of the distribution and the main part is the step function.

So, if I1 is ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω = π u(t).

Similarly, I2 = π u(t - τ).

So,

h(t) = (1/(2π)) [ π u(t) - π u(t - τ) ) ] = (1/2) [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ].

But none of the options have a 1/2 factor. So perhaps the correct option is H, which is [u(t) - u(t - τ)], ignoring the factor, but that would imply that the impulse response is twice as large. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct impulse response is [u(t) - u(t - τ)], which is option H. Let me see.

If the output is v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - τ)], that would make sense if the impulse response is indeed [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

But according to my calculation, it's (1/2) of that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling.

Wait, perhaps I should consult a table of Fourier transforms to confirm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the filter's behavior. The transfer function H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Let me evaluate H(ω) at ω=0. H(0) would be (1 - 1)/0 → 0/0, which is indeterminate, but using L’Hospital’s rule, the limit as ω→0 is (d/dω (1 - e^{-jωτ})) / (d/dω (jω)) evaluated at ω=0.

The derivative of numerator: jτ e^{-jωτ} → jτ at ω=0.

Denominator derivative: j.

So H(0) = (jτ) / j = τ.

So the DC gain is τ, which suggests that the impulse response is scaled by τ.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm.

Wait, if H(0) is τ, then the impulse response h(0) would be τ, because the DC gain is the value of h(0) for an LTI system.

But according to my earlier calculation, h(t) is (1/2)[u(t) - u(t-τ)], which would have h(0) as (1/2)(1 - 0) = 1/2. But that's not matching the DC gain τ. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω) = [ (e^{jωτ/2} - e^{-jωτ/2}) ] / (jω e^{jωτ/2}) ) → [ 2j sin(ωτ/2) ] / (jω e^{jωτ/2} ) ) → (2 sin(ωτ/2)) / (ω e^{jωτ/2} ).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(ω) as (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω) = [ (1 - e^{-jωτ}) e^{jωτ/2} ] / (jω e^{jωτ/2} ) ) = [ e^{jωτ/2} - e^{jωτ/2} e^{-jωτ} ] / (jω e^{jωτ/2} ) ).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Another approach: perhaps the impulse response is the time integral of the filter's response to an exponential input. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the system is a low-pass filter. The transfer function H(ω) approaches (1)/(jω) as τ becomes large, which suggests a low-pass behavior, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the impulse response h(t) is a rectangular pulse of duration τ. So h(t) = u(t) - u(t - τ). That would make the output v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

Looking at the options, that's option H.

So, perhaps the correct answer is H.
</think>

The input signal is an impulse function, \( v(t) = I\delta(t) \), and the filter's transfer function is \( H(\omega) = \frac{1 - e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \). The output of the filter is the impulse response of the system, which is the inverse Fourier transform of \( H(\omega) \).

To find the impulse response \( h(t) \), we split \( H(\omega) \) into two terms: \( \frac{1}{j\omega} \) and \( \frac{e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \). The inverse Fourier transform of \( \frac{1}{j\omega} \) is \( u(t) \), and the inverse Fourier transform of \( \frac{e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \) is \( u(t - \tau) \). Therefore, the impulse response is:

\[
h(t) = u(t) - u(t - \tau).
\]

This represents a rectangular pulse that is 1 for \( 0 \leq t < \tau \) and 0 otherwise. The output of the filter, \( v_o(t) \), is the impulse response scaled by \( I \), giving:

\[
v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - \tau)].
\]

Among the options provided, this matches option H.

Answer: H
