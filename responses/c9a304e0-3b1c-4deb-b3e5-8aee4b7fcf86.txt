Okay, so I have this question about the global prevalence of untreated dental caries. I'm not super familiar with dental statistics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that dental caries, which are cavities, are pretty common worldwide. They're a big issue because they can lead to pain, infections, and other health problems if left untreated. But I'm not sure exactly how widespread untreated cases are.

I think about different regions. In developed countries, people usually have better access to dental care, so maybe the rate of untreated caries is lower there. But in developing countries, especially those with limited healthcare resources, untreated dental caries might be more prevalent. So the global average could be somewhere in the middle.

I've heard before that untreated dental caries affect a significant portion of the population. Maybe like half? Or perhaps even more. I'm trying to recall any studies or reports I've come across. Oh, I think the World Health Organization (WHO) has some data on this. I remember reading that globally, a substantial number of people have untreated dental caries, but I can't recall the exact percentage.

Looking at the options, I see options like 30%, 10%, 70%, 60%, etc. Let me think again. If untreated caries are a major public health issue, it's probably not as low as 10% or 20%. Those seem too low. On the higher end, 90% or 80% seems too high, but maybe not impossible in some regions.

I think the WHO reports that untreated dental caries are highly prevalent. Maybe around 60-70% globally? Or perhaps even higher. Another thought: I've heard that in some developing countries, the rate is over 80%, but globally averaged, it might be around 60% or so.

Wait, I'm trying to remember if it's more than half. If I had to guess, I might say it's over 50%. So looking at the options, F is 50%, which is exactly half. But I'm not sure if it's higher than that. Maybe 60% or 70%? Alternatively, some sources might say that a large majority have untreated caries, perhaps 70% is the estimate.

Alternatively, I might be confusing this with the prevalence of dental caries in general, not just untreated ones. If most caries are treated, then untreated would be lower. But I think untreated is still a significant number.

Another angle: I remember reading that in many low-income countries, the rate of untreated caries is extremely high, like over 80%. But when you average across all countries, including high-income ones where treatment rates are higher, the global average might be around 60% or so.

Wait, I think I've heard the figure 60% before. So maybe the correct answer is D: 60%.

The estimated global prevalence of untreated dental caries is around 60%. This is based on the understanding that untreated dental caries are a significant public health issue, particularly in developing countries, where access to dental care is limited. While treatment rates are higher in developed countries, the global average remains substantial, with 60% being a commonly cited figure.

Answer: D
