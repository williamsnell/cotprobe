Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about utilitarianism, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking what Ross claims is the essential defect of utilitarianism. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Ross was a philosopher who criticized various ethical theories, including utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is all about maximizing overall happiness or utility, right? So, the idea is that the right action is the one that leads to the greatest good for the greatest number. But Ross didn't think it was all that great.

I think Ross had a few issues with utilitarianism. One point I recall is that he argued against the idea that consequences are the only thing that matter. He believed that there are other moral principles that are important in themselves, like truth-telling or keeping promises, regardless of the outcome. So, if utilitarianism only focuses on the outcomes, it might ignore these other principles.

Looking at the options, let's go one by one. Option A says "the significance of moral intentions." Hmm, I'm not sure. Utilitarianism does consider intentions because they can affect outcomes, but maybe Ross's point was more about the consequences themselves rather than intentions. Not sure yet.

Option B is "epistemological responsibility." That sounds more like a concern with knowledge and justification. I don't think that's the main point Ross was making about utilitarianism.

Option C: "the role of virtue in morality." Virtue ethics focuses on character and virtues, while utilitarianism is about consequences. I'm not sure if Ross criticized utilitarianism for ignoring virtue, but I think he might have. But wait, isn't the main criticism more about other things?

Option D: "the value of pleasure." Well, utilitarianism does value pleasure as the primary good, so that doesn't make sense as a defect.

Option E: "the importance of individual rights." Some critics say utilitarianism can override individual rights if it leads to greater good, but I'm not sure if that's Ross's main point.

Option F: "the potential consequences of actions." Wait, that seems contradictory because utilitarianism is all about consequences. So this can't be right.

Option G: "the concept of justice." Maybe, but I think Ross's criticism was more about the role of other moral principles beyond consequences.

Option H: "moral obligations." Similar to intentions, perhaps, but not sure.

Option I: "the personal character of duty." This sounds a bit like virtue ethics again, but I'm not certain.

Option J: "autonomy." That's more of a Kantian concern, where the focus is on the moral law and autonomy of the will. Maybe not Ross's main point.

Wait, I think I remember that Ross's key criticism was that utilitarianism fails to consider other prima facie duties beyond consequences. He believed in multiple, irreducible prima facie duties like non-maleficence, beneficence, justice, etc. So, if utilitarianism only looks at the consequences, it might override these duties when it's not appropriate.

Looking back at the options, option C is about the role of virtue. But Ross's point was more about multiple moral principles, not necessarily virtues. So maybe C isn't it.

Alternatively, option A is about moral intentions. But I think Ross's issue was more about the structure of moral theory, not just intentions.

Wait, the question is about the essential defect. So, maybe the answer is that utilitarianism ignores the role of virtue. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's that it ignores other moral principles beyond consequences.

Wait, another angle: Ross was a pluralist. He argued that there are several prima facie duties that can't be reduced to consequences. So, utilitarianism, which focuses solely on consequences, ignores these other duties. So, the essential defect is that it ignores these other principles, which are part of virtue or personal character.

Looking again, option I is "the personal character of duty." That might be it. Because Ross emphasizes that duties have a personal aspect, and utilitarianism neglects that by focusing only on outcomes.

Alternatively, option C is about the role of virtue. So, maybe the answer is either C or I. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the correct answer is that Ross claimed utilitarianism ignores the role of virtue in morality. So, option C. Because he thought that virtues like honesty and promise-keeping are important in themselves, regardless of the consequences.

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed it up. Let me think again. Ross's main argument was against the idea that only consequences matter. He believed that there are intrinsic duties, like not lying, which have their own moral weight. So, utilitarianism fails because it doesn't account for these other duties, which are part of a broader moral framework, possibly related to virtue.

So, looking at the options, "the role of virtue in morality" is option C. That might be the right answer because Ross emphasized that there are multiple moral principles that can't be reduced to just consequences, which ties into the idea of virtue.

Alternatively, if the answer is about the personal character of duty, that's option I. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that utilitarianism only considers consequences, so it ignores other aspects like duties, justice, etc. So, the essential defect is that it ignores these other principles, which are part of the personal character of duty. So, option I might be correct.

But I'm still not entirely sure. I think I need to recall: Ross's critique was that utilitarianism doesn't recognize other duties beyond consequences. So, the answer is that it ignores the role of virtue, which is option C.

Wait, no. Because virtue ethics is a different approach, focusing on the character. Ross's point was more about there being multiple duties, not necessarily that it's about virtue. So, perhaps the answer is C: the role of virtue in morality.

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is A: the significance of moral intentions. Because Ross might have argued that intentions matter, but I'm not certain.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember: Ross's critique is that utilitarianism is too focused on consequences and doesn't account for other aspects like duties, justice, and so on. So, the essential defect is that it ignores other moral principles, which are part of the personal character of duty, perhaps.

So, I think the answer is I: the personal character of duty. Because Ross thought that duties have a personal aspect, and utilitarianism overlooks that by focusing solely on outcomes.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another way: the question is about what Ross says is the essential defect. From what I remember, Ross's main criticism is that utilitarianism doesn't recognize the intrinsic value of certain actions, like keeping a promise, which have moral worth beyond their consequences. So, it's that it ignores the role of virtue or the intrinsic duties.

So, perhaps the answer is C: the role of virtue in morality.

Alternatively, I'm mixing up Ross with other philosophers. Maybe the correct answer is A: the significance of moral intentions. Because Ross might have thought that intentions are important for moral evaluation, and utilitarianism doesn't consider them enough.

Wait, no. Utilitarianism does consider intentions insofar as they affect outcomes, but Ross's point was more about the structure of moral theory, not just intentions.

I think I'm stuck between C and I. But I think the correct answer is that Ross said utilitarianism ignores the role of virtue, so option C.
</think>

Ross criticized utilitarianism for its failure to account for multiple moral principles beyond consequences, such as duties and justice. He emphasized that utilitarianism overlooks the intrinsic value of certain actions, like keeping promises, which have moral worth regardless of outcomes. This suggests that Ross believed utilitarianism neglects the role of virtue in morality, as it does not adequately consider the broader moral framework that virtue ethics provides. Therefore, the essential defect Ross identified is that utilitarianism ignores the role of virtue in morality.

Answer: C
