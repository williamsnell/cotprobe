Okay, so I've got this math problem here: find the quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on dividing decimals, but I remember that there's a trick to make it easier. Maybe I can convert the decimals into whole numbers to simplify the division.

First, I need to figure out how to eliminate the decimals in both the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is 5.04, which has two decimal places, and the denominator is 0.7, which has one decimal place. To get rid of the decimals, I should multiply both numbers by 10 to the power of the highest number of decimal places. In this case, the highest is two, so I'll multiply both by 100.

Multiplying 5.04 by 100 gives me 504. And multiplying 0.7 by 100 gives me 70. Now the problem becomes 504 divided by 70. That seems more manageable.

So, 504 รท 70. Let me do that division. I know that 70 times 7 is 490 because 7 times 7 is 49, and adding a zero gives 490. Subtracting 490 from 504 leaves 14. Now, 70 goes into 14 zero times, but wait, that's not right. Oh, I think I made a mistake there. Let me try that again.

Wait, 70 times 7 is 490, right. So 504 minus 490 is 14. Then, I can add a decimal point and a zero to bring down the 14, making it 140. Now, 70 goes into 140 exactly 2 times. So, putting it together, 7 times 70 is 490, and then 2 times 70 is 140. So, 7 and 2, making the quotient 7.2.

Wait, that makes sense because 70 times 7.2 would be 504. Let me check: 70 times 7 is 490, and 70 times 0.2 is 14. So 490 plus 14 is indeed 504. So, 504 รท 70 equals 7.2.

Therefore, the original problem, 5.04 รท 0.7, should equal 7.2. Looking at the options, option C is 7.2. That must be the correct answer.

I think I got it right. But just to be sure, maybe I can try another method. Let's see, 0.7 times what equals 5.04? If I multiply 0.7 by 7, I get 4.9. To get to 5.04, I need a little more than 7. Let me calculate 0.7 times 7.2. 0.7 times 7 is 4.9, and 0.7 times 0.2 is 0.14. Adding those together gives 5.04. Yep, that checks out. So, definitely, the answer is 7.2.

The quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7 is 7.2, which corresponds to option C.
