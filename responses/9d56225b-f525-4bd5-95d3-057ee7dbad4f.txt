Okay, so I have this equation x⁴ + 2x³ + x = 10, and I need to find the sum of its four roots using the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm, wait a minute. I remember that for polynomials, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas, right? Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. So for a quartic equation like this, which is a fourth-degree polynomial, the sum of the roots should be equal to -b/a, where b is the coefficient of x³ and a is the coefficient of x⁴.

Looking at the given equation, it's written as x⁴ + 2x³ + x -10 = 0. So in standard form, the coefficients are: a=1 for x⁴, b=2 for x³, and then the other terms are lower degrees. So according to Vieta's, the sum of the roots is -b/a, which is -2/1 = -2. So the sum should be -2.0, which is option E.

But wait, the question specifically mentions using the Newton-Raphson method. Does that change anything? Newton-Raphson is a numerical method for finding roots, but I'm not sure how that would help find the sum of the roots. Usually, Newton-Raphson is used to find individual roots by approximation, but calculating all four roots and then adding them up would be time-consuming and probably not the intended approach here.

I think the key point is that Vieta's formula gives the sum directly without needing to find each root individually. So regardless of the method mentioned (Newton-Raphson), the sum can be found using Vieta's. Therefore, the correct answer should be E: -2.0.

The sum of the roots of the equation can be directly determined using Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to the sum and products of its roots. For the given quartic equation x⁴ + 2x³ + x - 10 = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a, where b is the coefficient of x³ (which is 2) and a is the coefficient of x⁴ (which is 1). Thus, the sum is -2/1 = -2.0. 

While the Newton-Raphson method is a numerical technique for finding roots, it is unnecessary here since Vieta's formulas provide the sum directly.

Answer: E
