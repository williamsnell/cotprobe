Okay, so I have this question about Kant's philosophy, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking about what determines the moral worth of an action according to Kant. The options are A, B, C, and D, which include the agent's character, consequences, the maxim, or all of the above.

I remember that Immanuel Kant was a big name in moral philosophy, especially with his deontological theories. I think he talked a lot about duties and rules, right? So, I'm pretty sure he didn't focus on the consequences of actions like utilitarians do. Utilitarianism is all about the outcomes, so B might not be the right choice here.

Then there's the idea of the maxim. From what I recall, Kant discussed the idea that actions are morally evaluated based on the maxims or principles that guide them. The maxim is like the underlying reason someone has for acting. So, if someone does something because it's their duty, that's more in line with Kant's view. The action's moral worth depends on whether the maxim aligns with the moral law, not just the outcome. So that makes C a strong candidate.

Wait, but what about the agent's character? I thought that in Kantian ethics, it's more about the intention and the principle behind the action rather than the person's overall character. So the moral worth isn't just about whether the person is good or has good character, but about the principle they follow. So A might not be correct because it's more about the maxim than the agent's character.

Putting this together, the moral worth depends on the maxim, not the consequences or the agent's character. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me think again. Does it ever involve the agent's character? Hmm, maybe not because Kant emphasizes the principle itself, not the person's inherent goodness. So yeah, I think C is the right choice.

The correct answer is C: the maxim that is acted on. Kant's deontological theory emphasizes that the moral worth of an action is determined by the principle or maxim that guides it, not by the agent's character or the consequences of the action.

Answer: C
