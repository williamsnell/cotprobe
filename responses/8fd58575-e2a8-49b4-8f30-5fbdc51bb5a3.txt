Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: A population undergoes a shift where the really tall and really short individuals decrease in relative frequency compared to those of medium size because of a change in resource availability. They're asking which biological concept this is an example of.

The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think about each option and what they mean.

So first, I remember that selection in biology refers to different ways natural selection can act on a population. There are a few types I know, like directional, stabilizing, and disruptive selection. There's also genetic drift, which is a random change, and things like founder effect and bottleneck effect, which are related to population genetics.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Convergent evolution. I think that's when different species independently evolve similar traits because of similar environments or selection pressures. But the question is about a single population, not different species. So probably not A.

Option B: Stabilizing selection. This is when the middle variation in a trait is favored, leading to a reduction in the extremes. So if tall and short are decreasing, and medium is increasing, that sounds like stabilizing selection. That fits the scenario described.

Option C: Genetic drift. That's random changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations. But the question mentions a change due to resource availability, which is a selective pressure, so it's more about selection than random drift. So probably not C.

Option D: Disruptive selection. This is when the extremes are favored, so the population splits into two or more types. But in the question, the extremes are decreasing, so D seems opposite of what's happening.

Option E: Directional selection. This is when a particular direction of trait is favored, like getting taller or stronger. If the environment changes and requires a certain trait, say being medium is better, that's not directional because it's not a single direction but a middle ground. So E might not fit.

Option F: Sympatric speciation. That's when a new species forms within the same geographic area, usually due to reproductive isolation. Not related to changes in trait frequencies in a population, so F is probably not the answer.

Option G: Bottleneck effect. This happens when a population's size is drastically reduced, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. The question doesn't mention a population crash or loss of diversity, just a shift in trait frequencies due to resources. So G is likely not it.

Option H: Adaptive radiation. That's when a species rapidly diversifies into many forms, often due to ecological opportunities. Again, the question is about a single population changing, not a radiation into multiple species. So H is probably not the case.

Option I: Founder effect. This occurs when a small group starts a new population, leading to reduced genetic diversity. The question doesn't mention a new group or a founder; it's more about selection based on resources. So I probably isn't the answer.

Option J: Sexual selection. This is about traits that improve mating success, like peacocks' tails. The question is about resource availability, not mating, so J doesn't fit.

Putting it all together, the situation described is where the extremes (tall and short) are less fit, and the medium becomes more common. That's exactly what stabilizing selection is. So the answer should be B.

The scenario described involves a population where the relative frequency of extreme traits (tall and short) decreases while the medium-sized individuals increase, due to a change in resource availability. This is indicative of stabilizing selection, where the middle range of a trait is favored, reducing the variation at the extremes.

Answer: B
