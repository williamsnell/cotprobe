Okay, I need to figure out what cultural relativity means according to Benedict in 1934. I remember that cultural relativity is a concept in anthropology. From what I've studied, it's about understanding cultural practices from their own perspective rather than judging them by one's own culture's standards. Benedict, I think, was a key figure in this. She wrote about it in her book "Patterns of Culture."

Looking at the options, option F says it's the belief that human behavior can only be understood within its cultural context. That sounds familiar. Cultural relativism would involve not imposing our values on others but seeing things through their cultural lens.

Option A talks about comparing without bias. While that's related, I think F gets closer to the idea of understanding behavior within context. Option I says all cultures are equal, which might be a consequence of relativism, but not exactly the definition.

Option B is ethnocentrism, which is the opposite of relativity. C is about economics, which doesn't fit. D is about genetics, which isn't related. E is about studying differences, which is broader. G is about adaptation, H about transmission through language, and J is cultural assimilation. None of these fit the definition of cultural relativity.

So, I think the correct answer is F. It captures the essence of understanding behavior within its cultural environment, which aligns with Benedict's view.
