Source 1
If then by the Use of Machines, the Manufacture of Cotton, an Article which we import, and are supplied with from other Countries, and which can everywhere be procured on equal Terms, has met with such amazing Success, may not greater Advantages be reasonably expected from cultivating to the utmost the Manufacture of Wool, the Produce of our own Island, an Article in Demand in all Countries, almost the universal Clothing of Mankind?
In the Manufacture of Woollens, the Scribbling Mill, the Spinning Frame, and the Fly Shuttle, have reduced manual Labour nearly One third, and each of them at its-first Introduction carried an Alarm to the Work People, yet each has contributed to advance the Wages and to increase the Trade, so that if an Attempt was now made to deprive us of the Use of them, there is no Doubt, but every Person engaged in the Business, would exert himself to defend them.
—Statement by the Cloth Merchants of Leeds, 1791

Come, cropper lads of high renown,
Who love to drink good ale that's brown,
And strike each haughty tyrant down,
With hatchet, pike, and gun!
Oh, the cropper lads for me,
The gallant lads for me,
Who with lusty stroke,
The shear frames broke,
The cropper lads for me!
What though the specials still advance,
And soldiers nightly round us prance;
The cropper lads still lead the dance,
With hatchet, pike, and gun!
Oh, the cropper lads for me,
The gallant lads for me,
Who with lusty stroke
The shear frames broke,
The cropper lads for me!
—Luddite Song, The Cropper's Song, c. 1812

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which economic theory Source 1 is referencing. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is asking which economic theory is being supported by Source 1 in its argument for expanding the use of machines in wool manufacturing.

Looking at Source 1, it's a statement from cloth merchants in Leeds in 1791. They mention the success of using machines like the scribbling mill, spinning frame, and fly shuttle. These machines reduced manual labor by nearly a third and, despite initial fears from workers, led to increased wages and trade. They argue that removing these machines now would be met with resistance from those in the business.

So, the main point here is about the benefits of using machinery to increase efficiency and productivity. They're advocating for the continued use of these machines because they've improved both wages and trade. This seems to align with an economic theory that supports industrial progress, technological advancement, and the expansion of manufacturing capabilities.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Laissez-faire capitalism – This is about minimal government interference, letting the market regulate itself. Source 1 doesn't directly talk about government policies or non-interference; it's more about the benefits of machinery.

B: Protectionism – This involves tariffs and protecting domestic industries. Source 1 doesn't mention anything about protectionist policies; it's more about the efficiency gains from machines.

C: Bullionism – Concerned with accumulating gold and silver. Not relevant here.

D: Socialism – Opposes private ownership; Source 1 supports business interests, so probably not.

E: Monetarism – Focuses on money supply and banking policies. Not directly related.

F: Marxism – Critiques capitalism and private property. Again, Source 1 is supportive of the industry's expansion through machines, not against it.

G: Industrialization – This is the process of developing industries, especially with machines. Source 1 directly talks about the use of machines and their benefits, so this seems relevant.

H: Mercantilism – Focuses on wealth through trade surplus. Source 1 is about manufacturing efficiency, not trade balances.

I: Free Trade – About removing trade barriers. The source doesn't discuss trade policies with other countries; it's more about internal manufacturing.

J: Keynesian economics – Involves government intervention in the economy. Source 1 supports letting the market (machines) do their work without necessarily mentioning government action.

So, the key here is that Source 1 is promoting the use of machinery to boost manufacturing, which is a hallmark of industrialization. They're showing that machines lead to higher productivity and better wages, which fits the narrative of industrialization. The other options don't align as closely with the specific focus on machines and manufacturing progress.

The source discusses the benefits of machinery in manufacturing, particularly in increasing efficiency and productivity, which aligns with the concept of industrialization.
