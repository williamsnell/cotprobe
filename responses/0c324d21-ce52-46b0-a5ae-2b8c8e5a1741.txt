Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A particle moves with constant velocity v along the curve r = k(1 + cosθ), which is a cardioid. We need to find the radial component of the acceleration, which is written as a · er. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in polar coordinates, the acceleration vector can be broken down into radial and tangential components. The formula for acceleration in polar coordinates is something like a = r'' e_r + (2 r' θ') e_θ + r (θ'')² e_r - r (θ')² e_θ. Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Alternatively, I think the general expression for acceleration in polar coordinates is:

a = (d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)²) e_r + (r d²θ/dt² + 2 dr/dt dθ/dt) e_θ.

Yes, that sounds right. So, the radial component of acceleration is d²r/dt² minus r times (dθ/dt) squared. And the tangential component is the other part, but we don't need that here.

But wait, in this problem, the particle is moving with constant velocity v. Hmm, so if velocity is constant, that usually means acceleration is zero. But wait, velocity is a vector, so having constant magnitude doesn't necessarily mean acceleration is zero. Oh, because acceleration depends on the change in velocity, which is the vector sum of the tangential and centripetal components.

Wait, no, wait. If the speed is constant, then the acceleration should only have a centripetal component, which is v squared over the radius. But wait, the particle is moving along a cardioid, and it's moving with constant velocity. Wait, but velocity being constant would imply that the acceleration is zero, but that doesn't seem right because the path is curved.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. The problem says "v = const," which I think refers to the magnitude of the velocity being constant. So the speed is constant, but the direction is changing because the path is curved. So the acceleration would be the centripetal acceleration, which is v squared divided by the radius of curvature at each point. But wait, in polar coordinates, the acceleration components are as I wrote above.

Alternatively, perhaps since the speed is constant, the only acceleration is the centripetal acceleration. But let me think about this again.

Wait, the problem is asking for the radial component of the acceleration, a · er. So using the formula I wrote earlier, a · er would be d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2.

But if the speed is constant, then the radial component of velocity is dr/dt, and the tangential component is r dθ/dt. The speed v is sqrt( (dr/dt)^2 + (r dθ/dt)^2 ). Since v is constant, the time derivatives of these terms would relate to the acceleration.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, let's write down the position in polar coordinates:

r(θ) = k(1 + cosθ).

But wait, the particle is moving along this curve, but θ is a function of time. So r is a function of θ, which is a function of time. So we can write r(t) = k(1 + cosθ(t)).

Now, since the particle is moving with constant velocity v, I think that means that the speed is constant. So the speed v is given by the magnitude of the velocity vector.

In polar coordinates, the velocity components are:

v_r = dr/dt,

v_θ = r dθ/dt.

So the speed is v = sqrt( (dr/dt)^2 + (r dθ/dt)^2 ) = constant.

But the problem says v is constant, so that's correct.

Now, I need to find the acceleration components. The radial component of acceleration is a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2.

Hmm, but since the speed is constant, perhaps I can find expressions for these derivatives.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each term step by step.

First, find dr/dt.

r = k(1 + cosθ), so dr/dt = -k sinθ dθ/dt.

Similarly, v = sqrt( (dr/dt)^2 + (r dθ/dt)^2 ) = v.

Let me square both sides:

v^2 = (dr/dt)^2 + (r dθ/dt)^2.

Substituting dr/dt from above:

v^2 = [k^2 sin^2θ (dθ/dt)^2] + [k^2 (1 + cosθ)^2 (dθ/dt)^2].

Factor out k^2 (dθ/dt)^2:

v^2 = k^2 (dθ/dt)^2 [sin^2θ + (1 + cosθ)^2].

Let me compute the term inside the brackets:

sin^2θ + (1 + cosθ)^2 = sin^2θ + 1 + 2cosθ + cos^2θ.

But sin^2θ + cos^2θ = 1, so this becomes 1 + 1 + 2cosθ = 2 + 2cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ).

So v^2 = k^2 (dθ/dt)^2 * 2(1 + cosθ).

So, (dθ/dt)^2 = v^2 / (2 k^2 (1 + cosθ)).

Hmm, so dθ/dt = v / (k sqrt(2(1 + cosθ))).

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the acceleration in terms of the given r and θ.

We know that a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2.

We can compute d²r/dt² by differentiating dr/dt.

We have dr/dt = -k sinθ dθ/dt.

So d²r/dt² = -k [cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 + sinθ d²θ/dt² ].

So,

a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2

= [ -k cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt² ] - [k(1 + cosθ)] (dθ/dt)^2.

Let me expand this:

= -k cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt² - k (1 + cosθ) (dθ/dt)^2.

Combine the terms with (dθ/dt)^2:

= [ -k cosθ - k (1 + cosθ) ] (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

Simplify the coefficients:

- k cosθ - k - k cosθ = -k (2 cosθ + 1).

So,

a_r = -k (2 cosθ + 1) (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, since the speed v is constant, the acceleration is purely centripetal, which in polar coordinates would be a = -v² / r e_r, but wait, that's the centripetal acceleration. But wait, in polar coordinates, the radial acceleration component is a_r = -v² / r, right? Because centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center, which is the negative radial direction in polar coordinates.

Wait, but in that case, a_r would be -v² / r. But let me think again.

Wait, the centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r towards the center, so in polar coordinates, it's a = -v² / r e_r. So the radial component a_r would be -v² / r.

But wait, in our case, r is k(1 + cosθ), so a_r would be -v² / [k(1 + cosθ)].

But let's check if this makes sense. Because the acceleration in the radial direction is indeed the centripetal component, which is v squared over the radius of curvature, but in this case, the radius is r = k(1 + cosθ).

But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct because the particle is moving along the cardioid, so maybe the curvature is different. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, but the general expression for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, where r is the radius of curvature. So in this case, r is the position r(θ), which is k(1 + cosθ). So a_r should be -v² / r, which is -v² / [k(1 + cosθ)].

But looking at the options, they are all in terms of v squared over k. So perhaps we can express a_r as -v²/(k(1 + cosθ)).

Wait, but in the options, none of them have a 1 + cosθ in the denominator. They are all just multiples of v²/k. So maybe there's something wrong with my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that a_r is simply -v² / r. Because in the case of uniform circular motion, that's correct, but here, the path is a cardioid, which is not a circle. So maybe the expression is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should go back to the expression for a_r that I derived earlier, which is a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2.

Wait, but perhaps I can express d²r/dt² in terms of θ.

We have r = k(1 + cosθ).

So, dr/dt = -k sinθ dθ/dt.

d²r/dt² = -k [ cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 + sinθ d²θ/dt² ].

So, a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2.

Substituting:

a_r = [ -k cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt² ] - [k(1 + cosθ)] (dθ/dt)^2.

= -k cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt² - k (1 + cosθ) (dθ/dt)^2.

Now, combining the terms with (dθ/dt)^2:

= [ -k cosθ - k (1 + cosθ) ] (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

= [ -k cosθ - k - k cosθ ] (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

= -k (2 cosθ + 1) (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can find expressions for dθ/dt and d²θ/dt² in terms of v and r.

From earlier, we had:

v^2 = [k^2 (dθ/dt)^2] [2(1 + cosθ)].

So,

(dθ/dt)^2 = v^2 / [2 k^2 (1 + cosθ)].

Similarly, perhaps we can find d²θ/dt².

Wait, taking the time derivative of (dθ/dt):

d²θ/dt² = d/dt [dθ/dt].

We can write dθ/dt as [v] / [k sqrt(2(1 + cosθ))].

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe instead, we can find an expression for d²θ/dt² in terms of v and θ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find d²θ/dt² in terms of (dθ/dt) and other terms.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

Since the particle is moving with constant speed v along the cardioid, the acceleration is purely centripetal, so the radial component of acceleration is a_r = -v² / r.

But as I thought earlier, r is k(1 + cosθ), so a_r = -v² / [k(1 + cosθ)].

But looking at the options, the answer is supposed to be in terms of v²/k multiplied by some coefficient. So perhaps I can express 1/(1 + cosθ) in terms of other variables.

Wait, but I don't know θ as a function of time, so perhaps I should express this differently.

Wait, maybe I should use the relation between velocity and the derivatives.

We have v = dr/dt e_r + r dθ/dt e_θ.

But since the speed is constant, the acceleration is purely centripetal, so a = -v² e_r / r.

So, a_r = -v² / r.

But r = k(1 + cosθ), so a_r = -v² / [k(1 + cosθ)].

But again, the options don't seem to have this form. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that a_r is just -v² / r. Maybe I should compute it using the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute a_r using the formula a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2.

We can compute each term separately.

We have:

r = k(1 + cosθ),

so,

dr/dt = -k sinθ dθ/dt,

d²r/dt² = -k [ cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 + sinθ d²θ/dt² ].

We also have v = sqrt( (dr/dt)^2 + (r dθ/dt)^2 ) = v.

So,

v^2 = [k^2 sin^2θ (dθ/dt)^2] + [k^2 (1 + cosθ)^2 (dθ/dt)^2].

Factor out k^2 (dθ/dt)^2:

v^2 = k^2 (dθ/dt)^2 [ sin^2θ + (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

As before, simplifying the bracket:

sin^2θ + (1 + cosθ)^2 = 2(1 + cosθ).

So,

v^2 = 2 k^2 (1 + cosθ) (dθ/dt)^2.

Thus,

(dθ/dt)^2 = v^2 / [2 k^2 (1 + cosθ)].

Now, going back to a_r:

a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2.

= [ -k cosθ (dθ/dt)^2 - k sinθ d²θ/dt² ] - [ k(1 + cosθ) (dθ/dt)^2 ].

Let me factor out -k (dθ/dt)^2:

= -k (dθ/dt)^2 [ cosθ + (1 + cosθ) ] - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

= -k (dθ/dt)^2 (1 + 2 cosθ) - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can find d²θ/dt² in terms of v and θ.

Wait, let's take the time derivative of (dθ/dt)^2 = v^2 / [2 k^2 (1 + cosθ)].

So,

d/dt [ (dθ/dt)^2 ] = d/dt [ v^2 / (2 k^2 (1 + cosθ)) ].

But since v is constant, the derivative becomes:

2 dθ/dt * d²θ/dt² = [0] (since v^2 is constant) + [v^2 / (2 k^2)] * [ sinθ (dθ/dt) ].

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

The right-hand side is v^2 / [2 k^2 (1 + cosθ)].

Taking derivative with respect to time:

d/dt [v^2/(2k²(1 + cosθ))] = [0] + [v²/(2k²)] * [ sinθ (dθ/dt) ].

Because the derivative of 1/(1 + cosθ) is (sinθ dθ/dt)/(1 + cosθ)^2, but wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, no, let me think again.

Let me denote f(θ) = 1/(1 + cosθ).

Then, df/dt = df/dθ * dθ/dt = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ)^2 ] * dθ/dt.

So,

d/dt [v^2/(2k²(1 + cosθ))] = [v^2/(2k²)] * [ sinθ (dθ/dt) / (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

Therefore, we have:

2 dθ/dt * d²θ/dt² = [v²/(2k²)] * [ sinθ (dθ/dt) / (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

We can divide both sides by 2 dθ/dt (assuming dθ/dt ≠ 0):

d²θ/dt² = [v²/(4k²)] * [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

Hmm, this gives us an expression for d²θ/dt².

Now, let's substitute this back into the expression for a_r.

a_r = -k (dθ/dt)^2 (1 + 2 cosθ) - k sinθ d²θ/dt².

Substituting d²θ/dt²:

= -k (dθ/dt)^2 (1 + 2 cosθ) - k sinθ * [v²/(4k²)] * [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

Simplify each term:

First term: -k (dθ/dt)^2 (1 + 2 cosθ).

We know (dθ/dt)^2 = v² / [2k² (1 + cosθ)].

So,

First term: -k * [v² / (2k² (1 + cosθ))] * (1 + 2 cosθ).

= -k * [v² (1 + 2 cosθ) ] / [2k² (1 + cosθ)].

= - [v² (1 + 2 cosθ) ] / [2k (1 + cosθ)].

Second term:

- k sinθ * [v²/(4k²)] * [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

= - [k v² sin²θ ] / [4k² (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

= - [v² sin²θ ] / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

So, putting it together:

a_r = [ -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) ] / [2k (1 + cosθ) ] - [v² sin²θ ] / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

Now, let's simplify each term.

First term:

Factor numerator and denominator:

(1 + 2 cosθ) = (1 + cosθ) + cosθ.

So,

[ -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) ] / [2k (1 + cosθ) ] = -v² [ (1 + cosθ) + cosθ ] / [ 2k (1 + cosθ) ].

= -v² [ 1 + (cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ) ] / (2k).

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out 1/(1 + cosθ).

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term:

= -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) / [2k (1 + cosθ)].

= -v² [ (1 + cosθ) + cosθ ] / [2k (1 + cosθ)].

= -v² [ 1 + (cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ] / 2k.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can write 1 + 2 cosθ as (1 + cosθ) + cosθ.

So,

= -v² [ (1 + cosθ) + cosθ ] / [ 2k (1 + cosθ) ]

= -v² [ 1 + (cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ] / (2k).

But maybe another approach is better. Let me compute each term separately.

Let me compute the two terms:

Term1 = -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) / [2k (1 + cosθ)].

Term2 = -v² sin²θ / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ].

Let me combine these terms.

To combine, let's get a common denominator of 4k (1 + cosθ)^2.

So,

Term1 = -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) * 2 (1 + cosθ) / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ]

= -2v² (1 + 2 cosθ)(1 + cosθ) / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ]

= -v² (1 + 2 cosθ)(1 + cosθ) / [2k (1 + cosθ)^2 ]

= -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) / [2k (1 + cosθ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem to help. Maybe I should expand the numerator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the terms.

Let me compute Term1:

= -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) / [2k (1 + cosθ) ]

= -v² [ (1 + cosθ) + cosθ ] / [2k (1 + cosθ) ]

= -v² [ 1 + (cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ] / (2k).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's compute the two terms numerically.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out -v²/(4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: express sin²θ in terms of (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ).

So,

sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ).

So, Term2 becomes:

= -v² (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ]

= -v² (1 - cosθ) / [4k (1 + cosθ) ].

So now, Term1 is:

- v² (1 + 2 cosθ) / [2k (1 + cosθ) ]

= -v² [ (1 + cosθ) + cosθ ] / [2k (1 + cosθ) ]

= -v² [ 1 + (cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ] / (2k).

Hmm, perhaps I can write both terms with the same denominator.

Let me write Term1 as:

= -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) / [2k (1 + cosθ) ] = -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) * 2 (1 + cosθ) / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ]

Wait, no, perhaps I can write it as:

= -2v² (1 + 2 cosθ) (1 + cosθ) / [4k (1 + cosθ)^2 ]

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can combine Term1 and Term2.

So,

a_r = Term1 + Term2.

= [ -v² (1 + 2 cosθ) ] / [2k (1 + cosθ) ] + [ -v² (1 - cosθ) ] / [4k (1 + cosθ) ].

Factor out -v² / [4k (1 + cosθ) ].

= (-v² / [4k (1 + cosθ) ]) [ 2(1 + 2 cosθ) + (1 - cosθ) ].

Compute the bracket:

2(1 + 2 cosθ) = 2 + 4 cosθ.

Adding (1 - cosθ):

2 + 4 cosθ + 1 - cosθ = 3 + 3 cosθ.

So,

a_r = (-v² / [4k (1 + cosθ) ]) * (3 + 3 cosθ )

= (-v² * 3 (1 + cosθ) ) / [4k (1 + cosθ) ) ]

= (-3 v² ) / (4k ).

Wait, that's interesting. The (1 + cosθ) terms cancel out.

So, a_r = -3 v² / (4k ).

Looking at the options, option B is -3/4 (v²/k), which matches this result.
</think>

The problem involves a particle moving with constant speed \( v \) along a cardioid \( r = k(1 + \cos\theta) \). To find the radial component of acceleration \( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r \), we use polar coordinates and the expression for acceleration in polar form. 

In polar coordinates, the radial component of acceleration is given by:

\[
a_r = \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2
\]

Given \( r = k(1 + \cos\theta) \), we compute the necessary derivatives. First, \( \dot{r} = -k \sin\theta \dot{\theta} \) and \( \ddot{r} = -k [\cos\theta \dot{\theta}^2 + \sin\theta \ddot{\theta}] \). Substituting these into the expression for \( a_r \), we get:

\[
a_r = -k [\cos\theta \dot{\theta}^2 + \sin\theta \ddot{\theta}] - k(1 + \cos\theta)\dot{\theta}^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
a_r = -k (2\cos\theta + 1)\dot{\theta}^2 - k \sin\theta \ddot{\theta}
\]

Using the relation \( v^2 = \dot{r}^2 + (r \dot{\theta})^2 \) and solving for \( \dot{\theta}^2 \), we substitute back to simplify \( a_r \). After algebraic manipulation, the terms involving \( \theta \) cancel out, leaving:

\[
a_r = -\frac{3v^2}{4k}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: \(-\frac{3}{4} \frac{v^2}{k}\)**

Answer: B
