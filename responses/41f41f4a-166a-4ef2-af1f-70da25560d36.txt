The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A defendant was going out to dinner, and she parked her car at a parking lot across the street from the restaurant. The parking attendant directed the defendant to leave her keys in the car, and he handed her a receipt as she left. Following dinner, the defendant went back to the parking lot and handed her receipt to the attendant who informed her that the parking charge would be $14. Visibly irate, she told the attendant that $14 was much too high for a two-hour parking fee. The parking attendant responded that unless she paid the $14, he could not return her car. She adamantly refused to pay the $14, and her friend, with whom she was having dinner, drove the defendant home in her car. Later that same night, the defendant decided to regain possession of her car with a spare set of keys. She returned to the lot and drove her car home. If the defendant is subsequently charged with larceny, she will most likely be found

Options:

A: not guilty, because she did not take possession of another person's property.
B: guilty, because she intentionally avoided paying the parking fee by using her spare keys.
C: guilty, because she acted with the intent to deprive the parking lot of its rightful fee.
D: guilty, because she was under a binding contractual obligation to pay the parking fee.
E: not guilty, because the parking attendant did not have a legal right to withhold her car.
F: not guilty, because the parking lot's charges were not agreed upon in advance.
G: not guilty, because the $14 charge was excessively high.
H: guilty, because she failed to pay the $14 before regaining possession of her car.
I: guilty, because she knowingly took her car without the consent of the parking attendant.
J: not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the defendant would be found guilty of larceny. Let's break down the situation step by step.

First, the defendant parked her car in a parking lot, and the attendant told her to leave her keys and gave her a receipt. After dinner, she went back and tried to pay $14, which she thought was too high. She refused to pay, and her friend drove her home. Later that night, she used spare keys to take her car back.

Now, larceny typically involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. But in this case, the defendant is taking her own car. Wait, but she didn't have the attendant's consent when she took it. So, does that matter?

Looking at the options, option J says she can't be charged because she can't steal her own vehicle. That makes sense because larceny requires taking someone else's property. So if she owns the car, it's not larceny.

Other options: Option I says she took it without consent, but since it's her own property, that's not larceny. Option D talks about a contractual obligation, but parking fees usually require payment before taking the car, and she didn't pay. But does that make it larceny? Or is it more about breach of contract?

Wait, but she used a spare key, meaning she didn't take it directly from the attendant's possession. The attendant had her car, but she used her own key to take it back. So maybe she didn't take it from someone else's possession, but she just retrieved her own property. So, larceny wouldn't apply because she's not taking another's property.

So the answer should be J, not guilty because she can't steal her own car.

The defendant cannot be charged with larceny because she was taking her own property, not someone else's. Larceny requires the taking of another person's property, which does not apply here. 

Answer: J
