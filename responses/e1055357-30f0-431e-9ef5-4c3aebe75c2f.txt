Okay, so I've got this question about brief crisis-oriented therapy, and I need to figure out which option correctly describes it. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that crisis-oriented therapy is a type of short-term counseling aimed at helping individuals deal with immediate problems or crises. The main goal is to provide quick relief and restore the person's emotional stability. Unlike longer-term therapies that might focus on past experiences or deep-rooted issues, crisis therapy is more about addressing the here and now.

Looking at the options, I need to think about what each one says about the therapy approach. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Avoid setting any specific goals to maintain flexibility. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think goal setting is important in therapy to measure progress, so avoiding goals might not fit. Maybe not A.

Option B: Focus on developing a deep understanding before setting goals. That sounds more like a longer-term approach, maybe psychodynamic or something. Crisis therapy is more about immediate action, so probably not B.

Option C: Try to ensure the client becomes calm and relaxed. While calming the client is part of it, is that the main characteristic? I think the key is the structure and goal-oriented approach, so maybe not just C.

Option D: Agree upon clear-cut goals and keep sessions focused. This sounds familiar. I remember that brief therapies are structured and have specific goals to keep the sessions on track. So D might be correct.

Option E: Primarily use medication. That's more about medical approaches, like psychiatry. Therapy, especially brief crisis-oriented, is more about counseling and strategies, so E is unlikely.

Option F: Encourage clients to disregard issues until later. That doesn't make sense; crisis therapy is about addressing the issues now, not putting them off.

Option G: Focus on long-term coping mechanisms. Again, that's more for longer-term therapy. Crisis is immediate, so G is probably not right.

Option H: Rely on group therapy. While group therapy can be effective, the question is about the characteristic of brief crisis-oriented therapy in general. It could be individual or group, but the key here is the focus on goals and structure, so H might not be the best choice.

Option I: Explore early childhood experiences. That's definitely not crisis-oriented, which focuses on the present issue, so I can rule out I.

Option J: Be open and nondirective, allowing exploration of all aspects. That sounds more like a humanistic approach, maybe Rogerian counseling. Crisis therapy is more structured, so J doesn't fit.

So, putting it all together, the key characteristics are setting clear goals and keeping the sessions focused on those goals. That points to option D.

The correct answer is D: agree upon clear-cut goals and keep the sessions focused on these goals.

Answer: D
