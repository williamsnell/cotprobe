Question:

A furniture store had a truck that an employee of the store used to deliver furniture to the store's customers. One afternoon while the employee was driving the truck to deliver a chair to a customer, the employee negligently ran through a stop sign and hit a car. The driver of the car suffered a leg injury and succeeded in suing the furniture store, recovering $25,000. Assume that all of these events occur in a jurisdiction that has statutes permitting defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity. In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover

Options:

A: $15,000, because the employee and the furniture store share 60-40 responsibility for the accident.
B: $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses.
C: nothing, because the furniture store should have maintained the truck in a safer condition.
D: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.
E: nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages.
F: $12,500, unless the furniture store had provided proper training to the employee.
G: nothing, because the employee was not acting negligently.
H: the full amount, only if the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage.
I: $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.
J: nothing, because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about tort law, specifically regarding contribution and indemnity. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a furniture store whose employee was delivering furniture. The employee ran a stop sign and hit a car, causing the driver to sue the store for $25,000. Now, the store is suing the employee to recover their losses. I need to determine how much the store can recover.

First, I remember that in cases like this, the employer (furniture store) is often vicariously liable for the employee's actions if they were within the scope of employment. But since the store was able to sue the employee, it's probably because they're seeking indemnity or contribution.

The question mentions statutes allowing defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity. Contribution is when a party who is jointly liable seeks to shift some of the liability to another party. Indemnity is when one party is legally obligated to compensate another for liability they assumed.

In this case, the employee was negligent, so the store is likely seeking indemnity because the employee's negligence directly caused the accident. The store was held liable, so they might want to recover the entire amount from the employee.

Looking at the options, option D says the store recovers $25k because the employee was at fault. That makes sense because if the employee was negligent, the employer can seek full indemnity. But I should double-check if there's any reason the store wouldn't get the full amount.

Other options: Option E says nothing because the store was primarily liable. But that's not right because the store's liability here is vicarious, not primary. The primary at-fault party is the employee. So the store can seek contribution or indemnity.

Option J says nothing because the employee was acting within the scope. But if the employee was negligent, the store can recover from the employee. Vicarious liability doesn't prevent the employer from suing the employee; it just holds the employer liable alongside the employee.

Option B says they recover unless fully insured. But the question doesn't mention insurance coverage being an issue. It's more about liability between the employer and employee.

So I think D is correct because the employee's fault means the store can recover the full amount.

The furniture store can recover the full $25,000 from the employee because the employee's negligence directly caused the accident. The store, as the employer, can seek indemnity from the employee despite being vicariously liable to the injured party. 

Answer: D
