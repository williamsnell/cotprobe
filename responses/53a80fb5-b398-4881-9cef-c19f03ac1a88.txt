Question:

A male bacterium conjugates with a female bacterium. After conjugation , the female becomes a male. Account for this "sex-change".

Options:

A: The female bacterium becomes a male by incorporating male genetic material into its own genome.
B: The female bacterium becomes a male by dividing and producing a male offspring.
C: The female bacterium becomes a male by undergoing a mutation in its own DNA.
D: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor.
E: The female bacterium becomes a male by exposure to a particular environmental condition.
F: The female bacterium becomes a male by exchanging plasmids with the male bacterium.
G: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving a sex chromosome.
H: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving a male chromosome.
I: The female bacterium becomes a male by conjugating with a male bacterium.
J: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving multiple copies of the F factor.

Okay, so I have this question about bacteria conjugation and how a female bacterium becomes male after conjugating with a male. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that bacteria can have something called the F factor, which is a piece of plasmid DNA that allows them to be 'male' and transfer genetic material. So when a male bacterium, which has the F factor, conjugates with a female bacterium, which doesn't have it, they transfer that F factor.

I think the process involves the male bacterium producing a pilus to connect and transfer the plasmid. The female then takes up the F factor, which makes it able to produce its own pili and become male. So the key here is the transfer of the F factor.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the female incorporates male genetic material into its genome. That makes sense because the F factor is genetic material from the male. But wait, the F factor is on a plasmid, not the main genome. So the female's genome might not incorporate it, but it's a plasmid.

Option B says she becomes male by dividing and producing male offspring. No, bacteria reproduce through binary fission, and the sex change isn't about producing offspring. It's about the transfer of the F factor.

Option C suggests a mutation. Unlikely, because it's a transfer of genetic material, not a mutation.

Option D says receiving one copy of the F factor. That sounds right because the male transfers the F factor, which the female takes up. So the female then can conjugate because it has the F factor now.

Option E is about environmental conditions. I don't think so; it's more about genetic transfer.

Option F says exchanging plasmids. Well, conjugation does involve plasmid transfer, but specifically, the F factor is a plasmid. So F is a possibility, but maybe D is more specific because it's about the F factor.

Option G and H mention sex chromosomes or male chromosomes, but bacteria don't have chromosomes like eukaryotes. So those can be eliminated.

Option I says by conjugating with a male. But the conjugation is the process, not the reason. The reason is the F factor transfer.

Option J says receiving multiple copies of F factor. I think typically, the transfer is a single copy, but I'm not entirely sure. Sometimes bacteria can have multiple F factors, but the main change is the presence of at least one F factor.

So the question is why the female becomes male. It's because she receives the F factor, which allows her to produce pili and transfer genetic material. So the correct reason is that she receives the F factor, which is option D. 

Wait, but sometimes the F factor is transferred as a single copy. So D says one copy. Alternatively, sometimes the transfer is of the entire plasmid, but the key is the F factor.

So I think D is correct because it's about receiving the F factor, making her male.

The correct answer is **D**. When a female bacterium conjugates with a male bacterium, it receives the F factor, a plasmid that enables it to produce a pilus and transfer genetic material, effectively turning it into a male bacterium.

Answer: D
