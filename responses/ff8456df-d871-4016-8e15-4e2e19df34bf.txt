Question:

In the extreme case, $ 1,000 of new reserves put into a bank will ultimately result in an increase of $ 5,000 of bank de-posits, assuming that the reserve ratio is 20%. But in reality this is rarely the case. What stops the extreme case from being realized?

Options:

A: A decrease in the money supply by the central bank
B: Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio
C: Low bank deposits
D: Excessive regulation of the banking industry
E: Increase in government borrowing crowding out private lending

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: In the extreme case, $1,000 of new reserves put into a bank will ultimately result in an increase of $5,000 of bank deposits, assuming the reserve ratio is 20%. But in reality, this doesn't often happen. What stops the extreme case from being realized? The options are A through E.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that this has to do with the money multiplier effect and reserve ratios. The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that a bank must hold as reserves. So if the reserve ratio is 20%, the bank can lend out 80% of deposits. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio, right? So here, 1/0.2 = 5. That's why $1,000 in reserves leads to $5,000 in deposits in the extreme case.

But the question is, why doesn't this happen in reality? What stops the maximum expansion?

I think one reason is that banks don't always lend out all their excess reserves. They might choose to hold onto some for other reasons, like liquidity needs or unexpected withdrawals. But looking at the options, I don't see that directly.

Option A: Decrease in money supply by the central bank. I'm not sure how that would stop the expansion. Maybe if the central bank reduces the money supply, banks have less to lend, but I'm not certain if that's the main reason here.

Option B: Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio. Wait, if people start withdrawing money from their deposits, the bank's actual reserves might drop below the required ratio. So the bank can't just keep expanding deposits because they have to maintain the reserve ratio. If people withdraw, the bank has less to lend, which limits the expansion. This makes sense because if withdrawals happen, the money multiplier effect can't fully take place.

Option C: Low bank deposits. That seems like a symptom rather than a cause. If deposits are low, maybe the multiplier effect isn't working, but it doesn't explain what's stopping it.

Option D: Excessive regulation. More regulation might limit how much banks can lend, but the question is about the extreme case not happening, which is usually due to practical constraints, not necessarily regulation.

Option E: Government borrowing crowding out private lending. That's when the government borrows so much that it takes away funds from private sector loans. I'm not sure if that's the main factor here. It's more about fiscal policy affecting the money supply.

So putting it together, the main reason the extreme case doesn't happen is because of withdrawals and the banks needing to maintain the reserve ratio. If people start taking out money, the banks can't keep expanding deposits as much because they have to keep the required reserves. So option B seems correct.

The extreme case of the money multiplier effect assumes that banks lend out all their excess reserves and that there are no withdrawals. However, in reality, withdrawals of deposits can occur, which reduces the bank's reserves below the required reserve ratio. This forces banks to limit their lending activities to maintain compliance with the reserve requirements, thereby preventing the full expansion of deposits. Therefore, the factor that stops the extreme case from being realized is withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio.

Answer: B
