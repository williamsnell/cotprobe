Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about neutralizing phosphoric acid (H3PO4) with potassium hydroxide (KOH). The goal is to find out how many milliliters of 0.250 M KOH are needed to completely neutralize 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H3PO4. The options are A through J, each with different volumes.

Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form a salt and water. The key here is to write the balanced chemical equation because that will tell me the mole ratio between the acid and the base, which is crucial for calculating the required volumes.

So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. KOH is a strong base and will donate one hydroxide ion each time. The reaction should look something like this:

H3PO4 + 3 KOH → K3PO4 + 3 H2O

Wait, let me make sure. Each H3PO4 can react with three KOH molecules because it has three H+ ions. So the balanced equation is correct: 1 mole of H3PO4 reacts with 3 moles of KOH.

Now, I'll need to calculate the moles of H3PO4 first. The formula for moles is concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L).

H3PO4 concentration is 0.150 M, and the volume is 50.0 mL. Oh wait, I need to convert mL to liters. So 50.0 mL is 0.050 L.

Moles of H3PO4 = 0.150 mol/L * 0.050 L = 0.0075 mol.

Since each mole of H3PO4 requires 3 moles of KOH, the moles of KOH needed would be 3 * 0.0075 mol = 0.0225 mol.

Okay, now I have the moles of KOH needed. The concentration of KOH is 0.250 M. I can use the formula rearranged to solve for volume: volume = moles / concentration.

Volume of KOH = 0.0225 mol / 0.250 mol/L = 0.09 L, which is 90.0 mL.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 90.0 mL. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Balanced equation: 1 H3PO4 + 3 KOH → 1 K3PO4 + 3 H2O. That looks right.
2. Moles of H3PO4: 0.150 M * 0.05 L = 0.0075 mol. Yep, that's correct.
3. Moles of KOH needed: 0.0075 * 3 = 0.0225 mol. Right.
4. Volume of KOH: 0.0225 / 0.25 = 0.09 L = 90 mL. Yep, that all adds up.

I think I'm confident with that. So the answer should be B: 90.0 mL.

To determine how many milliliters of 0.250 M KOH are needed to neutralize 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H₃PO₄, we start by writing the balanced chemical equation:

\[
\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 + 3\text{KOH} \rightarrow \text{K}_3\text{PO}_4 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the equation, 1 mole of H₃PO₄ reacts with 3 moles of KOH. 

1. **Calculate moles of H₃PO₄:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_3\text{PO}_4 = 0.150 \, \text{M} \times 0.050 \, \text{L} = 0.0075 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Determine moles of KOH needed:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of KOH} = 3 \times 0.0075 \, \text{mol} = 0.0225 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate volume of KOH solution:**
   \[
   \text{Volume of KOH} = \frac{0.0225 \, \text{mol}}{0.250 \, \text{M}} = 0.09 \, \text{L} = 90.0 \, \text{mL}
   \]

Thus, the volume of KOH required is **90.0 mL**.
