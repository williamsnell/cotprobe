Okay, I'm trying to figure out this tax question about Vale's adjusted gross income from the Ball Partnership. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the question says Vale is a 50% partner in Ball Partnership. So, she owns half of it. Her tax basis in Ball on January 2 of year 1 was $60,000. That's her initial basis, so I should remember that.

Then, Ball didn't have any unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or contributed properties. That probably means that when there are distributions, they won't be treated as sales or something complicated like that. So, maybe the distributions are just a return of capital or maybe taxable as income.

On December 31 of year 1, Ball made a $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner. Since she's a 50% partner, she would get half of that? Wait, no, each partner gets $10,000. So, if there are two partners, each gets $10k. That's straightforward because it's a cash distribution. Nonliquidating means it's not taking away her capital entirely; it's just a return of some capital.

Now, looking at the tax return of Ball Partnership for year 1: they reported tax-exempt interest income of $80,000 and dividend income of $12,000. So, the total income from these would be $92,000. But wait, partnerships pass through their income to the partners, so Vale would include her share of these in her income.

But the question is about the gross income from Ball that should be included in her adjusted gross income. So, I need to figure out what portion of the partnership's income she includes.

Wait, but there's also the distribution. Distributions affect the basis. Let me think. Her basis was $60,000 at the start. She receives a $10,000 distribution. Since it's nonliquidating, it's a return of capital. So, her basis decreases by $10,000. So, her ending basis would be $60k - $10k = $50k.

But how does that affect her income? The key here is that when a partnership makes a distribution, if it's a return of capital, it doesn't affect her taxable income because it's not income. It just affects her basis. So, the $10k she received is a return of capital, so it's not taxable as income for her. Her taxable income from the partnership would be her share of the partnership's taxable income.

The partnership's taxable income is from the items listed: tax-exempt interest and dividends. Tax-exempt interest is usually tax-exempt to the partnership, so it's not taxable income for the partnership. Wait, noâ€”tax-exempt interest is income that doesn't generate taxable income for the partnership. So, the partnership doesn't pay tax on it, but does that mean it's not passed through to the partners? Wait, no, that's not right. Tax-exempt interest is income that's tax-exempt, so the partnership doesn't include it in its taxable income. So, the partners wouldn't include it either because it's not taxable income of the partnership.

Wait, but the question says the partnership's tax return reported these items. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The partnership's income includes tax-exempt interest and dividends. But for the partnership, tax-exempt interest is not taxable, so their taxable income would only be the dividends. Because dividends are taxable to the partnership.

Wait, no, partnerships don't pay tax on their income; they pass it through. So, the partnership's taxable income is what they report. But the items: tax-exempt interest is not taxable to the partnership. So, for the partnership, only the dividend income is taxable. So, the partnership's taxable income is $12,000.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The partnership's income includes $80k tax-exempt interest and $12k dividends. But for tax purposes, the partnership's taxable income would be the sum of its taxable items. Tax-exempt interest is not taxable, so the partnership's taxable income is only the dividends, $12k.

Therefore, Vale, as a 50% partner, would include her share of that taxable income, which is 50% of $12k, so $6k.

But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have $6k as the only answer. Let me go back.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax-exempt interest is passed through to the partners. Wait, no. Tax-exempt interest received by a partnership is not taxable to the partnership, so it's not passed through to the partners as income. So, partners don't include that in their income.

So, the only income that the partnership passes through is the dividends. So, $12k total. So, Vale's share is 50%, so $6k.

But wait, that would make her include $6k in her income. But the question is about the gross income from Ball. Additionally, she received a distribution. So, maybe the distribution affects her basis but not her income.

Wait, but sometimes, if the distribution exceeds her basis, it's considered gain. But in this case, her basis was $60k, and she received $10k. Her basis goes down to $50k, and since the distribution is less than her basis, it's a return of capital, not taxable. So, no gain.

So, her income from the partnership is only her share of the taxable income, which is $6k. But looking at the options, J is $6k. But wait, the options don't have J as correct because I think I might have missed something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again. The partnership's taxable income is the sum of all its taxable items. Tax-exempt interest is not taxable, so the partnership's taxable income is only the dividends, which is $12k. So, each partner gets half, so $6k each. So, Vale includes $6k in her AGI.

But wait, the options include E as $96k, which is the total of both items, but that doesn't make sense because she's only a 50% partner. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says, "What total amount of gross income from Ball should be included..." So, it's the amount of income from Ball that she includes. So, she includes her share of the partnership's taxable income. The partnership's taxable income is $12k, so she includes $6k.

So, the answer would be J: $6,000.

But wait, let me check if I missed anything. The partnership's tax-exempt interest is not taxable to the partners, so they don't include it. The dividends are taxable. So, she includes 50% of $12k, which is $6k.

But I'm looking at the options, and J is $6k. So, that should be the answer.

The total amount of gross income from Ball that should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income is $6,000.
