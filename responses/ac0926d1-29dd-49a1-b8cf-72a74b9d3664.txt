Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A manufacturer of motor oil is interested in testing the effects of a newly developed additive on the lifespan of an engine. Twenty-five different engine types are selected at random and each one is tested using oil with the additive and oil without the additive. What type of analysis will yield the most useful information?

Options:

A: Independent samples t-test for population proportions
B: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
C: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
D: Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
E: Paired t-test for population proportions
F: Independent samples comparison of population proportions
G: Matched pairs comparison of population proportions
H: Chi-square test for independence
I: Matched pairs comparison of population means
J: Independent samples comparison of population means

Okay, so I have this question about statistical analysis methods, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says a motor oil manufacturer wants to test a new additive's effect on engine lifespan. They selected 25 different engine types, each tested with oil that has the additive and without it. So each engine is used twice, once with each type of oil. They want to know what analysis will give the most useful info.

Hmm, so the setup is that each engine is tested under two conditions: with additive and without. So this is a paired situation because the same engine is used for both measurements. That makes me think of paired or matched data.

Looking at the options:

A: Independent samples t-test for proportions. Wait, t-test is for means, not proportions. So probably not A.

B: Two-way ANOVA. That's for when you have two independent variables. Here, the only factor is the additive, so maybe not B.

C: One-way ANOVA. That's for comparing more than two groups. But here each engine is paired, so maybe not C.

D: Repeated measures ANOVA. Oh, that's used when the same subjects are measured multiple times. Since each engine is tested twice, this could fit. But wait, ANOVA is for comparing means across groups, but here each engine is its own group. Or is it? Wait, no, repeated measures ANOVA is for when each subject is measured in each condition. But the question has 25 engines, each tested twice. So maybe it's a paired situation across two measurements per engine.

E: Paired t-test for proportions. Again, t-test for proportions? I think paired t-test is for means, so E might not be right.

F: Independent samples comparison for proportions. Again, not sure why proportions are relevant here. The question is about lifespan, which is a continuous variable, so means are more likely.

G: Matched pairs comparison of population proportions. Proportions again. Not sure.

H: Chi-square test for independence. That's for categorical data, not lifespan which is continuous. So probably not H.

I: Matched pairs comparison of population means. Oh, that sounds right. Because each engine is a pair, so matched pairs, and we're comparing the mean lifespan with and without additive.

J: Independent samples comparison of population means. That would be if each engine was in only one group, but here each is in both, so J is for independent groups, which isn't the case.

Wait, so I'm a bit confused between D and I. Let me think. Repeated measures ANOVA is a type of ANOVA where the same subject is measured multiple times, so it's used for within-subjects designs. Matched pairs t-test is a special case of this for two measurements. So if the data is normally distributed, a paired t-test (which is a type of matched pairs analysis) would be appropriate. If there are more than two measurements, you might use repeated measures ANOVA, but here it's two measurements per engine, so a paired t-test (option I is a comparison of means, so I think I is the correct choice, but looking at the options, I is matched pairs comparison of means, which is the same as a paired t-test.

Wait, but the options don't have a paired t-test for means, but option I is matched pairs comparison of population means. That's essentially a paired t-test. So I think the correct answer is I.

Alternatively, option D is repeated measures ANOVA, but that's for more than two measurements, or for more complex designs. Since each engine is only measured twice, a paired t-test (I) is sufficient. So the answer should be I.

The correct analysis for this scenario is a matched pairs comparison of population means, as each engine is tested twice under two conditions. This is best addressed with a paired t-test, which is equivalent to option I.

Answer: I
