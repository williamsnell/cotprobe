Okay, so I need to find the solubility of magnesium hydroxide in both pure water and a 0.05 M NaOH solution. The solubility product constant (Ksp) is given as 8.9 × 10^-12. Hmm, I remember that solubility in water and in a solution with a common ion will be different because of the common ion effect.

Let me start with part (a), solubility in water. Magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)₂, dissociates into Mg²+ and OH⁻ ions. The dissolution equation would be Mg(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Mg²+(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq). 

Let me denote the solubility as 's'. So, when Mg(OH)₂ dissolves, it produces 's' moles of Mg²+ and '2s' moles of OH⁻ per liter. The Ksp expression is Ksp = [Mg²+][OH⁻]². Plugging in the values, Ksp = (s)(2s)² = 4s³. 

So, 8.9 × 10^-12 = 4s³. To find s, I rearrange this equation: s³ = (8.9 × 10^-12) / 4. Let me calculate that. 8.9 divided by 4 is approximately 2.225, so s³ ≈ 2.225 × 10^-12. Taking the cube root of both sides, s ≈ cube_root(2.225e-12). 

I think the cube root of 2.225 is around 1.3, and the cube root of 1e-12 is 1e-4, because (1e-4)^3 = 1e-12. Let me check: 1.3 × 1e-4 is 1.3e-4. Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. The cube root of 2.225 is approximately 1.3, so s ≈ 1.3 × 1e-4, which is 1.3e-4 M. 

Looking at the options, part (a) solubility is the first value in each option. Let me check the options: Option A is 1.4e-4, B is 1.5e-4, J is 1.3e-4. So J might be a candidate, but wait, maybe my approximation isn't precise enough. Let me calculate more accurately.

s³ = 8.9e-12 /4 = 2.225e-12. Cube root of 2.225e-12. Let me compute it step by step. 

The cube of 1.3e-4: (1.3e-4)^3 = (1.3)^3 × (1e-4)^3 = 2.197 × 1e-12 ≈ 2.197e-12. Wait, but our s³ is 2.225e-12, which is a bit higher. So maybe s is a bit higher than 1.3e-4. Let's try 1.31e-4: (1.31)^3 is about 2.245, so 2.245e-12. That's close to 2.225e-12. So s is approximately 1.305e-4, which would round to 1.31e-4, so maybe closer to 1.3e-4. Hmm, but the options have 1.3e-4 as option J, and 1.4e-4 as option A. So perhaps I should check more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is around 1.3e-4. Let me calculate it properly. Let me compute s = (2.225e-12)^(1/3). I can use logarithms or a calculator. Wait, but since I don't have a calculator, I can approximate. Let's see: 1.3^3 is 2.197, as I said, which is 2.197e-12 when s is 1.3e-4. The target is 2.225e-12, which is a bit higher. So the actual s is a bit higher than 1.3e-4. So perhaps 1.31e-4? Let's compute (1.31e-4)^3: (1.31)^3 = approximately 2.245. So 2.245e-12, which is higher than 2.225e-12. So perhaps s is about 1.305e-4. 

Wait, but the options don't have 1.3e-4 except option J. So I'll go with part (a) being approximately 1.3e-4 M.

Now, part (b) is the solubility in 0.05 M NaOH. Since NaOH is a strong base, it dissociates completely into Na+ and OH-. So the OH- concentration is already 0.05 M from NaOH. When Mg(OH)₂ dissolves, it adds more OH- ions, but because OH- is already present, the solubility will be less due to the common ion effect.

The dissolution equation is the same: Mg(OH)₂ ⇌ Mg²+ + 2OH⁻. Let the solubility be 's' in this case. So [Mg²+] = s, and [OH⁻] = 0.05 + 2s. But since 0.05 is much larger than 2s (because s is small), we can approximate [OH⁻] ≈ 0.05 M. 

So Ksp = [Mg²+][OH⁻]^2 ≈ s*(0.05)^2. So Ksp = s*(0.0025). Solving for s, s ≈ Ksp / 0.0025 = (8.9e-12) / 0.0025. Let me compute that: 8.9e-12 / 2.5e-3 = (8.9 / 2.5) × 1e-9. 8.9 divided by 2.5 is about 3.56, so s ≈ 3.56e-9 M. 

Looking at the options, part (b) solubility values are the second numbers. Option J has 3.6e-9, which is close to 3.56e-9. So that would match part (b).

So putting it together, part (a) is approximately 1.3e-4 and part (b) is approximately 3.6e-9, which corresponds to option J.

The solubility of magnesium hydroxide in water is calculated using the solubility product constant \( K_{sp} = 8.9 \times 10^{-12} \). The dissolution equation is:

\[
\text{Mg(OH)}_2(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Mg}^{2+}(aq) + 2\text{OH}^-(aq)
\]

Let the solubility in water be \( s \). Then, \([ \text{Mg}^{2+} ] = s\) and \([ \text{OH}^- ] = 2s\). The \( K_{sp} \) expression is:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Mg}^{2+}][\text{OH}^-]^2 = s(2s)^2 = 4s^3
\]

Substituting \( K_{sp} \):

\[
8.9 \times 10^{-12} = 4s^3 \implies s^3 = \frac{8.9 \times 10^{-12}}{4} = 2.225 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
s = \sqrt[3]{2.225 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L}
\]

For part (b), in a 0.05 M NaOH solution, the common ion effect reduces solubility. The dissolution equation remains the same, but \([ \text{OH}^- ] = 0.05 + 2s \approx 0.05 \, \text{M}\) (since \( 2s \) is negligible). The \( K_{sp} \) expression becomes:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Mg}^{2+}][\text{OH}^-]^2 \implies 8.9 \times 10^{-12} = s(0.05)^2 = s(0.0025)
\]

Solving for \( s \):

\[
s = \frac{8.9 \times 10^{-12}}{0.0025} = 3.56 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol/L}
\]

Thus, the solubility in water is approximately \( 1.3 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L} \), and in 0.05 M NaOH, it is approximately \( 3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol/L} \), matching option J.
