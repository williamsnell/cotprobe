Okay, so I have this economics question here about what shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. Hmm, I remember that the aggregate demand curve shows the total demand for goods and services in an economy at different price levels. A rightward shift means that at every price level, the quantity demanded is higher. So, what causes that?

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: An increase in unemployment rates. Wait, higher unemployment usually means people have less income, so they spend less. That should decrease aggregate demand, shifting the curve left, not right. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: A decrease in government spending. Government spending is part of aggregate demand. If it decreases, that would lower overall demand, shifting the curve left. So B is likely not the answer either.

Option C: A decrease in the supply of money. If there's less money, people can't borrow as much, and interest rates might rise. Higher interest rates would make borrowing for investment and consumption more expensive, which would reduce spending. That would shift AD left, not right. So C isn't the answer.

Option D: An increase in savings. If people save more, they spend less. Savings are a leakage from the circular flow, so lower consumption would mean lower aggregate demand. So D would shift the curve left, not right.

Option E: An increase in interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which reduces investment. Investment is part of aggregate demand, so lower investment would shift AD left. So E is not the answer.

Option F: Depreciation in the international value of the dollar. If the dollar depreciates, it becomes weaker relative to other currencies. This makes exports cheaper for foreign buyers and imports more expensive. Cheaper exports can increase net exports, which are part of aggregate demand. So an increase in net exports would shift the AD curve to the right. That sounds like a possible answer.

Option G: An increase in the price level. Wait, that's along the AD curve, not shifting it. If the price level rises, it's a movement along the curve, not a shift. So G doesn't cause a shift; it's just a change in price, so G isn't the answer.

Option H: A decrease in consumer confidence. If people are less confident, they'll save more and spend less. That reduces aggregate demand, shifting the curve left. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: An increase in personal income tax rates. Higher taxes mean people have less disposable income, so they spend less. This would decrease aggregate demand, shifting the curve left. So I isn't the answer.

So, going back, the only option that seems to cause a rightward shift is F, depreciation of the dollar. That makes exports more attractive, increasing net exports, which increases aggregate demand. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. Depreciation in the international value of the dollar would make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, leading to an increase in net exports and thereby shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right.

Answer: F
