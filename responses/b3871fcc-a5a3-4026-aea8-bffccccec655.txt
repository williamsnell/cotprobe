Question:

What is meant by cross elasticity of demand?

Options:

A: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percent-age change in the price of a good and the per-centage change in the quantity demanded of another good
B: Cross elasticity is the measure of how the quantity supplied of one good changes in response to a change in price of the same good
C: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percent-age change in the quantity demanded of a good and the per-centage change in the price of another good.
D: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity supplied of a good and the percentage change in the price of another good
E: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in price of a good and the percentage change in the quantity demanded of the same good
F: Cross elasticity is the change in demand for a good due to a change in the price of a complementary good
G: Cross elasticity is the change in quantity demanded of a good due to a change in income of the consumer
H: Cross elasticity is the measure of the change in the quantity demanded of a good in response to a change in the consumer's taste
I: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the quantity demanded of a good and the price of another good
J: Cross elasticity is the change in quantity demanded of a good due to the change in price of the same good

Okay, so I need to figure out what cross elasticity of demand means. I remember from economics that elasticity usually has to do with how responsive one variable is to a change in another. There's price elasticity of demand, which measures how much the quantity demanded changes with a price change. But cross elasticity is a bit different, I think.

Cross elasticity... wait, I think it's about two different goods. Like, how the demand for one good changes when the price of another good changes. So, if Good A's price goes up, does that affect how much Good B is demanded?

Looking at the options:

Option A says cross elasticity is the ratio of the percentage change in the price of a good to the percentage change in quantity demanded of another. Wait, that sounds like it's price over quantity, but I thought it's the other way around. Because elasticity is usually (change in quantity)/(change in price). So if it's cross elasticity, maybe it's (change in quantity of X)/(change in price of Y). So Option A has price first, which might not be right.

Option B talks about quantity supplied and the same good. That's more like price elasticity of supply, not cross elasticity. So B is probably not it.

Option C says the ratio between percentage change in quantity demanded of a good and the percentage change in price of another good. That seems more accurate. Because it's the change in quantity demanded of one good (X) divided by the change in price of another good (Y). That fits the definition of cross elasticity.

Option D is about quantity supplied and another good's price. That doesn't seem right because cross elasticity is about demand, not supply. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E is about the same good's price and quantity demanded. That sounds like price elasticity of demand, not cross. So E is not the answer.

Option F says it's the change in demand due to a complementary good's price change. Well, cross elasticity does consider complementary or substitute goods, but F is more of an example rather than the definition. The question is asking what cross elasticity is, not just an example.

Option G is about income change affecting demand. That's income elasticity, not cross. So G is out.

Option H talks about changes in consumer taste. That's probably part of price elasticity but not cross elasticity. H is incorrect.

Option I is a ratio of quantity demanded to another good's price, which is a bit odd because elasticity should involve percentage changes, not just the ratio. So I is not correct.

Option J is about the same good's price change affecting its quantity demanded. That's price elasticity again, not cross. So J is wrong.

So, putting it all together, the correct definition is in Option C. Cross elasticity is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good to the percentage change in the price of another good.
</think>

Cross elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. It is calculated as the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good and the percentage change in the price of another good.
