Okay, so I've got this question about which factor contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I need to remember what natural law is. From what I recall, natural law is the belief that certain rights and moral principles are inherent in human nature and are discoverable through human reason. It's an old concept, going back to philosophers like Aristotle and was influential in the development of modern legal systems.

The question is about the 20th century revival. So I should think about events or movements in the 1900s that might have brought natural law back into focus.

Looking at the options:

A: The end of the Cold War. The Cold War ended in 1991. I'm not sure how that ties into natural law. Maybe because after the ideological conflict, people looked for more universal principles? Not sure.

B: The Bolshevik Revolution. That was in 1917, so it's early 20th century. The Bolsheviks were communists, and communism is often contrasted with natural law's emphasis on individual rights. Not sure if this contributed to the revival.

C: The international recognition of human rights after World War II. World War II ended in 1945. The UN was formed, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948. This seems relevant because natural law emphasizes inherent human rights, so this recognition might have revived interest in natural law principles.

D: The invention of the Internet. That happened more in the late 20th century, but how does it relate to natural law? Maybe by spreading ideas, but I don't think it's the main factor here.

E: The rise of Fascism. That was mid-20th century. Fascism is more about state control and might not align with natural law's focus on individual rights.

F: The rise of Communism in China. China became communist in 1949. Again, similar to the Bolshevik Revolution, I'm not sure how this directly ties into natural law's revival.

G: The Depression of the 1930s. The Great Depression was a major economic event. Maybe it led people to question existing legal and social structures, but I'm not certain about the link to natural law.

H: The advent of the Industrial Revolution. That was in the 18th and 19th centuries, so it's not really a 20th-century event. Probably not the answer.

So, the most plausible options seem to be A, C, and maybe G. But I think C is the strongest. After World War II, there was a push to establish human rights on a global scale, which would align with natural law thinking. The Nuremberg trials and the development of international law likely played a role in this revival.

I'm leaning towards option C as the correct answer.

The revival of natural law in the 20th century was significantly influenced by the international recognition of human rights after World War II. This period saw the establishment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, which aligned with natural law's emphasis on inherent human rights. 

Answer: C
