Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about machinist proficiency tests and their validity. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question says that the test items were based on job analyses from 50 plants, each with five or more machinists doing comparable work. I need to figure out which type of validity this contributes to.

First, I remember that validity in testing refers to how well the test measures what it's supposed to measure. There are different types like content, criterion, construct, etc. The question mentions job analysis, which I think involves identifying the skills and tasks required for the job. So if the test is based on job analysis, it's probably ensuring that the test covers the necessary job-related content.

Content validity is about whether the test covers all the important aspects of the job. If the test items are developed from job analyses across multiple plants, that should mean the test accurately reflects the actual work done by machinists. So this would support content validity.

Other options: Face validity is about whether the test appears valid to the test-taker, not necessarily the actual content. Concurrent validity is about correlation with another test given at the same time. Internal validity is about whether the test measures what it's supposed to without other factors interfering. Criterion validity is about how well the test predicts future performance, which might relate to job performance data.

Construct validity is more about measuring theoretical constructs, like intelligence, rather than specific job tasks. Empirical validity is a bit vague, but I think it's about evidence from testing. Predictive validity is about predicting future outcomes, like job performance. Discriminant validity is about distinguishing between different groups.

So the question is about the test being based on job analysis, which directly ties to content validity. Therefore, the answer should be J: content validity.

The correct answer is J: content validity. The test items were developed based on job analysis, ensuring they cover the necessary job-related content.

Answer: J
