Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. 

The problem states that a steel with 0.7% carbon (by weight) is in equilibrium with a methane-hydrogen gas mixture. The gas is 99% H2 and 1% CH4 by volume at 1173 K and 1 atm. I need to find two things: the activity of carbon in the steel and the equilibrium volume percentages of CO and CO2 in a carbon monoxide-carbon dioxide mixture under the same conditions.

The data provided includes two reactions. The first reaction is C(s graphite) + 2 H2(g) ⇌ CH4(g) with ΔG° = -21,600 + 26.2T cal. The second reaction is CO2(g) + C(s graphite) ⇌ 2 CO(g) with ΔG° = 40,800 - 41.7T cal. I'm supposed to assume all gases are ideal.

Hmm, I remember that for solids, their activity is 1, but wait, in this case, the carbon is in the steel, which is a solid solution. So the activity of carbon in the solid solution would be based on its concentration. Since the steel contains 0.7% carbon by weight, I think the activity (a_C) is 0.007, but wait, no, wait. Wait, carbon in steel is often considered in terms of its concentration, but sometimes in thermodynamics, especially when dealing with solutions, the activity of a component is its mole fraction. But wait, steel is an alloy, so maybe it's more like a solid solution where carbon is dissolved. So the activity would be the mole fraction. But wait, 0.7% by weight is 0.007 in weight percent. But for solids, sometimes the activity is taken as the concentration (like in terms of mole fraction), but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe for carbon in the solid, the activity is 1 because it's a pure solid, but wait, no, because it's in a solid solution, so the activity would be less than 1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies it by considering the activity as the weight fraction, so 0.007. Wait, but in the options, the activities are around 0.4 to 0.75, which are much higher than 0.007, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the given reactions to find the equilibrium conditions. The problem mentions two reactions, so maybe I need to consider both. Let me write them down:

1. C(s) + 2 H2(g) ⇌ CH4(g) ; ΔG1° = -21600 + 26.2T
2. CO2(g) + C(s) ⇌ 2 CO(g) ; ΔG2° = 40800 - 41.7T

I need to find the activity of carbon in the steel, which I think is a_C, and then find the equilibrium percentages of CO and CO2.

Wait, but how are these reactions connected? The first reaction produces CH4, and the second involves CO2 and CO. Maybe the overall reaction involves both. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the activity of carbon in the steel using one reaction and then use that to find the equilibrium for the other reaction.

Wait, but the steel is in equilibrium with a methane-hydrogen mixture. So perhaps the first reaction is the one that's at equilibrium with the given gas mixture. Let me think. The reaction is C(s) + 2 H2 ⇌ CH4. So at equilibrium, the partial pressures of H2 and CH4 are given as 99% H2 and 1% CH4. Wait, but wait, those are volume percentages, which, under ideal gas conditions, correspond to mole fractions. So the mole fractions are X_H2 = 0.99 and X_CH4 = 0.01. But the activity of H2 is its partial pressure, and same for CH4.

Wait, but the reaction quotient Q for this reaction would be based on the partial pressures. The standard reaction Gibbs free energy change is related to the reaction quotient by ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q. At equilibrium, ΔG is zero, so ΔG° = -RT ln K, where K is the equilibrium constant.

Wait, so for the first reaction, the equilibrium constant K would be (P_CH4)/(P_H2)^2. Because the reaction is C + 2 H2 → CH4, so the products over reactants, but since C is a solid, it doesn't appear in K. So K = P_CH4 / (P_H2)^2.

But in this case, the system is at equilibrium with P_H2 and P_CH4 given as 99% and 1% of the total pressure. Since it's at 1 atm, the total pressure is 1 atm. So P_H2 is 0.99 atm, P_CH4 is 0.01 atm.

So the reaction quotient Q would be (0.01) / (0.99)^2. But wait, this is under standard conditions, so maybe we can calculate K using ΔG°.

Wait, the standard Gibbs free energy change ΔG° is given by ΔG° = -RT ln K. So rearranging, ln K = -ΔG°/(RT). But wait, wait, no, because ΔG° = -RT ln K, so ln K = -ΔG°/(RT).

So for the first reaction, at T=1173 K, ΔG1° = -21600 + 26.2 * 1173.

Let me calculate that. 26.2 * 1173 = let's see, 26 * 1173 = 26*(1000 + 173) = 26*1000=26,000 + 26*173. 26*170=4420, 26*3=78, so 4420+78=4498. So 26*1173=26,000 + 4498 = 30,498. Then 0.2 * 1173 = 234.6. So total ΔG1° = -21600 + 30,498 + 234.6? Wait, no, wait, the expression is -21600 + 26.2*T. So 26.2 * 1173 = let me compute 26 * 1173 = 30,498 as before, plus 0.2 * 1173=234.6. So 30,498 + 234.6 = 30,732.6. So ΔG1° = -21600 + 30,732.6 = 9132.6 cal.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check: 26.2 * 1173 = ?

Let me compute 26 * 1173 = 30,498 as before.

0.2 * 1173 = 234.6.

So 26.2 * 1173 = 30,498 + 234.6 = 30,732.6.

Then ΔG1° = -21,600 + 30,732.6 = 9,132.6 cal.

Hmm, that's positive. So ΔG° is positive, meaning the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. But wait, the reaction is at equilibrium, so we can proceed.

So ln K = -ΔG°/(RT). Let's compute that.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K. But ΔG is in calories. Oh, need to convert units. 1 cal = 4.184 J.

So ΔG° = 9,132.6 cal = 9,132.6 * 4.184 J ≈ let's compute that.

9000 *4.184 = 37,656 J. 132.6 *4.184 ≈ 132 *4=528, 132*0.184≈24.3, so total ≈552.3. So total ≈37,656 + 552.3 ≈38,208.3 J.

So ΔG° ≈38,208 J.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T=1173 K.

So ln K = -(38,208) / (8.314 * 1173) ≈ let's compute denominator: 8.314 * 1173 ≈ 8 * 1173 = 9384; 0.314 *1173≈368. So total≈9384 + 368 ≈9752 J/mol.

So ln K ≈ -38208 / 9752 ≈ approximately -3.92.

So K ≈ e^(-3.92) ≈ let's see, e^-4 is about 0.0183, so e^-3.92 ≈ 0.0196.

Wait, but from the given conditions, K should be (0.01) / (0.99)^2. Let's compute that.

0.99^2 ≈ 0.9801. So (0.01)/(0.9801) ≈0.0102. Hmm, but according to our calculation, K ≈0.0196. That doesn't match, which suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the sign. Because ΔG° = -RT ln K, so ln K = -ΔG°/(RT). So if ΔG° is positive, ln K is negative, which makes sense because K would be less than 1.

Wait, but according to the given data, the system is at equilibrium, so K should be (CH4)/(H2)^2. So from the given P_CH4=0.01, P_H2=0.99, so K = (0.01)/(0.99^2) = 0.01 / 0.9801 ≈0.0102.

But according to our calculation using ΔG°, K ≈0.0196, which is higher than 0.0102. That's a discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate ΔG°.

ΔG1° = -21600 + 26.2 * 1173.

Compute 26.2 * 1173:

Let me compute 26 *1173 = 26 *1000=26000; 26*173=26*(170+3)=26*170=4420, 26*3=78 → 4420+78=4498. So 26*1173=26000+4498=30498.

0.2 *1173=234.6.

So 26.2 *1173=30498 + 234.6=30732.6.

So ΔG1° = -21600 +30732.6= 9132.6 cal.

That's correct. So ΔG°=9132.6 cal.

Now, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, which is approximately 1.987 cal/mol·K (since 1 cal=4.184 J, so 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 2 cal/mol·K. Wait, more accurately, 8.314 /4.184 ≈ 1.987 cal/mol·K.

So R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

T=1173 K.

So ln K = -ΔG°/(R T) = -9132.6 / (1.987 * 1173).

Compute denominator: 1.987 *1173 ≈ let's compute 2*1173=2346, but since it's 1.987, which is 2 - 0.013, so 2346 - (0.013 *1173) ≈ 2346 -15.249≈2330.75.

So ln K ≈ -9132.6 / 2330.75 ≈ let's compute that. 9132.6 ÷ 2330.75 ≈ approximately 3.92.

So ln K ≈ -3.92 → K ≈ e^-3.92 ≈0.0196, as before.

But according to the system, K should be 0.0102. So this suggests a discrepancy. So maybe the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the activity of carbon in the steel affects the equilibrium. Because in the reaction C(s) + 2 H2 ⇌ CH4, the activity of C is 1 if it's pure, but since it's in the steel, perhaps a_C is not 1. So the correct expression for K would include a_C.

Wait, the general form is K = (a_CH4) / (a_H2)^2 * (a_C)^-1. Because the reaction is C(s) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g). Since C is a solid, its activity a_C is 1, but wait, no, because the carbon is in the steel, which is a solid solution, so its activity is a_C, not 1. So the equilibrium expression would be K = (a_CH4) / (a_H2)^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a_C using this reaction, and then use that a_C in the second reaction involving CO2 and CO.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the steel is in equilibrium with the methane-hydrogen mixture. So the first reaction is the one where the steel's carbon reacts with H2 to form CH4. So the equilibrium condition for that reaction would involve a_C.

So the equilibrium expression for the first reaction is:

K1 = (a_CH4) / (a_H2)^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

Wait, because the reaction is C(s) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g), so K is [CH4] / [H2]^2 * (a_C)^-1.

But since C is a solid, but in this case, it's part of the steel, which is an alloy, so its activity is a_C, which is not 1. So K1 = (P_CH4) / (P_H2)^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

At equilibrium, the partial pressures are given: P_CH4 = 0.01 atm, P_H2 = 0.99 atm. So K1 = (0.01) / (0.99)^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

But K1 is also equal to exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)).

Wait, no, because ΔG1° is given, so K1 = exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)).

Wait, but earlier I calculated K as 0.0196, but that was without considering a_C. So perhaps K1 is (0.01)/(0.99^2) * (a_C)^{-1} = exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)).

Wait, so let's write it as:

(0.01)/(0.99^2) * (a_C)^{-1} = exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)).

Wait, but earlier I computed exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)) as ≈0.0196. So:

0.01 / (0.99^2) = K1 * a_C.

Wait, no, let me re-express:

K1 = [CH4]/[H2]^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

But K1 = exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)).

So:

(0.01)/(0.99^2) * (a_C)^{-1} = exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)).

Rearranging:

a_C^{-1} = exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)) * (0.99^2) / 0.01.

So a_C = 0.01 / (0.99^2 * exp(-ΔG1°/(RT))).

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach it step by step.

First, calculate K1 as exp(-ΔG1°/(RT)).

We have ΔG1° = 9132.6 cal, R=1.987 cal/mol·K, T=1173 K.

So ln K1 = -9132.6 / (1.987 * 1173) ≈ -9132.6 / 2330 ≈ -3.92.

So K1 ≈ e^{-3.92} ≈ 0.0196.

Now, the equilibrium expression is:

K1 = (P_CH4) / (P_H2)^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

Because the reaction is C(s) + 2 H2 → CH4.

So:

0.0196 = (0.01) / (0.99)^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

Wait, because:

K1 = [CH4]/[H2]^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

So:

0.0196 = (0.01) / (0.99)^2 * (a_C)^{-1}.

Solving for a_C:

a_C^{-1} = 0.0196 * (0.99)^2 / 0.01.

Compute (0.99)^2 ≈0.9801.

So:

a_C^{-1} = 0.0196 * 0.9801 / 0.01 = 0.0196 * 98.01 ≈ 1.922.

So a_C = 1 / 1.922 ≈ 0.520.

Hmm, so the activity of carbon in the steel is approximately 0.52. Looking at the options, option E has activity 0.51, which is close. But let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.47

B:0.65

C:0.48

D:0.60

E:0.51

F:0.75

G:0.55

H:0.58

I:0.68

J:0.42

So 0.52 is closest to option E (0.51). But let's proceed to see if this is correct.

Now, the second part of the problem involves the reaction CO2(g) + C(s) ⇌ 2 CO(g), with ΔG2° =40,800 -41.7T cal.

We need to find the equilibrium volume percentages of CO and CO2 under the same conditions, given that the steel is in equilibrium with the CO-CO2 mixture.

First, let's find the equilibrium constant K2 for this reaction.

ΔG2° =40,800 -41.7*T.

At T=1173 K,

ΔG2° =40800 -41.7*1173.

Compute 41.7 *1173:

40*1173=46,920.

1.7*1173=19,941?

Wait, 1173 *1.7:

1000*1.7=1700.

173*1.7=294.1.

So total 1700+294.1=1994.1.

So 41.7 *1173=46,920 +1994.1=48,914.1 cal.

So ΔG2°=40,800 -48,914.1= -8,114.1 cal.

So ΔG2°= -8,114.1 cal.

Now, calculate ln K2 using ΔG2°.

ln K2 = -ΔG2°/(RT) = 8114.1 / (1.987 * 1173).

Compute denominator: 1.987 *1173 ≈2330 (as before).

So ln K2 ≈8114.1 / 2330 ≈3.48.

So K2 ≈e^{3.48} ≈32.8.

But the reaction is CO2 + C(s) ⇌ 2 CO.

So the equilibrium expression is K2 = (P_CO)^2 / (P_CO2) * (a_C)^{-1}.

Because C is a solid, but its activity is a_C, so it's included.

Wait, but let's write it properly. The reaction is CO2(g) + C(s) → 2 CO(g).

So the equilibrium expression is K2 = (P_CO)^2 / (P_CO2) * (a_C)^{-1}.

Because solids have activity 1, but here, C is in the steel, so its activity is a_C, not 1. Hence, the expression includes a_C.

So K2 = (P_CO)^2 / (P_CO2) * (a_C)^{-1}.

We have K2 ≈32.8.

We can let x be the mole fraction of CO, and y be the mole fraction of CO2 in the equilibrium mixture. Since there are only these two gases, x + y =1.

But wait, no, because the total pressure is 1 atm, and the partial pressures are P_CO = x * P_total, and P_CO2 = y * P_total. So P_CO = x *1 atm = x atm, and P_CO2 = y atm.

So substituting into K2:

K2 = (x^2) / y * (a_C)^{-1}.

We know K2=32.8, a_C≈0.52.

So:

32.8 = (x^2)/y * (1/0.52).

Because (a_C)^{-1} = 1/0.52 ≈1.923.

So:

(x^2)/y * 1.923 =32.8 → (x^2)/y = 32.8 /1.923 ≈17.06.

So (x^2)/y =17.06.

But x + y =1 → y=1−x.

Substituting:

x^2/(1−x) =17.06.

Multiply both sides by (1−x):

x^2 =17.06*(1−x).

Expand:

x^2 =17.06 -17.06x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x^2 +17.06x -17.06=0.

Solving this quadratic equation:

x = [-17.06 ± sqrt(17.06^2 +4*1*17.06)]/(2*1).

Compute discriminant:

17.06^2 ≈291.08.

4*17.06=68.24.

So discriminant ≈291.08 +68.24≈359.32.

sqrt(359.32)≈18.95.

So x= [ -17.06 +18.95 ] /2 ≈ (1.89)/2≈0.945.

The other root would be negative, which we discard.

So x≈0.945 → y=1−0.945=0.055.

So the mole fractions are approximately x=94.5% CO and y=5.5% CO2.

Looking at the options, option E has 94.6% CO and 5.4% CO2, which matches closely.

So the activity of carbon is approximately 0.52, which is closest to option E's 0.51, and the CO and CO2 percentages are 94.6% and 5.4%, which matches option E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium conditions for the given reactions and use the provided thermodynamic data.

### **Step 1: Activity of Carbon in the Steel**
The first reaction is:

\[
\text{C(s, graphite)} + 2\text{H}_2\text{(g)} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_4\text{(g)}
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_1 \) is given by:

\[
K_1 = \frac{P_{\text{CH}_4}}{P_{\text{H}_2}^2} \cdot a_C^{-1}
\]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{CH}_4} = 0.01 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{H}_2} = 0.99 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( a_C \) is the activity of carbon in the steel.

The standard Gibbs free energy change is:

\[
\Delta G_1^\circ = -21,600 + 26.2T \, \text{cal}
\]

At \( T = 1173 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\Delta G_1^\circ = -21,600 + 26.2 \times 1173 = 9,132.6 \, \text{cal}
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_1 \) is related to \( \Delta G_1^\circ \) by:

\[
\ln K_1 = -\frac{\Delta G_1^\circ}{RT}
\]

Where \( R = 1.987 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \). Substituting:

\[
\ln K_1 = -\frac{9,132.6}{1.987 \times 1173} \approx -3.92
\]

\[
K_1 \approx e^{-3.92} \approx 0.0196
\]

From the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_1 = \frac{0.01}{(0.99)^2} \cdot a_C^{-1}
\]

\[
0.0196 = \frac{0.01}{0.9801} \cdot a_C^{-1}
\]

\[
a_C^{-1} = \frac{0.0196 \times 0.9801}{0.01} \approx 1.922
\]

\[
a_C \approx 0.52
\]

Thus, the activity of carbon in the steel is approximately \( 0.52 \).

---

### **Step 2: Equilibrium Volume Percentages of CO and CO₂**
The second reaction is:

\[
\text{CO}_2\text{(g)} + \text{C(s, graphite)} \rightleftharpoons 2\text{CO(g)}
\]

The standard Gibbs free energy change is:

\[
\Delta G_2^\circ = 40,800 - 41.7T \, \text{cal}
\]

At \( T = 1173 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\Delta G_2^\circ = 40,800 - 41.7 \times 1173 = -8,114.1 \, \text{cal}
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_2 \) is:

\[
\ln K_2 = -\frac{\Delta G_2^\circ}{RT}
\]

\[
\ln K_2 = -\frac{-8,114.1}{1.987 \times 1173} \approx 3.48
\]

\[
K_2 \approx e^{3.48} \approx 32.8
\]

The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:

\[
K_2 = \frac{P_{\text{CO}}^2}{P_{\text{CO}_2}} \cdot a_C^{-1}
\]

Let \( x \) be the mole fraction of \( \text{CO} \) and \( y \) be the mole fraction of \( \text{CO}_2 \). Since \( x + y = 1 \), we have:

\[
K_2 = \frac{x^2}{y} \cdot a_C^{-1}
\]

Substituting \( a_C \approx 0.52 \) and \( K_2 \approx 32.8 \):

\[
32.8 = \frac{x^2}{y} \cdot 1.923
\]

\[
\frac{x^2}{y} \approx 17.06
\]

\[
\frac{x^2}{1 - x} = 17.06
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + 17.06x - 17.06 = 0
\]

\[
x \approx 0.945
\]

\[
y = 1 - x \approx 0.055
\]

Thus, the equilibrium volume percentages are approximately \( 94.5\% \, \text{CO} \) and \( 5.5\% \, \text{CO}_2 \).
