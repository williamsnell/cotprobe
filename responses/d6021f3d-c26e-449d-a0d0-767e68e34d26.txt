Question:

 If a ball is thrown into the air with a velocity of $40 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}$, its height in feet $t$ seconds later is given by $y=40 t-16 t^2$. Find the average velocity for the time period beginning when $t=2$ and lasting 0.5 second.

Okay, so I've got this problem here where a ball is thrown into the air with a velocity of 40 ft/s, and its height at time t is given by the equation y = 40t - 16tÂ². The question is asking for the average velocity during the time period starting at t=2 seconds and lasting 0.5 seconds. The options are from A to J, with various negative values, so I'm expecting the average velocity to be negative, which makes sense because the ball is probably going down after reaching its peak.

Alright, average velocity is basically the change in position over the change in time. So, I remember that the formula for average velocity is (y(t2) - y(t1)) / (t2 - t1). In this case, t1 is 2 seconds, and t2 is 2.5 seconds because the time period is 0.5 seconds long. So I need to calculate y at 2 seconds and y at 2.5 seconds, then subtract the two and divide by the time difference.

Let me write that down step by step. First, calculate y at t=2. Plugging into the equation: y(2) = 40*(2) - 16*(2)^2. So that's 80 minus 16*4. 16*4 is 64, so 80 - 64 equals 16 feet. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 40*2 is 80, and 16*(2)^2 is 16*4=64. So 80-64=16. So y(2)=16 feet.

Next, calculate y at t=2.5. So y(2.5) = 40*(2.5) - 16*(2.5)^2. Let me compute each part. 40*2.5 is 100. Then 2.5 squared is 6.25, and 16*6.25 is... let's see, 16*6 is 96, and 16*0.25 is 4, so 96+4=100. So 16*6.25 is 100. So y(2.5)=100 - 100 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. If at t=2, the height is 16 feet, and at t=2.5, it's 0, that would mean the ball hits the ground at 2.5 seconds. Hmm, but wait, maybe that's correct because the ball was thrown upwards and comes back down.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute y(2.5) again. 40*2.5 is indeed 100. (2.5)^2 is 6.25, and 16*6.25 is 100. So 100 - 100 is 0. So y(2.5) is 0. So the height at 2.5 seconds is 0 feet. That means the ball has come back down to the ground.

So now, the average velocity is (y(2.5) - y(2)) divided by (2.5 - 2). So that's (0 - 16) / 0.5. Which is (-16)/0.5. Dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2, so -16*2 = -32 ft/s.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, y(2) is 16, y(2.5) is 0. The change in height is -16 feet over 0.5 seconds. So, average velocity is -32 ft/s. Looking at the options, option B is -32 ft/s. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I did the calculations correctly. Let me compute y(2) again: 40*2=80, 16*(2)^2=64, so 80-64=16. Correct. y(2.5): 40*2.5=100, 16*(2.5)^2=16*6.25=100, so 100-100=0. Correct. So average velocity is (0-16)/(2.5-2) = (-16)/(0.5) = -32 ft/s. Yep, that's right. So option B is the correct answer.

The average velocity is calculated as (y(2.5) - y(2)) / (2.5 - 2). 

y(2) = 40*2 - 16*(2)^2 = 80 - 64 = 16 ft.  
y(2.5) = 40*2.5 - 16*(2.5)^2 = 100 - 100 = 0 ft.  

Average velocity = (0 - 16) / 0.5 = -32 ft/s.  

Answer: B
