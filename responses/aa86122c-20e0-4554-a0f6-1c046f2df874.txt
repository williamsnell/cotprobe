Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about finding the velocity u of a flow in terms of the pressure p, given that u is a function of x only, and v and w are zero. The flow is steady and inviscid. Hmm, okay, so I remember that in inviscid flows, viscosity is neglected, which usually means we can apply Bernoulli's equation.

Wait, Bernoulli's equation relates the pressure and velocity in a fluid. The equation is something like p + ½ρv² + ρgz = constant along a streamline. Since the flow is steady and inviscid, Bernoulli's equation should definitely apply here.

But wait, let me think about the setup. The velocity components are given as u = u(x), v = 0, w = 0. So this is a one-dimensional flow along the x-axis. That simplifies things because there's no variation in y or z directions. So the flow is entirely in the x-direction.

Now, in a steady flow, the Bernoulli equation along a streamline (which, in this case, would be along x) should hold. Since the flow is one-dimensional and steady, the equation should be applicable. Also, since it's inviscid, there are no energy losses, so the equation holds without any additional terms.

Let me write down Bernoulli's equation for this case. The general form is:

p + ½ ρ u² + ρ g h = constant

Where h is the height potential. But in this problem, I'm not given any information about the height or variation in z. Wait, the problem says u = u(x), v = w = 0, but it doesn't specify if the flow is in a gravitational field or not. Oh, but the options include terms with gz, so I think gravity is acting in the z-direction. So, h would be the z-coordinate.

But wait, in Bernoulli's equation, each term represents energy per unit volume. The pressure term is p, the kinetic term is ½ ρ u², and the potential term is ρ g z. So, if the flow is along the x-direction, the potential term would be due to the height in the z-direction. But how does that relate here?

Wait, maybe I should consider if there's a variation in z. If the flow is along x, but the height z is changing along x, then the potential term would come into play. Alternatively, if the flow is horizontal (z is constant), then the potential term would be zero. But the options have terms with gz, so I think the problem might involve a change in height.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any relation between x and z. Hmm, maybe I should assume that the flow is in the x-direction, and the potential term is a function of z, which is perpendicular to the flow. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a vertical flow, where movement is along x, which is vertical, so z is changing. Hmm, no, because u is a function of x, not z. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. Since the flow is along x, and v and w are zero, the variation is only in x. So any change in height (z) would affect the pressure. But without any information about how z varies with x, I might need to make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a horizontal plane, so z is constant. But then the potential term would be zero, which would simplify Bernoulli's equation.

Wait, but the options include terms with gz, which suggests that the potential term is present. So perhaps the flow is such that the height z varies along the direction of the flow (x). That is, the flow is along a vertical direction, so as x increases, z increases or decreases. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the flow is in a gravitational field, and the potential term is due to the height.

Wait, maybe I should consider the simplest case where the flow is horizontal, so z is constant, but the pressure varies along x. Then the potential term (ρ g z) would be constant along the flow, so it can be neglected when considering the difference in Bernoulli's equation along the streamline.

Wait, but Bernoulli's equation says that the sum of the three terms is constant along a streamline. If the flow is horizontal, then z doesn't change along the flow, so the potential term is constant. Therefore, when we write Bernoulli's equation, the variation in pressure along the x-direction would relate to the velocity variation.

But the problem is asking to express u in terms of p, so perhaps the pressure is given as a function, and we can relate u and p.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Euler equation for inviscid flow. The Euler equation is the equation of motion for inviscid fluids. In the x-direction, the Euler equation would be:

∂p/∂x = -ρ ( ∂u/∂t + u ∂u/∂x )

But since the flow is steady, ∂u/∂t = 0. So it simplifies to:

∂p/∂x = -ρ u ∂u/∂x

Hmm, but that's a differential equation. If I can integrate that, maybe I can find u in terms of p.

Wait, but without knowing how p varies with x, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the flow is such that the pressure gradient is balanced by gravity. Wait, maybe it's a hydrostatic situation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a flow where the pressure is given as a function, and the velocity is determined by that pressure. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: in a steady, inviscid flow with u = u(x) and v = w = 0, we can apply Bernoulli's equation along the streamline (which is along x). So the equation would be:

p + ½ ρ u² + ρ g h = constant

But without knowing the variation in h (which is z), I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the flow is such that the change in potential energy is accounted for by the pressure.

Wait, maybe I should consider the case where the flow is driven by gravity. Suppose the flow is in the x-direction, which is also the vertical direction (so x = z). Then h would be x, and the potential term would be ρ g x. But I'm not sure if that's the setup here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a simple case where the flow is along the x-axis, and the potential energy term is due to height z, which is perpendicular to the flow. But in that case, how does z relate to x? Without more information, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the potential term is zero, meaning the flow is horizontal. Then Bernoulli's equation simplifies to:

p + ½ ρ u² = constant

If I can find the constant, perhaps I can express u in terms of p. But without knowing the constant, I'm stuck. Alternatively, maybe the problem is looking for an expression where the pressure and velocity are related without considering potential energy. But that doesn't seem right because the options have terms with gz.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that the flow is in a gravitational field, and the pressure is due to both the velocity and the height. If the flow is steady and inviscid, then Bernoulli's equation applies.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in two dimensions, but the flow is along x, and the height variation is along z. So the potential term is ρ g z. But without knowing how z varies with x, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure p is a function of z, but the velocity u is a function of x. That doesn't quite fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options again. The options involve terms like (2gz)/ρ or (2p)/ρgz, etc. So perhaps the problem is using Bernoulli's equation in a way that combines pressure and potential energy.

Wait, let me think of the simplest case. Suppose the flow is horizontal (so z is constant), and the pressure varies along x. Then the potential term would be constant, and Bernoulli's equation would be p + ½ ρ u² = constant. But the problem is asking for u in terms of p. Without knowing the constant, I can't get u purely in terms of p. So perhaps the problem is considering a scenario where the potential term is included.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a flow where the pressure gradient is such that p is related to the potential energy as well. Let me try to write Bernoulli's equation between two points where the potential term changes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure p is measured relative to the hydrostatic pressure. So, the total pressure would be p + ρ g z. Then, using Bernoulli's equation, p_total + ½ ρ u² = constant.

Wait, that could make sense. So, if the total pressure is p + ρ g z, then Bernoulli's equation would be:

(p + ρ g z) + ½ ρ u² = constant

Assuming that the flow is such that the constant is the same everywhere. If I can rearrange this, then ½ ρ u² = constant - (p + ρ g z). But without knowing the constant, I can't find u in terms of p. Unless the constant is taken as the value at a particular point where the velocity is zero, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a situation where the pressure p is the dynamic pressure plus the static pressure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering a flow where the pressure gradient is the only force acting on the fluid. But in that case, without gravity, the equation would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy balance. The kinetic energy per unit mass is (u²)/2, and the potential energy per unit mass is g z. The pressure p is force per unit area, which relates to the potential energy as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the options again. The correct option should involve the square root of something divided by rho, perhaps.

Looking at the options:

A: sqrt(2gz/ρ)
B: sqrt(2p/(ρgz))
C: sqrt(2gz/(ρ+p))
D: sqrt( (p + ρgz)/(2ρ) )
E: sqrt( (2gz - ρ)/ρ )
F: sqrt( p/(2ρgz) )
G: sqrt( (ρ-2gz)/ρ )
H: sqrt( (2gz + ρ)/ρ )
I: sqrt( (ρgz)/(2p) )
J: sqrt( (2g - ρ)/ρ )

Hmm, option D looks like it has p and ρgz in the numerator. So, perhaps it's derived from Bernoulli's equation where p + ρgz is part of the equation, and then ½ ρ u² equals that.

Wait, if I rearrange Bernoulli's equation as ½ ρ u² = constant - (p + ρ g z), then u would be sqrt( 2*(constant - p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But without knowing the constant, this isn't directly helpful. Unless the constant is taken as zero, which doesn't make sense physically.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure p is due to the kinetic energy and potential energy. So, p = ½ ρ u² + ρ g z. Then, solving for u would give u = sqrt( 2*(p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But that's not one of the options. Wait, looking at option D: sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2ρ) ). That would imply p + ρ g z = ½ ρ u², which would mean u² = 2(p + ρ g z)/ρ. So u = sqrt( 2(p + ρ g z)/ρ ), which is option D.

Wait, but that would mean that the total pressure p includes the potential term. So perhaps the problem is considering that p is the total pressure, including the effect of gravity. So, in that case, Bernoulli's equation would be p + ½ ρ u² = constant. If I set the constant as zero, which isn't realistic, but perhaps in this problem, it's being done. Then, ½ ρ u² = p, so u = sqrt(2p/ρ). But that's not one of the options. Oh wait, option B is sqrt(2p/(ρ g z)), which is different.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. If the flow is steady and inviscid, and the velocity is u = u(x), then the Euler equation in the x-direction is:

∂p/∂x = -ρ ( ∂u/∂t + u ∂u/∂x )

But since it's steady, ∂u/∂t = 0, so:

∂p/∂x = -ρ u ∂u/∂x

Which can be rewritten as:

∂p/∂x + ρ u ∂u/∂x = 0

Integrating this equation would give the relation between p and u. But without knowing the form of u(x), it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the pressure gradient is balanced by gravity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in a fluid at rest, the pressure gradient is balanced by gravity, so ∂p/∂z = -ρ g. But in this case, the flow is along x, so maybe the pressure gradient in the x-direction is zero, implying that ∂p/∂x = 0. That would mean that p is constant along x, which would make the Euler equation:

0 = -ρ u ∂u/∂x → ∂u/∂x = 0 → u is constant along x.

But that would mean u is uniform, and then you can't determine u from p because p is also uniform. That doesn't seem to fit the question, which asks to express u in terms of p.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the options again. The correct answer is among them, and I need to find which one makes sense.

Option D: u = sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2ρ) )

If I square both sides, I get u² = (p + ρ g z)/(2ρ) → 2 ρ u² = p + ρ g z.

Which could come from Bernoulli's equation if the constant is (p + ρ g z), but that doesn't make sense unless the constant is being set to zero, which isn't the case.

Wait, another approach: Bernoulli's equation in the form p + ½ ρ u² = ρ g z + constant. If the flow is such that the pressure and velocity are related in a way that the potential energy term is dominant, perhaps the equation simplifies to p = ρ g z - ½ ρ u². But that would give u² = 2(ρ g z - p)/ρ, which isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, if the flow is such that the pressure p is entirely due to the potential energy, then p = ρ g z, but that would ignore the kinetic term. But that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure p is the total pressure, which includes both the dynamic and static pressures. So p = ½ ρ u² + ρ g z. Then solving for u gives u = sqrt( 2(p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But that's not an option. Alternatively, if the problem is considering that p is the static pressure, then the total pressure would be p + ½ ρ u² = ρ g z. Then u² = 2(ρ g z - p)/ρ → u = sqrt( 2(ρ g z - p)/ρ ). Again, not matching any options.

Wait, looking at option I: sqrt( (ρ g z)/(2p) ). Squaring gives u² = (ρ g z)/(2p). So p = (ρ g z)/(2u²). Doesn't fit with Bernoulli's equation.

Option F: sqrt( p/(2ρ g z) ). Squaring gives u² = p/(2ρ g z). So p = 2 ρ g z u². Again, not matching.

Option B: sqrt( 2p/(ρ g z) ). Squaring: u² = 2p/(ρ g z). So p = (ρ g z u²)/2. Hmm, that would suggest p is proportional to u² and z, which could come from Bernoulli's equation if the potential term is significant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure p is the result of both velocity and gravity. So, p = ½ ρ u² + ρ g z. Then, solving for u gives u = sqrt( 2(p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But none of the options have that form.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by assuming that the potential energy term is negligible compared to the pressure term, but I don't think that's the case here since the options include terms with gz.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different form of Bernoulli's equation, such as between two points where the potential energy changes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the flow is such that the pressure p varies with x, and the height z is varying along x. For example, imagine a flow going up a hill; as x increases, z increases. Then, the Bernoulli equation would relate p, u, and z.

But without knowing the specific variation of z with x, it's hard to proceed. However, the problem gives u = u(x), so perhaps we can assume that z varies with x in a way that allows us to relate p and u.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the change in potential energy is balanced by the pressure gradient. So, the pressure gradient along x would be equal to the gravitational force in the z-direction. But that doesn't quite make sense because the directions are perpendicular.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the flow is in a gravitational field, and the pressure gradient in the x-direction is related to the gravitational acceleration. But without more information, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe I should think about energy conservation. The total mechanical energy (pressure energy + kinetic energy + potential energy) should be constant. So, p/ρ + ½ u² + g z = constant.

Rearranging, ½ u² = constant - (p/ρ + g z). Then, u = sqrt( 2 (constant - p/ρ - g z) ). But without knowing the constant, I can't express u solely in terms of p.

Unless, perhaps, the problem is considering that the constant is zero. That would give u = sqrt( 2 (-p/ρ - g z) ). But that would give a negative under the square root unless p is negative, which isn't physical.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about dimensional analysis. The velocity u should have dimensions of [L]/[T]. Let's check the options:

Option A: sqrt(2 g z / ρ). Let's see dimensions. g has [L]/[T]^2. z is [L]. ρ is [M]/[L]^3. So numerator: [L/T²] * [L] = [L]^2/[T]^2. Denominator: [M]/[L]^3. So overall: ( [L]^2/[T]^2 ) / ( [M]/[L]^3 ) ) = [L]^5 [T}^-2 [M}^-1. Taking square root gives [L]^(5/2) [T}^-1 [M}^-0.5. Not matching [L]/[T]. So option A is incorrect dimensionally.

Option B: sqrt(2p/(ρ g z)). p has [M]/[L][T]^2. Denominator: [M]/[L]^3 * [L]/[T]^2 * [L] → [M][L]^3/[T]^2. So numerator / denominator: ([M]/[L][T]^2) / ([M][L]^3/[T]^2) ) = 1/[L]^4. Square root: 1/[L]^2. Not matching velocity dimensions. So B is out.

Option C: sqrt(2 g z / (ρ + p)). Hmm, p is [M]/[L][T]^2, ρ is [M]/[L]^3. So denominator has [M]/[L]^3 + [M]/[L][T]^2. These have different dimensions, so the expression is dimensionally inconsistent. So C is out.

Option D: sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2 ρ) ). Let's check dimensions. p is [M]/[L][T]^2. ρ g z: [M]/[L]^3 * [L]/[T]^2 * [L] = [M]/[L][T]^2. So numerator is [M]/[L][T]^2 + [M]/[L][T]^2 = [M]/[L][T]^2. Denominator: 2 ρ → [M]/[L]^3. So overall: ([M]/[L][T]^2) / ([M]/[L]^3) ) = [L]^2/[T]^2. Square root: [L]/[T], which matches velocity. So D has correct dimensions.

Option E: sqrt( (2 g z - ρ)/ρ ). Dimensions: 2 g z is [L]/[T]^2 * [L] = [L]^2/[T]^2. ρ is [M]/[L]^3. So numerator is [L]^2/[T]^2 - [M]/[L]^3. Mixing dimensions, so invalid. E is out.

Option F: sqrt( p/(2 ρ g z) ). p: [M]/[L][T]^2. Denominator: 2 ρ g z → [M]/[L]^3 * [L]/[T]^2 * [L] = [M]/[L][T]^2. So numerator / denominator: ([M]/[L][T]^2) / ([M]/[L][T]^2) ) = dimensionless. Square root is still dimensionless. Not matching velocity. So F is out.

Option G: sqrt( (ρ - 2 g z)/ρ ). ρ is [M]/[L]^3. 2 g z is [L]/[T]^2 * [L] = [L]^2/[T]^2. Subtracting [M]/[L]^3 and [L]^2/[T]^2 is dimensionally inconsistent. G is out.

Option H: sqrt( (2 g z + ρ)/ρ ). 2 g z is [L]^2/[T]^2, ρ is [M]/[L]^3. Adding terms with different dimensions, invalid. H is out.

Option I: sqrt( (ρ g z)/(2 p) ). ρ g z: [M]/[L]^3 * [L]/[T]^2 * [L] = [M]/[L][T]^2. p: [M]/[L][T]^2. So numerator / denominator: ([M]/[L][T]^2) / ([M]/[L][T]^2) ) = dimensionless. Square root is dimensionless. Not velocity. I is out.

Option J: sqrt( (2 g - ρ)/ρ ). 2g is [L]/[T]^2. ρ is [M]/[L]^3. Mixing dimensions, invalid. J is out.

So from dimensional analysis, only options D and maybe others have correct dimensions. But wait, option D's expression is sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2 ρ) ). So it's dimensionally correct, but does it make sense physically?

If I think about Bernoulli's equation, p + ½ ρ u² + ρ g z = constant. If we rearrange, ½ ρ u² = constant - p - ρ g z. So u² = 2 (constant - p - ρ g z)/ρ. But option D suggests u² = (p + ρ g z)/(2 ρ), which would imply that ½ ρ u² = p + ρ g z. But that would mean the constant is p + ρ g z, which doesn't align with Bernoulli's equation unless the other terms are zero, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express Bernoulli's equation:

p + ½ ρ u² + ρ g z = C

If we solve for u, we get u = sqrt( 2 (C - p - ρ g z)/ρ )

But none of the options have this form. However, option D is u = sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2 ρ) ), which would require that C - p - ρ g z = (p + ρ g z)/2. That would mean C = (3/2)(p + ρ g z), which doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy term is negligible, so p + ½ ρ u² ≈ C. Then, u = sqrt( 2 (C - p)/ρ ). But without knowing C, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the flow is such that the potential energy term is zero, meaning z is constant. Then, Bernoulli's equation becomes p + ½ ρ u² = C. But again, without knowing C, I can't express u solely in terms of p.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is misprinted, and the correct expression is u = sqrt(2p/ρ), which would be option not listed. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is in a gravitational field, and the pressure p is measured relative to a certain point. So, the total pressure would be p + ρ g z, and Bernoulli's equation would then be (p + ρ g z) + ½ ρ u² = constant. If the constant is zero, then u = sqrt( 2 ( - (p + ρ g z) ) / ρ ), which would give an imaginary velocity, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the physical situation again. The flow is steady and inviscid, u = u(x), v=w=0. So it's a one-dimensional flow along x.

If the flow is along x, and assuming that the variation in z is negligible, then the potential term can be ignored. Then, Bernoulli's equation becomes p + ½ ρ u² = constant. But again, without knowing the constant, I can't express u in terms of p alone.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate u in terms of p. So perhaps the pressure p is the total pressure, which includes the potential term. So, p = p_total = p_static + p_dynamic + p_potential. But that's not standard terminology.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the pressure p is the dynamic pressure, so p = ½ ρ u². Then, u = sqrt(2p/ρ), which isn't an option. But option B is sqrt(2p/(ρ g z)), which would be sqrt( (2p)/ (ρ g z) ). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different form of Bernoulli's equation, such as between two points where the potential energy changes. For example, if the flow is such that at a certain point, the pressure is p and velocity is u, and at another point, the height is z, then the equation would relate p, u, and z.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the flow is such that the pressure p is related to the height z via gravity. For example, in hydrostatic equilibrium, p = ρ g z. But then, if the flow is moving, the kinetic energy would come into play. So, p = ρ g z + ½ ρ u². Then, solving for u gives u = sqrt( 2 (p - ρ g z)/ρ ). Again, not matching any options.

Wait, but looking back at option D: u = sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2 ρ) ). If I square both sides, u² = (p + ρ g z)/(2 ρ). Rearranged, that would mean p + ρ g z = 2 ρ u². Or, p = 2 ρ u² - ρ g z. That doesn't fit with Bernoulli's equation unless the potential term is being added incorrectly.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Since the flow is along x, and the velocity is u = u(x), perhaps the pressure gradient in the x-direction is related to the velocity. Using Euler's equation in the x-direction:

∂p/∂x = -ρ u ∂u/∂x

Assuming steady flow, so ∂u/∂t = 0.

This is a first-order PDE, and integrating it would give p as a function of u. But without knowing the specific form of u(x), I can't proceed. However, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pressure gradient is such that ∂p/∂x = 0, implying that p is constant along x. Then, from Euler's equation, 0 = -ρ u ∂u/∂x → ∂u/∂x = 0 → u is constant along x. But that would mean u doesn't change with x, which contradicts u = u(x) unless u is a constant function.

But the problem states u = u(x), which implies it varies with x. So, if ∂p/∂x = 0, then u must be constant, which contradicts. Therefore, ∂p/∂x cannot be zero. So, there must be a non-zero pressure gradient.

But without knowing how p varies with x, I can't find u(x). Therefore, perhaps the problem is making a simplifying assumption, such as assuming that the pressure is hydrostatic, i.e., p = ρ g z. But then, if p = ρ g z, and using Bernoulli's equation, p + ½ ρ u² = constant → ρ g z + ½ ρ u² = C. Solving for u, u = sqrt( 2 (C - ρ g z)/ρ ). But again, without knowing C, I can't express u solely in terms of p.

Wait, but if p = ρ g z, then z = p/(ρ g). Substituting into the equation, u = sqrt( 2 (C - p)/ρ ). Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure p is the total pressure, which includes both the dynamic and potential terms. So, p = ½ ρ u² + ρ g z. Then, solving for u gives u = sqrt( 2 (p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But this isn't an option either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using energy conservation in a different way. If the flow is such that the change in potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, then the pressure might be related to both.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the options again. The only dimensionally correct option is D. So perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that option D doesn't align with Bernoulli's equation. However, given that D is dimensionally correct and the others are not, perhaps D is the intended answer despite the possible misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure p is the result of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. So, p = ½ ρ u² + ρ g z. Then, solving for u gives u = sqrt( 2 (p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But that's not option D. Option D has u = sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2 ρ) ), which would imply p + ρ g z = ½ ρ u². That would mean p = ½ ρ u² - ρ g z, which doesn't make physical sense because pressure can't be negative in this context unless u is large enough, but it's not a standard form.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier dimensional analysis. Let me double-check option D:

Option D: u = sqrt( (p + ρ g z)/(2ρ) )

So, inside the square root: (p + ρ g z) has dimensions [M]/[L][T]^2 + [M]/[L][T]^2 = [M]/[L][T]^2.

Divide by 2ρ → [M]/[L]^3.

So, [M]/[L][T]^2 divided by [M]/[L]^3 gives ([M]/[L][T]^2) * ([L]^3/[M])) = [L]^2/[T]^2.

Square root: [L]/[T], which is correct for velocity. So D is dimensionally correct.

But physically, it doesn't align with Bernoulli's equation unless the equation is being applied differently. Maybe the problem is considering that the total energy is (p + ρ g z), and the kinetic energy is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure p is the result of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. So, p = ½ ρ u² + ρ g z. Then, solving for u gives u = sqrt( 2 (p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But that's not option D.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and the correct expression is u = sqrt(2p/ρ), which would be the standard result for a flow where pressure is the dynamic pressure. But that's not an option. The closest is option B: sqrt(2p/(ρ g z)), which isn't the same.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the pressure p is the result of gravity and velocity, so p = ρ g z + ½ ρ u². Then, solving for u gives u = sqrt( 2 (p - ρ g z)/ρ ). But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that option D is the correct one, given that it's dimensionally correct and the others are not. So, despite the earlier confusion, I'll go with option D.
</think>

The problem involves determining the velocity \( u \) of a steady, inviscid flow in terms of the pressure \( p \), given that \( u = u(x) \), \( v = 0 \), and \( w = 0 \). The flow is one-dimensional along the \( x \)-axis, and the options provided suggest that the solution may involve Bernoulli's equation or dimensional analysis.

1. **Bernoulli's Equation**: For a steady, inviscid flow, Bernoulli's equation is applicable:
   \[
   p + \frac{1}{2} \rho u^2 + \rho g z = \text{constant}
   \]
   However, the problem does not provide sufficient information about the variation of \( z \) with \( x \), making it unclear how to directly apply the equation.

2. **Dimensional Analysis**: The velocity \( u \) must have dimensions of \( \text{[L]/[T]} \). Each option was analyzed for dimensional consistency:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect dimensions.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect dimensions.
   - **Option C**: Dimensional inconsistency due to mixed terms.
   - **Option D**: Dimensionally correct, as it satisfies \( \text{[L]/[T]} \).
   - **Options E–J**: Incorrect dimensions or inconsistent terms.

3. **Physical Interpretation**: While option D does not align perfectly with the standard form of Bernoulli's equation, it is the only dimensionally consistent option. This suggests that the problem may implicitly assume a specific relationship between \( p \), \( u \), and \( z \) that leads to the given form.

### Conclusion:
Given the dimensional analysis and the lack of a more physically consistent option, **option D** is the most plausible answer.
