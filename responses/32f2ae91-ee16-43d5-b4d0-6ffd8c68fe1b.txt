Okay, so I've got this question about federalism, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that federalism is a system of government where power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units, like states or provinces. It's not a one-size-fits-all system; instead, it's about sharing power. So the key here is understanding the division of power.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one:

A: A system where the national government controls all subnational units. Hmm, that sounds more like centralism or unitary government, where the central authority has all the control. So A is probably not federalism.

B: The division of a country's power into national and subnational units. This sounds right because federalism is about dividing power between different levels. So this could be the correct answer.

C: A government system where power is primarily held by subnational units. That would be the opposite of a strong central government, maybe like a confederation. But federalism has a balance, so this might not be exactly right because it's about primary power, not a division.

D: The division of government power among different political parties. No, that's more about how power is distributed within the same level, not between national and subnational units.

E: The division of national power into different branches of government. That's about separation of powers, like the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Not related to federalism, which is about levels of government, not branches.

F: The accumulation of all government power within a single unit. That again sounds like unitary government, where only the central government has power. Opposite of federalism.

G: A government in which the political leader is also the religious leader. That's more about the type of leadership, like a theocracy, not about the division of power.

H: The sharing of power between the national government and international organizations. That's more about external relations, like how a country might share power with the EU or UN, but not the internal division between national and subnational units.

I: The concentration of government power in the hands of a small group of people. That's about oligarchy or autocracy, not federalism.

J: The transfer of power from national to subnational units. This seems like it's moving power downward, which might happen in federal systems, but it's not the definition. Federalism is about the division, not just transferring.

So, putting it all together, option B best defines federalism because it's about dividing power into national and subnational units, which is the essence of federalism.
