Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the minimum photon energy required to create a real electron-positron pair. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that creating an electron-positron pair requires energy because you're producing two particles from a photon. Each particle has rest mass energy, so the photon must have enough energy to account for both. 

Wait, what's the rest mass energy of an electron? Oh right, it's about 0.511 MeV per electron. Since we're making a pair, that's two electrons (or an electron and a positron), so the total energy needed would be twice that. 

Let me calculate that. 0.511 MeV times 2 equals 1.022 MeV. Oh wait, but the options are in electron volts, so 1.022 MeV is the same as 1.022 × 10^6 eV. Looking at the options, option J is 1.022 × 10^6 eV. That seems right.

But wait, I should double-check. Is there any other factor I'm missing? Like, does the photon need more energy because of relativistic effects or something? Oh, right, when a photon creates a pair, it needs to have enough energy to create both particles, and because the pair must be at rest in the center-of-momentum frame, the photon's energy in that frame must be at least twice the rest mass energy. 

So yes, the minimum energy is 2 * m_e c^2. Oh wait, m_e is the electron rest mass, which is 0.511 MeV, so that's correct. So the photon needs at least 1.022 MeV, which is option J. 

Looking back at the options, J is 1.022 × 10^6 eV, which matches. So I think that's the right answer.

The minimum photon energy required to create an electron-positron pair is twice the rest mass energy of an electron. The rest mass energy of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the total energy needed is 2 × 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV, which is equivalent to 1.022 × 10⁶ eV. This matches option J.

Answer: J
