Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about thermal expansion. Let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a copper bar expanding when heated. I remember that materials expand when heated because the atoms vibrate more and take up more space. So the formula for linear expansion must come into play here.

The problem states that the copper bar is 8.0 feet long at 68°F, and the linear expansivity (which I think is the coefficient of linear expansion) is 9.4 × 10^-6 per degree Fahrenheit. We need to find out how much the length increases when the temperature is raised to 110°F.

Wait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. I think the formula for linear expansion is delta L equals alpha multiplied by L0 multiplied by delta T. So, ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT.

Breaking it down, α is the coefficient of linear expansion, L0 is the original length, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Right, so I need to calculate ΔT first.

The initial temperature is 68°F, and the final is 110°F. So ΔT = 110 - 68 = 42°F. That seems straightforward.

Now, putting the numbers into the formula: ΔL = (9.4 × 10^-6) * 8.0 ft * 42°F. Let me do the multiplication step by step.

First, 9.4 × 10^-6 is a small number. Let's see, 9.4 times 8 is 75.2, and then times 42. Wait, no, I think I should multiply all three together. So, 9.4e-6 * 8 = 75.2e-6, which is 0.0000752. Then multiply by 42. 0.0000752 * 42.

Hmm, 0.0000752 times 40 is 0.003008, and 0.0000752 times 2 is 0.0001504. Adding those together gives 0.003008 + 0.0001504 = 0.0031584 ft.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options like 0.0032, 0.0035, etc. So 0.0031584 is approximately 0.00316 ft, which rounds to 0.0032 ft. That would be option A.

But let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Let's do it another way. 9.4e-6 * 8.0 = 9.4 *8 =75.2, so 75.2e-6. Then multiply by 42: 75.2e-6 *42 = (75.2 *42) e-6.

Calculating 75 *42 is 3150, and 0.2 *42 is 8.4, so total is 3158.4. So 3158.4e-6 ft. Now, 3158.4e-6 is the same as 0.0031584 ft, which again is about 0.00316 ft or 0.0032 ft when rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, but some options might have more precise numbers. Let me check the options again. Option A is 0.0032, which matches my calculation. But what about if I made a mistake in the formula? Did I use the right units?

Yes, all units are in feet and Fahrenheit, and the coefficient is per Fahrenheit degree, so the units should cancel out correctly. So I think option A is the correct answer.

The increase in length of the copper bar when heated is calculated using the formula for linear expansion: ΔL = α * L₀ * ΔT. The change in temperature (ΔT) is 42°F, and substituting the given values into the formula yields an increase in length of approximately 0.0032 ft. 

Answer: A
