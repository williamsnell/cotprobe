Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the autoprotolysis of liquid ammonia. Hmm, autoprotolysis... I remember that's when a molecule donates a proton to another molecule of the same substance. So for ammonia, that would be something like NH3 reacting with another NH3 to form NH4+ and NH2^-.

The question gives me the equilibrium constant, K_NH3, which is 10^-22. And the problem is asking how many molecules of ammonia are ionized in 1 mole of ammonia. They also mention the density is 0.771 g/mL. Oh wait, density is probably to find the volume, so maybe I need to find the concentration first.

Wait, let me think. The autoprotolysis reaction is 2 NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + NH2^-. So the equilibrium expression would be K = [NH4+][NH2^-] / [NH3]^2. But wait, I'm not sure if the reaction is written correctly. Maybe it's NH3 + NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + NH2^-? Yeah, that makes sense because each NH3 donates a proton, so two molecules reacting.

So the equilibrium expression would be K = ([NH4+][NH2^-]) / ([NH3]^2). Since ammonia is a weak base, the ionization isn't very high, so the concentration of NH3 is almost the same as the initial concentration.

Wait, but the problem is about how many molecules are ionized in 1 mole of ammonia. So I probably need to find the concentration of NH3 that ionizes, then multiply by the number of molecules, Avogadro's number.

But first, maybe I should find the concentration of ammonia. Since 1 mole of NH3, and the density is 0.771 g/mL. The molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol. So 1 mole is 17 g. The volume would be mass divided by density. So 17 g / 0.771 g/mL = approximately 22.05 mL, which is 0.02205 L.

So the concentration would be 1 mole / 0.02205 L ≈ 45.37 M. Oh, that's option A in the answer choices: 45.3 M molecules. But wait, no, that's the concentration. The number of molecules would be moles multiplied by Avogadro's number. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the problem says if K_NH3 is 10^-22, which is a very small number, so the extent of ionization is small. So we can model this using the assumption that x is much smaller than the initial concentration.

Let me set up the ICE table. Let's say the initial concentration of NH3 is c, which is 45.37 M as calculated. At equilibrium, the concentration of NH3 would be c - 2x, and [NH4+] and [NH2^-] would each be x. Wait, wait, because each NH3 molecule produces one NH4+ and one NH2^-, so for every 2 moles of NH3 that react, you get 1 mole each of NH4+ and NH2^-. So yes, [NH4+] = x and [NH2^-] = x, and [NH3] = c - 2x.

But since K is so small, 1e-22, x will be very small compared to c, so 2x is negligible. So [NH3] ≈ c. Then K ≈ (x^2) / c^2 = 1e-22.

So x^2 = K * c^2. So x = sqrt(K * c^2) = c * sqrt(K). Let me compute that.

c is 45.37 M. K is 1e-22. So sqrt(K) is sqrt(1e-22) = 1e-11. So x = 45.37 * 1e-11 = 4.537e-10 M.

So the concentration of NH4+ and NH2^- is 4.537e-10 M each. But wait, the question is about how many molecules are ionized in 1 mole. So, since 1 mole is in the solution, the number of ionized molecules would be the number of moles of NH4+ or NH2^- multiplied by Avogadro's number.

Wait, because each ionization produces 1 mole of NH4+ and 1 mole of NH2^-, so total moles of ionized NH3 would be 2x. Because each reaction consumes 2 moles of NH3 to produce 1 mole each of NH4+ and NH2^-. So for each mole of NH4+ or NH2^-, 2 moles of NH3 are consumed. So the total moles of NH3 ionized would be 2x, but wait, no, because each NH3 molecule can only donate once. Wait, perhaps each mole of NH3 that donates a proton becomes NH4+, and each that accepts becomes NH2^-. So the number of ionized molecules is 2x per 2 moles of NH3, so each x corresponds to 1 mole of NH3 ionized. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each molecule that donates a proton becomes NH4+, and each that accepts becomes NH2^-. So the total number of ionized molecules is x + x = 2x, but in terms of moles, since each x is in terms of concentration (mol/L), I need to find the total moles in 1 mole of solution.

Wait, let me think again. For every mole of NH3 that donates a proton, it becomes NH4+. Similarly, another mole of NH3 accepts a proton and becomes NH2^-. So, each reaction consumes 2 moles of NH3 and produces 1 mole each of NH4+ and NH2^-.

So the extent of reaction is x, so the total moles of NH3 ionized is 2x. But wait, the initial moles are 1, and the solution is 45.37 M in 0.02205 L. So x is in moles per liter. To find the total number of ions, perhaps I should calculate the moles of each ion and sum them, but the question is about how many molecules of ammonia are ionized. So each ionization event involves two ammonia molecules: one becomes NH4+, the other becomes NH2^-. So each x represents 1e-10 M of each ion, but in terms of moles, for each x, how many molecules are involved?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many molecules are ionized per liter. So x is 4.537e-10 M, which is 4.537e-10 moles per liter of NH4+. Since the solution is 45.37 M, the volume is 0.02205 L. So moles of NH4+ would be 4.537e-10 * 0.02205 ≈ 1.00e-11 moles. Similarly, moles of NH2^- would be the same. So total moles of ions would be 2 * 1.00e-11 = 2.00e-11 moles. But wait, each ion comes from one NH3 molecule, so the total number of ionized NH3 molecules is 2x, which is 2 * (4.537e-10) * 0.02205 ≈ 2 * 1.00e-11 = 2.00e-11 moles.

Wait, but 2.00e-11 moles of NH3 are ionized. To find the number of molecules, multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules/mol). So 2.00e-11 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 1.204e13 molecules. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are A:45.3M, B:1e10, C:2.66e11, D:7.5e8, E:5.55e22, F:1.2e20, G:8.99e14, H:3.01e12, I:4.42e-13, J:6.02e23.

Wait, my calculation gives around 1.2e13 molecules, which is close to option H (3.01e12) but not exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go back. The concentration c is 45.37 M. K = 1e-22. So x^2 = K * c^2 = (1e-22) * (45.37)^2 ≈ 2.05e-20. So x = sqrt(2.05e-20) ≈ 4.53e-10 M.

So x is the concentration of NH4+ and NH2^- each. The number of moles of NH3 ionized is 2x * volume. So 2 * 4.53e-10 mol/L * 0.02205 L ≈ 2 * 4.53e-10 * 0.02205 ≈ 2 * 1.00e-11 ≈ 2.00e-11 moles. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.00e-11 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.204e13 molecules.

But none of the options are exactly that. Option H is 3.01e12. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of x.

Wait, let me re-calculate x. K = (x^2)/(c^2) = 1e-22. So x^2 = c^2 * K. So x = c * sqrt(K). c is 45.37.

So x = 45.37 * sqrt(1e-22) = 45.37 * 1e-11 ≈ 4.537e-10 M. So that's correct.

So the moles of each ion is x * volume = 4.537e-10 * 0.02205 ≈ 1.00e-11 moles. So total moles of ionized NH3 is 2 * 1.00e-11 = 2.00e-11. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.00e-11 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.204e13 molecules.

Wait, but option F is 1.20e20, which is way larger. Option H is 3.01e12. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume.

Wait, density is 0.771 g/mL. So 1 mole of NH3 is 17 g. Volume = mass/density = 17 g / 0.771 g/mL ≈ 22.05 mL, which is 0.02205 L. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The equilibrium expression is K = [NH4+][NH2^-] / [NH3]^2. Let me denote the degree of ionization as α. So [NH4+] = α c, [NH2^-] = α c, and [NH3] = c(1 - 2α). But since α is small, 2α is negligible, so [NH3] ≈ c.

So K ≈ (α c)^2 / c^2 = α^2. So α = sqrt(K) ≈ sqrt(1e-22) = 1e-11.

So the fraction ionized is 1e-11. So the number of moles ionized is 1 * 1e-11 * 1 mole = 1e-11 moles. Wait, but each mole of NH3 would have 6.022e23 molecules. So 1e-11 moles is 6.022e23 * 1e-11 = 6.022e12 molecules. That's approximately 6e12, which is close to option H (3.01e12), but not quite. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 because each ionization involves two molecules. So the total number of ionized molecules would be 2 * (α * n), where n is the number of molecules. So n = 1 mole * Avogadro's number = 6.022e23.

So α is 1e-11. So number of ionized molecules per molecule would be α * 6.022e23 = 1e-11 * 6.022e23 ≈ 6.022e12. So total ionized molecules would be 6.022e12. But wait, considering that each ionization event involves two molecules, maybe I should multiply by 2? So 2 * 6.022e12 ≈ 1.2e13, which is what I got before.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option H:3.01e12, which is about half of what I calculated. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of α? Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider that each molecule can donate or accept, so the number of ionized molecules is 2α * n.

Wait, let's recalculate: n = 6.022e23 molecules. α is 1e-11, so the number of molecules that have donated a proton is α * n ≈ 6.022e12. Similarly, the same number have accepted a proton. So total ionized molecules would be 2 * 6.022e12 ≈ 1.2e13.

But again, none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of α. Let me recalculate K.

Given K = 1e-22 = (x^2)/(c^2), so x = c * sqrt(K) = 45.37 * 1e-11 ≈ 4.537e-10 M.

Moles of each ion: 4.537e-10 M * 0.02205 L ≈ 1.00e-11 moles. So total moles of ionized NH3 is 2 * 1.00e-11 = 2.00e-11. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.00e-11 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.204e13 molecules.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the number of molecules ionized per liter, not per mole. Wait, no, the question says "how many molecules of ammonia are ionized in 1 mole of ammonia." So it's per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of molecules as (x * 2) * Avogadro's number. Wait, x is in mol/L, and the volume is 0.02205 L.

Wait, let me approach it differently. The concentration of NH3 is 45.37 M. The number of moles in 1 mole is 1, so if the concentration is 45.37 M, the volume is 1 / 45.37 ≈ 0.02205 L, which matches the earlier calculation.

The equilibrium expression gives x ≈ 4.537e-10 M. So in 0.02205 L, the moles of NH4+ is x * 0.02205 ≈ 1.00e-11. Similarly for NH2^-, so total ionized moles is 2e-11. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2e-11 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.204e13 molecules.

But looking at the options, the closest one is H:3.01e12, but that's about a third of my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the initial assumption?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 1 mole of NH3, so the initial concentration is 45.37 M, but perhaps the way I calculated the number of molecules is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the mole fraction ionized.

Wait, another approach: Let’s assume that the extent of reaction is x. So the moles of NH3 is 1. The reaction is 2 NH3 → NH4+ + NH2^-. So the change is -2x for NH3, +x for NH4+, +x for NH2^-.

The concentrations would be:

[NH3] = (1 - 2x) / V
[NH4+] = x / V
[NH2^-] = x / V

But V is 0.02205 L. So:

K = [(x/V)^2] / [(1 - 2x)/V]^2 = [x^2 / V^2] / [(1 - 2x)^2 / V^2] ] = (x^2)/(1 - 2x)^2.

Assuming x is very small, 2x << 1, so denominator ≈ 1. So K ≈ x^2. So x ≈ sqrt(K) = 1e-11.

So moles of NH4+ and NH2^- are x each. So total moles ionized is 2x = 2e-11.

So number of molecules = 2e-11 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.204e13. Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of molecules per mole, but the answer is presented in terms of per mole, so 1.204e13 is approximately 1.2e13, but none of the options have that.

Looking at the options, option H is 3.01e12. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the volume. Let me recheck.

Density is 0.771 g/mL. Molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol. So 1 mole is 17 g. Volume = 17 / 0.771 ≈ 22.05 mL = 0.02205 L. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the number of molecules per liter and then multiply by the volume in liters. Let's see:

x = 4.537e-10 M. So per liter, there are 4.537e-10 moles of NH4+. Each mole has 6.022e23 molecules, so 4.537e-10 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.73e14 molecules per liter of NH4+. Similarly for NH2^-, so total is 5.46e14 per liter. But since the volume is 0.02205 L, total molecules would be 5.46e14 * 0.02205 ≈ 1.204e13. Same as before.

Hmm, maybe the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the fraction ionized, not the number of molecules.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Since K is 1e-22, which is the same as Kw for water, but for ammonia. The ionization fraction is sqrt(K) because for water, Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1e-14, so [H+] = sqrt(1e-14) = 1e-7 M. Similarly here, [NH4+] = sqrt(K * c) = sqrt(1e-22 *45.37) ≈ sqrt(4.537e-21) ≈ 6.735e-11 M.

Wait, no, earlier I had K = x^2 / c^2, so x = c * sqrt(K). So x = 45.37 * 1e-11 ≈4.537e-10 M.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of x being the concentration of each ion, so the number of moles of NH3 ionized is 2x * V.

So 2 * 4.537e-10 * 0.02205 ≈ 2 * 1.00e-11 = 2.00e-11 moles. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.00e-11 *6.022e23 ≈1.204e13 molecules.

But since the options don’t have this, perhaps I must have misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of molecules ionized, which would be x * Avogadro's number, but that would be 4.537e-10 * 0.02205 *6.022e23 ≈ 6.0e13, which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of ionized molecules is x times the total number of molecules. So total molecules in 1 mole is 6.022e23. So ionized fraction is x / c, but x is 4.537e-10 M, and c is 45.37 M. So x/c = 1e-11. So ionized molecules = 6.022e23 *1e-11 ≈6.022e12, which is approximately 6e12. But the options have H as 3.01e12, which is half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each ionization produces two ions, so the total number of ionized molecules is 2 * (x * V * Avogadro). So x is 4.537e-10 M, V is 0.02205 L. So x * V = 4.537e-10 *0.02205 ≈1.00e-11 moles. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 1.00e-11 *6.022e23 =6.022e12. So total ionized molecules would be 2 *6.022e12 ≈1.204e13. But again, no option matches.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option H:3.01e12, which is about half of 6e12. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me check: K = 1e-22, c=45.37. So x = c*sqrt(K) =45.37*1e-11=4.537e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of molecules as (x * V) * Avogadro's number. So x is 4.537e-10 M *0.02205 L =1.00e-11 moles. Multiply by Avogadro's number:1.00e-11 *6.022e23=6.022e12 molecules. But since each ionization produces two ions, the total number is 2 *6.022e12=1.204e13. So perhaps the intended answer is not present, but the closest is H:3.01e12, which is about half.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only one ion per molecule, so 6e12, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I should check the units again. The options have some in M, which is concentration. Option A is 45.3 M, which is the concentration, not the number of molecules. So the correct approach must be to calculate the number of molecules, not the concentration.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the number of molecules ionized as (x * V) * Avogadro's number. x is 4.537e-10 M, V=0.02205 L. So 4.537e-10 *0.02205≈1.00e-11 moles. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 6.022e23 *1.00e-11≈6.022e12 molecules. So that's about 6.0e12, which is approximately option H (3.01e12) multiplied by 2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me re-calculate x.

Wait, no, x is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option H, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption that x is 1e-11 is correct, leading to 6e12 molecules, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option H:3.01e12, which is 1e-11 * Avogadro's number / 2.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the fraction of molecules ionized. If α is 1e-11, then the number of ionized molecules is α * 6.022e23 ≈6.022e12, which is 6.022e12. But that's not an option either. So perhaps the intended answer is H:3.01e12, which is about half of that. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the number of ionized molecules per molecule, which would be 1e-11, but that's not an option either.

Wait, another approach: the problem might be considering that each ionization involves two molecules, so the total number of molecules involved is 2x. So the number of ionized molecules would be 2x * Avogadro's number.

x is 4.537e-10 M *0.02205 L ≈1.00e-11 moles. So 2x =2.00e-11 moles. Multiply by Avogadro: 2.00e-11 *6.022e23≈1.204e13, which is approximately 1.2e13 molecules. But again, the options don't have this.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of x. Let me recalculate K.

K = [NH4+][NH2^-]/[NH3]^2. Assuming [NH3] ≈c=45.37 M, then K≈x²/c² → x= c * sqrt(K)=45.37 * 1e-11=4.537e-10 M.

Yes, that's correct. So I think my calculations are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is option H:3.01e12, which is close to half of 6e12. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer to be expressed as 1.0e10, which is option B, but I don't see why that would be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that K = x²/c². Let me think again. The reaction is 2 NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + NH2^-. So the equilibrium expression is K = [NH4+][NH2^-]/[NH3]^2.

If the initial concentration of NH3 is c, and the change is -2x, then [NH3] = c - 2x ≈ c. [NH4+] = x, [NH2^-] = x. So K = x² / c².

Yes, that's correct. So x = c * sqrt(K) =45.37 * 1e-11 ≈4.537e-10 M.

So the number of moles of each ion is x * V=4.537e-10 *0.02205≈1.00e-11. So total moles ionized is 2.00e-11. Multiply by Avogadro's number:2.00e-11 *6.022e23≈1.204e13.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:1.00e10, which is 1e10. How could that be? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume.

Wait, 1 mole of NH3 has a mass of 17 g. The volume is 17 g /0.771 g/mL ≈22.05 mL=0.02205 L. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concentration without considering the volume. If I just take x=4.537e-10 M and multiply by Avogadro's number, 4.537e-10 *6.022e23≈2.73e14 molecules per liter. Since the solution is 45.37 M, the volume is 1/45.37≈0.02205 L. So total molecules would be 2.73e14 *0.02205≈6.02e12. Again, same result.

I think I'm stuck. The closest option is H:3.01e12, which is about half of my calculated 6e12. Maybe the problem expects the answer to be option H, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, H is the closest.

The problem involves determining the number of ammonia molecules ionized in 1 mole of liquid ammonia, given that the equilibrium constant for its autoprotolysis is \( K_{\text{NH}_3} = 10^{-22} \). The reaction is:

\[
2 \text{NH}_3 \rightleftharpoons \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{NH}_2^-
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Equilibrium Expression**:  
   The equilibrium constant is expressed as:  
   \[
   K = \frac{[\text{NH}_4^+][\text{NH}_2^-]}{[\text{NH}_3]^2}
   \]  
   Assuming \( [\text{NH}_3] \approx c \) (since \( K \) is very small), the expression simplifies to:  
   \[
   K \approx \frac{x^2}{c^2}
   \]  
   where \( x \) is the concentration of \( \text{NH}_4^+ \) or \( \text{NH}_2^- \).

2. **Concentration of Ammonia**:  
   The density of ammonia is \( 0.771 \, \text{g/mL} \), and its molar mass is \( 17 \, \text{g/mol} \). For 1 mole of ammonia:  
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{17 \, \text{g}}{0.771 \, \text{g/mL}} \approx 22.05 \, \text{mL} = 0.02205 \, \text{L}
   \]  
   The concentration is:  
   \[
   c = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{1 \, \text{mol}}{0.02205 \, \text{L}} \approx 45.37 \, \text{M}
   \]

3. **Ionization Degree**:  
   Using \( K = 10^{-22} \), solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = c \cdot \sqrt{K} = 45.37 \cdot \sqrt{10^{-22}} = 45.37 \cdot 10^{-11} \approx 4.537 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Moles of Ionized Ammonia**:  
   The moles of \( \text{NH}_4^+ \) and \( \text{NH}_2^- \) are each \( x \cdot \text{Volume} \):  
   \[
   \text{Moles of each ion} = 4.537 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02205 \approx 1.00 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   Total moles of ionized ammonia:  
   \[
   2 \cdot 1.00 \times 10^{-11} = 2.00 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{mol}
   \]

5. **Number of Ionized Molecules**:  
   Multiply by Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \)):  
   \[
   \text{Number of molecules} = 2.00 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 1.204 \times 10^{13} \, \text{molecules}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (45.3 M molecules)**: This is the concentration of ammonia, not the number of ionized molecules.  
- **Option B (\( 1.00 \times 10^{10} \))**, **Option C (\( 2.66 \times 10^{11} \))**, **Option D (\( 7.50 \times 10^8 \))**, **Option E (\( 5.55 \times 10^{22} \))**, **Option F (\( 1.20 \times 10^{20} \))**, **Option G (\( 8.99 \times 10^{14} \))**, **Option I (\( 4.42 \times 10^{-13} \))**, and **Option J (\( 6.02 \times 10^{23} \))**: These do not match the calculated number of ionized molecules.  
- **Option H (\( 3.01 \times 10^{12} \))**: This is approximately half of the calculated value (\( 1.204 \times 10^{13} \)), but it is the closest among the options.

### Conclusion:
While the calculated number of ionized molecules is \( 1.204 \times 10^{13} \), the closest answer provided is **Option H (\( 3.01 \times 10^{12} \))**.
