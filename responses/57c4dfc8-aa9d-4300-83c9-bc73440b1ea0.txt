Okay, so I have this question about Newton's Law of Cooling applied to convective heat transfer. Hmm, I remember that Newton's Law of Cooling has something to do with the rate of heat loss, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference between an object and its surroundings. Oh right, the formula is something like q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let me go through them. Option A is q = hAΔT. That matches what I was thinking. Option J is q = kAΔT, which I think is more related to thermal conduction, where k is the thermal conductivity. But the question is about convection, so h is the right term here, not k.

Other options: B has h squared, which doesn't sound right. C uses T squared, which might be for something else, maybe radiation? D is hΔT divided by A, which would be the opposite of what I expect. E is hA over T, which doesn't make sense because units would be off. F has hAΔT over k, that's mixing terms from conduction and convection. G is h over A times ΔT, so again, the area is in the denominator, which is the opposite. H is ΔT over hA, that's the inverse. I is hAΔT squared, which would make the heat transfer depend on the square of the temperature difference, not linearly as I remember.

So the correct formula must be option A: q = hAΔT. Yeah, that's the one I learned for convective cooling.

The correct formula for Newton's Law of Cooling in convective heat transfer is q = hAΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference. This matches option A.
