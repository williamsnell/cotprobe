Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a charged oil drop in a parallel-plate capacitor. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The oil drop has a mass of 2.5 × 10^-4 grams. Wait, grams? I think I need to convert that into kilograms because standard SI units are usually used in these kinds of problems. So 1 gram is 0.001 kg, so 2.5e-4 grams is 2.5e-7 kg. Let me double-check that: 2.5 × 10^-4 g = 2.5e-4 g = 2.5e-4 * 1e-3 kg = 2.5e-7 kg. Yep, that's right.

The plates of the capacitor have an area of 175 cm² each. Oh wait, I should convert that to square meters because the formula for electric field probably uses square meters. So 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². Therefore, 175 cm² is 175 * 1e-4 m², which is 175e-4 = 0.0175 m². Alternatively, 175 * 1e-4 = 0.0175 m². Yep.

The charges on the plates are 4.5 × 10^7 C on the upper plate and an equal negative charge on the lower plate. So the charge on each plate is Q = 4.5e7 C. Since they're equal and opposite, the capacitor has a charge of +4.5e7 C on one plate and -4.5e7 C on the other.

The oil drop remains stationary, which means the forces acting on it are balanced. The forces in question are the gravitational force pulling it down and the electric force pushing it up (or vice versa, depending on the charge). Since it's stationary, the electric force must be equal in magnitude to the gravitational force but opposite in direction.

Wait, but wait. The oil drop is charged, so the electric force on it is F_electric = q * E, where q is the charge on the drop and E is the electric field between the plates.

The gravitational force is F_gravity = m * g, where m is the mass of the drop and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).

Since the drop is stationary, F_electric = F_gravity. So q * E = m * g. Therefore, q = (m * g) / E.

I need to find E first. The electric field between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by E = V/d, but I don't have the voltage or the plate separation. Wait, another formula for E when you know the charge and area is E = Q/(ε₀ A), where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity constant (approximately 8.85e-12 F/m). Let's recall that formula: E = σ / ε₀, where σ is the surface charge density, and σ = Q/A. So yes, E = Q/(ε₀ A).

Let me plug in the numbers. Q is 4.5e7 C, A is 0.0175 m².

So E = (4.5e7 C) / (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m²). Let me compute that.

First, calculate the denominator: 8.85e-12 * 0.0175.

8.85e-12 * 0.0175 = let's compute 8.85 * 17.5e-14. Wait, 0.0175 is 1.75e-2, so 8.85e-12 * 1.75e-2 = 8.85 * 1.75 * 1e-14. Let me calculate 8.85 * 1.75.

8 * 1.75 = 14, 0.85 *1.75= approx 1.4875. So total is about 15.4875. So 15.4875e-14, which is 1.54875e-13.

So E = 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13. Let me compute that.

4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13 = (4.5 / 1.54875) * 1e20.

4.5 divided by approx 1.54875 is approximately 2.91. Let me compute 4.5 / 1.54875:

1.54875 * 2 = 3.0975, which is less than 4.5. 1.54875 * 2.91 ≈ 4.5? Let me compute 1.54875 * 2.91.

1.54875 * 2 = 3.0975.

1.54875 * 0.91 = approximately 1.54875 * 0.9 = 1.393875 and 1.54875 *0.01=0.0154875. So total around 1.4093625.

So 3.0975 + 1.4093625 = 4.5068625. Hmm, that's a bit more than 4.5. So maybe 2.91 is a slight overestimation. Let me try 2.90.

1.54875 *2.90 = (1.54875 *2)+(1.54875 *0.9) = 3.0975 + 1.393875 = 4.491375. That's very close to 4.5. So 2.90 gives us about 4.491375, which is just under 4.5. The exact value of 4.5 would require a little more than 2.90, perhaps 2.906.

But for the sake of calculation, I'll approximate it as 2.906, giving E ≈ 2.906e20 N/C. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, because 4.5e7 divided by 1.54875e-13 is 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13 = (4.5 / 1.54875) * 1e20. So 2.906e20 N/C? That seems extremely high. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 4.5e7 is 45,000,000 C. The denominator is 8.85e-12 F/m multiplied by 0.0175 m², which is 8.85e-12 * 0.0175 = 1.54875e-13 F·m. So E = 45e6 C / 1.54875e-13 F·m.

Wait, wait, F is Coulombs per Volt-meter squared, but the units might be getting a bit tricky here. Alternatively, let me make sure the units are correct. The electric field E has units of volts per meter (V/m), which is equivalent to N/C. The formula E = Q/(ε₀ A) should give the correct units.

Wait, Q is in Coulombs, ε₀ is in F/m (which is C²/(N·m²)), and A is in m². So E = (C) / ((C²/(N·m²)) * m²)) ) = (C * N·m²) / (C² * m²) ) = (N·m²)/(C·m²) ) = N/C, which is correct.

So back to the calculation: 4.5e7 C divided by (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m²) = 4.5e7 / (1.54875e-13) = (4.5 / 1.54875) * 1e20.

Wait, 4.5e7 is 4.5 * 1e7, and 1.54875e-13 is 1.54875 * 1e-13. So when I divide 4.5e7 by 1.54875e-13, it's (4.5 / 1.54875) * (1e7 / 1e-13) )= (approx 2.906) * 1e20.

So E ≈ 2.906e20 N/C.

Wait, that number seems way too high. Let me think again. Because 1e20 N/C is enormous. Let me see, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent when converting units.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units conversion somewhere. Let me double-check. The area A is 175 cm². So 175 cm² is 175 * (1e-2 m)^2 = 175 * 1e-4 m² = 0.0175 m². Correct.

Charge Q is 4.5e7 C on each plate. That's a huge charge, but perhaps it's correct. Now, plugging into E = Q/(ε₀ A):

E = 4.5e7 C / (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m²) = (4.5e7) / (8.85e-12 * 0.0175)

Let me compute denominator: 8.85e-12 * 0.0175 = 8.85e-12 * 1.75e-2 = (8.85 * 1.75) * 1e-14.

8.85 * 1.75: Let me compute that.

Well, 8 * 1.75 = 14.0, 0.85 * 1.75 = 1.4875. So total is 14.0 + 1.4875 = 15.4875.

So denominator is 15.4875e-14 = 1.54875e-13.

So E = 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13 = (4.5e7) / (1.54875e-13) = (4.5 / 1.54875) * 1e20.

As before, 4.5 / 1.54875 ≈ 2.906, so E ≈ 2.906e20 N/C.

Hmm, that's 2.906 x 10^20 N/C. That seems extremely high, but maybe it's correct given the large charge.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: typical electric fields in capacitors are on the order of volts per meter. For example, a 1V capacitor with 1m spacing has E=1 V/m. For a 100V capacitor, E=1e2 V/m, which is about 1e2 N/C if the charge is such. But here, with Q=4.5e7 C and area 0.0175 m², the E-field might indeed be very high.

Now, moving on. The gravitational force on the oil drop is F_gravity = m * g.

Mass m is 2.5e-4 g, which is 2.5e-7 kg. g is 9.81 m/s².

So F_gravity = 2.5e-7 kg * 9.81 m/s² ≈ 2.4525e-6 N.

So F_gravity ≈ 2.4525e-6 N.

Since F_electric = F_gravity, q * E = 2.4525e-6 N.

So q = (2.4525e-6 N) / E.

E is 2.906e20 N/C, so q ≈ 2.4525e-6 / 2.906e20 = (2.4525 / 2.906) * 1e-26.

2.4525 / 2.906 ≈ 0.844.

So q ≈ 0.844e-26 C, which is 8.44e-27 C.

Wait, but looking at the options, the charges are in the order of 1e-13 C, so this seems way too small. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of E. Let me recalculate E again.

E = Q/(ε₀ A) = (4.5e7 C) / (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m²)

So denominator: 8.85e-12 * 0.0175 = ?

Let me compute 8.85e-12 * 0.0175:

0.0175 is 1.75e-2. So 8.85e-12 * 1.75e-2 = (8.85 * 1.75) * 1e-14.

As before, 8.85 * 1.75 = 15.4875. So denominator is 15.4875e-14 = 1.54875e-13.

So E = 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13.

Compute this: 4.5e7 is 45,000,000. 1.54875e-13 is 0.000000000000154875.

So 45,000,000 / 0.000000000000154875 = ?

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to use exponents.

4.5e7 = 4.5 * 1e7.

Denominator: 1.54875e-13 = 1.54875 * 1e-13.

So E = (4.5 / 1.54875) * (1e7 / 1e-13) ) = (2.906) * (1e20) ) ≈ 2.906e20 N/C.

So E is indeed about 2.906e20 N/C. That seems correct.

Then q = F_gravity / E = 2.4525e-6 N / 2.906e20 N/C = approx 8.44e-27 C.

Wait, but that's 8.44e-27 C, which is 8.44 × 10^-27 C. But looking at the options, all the charges are in the 1e-13 to 1e-14 range. So this can't be right. I think I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the electric field. Let me try another approach to compute E.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the voltage between the plates and then find E as V/d. But I don't have d, the separation between plates. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units of Q. Let me check the problem again. The charge on the upper plate is 4.5 × 10^7 C. That's a huge charge, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the oil drop's charge is positive, so the electric force is upward, opposing gravity. So the direction is correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the oil drop's charge is so small, and the E-field is so high, leading to a very small q. But the options don't have such a small charge. So maybe I made a mistake in the E-field calculation.

Wait, another approach: using E = σ / ε₀, where σ is surface charge density.

σ = Q / A = (4.5e7 C) / (0.0175 m²) = 4.5e7 / 0.0175 = ?

Compute 4.5e7 / 0.0175:

Well, 4.5e7 / 1.75e-2 = (4.5 / 1.75) * 1e9.

4.5 / 1.75 = 2.5714 approximately.

So σ ≈ 2.5714e9 C/m².

Then E = σ / ε₀ = 2.5714e9 / 8.85e-12 = ?

2.5714e9 / 8.85e-12 = (2.5714 / 8.85) * 1e21.

2.5714 /8.85 ≈ 0.291.

So E ≈ 0.291e21 = 2.91e20 N/C. Same as before.

So E is indeed about 2.91e20 N/C.

Then q = F_gravity / E = (2.5e-7 kg * 9.81 m/s² ) / 2.91e20 N/C.

Compute numerator: 2.5e-7 * 9.81 ≈ 2.4525e-6 N.

So q = 2.4525e-6 N / 2.91e20 N/C = 8.42e-27 C.

This is 8.42 × 10^-27 Coulombs. But none of the options are close to that. The options are in the 1e-13 to 1e-14 C range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check.

The mass is 2.5 × 10^-4 grams. 1 gram is 0.001 kg, so 2.5e-4 grams is 2.5e-4 * 1e-3 kg = 2.5e-7 kg. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different value for g, like 10 m/s². Let me recalculate F_gravity with g=10.

F_gravity = 2.5e-7 kg * 10 m/s² = 2.5e-6 N. Still, q would be 2.5e-6 / 2.91e20 = 8.6e-27 C. Still way too small.

Wait, I'm getting a charge of about 8.4e-27 C, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E.

Wait, perhaps I confused the charge on the plates. The problem says each plate has a charge of 4.5e7 C and the other has an equal negative charge. So the total charge on each plate is +4.5e7 C and -4.5e7 C, respectively. But in the formula for E, it's Q divided by (ε₀ A), where Q is the charge on one plate. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the oil drop's charge is such that the electric force is downward, balancing the gravitational force. But that would imply the electric field is in the same direction as gravity, which would require the charge to be negative. But regardless of the sign, the magnitude should still be the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the wrong formula for E. Let me think: for a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field is E = V/d, but without knowing V or d, perhaps I should use another approach. Alternatively, the potential difference V can be found using Q = C V, where C is the capacitance. The capacitance C = ε₀ A / d. But without d, I can't compute V, so that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should use E = (σ) / ε₀, which is what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the oil drop's charge is not in coulombs but in something else, but the problem says it's a charge in coulombs.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E. Maybe I should use E = (Q/(2ε₀ A)), but no, that's for two plates each with charge Q, but the field between them is Q/(ε₀ A), not divided by two. Because each plate contributes Q/(2ε₀ A) on each side, so together it's Q/(ε₀ A) between them.

Wait, no, that's correct. So E is indeed Q/(ε₀ A).

Wait, another approach: perhaps instead of using E, I can compute the voltage V between the plates and then find the electric force as q V / d. But without knowing d, that's tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can relate q to the electric field and the force.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations again.

E = Q/(ε₀ A) = (4.5e7 C) / (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m²) ≈ 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13 ≈ 2.906e20 N/C.

F_gravity = m g = 2.5e-7 kg * 9.81 m/s² ≈ 2.45e-6 N.

q = F_gravity / E = 2.45e-6 N / 2.906e20 N/C ≈ 8.43e-27 C.

But this is way smaller than any of the options given. The smallest option is I: 9.11e-14 C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe the oil drop is between the plates, and the electric field is balancing the weight. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the charge on the plates as +4.5e7 C and the other as -4.5e7 C, so the field is E = (Q + Q)/(ε₀ A) )? No, that's not correct. The field between the plates is E = σ / ε₀, where σ is Q/A, so E = Q/(ε₀ A).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing E. Let me try an alternative approach.

Compute E = V/d, but since I don't know V or d, perhaps I can express V in terms of Q and capacitance.

Capacitance C = ε₀ A / d. So V = Q/C = Q d / (ε₀ A).

But without d, I can't compute V. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can express E in terms of Q and C. Since E = V/d, and V = Q/C, then E = (Q/C)/d = Q/(C d). But C = ε₀ A/d, so E = Q/( (ε₀ A/d) * d ) ) = Q/(ε₀ A), which brings me back to the same formula. So E is correctly calculated.

I'm really stuck here because the calculated q is way too small compared to the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the oil drop has a mass of 2.5 × 10^-4 g. Wait, 10^-4 grams is 0.0001 grams, which is 1e-7 kg. So 2.5e-4 grams is 2.5e-7 kg. Correct.

The plates have an area of 175 cm², which is 0.0175 m². Correct.

Charge on each plate is 4.5e7 C. Correct.

E = Q/(ε₀ A) = 4.5e7 / (8.85e-12 * 0.0175) ≈ 2.906e20 N/C.

F_gravity = m g = 2.5e-7 * 9.81 ≈ 2.45e-6 N.

q = F/E = 2.45e-6 / 2.906e20 ≈ 8.43e-27 C.

But this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps the problem has different values. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating E. Let me check:

E = (4.5e7) / (8.85e-12 * 0.0175) = 4.5e7 / (8.85e-12 * 1.75e-2).

Wait, 8.85e-12 * 1.75e-2 = 8.85 * 1.75 * 1e-14.

8.85 * 1.75 = as before, 15.4875, so 15.4875e-14 = 1.54875e-13.

So E = 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13 = 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13.

Wait, but 4.5e7 is 4.5 * 1e7, denominator is 1.54875e-13 = 1.54875 * 1e-13.

So (4.5e7) / (1.54875e-13) = (4.5 / 1.54875) * (1e7 / 1e-13) )= 2.906 * 1e20 = 2.906e20 N/C.

Hmm, same result. So perhaps the issue is that the charge is 4.5e7 C, but that's an enormous charge for a capacitor. Maybe the correct charge is 4.5e-7 C, but the problem states 4.5e7 C. 

Alternatively, perhaps the oil drop's mass is 2.5e-4 grams, which is 2.5e-7 kg, but perhaps it's 2.5e-4 kg, which would be 250 grams. That would change things. Let me check: 2.5e-4 grams is 2.5e-7 kg. If it were 2.5e-4 kg, that's 250 grams, which is a big oil drop. But the problem says 2.5 × 10^-4 grams, so it's correct as 2.5e-7 kg.

Wait, perhaps the oil drop's charge is such that the electric force is up, so q is positive. But regardless, the magnitude would be the same.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong formula for electric force. Wait, the electric force on a charge in an electric field is F = q E. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the oil drop is in equilibrium, so the net force is zero. So F_electric = F_gravity.

But perhaps I should also consider the direction of the electric field. The field points from the positive plate to the negative plate. So if the oil drop is positively charged, the electric force would be upward, opposing gravity. If negative, the force would be downward. Either way, the magnitude of q would be the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ε₀. Let me check: the vacuum permittivity ε₀ is approximately 8.85 × 10^-12 F/m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. For a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field between the plates is E = σ/ε₀, where σ is the surface charge density on one plate. No, that's correct. So the calculation is right.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of F_gravity. Let me check again. m = 2.5e-7 kg, g = 9.81 m/s². F = m g = 2.5e-7 * 9.81 ≈ 2.4525e-6 N. Correct.

So q = 2.4525e-6 / 2.906e20 ≈ 8.43e-27 C.

But this is nowhere near any of the options. The smallest option is I: 9.11e-14 C, which is about 10e-14 C, which is much larger than 8.4e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E. Let me try to compute E again more carefully.

E = Q/(ε₀ A) = 4.5e7 C / (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m²)

Compute denominator: 8.85e-12 * 0.0175 = 8.85e-12 * 1.75e-2 = (8.85 * 1.75) * 1e-14.

8.85 * 1.75: 8 * 1.75 =14, 0.85 *1.75=1.4875. Total 15.4875.

So denominator =15.4875e-14 = 1.54875e-13.

So E = 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13 = (4.5 / 1.54875) * (1e7 / 1e-13) = 2.906 * 1e20 = 2.906e20 N/C.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the charge is not on the plates but on the oil drop. No, the problem states the plates have a charge of 4.5e7 C and -4.5e7 C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the oil drop is in the space between the plates, which are very close together. So the electric field is uniform. But that doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of q.

q = F_gravity / E = (2.5e-7 kg *9.81 m/s²) / (2.906e20 N/C) 

= (2.4525e-6 N) / (2.906e20 N/C)

= 2.4525e-6 / 2.906e20

= (2.4525 / 2.906) * 1e-26

= approx 0.844 * 1e-26 = 8.44e-27 C.

Hmm, that's correct.

But none of the options are anywhere near this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the charge on the oil drop is such that the electric force is upward, so q must be positive. But that doesn't affect the magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for g, like 10 m/s². Let me recalculate with g=10.

F_gravity = 2.5e-7 kg *10 = 2.5e-6 N.

q = 2.5e-6 / 2.906e20 ≈ 8.6e-27 C. Still way too small.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the charge in terms of elementary charges, but that's not necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement. Let me read it again.

The problem says the plates have a charge of 4.5 × 10^7 C and the other has an equal negative charge. So Q is 4.5e7 C. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ε₀, say 1e-12 F/m, but that would change the calculation.

Let me try with ε₀ = 1e-12 F/m.

E = 4.5e7 / (1e-12 * 0.0175) = 4.5e7 / (1.75e-14) = (4.5 /1.75) * 1e21 = 2.571e21 N/C.

Then q = 2.45e-6 / 2.571e21 = approx 9.53e-28 C. Even smaller, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the charge on the plates to be 4.5e-7 C, but that's just a guess. Let me try that.

E = 4.5e-7 / (8.85e-12 * 0.0175) = 4.5e-7 / (1.54875e-13) ≈ 2.906e6 N/C.

Then q = 2.45e-6 / 2.906e6 ≈ 8.43e-13 C. That's 8.43e-13 C, which is approximately 8.43 ×10^-13 C. Looking at the options, option C is 4.00 ×10^-13 C, option E is 3.14e-13, option G is 2.21e-13, and option J is 1.12e-13. Hmm, 8.43e-13 isn't an option. The closest is option G: 2.21e-13 C, but that's about a third of 8.43e-13. So perhaps I'm still missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the charge on the plates to be 4.5e-7 C, but the problem says 4.5e7. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used the formula E = 2 * Q/(ε₀ A), but that's incorrect. The correct formula is E = Q/(ε₀ A) for the field between the plates.

Wait, perhaps the oil drop's mass is 2.5 × 10^-4 grams, which is 2.5e-7 kg. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the oil drop's charge is such that the electric force is down, which would make the charge negative, but the magnitude remains the same.

Wait, perhaps I should try calculating q using the options to see which one gives F_gravity when multiplied by E.

Let's take option E: 3.14e-13 C.

q = 3.14e-13 C.

F_electric = q * E = 3.14e-13 * 2.906e20 = 9.12e7 N. That's way larger than F_gravity, which is 2.45e-6 N. So option E is way too big.

Option C: 4.00e-13 C. F_electric = 4e-13 * 2.9e20 = 1.16e8 N. Still way too big.

Option G: 2.21e-13 C. F_electric = 2.21e-13 * 2.9e20 = 6.41e7 N. Again, way too big.

Option J: 1.12e-13 C. F_electric = 1.12e-13 * 2.9e20 = 3.25e7 N. Still way too big.

Wait, this suggests that none of the options are correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the charge on the plates to be 4.5e-7 C, not 4.5e7. Let's recalculate with Q=4.5e-7 C.

E = 4.5e-7 / (8.85e-12 * 0.0175) = 4.5e-7 / 1.54875e-13 = (4.5 / 1.54875) * (1e-7 / 1e-13) )= 2.906 * 1e6 = 2.906e6 N/C.

Then q = F_gravity / E = 2.45e-6 / 2.906e6 ≈ 8.43e-13 C. 

Looking at the options, option C is 4.00e-13 C, which is about half of this value. Option E is 3.14e-13, which is close to half as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when I assumed the charge on the plates was 4.5e7 C. If the charge were 4.5e-7 C, then q would be approximately 8.43e-13 C, which isn't an option. But perhaps the correct option is not present, which is unlikely.

Wait, maybe I should try another approach by considering the charge per unit area (surface charge density) and then find the force.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the oil drop remains stationary, so the electric force must balance the gravitational force. So q E = m g.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the units again. Let me make sure all units are correct.

Mass m: 2.5e-7 kg.

g: 9.81 m/s².

E: 2.906e20 N/C.

So F_gravity = m g = 2.5e-7 kg * 9.81 m/s² ≈ 2.4525e-6 N.

Electric force F_electric = q E = q * 2.906e20 N/C.

Set F_electric = F_gravity: q * 2.906e20 = 2.4525e-6 → q = 2.4525e-6 / 2.906e20 ≈ 8.44e-27 C.

But again, this is not matching any options. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the charge on the plates is 4.5e-7 C, not 4.5e7. Let me try that.

E = 4.5e-7 C / (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m²) = 4.5e-7 / (1.54875e-13) ≈ 2.906e6 N/C.

Then q = 2.4525e-6 / 2.906e6 ≈ 8.43e-13 C.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.00e-13 C, which is close but not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate E with Q=4.5e7 C. Let me compute E again.

E = 4.5e7 / (8.85e-12 * 0.0175) = 4.5e7 / 1.54875e-13 ≈ 2.906e20 N/C.

Then q = 2.5e-7 kg * 9.81 / (2.906e20) = 2.4525e-6 / 2.906e20 ≈ 8.43e-27 C.

No, that's way off the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the oil drop's charge is in the same direction as the field, so the force is up, balancing the weight. But that doesn't change the magnitude.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the oil drop's charge is such that the electric force is down, meaning the charge is negative, but the magnitude remains the same.

Wait, but regardless, the q calculated is 8.43e-27 C, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 2.5e-4 grams, which is 2.5e-7 kg, correct. Area is 175 cm², which is 0.0175 m², correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the oil drop is in a vacuum, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the charge on the plates to be 4.5e-7 C, leading to q ≈8.43e-13 C, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's rearrange the formula to solve for q.

q = (m g) / (E) = (m g ε₀ A) / Q.

Plugging in the numbers:

m = 2.5e-7 kg.

g = 9.81 m/s².

ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m.

A = 0.0175 m².

Q = 4.5e7 C.

So q = (2.5e-7 * 9.81 * 8.85e-12 * 0.0175) / 4.5e7.

Let me compute numerator first:

2.5e-7 * 9.81 = 2.4525e-6.

2.4525e-6 * 8.85e-12 = 2.4525e-6 * 8.85e-12 = (2.4525 *8.85) * 1e-18.

2.4525 *8.85 ≈ 21.82.

So 21.82e-18 = 2.182e-17.

Multiply by 0.0175: 2.182e-17 *0.0175 = 3.8185e-19.

So numerator is 3.8185e-19.

Denominator: 4.5e7.

So q = 3.8185e-19 / 4.5e7 ≈ 8.485e-27 C.

Same result as before. So I must conclude that either the problem has a typo or I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the charge on the plates is 4.5e-7 C, which would make the calculation work. Let me compute that.

E = 4.5e-7 / (8.85e-12 * 0.0175) = 4.5e-7 /1.54875e-13 ≈ 2.906e6 N/C.

Then q = 2.4525e-6 / 2.906e6 ≈ 8.43e-13 C.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.00e-13, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended Q to be 4.5e-7 C, leading to q ≈8.43e-13 C, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the oil drop's mass is 2.5e-4 kg, which is 250 grams. Let me try that.

F_gravity = 2.5e-4 kg * 9.81 ≈ 2.45e-3 N.

q = 2.45e-3 / 2.906e20 ≈ 8.43e-24 C. Still way too small.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. The only possibility is that the problem has a mistake in the given charge on the plates. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use E = (Q)/(2ε₀ A), but that's incorrect. The correct formula is E = Q/(ε₀ A).

Alternatively, perhaps the oil drop has a charge that's a multiple of the elementary charge, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the plates are very close together and the electric field is uniform, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator when computing E. Let me recheck:

Denominator: ε₀ * A = 8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0175 m² = 8.85e-12 * 0.0175.

0.0175 is 1.75e-2.

So 8.85e-12 * 1.75e-2 = (8.85 *1.75) * 1e-14.

8.85 *1.75 = 15.4875.

So denominator is 15.4875e-14 = 1.54875e-13.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the charge on the plates to be 4.5e-5 C. Let me try that.

E = 4.5e-5 /1.54875e-13 ≈ 2.906e8 N/C.

q = 2.45e-6 / 2.906e8 ≈ 8.43e-15 C. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the charge is 4.5e-9 C.

E = 4.5e-9 /1.54875e-13 ≈ 2.906e4 N/C.

q = 2.45e-6 / 2.906e4 ≈ 8.43e-11 C. Still not matching.

Hmm, this is frustrating. I think I've spent enough time trying different approaches, but I can't seem to get an answer that matches the options provided. It's possible that I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't spot it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the charge on the plates is different.
</think>

The problem involves a charged oil drop of mass \( m = 2.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{kg} \) suspended between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor. The plates have an area \( A = 0.0175 \, \text{m}^2 \) and charges \( Q = \pm 4.5 \times 10^7 \, \text{C} \). The oil drop remains stationary, meaning the gravitational force \( F_{\text{gravity}} = m g \) is balanced by the electric force \( F_{\text{electric}} = q E \), where \( q \) is the charge of the oil drop and \( E \) is the electric field between the plates.

### Step 1: Electric Field Calculation
The electric field between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by:
\[
E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 A}
\]
where \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \). Substituting the values:
\[
E = \frac{4.5 \times 10^7}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.0175} = \frac{4.5 \times 10^7}{1.54875 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 2.906 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N/C}.
\]

### Step 2: Gravitational Force
The gravitational force acting on the oil drop is:
\[
F_{\text{gravity}} = m g = (2.5 \times 10^{-7}) \times 9.81 \approx 2.4525 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{N}.
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \( q \)
Since \( F_{\text{electric}} = F_{\text{gravity}} \), we have:
\[
q E = m g \implies q = \frac{m g}{E}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
q = \frac{2.4525 \times 10^{-6}}{2.906 \times 10^{20}} \approx 8.43 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{C}.
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated charge \( q \approx 8.43 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{C} \) is orders of magnitude smaller than any of the provided options, which range from \( 1.12 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{C} \) to \( 9.11 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{C} \). This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup, such as a typo in the charge \( Q \) on the plates, or a misinterpretation of the given values.

If the charge on the plates were \( Q = 4.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C} \) instead of \( 4.5 \times 10^7 \, \text{C} \), the electric field would be:
\[
E = \frac{4.5 \times 10^{-7}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.0175} \approx 2.906 \times 10^6 \, \text{N/C}.
\]
Recomputing \( q \):
\[
q = \frac{2.4525 \times 10^{-6}}{2.906 \times 10^6} \approx 8.43 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{C}.
\]
This value is still not listed among the options. The closest option is **C: \( 4.00 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{C} \)**, which is approximately half of the calculated value.

Given the mismatch, it is likely that the problem contains an error in the stated charge on the plates. However, based on the provided options, the best choice is:

**Answer: C**
