Okay, so I've got this problem here about applying discounts to the speedway racing set. Let me see what I can do with it. Alright, the set is priced at $32, and there are two discounts: 10% and 20%. I need to find the net price after both discounts are applied. Hmm, wait, so are these two discounts both being applied to the original price, or is one after the other? I think in business terms, when discounts are applied successively, you have to apply them one after the other. So the first discount is 10% off, and then the second is 20% off the new price after the first discount.

Let me break it down step by step. First, calculate the 10% discount on $32. To find 10% of 32, I multiply 32 by 0.10, which gives me $3.20. So the price after the first discount is 32 minus 3.20, which is $28.80. 

Then, apply the 20% discount to this new price. So I take $28.80 and calculate 20% of that. 20% is 0.20, so 28.80 * 0.20 equals $5.76. Subtract that from the $28.80, and I get $23.04. 

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. So first, 10% off: 32 * 0.9 = 28.8. Then 20% off 28.8: 28.8 * 0.8 = 23.04. Yep, that seems correct. 

Looking at the options provided, option I is $23.04, which matches my calculation. So the net price after both discounts is $23.04.

The correct net price after applying a 10% discount followed by a 20% discount on a $32 racing set is $23.04. 

Answer: I: $23.04
