Okay, so I have this question about calculating the cost of operating a lamp for 24 hours. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electrical calculations, but I'll take it slow.

First, the question says the lamp requires 1.0 amp on a 100-volt line. The cost of electric energy is $0.50 per kilowatt-hour, and we need to find the cost for 24 hours of operation.

Hmm, I remember that power in electrical terms is usually measured in watts, and then converted to kilowatts for billing. The formula for power is P = V * I, where V is voltage and I is current. So, I can start by calculating the power consumption of the lamp.

Given:
- Voltage (V) = 100 volts
- Current (I) = 1.0 amp

So, P = V * I = 100 V * 1.0 A = 100 watts. Wait, that's 100 W. But the billing is in kilowatts, right? So I should convert that to kilowatts. 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts, so 100 W is 0.1 kW.

Now, I need to find out how much energy the lamp uses in one hour. Energy is power multiplied by time. So for one hour, it's 0.1 kW * 1 hour = 0.1 kWh. 

But we're running it for 24 hours. So total energy used would be 0.1 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 2.4 kWh.

The cost is $0.50 per kWh, so the total cost is 2.4 kWh * $0.50/kWh. Let me calculate that: 2.4 * 0.5 = $1.20. Wait, but looking at the options, option G is $1.20, so that seems to be the answer.

Wait a second, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes? Let me go through the steps again.

1. Power calculation: 100 V * 1 A = 100 W. Yes, that's correct.
2. Convert to kW: 100 W = 0.1 kW. Yes.
3. Energy per hour: 0.1 kWh. Correct.
4. For 24 hours: 0.1 *24=2.4 kWh. Right.
5. Cost: 2.4 * 0.5 = $1.20. Yep, that adds up.

I think I did everything correctly. So the answer should be G: $1.20.

The lamp uses 100 watts, which is 0.1 kW. Over 24 hours, it consumes 2.4 kWh. At $0.50 per kWh, the cost is $1.20.

Answer: G
