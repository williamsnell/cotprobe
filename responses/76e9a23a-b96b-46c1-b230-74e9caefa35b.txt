Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the difference in mass, Δm, between the final and initial nuclei when an oxygen isotope emits a gamma ray. Hmm, gamma rays are involved, so I remember that gamma emission is related to the nucleus transitioning between energy states, right? So, in this case, the oxygen-19 nucleus is going from an excited state to the ground state and emitting a gamma photon.

The question gives me the change in energy, ΔE, as 1.06 × 10^8 Kcal per mole. I need to find the mass difference in grams per mole. I think this involves Einstein's equation, E=mc², but wait, since we're dealing with energy differences and mass differences, I should rearrange it to ΔE = Δm * c². So, Δm would be ΔE divided by c squared.

But wait, the units here are in Kcal per mole, and I need the answer in grams per mole. Oh right, I remember that 1 Kcal is approximately 4184 Joules. So I should convert the energy from Kcal to Joules first.

Let me calculate that. So ΔE in Joules is 1.06e8 Kcal/mole multiplied by 4184 J/Kcal. Let me compute that: 1.06e8 * 4184. Hmm, 1.06 * 4184 is about 4439.84, so 4439.84e8 J/mole. Wait, wait, no, 1e8 times 4184 would be 4.184e11 J/mole. Wait, no, wait, 1.06e8 Kcal is 1.06e8 * 4184 J. So 1.06e8 is 108,000,000, so 108e6 * 4184. Let me compute that: 108e6 * 4.184e3 = (108 *4.184) * 1e9. 108 * 4 is 432, 108 * 0.184 is about 19.9. So total is 451.9, so 451.9e9 J/mole. So ΔE ≈ 4.519e11 J/mole.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to convert Kcal to Joules first. Let me think: 1 Kcal = 4184 J. So 1.06e8 Kcal is 1.06e8 * 4184 J. So that's 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = 4.43984e11 J/mole.

Now, using E=Δm*c², so Δm = E/(c²). The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so c² is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So Δm = 4.43984e11 J/mole / 9e16 m²/s². Let's compute that: 4.43984e11 / 9e16 = (4.43984 / 9) * 1e-5. 4.43984 divided by 9 is approximately 0.493315. So 0.493315e-5 kg/mole. Wait, because 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², so kg is the mass unit here.

But wait, kg to grams is 1 kg = 1e3 grams. So 0.493315e-5 kg is 0.493315e-5 * 1e3 g = 0.493315e-2 g, which is 4.93315e-3 g/mole.

Wait, but wait a second. Is ΔE positive or negative? The gamma emission is when the nucleus goes from a higher energy state to a lower one, releasing energy. So the initial nucleus (excited state) has higher mass because of the higher energy. When it emits a gamma ray, the nucleus moves to a lower energy state, so the mass decreases. So the mass difference would be negative because the final mass is less than the initial mass.

So Δm = m_final - m_initial = (m_initial - energy converted to mass) - m_initial = negative value. So Δm would be negative. Therefore, the mass difference is negative 4.93e-3 g/mole.

Looking at the options, option B is -4.92e-3, which is close to my calculation. Option C is positive, which would be if the mass increased, but that's not the case here. So the correct answer should be option B.

To calculate the mass difference Δm between the final and initial nuclei for the emission of a gamma ray, we use Einstein's equation:

\[
\Delta E = \Delta m \cdot c^2
\]

### Step 1: Convert Energy Units
The energy change ΔE is given as \( 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{Kcal/mole} \). Converting Kcal to Joules:

\[
1 \, \text{Kcal} = 4184 \, \text{J}
\]

\[
\Delta E = 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{Kcal/mole} \times 4184 \, \text{J/Kcal} = 4.43984 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mole}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for Δm
Rearranging Einstein's equation:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{\Delta E}{c^2}
\]

The speed of light \( c \) is \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so:

\[
c^2 = (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Substituting values:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{4.43984 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mole}}{9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 0.493315 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg/mole}
\]

Converting kilograms to grams (\( 1 \, \text{kg} = 10^3 \, \text{g} \)):

\[
\Delta m = 0.493315 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg/mole} \times 10^3 \, \text{g/kg} = 4.93315 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mole}
\]

### Step 3: Consider the Sign of Δm
The gamma emission occurs when the nucleus transitions from a higher energy (excited) state to a lower energy (ground) state, releasing energy. This means the final mass is less than the initial mass, so Δm is negative:

\[
\Delta m = -4.93 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mole}
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The closest option is **B: -4.92 × 10⁻³ g/mole**, which aligns with the calculated value.
