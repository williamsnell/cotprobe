Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about warranties, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by understanding the question. The buyer bought an item from a merchant, and the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The question is asking which warranty the buyer can invoke, assuming there are no other warranties. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in contract law, especially in the context of the sale of goods, there are certain implied warranties that come into play. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) deals with this, right? So the UCC has specific sections, like Section 2-314, which talks about implied warranties. 

Wait, the question mentions the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for ordinary purposes. That sounds like it's not meeting the basic expectations of what a buyer would expect. So I'm thinking about the warranties that cover such situations.

I recall that there's an implied warranty of merchantability. That's when the seller is a merchant, and they sell goods, and the warranty implies that the goods are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. So if the item is defective and unfit, the merchantability warranty would apply. 

Other options: Let me go through them one by one. Option A is warranty of title. That's about the seller having clear title, which isn't the issue here. The problem is with the item's fitness, not ownership. So A is probably not it.

Option B is implied warranty. That's a general term. Implied warranties can include merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. So B is a possible category, but maybe the question is looking for the specific type rather than just implied.

Option C is warranty of merchantability. That seems to fit because the item is defective and not fit for ordinary use. So C might be the answer.

Option D is warranty of suitability. That sounds similar to fitness for a particular purpose, which is an express warranty usually. But the question doesn't mention that the buyer had a specific use in mind beyond ordinary purposes, so maybe not D.

Option E is warranty of non-infringement. That's about intellectual property, which isn't the issue here. So E is out.

Option F is warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. That's when the buyer has a specific use in mind, and the seller knows about it. But the question says "ordinary purposes," so it's more general. So F might not apply unless the buyer had a particular use, which isn't mentioned.

Option G is warranty of durability. That's about how long the product will last. The question doesn't specify anything about the product's lifespan, just that it's unfit and unsafe. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H is express warranty. That's a specific warranty given by the seller, but the question says there are no other warranties, so H might not apply unless it's an implied one.

Option I is warranty of safety. I'm not sure if that's a standard term. Safety could be part of merchantability, perhaps. But I'm not sure if it's a separate warranty. I'll have to think about that.

Option J is warranty of quality. That's a bit vague. Quality could relate to merchantability, but again, it's more specific.

So putting it all together, the key here is that the item is defective and not fit for its ordinary purposes. That points directly to the implied warranty of merchantability, which is covered under the UCC and requires the goods to be fit for the ordinary purposes intended.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C: Warranty of merchantability.

The buyer purchased an item that is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the implied warranty of merchantability ensures that goods are fit for their ordinary purposes. Since the item fails to meet this standard, the buyer can invoke this warranty.

Answer: C
