Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state, n=1, but using the mass of the electron instead of the reduced mass. Hmm, I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen are calculated using the Rydberg formula, but wait, I think it's more about the energy levels in the Bohr model.

Wait, right, the energy levels for hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = - (μ * R_H) / n², where μ is the reduced mass of the electron and proton system. But in this question, I'm supposed to use the mass of the electron, m_e, instead of the reduced mass. So I guess the formula would change.

What's the reduced mass, μ? Oh right, μ = (m_e * M_p) / (m_e + M_p), where M_p is the mass of the proton. But if we ignore the proton's mass, which is much larger than the electron's, then μ ≈ m_e. Wait, no, because M_p is about 1836 times m_e. So μ is approximately m_e*(M_p)/(m_e + M_p) ≈ m_e/(1 + m_e/M_p). Since m_e/M_p is tiny (like 1/1836), μ is almost m_e, but slightly less.

But wait, the question says to use the electron's mass instead of the reduced mass. So instead of using μ, we'll use m_e. So the formula becomes E_n = - (m_e * e^4)/(8 ε_0² h² n²), or perhaps using the Rydberg constant. Alternatively, I might think in terms of the Rydberg formula. Oh wait, the Rydberg constant R_H is given by (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h^3 c), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the ground state energy is -13.6 eV when using the reduced mass. So if I use the electron's mass, which is larger than the reduced mass, the energy would be less negative, right? Because μ is a bit smaller than m_e. Because μ = m_e * M_p/(m_e + M_p) → which is less than m_e, because denominator is bigger than numerator.

Wait, no, wait, if you have μ = (m_e * M_p) / (m_e + M_p). Since M_p is much bigger than m_e, μ ≈ m_e*(M_p)/(M_p) )= m_e. Oh wait, that can't be right because if M_p is very large, m_e + M_p ≈ M_p. So μ ≈ m_e. So when you replace μ with m_e, you're making it a bit bigger than μ. Because m_e is bigger than μ. So the energy E_n depends on μ as E_n ∝ -μ. So if μ is smaller in the actual case, and here we're using a bigger μ (m_e instead), the energy would be more negative. But wait, the actual energy is -13.6 eV when using μ. So if we use m_e instead, which is larger, the energy becomes more negative? But that's not possible because the real energy is already determined by the reduced mass. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = - (R_H * h c) / n². But R_H (the Rydberg constant) is given by R_H = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h^3 c), right? Or wait, R_H is 13.6 eV, which is the ionization energy. But when using the reduced mass, the Rydberg constant becomes R = R_H * (μ/m_e). So R = R_H * μ/m_e.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try another approach. The energy levels are given by E_n = - (μ * e²)/(8 ε_0 a_0), where a_0 is the Bohr radius. The Bohr radius a_0 is (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(m_e e²). Alternatively, a_0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(μ e²) when using the reduced mass. So if I use the full mass m_e instead of μ, then a_0 would be larger, but the energy depends on μ. So E_n is proportional to -μ/(a_0), but a_0 itself depends on μ. So let me see.

Wait, let's compute E_n using m_e. The standard formula when using reduced mass is E_n = - (m_e M_p)/(2 (m_e + M_p)^2) * (e^4)/(8 ε_0² h²) * 1/n². Or perhaps it's better to think in terms of the known formula for energy levels without using reduced mass.

Actually, the energy levels can be written as E_n = - ( (e^2)/(8 ε_0) )^2 * m_e M_p / ( (m_e + M_p)^2 ) / (2 ħ² n²). Alternatively, E_n = - ( (e^2)/(8 ε_0 ħ^2) )^2 * (m_e M_p) / ( (m_e + M_p)^2 ) * 1/(4 n²). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, the actual energy of the ground state using the reduced mass is -13.6 eV. So if I use m_e instead of μ, which is slightly less than m_e, then the energy would be more negative, because E_n is inversely proportional to the mass. Because E_n = - (μ * something), so if μ increases, E_n becomes more negative. But wait, μ is m_e * M_p / (m_e + M_p), which is less than m_e. So using m_e instead would make μ larger, hence E_n more negative. But that's not possible because the actual energy is determined by the reduced mass, and using a larger μ would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate E_n using m_e. Let me think about the formula. The energy levels are given by E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h² n²) * 1/(2 m_e + M_p), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the general formula is E_n = - (R_H * h c) / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant.

Wait, R_H is given by R_H = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h^3 c). But when considering the reduced mass, R_H becomes R_H' = R_H * (μ/m_e) = (e^4 m_e)/(8 ε_0² h^3 c) * (m_e M_p)/(m_e + M_p) ) → but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy when using m_e instead of μ is E = - (m_e^2 e^4)/(8 ε_0² h^2 (2 m_e + M_p) ) * 1/n². I'm not entirely confident, but let me think numerically.

The actual energy is -13.6 eV when using μ. So if I use m_e instead, which is larger than μ, the energy would be more negative. But that's not possible because the real energy is -13.6 eV with μ. So maybe the question is asking for the energy using m_e, which would be different.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the energy using m_e, without considering the reduced mass. The standard formula for the energy levels in hydrogen is E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h² n²) * 1/(2 (m_e + M_p)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is E = - ( (e^2)/(8 ε_0 a_0) ) * (1/(2 a_0)), but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe I should just compute it using the formula without the reduced mass. The energy levels are given by E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h² n²) * (1/(2 m_e + M_p)), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E_n = - (m_e^2 e^4)/(8 ε_0² h^3 c n²) * something. I'm getting a bit lost here.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h^3 c) when using the electron mass, but when using the reduced mass, it's R' = R * (μ/m_e). So the energy would be E = - R h c / n². So if I use the electron mass, R is the Rydberg constant, and E would be -13.6 eV. But since I'm supposed to use m_e instead of μ, perhaps the Rydberg constant would be different.

Wait, no, the Rydberg constant R_H is already calculated using the reduced mass. So if I calculate using m_e, the energy would be E = - (m_e / μ) * (R_H h c) / n². Because E scales with μ, and using m_e instead of μ would change it by a factor of m_e/μ.

Wait, let me think: E_n ∝ μ. So if I use μ = m_e, then E would be E = (m_e / μ_real) * E_real, where μ_real is the actual reduced mass. So the actual E_real is -13.6 eV. So if I use m_e instead, E would be (m_e / μ) * (-13.6 eV).

What's μ in terms of m_e and M_p? μ = (m_e M_p)/(m_e + M_p). So m_e / μ = (m_e (m_e + M_p)) / (m_e M_p) ) = (m_e + M_p)/(M_p) ) = (M_p + m_e)/M_p ≈ 1 + m_e/M_p ≈ 1.000546 (since m_e/M_p ≈ 1/1836).

So the factor is approximately 1 + 5.44e-4, which is about 1.000544. So E would be approximately -13.6 eV * 1.000544 ≈ -13.6075 eV. But wait, the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: -13.61 eV

Wait, that's very close. But wait, the actual energy using the reduced mass is -13.6 eV. So using m_e would make it about -13.6 * (m_e / μ) ≈ -13.6 * (1.000544) ≈ -13.6075 eV, which is approximately -13.61 eV. So option A is -13.61 eV, which would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the exact calculation. Let's compute μ more accurately. M_p is about 1.672622e-27 kg, and m_e is about 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So μ = (m_e * M_p) / (m_e + M_p) ≈ (9.10938356e-31 * 1.672622e-27) / (9.10938356e-31 + 1.672622e-27) 

Calculating denominator: 1.672622e-27 + 9.10938356e-31 ≈ 1.672622e-27, since 9e-31 is much smaller. So μ ≈ (9.10938e-31 * 1.67262e-27) / 1.67262e-27 = 9.10938e-31 kg. Wait, that can't be right because 9e-31 << 1.6e-27, so the denominator is dominated by M_p. So μ ≈ m_e * (M_p)/(M_p + m_e) ≈ m_e * (M_p)/(M_p) ) = m_e * 1, but that's not correct because the denominator is M_p(1 + m_e/M_p), so μ ≈ m_e * M_p/(M_p (1 + m_e/M_p)) ) = m_e/(1 + m_e/M_p) ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/(M_p)).

Wait, no, more accurately, μ = m_e * M_p / (m_e + M_p) = m_e * [1/(1 + m_e/M_p)] ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M_p + (m_e/M_p)^2 - ... )

Since m_e/M_p ≈ 5.44e-4, μ ≈ m_e (1 - 5.44e-4) ≈ m_e * 0.999456.

So m_e/μ ≈ 1/(1 - 5.44e-4) ≈ 1 + 5.44e-4 ≈ 1.000544.

So the energy when using m_e is E = -13.6 eV * 1.000544 ≈ -13.6075 eV, which is about -13.61 eV, matching option A.

So the answer should be A: -13.61 eV.

The energy levels of a hydrogen atom are typically calculated using the reduced mass of the electron and proton system. However, the question asks to calculate the energy using the electron's mass, \( m_e \), instead of the reduced mass, \( \mu \). The reduced mass is given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_e M_p}{m_e + M_p},
\]

where \( M_p \) is the mass of the proton. Since \( M_p \gg m_e \), \( \mu \) is slightly less than \( m_e \). Using \( m_e \) instead of \( \mu \) increases the effective mass, making the energy more negative.

The ground state energy of hydrogen using the reduced mass is known to be \( -13.6 \, \text{eV} \). When replacing \( \mu \) with \( m_e \), the energy changes by a factor of \( \frac{m_e}{\mu} \). Since \( \mu \approx m_e \left(1 - \frac{m_e}{M_p}\right) \), the factor \( \frac{m_e}{\mu} \) is approximately \( 1 + \frac{m_e}{M_p} \). Given \( \frac{m_e}{M_p} \approx 5.44 \times 10^{-4} \), the energy becomes:

\[
E \approx -13.6 \, \text{eV} \times 1.000544 \approx -13.61 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This matches option A. The other options are either units of charge, energy in joules, or the mass of the electron, which are not relevant to the question.
