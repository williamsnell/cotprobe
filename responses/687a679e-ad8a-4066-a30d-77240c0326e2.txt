Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the thermal decomposition of ferrous sulfate. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The reaction given is 2FeSO4(s) ⇌ Fe2O3(s) + SO2(g) + SO3(g). The problem has two parts: part (a) asks for Kp at 929 K, and part (b) is about finding the equilibrium total pressure when excess ferrous sulfate is placed in a flask with some initial SO2 pressure.

Starting with part (a). I remember that Kp is the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures. But wait, solids don't contribute to the K expression because their activities are considered 1. So in this reaction, FeSO4 and Fe2O3 are solids, so only the gaseous products, SO2 and SO3, will be in the Kp expression.

The balanced equation shows that 2 moles of FeSO4 produce 1 mole each of SO2 and SO3. So the Kp expression should be Kp = (P_SO2)(P_SO3). 

Now, the problem states that at 929 K, the total gas pressure is 0.9 atm, and both solids are present. Since the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases, that would be P_SO2 + P_SO3 = 0.9 atm. Let me denote P_SO2 as x and P_SO3 as y. So x + y = 0.9 atm.

But wait, from the balanced equation, the stoichiometric coefficients are 1 for both SO2 and SO3. So if I let x be the partial pressure of SO2, then the partial pressure of SO3 would also be x, because the stoichiometry is the same. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the reaction produces 1 mole each, so maybe their pressures are the same? Or maybe not, because depending on the conditions, their partial pressures could vary. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but in the reaction, the moles of SO2 and SO3 produced are both 1 mole each. So perhaps their partial pressures are equal at equilibrium? Because the stoichiometric coefficients are the same. So maybe x = y. So if x + y = 0.9, and x = y, then each would be 0.45 atm. So P_SO2 = 0.45 atm, P_SO3 = 0.45 atm.

Then Kp would be (0.45)(0.45) = 0.2025 atm². Looking at the options, let's see: option J says Kp=0.203 atm², which matches this. So part (a) would be option J's Kp.

Wait, but wait again. Is it possible that the partial pressures aren't the same? Because maybe the reaction's stoichiometry doesn't directly dictate their equality. Let me think again. The reaction produces 1 mole each, so if the initial decomposition starts from pure solid, then at equilibrium, the partial pressures would indeed be the same because each is produced in equal amounts. So yes, x = y. So Kp is 0.45 * 0.45 = 0.2025 atm². So part (a) answer is 0.203 atm², which is option J's Kp.

Now part (b): when excess ferrous sulfate is placed in a flask at 929 K, which already contains an initial SO2 pressure of 0.6 atm. We need to find the equilibrium total pressure.

Since FeSO4 is in excess, its amount doesn't affect the Kp because it's a solid. So the reaction will proceed until equilibrium is reached, considering the initial SO2 pressure.

Wait, but the reaction produces both SO2 and SO3. The initial SO2 is 0.6 atm, but what about SO3? Initially, if there's no SO3 present, then the system will start to decompose FeSO4 into SO2 and SO3. But wait, the problem says 'excess ferrous sulfate is placed in a flask' which already contains some SO2. So perhaps the flask initially has only SO2 at 0.6 atm, and no SO3.

So let me set up the ICE table.

Let me denote:

Initial: P_SO2 = 0.6 atm, P_SO3 = 0 atm.

Change: Let's say the reaction proceeds forward, producing some amount. But wait, the reaction is 2FeSO4(s) → Fe2O3(s) + SO2(g) + SO3(g). So for every 2 moles of FeSO4 decomposed, you get 1 mole each of SO2 and SO3. Wait, but if FeSO4 is in excess, then the decomposition can proceed until the partial pressures reach equilibrium, considering the initial SO2.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of initial SO2 will shift the equilibrium. Let me think in terms of Kp. The Kp is 0.203 atm², as found in part (a).

So, let me let the change in pressure be 'x'. Let me define 'x' as the additional pressure from the decomposition beyond the initial SO2. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the change in SO3. Let me denote the change in P_SO3 as 'x', so that P_SO2 increases by 'x' as well, because each mole of reaction produces 1 mole each of SO2 and SO3.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Because the initial SO2 is 0.6 atm. Let me think again. Let me consider that the reaction can go both ways, but since FeSO4 is in excess, the reaction can proceed to form more SO2 and SO3. But if there's already some SO2, the reaction might shift to form more SO3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the equilibrium expression.

Let me think: At equilibrium, P_SO2 = 0.6 + x, and P_SO3 = x. Because for every unit of reaction, you produce 1 mole each. Wait, no, because the reaction produces 1 mole each of SO2 and SO3 per 2 moles of FeSO4 decomposed. So if I let 'x' be the extent of reaction, then the change would be: SO2 increases by 'x', and SO3 increases by 'x'.

Wait, but wait. The initial SO2 is 0.6 atm, and if the reaction proceeds forward, then more SO2 and SO3 are produced. Alternatively, if the reaction goes backward (unlikely because Kp is positive, but let's see), but since we're adding excess solid, I think the reaction will proceed forward to reach equilibrium.

So, perhaps the setup is:

At equilibrium, P_SO2 = 0.6 + x, P_SO3 = 0 + x.

Because the reaction produces 1 mole of each per 2 moles of FeSO4. So the change for each is +x.

Then, Kp = (P_SO2)(P_SO3) = (0.6 + x)(x) = 0.203.

So expanding this: 0.6x + x^2 = 0.203.

Which gives x^2 + 0.6x - 0.203 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation: x = [-0.6 ± sqrt(0.6^2 + 4*1*0.203)] / 2.

Calculating discriminant: 0.36 + 0.812 = 1.172.

Square root of 1.172 is approximately 1.082.

So x = [-0.6 ± 1.082]/2.

We can ignore the negative solution because pressure can't be negative, so x = ( -0.6 + 1.082 ) / 2 ≈ (0.482)/2 ≈ 0.241 atm.

So P_SO2 = 0.6 + 0.241 = 0.841 atm.

P_SO3 = 0.241 atm.

Total pressure is 0.841 + 0.241 = 1.082 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J says total pressure is 1.082 atm, which matches this. So part (b) would have a total pressure of 1.082 atm.

Wait, but let me double-check my setup. Because the initial SO2 is 0.6 atm, and the reaction produces both SO2 and SO3. Wait, but if the reaction is going forward, wouldn't the initial SO2 contribute to the partial pressure, and thus the total pressure would be higher? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the changes.

Wait another approach: Let me consider that the initial pressure is 0.6 atm of SO2, and no SO3. The reaction will proceed to form more SO2 and SO3. But wait, the reaction is 2FeSO4(s) → Fe2O3(s) + SO2(g) + SO3(g). So each mole of reaction produces 1 mole of SO2 and 1 mole of SO3. So the change would be: if 'x' is the moles reacting, then SO2 increases by x, and SO3 increases by x.

Wait, but initially, there's already 0.6 atm of SO2, so at equilibrium, P_SO2 = 0.6 + x, and P_SO3 = 0 + x.

So Kp = (0.6 + x)(x) = 0.203.

Which leads to the same quadratic: x² + 0.6x - 0.203 = 0.

Solving again, same result: x≈0.241 atm.

So P_SO2 = 0.841 atm, P_SO3=0.241 atm. Total pressure = 1.082 atm.

Looking at the options, option J has Kp=0.203 atm² and total pressure=1.082 atm. So both (a) and (b) are correct under option J.

For part (a), the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is calculated using the partial pressures of the gaseous products, \( SO_2 \) and \( SO_3 \), since solids do not contribute to the equilibrium expression. The total gas pressure at equilibrium is given as 0.9 atm, and since the stoichiometric coefficients of \( SO_2 \) and \( SO_3 \) are equal, their partial pressures are equal. Let \( P_{SO_2} = P_{SO_3} = x \). Then, \( x + x = 0.9 \) atm, so \( x = 0.45 \) atm. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_p = (P_{SO_2})(P_{SO_3}) = (0.45)(0.45) = 0.2025 \, \text{atm}^2.
\]

This matches the \( K_p \) value of 0.203 atm² in option J.

For part (b), the equilibrium total pressure is determined when excess ferrous sulfate is placed in a flask containing an initial \( SO_2 \) pressure of 0.6 atm. Let the change in pressure due to decomposition be \( x \). At equilibrium:

\[
P_{SO_2} = 0.6 + x, \quad P_{SO_3} = x.
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_p = (0.6 + x)(x) = 0.203.
\]

Expanding and solving the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + 0.6x - 0.203 = 0.
\]

The discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = 0.6^2 + 4(1)(0.203) = 0.36 + 0.812 = 1.172,
\]

and the positive root is:

\[
x = \frac{-0.6 + \sqrt{1.172}}{2} \approx 0.241 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium partial pressures are:

\[
P_{SO_2} = 0.6 + 0.241 = 0.841 \, \text{atm}, \quad P_{SO_3} = 0.241 \, \text{atm}.
\]

The total pressure is:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = 0.841 + 0.241 = 1.082 \, \text{atm}.
\]

This matches the total pressure of 1.082 atm in option J.
