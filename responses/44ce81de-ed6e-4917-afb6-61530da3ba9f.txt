Question:

A behavioral response called a fixed action pattern shown by animals

Options:

A: is a learned behavior that can be unlearned
B: occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life

D: is a response that only occurs in the presence of other animals
E: is a response that is influenced by the animal's diet
F: is a response that develops as the animal ages

<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about a fixed action pattern in animals. Hmm, I remember from biology class that fixed action patterns are these innate behaviors, right? Like they're instinctive and not learned. So the question is asking what a fixed action pattern is, and I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Let me go through each option one by one. Option A says it's a learned behavior that can be unlearned. Wait, no, fixed action patterns are not learned; they're instinctive. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the right time. I'm not sure, but I think FAPs are usually triggered the first time the correct stimulus appears, especially during the critical period. So maybe B isn't right.

C says it only happens during sleep. That doesn't make sense. Fixed actions can occur at any time, like pecking in birds or courtship displays, which are active when the animal is awake. So C is out.

D: response only when other animals are present. No, FAPs can happen even if the animal is alone. Like a bird might court a solitary display. So D is incorrect.

E: influenced by diet. I don't think so. FAPs are more about genetics and instinct, not what the animal eats. So E is wrong.

F: develops as the animal ages. No, FAPs are present from birth or appear early in life. They don't develop over time. So F is out.

G: triggered by multiple sensory signals. Wait, I think FAPs are usually triggered by a specific, often single, stimulus. They don't need multiple signals. So G might not be correct.

H: motor response that may stop spontaneously. Hmm, FAPs are usually a sequence of movements that run to completion once started. They don't stop until finished. So H is probably wrong.

I: occurs without sensory feedback. No, FAPs are often triggered by a sensory input, like a peacock seeing something that triggers its display. So I is incorrect.

J: reflex action triggered by external stimuli. Wait, reflexes are different. Reflexes are immediate and fixed, like pulling back your hand, but fixed action patterns are more complex behaviors. So J might not be the right choice.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up fixed action patterns with reflexes. Reflexes are simple, like眨眼 when something touches the eye. FAPs are more complex, like a bird's courtship dance. They are triggered by specific stimuli but are more complex than reflexes. So J says it's a reflex action, which isn't accurate. So J is wrong.

Looking back, none of the options exactly fit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Fixed action patterns have a specific trigger and once started, they run to completion. They are not reflexes but are instinctive.

Wait, option H says it's a motor response that may terminate spontaneously. No, FAPs usually go to completion once initiated. So H is wrong.

Option B: occurs the second time. No, I think FAPs occur when the correct stimulus is present, usually the first time. Maybe B is not correct.

Option G: triggered by multiple sensory signals. I'm not sure. Maybe it's triggered by a single strong stimulus. So G might not be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think of an example. Like a bird's song. Once the bird is triggered, it goes through the whole song. That's a FAP. So the trigger is a specific stimulus, like seeing another bird or a certain sound.

Wait, another angle: fixed action patterns are stereotyped and can't be stopped once started. So looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option H says it may be terminated spontaneously. No, FAPs run to completion. So H is wrong.

Option I: occurs without sensory feedback. No, the FAP is usually triggered by a sensory input but doesn't need ongoing feedback. So I is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

A: Learned? No.

B: Second time? No, first exposure.

C: Sleep? No.

D: Other animals? No.

E: Diet? No.

F: Develops with age? No.

G: Multiple signals? Maybe not.

H: Terminated? No.

I: No feedback? Not sure.

J: Reflex? No.

Wait, maybe none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Let me think again.

Oh wait, option H says it's a motor response that may terminate spontaneously. But FAPs don't terminate until they finish. So H is incorrect.

Option I: occurs without sensory feedback. No, because the trigger is a sensory input.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe option B is correct. It says occurs the second time with the correct stimulus. But I thought FAPs are triggered the first time the stimulus is encountered. So maybe B is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H. Because fixed action patterns are motor responses, and once released, they continue until completion. So H says "may be terminated spontaneously," which would be wrong because they don't stop until done. So H is incorrect.

Wait, maybe option B is correct because it's the second exposure. No, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the definition.

Fixed action patterns are stereotyped, innate behaviors that are triggered by specific stimuli. Once initiated, they proceed to completion. They are not learned and are more complex than reflexes. So looking at the options, which one fits?

Option B: occurs the second time. No.

Option H: motor response that may stop. No.

Option J: reflex. No.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe option I is correct because once the FAP starts, it doesn't need ongoing sensory input. For example, once the bird starts singing, it doesn't need to keep sensing the trigger. So I: occurs in the absence of sensory feedback. That might be correct.

Alternatively, maybe option I is correct because after the initial trigger, the behavior doesn't require ongoing sensory input. So the FAP continues even if the stimulus is no longer present.

If that's the case, then option I would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Fixed action patterns are also known as instinctive behaviors. They are released by a specific stimulus and then proceed automatically. So for example, a peacock's tail display starts when a female is present, and once started, it continues without further sensory input.

So, in that case, option I: occurs in the absence of sensory feedback. That would be correct because after the initial trigger, the behavior continues even without the stimulus.

Wait, but the question is about the occurrence of the FAP, not the continuation. So the trigger is sensory input, but once started, it doesn't need feedback.

So option I says it occurs in the absence of sensory feedback, which might mean that the behavior can happen without any input. But actually, the FAP is triggered by sensory input. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps option I is correct because after the initial trigger, the behavior continues without further sensory input. So the FAP occurs after the stimulus is no longer present.

Wait, but the question is about the occurrence of the FAP, not whether it stops. So maybe the correct answer is H or I.

Alternatively, perhaps option H is incorrect because FAPs don't stop until completion.

Wait, another angle: Fixed action patterns are motor responses that are triggered once a specific stimulus is detected, and they proceed to completion regardless of any changes in the environment or lack of feedback. So, once started, they don't stop until finished.

Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option H: may be terminated spontaneously. No, they don't stop until done.

Option I: occurs without sensory feedback. Yes, because after the initial trigger, the behavior continues even without feedback.

So I think option I is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check another source. Oh wait, I can't access external sources. I'll have to rely on my memory.

I think fixed action patterns are triggered by a specific stimulus and then proceed automatically. They don't require ongoing sensory input once started. So the behavior occurs in the absence of ongoing sensory feedback.

So the correct answer would be option I: occurs in the absence of sensory feedback.

But wait, another thought: the presence of the stimulus is needed to trigger it, but after that, the behavior can continue without it. So the FAP occurs (i.e., starts) with the stimulus, but continues without it. So the occurrence refers to the entire behavior, which can happen without the stimulus once it's started.

So in that case, the answer would be I.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, option H might be about whether the response can be stopped. Since FAPs can't be stopped, H is wrong.

So, putting it all together, the best option is I: occurs in the absence of sensory feedback.
</think>

The question asks about a fixed action pattern (FAP), which is an innate, stereotyped behavior triggered by specific stimuli and proceeds to completion once initiated. FAPs are not learned, do not require ongoing sensory input after starting, and cannot be stopped until they are finished. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as FAPs are not learned behaviors.  
- **B**: Incorrect, as FAPs are typically triggered the first time the correct stimulus is encountered.  
- **C**: Incorrect, as FAPs can occur at any time, not just during sleep.  
- **D**: Incorrect, as FAPs can occur even when other animals are absent.  
- **E**: Incorrect, as FAPs are not influenced by diet but are genetically determined.  
- **F**: Incorrect, as FAPs are present from birth or early life, not developed over time.  
- **G**: Incorrect, as FAPs are usually triggered by a single specific stimulus, not multiple signals.  
- **H**: Incorrect, as FAPs cannot be terminated spontaneously; they run to completion.  
- **I**: Correct, as FAPs can continue without ongoing sensory feedback once initiated.  
- **J**: Incorrect, as FAPs are more complex than reflexes and not reflex actions.

The correct answer is **I**, as FAPs occur in the absence of sensory feedback after the initial trigger.
