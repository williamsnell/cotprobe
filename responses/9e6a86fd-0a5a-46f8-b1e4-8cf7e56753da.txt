Question:

In the procedure Mystery below, the parameter number is a positive integer.

 PROCEDURE Mystery (number)
 {
  REPEAT UNTIL (number <= 0)
  {
   number ← number - 2
  }
  IF (number = 0)
  {
   RETURN (true)
  }
  ELSE
  {
   RETURN (false)
  }
 }

 Which of the following best describes the result of running the procedure Mystery?

Options:

A: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is a multiple of 2 or 3, and it otherwise returns false.
B: The procedure returns false when the initial value of number is greater than 2, and it otherwise returns true.
C: The procedure returns false when the initial value of number is a prime number, and it otherwise returns true.
D: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is odd, and it otherwise returns false.
E: The procedure returns false when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns true.
F: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is less than 2, and it otherwise returns false.
G: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false.
H: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is 2, and it otherwise returns false.
I: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is a prime number, and it otherwise returns false.
J: The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is greater than 2, and it otherwise returns false.

Alright, so I've got this programming problem to solve. The question is about a procedure called Mystery that takes a positive integer as a parameter. I need to figure out what the procedure does and then match it to the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by reading the procedure carefully.

The procedure is written in pseudocode. It says:

PROCEDURE Mystery (number)
{
  REPEAT UNTIL (number <= 0)
  {
   number ← number - 2
  }
  IF (number = 0)
  {
   RETURN (true)
  }
  ELSE
  {
   RETURN (false)
  }
}

So, the procedure starts by entering a loop that subtracts 2 from 'number' each time, repeating until 'number' is less than or equal to 0. After the loop, it checks if 'number' is exactly 0. If it is, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what this loop is doing. Since it subtracts 2 each time until the number drops to 0 or below, the loop effectively subtracts 2 as many times as possible. So, for example, if the initial number is 4, subtracting 2 twice brings it to 0. If it's 5, subtracting 2 twice brings it to 1, and then the loop stops because 1 is greater than 0 but the next subtraction would make it -1, which is <=0, so the loop ends.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The loop condition is "REPEAT UNTIL (number <= 0)", which means it continues to execute the block until the condition is met. So, each time the loop runs, it subtracts 2. So for number=5:

Loop 1: 5-2=3 → still >0, loop again.
Loop 2: 3-2=1 → still >0, loop again.
Loop 3: 1-2= -1 → now <=0, so loop stops.

So after the loop, number is -1.

Then, the procedure checks if number is 0. It's not, so it returns false.

Wait another example: number=6.

Loop 1:6-2=4 → loop again.
Loop 2:4-2=2 → loop again.
Loop3:2-2=0 → loop again because 0 is <=0? Wait no, the condition is to repeat until (number <=0). So when number is 2, subtract 2 to get 0. Then the loop condition is checked again: 0 <=0 is true, so the loop stops.

So after the loop, number is 0. Then it returns true.

Another example: number=3.

Loop 1:3-2=1 → loop again.
Loop 2:1-2=-1 → now <=0, loop stops.
So number is -1 → returns false.

Number=2:

Loop 1:2-2=0 → loop stops because 0<=0.
Then returns true.

Number=1:

Loop runs once: 1-2=-1 → loop stops.
Check: number is -1, not 0 → return false.

Number=0: Well, the initial condition is that number is a positive integer, but I guess if someone calls it with 0, the loop doesn't run, and it returns true because number is 0.

But the problem says the parameter is a positive integer, so initial number is at least 1.

Let me try to see the pattern here. The procedure returns true only when after subtracting 2 multiple times, the number becomes exactly 0. That means the initial number must be an even number, right? Because subtracting 2 repeatedly from an even number can bring it down to 0.

Wait, but wait: Let me test that.

If the initial number is even, say 4 → yes, returns true.

If it's odd, like 5 → after subtracting 2 as much as possible, it ends up at -1, which is not 0 → returns false.

Wait, but what about number=2? It returns true.

Number=6 → returns true.

Number=8 → yes.

So it seems that the procedure returns true if the initial number is even, and false if it's odd.

Wait, but wait another example: what about number=0, but the initial input is positive, so that's not applicable.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let's take number=2: it returns true. Number=4: true. Number=6: true.

But what about number=1: returns false. Number=3: false. Number=5: false.

So the procedure returns true if the initial number is even, because subtracting 2 repeatedly can reach 0.

So the answer should be that the procedure returns true when the initial number is even, else false.

Looking at the options:

Option G says: The procedure returns true when the initial value is even, else false. That's exactly what I concluded.

Wait, but let me check if there are exceptions. What about number=0? The initial number is a positive integer, so 0 is not allowed. But if someone passes 0, the loop doesn't run, and it returns true. But the problem states the parameter is a positive integer, so 0 isn't considered in the initial call.

Wait another case: number= -2? But the parameter is a positive integer, so that's not possible.

So the conclusion is that the procedure returns true if the initial number is even, else false. So the correct option is G.

The procedure subtracts 2 from `number` repeatedly until it becomes ≤0. It returns `true` if `number` is exactly 0 after the loop, which happens when the initial `number` is even.

Answer: G

The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false.
