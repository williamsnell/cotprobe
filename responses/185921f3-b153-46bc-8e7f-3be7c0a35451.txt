Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the percentage of aluminum sulfate in an impure sample. Hmm, I've done some stoichiometry problems before, but this one seems a bit involved. Let me take it slow.

Alright, the problem says that an impure sample of aluminum sulfate was analyzed by reacting it with excess barium chloride to form barium sulfate precipitate. After washing and drying, they got 2.000 grams of BaSO4. The original sample weighed 1.000 g. I need to find the percentage of aluminum sulfate in the sample.

First, I think I should write down what's given. We have Al2(SO4)3 reacting with BaCl2. The reaction should produce BaSO4 as a precipitate because BaSO4 is insoluble. So, the first thing I should do is write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction.

Let me try to write the reaction. Aluminum sulfate and barium chloride reacting. The products would be barium sulfate and... since Al is in +3 oxidation state and Cl is -1, the other product should be aluminum chloride. So, the reaction is:

Al2(SO4)3 + BaCl2 → BaSO4 + AlCl3

Wait, but how many moles of each reactant are involved? Let me balance it.

On the left, I have 2 Al, 3 SO4^2- groups, and BaCl2. On the right, BaSO4 has Ba^2+ and SO4^2-, so that's one Ba and one SO4 per formula unit. AlCl3 has one Al per formula unit.

So, balancing Al: On the left, there are 2 Al atoms in Al2(SO4)3. On the right, each AlCl3 has 1 Al, so I need 2 AlCl3 to balance Al. So, I'll write:

Al2(SO4)3 + 3 BaCl2 → 2 BaSO4 + 2 AlCl3

Wait, let me check. Let's count each element:

Al: 2 on left, 2 on right (from 2 AlCl3) — that's good.
S: 3 on left (from Al2(SO4)3), and 2 on right (from 2 BaSO4) — wait, that's not balanced. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the coefficients.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is Al2(SO4)3, which has 3 SO4^2- ions. Each BaCl2 provides one SO4^2- when it reacts? No, wait, wait. Let me think. The reaction should be:

Each Al2(SO4)3 can provide 3 SO4^2- ions. Each BaCl2 provides Ba^2+ and Cl^-.

So, when Al2(SO4)3 reacts with BaCl2, each SO4^2- will combine with Ba^2+ to form BaSO4. So, the reaction is:

Al2(SO4)3 + 3 BaCl2 → 3 BaSO4 + 2 AlCl3

Wait, let me check that again. That way, each Al2(SO4)3 (which has 3 SO4^2-) will react with 3 BaCl2 to produce 3 BaSO4. So, the balanced equation would be:

Al2(SO4)3 + 3 BaCl2 → 3 BaSO4 + 2 AlCl3

Yes, that looks right. Now, let's verify the counts:

Al: 2 on left, 2 from AlCl3 on right — correct.
S: 3 on left, 3 from BaSO4 on right — correct.
O: Let's not worry about O since it's in the sulfate and water isn't involved.
Ba: 3 on left (from BaCl2), 3 on right (BaSO4) — correct.
Cl: 3×2=6 on left (from BaCl2), 2×3=6 on right (from AlCl3) — correct.

Great, so the balanced equation is correct.

Now, the problem says that after precipitation, 2.000 g of BaSO4 was obtained. We need to find how much Al2(SO4)3 was present in the original 1.000 g sample.

So, the approach is to find moles of BaSO4, use the stoichiometry to find moles of Al2(SO4)3, then calculate the mass of Al2(SO4)3, and finally find the percentage in the original sample.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of BaSO4 from its mass.
2. Use the balanced equation to find moles of Al2(SO4)3.
3. Convert moles of Al2(SO4)3 to mass.
4. Calculate the percentage in the original sample.

Let's start with step 1: moles of BaSO4.

The molar mass of BaSO4 is:

Ba: 137.33 g/mol
S: 32.07 g/mol
O: 16.00 ×4 = 64.00 g/mol
Total: 137.33 + 32.07 + 64 = 233.40 g/mol

So, moles of BaSO4 = mass / molar mass = 2.000 g / 233.40 g/mol ≈ 0.008577 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

2.000 divided by 233.40:

233.40 × 0.008 = 1.8672. 233.40 × 0.008577 ≈ 2.000. Let me use a calculator.

2.000 / 233.40 ≈ 0.008577 mol.

Step 2: From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Al2(SO4)3 produces 3 moles of BaSO4. So, the mole ratio is 1:3.

So, moles of Al2(SO4)3 = moles of BaSO4 × (1/3) = 0.008577 /3 ≈ 0.002859 mol.

Wait, let me compute that: 0.008577 ÷ 3 = approximately 0.002859 mol.

Step 3: Find the molar mass of Al2(SO4)3.

Al: 26.98 g/mol ×2 = 53.96 g/mol
S: 32.07 ×3 = 96.21 g/mol
O: 4 ×3 ×16.00 = 192 g/mol (Wait, wait, wait. Each SO4^2- has 4 O, and there are 3 SO4^2- in Al2(SO4)3. So, 3×4=12 O atoms, each 16 g/mol → 192 g/mol.)

So total molar mass = 53.96 + 96.21 + 192 = 53.96 + 96.21 = 150.17; 150.17 + 192 = 342.17 g/mol.

Wait, let me compute that again:

Al: 26.98 ×2 =53.96
S: 32.07 ×3 =96.21
O: 4×3×16.00= 192.00

So 53.96 + 96.21 = 150.17; 150.17 +192= 342.17 g/mol.

So, moles of Al2(SO4)3 is 0.002859 mol. So mass is moles × molar mass = 0.002859 ×342.17 ≈ let's compute that.

0.002859 × 342.17 ≈ let's see:

0.002859 ×300 = 0.8577
0.002859 ×42.17 ≈ approximately 0.002859 ×40=0.11436, and 0.002859×2.17≈0.00620. So total ≈0.11436+0.00620=0.12056.

So total mass ≈0.8577 + 0.12056 ≈0.97826 grams.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Wait, because the original sample was 1.000 g, and the aluminum sulfate is 0.978 g, that would make the percentage about 97.8%, which is one of the options (option D). But let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in the steps.

Wait, let's compute 0.002859 ×342.17 more accurately.

0.002859 ×342.17:

Let me compute 0.002859 ×342.17.

First, 342.17 × 0.002 = 0.68434

342.17 ×0.0008 =0.273736

342.17 ×0.00005 =0.0171085

342.17 ×0.000009 = approximately 3.07953 ×10^-3.

Adding them up:

0.68434 + 0.273736 = 0.958076

+0.0171085 = 0.9751845

+0.00307953 (since 3.07953e-3 is approx 0.0030795) → 0.9751845 +0.0030795 ≈ 0.978264 g.

So, mass of Al2(SO4)3 is approximately 0.97826 g.

Wait, so the original sample was 1.000 g, so the percentage is (0.97826 /1.000) ×100 = 97.826%, which rounds to 97.8% — that's option D.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option D is 97.8%. So that seems correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation of moles of BaSO4. Let me double-check that.

BaSO4: 233.39 g/mol (I think I used 233.40, which is correct).

2.000 g /233.39 g/mol ≈ 0.008577 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, moles of Al2(SO4)3 = (1/3) × 0.008577 = 0.002859 mol.

Molar mass of Al2(SO4)3: 342.15 g/mol (I think I had 342.17, which is correct).

0.002859 ×342.15 → let me compute that again.

0.002859 ×342.15:

342.15 ×0.002 =0.6843

342.15 ×0.0008 = 0.27372

342.15 ×0.00005=0.0171075

342.15 ×0.000009=0.00307935

Adding up:

0.6843 + 0.27372 = 0.95802

+0.0171075 = 0.9751275

+0.00307935 ≈ 0.97820685 grams.

So, approximately 0.9782 g. So, when the original sample was 1.000 g, the percentage is 97.82%, which is 97.8% when rounded to three significant figures, which matches option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the options, option D is 97.8%, which seems high. But let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me re-examine the balanced equation.

The balanced equation is:

Al2(SO4)3 + 3 BaCl2 → 3 BaSO4 + 2 AlCl3

So, 1 mole of Al2(SO4)3 produces 3 moles of BaSO4.

So, moles of Al2(SO4)3 = moles of BaSO4 /3.

Yes, that's correct. So 0.008577 /3 = 0.002859.

Another way: if 3 moles of BaSO4 come from 1 mole of Al2(SO4)3, then 0.008577 moles of BaSO4 come from 0.008577 /3 moles of Al2(SO4)3.

That's correct.

So, the mass of Al2(SO4)3 is 0.002859 ×342.15 ≈0.978 g.

So, the percentage is (0.978 /1.000) ×100 =97.8%.

So, the correct answer is D:97.8%.

Wait, but I just noticed that some of the options are much lower, like option B is 84.3% and C is 66.7%. So, 97.8% seems high, but given the data, it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar masses.

Wait, let me recheck the molar masses.

BaSO4: Ba is 137.33, S is 32.07, O4 is 64. So 137.33 +32.07=169.4 +64=233.4 g/mol. Correct.

Al2(SO4)3: Al is 26.98 ×2=53.96; S is 32.07 ×3=96.21; O is 4×3×16=192. So total is 53.96 +96.21=150.17 +192=342.17 g/mol. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given data is 2.000 g and 1.000 g, which are four significant figures. So, the answer should be precise to four sig figs, but the options are given to three decimal places, so 97.8% is appropriate.

Wait, 0.978264 is approximately 97.826%, which rounds to 97.8% as option D.

So, I think the correct answer is D: 97.8%.

The problem involves determining the percentage of aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃) in an impure sample by analyzing the precipitate of barium sulfate (BaSO₄) formed from the reaction with excess BaCl₂. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:

\[
\text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 + 3 \text{BaCl}_2 \rightarrow 3 \text{BaSO}_4 + 2 \text{AlCl}_3
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of BaSO₄
The molar mass of BaSO₄ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Ba}: 137.33 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{S}: 32.07 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{O}_4: 4 \times 16.00 = 64.00 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
\text{Molar mass of BaSO}_4 = 137.33 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 233.40 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
The moles of BaSO₄ precipitated are:
\[
\text{Moles of BaSO}_4 = \frac{\text{Mass of BaSO}_4}{\text{Molar mass of BaSO}_4} = \frac{2.000 \, \text{g}}{233.40 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.008577 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Relate moles of BaSO₄ to Al₂(SO₄)₃
From the balanced equation, 3 moles of BaSO₄ are produced from 1 mole of Al₂(SO₄)₃. Thus, the moles of Al₂(SO₄)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = \frac{\text{Moles of BaSO}_4}{3} = \frac{0.008577}{3} \approx 0.002859 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate mass of Al₂(SO₄)₃
The molar mass of Al₂(SO₄)₃ is:
\[
\text{Al}_2: 2 \times 26.98 = 53.96 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{S}_3: 3 \times 32.07 = 96.21 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{O}_{12}: 12 \times 16.00 = 192.00 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
\text{Molar mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = 53.96 + 96.21 + 192.00 = 342.17 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
The mass of Al₂(SO₄)₃ is:
\[
\text{Mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = \text{Moles of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 \times \text{Molar mass} = 0.002859 \, \text{mol} \times 342.17 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 0.978 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate percentage of Al₂(SO₄)₃ in the sample
The original sample weighed 1.000 g. The percentage of Al₂(SO₄)₃ is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3}{\text{Mass of sample}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.978}{1.000} \right) \times 100 \approx 97.8\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of aluminum sulfate in the sample is **97.8%**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
