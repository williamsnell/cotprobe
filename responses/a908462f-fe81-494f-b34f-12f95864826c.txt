Okay, so I have this question about the walls of bronchioles and what they contain. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my respiratory anatomy, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that the respiratory system has different levels of airways. The trachea is the main one, and it's supported by cartilage rings. Then it branches into bronchi, which also have cartilage, I think. But when it gets down to the bronchioles, things change a bit.

Wait, the bronchioles are smaller than the bronchi. I recall that the walls of the bronchioles don't have cartilage. Instead, they're made up of smooth muscle and some epithelial cells. Oh right, the epithelium is the lining, which is respiratory epithelium in this case.

So the question is asking what's in the walls of bronchioles. Options are A to J. Let me look at the options:

A: cartilage and respiratory epithelium. No, because I don't think bronchioles have cartilage.

B: Only respiratory epithelium. That might not be right because I remember smooth muscle being present too.

C: Only cartilage. Definitely not, since cartilage is in the larger bronchi, not the bronchioles.

D: Respiratory epithelium and cartilage. No, same as A, cartilage isn't there.

E: smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium. That sounds right because I think the walls have smooth muscle and the lining is respiratory epithelium.

F: Only smooth muscle. Not sure, but I think the epithelium is also part of the wall.

G: cartilage, smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium. No, because cartilage isn't in bronchioles.

H: No such structures. That can't be right; bronchioles definitely have structures.

I: cartilage and smooth muscle. No, because again, no cartilage.

J: Smooth muscle and cartilage. Still, cartilage isn't there, so J is out.

So the correct answer must be E: smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium.
