Options:

A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.
B: Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 will not create a contract.
C: Fred stating on April 5, "I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000" creates a contract.
D: Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 11 will create a contract.

Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. So, the question is about contract law, specifically regarding offers and acceptances. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

So, James makes a written offer to Fred to sell land for $100,000. The offer states it's not revocable for a ten-day period. The offer was signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and Fred received it on April 5. Now, we have to look at each option and figure out which is correct.

First, I need to recall the rules about offers and revocation. Normally, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, unless the revocation is communicated after the offer has been accepted or if there's a consideration preventing revocation, like a promise not to revoke.

In this case, James says the offer is irrevocable for ten days. So, that probably means the offer can't be revoked during those ten days. Wait, but when does the ten-day period start? I think it starts when the offer is received by the offeree, unless otherwise stated. Hmm, but sometimes, the offer might specify the start date. Let me think. The offer was signed on April 1, but Fred received it on April 5. So, does the ten-day period start on April 1 or April 5? I think it starts when the offer is received because that's when the offer becomes effective. So, the offer would be irrevocable from April 5 for ten days, meaning until April 15.

Wait, but James might have a different view. Let me check the rules again. Oh right, the offer's terms control. If the offer says it's irrevocable for ten days, then the period starts when the offer is made, but I think the revocation period is based on when the offer is received. Or does it depend on the terms of the offer? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says James states, "This offer will not be revocable for a ten-day period of time." So, it's a unilateral promise by James not to revoke the offer for ten days. So, the offer is firm for ten days from when? From when the offer was made, or from when it was received? I think it's from when the offer was received because that's when the offeree can act on it. So, the effective period starts April 5, making it until April 15. So James can't revoke it during that time.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 won't create a contract if James dies on April 4. Wait, but April 5 is the day Fred receives the offer. So, if James dies before April 5, does that affect the offer? Well, death would typically make an offer void because the offeror can't perform. But wait, the offer is an offer to sell land, which is a contract. If James dies before Fred accepts, the offer would be automatically revoked because James can't fulfill the contract. So, if James dies on April 4, before Fred even receives the offer on April 5, then when Fred accepts on April 5, there's no offer anymore. So, no contract. So option A is correct in that scenario.

Option B: Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10. April 10 is within the ten-day period (from April 5 to April 15), so the offer is still valid. So Fred's acceptance on April 10 would create a contract. Wait, but option B says it won't create a contract. So that would be incorrect. So B is wrong.

Option C: Fred says on April 5, "I accept, but pay only $90,000." That's a counteroffer, not an acceptance. Because Fred is modifying the terms. So, this would not create a contract; instead, it would be a rejection and a counteroffer. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Fred accepts on April 11. That's still within the ten-day period (ends April 15), so the offer is still valid. So D would create a contract, making D correct. But wait, the options say D says it will create a contract, so that's correct.

Option E: Fred on April 6 says, "I accept, but pay in 60 days." Again, this is a modification. So it's a counteroffer, not an acceptance. So E is incorrect because it doesn't create a contract.

Option F: James revokes on April 4. If the offer is irrevocable from April 5 to April 15, then James can't revoke it on April 4 because that's before the effective period starts. So revoking on April 4 wouldn't affect the offer because the offer is already irrevocable from April 5. So F is incorrect because the revocation on April 4 is valid before the irrevocable period, but since the offer was received on April 5, the revocation can't be done after that. Wait, but if James tries to revoke on April 4, before the offer is received, then the revocation would take effect, and Fred wouldn't have a valid offer when he receives it on April 5. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, the offer says it's not revocable for ten days. So, James can't revoke during that time. So if he tries to revoke before the ten days, can he? Let's see. The offer is irrevocable for ten days, so during those ten days, James can't revoke. So if he revokes on April 4, which is before the ten-day period (assuming it starts April 5), then he can revoke because the period hasn't started yet. Therefore, if he revokes on April 4, the offer is revoked, and Fred can't accept on April 5 because there's no offer anymore. So F says James revoking on April 4 won't invalidate the contract. But if he revokes before the offer is received, then Fred never gets a valid offer. So if Fred accepts on April 5, there's no offer, so no contract. So F's statement that revoking on April 4 won't invalidate the contract is correct because the contract was never formed because the offer was revoked before Fred accepted. Wait, but F says "will not invalidate the contract." So if James revokes on April 4, and Fred accepts on April 5, there's no contract because the offer was revoked. So F's statement is correct in that case. So F might be correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to clarify:

- Offer is made on April 1, sent April 3, received April 5.

- Offer states it's irrevocable for ten days. So the irrevocable period starts when the offer is received, April 5, and lasts until April 15.

- If James revokes on April 4, which is before the offer is received, then he can revoke because the offer hasn't become irrevocable yet. So the revocation would be effective, meaning when Fred receives the offer on April 5, it's already revoked. So Fred's acceptance on April 5 would be ineffective because the offer was revoked on April 4.

So, if James revokes on April 4, when Fred accepts on April 5, there's no offer, so no contract is formed. So F says, "James revoking on April 4 will not invalidate the contract." Wait, but if the contract wasn't formed because the offer was revoked, then the contract was never created, so F's statement is correct because the revocation doesn't affect a contract that doesn't exist. So F's statement is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option F: "James revoking the offer on April 4 will not invalidate the contract." So if the contract is not formed because the offer was revoked before acceptance, then revoking on April 4 doesn't affect any contract because there isn't one. So F is correct in saying it won't invalidate the contract because the contract doesn't exist.

Wait, but if the revocation on April 4 is before the offer becomes irrevocable, then yes, the revocation is valid, so the offer is revoked, and Fred's acceptance on April 5 can't form a contract. So F is correct.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check each option again.

Option A: Correct if James dies before April 5. Because then the offer is automatically revoked, so Fred's acceptance on April 5 wouldn't create a contract.

Option D: Correct if Fred accepts on April 11, which is within the ten-day period, so the offer is still valid, creating a contract.

But wait, the question asks which of the following is true. So multiple options could be correct, but in a multiple-choice question, only one is correct.

Wait, but looking again:

Option B: Fred accepts on April 10. That's within the ten-day period (April 5 to April 15), so the offer is valid, and the acceptance creates a contract. So B says it won't create a contract, which is incorrect.

Option D: Acceptance on April 11 is within the period, so it creates a contract. So D is correct.

But wait, let's check the time frame. The offer is irrevocable for ten days from when? If it's from April 5, then April 15 is the last day. So April 11 is within that period, so D is correct.

Option F: If James revokes on April 4, which is before the offer is received, then the revocation is effective, so Fred's acceptance on April 5 can't form a contract. So F's statement that the revocation won't invalidate the contract is correct because the contract never existed.

Hmm, but in the options, both A and F could be correct. Wait, but let me read the options again.

Option A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.

If James dies on April 4, before the offer is received, then the offer is revoked, so when Fred accepts on April 5, there's no offer, so no contract. So A is correct.

Option F: James revokes on April 4, which would revoke the offer before it's received, so Fred's acceptance on April 5 doesn't create a contract. So F says the revocation won't invalidate the contract because there's no contract, which is correct.

But wait, the question is asking which of the following is true. So both A and F could be correct. But looking back at the options, I think only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the revocation period. Let me think again. The offer says it's not revocable for ten days. So the revocation is prevented during those ten days. So if the offer is received on April 5, then James cannot revoke it from April 5 to April 15. So if he tries to revoke on April 4, before the period starts, he can revoke because the offer hasn't become irrevocable yet. So option F is correct in saying that revoking on April 4 won't invalidate the contract because the revocation is effective, and there's no contract.

So, looking at the options, both A and F could be correct, but let me see the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 won't create a contract if James dies on April 4.

F: James revoking on April 4 won't invalidate the contract.

So if James dies on April 4, the offer is automatically revoked, so when Fred accepts on April 5, no contract. Similarly, if James revokes on April 4, the offer is revoked, so same result. So both A and F would be correct in their respective scenarios.

But the question is which statement is true. So both A and F could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me check the rules again. If James dies before the offer is accepted, the offer is revoked. Similarly, if James revokes before acceptance, the offer is revoked. So in both cases, the acceptance wouldn't form a contract.

So, looking back at the options, both A and F are correct in their own scenarios. But since the question is about which statement is true, perhaps both A and F are correct. But that can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The offer is irrevocable for ten days from when it's received. So from April 5 to April 15.

Option F: James revokes on April 4. Since the revocation period starts on April 5, he can revoke on April 4 because the period hasn't started yet. So the revocation is effective, and when Fred accepts on April 5, there's no offer, so no contract. So F is correct.

Option A: James dies on April 4. His death makes the offer void, so Fred's acceptance on April 5 can't form a contract. So A is correct.

So both A and F are correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, the options are from A to J, but the user only listed up to F. So I need to see which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps in the case of death, the offer is automatically revoked, so A is correct. Similarly, in F, the revocation on April 4 is valid, so F is correct. So both A and F are correct.

But in the options, only one can be correct. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the death of the offeror doesn't make the offer automatically revoked unless it's a unilateral contract or if the subject matter is land. Wait, James is offering to sell land. In the common law, an offer to sell land is considered a real covenant, meaning that if the offeror dies before acceptance, the offer is revoked. So in that case, A is correct.

Similarly, James revoking on April 4 is valid because the revocation period hasn't started yet, so F is correct.

But perhaps in the answer options, only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: If James dies on April 4, no contract.

B: Acceptance on April 10 doesn't create contract.

C: Fred's modified acceptance creates contract.

D: Acceptance on April 11 creates contract.

E: Modified acceptance creates contract.

F: Revoking on April 4 doesn't invalidate the contract.

Wait, but if the revocation on April 4 is valid, then when Fred accepts on April 5, there's no offer, so no contract. So F is correct in saying that the revocation doesn't invalidate the contract because the contract wasn't formed.

So both A and F are correct in their own ways.

But looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Maybe the intended answer is A or F.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the revocation period starts when the offer is made, not when received. Let me think again.

The offer was made on April 1, sent April 3, received April 5. The offer says it's not revocable for ten days. So the revocation period is from April 1 for ten days, ending April 11. So if that's the case, James can't revoke from April 1 to April 11.

If he revokes on April 4, which is within the revocation period, then the revocation is ineffective. So Fred's acceptance on April 5 would create a contract because the offer is still valid.

Wait, this is a different approach. So if the revocation period starts when the offer is made, then James can't revoke from April 1 to April 11. So if he tries to revoke on April 4, it's within the period, so the revocation is ineffective. So the offer remains open until April 11.

In that case, Fred's acceptance on April 5 would create a contract because the offer is still valid.

But this changes things. So perhaps the revocation period starts when the offer is made, not when received. So the offer is irrevocable from April 1 to April 11.

So, James can't revoke during that time. So if he tries to revoke on April 4, it's within the period, so the revocation is ineffective. So the offer remains valid, and Fred's acceptance on April 5 would form a contract.

In that case, option F would be incorrect because James can't revoke on April 4.

But this is conflicting with my earlier understanding. I think the revocation period usually starts when the offer becomes effective, which is when it's received by the offeree.

So, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify the rule.

Generally, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, unless the revocation is after the offer has become irrevocable, either by law or by the terms of the offer.

In this case, the offer says it's irrevocable for ten days. The question is, when does the ten-day period start? From when the offer is made or when it's received.

I think it starts when the offer is received by the offeree because that's when the offeree can act on it. So the revocation period starts on April 5, making it until April 15.

So, in that case, James can't revoke from April 5 to April 15.

If he revokes on April 4, before the offer is received, then he can revoke, and the offer is revoked. So Fred's acceptance on April 5 would be ineffective.

Therefore, option F is correct because the revocation on April 4 is valid, so the contract isn't formed, making F's statement correct.

Similarly, if James dies on April 4, the offer is revoked, so A is correct.

But since the options are separate, perhaps both A and F are correct, but in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the options are A through F, and the correct answer is one of them.

I think the correct answer is A and F are both correct, but perhaps only one is presented as an option.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 won't create a contract if James dies on April 4.

F: James revoking on April 4 won't invalidate the contract.

So both A and F are correct because in both cases, the contract isn't formed.

But the question is which of the following is true. So both A and F are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the death scenario.

Wait, when the offeror dies, the offer is automatically revoked, so Fred's acceptance on April 5 can't form a contract. So A is correct.

Similarly, if James revokes on April 4, the offer is revoked, so F is correct.

But the options don't have both as correct, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is A and F are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says James makes a written offer, so it's a unilateral offer. So in the case of death, the offer is revoked, so A is correct.

In the case of F, the revocation on April 4 is before the offer is received, so it's valid, making F correct.

But perhaps the intended answer is A and F are correct, but in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: Correct.

F: Correct.

But perhaps the question is structured such that only one is correct.

Wait, looking again, the options:

A: Correct because James's death on April 4 revokes the offer, so no contract.

D: Correct because acceptance on April 11 is within the irrevocable period, so contract is formed.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, D is correct.

Wait, let me clarify:

If the revocation period is from April 5 to April 15, then:

- Fred accepts on April 5: valid.

- Accepts on April 10: valid.

- Accepts on April 11: valid.

- Accepts on April 15: valid.

But if the revocation period is from April 1 to April 11, then:

- Revocation on April 4 is within the period, so offer remains valid.

So, if the revocation period starts on April 1, then James can't revoke until April 11. So if he revokes on April 4, the revocation is ineffective, so the offer is still valid when Fred accepts on April 5.

This changes the analysis.

So, if the revocation period starts when the offer is made (April 1), then the offer is irrevocable until April 11.

So, in that case:

Option F: James revokes on April 4, which is within the irrevocable period, so the revocation is ineffective. Therefore, the offer remains valid, and Fred's acceptance on April 5 would form a contract. So F's statement that revoking on April 4 won't invalidate the contract is incorrect because the revocation is ineffective, so the offer is still valid.

Wait, F says that James revoking on April 4 won't invalidate the contract. If the revocation is ineffective, then the contract can still be formed, so F's statement is correct because the contract would be formed, but F says it won't be invalidated, which is correct because the revocation didn't work.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. I think I need to conclude.

The correct answer is likely A and D.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the intended answer is A and D are correct. But looking at the options, the correct ones are:

A: Correct.

D: Correct.

But in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and F.

But I think the intended answer is A and D are correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and D.

But I'm going to make a choice based on the analysis.

The correct answer is A and D.

But looking at the options, let me see:

Option A: Correct.

Option D: Correct.

But since the question asks which is true, perhaps both are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and D.

But in the options, only one can be correct. I think the intended answer is A and D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and F.

But I'm going to settle on A and D being correct, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and F.

But I'm not sure. I think I've spent enough time, and I'll conclude that the correct answers are A and F.
</think>

The question revolves around the validity of an offer and the circumstances under which a contract is formed. James makes a written offer to Fred to sell land for $100,000, stating the offer is irrevocable for ten days. The offer is signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and received by Fred on April 5. The key issue is determining the start of the ten-day irrevocable period and the consequences of revocation or death of the offeror.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Revocation Period Start**: The offer states it is irrevocable for ten days. Typically, the irrevocable period starts when the offer is received by the offeree (April 5), making it valid until April 15. However, if the period starts when the offer is made (April 1), it would end on April 11.

2. **Option A**: If James dies on April 4, before the offer is received, the offer is automatically revoked. Fred's acceptance on April 5 would not create a contract because the offer had already been invalidated. Thus, **A is correct**.

3. **Option F**: If James revokes on April 4, before the offer is received, the revocation is effective. Fred's acceptance on April 5 would not create a contract because the offer had been revoked. Thus, **F is correct**.

4. **Option D**: If Fred accepts on April 11, within the ten-day period (assuming it starts on April 5), the offer is still valid, and a contract is formed. Thus, **D is correct**.

### Conclusion:
Both **A** and **F** are correct because they describe scenarios where the contract is not formed due to revocation or death before acceptance. However, if the revocation period starts on April 1, **D** is also correct because the offer remains valid until April 11. Based on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:

**A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.**

ANSWER: A
