Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an electric dipole in an electric field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The dipole moment is given as p = (3.00 i + 4.00 j) multiplied by 1.24e-30 C·m. So that means the dipole moment vector has components in both the i and j directions. The electric field is E = 4000 N/C in the i direction, so it's along the x-axis.

The question has two parts: (a) the potential energy of the dipole and (b) the torque acting on it. I'll tackle them one at a time.

Starting with part (a), the potential energy U of an electric dipole in an electric field. I remember the formula is U = -p · E. Wait, is that right? Or is it the dot product of p and E? Let me think. Oh yeah, the potential energy is given by the negative dot product of the dipole moment and the electric field. So U = - (p · E).

So I need to compute the dot product of p and E. Let's break it down. The dipole moment vector p has components (3.00 * 1.24e-30) i and (4.00 * 1.24e-30) j. Let me calculate those numbers.

3.00 multiplied by 1.24e-30 is 3 * 1.24 = 3.72, so 3.72e-30 C·m in the i direction.

4.00 times 1.24e-30 is 4 * 1.24 = 4.96, so 4.96e-30 C·m in the j direction.

So the p vector is (3.72e-30 i + 4.96e-30 j) C·m.

The electric field E is 4000 N/C in the i direction, so E = 4000 i N/C.

Now, the dot product p · E is (3.72e-30)(4000) + (4.96e-30)(0), since E has no j component. So the j part doesn't contribute anything.

Calculating that: 3.72e-30 * 4000. Let's see, 3.72 * 4000 = 14,880. So 14,880e-30, which is 1.488e-26. So the dot product is 1.488e-26 (C·m·N/C). Wait, but the units for potential energy should be joules. Let me check: C·m·N/C simplifies to N·m, which is joules. So that's correct.

So U = - (p · E) = -1.488e-26 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match that. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate 3.72e-30 * 4000.

Wait, 3.72 * 4000 = 3.72 * 4e3 = 3.72 * 4 * 1e3 = 14.88 * 1e3 = 14,880. So 14,880e-30 is 1.488e-26, which is correct.

Hmm, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: -1.69e-26 J

B: -1.99e-26

C: -1.59e-26

D: -1.39e-26

E: -1.79e-26

Wait, my calculation gave -1.488e-26 J, which is approximately -1.49e-26 J. Looking at the options, option H is -1.49e-26 J. So that should be the correct answer for part (a).

Now, part (b) is the torque on the dipole. The formula for torque τ is τ = p × E. The cross product of p and E.

Since both p and E are in the i direction for E, but p has a j component, wait no: p is in both i and j. Wait, E is only in i.

The torque τ is the cross product of p and E. So in terms of vectors:

p = (3.72e-30 i + 4.96e-30 j) C·m

E = 4000 i N/C

The cross product p × E will be along the k direction because i × i is zero, j × i is k, but wait, cross product of j and i is -k, because the order is important. Wait, the cross product in the order p × E, so p is (i, j, 0) and E is (4000, 0, 0).

So the cross product components are calculated as:

i component: (p_j * E_z - p_z * E_j) → p_j is 4.96e-30, E_z is 0, so 0.

j component: -(p_i * E_z - p_z * E_i) → p_i is 3.72e-30, E_i is 4000, so 3.72e-30 * 0 - 0 *4000 → 0. So j component is - (0) = 0.

k component: p_i * E_j - p_j * E_i → but E_j is zero, so it's (3.72e-30)(0) - (4.96e-30)(4000) → 0 - (4.96e-30 * 4e3) → -4.96 *4 = -19.84e-27 → -1.984e-26.

So the torque τ is (0 i + 0 j -1.984e-26 k) N·m. The magnitude is 1.984e-26 N·m, but the question might be asking for the magnitude or the vector. If it's just the magnitude, it's 1.984e-26 N·m, which is approximately 1.98e-26. Looking at the options, option J is -2.09e-26, which is close but not exactly. Wait, but torque direction is important. Since the cross product is negative k, that's the direction. But the options only give potential energy; the torque part isn't part of the options listed here. Wait, the original question includes part (b), but the options are for (a), I think.

Wait, no, the problem statement says: the question is about potential energy (b) and torque, but the options are just for one part, (a) or (b)? Wait, the initial question says: "What is the potential energy of the electric dipole? (b) What is the torque acting on it?" So perhaps it's two separate questions, but the options provided are for part (a), like letters A to J. Wait, no, looking again, the options are just a list, so perhaps the problem is only part (a), and the second part is part (b), but the options are for part (a). So perhaps the question is only part (a), and the user mistakenly included (b). Hmm, but in the problem statement, it's written as part (a) and (b). But the options are A to J, so maybe each option is for both parts? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the user intended only part (a) to be the question, but mistakenly included (b). But regardless, I think the potential energy is the primary part here.

Wait, but I think I got the potential energy as -1.488e-26 J, which is approximately -1.49e-26 J. Looking at the options, option H is -1.49e-26 J. So I think that's the correct answer for part (a).

The potential energy of an electric dipole in an electric field is given by \( U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} \). The dipole moment \(\vec{p}\) is \((3.72 \times 10^{-30} \, \hat{i} + 4.96 \times 10^{-30} \, \hat{j}) \, \text{C·m}\), and the electric field \(\vec{E}\) is \(4000 \, \hat{i} \, \text{N/C}\). The dot product \(\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}\) is calculated as:

\[
\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} = (3.72 \times 10^{-30})(4000) + (4.96 \times 10^{-30})(0) = 1.488 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, \( U = -1.488 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \), which approximates to \(-1.49 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\). This matches option H.
