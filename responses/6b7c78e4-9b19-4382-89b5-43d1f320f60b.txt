Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about positive externalities and how to correct them. I remember from my economics class that externalities are when the actions of a person or firm affect others without compensation. Positive externalities are when the third party benefits, but the market doesn't account for that, leading to underproduction.

The question is asking which of the options would correct the externality. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think about what I know about correcting externalities.

I remember that when there's a positive externality, the free market tends to produce less than the socially optimal level. Because the producers don't account for the external benefits, they don't have the incentive to produce enough. So to correct this, the government needs to step in to increase production.

How do governments usually do this? I think they can use subsidies. A subsidy is a payment from the government to a producer, which effectively lowers the cost of production. That would encourage the producer to make more goods or services because it's cheaper for them. So with a subsidy, the supply curve shifts to the right, increasing output and bringing the quantity closer to the socially optimal level.

Let me go through the options. Option I is a government subsidy. That makes sense because it directly supports production, increasing output. What about the other options? 

Option A: Government regulation. Regulations can sometimes correct market failures, but in this case, a regulation might impose more rules, but I'm not sure if that's the primary tool for a positive externality. It might not directly increase production.

Option B: Increase in supply. Well, a subsidy can cause an increase in supply, but the question is asking what would correct the externality. The action is the subsidy, not the increase itself. So I think the answer would be the subsidy, not just an increase in supply.

Option C: Government tax. Taxes usually correct negative externalities by penalizing actions that cause harm. For example, a tax on pollution. But for a positive externality, we want to encourage more production, so a tax wouldn't help here.

Option D: Government fine. Similar to a tax; fines are used to punish negative behaviors, so that's probably not the answer here.

Option E: Decrease in demand. Decreasing demand would lower output, which is the opposite of what we want. Positive externalities need more production, not less.

Option F: Higher level of output. Well, the goal is to reach the socially optimal output, which is higher than the market output. So achieving a higher output is good, but the question is asking which action would correct the externality. So the means to get there is the subsidy, which would lead to F, but the option here is the action, not the result.

Option G: Lower level of output. Again, the opposite of what's needed.

Option H: Higher price. Higher prices would typically reduce demand, which might not help in this case. We need more production, not higher prices.

Option J: Lower price. Lower prices might increase demand, but it's not directly addressing the production issue caused by the externality.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be a government subsidy, which is option I. It directly addresses the underproduction by reducing the cost for producers, encouraging them to supply more, thus correcting the positive externality.

The presence of a positive externality leads to underproduction in the free market because the producers do not account for the external benefits their actions provide. To correct this, the government can use a subsidy, which lowers production costs and encourages increased output, aligning market production with socially optimal levels.
