Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about a convex lens. Hmm, convex lenses are converging lenses, right? So when an object is placed at infinity, the image should form at the focal point. But when the object is closer, the image moves further away. The question says there's a difference of 8 mm between the image positions when the object is at infinity and when it's 0.2 meters away. I need to find the focal length of the lens.

Wait, let's break this down. When the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point (f). When the object is closer, say at a distance u, the image distance v will be greater than f because the image moves away from the lens. The difference between these two image positions is 8 mm, which is 0.008 meters. But wait, I should work in consistent units, probably meters, so maybe 0.008 m. Wait, no, the object distance is given in meters, and 8 mm is 0.008 m. So the difference between v (image distance when object is 0.2 m away) and f is 0.008 m. So v - f = 0.008 m.

I remember the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Oh wait, wait. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, but wait, wait, I think I might have it backwards. Or is it 1/f = 1/u + 1/v? No, wait, no, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, right? Wait no, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me think: when the object is at infinity, u is very large, so 1/u approaches zero, so 1/f = 1/v, so v equals f. That makes sense. So the correct formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, but wait, no, actually, the standard formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where u is the object distance and v is the image distance. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check: when the object is at infinity, u approaches infinity, so 1/u approaches zero. So 1/f = 1/v, so v = f. That's correct. So the formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

Wait, no, wait, I think I have it wrong. The correct lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, but wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, but no, I think it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v? Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll have to think carefully.

Wait, no, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Wait, no, that can't be right because when u is infinity, 1/u is zero, so 1/f = 1/v, so v = f. That makes sense. So the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v? Wait, no, no, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me think about the direction. In the lens formula, I think the correct formula is 1/f = (1/u) + (1/v), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Hmm, but I'm getting confused. Let's think of the correct formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Or maybe it's 1/f = (1/u) + (1/v), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of an example. Suppose u is equal to f, then 1/f = 1/f + 1/v → 0 = 1/v → v approaches infinity, which makes sense because when u = f, the image is at infinity. So that suggests that the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. No, wait, that can't be right. Because if I rearrange that, 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. That would make sense. So when u is infinity, 1/u is zero, so 1/v = 1/f, so v = f. That works. So yes, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, because when u is at f, 1/f = 1/f + 1/v → 0 = 1/v → v is infinity. That's correct. So the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Wait, no, because when u is at 2f, then 1/f = 1/(2f) + 1/v → 1/v = 1/f - 1/(2f) = (2 -1)/(2f) = 1/(2f), so v = 2f. That's correct because for u=2f, v=2f. So, yes, the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Wait, but I'm getting confused because sometimes the formula is written as 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, but I think I might have it reversed. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So I'll proceed with that.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me look it up in my mind. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So when the object is at infinity, u is very large, so 1/u is zero, so 1/f = 1/v → v = f. That's correct. So I'll use that formula.

So, given that when the object is at infinity, the image is at v1 = f. When the object is at u = 0.2 m, the image is at v2. The difference between v2 and v1 is 8 mm, which is 0.008 m. So v2 - v1 = 0.008 m. Since v1 = f, then v2 = f + 0.008 m.

Now, applying the lens formula for the case when u = 0.2 m and v = v2 = f + 0.008 m.

So:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

Substituting u = 0.2 m and v = f + 0.008 m:

1/f = 1/(0.2) + 1/(f + 0.008).

Let me write that equation:

1/f = 5 + 1/(f + 0.008).

Wait, because 1/0.2 is 5.

So, 1/f = 5 + 1/(f + 0.008).

Hmm, that's the equation I need to solve for f.

Let me rearrange this equation. Let me denote f as x for simplicity.

So, 1/x = 5 + 1/(x + 0.008).

Let me subtract 5 from both sides:

1/x - 5 = 1/(x + 0.008).

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. Maybe I can find a common denominator or cross-multiply.

Let me write the equation again:

1/x = 5 + 1/(x + 0.008).

Multiply both sides by x(x + 0.008) to eliminate denominators:

(x + 0.008) = 5x(x + 0.008) + x.

Wait, let's see:

Left side: (x + 0.008) * 1/x = 1 + 0.008/x → Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, when I multiply both sides by x(x + 0.008), I get:

Left side: (x + 0.008) * [1/x] = 1 + 0.008/x.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When I multiply both sides by x(x + 0.008), the left side becomes (x + 0.008) * (1/x) * x(x + 0.008) → Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, when I have 1/x = 5 + 1/(x + 0.008), and I multiply both sides by x(x + 0.008), I get:

(x + 0.008) * (1/x) = 5 * x(x + 0.008) + [1/(x + 0.008)] * x(x + 0.008).

Simplify each term:

Left side: (x + 0.008)/x = 1 + 0.008/x.

Right side: 5x(x + 0.008) + x.

So the equation becomes:

1 + 0.008/x = 5x(x + 0.008) + x.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should rearrange the initial equation differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

1/f = 5 + 1/(f + 0.008).

Let me subtract 5 from both sides:

1/f - 5 = 1/(f + 0.008).

Now, let me write 5 as 5f/f to have a common denominator:

(1 - 5f)/(f) = 1/(f + 0.008).

So, (1 - 5f)/(f) = 1/(f + 0.008).

Cross-multiplying:

(1 - 5f)(f + 0.008) = f * 1.

Expanding the left side:

1*(f + 0.008) -5f*(f + 0.008) = f.

So, f + 0.008 -5f² -0.04f = f.

Combine like terms:

f - 0.04f = 0.96f.

So, 0.96f + 0.008 -5f² = f.

Bring all terms to one side:

0.96f + 0.008 -5f² -f = 0.

Simplify:

(0.96f - f) + 0.008 -5f² = 0 → (-0.04f) + 0.008 -5f² = 0.

Rearranged:

-5f² -0.04f + 0.008 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:

5f² + 0.04f - 0.008 = 0.

Now, this is a quadratic equation in the form of af² + bf + c = 0, where a=5, b=0.04, c=-0.008.

Using the quadratic formula:

f = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Let me compute the discriminant first:

D = b² -4ac = (0.04)^2 -4*5*(-0.008) = 0.0016 + 0.16 = 0.1616.

Square root of D: sqrt(0.1616) ≈ 0.402.

So, f = [-0.04 ± 0.402]/(2*5) = [-0.04 ± 0.402]/10.

We have two solutions:

1. [-0.04 + 0.402]/10 = (0.362)/10 = 0.0362 m = 36.2 mm.

2. [-0.04 -0.402]/10 = (-0.442)/10 = -0.0442 m. But focal length can't be negative for a convex lens, so we take the positive solution.

So f ≈ 36.2 mm. Looking at the options, option J is 36.2 mm.
</think>

The problem involves a convex lens where the difference in image positions between when the object is at infinity and when it is 0.2 m away is 8 mm (0.008 m). Using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \), we set \( v_1 = f \) (image position at infinity) and \( v_2 = f + 0.008 \) (image position at 0.2 m). Substituting \( u = 0.2 \, \text{m} \) and \( v = f + 0.008 \) into the formula leads to the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = 5 + \frac{1}{f + 0.008}.
\]

Solving this equation yields \( f \approx 36.2 \, \text{mm} \), which matches option J.

Answer: J
