Okay, so I need to find the prime factorization of 77 and choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let's start by recalling what prime factorization is. It's breaking down a number into the product of its prime numbers. So, I need to find primes that multiply together to give 77.

First, I think about the smallest primes. The primes I know are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Since 77 is an odd number, it's not divisible by 2. Let me check if it's divisible by 3. Adding the digits, 7 + 7 is 14, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a factor.

Next, I'll try 5. Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5, but 77 ends with a 7, so no luck there. Moving on to 7. Let me divide 77 by 7. 7 times 11 is 77 because 7*10 is 70, plus 7 is 77. Oh, right! So 77 equals 7 multiplied by 11.

Now, both 7 and 11 are prime numbers because they have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So the prime factors are 7 and 11. Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches 7 multiplied by 11.

Option E is 7 • 11, which looks exactly like what I got. Let me check the others quickly to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A has both 7 and 11 squared, which would be 49 * 121, way bigger than 77. Option B is 11 squared times 13, which is also way too big. Option C is 7 times 13 squared, again too big. Option D is 7 *11 *13, which is 1001, not 77. Option F is 7 squared times 13, that's 49*13=637, nope. Option G is 7 squared times 11, 49*11=539, still too big. Option H has multiple primes squared, way too big. Option I is 11*13, which is 143, not 77. Option J is 7 cubed times 11, that's 343*11=3773, way too big.

So the only correct option is E: 7 • 11.

The prime factorization of 77 is 7 multiplied by 11, both of which are prime numbers. This corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
