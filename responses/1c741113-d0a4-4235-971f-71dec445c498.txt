Alright, so I need to figure out how many states FDR didn't carry in the 1932 presidential election. Let me start by recalling what I know about FDR and his 1932 campaign. 

Franklin D. Roosevelt was the Democratic candidate that year, and he was running against the incumbent, Herbert Hoover, who was a Republican. The 1932 election was a significant one because it was during the height of the Great Depression, which had started in 1929. People were really struggling, and Hoover was widely blamed for not doing enough to help. So, I think FDR had a lot of support because of his New Deal policies, which aimed to bring the economy back.

Now, the question is asking how many states he didn't carry. To find that, I need to know how many states he did carry and then subtract that from the total number of states. The United States had 48 states at that time because Alaska and Hawaii weren't yet states. So, total states = 48.

I remember that FDR won the 1932 election in a landslide. I think he won 47 states, but wait, was it 46? Let me think. I'm a bit confused. I know he won a lot, but maybe not all. So if he won, say, 46 states, then he didn't carry 2. But that number doesn't match the options given, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the 1932 and 1936 elections. In 1936, FDR won 46 states, I believe. For 1932, perhaps he didn't win all 48. Let me try to remember the specifics. I think he won 47 states in 1932. If that's the case, then the number of states he didn't carry would be 48 - 47 = 1. But looking at the options, none of them is 1. The options are from A to J, with numbers like three, four, five, up to eleven. So maybe I'm off.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering the exact number. Let me think again. The 1932 election was a big shift from the 1928 election, where Hoover won 30 states. In 1932, the Democrats, with FDR, took many of those states. I think FDR won 47 states, but maybe it's 46. Alternatively, maybe he won 46, which would mean he didn't carry 2, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the 1932 and 1936 results. Let me try to recall the states he didn't win. I think he lost a few states in the South, perhaps the ones that were more rural and aligned with the Democratic Party at the time. Wait, no, actually, the South was traditionally Democratic, but maybe some states went Republican. Or perhaps it's the opposite. Alternatively, maybe he lost some Midwestern states.

Wait, I think in 1932, FDR won 47 states, but perhaps he didn't carry a couple. Let me check my reasoning. If he won 47, then he lost 1 state, but since the options don't have 1, maybe it's 2. Hmm, but again, that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the number of states he won. Maybe he didn't win as many as I thought. Let me think about the popular vote. FDR won 57.4% of the popular vote, which is pretty significant, but not a majority in all states. In that case, perhaps he carried 46 states, leaving 2 he didn't carry. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The question is asking how many states he didn't carry, so the answer would be the total states minus the ones he won. The options are A:4, B:7, C:10, D:9, E:5, F:3, G:6, H:12, I:8, J:11.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact number of states FDR won in 1932. But since I can't look it up, I'll try to recall. I think he won 47 states, so 48 total, so 47-48=1. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe he won 46, so 2 states. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking of the 1936 election, where he won 46 states, leaving 2. But in 1932, perhaps he won more. Alternatively, maybe he won 46 states, so the answer would be 2, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake about the total number of states. Maybe in 1932, there were 48 states, including the ones that joined before then. So 48 total. If FDR won 46, then he lost 2. But again, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps he won 37 states, which would mean he lost 11, which is option J. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the 1932 election. FDR vs. Hoover. The Democrats were the ones pushing for change, and Hoover was seen as ineffective. So FDR won a lot. I think he won 47 states, which would mean he lost 1. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe he won 46, so 2, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 6, which is option G. Because I think in 1932, FDR won 46 states, but that would mean he lost 2. Hmm. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the number of states that went Republican in 1932. Hoover was the Republican candidate. I think in 1932, Hoover won only 6 states. So if he won 6, then FDR won 48-6=42. But that doesn't make sense because FDR won a lot more than that. Wait, no, that can't be right because 6 states would mean FDR won 42, which is possible, but I thought he won more.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 6, so option G. Because I think Hoover won 6 states in 1932, which would mean FDR carried 42. But that doesn't seem right because I thought FDR won a majority, but perhaps only 42. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the number of states with the popular vote.

Alternatively, maybe FDR won 47 states, so he lost 1. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 6, meaning he carried 42. But I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about specific states. I think FDR won the Northeast, Midwest, and West, but lost some Southern states. Wait, no, the South was traditionally Democratic, so perhaps he lost a few in the South. Alternatively, maybe he lost some rural states that were more Republican.

Wait, I think in 1932, FDR won 47 states, losing only 6. So the answer would be 6, which is option G. That makes sense because 47 is a high number, and 6 states he didn't carry. Alternatively, maybe it's 5 states, but I think it's 6.

Wait, let me think again. If the total states are 48, and he won 47, then he lost 1. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps he won 46, so 2, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the number of states he won. Maybe he won 40, so he lost 8, which is option I. But that seems too low for FDR in 1932.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: the 1932 election was a shift towards the Democrats, so FDR won a lot. I think he won 47 states, which would mean he lost 1. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 6, meaning he lost 6, so he carried 42. But that doesn't align with what I know.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is 6, so option G. I think I've heard that FDR won 47 states, but perhaps the correct number is 46, so he lost 2. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the total number of states in 1932 was 48, and FDR won 47, so he didn't carry 1. But since that's not an option, maybe the question is referring to the number of states he didn't carry, which could be 6, meaning he carried 42. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 6, so option G. I think that's the most plausible option based on what I've considered.

The question asks how many states FDR did not carry in the 1932 presidential election. FDR, running as the Democratic candidate, won a significant number of states that year, primarily due to the public's dissatisfaction with Hoover's handling of the Great Depression. The United States had 48 states at the time. While FDR is widely known to have won a large majority, the exact number of states he carried is a point of consideration. If FDR won 47 states, he would have lost 1, but since this number isn't among the options, it suggests a different interpretation. Given the options provided, the most plausible answer is that FDR did not carry 6 states, making option G the correct choice.

Answer: G
