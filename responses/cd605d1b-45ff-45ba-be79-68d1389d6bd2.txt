Okay, so I need to figure out what consumers' surplus means. I remember from my economics class that it has something to do with the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. Let me think through each option.

Option A says it's a tax imposed by the government. No, that doesn't sound right. Taxes are a different concept; consumers' surplus isn't about taxes.

Option B mentions extra cost due to high demand. I'm not sure. High demand might affect prices, but I don't think that's the definition of consumers' surplus. It's more about what they save, not what they spend more on.

Option C talks about free goods from promotions. That might be a marketing term, but not the economic definition. Consumers' surplus isn't about free stuff, I think.

Option D says it's savings from choosing cheaper alternatives. That's closer. Like when you buy a cheaper product than you were willing to pay, you save money. But is that exactly what surplus is?

Option E describes the surplus as the value from prior units with higher utility than the last bought. Hmm, that rings a bell. I remember something about marginal utility. Consumers' surplus is the total utility from all units minus the total amount paid. So each prior unit gives more utility, and the last unit is what they actually pay for. So the surplus is the sum of the extra utilities from each unit beyond what they paid.

Option F is about additional utility from luxury items. That seems more like a specific case rather than the general concept of consumers' surplus.

Option G is discounts during sales. That's a promotion tactic, not the economic term.

Option H is additional profit for sellers. No, that's producers' profit, not related to consumers.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. It explains consumers' surplus as the extra value from all previous units that provided higher utility than the last unit purchased. That matches what I remember about the concept being the difference between total willingness to pay and the actual price paid.

The correct answer is E. Consumers' surplus refers to the extra value or utility that consumers receive from purchasing prior units of a good or service at a lower price than what they were willing to pay. It is the difference between the total utility consumers derive from all units purchased and the total amount they actually paid for those units. 

Answer: E
