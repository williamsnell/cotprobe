Okay, so I've got this problem here about Ike Waterman and Sean Cole investing in a fast-food store. They each get 6% of their investment, and the remaining profit is split equally. The total profit last year was $10,400. I need to figure out each partner's share and pick the correct option from A to J.

Let me break it down. First, their investments: Waterman put in $20,000, and Cole put in $10,000. So the total investment is $20k + $10k = $30,000. 

Each partner gets 6% of their investment. So, for Waterman, 6% of $20k is 0.06 * 20,000. Let me calculate that: 0.06 *20,000 is 1,200. So Waterman gets $1,200.

For Cole, 6% of $10,000 is 0.06*10,000 = $600. So Cole gets $600.

Now, the total amounts each partner gets from their investments is $1,200 + $600 = $1,800. 

The remaining profit is the total profit minus this amount. The total profit is $10,400. So, 10,400 - 1,800 = $8,600.

This remaining $8,600 is to be split equally between them. So each gets half of $8,600, which is $4,300.

Now, adding each partner's share from investment plus their share from the profit.

Waterman: $1,200 (from investment) + $4,300 (from profit) = $5,500.

Cole: $600 (from investment) + $4,300 (from profit) = $4,900.

Wait, let me double-check that. So Waterman's total is 6% of 20k plus 4,300. 6% is $1,200, plus $4,300 is $5,500. Cole has 6% of 10k which is $600, plus $4,300, making $4,900. Total is $5,500 + $4,900 = $10,400, which matches the given profit. That looks right.

Looking at the options, option E says Waterman's share was $5,500 and Cole's was $4,900. So that's the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Waterman's share was $5,500 and Cole's share was $4,900.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Investment Breakdown:**
   - Waterman: 6% of $20,000 = $1,200.
   - Cole: 6% of $10,000 = $600.
   - Total from investments: $1,200 + $600 = $1,800.

2. **Remaining Profit:**
   - Total profit: $10,400.
   - Subtract investments: $10,400 - $1,800 = $8,600.
   - Split equally: $8,600 / 2 = $4,300 each.

3. **Total Shares:**
   - Waterman: $1,200 + $4,300 = $5,500.
   - Cole: $600 + $4,300 = $4,900.

Thus, the correct option is **E**.
