Question:

A student is recording a song on her computer. When the recording is finished, she saves a copy on her computer. The student notices that the saved copy is of lower sound quality than the original recording. Which of the following could be a possible explanation for the difference in sound quality?

Options:

A: The song was saved using a higher quality compression technique.
B: The song was saved using more bits per second than the original song.
C: The song was saved on a part of the computer's hard drive that has less storage capacity.
D: The song was saved using fewer bits per second than the original song.
E: The student's computer has a virus that reduces the quality of saved files.
F: The song was saved using a lossless compression technique.
G: The student's computer speakers are not functioning correctly.
H: The original recording was disrupted by background noise.
I: Some information is lost every time a file is saved from one location on a computer to another location.

Okay, so I have this question about why a student's saved song has lower sound quality than the original. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think step by step.

First, the scenario: she records a song on her computer, saves it, and then notices lower quality. So, what could cause that? Well, I remember that sound quality relates to the bitrate and the type of compression used when saving files.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Higher quality compression. Wait, higher quality usually means better sound but maybe larger file size. If she used a higher quality compression, the quality should be better, not worse. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: More bits per second than original. More bits mean higher quality because more data is captured. So if the saved song has more bits, the quality would be better, not worse. So B isn't the cause.

Option C: Saved on a part with less storage. Wait, storage capacity affects how much data can be stored, but not the quality. Like, if the area has less capacity, maybe the file gets cut off, but that would probably cause corruption, not lower quality. So I don't think C is correct.

Option D: Fewer bits per second than original. Oh, right! Bitrate is crucial. If the original was recorded at a higher bitrate, and she saved it with fewer bits per second, the quality would drop because less audio data is preserved. So D seems like a possible answer.

Option E: Computer virus affecting files. I guess a virus could corrupt files, but the question says the saved copy is lower quality. Unless the virus specifically reduces quality, but that's less likely. I'm not sure about E, but it's a possibility.

Option F: Lossless compression. Lossless means no data is lost, so the quality remains the same as the original. So if she used lossless, the quality wouldn't drop. So F isn't the cause.

Option G: Computer speakers not working. Wait, but she's saving the file and noticing lower quality. If the speakers are bad, she might hear lower quality when playing, but the file itself would still be the same. So G isn't the reason the saved file is worse.

Option H: Original was disrupted by background noise. That would mean the original recording was already lower quality. The question says the saved copy is lower than the original, implying the original was good. So H doesn't seem right.

Option I: Information lost when saving from one location to another. Wait, moving a file doesn't usually lose information unless it's compressed or something. Like, if she copies a file without changing it, it should be the same. But if she's saving it with compression or lower bitrate, then info is lost. But I'm not sure if moving a file inherently causes information loss. Maybe if she's converting the file format, but the question doesn't specify that. So I'm not sure about I.

So, going back, the main issue is about bitrate. If the saved file has fewer bits per second (D), that would reduce quality. Alternatively, the compression method in A or F could affect it, but A is higher quality, which is better, and F is lossless, same quality.

E and I are possibilities, but D seems more straightforward. So the likely answer is D: the song was saved using fewer bits per second than the original song.

The student's saved song has lower sound quality because it was saved with fewer bits per second than the original recording, which reduces the audio data and thus the quality.

Answer: D
