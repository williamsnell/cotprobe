Okay, so I have this question about the size of an embryo 28 days after conception. Hmm, I remember from biology class that the early stages of development are really quick. Let me think.

Conception happens, and then the embryo starts developing. I think the first month after conception is called the germinal stage, right? Then it moves to the embryonic stage. At around 28 days, I believe the embryo has implanted in the uterus. But how big is it by then?

Wait, I think the embryo doesn't grow that quickly in the first few weeks. Like, in the first week, it's just a zygote, then it starts dividing. By the time it's 28 days, it's probably not too big yet. I remember hearing something about a few millimeters, but the question is in centimeters.

Let me think about the options. The choices are A:3, B:2.5, C:0.5, D:1, E:0.8, F:6, G:4.5, H:2, I:5, J:4. So these are all in centimeters.

I recall that around 4 weeks, which is 28 days, the embryo is about the size of a sesame seed. I think sesame seeds are like 0.5 cm or something. So maybe the answer is C:0.5 cm. Or wait, maybe it's a bit larger.

Wait, another thought: I think at 3 weeks, it's about 0.25 cm, and by 4 weeks, it's around 0.5 cm. That makes sense because each week adds a bit. So 0.5 cm would be about 5 millimeters, which seems right for 28 days.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes measurements can vary. Some sources say that by 4 weeks, the embryo is about 1 cm. Oh, but that might be from the top of the head to the bottom, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's around 0.8 cm, which is option E.

Alternatively, I think the length from crown to rump at 4 weeks is about 0.5 cm. So that would make option C the correct one. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to visualize it. A sesame seed is very small, so 0.5 cm sounds about right.

Wait, another angle: sometimes they measure the entire length, including the tail. If the embryo is about 1 cm at that stage, then it might be option D:1. But I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, maybe I should think about when the heart starts beating. That's around day 21 or so, so by 28 days, it's already a bit more developed. But size-wise, I think 0.5 cm is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the embryo is around 1 cm. I'm a bit torn between C and D. But I think the accurate measurement is around 0.5 cm, so I'll go with option C.
