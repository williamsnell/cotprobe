Question:

Mr. Riley loaned his friend, Mr. Gillis, $400 to purchase a second-hand car. One year later Mr. Gillis returned $420 to Mr. Riley. During that period, the consumer price index rose by 5%. a) What is the nominal rate of interest in this example? b) What is the real rate of interest?

Options:

A: Nominal rate is 6%, Real rate is -1%
B: Nominal rate is 3%, Real rate is 2%
C: Nominal rate is 5%, Real rate is 0%
D: Nominal rate is 6%, Real rate is 1%
E: Nominal rate is 10%, Real rate is 5%
F: Nominal rate is 2%, Real rate is -3%
G: Nominal rate is 5%, Real rate is -1%
H: Nominal rate is 4%, Real rate is 1%
I: Nominal rate is 4.5%, Real rate is -0.5%
J: Nominal rate is 7%, Real rate is 2%

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Riley loaning money to his friend Mr. Gillis. Let's try to figure out the nominal and real rates of interest. Hmm, I remember that the nominal rate is the straightforward interest rate without considering inflation, while the real rate adjusts for inflation. 

Alright, the loan was $400, and after a year, Mr. Gillis returned $420. So the interest paid is $420 minus $400, which is $20. The nominal interest rate is calculated by (Interest / Principal) * 100. So that's (20/400)*100 = 5%. Wait, that's 5%? Or did I make a mistake? Because $420 over $400 is a 5% increase, so yes, the nominal rate is 5%.

Now, the real rate of interest. I think the formula is (Nominal Rate - Inflation Rate) divided by (1 + Inflation Rate), but wait, no, that's the Fisher equation. The Fisher equation says that Real Rate â‰ˆ Nominal Rate - Inflation Rate, approximately. But when the numbers are small, that approximation holds. Here, the inflation rate is 5%, so the real rate would be 5% (nominal) minus 5% (inflation) = 0%. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The exact Fisher equation is (1 + Real Rate) = (1 + Nominal Rate) / (1 + Inflation Rate). So plugging in the numbers: (1 + Real) = 1.05 / 1.05 = 1. So Real Rate is 0%. That makes sense because the money's purchasing power didn't change; the same as the inflation rate. 

Looking at the options, which one has Nominal 5% and Real 0%? Let's check the options. Option C says Nominal 5%, Real 0%. That seems correct. So the answer should be option C.

The nominal rate is calculated as the interest paid divided by the principal, which is 5%. The real rate is found using the Fisher equation, resulting in 0%. 

Answer: C
