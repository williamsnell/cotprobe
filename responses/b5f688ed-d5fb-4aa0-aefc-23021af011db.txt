Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how many times a day the Fatihah is recited. I know the Fatihah is the opening chapter of the Quran, Surah Al-Fatihah, and it's a very important part of Islamic worship. I remember that in the five daily prayers, which are Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha, the Fatihah is recited at the beginning of each prayer.

Wait, but each prayer has specific times, right? So that's five times a day. But also, I think some people might recite the Fatihah more than once in a day for other reasons, like maybe during personal supplications or other acts of worship. But the question is specifically asking how many times a day it's recited in general.

Wait, no, actually, the question is probably referring to the number of times it's recited in the daily prayers. So each prayer requires reciting the Fatihah once. That's five times a day. But wait, wait, I think I'm forgetting something. There's also the case of the Sunnah prayers, which are the additional prayers performed by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and recommended for others. For example, in the morning, after Fajr, there are two Sunnah prayers, and in the evening, after Maghrib, there are two Sunnah prayers as well. However, the Fatihah is recited only once per prayer session, whether it's Fard (obligatory) or Sunnah.

Wait, but the question is about how many times a day. So if someone prays all the Fard and Sunnah prayers, how many times would they recite the Fatihah? Let's break it down:

- Fajr: 2 raka'ah (Fard) + 2 raka'ah Sunnah. So Fatihah is recited 2 (Fard) + 2 (Sunnah) = 4 times?
Wait, no, each prayer has its own Fatihah. So for each raka'ah, you recite the Fatihah once. So for Fajr Fard, 2 raka'ah, so 2 times. Then Sunnah after Fajr, another 2 raka'ah, so another 2 times. That's 4 times just for Fajr.

Wait, but that seems too high. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the Fatihah is recited once per prayer session, regardless of the number of raka'ah. So for each prayer, whether it's Fard or Sunnah, you recite the Fatihah once. So for Fajr Fard, 1 time; Fajr Sunnah, 1 time. Similarly for Dhuhr, Asr, etc.

Wait, but Dhuhr is just 2 raka'ah Fard, no Sunnah. Asr is 4 raka'ah Fard, I think, but in the standard prayers, it's 4 raka'ah. But the Sunnah prayers are separate. So perhaps:

- Fajr: Fard (2 raka'ah) + Sunnah (2 raka'ah) → 2+2 = 4 Fatihah recitations? Or is it 1 per prayer session?

Wait, no, each raka'ah starts with the Fatihah. So for each raka'ah, you recite the Fatihah once. So for Fajr Fard, 2 raka'ah → 2 times. Fajr Sunnah, another 2 → 2 times. That's 4 so far. Then Dhuhr Fard is 2 raka'ah → 2 times. Asr Fard is 4 → 4 times. Maghrib Fard is 3 → 3 times. Isha Fard is 4 → 4 times. Sunnah prayers after Maghrib are 2 → 2 times. Also, some people might do other Sunnah prayers, like after Dhuhr or Asr, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum number of times, perhaps. Because the options are "at least" a number, like B: At least 13, C: At least 17, etc.

Wait, the minimum would be the Fard prayers only. So 5 prayers, each with one Fatihah per prayer, but wait no, each prayer has multiple raka'ah, each requiring the Fatihah. So Fajr Fard is 2 raka'ah → 2 times. Dhuhr is 2 → 2. Asr is 4 → 4. Maghrib is 3 → 3. Isha is 4 → 4. So total Fard only: 2+2+4+3+4=15 times. So at least 15 times. But the options don't have 15. The closest is option C: At least 17, but that's higher than 15. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount:

- Fajr Fard: 2 raka'ah → 2 Fatihah.
- Dhuhr Fard: 2 → 2.
- Asr Fard: 4 →4.
- Maghrib Fard: 3 →3.
- Isha Fard:4 →4.

Total: 2+2+4+3+4 = 15.

But wait, some sources say that each prayer requires the Fatihah once per raka'ah. So yes, 15 times for the Fard prayers alone. But the options don't have 15. So perhaps the question is considering the minimum, which is the Fard only, but the options don't have 15. So maybe the answer is "at least 17", but that's higher than 15. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about how many times the Fatihah is recited in the five daily prayers, including the Sunnah. So let's add the Sunnah prayers.

After Fajr: 2 raka'ah Sunnah → 2.
After Dhuhr: 2 Sunnah →2.
After Asr: 2 Sunnah →2.
After Maghrib: 2 Sunnah →2.
After Isha: 2 Sunnah →2.

So that's 2*5=10 more.

So total Fatihah recitations would be 15 (Fard) +10 (Sunnah) =25.

But the options don't have 25 either. The options are up to 24. So perhaps the answer is "at least 24", but that's not matching exactly.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question might be referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the five daily prayers, considering that each prayer has a certain number of raka'ah. So:

Fajr: 2 raka'ah →2.
Dhuhr: 2 →2.
Asr:4 →4.
Maghrib:3 →3.
Isha:4 →4.

Total: 2+2+4+3+4=15.

So 15 times a day. But the options don't have 15. The closest is option C: At least 17. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that each prayer session includes the Fatihah once, regardless of the number of raka'ah. So each of the five prayers would be once, totaling 5 times. But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It might be asking how many times the entire Fatihah is recited in a day, not per raka'ah. But no, in each raka'ah, you recite the Fatihah once. So for each raka'ah, it's once.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 17 because in some prayers, the number of raka'ah is different. Let me recount:

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of raka'ah for each prayer.

- Fajr: 2 raka'ah Fard.
- Dhuhr: 2 Fard.
- Asr: 4 Fard.
- Maghrib: 3 Fard.
- Isha: 4 Fard.

So 2+2+4+3+4=15.

But the options don't have 15. So perhaps the answer is "At least 17" because some people perform more Sunnah prayers, like adding more raka'ah, which would increase the count beyond 15. So the minimum is 15, but the options don't have that. The closest higher option is C: At least 17.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the raka'ah. Let me check:

Wait, Asr prayer: is it 4 raka'ah? Or is it 3? I think it's 4 raka'ah Fard. So that's correct.

So 15 is the minimum for Fard only. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is C: At least 17, because in addition to Fard, many people perform Sunnah prayers, which add more Fatihah recitations. So the minimum is 15, but the options don't have that, so the next possible is C: At least 17.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: Exactly 24, but that doesn't make sense because 24 would be if someone is reciting it every hour, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: At least 24, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C: At least 17, as the minimum is 15, so the next option is 17.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the question is about the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day, which would be 17, considering some additional prayers or other recitations.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: At least 17, as it's the closest option to the minimum 15, but perhaps the correct answer is C.

The Fatihah, Surah Al-Fatihah, is recited multiple times a day as part of Islamic worship. Each prayer session requires reciting the Fatihah at the beginning of each raka'ah. The five daily prayers consist of Fard (obligatory) and optional Sunnah (recommended) prayers. 

For the Fard prayers alone:
- Fajr: 2 raka'ah → 2 recitations.
- Dhuhr: 2 raka'ah → 2 recitations.
- Asr: 4 raka'ah → 4 recitations.
- Maghrib: 3 raka'ah → 3 recitations.
- Isha: 4 raka'ah → 4 recitations.

This totals to **15 recitations** for the Fard prayers. Adding Sunnah prayers increases this number further. The options provided do not include 15, so the closest higher option is **C: At least 17**, as it accounts for the minimum recitations plus additional optional prayers.

Answer: C
