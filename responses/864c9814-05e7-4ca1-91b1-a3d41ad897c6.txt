This question refers to the following information.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Mikhail Gorbachev's view on Perestroika based on the provided passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage says, "Perestroika [Restructuring] is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in our socialist society. This society is ripe for change. It has long been yearning for it. Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises."

From this, I can gather that Gorbachev is talking about the need for restructuring. He calls it an "urgent necessity" and says that without it, the Soviet Union would face serious crises. So the key points are urgency, necessity, and the consequences of delay.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Says restructuring wasn't urgent. But the passage says it's urgent, so A is wrong.

B: Talks about external factors forcing restructuring. The passage mentions internal factors (profound processes, internal situation), so B is incorrect.

C: Suggests restructuring would worsen the situation. The passage warns that delay would make things worse, so restructuring is to prevent that, making C incorrect.

D: States no significant impact. But the passage warns of crises, implying significant impact, so D is wrong.

E: Says restructuring was needed to avoid collapse. The passage talks about avoiding crises, not necessarily collapse, so E might be close but not exact.

F: Talks about appeasing the masses. The passage doesn't mention that, so F is out.

G: Suggests restructuring leads to political collapse. The passage warns of crises but not collapse, so G is incorrect.

H: States restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. This aligns with the passage, which mentions that delaying restructuring would lead to crises. So H seems correct.

I: Calls restructuring inevitable. The passage says it's an urgent necessity, which implies inevitability, so I is also a possible contender.

J: Talks about strengthening the economy. The passage doesn't specifically mention the economy in a positive light, just that crises would occur without restructuring.

Now, between H and I. The passage says restructuring is an urgent necessity to avoid crises (H) and that it's inevitable (I). Both are correct in a way, but looking at the options, H is more directly supported because the passage explicitly mentions avoiding crises. I is a broader statement, but the question asks what Gorbachev argued, and the passage specifically warns about the consequences of delay in terms of crises.

So I think H is the best answer.

The passage emphasizes that Perestroika is an urgent necessity to avoid serious crises, making H the correct choice.

Answer: H
