Okay, so I've got this question about a child's temperament based on Thomas and Chess's theory. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question describes a 3-year-old's first day at preschool. The child is holding onto her mother's hand tightly and watching the other kids play. After some coaxing from the teacher, she starts helping another child with a puzzle. I need to figure out which temperament style this fits according to Thomas and Chess.

First, I should remember what Thomas and Chess's theory is about. They identified three main temperament types: easy, difficult, and slow-to-warm-up (sometimes called slow to adapt). Each of these has different characteristics.

So, let's break down the scenario. The child is new to the environment, which is preschool. She's holding her mother's hand tightly, which suggests she's feeling some anxiety or hesitation. She's observing the other children rather than jumping in immediately. The teacher has to coax her, and eventually, she starts helping another child. 

Looking at the options, I see "I: Slow to warm up" as one of the choices. I think that's the right category here. Thomas and Chess described slow-to-warm-up children as those who take time to adjust to new situations. They're not immediately comfortable and often need a bit of encouragement before they engage. They might seem shy or inhibited at first but can adapt once they get used to the environment.

The other options: "Easy" temperament would mean the child is generally flexible and adaptable, which doesn't fit because the child is showing hesitation. "Difficult" temperament is more about being irritable and having a hard time adjusting, which doesn't quite match here either. "Fast to adapt" isn't one of their categories, but if it were, it might refer to easy temperament. "Secure" and "Insecure" relate more to attachment styles, not temperament. "Fearful" might be part of temperament, but the child isn't showing persistent fear, just initial hesitation. "Flexible" and "Passive" aren't standard terms in this theory. "Active" refers more to a child's energy level, which isn't indicated here.

So, the child's behavior—hesitant at first, needing coaxing, then engaging after some time—is classic of the slow-to-warm-up temperament. She's not difficult because she eventually participates, just takes more time to adjust.

The child's behavior of hesitating initially, needing coaxing, and then engaging after some time fits the "Slow to warm up" temperament.
