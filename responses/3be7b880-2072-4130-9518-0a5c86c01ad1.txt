Question:

Research has shown that people who read a job description written only with male pronouns (e.g., he, his) are more likely to think of an employee as male than people who read a description that uses gender-neutral language (e.g., he or she). This finding is most closely linked to

Options:

A: the linguistic relativity hypothesis.
B: gender schema theory.
C: the social role hypothesis.
D: modeling.

Okay, so I've got this question about psychology, specifically about gender stereotypes and language. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that reading a job description with male pronouns (like he, his) makes people more likely to think the employee is male, compared to a gender-neutral version. I need to figure out which theory this finding aligns with.

First, I remember that there are several theories related to how we perceive gender and stereotypes. Let's go through each option.

Option A: The linguistic relativity hypothesis. I think this is about how language affects our perception and thought. Whorf's hypothesis, right? It suggests that language influences how we categorize things. So if a job description uses male pronouns, it might make people think more about male characteristics. That seems relevant because the language is shaping their perception of the gender of the employee.

Option B: Gender schema theory. Schema theory in general is about how we organize knowledge in our memory to understand and predict things. Gender schema theory specifically talks about how we process information based on gender stereotypes. So if someone reads male pronouns, it might activate their gender schema, making them associate the job with a male. That also sounds applicable.

Option C: The social role hypothesis. This theory, I believe, focuses on how gender roles are learned through society, based on the roles people observe. For example, seeing men in certain roles more often. But the question is about the language used in the job description, not about role models or societal roles directly. So maybe not the best fit here.

Option D: Modeling. This is about learning through observation, like Bandura's social learning theory. If someone models behavior based on what they see, but the question isn't about imitation or modeling behavior; it's about the language influencing perception. So probably not D.

Now, between A and B. Both seem related. The question is about how language affects the perception of gender in job descriptions. The linguistic relativity hypothesis would say that the language (male pronouns) influences how people think about the gender. Gender schema theory is more about existing schemas affecting how new info is processed. So if the job description uses male pronouns, it might activate the gender schema, leading people to think it's male.

Wait, but the question is about the finding being linked to which theory. So the phenomenon described is that the language used affects the perception of gender. That's more about language's influence on thought, which is linguistic relativity. Alternatively, it's about how schemas are activated by the language, which is schema theory.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The linguistic relativity hypothesis would predict that the language used affects categorization. So using male pronouns primes the reader to think male.

Gender schema theory would explain that people use their existing schemas to interpret information. So seeing male pronouns fits into their existing gender schema, making them more likely to perceive it as male.

Which theory is more directly linked to this specific finding? The question is about the effect of language on gender perception in job descriptions. I think the key here is that the language is shaping the perception, which points more towards linguistic relativity.

But wait, another angle: the social role hypothesis is about roles being assigned based on gender, but it's more about roles in society rather than language. Modeling is about imitation, which doesn't fit here.

So perhaps the correct answer is A: the linguistic relativity hypothesis.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I've read that gender schema theory explains how people process information in a gendered way, which could be triggered by language. So when they read male pronouns, it activates their gender schema, leading them to perceive the employee as male.

In that case, the finding aligns with gender schema theory because it's about how schemas influence perception.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me check what each theory really covers.

Linguistic relativity (A) says that language affects thought. So the way the job is described (male vs neutral) affects how people think about the gender.

Gender schema theory (B) is about how people organize info into gender categories, which affects their processing of info. So when they read male pronouns, it fits into their existing gender schema, making them more likely to think it's male.

The question is about the link between the language used and the perception. So which theory explains that the way info is presented (male pronouns) influences the gender perception. That seems more about how language affects thought, which is linguistic relativity.

Alternatively, it's about how schemas are activated by the language, which is schema theory. But schema theory isn't one of the options here; the options are A to D, with B being gender schema theory.

Wait, the options are:

A: linguistic relativity

B: gender schema theory

C: social role

D: modeling

So the phenomenon is that the language primes the gender perception. So linguistic relativity would predict that. Alternatively, the schema theory would explain the processing after the language is read.

I think the correct answer is A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it's B because the schemas are being used to process the information.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: gender schema theory. Because the job description primes the schema, leading to more male associations.

Wait, let me think of an example. If someone reads a job description with male pronouns, it activates their gender schema, making them more likely to associate the role with a male. So the theory that explains this is gender schema theory.

So the answer would be B.

Wait, but I'm still a bit confused. I think I'll go with B because it's about how schemas influence processing, and the language activates those schemas.

The question examines how the language used in job descriptions influences perceptions of gender. The key is determining which psychological theory best explains this phenomenon.

- **Option A (Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis):** This theory suggests that language shapes thought and perception. Using male pronouns in a job description could influence readers to perceive the role as male, aligning with this hypothesis.

- **Option B (Gender Schema Theory):** This theory posits that people organize knowledge into gendered categories, which influence how they process information. Reading male pronouns might activate existing gender schemas, leading to a male association.

- **Option C (Social Role Hypothesis):** Focuses on how gender roles are learned through societal observation, which seems less relevant here since the question is about language, not societal roles.

- **Option D (Modeling):** Involves learning through imitation, which does not directly relate to the influence of language on gender perception.

The phenomenon described involves how language (male pronouns) affects gender perception. While linguistic relativity explains the influence of language on thought, gender schema theory highlights how schemas shape processing of information. The question emphasizes the link between language and gender perception, which aligns more closely with **gender schema theory**, as the language activates existing schemas to influence perception.

**Answer:** B
