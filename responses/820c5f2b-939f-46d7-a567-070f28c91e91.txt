Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem about an RLC circuit, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking for the homogeneous solution to the differential equation for the voltage v_C(t) across a capacitor in a series RLC circuit. The given values are: capacitance C = 4/3 F, resistance R = 1 Ω, inductance L = 1/4 H, initial current i_L(0) = 4 A, and initial voltage v_C(0) = 0 V.

First, I remember that in an RLC circuit, the differential equation governing the current or voltage can be derived using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law. Since it's a series RLC circuit, the current through all components is the same. The general form of the differential equation for the current i(t) is:

L * di/dt + R * i + (1/C) ∫i dt = 0

Wait, but sometimes it's easier to use the capacitor voltage v_C(t) as the variable. The relationship between current and voltage for the capacitor is i = C dv_C/dt. Also, the inductor current i_L is equal to the capacitor current i. Wait, no, in a series RLC, the same current flows through all components, so i_L = i_C, which is the same as i(t).

So the capacitor voltage v_C(t) is related to the current by i(t) = C dv_C/dt. Also, the inductor voltage is v_L(t) = L di/dt, and the resistor voltage is v_R(t) = R i(t).

Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) around the loop, the sum of the voltages should be zero. So:

v_L + v_R + v_C = 0

Substituting each term:

L di/dt + R i + (1/C) ∫ i dt = 0

Wait, but another approach is to express everything in terms of v_C(t). Since i(t) = C dv_C/dt, and the inductor voltage is L di/dt = L C d²v_C/dt². So substituting into KVL, the equation becomes:

L C (d²v_C/dt²) + R C (dv_C/dt) + v_C = 0

That's a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. Let me confirm that.

Yes, because:

- The inductor's voltage is L di/dt, which is L C d²v_C/dt² because i = C dv_C/dt, so di/dt = C d²v_C/dt². Multiply by L to get L C d²v_C/dt².

- The resistor's voltage is R i = R C dv_C/dt.

- The capacitor's voltage is v_C.

So putting it all together:

L C (d²v_C/dt²) + R C (dv_C/dt) + v_C = 0

Now, substituting the given values:

L = 1/4 H, C = 4/3 F, R = 1 Ω.

Calculating each coefficient:

- L*C = (1/4) * (4/3) = (1/4)*(4/3) = 1/3

- R*C = 1 * (4/3) = 4/3

So the differential equation becomes:

(1/3) (d²v_C/dt²) + (4/3) (dv_C/dt) + v_C = 0

To make it simpler, multiply every term by 3 to eliminate denominators:

d²v_C/dt² + 4 dv_C/dt + 3 v_C = 0

So the characteristic equation is:

r² + 4 r + 3 = 0

Solving for r using the quadratic formula:

r = [-4 ± sqrt(16 - 12)] / 2 = [-4 ± sqrt(4)] / 2 = [-4 ± 2]/2

So the roots are:

r1 = (-4 + 2)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1

r2 = (-4 - 2)/2 = (-6)/2 = -3

So the general solution for v_C(t) is:

v_C(t) = A e^(-t) + B e^(-3t)

But wait, the question is about the homogeneous solution. Wait no, the homogeneous solution is exactly this expression, as it's the solution to the homogeneous equation. So the homogeneous solution is v_C(t) = A e^{-t} + B e^{-3t}.

Now, I need to find the particular solution, but wait no, wait. Wait, the question is asking for the homogeneous solution, so that's just the general solution without any initial conditions applied. But wait, in some contexts, the homogeneous solution refers to the natural response, which is the solution to the homogeneous equation. So perhaps the homogeneous solution is the expression I have.

But wait, the options given are in specific forms, so I need to match my general solution to the options. Let's look at the options.

Option E: (3/2)(e^{-t} - e^{-3t})

That's a specific solution, maybe with initial conditions applied. Wait, but the question says 'homogeneous solution', which would just be the general solution. But maybe I'm misunderstanding—perhaps the problem is referring to the natural response, which is the homogeneous solution considering initial conditions.

Wait, the question says, "Find the homogeneous solution to a differential equation for the voltage, v_C(t)" across the capacitor. So perhaps the homogeneous solution is the general solution, but perhaps the problem expects us to find the particular solution using initial conditions, which would give a specific form. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no. The homogeneous solution is the general solution without any particular solution added. But when initial conditions are applied, we can find the particular homogeneous solution. So perhaps the question is asking for the general homogeneous solution, but looking at the options, they all seem to be specific forms, not general with arbitrary constants A and B. So maybe the question is actually asking for the natural response, considering the initial conditions, which would involve solving for A and B.

Wait, the initial conditions given are i_L(0) = 4 A and v_C(0) = 0 V.

Since i_L(0) is the current at t=0, which is equal to i(0), and since i(t) = C dv_C/dt, we can find expressions for v_C(0) and i(0).

Given that v_C(0) = 0, so substituting t=0 into the general solution:

v_C(0) = A e^0 + B e^0 = A + B = 0 → A = -B.

Additionally, the initial current i(0) = 4 A. Since i(t) = C dv_C/dt, let's compute dv_C/dt:

dv_C/dt = -A e^{-t} -3 B e^{-3t}

At t=0:

i(0) = C [ -A - 3 B ] = 4 A.

Because i(0) is given as 4 A, so:

C [ -A -3 B ] = 4.

Substituting C = 4/3:

(4/3)[ -A -3 B ] = 4 → (-A -3 B) = 4 * (3/4) = 3.

So:

-A -3 B = 3.

But from earlier, A = -B. Substitute A = -B into this equation:

-(-B) -3 B = 3 → B -3 B = 3 → -2 B =3 → B = -3/2.

Then, A = -B = 3/2.

So the particular solution is:

v_C(t) = (3/2) e^{-t} + (-3/2) e^{-3t} = (3/2)(e^{-t} - e^{-3t}).

Looking at the options, this matches option E: (3/2)(e^{-t} - e^{-3t}).

The homogeneous solution to the differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor in the given RLC circuit is derived by solving the characteristic equation. After applying the initial conditions, the particular solution is found to be (3/2)(e^{-t} - e^{-3t}).
