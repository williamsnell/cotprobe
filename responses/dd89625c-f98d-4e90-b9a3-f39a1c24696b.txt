Question:

What problems are posed in referring to the many forms of protozoans as belonging to one single animal phylum?

Options:

A: Protozoans can be classified into only two distinct groups based on mobility.
B: Protozoans all live in similar habitats, which negates the need for diverse classification.
C: Protozoans exhibit extreme diversity, taxonomic organization is problematic, and they possess certain plant-like features.
D: Protozoans are a type of bacteria, making their classification straightforward.
E: Protozoans are all the same
F: All protozoans have a similar genetic makeup, which simplifies classification.
G: Protozoans are easy to classify
H: Protozoans are multicellular organisms, which makes them easier to classify into one phylum.
I: The term 'protozoan' refers to a single species with little variation, thus one phylum is sufficient.
J: Protozoans only possess animal-like features

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about protozoans and their classification. Hmm, I remember that protozoans are a diverse group of single-celled eukaryotic organisms. They're often referred to as the "first animals" because they exhibit some animal-like characteristics, like movement and predation.

The question is asking what problems arise when we refer to all forms of protozoans as belonging to one single animal phylum. The options are A through J. Let me go through each one.

Option A says protozoans can be classified into only two distinct groups based on mobility. Wait, I think protozoans have various modes of movementâ€”like using pseudopodia, cilia, flagella, or even being non-motile. So if they can be divided into more than two groups, A might not be correct.

Option B claims they all live in similar habitats, negating the need for diverse classification. That doesn't sound right. Protozoans are found in a wide range of environments, including freshwater, marine environments, and even as parasites in hosts. So their habitats vary, making B incorrect.

Option C states they exhibit extreme diversity, taxonomic organization is problematic, and they possess certain plant-like features. I remember that protozoans are indeed very diverse. Some are parasitic, others live freely. Taxonomically, they've been tricky because they don't fit neatly into one category. Also, some have plant-like features, like cell walls in certain species. This seems to fit as a problem for classification.

Option D says they're a type of bacteria, making classification straightforward. No, protozoans are eukaryotes, while bacteria are prokaryotes. So D is wrong.

Option E claims they're all the same. That's obviously not true since they come in various forms and have different life styles.

Option F mentions similar genetic makeup simplifying classification. I don't think that's the case. Protozoans have a lot of genetic diversity, which complicates their classification.

Option G says they're easy to classify. That can't be right because their diversity makes classification challenging.

Option H suggests they're multicellular, making one phylum easier. Wait, no, protozoans are single-celled. So H is incorrect.

Option I refers to 'protozoan' as a single species with little variation. That's wrong; there's significant variation among protozoans.

Option J says they only have animal-like features. I recall that some protozoans have features similar to plants, like photosynthesis in some species. So J isn't correct.

Putting it together, the main issues are diversity, taxonomic problems, and some plant-like features. So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C: Protozoans exhibit extreme diversity, taxonomic organization is problematic, and they possess certain plant-like features.
