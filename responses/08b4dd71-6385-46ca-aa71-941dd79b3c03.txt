Okay, so I've got this problem here about fluid mechanics, specifically about finding the dimensionless form of the volume flux Q through a small bore tube at low velocities, which is laminar flow. The question says that Q is a function of the pipe radius r, the fluid viscosity μ, and the pressure drop per unit length (dp/dx). I need to use the power-product method to rewrite the relationship Q = f(r, μ, dp/dx) in a dimensionless form. The options are from A to I, each suggesting a different combination of these variables.

First, I remember that the power-product method involves determining the exponents for each variable so that the equation becomes dimensionless. To do this, I'll need to look at the dimensions of each quantity involved.

Looking at Table 1, the dimensions are given in two systems: MLTΘ and FLTΘ. I think the FLTΘ system might be more appropriate here because pressure is given in terms of force and length, which fits into this system.

Let me list out the dimensions of each variable:

- Q (volume flux) has dimensions L^3 T^-1.
- r (radius) is L.
- μ (viscosity) has dimensions F L T^-2.
- dp/dx is a pressure gradient. Pressure has dimensions F L^-1 T^-2, so dp/dx would have dimensions F L^-2 T^-2.

Wait, no, let me check that again. Pressure is force per unit area, so F/(L^2). So dp/dx would be (F/L^2)/L = F L^-3 T^-2? Wait, no, pressure is F/(L^2), so a gradient in pressure per unit length (dx) would be (F/L^2)/L = F L^-3 T^-2. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake here. Let me confirm: pressure (p) is ML^-1 T^-2 in MLT, which in FLT would be F L^-1 T^-2. So dp/dx would be F L^-2 T^-2.

Wait, no, because dp is F L^-1 T^-2, and dividing by dx (which is L) gives F L^-2 T^-2. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the equation we have is Q = f(r, μ, dp/dx). But to make it dimensionless, we can express Q in terms of these variables with appropriate exponents.

The general approach is to set up Q as proportional to r^a * μ^b * (dp/dx)^c, where a, b, c are exponents to be determined. Then, we'll ensure that the dimensions on both sides match.

So, let's write the dimensions of each part.

r has dimension L, so r^a is L^a.

μ has dimensions F L T^-2, so μ^b is F^b L^b T^{-2b}.

(dp/dx) has dimensions F L^-2 T^-2, so (dp/dx)^c is F^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c}.

Multiply these together: dimensions are F^b * F^c * L^{a + b - 2c} * T^{-2b - 2c}.

Q has dimensions L^3 T^{-1}, so we set up the equation:

F^{b + c} * L^{a + b - 2c} * T^{-2b - 2c} = L^3 T^{-1}.

But wait, Q is a volume flux, which in MLT is L^3 T^{-1}, but in FLT, since F is force, which is MLT^-2, perhaps I should check the dimensions again.

Wait, maybe I should stick with the FLT system. Let me make sure.

In FLTΘ, the dimensions are:

- Q: L^3 T^{-1}
- r: L
- μ: F L T^{-2}
- dp/dx: F L^{-2} T^{-2}

Now, the equation is Q = K * r^a * μ^b * (dp/dx)^c, where K is a dimensionless constant.

So, substituting the dimensions:

[L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a * [F L T^{-2}]^b * [F L^{-2} T^{-2}]^c.

Multiplying these together:

[L^a] * [F^b L^b T^{-2b}] * [F^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c}]

= F^{b + c} * L^{a + b - 2c} * T^{-2b - 2c}.

This must equal L^3 T^{-1}.

So, we can set up equations for each dimension:

1. Force (F): b + c = 0 (since there's no F on the left side)
2. Length (L): a + b - 2c = 3
3. Time (T): -2b - 2c = -1

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: b + c = 0 → c = -b

Equation 3: -2b - 2c = -1 → substituting c = -b,

-2b -2(-b) = -1 → -2b + 2b = -1 → 0 = -1. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Hmm, that suggests an error in my setup. Let me double-check the dimensions.

Wait, dp/dx is F L^{-2} T^{-2}, correct. So when I take (dp/dx)^c, the dimensions are F^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c}.

So when I include μ^b, which is F^b L^b T^{-2b}, the product becomes F^{b+c} L^{b + (-2c)} T^{-2b -2c}.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was F^{b + c} L^{a + b - 2c} T^{-2b - 2c}.

So the equations are:

1. Force: b + c = 0 → c = -b

2. Length: a + b - 2c = 3

3. Time: -2b -2c = -1

Substituting c = -b into equation 3:

-2b -2(-b) = -1 → -2b + 2b = -1 → 0 = -1 → which is impossible.

Hmm, that suggests an error in my approach. Maybe I made a mistake in the dimensions of μ or dp/dx.

Wait, let me check μ again. Viscosity μ has dimensions of ML^{-1} T^{-1} in MLT, which in FLT would be (since F = MLT^{-2}) → M is F T^2 L^{-1}.

Wait, maybe I should convert MLT to FLT. Let me think.

In MLT, μ is ML^{-1} T^{-1}.

In FLT, since F = ML T^{-2}, M = F T^2 L^{-1}.

So substituting into ML^{-1} T^{-1}:

(F T^2 L^{-1}) * L^{-1} * T^{-1} = F T L^{-2}.

So μ has dimensions F T L^{-2}.

Wait, but in the table, for viscosity μ, the dimensions are ML^{-1} T^{-1} in MLT, which is correct. In FLT, it's F L T^{-2} as per Table 1. Wait, looking back at Table 1, under FLTΘ, viscosity μ is F L T^{-2}? Wait no, looking at Table 1:

Viscosity μ is ML^{-1} T^{-1} in MLTΘ and F L T^{-2} in FLTΘ. So yes, μ has dimensions F L T^{-2}.

Similarly, dp/dx is F L^{-2} T^{-2}.

So back to the equations:

Equation 1: b + c = 0 → c = -b

Equation 2: a + b - 2c = 3

Equation 3: -2b -2c = -1

Substituting c = -b into equation 3:

-2b -2(-b) = -1 → -2b + 2b = -1 → 0 = -1 → which is impossible.

So that suggests that the current setup doesn't allow for a solution, which can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the way I set up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Q is proportional to some combination of r, μ, and (dp/dx), but maybe I'm missing something else. Or perhaps I should include other variables, but the problem states that Q depends only on r, μ, and dp/dx.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to find the exponents a, b, c such that the dimensions of r^a μ^b (dp/dx)^c equal the dimensions of Q, which is L^3 T^{-1}.

So:

r^a μ^b (dp/dx)^c = L^a * (F L T^{-2})^b * (F L^{-2} T^{-2})^c

= F^{b + c} L^{a + b - 2c} T^{-2b -2c}

Set this equal to L^3 T^{-1}, so:

F^{b + c} L^{a + b - 2c} T^{-2b -2c} = L^3 T^{-1}

Which gives three equations:

1. F: b + c = 0
2. L: a + b - 2c = 3
3. T: -2b -2c = -1

From equation 1: c = -b

Substituting into equation 3: -2b -2(-b) = -1 → -2b + 2b = -1 → 0 = -1. That's impossible. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimensions of μ or dp/dx. Let me check again.

μ in FLT is F L T^{-2}.

dp/dx is (F L^{-1} T^{-2}) / L = F L^{-2} T^{-2}.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Since the equations lead to an inconsistency, perhaps I've set up the problem incorrectly. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should include the radius in a different way. Let me think about the physical situation. In laminar flow through a pipe, the volume flux Q is proportional to the pressure gradient, the radius to some power, and inversely proportional to viscosity.

From Poiseuille's Law, I recall that Q is proportional to (dp/dx) * r^4 / μ. But wait, Poiseuille's Law is for the volumetric flow rate in a cylindrical tube under laminar conditions, and it states that Q = (π r^4 ΔP)/(8 μ L), where ΔP is the pressure difference over length L. So, in terms of dp/dx (which is ΔP/L), it would be Q = (π r^4 (dp/dx))/(8 μ). So, Q is proportional to (r^4 (dp/dx))/μ.

Looking at the options, option H is Q = const * (r^4 / μ) * (dp/dx). That matches this.

So, the correct answer should be option H.

But let me make sure by going back to the dimensional analysis.

If I set Q = K * r^a * (dp/dx)^b / μ^c, perhaps I should set it up that way instead. Alternatively, maybe I should write Q = K * r^a * (dp/dx)^b * μ^c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me try again.

Let me write Q = K * r^a * μ^b * (dp/dx)^c.

We need the dimensions to match:

[L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a * [F L T^{-2}]^b * [F L^{-2} T^{-2}]^c.

Multiplying the terms:

F^{b + c} * L^{a + b - 2c} * T^{-2b - 2c}.

Set equal to L^3 T^{-1}.

So:

1. F: b + c = 0 → c = -b
2. L: a + b - 2c = 3
3. T: -2b - 2c = -1

Substituting c = -b into equation 3:

-2b -2(-b) = -1 → -2b +2b = -1 → 0 = -1. Hmm, same problem.

Wait, maybe I should include the radius differently. Let's try to write Q in terms of r, μ, and dp/dx with exponents a, b, c.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Q is proportional to r^a * (dp/dx)^b / μ^c.

So, Q = K * r^a * (dp/dx)^b / μ^c.

Then, dimensions:

[L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a * [F L^{-2} T^{-2}]^b / [F L T^{-2}]^c.

Which becomes:

F^{b - c} * L^{a - 2b - c} * T^{-2b + 2c}.

Set equal to L^3 T^{-1}.

So:

1. F: b - c = 0 → c = b
2. L: a - 2b - c = 3 → since c = b, a - 2b - b = a -3b =3
3. T: -2b + 2c = -1 → since c = b, -2b +2b = 0 = -1 → Again, 0 = -1. Impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the power product, I can include other variables, but the problem states that Q depends only on r, μ, and dp/dx.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the physical formula. From Poiseuille's law, Q is proportional to (r^4)(dp/dx)/μ. So, Q = k (r^4)(dp/dx)/μ.

Let's check the dimensions:

r has dimension L, so r^4 is L^4.

(dp/dx) is F L^{-2} T^{-2}.

μ is F L T^{-2}.

So, putting it together: (L^4) * (F L^{-2} T^{-2}) / (F L T^{-2}) ) = L^4 * (F L^{-2} T^{-2}) / (F L T^{-2}) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= L^4 * (F L^{-2} T^{-2}) / (F L T^{-2}) )

= L^4 * (L^{-2} ) / L )

= L^4 * L^{-3} = L.

Wait, but Q has dimensions L^3 T^{-1}, so that doesn't match. Hmm, that suggests an error. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the dimensions step by step:

Numerator: r^4 has L^4.

(dp/dx) has F L^{-2} T^{-2}.

Multiply them: L^4 * F L^{-2} T^{-2} = F L^{2} T^{-2}.

Denominator: μ is F L T^{-2}.

So, [Q] = (F L^2 T^{-2}) / (F L T^{-2}) ) = (F cancels) L^{2-1} T^{-2 +2} = L T^0 = L.

But Q should be L^3 T^{-1}, so this approach must be wrong.

Wait, but from Poiseuille's law, I know that Q is proportional to r^4 (dp/dx) / μ, but perhaps I'm missing a factor that includes time.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the time dimension correctly. Let me check:

(dp/dx) is F L^{-2} T^{-2}.

μ is F L T^{-2}.

So, (dp/dx) / μ = (F L^{-2} T^{-2}) / (F L T^{-2}) ) = (F cancels) L^{-3} T^0.

So, (dp/dx)/μ has dimensions L^{-3}.

r^4 has L^4.

So, r^4 * (dp/dx)/μ has dimensions L^4 * L^{-3} = L.

But Q is L^3 T^{-1}, so this approach isn't giving me the right dimensions. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a term involving time. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the correct expression includes a square root or some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this with dimensional analysis again, but more carefully.

Let me try to write Q in terms of r, μ, and dp/dx, with exponents a, b, c:

Q = K r^a μ^b (dp/dx)^c.

Dimensions:

[L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a [F L T^{-2}]^b [F L^{-2} T^{-2}]^c.

Multiply the terms:

F^{b + c} L^{a + b - 2c} T^{-2b - 2c}.

Set equal to L^3 T^{-1}.

So, the equations are:

1. F: b + c = 0 → c = -b
2. L: a + b - 2c = 3
3. T: -2b -2c = -1

Substituting c = -b into equation 3:

-2b -2(-b) = -1 → -2b + 2b = -1 → 0 = -1 → which is impossible.

This suggests that there's no solution, which can't be right because we know from Poiseuille's law that such a relation exists.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimensions of μ or dp/dx.

Wait, checking the table again: in FLT, μ is F L T^{-2}, and dp/dx is F L^{-2} T^{-2}.

So, perhaps I should consider that the equation might involve other variables, but the problem states that Q depends only on r, μ, and dp/dx.

Alternatively, maybe I should include velocity, but the problem says it's a function only of r, μ, and dp/dx.

Hmm. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that the correct form is Q = K (r^a) (dp/dx)^b / μ^c.

Then, dimensions:

[L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a * [F L^{-2} T^{-2}]^b / [F L T^{-2}]^c.

Which is:

F^{b - c} * L^{a -2b - c} * T^{-2b + 2c}.

Set equal to L^3 T^{-1}.

So:

1. F: b - c = 0 → c = b
2. L: a -2b - c = 3 → a -3b =3
3. T: -2b + 2c = -1 → substituting c =b → -2b + 2b = 0 = -1 → again impossible.

This suggests that the exponents can't satisfy the time equation. But that can't be correct because Poiseuille's law works.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pressure gradient is per unit length, so perhaps I should include the radius in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the velocity profile. In laminar flow, the velocity v at a distance y from the center is given by v = (2 r^2 (dp/dx))/(μ) * (1 - (y^2)/(r^2)). The maximum velocity at the center is v_max = (4 r^2 (dp/dx))/(μ).

The volume flux Q is the integral of velocity over the cross-sectional area. For a circular pipe, the integral gives Q = π r^4 (dp/dx)/(8 μ). So, Q is proportional to r^4 (dp/dx)/μ.

So, in terms of dimensions, Q should be proportional to (r^4) (dp/dx) / μ.

Let me check the dimensions again:

r^4: L^4

(dp/dx): F L^{-2} T^{-2}

μ: F L T^{-2}

So, (dp/dx)/μ = (F L^{-2} T^{-2}) / (F L T^{-2}) ) = L^{-3}.

Thus, r^4 * (dp/dx)/μ has dimensions L^4 * L^{-3} = L.

But Q has dimensions L^3 T^{-1}, so that's not matching. Therefore, I must be missing something. There's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should include the radius in a way that brings in time. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor that includes time.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the kinematic viscosity, which is ν = μ/ρ, but the problem doesn't mention density. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the Reynolds number, but that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, maybe I should try a different set of exponents. Let's suppose that Q is proportional to r^a μ^b (dp/dx)^c.

We have:

[L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a [F L T^{-2}]^b [F L^{-2} T^{-2}]^c.

Which is F^{b + c} L^{a + b - 2c} T^{-2b - 2c}.

Set equal to L^3 T^{-1}.

So:

1. F: b + c = 0 → c = -b
2. L: a + b - 2c = 3
3. T: -2b - 2c = -1

Substituting c = -b into equation 3:

-2b -2(-b) = -1 → -2b + 2b = -1 → 0 = -1. Still impossible.

This suggests that it's impossible to find exponents a, b, c that satisfy all three equations. But that can't be right because we know Poiseuille's law works.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong system of units. Let me try using MLT instead of FLT.

In MLT, the dimensions are:

Q: L^3 T^{-1}

r: L

μ: M L^{-1} T^{-1}

dp/dx: M L^{-1} T^{-2} (since pressure is M L^{-1} T^{-2}, so gradient is M L^{-2} T^{-2}).

So, let's try this approach.

Expressing Q = K r^a μ^b (dp/dx)^c.

Dimensions:

[L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a [M L^{-1} T^{-1}]^b [M L^{-2} T^{-2}]^c.

Expanding:

M^{b + c} L^{a - b - 2c} T^{-b - 2c}.

Set equal to M^0 L^3 T^{-1}.

So:

1. M: b + c = 0 → c = -b
2. L: a - b - 2c =3 → substituting c = -b: a - b -2(-b) = a -b +2b = a +b =3
3. T: -b -2c = -1 → substituting c =-b: -b -2(-b) = -b +2b = b =-1 → b = -1.

From equation 1, c = -b → c=1.

From equation 2: a + b =3 → a + (-1) =3 → a =4.

So exponents are: a=4, b=-1, c=1.

Thus, Q = K r^4 μ^{-1} (dp/dx)^1 → Q = K (r^4 (dp/dx))/μ.

So, the correct form is Q proportional to (r^4 (dp/dx))/μ, which matches Poiseuille's law.

Now, looking at the options, option H is Q = const * (r^4/μ) * (dp/dx). So that's correct.
</think>

To determine the dimensionless form of the volume flux \( Q \) through a small-bore tube under laminar flow, we use the power-product method. The relationship is given as \( Q = f(r, \mu, \frac{dp}{dx}) \), where \( r \) is the pipe radius, \( \mu \) is the fluid viscosity, and \( \frac{dp}{dx} \) is the pressure drop per unit length. 

### Dimensional Analysis
1. **Dimensions of Variables**:
   - \( Q \): \( L^3 T^{-1} \)
   - \( r \): \( L \)
   - \( \mu \): \( F L T^{-2} \) (in FLT units)
   - \( \frac{dp}{dx} \): \( F L^{-2} T^{-2} \)

2. **Assume \( Q \propto r^a \mu^b \left(\frac{dp}{dx}\right)^c \)**:
   Substituting dimensions:
   \[
   [L^3 T^{-1}] = [L]^a [F L T^{-2}]^b [F L^{-2} T^{-2}]^c
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   F^{b+c} L^{a+b-2c} T^{-2b-2c} = L^3 T^{-1}
   \]

3. **Equating Dimensions**:
   - **Force (\( F \))**: \( b + c = 0 \) → \( c = -b \)
   - **Length (\( L \))**: \( a + b - 2c = 3 \)
   - **Time (\( T \))**: \( -2b - 2c = -1 \)

4. **Solving the System**:
   - From \( c = -b \), substitute into the time equation:
     \[
     -2b - 2(-b) = -1 \implies 0 = -1
     \]
     This inconsistency suggests an error in the initial setup. Revisiting the problem using Poiseuille's Law, where \( Q \propto \frac{r^4 \frac{dp}{dx}}{\mu} \), resolves this.

5. **Final Form**:
   Substituting \( a = 4 \), \( b = -1 \), and \( c = 1 \), we get:
   \[
   Q = \text{const} \cdot \frac{r^4 \frac{dp}{dx}}{\mu}
   \]

### Conclusion
The correct dimensionless form matches **Option H**: \( Q = \text{const} \cdot \frac{r^4}{\mu} \cdot \frac{dp}{dx} \).

H
