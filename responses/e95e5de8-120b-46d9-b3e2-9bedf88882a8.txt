Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the characteristics of arteries, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through each option one by one and see which one makes sense.

The question is asking which is the correct characteristic of arteries. I remember that arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart, but I should double-check each option to make sure.

Option A: They carry blood towards the heart. Wait, that sounds like veins because veins bring blood back to the heart. Arteries carry blood away, so A is probably incorrect.

Option B: They always carry deoxygenated blood. Hmm, no, that's not right. Except for the pulmonary artery, which carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs, most arteries carry oxygenated blood. So B isn't correct because it says "always."

Option C: They carry blood away from the heart. Yes, that's what I was thinking earlier. Arteries transport blood from the heart to other parts of the body. So C seems correct.

Option D: They contain valves that prevent backflow. I think this is true for veins, not arteries. Veins have valves to prevent blood from flowing backward, especially in the legs. Arteries usually don't need valves because the pressure from the heart keeps the blood moving forward. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: They always carry oxygenated blood. No, same as B. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood, so E is incorrect because it's not always the case.

Option F: They have a large lumen compared to veins. I'm not too sure about this one. I remember that arteries have thick walls and a smaller lumen compared to veins. Veins are wider because they carry blood back, which is a different flow. So F might be wrong.

Option G: They are responsible for the exchange of gases and nutrients. No, that's the job of capillaries. Capillaries are where oxygen, nutrients, and waste products are exchanged between blood and tissues. So G is incorrect.

Option H: They form a network of small vessels called capillaries. No, capillaries are the smallest vessels, and they're at the end of the arterial system. Arteries branch into arterioles and then into capillaries, so H is incorrect.

Option I: They are thin-walled blood vessels. No, arteries have thick, muscular walls to withstand the high pressure of the pumped blood, unlike veins. So I is wrong.

Option J: They contain no muscle tissue. That's not true. Arteries have a lot of smooth muscle in their walls, which helps regulate blood flow. So J is incorrect.

So after going through each option, the correct one must be C: They carry blood away from the heart. That matches what I know about arteries.

The correct characteristic of arteries is that they carry blood away from the heart.

Answer: C
