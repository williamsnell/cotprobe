Alright, so I've got this question about tort law, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is an auto mechanic who was working in his shop. A spark ignited gasoline and oil residue on the floor, causing a fire. He managed to put it out, but the smoke spread over to the neighbor's property, discoloring their home. The neighbor is suing the mechanic. I need to determine which tort the neighbor can recover for.

First, I'll recall the different torts listed in the options. The main ones here are negligence, nuisance, strict liability, trespass, and maybe others.

Negligence involves a duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. So, did the mechanic owe a duty to the neighbor? He was working in his own shop, but if his actions created a foreseeable risk to the neighbor, that could be negligence. But sometimes, when dealing with abnormally dangerous activities, strict liability might apply instead.

Strict liability is when someone is held liable regardless of fault because the activity is inherently dangerous. Gasoline and oil are hazardous, so if the mechanic was handling them, strict liability could be applicable. The fire started due to a spark from his work, which led to the smoke affecting the neighbor's property.

Nuisance is another option. A nuisance involves unreasonable interference with someone's use and enjoyment of their property. The smoke discoloring the home could be seen as a nuisance. But I think strict liability might be a better fit here because it's about abnormally dangerous activities.

Looking at the other options: Conversion is about taking someone's property, which doesn't fit. Vicarious liability is when someone is liable for another's actions, but that's not the case here. Defamation is about false statements harming reputation, which isn't relevant. Intentional infliction of emotional distress requires intentional and extreme conduct, which might not apply here. Assault and battery are about physical contact or threat, which isn't the case. Trespass is about unauthorized entry, but smoke isn't a physical trespass. Invasion of privacy is more about personal privacy rights, not property damage.

So, between negligence and strict liability. The mechanic was performing activities that are considered abnormally dangerousâ€”handling flammable materials. Under strict liability, even if he was careful, he could still be liable if his activity caused damage. Since the fire spread smoke to the neighbor's property, causing discoloration, this seems like a case where strict liability would apply because gasoline and oil residue are hazardous.

Alternatively, negligence might also apply if the mechanic was negligent in handling the materials, but since it's about abnormally dangerous activities, strict liability is more appropriate. Therefore, the neighbor would most likely recover under strict liability.

The correct answer is F: strict liability. The mechanic's handling of gasoline and oil residue, which are inherently dangerous, falls under strict liability. The fire and resulting smoke caused damage to the neighbor's property, making strict liability the applicable tort.

Answer: F
