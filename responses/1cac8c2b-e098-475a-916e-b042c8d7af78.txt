Okay, so I have this question about pricing strategies, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again: "Where the price is set low relative to the competition to gain market share, this strategy is known as..." The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that different pricing strategies have different goals. The question is talking about setting a low price compared to competitors to gain more customers. I think this is a common strategy in marketing. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Captive product pricing. I'm not too sure about this one. I think captive products are things you need to buy along with another product, like printer ink with the printer. So maybe this isn't the right one.

Option B: High-low pricing. That sounds like when a company sets high prices for some products and low for others. Or maybe it's about having high prices sometimes and low others, like sales. Not sure if it's about being lower than competitors all the time.

Option C: Price skimming. I remember this one is when a company sets a high price initially to capture maximum profit from early adopters, then lowers the price over time. So this is the opposite of what the question is asking.

Option D: Value added pricing. This is when the price reflects the added value, like extra features or benefits. It's not necessarily about being lower than the competition.

Option E: Penetration pricing. Oh, wait! Penetration pricing is when a company sets a low price to enter a market quickly and gain market share. That fits the question exactly because it's about being lower than competitors to take over a larger part of the market.

Option F: Premium pricing. This is when products are priced higher to convey exclusivity or higher quality. Definitely not this one.

Option G: Cost-plus pricing. This method adds a standard markup to the cost of production. It's more about covering costs and making a profit, not necessarily about competition.

Option H: Economy pricing. I think this is similar to penetration pricing but might be more about low-cost products. Maybe it's when a product is priced low because it's of lower quality or has fewer features, not necessarily to gain market share against competitors.

Option I: Psychological pricing. This involves pricing based on consumer psychology, like setting prices just below a round number. Doesn't seem to fit the question.

Option J: Competitive pricing. This is when the price is set based on what competitors are charging. It's about matching or being just below them, but I'm not sure if it's the same as penetration pricing.

Wait, the question says "set low relative to the competition to gain market share." Penetration pricing is specifically about entering the market with a low price to capture a lot of customers. Competitive pricing might involve matching or being close to competitors, but penetration is more about a deliberate low pricing strategy to gain market share quickly. So I think the answer is E: Penetration pricing.

The correct answer is E: Penetration pricing. This strategy involves setting a low price to quickly gain market share by attracting customers from competitors.
