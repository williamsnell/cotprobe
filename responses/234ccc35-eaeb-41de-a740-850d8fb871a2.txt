Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about bubbles expanding as they rise from the bottom of a pond. Hmm, I think it's related to pressure and gases. Let me try to break it down.

The pond is 34 feet deep. Bubbles start at the bottom, so they're under water pressure there. As they rise, the pressure decreases because they're moving towards the surface. I remember that when pressure decreases, if temperature is constant, the volume of a gas increases. So the bubbles should expand as they go up, which matches the question.

Wait, the question is asking how much the volume increases. So I need to find the ratio of the final volume to the initial volume. Oh right, since temperature is constant, I can use Boyle's Law. Boyle's Law states that P1V1 = P2V2, where P is pressure and V is volume.

First, I need to figure out the pressure at the bottom of the pond and the pressure at the surface. But wait, the problem says "at the bottom of a pond 34 ft deep." I guess the pressure there is due to the water above it. So the pressure at depth h in water is P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of water, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the depth.

But wait, the problem probably assumes standard atmospheric pressure at the surface. Let me think about units. In the US, atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi (pounds per square inch). But in metric, it's about 101,325 Pascals. Hmm, but the depth is given in feet, so maybe the problem expects me to use psi.

Wait, no, maybe the problem is using gauge pressure. So the total pressure at the bottom is atmospheric plus the pressure from the water. Let me clarify. At the surface, the pressure is just atmospheric, P2 = 1 atm. At depth h, the pressure is P1 = P_atm + ρgh.

So I need to compute the pressure at the bottom and then find the volume ratio.

Wait, let's get the exact values. The depth is 34 feet. Let me convert that to meters because I'm more comfortable with SI units. 1 foot is 0.3048 meters, so 34 ft is 34 * 0.3048 ≈ 10.375 meters.

Density of water, ρ, is 1000 kg/m³. Gravity, g, is 9.81 m/s². So the pressure from the water is P_water = ρgh = 1000 * 9.81 * 10.375 ≈ let's compute that.

1000 * 9.81 is 9810, times 10.375: 9810 * 10 = 98,100, 9810 * 0.375 ≈ 3678.75. So total P_water ≈ 98,100 + 3,678.75 ≈ 101,778.75 Pascals.

Wait, 1 atm is about 101,325 Pascals. So the water pressure here is about 101,778.75 Pa. That's actually a bit more than atmospheric pressure. Wait, that can't be right because 10 meters of water is roughly 1 atm. Oh wait, 10 meters is about 1 atm. So 10.375 meters would be a bit more, like about 1.03 atm. So the total pressure at the bottom is P1 = P_atm + P_water. Wait no, because P_water is the pressure exerted by the water, so P1 = P_atm + P_water. But wait, wait, if the water is 10.375 meters deep, the pressure due to the water is about 1 atm (since 10m ≈ 1 atm). So P1 = 1 atm (from air) + 1 atm (from water) ≈ 2 atm.

Wait, but that might not be the right way to think about it. Because actually, the pressure at the bottom is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure from the water column. So P1 = P_atm + (ρgh).

Given that, with h = 10.375 m, ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g=9.81, then P_water = 1000 * 9.81 * 10.375 ≈ 101,778.75 Pa, which is about 100,325 Pa more than 1 atm (since 1 atm is 101,325 Pa). So P_water ≈ 101,778.75 Pa. Wait, that's actually more than 1 atm. So P1 = P_atm + P_water = 101,325 + 101,778.75 ≈ 203,103.75 Pa. That seems high. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm confusing gauge pressure with absolute pressure. Because the pressure at the surface is 1 atm, and the pressure at depth h is P = P_atm + ρgh. So yes, P1 is P_atm plus the pressure from the water.

Wait, but if the water is 34 feet deep, which is about 10.375 meters, then the pressure due to the water is ρgh = 1000 * 9.81 * 10.375 ≈ 101,778.75 Pa, which is about 100,325 Pa more than 1 atm. So P1 ≈ 1 atm + 1.004 atm ≈ 2.004 atm.

Wait, but that's under the assumption that the atmospheric pressure is negligible compared to the water pressure, which it's not in this case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the pressure at the bottom as just the pressure from the water, without adding atmospheric pressure. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the pressure at the bottom is the gauge pressure, which is ρgh, and the pressure at the surface is atmospheric. So P1 = ρgh, and P2 = atmospheric pressure. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because the atmospheric pressure is the pressure at the surface. So the absolute pressure at the bottom is P_atm + ρgh. So P1 = P_atm + ρgh, and P2 = P_atm.

Wait, but then when the bubbles rise, the pressure decreases from P1 to P2. So using Boyle's Law, P1V1 = P2V2 → V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2).

Wait, no, because if pressure decreases, volume increases. So V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2). Wait, that doesn't make sense because if P2 is lower than P1, then V2 should be larger. Let me get the formula right.

Boyle's Law: P1V1 = P2V2 → V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2). Since P2 < P1, V2 > V1.

So the ratio V2/V1 = P1/P2.

Wait, no, wait: P1 is the initial pressure, and P2 is the final pressure. So V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2). So the volume increases by a factor of P1/P2.

Wait, but that would mean that if P1 is twice P2, the volume doubles, right? So the ratio is P1/P2.

Wait, but in this case, P1 = P_atm + ρgh, and P2 = P_atm.

So let me compute P1 and P2 in terms of atm.

P1 = P_atm + (ρgh)/(1 atm). Let's see: (ρgh)/(1 atm) is the pressure in atm due to the water depth.

So (ρgh) in Pascals is 1000 * 9.81 * 10.375 ≈ 101,778.75 Pa. 1 atm is 101,325 Pa, so (101,778.75 / 101,325) ≈ 1.0045 atm. So P1 = 1 atm + 1.0045 atm ≈ 2.0045 atm.

P2 is 1 atm at the surface.

So the ratio V2/V1 = P1/P2 = 2.0045 / 1 ≈ 2.0045. So the volume increases by about 2 times.

Looking at the options, option E is 2/1, which would mean the volume doubles. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach is to consider that the pressure at the bottom is approximately twice atmospheric pressure, so the volume would double when it rises to the surface, where pressure is 1 atm. So that's why the ratio is 2:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using gauge pressure, where the pressure at the bottom is just ρgh, which is 1 atm (since 10m ≈ 1 atm). So P1 = 1 atm, P2 = 0 atm (but that can't be right because at the surface, P2 is 1 atm). Wait, no, that can't be right. So I think the correct approach is P1 = 2 atm and P2 = 1 atm, leading to V2/V1 = 2.

Therefore, the answer should be E: 2/1.

The problem involves bubbles expanding as they rise from the bottom of a 34-foot-deep pond. Using Boyle's Law, the pressure at the bottom is calculated as approximately twice the atmospheric pressure, leading to a volume increase by a factor of 2.
