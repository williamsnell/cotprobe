Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find how many pairs of (a, b) can be substituted into the number 30a0b03 so that the resulting integer is divisible by 13. The options are A through J, with numbers from 0 to 9. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I should probably figure out what the number 30a0b03 looks like when a and b are digits. The number is structured as 3 0 a 0 b 0 3, so it's a 7-digit number. Each of a and b can be any digit from 0 to 9, right? So that gives 10 possibilities for a and 10 for b, making 100 possible pairs in total. But obviously, only some of these will make the number divisible by 13.

Now, the key here is to find when 30a0b03 is divisible by 13. I remember that there's a rule for divisibility by 13, but I'm not exactly sure what it is. I think one method is to take the last digit, multiply it by 4, and add it to the rest of the number. But wait, maybe that's for 7? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Alternatively, I could use modular arithmetic to check divisibility by 13.

Let me write the number in terms of its digits. The number is 3,000,000 + 0*100,000 + a*10,000 + 0*1,000 + b*100 + 0*10 + 3. So that's 3,000,000 + a*10,000 + b*100 + 3. Let me compute that as 3,000,000 + 10,000a + 100b + 3. So the number N can be written as N = 3,000,003 + 10,000a + 100b.

Now, I need N mod 13 to be 0. So I can compute each term modulo 13 and then combine them.

Let me compute 3,000,003 mod 13 first. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe I can break it down.

I know that 1000 mod 13 is 12 because 13*76=988, and 1000-988=12. So 1000 ≡ -1 mod 13, because 12 ≡ -1 mod 13.

Wait, that's useful. So 10^3 ≡ -1 mod 13. Let's see how that helps.

Let me express 3,000,003 as 3*10^6 + 0*10^5 + 0*10^4 + 0*10^3 + 0*10^2 + 0*10 + 3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 3,000,003 mod 13 by breaking it down digit by digit using the rule for divisibility by 13, which I think involves taking the last digit, multiplying by 4, and subtracting it from the rest. Wait, no, maybe it's adding, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 10 ≡ 10 mod 13, 10^2 ≡ 9, 10^3 ≡ 12, 10^4 ≡ 3, 10^5 ≡ 4, 10^6 ≡ 1, etc. Let me compute the powers of 10 modulo 13 up to 10^6.

Compute 10^k mod 13 for k=0 to 6:

10^0 ≡ 1
10^1 ≡ 10
10^2 ≡ (10*10)=100 mod13. 13*7=91, 100-91=9 → 9
10^3 ≡ 10*9=90 mod13. 13*6=78, 90-78=12 → 12
10^4 ≡ 10*12=120 mod13. 13*9=117, 120-117=3 →3
10^5 ≡10*3=30 mod13. 13*2=26, 30-26=4 →4
10^6 ≡10*4=40 mod13. 13*3=39, 40-39=1 →1

So 10^6 ≡1 mod13, which means that the cycle repeats every 6 digits.

Now, let's compute 3,000,003 mod13.

The number is 3,000,003, which is 3*10^6 + 0*10^5 + 0*10^4 + 0*10^3 + 0*10^2 + 0*10 +3.

Using the mod13 values for each power:

3*(10^6 mod13) =3*1=3
0*(10^5 mod13)=0*4=0
0*(10^4 mod13)=0*3=0
0*(10^3 mod13)=0*12=0
0*(10^2 mod13)=0*9=0
0*(10^1 mod13)=0*10=0
3*(10^0 mod13)=3*1=3

Adding all these up: 3 + 0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +3 =6.

So 3,000,003 ≡6 mod13.

Now, the other terms in N are 10,000a and 100b. Let's compute each mod13.

10,000a mod13: 10,000 is 10^4, which mod13 is 3 as computed earlier. So 10,000a ≡3a mod13.

100b mod13: 100 is 10^2, which mod13 is 9. So 100b ≡9b mod13.

So putting it all together, N ≡6 +3a +9b mod13.

We need N mod13=0, so:

6 +3a +9b ≡0 mod13.

Let me write that as:

3a +9b ≡-6 mod13.

But -6 mod13 is 7 because 13-6=7.

So 3a +9b ≡7 mod13.

I can factor out a 3:

3(a + 3b) ≡7 mod13.

Now, 3 and 13 are coprime, so I can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod13.

The inverse of 3 mod13 is 9 because 3*9=27≡1 mod13.

So multiplying both sides by 9:

9*3(a +3b) ≡9*7 mod13 → (27)(a +3b) ≡63 mod13.

But 27≡1 mod13, so:

a +3b ≡63 mod13.

Compute 63 mod13: 13*4=52, 63-52=11. So 63≡11 mod13.

So a +3b ≡11 mod13.

Now, a and b are digits from 0 to9, so their possible values are 0-9 each.

I need to find all pairs (a, b) where a and b are between 0 and9, inclusive, such that a +3b ≡11 mod13.

Let me consider the equation a +3b =11 +13k, where k is an integer.

Since a and b are digits (0-9), let's find possible values of k.

The minimum a +3b can be is 0 +0=0, maximum is 9 +3*9=36.

So 11 +13k must be between 0 and 36.

Let's find possible k:

11 +13k ≥0 → k ≥-11/13 → k≥-0.846, so k≥-0. So possible k starts from 0.

11 +13k ≤36 →13k ≤25 →k ≤25/13≈1.923. So k can be 0,1.

So possible equations:

Case 1: k=0 → a +3b=11.

Case 2: k=1 → a +3b=24.

Case 3: k=2 → a +3b=37, but 37>36, so no solution here.

So only k=0 and k=1.

Now, let's find all (a,b) pairs for each case.

Case 1: a +3b=11.

We can iterate b from 0 to9 and see if a=11-3b is between 0 and9.

b=0: a=11 → invalid (a must be ≤9)
b=1: a=11-3=8 → valid. So (8,1)
b=2: a=11-6=5 → valid. (5,2)
b=3: a=11-9=2 → valid. (2,3)
b=4: a=11-12= -1 → invalid
b≥4: a negative, invalid.

So in case 1, we have 3 valid pairs: (8,1), (5,2), (2,3).

Wait, wait. Let me check b=4: 11-12= -1, which is invalid. So yes, only up to b=3.

Case 2: a +3b=24.

Again, iterate b from 0 to9, compute a=24-3b, and check if a is between 0 and9.

b=0: a=24 → invalid
b=1: a=21 → invalid
b=2: a=18 → invalid
b=3: a=15 → invalid
b=4: a=12 → invalid
b=5: a=9 → valid. (9,5)
b=6: a=6 → valid. (6,6)
b=7: a=3 → valid. (3,7)
b=8: a=0 → valid. (0,8)
b=9: a=24-27= -3 → invalid.

Wait, let me check each step:

b=5: 24-3*5=24-15=9 → valid
b=6:24-18=6 → valid
b=7:24-21=3 → valid
b=8:24-24=0 → valid
b=9:24-27=-3 → invalid.

So in case 2, we have 4 valid pairs: (9,5), (6,6), (3,7), (0,8).

So total pairs from both cases: 3 (from case1) +4 (from case2) =7.

Wait, but let me double-check because it's easy to make a mistake here.

Case1: 3 pairs.

Case2: 4 pairs.

Total 7 pairs. So the answer should be 7, which is option H.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible k values. Earlier, I thought k could be 0 and 1 because for k=2, a+3b=37 which is beyond the maximum possible a+3b=36. So no, that's correct.

Let me list all the pairs:

Case1:
(8,1)
(5,2)
(2,3)

Case2:
(9,5)
(6,6)
(3,7)
(0,8)

Total of 7 pairs. So the answer is 7, which is option H.

The number 30a0b03 can be expressed as 3,000,003 + 10,000a + 100b. Using modular arithmetic, we find that 3,000,003 ≡ 6 mod13, 10,000a ≡ 3a mod13, and 100b ≡ 9b mod13. Thus, the equation becomes 6 + 3a + 9b ≡ 0 mod13, simplifying to 3(a + 3b) ≡ 7 mod13. Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 3 (which is 9 mod13) gives a + 3b ≡ 11 mod13.

Considering a and b are digits (0-9), we solve for possible pairs:

1. **Case 1 (k=0):** a + 3b = 11  
   Valid pairs: (8,1), (5,2), (2,3).

2. **Case 2 (k=1):** a + 3b = 24  
   Valid pairs: (9,5), (6,6), (3,7), (0,8).

Summing the valid pairs gives a total of 7 pairs.

Answer: H
