Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. The question is about defining pleasure and tracing its development from infancy to adolescence, as well as understanding what causes humor and the situations that make adults smile and laugh. 

First, I'll break down the question into parts. The first part is defining pleasure. From what I know, pleasure is generally a positive feeling that comes from doing something enjoyable. It's often associated with things that make us happy, like eating good food, playing, or achieving a goal. In infancy, pleasure would probably be more basic, like when a baby smiles while eating or being held. As children grow into adolescence, their sources of pleasure might change. They might find pleasure in social interactions, hobbies, or achieving academic goals.

The second part asks about the development of pleasure from infancy to adolescence. I think that as children grow, their understanding of pleasure becomes more complex. Infants might seek physical comfort and immediate gratification, while adolescents might value social acceptance, intellectual achievements, or personal accomplishments. Their expressions of pleasure, like smiling or laughing, would likely become more varied and nuanced as they grow older.

The third part is about what accounts for humor. Humor is tricky because it's subjective and can vary widely between individuals and cultures. However, generally, humor arises from situations that are unexpected, absurd, or have a twist. Jokes, riddles, and funny stories are classic examples. These elements surprise us or make us see something in a new way, which triggers laughter.

The last part asks about the situations that produce smiling and laughter in adults. I believe that adults smile and laugh primarily in response to humor, such as when they find something funny, like a joke or a funny situation. Social interactions, like being with friends who make us laugh, are also common triggers. Sometimes, laughter can also be a way to cope with stress or to bond with others.

Now, looking at the options provided:

Option H says, "Pleasure is a reaction to the satisfaction of a motive or the achievement of a goal. Smiling and laughter in adults mainly occur as a result of humor, usually in the form of jokes, riddles, funny stories, etc." This seems to align with what I was thinking. It covers the definition of pleasure as a reaction to achieving something, which fits both infancy (like getting a toy) and adolescence (like getting good grades). It also connects humor to laughter in adults through jokes and funny stories, which makes sense.

Other options don't fit as well. For example, Option A says pleasure stops in adolescence, which isn't true because adults definitely experience pleasure. Option B claims laughter is a sign of discomfort, which I don't think is correct; laughter is usually a positive response. Option D says smiling indicates fear, which is the opposite of what I know. Option I talks about pleasure becoming purely intellectual, which might not capture the full range of pleasure experiences. Option H seems to be the best fit.

The correct answer is H, as it accurately describes pleasure as a reaction to achieving goals and links adult laughter to humor, such as jokes and funny stories.
