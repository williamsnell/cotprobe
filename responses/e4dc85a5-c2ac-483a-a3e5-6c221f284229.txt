Okay, so I have this question about group theory in mathematics, specifically dealing with 2x2 integer matrices. The question presents two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false, then select the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by recalling what defines a group. A group under a certain operation must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for each element.

First, let's tackle Statement 1: "The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication."

I know that matrix multiplication is associative, so that's covered. The identity matrix is in the set since its determinant is 1, which is nonzero. But what about inverses? For a matrix to have an inverse under multiplication, its determinant must be invertible in the real numbers. But wait, we're dealing with integer matrices here. The determinant being nonzero (so it's an integer not equal to zero) doesn't necessarily mean it's invertible in the integers. For example, a matrix with determinant 2 would have an inverse, but that inverse would involve fractions (1/2), which are not integers. So the inverse matrix wouldn't have integer entries. Therefore, the set isn't closed under multiplication because the inverse might not be in the set. So Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2: "The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication."

Again, checking the group properties. Associativity holds for matrix multiplication. The identity matrix has determinant 1, so it's included. For inverses, if a matrix has determinant 1, its inverse will have determinant 1 as well because the determinant of the inverse is 1/det(A), which in this case is 1. But wait, does the inverse necessarily have integer entries? Let's think. If A is an integer matrix with det(A)=1, then A inverse is also an integer matrix because the entries of A inverse are given by the adjugate matrix divided by the determinant. Since determinant is 1, it doesn't affect the entries, and the adjugate will have integer entries (because the original matrix has integer entries). So the inverse is also in the set. As for closure, the product of two matrices with determinant 1 will have determinant 1*1=1, so the product is in the set. Therefore, all group properties are satisfied, making Statement 2 true.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the closure part. Let me double-check. If I multiply two integer matrices each with determinant 1, their product's determinant is 1. Yes, that's correct. And the entries will still be integers because matrix multiplication of integer matrices results in integer entries. So closure holds.

So Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. Looking at the options, option D is False, True, which would be the correct choice.

The set of 2x2 integer matrices with nonzero determinants isn't closed under multiplication because inverses may not have integer entries. However, matrices with determinant 1 form a group as they are closed, associative, contain the identity, and inverses are also integer matrices.
