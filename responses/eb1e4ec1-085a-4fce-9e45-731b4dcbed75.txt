Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Articles of Confederation. I'm a bit rusty on my US history, but I'll try to think it through. The question asks what power the national government had under the Articles. The options are A through G.

First, I remember that the Articles of Confederation were the first system of government in the US, before the Constitution. They were in place from 1781 to 1789. One of the main problems with the Articles was that the national government was too weak. So I need to recall what specific powers it did have.

Option A says it could abolish state governments. That doesn't sound right. The Articles were more about a confederation, which is a union of states, so I don't think the national government had the power to abolish the states. They were supposed to maintain their sovereignty.

Option B is about regulating interstate commerce. Wait, I think that was a power given to the national government under the Constitution, specifically in Article I, Section 8. The Articles might not have given that power because the states were more independent.

Option C is establishing a federal judiciary. Hmm, again, I'm not sure. I think the Articles didn't create a strong judiciary. The Constitution later established the federal courts. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D is negotiating treaties. That rings a bell. I remember that the national government under the Articles did have the power to negotiate treaties with other countries because that's a necessary function of a national government. So D might be correct.

Option E is enforcing its laws. I think the Articles had a problem here. The national government couldn't enforce laws because they didn't have their own army or the ability to levy taxes. They had to rely on the states, which often didn't comply. So E might not be a power they had.

Option F is directly electing the President. Wait, under the Articles, there was no President. The government was run by a Congress, and the executive functions were handled by committees. So F doesn't seem right.

Option G is implementing a federal education system. That sounds like something the federal government does today, but under the Articles, the national government didn't have that kind of control over education. States handled their own affairs.

So putting it together, the national government under the Articles could negotiate treaties. That was one of their limited but important powers. They couldn't enforce laws, regulate commerce, or abolish states. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: negotiate treaties. Under the Articles of Confederation, the national government had the power to negotiate treaties with other countries, which was one of its limited but significant functions. 

Answer: D
