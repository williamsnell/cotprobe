Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the amount of paint David needs is directly proportional to the surface area of a cube. He can cover a cube with side length 2 feet using exactly 16 quarts of paint. Now, the question is, how big a cube (in terms of edge length) can he cover with 169 quarts of paint?

Hmm, direct proportionality. Right, so if two things are directly proportional, it means that as one increases, the other increases by the same factor. So, if paint quantity is directly proportional to surface area, then Paint ∝ Surface Area. Which means Paint = k * Surface Area, where k is the constant of proportionality.

First, I should probably find the surface area of the cube David can cover with 16 quarts. A cube has 6 faces, each face being a square. The surface area (SA) of a cube is 6 times the area of one face. So for a cube with side length 's', SA = 6s².

Given that for the first cube, s = 2 feet. So SA = 6*(2)^2 = 6*4 = 24 square feet. And the paint used is 16 quarts.

So, Paint = k * SA. So 16 quarts = k * 24. I can solve for k here. K = 16 / 24, which simplifies to 2/3. So k = 2/3 quarts per square foot.

Now, the problem asks how big a cube he can cover with 169 quarts. Let's denote the edge length of the new cube as 'x'. The surface area of this new cube would be 6x².

Using the same proportionality, Paint = k * SA. So 169 = (2/3) * 6x².

Wait, let me compute that. 6x² multiplied by (2/3). Let me see: 6*(2/3) = (6*2)/3 = 12/3 = 4. So the equation becomes 169 = 4x².

Now, I can solve for x² by dividing both sides by 4: x² = 169 / 4. Taking the square root of both sides, x = sqrt(169/4) = sqrt(169)/sqrt(4) = 13/2.

So x is 13/2 feet. Let me check the options. Option B is 13/2, so that's the answer.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through it again.

First cube: side 2 ft. Surface area = 6*(2)^2=24 sq ft. Paint used:16 quarts. So k = 16/24 = 2/3. Correct.

Second cube: Paint = 169 quarts. So 169 = (2/3)*6x². Simplify 6*(2/3)=4. So 169=4x². Then x²=169/4. So x=13/2. Yep, that's right.

I think I got it right. The edge length is 13/2 feet, which is option B.
</think>

The amount of paint is directly proportional to the surface area of the cube. The surface area of a cube is 6 times the square of its edge length. For the initial cube with a side length of 2 feet, the surface area is 24 square feet, requiring 16 quarts of paint. The constant of proportionality (k) is found to be 2/3 quarts per square foot. For 169 quarts of paint, solving 169 = (2/3) * 6x² gives x = 13/2 feet.

Answer: B
