Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding the question and the given information.

The problem states that the government levies a lump-sum tax, which reduces disposable income by $50 billion. I need to determine the effect of this tax on NNP, which I think stands for Net National Product. I remember that in macroeconomics, taxes can affect consumption and, consequently, aggregate demand. 

First, I'll recall some basic concepts. Disposable income is the income that people have left after taxes. So if taxes go up by $50 billion, disposable income decreases by that same amount. Now, the question mentions the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS), which is given as 0.25. MPS is the fraction of additional income that people save. So if MPS is 0.25, that means people save 25% of their additional income and spend the rest, which would be the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) of 0.75, since MPC + MPS = 1.

Now, the next step is to figure out how a decrease in disposable income affects overall spending and, through that, the NNP. I think this involves the concept of the multiplier effect. The tax cut (or in this case, a tax increase) will lead to a change in consumption, which then leads to a change in aggregate demand, and thus a change in NNP.

The formula for the tax multiplier is: Tax Multiplier = - (MPC / (1 - MPC)). Alternatively, since MPS is given, and MPC = 1 - MPS, I can use that to find the multiplier. Let me compute that.

MPC = 1 - MPS = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.

So the tax multiplier would be - (0.75 / (1 - 0.75)) = - (0.75 / 0.25) = -3. The negative sign indicates that an increase in taxes (or a decrease in disposable income) will lead to a decrease in NNP.

But wait, the question is about a lump-sum tax, which is a specific type of tax. I remember that lump-sum taxes don't vary with income, so they affect everyone equally. However, in terms of the multiplier effect, the analysis remains the same because it's about the change in disposable income leading to a change in consumption.

So, the initial change in disposable income is a decrease of $50 billion. The tax multiplier is -3, so the total effect on NNP should be the initial change multiplied by the multiplier.

Let me calculate that: 50 billion * (-3) = -150 billion. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have -150. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing the sign. The question asks for the effect, so whether it's a decrease or increase. Since the tax is levied, it's a decrease in NNP, so the effect is a decrease of $150 billion. But looking at the options, option I is $150 billion. But wait, the options are phrased as "what effect will this have on NNP?" So if the tax reduces NNP by $150 billion, the effect is a decrease of $150 billion. Looking at the options, I see that option I is $150 billion, but I'm not sure if it's positive or negative. Wait, the options are just numbers without signs, so I think the answer is a decrease of $150 billion, so the effect is $150 billion lower.

Wait, but wait another moment. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. The formula for the tax multiplier is usually given as the change in taxes leading to a change in NNP. The formula is ΔY = - (MPC / (1 - MPC)) * ΔT. So ΔY is the change in NNP, and ΔT is the change in taxes. Here, ΔT is +50 billion because taxes are increased by $50 billion, which reduces disposable income by the same amount.

So ΔY = -3 * 50 = -150 billion. So NNP decreases by $150 billion. So the effect is a decrease of $150 billion. Looking at the options, option I is $150 billion, but is it a decrease or an increase? The options don't specify, but the question is asking for the effect, so the magnitude is $150 billion. So the correct answer should be option I: $150 billion.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Another approach is to consider the impact on consumption. When disposable income decreases by $50 billion, consumption decreases by MPC * ΔYd, which is 0.75 * 50 = $37.5 billion. Then, the decrease in consumption leads to a decrease in output, which is multiplied by the inverse of MPS. Wait, no, the multiplier is based on MPC. Let me think again.

The initial decrease in disposable income is $50 billion. The MPC is 0.75, so consumption decreases by 0.75 * 50 = 37.5 billion. This reduction in consumption leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, which in turn reduces production. The total effect is this initial decrease multiplied by the multiplier effect. The multiplier here is 1/(1 - MPC) = 1/0.25 = 4. So the total decrease in NNP would be 37.5 * 4 = 150 billion. So that confirms the earlier calculation.

Therefore, the effect on NNP is a decrease of $150 billion, which corresponds to option I.

The government imposes a lump-sum tax, reducing disposable income by $50 billion. With an MPS of 0.25, the MPC is 0.75. The tax multiplier is -3, leading to a decrease in NNP of $150 billion.
