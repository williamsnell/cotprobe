Okay, so I've got this question about frequency modulation and bandwidth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's start with part (a). 

Part (a) says: Determine the bandwidth of a frequency modulated waveform. The modulating signal is sinusoidal with a frequency of 3 kHz, and the frequency deviation is 5 kHz.

Wait, I remember that for frequency modulation, the bandwidth depends on the modulating frequency and the frequency deviation. Oh right, the bandwidth is given by the formula B = 2*(Δf + f_m), where Δf is the frequency deviation and f_m is the modulating frequency. Or wait, is it 2*(Δf + f_m) or 2*(Δf + 2f_m)? No, wait, I think it's actually 2*(Δf + f_m) because the maximum deviation is Δf above and below the carrier. So the total bandwidth is from carrier - Δf to carrier + Δf, which is a total of 2Δf, but wait, that's if there's no modulating signal. Wait, no, the modulating signal adds to the carrier, so the maximum frequency is f_c + Δf, and the minimum is f_c - Δf. But wait, no—actually, when you modulate, the carrier shifts up and down by Δf, and the modulating signal causes the carrier to vary. So the total bandwidth is 2*(Δf + f_m). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the correct formula for FM bandwidth is B = 2*(Δf + f_m). Or is it B = 2*Δf + 2*f_m? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct formula is B = 2*(Δf + f_m). Because the maximum frequency is f_c + (Δf + f_m), and the minimum is f_c - (Δf + f_m), so the total bandwidth is 2*(Δf + f_m). Let me check that. Alternatively, sometimes I've heard it as 2*(Δf + 2*f_m), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up with phase modulation or something else.

Wait, no, I think for FM, the maximum frequency deviation occurs when the modulating signal is at its peak. So the maximum frequency is f_c + Δf + f_m, and the minimum is f_c - Δf - f_m. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the modulating signal is a sine wave, so when it's at maximum, the frequency deviation adds to the carrier. So the maximum frequency is f_c + Δf + f_m? No, wait, that can't be right because f_m is the modulating frequency, not the amplitude. Oh, wait no, the modulating signal's amplitude affects the frequency deviation. So the frequency deviation is Δf, regardless of the modulating frequency. So the maximum frequency is f_c + (Δf), and the minimum is f_c - (Δf), but that's only if the modulating signal is zero. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the modulating signal is varying, so the carrier's frequency varies between f_c - Δf and f_c + Δf. So the total bandwidth is 2Δf. But wait, that's not considering the modulating frequency. Oh, wait, no, the modulating frequency affects the spacing of the sidebands. Or maybe I'm confusing this with amplitude modulation.

Wait, no, in FM, the bandwidth is determined by the maximum frequency deviation from the carrier. So the total bandwidth is from f_c - Δf to f_c + Δf, which is a total of 2Δf. But that can't be right because then the modulating frequency f_m wouldn't affect the bandwidth. But I remember that the bandwidth in FM is actually more than just 2Δf because the modulating signal's frequency also affects the spread of the sidebands. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with the formula for the number of sidebands. Oh right, in AM, the bandwidth is 2*fc, but in FM, it's different.

Wait, I think the correct formula for bandwidth in FM is B = 2*(Δf + f_m). Or is it B = 2Δf + 2f_m? Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. When you have a sinusoidal modulating signal with frequency f_m, the FM waveform has a carrier and sidebands at frequencies f_c ± (Δf ± n*f_m), where n is an integer. So the maximum frequency deviation is Δf, but the sidebands spread out based on f_m. So the total bandwidth is from f_c - (Δf + f_m) to f_c + (Δf + f_m), which makes the bandwidth 2*(Δf + f_m). So yes, that's the formula.

So for part (a), f_m is 3 kHz, Δf is 5 kHz. So B = 2*(5 +3) = 2*8 =16 kHz. Wait, but wait, no, the formula is 2*(Δf + f_m), so 2*(5 +3)=16 kHz. But looking at the options, let's see.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 20 and 15, D is 18 and14, etc. Hmm, but according to this, part (a) would be 16 kHz, but that's not an option in the first part of any option. Wait, the options are pairs. So option G is 16 and 13, which would mean part (a) is 16. So that's possible.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the bandwidth in FM is often approximated as 2Δf, but perhaps that's when f_m is much smaller than Δf. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me double-check. In FM, the instantaneous frequency varies between f_c and f_c + Δf when the modulating signal is at maximum. But the modulating signal has a frequency f_m, so the sidebands are spaced at intervals of f_m. Wait, but the bandwidth is the total range of frequencies occupied, which would be from the lowest to the highest. The lowest would be f_c - (Δf + f_m), and the highest would be f_c + (Δf + f_m). So the total bandwidth is 2*(Δf + f_m). So yes, that's correct.

So for part (a), 2*(5+3) =16 kHz.

Now part (b): What's the new bandwidth if the modulating frequency is increased to 4 kHz and the amplitude is decreased by a factor of 2. Hmm, but wait, does the amplitude affect the frequency deviation? Because frequency deviation in FM depends on the amplitude of the modulating signal. The formula for frequency deviation Δf is (k_f * A_m)/ (2π), where A_m is the amplitude of the modulating signal. So if the amplitude is decreased by a factor of 2, then Δf would also decrease by a factor of 2. Because Δf is proportional to A_m.

So in part (b), f_m is now 4 kHz, and Δf is 5 kHz /2 = 2.5 kHz.

So the new bandwidth would be 2*(Δf + f_m) = 2*(2.5 +4) = 2*6.5 =13 kHz.

So for part (a), 16 kHz, part (b) 13 kHz. Looking at the options, option G is 16 and 13. So that's the answer.

The bandwidth of a frequency-modulated (FM) waveform is determined by the formula:

\[
B = 2(\Delta f + f_m)
\]

where \( \Delta f \) is the frequency deviation and \( f_m \) is the modulating signal frequency.

### Part (a)
Given:
- \( f_m = 3 \, \text{kHz} \)
- \( \Delta f = 5 \, \text{kHz} \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
B = 2(5 + 3) = 2 \times 8 = 16 \, \text{kHz}
\]

Thus, the bandwidth for part (a) is **16 kHz**.

---

### Part (b)
The modulating frequency is increased to \( f_m = 4 \, \text{kHz} \), and the amplitude of the modulating signal is decreased by a factor of 2. Since the frequency deviation \( \Delta f \) is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal, the new frequency deviation is:

\[
\Delta f_{\text{new}} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{kHz}
\]

Substituting into the bandwidth formula:

\[
B_{\text{new}} = 2(2.5 + 4) = 2 \times 6.5 = 13 \, \text{kHz}
\]

Thus, the bandwidth for part (b) is **13 kHz**.

---

### Final Answer
The bandwidths for parts (a) and (b) are **16 kHz** and **13 kHz**, respectively. This corresponds to **Option G**.
