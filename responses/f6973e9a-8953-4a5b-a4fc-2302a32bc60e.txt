Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about algorithms and their time complexities. Let's think through this step by step.

The question is asking which algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²) but an average-case time complexity of Θ(n log n). The options are from A to J, each representing a different sorting algorithm.

First, I should recall the time complexities of each algorithm mentioned in the options.

Let's list them out:

A: Counting Sort – I remember that Counting Sort is a linear time algorithm, O(n), because it's a non-comparison sort. It works by counting occurrences and reconstructing the sorted array. So its time complexity is O(n + k), where k is the range. So it's definitely not Θ(n²) in worst case.

B: Shell Sort – I'm a bit fuzzy on Shell Sort. If I remember correctly, Shell Sort is a generalization of Insertion Sort that allows the exchange of elements that are far apart. The worst-case time complexity depends on the gap sequence used. For example, using the Knuth sequence, the worst case is O(n log² n). But some implementations might have higher complexities. However, the average case is typically better than Insertion Sort, maybe around O(n log n). Wait, but I'm not sure if it's exactly Θ(n log n) on average. I might need to think more about this.

C: Insertion Sort – Insertion Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²) because, in the worst case (like a reverse sorted array), each element has to be compared and moved one by one. The average case is also O(n²), but maybe sometimes it's better? No, I think on average it's still O(n²) because even in average cases, it's not significantly better. So this might not fit the question since the average case is not Θ(n log n).

D: Bubblesort – Similar to Insertion Sort, Bubblesort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²). The average case is also O(n²), so it's not the right answer.

E: Mergesort – Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Its worst-case time complexity is O(n log n), and the average case is also O(n log n). So this doesn't fit because the worst case is not Θ(n²).

F: Selection Sort – Selection Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²) because it has to scan the array n times to find the minimum each time. The average case is also O(n²), so this isn't the answer either.

G: Bucket Sort – Bucket Sort works by distributing elements into buckets and then sorting each bucket. Its average-case time complexity is O(n), assuming the input is uniformly distributed. However, in the worst case, if all elements go into one bucket, it becomes O(n²). But the average isn't Θ(n log n), so this isn't the right choice.

H: Radix Sort – Radix Sort, like Counting Sort, is a non-comparison sort. It sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits. The time complexity is O(nk), where k is the number of digits. So it's not Θ(n²) in the worst case.

I: Quicksort – Quicksort's worst-case time complexity is O(n²), which happens when the pivot selection is poor (like always picking the first or last element). However, on average, Quicksort has a time complexity of O(n log n) because the partitioning tends to be balanced. So this fits the description: worst case Θ(n²), average case Θ(n log n).

J: Heapsort – Heapsort has both worst-case and average-case time complexities of O(n log n). It's a comparison sort that uses a binary heap. So Heapsort doesn't fit because the worst case isn't Θ(n²).

Wait, but wait about Shell Sort (option B). I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that Shell Sort's worst-case time complexity is O(n log² n) with certain gap sequences, like the ones used by Donald Shell. But I've also heard that some implementations can have higher complexities. For example, if the gap sequence is not chosen well, it might approach O(n²). However, the average case is better than Insertion Sort, often around O(n log n). So could it be that Shell Sort's average is Θ(n log n) while the worst is Θ(n²)? I'm a bit confused because I thought the worst case for Shell Sort is better than O(n²), but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific variant of Shell Sort that has a worst-case O(n²). But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, Quicksort (I) definitely has worst-case O(n²) and average O(n log n). So Quicksort is a clear candidate. 

Wait, the question is about the worst case being Θ(n²) but average Θ(n log n). So Quicksort fits that. 

So the answer should be I: Quicksort.

The algorithm that has a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²) but an average-case time complexity of Θ(n log n) is Quicksort.
