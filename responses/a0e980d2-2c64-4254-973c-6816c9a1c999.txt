Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Given that P(E) = 0.32, P(F) = 0.15, and P(E ∩ F) = 0.048, which of the following is a correct conclusion? And there are options from A to J.

Hmm. I remember that for two events, E and F, their independence and whether they're mutually exclusive can be determined using their probabilities and the probability of their intersection.

First, let's tackle mutual exclusivity. Mutually exclusive events can't happen at the same time, which means that P(E ∩ F) should be zero. But here, P(E ∩ F) is 0.048, which isn't zero. So that means E and F are not mutually exclusive. Wait, right, because if they were, the intersection would be zero. So that rules out any options that say they're mutually exclusive. Let me look at the options again.

Options A: mutually exclusive but not independent. Well, since they're not mutually exclusive, A is out.

Option B: mutually exclusive and probabilities equal. Again, mutual exclusivity is no, so B is out.

Option E: dependent and mutually exclusive. Also, mutual exclusivity is no, so E is out.

Option F: independent but mutually exclusive. No, same reason as above.

Option J: both independent and mutually exclusive. No, mutual exclusivity is no.

So that leaves us with options C, D, G, H, I. Wait, no, let's see the options again.

Wait the options are A through J. Let me list them again:

A: mutually exclusive, not independent.

B: mutually exclusive, equal probabilities.

C: independent and equal.

D: dependent, not mutually exclusive.

E: dependent, mutually exclusive.

F: independent, mutually exclusive.

G: neither independent nor mutually exclusive.

H: independent, not mutually exclusive.

I: neither dependent nor mutually exclusive.

J: both independent and mutually exclusive.

Wait, so the events are not mutually exclusive because P(E ∩ F) isn't zero. So any option that says they're mutually exclusive is wrong. So that leaves options D, G, H, I, and C.

Wait, but let's check for independence. Two events are independent if P(E ∩ F) = P(E) * P(F). So let's compute P(E)*P(F) and see if it equals 0.048.

P(E) is 0.32, P(F) is 0.15. Multiplying those gives 0.32 * 0.15. Let me calculate that: 0.32 * 0.15. 0.3 * 0.1 is 0.03, 0.02 * 0.1 is 0.002, so 0.03 + 0.002 is 0.032? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.32 * 0.15.

Let me compute it properly. 32 * 15 = 480. So 0.32 * 0.15 = 0.048. Oh wait, that's exactly the P(E ∩ F) given, which is 0.048. So that means P(E ∩ F) equals P(E) * P(F). So the events E and F are independent.

Wait, but earlier I thought they were not mutually exclusive because P(E ∩ F) isn't zero. So now I have that they are independent but not mutually exclusive.

Wait, so looking back at the options, which option says that?

Option H: independent but not mutually exclusive.

Option C: independent and their probabilities are equal. But P(E) is 0.32 and P(F) is 0.15, which are not equal. So C is incorrect.

Option D: dependent, not mutually exclusive. But they are independent, so D is wrong.

Option G: neither independent nor mutually exclusive. But since they are independent, G is incorrect.

Option H: independent, not mutually exclusive. That fits.

Option I: neither dependent nor mutually exclusive. But they are independent, so I is wrong.

So the correct conclusion is that E and F are independent and not mutually exclusive. Which is option H.
</think>

The events E and F are independent because P(E ∩ F) equals P(E) * P(F) (0.048 = 0.32 * 0.15). They are not mutually exclusive since P(E ∩ F) ≠ 0. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the events are independent but not mutually exclusive.
