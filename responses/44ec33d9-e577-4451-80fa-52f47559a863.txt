Question:

If a test has a standard error of measurement of 15 points, itis correct to conclude that

Options:

A: about 85% of the observed scores for the test population lie within 15 points of the mean score
B: differences of up to 15 points represent the same true score
C: about 68% of the individuals with a given cure score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score
D: about 68% of the observed scores for the test population lie within 15 points of the mean score
E: about 68% of the observed scores for the test population lie within 30 points of the mean score
F: about 68% of the observed scores will lie between 15 points below and above the true score
G: about 32% of the individuals with a given cure score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score
H: about 15% of the individuals with a given score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score
I: differences of up to 30 points represent the same true score
J: about 15% of the scores are in error (i.e., they are not measuring the trait reliably)

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the standard error of measurement, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

The standard error of measurement (SEM) is a statistic that indicates how much observed scores might deviate from a true score. It's related to the concept of reliability in tests. I remember that SEM is calculated using the standard deviation of the test scores and the reliability coefficient. The formula, if I'm not mistaken, is SEM = SD * sqrt(1 - r), where SD is the standard deviation and r is the reliability.

Now, the question states that the SEM is 15 points. So, what does that mean? I think it means that, on average, observed scores can be expected to deviate from the true score by about 15 points. But the options are about percentages and ranges around the mean or true score.

Looking at the options:

Option A says about 85% of observed scores lie within 15 points of the mean. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I remember that in normal distributions, about 68% of data lies within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. Wait, but SEM is about the standard error, which relates to the standard deviation of the errors. So maybe it's similar to the standard deviation in this context.

Option B says differences of up to 15 points represent the same true score. That makes sense because if the SEM is 15, a difference of 15 could be due to measurement error, so two scores might be considered the same if they're within that range. But the question is about what conclusion is correct, so I'm not sure if this is the best answer.

Option C talks about 68% of individuals with a given true score having observed scores within 15 points. Wait, that seems related to the concept of the SEM. Because SEM tells us that about 68% of observed scores should be within one SEM of the true score. So for each individual, there's a 68% chance their observed score is within 15 points of their true score. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking.

Option D says about 68% of observed scores lie within 15 points of the mean. That sounds like it's talking about the mean, but wait, I thought SEM is about the true score, not the mean. The mean is just the average of all observed scores, while the true score is an individual's actual level. So maybe D is incorrect because it's about the mean, not the true score.

Option E is similar to D but mentions 30 points. Since 30 is twice the SEM, that would correspond to two standard errors, which would cover about 95% of the data. So E is probably incorrect as it's using the wrong range for 68%.

Option F says about 68% of observed scores lie between 15 points below and above the true score. That seems correct because, as I thought earlier, SEM is about how much observed scores can vary from the true score. So 68% should be within one SEM, which is 15 points here.

Option G is about 32% within 15 points, which doesn't make sense because 68% is the typical figure, so G is likely wrong.

Option H says 15% within 15 points, which is way off. That's not matching any standard percentages I know.

Option I is about differences of up to 30 points representing the same true score. That would be two SEMs, which would cover 95% of the data, so I think I is incorrect.

Option J says about 15% of scores are in error. That's not directly related to SEM. SEM is about the average error, not the proportion of errors.

So, going back, the key points: SEM tells us about the spread of observed scores around the true score. In a normal distribution, 68% of data is within one standard deviation. So if SEM is 15, then 68% of observed scores should be within 15 points of the true score. That points to option F.

Looking again at the options, option F is exactly that: about 68% of the observed scores will lie between 15 points below and above the true score. So that's correct.

Wait, but I also thought about option D. Option D talks about the mean, but SEM is about the true score. So D is incorrect because it's referring to the mean, not the true score. The correct interpretation is about how observed scores relate to the true score, not the mean.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F.
</think>

The standard error of measurement (SEM) indicates how much observed scores can deviate from the true score. With an SEM of 15 points, about 68% of observed scores are expected to lie within 15 points of the true score. This corresponds to option F, which correctly states that about 68% of the observed scores will lie between 15 points below and above the true score.

Answer: F
