Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about an ideal gas experiment. The question is about plotting volume against temperature and determining the slope and y-intercept of the graph. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for an ideal gas, the behavior is described by the ideal gas law: PV = nRT. In this experiment, temperature is the independent variable (so it's on the x-axis), and volume is the dependent variable (on the y-axis). So the graph we're looking at is Volume (V) vs. Temperature (T).

Wait, no, actually, the question says the dependent variable is on the vertical axis, which is volume, so the plot is Volume (V) on the y-axis and Temperature (T) on the x-axis. That makes sense because the experiment varies the temperature and measures the resulting volume.

Now, I need to recall how the ideal gas law applies here. Since the problem mentions it's an ideal gas, I assume pressure (P) and the number of moles (n) are constant, right? Because if they were changing, the problem would mention that. So, assuming P and n are constant, the equation simplifies. Let's see:

PV = nRT → V = (nR/P)T. Oh, this looks like a linear equation in terms of T, where V is the dependent variable. So when we plot V on the y-axis and T on the x-axis, the graph should be a straight line.

In the equation V = (nR/P)T, the slope would be (nR/P), which is a constant because n and R are constants (R is the gas constant), and P is the pressure, which we can assume is constant for this experiment. So the slope is directly proportional to 1/P, because (nR/P) = (nR) * (1/P). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, nR is a constant, so (nR)/P would make the slope inversely proportional to P if P is varying. But in this case, since P is constant (as we're assuming n and P are constant for the experiment), the slope is simply a constant value.

Wait, no, the question is about how the slope relates to the variables. So the slope is (nR)/P. Since P is constant, the slope is a fixed value. So the slope is directly proportional to 1/P. Because if P increases, slope decreases, and vice versa. So the slope is inversely proportional to the pressure.

Now, what about the y-intercept? The equation is V = (nR/P) T. When T is zero, V would be zero. So the y-intercept is zero. Because when T=0, V=0. That makes sense because if the temperature is absolute zero, the volume should be zero for an ideal gas.

So putting this together, the graph of V vs T is a straight line through the origin (y-intercept is 0), and the slope is (nR)/P, which depends on pressure. So the slope is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas, and the intercept is zero.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the slope is inversely proportional to the pressure and the intercept is 0. That matches what I concluded.

Wait, let me check other options to be sure. Option A says slope is linearly proportional to pressure. No, because slope is (nR)/P, so it's inversely proportional. Option B says slope inversely proportional to volume, which doesn't make sense because the equation doesn't involve volume in the slope. Option C mentions the intercept isn't zero, but we know it is. So F seems correct.

The correct answer is F: The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m³.

F
