Okay, so I've got this question about circuits, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me break it down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on this topic.

The question lists three statements (I, II, III) and asks which are true. The options are combinations of these statements. Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement I: Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not. Hmm, wait. I remember that combinational circuits are built from logic gates and their outputs depend solely on the current inputs. They don't have any feedback loops because that would introduce memory, which is a characteristic of sequential circuits. So, if combinational circuits can have feedback, that would mean they have some memory, which doesn't make sense. I think statement I is false because combinational circuits don't have feedback; that's the job of sequential circuits like flip-flops.

Statement II: Combinational circuits have a "memoryless" property; sequential circuits do not. This sounds familiar. Combinational circuits don't remember previous inputs, so their output is only based on the current inputs. That's the memoryless property. Sequential circuits, on the other hand, do have memory because they use feedback to remember past states. So statement II is true.

Statement III: Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock. Wait, do combinational circuits need a clock? I think they don't. Combinational circuits operate based on the input changes; they don't require a clock signal. It's the sequential circuits that use a clock to synchronize their operations, like in synchronous circuits. So statement III is false because only sequential circuits need a clock. Combinational circuits don't necessarily require a clock; they can be part of asynchronous circuits as well.

Now, let's recap:

I: False
II: True
III: False

Looking at the options, I need to find which combination corresponds to only statement II being true. Let's check the options:

A: II and III → III is false, so A is incorrect.
B: I and III → Both are false, so B is wrong.
C: I and II → I is false, so C is wrong.
D: I only → I is false, so D is wrong.
E: None of the above → Wait, because II is true, E can't be right.
F: II only → This matches our analysis, because only II is true.
G: I, II, III → All are false except II, so G is wrong.
H: All of the above → Nope.
I: II and III → III is false, so I is wrong.
J: III only → III is false, so J is wrong.

So the correct option is F: II only.

The correct answer is F because only statement II is true. 

Answer: F
