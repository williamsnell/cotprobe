Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about an experiment that Jared is conducting. The question is asking about the independent variable in his experiment. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is really about. Jared thinks that attending psychology lectures is a waste of time. He believes that you can do just as well by reading a review book, watching "Discovering Psychology," and taking the tests. So he's testing his hypothesis with an experiment. The question is about identifying the independent variable in this experiment.

Wait, what's an independent variable again? From what I remember, in an experiment, the independent variable is the one that the experimenter manipulates or changes to see if it affects the outcome. It's the cause in the cause-effect relationship. The dependent variable is what is being measured, the effect.

So in this case, Jared is testing whether attending lectures is necessary or not. He's comparing two groups: one group that attends lectures and another that doesn't. But wait, no, actually, maybe he's testing his own approach. Let me think again.

He thinks that not going to lectures but instead reading the review book, watching the show, and taking tests will result in the same performance as attending lectures. So perhaps he's comparing two groups: one group that attends lectures normally, and another group that doesn't attend but uses the other methods. Or maybe he's just trying different methods himself and seeing which works better.

Wait, the way the question is phrased, Jared is testing his hypothesis by conducting an experiment. So he's probably manipulating whether he attends lectures or not, and seeing how that affects his test scores.

So, in his experiment, the independent variable would be the variable he changes (whether he goes to lectures or not). The dependent variable would be his test scores, which are the outcome he measures.

Looking at the options, the independent variable is the one that's being manipulated. So let me look at the options:

Option A: just taking tests. Hmm, that doesn't sound right because taking tests is part of the dependent variable, not what he's changing.

Option B: going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology." That seems like a combination of actions, but I'm not sure if that's the independent variable. Maybe not, because the independent variable should be the factor being tested.

Option C: going to lecture classes and watching the show. Again, that's a combination, but perhaps not the main factor.

Option D: not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology." So this is the alternative method Jared is trying. So maybe the independent variable is whether he attends lectures or uses this alternative method. But the way the question is phrased, the experiment is about whether attending lectures is necessary. So perhaps the independent variable is attending lectures or not attending.

Wait, but in the options, the independent variable is presented as the factor being manipulated. So if Jared is testing his hypothesis that attending lectures is unnecessary, he might be comparing two groups: one that attends lectures and another that doesn't. But in the question, it's phrased as his own experiment, perhaps a single-subject experiment where he alternates between attending and not attending.

But the way the question is phrased, it's about his approach. He's trying the alternative method (not attending but using the other resources) and seeing if it works. So the independent variable is whether he attends lectures or not.

Wait, but the options don't directly say that. Let's look again.

Option D: not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology." So that's the alternative approach. So perhaps in his experiment, he's changing whether he goes to lectures or uses the other methods. So the independent variable is whether he attends lectures or uses the other methods.

Wait, but the question says the independent variable is the variable he manipulates. So if he's testing whether attending lectures is a waste of time, he's probably comparing attending vs. not attending. So the independent variable would be attending vs. not attending.

But looking at the options, the only option that refers to attending is E: going to lecture classes, and D: not going to lecture classes, etc.

Wait, but the options are giving the possible independent variables. So the independent variable is the one he manipulates. So if he's testing whether attending lectures is necessary, he would have two groups: one attends lectures, the other doesn't. So the independent variable is whether they attend or not.

But in the options, the only one that refers to attending is E. But wait, option D is about not attending and using other methods. So perhaps the independent variable is the method used: attending lectures (control group) vs. not attending and using the alternative methods (experimental group). So the independent variable would be the method, which is attending or not attending.

But looking at the options, the independent variable is what he's changing. So if he's changing whether he attends lectures, that's the independent variable. So the options would be either attending or not attending.

Wait, but in the options, the independent variable is presented as the thing he's changing. So if he's testing whether attending is necessary, the independent variable is attending vs. not attending.

Looking at the options, the one that represents attending is E: going to lecture classes. But wait, that's just one condition. The independent variable is the factor that's manipulated, which in this case is attending or not. So perhaps the correct option is D, which is not going to lecture classes and using the other methods. Because he's testing the alternative approach, so the independent variable is whether he attends or not.

Wait, but the question says the independent variable is the one he manipulates. So if he's not attending and using the other methods, that's the treatment. So the independent variable is whether he goes to lectures or not. So the options are E: going to lecture classes (which is one condition) and D: not going, but that's the treatment.

Wait, but the independent variable is the factor that is changed, so in this case, it's whether he attends lectures or not. So the options would be something like that. Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D: not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology."

Wait, but the independent variable is the factor that is manipulated. So if Jared is testing whether attending lectures is unnecessary, he would have two groups: one that attends, and one that doesn't. So the independent variable is attending or not. So the options should reflect that. But looking at the options, none directly say attending vs not. So perhaps the way it's phrased is that the independent variable is the method used, which is attending vs using the other methods.

Wait, perhaps the independent variable is the method, which is either attending lectures or using the alternative methods. So the independent variable is attending lectures vs not attending and using the other methods.

In that case, the independent variable is the approach taken, which is attending lectures or using the alternative. So the options would be either E or D.

Wait, but the options are phrased as the independent variable, so the correct answer is the one that represents the method being tested. So if Jared is testing whether attending lectures is necessary, the independent variable is attending lectures or not. So the options would be E: going to lecture classes, which is the control group, and D: not going, which is the experimental group.

But the question is asking for the independent variable in his experiment, so it's the factor he's changing. So if he's comparing attending and not attending, the independent variable is whether he attends lectures or not.

But looking at the options, the one that represents not attending and using the alternative is D. So the independent variable would be D: not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology."

Wait, but that might not be correct. Because the independent variable should be a single variable, not a combination of actions. So perhaps the independent variable is attending lectures (E) or not attending (D). But in the options, the independent variable is the treatment, so perhaps the correct answer is D: not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology."

Wait, but that seems like a combination of variables. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

In an experiment, the independent variable is what you change. Jared is testing whether attending lectures is unnecessary. So he's changing whether he attends lectures or not. So the independent variable is attending lectures vs not attending.

But looking at the options, the only options that refer to attending are E and D. E is attending, D is not attending and using other methods.

Wait, but the independent variable is the factor being manipulated, which is attending or not. So perhaps the options are structured differently. Let me read the question again.

The question is: The independent variable in his experiment is...

So Jared is testing his hypothesis by comparing two methods: one where he goes to lectures, reads the book, watches the show, and takes tests (the traditional way), versus another where he doesn't go to lectures but still reads the book, watches the show, and takes tests.

Wait, no, the question says he thinks that just reading the review book, watching the show, and taking tests is enough. So he's not going to lectures. So perhaps his experiment is to see if he can get the same results without attending lectures. So the independent variable is attending vs not attending.

But the options don't have a simple 'attending' as the variable. Let me look again.

Option E is going to lecture classes. Option D is not going and using the other methods. So perhaps the independent variable is whether he attends lectures or not. So the options would be either E or D.

Wait, but in the experiment, the independent variable is the one that is manipulated. So if Jared is not attending, then the independent variable is not attending, which is D.

But I'm a bit confused because the independent variable should be the factor that is changed, which in this case is attending or not. So perhaps the correct answer is D because that's the condition he's testing (not attending and using the alternative methods).

Wait, but the independent variable is the factor being manipulated. So in this case, it's attending lectures (E) vs not attending and using other methods (D). But the question is asking for the independent variable, so it's the one he's changing. So if he's testing whether not attending works, then the independent variable is not attending, which is D.

Alternatively, maybe the independent variable is the alternative method, which includes not attending, reading, and watching. So the correct answer would be D.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think of it another way. The independent variable is what the experimenter changes to see if it affects the outcome. In this case, Jared is changing whether he attends lectures. So the independent variable is attending vs not attending.

Looking at the options, the one that represents not attending is D. So the independent variable is D: not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology."

Wait, but that's a combination of actions, not just attending or not. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the independent variable is the method of studying: attending lectures (control group) vs not attending and using other methods (experimental group). So the independent variable is the method, which would include both attending and not attending. But the options don't present it that way.

Wait, the options are singular, so perhaps the independent variable is attending lectures, which is E. Because he's testing whether attending is necessary, so he's changing that variable.

No, that doesn't make sense because he's not attending, so the independent variable is not attending. I think I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another approach: in an experiment, the independent variable is the one that is controlled and varied by the experimenter. So Jared is varying whether he attends lectures. So the independent variable is attending lectures (yes or no). So the options would be E (attending) or D (not attending).

But looking at the options, E is just attending, D is not attending plus other actions.

Wait, perhaps the independent variable is the treatment condition. So the treatment is not attending and using the other methods, which is D.

Yes, that makes sense. Because he's testing the hypothesis by using the alternative method, so the independent variable is that method, which is D.
</think>

The question asks for the independent variable in Jared's experiment. The independent variable is the factor that Jared manipulates to test his hypothesis. Jared is testing whether attending psychology lectures is necessary for success in the course. He believes that not attending lectures but instead reading the review book, watching "Discovering Psychology," and taking tests will yield the same results. 

In this context, the independent variable is the method Jared is testing, which involves not attending lectures and using the alternative methods (reading the review book and watching the show). This represents the treatment condition in his experiment. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching "Discovering Psychology."**

Answer: D
