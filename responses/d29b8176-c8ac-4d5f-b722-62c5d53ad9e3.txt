Okay, so I've got this problem about vapor pressure and calculating the heat of vaporization. Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure has to do with how much a liquid evaporates at a given temperature. The question mentions a plot of lnP vs 1/T resulting in a straight line. Oh right, that's the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates vapor pressure and temperature. 

The equation, if I recall correctly, is ln P = -ΔH_vap / R * (1/T) + C, where C is the constant. So plotting ln P against 1/T gives a straight line, and the slope of that line is -ΔH_vap / R. 

Wait, but the problem says that when the straight line is extrapolated to infinite temperature, the pressure is 10^5 atm. Infinite temperature would mean 1/T approaches zero, so ln P approaches the y-intercept, which is C. So at infinite T, ln P = C, and P would be e^C. But the given pressure at infinite T is 10^5 atm. So, e^C = 10^5 atm. Therefore, C = ln(10^5 atm). 

But wait, the equation is ln P = (-ΔH_vap/R)(1/T) + ln(P0), where P0 is the pressure at T approaching infinity. Since P0 is given as 10^5 atm, the y-intercept C is ln(10^5 atm). 

But wait, the plot is ln P vs 1/T. The slope is -ΔH_vap/R. So if I can find the slope, I can calculate ΔH_vap. But how? Because the plot is given, but we don't have the slope. Oh wait, but maybe we can find it using the information provided.

Wait, the normal boiling point is 27°C. That's the temperature at which the vapor pressure P equals 1 atm. So at T = 27°C, which is 300 K (because 27 + 273.15≈300), P is 1 atm. So this point (1/T, ln P) would be on the line. 

So, let's plug in T=300 K and P=1 atm into the equation. 

ln(1) = (-ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) + ln(10^5)

But ln(1) is 0, so 0 = (-ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) + ln(10^5). 

Solving for ΔH_vap: 

(-ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) = - ln(10^5)

Multiply both sides by -300 R:

ΔH_vap = [ln(10^5)] * 300 R

Wait, wait. Let's make sure of the signs. The equation is:

0 = (-ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) + ln(1e5)

So, moving terms:

(ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) = ln(1e5)

Multiply both sides by 300 R:

ΔH_vap = ln(1e5) * 300 * R

What's R in appropriate units? R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K. But the answer options are in kcal. Oh, right, because 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. So 1 kcal is 4184 J. 

So R in cal/(mol·K) is 8.314 J/mol·K divided by 4.184 J/(cal). Let me calculate that: 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Let's approximate it as 2 cal/(mol·K) for simplicity, but maybe I should be precise. Alternatively, I can compute using J and then convert to kcal.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute ln(1e5). 1e5 is 10^5, so ln(10^5) = 5 * ln(10). Ln(10) is approximately 2.302585. So 5 * 2.302585 ≈ 11.512925.

So ln(1e5) ≈ 11.5129.

Then, ΔH_vap = 11.5129 * 300 K * R.

What's R? R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So:

ΔH_vap = 11.5129 * 300 * 8.314 J/mol

Let me compute that:

11.5129 * 300 = 3453.87

3453.87 * 8.314 ≈ let's see:

3453.87 * 8 = 27630.96

3453.87 * 0.314 ≈ approx 3453.87 * 0.3 = 1036.16, and 3453.87 *0.014≈48.354. So total 1036.16 +48.354≈1084.514.

So total ≈ 27630.96 + 1084.514 ≈ 28715.47 J/mol.

Wait, but wait, because 3453.87 *8.314 is better computed as:

3453.87 *8 =27630.96

3453.87 *0.3=1036.161

3453.87 *0.014=48.35418

Adding all: 27630.96 +1036.161=28667.121 +48.354=28715.475 J/mol.

So 28715 J/mol is the ΔH_vap in J/mol.

Convert to kcal/mol: since 1 kcal = 4184 J, 

ΔH_vap = 28715.475 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 6.855 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 6.855 kcal. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, another approach: the equation is ln P = (-ΔH_vap/(R)) * (1/T) + ln(P0)

At T = 300 K, P =1 atm. So:

ln(1) = (-ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) + ln(1e5)

So 0 = (-ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) + ln(1e5)

=> (ΔH_vap/R)(1/300) = ln(1e5)

=> ΔH_vap = ln(1e5)*300*R

Yes, that's correct. So substituting R as 8.314 J/mol·K, we get:

ΔH_vap = 11.5129 * 300 *8.314 = ?

Wait, 11.5129 *300 = 3453.87

3453.87 *8.314 = let me compute more accurately:

3453.87 *8 = 27630.96

3453.87 *0.3 = 1036.161

3453.87 *0.014 = 48.35418

Adding: 27630.96 +1036.161=28667.121 +48.35418=28715.475 J/mol.

So 28715.475 J/mol is 28.715475 kJ/mol.

Now, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, so 28.715475 kJ /4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ let's compute:

4.184 *6.8 = 28.4272

4.184 *6.85= 28.4272 + (0.05 *4.184)= 28.4272 +0.2092=28.6364

4.184 *6.855=28.6364 + (0.005 *4.184)=28.6364 +0.02092=28.65732

But our value is 28.715475, which is a bit higher than 28.65732. So 6.855 kcal is approximately 28.715 kJ. That makes sense.

So the answer is I: 6.855 kcal.

To calculate the heat of vaporization (ΔH_vap) of the liquid, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates vapor pressure (P) and temperature (T) as:

\[
\ln P = -\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{T} + \ln P_0
\]

Here, \(P_0\) is the vapor pressure at infinite temperature, which is given as \(10^5\) atm. The normal boiling point is 27°C (300 K), where the vapor pressure \(P = 1\) atm. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
\ln(1) = -\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{300} + \ln(10^5)
\]

Since \(\ln(1) = 0\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
-\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{300} = -\ln(10^5)
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{300} = \ln(10^5)
\]

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \ln(10^5) \cdot 300 \cdot R
\]

The gas constant \(R\) is \(8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\). First, calculate \(\ln(10^5)\):

\[
\ln(10^5) = 5 \cdot \ln(10) \approx 5 \cdot 2.302585 = 11.5129
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 11.5129 \cdot 300 \cdot 8.314 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 28715.475 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

Convert to kilocalories (1 kcal = 4184 J):

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{28715.475}{4184} \approx 6.855 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

Thus, the heat of vaporization is **6.855 kcal/mol**, corresponding to option I.
