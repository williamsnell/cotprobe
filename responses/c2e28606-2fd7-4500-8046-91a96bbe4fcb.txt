Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about symbolizing a sentence in propositional logic (PL). The sentence given is: "If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll."

First, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. The structure looks like a conditional statement. The "if" part is the antecedent, and the "then" part is the consequent. So, the sentence is of the form "If A, then B," where A is "either George enrolls or Harry enrolls," and B is "Ira does not enroll."

Now, in propositional logic, "if A then B" is represented as A → B, or using the implication operator. So, I need to translate both A and B into logical expressions.

Let's assign propositional variables:
- Let G represent "George enrolls."
- Let H represent "Harry enrolls."
- Let I represent "Ira enrolls."

So, A is "either George enrolls or Harry enrolls." That translates to G ∨ H (G OR H). 

B is "Ira does not enroll," which is the negation of I. So, that's ~I.

Putting it together, the entire sentence is (G ∨ H) → ~I. So, the formula should represent this implication.

Now, looking at the options provided, I need to find which one matches (G ∨ H) → ~I. Let's go through each option.

Option A: (G ∨ H) ∨ ~I. This looks like an OR of two disjuncts: (G OR H) OR (~I). That would mean either George or Harry enroll, or Ira doesn't enroll. But the original sentence is a conditional, not a disjunction. So this doesn't seem right.

Option B: (G ⊃ H) ∨ ~I. Here, G implies H, and then OR ~I. So it's saying if G then H, or Ira doesn't enroll. This doesn't match our structure because the antecedent is "either G or H," not G implying H.

Option C: (G ⊃ ~H) ∨ I. This is if G then not H, or I. Doesn't fit because the antecedent is about G or H, not G implying anything about H.

Option D: (G ∨ H) ∨ I. Again, this is a disjunction. Either G or H, or I. Doesn't represent the conditional structure.

Option E: (G ⊃ H) ∨ I. If G then H, or I. Not matching our structure.

Option F: (G ∨ I) ⊃ ~H. If either G or I, then not H. Doesn't fit because the antecedent is G or H, not G or I.

Option G: (G ∨ H) ⊃ ~I. This looks correct. The antecedent is G OR H, and the consequent is ~I. So this is exactly the structure we're looking for.

Option H: (G ⊃ I) ∨ H. If G implies I, or H. Doesn't match.

Option I: (G ∨ H) ⊃ I. If G or H, then I. But our consequent is ~I, so this is the opposite.

Option J: (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ I. If G or not H, then I. Again, not matching.

So, the correct formula is option G: (G ∨ H) ⊃ ~I. It correctly captures the conditional relationship where if either George or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.

The correct symbolization is (G ∨ H) → ~I, which corresponds to option G.
