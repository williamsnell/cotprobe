Question:

After weeks of deliberation, a boyfriend decided to embark on his plan to rob a bank. As part of his scheme, the boyfriend enlisted his girlfriend, who agreed to drive the getaway car. On the day of the robbery, the girlfriend and the boyfriend drove to the bank. After the girlfriend parked outside and the boyfriend went into the bank, she saw a security guard in the bank and changed her mind and fled on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the motor running. A few minutes later, the boyfriend went into the bank, robbed it, and then ran back to the car. He drove off and was speeding away from the bank when he looked behind to see if he was being followed. As he took his eye off the road, the boyfriend's vehicle struck a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. For the pedestrian's death, the girlfriend should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

Options:

A: Murder.
B: No crime.
C: Involuntary manslaughter.
D: Negligent homicide.
E: Conspiracy to commit murder.
F: Attempted murder.
G: Second degree murder.
H: Accessory after the fact.
I: Voluntary manslaughter.

Okay, so I need to figure out what crime, if any, the girlfriend is guilty of in this scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the situation: The boyfriend planned a bank robbery and got his girlfriend to drive the getaway car. She agreed, but on the day, she saw a security guard and got scared. She fled, leaving the car running with the keys inside. The boyfriend went ahead, robbed the bank, and then came back to the car. While driving away, he hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. We have to determine the girlfriend's liability for the pedestrian's death.

So, the girlfriend's actions: She agreed to drive the getaway car. But on the day, she saw a security guard, changed her mind, and ran away, leaving the car with the keys in the ignition. The boyfriend took the car, drove away, and caused a fatal accident by hitting the pedestrian.

I think the key here is to determine if the girlfriend can be held responsible for the boyfriend's actions after she left. She didn't intend for him to hit anyone, but her actions might have contributed to the situation.

Let me consider possible charges:

1. **Murder (A):** Murder typically requires intent to kill or cause death. The girlfriend didn't intend to kill the pedestrian. She left the car, so she didn't directly cause the accident. So, probably not murder.

2. **No crime (B):** If she had no control over the situation after she left, maybe she's not guilty. But she left the car running, which the boyfriend could take. So, maybe she's not entirely blameless.

3. **Involuntary manslaughter (C):** This involves causing death through recklessness or criminal negligence. Did she act with such disregard for human life? She left the car in a spot where the boyfriend could use it, knowing he was planning a robbery. Maybe her act of leaving the car with the keys could be seen as reckless, contributing to the accident. But she didn't intend for him to cause harm, so it's more about whether she should have foreseen the risk.

4. **Negligent homicide (D):** Similar to involuntary manslaughter, it's about causing death through negligence. If she was negligent in leaving the car, this could apply. But I think involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide are similar, and the question might use them interchangeably, but perhaps in some jurisdictions, they're separate.

5. **Conspiracy to commit murder (E):** Conspiracy requires agreeing to commit a crime with intent. She agreed to drive the getaway car, but the crime committed by the boyfriend wasn't murder; it was robbery that led to the accident. So conspiracy to commit murder might not fit unless the intent was to kill, which it wasn't.

6. **Attempted murder (F):** Again, this requires intent to kill. Since the boyfriend didn't intend to kill the pedestrian, and the girlfriend didn't either, this doesn't seem to apply.

7. **Second-degree murder (G):** This usually involves intentional killing but without premeditation. Since neither the boyfriend nor the girlfriend intended to kill, this doesn't fit.

8. **Accessory after the fact (H):** This is helping someone after they've committed a crime. But she didn't help him after the robbery; she left before the robbery happened. So this might not apply.

9. **Voluntary manslaughter (I):** This typically involves intentional killing in the heat of passion. Not applicable here.

So focusing on involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide. The difference might be in the level of negligence. Involuntary manslaughter can include situations where someone's actions create a known and substantial risk of death, while negligent homicide might be a broader term for causing death through negligence.

The girlfriend left the car running, which the boyfriend took. She might have known that leaving the car unattended could allow him to escape, but did she foresee the risk of him causing an accident? It's possible that a reasonable person would have foreseen that leaving the car in a busy area could lead to an accident. Therefore, her action could be seen as criminally negligent, contributing to the pedestrian's death.

So, between C and D, but perhaps in the given options, C (involuntary manslaughter) is the correct charge because it involves causing death through reckless conduct. Alternatively, if the jurisdiction uses D as a separate charge, but in many cases, leaving a vehicle running and accessible could be considered reckless, leading to involuntary manslaughter.

The girlfriend can be found guilty of **C: Involuntary manslaughter** because her act of leaving the car running and accessible, knowing her boyfriend intended to use it for a robbery, constitutes reckless conduct that contributed to the pedestrian's death. 

Answer: C
