Okay, so I have this physics question about the negative muon and which particle it's most similar to. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that the muon is a type of lepton. Leptons are a category of elementary particles, right? The main leptons I know are electrons, muons, and taus, along with their neutrinos. So muon minus, mu^-, must be a charged lepton then.

Now, looking at the options: A is gluon. Gluons are the force carriers for the strong force, binding quarks together. They're bosons, not leptons. So probably not A.

Option B is electron. Electrons are also charged leptons, just like muons. They have the same charge, -1, and similar properties but different masses. Electrons are lighter than muons. So B could be a strong contender.

Option C is quark. Quarks are different because they are fermions too, but they carry color charge and are confined inside hadrons. Muons aren't like quarks at all, so C is out.

D is proton. Protons are made of quarks (two up and one down), and they're baryons. Protons are much heavier than electrons or muons, and they're composite particles. So D doesn't fit.

E is photon. Photon is a boson, the carrier of electromagnetic force. It's neutral and massless. Muons have charge, so E is not similar.

F is boson. That's a broader category, including photons, gluons, W and Z bosons, etc. Muons are fermions, so F is no.

G is meson. Mesons are made of a quark and an antiquark. They're bosons too and much heavier than electrons. So G isn't right either.

H is neutron. Neutrons are neutral baryons, made of quarks. They're heavier than electrons and have no charge. So H is not the answer.

So, going back, the muon is a charged lepton, just like the electron. They both have the same charge, spin-1/2, and are fundamental particles. The main difference is their mass. Electrons are lighter, muons are heavier but otherwise similar in properties. So the negative muon is most similar to the electron.

The negative muon (mu^-) is a charged lepton, and its properties are most similar to the electron. Both are fundamental particles with the same charge (-1) and spin-1/2, differing primarily in mass. 

Answer: B
