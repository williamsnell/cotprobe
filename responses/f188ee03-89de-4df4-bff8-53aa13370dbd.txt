Okay, I need to figure out what maturation means and how it's the basis for human behavior. Let's start by recalling what maturation generally refers to. I think maturation is about the process of growing up and developing physically, emotionally, and mentally as a person ages.

Looking at the options, I should go through each one to see which fits best.

Option A says maturation is acquiring knowledge through education and experience. That sounds more like learning or development, not exactly maturation.

Option B talks about deliberate changes based on cultural norms. That seems more behavior modification, maybe socialization rather than maturation.

Option C is about reaching physical peak performance. While maturation does involve physical changes, peak performance might be more about fitness or sports, so maybe not the full picture.

Option D is adapting to the environment. That seems more like adaptation, which is related but not exactly maturation.

Option E says it's the development of bodily processes and the resulting changes in behavior. That sounds closer. Maturation does involve both physical changes and how behavior changes because of that.

Option F refers to natural growth of intellectual abilities without learning. But maturation includes both natural development and learning, so F might be too narrow.

Option G is the aging process. Maturation is part of aging, but it's more specific than just aging.

Option H is learning new skills, which is more about skill acquisition than maturation.

Option I is about personality changes due to personal choices. That's part of maturation but not the whole picture.

Option J talks about social influence. Social factors do play a role, but maturation is broader than just social influence.

So, the best fit seems to be option E. It captures both the physical development and the resulting behavioral changes, which aligns with the concept of maturation as the basis for human behavior.

The correct answer is E. Maturation involves the development of bodily processes and the resulting changes in behavior, which serve as the foundation for much of human behavior.
