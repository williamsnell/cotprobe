Okay, so I've got this problem here where Tara can develop 2 rolls of film in about 18 minutes. The question is asking how long it will take her to develop 8 rolls at this same rate. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I think I should find out how long it takes her to develop one roll of film. If 2 rolls take 18 minutes, then one roll would take half of that time. So 18 divided by 2 is 9. That means she takes 9 minutes per roll.

Now, the question is about 8 rolls. If each roll takes 9 minutes, then for 8 rolls, I just need to multiply 9 by 8. Let me do that: 9 times 8 is 72 minutes. 

Wait, but the options are given in hours and minutes, so I need to convert 72 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 72 divided by 60 is 1 hour and 12 minutes. 

Looking at the options, option D is 1 hour 12 minutes. That should be the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

2 rolls = 18 minutes → 1 roll = 9 minutes. 8 rolls × 9 = 72 minutes. 72 minutes is 1 hour (60 minutes) plus 12 minutes. Yep, that all adds up. So I'm confident that D is the right choice.

The calculation involves determining the time per roll and then scaling up for 8 rolls, leading to 72 minutes, which is 1 hour 12 minutes.

Answer: D
