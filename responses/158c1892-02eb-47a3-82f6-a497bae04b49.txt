Okay, so I need to figure out how old Guru Nanak was when he started preaching the message of the divine Name. I'm not too familiar with the exact details, but I know a bit about Sikhism from what I've read before. Let me try to piece this together.

First, I remember that Guru Nanak was the founder of the Sikh religion. He was born in the 15th century in Punjab, I think. I'm not sure of the exact date, but I believe it was around 1469. Now, the question is about his age when he began his teachings. I think he started his missionary work when he was in his early 30s. But wait, I'm not entirely certain.

I recall that many spiritual leaders start their missions after a period of personal reflection or training. So, if he was born in 1469, and if he started preaching around 1495, that would make him about 26 years old. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 1495 minus 1469 is 26, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Another thought: maybe he was older. I think I've heard that he was in his late 30s when he began his travels and teachings.

Looking at the options, I see 25, 30, 33, 35, etc. I'm trying to remember if there's a specific number associated with his age when he started. I think it's around 30. Let me think about the timeline. If he was born in 1469, and started preaching in 1495, that's 26. But maybe the date of his birth is different. Some sources say he was born in 1461, which would make it 34 in 1495. Wait, that can't be right because 1495 minus 1461 is 34. Hmm, but that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the years. Let me check my facts. Guru Nanak was born in 1469, and he started his journey at the age of 33 in 1496. That would make sense because 1496 minus 1469 is 27, but that doesn't add up. Wait, no, 1496 minus 1469 is 27 years old. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps he started his mission around 1507, which would be 38 years old. But that's not one of the options here. Let me think again. I think the correct age is 30. So, if he was born in 1469, adding 30 years would take him to 1499. That seems plausible because I remember that he started his travels around that time.

Wait, another angle: I've heard that he was 30 when he began his first long journey, which was a significant start to his preaching. So that would make sense. Therefore, the answer should be 30. Looking at the options, that's option H:30.

The answer is H:30.
