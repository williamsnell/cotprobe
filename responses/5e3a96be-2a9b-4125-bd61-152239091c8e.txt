Question:

If a star that is 20 light-years from Earth explodes, gravitational waves from the explosion would reach Earth in

Options:

A: 10 years, as gravitational waves travel at double the speed of light
B: 5 years, as gravitational waves travel at four times the speed of light
C: 40 years, as gravitational waves travel at half the speed of light
D: Instantly, as gravitational waves travel at infinite speed
E: 20 years.
F: None of these.
G: 100 years, as gravitational waves travel at a fifth the speed of light
H: more than 20 years.
I: less than 20 years.
J: It would never reach Earth

Okay, so I've got this question about gravitational waves and how long it would take for them to reach Earth if a star 20 light-years away explodes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

First, I remember that gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by massive cosmic events, like supernovas. But wait, how fast do they travel? I think Einstein's theory of general relativity says that gravitational waves should travel at the speed of light. Oh right, because they're part of spacetime itself, so they should move at the same speed as light, which is the universe's speed limit.

So if the star is 20 light-years away, and the waves are moving at the speed of light, it should take them 20 years to reach Earth. Because one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, so 20 light-years would take 20 years. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, option E says 20 years, which fits. But wait, let me check the other options to be sure. Option A says 10 years because it's double the speed. But no, that's not right because if it were double, the time would be less, but gravitational waves can't go faster than light. Option B says 5 years, implying four times speed, which is impossible. Option D says more than 20, but that's only if it were slower than light, which it isn't. Option I says less than 20, which would be if faster than light, but they can't do that. So E is the correct choice.

The gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, so it takes 20 years to reach Earth. 

Answer: E
