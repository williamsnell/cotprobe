Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of people in the United States who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 16% to 96%. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should think about what I know regarding American politics and public opinion. I remember that trust in political institutions has been a topic of discussion, especially with the rise of polarization. I think public trust in political parties isn't very high, but I'm not sure exactly how high the percentage is.

Let me think about some surveys or polls I've heard about. I recall that in general, a significant portion of the population is dissatisfied with the political system. But when it comes to political parties, do a majority think they're corrupt? Maybe around 50% or more?

Looking at the options, the higher numbers are C:66%, F:56%, J:76%, and G and H are even higher. I'm not sure if it's that high. On the other hand, lower numbers like A:36%, B:46%, D:26%, E:16% â€” those seem a bit low if the sentiment is negative towards parties.

Wait, I think I remember a specific survey result. Wasn't there a Gallup poll around that time? I think around 2013, Gallup might have reported that a majority of Americans believed both major parties were doing a poor job. Maybe the percentage was around 60-70% thinking they're corrupt or ineffective.

Another angle: considering the options, 66% is one of them. I think that's a number I've come across before. Maybe it's from a Pew Research Center study or another reputable source. They often report on public trust in institutions, including political parties. So if I recall, a significant chunk, like two-thirds, felt that way.

Let me also consider the other options. 56% is an option, but I think the number was higher. 76% is quite high, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. I think 66% is more plausible based on what I've heard before.

So putting it all together, the answer is likely C:66%.

The answer is C:66%.
