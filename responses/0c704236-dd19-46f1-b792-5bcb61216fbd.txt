<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about finding the 15's and 16's complements of some hexadecimal numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that hexadecimal numbers use base 16, so each digit can be 0-9 and A-F, where A is 10, B is 11, up to F which is 15. 

The question has four parts: a) FF0, b) 1234, c) ABCD, d) 0000. And each part asks for both the 15's and 16's complements. Wait, no, the question says "obtain the 15's and 16's complement" but looking at the options, each option lists four answers, each part labeled a) to d). So I think each part in the options corresponds to the a), b), c), d) in the question. So for each of the four numbers, we need to find their 15's and 16's complements, but wait, the options only list four answers per option, so maybe each option is providing the 15's and 16's for each of the four numbers? Or perhaps each option is giving the 15's and 16's for each part. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let's proceed.

Wait, actually, each part a) to d) is a hexadecimal number, and the options (A to J) each provide four answers, each for a) to d). So for each part, the options give what they think is the correct complement.

Wait, but the question says "obtain the 15's and 16's complements of the following hexadecimal numbers". So for each number, we need both the 15's and 16's complement. But looking at the options, each option lists four answers, each for a) to d). So I think each a) in the options corresponds to the a) in the question, and same for b), c), d). So each option is providing four answers, each being the 15's and 16's complement for each part. Wait, but each part has two complements. So perhaps each answer in the options is giving both the 15's and 16's complement for each part, but looking at the options, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe each option is giving either the 15's or 16's complement for each part. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let's proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify: the 15's complement is the same as the radix complement for base 16. Wait no, wait. Radix complement for base r is r^n - number, where n is the number of digits. So 16's complement would be for each digit, subtract it from 15 (since 16-1=15) and that's the 15's complement. Wait, no, actually, 15's complement is each digit subtracted from 15, right? Because 16's complement would be adding 1 to the 15's complement. Wait, no, 16's complement is 16^n - number, which can be done by taking the 15's complement and adding 1.

Wait, so for a hexadecimal digit, the 15's complement is each digit subtracted from F (which is 15 in hex). So for example, the 15's complement of A (10) is F - A = 5, because F is 15. Wait, no, wait: 15's complement is (15 - digit) for each digit. So for each digit, subtract it from F (15) to get the 15's complement. Then the 16's complement is that plus 1, right? Because 16's complement is 16^n - number, which is the 15's complement plus 1.

So for a given number, say FF0, let's compute both complements.

Let's take part a) FFO. Wait, but FF0 is three digits, right? So let's see.

FF0 in hex is three digits. So n=3.

15's complement: For each digit, subtract from F.

F: F - F = 0
F: 0
0: F - 0 = F
So 15's complement is 00F.

Wait, but let me check: the number is FF0. So each digit is F, F, 0.

So 15's complement would be F-F=0, F-F=0, F-0=F. So 00F.

Then 16's complement is 15's complement + 1. So 00F + 1 = 010. Because F is 15 in decimal, so 00F is 15 in decimal, adding 1 gives 16, which in hex is 010.

Wait, but wait: 00F is 15, adding 1 makes 16, which in 3-digit hex is 010. So 16's complement is 010.

So for a) FFO, the 15's complement is 00F and the 16's is 010.

Wait, but the options list each part's answer as a single value, but the question is to find both 15's and 16's complements. Hmm, perhaps each option is giving both, but in the options, each a) is one of the answers. Wait, looking at the options, for example, option E says a) 00F, b) EDCB, etc. So perhaps each a) is giving both? Or perhaps each option is for one of the parts. Wait, no, the question is to find all four parts, so each option must be providing the answers for a), b), c), d).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go through each part.

a) FFO: Let's compute both 15's and 16's complements.

Number: F F 0

15's complement:
Each digit: F → 0, F → 0, 0 → F → 00F.

16's complement: 00F + 1 = 010.

So for a), 15's is 00F and 16's is 010.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has a) as 00F and perhaps 010, but I'm not sure how the options are structured. Wait, looking at the options, each option lists four answers for a) to d), each probably as a single value. Wait, perhaps each option provides the 15's complement for a) to d), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps each option is giving the 16's complement for each part. Hmm, maybe I should look at the options and see which one matches.

Looking at option E: a) 00F, b) EDCB, c) 5432, d) FFFF.

Wait, for a) in option E, it's 00F, which is the 15's complement. So 16's would be 010, which is not listed, but perhaps each option is giving the 15's complement. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing both 15's and 16's in some way.

Wait, perhaps the options are listing the 15's complement for each part. Let me check.

For a) FFO, 15's complement is 00F. 16's is 010.

Looking at the options:

Option E's a) is 00F.

Option E's b) is EDCB.

Hmm, let's check part b) 1234.

Number: 1 2 3 4.

15's complement: each digit subtracted from F.

F -1 = E, F-2=D, F-3=C, F-4=B.

So 15's complement is E D C B.

16's complement is EDCB + 1 = EDCB +1. Let's compute that.

EDCB is a 4-digit hex number: E D C B.

Adding 1:

B +1 = C. So the last digit becomes C, carryover 0.

So 16's is E D C C.

Wait, but that's not matching any option. Let me check.

Wait, wait. EDCB is the 15's complement. Adding 1 gives EDCB +1 = E D C C? Let me compute:

EDCB in hex is (E)(D)(C)(B). Adding 1:

B +1 = C, so last digit C, no carryover. So 16's complement is E D C C.

So for part b), 15's is EDCB, 16's is EDCC.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has b) as EDCB or EDCC.

Option E's b) is EDCB, which would be the 15's complement.

Option F's b) is EDCC, which would be the 16's complement.

Wait, but the options may be providing either 15's or 16's. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me move to part c) ABCD.

Number: A B C D.

15's complement:

F - A = 5 (since A is 10, F is 15, 15-10=5).
F - B = 5 (11 → 15-11=4? Wait, no: 15-11 is 4, but B is 11, so F - B = 4. Wait, wait, wait: F is 15, so 15 - B is 15-11=4.

Wait, so:

A: 5
B: 4
C: 3 (since C is 12, 15-12=3)
D: 2 (15-13=2).

So 15's complement is 5 4 3 2 → 5432.

16's complement is 5432 + 1 = 5433.

So for part c), 15's is 5432, 16's is 5433.

Looking at the options, option E's c) is 5432, which would be the 15's complement, and option F's c) is 5433, which is the 16's.

Now, part d) is 0000.

15's complement: each digit is F -0 = F, so for four digits, it's FFFF.

16's complement is FFFF +1 = 10000, but since it's four digits, it would be 0000 with a carryover, but in 4-digit hex, it's 0000. Wait, no: 16's complement is 16^n - number. For 0000, 16^4 is 65536, so 65536 - 0 = 65536, which in 4 hex digits is 0000, but that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. For a 4-digit hex number, n=4. So 16^4 is 65536, but 0000 is 0, so 16's complement is 65536 - 0 = 65536, which in 4 hex digits is 0000 (since 65536 is 10000 in hex, which is 5 digits). Wait, but that would cause an overflow, so perhaps in 4 digits, the 16's complement of 0000 is 0000, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. For n digits, 16's complement is (16^n - number). So for 0000 (n=4), it's 16^4 - 0 = 65536, which in hex is 10000, but that's 5 digits. So in 4-digit hex, it wraps around, so 10000 is 0000 with a carryover, but the complement would be 0000. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the 16's complement of 0000 is FFFF +1 = 0000. So the 16's complement of 0000 is 0000, because adding 1 to FFFF (15's) gives 0000.

Wait, but that's confusing. So for d) 0000, the 15's complement is FFFF, and the 16's complement is FFFF +1 = 0000. So for part d), 15's is FFFF and 16's is 0000.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which option has the correct answers for all four parts.

Let's go through each option:

Option E: a) 00F, b) EDCB, c) 5432, d) FFFF.

So for a), 00F is 15's, correct. b) EDCB is 15's, correct. c) 5432 is 15's, correct. d) FFFF is 15's, but the 16's would be 0000. So if the options are giving 15's for each part, then E would be correct for 15's, but we're asked for both 15's and 16's. Hmm, perhaps the options are only giving one of them. Alternatively, maybe the options are giving the 16's complement for each part.

Wait, looking at option E, d) is FFFF, which is the 15's complement of 0000. So if the options are providing the 15's complements, then E would be correct for a), b), c), but d) would be FFFF as 15's, but the 16's is 0000. So perhaps the options are listing the 15's complement for each part. Let me check other options.

Option E's a) is 00F (15's), b) EDCB (15's), c)5432 (15's), d) FFFF (15's). So if the question is asking for 15's complements, E would be correct.

Wait, but the question says "15's and 16's complement", so perhaps each option is giving both, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the 15's complement for each part.

Wait, looking back at the question: "Obtain the 15's and 16's complement of the following hexadecimal numbers". So for each number, we need both. But the options only list four answers per option, so perhaps each option is giving the 15's complement for each part, and another option gives the 16's. Alternatively, perhaps each option is giving all four 15's and 16's, but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the options are giving the 16's complement for each part. Let me check.

For a) FFO, 16's is 010. Looking at the options:

Option E's a) is 00F (15's), not 010.

Option I's a) is 010, which would be the 16's complement.

Wait, but if the options are giving the 16's complement for each part, then let's see.

a) 16's is 010.

b) 16's is EDCC.

c) 16's is 5433.

d) 16's is 0000.

Looking at the options:

Option F: a) 010, b) EDCC, c)5433, d)10000. Wait, but d) would be 0000, as 16's complement of 0000 is 0000.

Option F's d) is 10000, which is 5 digits, so that's wrong. So F can't be correct.

Option E has d) FFFF, which is the 15's complement of 0000, not the 16's.

Option I: a) 010, b) EDBA, c)5430, d) FFF1.

Hmm, not matching.

Option J: a) 001, b) EDBB, c)5431, d) FFFE.

No.

Option D: a)010, b)EECB, c)6543, d)000F.

Hmm, not matching.

So perhaps the correct option is E, which gives the 15's complements correctly for all parts except d), where it gives FFFF. But 16's complement of 0000 is 0000, so if the options are giving 15's, E would be correct except for d), which is FFFF as 15's, but 16's is 0000.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the options don't clearly state whether they're providing 15's or 16's. Alternatively, perhaps the options are providing the 15's complement for each part.

Wait, let me re-examine each part with the options.

Looking at option E:

a) 00F → correct 15's for FFO.

b) EDCB → correct 15's for 1234.

c)5432 → correct 15's for ABCD.

d) FFFF → correct 15's for 0000.

So if the question is asking for the 15's complements, option E would be correct.

But the question asks for both 15's and 16's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are providing the 16's complements.

Wait, for a) FFO, 16's is 010. Looking at the options:

Option I's a) is 010.

Option E's a) is 00F, which is 15's.

So perhaps the options are giving both 15's and 16's, but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps each option is providing the 15's complement for each part, and the correct answer is E, which gives 00F for a), EDCB for b), 5432 for c), and FFFF for d). So E would be correct if the question is only about 15's complements.

But the question mentions both 15's and 16's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are giving the 16's complements.

Wait, for part a), 16's is 010. Looking at the options, option I has a) 010.

Option I's b) is EDBA, which is not matching. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to match all four parts.

Looking for an option where:

a) 15's is 00F and 16's is 010.

b) 15's is EDCB and 16's is EDCC.

c) 15's is 5432 and 16's is 5433.

d) 15's is FFFF and 16's is 0000.

Looking at the options, none of them seem to list both 15's and 16's for each part. Each option only lists four answers, probably either 15's or 16's.

Wait, perhaps the options are giving the 16's complement for each part. Let's see:

a) 16's is 010.

Looking at the options, option I's a) is 010.

b) 16's is EDCC. Option F's b) is EDCC.

c) 16's is 5433. Option F's c) is 5433.

d) 16's is 0000. Option F's d) is 10000, which is wrong.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, option E gives for a) 00F (15's), b) EDCB (15's), c)5432 (15's), d) FFFF (15's). So if the question is only about 15's, E is correct.

But the question asks for both 15's and 16's. So perhaps the options are including both, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps each option is giving the 16's complement for each part.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the 15's and 16's complements, and the options are providing the 16's complements, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are giving the 15's complement, and the correct answer is E.

Looking back, the options are labeled A to J, each with four answers. So perhaps each option is giving the 15's complement for each part, and the correct one is E.

So, considering all that, I think the correct answer is E, which gives the 15's complements correctly for all parts.
</think>

The correct answer is E, which provides the 15's complements for all four hexadecimal numbers.

Answer: E
