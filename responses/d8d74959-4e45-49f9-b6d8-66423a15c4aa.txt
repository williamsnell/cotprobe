Question:

What are the difficulties in the classification of tissuesof higherplants?

Options:

A: Plant tissues can be fully characterized based on their evolutionary heritage
B: Plant tissues are distinguished only by their cellular composition without considering their function
C: All plant tissues are meristematic and capable of continuous division
D: Plant tissues can be classified with ease as they do not exhibit any plasticity or change in response to environmental conditions
E: Plant tissues are identical in angiosperms and gymnosperms, making classification simple
F: The classification of plant tissues is uncomplicated due to the uniformity of cells within a given tissue type
G: Plant tissues cannot be fully characterized or distinguished on the basis of any one single factor such as location, function, structure or evolutionary heritage. Some permanent tissues may change to meristematic activity under certain conditions.
H: Plant tissues can be classified solely on the basis of the type of cell wall they possess
I: Plant tissues can be easily distinguished based on their location and function
J: All plant tissues remain constant throughout their life cycle

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the difficulties in classifying plant tissues. Let me start by understanding the question properly. The question is asking what makes it hard to classify the tissues of higher plants. There are ten options, A through J.

First, I'll recall what I know about plant tissues. Higher plants, like angiosperms and gymnosperms, have different types of tissues, such as meristematic, ground, vascular, and epidermal tissues. Each type has specific functions and structures. But classification can be tricky because sometimes tissues might have overlapping features or change their function based on the plant's needs.

Looking at the options:

Option A says plant tissues can be fully characterized based on their evolutionary heritage. Hmm, evolutionary heritage might be one factor, but I think there are more complexities. Maybe this isn't the main difficulty.

Option B states that plant tissues are distinguished only by their cellular composition without considering their function. That doesn't sound right because function is a key part of classification. So this option seems incorrect.

Option C claims all plant tissues are meristematic and can divide continuously. Wait, no, only meristematic tissues are like that. Most mature tissues are permanent and don't divide. So C is incorrect.

Option D says classification is easy because plants don't change with the environment. That's not true; plants are plastic and can change in response to their environment, so D is wrong.

Option E suggests tissues are identical in angiosperms and gymnosperms. I know there are differences between these groups, so E is incorrect.

Option F says classification is easy due to uniformity in cells. But I think tissues can have varying cell types even within a category, so F might not be right.

Option G says plant tissues can't be fully characterized by any single factor like location, function, structure, or evolutionary heritage. It also mentions that some permanent tissues might become meristematic under certain conditions. This sounds plausible because classification often depends on multiple factors, and sometimes tissues can change roles, making it harder to classify them based on just one trait.

Option H suggests classification is based solely on cell wall type. But cell walls vary, but other factors like structure and function are also important, so H is likely incorrect.

Option I says tissues are easily distinguished by location and function. While these are important, I think it's not that straightforward because sometimes tissues might not fit neatly into categories based on just these factors, especially when they change or have multiple roles.

Option J claims all tissues remain constant throughout their life. That's not true; plants can undergo secondary growth, and some tissues can change, so J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the difficulties in classifying plant tissues come from the fact that no single factor like location, function, structure, or evolutionary heritage can fully characterize them. Additionally, some permanent tissues can revert to meristematic activity, adding another layer of complexity. So, option G seems to be the correct answer.

The classification of plant tissues is complicated because no single factor like location, function, structure, or evolutionary heritage can fully characterize them, and some permanent tissues may change to meristematic activity under certain conditions.
