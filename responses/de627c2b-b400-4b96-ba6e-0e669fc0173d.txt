Okay, so I've got this problem about sulfuric acid solution, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A sulfuric acid solution has a density of 1.8 g/ml and is 90% H₂SO₄ by weight. We need to find two things—first, the weight of H₂SO₄ present in 1000 ml of the solution, and second, the molarity and normality of the solution.

The options are given from A to J, each with three values: grams of H₂SO₄, molarity, and normality. So I need to calculate each part and match it to the options.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I'll find the weight of H₂SO₄ in 1000 ml.

Since the solution is 90% H₂SO₄ by weight, that means in 100% of the solution's weight, 90% is H₂SO₄. Therefore, if I can find the total weight of the solution, I can multiply by 0.9 to get the grams of H₂SO₄.

The volume given is 1000 ml, which is 1 liter. The density is 1.8 g/ml. So the total mass of the solution is density multiplied by volume. Density is 1.8 g/ml, volume is 1000 ml.

Calculating that: 1.8 g/ml * 1000 ml = 1800 grams. So the total weight of the solution is 1800 grams.

Now, 90% of that is H₂SO₄. So 0.9 * 1800 grams = 1620 grams of H₂SO₄. Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check that calculation. 0.9 * 1800 is indeed 1620. Hmm, but looking at the options, option J has 1620 g as the first value. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when dealing with solutions, the percentages can be by mass or volume, but in this case, it's by weight, so mass percentage.

So yes, 90% of 1800 grams is 1620 grams. So the weight of H₂SO₄ in 1000 ml is 1620 grams. That matches option J's first value.

Next, I need to find the molarity of the solution. Molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution. So I need to find how many moles of H₂SO₄ are in 1620 grams, then divide by the volume in liters.

The molar mass of H₂SO₄: H is about 1, S is 32, O is 16. So H₂ is 2(1)=2, S is 32, O₄ is 4(16)=64. Adding these up: 2 +32 +64 =98 g/mol.

So moles = mass / molar mass = 1620 g / 98 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1620 divided by 98. Let's see, 98 * 16 is 1568. 1620 - 1568 =52. So that's 16 moles with 52 left. 52/98 ≈0.53. So total is approximately 16.53 moles.

Since the volume is 1 liter, molarity is 16.53 M. Looking at the options, option J has 16.5 M, which aligns with this.

Now, normality. Normality is a concept used for acids and bases. For sulfuric acid, which is a diprotic acid, each molecule can donate 2 H+ ions in solution. So the normality is calculated as molarity multiplied by the number of H+ ions per molecule, which is 2.

So normality = 16.53 M * 2 = 33.06 N. Looking at the options, option J's normality is 33.0 N, which is close enough considering rounding.

Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Another way to calculate normality is (grams of solute / molar mass) * (n) / volume in liters. Where n is the number of H+ ions per molecule, which is 2 for H₂SO₄.

So grams is 1620, molar mass 98, n=2. So (1620 /98)*2 /1 = (16.53)*2 =33.06 N. Yep, that's correct.

So putting it all together, the weight is 1620 g, molarity is ~16.5 M, normality ~33.0 N. Which matches option J.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option J says 1620 g, 16.5 M, 33.0 N. That's exactly what I got.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is 1440 g, 14.4 M, 28.8 N. That's lower; perhaps if the solution was 80% H2SO4, but no, the question says 90%.

Wait, another thing: sometimes when calculating molarity, people might make a mistake with the number of H+ ions. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in solution, the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second one does as well, but sometimes in dilute solutions, the second might not. But in this case, for normality, we're considering the equivalents based on the acid's ability to donate H+ ions. Since H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions per molecule, the normality is 2 times the molarity.

Wait, another way to think about it: equivalent weight = molar mass / n. So n=2 for H2SO4. So equivalent weight is 98 /2 =49 g/equivalent.

But normality is equivalents per liter. So equivalents = mass / equivalent weight =1620 /49 ≈33.06 eq. So normality is 33.06 N, which aligns with what I had earlier.

So yes, I think option J is correct. But let me just cross-check with the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J: 1620 g, 16.5 M, 33.0 N.

Yes, that's exactly what I calculated.

The solution requires calculating the weight of H₂SO₄ in 1000 ml, molarity, and normality. 

1. **Weight of H₂SO₄**:  
   The solution is 90% H₂SO₄ by weight. The total mass of 1000 ml (density = 1.8 g/ml) is 1.8 g/ml × 1000 ml = 1800 g.  
   90% of 1800 g is 0.9 × 1800 = 1620 g of H₂SO₄.

2. **Molarity**:  
   Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = 98 g/mol.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 1620 g / 98 g/mol ≈ 16.53 mol.  
   Molarity = moles / volume (L) = 16.53 mol / 1 L ≈ 16.5 M.

3. **Normality**:  
   H₂SO₄ is diprotic (donates 2 H⁺ ions).  
   Normality = molarity × n = 16.5 M × 2 = 33.0 N.

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is **J: 1620 g, 16.5 M, 33.0 N**.
