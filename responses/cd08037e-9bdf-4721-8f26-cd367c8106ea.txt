Okay, so I've got this question about gender-role identity development theories. The question is asking which theory aligns with research showing that parents play more roughly with boys and are more protective with girls. Hmm. Let me think about each of the options and what each theory entails.

First, I remember that gender schema theory is about how children develop categories for gender, including behaviors and roles. It suggests that kids organize their experiences into schemas, which are like frameworks. So if parents treat boys and girls differently, that would fit into how children build their understanding of gender roles.

Looking at the options, option H is Gender schema theory. That seems relevant because it's about how children categorize and understand gender based on their environment and experiences. If parents play roughly with boys, the child might associate rough play with being male. Similarly, being more protective with girls could lead the child to associate protection and perhaps more fragility with being female.

Other theories: Cognitive development (A) is more about how kids think and reason, not specifically about gender roles. Identity theory (B) is about personal identity, maybe broader than just gender roles. Cultural theory (C) could be about societal influences, but the question is more about direct parent behavior. Biological (D) is about innate factors, but the question is about learned behaviors from parents. Constructivist (E) is about learning through experience, which is a bit similar, but I think gender schema is more specific. Social learning (F) is about observing and imitating, which also could apply, but the question is about the specific way parents treat each gender, which might tie more to schemas. Psychoanalytic (G) is about unconscious drives, which doesn't directly explain the learned gender roles from parents. Psychodynamic (I) is similar to psychoanalytic. Evolutionary psychology (J) would focus on evolutionary reasons for behavior, not necessarily the social learning aspect from parents.

So, putting it together, the parents' behavior is likely shaping the child's gender schemas. Therefore, the answer should be H: Gender schema theory.

The research described aligns with gender schema theory, which explains how children develop categories for gender roles based on their experiences, including those shaped by their parents' behaviors. 

Answer: H
