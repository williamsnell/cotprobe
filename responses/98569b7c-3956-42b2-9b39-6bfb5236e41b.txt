Okay, so I've got this question about what happens to neurotransmitters after they've done their job. I'm a bit rusty on my neurophysiology, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse between neurons. They’re released from the presynaptic neuron, cross the synaptic cleft, and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. This binding causes a response in the next cell, which could be either兴奋 or抑制.

Now, the question is about what happens after they've done their job. I think the key here is that once the signal is transmitted, the neurotransmitters need to be cleared away so that the signal doesn't keep getting sent over and over. Otherwise, the postsynaptic cell would remain active indefinitely, which isn't how神经传递 works.

So, how do they get cleared? I remember something about re-uptake. The presynaptic neuron has these re-uptake pumps that take the neurotransmitters back into the neuron. This process is sometimes called re-uptake, and it's a way to recycle the neurotransmitters. For example, norepinephrine and serotonin are taken back into the sending neuron this way.

Another possibility is that enzymes in the synaptic cleft break down the neurotransmitters. Acetylcholine, for instance, is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This inactivation ensures that the signal doesn't persist once the neurotransmitter is broken down.

Looking at the options:

A: Diffuse away and exhaled. That doesn't sound right because neurotransmitters are in the synaptic cleft, not in the bloodstream, and exhalation is a respiratory process. So probably not A.

B: Converted into cellular energy. I don't think neurotransmitters are used as energy sources. They’re more about signaling, not fuel.

C: Replicate to enhance the signal. No, neurotransmitters don't replicate. They're released in vesicles and then either reuptaken or broken down.

D: Destroyed. This could be part of the answer, but maybe not the full picture because some are reabsorbed and others are destroyed.

E: Released into bloodstream. No, they're released into the synaptic cleft, not the bloodstream. Bloodstream is for hormones and other systemic signals.

F: Used to build new synapses. Not sure about this. Maybe some signaling molecules are involved in structural changes, but I don't think this is the primary fate of neurotransmitters after their job.

G: Remain active indefinitely. No, because that would cause continuous signaling, which isn't how it works. The signal needs to stop after the appropriate response.

H: Stored in the cell nucleus. Doesn't make sense because neurotransmitters are in the cytoplasm, not stored in the nucleus for later.

I: Deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action. This sounds correct. After binding, they're either taken back into the cell (re-uptake) or broken down by enzymes, preventing further signaling.

J: Bond permanently to receptors. No, because the receptors need to be free for new signals. Permanent bonding would prevent further transmission.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: Neurotransmitters are deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action.
