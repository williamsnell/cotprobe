Okay, so I've got this question about slander, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, the question is asking what's not true about slander. The options are A through G, so I'll take them in order.

Option A: The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander. Hmm, I think slander requires the statement to be made with intent. But wait, I remember that in some cases, negligence might be enough, especially in certain jurisdictions. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's not always intentional? Or does it require at least intent to communicate, not necessarily intent to harm? I'll have to come back to this.

Option B: It is spoken defamation. That's correct. Slander is oral, while libel is written. So B is true, so it's not the answer.

Option C: There are four slander per se categories. I think the per se categories include things like accusing someone of a crime of violence, having a loathsome disease, harming someone's professional reputation, and bringing shame on someone's spouse or child. That makes four, so C is true. Not the answer.

Option D: Slander is less serious than libel. I've heard that libel is generally considered more serious because it's written and more permanent. So D is true, so not the answer.

Option E: Plaintiff has to prove special damages, unless it falls into slander per se. Wait, in slander, the plaintiff usually needs to prove special damages (like actual financial loss) unless it's slander per se, where it's more serious and they don't have to prove that. So E is correct, so not the answer.

Option F: The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se. Wait, slander is about communication, not publication. But I think even for slander per se, the statement needs to be communicated to a third party. Wait, no, publication in slander is different from libel. In slander, the statement just needs to be made to someone else, so it's already been 'published' in that sense. So F might be incorrect because slander per se still requires the statement to be communicated, but maybe the point is that it doesn't need to be published widely. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress. I think that's not necessarily true. Slander per se can include things like harm to reputation without needing to prove emotional distress. Or maybe in some cases, emotional distress is required. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, going back to A. Slander requires the statement to be made with intent. But I think in common law, slander required the defendant to have acted with malice, which is intent to harm. However, in some jurisdictions, negligence might suffice. But the question is about what's not true. So if A says the accused must have intentionally spread the false statement, is that always the case? Or can it be done negligently? If it's not always required, then A would be the incorrect statement.

Another angle: Option G. Does the plaintiff have to prove emotional distress? I think that in some cases, like slander per se, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove actual damages, but they might need to show some form of harm, which could include emotional distress. Or maybe emotional distress is required in cases where it's not per se. I'm not entirely certain, but I think G might be incorrect because slander per se allows for damages without proving emotional distress.

Wait, let me clarify. Slander per se allows the plaintiff to recover without proving special damages, but they still might need to show general damages, which could include emotional distress. So if G says they have to prove emotional distress, that might not be always necessary. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the question is what's NOT true. So if G is saying slander is only applicable if they can prove emotional distress, that might not be true because in slander per se, you don't have to prove special damages, but you might have to show that the statement caused harm, which could include distress.

Alternatively, perhaps G is incorrect because emotional distress isn't always required. For example, in slander per se, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove emotional distress; they just have to show the statement falls into a category that's actionable without proof of harm. Wait, no, I think they still have to show that the statement caused harm, which could involve distress, but maybe not always.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to approach this differently.

Looking at the options again, the incorrect statement is the one that's false about slander.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread the statement. If it's sufficient to have acted negligently, then A is not true. But if it must be intentional, then A is correct. I think in common law, it's intentional, but modern laws might allow negligence. So if A says it must be intentional, that might not always be true, making A the incorrect statement.

Option F: The statement doesn't have to be published if it's slander per se. Wait, slander is about communication to a third party; it's already published in that sense. So F might be incorrect because even slander per se requires the statement to be communicated (published) to someone else. So F is saying it doesn't have to be published, which would be false because it does have to be communicated.

Wait, but in slander, the term 'published' can be a bit confusing. In libel, publication is about dissemination to the public, but in slander, it's just communication to a third party. So F says if it's slander per se, the statement doesn't have to be published. But I think it does have to be communicated, so F is false.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct because slander per se might not require proof of publication in the same way as libel. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about what's not true. So if F says the statement doesn't have to be published if it's slander per se, that's incorrect because even slander per se requires the statement to have been communicated, i.e., published to a third party. So F would be the incorrect statement.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, looking at the options, the question is about which is NOT true.

Another approach: Let's recall that in slander, the plaintiff usually has to prove that the statement caused harm (general damages) unless it's slander per se, where they can get punitive damages without proving special damages.

So E is correct because plaintiff has to prove special damages unless it's slander per se.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread the statement. If it's sufficient to show negligence, then A is incorrect. So in some jurisdictions, slander can be based on negligence, not intent. So if A says it must be intentional, that's not always true, making A the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, in common law, slander required malice (intent), but modern law might allow negligence. So if the question is about common law, then A is correct. But if it's about modern law, A might not always be true.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the answer is A because some jurisdictions allow for slander based on negligence, so it's not always required to have intent. Therefore, A is not true.

Alternatively, maybe G is the incorrect statement. Let me think about G again. It says slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress. That's not necessarily true because slander per se allows for damages without proving emotional distress. So G is incorrect because emotional distress isn't always required.

Wait, but in some cases, you might have to show some form of harm, which could include emotional distress, but not always. So if G says the plaintiff must prove emotional distress, that's not always the case, making G incorrect.

Hmm. I'm getting confused between A and G.

Wait, going back to the options:

A: The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander.

If in some cases, it's sufficient to show negligence, then A is not always true. So A is the incorrect statement.

Therefore, the answer is A.
</think>

The question asks which statement is not true about slander. To determine this, each option is analyzed:

- **Option A**: States that the accused must have intentionally spread the false statement. However, in modern law, slander can sometimes be based on negligence, not just intent. Therefore, this statement is not always true.
- **Option B**: Correctly identifies slander as spoken defamation, which is accurate.
- **Option C**: Correctly mentions the four slander per se categories, which are true.
- **Option D**: Correctly states that slander is less serious than libel, as libel is typically written and more permanent.
- **Option E**: Correctly explains that the plaintiff must prove special damages unless the case falls under slander per se.
- **Option F**: States that the statement does not need to be published if it is slander per se. However, slander requires the statement to be communicated to a third party, so this is not entirely accurate.
- **Option G**: Claims that emotional distress must be proven, but in slander per se cases, special damages (like emotional distress) are not always required.

After careful consideration, **Option A** is identified as the incorrect statement because slander does not always require intent; negligence can suffice in some jurisdictions.
