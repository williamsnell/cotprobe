Question:

A law bookstore entered into a written contract to purchase from the publisher 100 copies of the latest edition of a certain casebook for $10 per book. Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is

Options:

A: unenforceable, because the original contract terms should prevail.
B: enforceable, if the publisher could prove the existence of a calculation error.
C: unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.
D: unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.
E: unenforceable, because the increase in price was not agreed upon at the time the contract was formed.
F: enforceable, because the owner agreed to the new terms.
G: enforceable, because the publisher had the right to correct his mistake.
H: enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.
I: enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it again carefully.

The scenario is about a law bookstore that entered into a written contract to buy 100 copies of a casebook for $10 each. Then, three days later, before delivery, the publisher calls the bookstore owner and says there was a calculation error. The correct price should be $11 per book, and they can't deliver unless the owner agrees to pay that amount. Reluctantly, the owner agrees. The question is whether this agreement to pay $11 is enforceable or not.

I remember that contract law deals with enforceability based on certain principles like offer and acceptance, consideration, mutual assent, and things like that. So, I think this has to do with whether the new agreement is a valid modification of the existing contract.

The original contract was written, so it's probably within the statute of frauds. The price was $10, but now they're trying to change it to $11. So, we're looking at whether this modification is valid.

I recall that under the common law, a modification of a contract can be enforceable if it's supported by consideration. That means both parties have to exchange something of value for the change. But wait, in this case, the bookstore owner agreed to pay more, but the publisher is just correcting a mistake. Did the publisher offer something in return? It doesn't seem like it. The publisher just said they won't deliver unless the owner pays more. So, the owner agreed because they wanted the books.

Wait, but under the pre-existing duty rule, a modification isn't supported by consideration if each party is only doing what they were already obligated to do. Here, the owner was already contractually bound to buy 100 books at $10 each. The publisher's new demand is that the price increases, but the publisher isn't offering anything extra—just threatening not to deliver unless the owner pays more. So, the owner's agreement isn't supported by new consideration because the owner was already under a duty to pay $10. Therefore, the modification wouldn't be enforceable because there's no consideration.

But wait, what about the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)? Because this is a sale of goods—casebooks are goods—so the UCC applies. Under the UCC, modifications don't require consideration. Instead, a modification is enforceable if it's made in good faith. So, the issue would be whether the publisher's request was in good faith.

The publisher claims there was a calculation error. If that's true, then maybe the modification is done in good faith. But the problem is that the owner agreed reluctantly. So, the question is whether the agreement to pay $11 is enforceable under UCC.

I think under UCC 2-209, a contract can be modified without additional consideration as long as the modification is made in good faith. So, if the publisher made a genuine mistake in calculating the price, then their request to correct it would be in good faith. Therefore, the owner's agreement would be enforceable because it's a good faith modification.

Wait, but the original contract was written, so the statute of frauds is satisfied. So, the enforceability isn't an issue there. The question is more about whether the modification is valid.

So, looking at the options:

Option E says it's unenforceable because the increase wasn't agreed upon at contract formation. That's more of a common law perspective, which requires consideration for modifications.

Option F says it's enforceable because the owner agreed. But under common law, agreement alone isn't enough without consideration.

Option G says enforceable because the publisher had the right to correct their mistake. But I'm not sure if that's a right; it's more about good faith.

Option H is promissory estoppel, which is about relying on a promise to your detriment. But the owner agreed, so that might not apply.

Option I says enforceable because it's not supported by consideration. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If it's not supported by consideration, it's unenforceable. So I think Option I is incorrect.

Wait, the answer depends on whether we're under common law or UCC. Since it's a sale of goods, UCC applies. So, under UCC 2-209, a modification is enforceable if made in good faith, regardless of consideration.

So, if the publisher's calculation error was genuine, the modification would be in good faith, making the agreement enforceable. So the correct answer would be F: Enforceable because the owner agreed.

But wait, the owner agreed under duress because the publisher said they wouldn't deliver unless they agreed. So, is there any issue with duress? Well, in contract law, duress can make a contract unenforceable. But here, the original contract was for delivery, and the publisher is threatening not to deliver unless the price is changed. So, maybe the owner felt compelled to agree because they needed the books.

Hmm, but under UCC, even if there's duress, the modification must be in good faith. If the publisher was using coercive tactics, that might not be in good faith. Alternatively, if the calculation error was genuine, then the good faith exception applies.

But in the question, the publisher says there's a calculation error, so they're just correcting it. So, it's a question of fact whether the publisher was in good faith. But the options don't go into that; they just present possibilities.

Looking back, the options:

A: Unenforceable, original terms should prevail. But if it's a valid modification, the original terms don't apply.

B: Enforceable if publisher can prove calculation error. That's possible, but not necessarily the main issue.

C: Statute of frauds—probably not, since it's a written contract.

D: Unenforceable because error from publisher's mistake. No, that's not a reason.

E: Unenforceable because not agreed upon at contract. Common law view.

F: Enforceable because owner agreed.

G: Enforceable because publisher had right to correct mistake. Maybe, but more about good faith.

H: Promissory estoppel. Maybe, but the owner agreed, so not needed.

I: Enforceable without consideration. Under UCC, yes, but under common law, no.

So, the correct answer would depend on the jurisdiction. Since it's a sale of goods, UCC applies. So, if the publisher's mistake was in good faith, the modification is enforceable. Therefore, F or G.

But looking at the options, F says enforceable because the owner agreed. That seems more straightforward. So, the answer is F.
</think>

The scenario involves a contract for the sale of goods, which falls under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The original contract was written, satisfying the statute of frauds, and the issue revolves around whether the modification to increase the price from $10 to $11 per book is enforceable. Under UCC § 2-209, a modification is enforceable if made in good faith, regardless of whether new consideration is present. The publisher claimed a calculation error, which, if genuine, constitutes good faith. The owner's reluctant agreement does not invalidate the modification under UCC principles. Therefore, the agreement to pay $11 per book is enforceable because the owner agreed.

Answer: F
