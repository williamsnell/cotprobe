Question:

What are factors which affect concept attainment and how does each affect the learning of concepts?

Options:

A: The factors are the socioeconomic status of the student, the educational policies in place, and the consistency of teaching styles.
B: The factors include the pacing of the curriculum, the extracurricular activities of the student, and peer influence.
C: The factors which affect concept attainment are the dominance of cues in the stimuli, feedback and reinforcement after performance, and the selection and organization of information.
D: The factors are the student's genetic predispositions, the color of the classroom walls, and the seating arrangements.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about factors that affect concept attainment and how each affects learning. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what concept attainment means. From what I remember, concept attainment involves understanding and grasping abstract ideas or concepts. It's about how learners form these concepts through their experiences and interactions.

The question is asking which factors influence this process. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Socioeconomic status, educational policies, and teaching styles. Hmm, socioeconomic status can affect access to resources, which might influence learning, but does it directly impact concept attainment? Maybe indirectly, but I'm not sure if it's one of the primary factors. Educational policies could influence the structure of learning, but again, I'm not certain if these are the key factors for concept attainment.

Option B: Curriculum pacing, extracurriculars, and peer influence. Pacing could affect how well students grasp concepts if it's too fast or slow. Extracurriculars might affect overall engagement, but I'm not sure how directly they influence concept learning. Peer influence is more about social dynamics, which might affect motivation but not the actual process of concept formation.

Option C: Dominance of cues in stimuli, feedback, and information selection. This sounds more relevant. When stimuli have clear cues, it helps learners identify what's important. Feedback after performance helps reinforce correct understanding and corrects mistakes. Organizing information properly makes it easier to form concepts because it structures the data in a meaningful way.

Option D: Genetic predispositions, classroom colors, and seating. These seem less likely. While genes might influence learning abilities, they're not really factors that can be changed or addressed in teaching. Classroom colors and seating arrangements might affect comfort or engagement, but I don't think they're primary factors in concept attainment.

So, putting it together, option C seems to directly address the factors that influence how concepts are learned. The cues help in identifying relevant information, feedback reinforces learning, and organizing information aids in structuring the concept.

The factors that directly influence concept attainment are the dominance of cues in stimuli, which help identify relevant information; feedback and reinforcement, which reinforce correct understanding; and the selection and organization of information, which structure the concept effectively. These elements are crucial for effective learning of concepts.

Answer: C
