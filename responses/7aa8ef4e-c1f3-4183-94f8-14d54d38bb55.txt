Question:

A condominium development consists of two buildings, one with balconies attached to each unit, and one withno balconies. For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?

Options:

A: Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.
B: No, because the amendment was promptly recorded and is legally binding.
C: Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.
D: No, because the association is acting in the best interests of child safety.
E: No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.
F: No, because the association has the right to approve all sales.
G: No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.

Okay, so I have this question about fair housing laws and a condominium association's amendment. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: There are two buildings in a condo development. One has units with balconies, and the other doesn't. The association amended their covenants to prohibit selling balcony units to families with minor children. But this doesn't apply to families already living there. They recorded the amendment, which I think means it's legally binding since it's on record.

The key point is that the association had a covenant requiring all sales to be approved by them. After the amendment, an owner of a balcony unit agreed to sell it to a family with kids. But before closing, the association told the buyers they couldn't buy it because of the kids. They also mentioned that other units without balconies were available.

The buyers then complained to a fair housing agency, saying the amendment violates federal fair housing laws. The question is whether there's reasonable cause to believe a violation happened.

I remember that fair housing laws, like the Fair Housing Act, protect against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status. Familial status includes families with children.

So, the association's amendment is targeting sales to families with children. But wait, they're only prohibiting future sales to such families in balcony units, not affecting those already living there. Does this create a problem?

I think the issue is whether this constitutes a discriminatory practice. By refusing to sell to families with children, even if they can buy units without balconies, it might be segregating families with children into certain parts of the development. The Fair Housing Act doesn't allow such segregation.

Option C says yes because it's segregating families, which sounds plausible. But I'm also considering other options. Option E says no because families can buy units without balconies. But if the effect is that families are being steered away from certain units, that's still discrimination. The law doesn't allow steering based on familial status.

Also, the covenant was recorded, so it's enforceable, but the question is whether it's legal under fair housing laws. The association's right to approve sales (Option F) doesn't override the discrimination aspect. Similarly, safety concerns (Option G) might be a valid reason, but the question is whether it's a legitimate justification under fair housing.

I think the key is that the amendment discriminates against families with children by restricting their access to certain units, which is prohibited. So, there's reasonable cause to believe a violation occurred. Therefore, the answer is C.

The amendment discriminates against families with children by restricting their access to balcony units, which is prohibited under fair housing laws. Segregating families with children into units without balconies constitutes a violation. 

Answer: C
