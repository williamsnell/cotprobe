Okay, so I have this question about the submandibular salivary gland. The patient is suspected to have an enlarged gland, and I need to figure out where it would be palpable. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that there are three main salivary glands: the parotid, sublingual, and submandibular (also called submandibular). The submandibular glands are located in the neck, under the jaw. They're under the mandible, right? So when they're enlarged, I wonder where you can feel them.

I think the submandibular glands are usually palpable because they're in the neck area. But wait, can you feel them intraorally or extraorally? Let me recall. Intraoral palpation is inside the mouth, and extraoral is outside. The submandibular glands are deep, so maybe they're not easily felt from the inside. Or wait, sometimes you can feel the ducts inside the mouth. Oh, the Stensen's duct for the parotid, but that's a different one. Submandibular has its own ducts too, but maybe the gland itself is under the jaw.

If the gland is enlarged, you might be able to feel it when palpating the area below the jawline from the outside. That would be extraoral. But wait, can you also feel it from inside the mouth? Maybe not as easily because the gland is deeper. So maybe it's only extraoral.

Looking at the options, option G says "to be palpable extraorally." That seems right. Let me check the other options. Option B says both intra- and extraorally, but I don't think submandibular is felt inside the mouth. Parotid might be, but not submandibular. Option E says intraorally and detectable by radiography. Not sure about that. Option F is only intraoral, which I don't think is correct.

Other options like H mention ultrasound, but the question is about palpation, not imaging. So the best answer is G.

The submandibular salivary gland is located under the mandible. When enlarged, it is typically palpable extraorally, as it is deeper within the neck and not easily felt intraorally. Among the options provided, the correct choice is that the enlarged gland is palpable extraorally.

Answer: G
