Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about early-successional plant communities. Hmm, I remember that plant communities go through succession, right? Early successional stages are when the ecosystem is just starting to recover after a disturbance, like a fire or a landslide.

The question is asking which characteristic is true for an early-successional plant community. The options are A to J. Let me go through each one.

A: High detrital biomass. Detritus is like dead organic matter. Early on, maybe there's not a lot of dead stuff because the plants are just starting to grow. Maybe this is more in later stages when plants are dying and more debris is present. So probably not A.

B: High number of predatory species. Wait, plants aren't predators. This might refer to herbivores or something else. Maybe in later stages, higher diversity includes more predators, but early stages are more about pioneer species. So B might not be right.

C: High presence of fully matured plant species. Early successional plants are usually pioneer species, which are fast-growing and don't live long. Mature species would come later, like in climax communities. So C is probably not correct.

D: High frequency of R-selected species. R-selected species are those that produce a lot of offspring quickly and have high variability. Early successional plants are often R-selected because they can colonize quickly. So D sounds right.

E: High rates of soil nutrient depletion. Early plants might take up nutrients, but I'm not sure if it's high rates. Later stages might have more nutrient cycling, but maybe early stages are less efficient. Not sure, but E might not be it.

F: High diversity of plant species. Early stages are usually dominated by a few pioneer species, so diversity isn't high. Later stages have more species. So F is probably wrong.

G: High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass. Primary production is the rate of plant growth, and standing-crop is the biomass. In early stages, plants are small and fast-growing, so they might produce a lot relative to their biomass. I think this ratio is higher in early stages because plants are growing quickly but haven't built up much biomass yet. So G is a possibility.

H: High frequency of K-selected species. K-selected species are those that have low reproductive rates, are competitive, and take time to mature. They usually dominate in later successional stages. So H is probably not correct.

I: Low rates of photosynthesis. Early plants are usually good at photosynthesizing to grow quickly. So I is incorrect.

J: High niche divergence among co-occurring species. Niche divergence means species have different ecological roles. In early stages, there might be fewer species, so less divergence. Later stages have more species and more divergence. So J is probably not correct.

Now, between D and G. Let me think. R-selected species are common in early succession because they colonize quickly. So D is about the frequency of R-selected species, which should be high.

G is about the production-to-biomass ratio. In early succession, plants might have high growth rates (high production) but not a lot of biomass yet, so the ratio would be high. I've read that in early stages, plants are more productive relative to their biomass. So G could also be correct.

Wait, the question is about characteristics predicted for early-successional communities. I think both D and G could be correct, but I need to choose the best option.

Looking back, R-selected species are definitely a hallmark of early succession. So D is correct.

Alternatively, high ratios of primary production to standing-crop (G) might be another correct point, but I'm more confident about D. So I'll go with D.

The correct answer is D: High frequency of R-selected species. Early-successional plant communities are characterized by pioneer species that are R-selected, meaning they produce many offspring quickly and are adapted to colonize disturbed areas efficiently.

Answer: D
