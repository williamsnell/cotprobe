Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the total number of coins in Kate's collection. Let me read the problem again carefully.

Kate has a coin collection. She keeps 7 of the coins in a box, which is only 5% of her entire collection. The question is asking for the total number of coins she has. The options are A through J, with numbers like 14, 120, 70, etc. I need to find which one is the correct total.

Hmm, so let me break it down. She has 7 coins in a box, and that's 5% of her total collection. So, 7 is 5% of the total. I think I can set up an equation using percentages to solve for the total number.

I remember that percentages can be converted to decimals for calculations. So, 5% is the same as 0.05. So, if 7 is 5% of the total, that means 7 equals 0.05 multiplied by the total number of coins. Let me write that out:

7 = 0.05 * Total

To find the Total, I can rearrange the equation. If I divide both sides by 0.05, I should get the Total. So,

Total = 7 / 0.05

Let me calculate that. Dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20, because 1 divided by 0.05 is 20. So, 7 times 20 is 140. Wait, that seems right because 5% of 140 is 7.

Let me double-check my math to be sure. 5% of 140 is (5/100) * 140, which is (5 * 140)/100. 5 times 140 is 700, and 700 divided by 100 is 7. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, F is 140. So, the answer should be F.

The problem states that 7 coins represent 5% of the total collection. By converting 5% to a decimal (0.05), we set up the equation 7 = 0.05 * Total. Solving for Total gives us 140, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
