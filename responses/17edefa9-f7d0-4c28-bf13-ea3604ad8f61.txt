Okay, so I've got this problem about binary channels and making decisions based on received signals. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

First, the problem states that the cost of making the correct decisions is zero. So, if we decide d1 when x1 was sent, or d2 when x2 was sent, there's no cost. But if we make the wrong decision, there's a cost involved. Specifically, the cost of deciding d1 when x2 was sent (c(d1/x2)) is twice the cost of deciding d2 when x1 was sent (c(d2/x1)). So, c(d1/x2) = 2 * c(d2/x1). I'll need to keep that in mind because it affects the decision-making process.

Next, the probabilities given are:
- P(y1/x1) = 0.8, which means if x1 was sent, there's an 80% chance of receiving y1.
- P(y2/x2) = 0.6, so if x2 was sent, there's a 60% chance of receiving y2.
- P(x1) = 0.8, meaning x1 is more likely than x2 (since x2's probability must be 0.2).

The question asks what decision should be made when y1 is received (part a) and when y2 is received (part b).

I remember that in decision theory, especially with Bayesian approaches, we calculate the posterior probabilities of each symbol given the received signal and then choose the one that minimizes the expected cost.

Let's tackle part (a) first: when y1 is received.

I think I need to find the probabilities of x1 and x2 given y1. Using Bayes' theorem, P(x1|y1) = [P(y1|x1) * P(x1)] / P(y1). Similarly for P(x2|y1).

Wait, but I don't know P(y1) yet. So I'll compute that using the law of total probability.

P(y1) = P(y1|x1)*P(x1) + P(y1|x2)*P(x2). But what's P(y1|x2)? Oh, right, since when x2 is sent, y2 is received with probability 0.6, so P(y1|x2) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.

So P(y1) = (0.8 * 0.8) + (0.4 * 0.2) = 0.64 + 0.08 = 0.72.

Now, P(x1|y1) = (0.8 * 0.8) / 0.72 = 0.64 / 0.72 ≈ 0.8889.

And P(x2|y1) = (0.4 * 0.2) / 0.72 = 0.08 / 0.72 ≈ 0.1111.

So when y1 is received, the probability that x1 was sent is about 88.89%, and x2 was sent is about 11.11%.

Now, considering the costs. The cost structure is such that choosing d1 when x1 is correct (cost 0), but choosing d1 when x2 is sent has cost c(d1/x2) = 2 * c(d2/x1). Let's let c(d2/x1) = c, so c(d1/x2) = 2c.

Our goal is to minimize the expected cost. So for each possible decision given y1, we calculate the expected cost.

If we decide d1 when y1 is received, the expected cost is:

Cost = P(x2|y1) * c(d1/x2) + P(x1|y1) * c(d1/x1)

But c(d1/x1) is zero since it's the correct decision. So Cost = 0.1111 * 2c ≈ 0.2222c.

Alternatively, if we decide d2 when y1 is received, the expected cost is:

Cost = P(x1|y1) * c(d2/x1) + P(x2|y1) * c(d2/x2)

Again, c(d2/x2) is zero, so Cost = 0.8889 * c ≈ 0.8889c.

Comparing 0.2222c vs 0.8889c. Since 0.2222c < 0.8889c, deciding d1 would result in a lower expected cost. Therefore, when y1 is received, we should choose d1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the costs here. The cost when deciding d1 when x2 is present is 2c, and when deciding d2 when x1 is present is c. So, when y1 comes in, the options are to decide d1 or d2.

If I decide d1, the cost is 2c * P(x2|y1) = 2c*(0.1111) ≈ 0.222c.

If I decide d2, the cost is c * P(x1|y1) = c*(0.8889) ≈ 0.8889c.

So indeed, choosing d1 is better because 0.222c is less than 0.8889c.

Now, moving on to part (b): when y2 is received.

Again, I'll compute the posterior probabilities P(x1|y2) and P(x2|y2).

First, P(y2) = P(y2|x1)*P(x1) + P(y2|x2)*P(x2).

But wait, P(y2|x1) is the probability of receiving y2 when x1 is sent. From earlier, since P(y1|x1)=0.8, P(y2|x1)=1-0.8=0.2.

And P(y2|x2)=0.6, as given.

So P(y2) = (0.2 * 0.8) + (0.6 * 0.2) = 0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28.

Now, P(x1|y2) = [P(y2|x1)*P(x1)] / P(y2) = (0.2 * 0.8)/0.28 = 0.16 / 0.28 ≈ 0.5714.

Similarly, P(x2|y2) = [0.6 * 0.2] / 0.28 = 0.12 / 0.28 ≈ 0.4286.

So when y2 is received, the probability that x1 was sent is about 57.14%, and x2 is 42.86%.

Now, again, evaluating the expected cost for each possible decision.

If we decide d1 when y2 is received:

Cost = P(x2|y2) * c(d1/x2) + P(x1|y2) * c(d1/x1)

= P(x2|y2)*2c + P(x1|y2)*0

= 0.4286 * 2c ≈ 0.8572c.

If we decide d2 when y2 is received:

Cost = P(x1|y2)*c(d2/x1) + P(x2|y2)*0

= 0.5714 * c ≈ 0.5714c.

Comparing the two, 0.5714c is less than 0.8572c. So deciding d2 when y2 is received gives a lower expected cost.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when y2 is received, if we decide d2, we might be correct if x2 was sent, which has a higher probability than if x1 was sent. But the costs are involved too.

Alternatively, perhaps I should frame it in terms of the likelihood ratio and compare it to the cost ratio.

I think another way to approach this is by using the decision rule based on the posterior probabilities and the cost ratio.

The general decision rule is to choose the hypothesis (x1 or x2) that minimizes the expected cost. The threshold for deciding x1 over x2 can be found by comparing the cost ratio.

The cost ratio is c(d2/x1) / c(d1/x2) = c / (2c) = 1/2.

So, if the likelihood ratio (P(x1)/P(x2)) multiplied by the cost ratio is greater than 1, we decide x1; else, x2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to use the log-likelihood ratio approach with costs.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the risk ratio. The optimal decision is to choose the action that has the lower expected cost.

In part (b), when y2 is received, the expected cost for choosing d1 is 0.8572c, and for choosing d2 it's 0.5714c. So clearly, choosing d2 is better.

Wait, but wait another thing: when y2 is received, the probabilities are P(x1|y2) ≈ 0.5714 and P(x2|y2) ≈ 0.4286. So x1 is more likely than x2 given y2. But the cost of making a wrong decision when x1 is present is c, and when x2 is present, it's 2c.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the cost per probability.

So for deciding d2 (which corresponds to x2) when y2 is received, the cost is c * P(x1|y2) = 0.5714c.

For deciding d1 (x1) when y2 is received, the cost is 2c * P(x2|y2) = 0.8572c.

So again, d2 is better.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the cost assignments. Let me clarify:

c(d1/x2) is the cost of deciding d1 when x2 was sent. So when y2 is received and we decide d1, we pay 2c if x2 was sent (since P(x2|y2) is 0.4286). But when we decide d2, if x1 was sent, we pay c (since P(x1|y2) is 0.5714).

So the expected cost for d1 is 2c * 0.4286 ≈ 0.8572c.

Expected cost for d2 is c * 0.5714 ≈ 0.5714c.

So yes, d2 is better.

Wait, but another way to look at it: the cost of making a wrong decision when x1 is present is c, and when x2 is present, it's 2c. So perhaps the decision should be based on which choice has a lower expected cost.

In part (a), y1 comes in. We found that choosing d1 has a lower cost (0.2222c) than choosing d2 (0.8889c), so d1 is chosen.

In part (b), y2 comes in. Choosing d2 has lower cost (0.5714c) than choosing d1 (0.8572c), so d2 is chosen.

Wait, but wait, in part (b), when y2 is received, the posterior probability of x2 is lower than x1. So even though x1 is more likely, the cost of making a wrong decision when x2 is present is higher. So perhaps the decision depends on the balance between probability and cost.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the cost per probability.

For y2, the cost per unit probability for x1 is c / 0.5714 ≈ 1.75c per 1 probability.

For x2, the cost per unit probability is 2c / 0.4286 ≈ 4.666c per 1 probability.

Wait, that might not be the right way to look at it. Alternatively, the ratio of the costs to the probabilities.

I think another way is to use the decision threshold based on the cost ratio. The decision rule is to choose the hypothesis with the higher posterior odds multiplied by the cost ratio.

The posterior odds of x1 vs x2 given y is [P(x1|y)/P(x2|y)] = [P(x1)P(y|x1)] / [P(x2)P(y|x2)].

The cost ratio is c(d2/x1) / c(d1/x2) = c/(2c) = 0.5.

So, the decision rule is to choose x1 if the posterior odds > cost ratio, else choose x2.

So for part (a), y1 received:

Posterior odds = [0.8 * 0.8] / [0.2 * 0.4] = (0.64) / (0.08) = 8.

Since 8 > 0.5, choose x1, which corresponds to decision d1.

For part (b), y2 received:

Posterior odds = [0.8 * 0.2] / [0.2 * 0.6] = (0.16)/(0.12) ≈ 1.333.

Compare to cost ratio 0.5. Since 1.333 > 0.5, choose x1, which is d1.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where choosing d2 was better in terms of cost. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I confused the direction of the cost ratio. Let me clarify.

The decision rule is to choose x1 if the posterior odds * (cost of wrong decision for x2 / cost of wrong decision for x1) > 1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

If P(x1|y) * c(d1/x2) > P(x2|y) * c(d2/x1), choose x1; else, choose x2.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct threshold is based on the ratio of costs.

Let me think again. The optimal decision is to choose the action that minimizes the expected cost. So, for each received y, we compare the expected cost of choosing d1 versus d2.

Alternatively, the decision can be made by comparing the likelihood ratio to the cost ratio.

The general decision rule is:

If (P(x1|y) / P(x2|y)) > (c(d2/x1) / c(d1/x2)), choose x1; else, choose x2.

In this case, c(d2/x1) is c, c(d1/x2) is 2c, so their ratio is 1/2.

So, for part (a), y1 received:

P(x1|y1)/P(x2|y1) ≈ 0.8889 / 0.1111 ≈ 8.

Which is greater than 1/2, so choose x1 (d1).

For part (b), y2 received:

P(x1|y2)/P(x2|y2) ≈ 0.5714 / 0.4286 ≈ 1.333.

Which is greater than 1/2, so choose x1 (d1).

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the expected cost, choosing d2 when y2 is received had a lower expected cost than choosing d1. So now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the direction. Let me re-examine.

When y2 is received, the posterior probabilities are P(x1|y2) ≈ 0.5714 and P(x2|y2) ≈ 0.4286.

If I decide d1 (x1), the expected cost is 2c * P(x2|y2) = 2c * 0.4286 ≈ 0.8572c.

If I decide d2 (x2), the expected cost is c * P(x1|y2) = c * 0.5714 ≈ 0.5714c.

Since 0.5714c < 0.8572c, deciding d2 is better. So why is the decision rule suggesting to choose x1?

Ah, I think I might have the decision rule backwards. Let me re-express it correctly.

The decision rule should be: choose x1 if P(x1|y) * c(d2/x1) < P(x2|y) * c(d1/x2).

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of the expected cost.

Expected cost of choosing x1 (d1) is c(d1/x1) * P(x1|y) + c(d1/x2) * P(x2|y).

But c(d1/x1) is 0, so it's just c(d1/x2) * P(x2|y).

Similarly, expected cost of choosing x2 (d2) is c(d2/x1) * P(x1|y) + c(d2/x2) * P(x2|y).

But c(d2/x2) is 0, so it's c(d2/x1) * P(x1|y).

So, compare c(d1/x2) * P(x2|y) vs c(d2/x1) * P(x1|y).

If c(d1/x2) * P(x2|y) < c(d2/x1) * P(x1|y), choose x1 (d1), else choose x2 (d2).

In part (a), y1:

c(d1/x2) * P(x2|y1) = 2c * 0.1111 ≈ 0.2222c.

c(d2/x1) * P(x1|y1) = c * 0.8889 ≈ 0.8889c.

Since 0.2222c < 0.8889c, choose x1 (d1).

In part (b), y2:

c(d1/x2) * P(x2|y2) = 2c * 0.4286 ≈ 0.8572c.

c(d2/x1) * P(x1|y2) = c * 0.5714 ≈ 0.5714c.

Since 0.8572c > 0.5714c, it's better to choose x2 (d2).

Ah, so I must have made a mistake earlier when applying the decision rule. The correct decision is to choose x2 when the expected cost of choosing x1 is higher, which is the case here.

So, putting it all together:

(a) When y1 is received, decide d1.

(b) When y2 is received, decide d2.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: (a) d1, (b) d1 → No, because part (b) is d2.

Option B: (a) d2, (b) d2 → No, because part (a) is d1.

Option D: (a) d2, (b) d1 → No.

Option H: (a) d1, (b) d2 → Yes, that's what we have.

Wait, option H is (a) d1, (b) d2.

So the correct answer should be H.

     \]
     \[
     P(x_2|y_2) = \frac{P(y_2/x_2)P(x_2)}{P(y_2)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} \approx 0.4286
     \]
   - Expected costs:
     - Choosing \( d_1 \): \( 2c \cdot 0.4286 \approx 0.8572c \).
     - Choosing \( d_2 \): \( c \cdot 0.5714 \approx 0.5714c \).
   - Optimal decision: Choose \( d_2 \) as it has the lower expected cost.
