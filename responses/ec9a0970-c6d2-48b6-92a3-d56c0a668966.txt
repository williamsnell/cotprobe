Okay, so I've got this question about ferromagnetic materials and how their magnetization relates to the applied magnetic field. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that ferromagnetism is different from other magnetic materials. Let me think.

I know that in paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, the magnetization is usually proportional to the magnetic field. Oh wait, that's B-H curve for linear materials. So, like, for a linear relationship, it's H equals some constant times B, or something like that. But ferromagnetic materials are different.

Ferromagnetic materials have domains where the magnetic moments are aligned. When you apply a magnetic field, these domains get more aligned, and the magnetization increases. But I think this isn't a straight-line relationship. Oh right, the B-H curve for ferromagnets is nonlinear. It starts to saturate at higher fields. So the magnetization doesn't increase linearly with the applied field; instead, it becomes more curved or maybe even levels off.

Wait, the options are about how magnetization and applied field are related. So the question is about the relationship between M and H, maybe. Or is it B and H? I think in ferromagnets, the relationship between B and H isn't linear. Because B includes the magnetization M plus the H field itself. So B = Î¼0(H + M) or something like that, but for ferromagnets, M doesn't increase linearly with H.

So options: A is linear, which I don't think is right. B is cubic, which sounds too steep. C is parabolic, like a quadratic curve. D is logarithmic, which would mean it increases slowly, but I don't think that's the case here. E is hyperbolic, which is like 1/x, not matching. F is inverse, so M decreasing as H increases, which isn't right. G is sinusoidal, like a wave, but magnetization doesn't oscillate with H. H is non-linear, which seems correct. I is exponential, which would be a very rapid increase, but I think it's more like a saturation. J is quadratic, so M proportional to H squared.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The B-H curve for ferromagnets is definitely non-linear. It starts with a steep slope and then flattens out as it approaches saturation. So the relationship isn't linear. So the correct answer should be H: non-linearly.

I think I'm pretty sure about that. So the answer is H.

The magnetisation and applied field in ferromagnetic materials are related non-linearly.

Answer: H
