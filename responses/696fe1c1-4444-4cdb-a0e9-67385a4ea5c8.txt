Okay, so I've got this question about population growth terms. The question is asking about the tendency for a population to keep growing even after replacement fertility has been achieved. Hmm, I remember that replacement fertility is when the birth rate equals the death rate, so the population stabilizes. But sometimes, even after that, the population might still grow for a while.

I need to think about the terms related to population dynamics. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Homeostatic plateau. Homeostasis is about maintaining a stable state, so a plateau would be a flat line on a graph. I'm not sure if this is the right term here because the population is still growing, just after replacement fertility.

Option B: Demographic imbalance. That sounds like when there's a mismatch between birth and death rates, but I'm not sure if it's the same as continuing growth after replacement.

Option C: Population inertia. Inertia implies a tendency to keep moving in the same direction. So if the population was growing, it might continue to grow despite changes, like after replacement fertility. That sounds plausible.

Option D: Demographic momentum. Momentum suggests ongoing movement. I think this refers to the continuation of growth even after the factors that caused it (like high birth rates) have changed. So if replacement fertility is achieved, but the population keeps growing because of past high birth rates, that's demographic momentum.

Option E: Rapid growth rate. That's more about the speed rather than the continuation after a certain point.

Option F: Zero population growth. That would be when the population isn't growing at all, so opposite of what's happening here.

Option G: Fertility transition. That's about the process of fertility rates changing, like from high to low. But the question is about the tendency to continue growing after replacement.

Option H: Fertility momentum. Similar to demographic momentum, but I think it's more specific to fertility rates rather than the overall population growth.

Option I: Demographic transition. This refers to the process of moving from high birth and death rates to lower ones, which is a broader concept, not the specific inertia after replacement.

So, putting it together, the question is about the population continuing to grow after replacement fertility. I think the key term here is demographic momentum, which captures the idea that even after fertility rates drop, the population might still grow because of the age structure, especially a large number of people in reproductive ages. Alternatively, population inertia could also fit, as it's about the tendency to keep growing.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between C and D. Let me think again. Population inertia is more about the momentum of the population's growth due to factors like age distribution. Demographic momentum specifically refers to the continuation of growth after the factors (like high birth rates) have changed. So in this case, after replacement fertility (which is when birth rates equal death rates), the population might still grow because of the age structureâ€”like a lot of young people entering their reproductive years. That sounds like demographic momentum.

So the answer should be D: demographic momentum.

The tendency for a population to continue growing long after replacement fertility has been achieved is best described by the term "demographic momentum." This occurs because even after birth rates stabilize or decline, the existing age structure of the population can lead to continued growth. Factors such as a large number of individuals in reproductive ages contribute to this momentum. 

Answer: D
