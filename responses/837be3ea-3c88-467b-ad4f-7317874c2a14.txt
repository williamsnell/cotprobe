Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about power in an AC series RC circuit. Hmm, the question says that the load dissipates 1.5kW of power, and the power factor is 0.75. I need to find the reactive power (Pr) and the apparent power (Pa), and then list them in order [Pr, Pa] with units kVAR and kVA respectively.

First, I remember that in AC circuits, the power factor (PF) is the ratio of real power (P) to apparent power (S). So, PF = P / S. I know P is given as 1.5kW, which is 1500W, but since the options are in kilo units, I'll work in kVA and kVAR.

Wait, wait. The real power is the actual power dissipated, which is 1.5kW. The power factor here is 0.75, which is less than 1, so the circuit is inductive, meaning the reactive power is inductive (but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation here).

I think the formula I need is:
PF = P_real / P_apparent

Rearranging that, P_apparent = P_real / PF.

So, P_apparent = 1.5kW / 0.75.

Let me calculate that: 1.5 divided by 0.75 is 2. So, the apparent power is 2kVA.

Now, reactive power (Q) can be found using the formula:
Q = sqrt(P_apparent^2 - P_real^2)

Wait, or is it P_apparent squared equals P_real squared plus Q squared? Yes, because P_apparent is the hypotenuse in the power triangle. So,

P_apparent² = P_real² + Q².

Rearranging, Q² = P_apparent² - P_real².

Plugging in the numbers:

Q² = (2)^2 - (1.5)^2 = 4 - 2.25 = 1.75.

So Q is the square root of 1.75. Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(1.75) is approximately 1.322876... So, about 1.32 kVAR.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, I could have used the formula Q = P_real * tan(theta), where theta is the phase angle. Because PF is cos(theta), so tan(theta) = sqrt(1 - PF²) / PF. But maybe that's more complicated. The first method seems easier.

So, the reactive power is approximately 1.32 kVAR, and the apparent power is 2.0 kVA.

Looking at the options, option B is [1.32, 2.0], which matches my calculations. Let me double-check the options:

Option B: [1.32, 2.0] → Yes, that's what I got.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the reactive power is represented as Q = S * sin(theta), where S is the apparent power. Let me check that.

Yes, because S = P_real / cos(theta), and Q = S * sin(theta). Alternatively, since tan(theta) = Q / P_real, so Q = P_real * tan(theta).

Given that PF is 0.75, which is cos(theta), so sin(theta) would be sqrt(1 - 0.75²) = sqrt(1 - 0.5625) = sqrt(0.4375) ≈ 0.6614.

Then, Q = P_real * sin(theta) = 1.5 * 0.6614 ≈ 0.9921, which is approximately 0.99 kVAR. Wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, no. I think I confused the approach here. Let me clarify: the apparent power S is the vector sum of P_real and Q. So, S = sqrt(P_real² + Q²). Alternatively, S = P_real / PF.

Wait, so S is 2.0 kVA as calculated before. Then, Q = sqrt(S² - P_real²) = sqrt(4 - 2.25) = sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.322 kVAR.

Wait, but using the other method with sin(theta), I'm getting a different value. That can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Let me re-calculate.

PF = cos(theta) = 0.75 → theta = arccos(0.75), so sin(theta) would be sqrt(1 - 0.75²) = sqrt(0.4375) ≈ 0.6614. Then, Q = S * sin(theta). But S is 2.0, so Q = 2 * 0.6614 ≈ 1.3228 kVAR. Oh, that matches the earlier result! So both methods agree.

Wait, so earlier when I thought I got 0.99, I must have made a mistake. No, wait, I think I used P_real * sin(theta), which would be 1.5 * 0.6614 ≈ 0.9921. But that's not correct because Q is S * sin(theta), not P_real * sin(theta). So that's where I went wrong. So the correct approach is to calculate S first, then find Q using S and sin(theta). So the correct Q is about 1.322 kVAR.

So the reactive power is approximately 1.32 kVAR, and the apparent power is 2.0 kVA. So the answer should be [1.32, 2.0], which is option B.

The reactive power \( P_r \) is calculated using the apparent power \( P_a \) and the real power \( P \) with the formula \( P_r = \sqrt{P_a^2 - P^2} \). Given \( P = 1.5 \, \text{kW} \) and \( \text{PF} = 0.75 \), the apparent power \( P_a \) is \( 2.0 \, \text{kVA} \). Substituting into the formula, \( P_r = \sqrt{2.0^2 - 1.5^2} = \sqrt{1.75} \approx 1.32 \, \text{kVAR} \). Thus, the reactive and apparent powers are \( [1.32, 2.0] \).
