Question:

 Select the best translation into predicate logic. Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy. (i: Italy; m: Marco; s: Spain; Mxyz: x moves to y from z)

Options:

A: ~Mis
B: Msi~
C: M~ism
D: ~Mmis
E: M~mis
F: ~Mmsi
G: M~si
H: M~msi
I: Mims~

Okay, so I've got this predicate logic translation question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The sentence to translate is: "Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy." The options are given as A through I, each with a different logical expression. The symbols used are Mxyz, where x moves to y from z. So, Mxyz would mean "x moves to y from z." 

First, I need to break down the sentence. The subject is Marco, so in predicate terms, he would be represented by 'm'. The action is "doesn't move," which is the negation of moving. The locations are Spain and Italy; Spain is where he's moving from, and Italy is where he's moving to. So, Spain is 's' and Italy is 'i'.

Putting this together, the original statement without negation would be that Marco moves from Spain to Italy. In predicate terms, that would be M(m, i, s) because the format is Mxyz where x is the person, y is the destination, and z is the origin. So M(m, i, s) translates to "Marco moves to Italy from Spain."

But the original sentence says he doesn't move, so we need to negate this statement. In predicate logic, negating a predicate would be placing a negation symbol in front of it. So the negation of M(m, i, s) would be ~M(m, i, s).

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. The options are:

A: ~Mis
B: Msi~
C: M~ism
D: ~Mmis
E: M~mis
F: ~Mmsi
G: M~si
H: M~msi
I: Mims~

Wait, the way they're written is a bit confusing. Each option is a string, but I think each letter represents variables. Let me parse them correctly. For example, option A is ~Mis. The predicate M is followed by 'i', 's'. So that would be M(i, s) which doesn't make sense because Marco is 'm'. 

Option B: Msi~. That would be M(s, i, ~), which doesn't make sense because the last part is a tilde, which is a negation operator, not a variable. So that's probably incorrect.

Option C: M~ism. Hmm, maybe the notation is that each position after M is a variable or a negation. So M~ism could be M(~i, s, m)? That doesn't quite fit. Wait, maybe the notation is that the variables are in order x, y, z, so Mxyz is M(x, y, z). So for the original statement, we have M(m, i, s). The negation is ~M(m, i, s). So looking for ~M followed by m, i, s.

Looking at the options, option D is ~Mmis. Let me parse that: ~M(m, i, s) because 'mis' would be m, i, s. So D is ~M(m, i, s), which is exactly what we want.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option F is ~Mmsi. That would be ~M(m, s, i), which is "Marco doesn't move from Italy to Spain," which is the opposite of what we want. So F is incorrect.

Option D is ~Mmis, which is ~M(m, i, s), which is correct because it's negating Marco moving from Spain (s) to Italy (i). 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the order. The predicate is Mxyz, which is x moves to y from z. So in M(m, i, s), m is x (the one moving), i is y (destination), s is z (origin). So the correct negation is ~M(m, i, s), which is option D.

So the answer should be D.

The correct translation of "Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy" into predicate logic is ~M(m, i, s), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
