Okay, so I've got this question about attachment styles in infants, and I need to figure out what the right answer is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a 20-month-old child who is acting a certain way with her mother. The child is clinging nervously to her mother and doesn't want to explore a new play environment. Then, she suddenly pushes her mother away and doesn't engage in any hugs her mother tries to give. The baby shows anxiety on her face but looks away from her mother. The mother also turns away from the baby.

Hmm, I remember that attachment styles in children are categorized into secure and insecure types. Secure attachment is when the child has a strong bond with the caregiver and feels confident exploring the environment when the caregiver is present. Insecure attachments can be further divided into resistant (anxious-ambivalent), avoidant (anxious-avoidant), or disorganized attachments.

In this case, the child initially clings to her mother, which might suggest some anxiety. But then she pushes her away when her mother tries to hug her. That's interesting because it seems like she wants to be close but then resists when the mother gets too close. 

The child's facial expression shows anxiety, but she looks away. So she's showing signs of distress but also avoiding eye contact. The mother turning away might be a response to the child's behavior, possibly feeling rejected or confused.

I think this is leaning towards an insecure attachment. Now, within insecure attachments, there are different types. Insecure-resistant (or anxious-ambivalent) children often show clingy behavior, get distressed when separated, and may resist comforting. But they also show anger or frustration when the caregiver leaves. 

In this scenario, the child is not necessarily being clingy all the time; she's more ambivalent. She clings but then pushes away, which might be a sign of resistance. The fact that she looks away could indicate a desire to avoid closeness, which is more in line with avoidant behavior. But wait, avoidant kids usually don't seek comfort much and might avoid the caregiver. Here, the child is initially seeking proximity but then pushing them away.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: Insecure-avoidant attachment is when the child doesn't seek much comfort from the caregiver, shows little emotion when the caregiver leaves, and might not show much interest in exploring either. They seem more detached.

Insecure-resistant (or resistant) children do want to be close but show resistance when the caregiver tries to comfort them. They might push the caregiver away but then become upset if the caregiver leaves. They are more anxious and ambivalent, wanting closeness but also resisting it.

So in the question, the child is clinging at first, showing some need for proximity, but then when the mother tries to engage, she pushes her away. That seems like resistance to the mother's comforting. Also, the child's anxiety and looking away might indicate that she wants to avoid the situation or the mother's advances, which fits the resistant or avoidant categories.

Wait, but looking away can also be a sign of ambivalence. The mother turning away might be a reaction to the child's behavior, perhaps feeling the child doesn't want her, leading her to withdraw.

Putting this together, the child's behavior seems to be a mix of seeking and resisting, which points towards an insecure-resistant (anxious-ambivalent) attachment. But I'm a bit torn because sometimes looking away could be seen as avoidant behavior.

Alternatively, could it be avoidant? Insecure-avoidant children might not show much interest in the caregiver and might avoid eye contact more consistently. Here, the child does look at the mother initially but then looks away when the mother tries to hug.

Wait, the mother turning away too could be part of the interaction. If the mother is also turning away, that might influence the child's behavior, but the initial problem is about the child's attachment.

I think the key here is the child's behavior of pushing the mother away when she tries to hug, which is a sign of resistance. So I'm leaning towards Insecure resistant, which is option D.

The child exhibits a mix of seeking and resisting behavior towards her mother, which is characteristic of an insecure-resistant (anxious-ambivalent) attachment. She initially clings to her mother but then resists when the mother tries to comfort her, showing a pattern of ambivalence. The child's anxiety and looking away suggest a desire to avoid closeness, while the mother's turning away may be a response to the child's resistance. This behavior aligns with the insecure-resistant attachment style.

Answer: D
