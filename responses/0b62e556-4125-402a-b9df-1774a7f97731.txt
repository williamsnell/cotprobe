Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about natural selection and the smallest unit it can change. The question is a multiple-choice with options A through J. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that acts on traits to influence the frequency of alleles in a population. It's the process where certain traits become more or less common over generations because they affect an organism's survival and reproductive success.

The question is asking for the smallest unit that natural selection can change. So I need to think about what the smallest possible unit is that natural selection can act upon. I'm pretty sure it's not the individual because natural selection doesn't directly act on a single organism; it's more about the traits within the population.

Wait, no, actually, I think natural selection can act on individuals. Because individuals with certain phenotypes may leave more offspring, affecting the gene pool. But maybe the smallest unit isn't the individual but something smaller within them.

Wait, the options include things like genotype, phenotype, gene frequency, etc. Let me list the options again:

A: individual's phenotype  
B: individual's genotype  
C: population's phenotype  
D: species' genome  
E: species' genotype  
F: species' gene frequency  
G: cell's gene frequency  
H: individual's genome  
I: population's gene frequency  
J: population's genotype

So the question is about the smallest unit. Let's think about the hierarchy. Natural selection can affect the survival and reproduction of individuals, which in turn affects the population's gene frequencies.

I remember that natural selection works on the phenotype because that's what's visible and affects an organism's survival and reproduction. But the actual unit that natural selection changes is the gene frequencies in the population.

Wait, but the smallest unit—so the most basic unit. Genes are the units of selection in some contexts, but natural selection doesn't directly act on genes. Instead, it's the phenotype that's selected. But when it comes to the unit of change, it's the allele frequencies in the population.

Wait, but the options are about what natural selection can change. The smallest unit would be the individual's genotype, because a genotype is a set of alleles in an individual. But wait, natural selection affects the fitness of individuals, which affects the allele frequencies in the population. So the smallest unit that natural selection changes is the allele frequency in the population.

Wait, but the options are about the unit that natural selection can change. So the smallest unit would be the allele. But allele isn't an option here. Wait, looking back, the options don't have allele as an option. The options are about units like individual's genotype, population's gene frequency, etc.

So the smallest unit would be the individual's genotype because that's the smallest possible unit—each individual has a genotype, which can be changed by selection. But wait, natural selection doesn't change individual genotypes directly; it changes the frequency of genotypes in a population over time.

Hmm. So maybe the correct answer is I: population's gene frequency because that's the smallest unit that can be changed by natural selection, as it's a measure of allele frequencies in the population. Alternatively, some sources say that natural selection can act on the individual level, but the unit of change is the population's gene frequencies.

Wait, another angle: the smallest unit that natural selection can change would be the genotype of an individual. Because each individual's genotype can be altered by selection. But no, selection doesn't change individual genotypes directly; it changes the distribution of genotypes in the population.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what each option represents. Natural selection affects the survival and reproductive success of individuals, which in turn affects the allele frequencies in the population. So the unit that changes is the population's gene frequency.

So the smallest unit would be the population's gene frequency (option I), because that's the level where the changes accumulate. Alternatively, if we consider that each individual's genotype can change, but that's not a population-level change.

Wait, but the question is about the smallest unit. So the smallest unit would be the individual's genotype, but natural selection doesn't directly change individual genotypes; it changes the frequencies in the population. So perhaps the correct answer is I: population's gene frequency because that's the smallest unit that can be changed by natural selection.

Alternatively, the individual's genotype is a unit, but it's not the smallest in terms of the effect of selection. Because selection affects the population's allele frequencies.

Wait, but the options are about the unit that natural selection can change. So if the question is about the smallest unit, the individual's genotype is smaller than the population's gene frequency. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the unit of selection is the individual, but the unit that changes is the population's gene frequency. Because individual genotypes determine their fitness, but the actual change is in the gene pool.

So perhaps the answer is I: population's gene frequency.

The question asks for the smallest unit that natural selection can change. Natural selection acts on traits that affect an organism's survival and reproductive success, which influences the frequency of alleles in a population. While natural selection can affect individual phenotypes and genotypes, the smallest unit of change is the population's gene frequency, as this reflects the cumulative effect of selection across individuals.
