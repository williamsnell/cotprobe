Okay, so I've got this question about which group was converted to Christianity in the tenth century AD by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out the right one.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about the Byzantine Empire and missionary activities. The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, was centered in Constantinople and was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East. They were significant in spreading Christianity, especially after the Great Schism, but before that, they had missionaries going out.

The question is specifically about the tenth century. Let me think about each option and when they converted.

Option A: Ostrogoths. I think the Ostrogoths were a Germanic group. They were part of the Gothic tribes that migrated into the Roman Empire. I remember that the Visigoths converted to Arian Christianity in the 4th century, but the Ostrogoths were different. They were also part of the Gothic groups but maybe converted later? Or perhaps by someone else, not Byzantine.

Option B: Russians. The Russians, or the Rus', were a group that settled in what's now Russia. I think their conversion to Christianity was much later, around the 10th century, but was it the Byzantines? I recall that in 988 AD, Grand Prince Vladimir of Kiev converted to Christianity, which was the Byzantine form (Eastern Orthodoxy), so that's the Russian conversion. So this might be the correct answer, but let me check the others.

Option C: Moors. The Moors were Muslim, and their conversion would be from paganism or other religions to Islam, not Christianity. Plus, the Moors were in the Iberian Peninsula, and their conversion was more to Islam, so probably not this one.

Option D: Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxons in England were converted to Christianity earlier, like the 6th or 7th century, through missionaries from Rome, like St. Augustine. So that's before the tenth century and not Byzantine.

Option E: Visigoths. The Visigoths were another Gothic group. They were in the Iberian Peninsula and converted to Christianity earlier, but I think they were Arian and later converted to Roman Catholicism when the Visigoths were in Spain, but that's in the 6th or 7th century, not the tenth, and not from Byzantine missionaries.

Option F: Celts. The Celts in Britain and Ireland were converted to Christianity much earlier, like the Roman times or the early Middle Ages, via Roman missionaries or Irish ones. So not in the tenth century via Byzantines.

Option G: Huns. The Huns were a nomadic group that swept through Europe in the 4th and 5th centuries. I don't think they were converted to Christianity in the tenth century; more likely, they were either pagans or converted to other faiths earlier.

Option H: Vandals. The Vandals were another Germanic tribe. They were in North Africa and later moved to Gaul. I think they were Arians and not converted by Byzantines in the tenth century.

Option I: Normans. The Normans were a Viking people who settled in Normandy. They became Christian, but I think their conversion was earlier, maybe in the 9th or 10th century, but not via Byzantine missionaries. They were more influenced by the Frankish or English church.

Option J: Franks. The Franks were in Gaul, and their conversion was earlier, through the Roman Church, not Byzantine. Clovis I converted to Catholic Christianity in the 5th century.

So, going back, the Russians (Option B) were converted in the 10th century by Byzantine missionaries. I remember that the Byzantine Empire sent missionaries to the Slavic people, including the Rus', and that's when they adopted Eastern Orthodoxy. So the correct answer should be B: Russians.

The correct answer is B: Russians. They were converted to Christianity in the tenth century AD by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire.
