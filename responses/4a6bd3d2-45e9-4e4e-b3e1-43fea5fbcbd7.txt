Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a soil sample weighing 0.4210 grams is analyzed, and it contains a mixture of KCl and NaCl, which together weigh 0.0699 grams. From the KCl, 0.060 grams of AgCl precipitate is formed. The question is asking for the percentage of KCl in the soil.

Hmm, right. So, I think the approach here is to figure out how much KCl is present in the soil sample based on the precipitation reaction. Then, we can calculate its percentage.

First, I remember that when KCl reacts with AgNO3, it forms AgCl precipitate. The reaction equation should be something like:

KCl + AgNO3 → AgCl↓ + KNO3

So, the moles of AgCl precipitated should be equal to the moles of KCl present, assuming excess AgNO3 is used.

Given that the mass of AgCl is 0.060 grams, I can find the moles of AgCl. The molar mass of AgCl is Ag (107.87 g/mol) + Cl (35.45 g/mol) = 143.32 g/mol.

Moles of AgCl = mass / molar mass = 0.060 g / 143.32 g/mol ≈ 0.0004186 mol.

Since each mole of AgCl corresponds to one mole of KCl, the moles of KCl are also 0.0004186 mol.

Now, the molar mass of KCl is K (39.10 g/mol) + Cl (35.45 g/mol) = 74.55 g/mol.

Mass of KCl = moles × molar mass = 0.0004186 mol × 74.55 g/mol ≈ 0.03123 grams.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the mixture of KCl and NaCl weighs 0.0699 grams. So, the total mass of KCl and NaCl is 0.0699 g. We've found that the KCl is 0.03123 g, so the NaCl must be 0.0699 g - 0.03123 g = 0.03867 g.

But maybe that's not necessary for finding the percentage of KCl in the soil. The soil's total mass is 0.4210 grams, and the KCl mass is 0.03123 grams. So, the percentage is (0.03123 / 0.4210) × 100%.

Let me do that calculation.

0.03123 / 0.4210 ≈ 0.07415, so 7.415%. Looking at the options, option C is 7.41%, which seems close enough.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might make a calculation error.

Molar mass of AgCl: Ag is 107.87, Cl is 35.45. Sum is 143.32. Correct.

Moles of AgCl: 0.060 / 143.32. Let me compute this more accurately. 0.060 divided by 143.32. So, 143.32 × 0.0004 is 0.057328, which is less than 0.060. Let me compute 0.060 / 143.32.

Using a calculator, 0.060 ÷ 143.32 = approximately 0.0004185 mol. So that's correct.

Moles of KCl = 0.0004185 mol.

Molar mass of KCl is 74.55 g/mol. So 0.0004185 × 74.55 = let's compute this.

0.0004185 × 74.55:

First, 0.0004 × 74.55 = 0.02982.

Then, 0.0000185 ×74.55 ≈ 0.001378.

Adding them together, 0.02982 + 0.001378 ≈ 0.0312 grams.

So, mass of KCl is 0.0312 grams.

Now, percentage in the soil: (0.0312 / 0.4210) ×100.

0.0312 / 0.4210 ≈ 0.0741, so 7.41%.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.41%, so that's the answer.

The problem involves determining the percentage of KCl in a soil sample based on the precipitation of AgCl. By calculating moles of AgCl, equating them to moles of KCl, and then finding the mass of KCl, the percentage is derived as 7.41%.
