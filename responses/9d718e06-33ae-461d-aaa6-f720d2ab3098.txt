Okay, so I have this question about Kant's view on laws of nature and laws of freedom. I'm a bit rusty on my Kant, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Kant made a distinction between the realm of nature and the realm of freedom. In his philosophy, there's a dichotomy between what happens according to natural laws and what happens because of free will.

Laws of nature, as I understand them, are deterministic. They describe how things must happen. So, for example, if you drop a apple, it will fall due to gravity. That's a law of natureâ€”it's about what must happen, what is necessary.

On the other hand, laws of freedom are about free will. These are not deterministic. Instead, they're about what ought to happen. They are principles of freedom, like the moral law, which tells us what we should do, not what we will inevitably do.

So, putting it together, laws of nature are about what will happen (because they're causal, necessary), and laws of freedom are about what ought to happen (because they're based on oughts, like moral imperatives).

Looking at the options:

Option C says: everything will happen; everything ought to happen. Wait, that can't be right because it's pairing both as will happen and ought to happen, but I think nature is about what will, and freedom is about what ought.

Option D: everything ought to happen; everything will happen. That seems to reverse it. Nature would be what will happen, freedom what ought.

Wait, no, the question is: laws of nature are according to which ____, and laws of freedom are according to which ____.

So the first blank is for nature, second for freedom.

So, nature is about what must happen, so "everything will happen" under natural laws. Freedom is about what we should do, so "everything ought to happen" under moral laws.

Wait, but that would mean both blanks are filled with everything will/ought. Let me check the options again.

Option C: everything will happen; everything ought to happen. So, first part is nature, second is freedom. That fits.

Wait, but I've read that natural laws are about necessity, so they determine what must happen, i.e., what will happen. And freedom is about the ought, the moral law.

So, yes, that would make option C the correct one: everything will happen; everything ought to happen.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another option might say the opposite. Let me think again.

If the laws of nature are about what must happen, then it's about what will happen. Laws of freedom are about what should happen, so what ought to happen.

So the correct pairing is: laws of nature are laws according to which everything will happen, and laws of freedom are according to which everything ought to happen. So option C.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have mixed up. Because when Kant talks about freedom, he's saying that within nature (which is deterministic), there's also freedom. So the laws of freedom are about what we can do, which would be what we ought to do.

Alternatively, maybe the first part is what must happen (will), and the second is what can happen, but that's not one of the options. The options are all about will or ought.

I'm pretty confident that the answer is C: everything will happen; everything ought to happen.

According to Kant, laws of nature are deterministic and describe what must happen, while laws of freedom pertain to moral imperatives and what ought to happen. This aligns with option C, which states that laws of nature are according to which everything will happen, and laws of freedom are according to which everything ought to happen.

Answer: C
