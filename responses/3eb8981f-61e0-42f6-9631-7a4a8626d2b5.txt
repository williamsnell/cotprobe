Okay, so I need to figure out what 32 multiplied by 67 is. Hmm, let me think about the best way to approach this. I remember that when multiplying two numbers, breaking them down can make it easier. Maybe I can use the standard multiplication method or break it into parts.

Let me try breaking it down. 32 times 67. I can think of 67 as 60 plus 7. So, 32 times 60 and then 32 times 7, and then add the two results together.

First, 32 times 60. Well, 32 times 6 is 192, right? So, 32 times 60 would be 192 times 10, which is 1,920.

Next, 32 times 7. Let me calculate that. 30 times 7 is 210, and 2 times 7 is 14. So adding those together, 210 + 14 equals 224.

Now, I add the two results: 1,920 plus 224. Let me do that step by step. 1,920 plus 200 is 2,120. Then, adding the remaining 24 gives me 2,144. So, 32 times 67 should be 2,144.

Looking at the options, G is 2,144. So the answer should be G.

The product of 32 x 67 is calculated by breaking it into 32 x (60 + 7). 32 x 60 = 1,920 and 32 x 7 = 224. Adding these gives 2,144.

Answer: G
