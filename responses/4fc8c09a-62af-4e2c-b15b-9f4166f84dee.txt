Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about neural networks and activation functions, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down each statement and understanding what they mean.

The question has two statements:

1. RELUs are not monotonic, but sigmoids are monotonic.
2. Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.

The options are A to J, each evaluating the truth of these statements.

First, let's tackle Statement 1. I remember that activation functions can be monotonic, meaning they either always increase or always decrease as their input increases. RELU stands for Rectified Linear Unit. Its function is f(x) = max(0, x). So, for x greater than 0, it's linear with a slope of 1, and for x less than 0, it's flat at 0. Wait, is that monotonic? Well, a function is monotonic if it's entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. RELU increases when x is positive and is constant when x is negative. So from negative infinity to 0, it's flat, and then it increases. That means it's not strictly increasing everywhere, but it's non-decreasing overall. Hmm, but I think monotonic usually allows for flat regions. So is RELU monotonic? Or does it have a flat region that makes it non-monotonic?

Wait, no. Monotonic functions can have flat regions as long as they don't decrease. So a function that is non-decreasing is monotonic. So RELU is non-decreasing, hence monotonic. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people say RELU isn't monotonic, maybe because it's not strictly increasing. But I think in math terms, non-decreasing is considered monotonic. So Statement 1 says RELUs are not monotonic, which would be false. Because RELU is monotonic (non-decreasing). Sigmoids, on the other hand, are sigmoid functions, which are S-shaped and have a single peak. Their derivative is always positive, so they're strictly increasing. So sigmoids are monotonic. So Statement 1 is saying RELU isn't monotonic, which is false, and sigmoids are, which is true. So Statement 1 is actually false.

Wait, but wait a second. If RELU is non-decreasing, then it's monotonic, right? So the first part of Statement 1 is false because it claims RELUs are not monotonic. So Statement 1 as a whole is false.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.

I know that gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize loss functions. But whether it converges to the global optimum depends on several factors. In practice, neural networks are non-convex, so gradient descent can get stuck in local minima. However, recent research suggests that for certain network architectures and under certain conditions, gradient descent (especially with techniques like momentum or Adam) can find approximate minima, but it's not guaranteed to find the global optimum. Also, in deep learning, it's more about finding a good local minimum rather than the global optimum because the function is too complex.

Moreover, the statement says "with high probability." I think this refers to results in theoretical computer science where under certain assumptions (like the network being wide enough, or using specific initialization), gradient descent can converge to the global optimum with high probability. But in practice, this isn't always the case. So I'm a bit torn. If the question is considering theoretical scenarios, then maybe Statement 2 is true. But more commonly, in real-world applications, gradient descent doesn't always converge to the global optimum. So perhaps Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I've heard about convex optimization where gradient descent does converge to the global optimum. Neural networks, however, have non-convex loss landscapes, so gradient descent might not. So Statement 2 is making a general claim. Therefore, the statement is probably false because neural networks typically have complex loss functions where gradient descent doesn't guarantee convergence to the global optimum.

So, putting it together:

Statement 1: False (because RELU is monotonic)
Statement 2: False (because gradient descent doesn't always find global optimum)

So both statements are false, which would be option F: False, False.

Wait, but let me double-check Statement 1. Maybe I was wrong about RELU being monotonic. Let me think again. RELU's output increases with input beyond zero and is zero otherwise. So for any x1 < x2, if both are positive, f(x1) < f(x2). If x1 is negative and x2 is positive, f(x1) =0 and f(x2) =x2, which is positive. If both are negative, f(x1) = f(x2) if x1 < x2. Wait, no. If x1 is more negative than x2, then x1 < x2, but f(x1)=0, f(x2)=0. So for all x1 <x2, f(x1) <= f(x2). That's the definition of non-decreasing, hence monotonic. So Statement 1 is claiming RELUs are not monotonic, which is false. So Statement 1 is false.

So the two statements are both false, making the answer F.

The first statement is false because RELUs are monotonic (non-decreasing), while the second statement is also false because gradient descent does not guarantee convergence to the global optimum for neural networks.
