Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the beta of Stock A. Hmm, I remember beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. But wait, how exactly do I calculate it? I think it involves covariance and the market's variance or something like that. Let me try to recall the formula.

I think beta is equal to the covariance between the stock and the market divided by the variance of the market. Or wait, sometimes I've seen it as the covariance divided by the market's standard deviation squared. Oh right, because variance is the square of standard deviation. So the formula should be Beta = Covariance(A, Market) / (Variance of Market). But wait, sometimes variance is given as the square of the standard deviation. So if the market's standard deviation is 14%, then the variance would be (14)^2, which is 196.

Wait, the covariance given is 88. So plugging in the numbers: Beta = 88 / (14^2). Let me compute that. 14 squared is 196. So 88 divided by 196. Let me do that division. 88 ÷ 196. Hmm, let's see. 196 goes into 88 zero times. So 0. Let's add a decimal point and some zeros. 196 into 880. How many times does 196 go into 880? Let's see: 196*4 is 784, which is less than 880. 196*5 is 980, which is too much. So 4 times. 4*196 is 784. Subtract that from 880, I get 96. Bring down a zero: 960. How many times does 196 go into 960? Let's see: 196*4=784, 196*5=980. So 4 times again. 4*196=784. Subtract from 960: 176. Bring down a zero: 1760. 196*8 is 1568, 196*9=1764. So 8 times. 1568. Subtract from 1760: 192. Hmm, this is getting a bit tedious. So far, I have 0.448... and so on. Wait, maybe I can simplify this fraction. 88/196. Both numbers are divisible by 4? Let's check: 88 ÷4 =22, 196 ÷4=49. So 22/49. Hmm, 22 divided by 49. Let me compute that. 49 goes into 22 zero times. 49 into 220: 4 times (4*49=196). Subtract: 220-196=24. Bring down a zero: 240. 49 goes into 240 four times (4*49=196). Subtract: 44. Bring down a zero: 440. 49*8=392. Subtract: 48. So it's approximately 0.4489 or about 0.45. Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 0.45. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh wait! Another thought: sometimes beta is calculated as covariance divided by the market's variance, but wait, another way to write it is beta equals the correlation coefficient multiplied by (stock's standard deviation divided by market's standard deviation). So Beta = (Covariance(A, Market)) / (Variance of Market). Alternatively, since Variance of Market is (Market SD)^2, which is 14^2=196, so it's the same as before. So 88 /196 = 0.44897..., which rounds to approximately 0.45. So the correct answer should be J: 0.45. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 0.24, which is half of 0.48, but maybe I messed up the numbers. Did I calculate 88/196 correctly? Let me check again: 14% is the market's SD, so variance is (14)^2=196. Covariance is 88. 88 divided by 196 is indeed approximately 0.44897, which is roughly 0.45. So the answer should be J:0.45.

The beta of Stock A is calculated by dividing the covariance between Stock A and the market index (88) by the variance of the market index, which is the square of the market's standard deviation (14%). The variance is 14² = 196. Thus, Beta = 88 / 196 ≈ 0.45. 

Answer: J
