Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Paley's argument regarding the difference between a watch and nature. I remember Paley is an 18th-century philosopher who wrote about natural theology, specifically the watchmaker analogy. Let me think through this.

The question is asking about the key difference Paley points out between the contrivance of a watch and that of nature. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to recall what Paley's argument is about. He uses the watch as an example of something that is clearly designed because all its parts work together for a purpose. He then argues that since the watch has a designer, so must nature, which is more complex and intricate.

So Paley is contrasting a human-made object (the watch) with the natural world. The watch is something humans create, while nature is something we observe but didn't create. Therefore, the key difference would be that nature is not created by human hands, unlike the watch.

Looking at the options, option H is "not created by human hands." That seems to fit because the watch is made by humans, whereas nature is not. The other options don't quite capture the essence of Paley's point. For example, option A says dependent on human intervention, but that's more about how we interact with nature, not the origin of its design. Option F talks about being greater and grander, which is true, but it's not the main point Paley is making. He's focusing on the designer, not just the scale.

So I think H is the correct answer here.

The correct answer is H: not created by human hands.
