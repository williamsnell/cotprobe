Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. The question says, "Let n be the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. Find the sum of the digits of n." And then there are several options to choose from, labeled A to J.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to identify the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. Then, I'll multiply them together to get n. After that, I'll calculate the sum of the digits of this product, and then see which option it matches.

Alright, let's start by figuring out what the smallest 3-digit prime numbers are. The smallest 3-digit number is 100, but that's even, so it's not prime. The next one is 101. Wait, is 101 a prime? Yes, I remember 101 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Wait, but is there a smaller 3-digit prime? Let me think. 100 is not prime, 101 is the next. So, 101 is the smallest 3-digit prime. But wait, 100 is not prime, so 101 is the first. Now, the next one after that would be 103, right? Because 102 is even, 103 is prime. So, the two smallest 3-digit primes are 101 and 103.

Wait, let me double-check. After 101, the next prime is 103. Because 101, 103, 107, 109, etc., are primes. So yeah, 101 and 103 are the two smallest 3-digit primes.

Now, I need to find their product, n = 101 * 103. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 101 multiplied by 100 is 10,100, and then plus 101 more because 103 is 100 + 3. So, 10,100 + 303 = 10,403. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake there.

Wait, 101 * 103 is same as (100 + 1)(100 + 3) which expands to 100^2 + 100*3 + 1*100 + 1*3. That would be 10,000 + 300 + 100 + 3 = 10,000 + 400 + 3 = 10,403. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me confirm by another method. Maybe using standard multiplication. 101 times 103. So, 101 * 100 is 10,100, and 101 * 3 is 303. Adding them together gives 10,100 + 303 = 10,403. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, I need to find the sum of the digits of 10,403. Let's write it out: 1, 0, 4, 0, 3. So adding them together: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3. That's 1+0=1, 1+4=5, 5+0=5, 5+3=8. So the sum is 8.

Wait, but let me check again to be sure. The number is 10,403. The digits are 1, 0, 4, 0, 3. So adding them: 1 + 0 is 1, 1 +4 is 5, 5 + 0 is 5, 5 +3 is 8. Yep, that's 8.

Looking at the options, A is 8, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Are 101 and 103 really the two smallest 3-digit primes? Let me check the primes after 100. The first few 3-digit numbers are 100 (not prime), 101 (prime), 102 (even), 103 (prime). So yes, 101 and 103 are the two smallest 3-digit primes. So their product is indeed 10,403, whose digits sum to 8.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be option A: 8.

The two smallest 3-digit primes are 101 and 103. Their product is 10,403, and the sum of its digits is 8.

Answer: A
