Question:

A patient comes into the hospital after being bit by a dog who he stated was “acting crazy”. The wound is open and bleeding. Animal control captured the dog and said that it was foaming at the mouth and extremely aggressive. Suspecting a rabies infection, the patient is given a serum that contains rabies antibodies that were grown inside a horse. This is an example of what kind of immunity?

Options:

A: Passive
B: Acquired
C: Passive natural
D: Natural
E: Active artificial
F: Passive artificial
G: Active natural
H: Artificial
I: Innate
J: Active

Okay, so I've got this question about immunity types, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The scenario is a patient who was bitten by a dog that was acting crazy. The dog was foaming at the mouth and aggressive, so they suspect rabies. The patient gets a serum with rabies antibodies grown in a horse. The question is asking what kind of immunity this is.

Hmm, I remember that immunity can be categorized in different ways. Let's think about the types. First, there's active and passive immunity. Active is when the body produces its own antibodies, like when you get a vaccine. Passive is when you receive antibodies directly, like from another source.

Then there's natural versus artificial. Natural immunity comes from actually being infected, which can sometimes provide long-lasting protection. Artificial is when it's induced through medical means, like vaccines or antibody treatments.

So the patient received a serum with antibodies. That means they're getting pre-made antibodies, not their own body making them. So that's passive immunity. Now, passive immunity can be natural or artificial. Natural would be like getting antibodies from a mother through breast milk, which is natural. Artificial is when it's given by medical means, like this serum.

In this case, the serum contains antibodies from a horse. The patient isn't producing their own; they're getting them from another species. So it's artificial because it's a medical intervention, not a natural transfer.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between passive artificial and active artificial. Active is when you get a vaccine, which stimulates your immune system to make its own antibodies. Passive is when you get the antibodies directly. So this is definitely passive.

So putting it all together, the patient gets antibodies from a horse, which is an external source, so passive. Since it's given via medical means (serum), it's artificial. So the type is passive artificial immunity.

The patient received pre-made antibodies from a horse, which is an external source. This is passive immunity. Since the antibodies were administered through a medical intervention (serum), it is classified as artificial. Therefore, the correct answer is **Passive artificial**.
