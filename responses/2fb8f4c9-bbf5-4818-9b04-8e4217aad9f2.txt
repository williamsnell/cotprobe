Okay, so Tisha wrote a riddle, and I need to figure out what it is. Let's break down the clues step by step.

The riddle says: "I have 2 faces, no vertices, and I can roll." Hmm, let's think about each part.

First, two faces. Faces in geometry usually refer to flat surfaces. So, what shapes have exactly two faces? Well, a cylinder comes to mind because it has two circular faces (top and bottom) and a curved surface. But wait, does a cylinder have any vertices? No, vertices are corners where edges meet, and a cylinder doesn't have any edgesâ€”it's smooth. So that fits the second clue: no vertices.

Can it roll? Yes, a cylinder can roll because it's round. So that fits the third clue as well. Let me check the options to see if cylinder is an option. Looking at the choices, option I is cylinder. That seems to fit all the clues.

Wait, let me make sure there's no other shape that fits. A cone has a point, so it has one face (the base) and a curved surface, but it has a vertex at the tip. So that's not it because the riddle says no vertices. A sphere has no faces, vertices, or edges, but the riddle mentions two faces, so sphere isn't it either.

What about prisms? A hexagonal prism has two hexagonal faces and rectangular sides. That's more than two faces, so that's out. Similarly, a rectangular prism (like a box) has six faces, so no. A cube is a type of rectangular prism, so it also has six faces, so no. Pyramids have a base and triangular faces, so more than two faces and a vertex at the top. So that's not it.

A torus is like a donut shape; it's a bit tricky. It has one face, I think, but I'm not sure. Wait, a torus is a surface with one face, no edges, and no vertices. But the riddle says two faces, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the torus is considered to have two surfaces because it's like the inside and outside? But I'm not sure if that's standard. I think the more straightforward answer is the cylinder because it clearly has two flat faces and can roll.

So putting it all together: two faces, no vertices, can roll. Cylinder fits.

The answer is I: cylinder.

I: cylinder
