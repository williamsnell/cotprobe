Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Papadaki's views on sexual objectification in relationships. Let's break it down step by step.

The question states that Papadaki thinks that when both partners in a relationship mutually deny each other's humanity, what happens? The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should probably recall what sexual objectification means. From what I remember, sexual objectification occurs when a person is treated as an object for sexual use rather than as a person with dignity and humanity. So, if both partners are denying each other's humanity, that sounds like a situation where each is treating the other as less than human, which could relate to objectification.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Context is irrelevant. Hmm, I'm not sure. Sometimes context matters a lot, but maybe in this case, if both are denying each other's humanity, context might not matter because the behavior itself is clear.

B: Sexual objectification occurs. This seems plausible because if they're denying each other's humanity, they're likely objectifying each other.

C: Context determines it. So maybe even if they deny each other's humanity, whether it's objectification depends on the context. But I'm not sure if that's what Papadaki would say.

D: Only valid in non-mutual contexts. So if it's mutual, maybe it's not considered objectification? I'm not certain about this.

E: Only physical abuse qualifies. No, objectification isn't just physical abuse; it's about treating someone as an object, which can be verbal or psychological too.

F: Both incapable of objectifying. That doesn't make sense because if they're denying each other's humanity, they're likely objectifying each other.

G: No straightforward answer. Could be a possibility if it's a nuanced question, but I think the answer is more direct.

H: Doesn't occur. If they're denying each other's humanity, it seems like objectification would occur, so H might be incorrect.

I: Only the denier objectifies. Maybe, but the question says they mutually deny, so both are doing it, so I might not be the right choice.

J: Neither can objectify. Again, if they're denying each other's humanity, they probably are objectifying each other, so J seems wrong.

So narrowing it down, options B, C, and G are in the mix. The question says "mutually deny each other's humanity." If both are doing it, does that mean objectification occurs? I think so. So B could be correct.

Alternatively, C says context matters. Maybe even in mutual denial, context could determine objectification. But I'm not sure if Papadaki would say context is irrelevant or not.

Wait, maybe the key is mutual denial. If both are denying each other's humanity, then each is objectifying the other. So B seems right because it's a direct statement that objectification occurs.

Therefore, the answer is B.

The question revolves around Papadaki's perspective on sexual objectification when both partners in a relationship mutually deny each other's humanity. Sexual objectification involves treating a person as an object for sexual use rather than as a human being with dignity. 

Analyzing the options, if both partners are denying each other's humanity, it suggests a clear case of objectification. Context is less likely to be the determining factor here, as the mutual denial itself indicates objectification. Therefore, the most straightforward answer is that sexual objectification occurs.

Answer: B
