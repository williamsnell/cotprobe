Okay, so I've got this question about banking reserves, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it.

The question says a commercial bank has deposits of $400,000 and has made loans and investments totaling $315,000. It also mentions that deposits are the only source of reserves, and the required reserve ratio is 20%. The question is asking how much the bank's excess reserves are.

Hmm, I remember that reserves are the funds a bank keeps on hand to meet obligations, and excess reserves are what's left after fulfilling the required reserves. So first, I need to calculate the required reserves based on the deposits.

The required reserve ratio is 20%, which as a decimal is 0.20. So I multiply the total deposits by this ratio. Let's do that: 400,000 * 0.20. That should give the required reserves.

400,000 * 0.20 equals $80,000. So the bank is required to hold $80,000 in reserves.

Now, the bank's total reserves would be the sum of required reserves and excess reserves. But wait, the bank's loans and investments are $315,000. I think the formula is: Total Reserves = Required Reserves + Excess Reserves. Also, the bank's total assets are the deposits plus the reserves, but wait, no, the bank's assets are the loans and investments plus the reserves, right?

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The bank's deposits are $400,000. They've used $315,000 for loans and investments. So the remaining money is their reserves. Because when a bank makes a loan, it's essentially taking money from deposits and keeping some as reserves.

So total reserves would be deposits minus loans and investments. That would be 400,000 - 315,000 = $85,000. So the total reserves are $85,000.

But wait, the required reserves are $80,000. So the excess reserves would be total reserves minus required reserves. So 85,000 - 80,000 = $5,000. That would be the excess reserves.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The formula for excess reserves is total reserves minus required reserves. So yes, if total reserves are $85,000 and required is $80,000, excess is $5,000.

Looking at the options, option C is $5,000. So I think the answer is C.

The bank's deposits are $400,000, and the required reserve ratio is 20%, so the required reserves are $80,000. The bank has made loans and investments totaling $315,000, so its total reserves are $85,000 ($400,000 - $315,000). Excess reserves are calculated as total reserves minus required reserves, which is $5,000 ($85,000 - $80,000).

Answer: C
