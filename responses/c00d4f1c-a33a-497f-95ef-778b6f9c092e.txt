Question:

One aspect of Marxian economics is that some of the pre-dictions of Marx were proven wrong. As a result of this, some radical economists have only adopted the tools of Marxian analysis, without necessarily accepting Marx's con-clusions . In the nineteenth century, other Marxists became 'revisionists'. Explain briefly what distinguishes a re-visionist from a Marxist.

Options:

A: Revisionists maintain that capitalism will naturally evolve into socialism without any intervention
B: Revisionists support the idea of a permanent dictatorship of the proletariat as the path to socialism
C: Revisionists focus on individual enlightenment and moral reform as the means to achieve socialism
D: Revisionists argue for immediate abolition of the state to achieve socialism
E: Revisionists believe in gradual evolution towards socialism through political action and trade unionism, rejecting violent class struggle.
F: Revisionists emphasize the importance of international trade as a primary tool for achieving socialism
G: Revisionists adhere strictly to Marx's labor theory of value
H: Revisionists reject the concept of class struggle entirely and believe in maintaining the status quo
I: Revisionists fully accept Marx's theories and predictions
J: Revisionists believe in achieving socialism through violent revolution

Okay, so I need to figure out what distinguishes a revisionist from a Marxist based on the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about Marxian economics and the term "revisionist." 

Marx's theory predicts that capitalism will lead to its own demise as the working class becomes increasingly exploited, leading to a revolution where the means of production are seized, resulting in socialism and eventually communism. However, some of these predictions didn't hold up, so revisionists emerged. Revisionists are Marxists who have modified some of Marx's original ideas to fit new circumstances.

Looking at the options:

A: Revisionists maintain that capitalism will naturally evolve into socialism without any intervention. Hmm, I think this might be close. Marx thought it would take a violent revolution, but maybe revisionists think it can happen more smoothly.

B: Support a permanent dictatorship of the proletariat. That sounds more like Lenin's view, not sure if it's revisionist.

C: Focus on individual enlightenment. That doesn't sound right; Marx was more about class struggle, so this seems off.

D: Immediate abolition of the state. Again, sounds more like anarchist ideas or extreme Marxism, not sure about revisionists.

E: Gradual evolution through political action and unions, rejecting violent class struggle. This seems plausible. Revisionists might support working within the system using unions and political means rather than waiting for revolution.

F: International trade as primary tool. Not sure how this ties in; doesn't directly relate to the key points of revisionism.

G: Strictly adhere to labor theory of value. No, revisionists modify some theories, so they likely don't stick strictly to all of Marx's points.

H: Reject class struggle. That's not right; revisionists still believe in class struggle but perhaps approach it differently.

I: Fully accept Marx's theories. No, revisionists are about revising, so they don't fully accept all of his conclusions.

J: Achieve socialism through violent revolution. That's the opposite of revisionists, who might reject this in favor of other methods.

So, putting it together, revisionists probably believe in a different approach than the traditional Marxist view of revolution. They might support gradual change through political means and unions, as in option E. That makes sense because they're revising Marx's ideas to fit new realities, which might involve working within existing structures rather than waiting for a violent overthrow.

The distinction lies in their approach to achieving socialism. Revisionists, unlike traditional Marxists, advocate for a gradual evolution through political action and trade unionism, rejecting the violent class struggle predicted by Marx. 

Answer: E
