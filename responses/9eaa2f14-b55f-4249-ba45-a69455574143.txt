Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a big fish swallowing a small fish. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about what changes after the big fish eats the small one.

Alright, so the big fish is moving and then it swallows the small fish, which is at rest. I remember from my physics classes that when two objects interact like this, especially in terms of collisions or swallowing, momentum is involved. Momentum is mass times velocity, right? So before the big fish eats the small one, the big fish has some momentum because it's moving. The small fish is at rest, so its momentum is zero.

After the big fish swallows the small one, the total mass of the system (big fish + small fish) increases. But wait, does the velocity change? Since momentum is conserved in the absence of external forces, the total momentum after swallowing should equal the total momentum before. So before, the momentum is just the big fish's momentum. After, the combined mass (let's say M) times the new velocity (v') should equal the initial momentum, which was m*v, where m is the big fish's mass before and v is its initial velocity.

So M*v' = m*v. Therefore, v' = (m*v) / (M). Since M is bigger than m (because M = m + mass of small fish), the new velocity v' must be less than v. So the speed of the big fish decreases after swallowing. But wait, the question is about the change in what. The options are about what changes: direction, momentum, size, speed, weight, energy, etc.

Wait, but the question says "the fattened big fish has a change in..." So we're focusing on the big fish's properties. The big fish's mass increases because it swallowed the small fish. But mass is part of momentum. So the big fish's momentum would change because its mass has increased. Before, momentum was m*v, after it's (m + m_small)*v_new. But since v_new is lower, the total momentum might stay the same if the system is isolated, but the big fish's momentum as a part of the system would change because its mass increased but velocity decreased. I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, since the big fish is part of a closed system (assuming no external forces), the total momentum of the system (big + small) remains the same. So the big fish's momentum would change because its mass increases, but its velocity adjusts to keep the total momentum the same. So the big fish's momentum changes because its mass is now larger, even though its velocity is lower. So the momentum of the big fish does change.

Looking at the options, option B is momentum. Also, size would change because the big fish got bigger, so option C is size. But the question is about what changes in the big fish right after lunch. So both size and momentum would change. Wait, but wait, the options don't have both size and momentum as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options: A: direction, B: momentum, C: size, D: speed, E: Both weight and size, F: Both (probably both what?), G: Both direction and energy, H: weight, I: Energy, J: Neither.

Wait, the options are a bit ambiguous. Let me read them again.

Option E: Both weight and size. So weight would increase because the mass increases. Size would also increase because it swallowed the small fish. So E says both weight and size change. But the question is about the big fish's change. So the big fish's weight (which is mass times gravity) increases because it has more mass. Its size, like its volume or length, also increases. So E would be correct if both happen.

But wait, the options are about the big fish's change. So after swallowing, the big fish's mass increases, so its weight (if on Earth, weight is mass*gravity) increases. Its size increases because it's bigger. So E says both weight and size change. So that's possible. But wait, the question is phrased as "the fattened big fish has a change in..." So the big fish's properties change.

But I'm not sure if the problem is considering the big fish alone. Alternatively, in the context of physics, when a fish swallows another, the system's momentum is conserved, but the big fish's speed might decrease because it has more mass. So its velocity changes, meaning its speed changes. So D: speed would change. Also, the big fish's mass increases, so its momentum (mass*velocity) would change because the mass goes up, but velocity goes down. Wait, but the total momentum of the system remains the same, but the big fish's individual momentum would change because its mass is now bigger, but its velocity is lower. So the big fish's momentum changes because m increases, but v decreases. Let me think about that.

Let me say initial momentum is p_initial = m*v. After swallowing, the mass is m + m_small, and velocity is v'. So p_final = (m + m_small)*v'. Since momentum is conserved, p_initial = p_final. So v' = (m*v) / (m + m_small). So the big fish's velocity decreases. Therefore, its speed decreases. So D: speed changes. But also, its mass increases, so its momentum would be (m + m_small)*v', which is equal to m*v, so the big fish's momentum remains the same? Wait, that can't be right. Because if m increases and v decreases, but the product remains the same. So the big fish's momentum doesn't change? Wait, no, because initially, the big fish's momentum was m*v. After, it's (m + m_small)*v', which equals m*v. So the big fish's momentum remains the same. But wait, the small fish was at rest, so its initial momentum was zero. After, the combined momentum is (m + m_small)*v', which equals m*v. So the big fish's momentum as a part of the system hasn't changed, but the big fish's own momentum has changed because it's now a larger mass with a lower velocity, but the product is the same. Wait, no, because the big fish's momentum is (m + m_small)*v', which is m*v, same as before. So the big fish's momentum doesn't change. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, no, because before, the big fish's momentum was m*v. After, it's (m + m_small)*v', which equals m*v. So the big fish's momentum as a single entity hasn't changed. Because the total system's momentum is conserved, so the big fish's part is the same. So the big fish's momentum doesn't change. So option B, momentum, would not change. Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.

Alternatively, maybe the big fish's momentum does change because it's now a bigger mass moving at a different speed. Wait, but according to the calculation, (m + m_small)*v' = m*v, so the big fish's momentum is the same as before. So the big fish's momentum doesn't change. So option B is incorrect.

Then, what about speed? The big fish's speed decreases. So D: speed changes.

But the question is, what changes in the big fish after swallowing. So speed changes, mass increases (so weight increases, size increases). So the big fish's speed, size, and weight all change. But looking at the options, E is both weight and size. So E would be correct if both of those change. D is speed, which also changes. But the options don't have an option that combines all three.

Wait, the options are:

A: direction

B: momentum

C: size

D: speed

E: Both weight and size

F: Both (but both what? Probably refers to two options, but the options aren't clear. Maybe F is both speed and size, but not sure.)

G: Both direction and energy

H: weight

I: Energy

J: Neither

Wait, the options are a bit unclear. Let me read the options again as given:

Options:

A: direction

B: momentum

C: size

D: speed

E: Both weight and size

F: Both

G: Both direction and energy

H: weight

I: Energy

J: Neither

Hmm, perhaps option F is "Both B and C" or something, but the way it's written, F is "Both", which might be both B and C. Alternatively, maybe the options are lettered with F being both speed and size, but not sure. But in the original question, the options are labeled from A to J, each with a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: Both weight and size. Because the big fish's mass increases, so weight increases, and size increases because it swallowed the small fish. So both happen. So E would be correct.

But earlier, I thought speed changes, so D would be correct. So now I'm confused. Let me think again.

The big fish's mass increases, so its weight (assuming it's on Earth) increases because weight is mass times g. So weight changes. Its size also increases because it's bigger. So E: Both weight and size.

But what about momentum? The big fish's momentum before was m*v. After, it's (m + m_small)*v'. Since (m + m_small)*v' = m*v, the big fish's momentum remains the same. So the big fish's momentum doesn't change. So B is incorrect.

So the big fish's weight and size both change. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but what about speed? The big fish's speed decreases. So D: speed changes. But E is about weight and size, not speed.

So the question is, what change occurs in the big fish. So the big fish's speed decreases, mass increases (so size and weight increase). So the changes are speed, size, and weight.

But the options don't have an option that includes all three. So the options are:

A: direction – no, direction doesn't change.

B: momentum – no, it remains the same.

C: size – yes, it increases.

D: speed – yes, it decreases.

E: Both weight and size – yes, both increase.

So E is correct because both weight and size change. But D is also correct because speed changes. But the options don't have an option that includes both D and E.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the big fish's change in momentum. Earlier, I thought that the big fish's momentum remains the same because the total system's momentum is conserved. So the big fish's momentum is the same before and after. So B is incorrect.

So the big fish's speed changes (D), size changes (C), and weight changes (H). So which option includes these?

But looking at the options, E is both weight and size. So E includes two changes. But the big fish's speed also changes. So the correct answer would include all three, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the best option is E, as it includes two of the changes, but the question might be focusing on the big fish's properties, not the system's.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. When the big fish swallows the small one, the big fish's mass increases, so its momentum (if moving) would change because momentum is mass times velocity. But wait, in the system, momentum is conserved, so the big fish's velocity decreases to keep the total momentum the same. So the big fish's momentum (m*v) before is equal to (m + Δm)*v' after. So the big fish's momentum changes because m increases, but v decreases. So the product could stay the same, but the individual factors change. So the big fish's momentum as a single entity doesn't change because it's part of the system. Wait, but the big fish's own momentum does change because it's now a bigger mass moving slower. So the product m*v for the big fish alone changes because m increases and v decreases, but the total system's momentum remains the same.

Wait, no. The total system's momentum is the sum of the big fish and small fish's momenta. Initially, the small fish is at rest, so system's momentum is m*v. After, the big fish's momentum is (m + m_small)*v', and the small fish is inside, so it's moving at v'. So the total momentum is (m + m_small)*v', which equals m*v. So the big fish's momentum is now (m + m_small)*v', which is equal to m*v. So the big fish's momentum has changed because it's now (m + m_small)*v', which is different from m*v. So the big fish's momentum changes. So option B is correct.

But wait, that's conflicting. Because the big fish's momentum as part of the system remains the same as before. Because before, the system's momentum was m*v. After, it's (m + m_small)*v' = m*v. So the big fish's momentum is now (m + m_small)*v' = m*v, same as before. So the big fish's momentum hasn't changed. So option B is incorrect.

This is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify.

Before swallowing:

- Big fish momentum: m*v
- Small fish momentum: 0
- Total system momentum: m*v

After swallowing:

- Big fish (now with mass m + m_small) moves at v'
- Small fish is inside, so it's moving at v'
- Total system momentum: (m + m_small)*v'

Since momentum is conserved, (m + m_small)*v' = m*v → v' = (m*v)/(m + m_small)

So the big fish's momentum after is (m + m_small)*v' = m*v, same as before. So the big fish's momentum hasn't changed. So option B is incorrect.

So the big fish's momentum remains the same. So B is incorrect.

So what changes? The big fish's mass increases, so its weight increases (assuming gravity is constant). Its size increases because it's bigger. Its speed decreases because v' < v. So the big fish's speed, size, and weight all change.

Looking back at the options, which ones are correct?

Option D: speed changes → yes.

Option C: size changes → yes.

Option H: weight changes → yes.

Option E: Both weight and size → yes.

So the options E and D are both correct, but the question is about what the big fish experiences. So the big fish's speed decreases, size increases, and weight increases. But the options don't have an option that combines all three. So the best options are E (weight and size) and D (speed). But the options don't have an option that includes all three.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the fattened big fish has a change in..." So the big fish's properties. So the big fish's mass increases, so weight increases. Its size increases. Its speed decreases. So all three changes occur. But the options don't have an option that includes all three. So perhaps the intended answer is E, as it's about the big fish's weight and size, which are both correct. Alternatively, the question might be focusing on the fact that the big fish's momentum doesn't change, so the answer is J: Neither. But that can't be right because the big fish's speed and size do change.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the big fish's momentum changes. Since the big fish's momentum remains the same, then the change is zero. But that's not one of the options. The options don't have "Neither" as the correct answer because the big fish's speed and size do change.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the big fish alone, not the system. So the big fish's momentum changes because it's now moving at a different speed with more mass. But earlier calculation shows that the big fish's momentum as part of the system remains the same, but the big fish's own momentum (as a single entity) changes because it's moving slower with more mass. Wait, but in reality, the big fish's momentum as a single entity would change because it's moving at a different velocity, even though the product (m*v) is the same as before. So the big fish's momentum changes direction? No, direction doesn't change. Speed changes, so momentum's magnitude changes, but direction remains same.

Wait, no. Momentum is a vector. If the big fish continues in the same direction, then the direction doesn't change. So only the magnitude of momentum changes. But earlier, the big fish's momentum as part of the system remains the same. Wait, no, because the big fish's momentum is now (m + m_small)*v', which equals m*v. So the big fish's momentum hasn't changed. So the big fish's momentum remains the same. So option B is incorrect.

So the big fish's momentum doesn't change, but its speed does. So the answer would be D: speed.

But earlier, I thought the big fish's mass increases, so size and weight change. So E is also correct.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is about what changes in the big fish after swallowing the small one. The big fish's mass increases, so its weight increases. Its size increases. Its speed decreases. So all three: size, weight, speed change.

But the options don't have an option that includes all three. The options are:

A: direction – no.

B: momentum – no, because it remains same.

C: size – yes.

D: speed – yes.

E: Both weight and size – yes.

F: Both – unclear, but perhaps refers to speed and size.

G: Both direction and energy – no.

H: weight – yes.

I: Energy – no, because energy is conserved but the big fish's kinetic energy changes because KE = ½mv². Before, KE was ½mv². After, KE is ½(m + m_small)(v')². Since v' = (m/(m + m_small))v, v'² = m²v²/(m + m_small)². So KE after is ½(m + m_small)(m²v²)/(m + m_small)²) = ½m²v²/(m + m_small). Which is less than the initial KE of ½mv². So KE decreases. So the big fish's energy changes, but the total system's energy is conserved (assuming no energy loss). So the big fish's energy changes, but the question is about the big fish's change. So I: Energy would be incorrect because the big fish's KE decreases. But the question is about what changes, so if the big fish's KE changes, then I might be correct. But the options don't have energy as an option with others.

Wait, the options are:

I: Energy

So if the big fish's energy changes, then I is correct. But earlier, I thought the big fish's momentum doesn't change, so B is incorrect.

But the question is about what changes in the big fish. So the big fish's speed, size, and weight all change. So the correct answer would include these. But the options don't have such a choice. The closest is E: Both weight and size, and D: speed.

But the options don't have an option that combines all three. So perhaps the intended answer is E: Both weight and size. Because when the big fish swallows the small one, its mass increases, so weight and size increase.

Alternatively, the question might be testing the concept of conservation of momentum. The big fish's momentum doesn't change because the system's momentum is conserved. But the big fish's speed does change. So the correct answer would be D: speed.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the big fish's speed changes, but its momentum remains the same. So the big fish's speed changes, but its momentum doesn't. So the big fish's speed changes, but momentum doesn't. So the answer would be D: speed.

But the big fish's size and weight also change. So the answer would include D, C, and H. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is E: Both weight and size.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Since the big fish's momentum doesn't change, the answer is J: Neither. But that can't be right because the big fish's speed and size do change.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it another way. The question is about what changes in the big fish. The big fish's mass increases, so its weight increases. Its size increases. Its speed decreases. So all three. But the options don't have an option that includes all three.

Looking back, the options are:

A: direction → no.

B: momentum → no, remains same.

C: size → yes.

D: speed → yes.

E: Both weight and size → yes.

So E is correct because both weight and size change. D is also correct because speed changes. But the options don't have an option that combines D and E.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: Both, but it's unclear what 'both' refers to. Maybe F refers to both speed and size, or both weight and size. But without clarity, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the big fish's momentum. Since the big fish's momentum doesn't change, the answer is J: Neither. But that's incorrect because the big fish's speed and size do change.

I think the intended answer is E: Both weight and size. Because when the big fish swallows the small one, its mass increases, so weight and size increase. The speed change is a separate factor, but perhaps the question is focusing on the big fish's properties, not its motion.

So, the answer is E: Both weight and size.
</think>

The problem involves a big fish swallowing a small fish at rest, and the question asks what changes in the big fish immediately after. To analyze this, we consider the principles of momentum conservation and the properties of the big fish.

1. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Before swallowing, the big fish has momentum \( p_{\text{initial}} = m \cdot v \), where \( m \) is its mass and \( v \) is its velocity. The small fish is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After swallowing, the combined system (big fish + small fish) has a total mass of \( m + m_{\text{small}} \) and moves at a new velocity \( v' \). By conservation of momentum:  
   \[
   (m + m_{\text{small}}) \cdot v' = m \cdot v
   \]  
   Solving for \( v' \):  
   \[
   v' = \frac{m \cdot v}{m + m_{\text{small}}}
   \]  
   Since \( m + m_{\text{small}} > m \), \( v' < v \). Thus, the big fish's speed decreases.

2. **Properties of the Big Fish**:  
   - **Mass and Weight**: The big fish's mass increases due to swallowing the small fish. Assuming constant gravitational acceleration, its weight (mass \( \times g \)) also increases.  
   - **Size**: The big fish's size increases as it incorporates the small fish.  
   - **Momentum**: While the total momentum of the system remains conserved, the big fish's momentum as a single entity changes because its mass increases and its velocity decreases. However, the product \( (m + m_{\text{small}}) \cdot v' \) equals the initial momentum \( m \cdot v \), so the big fish's momentum remains the same.  

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A: Direction** – The big fish's direction does not change.  
   - **B: Momentum** – The big fish's momentum remains the same.  
   - **C: Size** – The big fish's size increases.  
   - **D: Speed** – The big fish's speed decreases.  
   - **E: Both weight and size** – The big fish's weight and size both increase.  
   - **F: Both** – Unclear, but likely incorrect without specifying what "both" refers to.  
   - **G: Both direction and energy** – Direction does not change, and energy is conserved in the system but not explicitly addressed for the big fish alone.  
   - **H: Weight** – The big fish's weight increases.  
   - **I: Energy** – The big fish's kinetic energy decreases, but this is not directly asked.  
   - **J: Neither** – Incorrect, as the big fish's size and weight do change.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The big fish's size and weight both increase after swallowing the small fish. While its speed also decreases, the options do not include an answer that combines all three changes. The most accurate choice based on the given options is **E: Both weight and size**.

**Answer: E**
