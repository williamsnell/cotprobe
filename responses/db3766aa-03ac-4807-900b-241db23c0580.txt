Okay, so I have this problem about diffraction gratings, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is a diffraction grating placed on a spectrometer. Sodium light is used, which has a wavelength of 5.89 × 10^-5 cm. They observed a large number of diffraction orders, and specifically, the angular separation between the central (which I think is the 0th order) and the 20th order is 15 degrees and 10 minutes. I need to find the number of grating elements per centimeter.

Hmm, I remember that the diffraction grating equation is d sinθ = mλ, where d is the distance between the grating elements, θ is the angle, m is the order, and λ is the wavelength. Since the grating is fairly coarse, I guess that means d is larger than usual, which might result in more orders being visible because higher m can fit within the angle range.

Wait, the question mentions angular separation between the central (0th) and 20th order. So θ here would be the angle for the 20th order. The central maximum is at θ=0, so the angle given is 15°10', which is the angle for m=20.

First, I need to convert that angular measure into decimal degrees. 10 minutes is 10/60 degrees, which is about 0.1667 degrees. So the total angle θ is 15 + 0.1667 = 15.1667 degrees.

Now, using the diffraction grating formula:

d sinθ = mλ

We can rearrange this to solve for d: d = mλ / sinθ

We need to find d, then find how many grating elements are in 1 cm. So the number of lines per cm would be 1/(d) cm^-1.

Let me plug in the numbers. m is 20, λ is 5.89 × 10^-5 cm. θ is 15.1667 degrees.

First, calculate sinθ. Let me get my calculator. sin(15.1667°) ≈ sin(15.1667) ≈ 0.2605 (I can double-check that, but let's go with that for now).

So d = (20 * 5.89e-5 cm) / 0.2605

Calculating numerator: 20 * 5.89e-5 = 0.001178 cm.

Then divide by 0.2605: 0.001178 / 0.2605 ≈ 0.00452 cm. Wait, that's d, the distance between elements.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Because 0.001178 divided by 0.2605: Let me compute that again. 0.001178 / 0.2605. Let me do this more accurately.

0.2605 is approximately 0.2605. So 0.001178 / 0.2605 ≈ 0.00452 cm.

So d ≈ 0.00452 cm. Which is 4.52e-3 cm. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.00452 cm is 4.52e-3 cm. But that's per grating element, so the number of elements per cm would be 1/d.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute: d is the spacing between adjacent slits. So the number of slits per cm is 1/d cm^-1. Because if d is in cm, then 1/d is the number per cm.

So 1/d = 1 / 0.00452 cm ≈ 221.24 per cm.

Looking at the options, F is 222, which is very close. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me go through the steps again.

λ = 5.89 × 10^-5 cm = 5.89e-5 cm.

θ = 15°10' = 15 + 10/60 = 15.1667 degrees.

sinθ = sin(15.1667°). Let me confirm this value. Using a calculator, sin(15.1667) ≈ 0.2605. Correct.

So d = (mλ) / sinθ = (20 * 5.89e-5 cm) / 0.2605.

20 *5.89e-5 = 0.001178 cm.

Divide by 0.2605: 0.001178 / 0.2605 = ?

Let me compute 0.001178 ÷ 0.2605.

Well, 0.001178 ÷ 0.2605 = (1.178e-3) ÷ (2.605e-1) )= (1.178 / 2.605) ) × 1e-2 ≈ 0.452 × 1e-2 = 0.00452 cm.

So d ≈ 0.00452 cm.

Number of elements per cm is 1/d = 1/0.00452 ≈ 221.24. So approximately 221 per cm.

Looking at the options, F is 222, which matches closely. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 0.001178 divided by 0.2605 again.

0.001178 ÷ 0.2605.

Let me compute this as 1.178e-3 / 2.605e-1 = (1.178 / 2.605) * 1e-2.

Compute 1.178 / 2.605: Let's see, 2.605 × 0.45 = 1.17225. That's close to 1.178. So 0.45 * 2.605 = 1.17225, which is a little less than 1.178. The difference is 1.178 - 1.17225 = 0.00575. So 0.00575 ÷ 2.605 ≈ 0.0022 (since 2.605 * 0.002 = 0.00521, which is close to 0.00575). So total is approximately 0.45 + 0.0022 = 0.4522.

Multiply by 1e-2: 0.4522e-2 = 0.004522 cm.

So d ≈ 0.004522 cm, so 1/d ≈ 221.15 per cm. Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 221, but the options have F as 222. Hmm. Maybe I made a slight approximation in the sine value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sin(15.1667) more accurately. Let me check that.

Using a calculator: 15.1667 degrees.

sin(15) = 0.2588, sin(15.1667) would be slightly higher. Let me compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps when I did the calculation, the sine was a bit off. Let me use a calculator for sin(15°10').

15 degrees is 15.0000, 10 minutes is 10/60 = 0.1667 degrees. So 15.1667 degrees.

Using a calculator, sin(15.1667) ≈ let me calculate it:

In radians, 15.1667 degrees is 15.1667 * π/180 ≈ 0.2647 radians.

sin(0.2647) ≈ 0.2605 (as before), so that's correct.

But perhaps I should use a more precise value. Maybe 0.2605 is exact enough for this purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculation of 1.178 / 2.605.

Wait, 1.178 ÷ 2.605.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

2.605 × 0.45 = 1.17225.

But 1.178 is 0.00575 more than 1.17225.

So 0.00575 / 2.605 = approx 0.002208.

So 0.45 + 0.002208 = 0.452208.

So 1.178 / 2.605 ≈ 0.452208.

So 0.452208 × 1e-2 = 0.00452208 cm.

So 1/d = 1 / 0.00452208 ≈ 221.15 per cm.

Hmm, that's approximately 221.15, which is close to 221.15, but the options don't have that. The closest is F: 222, which is likely the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of lines is 222, so the answer is F.

Wait, but perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the formula. The formula is d sinθ = m λ.

Wait, another thing: sometimes, the central maximum is considered as m=0, so the angle for m=20 is the angle given. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: Did the problem specify the order? It says the 20th order, which is m=20, yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the small-angle approximation, but 15 degrees is not that small, so the approximation might not hold. But since we have a precise value, that's handled.

Wait, another possible mistake: Did I convert the wavelength correctly? The question says λ is 5.89 × 10^-5 cm. Oh wait, that's 5.89e-5 cm, which is 589 nm. Because 1 cm is 1e7 nm, so 5.89e-5 cm is 589 nm. Sodium light is indeed around 589 nm, so that's correct.

So, I think my calculations are correct, and the closest option is F:222.

The problem involves determining the number of grating elements per centimeter (N) using the diffraction grating equation:

\[
d \sin\theta = m\lambda
\]

Where:
- \( d \) is the distance between adjacent grating elements,
- \( \theta \) is the angle of the 20th order,
- \( m = 20 \) is the diffraction order,
- \( \lambda = 5.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \) is the wavelength of sodium light.

The angular separation given is \( 15^\circ 10' \), which converts to \( \theta = 15.1667^\circ \). Calculating \( \sin\theta \) gives approximately \( \sin(15.1667^\circ) \approx 0.2605 \).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
d = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin\theta} = \frac{20 \times 5.89 \times 10^{-5}}{0.2605} \approx 0.00452 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The number of grating elements per centimeter is:

\[
N = \frac{1}{d} = \frac{1}{0.00452} \approx 221.15.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives \( N \approx 221 \), which aligns closely with option F (222). Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{F}
\]

**Answer:** F
