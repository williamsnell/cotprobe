Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about a company exchanging land for machinery. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step. Let's see... The question is about finding the gain on the exchange.

Alright, the company exchanged land with an appraised value of $50,000 and an original cost of $20,000 for machinery worth $55,000. The transaction has commercial substance, which I think means that it's not just a way to shift assets between entities without any real business purpose. So, I should account for this exchange at fair values, right?

Wait, but let me make sure. When a company exchanges assets and the transaction has commercial substance, they should recognize gains or losses based on the fair values of the assets involved. So, the land is appraised at $50k, but the original cost was $20k. The machinery's fair value is $55k.

Hmm, so the company is giving up land worth $50k (fair value) and receiving machinery worth $55k. So, in terms of value, they're getting more for their land. The difference between what they received and what they gave up would be the gain.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. The land's fair value is $50k, and the machinery is $55k. So the company is exchanging $50k land for $55k machinery. That means they're effectively getting $5k more in machinery than the land is worth. So that's a gain, right?

Wait, but the original cost of the land was $20k. Does that affect the gain? I think in a commercial substance transaction, we use fair values, not the book values. So, the gain is based on the difference between the fair value of what they received and the fair value of what they gave up.

So the gain would be $55k (machinery) minus $50k (land) equals $5k. So the gain is $5k. Let me check the options. Option B is $5k. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when exchanging assets, the gain is calculated based on the book value of the asset given up. So the land's book value is $20k. If they exchange it for machinery worth $55k, the gain would be $55k - $20k = $35k. But wait, that's if the transaction didn't have commercial substance. Because when there's commercial substance, you use fair values, not book values. So in this case, since it's commercial substance, the gain should be based on fair values, which is $5k.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When there's commercial substance, both the asset received and the asset given up are recorded at their fair values. The gain or loss is the difference between the fair value of what you received and the fair value of what you gave up. So, the gain is $55k - $50k = $5k. So the company made a $5k gain. That makes sense because they're getting more for their land than its fair value. Alternatively, it could be seen as selling land at a higher value than its fair value, but wait, no, the land's fair value is $50k, and they're getting machinery for it worth $55k, which is a higher value, so they're effectively making a profit of $5k.

Alternatively, sometimes the gain is based on the book value. For example, if the land's book value is $20k and it's sold for $55k in machinery, the gain would be $55k - $20k = $35k. But I think that's only when the transaction doesn't have commercial substance. Because when it does, we use fair value for both sides.

Wait, so in this case, since the transaction has commercial substance, the correct approach is to use fair values. So gain is $5k. Therefore, the answer should be B: $5,000.

The company exchanged land with a fair value of $50,000 for machinery with a fair value of $55,000. Since the transaction has commercial substance, gains are calculated based on fair values. The gain is the difference between the fair value of the machinery received ($55,000) and the fair value of the land given up ($50,000), resulting in a gain of $5,000.

Answer: B
