Okay, so I've got this question about uranium-238 decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Part (a) is about finding the number of uranium nuclei remaining after a certain time, and part (b) is about finding the half-life. The given data is that the initial number of nuclei N0 is 10^25, the time elapsed is 10^8 years, and the decay rate per nucleus λ is 5 × 10^-18 s^-1. 

Alright, for radioactive decay, the formula I remember is N = N0 * e^(-λt). But wait, the units here are different. λ is in seconds, and the time given is in years. So I need to convert the time t into seconds to match the units for λ.

First, let me convert 10^8 years into seconds. I know that 1 year is approximately 3.154 × 10^7 seconds (since 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 365 days in a year: 60*60*24*365 = 31,536,000 ≈ 3.154e7). So multiplying that by 1e8 years:

t = 1e8 years * 3.154e7 s/year = 3.154e15 seconds. 

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 1e8 * 3.154e7 equals (1e8)*(3.154e7) = 3.154e15 seconds. Yep, that's correct.

Now, plug the numbers into the decay formula. λ is 5e-18 s^-1, and t is 3.154e15 s.

So λt = (5e-18) * (3.154e15) = 5 * 3.154 * 1e(-18+15) = 15.77 * 1e-3 = 0.01577.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 5e-18 multiplied by 3.154e15 is:

5 * 3.154 = 15.77, and the exponents are 1e(-18 +15)=1e-3, so 15.77e-3 is 0.01577. So λt is approximately 0.01577.

Now, e^(-λt) is e^(-0.01577). I can approximate this. Since for small x, e^-x ≈ 1 - x, but 0.01577 is about 1.577% which might not be super small, but maybe the approximation is okay. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately.

But wait, let me compute it properly. Using a calculator or e^x function. Alternatively, I remember that e^-0.01577 is roughly 0.9843. Let me check that:

Wait, ln(0.9843) ≈ -0.0158, so yes, e^-0.01577 is approximately 0.9843.

So N = N0 * 0.9843 = 1e25 * 0.9843 ≈ 9.843e24. Hmm, so that's about 9.84e24 nuclei remaining.

Let me check the options for part (a). Looking at the options, option D has 9.84e24, and option I also has 9.84e24. So I'll need to check the half-life part to see which one is correct.

Now, part (b) is about the half-life. The formula for half-life T1/2 is ln(2)/λ. But wait, λ is in seconds^-1, so T1/2 will be in seconds. Then we need to convert it into years.

So let's compute T1/2 = ln(2) / λ.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. λ is 5e-18 s^-1.

So T1/2 = 0.6931 / (5e-18) = 0.6931 /5 * 1e18 = 0.13862 * 1e18 = 1.3862e17 seconds.

Now, converting seconds into years. As before, 1 year is 3.154e7 seconds.

T1/2 in years = 1.3862e17 s / 3.154e7 s/year ≈ (1.3862 / 3.154) * 1e10 years.

Calculating 1.3862 / 3.154: approximately 0.439.

So T1/2 ≈ 0.439e10 years = 4.39e9 years, which is about 4.4e9 years.

Looking back at the options, option D has a half-life of 4.5e9 years, which is close to 4.4e9, so that's probably correct. Option I has a half-life of 6.5e9, which is way off. So (a) is 9.84e24, (b) is ~4.4e9, so the correct option is D: 9.84e24, 4.5e9 years.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the half-life. Maybe I made an error in the division.

Wait, 1.3862e17 divided by 3.154e7 is (1.3862 / 3.154) * 1e10. Let me compute 1.3862 / 3.154:

Well, 3.154 * 0.439 is approx 1.386 because 3.154 * 0.4 is 1.2616, 0.03 is 0.09462, 0.009 is 0.028386 → total about 1.3846, which is close to 1.3862. So yes, 0.439 gives approx 1.386. So 0.439e10 is 4.39e9, which is 4.39 billion years. So the closest option is 4.5e9, which is option D.

So the correct option is D: 9.84 × 10^24, 4.5 × 10^9 years.

The number of remaining uranium nuclei after 10^8 years is calculated using the decay formula \( N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} \). Converting \( t = 10^8 \) years to seconds gives \( t = 3.154 \times 10^{15} \) seconds. With \( \lambda = 5 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1} \), the decay factor \( \lambda t \) is \( 0.01577 \), and \( e^{-0.01577} \approx 0.9843 \). Thus, \( N \approx 10^{25} \times 0.9843 = 9.84 \times 10^{24} \).

For the half-life \( T_{1/2} \), using \( T_{1/2} = \ln(2)/\lambda \), we find \( T_{1/2} \approx 1.386 \times 10^{17} \) seconds. Converting to years gives \( T_{1/2} \approx 4.39 \times 10^9 \) years, which rounds to \( 4.5 \times 10^9 \) years.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: \( 9.84 \times 10^{24}, 4.5 \times 10^9 \) years.
