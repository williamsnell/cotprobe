Question:

A wedding planner owned a summer cottage on the lake. In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, which is located on a knoll above the lake, the wedding planner entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notif'ing the neighbor, the wedding planner proceeded with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the wedding planner sold his lakefront property to an artist. Shortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the artist's property. The interest that the wedding planner acquired in the access road may best be described as

Options:

A: an easement by estoppel.
B: an easement of light and air.
C: a prescriptive easement.
D: an express easement.
E: a profit a prendre.
F: an easement by necessity.
G: an easement implied by prior use.
H: a license.
I: an easement of support.
J: an easement in gross.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically about easements. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best to work through it.

The question is about a wedding planner who owns a summer cottage on a knoll above a lake. To get to the cottage, the wedding planner made an agreement with a neighbor, the landowner, to have a right-of-way over a strip of land. The agreement was in writing, granting a 30-foot wide strip a quarter mile long along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property.

So, the wedding planner then decided to improve the road by having it asphalted without telling the neighbor. Years later, the neighbor started a sand business that involved heavy hauling, which destroyed the asphalt. Then, ten years after that, the wedding planner sold the property to an artist. The artist took over, and the neighbor put up wooden barriers, blocking access. The question is about the type of easement the wedding planner acquired.

I need to figure out which of the options (A-J) best describes the interest the wedding planner had in the access road.

First, let's recall the types of easements:

1. **Express Easement (D):** This is created by a clear agreement in writing, usually a deed. It's the most straightforward. The question mentions that the wedding planner had a written agreement, so this seems relevant.

2. **Easement by Estoppel (A):** This arises when one party relies on another's representations to their detriment, and it's not based on a written agreement. But here, there was a written agreement, so this might not be it.

3. **Easement by Necessity (F):** This is when an easement is necessary for the use of a property, like landlocked property. The question doesn't say the wedding planner was landlocked; the cottage was on a knoll, but it's unclear if without the easement, it's inaccessible. Maybe, but the written agreement suggests it's express, not by necessity.

4. **Prescriptive Easement (C):** This is acquired through continuous, open, and notorious use for a certain period, without the owner's permission. But here, the wedding planner had permission via the written agreement, so this isn't prescriptive.

5. **Easement Implied by Prior Use (G):** This arises when a parcel of land is divided and the use of a part of the land was apparent and continuous before the division. But here, the original owner (the neighbor) granted the easement in writing, so it's more likely express.

6. **Easement in Gross (J):** This is an easement that benefits a person or entity rather than land. If the easement was for the specific benefit of the wedding planner's property, it's appurtenant. But if it's for a commercial purpose, it might be in gross. But here, it's for access to a cottage, so probably appurtenant.

7. **Profit Ã  Prendre (E):** This is the right to take resources from the land, like minerals. Not relevant here since it's about access, not extraction.

8. **Easement of Support (I):** This is about supporting a structure, like a wall. Doesn't fit the scenario.

9. **Easement of Light and Air (B):** This is about maintaining light and air through a certain opening. Not applicable here.

10. **License (H):** This is a personal right to use land, revocable. But the question mentions a written grant, which usually creates an easement, not a license.

Now, the key point is that the wedding planner had a written agreement granting the right-of-way. That strongly suggests an express easement (D). But wait, there's a twist: the neighbor later started a sand business and destroyed the road, and then blocked access. But the easement should still exist regardless of the neighbor's actions unless it was terminated properly. Since the easement was in writing, it was an express easement.

Another point: the artist bought the property later. Since the easement was already in place and appurtenant to the land, when the wedding planner sold, the easement would transfer to the new owner. So the type of easement remains the same.

I think the answer is D: an express easement. The written agreement is the key here. It wasn't by necessity or implied; it was explicitly granted.

The wedding planner acquired a right-of-way through a written agreement, which is the hallmark of an express easement. The written grant establishes a clear and intentional creation of the easement, distinguishing it from other types. The subsequent actions of the neighbor, such as heavy hauling and erecting barriers, do not negate the existence of the easement. Therefore, the interest is best described as an express easement.

Answer: D
