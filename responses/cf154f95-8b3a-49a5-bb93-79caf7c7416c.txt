Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: A container weighs 3.22 lb force when empty. When filled with water at 60°F, the mass of the container and its contents is 1.95 slugs. I need to find its volume in cubic feet. The density of water is given as 62.4 lb force per cubic foot. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I think the container has a certain mass when empty, and when filled with water, the total mass increases. But wait, wait a second. The container's weight when empty is 3.22 lb force. So that's the force due to gravity on the container alone. But when filled with water, the total mass is given as 1.95 slugs. Wait, wait—mass in slugs? Because in the slug system, force (lb) equals mass (slug) times acceleration (ft/s²). So the container's weight when empty is 3.22 lb. That would be its mass times g, right?

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused between weight and mass. Let me think. Weight is a force. So when the container is empty, its weight is 3.22 lb. So that's the force due to gravity on the container alone. So the mass of the container would be weight divided by g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. But in the slug system, g is 32.174 ft/s². So mass m = force (weight) / g.

But when the container is filled with water, the total mass is 1.95 slugs. That total mass includes both the container and the water. So the mass of the container plus the mass of the water equals 1.95 slugs.

Wait, but the container's mass when empty is m_container = weight_empty / g = 3.22 lb / 32.174 ft/s². Let me calculate that. 3.22 divided by 32.174. Let me approximate: 32.174 is roughly 32. So 3.22 /32 is about 0.1006 slugs. Let me check: 3.22 ÷ 32.174 ≈ 0.1001 slugs. So the container's mass is about 0.1001 slugs.

Then, when filled with water, the total mass is 1.95 slugs. So the mass of the water would be total mass minus container mass: 1.95 - 0.1001 ≈ 1.8499 slugs. That’s the mass of the water in slugs.

But wait, the density of water is given in lb/ft³. Since density is mass per unit volume, but in this case, density is given as 62.4 lb/ft³. Wait, but in the slug system, density is in slugs per cubic foot because 1 slug is the mass that weighs one pound. So perhaps I should convert the water's mass into pounds force to find the volume.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The density is given as 62.4 lb/ft³. That's the weight density because lb is a force unit. So to find the volume, I can use the formula:

Weight of water = density × volume.

But the mass of the water is 1.8499 slugs. Since 1 slug = 1 lb * s²/ft, because F=ma, so 1 slug = 1 lb / (32.174 ft/s²) ≈ 0.03107 lb. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 slug is the mass that when multiplied by 1 ft/s² gives 1 lb of force. So 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft. So to convert slugs to pounds mass, I think the formula is mass (slugs) × g = weight (pounds).

So the weight of the water would be 1.8499 slugs × g (32.174 ft/s²) = 1.8499 × 32.174 ≈ let's calculate that. 1.8499 × 32 ≈ 59.2 (exactly: 1.8499 ×32.174 ≈ let me compute 1.8499 *32=59.1968, plus 1.8499*0.174≈0.3217, so total ≈59.5185 lb force.

So the weight of the water is approximately 59.5185 lb. Now, using the density formula: density = weight / volume → volume = weight / density.

So volume = 59.5185 lb / 62.4 lb/ft³ ≈ 0.9536 ft³. Looking at the options, option A is 0.955, which is close. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Empty container's weight is 3.22 lb, so its mass is 3.22 /32.174 ≈ 0.1001 slugs.

2. Total mass when filled is 1.95 slugs, so water mass is 1.95 - 0.1001 ≈ 1.8499 slugs.

3. Convert water mass to weight: 1.8499 slugs × 32.174 ft/s² ≈59.5185 lb.

4. Volume = 59.5185 /62.4 ≈0.9536 ft³, which is approximately 0.954, so option A: 0.955 is the closest.

Wait, but perhaps I can do this another way without converting to weight. Since density is given as 62.4 lb/ft³, which is weight density. Alternatively, I can think in terms of mass. Wait, but in the slug system, the mass density would be different. Alternatively, maybe I can find the volume directly using the mass of water in slugs.

Wait, density in mass terms is mass/volume. So if the density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³, but that's a weight density. So to get mass density, perhaps I can divide by g. Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume using the mass in slugs and the density in slugs per cubic foot.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. The density of water is given as 62.4 lb/ft³, which is weight per volume. So when the container is filled with water, the weight of the water is (density) × volume. The container's weight is 3.22 lb, and the total weight when filled is container's weight plus water's weight.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the problem states that the mass of the container and its contents is 1.95 slugs. So that's the total mass. So mass of container plus mass of water equals 1.95 slugs. So mass of water is 1.95 - m_container.

But the container's mass is m_container = weight_empty / g = 3.22 lb /32.174 ft/s² ≈ 0.1001 slugs, as before.

So mass of water is 1.95 - 0.1001 ≈ 1.8499 slugs.

Now, to find the volume, I can use the fact that the density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³, which is weight per volume. But since I have the mass of the water in slugs, perhaps I can find the volume by considering that the weight of the water is mass × g. So the weight of the water is 1.8499 slugs ×32.174 ft/s² ≈59.5185 lb, as before.

Then volume is weight / density = 59.5185 lb /62.4 lb/ft³ ≈0.9536 ft³, which rounds to 0.954, so the closest option is A:0.955.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume directly using the mass in slugs and the density in lb/ft³. Wait, but density in lb/ft³ is a weight per volume, not a mass per volume. So perhaps another approach is to realize that the mass of the water in slugs is equal to the volume multiplied by the mass density. But I'm not sure about the mass density in slugs per cubic foot.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the mass density of water in slugs per cubic foot. Since density (mass) = density (weight) / g. So 62.4 lb/ft³ divided by 32.174 ft/s² ≈ 1.939 slugs/ft³.

So mass of water is 1.8499 slugs. So volume = mass / density (mass) = 1.8499 /1.939 ≈0.954 ft³, same as before.

So either way, I get approximately 0.954, which is option A:0.955.
</think>

The container's empty weight is 3.22 lb, so its mass is 3.22 / 32.174 ≈ 0.1001 slugs. When filled, the total mass is 1.95 slugs, so the water's mass is 1.95 - 0.1001 ≈ 1.8499 slugs. Converting this to weight: 1.8499 × 32.174 ≈ 59.5185 lb. Using the water density (62.4 lb/ft³), the volume is 59.5185 / 62.4 ≈ 0.954 ft³, closest to option A: 0.955.
