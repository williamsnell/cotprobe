Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: A horizontal force of 5 N is required to maintain a velocity of 2 m/s for a box of mass 10 kg sliding over a certain rough surface. How much work is done by the force in 1 minute?

Hmm, I remember that work done is generally calculated by the formula Work = Force × Distance. But wait, I think I need to consider whether the force is constant and in the direction of motion. Since the force is applied horizontally and the box is moving, I guess the force is in the same direction as displacement, so I can proceed.

But wait, the box is moving at a constant velocity, which is 2 m/s. That means the net force on the box is zero because acceleration is zero. Oh right, Newton's first law says that if the velocity is constant, the net force is zero. So the applied force (5 N) must be balancing the frictional force. But that doesn't directly affect the work done by the applied force, I think.

So, the work done by the force would be the force multiplied by the distance the box moves in that time. But how do I find the distance? Well, velocity is distance over time, so distance equals velocity multiplied by time.

The time given is 1 minute. I should convert that to seconds because the velocity is in m/s. One minute is 60 seconds. So time t = 60 s.

Distance = velocity × time = 2 m/s × 60 s = 120 meters.

Now, the work done by the 5 N force is Force × Distance. So 5 N × 120 m = 600 J. Wait, but wait a minute! Because the box is moving at constant velocity, the applied force is overcoming friction, but is the work done by the force equal to Force × distance? Yes, because work is force times displacement in the direction of the force. So even though there's friction, the work done by the applied force is 5 N × 120 m = 600 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 600 J. But wait, another thought: did I miss any component, like the fact that the force is just overcoming friction and maybe not moving the box upwards or something? No, because in this case, the displacement is purely horizontal, same as the direction of the force. So I think 600 J is correct.

Wait, but wait again. Another approach: since the force is applied but the box is moving at constant velocity, the net work done should be zero because the change in kinetic energy is zero (since velocity isn't changing). That's because Work_net = ΔKE. But the question isn't about net work; it's about the work done by the applied force alone. So the net work is zero, but the individual works would include the applied force's work and the friction's work.

So the applied force does positive work, and friction does negative work. The sum is zero. So the work done by the 5 N force is indeed positive 600 J, while friction does -600 J, canceling each other out.

So the answer must be 600 J, which is option C.

The work done by the force is calculated by multiplying the force by the distance moved in the direction of the force. The box moves at a constant velocity, so the distance is found by multiplying velocity (2 m/s) by time (60 seconds), giving 120 meters. The work done is then 5 N × 120 m = 600 J. 

Answer: C
