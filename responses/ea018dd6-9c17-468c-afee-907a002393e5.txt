Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about Corvino's reading of Aquinas regarding "unnatural" sexual acts. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Thomas Aquinas, a medieval theologian and philosopher, had specific views on sexual ethics, especially from a Catholic perspective. His ideas were heavily influenced by Aristotle and the Bible. I think he focused a lot on the purpose of sexual acts, particularly whether they were procreative or not.

In Aquinas's view, sexual acts were meant to be within marriage and for the purposes of procreation. He saw the act as not just physical but also moral and spiritual. So, any sexual act that wasn't aimed at procreation would be considered unnatural or against the divine plan. This includes things like homosexuality, which he believed wasn't for procreation, and thus were sins.

Now, Corvino is a contemporary ethicist who has discussed Aquinas's views. From what I recall, Corvino's reading emphasizes that Aquinas saw the naturalness of a sexual act based on whether it's oriented towards procreation. So, if the act isn't aimed at making babies, it's considered unnatural.

Looking at the options:

A: performed outside of marriage – Aquinas did think sex should be within marriage, but I'm not sure if this is the key point about "unnatural." He was more focused on the procreative aspect than just the setting.

B: non-consensual. – Non-consensual acts are wrong for many reasons, but I don't think Aquinas's unnaturalness is about consent. It's more about the purpose.

C: practiced among adolescents. – Adolescents might not be married, but the issue here is about the act itself, not the age.

D: not leading to emotional fulfillment. – Aquinas was concerned with procreation and divine order, not so much with emotional aspects.

E: not accepted by societal norms. – Society's norms change, but Aquinas's view was based on religious teachings, not societal acceptance.

F: deliberately pro-creative. – Wait, no, because the question is about unnatural acts. So if F is pro-creative, that's the opposite. Unnatural would be not pro-creative.

G: involving multiple partners. – Polygamy or multiple partners might be against marriage norms, but again, the key for Aquinas was procreation.

H: uncommonly practiced among adults. – Uncommonness doesn't define naturalness in Aquinas's view.

I: deliberately non-procreative. – This seems to fit because Aquinas would see acts not aimed at procreation as unnatural.

J: not endorsed by religious institutions. – Similar to E, it's more about societal or institutional approval, not the intrinsic nature.

So putting it all together, the unnatural acts are those that aren't aimed at procreation. Therefore, the correct option is I: deliberately non-procreative.

The correct answer is I: deliberately non-procreative.
