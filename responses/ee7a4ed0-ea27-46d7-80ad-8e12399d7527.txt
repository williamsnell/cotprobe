Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the total heat transfer rate across an air space in a wall. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says the wall is 6 inches thick and 9 feet high. The inner and outer surfaces of the vertical air space have emissivity of 0.90. The inner wall surface is at 95°F, and the outer one is at 125°F. I need to find the heat transfer rate.

I remember that heat transfer through radiation can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula I think is Q = εσAΔT^4, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, the formula is Q = εσA(T1^4 - T2^4), where T1 and T2 are the absolute temperatures in Kelvin. But wait, the temperatures given are in Fahrenheit, so I need to convert them to Kelvin first.

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. Stefan-Boltzmann law is Q = εσA(T^4), but since there are two surfaces, inner and outer, the net heat transfer would be the difference between the radiation emitted by each. So the net Q would be εσA(T1^4 - T2^4), where T1 is the hotter surface and T2 is the cooler one. Oh wait, no, actually, each surface emits radiation. So the inner surface at 95°F is T1, and the outer at 125°F is T2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the inner surface is at 95°F, and the outer is at 125°F. So the outer surface is hotter than the inner. So the net heat transfer would be from the outer to the inner? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, wait. In a typical scenario, heat flows from higher temperature to lower. So if the outer surface is hotter (125°F) than the inner (95°F), heat would transfer from the outer to the inner. So the net radiation would be Q = εσA(T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

Wait, but I'm not sure if emissivity is the same for both surfaces. Oh, the problem says the emissivity of both inner and outer surfaces is 0.90, so ε is the same for both. So the net emission would be the difference between the two.

So first, I need to convert both temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Let me recall the conversion: K = (°F + 459.67) * 5/9.

So for T_inner: 95°F. Let me calculate that. 95 + 459.67 = 554.67. Multiply by 5/9: 554.67 * 5 = 2773.35, divided by 9 is approximately 308.15 K.

T_outer: 125°F. 125 + 459.67 = 584.67. Multiply by 5/9: 584.67 * 5 = 2923.35, divided by 9 is around 324.817 K.

Now, I need to compute T_outer^4 and T_inner^4. That's a big number, but maybe I can use an approximation or calculator. Let's see.

T_inner^4: (308.15)^4. Hmm. Let's compute 308^4. Alternatively, maybe use exponents step by step. 308.15 squared is about 308.15 * 308.15. Let me approximate that. 300^2 is 90,000. 308.15 is a bit more, so 308^2 is 94,864. Then, 308^4 would be (94,864)^2. But that's a huge number. Maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (x)^4 = x^2 * x^2. So for 308.15:

308.15^2 ≈ (300 + 8.15)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*8.15 + 8.15^2 = 90,000 + 4,890 + ~66 ≈ 94,956.

Then, 94,956^2 is about (9.4956e4)^2 = approx 9.02e9? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 94,956 * 94,956 = let me think. Let me compute 94,956 * 94,956: 

Well, 95,000^2 is 9,025,000,000. Since 94,956 is 44 less than 95,000, maybe the square is (95,000 - 44)^2 = 95,000^2 - 2*95,000*44 + 44^2 = 9,025,000,000 - 8,360,000 + 1,936 ≈ 9,025,000,000 - 8,360,000 = 9,016,640,000. Then add 1,936 gives 9,016,641,936. So approximately 9.016641936e9.

Wait, but that's just for 308.15^4. Similarly, for 324.817 K:

324.817^4. Let's compute 324.817^2 first. 324.817^2 = ?

324^2 is 104,976. 0.817^2 is about 0.667. But more accurately, (324 + 0.817)^2 = 324^2 + 2*324*0.817 + 0.817^2. So 104,976 + 2*324*0.817 ≈ 104,976 + 527.532 ≈ 105,503.532. Then plus 0.667 gives around 105,504.199. So 324.817^2 ≈ 105,504.2.

Then, 105,504.2^2 is (1.055042e5)^2 = approx 1.113e10? Let me compute 105,504.2 * 105,504.2. Let me approximate:

= (100,000 + 5,504.2)^2 = 100,000^2 + 2*100,000*5,504.2 + 5,504.2^2.

= 10,000,000,000 + 1,100,840,000 + (approx 5,504.2^2). 5,504.2^2 is about 30,290,000 (since 5,500^2 is 30,250,000). So total is 10,000,000,000 + 1,100,840,000 = 11,100,840,000 + 30,290,000 ≈ 11,131,130,000. So 324.817^4 ≈ 1.113113e10.

Now, the difference between T_outer^4 and T_inner^4 is 1.113113e10 - 9.016641936e9 ≈ 2.114488e9.

Now, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is 5.670374419 × 10^-8 W/m²·K^4. But wait, the answer options are in Btu/hr·ft², so I need to make sure the units are compatible.

Wait, let me think about the units. The formula I'm using is in SI units, but the answer is in imperial. So perhaps I should convert σ to Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4). Alternatively, maybe use the formula in consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula in imperial units. Let me recall that 1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr, and 1 m² = 10.7639 ft². So let's see.

But wait, maybe I can find the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4). I think σ is approximately 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4). Let me confirm that. Hmm, I think that's correct because 5.67e-8 W/m²·K^4 is equivalent to about 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4). Let me double-check that conversion.

So σ = 5.67e-8 W/(m²·K^4) → convert to Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4).

We know that 1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr, 1 m² = 10.7639 ft², and 1 K = 1.8 °R (since °R = °C + 273.15). So the conversion factor would be:

σ = 5.67e-8 W/(m²·K^4) * (3.41214 Btu/hr/W) * (1 m²/10.7639 ft²) * (1 K^4 / (1.8 °R)^4).

Calculating that:

First, 5.67e-8 * 3.41214 ≈ 5.67e-8 * 3.412 ≈ 1.936e-7.

Then, divide by 10.7639: 1.936e-7 / 10.7639 ≈ 1.800e-8.

Then, divide by (1.8)^4: (1.8)^4 is 10.4976. So 1.800e-8 / 10.4976 ≈ 1.715e-9. Wait, that doesn't match my initial thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute each step:

1. σ in W/(m²·K^4) is 5.670374419e-8.

2. Convert W to Btu/hr: 5.670374419e-8 W/m²·K^4 * 3.41214 Btu/hr/W = 5.670374419e-8 * 3.41214 ≈ 1.936e-7 Btu/(hr·m²·K^4).

3. Convert m² to ft²: 1 m² = 10.7639 ft². So 1/(m²) = 1/(10.7639 ft²). So 1.936e-7 / 10.7639 ≈ 1.800e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4).

4. Now, K to °R: 1 K = 1.8 °R, so K^4 = (1.8)^4 °R^4 = 10.4976 °R^4. So 1/(K^4) = 1/(10.4976 °R^4).

So multiply by 1/(10.4976): 1.800e-8 / 10.4976 ≈ 1.715e-9 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4).

Wait, that's a very small number. Hmm, maybe I'm doing this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conversion that σ = 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4). Let me see: 5.67e-8 W/m²·K^4 * (3.41214 Btu/(W·hr)) * (1 m²/10.7639 ft²) * (1 K^4 / (1.8)^4 °R^4) = ?

Let me compute step by step:

5.67e-8 W/m²·K^4
× 3.41214 Btu/(W·hr) → 5.67e-8 * 3.41214 ≈ 1.936e-7 Btu/(m²·hr·K^4)
× 1 m²/(10.7639 ft²) → 1.936e-7 / 10.7639 ≈ 1.800e-8 Btu/(ft²·hr·K^4)
× 1 K^4/( (1.8)^4 °R^4 ) → (1.8)^4 = 10.4976 → 1.800e-8 / 10.4976 ≈ 1.715e-9 Btu/(ft²·hr·°R^4)

Hmm, that's about 1.715e-9, which is much smaller than 0.173. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct value is 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4). Let me check online: Oh wait, I can't actually look it up, but I think I'm miscalculating the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me use the formula with the given temperatures in Fahrenheit, but converted to Rankine. Because in imperial units, temperatures are in Rankine, and I can use σ as 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4).

So, Rankine is Fahrenheit plus 459.67. So T_inner = 95°F → 95 + 459.67 = 554.67 °R. T_outer = 125°F → 125 + 459.67 = 584.67 °R.

Now, the formula is Q = εσA (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

But wait, the problem is asking for heat transfer rate per unit area, so perhaps the area is given as 1 square foot? Or is the area per unit length? Wait, the wall is 9 ft high and 6 in thick. Wait, but the question is about the heat transfer rate across the air space, which is per square foot of the surface area. Wait, perhaps the area A here is per square foot, and the question is asking for the rate per square foot, so the answer would be in Btu/hr·ft².

So, let's compute the difference in T^4:

T_outer^4 = (584.67)^4 → let's compute that. 584.67^2 is approximately 584.67 * 584.67. Let's calculate that: 584 * 584 = 341,056. Then, considering the decimals, perhaps it's around 341,056 plus some. Let me approximate 584.67^2 ≈ 341,056 + 2*584*0.67 + (0.67)^2 → 341,056 + 776.32 + 0.4489 ≈ 341,832.7689.

Then, 341,832.7689^2 is (3.418327689e5)^2. Let me approximate that as (3.418e5)^2 = 1.167e11. But more accurately, 341,832.7689^2 ≈ 116,729,000,000 (approx 1.167e11).

Similarly, T_inner^4 = (554.67)^4. Compute 554.67^2 first: 554.67^2 = let's see, 550^2=302,500. 4.67^2≈21.8. Then, 2*550*4.67 = 2*550=1100 *4.67≈5,137. So, 554.67^2 ≈ 302,500 + 5,137 +21.8 ≈ 307,658.8.

Then, 307,658.8^2 is approximately (3.076588e5)^2 = 9.46e10. Let me compute:

307,658.8 * 307,658.8 ≈ (3.076588e5)^2 = approx 9.46e10.

So, T_outer^4 - T_inner^4 ≈ 1.167e11 - 9.46e10 ≈ 2.21e10.

Now, using σ = 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4), and ε = 0.90.

So Q = ε * σ * A * (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

But wait, the problem is asking for the heat transfer rate across the air space, which is per square foot. So A is 1 ft², so the formula simplifies to:

Q = 0.90 * 0.173 * (2.21e10) [since A=1].

Wait, let's compute that:

0.90 * 0.173 = 0.1557.

Then, 0.1557 * 2.21e10 ≈ 0.1557 * 2.21e10 ≈ 3.44e9 Btu/hr·ft².

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 20s to 60s. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the T^4 values. Let me recalculate them more accurately.

Let me compute T_outer = 584.67 °R.

Compute T_outer^4: 584.67^4.

First, 584.67^2: 584.67 * 584.67.

Let me compute 584.67 * 584.67:

584.67 * 500 = 292,335.

584.67 * 80 = 46,773.6.

584.67 * 4.67 ≈ 584.67 *4 = 2,338.68; 584.67 *0.67 ≈ 391.18.

So total for 584.67 * 584.67 ≈ 292,335 + 46,773.6 = 339,108.6 + 2,338.68 = 341,447.28 + 391.18 ≈ 341,838.46.

So 584.67^2 ≈ 341,838.46.

Now, 341,838.46^2:

Let me compute 341,838.46 * 341,838.46.

Well, (3.4183846e5)^2 = (3.4183846)^2 * 1e10.

3.4183846^2 ≈ 11.678. So 11.678e10, which is 1.1678e11.

Similarly, T_inner =554.67 °R.

554.67^2: 554.67 * 554.67.

Compute 554 *554 = 306,916. Now, 0.67^2 = 0.4489. The cross terms: 2*554*0.67 = 2*554=1108 *0.67 ≈ 742.76.

So 554.67^2 ≈ 306,916 + 742.76 + 0.4489 ≈ 307,659.2089.

Then, 307,659.2089^2: same as (3.076592089e5)^2 = (3.076592089)^2 * 1e10 ≈ 9.463e10.

So, T_outer^4 - T_inner^4 ≈ 1.1678e11 - 9.463e10 ≈ 2.215e10.

Now, using σ=0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4), ε=0.90.

So Q = 0.90 * 0.173 * 2.215e10.

Compute 0.90 * 0.173 = 0.1557.

Then, 0.1557 * 2.215e10 ≈ 0.1557 * 2.215e10.

0.1557 * 2.215 ≈ 0.3445.

So 0.3445e10 = 3.445e9 Btu/hr·ft². That's way too high compared to the options. So I must have made a mistake in unit conversion or approach.

Wait a second, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Oh wait! Wait, the emissivity is for both surfaces, but in reality, each surface emits radiation. The net radiation emitted by the outer surface is εσA(T_outer^4), and the inner surface emits εσA(T_inner^4). So the net heat transfer would be the outer emission minus the inner emission, which is εσA(T_outer^4 - T_inner^4). But wait, I'm getting a very high number, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the emissivity is the same for both surfaces, so the net heat transfer per unit area is Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4), where T1 is the outer temperature and T2 is the inner.

Wait, but with the numbers I have, that's Q = 0.90 * 0.173 * (584.67^4 - 554.67^4) [in Btu/(hr·ft²)].

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me 0.90*0.173*(2.215e10) = 3.445e9 Btu/hr·ft², which is way off. So I must have messed up the conversion of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in a different way. Let me try using the formula in SI units and then convert to Btu/hr·ft².

So, let's compute Q in watts per square meter, then convert to Btu/hr·ft².

The formula is Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4), where T is in Kelvin.

Compute T_inner = 95°F = 308.15 K, T_outer = 125°F = 324.817 K.

So T_outer^4 ≈ (324.817)^4 ≈ let's compute:

324.817^2 = 105,504.2 (as before).

Then, 105,504.2^2 ≈ 11.131e9 W/m²·K^4.

Similarly, T_inner^4 ≈ (308.15)^4 ≈ 9.0166e9 W/m²·K^4.

So the difference is 11.131e9 - 9.0166e9 ≈ 2.1144e9 W/m²·K^4.

Now, ε = 0.90, σ = 5.67e-8 W/m²·K^4.

So Q = 0.90 * 5.67e-8 * 2.1144e9.

Compute that: 0.90 *5.67e-8 = 5.103e-8.

5.103e-8 * 2.1144e9 = 5.103e-8 * 2.1144e9 = (5.103 * 2.1144) * 1e1 ≈ 10.787 * 10 = 107.87 W/m².

Now, convert 107.87 W/m² to Btu/hr·ft².

We know that 1 W/m² = 0.173026 Btu/hr·ft².

So 107.87 W/m² * 0.173026 ≈ let's compute:

100 W/m² → 17.3026 Btu/hr·ft².

7.87 W/m² → approx 7.87 * 0.173 ≈ 1.365 Btu/hr·ft².

So total ≈ 17.3026 + 1.365 ≈ 18.667 Btu/hr·ft².

Wait, but none of the options are around 18. Hmm, the closest option is J: 20.46, but that's still not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute 5.103e-8 * 2.1144e9:

5.103e-8 * 2.1144e9 = (5.103 * 2.1144) * 1e( -8 +9 ) = (10.787) * 1e1 = 107.87 W/m².

Wait, that's correct. So 107.87 W/m² * 0.173026 ≈ 107.87 * 0.173 ≈ 18.667 Btu/hr·ft².

But the options don't have 18.667. The options are A:45.46, B:30.46, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the emissivity. Oh wait, wait! I think I see the problem. The emissivity for each surface is 0.90, but in the net radiation, I should consider that the outer surface emits at T_outer^4, and the inner at T_inner^4. So the net is ε*(T_outer^4 - T_inner^4), but wait, no, because each surface has emissivity ε. So the net heat transfer would be εσA(T_outer^4 - T_inner^4). But wait, that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the inner surface is at 95°F and the outer at 125°F, so heat flows from outer to inner. So the net Q would be positive when T_outer > T_inner.

Wait, but the calculation gave me about 18.667 Btu/hr·ft², which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps I should use the conversion factor 1 W/m² = 0.173026 Btu/hr·ft². Let me verify that:

1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr.

1 m² = 10.7639 ft².

So 1 W/m² = 3.41214 Btu/hr / 10.7639 ft² ≈ 0.3166 Btu/hr·ft².

Wait, that's different from what I used earlier. So perhaps I was wrong in using 0.173 earlier. So let's recalculate.

So, using the correct conversion factor: 1 W/m² = 3.41214 / 10.7639 ≈ 0.3166 Btu/hr·ft².

So, the Q in W/m² was 107.87 W/m².

Convert that to Btu/hr·ft²: 107.87 * 0.3166 ≈ 34.10 Btu/hr·ft².

Hmm, that's around 34.1, which is close to option F:35.46.

But let's compute it accurately.

107.87 W/m² * (3.41214 Btu/hr/W) * (1 m²/10.7639 ft²) = 107.87 * 3.41214 / 10.7639 ≈ ?

Compute numerator: 107.87 * 3.41214 ≈ 107.87 *3 = 323.61; 107.87 *0.41214≈44.43. So total ≈ 323.61 +44.43=368.04.

Then, divide by 10.7639: 368.04 /10.7639 ≈ 34.19 Btu/hr·ft².

Looking at the options, the closest is F:35.46. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of T^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the emissivity correctly. Wait, another approach: the net radiation emitted by the outer surface is εσA(T_outer^4), and the inner surface emits εσA(T_inner^4). So the net heat transfer is εσA(T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

But perhaps I should use the average temperature or another method. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each surface emits radiation, and the net is the difference.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the emissivity is for each surface, but the net transfer is from outer to inner. So the formula is Q = εσA (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

So using the correct conversion factor:

Q in W/m² is 107.87 W/m².

Convert to Btu/hr·ft²: 107.87 * 0.3166 ≈ 34.19.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:35.46. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for T^4.

Let me compute T_outer^4 and T_inner^4 more accurately.

Compute T_outer = 324.817 K.

Compute 324.817^4:

324.817^2 = 324.817 * 324.817.

Let me compute it more accurately:

324.817 * 324.817:

= (300 + 24.817) * (300 +24.817)

= 300^2 + 2*300*24.817 + 24.817^2

= 90,000 + 2*300*24.817 + (24.817)^2

2*300*24.817 = 600 *24.817 = 14,890.2

24.817^2 = 616.05 (since 24^2=576, 0.817^2≈0.667, and cross terms 2*24*0.817≈39.888 → 576 +39.888 +0.667≈616.555).

So total T_outer^2 ≈ 90,000 +14,890.2 +616.555 ≈ 105,506.755 K².

Then, T_outer^4 = (105,506.755)^2.

Compute 105,506.755^2:

Let me approximate it as (1.05506755e5)^2 = (1.05506755)^2 * 1e10.

1.05506755^2 ≈ 1.113.

So T_outer^4 ≈ 1.113e10 W/m²·K^4.

Similarly, T_inner=308.15 K.

308.15^2 = 308.15 *308.15.

Compute:

= (300 +8.15)^2

=300^2 +2*300*8.15 +8.15^2

=90,000 +4,890 +66.4225 ≈94,956.4225.

Then, T_inner^4 = (94,956.4225)^2 ≈ (9.49564225e4)^2 = approx 9.02e9 W/m²·K^4.

So difference: 1.113e10 -9.02e9 ≈ 2.11e9 W/m²·K^4.

Now, Q = εσA (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) → 0.90 *5.67e-8 *2.11e9.

Compute 0.90 *5.67e-8 =5.103e-8.

5.103e-8 *2.11e9 =5.103 *2.11 * 1e1 =10.7733 *10 =107.733 W/m².

Convert to Btu/hr·ft²: 107.733 W/m² * (3.41214 Btu/hr/W) * (1 m²/10.7639 ft²) =107.733 *3.41214 /10.7639 ≈ ?

Compute numerator:107.733 *3.41214 ≈368.1.

Then, 368.1 /10.7639 ≈34.18 Btu/hr·ft².

Again, the same result of approximately 34.18 Btu/hr·ft², which is close to option F:35.46. But perhaps I made a mistake in the emissivity calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4), but perhaps each surface emits and absorbs, so the net is Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4). Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4) / (1/ε1 + 1/ε2 -1), but that's for combined surfaces. Wait, no, that's when they are in series. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, no, the problem states that the inner and outer surfaces are both in the air space, and each has emissivity 0.90. So the net heat transfer would be the radiation from the outer surface minus the radiation to the inner surface.

So Q = εσA (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

But according to the calculation, that gives about 34.18 Btu/hr·ft², which is close to option F:35.46.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the T^4 values. Let me check using more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute T_outer^4 and T_inner^4 using more precise methods.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula in another way. Let me compute the difference in their fourth powers more accurately.

Compute T_outer = 584.67 °R.

Compute T_outer^4:

584.67^2 = 341,838.46.

341,838.46^2 = let's compute 341,838 *341,838.

Well, 341,838 *341,838 = let's compute it as (340,000 +1,838)^2 =340,000^2 + 2*340,000*1,838 +1,838^2.

340,000^2=115,600,000,000.

2*340,000*1,838=680,000*1,838= approx 680,000*1,800=1,224,000,000; 680,000*38=25,840,000. So total ≈1,224,000,000 +25,840,000=1,249,840,000.

1,838^2= approx 3,378,  (since 1,800^2=3,240,000; 38^2=1,444; cross term 2*1,800*38=136,800 → total 3,240,000 +136,800 +1,444=3,378,244.

So total T_outer^4 ≈115,600,000,000 +1,249,840,000 +3,378,244 ≈116,853,218,244.

Similarly, T_inner=554.67 °R.

554.67^2=554.67*554.67≈307,659.21.

307,659.21^2= let's compute 307,659^2.

= (300,000 +7,659)^2 =300,000^2 +2*300,000*7,659 +7,659^2.

300,000^2=90,000,000,000.

2*300,000*7,659=600,000*7,659=4,595,400,000.

7,659^2=58,666,  (since 7,000^2=49,000,000; 659^2=434, 281; cross term 2*7,000*659=9,226,000 → total 49,000,000 +9,226,000 +434,281=58,660,281).

So total T_inner^4≈90,000,000,000 +4,595,400,000 +58,660,281≈94,654,060,281.

Now, the difference T_outer^4 - T_inner^4=116,853,218,244 -94,654,060,281≈22,199,157,963.

Now, compute Q = εσA (ΔT^4) =0.90 *0.173 *22,199,157,963.

Wait, but wait, if σ is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4), then:

Q =0.90 *0.173 * (22,199,157,963) Btu/(hr·ft²).

Compute 0.90*0.173=0.1557.

0.1557 *22,199,157,963≈?

Well, 22,199,157,963 ≈2.2199e10.

0.1557 *2.2199e10 ≈0.346e10=3.46e9 Btu/hr·ft². That's way too high, which can't be right.

Wait, but earlier when I used SI units, I got around 34 Btu/hr·ft². So perhaps I'm making a mistake in using σ as 0.173. Let me double-check the value of σ in imperial units.

Upon checking, I think σ in imperial units is approximately 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4). But when I use this, the result is way too high, but when I use the SI approach and then convert, I get around 34 Btu/hr·ft².

But given that the options are in the 20s to 60s, perhaps the correct answer is around 34.18, which is closest to option F:35.46.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the emissivity applies to both surfaces, but the net radiation is Q = εσA (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4). So with the numbers I have, using the correct conversion, I get approximately 34.18, which would round to 34.2. But option F is 35.46, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of T_outer^4 - T_inner^4. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where the net heat transfer is Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4), where T1 is the outer and T2 is inner.

Using the precise calculation in SI units, I get Q ≈107.733 W/m², which converts to about 34.18 Btu/hr·ft².

Since option F is 35.46, which is close, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the emissivity for both surfaces, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in a different way. Let me think: the heat transfer rate per unit area is Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4).

But perhaps the correct value of σ is 0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4), so let's use that.

Compute T1=584.67, T2=554.67.

So (584.67)^4 - (554.67)^4 = ?

As calculated earlier, approximately 2.2199e10.

So Q = 0.90 *0.173 *2.2199e10 ≈0.90 *0.173=0.1557 *2.2199e10=3.46e9 Btu/hr·ft². That's way too high, so perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q = εσA (T2^4 - T1^4), but that would give a negative value, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the emissivity as 1 for both, but the problem states it's 0.90.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for each surface and subtract.

So, Q_outer = εσA T_outer^4.

Q_inner = εσA T_inner^4.

Net Q = Q_outer - Q_inner = εσA (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

Which is what I did earlier.

So, using the correct conversion, I get approximately 34.18 Btu/hr·ft², which isn't an option. But perhaps the correct approach is to use the emissivity correctly and the correct σ value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the difference in T^4. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute T_outer^4 = (584.67)^4.

Using a calculator approach: 584.67^4 = (584.67)^2 * (584.67)^2.

As earlier, 584.67^2 ≈341,838.46.

Then, 341,838.46^2 = let's compute 341,838 *341,838.

Using a calculator, but since I can't, I'll use an approximation.

341,838 *341,838 ≈ (3.41838e5)^2 = 11.678e10 = 1.1678e11.

Similarly, T_inner^4 = (554.67)^4 ≈ (554.67)^2 * (554.67)^2.

554.67^2 ≈307,659.21.

307,659.21^2 ≈9.463e10.

So, the difference is 1.1678e11 -9.463e10 ≈2.215e10.

Now, using σ=0.173 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4), ε=0.90.

Q=0.90 *0.173 *2.215e10 ≈0.1557 *2.215e10 ≈3.45e9 Btu/hr·ft².

That's way too high, so perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the emissivity is the same for both surfaces, and the net radiation is the difference between their emissions.

So, Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4) = 0.90 *0.173 * (584.67^4 -554.67^4).

But this still gives a very high value, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the air space is in a wall, and perhaps the heat transfer is through convection as well, but the question specifies emissivity, so it's radiation only.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given that my SI unit calculation gave me approximately 34.18 Btu/hr·ft², which isn't an option, but option F is 35.46, which is close, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:45.46, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion factor. Let me check again.

1 W/m² = 3.41214 Btu/hr / 10.7639 ft² ≈0.3166 Btu/hr·ft².

So, 107.733 W/m² *0.3166 ≈34.18 Btu/hr·ft².

Looking at the options, the closest is F:35.46. But perhaps I should recheck the T^4 calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the average temperature for calculations, but I don't think that's standard.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in a different way. Let me try to compute the difference in T^4 again.

Compute T_outer=584.67, T_inner=554.67.

Compute (584.67)^4 - (554.67)^4.

Using a calculator, (584.67)^4 =584.67 *584.67 *584.67 *584.67.

But without a calculator, I can approximate:

We have T_outer^4 - T_inner^4 = (T_outer^2 + T_inner^2)(T_outer^2 - T_inner^2) = (T_outer^2 + T_inner^2)(T_outer - T_inner)(T_outer + T_inner).

So, T_outer + T_inner =584.67 +554.67=1139.34.

T_outer - T_inner=30.

T_outer^2 + T_inner^2=341,838.46 +307,659.21=649,497.67.

So, (649,497.67)*(30)*(1139.34).

Wait, that's 649,497.67 *30=19,484,930.1.

Then multiply by 1139.34: 19,484,930.1 *1139.34 ≈?

Well, 19,484,930 *1000=19,484,930,000.

19,484,930 *139.34≈?

Let me approximate:

19,484,930 *100=1,948,493,000.

19,484,930 *39.34≈?

19,484,930 *30=584,547,900.

19,484,930 *9.34≈182,317,  (since 19,484,930 *9=175,364,370; 19,484,930 *0.34≈6,624,  → total≈175,364,370 +6,624,000=182,  I think this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is approximately 34.18, which isn't among the options, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4) where T1 is 125°F and T2 is 95°F, but using Rankine.

So, T1=584.67, T2=554.67.

Then, Q=0.90 *0.173 * (584.67^4 -554.67^4) → but this gives a very high number, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that 1 Btu/hr·ft² is approximately 10.737 W/m².

Wait, no, that's the inverse. 1 W/m² ≈0.3166 Btu/hr·ft².

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in Rankine and Btu directly.

Final thought: Given the calculations, the closest option is F:35.46. But perhaps the correct answer is E:40.46 or another option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the emissivity application.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is Q = (εσA (T1^4 - T2^4)) / (1/ε - 1), but that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the emissivity is applied differently, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the calculations, I think the closest option is F:35.46.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the total heat transfer rate across a vertical air space in a wall using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The key steps include converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Rankine, applying the emissivity and Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and ensuring proper unit conversions. After detailed calculations, the closest match to the computed value is option F: 35.46 Btu/hr·ft².

**Answer: F**
