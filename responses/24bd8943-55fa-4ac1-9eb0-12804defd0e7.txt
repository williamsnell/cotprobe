Okay, so I have this question about a saw manufacturer and the minimum selling price. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says the manufacturer can produce a saw with direct costs of $13 and overhead or indirect costs of $10. He needs to sell it for a minimum price to avoid a short-term loss. So, I think it's about covering his costs, right?

Wait, so direct costs are $13, which I assume are the materials and labor needed to make the saw. Indirect costs are $10, which might include things like factory overhead, like utilities, rent, etc. So total costs would be $13 plus $10, which is $23. So he needs to sell it for at least $23 to cover his costs.

Looking at the options, option C is $28, which seems higher than $23. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, the question says "minimum price so that he will not incur a short term loss." So he must cover his costs, so the minimum is the cost itself, not a higher amount.

But wait, sometimes in business, the break-even price is the cost, but sometimes they might consider more if there are other factors. Let me think again. The direct costs are $13 and indirect costs are $10. So total cost is $23. So he must sell at least $23 to break even.

So the options are:

A: $35 (way too high)
B: $25
C: $28
D: $30
E: $18
F: $23
G: $10
H: $15
I: $20
J: $13

So the correct answer should be F, which is $23.

The correct answer is F: $23. The manufacturer must sell the saw for at least the total of direct and indirect costs, which is $23, to avoid a short-term loss.

Answer: F
