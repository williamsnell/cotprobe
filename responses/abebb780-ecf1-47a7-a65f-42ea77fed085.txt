Okay, so I've got this problem here about BaskowToys Wholesalers offering Albee Stores a deal on Captain Kirk dolls. The question is asking what the retail price would be, given that Albee buys each doll for $2.10 and the discount is 25-20%. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I think I need to understand what the 25-20% off means. I remember that in business, sometimes discounts are given in a range or as a trade discount. So, 25-20% off might mean that Albee gets a discount of 20% off the retail price, but the wholesaler is offering a range, maybe 25% off as a special deal? Or perhaps it's a two-step discount, like first 25% off and then 20% off? Wait, no, that might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, it could be that the discount is 25% for one quantity and 20% for another, but the question doesn't specify that. Maybe it's just a way of saying the discount is 20% off the retail price, with 25% being the maximum or something else. I'm a bit confused about the exact meaning here.

Wait, perhaps the 25-20% is a series of discounts. Like, first a 25% discount, then an additional 20% off the already discounted price. But that would be a total discount of more than 40%, which seems steep. Alternatively, maybe it's a trade discount where the wholesaler gives a 20% discount off the list price, which is 25% off the retail. No, that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe the 25% is the cost to the wholesaler, and the 20% is their profit margin. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 25-20% refers to the markup. Let me think differently. If Albee buys each doll for $2.10, and they want to sell it at a certain retail price after applying a 25-20% discount. So, maybe the $2.10 is after the discount. Wait, no, the wording says BaskowToys is offering Albee a 25-20% discount off the retail price. So, the $2.10 is what Albee pays after taking the discount. Therefore, $2.10 is the price after a 25% and then a 20% discount? Or is it that the discount is 20% off the retail, making $2.10 the wholesale price.

Wait, let's clarify. The question says BaskowToys is offering Albee a 25-20% discount off the retail price. So, Albee buys each doll for $2.10, which is after the discount. So, $2.10 is the price Albee pays, which is the retail price minus 25% and then 20%, or maybe the total discount is 20% off the retail. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Let me approach it methodically. Let's denote the retail price as R. The discount offered is 25-20%, which I'm interpreting as a 20% discount off the retail. So, Albee buys it for R minus 20% of R, which is 0.8R. So, 0.8R = $2.10. To find R, we divide both sides by 0.8: R = $2.10 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 2.10 divided by 0.8 equals... 2.10 / 0.8 is 2.625, which is $2.63. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options are A:3.50, B:7.00, C:6.00, D:4.50, E:4.00, F:5.00, G:2.50, H:3.00, I:5.50, J:2.80.

Hmm, so none of the options are around $2.63. So maybe I'm interpreting the discount wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the discount is 25% off the retail, making the wholesale price 75% of R. Let's try that. So, 0.75R = $2.10. Then R would be 2.10 / 0.75 = $2.80. Wait, option J is $2.80. But that seems low for a retail price if the wholesale is $2.10. Alternatively, maybe the discount is 25%, so the wholesale price is 75% of R, which gives R as $2.80, but that's an option, J. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the 25-20% refers to a trade discount where the first discount is 25%, then an additional 20% off the reduced price. So, first, 25% off R, then 20% off that.

So, first discount: 25% off R, so the price becomes R * 0.75. Then a 20% discount on that: 0.75R * 0.80 = 0.6R. So, 0.6R = $2.10. Therefore, R = 2.10 / 0.6 = $3.50. Oh, that's option A. That makes sense because 25% off then 20% off would be a total discount of 40% off the original, but the way it's applied is sequential.

Wait, let me check that again. If the retail price is $3.50, then 25% off would be $3.50 * 0.75 = $2.625, which is $2.63. Then 20% off that would be 0.8 * 2.625 = $2.10. Yes, that matches the wholesale price. So the retail price would be $3.50, which is option A.

But wait, the question says "25-20% off the retail price." So it's a single discount of 25% and then another 20%, making it a total of 45% off? Or is it a way of saying the discount is 20% off, with the 25% being something else? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the 25-20% is a series, meaning first a 25% discount, then an additional 20% off. So, the total discount is more than 20%, but the way it's applied is two steps.

So, to find R, the retail price, the calculation would be:

After 25% discount: R * (1 - 0.25) = 0.75R.

Then, an additional 20% off that already discounted price: 0.75R * (1 - 0.20) = 0.75R * 0.80 = 0.6R.

So, 0.6R = $2.10.

Thus, R = $2.10 / 0.6 = $3.50, which is option A.

Yes, that seems correct. So the retail price is $3.50.

The problem involves determining the retail price of the Captain Kirk doll after applying a 25-20% discount. The key steps are:

1. **Understanding the discount**: The 25-20% discount likely refers to two successive discounts. First, a 25% discount is applied, reducing the price to 75% of the original. Then, an additional 20% discount is applied to the already reduced price.

2. **Mathematical calculation**:
   - Let the retail price be \( R \).
   - After a 25% discount: \( R \times 0.75 \).
   - After an additional 20% discount: \( R \times 0.75 \times 0.80 = R \times 0.60 \).
   - Given that the final price Albee pays is \$2.10:  
     \[
     0.60R = 2.10
     \]
   - Solving for \( R \):  
     \[
     R = \frac{2.10}{0.60} = 3.50
     \]

3. **Verification**:  
   - Retail price: \$3.50  
   - After 25% discount: \( 3.50 \times 0.75 = 2.625 \)  
   - After 20% discount: \( 2.625 \times 0.80 = 2.10 \)  

   This matches the given wholesale price.

Thus, the retail price is \$3.50.
