Question:

A new enzyme is found in a transgenic mice that participates in synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. When using radiolabeled compounds to study the enzyme, it is found that the enzyme catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group on one reactant to the other reactant. Which of the following categories would this new enzyme fall under?

Options:

A: Ligase
B: Hydrolase
C: Transferase
D: Synthetase
E: Phosphatase
F: Lyase
G: Oxidoreductase
H: Decarboxylase
I: Kinase
J: Isomerase

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about enzymes and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that a new enzyme is found in transgenic mice, and it's involved in the synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. When they use radiolabeled compounds, the enzyme catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group from one reactant to another. Hmm.

I remember that enzymes have different categories based on the type of reaction they catalyze. There are like a bunch of these categories, right? I'm trying to recall what they all do.

So, the key part here is that the enzyme is moving a nitrogen group from one molecule to another. That sounds a lot like a transfer. Oh wait, transferases are enzymes that transfer specific functional groups from one molecule to another. So, for example, amino transferases transfer amino groups.

Looking at the options, option C is Transferase. That seems to fit because the enzyme is transferring a nitrogen group between the two reactants.

Let me think about the other options to make sure. A ligase usually joins two molecules, like ATP-dependent reactions forming bonds. B hydrolase breaks down bonds using water. D synthetase might build complex molecules, but I'm not sure if that's about transferring groups. E phosphatase removes phosphate groups. F lyase breaks bonds without water, like in decarboxylation. G oxidoreductase deals with electrons, like oxidizing or reducing. H decarboxylase removes carboxyl groups, which might involve G. I kinase transfers phosphate groups, which I know is a big categoryâ€”like adding a phosphate. J isomerase changes the shape of a molecule without changing the components.

Wait, so the question is about moving a nitrogen group. Kinases move phosphates, so that's not it. Transferases move other groups, like amino groups. So yes, C is Transferase. I think that's the right answer.

The enzyme described in the question transfers a nitrogen group from one reactant to another, which aligns with the function of transferases. These enzymes are responsible for transferring specific functional groups between molecules. Other options, such as kinases (which transfer phosphate groups) or ligases (which join molecules), do not fit the described action. Therefore, the correct category for this enzyme is Transferase.

Answer: C
