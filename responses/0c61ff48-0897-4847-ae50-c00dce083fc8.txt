Okay, so I need to figure out when the Babylonian captivity, or the Exile, began. I'm a bit rusty on my Bible history, but I remember it's a significant event in the Old Testament. Let me think. The Exile refers to the time when the people of Judah were taken captive by the Babylonians. I think this happened after the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem.

I recall that the destruction of the Temple was carried out by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. So, the Exile would have started around the same time as the Temple's destruction. Now, when did that happen? I'm pretty sure it was in the 6th century BCE. Let me try to pin down the exact year.

Wait, I remember something about the fall of Jerusalem. Wasn't it around 586 BCE? That sounds familiar. Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem, and after a long siege, the city fell, leading to the destruction of the Temple and the exile of many people to Babylon. 

Looking at the options, I see option G is 586 BCE. That fits with what I was thinking. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Option H is 722 BCE, which I think is when the Assyrians captured Samaria, leading to the Northern Kingdom's exile, but that's a different event. 

Option C is 535 BCE, which is a bit later, so probably after the initial exile. Option D is 515 BCE, which might be when the Temple was rebuilt, but that's after the Exile. Option A is 333 BCE, which is much later, probably during the Hellenistic period. Option B is 1066 CE, which is way too late, medieval times. Option E is 1914 CE, which is modern, so no. Option F is 1492 CE, that's when Columbus sailed, so irrelevant. Option I is 70 CE, that's the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans. Option J is 70 BCE, which is after the Exile, maybe the Maccabean period.

So, putting it all together, the Exile began with the destruction of the Temple in 586 BCE, which is option G.
