Question:

Discuss Murray's theory of motivation and what influence it had on McClelland's development of the Achievement Motivation model.

Options:

A: McClelland's model was influenced by Hull's theory of survival instincts
B: McClelland's model expanded on Murray's theory by introducing the idea that motivation is primarily driven by social comparison, which wasn't a focus in Murray's work.
C: Murray's theory had no influence on McClelland's model
D: McClelland's model was a direct copy of Murray's ideas
E: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's theory of motivation that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives, and that anything leading to positive affect produces approach behavior and anything leading to negative affect produces avoidance behavior.
F: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's emphasis on psychosocial stages of development, which is not actually a part of Murray's theory.
G: McClelland's model disregarded Murray's focus on individual needs and instead proposed that environmental factors are the only determinants of human motivation.
H: McClelland's model was based on the premise that motivation is solely a product of external rewards and punishments, without any influence from Murray's theory.
I: McClelland's model was influenced by Murray's hierarchy of needs, which is a confusion with Maslow's theory, not Murray's.
J: Murray's theory suggested that motivation is derived from subconscious sexual and aggressive drives, which McClelland incorporated directly into his model.

Okay, so I have this question about the influence of Murray's theory on McClelland's Achievement Motivation model. I need to figure out which of the options A through J is correct.

First, I remember that both Murray and McClelland are associated with need theories in psychology. Murray's work was about needs and how they influence behavior. He talked about needs as things that people are motivated to fulfill, and he categorized them into different types, like primary and secondary needs. Primary needs are biological, like eating and sleeping, while secondary needs are more psychological, such as the need for achievement, power, or affiliation.

McClelland's Achievement Motivation theory, on the other hand, focuses specifically on the need for achievement. He believed that the need for achievement is a significant factor in motivating people, especially in work settings. He used assessments like the Thematic Apprehension Test to measure this need.

Now, the question is about how Murray's theory influenced McClelland's model. I think that McClelland built upon Murray's ideas. Murray's theory provided a foundation by discussing various needs and how they drive behavior. McClelland took this further, particularly focusing on the need for achievement, which was part of Murray's secondary needs.

Looking at the options:

Option E says that McClelland's model was influenced by Murray's theory that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives, and that positive affect leads to approach behavior, while negative affect leads to avoidance. That makes sense because both theories discuss how needs drive behavior, and the idea of approach and avoidance is something Murray talked about. So E seems correct.

Option B talks about social comparison, which I don't think is part of Murray's theory. Murray's focus was more on individual needs rather than social comparisons. So B might not be right.

Option I mentions a hierarchy of needs, which is actually associated with Maslow, not Murray. So I can eliminate I.

Option J talks about subconscious drives like sexual and aggressive, which doesn't align with either Murray or McClelland's theories as far as I know.

Option E seems to directly address the influence correctly. It connects Murray's idea of needs and motives driving behavior, which McClelland expanded upon in his model.

The correct answer is E. McClelland's model was influenced by Murray's theory that behavior is driven by individual needs and motives, with positive affect leading to approach behaviors and negative affect leading to avoidance behaviors.

Answer: E
