Question:

The owner of a large unimproved tract of land leased it to a tenant for five years at a monthly rental of $1,500. The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. "The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?

Options:

A: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.
B: The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement.
C: The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.
D: The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers, thereby breaching his responsibilities under the agreement.
E: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.
F: The owner had no legal obligation to share the proceeds of the sale as the tenant had continued to live on the property rent-free for a year.
G: The owner's agreement to pay the tenant was conditional upon the sale price exceeding $250,000, which it did not.
H: The tenant's decision to farm the land was against the rental agreement and hence, a violation of the contract.
I: The tenant's construction of the barn without the owner's explicit permission was a breach of the lease agreement.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this legal question. Let me start by reading the problem carefully and understanding all the details.

The scenario involves a landlord and tenant. The landlord leased a large tract of land to the tenant for five years at $1,500 a month. The lease was for farming use. The tenant built a barn on the land at his own expense, which increased the land's value from $250k to $275k. Then, near the end of the lease, the landlord decided to sell the land and had a dispute with the tenant about compensation for the improvements. They settled with a written agreement.

The agreement says that if the land is sold, the owner will pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds over $250k. The tenant gets to stay rent-free for a year while the owner tries to sell it. After that, the tenant can stay until closing but pays $1k monthly rent.

The owner initially asked $300k but lowered it to $260k because of low interest. The tenant got angry and made negative comments to buyers. Eventually, 14 months after the agreement, the owner sold it for $256k to a buyer who visited when the tenant was away. The tenant had not paid rent for the last two months and moved out. The owner refused to pay any sale proceeds, leading the tenant to sue.

The question is, what's the owner's best defense?

Looking at the options, I need to find which argument is most persuasive. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The tenant breached by not cooperating and hindering the sale. The tenant made negative comments to buyers, which could have hurt the sale. That sounds plausible because the tenant's actions could have contributed to the lower sale price.

Option B: Owner breached by reducing the price without consulting. But the agreement doesn't say the owner must consult the tenant on pricing, so this might not hold.

Option C: The agreement is voidable as a restraint on alienation. I'm not too sure about this. Restraints on alienation are usually clauses that prevent selling, but here it's about sharing proceeds. Not sure if that's a valid point.

Option D: Tenant didn't maintain the property. But the barn was built, which increased the value. The problem was negative comments, not neglecting maintenance.

Option E: Tenant didn't pay rent for two months, so owner's duties are discharged. The lease expired, and the agreement had a new payment structure, but failure to pay rent could be a breach. However, the sale happened before the two months were up, so maybe it's not a direct cause.

Option F: Owner had no obligation because tenant stayed rent-free. But the agreement says the tenant gets rent-free for a year, but after that, pays $1k. The sale happened after 14 months, so the tenant was supposed to pay $1k. But the owner's obligation was tied to the sale proceeds, not about the rent.

Option G: Owner's payment was conditional on sale exceeding $250k. The sale was $256k, which is over $250k, so the condition was met. Wait, the agreement says "in excess of $250k." So 256k is 6k over, so two-thirds of that excess would be 4k. So the owner should pay that. But the owner didn't. Hmm, but the option says the condition wasn't met, which isn't true. So G might not be the right defense.

Option H: Tenant farming was against the agreement. The lease allowed farming, so this isn't valid.

Option I: Tenant built a barn without permission, which was a breach. The lease said land was for farming. Building a barn could be considered an improvement without permission. But the agreement was about compensation, so maybe the landlord can't now claim breach after settling the dispute.

Now, the key is the sale price. The owner sold it for $256k. The agreement says the owner pays two-thirds of any proceeds over $250k. So 256k -250k =6k. Two-thirds is 4k. So owner should pay 4k. But the owner didn't. The tenant sued, and owner is defending.

But the owner might argue that the tenant breached the agreement by not cooperating. The tenant made negative comments, scaring buyers, which might have caused the price to drop from 260k to 256k. So the owner could say the tenant's actions prevented a higher sale, so the tenant is at fault.

Looking at option A: tenant committed a material breach by hindering the sale. If the tenant's actions caused the lower price, the owner could argue that the tenant is responsible, so the owner doesn't have to pay the full amount. Or perhaps the owner can argue that because of the breach, the tenant isn't entitled to any payment.

Alternatively, the tenant's breach might justify the owner's refusal to pay. But the sale was at 256k, which is still over 250k. So the owner's obligation was to pay two-thirds of the excess, which is 4k. So unless the tenant's breach affects the calculation, the owner might still owe that.

Wait, but if the tenant hindered the sale, maybe the sale wouldn't have happened at all, or the price would have been higher. The owner might argue that the tenant's breach made the sale impossible or reduced the price, so the tenant can't collect.

In contract law, a material breach allows the non-breaching party to discharge their obligations. So if the tenant breached by hindering the sale, the owner might not have to pay because the breach prevented the proper execution of the agreement.

So the owner's argument would be that the tenant's actions (negative comments) were a material breach, so the owner isn't obligated to pay the sale proceeds.

Looking back at the options, option A says the tenant committed an uncured material breach by not cooperating and hindering the sale. That seems like the strongest argument because the tenant's actions directly affected the sale process and the price.

Other options don't seem as strong. For example, option E is about not paying rent, but the sale happened before the two missed months, so maybe it's not directly tied. Option I is about building the barn without permission, but that was addressed in the agreement about compensation, so the landlord can't now claim breach on that.
</think>

The owner's most persuasive defense is that the tenant committed an uncured material breach by hindering the sale through negative comments, which directly impacted the sale price and the owner's ability to sell the property. This breach justifies the owner's refusal to pay the agreed-upon proceeds.
