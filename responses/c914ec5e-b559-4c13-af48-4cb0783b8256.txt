Okay, so I have this question about Mr. Carson's note. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that Mr. Carson signed a note as payment for a debt on March 15. The note has a term of two months. I need to find out what the maturity date is from the options given.

Hmm, term of two months. So if the note was signed on March 15, adding two months to that date should give me the maturity date. Let me think about March, April, May, etc. 

March has 31 days, but I don't need to worry about the days beyond the month. So, March 15 plus two months would be May 15. Wait, how does that add up?

Wait, March to April is one month, so March 15 plus one month would be April 15. Then adding another month would make it May 15. So the maturity date would be May 15. Looking at the options, option B is May 15.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think is to count the months. March is the third month, so adding two months would take us to May. Like March 15 + two months is May 15. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, if someone thought of adding one month to March 15, they might get April 15, but that's just one month. The term is two months, so March 15 plus two months is May 15. So yes, option B is correct.

The correct answer is B: May 15.
