Question:

A foreign visitor was on trial for kidnapping a small child. The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?

Options:

A: Yes, the statement does not directly implicate the accused in the crime.
B: No, the statement will serve to corroborate the prosecutor's theory of the case.
C: Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.
D: Yes, the statement should be excluded because it could bias the jury.
E: Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.
F: No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.
G: Yes, the statement is hearsay and therefore inadmissible.
H: No, the statement helps establish the relationship between the accused and the child.
I: No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is a criminal trial where a foreign visitor is on trial for kidnapping a small child. The prosecutor is trying to build a case against him. They mentioned two main points: first, that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and second, that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. 

The prosecutor called a witness who testified that the defendant (the foreign visitor) told them, "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in." The defense objected to this testimony, and the question is whether the court will sustain that objection. The options are A through J, each with different reasons.

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence, specifically hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If it's hearsay, it's generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception.

In this case, the statement is being offered by the prosecutor through a witness. The statement is being used to show that the defendant knew the child and the parents had money. So, the prosecution is using it to prove that the defendant had the intent or motive to kidnap the child because of the parents' wealth.

But wait, the defense is objecting. So, the court has to decide if this statement is admissible.

Let me consider the options one by one.

Option A: Yes, the statement does not directly implicate the accused in the crime.

Hmm. But the statement does implicate the accused because it shows he was planning to visit the child and parents, which could be relevant to the kidnapping. So A might not be correct.

Option B: No, the statement will serve to corroborate the prosecutor's theory of the case.

That's possible. If the statement supports the idea that the defendant knew the child and the family's wealth, it could corroborate the theory. But I'm not sure if this is the main issue here.

Option C: Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.

Irrelevant? Well, the statement seems relevant because it shows the defendant's knowledge of the child and the family's resources, which could be motive or intent. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: Yes, the statement should be excluded because it could bias the jury.

Biasing the jury might be a concern, but I'm not sure if the statement is so prejudicial. It's about the defendant's intentions, which is relevant. So D might not be the reason.

Option E: Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.

This is about the balancing test under Rule 403. If the statement is more prejudicial than probative, it's excluded. But here, the statement seems probative because it goes to the defendant's knowledge and intent. So E might not apply.

Option F: No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.

Wait, party admissions are statements by a party opponent and are admissible. If the defendant made the statement, it's an admission against interest. But the witness is testifying about what the defendant said, so it's hearsay. Unless it's an admission, which it would be if the defendant is the declarant.

So, if the defendant is the one making the statement, then it's a party admission and admissible. So F might be correct.

Option G: Yes, the statement is hearsay and therefore inadmissible.

Well, it is hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. But if it's an admission, it's admissible. So G would be incorrect.

Option H: No, the statement helps establish the relationship between the accused and the child.

This is about relevance. The statement does show the accused knew the child and the family, which is relevant to why the child went with him. So H could be a reason, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option I: No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.

Impeachment is about credibility, but the statement is being offered to show the truth (that he knew the child and the house), not just to impeach. So I don't think this is the main issue here.

So, putting it together. The statement is hearsay, but it's an admission by a party opponent (the defendant). Therefore, it's admissible as a party admission. So the defense's objection would be overruled, meaning the court is not sustaining the objection.

Looking back at the options, F says that the statement can come in as a party admission. So the correct answer would be F: No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.

Wait, but impeachment is if the defendant testifies and contradicts himself. Here, the statement is being offered for its truth, so it's a party admission. Therefore, the statement is admissible, so the objection is overruled. So the answer would be F.

The statement in question is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which makes it hearsay. However, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement made by a party opponent (the defendant) is admissible as a party admission, regardless of whether it is against the party's interest. In this case, the defendant's statement about looking forward to visiting the child and parents, and enjoying their luxurious house, directly relates to the material facts of the caseâ€”showing the defendant's knowledge of the child and the family's wealth, which could establish motive or intent. Therefore, the statement is admissible as a party admission, and the court is unlikely to sustain the defense's objection.

Answer: F
