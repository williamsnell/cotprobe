The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called "cardinals"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which topic Martin Luther avoided speaking about in his letter. The question gives a passage from Luther's Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, and I need to determine which of the given options he didn't discuss.

First, I'll read through the passage carefully. Luther starts by addressing the Christian nobility, explaining his reasons for writing. He mentions the distress and misery in Germany and the role of the Romanists (the Catholic Church) in creating these issues. He talks about the three walls they've built around themselves, which are:

1. The Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality.
2. That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
3. That No One May Call a Council but the Pope.

He then goes on to discuss the matters for the councils and the role of the Pope, cardinals, bishops, etc. He criticizes the Pope's luxurious lifestyle and questions the role of cardinals, saying they were created to take over rich properties and thus harm the service of God.

Looking at the options, I need to see which topic isn't mentioned here. Let's go through each option one by one.

A: The wealth of the church – Luther does talk about the church's wealth, especially in the part about cardinals and how they seize convents and benefices, which are sources of wealth. So he did address this.

B: The sale of indulgences – I don't recall seeing anything about indulgences in this particular passage. Indulgences were a big deal in his 95 Theses, but maybe not in this letter. I'll keep this in mind.

C: The political nature of the church – Luther discusses the church's structure and the Pope's authority, which touches on the political aspects. So he did talk about this.

D: The role of the Pope – He definitely addresses the Pope's role, questioning it, especially in the part about the Pope's worldly lifestyle and his exclusive right to interpret scriptures.

E: The creation of cardinals – Yes, he talks about how cardinals were created to take over properties and fiefs, so he addressed this.

F: The power of the clergy – He discusses the clergy's power in various ways, like the three walls they've built, so this is covered.

G: The reformation of the Christian estate – The title of the letter mentions reforming the Christian estate, so he definitely spoke about this.

H: The worldly pomp of the head of Christendom – He directly criticizes the Pope's luxurious lifestyle, so this is included.

I: The interpretation of scriptures by the Pope – He explicitly mentions that only the Pope can interpret the scriptures, so this is addressed.

J: The corruption within the church – He refers to the Romanists protecting themselves with walls, implying corruption, and criticizes the Pope's lifestyle and the misuse of wealth, so this is covered.

The only option left is B: The sale of indulgences. In the passage, there's no mention of indulgences. The focus is more on the structure and wealth of the church, the Pope's role, and the creation of cardinals. Indulgences, while a significant issue for Luther, might not have been part of this particular letter. Therefore, the answer should be B.
</think>

The correct answer is B: The sale of indulgences. In the given passage, Martin Luther discusses various issues such as the church's wealth, the Pope's role, the creation of cardinals, and the corruption within the church, but he does not mention the sale of indulgences.

B
