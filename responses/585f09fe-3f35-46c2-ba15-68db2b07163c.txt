Okay, so I've got this question about GNP and non-productive transactions. Hmm, I remember that GNP stands for Gross National Product, which measures the total value of all goods and services produced by a country in a year. But the question is about what non-productive transactions are, and why they shouldn't be included in GNP.

The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A says transactions exclusively involving agricultural products. Wait, GNP includes all sectors, right? So agriculture is part of production. So probably not A.

Option B is exports and imports. I think GNP includes all domestically produced goods and services, regardless of whether they're exported. So exports are included, but imports are not part of GNP because they're produced abroad. But the option says both exports and imports. So maybe this isn't the right answer because GNP doesn't include imports. But I'm not sure if the question is about non-productive, which might refer to things that don't add to production.

Option C is consumer spending on durable goods. Durable goods are produced goods, so their spending would be part of consumption, which is included in GNP. So C is productive, not non-productive. So probably not C.

Option D is government spending on infrastructure. Infrastructure projects are investments in productive assets, like roads and bridges, which contribute to the economy's productive capacity. So D is productive, not non-productive.

Option E is investments in education and healthcare. These are services and can be considered part of the production because they provide value and contribute to human capital, which is productive. So E is productive, not the answer.

Option F is public and private transfer payments. Transfer payments are things like welfare, social security, or gifts. They don't represent the production of goods or services; they're just money transferred without any exchange of goods or services. So F seems like non-productive transactions because they don't contribute to production.

Option G is sales of new manufactured goods and services. These are definitely part of production, so G is productive, not the answer.

Option H is transactions involving current production. Wait, GNP is about current production, so H would be productive. So H is not the answer.

Option I is wage payments and stock market transactions. Wage payments are part of the production process as they're payments for labor. Stock market transactions are financial, not production. So I is a mix. But the option includes both, so maybe it's considered non-productive because stock market isn't production. But I'm not sure if wage payments are non-productive. Wait, no, because they're part of the cost of production. So maybe I isn't the answer.

Option J is purely financial transactions and second-hand sales. Financial transactions like buying stocks or bonds don't produce anything. Second-hand sales are reselling existing goods, which weren't produced in the current period. So J seems like non-productive because they don't involve new production.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. GNP measures the value of current production. So only transactions involving current production are included. That means things like buying and selling existing assets (financial transactions and second-hand sales) don't add to production because they're not new. So J is about non-productive.

But then F is transfer payments, which are also non-productive because they don't involve production. So both F and J could be correct. But the question is asking what non-productive transactions are, which is a category. So which option fits better?

The question says non-productive transactions should not be included. So let's see. GNP counts productive activities. So non-productive would include things like transfers, financial transactions, and second-hand sales.

Looking at the options, J says purely financial and second-hand sales. That seems to fit. F is transfer payments, which are also non-productive. So perhaps the answer includes both F and J, but looking at the options, each is separate.

Wait, the question is asking what are non-productive transactions, so which option defines it correctly. Transfer payments (F) are non-productive, and financial transactions and second-hand sales (J) are also non-productive.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is J. Because the question refers to non-productive transactions, which include these. Alternatively, maybe the answer is F, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again. GNP counts the value of goods and services produced. So it includes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. It doesn't include transfer payments because those are just redistributions of income, not production. It also doesn't include purely financial transactions like buying stocks because that's not producing anything. Second-hand sales don't count because the production happened in a previous period.

So non-productive transactions would include things like transfer payments (F), financial transactions (J), and second-hand sales (J). So J is a combination of two non-productive categories. F is another non-productive category.

But the question is asking what are non-productive transactions. So perhaps the answer is J because it combines two types that are non-productive. Alternatively, F is also correct but as a separate option. Wait, looking back at the options, F is public and private transfer payments. J is purely financial and second-hand sales.

So both F and J are non-productive. But the question is asking what are non-productive transactions. So the correct answer should be both F and J, but the options are separate. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to see what each option is.

Wait, the question says "non-productive transactions should not be included in its computation." So GNP includes productive transactions, and excludes non-productive ones. So non-productive transactions include things like transfers, financial transactions, and second-hand sales.

Looking at the options, J is the combination of purely financial transactions and second-hand sales. So J is correct because those are non-productive. F is also non-productive, but the question is about what non-productive transactions are, so J is the correct option.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of the definition. Non-productive transactions are those that do not result in the production of goods or services. So transfer payments (F) don't produce anything. Financial transactions (J) don't produce. Second-hand sales don't produce because the production was already counted when the goods were first sold.

So the answer should be J: purely financial transactions and second-hand sales.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the answer could be F. Hmm. I think I need to choose J because it's more about transactions that don't add to production, like financial and used goods.

The question asks about non-productive transactions and which ones should not be included in the computation of GNP. GNP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country, so non-productive transactions are those that do not contribute to current production.

- **Option A**: Transactions involving agricultural products are productive since agriculture is a sector of production.  
- **Option B**: Exports are included in GNP, but imports are not. However, this option refers to both and is not the best fit for non-productive transactions.  
- **Option C**: Consumer spending on durable goods is part of consumption, which is included in GNP.  
- **Option D**: Government spending on infrastructure is an investment in productive assets.  
- **Option E**: Investments in education and healthcare contribute to human capital and are productive.  
- **Option F**: Transfer payments (e.g., welfare, social security) are non-productive as they do not involve the production of goods or services.  
- **Option G**: Sales of new manufactured goods and services are productive as they represent current production.  
- **Option H**: Transactions involving current production are included in GNP, so this is not non-productive.  
- **Option I**: Wage payments are part of production costs, while stock market transactions are non-productive. This option is mixed but leans toward non-productive due to stock market transactions.  
- **Option J**: Purely financial transactions (e.g., buying stocks) and second-hand sales do not contribute to current production, making them non-productive.

Between **F** and **J**, both are non-productive, but **J** captures a broader range of non-productive transactions, including financial and second-hand sales, which align more directly with the definition of non-productive transactions in the context of GNP.

Answer: J
