Okay, so I need to figure out what the name of Raggedy Ann's doll brother is. I'm a bit rusty on my Raggedy Ann knowledge, but I'll try to remember what I know. 

First, I know Raggedy Ann is a character from a series of books, right? She's a rag doll, and I think she has a brother. The question is asking for his name. The options given are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me think about the stories. I remember that Raggedy Ann and her brother are both dolls, and their names might be similar. I think the brother's name starts with "Raggedy" as well, just like Ann. So looking at the options, A is Raggedy Sam, D is Raggedy Bob, E is Raggedy Ed, F is Raggedy Ken, H is Raggedy Jim, and I is Raggedy Tom. So these are the options that have "Raggedy" in them.

Now, which one is correct? I think the brother's name is something like Raggedy Andy, but looking at the options, G is Andy, but it's just Andy without Raggedy. So that's probably not it. Wait, maybe it's Raggedy Andy, but that's not one of the options. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up with another character. Alternatively, I've heard the term "Raggedy Man" before, but that's more of a nickname or a term, not a specific name. So maybe it's not that.

Looking back at the options, the ones with Raggedy are A, D, E, F, H, I. Let me try to recall. I think the brother's name is Raggedy Andy, but that's not an option. Wait, maybe it's Raggedy Sam? Or Raggedy Tom? Hmm.

Wait, I think I've heard the name Raggedy Andy before, but since that's not an option, perhaps it's another name. Let me think about the books. The original Raggedy Ann stories were written by Johnny Gruelle, and I believe the brother is named Raggedy Andy. But in the options, G is Andy, but without Raggedy. So maybe that's a trick option.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is Raggedy Sam, which is option A. Or perhaps it's Raggedy Tom, option I. I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to visualize the characters. Raggedy Ann is a girl doll, and her brother is a boy doll. I think his name is Raggedy Andy, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is different.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. I think the brother is actually named Raggedy Sam. I remember seeing that in some pictures or stories. So option A, Raggedy Sam, might be correct. Alternatively, maybe it's Raggedy Tom, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct answer is Raggedy Sam. So I'll go with option A.
