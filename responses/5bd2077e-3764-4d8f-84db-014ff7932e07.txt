Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about kinetic energy. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that air is a mixture of gas molecules moving around, and I need to compute the kinetic energy K of a molecule moving at 500 m/s. The mass given is 4.6 × 10^-26 kg. 

Wait, I remember that kinetic energy is calculated using the formula K = (1/2)mv², right? So m is mass and v is velocity. Let me write that down: K equals one half times mass times velocity squared.

So plugging in the numbers, the mass is 4.6e-26 kg, and velocity is 500 m/s. Let me compute v squared first. 500 squared is 250,000. Oh wait, 500 times 500 is 250,000. But I should write that in scientific notation maybe. 250,000 is 2.5 × 10^5.

Now, multiply that by the mass. So 4.6e-26 kg multiplied by 2.5e5. Let me do that calculation. 4.6 times 2.5 is 11.5, and then the exponents: 10^-26 times 10^5 is 10^(-26+5) which is 10^-21. So 11.5 × 10^-21. But wait, I haven't included the 1/2 yet. Oh right, because the formula is (1/2)mv², so I need to divide that by 2.

So 11.5 divided by 2 is 5.75. So putting it all together, 5.75 × 10^-21 J. Okay, now looking at the options, let me see which one matches. Option I is 5.75 × 10^-21 J. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Mass is 4.6e-26, velocity 500. v squared is 250,000. Multiply 4.6e-26 by 250,000, which is 4.6e-26 * 2.5e5 = (4.6 *2.5) *1e-21. 4.6 *2.5 is 11.5, so 11.5e-21. Then times 1/2, so 5.75e-21. Yep, that looks right. So the answer should be option I.
</think>

The kinetic energy \( K \) is calculated using the formula \( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m = 4.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \) and \( v = 500 \, \text{m/s} \). 

1. Compute \( v^2 \):  
   \( 500^2 = 250,000 = 2.5 \times 10^5 \).

2. Multiply by \( m \):  
   \( 4.6 \times 10^{-26} \times 2.5 \times 10^5 = 11.5 \times 10^{-21} \).

3. Multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):  
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 11.5 \times 10^{-21} = 5.75 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J} \).

The correct answer is **I**.
