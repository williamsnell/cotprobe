Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the fractional void volume for three different ionic crystals: CsCl, NaCl, and LiCl. I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the fractional void volume is the space between the ions in the crystal structure. It's calculated by finding the volume occupied by ions and subtracting that from the total volume of the unit cell, then dividing by the unit cell volume. The formula I think is something like (1 - (ionic volume fraction)).

Wait, no, I think the formula is (void volume) = 1 - (sum of ion volumes in unit cell)/(volume of unit cell). But wait, actually, it's more about the packing efficiency. Alternatively, the void volume fraction is the percentage of empty space in the unit cell, so it's (total volume - ion volume) / total volume.

But let me get the structures right. The question states that in CsCl, both positive and negative ions form a simple cubic lattice. Each ion has eight nearest neighbors of opposite charge. So CsCl has a structure where each Cs+ is surrounded by Cl- ions and vice versa, but each forms a simple cubic lattice. That means the unit cell is a cube with Cs+ and Cl- at the corners and possibly in the center? Wait, no, in CsCl, each ion is at a corner, and the unit cell is body-centered, but wait, in a simple cubic, each corner is an atom. Wait, no, CsCl has a body-centered cubic structure. Wait, the question says that in CsCl, the positive and negative ions each form a simple cubic lattice. Oh, so the structure is such that each ion type is at the corners of a cube, and the opposite ions are at the body center? Or perhaps the Cs+ and Cl- form separate simple cubic lattices interpenetrating each other. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states: "In CsCl the positive ions and the negative ions each comprise a simple cubic lattice. Each ion has eight oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors." So each ion is part of a simple cubic lattice, meaning each has six nearest neighbors in the same lattice, but since they're oppositely charged, the nearest neighbors are from the other lattice. Wait, no, that's confusing. Alternatively, in a simple cubic structure, each ion has six nearest neighbors, but in CsCl, each ion has eight oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors. So perhaps CsCl has a structure where each ion is at the corners of a cube, and the oppositely charged ions are at the edge centers? Wait, no, that's more like a different structure.

Alternatively, the CsCl structure is a body-centered cubic (BCC) for each ion type. So each Cs+ is at the corners and one in the center, but wait, no, because in CsCl, each ion is surrounded by six of the opposite charge in a octahedral arrangement. No, wait, the problem says eight nearest neighbors. So CsCl has a structure where each ion has eight nearest opposites, which would be a cubic close-packed structure, but I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the structure types given. The question says:

- CsCl: each ion type (Cs+ and Cl-) forms a simple cubic lattice. Each ion has eight oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, each ion has six nearest neighbors (along the axes). How can each ion have eight nearest opposites? Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that the Cs+ ions form a simple cubic lattice, and the Cl- ions also form a simple cubic lattice, but they're interpenetrating. So each Cs+ is at the corner, and each Cl- is at the center of each cube. Wait, but that would make each Cl- have eight Cs+ neighbors, but each Cs+ would have eight Cl- neighbors? No, wait, each Cs+ would be at a corner, surrounded by Cl- in the centers of adjacent cubes. So each Cs+ would have eight Cl- neighbors (one from each adjacent cube's center). Similarly, each Cl- would be at the center of a cube and surrounded by eight Cs+ from the cube's corners. So the structure is body-centered and each has eight neighbors.

Wait, but that's more like a BCC structure. So for CsCl, the structure is a BCC lattice where each ion is surrounded by eight of the opposite charge. So each unit cell would have two Cs+ (corners) and one Cl- (center), but wait, no, because in BCC, each corner is one atom and the center is another. So for CsCl, perhaps each unit cell has one Cs+ and one Cl-? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe each unit cell is CsCl, so two ions total.

Wait, no, perhaps the unit cell in CsCl is a cube with Cs+ at the corners and Cl- at the center, or vice versa. So each Cs+ at a corner is surrounded by eight Cl- at the centers of the adjacent cubes. But that would mean each Cl- is at the center of a cube, surrounded by eight Cs+.

So the unit cell would have eight Cs+ (each corner) and one Cl- (center), but that would give a formula of Cs8Cl, which isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps each cube has Cs+ at the corners and Cl- at the face centers, but that's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on to the next part.

The problem states that for each structure, we can model the ions as hard spheres in contact. So we can calculate the packing efficiency, which relates to the void volume.

For each part (a), (b), (c), we need to calculate the fractional void volume for CsCl, NaCl, and LiCl.

The fractional void volume is calculated as:

Void volume fraction = 1 - (sum of ion volumes)/(unit cell volume)

But another approach is to calculate the packing efficiency, which is the same as 1 - void volume fraction. Wait, no, packing efficiency is the fraction of the unit cell volume occupied by ions. So the void volume fraction would be 1 minus packing efficiency.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Determine the structure type for each compound.
2. For each structure, determine the number of each ion in the unit cell.
3. Calculate the volume occupied by ions in the unit cell.
4. Calculate the unit cell volume.
5. Subtract the ion volume from the unit cell volume to get the void volume.
6. Divide the void volume by the unit cell volume to get the fractional void volume.

Let's tackle each compound one by one.

(a) CsCl: Structure is simple cubic for each ion, with each ion having eight oppositely charged neighbors.

Wait, earlier I thought it's a BCC structure. But the question says each ion type forms a simple cubic lattice. So perhaps the structure is a simple cubic lattice for Cs+ and Cl- separately, interpenetrating each other. So the unit cell would have 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl- per unit cell, but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, each unit cell would have 2 Cs+ and 2 Cl-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that in the simple cubic arrangement, each unit cell has one Cs+ and one Cl-. But that can't be right because in a simple cubic lattice, each corner is shared among eight unit cells, so each unit cell would have 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl- (if each is at a corner). But that would imply a formula of CsCl, which matches.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, each corner is shared among eight unit cells, so each corner contributes 1/8 to each unit cell. So if each unit cell has Cs+ at each corner, that would contribute 8*(1/8) = 1 Cs+ per unit cell. Similarly, if Cl- is also at each corner, that would be another 1 Cl- per unit cell. But that would make the formula CsCl, which is correct. So the unit cell has 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-.

Wait, but that can’t be correct because each ion would only have six nearest neighbors in the same lattice, but the problem states each has eight nearest opposites. So perhaps the structure is a body-centered cubic. So in a BCC structure, each Cs+ is at a corner and one in the center as Cl-, but that would make each Cs+ surrounded by eight Cl- (the center of each adjacent cube).

Wait, perhaps I should move on to the calculation, using the given data. The ions are hard spheres in contact, so the edge length of the unit cell can be determined from the sum of the ionic radii.

For CsCl:

Cs+ has radius 1.69 Å, Cl- has 1.81 Å. Since the structure is such that each ion is in contact with the opposite ion, the edge length a is equal to 2*(r_Cs+ + r_Cl-).

So a = 2*(1.69 + 1.81) = 2*(3.5) = 7.0 Å.

Wait, but wait, in a simple cubic structure, the ions are at the corners, so the edge length would be determined by the distance between adjacent ions. But in CsCl's structure, which I'm a bit confused about, perhaps the edge length is determined by the contact between nearest ions.

So, the edge length a = 2*(r_Cs+ + r_Cl-).

So a = 2*(1.69 + 1.81) = 2*(3.5) = 7.0 Å.

Then, the volume of the unit cell is a^3 = 7.0^3 = 343 Å³.

Now, number of Cs+ and Cl- ions per unit cell: since it's a BCC structure, each unit cell has 2 Cs+ (corners) and 2 Cl- (one at the center and perhaps others?), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps in CsCl, each unit cell has 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in a BCC structure, each corner is shared among eight unit cells, so each corner contributes 1/8 per cell. So for Cs+ at each corner, 8*(1/8) = 1 Cs+ per cell. Similarly, the center ion is entirely within the cell, so 1 Cl- per cell. So the formula would be CsCl, which matches.

Wait, but then the number of ions per unit cell would be 2: 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-. So the total volume occupied by ions is (volume of Cs+ + volume of Cl-).

Each ion is a sphere, so volume is (4/3)πr³.

So volume of Cs+ = (4/3)π*(1.69)^3
Similarly, Cl- = (4/3)π*(1.81)^3.

But wait, in a unit cell, there's 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-, so total ion volume is (4/3)π*(1.69³ + 1.81³).

Wait, but perhaps each contributes (4/3)πr³, and since there are two ions, total ion volume is 2*(4/3)πr_avg³? No, each has their own radius.

So let's compute:

r_Cs+ = 1.69 Å
r_Cl- = 1.81 Å

Volume of Cs+ = (4/3)π*(1.69)^3
Volume of Cl- = (4/3)π*(1.81)^3

Total ion volume = (4/3)π*(1.69³ + 1.81³) 

Now, compute 1.69³: approx 1.69 *1.69=2.8561, 2.8561 *1.69 ≈4.825 Å³
1.81³: 1.81*1.81=3.2761, 3.2761*1.81≈5.935 Å³

So total ion volume ≈ (4/3)π*(4.825 +5.935) = (4/3)π*(10.76) ≈4.1888 * 10.76 ≈45.07 Å³

Unit cell volume is 7.0³=343 Å³.

So packing efficiency = total ion volume / unit cell volume = 45.07 / 343 ≈ 0.1314, so void volume fraction is 1 - 0.1314 ≈0.8686, which doesn't make sense because that's a very high void fraction, but I think I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in CsCl, each ion is at the corner and the center, making it a BCC structure with two ions per unit cell: one Cs+ at the corners (8*(1/8)=1) and one Cl- at the center, so the unit cell has 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-? But then that would make the formula CsCl, which is correct, but the structure would have two ions per unit cell.

Wait, no, in a BCC structure, the unit cell has 2 atoms: one at each corner (8*(1/8)=1) and one in the center. So for CsCl, perhaps the Cs+ ions are at the corners and the Cl- at the center. So each Cs+ has eight Cl- neighbors (from the centers of adjacent cubes), and each Cl- has eight Cs+ neighbors.

So the unit cell would have 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-, so two ions in total.

So the volume occupied by ions is (4/3)π*(1.69³ +1.81³) ≈45.07 Å³ as before.

Unit cell volume a^3=7.0^3=343.

So packing efficiency = 45.07 / 343 ≈0.131, so void fraction is 0.869, which seems too high. But that can't be right because hard spheres can't have such a low packing efficiency. Maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't BCC but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the edge length isn't 7.0 Å. Let me double-check the calculation for a.

In CsCl, the structure is such that each ion touches the opposite ion. So the edge length a is equal to 2*(r_Cs+ + r_Cl-).

Wait, no, perhaps in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the cube diagonal? No, in simple cubic, nearest neighbors are along the edge. So if Cs+ and Cl- are at the corners, then the edge length a would be equal to 2*(r_Cs+ + r_Cl-). Because each corner has an ion, and the edge length is the distance between adjacent corners, which are ions of opposite charge.

So a = 2*(1.69 + 1.81) = 2*3.5 =7.0 Å. That part seems correct.

But then the unit cell volume is 343 Å³.

So with two ions (1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-), their combined volume is about 45.07 Å³, as calculated.

So packing efficiency is 45.07/343 ≈ 0.131, which is about 13.1%. That's very low, which doesn't make sense for a structure where each ion has eight neighbors; perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps in CsCl, each ion is part of a simple cubic lattice, but the unit cell is larger. Or perhaps I should consider that each ion has eight neighbors, meaning it's a different structure, like a face-centered cubic (FCC), but the question says CsCl uses a simple cubic lattice for each ion type.

Alternatively, perhaps each ion type forms a separate simple cubic lattice, interpenetrating each other. So each unit cell would have 2 Cs+ and 2 Cl-, because each simple cubic lattice has one ion per corner, and in the interpenetrating structure, each unit cell would have two of each. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, if each lattice is simple cubic, then each unit cell has one Cs+ and one Cl-, so the formula is CsCl. But if each is simple cubic, perhaps the unit cell has two Cs+ and two Cl-? No, that would give Cs2Cl2, which isn't correct. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit cell for CsCl is larger, like 2x2x2, but that complicates things. Let me think differently.

Perhaps I should use the general formula for packing efficiency based on the structure.

In a simple cubic structure, the packing efficiency is (π/6) ≈ 0.5236, but that's for a single lattice. But in CsCl, each ion has eight neighbors, so it's a different packing.

Wait, no. The problem specifies that in CsCl, each ion has eight oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors, meaning it's an octahedral arrangement. So perhaps the structure is such that each ion is at the center of a cube, with the opposite ions at the corners. That would make each ion have eight neighbors, but that's more like a body-centered structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cubic close-packed (CCP) or face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, but the question says it's simple cubic.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the given data and see where it leads.

So, for CsCl:

a = 2*(1.69 +1.81) =7.0 Å.

Unit cell volume = 7^3 =343 Å³.

Number of Cs+ and Cl- per unit cell: if it's a simple cubic structure where each ion is at the corner, then each unit cell has 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-, totaling 2 ions.

So total ion volume = 2*(4/3 π r^3), but wait no, because each ion has its own radius. So it's (4/3 π (1.69)^3) + (4/3 π (1.81)^3).

Which is (4/3 π) (1.69³ +1.81³) ≈ (4.1888) * (4.825 +5.935) ≈4.1888 *10.76 ≈45.07 Å³.

So packing efficiency = 45.07 /343 ≈0.131, so void fraction is 0.869.

But looking at the options, none of them have a void fraction that high. The highest I see is option A: 0.29 for CsCl. So clearly I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I've messed up the structure. Let me think again. Maybe CsCl has a different structure where the unit cell is larger, or perhaps the number of ions per unit cell is different.

Wait, another approach: in CsCl, the structure is a BCC where each ion is surrounded by six opposite ions, but the question says eight. Wait, perhaps I should refer to the given information in the problem.

The problem states: "In CsCl the positive ions and the negative ions each comprise a simple cubic lattice. Each ion has eight oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors."

So each ion has eight nearest opposites. In a simple cubic lattice, each ion has six nearest neighbors in the same lattice, but in CsCl, each ion's nearest neighbors are from the opposite lattice. So perhaps the structure is such that each ion is at a corner and the centers of the adjacent cubes are the opposites.

Wait, perhaps each ion is at a corner, and the opposites are at the centers of the adjacent cubes, so each corner ion has eight opposites around it. That would make the edge length a = 2*r_positive + 2*r_negative? No, because the distance from a corner to the center is a√3/2.

Wait, the nearest neighbor distance in a BCC structure is the distance from a corner to the center, which is a√3/2. So in CsCl, the nearest neighbor distance is a√3/2 = 2*(r_Cs+ + r_Cl-).

Wait, no, because the ions are in contact. So the distance between a Cs+ at a corner and a Cl- at the center is a√3/2, which should equal r_Cs+ + r_Cl-.

So a√3/2 = r_Cs+ + r_Cl-.

So a = 2*(r_Cs+ + r_Cl-)/√3.

Plugging in the numbers:

r_Cs+ =1.69, r_Cl- =1.81.

Sum =3.5. So a = 2*3.5 /√3 ≈7 /1.732 ≈4.0412 Å.

Then, unit cell volume a^3 ≈4.0412^3 ≈66.15 Å³.

Number of ions per unit cell: 2 Cs+ (each corner contributes 1/8, 8 corners =1 Cs+) and 2 Cl- (each center contributes 1, but wait, in BCC, each unit cell has one atom in the center. So perhaps 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl- per unit cell, making the formula CsCl.

Wait, but that would mean each Cs+ is at the corner, and each Cl- is at the center, so each Cs+ has eight Cl- neighbors (from adjacent unit cells' centers). Similarly, each Cl- has eight Cs+ neighbors.

So the number of ions per unit cell is 1 Cs+ and 1 Cl-, so two ions total.

Now, the volume of each ion:

Cs+ volume = (4/3)π*(1.69)^3 ≈4.1888 *4.825 ≈20.27 Å³

Cl- volume = (4/3)π*(1.81)^3 ≈4.1888 *5.935 ≈24.83 Å³

Total ion volume =20.27 +24.83 ≈45.10 Å³.

Unit cell volume ≈66.15 Å³.

Packing efficiency =45.10 /66.15 ≈0.6818.

So void volume fraction =1 -0.6818 ≈0.3182, which is approximately 0.318.

Looking at the options, option I has 0.316 for CsCl, which is very close. Option C has 0.32, which is also close. Option D has 0.33, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should do more precise calculations.

Let me recalculate a:

a = 2*(1.69 +1.81)/(√3) = (7)/(1.7320508075688772) ≈4.041239 Å.

a^3 = (4.041239)^3 = let's compute:

4^3=64. 0.041239^3 is negligible. But more accurately:

4.041239 *4.041239 = approx 16.332 (since 4^2=16, 4*0.041239=0.164956, so cross terms: 2*(4*0.041239) + (0.041239)^2 ≈0.329912 +0.001702=0.3316, so 16 +0.3316=16.3316.

Then multiply by 4.041239 again:

16.3316 *4.041239.

Let me compute 16 *4=64, 16*0.041239≈0.6598, 0.3316*4≈1.3264, 0.3316*0.041239≈0.01369.

Adding up: 64 +0.6598 +1.3264 +0.01369≈65.9999, which is approximately 66 Å³.

So unit cell volume ≈66 Å³.

Total ion volume: (4/3)π*(1.69³ +1.81³).

Compute 1.69³: 1.69 *1.69=2.8561, 2.8561 *1.69 ≈4.825.

1.81³: 1.81*1.81=3.2761, 3.2761 *1.81≈5.935.

Sum:4.825 +5.935=10.76.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 10.76 *4.1888≈45.07 Å³.

So packing efficiency=45.07/66≈0.6828.

Void fraction=1-0.6828=0.3172, which is approximately 0.317, which matches option I (0.316) and option C (0.32). Option I is 0.316, which is very close.

So for CsCl, the void fraction is approximately 0.316 or 0.32.

Now moving on to (b) NaCl.

The problem states that NaCl has a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice for each ion type, with each ion having six oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors.

In an FCC structure, each ion has twelve nearest neighbors in the same lattice, but in NaCl, each ion is surrounded by six of the opposite charge. So the structure is an FCC arrangement where each ion is surrounded by six opposites.

In NaCl, the structure is a face-centered cubic lattice for both Na+ and Cl-, with each ion surrounded by six of the opposite charge. So the unit cell is an FCC, and the formula is NaCl, meaning that each unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-.

Wait, no. In NaCl structure, each unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-, totaling eight ions. The structure is such that each ion is at the face centers and corners, but interleaved with the opposite ions. So the unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-.

Wait, the NaCl structure is a face-centered cubic lattice where each ion is surrounded by six of the opposite charge. The unit cell is FCC, with a formula of NaCl, so four Na+ and four Cl- per unit cell.

The edge length a is determined by the contact between nearest ions. In NaCl, the nearest ions are along the face diagonal. Wait, no, in the NaCl structure, the nearest ions are along the edge of the cube, because the Na+ and Cl- are at the corners and face centers, respectively, or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the NaCl structure as each ion being at the corners and face centers of the cube, but alternately occupied by Na+ and Cl-. So the edge length a is determined by the sum of the ionic radii, as the nearest neighbors are along the cube edge.

So the distance between Na+ and Cl- along the edge is a, and this equals the sum of their radii.

So a = r_Na+ + r_Cl-.

Given Na+ radius is 0.95 Å, Cl- is 1.81 Å.

So a =0.95 +1.81 =2.76 Å.

Wait, but that can't be right because that's a very small edge length. Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonal, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the NaCl structure, each Na+ is at a face center and each Cl- is at a corner, or vice versa. The nearest neighbors are along the edge, so the distance between adjacent ions (Na+ and Cl-) is a, which equals the sum of their radii.

So a = r_Na+ + r_Cl- =0.95 +1.81=2.76 Å.

Unit cell volume = a^3 = (2.76)^3 ≈20.79 Å³.

Number of Na+ and Cl- per unit cell: in NaCl, each unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-.

So total ion count is eight.

Each Na+ volume = (4/3)π*(0.95)^3 ≈4.1888*(0.8574) ≈3.585 Å³.

Each Cl- volume = (4/3)π*(1.81)^3 ≈4.1888*(5.935) ≈24.83 Å³.

Total ion volume per unit cell =4*(3.585) +4*(24.83) =14.34 +99.32≈113.66 Å³.

Wait, but the unit cell volume is 20.79 Å³, which can't be correct because the ion volume exceeds the unit cell volume. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think again: in NaCl, the unit cell is face-centered cubic, and each ion has six nearest opposites. So the structure is such that the edge length a is determined by the contact between nearest ions, which are along the edge.

But wait, the Na+ and Cl- are at the corners and face centers, so the distance between a Na+ at a corner and a Cl- at a face center along the edge is a/2√2, because the face diagonal is a√2, and the distance from corner to face center is half the face diagonal, which is a√2/2 =a/√2.

Wait, no, the face diagonal is a√2, so the distance from a corner to the center of a face is (a√2)/2 =a/√2.

So the nearest neighbor distance is a/√2, which equals r_Na+ + r_Cl-.

So a/√2 =0.95 +1.81=2.76.

Thus, a=2.76 *√2 ≈2.76 *1.4142≈3.906 Å.

Unit cell volume =a^3= (3.906)^3≈59.35 Å³.

Number of ions per unit cell: NaCl has four Na+ and four Cl- per unit cell.

So total ion volume =4*(4/3 π*(0.95)^3) +4*(4/3 π*(1.81)^3).

Compute each:

Na+ volume per ion: (4/3)π*(0.95)^3 ≈4.1888*(0.8574)≈3.585 Å³.

Cl- volume per ion: (4/3)π*(1.81)^3≈4.1888*(5.935)≈24.83 Å³.

Total ion volume:4*3.585 +4*24.83 ≈14.34 +99.32≈113.66 Å³.

But unit cell volume is 59.35 Å³, which is impossible because ion volume can't exceed the unit cell volume. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the a calculation. Let me recalculate.

The nearest neighbor distance in NaCl is along the edge: the Na+ is at a corner and the Cl- is at a face center. So the distance between them is along the edge, but wait, no, the face center is at the center of the face, which is a distance of a/2 along each axis from the corner.

Wait, no, the distance from a corner (0,0,0) to the center of a face (a/2, a/2, 0) is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 +0 )=a√2/2 =a/√2.

So the nearest neighbor distance is a/√2, which equals r_Na+ + r_Cl-.

So a/√2= 0.95 +1.81=2.76 → a=2.76 *√2≈3.906 Å.

So a^3≈3.906^3≈59.35 Å³.

Now, number of ions per unit cell: NaCl has four Na+ and four Cl-.

Each Na+ is at the corner and face centers of one set, but perhaps in the unit cell, each corner is shared by eight cells, and each face center is shared by two cells.

Wait, in the NaCl structure, each Na+ is at a face center, and each Cl- is at a corner, or vice versa. So each unit cell has four Na+ (each face center contributes 1/2 per face, and there are six faces, but wait, no: each face center is shared between two unit cells, so each face center contributes 1/2 to the unit cell. So number of Na+ per unit cell: each face has one Na+ at the center, which is shared between two unit cells, so per unit cell, 6 faces *1/2 =3 Na+. Plus, each corner has a Cl-; each corner is shared by eight unit cells, so eight corners contribute 8*(1/8)=1 Cl-. So total ions would be 3 Na+ and 1 Cl-, which can't be right because the formula is NaCl.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the positions. Let me clarify: in the NaCl structure, each Na+ is at a face center and each Cl- is at a corner. So each face center (there are six faces) contributes 1/2 Na+ per unit cell. So 6*(1/2)=3 Na+.

Each corner (eight corners) contributes 1/8 Cl- per unit cell. So 8*(1/8)=1 Cl-.

So the unit cell has 3 Na+ and 1 Cl-, which would give a formula of Na3Cl, which isn't correct. So I must have the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps Na+ is at the corner and Cl- at the face centers.

So each corner contributes 1/8 Na+ per unit cell. 8 corners → 1 Na+.

Each face center contributes 1/2 Cl- per unit cell. 6 faces →3 Cl-.

So the unit cell would have 1 Na+ and 3 Cl-, formula NaCl3, which is also incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the conventional unit cell of NaCl, which has four Na+ and four Cl-.

In the conventional FCC unit cell, each Na+ is at a face center and each Cl- is at a corner, but that gives 3 Na+ and 1 Cl-, which isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps in the NaCl structure, the unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl- arranged in a face-centered cubic manner. So each Na+ is at a face center, and each Cl- is at a corner, but with a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-, each at alternating positions. So perhaps each face center has a Na+ and a Cl- in an alternating fashion, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the conventional unit cell of NaCl. From what I remember, the NaCl structure has four Na+ and four Cl- per unit cell. The Na+ are at the face centers, and the Cl- are at the corners, but that gives 3 Na+ and 1 Cl- as before, which is incorrect. So perhaps the structure is such that each ion is at both corners and face centers, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-, each at alternating corners and face centers. So perhaps each unit cell has 4 Na+ and 4 Cl-, making the formula NaCl.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the given data, assuming that the unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-.

So, moving forward:

Total ion volume =4*(4/3 π*(0.95)^3) +4*(4/3 π*(1.81)^3).

=4*(4.1888*(0.8574)) +4*(4.1888*(5.935)).

=4*(3.585) +4*(24.83) =14.34 +99.32=113.66 Å³.

Unit cell volume= a^3= (3.906)^3≈59.35 Å³.

But 113.66>59.35, which is impossible. So clearly, I'm making a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance isn't along the edge but along the face diagonal. Let me try that.

If nearest neighbors are along the face diagonal, then the distance would be a√2/2 =r_Na+ + r_Cl-.

So a√2/2 =0.95 +1.81=2.76 →a= (2.76 *2)/√2=5.52/1.4142≈3.906 Å.

Which is the same as before, so the unit cell volume remains the same.

But the calculation still leads to a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the nearest neighbors are along the cube diagonal. That would make the distance a√3/2 =r_Na+ +r_Cl-.

So a√3/2=2.76 →a= (2.76*2)/√3≈5.52/1.732≈3.186 Å.

Unit cell volume=3.186^3≈32.36 Å³.

Number of ions: four Na+ and four Cl-.

Total ion volume=4*(4/3 π*(0.95)^3) +4*(4/3 π*(1.81)^3) =4*(3.585) +4*(24.83)=14.34 +99.32=113.66 Å³.

Again, unit cell volume is 32.36, which is less than ion volume. So this can't be right.

I think I'm stuck on the structure. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's calculate the packing efficiency for NaCl.

In the NaCl structure, each ion has six nearest neighbors, so the coordination number is 6. The structure is a face-centered cubic arrangement, and each ion is surrounded by six of the opposite charge.

The edge length a can be determined from the contact between ions.

In NaCl, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, so a = r_Na+ + r_Cl- =0.95 +1.81=2.76 Å.

Unit cell volume=2.76^3≈20.79 Å³.

Number of ions per unit cell: four Na+ and four Cl-.

Total ion volume=4*(4/3 π*(0.95)^3) +4*(4/3 π*(1.81)^3)=4*(3.585) +4*(24.83)=14.34 +99.32=113.66 Å³.

But 113.66>20.79, which is impossible. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of ions per unit cell. Let me think again.

In the NaCl structure, each Na+ is at a face center, and each Cl- is at a corner. The conventional unit cell has four Na+ and four Cl-.

Wait, no. Each face center is shared between two unit cells, so each face has one Na+ contributing 1/2 to the unit cell. There are six faces, so 6*(1/2)=3 Na+.

Each corner is shared between eight unit cells, so eight corners contribute 8*(1/8)=1 Cl-.

So the unit cell would have 3 Na+ and 1 Cl-, which can't be right because the formula is NaCl.

This suggests that my understanding of the structure is incorrect. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps in the NaCl structure, each ion is at a corner and a face center, but I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck and need to proceed differently.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look at the options and see which ones make sense.

Looking at the options, for NaCl, the void fractions are in the range of 0.27 to 0.34.

If I accept that for CsCl, the void fraction is around 0.316, which matches option I and C.

Now, for (c) LiCl, the structure is similar to NaCl: each ion type forms a face-centered cubic lattice, each ion has six opposites as nearest neighbors.

So Li+ has a radius of 0.60 Å, and Cl- is 1.81 Å.

The edge length a is determined by the contact between Li+ and Cl-.

Assuming nearest neighbors are along the edge, a = r_Li+ + r_Cl- =0.60 +1.81=2.41 Å.

Unit cell volume=2.41^3≈14.03 Å³.

Number of ions per unit cell: four Li+ and four Cl-.

Total ion volume=4*(4/3 π*(0.60)^3) +4*(4/3 π*(1.81)^3).

=4*(4.1888*0.216) +4*(4.1888*5.935).

=4*(0.900) +4*(24.83).

=3.6 +99.32≈102.92 Å³.

Unit cell volume=14.03, which is less than ion volume. So again, impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along the face diagonal.

So a√2/2 =r_Li+ +r_Cl- =2.41.

Thus, a= (2.41 *2)/√2≈4.82 /1.4142≈3.408 Å.

Unit cell volume=3.408^3≈39.47 Å³.

Number of ions: four Li+ and four Cl-.

Total ion volume=4*(4/3 π*(0.60)^3) +4*(4/3 π*(1.81)^3)=4*(0.900) +4*(24.83)=3.6 +99.32≈102.92 Å³.

Still, 102.92>39.47, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along the cube diagonal.

a√3/2 =2.41 →a= (2.41 *2)/√3≈4.82 /1.732≈2.783 Å.

Unit cell volume=2.783^3≈21.43 Å³.

Ion volume=102.92>21.43. Still impossible.

I'm clearly making a mistake in the structure. Perhaps I should accept that I can't correctly determine the structure for NaCl and LiCl and instead look at the options to see which one aligns with the CsCl value I calculated earlier (around 0.316).

Looking at the options:

Option I: 0.316 for CsCl, 0.32 for NaCl, 0.23 for LiCl.

Option C: 0.32 for CsCl, 0.31 for NaCl, 0.22 for LiCl.

Option D: 0.33 for CsCl, 0.29 for NaCl, 0.27 for LiCl.

Option A: 0.29 for CsCl, 0.35 for NaCl, 0.21 for LiCl.

Option E: 0.35 for CsCl, 0.30 for NaCl, 0.25 for LiCl.

Option F: 0.27 for CsCl, 0.33 for NaCl, 0.22 for LiCl.

Option G: 0.30 for CsCl, 0.33 for NaCl, 0.20 for LiCl.

Option H: 0.28 for CsCl, 0.34 for NaCl, 0.24 for LiCl.

Option J: 0.31 for CsCl, 0.27 for NaCl, 0.25 for LiCl.

From earlier, I calculated CsCl's void fraction as approximately 0.316, which matches option I's 0.316 for CsCl.

Looking at option I, NaCl is 0.32 and LiCl is 0.23.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I.
</think>

To determine the fractional void volume for CsCl, NaCl, and LiCl, we analyze their crystal structures and calculate the void fraction based on ionic radii and lattice parameters.

### (a) CsCl
- **Structure**: CsCl forms a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice where each Cs⁺ ion is surrounded by eight Cl⁻ ions and vice versa.
- **Ionic Radii**: Cs⁺ = 1.69 Å, Cl⁻ = 1.81 Å.
- **Edge Length**: The nearest neighbor distance is the body diagonal of the cube divided by √3, giving \( a = \frac{2(r_{Cs^+} + r_{Cl^-})}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2(1.69 + 1.81)}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 4.04 \, \text{Å} \).
- **Unit Cell Volume**: \( a^3 \approx 66.15 \, \text{Å}^3 \).
- **Ion Volumes**: Total ion volume = \( \frac{4}{3}\pi (1.69^3 + 1.81^3) \approx 45.07 \, \text{Å}^3 \).
- **Packing Efficiency**: \( \frac{45.07}{66.15} \approx 0.6828 \).
- **Void Fraction**: \( 1 - 0.6828 \approx 0.317 \), which matches option I's value of 0.316.

### (b) NaCl
- **Structure**: NaCl forms a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice with each Na⁺ ion surrounded by six Cl⁻ ions and vice versa.
- **Ionic Radii**: Na⁺ = 0.95 Å, Cl⁻ = 1.81 Å.
- **Edge Length**: The nearest neighbor distance is along the edge of the cube, giving \( a = r_{Na^+} + r_{Cl^-} = 0.95 + 1.81 = 2.76 \, \text{Å} \).
- **Unit Cell Volume**: \( a^3 \approx 20.79 \, \text{Å}^3 \).
- **Ion Volumes**: Total ion volume = \( 4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi (0.95^3 + 1.81^3) \approx 113.66 \, \text{Å}^3 \), which exceeds the unit cell volume, indicating a miscalculation in the structure or assumptions.

### (c) LiCl
- **Structure**: LiCl forms an FCC lattice with each Li⁺ ion surrounded by six Cl⁻ ions and vice versa.
- **Ionic Radii**: Li⁺ = 0.60 Å, Cl⁻ = 1.81 Å.
- **Edge Length**: The nearest neighbor distance is along the edge of the cube, giving \( a = r_{Li^+} + r_{Cl^-} = 0.60 + 1.81 = 2.41 \, \text{Å} \).
- **Unit Cell Volume**: \( a^3 \approx 14.03 \, \text{Å}^3 \).
- **Ion Volumes**: Total ion volume = \( 4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi (0.60^3 + 1.81^3) \approx 102.92 \, \text{Å}^3 \), which again exceeds the unit cell volume, suggesting structural inconsistencies.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations for CsCl, the closest match to the computed void fraction is **option I**, which provides 0.316 for CsCl, 0.32 for NaCl, and 0.23 for LiCl.

**Answer: I**
