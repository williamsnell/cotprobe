Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the value of J, which I think relates to the mechanical equivalent of heat, often denoted as J, which is the amount of work done per calorie of heat. So, the goal is to calculate J using the given data.

First, I need to understand the setup. The experiment measures the electrical equivalent of heat, which involves converting electrical energy into heat and then measuring the temperature change to find how much heat was absorbed. The data provided includes resistance, voltage, time, masses of water and calorimeter, specific heat of the calorimeter, and initial and final temperatures.

Let me list the given data:

- Resistance (R) = 55 ohms
- Applied voltage (V) = 110 volts
- Mass of water (m_water) = 153 grams
- Mass of calorimeter (m_cal) = 60 grams
- Specific heat of calorimeter (c_cal) = 0.10 cal/(gm°C)
- Time of run (t) = 1.25 minutes
- Initial temp (T_initial) = 10.0°C
- Final temp (T_final) = 35.0°C

I think the approach is to calculate the electrical energy used and equate it to the heat absorbed by the water and calorimeter. Then, using that, compute J, which is the work done per calorie.

So, steps involved:

1. Calculate the electrical energy (E_elec) using power formula. Power (P) is V²/R, and energy is power multiplied by time. But time is in minutes, so I'll convert it to seconds.

2. Calculate the heat absorbed by the water and calorimeter. Heat (Q) is mass × specific heat × temp change. But wait, I don't have the specific heat of water given. Oh, wait, I think the specific heat of water is a standard value, around 1 cal/(gm°C), right? So I can use that.

3. Sum the heat absorbed by both the water and the calorimeter to get the total heat (Q_total).

4. Then, J is E_elec divided by Q_total, because J = work (energy) per calorie. So J = E_elec / Q_total.

Let me start with calculating E_elec.

Power P = V² / R = (110)^2 / 55. Let me compute that: 110 squared is 12100, divided by 55. 12100 /55 = 220 watts. So P=220 W.

Time t is 1.25 minutes, which is 75 seconds. So E = P * t = 220 * 75. Let's calculate that: 220 * 70 = 15400, 220*5=1100, so total 16500 Joules. So E_elec is 16500 J.

Next, calculate Q_total. Q is the sum of heat absorbed by water and calorimeter.

For water: Q_water = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial). c_water is 1 cal/(gm°C), so Q_water = 153 g * 1 cal/g°C * (35 -10)°C = 153 *25 = 3825 cal.

For calorimeter: Q_cal = m_cal * c_cal * delta T. So that's 60 g * 0.10 cal/(g°C) *25°C = 60 *0.10 *25 = 15 cal.

So total heat Q_total = 3825 +15 = 3840 cal.

Now, J is E_elec divided by Q_total, but wait, the units. E is in Joules, Q in calories. So J = E / Q = 16500 J / 3840 cal.

Let me compute that. 16500 / 3840. Let me see: 3840 *4=15360, which is less than 16500. 16500-15360=1140. So 4 plus 1140/3840. 1140/3840 is approximately 0.297. So 4.297 approx. Wait, but looking at the options, none is around 4.297. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me go through each step again.

Calculating E_elec:

V is 110 V, R is 55 ohms. P = V²/R = (110)^2 /55 = 12100 /55 = 220 W. Correct.

Time is 1.25 minutes, which is 75 seconds. So E = 220 *75 = 16500 J. Correct.

Now, Q_water: m=153g, c=1 cal/g°C, delta T=25. So 153 *25 = 3825 cal. Correct.

Q_cal: m=60g, c=0.10 cal/g°C, delta T=25. So 60*0.10=6, 6*25=150? Wait, no, wait, 60*0.10 is 6, then 6 *25=150? Wait, no, wait, 60 *0.10 is 6, 6 *25=150? Wait, no, wait, 60g * 0.10 cal/g°C =6 cal/°C, multiplied by 25°C gives 150 cal. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 15 cal. Oh wait no, I must have miscalculated earlier.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 60g *0.10 =6 cal/°C. 25°C rise, so 6 *25=150 cal. Oh! So earlier I thought it was 15 cal, but that's wrong. It's 150 cal. So that changes everything.

So Q_water is 3825 cal, Q_cal is 150 cal. So Q_total = 3825 +150=3975 cal.

Now, J = E_elec (in J) / Q_total (in cal). So 16500 J / 3975 cal.

Let me compute that: 16500 divided by 3975.

Let me try dividing numerator and denominator by 75: 16500 ÷75=220, 3975 ÷75=53. So 220/53 ≈4.1509 J/cal.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.15 J/cal. So the answer should be I.

To determine the value of \( J \), the mechanical equivalent of heat, we calculate the electrical energy converted to heat and the heat absorbed by the water and calorimeter. 

1. **Electrical Energy (\( E_{\text{elec}} \))**:  
   Using \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), \( P = \frac{110^2}{55} = 220 \, \text{W} \).  
   Time \( t = 1.25 \, \text{min} = 75 \, \text{s} \).  
   \( E_{\text{elec}} = P \times t = 220 \times 75 = 16500 \, \text{J} \).

2. **Heat Absorbed**:  
   - Water: \( Q_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \times c_{\text{water}} \times \Delta T = 153 \times 1 \times (35 - 10) = 3825 \, \text{cal} \).  
   - Calorimeter: \( Q_{\text{cal}} = m_{\text{cal}} \times c_{\text{cal}} \times \Delta T = 60 \times 0.10 \times 25 = 150 \, \text{cal} \).  
   Total heat \( Q_{\text{total}} = 3825 + 150 = 3975 \, \text{cal} \).

3. **Mechanical Equivalent of Heat (\( J \))**:  
   \( J = \frac{E_{\text{elec}}}{Q_{\text{total}}} = \frac{16500}{3975} \approx 4.15 \, \text{J/cal} \).

Thus, the value of \( J \) is **4.15 J/cal**, corresponding to option I.
