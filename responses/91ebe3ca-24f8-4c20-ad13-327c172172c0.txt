Alright, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about Hakim's 1995 and 1996 studies on part-time work done by women. Let me start by recalling what I remember about Hakim's work.

Hakim is known for her work on women and employment, particularly the concept of the "home-centered" life. She argues that many women choose part-time work because it allows them to balance their work and family responsibilities. She emphasizes that this is a rational choice based on their life priorities rather than just being constrained by structural factors.

Looking at the options:

A: Full-time work isn't available in the occupations they want. This might be a factor, but Hakim's focus is more on choice rather than lack of options.

B: Women prefer part-time for work-life balance. This aligns with Hakim's view, but the question is about the majority, so I need to see if it's the main reason.

C: Part-time offers flexible hours for domestic responsibilities. This also makes sense, as flexibility is a key benefit.

D: Rational choice to combine employment with home-centered lives. This seems more in line with Hakim's argument, as she talks about a rational decision based on life goals.

E: Less demanding nature. Part-time is less demanding, but Hakim's point is more about the choice to balance rather than the nature of the work itself.

F: Structural constraints like childcare. Hakim does discuss structural factors, but she also highlights that many women make a deliberate choice, so this might not be the main reason.

G: Employers' hiring due to stereotypes. This is more about discrimination, which Hakim might address, but the question is about why women choose part-time, not employers' hiring practices.

H: More time for personal development. While part-time might allow this, it's not the main reason Hakim emphasizes.

I: More part-time job opportunities. Availability could be a factor, but again, Hakim's focus is on choice rather than just opportunity.

J: High wages in part-time. This is unlikely because part-time often pays less; it's more about flexibility and balance.

So, Hakim's argument is that women rationally choose part-time work to combine employment with their home lives. Therefore, the best answer is D.

The answer is D: they make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives.

Answer: D
