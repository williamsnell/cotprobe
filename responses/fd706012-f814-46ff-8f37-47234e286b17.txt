Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 1990 multiplied by 1991 minus 1989 multiplied by 1990. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me see how I can approach this.

First, I should probably write it down to visualize it better. So, the expression is 1990×1991 - 1989×1990. Wait a second, I notice that both terms have a 1990 in them. Maybe I can factor that out to make it simpler.

Factoring 1990 out, the expression becomes 1990×(1991 - 1989). Let me check that: 1990 multiplied by (1991 minus 1989). That seems right because when you distribute, you get back to the original terms.

Now, let's compute what's inside the parentheses. 1991 minus 1989. Well, 1991 minus 1989 is 2. So now the expression is 1990×2. That's straightforward. 1990 times 2 is 3980. So the value of the expression is 3980.

Looking at the options, option B is 3980. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can approach it another way to double-check. Let's compute each multiplication separately and then subtract.

First, 1990×1991. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see: 1990×1991. Alternatively, I can think of 1991 as 1990 + 1. So 1990×(1990 + 1) = 1990² + 1990. Similarly, 1989×1990 is 1989×1990. Maybe I can express 1989 as 1990 - 1. So, 1989×1990 = (1990 - 1)×1990 = 1990² - 1990.

Now, subtracting these two: (1990² + 1990) - (1990² - 1990) = 1990² + 1990 - 1990² + 1990. The 1990² terms cancel out, leaving 1990 + 1990, which is 3980. Yep, same result as before. That confirms it.

Alternatively, I could think of the expression as a difference of products. There's a formula for a×b - c×a, which factors to a×(b - c). So, that's exactly what I did earlier. It's always good to factor when possible because it simplifies the calculation.

Another way to think about it: Let's assign variables to make it clearer. Let me set a = 1990. Then the expression becomes a×(a + 1) - (a - 1)×a. Expanding both terms: a² + a - (a² - a). Distribute the negative sign: a² + a - a² + a. The a² terms cancel, leaving 2a. Since a is 1990, 2×1990 is 3980.

This consistent result across different methods makes me confident that the answer is indeed 3980, which is option B.

The expression can be simplified by factoring out 1990, resulting in 1990×(1991 - 1989) = 1990×2 = 3980.

Answer: B
