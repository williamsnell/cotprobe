Okay, so I've got this electrical problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: A coil with a resistance of 0.05 ohms is connected to a cell that develops an EMF of 1.5 volts. I need to find the current flowing in two scenarios: (a) when the internal resistance of the cell is 0.1 ohms, and (b) when it's 0.01 ohms. The options are given from A to J, each with two values for the two parts.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with cells and internal resistance, the total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the coil's resistance and the cell's internal resistance. Oh wait, right, because they're in series. So the total resistance R_total is R_coil + R_internal.

The formula for current in a circuit is I = V/R, where V is the voltage (EMF in this case) and R is the total resistance. So I think I can apply Ohm's Law here.

Let me write down the given values:

- EMF (V) = 1.5 volts
- R_coil (Rc) = 0.05 ohms
- For part (a), R_internal (Ri) = 0.1 ohms
- For part (b), Ri = 0.01 ohms

So for part (a):

Total resistance R_total = Rc + Ri = 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 ohms.

Then current I = V / R_total = 1.5 / 0.15. Let me calculate that. 1.5 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 times 10 is 1.5, so 10 times 0.15 is 1.5, so 1.5 / 0.15 is 10? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.15 times 10 is 1.5, so 1.5 divided by 0.15 would be 10? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, 0.15 times 10 is 1.5. So 1.5 divided by 0.15 is indeed 10. So I think part (a) gives 10 amps.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check. 0.15 ohms times 10 amps is 1.5 volts. Yes, that makes sense.

But wait, looking at the options, none of the options have 10 for part (a). Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (a)7.5, (b)50
B:14,28
C:12,24
D:20,5
E:5,20
F:30,15
G:15,30
H:25,10
I:8,40
J:10,25

Wait, option J has (a)10 and (b)25. So if part (a) is 10A, that's option J. But let me check part (b) to see if it makes sense.

For part (b), Ri is 0.01 ohms. So R_total = 0.05 + 0.01 = 0.06 ohms.

Then current I = 1.5 / 0.06. Let's calculate that. 1.5 divided by 0.06. Well, 0.06 times 25 is 1.5 because 0.06*20=1.2, 0.06*5=0.3, so 20+5=25. So 1.5/0.06 =25 amps.

So for part (a), 10A and part (b), 25A. So the answer should be option J: (a)10, (b)25. But wait, looking back at the options, is there an option where (a) is 10 and (b) is 25? Let me check again.

Option J says (a)10 amp, (b)25 amp. So that's correct. But wait, in my initial calculation, I thought part (a) would be 10A, but looking at the options, option J seems to fit.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about part (a), I thought the current would be higher than 10A. Let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, Rc is 0.05 ohms, Ri (a) is 0.1 ohms. So total R is 0.15 ohms. 1.5 V divided by 0.15 ohms is indeed 10 amps. That's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option J has (a)10. So why does option I say (a)8 and (b)40? Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again. The coil has 0.05 ohms, connected to a cell with 1.5V EMF. Internal resistance is (a) 0.1 ohm, (b) 0.01 ohm. So yes, adding in series.

Hmm, maybe I should consider another approach. Oh wait, perhaps the coil is not in series with the internal resistance? No, that doesn't make sense because the cell's internal resistance is part of the circuit when connected to the load, which is the coil. So they are in series.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me do part (a) again: R_total = 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 ohms. V is 1.5 V. So I = 1.5 / 0.15 = 10A. That's correct.

For part (b): R_total = 0.05 + 0.01 = 0.06 ohms. I = 1.5 / 0.06 =25A.

So the answer should be option J: (a)10, (b)25.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any other option matching that. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when the internal resistance is much smaller, the current is higher. So in part (b), 25A seems right.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again. Oh, option I is (a)8, (b)40. Maybe I miscalculated part (a). Let me see, 0.05 + 0.1 is 0.15. 1.5 divided by 0.15 is 10. So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the coil's resistance is 0.05 ohms, which is very low, and the internal resistance is also varying. Maybe I should consider if the coil is in parallel with the internal resistance, but that doesn't make sense because the cell's internal resistance is in series with the load.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula I = V/R, but perhaps I'm not considering something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the EMF is 1.5 volts, but the actual voltage across the coil is less due to the internal resistance. Wait, no, because the internal resistance is in series, so the total voltage is split between the internal resistance and the coil. So the current is determined by the total resistance. So the initial approach is correct.

So, I think I'm confident that part (a) is 10A and part (b) is 25A, which is option J.

The problem involves calculating the current flowing through a coil connected to a cell with an EMF of 1.5 volts, considering the internal resistance of the cell. The coil's resistance is 0.05 ohms, and the internal resistance is given as 0.1 ohms for part (a) and 0.01 ohms for part (b). 

For part (a), the total resistance is the sum of the coil's resistance and the internal resistance:  
\[
R_{\text{total}} = 0.05 \, \Omega + 0.1 \, \Omega = 0.15 \, \Omega
\]  
Using Ohm's Law, the current is:  
\[
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1.5 \, \text{V}}{0.15 \, \Omega} = 10 \, \text{A}
\]

For part (b), the total resistance is:  
\[
R_{\text{total}} = 0.05 \, \Omega + 0.01 \, \Omega = 0.06 \, \Omega
\]  
The current is:  
\[
I = \frac{1.5 \, \text{V}}{0.06 \, \Omega} = 25 \, \text{A}
\]

From the options provided, the correct choice is **J**, which corresponds to (a) 10 amp and (b) 25 amp.
