Okay, so I have this problem about water flowing through a tube, and I need to find the drop in pressure over a length of 10 feet. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that when a fluid flows through a pipe, the pressure drop can be calculated using something related to friction. I think it's called the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's just the simple case of viscous flow where pressure drop (ΔP) is given by some formula involving viscosity, velocity, and other factors.

Wait, the formula I think is ΔP = ( - 4 * η * L * v ) / ( r² ), where η is viscosity, L is the length, v is velocity, and r is the radius of the pipe. Or maybe it's divided by the radius squared. Let me think again. Oh right, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for pressure drop in laminar flow is ΔP = (8 * η * L * v) / (π r²), but I'm a bit confused because sometimes it's written with a negative sign, but since we're talking about drop, we can ignore the sign and just take the magnitude.

Wait, no, another thought: the formula might be ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (r² * π), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is more general and applies to both laminar and turbulent flow. The Darcy equation is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D), where f is the Darcy friction factor. But wait, for laminar flow, f = 64 / Re, where Re is Reynolds number.

Hmm, but maybe since the problem gives me all the necessary parameters, I can approach it directly without getting too deep into the theory. Let me list the given data:

- Water density (ρ) = 62.4 lb/ft³
- Viscosity (η) = 0.000672 lb/(ft·sec)
- Tube bore diameter (d) = 0.25 inches. Oh wait, I need to convert that to feet because all other units are in feet. Since 1 inch is 1/12 ft, so 0.25 inches is 0.25 / 12 = 0.0208333 ft.
- Velocity (v) = 1 ft/s
- Length (L) = 10 ft

I need to find the pressure drop (ΔP) over this length.

So, let's think about the formula. The pressure drop due to viscous flow (laminar) in a pipe can be calculated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is:

ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * r²)

Where:
- η is the dynamic viscosity,
- L is the length of the pipe,
- v is the velocity,
- r is the radius of the pipe.

Alternatively, since the pipe diameter is given, I can express it in terms of diameter d, because r = d/2. So substituting r = d/2 into the equation, we get:

ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * (d/2)²)
= (128 * η * L * v) / (π * d² /4)
= (128 * 4 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)
= (512 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

Wait, that seems correct. Let me double-check the algebra. Oh wait, (d/2)^2 is d²/4, so when you divide by d²/4, it's the same as multiplying by 4/d². So 128 * 4 = 512, yes.

So now, plugging in the numbers:

η = 0.000672 lb/(ft·s)
L = 10 ft
v = 1 ft/s
d = 0.25 in = 0.0208333 ft

So plugging these into the formula:

ΔP = (512 * 0.000672 * 10 * 1) / (π * (0.0208333)^2)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 512 * 0.000672 * 10 * 1

Calculating 512 * 0.000672:

512 * 0.000672 = Let's compute 512 * 672e-6.

512 * 672 = Let's see: 500 * 672 = 336,000. 12 * 672 = 8,064. So total is 336,000 + 8,064 = 344,064. So 344,064e-6 = 0.344064.

Then multiply by 10: 0.344064 * 10 = 3.44064.

Now the denominator: π * (0.0208333)^2.

Calculate (0.0208333)^2: 0.0208333 * 0.0208333 ≈ 0.000434027778.

Multiply by π: 3.1415926535 * 0.000434027778 ≈ 0.001362.

So now ΔP = numerator / denominator = 3.44064 / 0.001362 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division. 

3.44064 ÷ 0.001362 ≈ Let's see, 3.44064 / 0.001362 ≈ around 2524.32? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in single digits. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations because I think I messed up somewhere.

Wait, 0.0208333 ft is the diameter. So radius is 0.01041665 ft. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (0.0208333)^2 correctly. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.0208333 squared: 0.0208333 * 0.0208333.

Let me compute 0.02 * 0.02 = 0.0004. Then, 0.0008333 * 0.02 ≈ 0.000016666, but wait, perhaps better to compute it as (0.0208333)^2.

Using a calculator approach:

0.0208333 * 0.0208333:

= (0.02 + 0.0008333) * (0.02 + 0.0008333)
= 0.02^2 + 2*0.02*0.0008333 + (0.0008333)^2
= 0.0004 + 2*(0.000016666) + 0.000000694
= 0.0004 + 0.000033332 + 0.000000694 ≈ 0.000434026.

So denominator is π * 0.000434026 ≈ 3.14159265 * 0.000434026 ≈ Let's compute that.

3.14159265 * 0.000434026 ≈ 

Well, 3 * 0.000434026 = 0.001302078.

0.14159265 * 0.000434026 ≈ Approximately 0.0000614.

So total denominator ≈ 0.001302078 + 0.0000614 ≈ 0.001363478.

Now numerator: 512 * 0.000672 = Let me compute 512 * 0.000672.

0.000672 is 6.72e-4. So 512 * 6.72e-4 = ?

512 * 6e-4 = 0.3072, and 512 * 0.72e-4 = 512 * 0.000072 = 0.036864.

Adding together: 0.3072 + 0.036864 = 0.344064.

Multiply by 10: 0.344064 *10 = 3.44064.

So ΔP = 3.44064 / 0.001363478 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division. 

3.44064 ÷ 0.001363478 ≈ Let me see: 3.44064 / 0.001363478 ≈ 2524.32 psf? That can't be right because the options are all single digits. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Another approach: Maybe the pressure drop is calculated using the formula ΔP = (η * L * v) / (2 * r²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the units.

Wait, let me check the units. The given viscosity is in lb/(ft·s), which is slug/ft·s, since 1 lb s²/ft = 1 slug. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the formula I used isn't correct. Let me think again.

Another approach: The pressure drop for laminar flow in a pipe is given by:

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D)

Where f is the Darcy friction factor. For laminar flow, f = 64 / Re, where Re is Reynolds number.

Reynolds number Re = (ρ * v * D) / η.

So let's compute Re first.

ρ = 62.4 lb/ft³
v = 1 ft/s
D = 0.0208333 ft
η = 0.000672 lb/(ft·s)

Re = (62.4 * 1 * 0.0208333) / 0.000672

Compute numerator: 62.4 * 0.0208333 ≈ 

62.4 * 0.02 = 1.248
62.4 * 0.0008333 ≈ 0.0516666
Total ≈ 1.248 + 0.0516666 ≈ 1.2996666

So Re = 1.2996666 / 0.000672 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.000672 is 6.72e-4. So 1.2996666 / 0.000672 ≈ 1.2996666 ÷ 0.000672.

Dividing 1.2996666 by 0.000672:

Well, 1.2996666 ÷ 0.000672 ≈ 1.2996666 * (1 / 0.000672) ≈ 1.2996666 * 1489.39 ≈ Approximately 1.2996666 * 1489.39 ≈ 1924.5 approximately.

So Re ≈ 1924.5, which is in the laminar flow regime (Re < 2000 is usually considered laminar).

Then, f = 64 / Re ≈ 64 / 1924.5 ≈ 0.03325.

Now, using the Darcy equation: ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D)

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.03325
L = 10 ft
ρ = 62.4 lb/ft³
v = 1 ft/s
D = 0.0208333 ft

So ΔP = (0.03325 * 10 * 62.4 * 1²) / (2 * 0.0208333)

Compute numerator: 0.03325 * 10 = 0.3325; 0.3325 * 62.4 = Let's compute that.

62.4 * 0.3325:

62.4 * 0.3 = 18.72
62.4 * 0.03 = 1.872
62.4 * 0.0025 = 0.156
Adding together: 18.72 + 1.872 = 20.592 + 0.156 = 20.748

So numerator is 20.748.

Denominator: 2 * 0.0208333 ≈ 0.0416666.

So ΔP = 20.748 / 0.0416666 ≈ ?

20.748 ÷ 0.0416666 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.0416666 is 1/24, so dividing by 1/24 is multiplying by 24.

So 20.748 * 24 ≈ 20.748 * 20 = 414.96, 20.748 *4=82.992 → total 414.96 +82.992=497.952.

So ΔP ≈ 497.952 psf. But wait, that's way higher than the options given, which are all single-digit psf. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, maybe I should use the correct formula for the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.

Let me try using the Hagen-Poiseuille formula again, but perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier. Let's redo it carefully.

The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

Wait, that's another version, where d is the diameter.

So plugging in the numbers:

η = 0.000672 lb/(ft·s)
L = 10 ft
v = 1 ft/s
d = 0.0208333 ft

So ΔP = (128 * 0.000672 * 10 * 1) / (π * (0.0208333)^2)

Compute numerator: 128 * 0.000672 = Let's compute that.

128 * 0.000672 = 

Well, 100 * 0.000672 = 0.0672
28 * 0.000672 = 0.018816
So total = 0.0672 + 0.018816 = 0.086016

Multiply by 10: 0.086016 *10 = 0.86016

So numerator is 0.86016.

Denominator: π * (0.0208333)^2 ≈ π * 0.00043402778 ≈ 0.001362 (as computed earlier).

So ΔP = 0.86016 / 0.001362 ≈ ?

0.86016 ÷ 0.001362 ≈ 630.56 psf. But that's still way higher than the options, which are in single digits. So I must be doing something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the units somewhere. Let me check the units again.

The viscosity is given as 0.000672 lb/(ft·s). Wait, lb is a force, but in the context of viscosity, it's actually lb·s/ft², because viscosity has units of Pa·s (Pascal-seconds) in SI, which is equivalent to N·s/m². In imperial units, that's lb·s/ft².

Wait, so perhaps the given viscosity is 0.000672 lb/(ft·s), which is the same as 0.000672 lb·s/ft². So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the formula again. Wait, another thought: Maybe the pressure drop is calculated using the velocity and the gravitational component, but that doesn't make sense here because it's a pressure drop due to friction, not elevation.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for head loss in a pipe, which is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2gD), but that would give the head in feet, and then multiply by the density to get pressure in psf.

Wait, let me try that approach.

Head loss due to friction (h_f) = (f * L * v²) / (2gD)

Where:
f = friction factor (from earlier, f ≈ 0.03325)
L = 10 ft
v = 1 ft/s
g = 32.174 ft/s²
D = 0.0208333 ft

So h_f = (0.03325 * 10 * 1^2) / (2 * 32.174 * 0.0208333)

Compute numerator: 0.03325 *10 = 0.3325

Denominator: 2 *32.174=64.348; 64.348 *0.0208333 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.0208333 *64.348 ≈ 

0.02 *64.348 =1.28696
0.0008333 *64.348≈ 0.053623
Total ≈1.28696 +0.053623≈1.340583

So h_f = 0.3325 / 1.340583 ≈ 0.2483 ft.

Now, pressure drop ΔP = density * g * h_f

Density ρ =62.4 lb/ft³
g=32.174 ft/s²
h_f=0.2483 ft

ΔP =62.4 *32.174 *0.2483

Compute 62.4 *32.174 first:

62.4 *32 = 1996.8
62.4 *0.174≈10.8576
Total ≈1996.8 +10.8576 ≈2007.6576

Then multiply by 0.2483:

2007.6576 *0.2483 ≈ Let's compute:

2000 *0.2483 =496.6
7.6576 *0.2483 ≈1.900

So total ≈496.6 +1.900≈498.5 psf. Again, this is way higher than the options, so something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the units again. Maybe the formula I'm using isn't correct for the given units.

Wait, another thought: The formula for pressure drop using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation is correct, but perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me try computing it again.

ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

Given:
η = 0.000672 lb/(ft·s)
L =10 ft
v=1 ft/s
d=0.0208333 ft

Compute numerator: 128 * 0.000672 = 0.086016

Multiply by L and v: 0.086016 *10 *1=0.86016

Denominator: π * (0.0208333)^2 = π * 0.00043402778 ≈ 0.001362

So ΔP =0.86016 /0.001362 ≈ 630.56 psf.

But that's way higher than the options, which are all single-digit. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on velocity and the pipe's resistance, without considering the full Hagen-Poiseuille or Darcy factors. Maybe it's a simple approximation where ΔP = (η * v) / r, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the radius, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula for the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The correct form is ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * d²), yes. So that's what I used.

But the result is way off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the diameter from inches to feet. Let me check that again.

Diameter d =0.25 inches. Since 1 inch =0.0833333 ft, so 0.25 inches = 0.25 * 0.0833333 ft = 0.0208333 ft. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the radius instead of diameter. Let me try that.

If I express the formula using radius r =d/2=0.01041665 ft.

Then, ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * r²)

So plugging in:

128 *0.000672 =0.086016

Multiply by L=10 and v=1: 0.86016

Denominator: π*(0.01041665)^2 = π*(0.000108506) ≈0.000340842

So ΔP=0.86016 /0.000340842 ≈2524.32 psf. Again, way off.

Hmm, this is perplexing. All approaches give a pressure drop way higher than the options provided. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere, or maybe the units are off.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. Maybe I'm confusing pounds-force with pounds-mass.

Wait, in the problem, density is given as 62.4 lb/ft³. That's actually pounds-mass per cubic foot, but in the imperial system, sometimes lb is used for force. Wait, no, in fluid mechanics, when dealing with pressure and viscosity, sometimes the units can be a bit tricky.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the formula should use the absolute viscosity in different units. Let me check the units of the formula.

The Hagen-Poiseuille equation in imperial units would require η in lb/(ft·s), which it is. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe without considering the full equation. Maybe it's using a simplified version where ΔP is proportional to velocity and inversely proportional to radius squared, but without the constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different formula altogether.

Wait, let me try to compute using the formula ΔP = (η * v) / r², but that's probably incorrect.

η=0.000672 lb/(ft·s)
v=1 ft/s
r=0.01041665 ft

ΔP = (0.000672 *1) / (0.01041665)^2 ≈0.000672 / 0.000108506 ≈6.201 psf. Hmm, that's close to option B (8.22) or D (9.78), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the units correctly. Let me check the units of the formula again. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation gives pressure in pounds per square foot (psf), which matches the options.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use the formula ΔP = (8 * η * L * v) / (π * r²). Let me try that.

So, r =0.01041665 ft.

ΔP = (8 *0.000672 *10 *1) / (π*(0.01041665)^2 )

Numerator:8 *0.000672=0.005376; 0.005376 *10=0.05376.

Denominator: π*(0.01041665)^2 ≈3.1416 *0.000108506 ≈0.0003408.

So ΔP=0.05376 /0.0003408 ≈157.75 psf. Still way higher than options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look it up in my notes.

Hagen-Poiseuille equation: ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

Yes, that's correct. So I think I did it right, but the answer comes out way higher than the options. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like assuming the flow is turbulent and using a different friction factor, but that seems unlikely given the parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different flow condition, like using the velocity at the center instead of the average velocity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem expects me to use the formula ΔP = (1/2) * η * v / r², but that's probably not the case.

Let me try that: η=0.000672, v=1, r=0.01041665.

ΔP=0.5 *0.000672 *1 / (0.01041665)^2 =0.000336 /0.000108506≈3.100 psf. That's close to option A (15.38) but not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the problem differently. Maybe it's a gravity-driven flow, but the problem states the velocity, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's diameter, but using a different constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different version of the formula where the pressure drop is (η * v) / (r²), but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula uses the radius or diameter correctly. Let me re-express the formula using diameter.

Using diameter d, the formula is ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

So plugging in the numbers again:

128 *0.000672 =0.086016

Multiply by L=10, v=1: 0.86016

Divide by π*(0.0208333)^2: π*(0.00043402778)=0.001362

So ΔP=0.86016 /0.001362≈630.56 psf.

This is the same result as before, which is way off from the options. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like assuming a different flow regime or using a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a circular tube but with a different approach, like considering the velocity profile differently. Alternatively, maybe it's using the formula ΔP = (12 * η * L * v) / (r²), but that's just a guess.

Let me try that: 12 *0.000672=0.008064

Multiply by L=10, v=1: 0.08064

Divide by (0.01041665)^2=0.000108506

So ΔP=0.08064 /0.000108506≈743.28 psf. Still way off.

Hmm, I'm stuck. All approaches give a pressure drop much higher than the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be ΔP = (η * L * v) / (r²), which would give:

η=0.000672, L=10, v=1, r=0.01041665.

So (0.000672 *10 *1) / (0.01041665)^2 = 0.00672 /0.000108506≈62.00 psf. Still higher than options.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop without considering the full Hagen-Poiseuille equation, perhaps assuming a different relationship, like ΔP proportional to velocity times viscosity over radius squared, but without the constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔP = (η * v) / (r), which would give:

0.000672 *1 / 0.01041665 ≈0.064512 psf, which is way too low.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the formula ΔP = (2 * η * L * v) / (r²). Let me try:

2 *0.000672=0.001344

Multiply by L=10, v=1: 0.01344

Divide by (0.01041665)^2=0.000108506

So ΔP=0.01344 /0.000108506≈123.97 psf. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula ΔP = (η * L * v) / (π * r^4), but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula for head loss in a pipe but in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard formula again to make sure. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is correct. So perhaps the issue is that the problem is using a different unit system or I'm missing a conversion factor.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the viscosity is given in incorrect units. Let me check. The given viscosity is 0.000672 lb/(ft·s). Wait, in imperial units, the dynamic viscosity (absolute viscosity) is in lb/(ft·s), which is correct. So that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the radius instead of diameter, but I think I've tried that already.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a different flow condition, like turbulent flow with a different friction factor. But given the low velocity and small diameter, it's likely laminar.

Wait, let's compute the Reynolds number again to confirm.

Re = (ρ * v * D) / η = (62.4 *1 *0.0208333) /0.000672 ≈(1.2996666)/0.000672≈1924.5.

Since Re is about 1924, which is less than 2000, it's definitely laminar. So the Hagen-Poiseuille equation should apply.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for π? Let me try using π=22/7 ≈3.142857.

So denominator becomes 3.142857 *0.00043402778≈0.001363.

Numerator remains 0.86016.

So ΔP=0.86016 /0.001363≈630.6 psf. Still the same result.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the answer in psi instead of psf, but that doesn't make sense because psi is pounds per square inch, while the options are in psf (pounds per square foot). So that can't be it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I made a mistake in the formula and it's actually ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (d²), without the π. Let me try that.

So ΔP =128 *0.000672 *10 *1 / (0.0208333)^2

Compute numerator:128 *0.000672=0.086016; *10=0.86016.

Denominator: (0.0208333)^2=0.00043402778.

So ΔP=0.86016 /0.00043402778≈1981.6 psf. Still way off.

Wait, perhaps the formula is missing a factor. Maybe the correct formula is ΔP = (64 * η * L * v) / (d²), which would give:

64 *0.000672=0.043008; *10=0.43008.

Divide by 0.00043402778: 0.43008 /0.00043402778≈990.91 psf. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck here. All possible variations of the formula I can think of give a pressure drop much higher than the options provided. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's resistance, but perhaps it's using a different approach, like the formula ΔP = (η * v) / (r), which would be incorrect but let's try.

η=0.000672, v=1, r=0.01041665.

ΔP=0.000672 *1 /0.01041665≈0.064512 psf. Way too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔP = (η * v) / (r²), which would be:

0.000672 *1 / (0.01041665)^2≈0.000672 /0.000108506≈6.201 psf. Closest to option B (8.22) but not matching.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is ΔP = (η * L * v) / (r²), which would be:

0.000672 *10 *1 / (0.01041665)^2≈0.00672 /0.000108506≈62.00 psf. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different version where the formula includes the density. Let me think about that.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the pressure drop is calculated using the formula ΔP = (1/2) * η * (v^2) / r², but that seems incorrect.

So, 0.5 *0.000672 *1^2 / (0.01041665)^2≈0.000336 /0.000108506≈3.100 psf. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔP = (η * L * v) / (2 * r²), which would give:

0.000672 *10 *1 / (2 *0.000108506)≈0.00672 /0.000217012≈31.00 psf. Still not matching.

I'm really not sure where I'm going wrong. All possible calculations I try result in a pressure drop way higher than the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, like using the velocity and the pipe's diameter to find the flow rate and then relate it to pressure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units again. Maybe the problem is using the metric system, but no, the units are in imperial.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's diameter, but using a different constant. Let me try using a different constant, like 160 instead of 128.

So ΔP = (160 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

160 *0.000672=0.10752; *10=1.0752.

Divide by π *0.00043402778≈0.001362.

So ΔP≈1.0752 /0.001362≈791.4 psf. Still way off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula altogether. Maybe it's using the formula for a different type of flow, like a sudden expansion or something else, but the problem states it's flowing in a tube, so that's probably not it.

At this point, I'm stuck. I've tried multiple approaches, but none give an answer close to the provided options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's diameter, but without considering the full Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Alternatively, perhaps it's using a simplified version where ΔP = (η * v) / (d^2), but that seems incorrect.

So, η=0.000672, v=1, d=0.0208333.

ΔP=0.000672 *1 / (0.0208333)^2 ≈0.000672 /0.00043402778≈1.547 psf. Still way too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔP = (η * v) / (d), which would be:

0.000672 *1 /0.0208333 ≈0.032256 psf. No, that's even lower.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the problem is using a different formula entirely, perhaps involving the density, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's diameter, but using a different approach, like considering the fluid's kinetic energy. But that doesn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔP = (1/4) * η * v / r², which would give:

0.25 *0.000672 *1 / (0.01041665)^2≈0.000168 /0.000108506≈1.547 psf. Still too low.

I'm really stuck. I think I've exhausted all possible approaches I can think of, but none are giving me an answer close to the options provided. Perhaps I'm missing a key piece of information or making a fundamental mistake in the approach. Given the time I've spent and the options available, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the closest I got earlier, which was around 6.2 psf, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier, and the correct answer is option B: 8.22 psf.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the formula ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (d² * π), but I think I did that already.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula again, but more carefully.

ΔP = (128 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

Plugging in the numbers:

128 *0.000672 =0.086016

Multiply by L=10: 0.86016

Divide by π * (0.0208333)^2 ≈3.1416 *0.00043402778≈0.001362

So ΔP=0.86016 /0.001362≈630.56 psf.

This is the same result as before. Since none of the options are close to this, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula for a different flow condition, like turbulent flow with a different friction factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's diameter, but using the wrong exponent. For example, maybe it's using d^3 instead of d², but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔP = (η * L * v) / (d), which would give:

0.000672 *10 *1 /0.0208333 ≈0.00672 /0.0208333≈0.322 psf. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's diameter, but using a different constant like 64 instead of 128.

So ΔP = (64 * η * L * v) / (π * d²)

64 *0.000672=0.043008

Multiply by L=10: 0.43008

Divide by π *0.00043402778≈0.001362

ΔP=0.43008 /0.001362≈316.28 psf. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔP = (8 * η * L * v) / (π * d²), which would give:

8 *0.000672=0.005376

Multiply by L=10:0.05376

Divide by π *0.00043402778≈0.001362

ΔP=0.05376 /0.001362≈39.56 psf. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. All possible variations give a result way higher than the options. Maybe I should consider that the problem is using a different approach entirely, like considering the flow as turbulent and using a different friction factor, but given the low Reynolds number, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for pressure drop in a pipe based on the velocity and the pipe's diameter, but using a different unit conversion. Let me check the unit conversions again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the diameter in inches instead of feet, which would change everything. Let me try that.

If I mistakenly use d=0.25 inches instead of converting to feet, then:

d=0.25 in. So diameter in feet is 0.25/12=0.0208333 ft, which is what I did earlier. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the diameter in inches without converting, which would be wrong, but let me see what happens.

If I use d=0.25 inches, which is 0.25/12=0.0208333 ft, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the radius in inches. Let me try that.

r=0.125 inches=0.125/12=0.01041667 ft.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, so no change.

Hmm, I'm really not sure where I'm going wrong. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is likely option B: 8.22 psf, but I can't see how to get that from the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula ΔP = (η * v) / (r²), which would give:

η=0.000672, v=1, r=0.01041665 ft.

So ΔP=0.000672 / (0.01041665)^2≈0.000672 /0.000108506≈6.201 psf. Closest to option B (8.22), but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula that includes the density. Let me think about that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔP = (ρ * η * L * v) / (2 * r²), which would give:

ρ=62.4 lb/ft³

So, 62.4 *0.000672=0.0419568

Multiply by L=10, v=1: 0.419568

Divide by 2*(0.01041665)^2=2*0.000108506≈0.000217012

So ΔP=0.419568 /0.000217012≈1932.39 psf. Still way off.

I think I've tried everything I can think of. Given the options, the closest I got was around 6.2 psf, which isn't an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps the correct answer is option B:8.22 psf, but I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different formula or approach that I'm not recalling.
</think>

To determine the drop in pressure for water flowing through a tube, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow was used:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{128 \cdot \eta \cdot L \cdot v}{\pi \cdot d^2}
\]

where:
- \( \eta = 0.000672 \, \text{lb/(ft·s)} \) (viscosity),
- \( L = 10 \, \text{ft} \) (length of the tube),
- \( v = 1 \, \text{ft/s} \) (velocity),
- \( d = 0.0208333 \, \text{ft} \) (diameter, converted from 0.25 inches).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator
\[
128 \cdot 0.000672 = 0.086016
\]
\[
0.086016 \cdot 10 = 0.86016
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
\[
d^2 = (0.0208333)^2 = 0.00043402778
\]
\[
\pi \cdot 0.00043402778 = 0.001362
\]

### Step 3: Calculate pressure drop
\[
\Delta P = \frac{0.86016}{0.001362} \approx 630.56 \, \text{psf}
\]

This result is significantly higher than the provided options, suggesting a possible error in the approach or units. Despite multiple recalculations and alternative methods, the result remained inconsistent with the options. Given the closest match to earlier estimates, the answer is likely:

**B: 8.22 psf**

Answer: B
