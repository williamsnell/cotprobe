Alright, so I have this question about Socrates and his beliefs. I remember from my philosophy class that Socrates was all about questioning and seeking knowledge. The question is about how his belief that "virtue is knowledge" relates to his statement that "the unexamined life is not worth living." I need to figure out the connection between these two ideas.

First, let me break down what each part means. "Virtue is knowledge" suggests that Socrates thinks that having knowledge, specifically about what's right and wrong, leads to being virtuous. So, if you know the right things to do, you'll be good. On the other hand, "the unexamined life is not worth living" implies that living without thinking deeply, without questioning, is not a life worth living. So, he values deep thinking and self-examination.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the unexamined life is living day to day without asking big questions about existence. That sounds a bit like what Socrates might say, but I'm not sure how it directly ties to "virtue is knowledge." It's more about the nature of an unexamined life rather than the link between knowledge and virtue.

Option B mentions the Delphic oracle calling Socrates the wisest because he knew nothing. Wait, that's from a story where Socrates was told he was the wisest, but he realized others claimed knowledge while he admitted uncertainty. This relates more to his humility and method of questioning, but how does that connect to the link between virtue and knowledge? It's about wisdom, but maybe not the direct link.

Option C talks about questioning traditional beliefs and learning which answers are better. This seems relevant because Socrates often used questioning to expose people's lack of knowledge. If we question, we can find better answers, which would lead to better virtue because we have better knowledge. That seems to connect the examined life with gaining knowledge that leads to virtue.

Option D says the only way to be good is to know universal norms. That sounds a bit like the idea of knowing the right behavior, which aligns with "virtue is knowledge." But does it directly relate to why the unexamined life isn't worth living? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

So, thinking about it, Socrates' method was all about questioning to gain true knowledge. The unexamined life is one where you don't question, so you don't gain that knowledge. Therefore, without examining, you can't have the knowledge needed for virtue. 

Option C says that by questioning, we learn which answers are better. That process of questioning leads to better understanding and knowledge, which in turn leads to virtue. So, the examined life (questioning) is necessary for gaining the knowledge that constitutes virtue.

Option D is about knowing universal norms, which is a bit more about having the right knowledge, but it doesn't directly tie to the process of examination. C is more about the method of questioning leading to better answers, which is central to Socrates' approach.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C because it directly connects the examined life (questioning) to gaining knowledge that leads to virtue.
