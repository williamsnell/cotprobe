Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex polygon, and I need to find out how many vertices it has. The question says it has 26 faces and 39 edges, and I have to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in geometry, especially for convex polyhedrons, there's Euler's formula that relates the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F). The formula is V - E + F = 2. Maybe I can use that here.

Wait, the problem says it's a convex polygon. Wait, no, a polygon is a 2D shape, but this seems to be talking about a 3D object because it mentions faces. Oh, right, a convex polyhedron has faces, edges, and vertices. So maybe the problem is actually about a convex polyhedron, not a polygon. That makes sense because a polygon only has edges and vertices, not faces.

So if it's a polyhedron with 26 faces and 39 edges, I can plug those numbers into Euler's formula to find the number of vertices. Let me write that down.

Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

We know E is 39, F is 26. So plugging in:

V - 39 + 26 = 2.

Let me do the math. Subtracting 39 from both sides: V + (26 - 39) = 2 → V -13 = 2. Then, adding 13 to both sides: V = 15.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculation again. So 26 faces, 39 edges. So V - 39 + 26 = 2 → V -13 = 2 → V=15. Hmm, that gives V=15, which is option D.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought Euler's formula applies to convex polyhedrons, and 26 faces and 39 edges seem a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me think: for a cube, which is a simple convex polyhedron, it has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices. Plugging into Euler's formula: 8 -12 +6=2. Yep, that works.

Another example: a tetrahedron has 4 faces, 6 edges, 4 vertices. 4-6+4=2. So formula holds.

So if I apply it here: 26 faces, 39 edges. So 26+39=65. So V=15. So 15-39+26=2. Let me compute: 15-39 is -24, plus 26 is +2. Yep, that works.

So the number of vertices is 15, which is option D.

Wait, but the options are A:18, B:20, C:36, D:15, E:30, F:40, G:25, H:24, I:22, J:33. So D is 15. So that's the answer.

The problem involves a convex polyhedron with 26 faces (F) and 39 edges (E). Using Euler's formula for polyhedra, V - E + F = 2, we substitute the known values:

V - 39 + 26 = 2  
V - 13 = 2  
V = 15.

Thus, the number of vertices is 15, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
