Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about Owen's jean waist size. He currently has blue jeans with a 32-inch waist. The problem says his waist circumference increases by 15%, and we need to find the new waist size to the nearest whole inch. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, first, I think I should calculate what a 15% increase on 32 inches would be. I remember that percentage increase can be calculated by multiplying the original number by (1 + the percentage as a decimal). So 15% is the same as 0.15. So the formula would be 32 * (1 + 0.15), right?

Let me do that math. 32 times 1.15. Let's break it down. 32 times 1 is 32, and 32 times 0.15 is... Well, 0.1 times 32 is 3.2, and 0.05 times 32 is 1.6. So adding those together, 3.2 + 1.6 is 4.8. So 32 + 4.8 equals 36.8 inches.

Wait, so the new waist size is 36.8 inches. But the question says to round to the nearest whole inch. So 36.8 is between 36 and 37. Since the decimal is .8, which is more than .5, we round up to 37 inches.

Looking at the options, let's see which one that is. The options are A:36, B:33, C:39, D:38, E:41, F:32, G:34, H:40, I:35, J:37. So J is 37 inches, which matches my calculation.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the math again. 32 * 1.15. Alternatively, I can think of 15% of 32. 10% is 3.2, so 15% is 3.2 + half of that, which is 1.6, so 3.2 + 1.6 = 4.8. Adding that to 32 gives 36.8, which rounds to 37. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes there. So the answer should be J: 37 inches.

The new waist size after a 15% increase on 32 inches is calculated as 32 * 1.15 = 36.8 inches, which rounds up to 37 inches.

Answer: J
