Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Stevenson's primary aim is in this paper. The options are A through D. I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher, specifically a moral philosopher. He's known for his work in ethical theory, so I think he might have written about different aspects of ethics.

Looking at the options, option A says "provide an account of what makes right actions right." That sounds a bit like a theory of morality, explaining the criteria for right actions. But I'm not sure if Stevenson focused on that. I seem to recall he was more into the idea of ethical relativism or perhaps the role of emotions in ethics.

Option B is "establish which things are good in themselves." This seems like a more specific question, maybe about axiology, the study of value. Stevenson might have discussed what is good, but I'm not sure if that's his primary aim, or if he's more about the methodology of ethics.

Option C is about developing a theory of good moral character. That makes me think of virtue ethics, which focuses on the character traits that make a good person. Stevenson might have touched on this, but I'm not certain if that's his main goal in the paper.

Option D says "make ethical questions clear." This sounds more like a meta-ethical concern, perhaps about clarifying ethical language or the nature of ethical statements. Stevenson is known for his work on ethical terms and how they function. He might have aimed to clarify or analyze ethical questions rather than provide a theory.

Wait, Stevenson wrote about the "emotivist" theory, which is a type of meta-ethics. Emotivists argue that ethical statements express emotions rather than state facts. If his primary aim is about making ethical questions clear, that would align with analyzing the structure of ethical discourse, which is a meta-ethical concern.

So, putting it together, Stevenson's main aim in the paper is likely to clarify ethical questions, which would be option D. He's trying to understand how ethical language works and perhaps make the discussions in ethics more precise or methodological.
