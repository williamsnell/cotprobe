Okay, so I have this question about the speed of data transmission in a 4G network. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think about what I know regarding 4G speeds.

I remember that 4G is the fourth generation of mobile networks, succeeding 3G. It's known for being faster than 3G, which typically maxed out at around a few Mbps. So 4G must be much faster than that. But how fast exactly?

I think 4G can handle both mobile data and internet access, right? I've heard terms like "4G LTE" which stands for Long Term Evolution, and that's an improvement over the original 4G. LTE is supposed to make 4G even faster.

Wait, so what are the typical speeds? I recall that 4G can offer speeds up to 1 Gbps, but in real-world conditions, it's usually less. Like, maybe between 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps on average. But sometimes, under ideal conditions, it can go higher. But does it reach up to 1 Gbps? I'm not sure if that's realistic for most users or just theoretical maximums.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 10 gbps - 100 gbps. That seems way too high. I don't think 4G goes that fast. That's more like 5G territory or fiber optics.

Option B: 50 mbps - 500 mbps. That's 0.05 to 0.5 Gbps. That sounds possible, but I'm not sure if 4G usually goes up to 500 Mbps.

Option C: 2 mbps – 1 gbps. So from 2 Mbps up to 1 Gbps. That range seems too broad. 2 Mbps is on the lower side, but 1 Gbps is high. I'm not sure if 4G can reach 1 Gbps consistently.

Option D: 100 mbps - 1 gbps. So 0.1 to 1 Gbps. That seems possible. Some sources say 4G can reach up to 1 Gbps, but maybe that's under perfect conditions.

Option E: 386 kbps - 2 mbps. That's lower than 4G, more like 3G speeds. So probably not this one.

Option F: 2 mbps. Too low, same as E.

Option G: 1 mbps - 10 mbps. Also too low, maybe edge cases or poor signal.

Option H: 1 gbps - 10 gbps. Again, seems too high for 4G.

Option I: 10 mbps - 100 mbps. So 0.01 to 0.1 Gbps. This seems more realistic for average 4G speeds, but maybe the upper end is a bit high.

Option J: 500 kbps - 1.5 mbps. Also too low, maybe older tech.

So narrowing it down, the options are B, C, D, and I. I think the correct range is somewhere between 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps or up to 1 Gbps.

Wait, I remember reading that the theoretical maximum for 4G is around 1 Gbps, but in practice, it's usually much lower. So maybe the correct answer includes up to 1 Gbps as the maximum. Looking at the options, D is 100 mbps to 1 gbps, which fits that. But sometimes, the average speeds are lower, like between 10 to 50 Mbps.

Alternatively, I've seen some sources mention that 4G can provide speeds of up to 100 Mbps, but in reality, it's often less. So maybe the correct range is lower than 100 Mbps.

Wait, I think I'm confusing 4G with LTE. LTE is part of 4G, and it's known for higher speeds. So LTE-A (Advanced) can go up to 1 Gbps. So if the question is about 4G in general, including LTE, then D (100 mbps - 1 gbps) could be correct. But if it's just the original 4G without LTE, maybe the speeds are lower.

But the question says "4G network," which I think usually includes LTE as part of its advancements. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, some sources say that 4G can reach up to 1 Gbps, but average speeds are around 10-50 Mbps. So if the question is about the possible range, including the theoretical maximum, then D makes sense. But if it's about typical real-world speeds, maybe I (10-100 mbps) is better.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I is 10 mbps - 100 mbps. That's 0.01 to 0.1 Gbps. So that's a lower range than D. So which is it?

I think the correct answer is D: 100 mbps - 1 gbps. Because the maximum theoretical speed is 1 Gbps, even if the average is lower. So for the question, it's about the possible transmission speed, which can go up to 1 Gbps.
