Question:

Let $A$ and $B$ be independent events with $P(A)=$ 0.7 and $P(B)=0.2$. Compute $P(A \cap B)$.


Options:

A: 0.28
B: 0.9
C: 0.7
D: 0.1
E: 0.56
F: 0.04
G:  0.14
H: 0.5
I: 0.2
J: 0.35

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again. It says that A and B are independent events, with P(A) being 0.7 and P(B) being 0.2. The question is asking me to compute P(A ∩ B), which is the probability that both A and B happen. 

Hmm, right. I remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both happening is just the product of their individual probabilities. So, I think the formula is P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). Let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, independence means that the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other, so multiplying their probabilities should give the joint probability. 

So, plugging in the numbers, P(A) is 0.7 and P(B) is 0.2. Multiplying those together: 0.7 * 0.2. Let me do that calculation. 0.7 times 0.2 is 0.14. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 7 times 2 is 14, and since there's one decimal place in each, that makes two decimal places total, so 0.14. Yep, that's correct. 

Now, I need to look at the options given and see which one matches 0.14. Let me go through them: 

A: 0.28 – That's higher than what I calculated. 

B: 0.9 – Way too high. 

C: 0.7 – That's P(A), not the intersection. 

D: 0.1 – Hmm, that's close but a bit lower. 

E: 0.56 – No, that's much bigger. 

F: 0.04 – That's smaller than my answer. 

G: 0.14 – Yes, that's exactly what I got. 

H: 0.5 – No. 

I: 0.2 – That's P(B). 

J: 0.35 – No, that's not right. 

So, the correct answer must be option G: 0.14. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was remembering the definition of independent events and applying the multiplication rule correctly. Yeah, I'm confident with that.

The probability of both independent events A and B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) = 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14. 

Answer: G
