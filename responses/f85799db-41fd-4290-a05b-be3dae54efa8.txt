Options:

A: laryngeal oedema is not confined to any particular area of the larynx
B: fluid will drain rapidly into the thorax below the vocal folds.
C: there are numerous mucous glands in the vestibular folds.
D: the vocal folds have a protective layer that prevents oedema

Okay, so I've got this question about laryngeal oedema and why it's usually confined above the vocal folds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my larynx anatomy, but let's think this through.

First, laryngeal oedema means swelling in the larynx, right? And oedema is caused by fluid accumulation. The question is why it's mostly above the vocal folds. So, I need to figure out the reason from the options given.

Looking at the options, option B says fluid drains into the thorax below the vocal folds. Wait, if fluid drains there, maybe the area above doesn't swell as much. But I'm not sure how that works. Another option is G, which mentions the mucosa on the vocal folds being tightly attached. If it's tightly attached, maybe it doesn't allow much swelling because the tissue can't expand. That sounds plausible because tight attachment would restrict the space for fluid buildup.

Option H says fewer blood vessels below, which might mean less fluid leakage, but oedema is about fluid in tissues, so maybe not the main reason. Option C talks about mucous glands in the vestibular folds. I'm not sure how that would prevent oedema elsewhere. Option E suggests the lower part is more susceptible, so maybe the upper part isn't, but the question is why it's confined to above.

Option F says the lower mucosa absorbs fluid faster, which might mean it doesn't accumulate. But I'm not certain. Option D mentions a protective layer on the vocal folds. I don't recall that specifically, but maybe the vocal cords themselves are more resistant to swelling.

Wait, I remember that the vocal folds have a layer of epithelial cells that's more tightly adherent to the underlying tissues. This could prevent the fluid from accumulating there. So when oedema occurs, it's more likely to be in areas where the mucosa isn't so tightly attached. Like, above the vocal folds, the mucosa might be looser, so it can swell more. But below, near the vocal cords, it's tight, so the fluid can't accumulate as much.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be option G: the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues. That would explain why oedema is confined above, where the mucosa is less attached, allowing swelling.

The correct answer is G: the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues. This tight attachment prevents fluid accumulation, confining oedema above the vocal folds.

Answer: G
