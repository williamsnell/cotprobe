Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the total cost of mailing a letter overseas. Let me try to break it down step by step because I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

First, the letter weighs 3% ounces. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo? Because 3% ounce doesn't make much sense. Oh, perhaps it's 3 ounces? That would make more sense for a letter with documents. I'll assume it's 3 ounces for now.

The postal rates are 31 cents for each half ounce up to 2 ounces. So, each 0.5 ounces costs 31 cents. Then, for each additional half ounce beyond 2 ounces, it's 26 cents. Plus, there's a registry fee of $2.60 because the letter is worth $225.

Let me figure out how much the postage is. The letter is 3 ounces. Since the first 2 ounces are charged as half-ounce increments, each 0.5 ounces. So, up to 2 ounces, that's 4 half-ounce units (because 2 / 0.5 = 4). Each of those is 31 cents, so 4 * $0.31.

Let me calculate that: 4 * 0.31 = $1.24. So up to 2 ounces, it's $1.24.

Now, the letter is 3 ounces, which is 1 ounce over the 2-ounce limit. Since the rate is per half ounce beyond 2 ounces, I need to see how many half ounces are in the remaining 1 ounce. 1 ounce is 2 half ounces, so 2 * 0.5 ounces.

Each additional half ounce after 2 ounces is 26 cents. So, 2 * $0.26 = $0.52.

So the total postage would be the initial $1.24 plus $0.52 for the extra. That adds up to $1.24 + $0.52 = $1.76.

Then, add the registry fee of $2.60. So total cost is $1.76 + $2.60.

Let me calculate that: 1.76 + 2.60. Hmm, 1 + 2 is 3, 0.76 + 0.60 is 1.36. So 3 + 1.36 = $4.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $4.36. The closest is option E: $4.62, but that's higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the postage. Let me check again. The first 2 ounces are 4 half ounces at 31 cents each: 4 * 0.31 = $1.24. Then, the remaining 1 ounce is 2 half ounces, each at 26 cents: 2 * 0.26 = $0.52. So total postage is $1.24 + $0.52 = $1.76. Then add the registry fee of $2.60: 1.76 + 2.60 = $4.36.

Hmm, but the options don't have $4.36. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says "3% ounce." Could that be 3.5 ounces? Because 3% of an ounce would be 0.03 ounces, which seems too small for a letter with documents. Or maybe it's 3.5 ounces? That would make more sense. Let me try that.

If it's 3.5 ounces, then up to 2 ounces is 4 half ounces, costing $1.24. The remaining 1.5 ounces is 3 half ounces. Each additional half ounce is 26 cents, so 3 * 0.26 = $0.78. So total postage is $1.24 + $0.78 = $2.02. Adding the registry fee of $2.60 gives $2.02 + $2.60 = $4.62.

Ah, that's option E: $4.62. So maybe I misread the weight as 3 ounces instead of 3.5. That would explain the $4.62 which is an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the weight is 3 ounces, but the calculation is different. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: postal rates are 31 cents for each half ounce up to 2 ounces. So for any fraction beyond a half ounce, you round up to the next half ounce. So 3 ounces is 6 half ounces. The first 4 half ounces (up to 2 ounces) cost 31 cents each, so 4 * 0.31 = $1.24. The remaining 2 half ounces (from 2 to 3 ounces) are charged at 26 cents each: 2 * 0.26 = $0.52. Total postage $1.76. Plus registry fee $2.60: $4.36. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the weight is 3.5 ounces. Let's see: 3.5 ounces is 7 half ounces. The first 4 (up to 2 ounces) at 31 cents: $1.24. The next 3 half ounces (1.5 ounces) at 26 cents: 3 * 0.26 = $0.78. So total postage $2.02. Plus $2.60 registry fee: $4.62, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the weight is 3 ounces, but the calculation is done per half ounce without considering the 2-ounce limit. Wait, the problem says 31 cents for each half ounce up to 2 ounces, and then 26 cents for each additional half ounce beyond 2 ounces.

So for 3 ounces, that's 6 half ounces. The first 4 (up to 2 ounces) cost 31 cents each: 4 * 0.31 = $1.24. The remaining 2 half ounces (beyond 2 ounces) cost 26 cents each: 2 * 0.26 = $0.52. So total postage $1.76. Plus registry fee $2.60: $4.36. But that's not an option. So perhaps the weight is 3.5 ounces, leading to $4.62, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the weight is 3 ounces, but the calculation is that any fraction beyond a half ounce is rounded up. So 3 ounces is 6 half ounces. So 4 at 31, 2 at 26: total $1.76. Plus $2.60: $4.36. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, the highest option is A: $6.22, which seems too high. The options are A:6.22, B:4.42, C:5.92, D:5.62, E:4.62, F:5.32, G:4.72, H:3.62, I:3.92, J:3.82.

If the correct total is $4.62, that's E. So perhaps the weight is 3.5 ounces, leading to $4.62.

Alternatively, maybe the weight is 3 ounces, but the postal rates are applied differently. Let me try another approach.

Wait, the problem says "3% ounce." That's confusing. Maybe it's 3.5 ounces, which is 3 and a half ounces. So 3.5 ounces is 7 half ounces. First 4 half ounces (2 ounces) at 31 cents: 4 * 0.31 = $1.24. Remaining 3 half ounces (1.5 ounces) at 26 cents: 3 * 0.26 = $0.78. Postage total $2.02. Add $2.60 registry fee: $4.62, which is E.

Yes, I think that's the correct approach. So the answer should be E: $4.62.

The total cost includes postage and a registry fee. The letter weighs 3.5 ounces, which is 7 half ounces. The first 4 half ounces (up to 2 ounces) cost 31 cents each, totaling $1.24. The remaining 3 half ounces cost 26 cents each, totaling $0.78. Adding the registry fee of $2.60, the total is $4.62.

Answer: E
