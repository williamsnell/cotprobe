Question:

Johnstown Mills manufactures cotton fabrics. Overhead is allocated to each department according to the ratio of total overhead to the total prime cost. During February, total direct labor costs came to $216,000 and the cost of materials to $84,000. The total overhead for the month was $45,000. Find the overhead percent of prime cost to be charged to each department. Then find the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department with a prime cost of $18,500.

Options:

A: 20%, $3,700
B: 22%, $4,070
C: 18%, $3,330
D: 30%, $5,550
E: 10%, $1,850
F: 25%, $4,625
G: 28%, $5,180
H: 15%, $2,775
I: 35%, $6,475
J: 12%, $2,220

Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Johnstown Mills and figure out the overhead percentage and the amount charged to the Design Department. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that overhead is allocated to each department based on the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. So, I think I need to find the overhead percentage first, then use that to find the specific amount for the Design Department.

Looking at the data given:
- Total direct labor costs in February were $216,000.
- The cost of materials was $84,000.
- Total overhead was $45,000.

I remember that prime cost usually includes direct materials and direct labor. So, the total prime cost would be the sum of direct labor and materials. Let me calculate that:

Total Prime Cost = Direct Labor + Materials
Total Prime Cost = $216,000 + $84,000 = $300,000.

Now, the overhead percentage is calculated as (Total Overhead / Total Prime Cost) * 100. So plugging in the numbers:

Overhead Percentage = ($45,000 / $300,000) * 100.

Let me do that math. $45,000 divided by $300,000 equals 0.15. Multiply by 100 gives 15%. So the overhead percentage is 15%.

Now, the second part is finding the amount of overhead to charge to the Design Department, which has a prime cost of $18,500. Since the overhead is allocated based on the same percentage, I can apply the 15% to the Design Department's prime cost.

So, the overhead for Design = 15% of $18,500.

Calculating that: 0.15 * $18,500. Let me compute that. 0.15 times 18,500 equals... Hmm, 18,500 * 0.1 is 1,850, and 18,500 * 0.05 is 925. Adding those together gives 1,850 + 925 = $2,775.

So the overhead percentage is 15%, and the amount for Design is $2,775. Looking back at the options:

H: 15%, $2,775.

That matches exactly. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total Prime Cost: 216k +84k = 300k. Correct. Overhead is 45k. 45/300=0.15, which is 15%. Then 15% of 18,500 is indeed 2,775. Yep, that looks right.

The overhead percentage is calculated by dividing total overhead ($45,000) by total prime cost ($300,000), resulting in 15%. Applying this percentage to the Design Department's prime cost of $18,500 yields an overhead charge of $2,775.

Answer: H
