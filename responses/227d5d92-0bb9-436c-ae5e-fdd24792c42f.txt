Okay, so I need to find the value of p in the equation 24 = 2p. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from algebra that when you have an equation like this, you're trying to solve for the variable, which in this case is p. 

The equation is 24 equals 2 times p. So, to get p by itself, I should do the opposite operation. Since p is being multiplied by 2, I should divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate p. 

Let me write that down. If I take 24 and divide it by 2, that should give me the value of p. So, 24 divided by 2 is... let me calculate that. 24 รท 2 equals 12. So, p must be 12. 

Looking at the options, I see that H is p = 12. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug p = 12 back into the original equation, does it work? Let's see: 2 times 12 is 24, which matches the left side of the equation. Yep, that makes sense. 

I don't think I made any errors here. It's a straightforward division problem. So, the answer should definitely be H.

The equation 24 = 2p can be solved by dividing both sides by 2. 24 รท 2 = 12, so p = 12. 

Answer: H
