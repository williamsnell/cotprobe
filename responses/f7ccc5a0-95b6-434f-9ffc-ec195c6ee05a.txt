Alright, I need to figure out how 4:00 pm is expressed in military time. I remember that military time, also known as 24-hour time, goes from 00:00 to 23:59. So, it's different from the 12-hour clock we usually use.

In the 12-hour format, the hours go from 1 to 12, and then they repeat. But in military time, after 12:00 comes 13:00, then 14:00, and so on until 23:59, which is just before midnight. So, for times in the afternoon, like 4:00 pm, I think we add 12 hours to the 12-hour time.

Wait, let me think. If it's 4:00 pm, that's 4 o'clock in the afternoon. So, in military terms, that would be 1600 hours. Because 4 plus 12 is 16. So, 4:00 pm becomes 16:00 in 24-hour format.

Looking at the options, option H is 16:00, which matches. Option A is 1600, which is the same as 16:00 without the colon. I think both are correct, but in the options, H and A are similar but formatted differently. Wait, the question is about how it's expressed. Typically, military time is written with the colon, like 16:00, so H would be the correct choice.

But let me check the other options to be sure. Option B is 1400, which would be 2 pm, right? Because 14 minus 12 is 2. So that's not it. Option E is 400, which would be 4 am, because 400 is 4:00 in 24-hour, which is morning. Option F is 4:00 pm, that's the same as the original time, not military. Option G is 0400, which is 4 am. J is 2400, which is midnight. So none of those fit.

So the correct answer should be H:16:00.

The correct answer is H:16:00.
