Question:

A heavy object can sink into the ground during an earthquake if the shaking causes the ground to undergo liquefaction, in which the soil grains experience little friction as they slide over one another. The ground is then effectively quicksand. The possibility of liquefaction in sandy ground can be predicted in terms of the void ratio $e$ for a sample of the ground:
$$
e=\frac{V_{\text {voids }}}{V_{\text {grains }}} .
$$
Here, $V_{\text {grains }}$ is the total volume of the sand grains in the sample and $V_{\text {voids }}$ is the total volume between the grains (in the voids). If $e$ exceeds a critical value of 0.80 , liquefaction can occur during an earthquake. What is the corresponding sand density $\rho_{\text {sand }}$ ? Solid silicon dioxide (the primary component of sand) has a density of $\rho_{\mathrm{SiO}_2}=2.600 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$.

Options:

A: 1.4 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
B: 1.2 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
C: 3.0 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
D: 1.6 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
E: 2.4 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
F: 1.8 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
G: 2.8 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
H: 2.2 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
I: 1.0 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
J: 2.6 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about liquefaction during an earthquake. The question is asking about the density of sand when the void ratio e exceeds 0.80. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the concepts. Liquefaction happens when the ground shakes so much that the soil behaves like quicksand. The void ratio e is the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of the grains. So, e = V_voids / V_grains. If e is greater than 0.80, liquefaction can occur.

The problem gives the density of solid silicon dioxide (which makes up the sand) as 2600 kg/m³. I need to find the sand density when e is 0.80. Sand density would be the mass of the sand divided by the total volume (grains plus voids).

Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that density is mass over volume. The mass of the sand comes from the grains, since the voids are just empty space. So, the total mass is the same as the mass of the grains.

Let's denote:
- V_grains as the volume of the sand grains.
- V_voids as the volume of the voids between the grains.
- The total volume V_total = V_grains + V_voids.
- The void ratio e = V_voids / V_grains = 0.80.

So, from e = 0.80, I can express V_voids as 0.80 * V_grains. Therefore, the total volume V_total = V_grains + 0.80 * V_grains = 1.80 * V_grains.

Now, the mass of the sand is the density of SiO2 multiplied by the volume of the grains. So, mass = rho_SiO2 * V_grains. The sand density rho_sand is mass divided by V_total.

Putting it together:
rho_sand = (rho_SiO2 * V_grains) / V_total
But V_total is 1.80 * V_grains, so substituting that in:
rho_sand = (rho_SiO2 * V_grains) / (1.80 * V_grains)
The V_grains cancels out, leaving:
rho_sand = rho_SiO2 / 1.80

So, plugging in the numbers:
rho_SiO2 is 2600 kg/m³, so:
rho_sand = 2600 / 1.8

Let me calculate that. 2600 divided by 1.8. Hmm, 1.8 times 1444 is about 2600, because 1444 * 1.8 = 2600 (since 1400 *1.8 is 2520, and 44*1.8 is 79.2, so 2520+79.2=2599.2). But wait, let me check: 1.8 * 1444.444... equals 2600 exactly. So, 2600 / 1.8 is approximately 1444.44 kg/m³.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.4 x10^3 kg/m³, which is 1400 kg/m³. But wait, 1444 is closer to 1400 than to 1.6 x10^3, which is 1600. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the void ratio e is Vv/Vs, where Vv is the void volume and Vs is the solid volume. So, e = Vv/Vs = 0.80. That means Vv = 0.8 * Vs. The total volume Vt = Vs + Vv = Vs + 0.8 Vs = 1.8 Vs.

The mass of the sand is just the mass of the solids, which is rho_SiO2 * Vs.

So, the sand density rho_sand = mass / Vt = (rho_SiO2 * Vs) / Vt = (rho_SiO2 * Vs) / (1.8 Vs) )= rho_SiO2 / 1.8.

So, 2600 / 1.8 is approximately 1444.44 kg/m³. The closest option is A: 1.4e3, which is 1400 kg/m³. But wait, 1444 is 1.444e3, which is between 1.4 and 1.6. The options don't have 1.44e3, but option A is 1.4, which is 1400, and option B is 1.2, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I did a calculation error. Let me compute 2600 / 1.8 again.

1.8 is 9/5, so 2600 * 5/9 = (2600 *5)/9 = 13000 /9 ≈ 1444.44 kg/m³.

So, that's about 1444 kg/m³. The options don't have that, but the closest higher option is A:1.4e3 (1400), which is 1444 rounded down. Alternatively, perhaps the options are approximations, so maybe 1.4e3 is the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of porosity instead. But no, the problem defines e as the void ratio, not porosity. Porosity n is Vv/Vt, whereas e is Vv/Vs. So, for void ratio e = 0.8, Vv =0.8 Vs, so n = Vv/(Vs+Vv) = 0.8/(1.8) ≈ 0.444. But that's not directly needed here.

Wait, maybe another approach. The sand density is (rho_SiO2 * Vs) / Vt. Since Vt=1.8 Vs, as before. So, it's 2600 /1.8 ≈ 1444 kg/m³.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:1.4e3, which is 1400. Alternatively, perhaps the options are approximations. But wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 1.4e3, which is 1400, and option B is 1.2e3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again: sand density is mass divided by total volume. Mass is rho_SiO2 * Vs. Total volume is Vs + Vv = Vs + e * Vs = Vs (1 + e). So, rho_sand = (rho_SiO2 * Vs) / (Vs (1+e)) = rho_SiO2 / (1+e).

Wait, wait a second! That's different from before. Oh no, I think I messed up earlier. Because e is Vv/Vs =0.8, so Vv=0.8 Vs. So total volume Vt= Vs + Vv = Vs +0.8 Vs =1.8 Vs.

Wait, so in that case, rho_sand = (rho_SiO2 * Vs) / Vt = (2600 * Vs) / (1.8 Vs) )= 2600 /1.8 ≈1444 kg/m³. So, that's correct.

But looking at the options again, the closest is option A: 1.4e3, but that would be 1400, which is 44 less than 1444. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another approach: Maybe the formula is rho_sand = (rho_SiO2) / (1 + e). Because:

rho_sand = (mass) / Vt = (rho_SiO2 * Vs) / (Vs + Vv) = (rho_SiO2 * Vs) / (Vs (1 + e)) )= rho_SiO2 / (1 + e).

Wait, but e is Vv/Vs, so Vv = e Vs. So, Vt = Vs + e Vs = Vs (1+e). So, rho_sand= rho_SiO2 * Vs / [Vs (1+e)] = rho_SiO2/(1+e).

Wait, but that would be if e is the void ratio. So, for e=0.8, rho_sand=2600/(1+0.8)=2600/1.8≈1444 kg/m³.

So, that's the same result as before. So, the sand density is approximately 1444 kg/m³.

Looking back at the options, the options are:

A: 1.4e3 → 1400

B: 1.2e3 → 1200

C:3.0e3 →3000

D:1.6e3 →1600

E:2.4e3 →2400

F:1.8e3 →1800

G:2.8e3 →2800

H:2.2e3 →2200

I:1.0e3 →1000

J:2.6e3 →2600

So, 1444 is closest to option A:1400, but perhaps the options are approximations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to express 1444 in terms of 10^3. So, 1444 kg/m³ is 1.444 x10^3 kg/m³. So, the option A is 1.4 x10^3, which is 1400. So that's the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1440, which would round to 1.4x10^3.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation: 2600 divided by 1.8. Let me compute it step by step.

1.8 * 1400 = 2520.

2600 -2520=80.

So, 80 divided by 1.8 is approximately 44.44.

So, 1400 +44.44=1444.44.

So, the correct value is approximately 1444.44 kg/m³, which is 1.444 x10^3. The options don't have this, but the closest is A:1.4e3.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 2.6e3, which is the same as rho_SiO2. That would make sense if the sand was 100% solid, but that's not the case here because e=0.8 implies a lot of voids.

Another way to think: if e=0, the sand is completely solid, so density would be 2600 kg/m³. As e increases, the density decreases because there's more void space.

At e=0.8, the density is lower than 2600, which matches our calculation of 1444, which is less than 2600.

So, the correct answer is around 1444, which isn't exactly an option, but the closest is A:1.4e3.

To determine the sand density when the void ratio \( e \) exceeds 0.80, we start by understanding the relationship between the void ratio, total volume, and density. The void ratio \( e \) is defined as:

\[
e = \frac{V_{\text{voids}}}{V_{\text{grains}}}
\]

Given \( e = 0.80 \), we can express the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) as:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{grains}} + V_{\text{voids}} = V_{\text{grains}} + 0.80 \cdot V_{\text{grains}} = 1.80 \cdot V_{\text{grains}}
\]

The mass of the sand is equal to the mass of the grains, which is:

\[
\text{Mass} = \rho_{\text{SiO}_2} \cdot V_{\text{grains}}
\]

The sand density \( \rho_{\text{sand}} \) is then:

\[
\rho_{\text{sand}} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{SiO}_2} \cdot V_{\text{grains}}}{1.80 \cdot V_{\text{grains}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{SiO}_2}}{1.80}
\]

Substituting \( \rho_{\text{SiO}_2} = 2600 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \):

\[
\rho_{\text{sand}} = \frac{2600}{1.80} \approx 1444.44 \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \( 1444.44 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) is \( 1.4 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), which corresponds to option A.
