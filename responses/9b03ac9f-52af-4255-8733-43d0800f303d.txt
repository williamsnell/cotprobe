Question:

A woman was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?

Options:

A: No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.
B: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.
C: Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.
D: Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically dealing with personal injury and lost earning capacity. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a woman who was hit in the right eye by glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, had several operations over years, and can't return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, headaches, and disfigurement. She's considered totally disabled. She had been training for ballet for many years and at trial, she proved she was a bright and upcoming student. The defendant argued that it was too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court allowed evidence on her lost earning capacity as a ballet dancer, and the jury awarded $3 million. The question is whether the appellate court will reverse the verdict because of the lost earning capacity issue.

The options are A through D, each giving a different reason for why the appellate court might or might not reverse.

First, I need to recall the legal principles regarding lost earning capacity. Lost earning capacity is a type of damages awarded in personal injury cases to compensate for the loss of future earnings due to the injury. The key issue here is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the award.

In general, to recover for lost earning capacity, the plaintiff must show that the injury diminished their ability to earn money in the future. The evidence must be sufficient to establish a reasonable probability that the plaintiff would have earned more but for the injury. It doesn't have to be certain; some uncertainty is allowed as long as there's a reasonable basis for the expectation.

In this case, the woman was an apprentice ballet dancer training for many years. She was considered bright and upcoming. The defendant argued that her success wasn't certain, making the evidence too speculative. The trial court allowed the evidence, and the jury awarded $3 million.

So, the appellate court will look at whether the evidence was sufficient. The defendant's main argument is that her future success as a professional dancer was too speculative. But courts generally allow for some uncertainty. For example, in the past, cases have allowed damages for lost earning capacity even if the plaintiff's future career wasn't guaranteed. The idea is that the injury took away the opportunity, and the plaintiff should be compensated based on the potential they had.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate. This might be correct because juries have discretion in awarding damages, but I think the appellate court can overturn if the evidence was legally insufficient, not just because of discretion.

Option B states that some imprecision in evidence is expected and not grounds for exclusion. This seems to align with the principle that some uncertainty is acceptable. So the appellate court might not reverse because the evidence, despite being imprecise, was still admissible.

Option C argues that evidence didn't guarantee success, so the appellate court should reverse. But as I thought earlier, it's not about guaranteeing success; it's about whether there was a reasonable expectation. So this might not be the correct reasoning.

Option D says she can only collect for prior work, not future. But she was an apprentice, so her future earnings as a professional were part of her potential. The court usually allows recovery for future lost earning capacity if it's supported.

So, the likely correct answer is B. The appellate court won't reverse because some imprecision is acceptable, and the trial court correctly admitted the evidence on lost earning capacity.

The appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict because some imprecision in evidence regarding lost earning capacity is acceptable and not grounds for excluding it. The trial court correctly allowed evidence of her potential as a ballet dancer, and the jury's award reflects the reasonable expectation of her future earnings. 

Answer: B
