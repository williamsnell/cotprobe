Question:

A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have "caught the same bug." Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?

Options:

A: Administer a tetanus shot
B: Prescribe azithromycin
C: Administer the meningococcal vaccine
D: Prescribe ibuprofen
E: Prescribe penicillin
F: Administer the pneumococcal vaccine
G: Prescribe amoxicillin
H: Prescribe doxycycline
I: Prescribe rifampin
J: No intervention is needed at this time

Okay, so I have this question about a 16-year-old girl who's worried she might have meningitis because her teammate had meningococcal meningitis. Let's break this down.

First, the patient feels well, which is important. Her vital signs are slightly elevated in temperature but otherwise normal. Physical exam shows no issues, so she doesn't have symptoms pointing to meningitis right now.

Meningococcal meningitis is caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. It's contagious and can spread through close contact, like sharing a room in a hotel. But if the patient isn't showing symptoms, should she be treated?

Looking at the options: 

Option A is a tetanus shot. Tetanus is from Clostridium tetani, not related here. So probably not.

Options B, E, G, H, I are antibiotics. But if she's asymptomatic, antibiotics aren't usually given unless there's exposure and risk of infection. Prophylaxis is sometimes recommended for close contacts, but it depends on the situation.

Option C is the meningococcal vaccine. If she hasn't been vaccinated, maybe, but the question is about immediate intervention. Plus, vaccines don't treat current infections.

Option F is the pneumococcal vaccine. That's for Streptococcus pneumoniae, not Neisseria, so probably not relevant here.

Option J says no intervention. Since she's well, maybe that's the case.

Wait, but close contacts of meningococcal cases are often given prophylaxis. So why isn't that an option? Looking at the options, I don't see any antibiotics listed as prophylaxis. The options given for antibiotics are for treatment, not prophylaxis.

Wait, the options include E (penicillin), which treats bacterial infections, but if she doesn't have symptoms, penicillin isn't needed. Similarly, amoxicillin (G) is another antibiotic for treatment. Rifampin (I) is sometimes used for prophylaxis, like for TB or meningococcal. Oh, wait, rifampin is an option. So why isn't that the choice?

Wait, the question is about the most appropriate intervention. If she's asymptomatic, the standard approach is to give prophylactic antibiotics to close contacts. Rifampin is one such option. Alternatively, sometimes ciprofloxacin or others are used. But looking at the options, I is rifampin.

But let me think again. The girl's teammate was hospitalized yesterday after being at a tournament a week ago. The patient shared a hotel room. So she was exposed. But she's asymptomatic now. So prophylaxis is indicated.

Looking back at the options, I is rifampin. So that would be the intervention. But wait, some places use amoxicillin or other antibiotics. Hmm. Alternatively, if she's not vaccinated, the vaccine (option C) would help prevent future infections, but it's a longer-term prevention, not immediate.

But the question is about the most appropriate intervention now. Administering antibiotics as prophylaxis is the immediate step. So option I: prescribe rifampin.

Wait, but the answer options don't have I as correct? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Tetanus

B: Azithromycin

C: Meningococcal vaccine

D: Ibuprofen

E: Penicillin

F: Pneumococcal

G: Amoxicillin

H: Doxycycline

I: Rifampin

J: No intervention.

In clinical practice, close contacts of meningococcal cases are given antibiotics prophylaxis. The usual drugs include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or sometimes amoxicillin if the strain is susceptible. Since the options have rifampin (I) and amoxicillin (G), which is better?

Wait, the girl has asthma and uses inhaled albuterol. Rifampin is generally well-tolerated, but amoxicillin can cause allergic reactions, though less so. But without knowing her penicillin allergy status, it's hard to say. Alternatively, in the US, prophylaxis is often ciprofloxacin or rifampin. So I would think rifampin is the option here.

But wait, the answer might be J: no intervention. Because she's asymptomatic and maybe the risk is low without symptoms. But guidelines say close contacts should receive prophylaxis to prevent possible infection.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. If she's asymptomatic, but exposed, the standard is prophylaxis. So the correct answer should be I: rifampin.

But the initial thought was J, but that might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the answer is J because she's not showing signs and the risk is low without symptoms. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The girl is well, no symptoms. The question is about intervention now. Prophylaxis is standard for close contacts, so rifampin (I) would be the answer. But if the options don't have that, but in this case, I is an option.

But wait, looking at the initial question, the correct answer is J: no intervention is needed because she's asymptomatic and probably doesn't need antibiotics yet. Or does she?

I think I might be overcomplicating. In practice, asymptomatic contacts are given prophylactic antibiotics. So the answer should be I: rifampin.

Wait, but the options don't have I as the correct answer if the intended answer is J. Alternatively, maybe the answer is J because she's not showing symptoms, and they'll monitor her. But that depends on the guidelines.

Wait, the girl's teammate was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. The patient is a close contact. So the standard is to give prophylaxis. So the correct answer is I: rifampin.
</think>

The patient is a 16-year-old girl who is asymptomatic but was exposed to meningococcal meningitis through close contact with a teammate who was hospitalized. Given her asymptomatic state, the most appropriate intervention is to administer prophylactic antibiotics to prevent potential infection. Rifampin is a commonly used prophylactic agent in such cases. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: Prescribe rifampin

The final answer is I.
