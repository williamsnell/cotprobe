Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating horsepower required to drive a load. Let me see what I remember from physics class. The question says that a load needs to be driven at 1750 revolutions per minute (r/min) and it requires a torque of 60 lb-ft. I need to find out how much horsepower that would be.

Hmm, I think horsepower is a unit of power, right? And power can be calculated using torque and angular velocity. Wait, torque is in lb-ft, and angular velocity is in r/min. I remember there's a formula that connects these to power in horsepower.

I think the formula is something like Power (in hp) equals torque multiplied by angular velocity, divided by some constant. Let me try to recall the exact formula. I believe it's Power = (Torque × Speed) / 5252. Yeah, that sounds right. Because I remember the 5252 number comes from converting units, maybe from lb-ft and r/min to horsepower.

So plugging in the numbers, the torque is 60 lb-ft, and the speed is 1750 r/min. Let me write that out: Power = (60 × 1750) / 5252. Let me calculate that step by step.

First, multiply 60 by 1750. 60 times 1700 is 102,000, and 60 times 50 is 3,000, so together that's 105,000. So the numerator is 105,000.

Now, divide that by 5252. Let me do that division. 5252 goes into 105,000 how many times? Let's see, 5252 × 20 is 105,040. Wait, that's a bit more than 105,000. So maybe it's just under 20. Let me check: 5252 × 19.99 is approximately 105,000. So the power is about 19.99, which is roughly 20 hp.

Looking at the options, B is 20 hp. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

60 multiplied by 1750 is indeed 105,000. Then dividing by 5252: 105,000 ÷ 5252 equals approximately 20. So yeah, 20 hp is correct.

To determine the horsepower required, use the formula:  
Power (hp) = (Torque × Speed) / 5252  

Given:  
Torque = 60 lb-ft  
Speed = 1750 r/min  

Power = (60 × 1750) / 5252 ≈ 20 hp  

The closest option is **B: 20 hp**.

Answer: B
