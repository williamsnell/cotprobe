Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas. During this process, the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. The question is asking about the heat transfer during this process. The options are from A to J, each describing different amounts of heat added or removed.

First, I remember that in thermodynamics, there are some key concepts related to work and heat, especially in processes involving ideal gases. I think the first law of thermodynamics is relevant here. The first law states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) plus the work done on the system (W). The formula is ΔU = Q + W. Wait, no, I think sometimes the sign conventions can be tricky. Let me get that right.

Oh right, the formula is often written as ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work, it's losing energy, which would subtract from the internal energy. But wait, in this case, the process is isothermal, so the internal energy change should be zero because the temperature is constant.

Wait, is that right? For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. So if the process is isothermal, ΔU equals zero. That makes sense because the temperature doesn't change.

So, since ΔU is zero, the first law simplifies to 0 = Q - W. Rearranging that, Q = W. But wait, W is the work done by the system. In this case, the gas is expanding and doing work on the surroundings. So W is positive, meaning the system is losing energy as work.

So if W is 150 J (the work done by the gas), then Q must be 150 J. But wait, because in the formula, Q is the heat added to the system. So if W is positive (work done by the system), then Q must be positive as well because Q = W. That means heat is being added to the system to compensate for the work done.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. If the system is doing work (expanding), it's losing internal energy. But since the process is isothermal, the internal energy doesn't change, so the heat must be entering the system to replace the energy lost as work. So the heat Q must be positive, meaning heat is added.

So the heat added to the gas is equal to the work done by the gas, which is 150 J. So looking at the options, option A says 150 J of heat was added. That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not getting the signs mixed up. The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system does 150 J of work, W = +150 J. Since ΔU is zero, Q must be +150 J. So heat is added to the system.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen the formula written with work done on the system as positive. So maybe I should double-check that. Let me clarify the sign conventions.

In the first law, work done by the system is considered negative in some conventions because it's energy leaving the system. Wait, no, that's conflicting. I think the confusion arises from different sign conventions used by different textbooks. Let me think again.

In the formula ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. So if the system does work, W is negative. So in this case, the system does 150 J of work, so W = -150 J. Since ΔU is zero, 0 = Q + (-150), so Q = +150 J. So again, heat is added to the system, which is 150 J. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, in another convention, it's written as ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So here, W is +150 J. So 0 = Q - 150, so Q = +150 J. Either way, the conclusion is the same: 150 J of heat is added.

So the correct answer should be option A: 150 J of heat was added to the gas.

During an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the internal energy change (ΔU) is zero because the temperature remains constant. According to the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W, where Q is the heat added to the system and W is the work done by the system. Since ΔU = 0, we have Q = W. The gas does 150 J of work, so Q = +150 J, indicating that 150 J of heat is added to the gas.
