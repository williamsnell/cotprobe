Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of calculations. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is: How many grains of sulfuric acid are contained in 3.00 liters of 0.500 N solution? They also give the molecular weight (MW) of H₂SO₄ as 98.1. The options are A through J, with various grams listed.

Wait, wait. I remember that "grains" is a term sometimes used in pharmacy and chemistry, but I'm not entirely sure how it's used here. I think grains refer to grams, but maybe it's a different unit. Oh, wait, I think in pharmacy, a grain is 65 mg, but in this context, since the options are in grams, maybe grains here just mean grams. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and they meant grams, but I'll proceed assuming it's grams since the options are in grams.

So, the problem is to find the mass of H₂SO₄ in 3 liters of 0.500 N solution. Let me break it down.

First, I know that normality (N) is used for solutions of acids and bases. Normality is defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solution. For sulfuric acid, H₂SO₄, each mole provides 2 equivalents because it can donate two H+ ions. So, the formula for normality is:

Normality (N) = (Molarity × Valence Factor)  
But wait, since we have normality and we need to find the number of moles, maybe I should approach it differently.

The formula I remember is:

Mass of solute = Normality × Volume × Molar Mass / (n × Normality factor?)

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think in terms of equivalents first.

1 equivalent of H₂SO₄ is 1 mole of H₂SO₄ divided by the number of H+ ions it can provide. Since H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, it can donate 2 H+ ions. So, 1 mole of H₂SO₄ gives 2 equivalents.

So, the formula connecting normality, volume, and mass is:

Mass = (Normality × Volume × Molar Mass) / (n)

Wait, where n is the number of H+ ions, which is 2 in this case. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.

The formula I think is:

Mass = Normality × Volume × Molar Mass / (equivalents per mole)

So, for H₂SO₄, the equivalents per mole are 2.

So, Mass = N × V × (Molar Mass) / 2

Wait, let me make sure. Because normality is equivalents per liter, so:

Equivalents = Normality × Volume (in liters)

Mass = Equivalents × Molar Mass / (equivalents per mole)

Wait, no, more accurately, Equivalents = moles × valence factor. So, for H₂SO₄, each mole gives 2 equivalents.

So, Equivalents = Normality × Volume

And moles = Equivalents / 2

Then, mass = moles × molar mass.

So, putting it together:

Mass = (Normality × Volume) / 2 × Molar Mass

Yes, that makes sense.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Normality (N) = 0.500 N  
Volume (V) = 3.00 liters  
Molar Mass (MM) = 98.1 g/mol

So,

Equivalents = 0.500 N × 3.00 L = 1.5 equivalents  
Moles = 1.5 equivalents / 2 = 0.75 moles  
Mass = 0.75 moles × 98.1 g/mol = ?

Let me calculate that.

0.75 × 98.1 = ?

Let me compute 0.75 × 98.1:

First, 98 × 0.75 = 73.5  
0.1 × 0.75 = 0.075  
So, total is 73.5 + 0.075 = 73.575 grams.

Looking at the options, option H is 73.5 g. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with sulfuric acid, it's important to note whether it's fully dissociated, but I think for the purposes of normality calculations, we assume it's a strong acid and fully dissociates, so each mole gives two equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the number of equivalents first.

Equivalents = N × V = 0.500 × 3.00 = 1.5 eq.

Each mole of H₂SO₄ is 98.1 g and provides 2 equivalents. So, moles = equivalents / 2 = 1.5 / 2 = 0.75 moles.

Mass = 0.75 × 98.1 = 73.575 g, which rounds to 73.5 g. So option H.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in 3.00 liters of a 0.500 N solution. Normality (N) represents equivalents per liter, and since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, each mole provides 2 equivalents. 

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Mass} = \frac{\text{Normality} \times \text{Volume} \times \text{Molar Mass}}{\text{Equivalents per mole}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Mass} = \frac{0.500 \times 3.00 \times 98.1}{2} = 73.5 \, \text{g}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: 73.5 g
