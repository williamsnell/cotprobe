Question:

The midterm scores for a statistics course were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. The final exam scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. One student had a score of 58 points on the midterm. If she had the same standardized score (z-score) on the final exam, what must her score have been?

Options:

A: 127 points
B: 58 points
C: 132 points
D: 102 points
E: 92 points
F: 122 points
G: 15 points
H: 118 points
I: 112 points
J: 142 points

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that the midterm scores for a stats course are approximately normally distributed. The mean is 52 points, and the standard deviation is 4 points. Then, the final exam scores are also normally distributed, but with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. There's a student who scored 58 on the midterm, and we're told she had the same z-score on the final exam. The question is asking what her final exam score must have been. The options are A through J, with various points.

Hmm, so I remember that a z-score tells us how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula for z-score is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

So first, I think I need to calculate the z-score for her midterm. She scored 58, and the midterm mean is 52 with a standard deviation of 4.

Let me plug those numbers into the formula: (58 - 52) / 4. That equals 6 / 4, which is 1.5. So her z-score is 1.5.

Now, since her final exam has the same z-score, her final exam score must correspond to a z-score of 1.5 as well. The final exam has a mean of 112 and a standard deviation of 10.

So I need to find the X that gives a z-score of 1.5 for the final. Using the z-score formula again, rearranged to solve for X: X = μ + z*σ.

Plugging in the numbers: X = 112 + (1.5 * 10). 1.5 times 10 is 15, so X is 112 + 15, which equals 127.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 127. That must be the answer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Midterm z-score: (58-52)/4 = 6/4 = 1.5. Correct.

Final exam: X = 112 + 1.5*10 = 112 +15 =127. Yep, that's right. So the correct answer should be A:127 points.

The student's z-score on the midterm is calculated as (58 - 52) / 4 = 1.5. Using this z-score for the final exam, the score is 112 + (1.5 * 10) = 127. 

Answer: A
