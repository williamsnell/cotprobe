Okay, so I have this question about the Oral Torah and its written form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Jewish texts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the Oral Torah is sometimes called the Torah Sheb'al Peh, right? That's the oral part that was passed down and then written down later.

The question is asking what it's called in its written form. I remember that the written form might be a specific term. The options are A through J, including things like Mishnah, Talmud, etc.

Wait, the Oral Torah was compiled into a written form. I think the Mishnah is the primary text of the Oral Torah. The Mishnah is actually the first major work of Rabbinic Judaism, written around 200 CE by Rabbi Judah the Prince. It's a collection of rabbinic decisions on the Torah, and it's part of the Talmud, which includes both the Mishnah and the Gemara.

So, the Mishnah is the written version of the Oral Torah. Let me check the options again. Option A is Mishnah, which seems right. Option C is Talmud, but that's a larger work combining Mishnah and Gemara. Option E is Gemara, which is the commentary and analysis part of the Talmud, not the written Oral Torah itself.

Other options like Tanakh (B) is the Hebrew Bible, so that's not it. Pentateuch (D) is just the first five books of the Torah, not related to the Oral part. Zohar (F) is a Kabbalistic text, not the Oral Torah. Ketuvim (G) is one of the sections of the Tanakh, like Writings. Midrash (H) are interpretations, but not the written form of the Oral Torah. Torah Shebichtav (I) is the Written Torah, so that's the opposite of what we're looking for. Nevi'im (J) are the Prophets in the Tanakh.

So yeah, the answer must be A: Mishnah.
