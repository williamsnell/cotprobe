Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The reaction is H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI. Initially, they introduce 1 mole of H₂ and 3 moles of I₂ into a flask. Then, x moles of HI are formed. After that, they add 2 more moles of H₂, and the amount of HI formed becomes 2x. The question is to find K_p, the equilibrium constant in terms of pressure.

Hmm, I think I need to use the ICE table method here. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. Let me start by setting up the first scenario.

First case:
Initial moles:
H₂: 1
I₂: 3
HI: 0

Change:
H₂ and I₂ react to form HI. Let's say the change is -a for H₂ and I₂, and +2a for HI. But wait, the problem says x moles of HI are formed, so 2a = x → a = x/2.

So, after reaction:
H₂: 1 - a = 1 - x/2
I₂: 3 - a = 3 - x/2
HI: 0 + 2a = x

Wait, but wait, I think I should write the equilibrium expressions correctly. Let me think again.

At equilibrium for the first case:
[H₂] = (1 - a)
[I₂] = (3 - a)
[HI] = 2a = x → a = x/2.

Wait, no, because initial moles are 1 H₂ and 3 I₂. So, when a moles of H₂ and I₂ react, they produce 2a moles of HI. So, yes, a = x/2. So, H₂ becomes 1 - a = 1 - x/2, I₂ becomes 3 - a = 3 - x/2, and HI is x.

The equilibrium constant K_p is given by (P_HI)^2 / (P_H2 * P_I2).

But since we're dealing with moles and volume, pressure is proportional to moles, assuming temperature is constant. So maybe I can work with mole fractions or concentrations as partial pressures.

Wait, but wait. The problem doesn't specify the volume, but I think because the volume is the same in both cases, the partial pressures will be proportional to the moles.

But wait, after adding more H₂, the total moles change, so the concentrations change. Let me think.

Wait, the first part is the initial situation before adding more H₂. Let me write K_p for the first case.

K_p (first case) = ( (x)^2 ) / [ (1 - x/2) * (3 - x/2) ) ]

Wait, no, because pressure is proportional to moles. So the partial pressures would be (moles of each) divided by the total moles, multiplied by the total pressure. But since K_p is a ratio, maybe the total pressure cancels out. Alternatively, since the volume is fixed, perhaps it's easier to use mole fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the partial pressures in terms of the total pressure, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to assume that the partial pressures are proportional to the mole fractions, given the same volume and temperature.

Wait, but let's not overcomplicate. Let's model the first case.

First case:
Moles after reaction:
H₂: 1 - a
I₂: 3 - a
HI: x = 2a → a = x/2

So, H₂: 1 - x/2
I₂: 3 - x/2
HI: x

Total moles in first case: (1 - x/2) + (3 - x/2) + x = 1 +3 + x - x/2 -x/2 +x → wait, let me calculate:

1 - x/2 + 3 - x/2 + x = (1 +3) + (-x/2 -x/2 +x) → 4 + (-x +x) → 4. Oh, wait, that's interesting. The total moles are 4. So each partial pressure is (moles) / 4 * P_total. But since K_p is a ratio, the P_total might cancel out. Let me think.

But perhaps I should express the partial pressures as:

PH2 = (1 - x/2)/4 * P_total
PI2 = (3 - x/2)/4 * P_total
PHI = x/4 * P_total

But when I plug into K_p, which is (PHI^2)/(PH2 * PI2), the P_total^2 in numerator and P_total^2 in denominator would cancel, so K_p would be (x^2 / 16) / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) / 16 ) ]

Wait, let me compute that:

K_p = ( (x/4 * P_total)^2 ) / [ ( (1 - x/2)/4 P_total ) * ( (3 - x/2)/4 P_total ) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (x² / 16) P_total²
Denominator: [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) / 16 ) ] P_total²

So K_p = (x² / 16) / ( (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) / 16 ) ) = x² / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) )

So K_p (first case) = x² / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) ]

Now, the second case: they add 2 more moles of H₂. So initial moles before reaction in second case are:

H₂: (1 - x/2) + 2 = 3 - x/2
I₂: 3 - x/2
HI: x

Wait, no. Wait, in the second case, they add 2 more moles of H₂, so initial moles for the second case are:

H₂: (1 - x/2) + 2 = 3 - x/2
I₂: (3 - x/2)
HI: x

Wait, but if we add 2 moles of H₂, the initial moles before reaction in the second case would be:

H₂: 1 + 2 = 3 (but wait, in the first case, after reaction, H₂ was 1 - x/2. So when we add 2 more moles of H₂, the new initial H₂ is (1 - x/2) + 2 = 3 - x/2.

I₂ remains at 3 - x/2 (because in the first case, I₂ was 3 - x/2, and no I₂ was added or removed).

HI is x, as the initial in the second case (maybe they didn't remove any HI, just added H₂).

Wait, but the problem says that after adding 2 more moles of H₂, the amount of HI formed is 2x. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So in the second case, when they add 2 moles of H₂, the reaction proceeds again, and the amount of HI formed is 2x. So perhaps the total HI is x + 2x = 3x? Or is 2x the new amount? Wait, the problem says "the amount of HI formed is found to be 2x." Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, maybe in the first case, x moles of HI are formed from the initial 1 mole H₂ and 3 I₂. Then, when 2 more moles of H₂ are added, the system re-establishes equilibrium, and the amount of HI formed is 2x. So perhaps in the second case, the new equilibrium has 2x moles of HI.

Wait, but that might not make sense, because adding more H₂ would shift the equilibrium towards the products, so more HI would form. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, in the first case, initial moles H₂=1, I₂=3, HI=0.

In the second case, after adding 2 H₂, initial moles are H₂=3, I₂=3, HI=x. Then, the system will shift to form more HI, but the problem says that the amount of HI formed is 2x. So maybe the new equilibrium has HI = x + 2x = 3x? Or perhaps it's 2x in total. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should model the second case as an initial change, then find the shift.

In the second case:

Initial moles before reaction:
H₂: 3 (because 1 + 2 added)
I₂: 3 (same as before)
HI: x

Wait, but no, because in the first case, after reaction, the moles were H₂=1 - a, I₂=3 - a, HI=x. So when adding 2 more H₂, the new initial moles are H₂ = (1 - a) + 2 = 3 - a.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model the second case as a separate ICE table.

Second case:

Initial moles after adding 2 H₂:
H₂: (1 - a) + 2 = 3 - a
I₂: 3 - a
HI: x

Now, when the system reaches equilibrium again, let's say it shifts by b. So H₂ and I₂ will react to form more HI.

Change:
H₂: -b
I₂: -b
HI: +2b

So equilibrium moles in second case:

H₂: (3 - a) - b
I₂: (3 - a) - b
HI: x + 2b

But the problem states that the amount of HI formed is 2x. Wait, does that mean that the total HI is 2x, or that the change is 2x? I think it's the latter; that the amount formed is 2x, meaning 2x moles of HI are formed in the second case. So perhaps 2b = 2x → b = x.

Wait, but that would mean that the change in HI is 2x, so the total HI in the second case is x + 2x = 3x. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is stating that in the second case, the amount of HI formed is 2x, so the total HI is 2x.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express the problem.

In the first case, when you start with 1 H₂ and 3 I₂, you get x moles of HI. Then, you add 2 more H₂, bringing the initial H₂ to 3, and I₂ remains at 3, and HI is x. Then, when equilibrium is re-established, the amount of HI formed is 2x. So perhaps the total HI at equilibrium in the second case is 2x.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because adding H₂ should shift the equilibrium to produce more HI, so the new HI would be more than x. But maybe the problem is saying that the change is 2x, so the total HI is x + 2x = 3x? Or perhaps the problem is that the amount of HI formed (not the total) is 2x. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the second case, the moles of HI formed are 2x, so the total is 2x. So let's proceed with that assumption for now.

So in the second case, the equilibrium moles would be:

H₂: 3 - b
I₂: 3 - b
HI: 2x

Wait, but then the change is b for H₂ and I₂, and 2b for HI. So 2b = 2x → b = x.

So equilibrium moles in second case:

H₂: 3 - x
I₂: 3 - x
HI: 2x

Now, K_p for the second case should be the same as the first case because K is constant at a given temperature. So let's compute K_p for the second case.

In the second case, the total moles at equilibrium are (3 - x) + (3 - x) + 2x = 6 - 2x + 2x = 6.

So the partial pressures would be:

PH2 = (3 - x)/6
PI2 = (3 - x)/6
PHI = (2x)/6 = x/3

So K_p (second case) = (PHI^2)/(PH2 * PI2) = ( (x/3)^2 ) / [ (3 - x)/6 * (3 - x)/6 ) ]

Simplify numerator: x² / 9
Denominator: (3 - x)^2 / 36

So K_p = (x² / 9) / ( (3 - x)^2 / 36 ) ) = (x² / 9) * (36 / (3 - x)^2 ) ) = 4x² / (3 - x)^2

Now, from the first case, K_p was x² / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) ]

So we have:

x² / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) ) ] = 4x² / (3 - x)^2

We can cancel x² from both sides (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't because HI is formed).

So 1 / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) ) ] = 4 / (3 - x)^2

Cross-multiplying:

(3 - x)^2 = 4 * (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (3 - x)^2 = 9 -6x + x²

Right side: 4*(1 - x/2)(3 - x/2)

First compute (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2):

= 1*3 + 1*(-x/2) + (-x/2)*3 + (-x/2)*(-x/2)
= 3 - x/2 - 3x/2 + x²/4
= 3 - (x/2 + 3x/2) + x²/4
= 3 - 2x + x²/4

Multiply by 4:

4*(3 - 2x + x²/4) = 12 - 8x + x²

So now, the equation is:

9 -6x + x² = 12 -8x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

9 -6x = 12 -8x

Bring all terms to left:

9 -6x -12 +8x = 0 → (-3) +2x = 0 → 2x =3 → x= 3/2 =1.5

Now that we have x=1.5, we can plug back into K_p.

From the first case:

K_p = x² / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) ]

x=1.5:

x² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

Denominator: (1 - 1.5/2)(3 - 1.5/2) = (1 - 0.75)(3 - 0.75) = (0.25)(2.25) = 0.5625

So K_p = 2.25 / 0.5625 = 4

Wait, 2.25 divided by 0.5625 is indeed 4 because 0.5625 *4=2.25.

So K_p is 4, which is option B.
</think>

In the equilibrium reaction \( \text{H}_2 + \text{I}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\text{HI} \), the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is calculated using the ratio of partial pressures of the products to the reactants. Initially, 1 mole of \( \text{H}_2 \) and 3 moles of \( \text{I}_2 \) are introduced, forming \( x \) moles of \( \text{HI} \). After adding 2 more moles of \( \text{H}_2 \), the amount of \( \text{HI} \) formed becomes \( 2x \).

### Step 1: First Case
- **Initial moles**: \( \text{H}_2 = 1 \), \( \text{I}_2 = 3 \), \( \text{HI} = 0 \).
- Let \( a \) be the moles of \( \text{H}_2 \) and \( \text{I}_2 \) that react. Since \( 2a = x \), \( a = \frac{x}{2} \).
- **Equilibrium moles**:
  - \( \text{H}_2 = 1 - \frac{x}{2} \),
  - \( \text{I}_2 = 3 - \frac{x}{2} \),
  - \( \text{HI} = x \).
- Total moles = \( 4 \), so partial pressures are proportional to mole fractions.
- \( K_p = \frac{(P_{\text{HI}})^2}{P_{\text{H}_2} \cdot P_{\text{I}_2}} = \frac{\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{1 - \frac{x}{2}}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{3 - \frac{x}{2}}{4}\right)} = \frac{x^2}{(1 - \frac{x}{2})(3 - \frac{x}{2})} \).

### Step 2: Second Case
- After adding 2 moles of \( \text{H}_2 \), initial moles are:
  - \( \text{H}_2 = 3 - \frac{x}{2} \),
  - \( \text{I}_2 = 3 - \frac{x}{2} \),
  - \( \text{HI} = x \).
- Let \( b \) be the moles of \( \text{H}_2 \) and \( \text{I}_2 \) that react, forming \( 2b \) moles of \( \text{HI} \). Since the total \( \text{HI} \) formed is \( 2x \), \( 2b = 2x \) → \( b = x \).
- **Equilibrium moles**:
  - \( \text{H}_2 = 3 - x \),
  - \( \text{I}_2 = 3 - x \),
  - \( \text{HI} = 2x \).
- Total moles = \( 6 \), so partial pressures are proportional to mole fractions.
- \( K_p = \frac{(P_{\text{HI}})^2}{P_{\text{H}_2} \cdot P_{\text{I}_2}} = \frac{\left(\frac{2x}{6}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{3 - x}{6}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{3 - x}{6}\right)} = \frac{4x^2}{(3 - x)^2} \).

### Step 3: Equate \( K_p \) from Both Cases
Since \( K_p \) is constant:
\[
\frac{x^2}{(1 - \frac{x}{2})(3 - \frac{x}{2})} = \frac{4x^2}{(3 - x)^2}.
\]
Cancel \( x^2 \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):
\[
\frac{1}{(1 - \frac{x}{2})(3 - \frac{x}{2})} = \frac{4}{(3 - x)^2}.
\]
Expand and simplify:
\[
(3 - x)^2 = 4 \cdot (1 - \frac{x}{2})(3 - \frac{x}{2}).
\]
Expanding both sides:
\[
9 - 6x + x^2 = 12 - 8x + x^2.
\]
Simplify:
\[
9 - 6x = 12 - 8x \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1.5.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( K_p \)
Substitute \( x = 1.5 \) into the first expression for \( K_p \):
\[
K_p = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1 - \frac{1.5}{2})(3 - \frac{1.5}{2})} = \frac{2.25}{(0.25)(2.25)} = 4.
\]

**Answer:** B
