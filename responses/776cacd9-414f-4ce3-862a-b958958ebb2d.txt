The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa."
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about why Europe was able to penetrate Africa between 1750 and 1900. The question is asking which of the options contributed the least to Europe's ability to do that. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The question refers to Walter Rodney's book where he talks about how European imperialism led to African underdevelopment. So, the focus is on factors that enabled European expansion into Africa during that period.

The options are A through D. Let's go through each one.

Option A: The invention of the machine gun. I remember that the machine gun was a significant factor in European colonization. It was used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in the Scramble for Africa. So, it definitely played a major role in allowing European powers to control and dominate African territories. Therefore, this contributed a lot, so it's probably not the answer.

Option B: The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases. Tropical diseases like malaria, yellow fever, and others were major obstacles for Europeans traveling and living in Africa. If there were vaccines or better medical treatments, it would make it easier for Europeans to survive and establish colonies. So, this invention would have contributed a lot to their ability to penetrate Africa. Thus, B is probably not the answer.

Option C: The development of the joint-stock company. Joint-stock companies allowed European nations to raise capital and organize large-scale expeditions and trade ventures. Companies like the East India Company and later others used this model. This would have facilitated European penetration into Africa by providing the necessary funding and organizational structure. So, C was a big contributor, meaning it's not the least.

Option D: The invention of steam-powered ships. Steamships revolutionized transportation. They were faster and more reliable than sailing ships, which made it easier to travel to and from Africa. This would have greatly aided European exploration, trade, and colonization. So, D also contributed a lot, making it unlikely to be the least.

Wait, but the question is about which contributed the least. So, I have to find the one that had the smallest impact. Let me think again.

Option A: Machine gun—definitely a big factor in military control, so high contribution.

Option B: Vaccines—improved health would allow more Europeans to stay longer and establish a presence, so high contribution.

Option C: Joint-stock companies—enabled economic and organizational expansion, so high.

Option D: Steamships—made travel faster and more efficient, so high.

Hmm, but wait, the timeframe is 1750 to 1900. When were these technologies developed?

- Steamships became prominent in the 19th century, so that's within the timeframe.

- The machine gun started becoming significant in the late 19th century, especially with models like the Maxim gun in the 1880s. So, that's relevant.

- Vaccines for tropical diseases—when were these developed? I think the first effective vaccines for diseases like smallpox were earlier, but maybe vaccines for other tropical diseases came later. For example, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine was established in the late 1890s, but I'm not sure about the exact timeline of the vaccines themselves.

Wait, but if vaccines for major tropical diseases were available by the 1800s, that would have been a big help. If they were not widely available until later, maybe their impact was less during the earlier part of the period. Alternatively, maybe the impact was more on later European penetration, but the question is about the period as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the joint-stock company was more foundational. Without the joint-stock model, it might have been harder to fund and organize the expeditions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the invention of the machine gun was a later development, maybe not as impactful during the entire 1750-1900 period as much as in the late 19th century. But even so, it was a significant factor in the "Scramble for Africa" in the late 1800s.

On the other hand, the joint-stock company was already in use by the 17th and 18th centuries, so it was well-established by 1750. Steamships started to become common in the mid-19th century, so they became more impactful as the period went on.

Vaccines for tropical diseases—did they exist by 1750? I don't think so. The first smallpox vaccine was in the late 1700s, but other tropical disease vaccines came much later. For example, the first effective treatment for malaria was quinine, which was used from the early 1800s, but that's not a vaccine. Vaccines for yellow fever were developed in the late 19th century. So, maybe during the 1750-1850 period, there weren't effective vaccines, which would have limited European penetration more in those earlier years. But by the late 1800s, vaccines started to become available, which would have helped more in the latter part of the period.

So, considering the entire period, perhaps the development of vaccines contributed less compared to the other factors, which were more consistently impactful throughout the period.

Alternatively, maybe the joint-stock company wasn't as crucial in the later part when steamships and machine guns became more important. But I think the joint-stock company was foundational for financing and organizing the initial penetrations, so it's a big contributor.

Wait, but the question is about which contributed the least. So, if vaccines were not as effective or widespread until later in the period, their overall contribution might have been less than the other options, which were more impactful throughout the entire timeframe.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The options are:

A: Machine gun—high impact in the late 19th century.

B: Vaccines—maybe less so in the earlier part but more in the late 1800s.

C: Joint-stock company—already established, so high impact.

D: Steamships—became more impactful in the mid-19th century onward.

So, considering the entire 1750-1900 period, the joint-stock company (C) was probably the most foundational, steamships (D) were very helpful, machine guns (A) were more impactful towards the end, and vaccines (B) might have had a more variable impact depending on when they were available.

Wait, but the question is about the least contribution. So, which of these had the least effect? Maybe the joint-stock company was already in place by 1750, so its contribution to penetration in this period might have been less than the newer technologies. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the joint-stock company was crucial, so it's a high contributor.

Alternatively, perhaps the invention of the machine gun didn't have as much impact as people think. Wait, but in the context of Africa, the machine gun was a game-changer because it allowed small numbers of Europeans to control large areas. So, A is a significant contributor.

Vaccines would have allowed Europeans to survive longer and in greater numbers, which is crucial. So, B is a significant contributor.

So, perhaps the least is C: the joint-stock company. Wait, but without joint-stock companies, how would they have funded the expeditions? Maybe it's more foundational, so it's a high contributor.

Alternatively, maybe the joint-stock company's role was less in the 19th century compared to earlier centuries. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the other options are more directly related to military and transportation, which are key factors in penetration. The joint-stock company is more about the economic and organizational structure. So, it's important but perhaps not as directly impactful as the other options in enabling physical penetration.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but I think the answer is B: the invention of vaccines for tropical diseases contributed the least. Because while they helped, they were perhaps not as immediately necessary as the other factors. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, no. Without the ability to survive, Europeans couldn't penetrate. So, maybe B was actually a big contributor. So, the least would be C: joint-stock company? Or maybe D: steamships were more impactful.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of each option's impact:

- Machine gun (A): Allowed military dominance, so high impact.

- Vaccines (B): Enabled survival and more presence, so high.

- Joint-stock company (C): Enabled funding and organization, so high.

- Steamships (D): Made travel faster, so high.

So, all contributed, but which was the least? Maybe the joint-stock company was already established before 1750, so its contribution during this period was less. Or perhaps the joint-stock company's role was more in Asia and the Americas, and less in Africa. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the joint-stock company was crucial, so it's a high contributor. So, perhaps the least is B: vaccines. Because while they helped, they weren't as immediately necessary as the other technologies.

Wait, but without vaccines, European presence would be limited due to high mortality. So, maybe B was crucial.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to recall. The Scramble for Africa was in the late 19th century, when steamships, machine guns, and vaccines (if available) would have been most impactful. The joint-stock company was already in use earlier, so perhaps it was less of a factor in the later part of the period.

But the question is about the entire 1750-1900 period. So, the joint-stock company was a key factor in the early part, but perhaps less so in the later part when other technologies took over. So, overall, maybe the joint-stock company contributed more than the vaccines, which were perhaps less available until later.

Alternatively, maybe the joint-stock company's contribution was the least because it's more about economic structure rather than the actual ability to penetrate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the joint-stock company allowed for large-scale investment and organization, which was essential for exploration and setting up colonies. So, without that, penetration wouldn't have happened as much. So, C is a big contributor.

Steamships allowed faster travel, so D is a big contributor.

Machine guns allowed military control, so A is a big contributor.

Vaccines allowed health, so B is a big contributor.

But the question is which contributed the least. So, perhaps the joint-stock company (C) contributed the least because it's more about organizational structure, whereas the other options are about military and transportation which are more directly enabling penetration.

Alternatively, maybe the joint-stock company was more about trade than about actual penetration. So, perhaps the least is C.

Wait, but the question is about penetration, so without the joint-stock company, they couldn't have organized the expeditions. So, it's a high contributor.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for which option is least related to military or transportation.

Wait, vaccines are about health, which is crucial but perhaps not as directly enabling as the other options. So, maybe B contributed the least.

Alternatively, perhaps the joint-stock company was the least because it's more about funding and less about the actual means of penetration.

Hmm. Given the options, I think the answer is B: the invention of vaccines for tropical diseases contributed the least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa. Because while they were helpful, they were perhaps not as immediately necessary as the other technologies. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, no, I think without the vaccines, Europeans would have died in large numbers, making it harder to establish a presence. So, B was actually a big contributor. So, the least would be C: the joint-stock company.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll go with B as the least, but I'm not entirely confident.

The question asks which factor contributed the least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa between 1750 and 1900. To determine this, each option is analyzed for its impact during the period:

- **Option A: The invention of the machine gun**  
  The machine gun was a significant factor, particularly in the late 19th century, as it allowed European forces to dominate African territories during the Scramble for Africa. This contributed heavily to European penetration.

- **Option B: The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases**  
  Vaccines and medical advancements were crucial for enabling Europeans to survive and establish a presence in Africa. While their availability varied over the period, they played a vital role in facilitating long-term occupation and penetration.

- **Option C: The development of the joint-stock company**  
  Joint-stock companies were foundational for financing and organizing European expeditions and trade. They were already established by 1750 and played a key role in enabling economic and organizational expansion throughout the period.

- **Option D: The invention of steam-powered ships**  
  Steamships revolutionized transportation, making travel faster and more efficient. This was particularly impactful in the mid-19th century and beyond, aiding in the exploration and colonization of Africa.

Considering the entire period from 1750 to 1900, the joint-stock company (C) was already well-established and foundational, contributing significantly. Steamships (D), machine guns (A), and vaccines (B) were more directly impactful in enabling military control, transportation, and survival. However, the joint-stock company's role was more about organizational structure, which may have been less immediately necessary for physical penetration compared to the other options. Therefore, the joint-stock company contributed the least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the specified period.

Answer: C
