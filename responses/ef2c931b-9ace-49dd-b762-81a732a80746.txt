Okay, so I've got this problem here about designing a steel spindle. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these formulas, but I'll do my best.

First, the problem says the spindle is 4 feet long and needs to transmit 10 horsepower at 600 revolutions per minute. The maximum angular deflection allowed is 0.1 degrees per foot. They want the standard safe diameter and the shear stress developed. The modulus of rigidity is given as 1 × 10^7 psi.

Alright, I think I remember that power transmission relates to torque. So I'll need to find the torque first. The formula for power in horsepower is P = (T * ω) / 60, where T is torque in inch-pounds and ω is angular velocity in rpm. Wait, but I need to make sure the units are right. Oh right, the formula is P (hp) = (T (lb-in) * ω (rpm)) / 60,000. Because 60,000 comes from 60 seconds in a minute times 33,000 lb-ft/hp, but I think the exact derivation isn't necessary here.

So, given P is 10 hp and ω is 600 rpm, I can solve for T. Let me plug in the numbers:

10 = (T * 600) / 60,000

Wait, that equation might not be right. Let me think again. The correct formula is:

P (hp) = (T (lb-in) * ω (rpm)) / 60,000

So rearranging for T:

T = (P * 60,000) / ω

Plugging in P=10 and ω=600:

T = (10 * 60,000) / 600 = (600,000) / 600 = 1000 lb-in.

So the torque needed is 1000 lb-in.

Now, the next part is about the angular deflection. The maximum allowable is 0.1 degrees per foot. Since the spindle is 4 feet long, the total angular deflection would be 0.1 * 4 = 0.4 degrees. But I think in the formula, it's per unit length, so maybe I don't multiply by the length? Wait, no, the deflection per foot is given, so for 4 feet, the total deflection is 0.4 degrees. But wait, the formula for angular deflection in a shaft is θ = (T * L^3) / (G * J), where L is the length, G is modulus of rigidity, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, but angular deflection per unit length would be θ/L = (T * L^2) / (G * J). So perhaps the formula used is θ/L = (T * L^2) / (G * J).

So rearranging, J = (T * L^2) / (G * (θ/L)) )? Wait, no, let me get the formula right.

The formula for angular deflection θ for a shaft is θ = (T * L) / (G * J), but wait, no, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Let me think again. The correct formula is θ (in radians) = (T * L) / (G * J), but sometimes it's expressed as θ per unit length. So perhaps it's better to use θ_total = (T * L^3) / (G * J * 16), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the formula for maximum angle of twist θ (in radians) is θ = (T * L) / (G * J), where J is the polar moment of inertia, which for a solid shaft is (π * d^4)/32.

Wait, let me make sure. J = π * d^4 / 32, correct.

So, the total angular deflection θ is given as 0.4 degrees, but I need to convert that to radians because the formula uses radians. To convert degrees to radians: θ_radians = θ_degrees * (π/180).

So θ = 0.4 * π/180 ≈ 0.4 * 0.01745 ≈ 0.00698 radians.

Now, the formula is θ = (T * L) / (G * J).

We can rearrange this to solve for J: J = (T * L) / (G * θ).

Once I have J, I can solve for d because J = π * d^4 / 32.

So let's plug in the values.

Given:
T = 1000 lb-in
L = 4 ft = 48 inches (since 1 ft = 12 inches)
G = 1 × 10^7 psi
θ = 0.00698 radians

So J = (1000 * 48) / (1e7 * 0.00698)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1000 * 48 = 48,000
Denominator: 1e7 * 0.00698 = 10,000,000 * 0.00698 = 69,800

So J = 48,000 / 69,800 ≈ 0.6877 in^4.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 1e7 is 10^7, which is 10,000,000.

So 10,000,000 * 0.00698 = 10,000,000 * 6.98e-3 = 69,800.

So J = 48,000 / 69,800 ≈ 0.6877 in^4.

Now, J = π * d^4 /32 → d^4 = (32 * J) / π.

So d^4 = (32 * 0.6877) / π ≈ (22.0064) / 3.1416 ≈ 7.005.

So d = (7.005)^(1/4). Let me calculate that.

The fourth root of 7 is approximately 1.626 inches. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see any around 1.6 inches. The closest is option C: 1.8 in, which is 1.8, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula for angular deflection θ is θ = (T * L) / (G * J). But wait, I think I might have missed a factor. Let me check the formula again.

Oh wait, I think the correct formula for the angle of twist θ in radians is θ = (T * L) / (G * J), where J is the polar moment of inertia. So I think that part was correct.

Wait, but maybe the problem states the angular deflection is 0.1 degrees per foot, so for 4 feet, it's 0.4 degrees total. So I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me check that again.

Wait, L is 4 ft, which is 48 inches. So that's correct.

Wait, let me recalculate J.

J = (T * L) / (G * θ) = (1000 * 48) / (1e7 * 0.00698).

Wait, 1000 *48 is 48,000.

1e7 is 10,000,000. 10,000,000 * 0.00698 = 69,800.

So 48,000 / 69,800 ≈ 0.6877 in^4.

Then, J = π * d^4 /32 → d^4 = (32 * J)/π.

So (32 * 0.6877) ≈ 22.0064.

Divide by π (3.1416) → ≈ 7.005.

So d^4 =7.005 → d = 7.005^(1/4).

Let me compute that.

The fourth root of 7: Let's see, 1.5^4 is 5.06, 1.6^4 is 6.5536, 1.7^4 is 8.3521. So 7 is between 1.6 and 1.7.

Compute 1.62^4: 1.62^2=2.6244, then squared again: 2.6244^2 ≈ 6.889, which is still below 7.

1.625^4: 1.625^2=2.6406, squared again: 2.6406^2≈6.9699.

1.63^2=2.6569, squared again: 2.6569^2 ≈7.058.

So 1.63^4 is about 7.058, which is just above 7.005. So d is approximately 1.63 inches.

But looking at the options, the diameters are all in 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, etc. So none of them are around 1.6. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for J. Let me check again.

J is the polar moment of inertia, which for a solid shaft is (π * d^4)/32. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should have used the per foot deflection in a different way. The problem says maximum allowable angular deflection is 0.1°/ft. So for each foot, the deflection is 0.1 degrees. So for 4 feet, it's 0.4 degrees, which is what I did. But perhaps the formula uses per unit length, so θ/L = (T * L^2)/(G * J). Because θ_total = (T * L^3)/(G * J). So perhaps I should use θ/L = (T * L^2)/(G * J).

Wait, let me re-express the formula.

The formula for the angle of twist per unit length (θ/L) is (T * L^2)/(G * J). So θ/L = (T * L^2)/(G * J).

So rearranged, J = (T * L^2) / (G * (θ/L)).

Wait, but θ is given as 0.1 degrees per foot. So θ/L is 0.1 degrees per foot, but L is 4 feet. Wait, no, θ/L is 0.1 degrees per foot, so θ_total is 0.4 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should express θ in radians per foot. So 0.1 degrees per foot is 0.1 * π/180 radians per foot, which is approximately 0.001745 radians per foot.

So θ/L = 0.001745 radians/foot.

Wait, but L is 4 feet, so θ_total = 0.001745 *4 ≈ 0.00698 radians, which is what I did earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I should use θ per unit length in the formula.

So using θ/L = (T * L^2)/(G * J).

So solving for J: J = (T * L^2) / (G * (θ/L)).

Wait, but θ/L is 0.1 degrees per foot, which is 0.001745 radians per foot.

So substituting:

J = (1000 lb-in * (48 inches)^2 ) / (1e7 psi * 0.001745 radians/foot )

Wait, but wait, the units might not match here. Let me compute this carefully.

First, let's compute numerator:

T = 1000 lb-in
L = 48 inches
L^2 = 48^2 = 2304 in²

So numerator: 1000 * 2304 = 2,304,000 lb-in * in² = lb-in^3.

Denominator: G is 1e7 psi, which is lb/in².

θ/L is 0.001745 radians per foot, but wait, the formula uses θ per unit length in the same units as L. Since L is in inches, perhaps I should convert θ per foot to per inch.

Wait, 0.1 degrees per foot is 0.1 degrees per 12 inches, so per inch it's 0.1/12 degrees per inch, which is 0.008333 degrees per inch. Converting to radians: 0.008333 * π/180 ≈ 0.0001455 radians per inch.

So θ/L is 0.0001455 radians per inch.

So denominator: G * (θ/L) = 1e7 psi * 0.0001455 rad/in = 1,000,000 * 0.0001455 = 1,455 lb/(in² * rad).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. Let me proceed numerically.

So J = (2,304,000) / (1e7 * 0.0001455)

Wait, 1e7 is 10,000,000.

So denominator: 10,000,000 * 0.0001455 = 1,455.

So J = 2,304,000 / 1,455 ≈ 1,584 in^4.

Wait, that's very different from the previous 0.6877 in^4. I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, this approach gives J ≈ 1,584 in^4. Then, using J = π * d^4 /32, we can solve for d.

So d^4 = (32 * J)/π = (32 * 1584) / 3.1416 ≈ (50,688) /3.1416 ≈ 16,130.

So d^4 =16,130 → d = (16,130)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. The fourth root of 16,130.

Well, 10^4 is 10,000. 12^4 is 20,736. So 16,130 is between 10 and 12.

Let me try 11: 11^4 = 14,641.

11.5^4: Let's compute 11.5^2 = 132.25, then squared: 132.25^2 ≈ 17,490. So 17,490 is higher than 16,130.

So between 11 and 11.5.

Let me compute 11.2^4.

11.2^2 = 125.44.

125.44^2 = approximately 15,732 (since 125^2=15,625, 126^2=15,876. So 125.44^2 ≈15,732).

So 11.2^4 ≈15,732, which is less than 16,130.

11.3^2: 11.3*11.3=127.69.

127.69^2: Let me compute 127^2 = 16129, 128^2=16384. So 127.69^2 ≈ (127.69)^2 ≈ 16,298.

Wait, 127.69 *127.69:

= (127 + 0.69)^2 = 127^2 + 2*127*0.69 + 0.69^2 = 16129 + 174.06 + 0.4761 ≈ 16303.5361.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, 11.3^4 = (11.3^2)^2 = (127.69)^2 ≈ 16,298.

So 11.3^4 ≈16,298, which is close to 16,130.

So d ≈ 11.3 inches? That can't be right because the options are up to 3.2 inches. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, this doesn't make sense. I think I made a mistake in the calculation when using θ per foot. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula θ = (T * L^3) / (G * J), where θ is in radians, T in lb-in, L in inches, G in psi, and J in in^4.

So θ = 0.4 degrees = 0.4 * π/180 ≈ 0.00698 radians.

So plugging into the formula:

0.00698 = (1000 * (48)^3) / (1e7 * J)

Compute 48^3: 48 *48=2304, *48=110,592.

So numerator: 1000 * 110,592 = 110,592,000.

Denominator: 1e7 * J = 10,000,000 * J.

So equation: 0.00698 = 110,592,000 / (10,000,000 * J)

Rearranging: J = 110,592,000 / (10,000,000 * 0.00698)

Compute denominator: 10,000,000 *0.00698 =69,800.

So J =110,592,000 /69,800 ≈ 1584 in^4.

Wait, same as before. So J=1584 in^4.

Then J=π*d^4/32 → d^4 = (32 * 1584)/π ≈ (50,688)/3.1416≈16,130.

d≈ (16,130)^(1/4)= approx 11.3 inches. But that's way too big compared to the options, which are all under 3.2 inches. So I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for angular deflection per unit length is θ/L = (T * L^2) / (G * J).

So θ/L = 0.1 degrees/ft = 0.1 degrees per 12 inches → 0.1/12 degrees per inch.

Convert 0.008333 degrees per inch to radians: 0.008333 * π/180 ≈ 0.0001455 radians per inch.

So θ/L = 0.0001455 rad/in.

So using θ/L = (T * L^2) / (G * J).

Rearranged: J = (T * L^2) / (G * (θ/L)).

Plugging in the numbers:

T=1000 lb-in,

L=48 inches,

G=1e7 psi,

θ/L=0.0001455 rad/in.

So J = (1000 * (48)^2) / (1e7 * 0.0001455 )

Compute numerator: 1000 * 2304 = 2,304,000.

Denominator: 1e7 *0.0001455 = 1,455.

So J = 2,304,000 / 1,455 ≈ 1,584 in^4.

Same result as before. So J=1584 in^4.

Then, using J=π*d^4/32,

d^4 = (32 * J)/π = (32 *1584)/3.1416 ≈ (50,688)/3.1416 ≈16,130.

d= (16,130)^(1/4) ≈ 11.3 inches. But that's not matching any options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for J. Maybe I should use J= (π/2) *d^4/32? No, I think J is π*d^4/32 for solid shafts.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for J. Alternatively, maybe I should use diameter in inches, but perhaps I missed a conversion factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for torque is in lb-ft instead of lb-in. Let me check.

Wait, the power formula: P (hp) = (T (lb-ft) * ω (rpm)) / 5252.

Because 1 hp = 5252 lb-ft per minute.

So T in lb-ft is T = (P *5252)/ω.

Given P=10 hp, ω=600 rpm.

T = (10 *5252)/600 = 52520 /600 ≈87.53 lb-ft.

Wait, but earlier I used T=1000 lb-in, which is 1000/12 ≈83.33 lb-ft. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the torque calculation earlier. Let me redo that.

The correct formula for power is P (hp) = (T (lb-ft) * ω (rpm)) / 5252.

So rearranged: T = (P * 5252) / ω.

So P=10 hp, ω=600 rpm.

T = (10 *5252) /600 ≈52,520 /600 ≈87.533 lb-ft.

But torque in lb-in is T = 87.533 *12 ≈1050.4 lb-in.

Ah, so earlier I had T=1000 lb-in, but it's actually about 1050 lb-in. So that changes things.

So let's recalculate with T=1050 lb-in.

So θ = (T * L^3)/(G * J).

We have θ=0.4 degrees =0.4 * π/180 ≈ 0.00698 radians.

L=48 inches.

So plugging into θ = (T * L^3)/(G * J):

0.00698 = (1050 * 48^3)/(1e7 * J).

Compute 48^3=48*48*48=110,592.

So numerator: 1050 *110,592= 116,121,600.

Denominator: 1e7 * J=10,000,000 * J.

So,

0.00698 = 116,121,600 / (10,000,000 * J)

Rearranged,

J = 116,121,600 / (10,000,000 *0.00698) 

Compute denominator: 10,000,000 *0.00698=69,800.

So J=116,121,600 /69,800 ≈ 1663 in^4.

Then, using J=π*d^4/32,

d^4 = (32 * J)/π = (32 *1663)/3.1416 ≈ (53,216)/3.1416≈16,934.

So d^4=16,934 → d≈(16,934)^(1/4).

Compute the fourth root of 16,934.

Well, 10^4=10,000, 12^4=20,736. So between 10 and 12.

Let me try 11: 11^4=14,641, which is less than 16,934.

11.2^4: 11.2^2=125.44, 125.44^2≈15,732.

11.3^4: 11.3^2=127.69, 127.69^2≈16,298.

Still less than 16,934.

11.4^2=129.96, 129.96^2≈16,889.

Close to 16,934.

So d≈11.4 inches. But that's way larger than any of the options, which are up to 3.2 inches.

Wait, this can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check all the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for torque. Let me recalculate T correctly.

Power P=10 hp, ω=600 rpm.

Using P = (T * ω)/5252 → T = (10 *5252)/600 → 52520/600 ≈87.533 lb-ft.

So T=87.533 lb-ft = 87.533 *12 = 1050.4 lb-in. So that's correct.

Then, J= (T * L^3)/(G * θ) → (1050.4 *48^3)/(1e7 *0.00698).

Wait, 48^3=110,592.

So 1050.4 *110,592= 116,121,648.

Divided by (1e7 *0.00698)=69,800.

So J=116,121,648/69,800≈1663 in^4.

Then, J=π*d^4/32 → d^4= (32 *1663)/3.1416≈53,216/3.1416≈16,934.

d^4=16,934 → d≈11.4 inches. But the options don't go that high; the highest is 3.2 inches. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is θ = (T * L)/(G * J), not with L^3. Let me check.

Wait, the correct formula for the angle of twist is θ = (T * L^3) / (G * J). So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for J as (π * d^3)/16, but no, that's the formula for the torsion formula for shafts, but J is the polar moment of inertia, which for a solid shaft is (π*d^4)/32.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me check some references.

Upon checking, the formula for angular deflection in radians is indeed θ = (T * L^3)/(G * J), where J is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong value for J. Let me recalculate J accurately.

J = (T * L^3) / (G * θ) → (1050.4 * 48^3) / (1e7 * 0.00698).

Compute 48^3=48*48=2304, 2304*48=110,592.

So J = (1050.4 *110,592) / (1e7 *0.00698).

Compute numerator: 1050.4 *110,592 ≈ let's compute 1000*110,592=110,592,000. 50.4*110,592≈50*110,592=5,529,600; 0.4*110,592=44,236.8. So total numerator≈110,592,000 +5,529,600 +44,236.8 ≈116,165,836.8.

Denominator:1e7 *0.00698=69,800.

So J=116,165,836.8 /69,800 ≈1663.5 in^4.

Then, J=π*d^4/32 → d^4= (32 *1663.5)/π ≈ (53,232)/3.1416≈16,935.

So d^4=16,935 → d≈ (16,935)^(1/4).

Compute:

10^4=10,000

11^4=14,641

12^4=20,736

So between 11 and 12.

Let me compute 11.2^4: 11.2^2=125.44; 125.44^2≈15,732.

11.3^2=127.69; 127.69^2≈16,298.

11.4^2=129.96; 129.96^2≈16,889.

11.5^2=132.25; 132.25^2≈17,490.

So 11.4^4≈16,889, which is close to 16,935.

So d≈11.4 inches. But the options don't have anything near that. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the units for modulus of rigidity. The modulus of rigidity G is given as 1e7 psi, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for shear stress. The shear stress developed in the shaft is given by τ = T*r / J, where r is the radius, and J is the polar moment.

Wait, but I'm being asked to find the diameter first, so I need to proceed correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation. Let me check again.

P=10 hp, ω=600 rpm.

Power formula: P = (T * ω)/5252 → T = (P *5252)/ω.

So T = (10 *5252)/600 ≈52520 /600 ≈87.533 lb-ft.

Which is 87.533 *12 = 1050.4 lb-in. Correct.

So I think the torque is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for angular deflection uses a different form, such as θ = (T * L)/(G * J), but I'm pretty sure it's θ = (T * L^3)/(G * J).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula where θ is per unit length, so we can write θ/L = (T * L^2)/(G * J).

Using that, let's try again.

θ/L = 0.1 degrees per foot = 0.1 * π/(180*12) radians per inch.

Because 1 foot=12 inches, so per inch, it's 0.1/12 degrees per inch.

So θ/L = (0.1/12) * π/180 ≈ (0.0083333) *0.0174533 ≈0.00014544 radians per inch.

So θ/L =0.00014544 rad/in.

Using θ/L = (T * L^2)/(G * J).

Rearranged: J = (T * L^2)/(G * (θ/L)).

Plugging in numbers:

T=1050.4 lb-in,

L=48 inches,

G=1e7 psi,

θ/L=0.00014544 rad/in.

So J = (1050.4 *48^2 ) / (1e7 *0.00014544).

Compute numerator: 1050.4 * 2304 ≈ 1050 *2304=2,419,200; 0.4*2304=921.6 → total≈2,420,121.6 in^3.

Denominator: 1e7 *0.00014544=1,454.4.

So J=2,420,121.6 /1,454.4≈1,663.5 in^4.

Same result as before.

Thus, J=1,663.5 in^4.

So d^4= (32 *1,663.5)/3.1416≈53,232/3.1416≈16,935.

d≈11.4 inches. But again, none of the options match. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula for J. Let me check once more.

J for a solid shaft is indeed (π*d^4)/32. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the unit conversions. Let me check the modulus of rigidity again. It's given as 1e7 psi, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula τ = (T * d)/(2 * J), where τ is the shear stress, T is torque, d is diameter, and J is polar moment.

But I need to find the shear stress after finding d.

Wait, but I'm stuck because my calculated d is 11.4 inches, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for power is P = (T * ω)/60, where T is in lb-in and ω in rad/s.

Wait, ω in rad/s: 600 rpm = 600*(2π)/60 =20π rad/s ≈62.83 rad/s.

So P = T * ω /60,000 (since 60,000 comes from 60*33,000 lb-ft/hp).

Wait, but I think the correct formula when T is in lb-in and ω in rad/s is P = (T * ω)/60,000.

So, rearranged, T = (P *60,000)/(ω).

So P=10 hp, ω=600 rpm = (600 *2π)/60 =20π rad/s≈62.83 rad/s.

So T = (10 *60,000)/62.83 ≈600,000/62.83≈9,549.3 lb-in.

Wait, that's a different result. Earlier I got around 1050 lb-in. Now it's 9,549 lb-in. That's a big difference. I must have made a mistake in the torque calculation.

Wait, what's the correct formula? Let me clarify.

The correct formula for power in horsepower when torque is in lb-in and angular velocity in rpm is P = (T * ω) / 60,000.

So P = (T * ω rpm) / 60,000.

So T = (P *60,000) / ω rpm.

Given P=10 hp, ω=600 rpm.

T = (10 *60,000)/600 =600,000 /600 =1,000 lb-in.

Ah, so that's where I was correct earlier. So T=1000 lb-in.

So earlier calculations were correct, but when I used the other formula, I got a different result. So I should stick with T=1000 lb-in.

So, going back, J = (T * L^3) / (G * θ).

So J = (1000 *48^3)/(1e7 *0.00698).

Compute 48^3=110,592.

So J= (1000 *110,592)/(1e7 *0.00698).

Compute denominator:1e7 *0.00698=69,800.

So J=110,592,000/69,800≈1584 in^4.

Then, J=π*d^4/32 → d^4=(32 *1584)/π ≈50,688/3.1416≈16,130.

d≈(16,130)^(1/4)≈11.3 inches.

But the options don't have this. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the angular deflection is given per foot, but I used it as per inch. Let me check.

The problem says maximum allowable angular deflection is 0.1°/ft. So per foot, the deflection is 0.1 degrees.

So for 4 feet, the total deflection is 0.4 degrees, which is 0.00698 radians.

So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for shear stress now and see which option matches, but I'm not sure.

Shear stress τ = T * r / J, where r = d/2.

So once I have d, I can compute τ.

But since I can't get d to match any options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = (T * L)/(G * J), without the L^3.

Let me try that.

So θ = (T * L)/(G * J).

So J = (T * L)/(G * θ).

Plugging in:

T=1000 lb-in,

L=48 inches,

G=1e7 psi,

θ=0.00698 radians.

So J= (1000 *48)/(1e7 *0.00698)=48,000/(69,800)=0.6877 in^4.

Then, J=π*d^4/32 → d^4= (32 *0.6877)/3.1416≈(22.0064)/3.1416≈7.005.

d=7.005^(1/4)= approx 1.63 inches.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.8 inches, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in using the formula without L^3.

But I thought the formula was θ = (T * L^3)/(G * J). So perhaps I should proceed with that, but then d is 11 inches, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, like θ = (T * L)/(G * J), without the L^3. Let's see what d would be.

If J=0.6877 in^4, then d≈1.63 inches.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.8 inches, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute d^4=7.005 → d= 7.005^(1/4).

Compute:

1.5^4=5.0625 → less than 7.

1.6^4=6.5536 → still less than 7.

1.62^4: 1.62^2=2.6244; 2.6244^2≈6.889 → less than 7.

1.63^4: 1.63^2=2.6569; 2.6569^2≈7.058 → which is just above 7.005.

So d≈1.63 inches.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:1.8 inches, but that's still a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the J calculation when using θ = (T * L)/(G * J).

J=(T * L)/(G * θ) = (1000 *48)/(1e7 *0.00698)=48,000/69,800≈0.6877 in^4.

Then d^4= (32 *0.6877)/3.1416≈7.005 → d≈1.63 inches.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula with L^3, but then d is too big. Alternatively, perhaps the modulus of rigidity was given in the wrong units.

Wait, modulus of rigidity is given as 1 ×10^7 psi, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for shear stress without finding d first.

Wait, shear stress τ = (T * d)/(2 * J), and J=π*d^4/32.

So τ= (T*d)/(2*(π*d^4/32)) )= (T*d*32)/(2*π*d^4) )= (32 T)/(2 π d^3) )= (16 T)/(π d^3).

But I'm not sure if that helps without knowing d.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to select the closest option and compute the shear stress.

Looking at option D:2.4 inches, 386.8 psi.

Let me compute J for d=2.4 inches.

J=π*(2.4)^4 /32 = π*(33.1776)/32≈ (104.378)/32≈3.2618 in^4.

Then, using θ=(T*L^3)/(G*J).

T=1000 lb-in,

L=48 inches,

G=1e7 psi,

J=3.2618 in^4.

θ=(1000 *48^3)/(1e7 *3.2618) = (1000 *110592)/(32,618,000) ≈110,592,000 /32,618,000 ≈3.386 radians.

Wait, that's way more than the allowed 0.00698 radians. So that's not acceptable.

Similarly, let's try option D: d=2.4 inches.

Shear stress τ= (16 *1000)/(3.1416 *2.4^3).

Compute 2.4^3=13.824.

So τ=16,000 / (3.1416 *13.824) →16,000 /43.375≈369.3 psi.

But the option D says 386.8 psi. So perhaps the correct d is 2.4 inches, but the shear stress would be around 369 psi, not 386.8.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it accurately.

τ= (16 * T)/(π *d^3).

T=1000 lb-in, d=2.4 inches.

So τ= (16 *1000) / (3.1416 * (2.4)^3).

Compute denominator: 3.1416 *13.824≈43.375.

So τ≈16,000 /43.375≈369.3 psi.

But option D says 386.8 psi, which is higher. So perhaps the correct d is slightly larger than 2.4 inches.

Wait, option D is d=2.4 in, τ=386.8 psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute which option gives τ=386.8 psi.

Compute d from τ=386.8 psi.

Using τ= (16*T)/(π d^3).

So d^3= (16*T)/(π*τ).

T=1000 lb-in,

τ=386.8 psi.

So d^3= (16 *1000)/(3.1416 *386.8) ≈16,000 /1,214.9≈13.17.

So d≈ cube root of 13.17≈2.36 inches.

Which is close to option D's 2.4 inches.

So perhaps the correct diameter is around 2.4 inches, and the shear stress is approximately 386.8 psi.

But earlier, using the deflection formula, I couldn't get a d that matched any options. So perhaps the correct approach is to accept that and choose option D.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the standard safe diameter of the steel spindle and the shear stress developed. The given parameters are:

- **Power (P):** 10 hp  
- **Speed (ω):** 600 rpm  
- **Length of spindle (L):** 4 ft = 48 in  
- **Maximum allowable angular deflection:** 0.1°/ft  
- **Modulus of rigidity (G):** \(1 \times 10^7 \, \text{psi}\)

### Step 1: Calculate Torque (T)
The power transmitted by a shaft is related to torque (T) and angular velocity (\(\omega\)) by the formula:
\[
P = \frac{T \cdot \omega}{5252}
\]
Rearranging for \(T\):
\[
T = \frac{P \cdot 5252}{\omega}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
T = \frac{10 \cdot 5252}{600} \approx 87.533 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]
Converting to inch-pounds:
\[
T = 87.533 \cdot 12 \approx 1050.4 \, \text{lb-in}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Angular Deflection in Radians
The maximum allowable angular deflection per foot is \(0.1^\circ\). For the total length of 4 ft:
\[
\theta_{\text{total}} = 0.1^\circ \cdot 4 = 0.4^\circ
\]
Convert to radians:
\[
\theta_{\text{total}} = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 0.00698 \, \text{radians}
\]

### Step 3: Use the Formula for Angular Deflection
The angular deflection of a shaft is given by:
\[
\theta = \frac{T \cdot L^3}{G \cdot J}
\]
where \(J\) is the polar moment of inertia for a solid shaft:
\[
J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32}
\]
Rearranging for \(J\):
\[
J = \frac{T \cdot L^3}{G \cdot \theta}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
J = \frac{1050.4 \cdot 48^3}{1 \times 10^7 \cdot 0.00698}
\]
Calculate \(48^3\):
\[
48^3 = 48 \cdot 48 \cdot 48 = 110592
\]
Substitute back:
\[
J = \frac{1050.4 \cdot 110592}{1 \times 10^7 \cdot 0.00698} \approx \frac{116121648}{69800} \approx 1663.5 \, \text{in}^4
\]

### Step 4: Solve for Diameter (d)
Using \(J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32}\), rearrange for \(d^4\):
\[
d^4 = \frac{32 \cdot J}{\pi}
\]
Substitute \(J \approx 1663.5\):
\[
d^4 = \frac{32 \cdot 1663.5}{3.1416} \approx \frac{53232}{3.1416} \approx 16935
\]
Take the fourth root:
\[
d \approx (16935)^{1/4} \approx 11.4 \, \text{inches}
\]
This result is inconsistent with the provided options, suggesting a potential error in the approach or interpretation.

### Step 5: Verify Shear Stress
The shear stress (\(\tau\)) in a shaft is given by:
\[
\tau = \frac{T \cdot r}{J}, \quad r = \frac{d}{2}
\]
Using \(J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32}\), substitute:
\[
\tau = \frac{T \cdot \frac{d}{2}}{\frac{\pi d^4}{32}} = \frac{16 T}{\pi d^3}
\]
For \(d = 2.4 \, \text{in}\) (Option D):
\[
\tau = \frac{16 \cdot 1000}{3.1416 \cdot 2.4^3} \approx \frac{16000}{43.375} \approx 369.3 \, \text{psi}
\]
This is close to the given shear stress of \(386.8 \, \text{psi}\) in Option D.

### Conclusion
While the calculated diameter (\(d \approx 11.4 \, \text{in}\)) does not match the options, the shear stress for \(d = 2.4 \, \text{in}\) aligns closely with Option D. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is:

**D: 2.4 in, 386.8 lbs/in²**

ANSWER: D
