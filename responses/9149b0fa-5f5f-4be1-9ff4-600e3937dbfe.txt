Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Miranda enlarged a picture proportionally. Her original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long. If the new, larger picture is 10 cm wide, what is its length? The options are A through J, with various centimeter measurements.

Alright, so the key here is that the picture was enlarged proportionally. That means the ratio of width to length should stay the same before and after enlargement. So, I need to find the scale factor and apply it to the length.

Let me write down the original dimensions. The original width is 4 cm, and the original length is 6 cm. The new width is 10 cm. I need to find the new length.

First, I should find the ratio of the new width to the original width. That will give me the scale factor. So, new width divided by original width: 10 cm / 4 cm. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 4 is 2.5. So, the scale factor is 2.5.

Since the enlargement is proportional, I can apply this scale factor to the original length to find the new length. The original length is 6 cm. So, I multiply 6 cm by 2.5.

Let me do the multiplication. 6 times 2 is 12, and 6 times 0.5 is 3. Adding those together gives 15. So, 6 cm multiplied by 2.5 equals 15 cm.

Wait, let me double-check that. 6 * 2.5: another way to think about it is 6 * (5/2) = (6*5)/2 = 30/2 = 15 cm. Yep, that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one is 15 cm. Let me scan the options: A is 22, B is 15, so that's the one. The other options don't match 15, so B must be the correct answer.

I think that's it. The length of the enlarged picture is 15 cm.

The scale factor is 10/4 = 2.5. Applying this to the original length of 6 cm gives 6 * 2.5 = 15 cm.

Answer: B
