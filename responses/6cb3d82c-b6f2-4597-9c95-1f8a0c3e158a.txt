Okay, so I need to figure out what disposable income is. I remember hearing the term before, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact definition. Let me think about it step by step.

Disposable income, as I recall, has something to do with the money people have left after paying taxes. So it's like after the government takes its share, what's left for the individual to spend or save. But wait, is it just about personal income or does it include businesses too? Hmm, the question is asking about what disposable income is, in general.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's total income before taxes. No, that doesn't sound right because disposable income is after taxes. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: Total income after business expenses. Wait, disposable income for businesses? Or is it for individuals? I think it's more about individuals. Because when I hear disposable income, it's usually in the context of personal finance. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Personal income after taxes. That sounds familiar. I think disposable income for individuals is the amount left after taxes are paid. So C could be the right answer.

Option D: Income after mandatory health insurance. That's a specific expense, but is that part of disposable income? I'm not sure. Maybe, but I think disposable income is a broader term that includes all taxes, not just health insurance.

Option E: Income used for investment. No, that doesn't fit. Investment is a use of income, but disposable income isn't specifically for that.

Option F: Luxury goods. Again, that's a use, not the definition of disposable income.

Option G: Government's revenue. That's probably not right. Government's revenue would be taxes and other income, but disposable income is for individuals.

Option H: Income for savings only. No, because people can spend their disposable income on various things, not just savings.

Option I: After paying for basic necessities. Wait, isn't that more like what's left after expenses? Maybe, but I think disposable income is the amount after taxes, before expenses. Or is it after all expenses? I'm a bit confused now.

Option J: After paying for utilities. That's even more specific than I. So J is probably not the correct definition.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up concepts. Disposable income is the money you have left after taxes are deducted. So it's the amount you can spend or save as you wish. It doesn't include paying for necessities yet because that's a different step. So in that case, C would be correct because it's the personal income after taxes.

But wait, I'm not sure if disposable income includes all deductions or just taxes. Let me think again. Disposable personal income is typically calculated as personal income minus personal taxes and non-tax payments, like social security. So it's after all these deductions. So C says "after taxes have been paid," which might be a bit narrow because there are other deductions too, but maybe in the context of the question, it's considered after taxes.

Alternatively, sometimes people refer to disposable income as the amount left after paying all mandatory expenses, but I think that's more like "disposable" in a household budget sense. So perhaps the correct term is after taxes. 

Wait, looking back, the options: C is "the amount of personal income which remains after taxes have been paid." That aligns with what I think disposable income is. So I think the answer is C.

The correct answer is C. Disposable income refers to the amount of personal income remaining after taxes have been paid.
