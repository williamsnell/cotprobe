Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about corporate policies, specifically about employee benefits and their rights. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about two main issues associated with what sizing. The options given are a bit complex, but I'll try to pick apart each part.

So the structure is: (First issue), (Key issue), (Second issue), (Key issue). The options are labeled A to J, each giving four options.

Wait, let me read the question again: The options are four items, each option (A to G) provides four items separated by commas. The question lists three blanks, each with a different term.

Breaking down the question:

There are two main issues associated with _____ sizing. (So the first blank is a noun, which is the main issue.)

_______ is a key issue as due to the information policy of the corporation it can be argued that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant (that's the second part of the first issue).

_______ is a second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off.

Wait, maybe I should parse it differently. Let me rephrase.

The question is about two main issues related to ____ sizing. For each of these issues, the first part is a noun, and then the key issue is given.

Wait, perhaps it's structured like this:

The two main issues are: [First Issue] and [Key Issue]. The first issue is about [First Part], and the second part of the first issue is the Key Issue. The second main issue is [Second Issue], and the Key Issue is provided.

Looking at the options, each option has four items. The first blank is a noun, the next is the Key Issue, the third is the second main issue, and the fourth is another Key Issue.

So for the first part of each main issue, the options provide different terms.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit.

So, first blank is "Down" (as in downsizing or reducing the number of employees). Then the key issue is "Autonomy," which refers to employees' ability to make decisions. Then the second main issue is "Remuneration," which relates to compensation. Then the key issue is "Benefit," which is about benefits or compensation.

Wait, but the second main issue is the "package" when laid off. So, when laid off, the second issue is about the package, and the key issue is compensation.

So, the first main issue is downsizing. The key issue is autonomy.

Wait, let me think again. The question says "two main issues associated with _____ sizing. _______ is the key issue as due to the information policy of the corporation it can be argued that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant."

So the first blank is the main issue, the key issue is the second part, which is the argument about the right to know.

So the first main issue is downsizing. The key issue is "Autonomy," as in employees' ability to make decisions or take action, which is about their rights, especially concerning being redundant. So that would fit into the first blank as "Down," and the key issue is "Autonomy."

Then the second main issue is the "second issue" which is about the package when laid off. So the second main issue is the "benefit" package. But wait, what's the second main issue? It says the second issue is the "package" that employees receive when laid off.

Hmm, let me reorganize.

Alternative approach: The question is about two main issues. The first part of each main issue is something, and the first part of the second main issue is also something, and the key issues are about the right to know and the benefit package.

So, the main issues are:

1. Down sizing: this is one main issue. The key issue is autonomy (as employees have a right to know if redundant).

2. The second main issue is the package. The key issue is the benefit package (compensation or something else).

Looking at the options, let's see which option fits.

Looking at option E: Down, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation.

So, first main issue is "Down." The key issue is "Autonomy," as in employees have a right to know upon redundancy.

Second main issue is "Involvement," which is about involvement or being involved in such matters. The key issue here is "Compensation" or "benefit," which would be "Compensation."

Wait, but the second main issue is the second issue, which is the "package" when laid off. The key issue is the benefit package. So the second main issue is "Involvement" and the key is "Compensation."

So putting it together, the two main issues are downsizing and involvement. Key issues are autonomy and compensation.

Looking at the options:

Option E is: Down, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation.

Which matches: first main issue is Down, key is Autonomy. Second main issue is Involvement, key is Compensation.

Wait, but the question says the second main issue is the "package" and the key is "benefit." So perhaps I'm mixing something up.

Wait, let me read the question again: "the second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off."

So the second main issue is the second issue, which is the package, and the key is the benefit (like compensation for employees).

So, if the main issues are downsizing and something else (like, for example, "Involvement" or "Involvement" in option E), then the second main issue would be "Involvement," and the key is "compensation."

So, the main issues would be: Down sizing and Involvement. Key issues: Autonomy and Compensation.

So in the answer, the first blank would be Down, the key issue is Autonomy. The second main issue is Involvement, key issue is Compensation.

Looking at the options, option E says: Down (first main), Involvement (second main), Autonomy (key issue), Compensation (key issue).

Yes, that seems to fit.

Additionally, looking at other options, let me check if any other option matches.

Option E seems to fit. Checking other options:

Option D: Down, Privacy, Autonomy, Benefit. Here, the first main is Down, key is Autonomy. Second main is Privacy, which doesn't fit the second main issue being Involvement. So no.

Option G: Up, Independence, Involvement, Benefit. Wait, that's not matching.

Option F: Down, Independence, Autonomy, Compensation. So first main is Down, key is Independence. Second main is Independence, which doesn't fit.

Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation. So first main Down, key Involvement. Second main is Remuneration, key is compensate. But the second main issue is the package (benefit), not remuneration. So no.

Option E fits.

Another way to think: The first blank is the main issue. The second part is the key issue. The third part is the second main issue. The fourth part is the key issue.

So looking for options where the first blank is one main issue, the second part is the key issue, the third is the second main issue, and the fourth is the key.

Looking at option E: Down, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation.

So main issues are Down and Involvement. Key issues are Autonomy and Compensation.

That fits. So the answer should be option E.
</think>

The question asks about two main issues associated with sizing, with specific key issues in parentheses. The analysis identifies that the first main issue is "Down" ( downsizing), with the key issue being "Autonomy" (employees' ability to make decisions or act upon redundancy). The second main issue is "Involvement," with the key issue being "Compensation" (benefit package). This matches option E.

Answer: E
