Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: "Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis." I remember that in gel electrophoresis, DNA is separated based on size. Smaller fragments move faster because they can pass through the gel matrix more easily. So A sounds correct. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet; I'll check the others too.

Option B: "Germinating seeds use less oxygen than do nongerminating seeds." Wait, during germination, seeds undergo respiration, which increases as they start sprouting. So germinating seeds should use more oxygen, not less. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: "The rate of transpiration decreases with an increase in air movement." Hmm, transpiration is influenced by factors like humidity and wind. If air movement increases, it can carry away the moisture from the plant's surface, which would actually increase transpiration because the surface dries out, creating a gradient. So I think C is wrong.

Option D: "The rate of photosynthesis decreases with an increase in light intensity." That doesn't make sense. Photosynthesis generally increases with light intensity until it hits the saturation point, after which it plateaus. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "Non-germinating seeds require more water than germinating seeds." Non-germinating seeds might be in a state of休眠 (dormancy) and don't need as much water as those actively germinating, which do require water to absorb and grow. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: "Larger DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do smaller DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis." Wait, this is the opposite of what I thought earlier. Larger fragments are bulkier and move slower in the gel. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "Water flows from hypertonic to hypotonic." Oh wait, in osmosis, water moves from hypotonic to hypertonic solution. So G is wrong. Because water flows into the more concentrated solution.

Option H: "The rate of respiration decreases with an increase in temperature." No, respiration usually increases with temperature up to a point, beyond which enzymes denature and it decreases. So H is incorrect.

So revisiting all options, A seems correct because smaller DNA fragments do migrate faster in gel electrophoresis. The other options either have the opposite effect or are based on incorrect biological principles.

The correct statement is A: Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.

Answer: A
