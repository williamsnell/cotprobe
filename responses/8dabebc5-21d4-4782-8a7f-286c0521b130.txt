Question:

In 2006, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that "in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. " In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)

Options:

A: equitable servitude.
B: easement for public use.
C: invalid legal agreement.
D: implied easement.
E: adverse possession.
F: restrictive covenant.
G: real estate lien.
H: unenforceable restriction.
I: right of way easement.
J: zoning regulation.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the situation is about an investor who bought a 100-acre tract in a rural county in 2006. Then, he made a subdivision plan creating 90 one-acre lots and set aside 10 acres for a public school. He promoted this in his sales brochure, saying that the school would be close and that the county wouldn't have to spend tax money to get the property for the school. Then, in 2007, he recorded the subdivision plan. In 2009, the school board voted to build a new school on that 10-acre tract.

The question is asking what the investor's designation of the 10-acre tract is best described as. The options are from A to J, including things like equitable servitude, easement, restrictive covenant, etc.

Alright, so I need to figure out what kind of legal interest the investor created. Let's start by recalling some property law concepts.

First, an easement is a non-possessory right to use another's land for a specific purpose. There are different types: easements for public use, private easements, etc. If the investor set aside land for a public school, that might be an easement for public use. But wait, the investor is the one who's designating it, so does that create an easement automatically?

Alternatively, a restrictive covenant is a promise not to do something with the land, often found in deeds. It's a private agreement between parties. But here, the investor is setting aside land for a public purpose, which seems more like an easement than a covenant.

Another option is a dedication. When a landowner sets aside land for public use, like a road or a school, they might dedicate that land to the public. Dedications are typically made by the owner's act, which could include offering the land to the public with the intent that it be accepted for public use. Once the public authority (like the school board) accepts it, it becomes an easement in favor of the public.

In the facts, the investor recorded the subdivision plan, which might be part of the dedication process. The school board later voted to build on it, which could be seen as acceptance.

So, if the investor's designation was a dedication, then the public (the school) has an easement over that land. But is that an easement for public use? Or is there another term for it?

Looking at the options, option B is "easement for public use." That seems to fit because the land is set aside for the public (the school serves the community). The investor's act would create such an easement once accepted.

Wait, but could it be an implied easement? Implied easements arise from necessity, prior use, or by the grant. Here, the subdivision plan was recorded, which suggests an express easement, not implied. So probably not D.

What about a restrictive covenant? That's more about limiting what someone can do on their property. Here, the investor is giving a right, not restricting. So F is less likely.

Equitable servitudes are similar to restrictive covenants but enforced through equity. Again, this seems more about a restriction than a grant, so A might not fit.

Right of way easement (I) is a specific type, usually for access. This is for a school, so it's broader than just a right of way. So I is probably not the best fit.

Zoning regulation (J) is a government-imposed use, not something the landowner creates. So J is out.

Real estate lien (G) is a security interest, not relevant here.

Adverse possession (E) is about acquiring title through prolonged use, which doesn't fit.

Invalid legal agreement (C) and unenforceable restriction (H) seem negative. The fact that the school board accepted the land suggests it's a valid agreement.

So, putting it all together, the investor's act likely created an easement for public use. The answer should be B.

The investor's designation of the 10-acre tract as a site for a public school is best described as an **easement for public use**. This is because the investor set aside land for a public purpose, and once the school board accepted it, it became an easement in favor of the public. 

Answer: B
