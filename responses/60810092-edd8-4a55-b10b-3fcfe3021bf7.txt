Question:

Discuss the role of a stimulus that elicits a behavior pattern.

Options:

A: The intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior is directly proportional to the animal's motivation
B: Only stimuli of a social nature can elicit behavior patterns in animals
C: Behavior patterns are random and not specifically elicited by any particular stimuli
D: A stimulus always requires conscious recognition by the animal to elicit a behavior pattern
E: All stimuli can elicit specific behavior patterns
F: A stimulus elicits a behavior pattern based solely on the physical strength of the stimulus, regardless of the animal's internal state
G: Sign stimuli elicit specific responses from an animal and the intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior pattern is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation to perform that behavior.
H: Sign stimuli suppress specific responses in an animal
I: The frequency of a stimulus rather than its intensity determines the likelihood of eliciting a behavior pattern
J: Stimuli that elicit behavior patterns are only effective in the presence of other, secondary stimuli

Okay, so I have this question about the role of a stimulus in eliciting a behavior pattern. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is about what a stimulus does. I remember from psychology that stimuli are the things that cause a response. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll try to think through each option.

Option A says the intensity of the stimulus is directly proportional to the animal's motivation. Hmm, that sounds a bit off. I think motivation is more about internal drives, like hunger or fear, rather than the intensity of the stimulus itself. Like, a loud noise might scare a bird regardless of how motivated it is to fly away.

Option B claims only social stimuli elicit behavior. That doesn't seem right. Animals respond to all sorts of stimuli, like food, predators, environmental changes. For example, a dog might respond to the smell of food (a non-social stimulus) by eating.

Option C says behavior patterns are random and not elicited by specific stimuli. That can't be correct because learned behaviors and instincts are usually triggered by specific things. For instance, a cat pouncing on prey isn't random; it's triggered by movement.

Option D states that a stimulus requires conscious recognition. I don't think so. Many animal behaviors are instinctive and don't require consciousness. For example, a baby bird doesn't think about opening its mouth when a parent comes with foodâ€”it just does it automatically.

Option E says all stimuli can elicit specific behaviors. That seems too broad. Not every stimulus would cause a specific response. Some might not trigger any behavior, or the response could vary based on context or the animal's state.

Option F suggests the stimulus's physical strength alone determines the behavior, ignoring the animal's internal state. Wait, internal states like hunger, stress, or tiredness can affect how an animal responds. For example, a dog might not react to a command if it's really tired, even if the stimulus is strong.

Option G talks about sign stimuli and inversely proportional to motivation. Sign stimuli are specific signals, like a pigeon hearing a specific sound to peck. The idea here is that if an animal is more motivated (high motivation), a weaker stimulus might suffice. That makes sense because motivation can amplify the effect of a stimulus. So if an animal is highly motivated to eat, even a subtle sign might trigger the behavior.

Option H says sign stimuli suppress responses. That doesn't align with what I know. Sign stimuli are usually about triggering, not suppressing. For example, a traffic light turning green is a sign stimulus that triggers drivers to go.

Option I claims frequency determines the likelihood, not intensity. I'm not sure. Sometimes it's the intensity, like a loud noise, that's more effective. But frequency could play a role too, like how often a stimulus occurs might influence habituation or sensitization.

Option J says stimuli are only effective with secondary stimuli. That doesn't sound right. A primary stimulus should be effective on its own. For example, the presence of food (primary) doesn't need another stimulus to make an animal eat.

So, going back, the correct answer is likely G. Sign stimuli elicit specific responses, and the intensity needed is inversely proportional to motivation. That means higher motivation needs less intense stimulus to trigger the behavior. Like a highly motivated animal might respond to a smaller cue because their drive is strong.

The correct answer is G. Sign stimuli elicit specific responses, and the intensity required is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation. This means that a stronger motivation reduces the need for a more intense stimulus to trigger the behavior.
