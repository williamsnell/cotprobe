Okay, so I've got this question about when arrests can be made without a warrant. The question is asking which of the options is not one of those circumstances. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in the US, there are certain situations where an arrest warrant isn't needed. The main ones I can think of are when the crime is a felony, or when a misdemeanor is committed in the officer's presence. Also, there's something about probable cause for felonies.

Looking at the options:

Option A says an officer can arrest for a misdemeanor not a breach of peace and not in their presence. Hmm, wait, I thought misdemeanors without being a breach of peace usually require a warrant unless it's in their presence. So if it's not in their presence, maybe a warrant is needed, making this not a valid circumstance for no warrant. But I'm not sure.

Option B: An officer must have probable cause for a felony and that the person did it. That sounds right because for felonies, probable cause is needed regardless of presence, so no warrant is needed. So B is a valid circumstance.

Option C: Officer arrests for a misdemeanor committed in their presence without evidence. Wait, but I think for misdemeanors in their presence, they don't need evidence beyond their own observation. So C is a valid no-warrant situation.

Option D: Suspected of committing a misdemeanor that hasn't occurred yet. Wait, can you arrest for a crime that hasn't happened yet? I think you can if it's a felony and there's a clear intent, like an imminent future crime. But for misdemeanors, I don't think so. So D might not be a valid circumstance, but I'm not certain.

Option E: Officer can arrest for a felony regardless of presence. That's correct because for felonies, even if the officer wasn't present, if there's probable cause, no warrant is needed. So E is valid.

Option F: Arrest if they suspect a person will commit a felony in the future. I'm pretty sure this is about "hot pursuit" or specific future felonies, like if someone is about to commit a serious crime. But I'm not sure if this is a standard circumstance. Maybe F is not valid, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Misdemeanor has occurred, officer believes the person did it. Wait, but for a misdemeanor not in their presence, usually you need a warrant. So if it's not in their presence, they can't arrest without a warrant unless it's a breach of peace. So G might not be valid. But I'm not sure.

Option H: Officer arrests for a breach of peace misdemeanor in their presence. That sounds correct because breach of peace is a misdemeanor that can be arrested without a warrant if in the officer's presence. So H is valid.

Option I: Arrest based on a tip from an unverified source. I think this is tricky. A tip alone usually isn't enough for probable cause unless it's reliable. So if the source isn't verified, maybe this isn't a valid circumstance for no warrant. So I might be the answer.

Option J: Arrest for a felony committed in presence. That's definitely valid because if a felony happens in front of the officer, they can arrest without a warrant. So J is valid.

Now, the question is which option is NOT a circumstance for no warrant. The options that are circumstances are B, C, E, H, J. Options that aren't would be A, D, F, G, I.

Looking back, the original question is about when an arrest may be made without a warrant. So the exception would be the one that doesn't fit.

Option A: Misdemeanor not a breach of peace, not in presence. So I think this requires a warrant, so it's not a valid circumstance. So A is the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. For misdemeanors not a breach of peace, usually, you need a warrant unless it's in your presence. So if it's not in your presence, you can't arrest without a warrant unless it's a felony. So A is not a valid reason for no warrant, so the question is asking which is not one of the circumstances, so A is the correct answer.

Wait, but another possibility is option D. If the crime hasn't occurred yet, can you arrest? I think only if it's a felony and about to happen, like a future crime, but for misdemeanors, you can't. So D is also not a valid circumstance.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT one of the circumstances. The options that are circumstances are B, C, E, H, J. So the others (A, D, F, G, I) are not. But the question is which is not one, so any of these could be the answer.

But the options are asking which is not a circumstance. So, looking back, the possible answers:

A: Misdemeanor not a breach of peace, not in presence. So this would require a warrant, so it's not allowed without a warrant. So A is the correct answer.

Wait, but another angle: can an officer arrest for a misdemeanor not a breach of peace without a warrant if it's in their presence? Yes. So if it's not in their presence, they can't. So option A is about not in presence, so they can't arrest without a warrant, making A the correct answer because it's not a circumstance where arrest without warrant is allowed.

So the answer is A.

The question asks which option is not a circumstance under which an arrest may be made without a warrant. To determine this, each option is analyzed:

- **Option A**: Refers to a misdemeanor that is not a breach of peace and not committed in the officer's presence. Typically, such misdemeanors require a warrant, making this not a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant.
- **Option B**: Involves probable cause for a felony, which is a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant.
- **Option C**: Refers to a misdemeanor committed in the officer's presence, which is a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant.
- **Option D**: Involves a suspected future misdemeanor, which is not a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant.
- **Option E**: Refers to a felony, regardless of the officer's presence, which is a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant.
- **Option F**: Involves a suspected future felony, which may be valid in specific cases but is not a standard circumstance.
- **Option G**: Refers to a misdemeanor where the officer believes the person committed it, but without presence, it typically requires a warrant.
- **Option H**: Involves a breach of peace misdemeanor in the officer's presence, which is a valid circumstance.
- **Option I**: Refers to an arrest based on an unverified tip, which generally lacks probable cause and is not a valid circumstance.
- **Option J**: Refers to a felony committed in the officer's presence, which is a valid circumstance.

The analysis concludes that **Option A** is not a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant because it involves a misdemeanor not in the officer's presence and not a breach of peace, requiring a warrant in such cases.
