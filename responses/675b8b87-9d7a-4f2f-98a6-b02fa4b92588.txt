Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about whether Dr. Maxine Miller acted ethically and legally when she gives a non-custodial parent the test results of his 5th-grade son. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the roles and the situation. Dr. Miller is a school psychologist, so her primary responsibility is to the students and their well-being. She administered tests to the child, and now a non-custodial parent is asking for those results.

In legal terms, I remember that school records, including test results, are protected by laws like FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) in the US. FERPA generally requires that schools obtain consent from a parent before releasing any information about a student. However, there are exceptions. For example, if the parent is the custodial parent, they have access. But in cases where the parent is non-custodial, the situation might be different. I think FERPA would allow the custodial parent access, but a non-custodial parent might not have the same rights unless there's a court order or specific authorization.

So, if Dr. Miller complies with the father's request without proper authorization, she might be violating FERPA, which could make her action illegal. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics regarding non-custodial parents. Maybe there's a court document that grants the non-custodial parent access, but the question doesn't mention that. So, assuming there's no such court order, releasing the information without consent could be against the law.

Now, from an ethical standpoint, psychologists have a duty to protect students' privacy and maintain confidentiality. The APA ethical guidelines would probably say that releasing information without proper consent is unethical. However, there's also the consideration of the best interests of the child and the parents. If the non-custodial parent is involved in custody disputes or the child's welfare, maybe there's an ethical obligation to provide the information if it's in the child's best interest. But I'm not sure if that's a strong enough reason to override FERPA.

Putting it together, legally, she might be acting illegally because she's releasing information without proper consent. Ethically, she's probably acting unethically because she's violating confidentiality. So, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches that.

Looking at the options:
- E says "illegally but ethically." That doesn't fit because if it's illegal, it's likely unethical too.
- G says "illegally and unethically." That seems to fit because both the legal and ethical standards are being violated.
- H says "ethically, but not within her professional rights." That would imply she did the right thing legally, but that's not the case here.
- I says "legally but unethically." Again, not matching because the action is illegal.
- J says "legally and ethically," which is the opposite of what I think.

So I think the correct answer is G: illegally and unethically.

The correct answer is G: illegally and unethically. Dr. Miller's action would likely violate both legal standards (FERPA) and ethical guidelines (confidentiality). 

Answer: G
