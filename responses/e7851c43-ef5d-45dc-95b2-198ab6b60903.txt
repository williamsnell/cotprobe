Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the enthalpy of vaporization of chloroform (CHCl3) is 29.4 kJ/mol at its normal boiling point of 334.88 K. I'm supposed to calculate the entropy change of the surroundings. The options are from A to J, all in J/(K·mol⁻¹), and they're all negative values except for none—wait, no, looking at the options, all are negative. So I'll just focus on the calculation.

Hmm, entropy change of the surroundings. I remember that when a process occurs, the entropy change of the surroundings is related to the heat transfer. Since vaporization is an endothermic process, the system (the chloroform) is absorbing heat. So the surroundings must be losing heat, right? Because if the system takes in heat, the surroundings give it up, which would mean a negative entropy change for the surroundings, as entropy is Q_rev/T for the process.

Wait, the formula I think I should use is ΔS_surroundings = -ΔS_system, but wait, no, more accurately, for a process at constant temperature and pressure, the entropy change of the surroundings is equal to the negative of the heat transfer at the temperature. Because the system is absorbing heat, the surroundings are losing it.

So the formula would be ΔS_surroundings = - (ΔH_vap / T). Since the vaporization is at the boiling point, which is the temperature at which the phase change occurs reversibly.

Wait, but wait, the entropy change of the surroundings is due to the heat released or absorbed by the system. Since the system is vaporizing, it's absorbing heat, which means the surroundings are losing that heat. So the surroundings' entropy change would be negative because Q is negative (since heat is leaving the surroundings).

So the formula would be ΔS_surroundings = - (ΔH_vap) / T.

But wait, ΔH_vap is given as 29.4 kJ/mol. Let me convert that to J because the answer is in J/(K·mol⁻¹). So 29.4 kJ is 29,400 J.

The temperature is 334.88 K. So plug that into the equation.

So ΔS_surroundings = -(29400 J) / 334.88 K. Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me compute this: 29400 divided by 334.88.

Let me compute 29400 / 334.88.

First, approximate 334.88 is about 335. So 29400 / 335 is roughly equal to... Well, 335 times 87 is 335*80=26800, 335*7=2345, so 26800+2345=29145. That's close to 29400. So 87 would give 29145, which is 29400-29145=255 less. So 255/335 is approximately 0.76. So 87.76. So about 87.76 J/(K·mol⁻¹). But since it's negative, it would be approximately -87.76.

Looking at the options, option C is -87.8 J/(K·mol⁻¹). So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation. Maybe using a calculator would be better.

Calculating 29400 divided by 334.88:

29400 ÷ 334.88 ≈ Let's see:

334.88 × 87 = let's compute 334.88 * 80 = 26790.4, 334.88 *7=2344.16. Sum is 26790.4 +2344.16=29134.56. The difference between 29400 and 29134.56 is 265.44. Now, 265.44 ÷ 334.88 ≈ 0.792.

So 87 + 0.792 = 87.792. So approximately 87.79 J/(K·mol⁻¹). So the entropy change is -87.79, which rounds to -87.8, matching option C.

To calculate the entropy change of the surroundings during the vaporization of chloroform, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = -\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{T}
\]

Given:
- Enthalpy of vaporization, \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 29.4 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 29,400 \, \text{J/mol}\)
- Boiling point (temperature), \(T = 334.88 \, \text{K}\)

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = -\frac{29,400}{334.88} \approx -87.8 \, \text{J/(K·mol⁻¹)}
\]

Thus, the entropy change of the surroundings is approximately \(-87.8 \, \text{J/(K·mol⁻¹)}\), which corresponds to option C.
