Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number whose digits add up to 19. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what the question is asking. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. The digits sum to 19 means if I add each digit of the number together, the total should be 19.

Looking at the options given: A is 1991, B is 199, C is 289, D is 17, E is 109, F is 29, G is 991, H is 11, I is 919, and J is 5. I need to check each of these to see if they're prime and if their digits add up to 19.

Let me start by checking each option one by one.

Option A: 1991. Let me add the digits: 1 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 20. Oh, that's 20, which is more than 19, so it doesn't fit. Plus, I think 1991 is not a prime. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me check quickly. 1991 divided by 11? 11 times 181 is 1991, so it's not prime. So A is out.

Option B: 199. Digits sum to 1 + 9 + 9 = 19. So that's good. Now, is 199 a prime? Well, I know that 199 is a prime number because it doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and itself. So B is a candidate, but I should check the others to see if there's a smaller one.

Option C: 289. Digits sum: 2 + 8 + 9 = 19. So that's correct. Is 289 prime? Wait, 289 is 17 squared, right? 17*17=289, so it's not a prime. So C is out.

Option D: 17. Digits sum: 1 + 7 = 8. That's way less than 19, so D doesn't qualify.

Option E: 109. Digits sum: 1 + 0 + 9 = 10. Again, too low. Doesn't fit.

Option F: 29. Digits sum: 2 + 9 = 11. Still too low.

Option G: 991. Digits add up to 9 + 9 + 1 = 19. So that's good. Is 991 prime? I think so. Let me check by dividing by some primes. Divided by 2? No, it's odd. Divided by 3? 9+9+1=19, which isn't divisible by 3. Divided by 5? Ends with 1, so no. 7? 7 times 141 is 987, 987 +4=991, so no. 11? 11*90=990, plus 1 is 991. So 991 is 11*90.09... Wait, no, 11*90 is 990, 11*90 +1=991, so 991 isn't divisible by 11. Next, 13: 13*76 is 988, 988+3=991, so not divisible by 13. 17: 17*58=986, 986+5=991, so no. 19: 19*52=988, 988+3=991. So 991 is a prime. So G is a candidate.

Option H: 11. Digits sum to 2, way too low.

Option I: 919. Digits sum to 9 + 1 + 9 = 19. Is 919 prime? Let's check. Divided by 2? No. 3: 9+1+9=19, not divisible by 3. 5: Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7: 7*131=917, 917+2=919, so no. 11: 11*83=913, 913+6=919, so no. 13: 13*70=910, 910+9=919. 13*70=910, 910+13=923, which is higher, so 919 isn't divisible by 13. 17: 17*54=918, 918+1=919, so 919 isn't divisible by 17. 19: 19*48=912, 912+7=919, so no. 23: 23*39=897, 897+22=919, which isn't a multiple. So 919 is a prime. So I is another candidate.

Option J: 5. Digits sum to 5, way too low.

So now, the candidates are B (199), G (991), and I (919). Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again.

Wait, option B is 199, which is smaller than 919 and 991. So 199 is a prime, digits sum to 19, and it's the smallest among the options. But wait, are there any other options with smaller numbers that sum to 19? Let me think.

Wait, the options given are fixed, so I have to choose from A to J. So among the options, B is 199, which is 3 digits, and G is 991, also 3 digits, and I is 919, also 3 digits.

Is 199 the smallest in the options? Let me check the options again.

Wait, check if there are any two-digit primes in the options whose digits sum to 19. The options are A:1991 (4 digits), B:199 (3), C:289, D:17 (digits sum 8), E:109 (sum 10), F:29 (sum 11), G:991, H:11 (sum 2), I:919, J:5 (sum 5). So among the options, the only 3-digit primes with digits summing to 19 are B, G, and I. So the smallest among these is 199.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there a two-digit prime that sums to 19? Let me think. The maximum sum for two digits is 9+9=18. So 19 can't be achieved with two digits. So the smallest possible is a three-digit number. So in the options, the three-digit primes are B (199), C (289, not prime), G (991), I (919). So among these, 199 is the smallest. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think if there's a three-digit prime smaller than 199 that has digits summing to 19. For example, numbers like 109: sum is 10, which is too low. 119: sum is 11, no. 128: sum 11. 137: sum 11. 146: sum 11. 155: sum 11. 164: sum 11. 173: sum 11. 182: sum 11. 191: sum 11. So no, the next is 199, which is the first three-digit prime where digits sum to 19. So yes, 199 is the smallest among the options given. So the answer is B.
