Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Suppose a fair coin is tossed 50 times. The bound on the probability that the number of heads will be greater than 35 or less than 15 can be found using Chebyshev's Inequality. What is the upper bound of the probability? The options are from A to J, with various decimal numbers.

Hmm, I remember that Chebyshev's Inequality is a tool used to bound the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean. It's especially useful when we don't know the exact distribution of the variable, but we do know the mean and variance.

First, let's break down the problem. We have a fair coin tossed 50 times. So each toss is a Bernoulli trial with p=0.5 for heads. The number of heads, let's call it X, follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=50 and p=0.5.

I need to find the probability that X is greater than 35 or less than 15. In other words, P(X > 35) + P(X < 15). Since these two events are mutually exclusive, I can add their probabilities together.

But instead of calculating the exact probability, we're supposed to use Chebyshev's Inequality to find an upper bound. So I need to apply Chebyshev's here.

First, let's recall Chebyshev's Inequality. It states that for any random variable X with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the probability that X deviates from μ by more than kσ is at most 1/k². Mathematically, P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k².

Wait, but in this case, we have two tails: X > 35 and X <15. So maybe I can frame this as the probability that X is more than a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean, and then apply Chebyshev.

Let me calculate μ and σ for the binomial distribution. For a binomial distribution, μ = n*p. Here, n=50, p=0.5, so μ = 50*0.5 =25.

The variance for a binomial distribution is σ² = n*p*(1-p). So σ² = 50*0.5*0.5 =12.5. Therefore, σ is sqrt(12.5). Let me calculate that: sqrt(12.5) is approximately 3.5355.

Now, I need to find how many standard deviations away 35 and 15 are from the mean of 25.

35 is 10 units above the mean, so in terms of σ, that's 10 / 3.5355 ≈ 2.828. Similarly, 15 is 10 units below the mean, so that's also about 2.828σ.

Wait, but Chebyshev's Inequality typically considers the distance from the mean, so |X - μ| ≥ kσ. But in our case, X >35 is the same as X - μ ≥10, which is X -25 ≥10, so X ≥35. Similarly, X <15 is X ≤15, which is X - μ ≤ -10, so |X - μ| ≥10. So in terms of σ, since 10 is about 2.828σ, k is approximately 2.828.

But Chebyshev's Inequality requires k to be an integer? Or does it just need to be a real number greater than zero? I think it's just a real number, so I can use 2.828 as k.

Wait, but Chebyshev's Inequality gives P(|X - μ| ≥kσ) ≤ 1/k². So in this case, the probability that X is either greater than 35 or less than 15 is equal to P(|X - μ| ≥10) ≤ 1/(k^2), where k is 10/σ.

Let me compute k exactly. k = 10 / sqrt(12.5). Let me calculate that:

sqrt(12.5) is sqrt(25/2) = (5)/sqrt(2) ≈3.5355. So 10 divided by that is 10/(5/sqrt(2)) )= 2*sqrt(2) ≈2.8284.

So k = 2*sqrt(2) ≈2.8284.

Then according to Chebyshev, P(|X - μ| ≥kσ) ≤1/k². So 1/( (2*sqrt(2))^2 )=1/(8) =0.125.

Wait, but Chebyshev's Inequality gives the probability that X is at least kσ away from the mean, which in our case is the union of X >35 and X <15. So the upper bound is 0.125, which is 1/8.

Looking at the options, G is 0.125. So the answer should be G.

Wait a second, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when using Chebyshev, people use k as an integer, but here k is about 2.828, which is between 2 and 3. Wait, but Chebyshev's doesn't require k to be integer; it can be any positive real number. So the calculation is correct as is.

Alternatively, if I were to take k=3, then 1/k² would be 1/9≈0.1111, which is less than 0.125. But since our k is 2.828, which is less than 3, the actual bound would be 1/(2.828^2)=1/8=0.125. So yes, the upper bound is 0.125, which is option G.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the events are symmetric. Since 35 is 10 above 25 and 15 is 10 below, so they're symmetric around the mean. So the probability that X is more than 10 away from the mean in either direction is bounded by Chebyshev.

Wait, another point: Chebyshev's gives the probability for the absolute deviation, so P(X ≤ μ -kσ or X ≥ μ +kσ) ≤1/k². So that's exactly the case here, where μ=25, and we're looking at X ≤15 or X≥35, which is 25-10 and 25+10, which are 15 and 35.

So yes, the upper bound is 1/k², where k is 10/sigma. Sigma is sqrt(12.5)= approx 3.5355.

So 10/(3.5355)= approx 2.828, which is exactly 2*sqrt(2), so k=2√2.

Thus, 1/k²=1/(8)=0.125, which is option G.

Chebyshev's Inequality provides an upper bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean by a certain amount. For a fair coin tossed 50 times, the number of heads \(X\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \(n = 50\) and \(p = 0.5\). The mean \(\mu\) is 25, and the standard deviation \(\sigma\) is \(\sqrt{12.5} \approx 3.5355\).

The probability that \(X\) is greater than 35 or less than 15 corresponds to \(X\) being at least 10 units away from the mean. This is equivalent to \(|X - \mu| \geq 10\). Using Chebyshev's Inequality, \(P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}\), where \(k = \frac{10}{\sigma} \approx 2.828\). Substituting \(k\), the upper bound is \(\frac{1}{(2.828)^2} = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125\).

Thus, the upper bound of the probability is **0.125**, corresponding to option G.
