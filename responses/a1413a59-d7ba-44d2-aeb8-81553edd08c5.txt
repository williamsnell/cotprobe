Question:

Find a recursion equation satisfying y [n] where y [n] is the sum of the squares of all integers from 0 to n.

Options:

A: y [n-1] = y [n] + n^2; n \geq 1 where y [0] = 0
B: y [n] = (n(n+1)(2n+1))/6; n \geq 0
C: y [n-1] = y [n] * n^2; n \geq 1 where y [0] = 0
D: y [n-1] = y [n] / n^2; n \geq 1 where y [0] = 0
E: y [n+1] = 2y [n] + (n+1)^2; n \geq 0 where y [0] = 0
F: y [n-1] = y [n] - n^2; n \geq 1 where y [0] = 0
G: y [n] = y [n-1] + 2n - 1; n \geq 1 where y [0] = 0
H: y [n+1] = y [n] - (n+1)^2; n \geq 0 where y [0] = 0

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a recursion equation that satisfies y[n], which is the sum of the squares of all integers from 0 to n. The options are given from A to J, but in the question, they're labeled A to H. I need to pick the correct one.

First, let me understand what y[n] represents. It's the sum of squares from 0² to n². So, y[n] = 0² + 1² + 2² + ... + n². I remember there's a formula for this sum, which is y[n] = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. That's one of the options, option B. But I'm supposed to find a recursion equation, not a direct formula, right?

Wait, the question asks for a recursion equation, so it's about how y[n] relates to previous terms, like y[n-1], y[n-2], etc. So I need to express y[n] in terms of y[n-1].

Let me think. If y[n] is the sum up to n², then y[n-1] would be the sum up to (n-1)². So, y[n] = y[n-1] + n². Because the sum up to n is the sum up to n-1 plus the nth term, which is n squared.

Looking at the options, option F says y[n-1] = y[n] - n². Wait, that's the same as y[n] = y[n-1] + n², just rearranged. So option F is correct. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: y[n-1] = y[n] + n². That would mean y[n] is smaller than y[n-1], which doesn't make sense because each term adds a positive number. So A is wrong.

Option C: y[n-1] = y[n] * n². That would imply y[n] is much larger, which isn't the case. So C is wrong.

Option D: y[n-1] = y[n] / n². Again, that would make y[n] bigger than y[n-1], which is the opposite. So D is wrong.

Option E: y[n+1] = 2y[n] + (n+1)^2. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. Let me test it. If y[n+1] is the sum up to (n+1)², then y[n+1] = y[n] + (n+1)^2. But E says it's 2y[n] + (n+1)^2. That would imply y[n+1] is more than just adding the next term, so E is incorrect.

Option G: y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n -1. Wait, 2n-1 is the formula for the nth odd number, but the sum of squares isn't that. For example, sum up to n=2: 0+1+4=5. Using G, y[1] = y[0] +1 (since 2*1-1=1). y[0]=0, so y[1]=1. Then y[2]=y[1] +3=4. But the actual sum is 0+1+4=5. So G gives 4, which is wrong. So G is incorrect.

Option H: y[n+1] = y[n] - (n+1)^2. That would mean each step subtracts, which doesn't make sense because the sum should increase. So H is wrong.

So the only correct recursion is option F, which correctly states that y[n-1] equals y[n] minus n squared, meaning y[n] is y[n-1] plus n squared.

The correct recursion equation is found in option F, as it correctly expresses y[n] in terms of y[n-1] by adding n².

Answer: F
