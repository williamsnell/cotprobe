Okay, so I've got this question about Mercury's orbit around the sun. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year. I know that an Earth year is 365 days, so Mercury's year would be 365 divided by 5, which is about 73 days. Hmm, I remember that Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, so its orbit should be shorter than Earth's, which makes sense.

The question is asking for the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun, with 1 AU being the Earth's average distance. So I'm thinking about how to relate the orbital period to the distance. I recall something called Kepler's laws, specifically the third law, which relates the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the sun.

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit. The formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, but when comparing two planets, the constants cancel out. So for Earth and Mercury, we can write (P_mercury / P_earth)² = (a_mercury / a_earth)³.

Given that Mercury's orbital period is 1/5 of Earth's, so P_mercury = (1/5) * P_earth. Let me plug that into the equation. ( (1/5) )² = (a_mercury / 1 AU)³. That simplifies to (1/25) = (a_mercury)³. Taking the cube root of both sides gives a_mercury = (1/25)^(1/3). 

Wait, let me think about that. The cube root of 1/25 is the same as 1 divided by the cube root of 25. The cube root of 27 is 3, so the cube root of 25 is just a bit less than 3, maybe around 2.92. So 1/2.92 is approximately 0.342. But wait, that would make Mercury's distance about 0.34 AU, which is roughly a third of an AU. Looking at the options, option F is 1/3 AU, which is about 0.333. That seems close.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought Mercury's actual distance is about 0.39 AU, which is closer to Earth's 1 AU. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the semi-major axis with the actual distance. Or perhaps the question is approximating. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, another approach: if P² is proportional to a³, then a³ = (P_mercury²) * (a_earth³) / (P_earth²). Alternatively, since a_earth is 1 AU and P_earth is 1 year, a_mercury³ = (P_mercury / P_earth)². So a_mercury³ = (1/5)² = 1/25. So a_mercury = cube root of (1/25) ≈ 0.342 AU, which is about 0.34 AU. Hmm, but I thought Mercury was closer, maybe around 0.387 AU. Oh, wait, the question says "approximate" and gives options, so 0.34 is close to 1/3, which is option F. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should consider the actual value. Let me calculate the cube root of 1/25. 25 is 5², so 1/25 is 0.04. The cube root of 0.04 is approximately 0.342, as I thought. So that's about 0.34 AU. Looking at the options, the closest one is F: 1/3 AU, which is about 0.333. But wait, the options also include D: 1/9 (~0.111), which is way too small. Alternatively, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the proportionality. Let me think again. Kepler's third law in astronomical units and years would be P² = a³. Because when using AU and years, the equation simplifies since the constants are accounted for. So if P is 1/5 years, then P² is (1/5)² = 1/25. So a³ = 1/25, so a = cube root of 1/25 ≈ 0.342 AU, which is about 1/3 AU. So option F would be correct.

But wait, I've also heard that Mercury's orbital period is about 88 days, which is roughly 1/4 of a year (since 365/4 ≈91), but the question says 1/5, which is 73 days. Hmmm, maybe the question is approximating. So perhaps the intended answer is that Mercury's orbital period is about 1/5 of a year, leading to a distance of approximately cube root of (1/25) ≈0.34 AU, which is close to 1/3 AU, option F.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. I remember that for planets, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So if Mercury's period is 1/5, then (1/5)^2 = 1/25 = a^3. So a is cube root of 1/25 ≈ 0.342 AU, which is about 1/3 AU. So option F is the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the cube of 0.3 is 0.027, and 0.34^3 is about 0.04, which matches 1/25. So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and the cube of that is about 0.037, which is less than 1/25 (0.04). So maybe the actual value is closer to 0.34, but among the options, 1/3 is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach. Maybe using the formula for circular orbits, where velocity v = 2πa / P. But I don't think that's necessary here since the question is about distance, not velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options. The options are A to J, with various fractions. The cube root of 1/25 is approximately 0.34, which is roughly 1/3 (0.333). So option F is the best fit. Therefore, the answer should be F: (1/3) AU.

The question involves determining the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis. Given that Mercury's orbital period is about one-fifth of an Earth year, we can calculate its distance as follows:

1. **Kepler's Third Law**: \( P^2 = a^3 \), where \( P \) is the orbital period in years and \( a \) is the semi-major axis in AU.
2. **Given Data**: Mercury's period \( P = \frac{1}{5} \) years.
3. **Substitute into the Law**: \( \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = a^3 \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{25} = a^3 \).
4. **Solve for \( a \)**: \( a = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{25}} \approx 0.342 \) AU.
5. **Compare with Options**: The closest option to \( 0.342 \) AU is \( \frac{1}{3} \) AU, which is approximately \( 0.333 \) AU.

Thus, the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun is best represented by option F: \( \frac{1}{3} \) AU.
