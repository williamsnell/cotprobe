Okay, so I have this question about Anscombe criticizing Sidgwick. I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that Anscombe was a significant figure in 20th-century philosophy, known for her work in ethics and metaethics. She was critical of certain ethical theories, especially those she saw as outdated or not grounded in reality. Sidgwick, on the other hand, was a 19th-century philosopher associated with utilitarianism, specifically a form of classical utilitarianism. 

The question is about what grounds Anscombe criticized Sidgwick. The options are A through J, each pointing to a different aspect. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: He supports the principle of consequentialism. Well, Sidgwick is a consequentialist, as he's a utilitarian. Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick probably relates to his approach, but I'm not sure if she just criticized him for being a consequentialist. I think she had more specific issues.

Option B: He endorses the divine law conception of ethics. Sidgwick was a utilitarian, and his ethics were based on the idea that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness. Divine command theory is different; that's more like what people like Joseph Butler or some religious ethicists might support. I don't think Sidgwick was into divine law, so B might not be correct.

Option C: He claims there's a "natural balance" to the universe. This sounds a bit like a different philosopher, maybe someone like Leibniz or someone discussing theodicy. Sidgwick's work doesn't ring a bell with a natural balance idea. So probably not C.

Option D: He does not believe in the principle of double effect. The principle of double effect is about distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences, often discussed in Catholic moral theology and some secular ethics. Sidgwick's utilitarianism might not have a strong distinction here, but I'm not certain if Anscombe specifically criticized him for this. I'll keep this in mind.

Option E: All of the above. If none of the other options are correct, E would be wrong. But I don't think all the above are correct, so E is unlikely.

Option F: He neglects the role of emotions in ethical decision-making. Anscombe was critical of many modern ethical theories for being too rationalistic and ignoring the role of emotions or "moral sentiments." She argued that emotions are central to moral reasoning. Sidgwick's utilitarianism is very calculating and based on consequences, which might mean he neglects emotions. So F could be a correct criticism.

Option G: He fails to account for the role of virtue in ethics. Anscombe was also critical of utilitarianism for not focusing enough on virtue ethics. She believed that the virtues were essential to understanding ethics, whereas Sidgwick's approach was more about outcomes than character. So G is another possible correct option.

Option H: He does not distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. This relates to the principle of double effect. If Sidgwick didn't make this distinction, that could be a point Anscombe made. But I'm not sure if she specifically targeted this aspect. It's possible, but I don't recall it being the main point.

Option I: He argues that morality is subjective. Sidgwick was a utilitarian, and he likely believed in an objective standard of morality based on happiness. So I don't think he argued for subjectivity. Therefore, I is incorrect.

Option J: He overlooks the importance of individual intention in moral actions. Anscombe's critique might include that Sidgwick didn't consider intention enough. His utilitarianism focuses on the consequences regardless of the intent, which might mean he overlooks intention. So J could be correct.

Now, I need to think about which of these points Anscombe actually made. From what I remember, Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick had a few main points. She thought his utilitarianism was too detached from the individual and the role of intentions. She also criticized him for not considering the role of emotions and virtues, which she saw as central to ethics. 

So looking at the options, F (neglecting emotions), G (failing to account for virtue), and J (overlooking intention) seem relevant. But the options are individual choices, so which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is about the grounds Anscombe used. I think one of her main points was that Sidgwick's utilitarianism didn't consider the role of intentions and that it was too focused on consequences without enough attention to the agent's character or emotions.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up her critique with her critique of other philosophers. Let me think again. Anscombe's essay "Modern Moral Philosophy" critiques the whole tradition of moral philosophy she was in, including Sidgwick. She argues that modern moral philosophy, including utilitarianism, fails to account for the role of virtue and the importance of intentions. She also emphasizes that moral reasoning involves emotions and that the consequences approach is insufficient.

So among the options, F, G, and J all seem plausible. But the options are single choices, so which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the options are: A-J, and the user is asking which is correct. Let me see the options again.

Option F: He neglects the role of emotions.

Option G: He fails to account for the role of virtue.

Option J: He overlooks the importance of individual intention.

Anscombe's critique includes all three, but the question is about the grounds—so perhaps the main point is that Sidgwick didn't consider the role of intention. Or perhaps that he neglected the role of emotions and virtues. But the options don't have an 'all of the above' except E, which I don't think is correct because not all options are correct.

Wait, looking back, the options are separate. So let's see:

In Anscombe's critique, she argues that Sidgwick and other modern moral philosophers fail to consider the role of virtue and emotions, and instead focus on consequences or rules without considering the agent's intentions or character. So perhaps the main point is that he neglects the role of emotions (F), or perhaps he fails to account for virtue (G), or overlooks intention (J).

I think the main point she made was about the role of intentions. She believed that intentions are crucial because the morality of an action depends on what one intends, not just the consequences. So if Sidgwick didn't account for intention, that would be a ground for criticism.

Alternatively, she might have criticized him for neglecting emotions, as she thought emotions were essential for moral understanding. So F could also be correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall specific points from Anscombe's critique. She says that modern moral philosophy, including Sidgwick's, has been influenced by Cartesian rationalism, which separates the mind from the body and emotions. She argues that this leads to a neglect of the role of emotions in moral judgment. She also emphasizes the importance of the virtues and the role of intentions.

Wait, so perhaps the primary criticism is that Sidgwick neglects emotions. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, she might have criticized him for not considering intentions and virtues.

Looking at the options again, the question is about the grounds of Anscombe's criticism. I think the main point is that Sidgwick's approach doesn't account for the role of intentions and the agent's character, which are captured in virtues. So perhaps G is correct.

Alternatively, the principle of double effect (H) relates to intentions, so maybe H is the point. But I think H is more about whether consequences are foreseen or intended. Sidgwick didn't make that distinction, so H could also be correct.

Wait, in Anscombe's critique, she mentions that the utilitarian approach doesn't consider whether the consequences are intended or merely foreseen. She argues that the distinction is important. So perhaps H is the correct answer.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find a summary. Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick includes the idea that his utilitarianism fails to consider the intentions of the agent. She believed that the morality of an action depends on the intentions behind it, not just the consequences. So if Sidgwick didn't distinguish between intended and foreseen consequences, that would be a point of criticism.

So looking at the options, H says he does not distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. That seems to align with Anscombe's point. Therefore, H might be the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought the main points were about emotions and virtue. Now I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Option H: He does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one’s action.

If Sidgwick didn't make that distinction, then H would be correct. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, G, or J.

Wait, another angle: Anscombe's essay also criticizes the absence of a role for virtue and the focus on consequences over intentions. So perhaps the criticism is that Sidgwick fails to account for the role of virtue (G) and neglects emotions (F), and overlooks intention (J). But the options are separate.

I think the correct answer is that Anscombe criticized Sidgwick for not distinguishing between intended and foreseen consequences, which relates to the principle of double effect. So H would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe she criticized him for neglecting the role of intentions, which would be J. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think the key point is that Anscombe argues against the utilitarian approach for not considering the agent's intentions. So if Sidgwick didn't consider intention, then J would be correct. Or H if he didn't distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences.

I think the correct answer is H. Because she emphasizes that the consequences depend on intent, so not distinguishing between them is a flaw.
</think>

Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick for not distinguishing between the foreseen and intended consequences of actions, which is a key point in her critique of his utilitarian approach. She emphasizes the importance of intentions in moral reasoning, arguing that the morality of an action depends on what one intends, not just the outcomes. This aligns with the idea that Sidgwick's approach fails to account for the distinction between foreseen and intended consequences, making **H** the correct answer.

H
