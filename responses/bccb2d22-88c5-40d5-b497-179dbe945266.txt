Question:

Four years ago the owner of a shopping center leased a store in the center for a 10-year term to a pharmacistfor use as a drugstore. The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it. The pharmacist brought an appropriate action to enjoin the new lease to the discount drugstore as a violationof the covenant in the pharmacist's lease. If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?

Options:

A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.
B: The owner's purchase and integration of the adjacent parcel of land effectively nullifies the existing covenant.
C: The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.
D: The discount drugstore on the adjacent parcel is not considered a 'new' lease, but a continuation of an existing one.
E: A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.
F: The owner has the right to lease any part of his property to any business, regardless of existing leases.
G: The pharmacist did not adequately express his concerns to the owner before initiating legal action.
H: A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.
I: The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shoppingcenter premises.
J: The covenant is not applicable as the shopping centers were considered separate entities at the time of the lease agreement.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, four years ago, the owner leased a store to a pharmacist for 10 years. The lease had a covenant saying the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Now, the owner bought land next to the center. This land had a building that was previously used by a food supermarket and a discount drugstore. The owner took over those leases when he bought the land. He then reconstructed the common areas to make the two centers look like one bigger development.

The pharmacist found out the discount drugstore's lease was about to expire, and the owner planned to renew it. The pharmacist sued to stop this, saying the covenant was violated. The question is, if the court rules for the owner, why?

Looking at the options:

A says the covenant doesn't apply because the owner didn't lease the space directly but bought it with an existing lease. Hmm, but the owner is the one planning to renew the lease, so maybe that's not it.

B suggests the purchase and integration nullified the covenant. I'm not sure about that; covenants usually run with the land unless there's something specific.

C claims the drugstore was already there when the lease was made. But the lease was four years ago, and the discount drugstore was there for ten years before the owner bought it. Wait, no, the owner bought the parcel last year, and the previous leases were assigned to him. So the discount drugstore was operating when the owner took over, but the covenant was made when the original lease was signed four years ago. So the discount store wasn't part of the original covenant.

D says it's not a new lease but a continuation. That makes sense because the discount store's lease is expiring and being renewed. So it's the same space, just extending the lease. But does that matter for the covenant? The covenant prohibits leasing to another drugstore, so renewing a lease might still be a problem unless the covenant only applies to new lessees.

E states covenants can't restrict land the covenantor doesn't own. But the owner owns both the original and the adjacent parcel, so that might not apply.

F says the owner can lease any part to any business. But the covenant is supposed to restrict that, so F might not be correct unless the covenant is unenforceable.

G is about the pharmacist not communicating properly. The question doesn't mention any issues with communication, so probably not.

H claims covenants restricting competition are invalid. I think some covenants, especially those that are too broad, can be against public policy. But I'm not sure if this is the case here.

I says the covenant only applies to the original premises. That seems plausible because the covenant was about the shopping center as defined in the lease. The adjacent parcel might be considered a different entity unless integrated.

J suggests the covenant doesn't apply because the centers were separate. But the owner integrated them, making them appear as one. So maybe J isn't correct now.

Wait, the lease included specific metes and bounds, so the covenant was tied to the original shopping center. The adjacent parcel was a different property. So when the owner bought it and integrated it, does that change the covenant's application?

Option I says the covenant applies only to the original premises. That makes sense because the covenant was specific to the shopping center leased to the pharmacist. The adjacent parcel, even after integration, might still be considered a separate entity under the original covenant.

So, if the court sides with the owner, it's likely because the covenant was intended only for the original leased premises, not the adjacent land the owner later acquired. Therefore, the owner didn't violate the covenant by leasing the adjacent space.

The court likely ruled in favor of the owner because the covenant in the pharmacist's lease was specific to the original shopping center premises and did not extend to the adjacent parcel of land that the owner later acquired and integrated. This means the owner's actions did not violate the covenant as it was only intended to apply to the original leased property.

Answer: I
