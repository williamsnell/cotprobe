Okay, so I've got this question about articles and whether they're qualified rights or not. I'm a bit fuzzy on my international law, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking which of the listed articles are not qualified rights. The options are A through F, each corresponding to a different article number. I remember that qualified rights are those that can be limited under certain circumstances, usually by law, and often relate to the rights of the individual against the state.

Let me try to recall what each article in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) or the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) says. 

Starting with Article 19: I think that's about freedom of opinion and expression. Yes, Article 19 UDHR states that everyone has the right to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers. But wait, isn't this a qualified right? Because, for example, in some cases, the state can impose restrictions like in the interest of national security, public order, etc. So Article 19 is a qualified right.

Next, Article 11. I'm not too sure. Wait, in ECHR, Article 11 is about freedom of assembly and association. Yes, and I think that's a qualified right too. States can impose restrictions, like for public safety, but it's a right that can be limited.

Article 12: Hmm, that's the right to participate in the government of one's country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. I think this is also a qualified right. Because, for instance, certain restrictions might apply, especially in cases of emergency or for other legitimate reasons, though I'm not entirely sure.

Article 9: That's the right to personal liberty and security. Article 9 ECHR says no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile. This is a fundamental right and I believe it's considered an unqualified right because it's so basic. But wait, can it be qualified? I think in some cases, like if someone is a danger to society, they might be detained, but the key is that any restrictions have to be依法 and necessary. So maybe it's qualified in the sense that it can be limited, but it's a right that's more foundational.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. In ECHR, certain rights are absolute, meaning they can't be derogated from under any circumstances. For example, Article 9, the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, is absolute. So that's an unqualified right. Whereas others, like Article 11, can be limited.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me clarify: qualified rights are those that can be limited by the state in certain circumstances, while absolute rights cannot be limited. So, for example, the right to life (Article 2 ECHR) is absolute—you can't derogate from that. Similarly, Article 3 prohibits torture, inhuman, and degrading treatment, which is also absolute.

So, looking again at the options:

A: Article 19 – qualified
B: Article 11 – qualified
C: Article 12 – qualified
D: Article 9 – unqualified (absolute)
E: Article 3 – unqualified (absolute)
F: Article 17 – qualified

Wait, am I mixing the articles correctly? Let me check each one.

Article 19: Freedom of expression. Yes, qualified because states can impose restrictions.

Article 11: Assembly and association. Qualified, as seen in cases where public order justifies limitations.

Article 12: Right to take part in government. I think this is qualified because it's subject to the country's legal provisions, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe it's considered a qualified right because, for example, during an emergency, some participation rights might be curtailed.

Article 9: Personal liberty. As I thought, this is an absolute right because arbitrary arrest is not permissible under any circumstances. So this is unqualified.

Article 3: Prohibition of torture. Definitely absolute; no exceptions.

Article 17: Right to own property. This is a qualified right because the state can expropriate property for public use, provided there's compensation.

So the question is asking which articles are not qualified rights. That means which ones are absolute, unqualified rights. From the above, Articles 3, 9, and maybe others.

Wait, the options given are A to F. The question is which are not qualified, so they are unqualified.

Looking at the options, the choices are A:19, B:11, C:12, D:9, E:3, F:17.

So, from my analysis, D (9) and E (3) are unqualified (absolute) rights. The others are qualified.

But the question is asking which are not qualified. So the answer would be the ones that are unqualified. So the correct options are D and E.

Wait, but looking back, the question is "Which of the following articles are not qualified rights?" So the answer would be the ones that are unqualified.

But the options given are A-F, each being one article. So the question is, which of these is not a qualified right. So among A-F, which ones are unqualified.

Wait, in the options, the user is asking which are not qualified, so they are looking for the articles that are unqualified.

So, in the options, D is Article 9, which is unqualified, and E is Article 3, which is also unqualified. The other options (A-F except D and E) are qualified.

But the question is phrased as "Which of the following articles are not qualified rights?" So the answer would be D and E.

Wait, but looking back, the user's question lists the options as A to F, each being a single article. So the correct answer would be the letters corresponding to the articles that are unqualified.

So the correct options are D (Article 9) and E (Article 3). But the question is asking for which are not qualified, so they're the correct answers.

Wait, but the options are given as letters A to F, each representing one article. So the question is, which of the options (A-F) are not qualified. So the correct answer would be D and E.

But the question is presented as a multiple-choice question, so perhaps it's a single correct answer. Wait, no, the options are labeled A to F, each being one article. So the user is asking which of the following are not qualified rights. So perhaps the answer is multiple, but the options are individual.

Wait, perhaps the question is which one of the options is NOT a qualified right, meaning which one is an unqualified right. So in that case, the correct answers would be D and E, but if the options are each individual, then perhaps the question is which one is correct, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user's question is: "Which of the following articles are not qualified rights?" So the answer would be the articles that are unqualified. From the options, D (9) and E (3) are unqualified. So the correct answers are D and E.

But looking at the options, the user provided A to F, each a single article. So perhaps the options are:

A:19, B:11, C:12, D:9, E:3, F:17.

So the question is, which of these are not qualified. So the correct answers are D and E.

But the way the question is phrased, it's a multiple-choice question, so perhaps it's a list where the user has to select all that apply, but in the format given, the answer is to select the letters that are correct.

Wait, but the user's instruction says "selecting from the answer A through to J." But the options are A-F. So perhaps the correct answer is that both D and E are unqualified.

But looking back, the user's answer format is to reply with a single letter, like "Answer: A".

Wait, perhaps the options are presented as a list, and the user is to select all that apply. But in the given context, perhaps the correct answer is E, as in the example.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

In the ECHR:

- Article 9: Right to personal liberty. Absolute, unqualified.

- Article 3: Prohibition of torture. Absolute, unqualified.

So the articles that are not qualified (i.e., unqualified) are 9 and 3.

So among the options, D is 9, E is 3. So the answer would be D and E.

But the question is asking which are not qualified, so the correct options are D and E.

But the user's question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps the answer is that both D and E are correct, but the options are presented as separate choices. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to pick all that apply, but the way it's presented, the user is to select one letter.

Wait, perhaps the question is in the format where each option is a single article, and the correct answers are D and E. But the user is to select the correct one(s). But in the initial question, it's presented as a multiple-choice question, so perhaps it's a list where the user is to select all that apply.

However, the way the user has phrased the question, it's a single selection: "Which of the following articles are not qualified rights?" with options A-F. So perhaps the answer is E, as in the example.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check the initial example the user gave: the answer is to be the letter, like "Answer: A".

So in this case, the correct answer is both D and E. But since the options are individual, perhaps the question is worded as "Which of the following is not a qualified right?" implying singular, but the user's question says "are not", plural.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the correct answer is that both D and E are unqualified, so the answer would include both. But since the options are separate, perhaps the question is to select all that apply, but the user's example shows a single letter.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to select the articles that are not qualified, and the correct answer is E (Article 3) as an example.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. The question is asking which articles are not qualified, i.e., unqualified. So the correct articles are 3, 9, and maybe others.

Looking back at the options: A:19, B:11, C:12, D:9, E:3, F:17.

So the unqualified articles in the options are D (9) and E (3). Therefore, the answer would be D and E.

But the question is presented as a multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is both D and E. However, since the user's example answer is a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is E (Article 3).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, as it's a clear example of an unqualified right.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to confirm. In the ECHR, the absolute rights are:

- Article 2: Right to life.

- Article 3: Prohibition of torture.

- Article 4: Prohibition of slavery.

- Article 5: Right to liberty and security (this is similar to Article 9 in the UDHR).

Wait, no, in ECHR, Article 5 is about freedom from arbitrary arrest, which is similar to Article 9 in the UDHR. So perhaps in the context of the question, the articles are from the UDHR.

Wait, the question doesn't specify which convention, but assuming it's the UDHR.

In UDHR, qualified vs. unqualified rights: some rights are considered non-derogable, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to whether the rights are absolute or can be limited.

In the UDHR, all rights are considered important, but some are more fundamental. However, the concept of qualified and unqualified rights is more commonly associated with the ECHR.

In the ECHR, the absolute rights are Articles 2, 3, and 4. So in the options, E is Article 3, which is absolute, and D is Article 9 UDHR, which corresponds to ECHR Article 5, which is also absolute.

So the correct answer would be D and E, as both are absolute (unqualified) rights.

But the question is asking which are not qualified, so the answer would be D and E.

However, the way the options are presented, each is a separate choice, so perhaps the user is expecting multiple selections, but the example answer is a single letter. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for one example.

But in the given options, both D and E are correct. So perhaps the answer is both D and E.

But the user's instruction is to reply with the letter. So perhaps the correct answer is E, as it's a clear example.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is E.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it differently. The user's question is to select the article that is not a qualified right, i.e., an unqualified right. From the options, both D (9) and E (3) are unqualified.

But perhaps the question is which one of the following is not qualified, implying that only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for all that apply.

But in the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is E, as it's a clear example of an unqualified right.

The question asks which of the listed articles are not qualified rights, meaning they are absolute and unqualified. From the analysis, Articles 3 and 9 are absolute rights, making them unqualified. However, since the example answer format expects a single letter, the most straightforward correct answer is:

Answer: E
