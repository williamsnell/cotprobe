Okay, so I've got this question about which muscle is most active during a right lateral excursion of the mandible. Hmm. Let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my craniofacial muscles, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to remember what a lateral excursion of the mandible means. Lateral excursion refers to moving the jaw to the side, like when you chew food and move your jaw from left to right. So a right lateral excursion would be moving the lower jaw to the right side.

Now, the mandible is the lower jaw, and its movement is controlled by several muscles. The main muscles involved in jaw movement are the masseter, temporalis, buccinator, and the pterygoid muscles (medial and lateral). 

I remember that during lateral movements, the pterygoid muscles are particularly important. The lateral pterygoid muscles are the main ones involved in side-to-side movements. Specifically, the right lateral pterygoid would help move the mandible to the right, and the left one would help when moving to the left.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about which part of the pterygoid does what. The lateral pterygoid has two parts: the superior part is involved in opening the mouth, and the inferior part is involved in lateral movements. So when moving the mandible to the right, the right lateral pterygoid's inferior head would contract to pull the mandible in that direction.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A to J. Option E is the right lateral pterygoid muscle. That seems to fit because it's the one active when moving the mandible to the right.

Wait, but what about the other muscles? The masseter is mainly for closing the mouth, like clenching the teeth. The temporalis also helps in closing. The buccinator is more involved in facial movements like blowing or smiling, but also helps in moving the jaw a bit, especially when chewing.

So during a lateral excursion to the right, the right lateral pterygoid would be the most active. The other muscles might be assisting, but the primary one is the right lateral pterygoid. So the answer must be E.

The correct answer is E: Right lateral pterygoid muscle.
