Okay, so I've got this question here about US adults and their beliefs regarding whether computer programs will always reflect human bias. The question is asking for the percentage as of 2018, and the options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 25% up to 90%. 

First, I need to think about what the question is really getting at. It's about the perception of AI and technology. Specifically, it's about whether people think that computer programs can't avoid reflecting human biases. So, it's a question about public opinion on AI ethics.

I remember that in recent years, there's been a lot of discussion about AI bias. Issues like facial recognition systems showing bias against certain groups, or algorithms used in hiring that might inadvertently favor certain candidates. So, the idea that AI can be biased is a real concern, and I think the general public might be aware of this.

Now, I'm trying to recall if there were any surveys or studies done around 2018 that measured public opinion on this. I think the Pew Research Center does surveys on technology issues, so maybe they have some data. Alternatively, maybe it was covered in articles about AI and society.

I remember reading that a significant majority of people believe that AI systems can be biased, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact percentage. Let me think through the options. The options are 25%, 73%, 58%, 66%, 88%, 90%, 48%, 43%, 33%, and 78%. 

Looking at these, 25% seems low. I don't think only a quarter of adults would believe that. Similarly, 33% is also on the lower side. The higher percentages like 73%, 78%, 88%, and 90% seem more plausible if there's widespread concern. 

I think I've heard that around 70% or so of people believe that AI has biases. Let me see, 73% is option B, and 78% is option J. Which one is more accurate?

Wait, I think a study from around 2018 or shortly after found that a majority, like over 70%, believe AI can be biased. Maybe it was around 73%. Alternatively, I've heard that about 70% of people are concerned about AI making errors or being biased, but I'm not sure if that's the exact figure.

Another angle: sometimes in surveys, the wording can affect the result. The question here is about whether computer programs "will always reflect human bias." So it's a bit stronger than just sometimes being biased. It's about always reflecting bias, which might be a slightly different question.

I'm trying to remember if any specific report mentioned this. Maybe the 2018 report from Pew or another organization. I think I've come across a statistic where a significant majority, like over 60%, agreed that AI systems are biased. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number.

Wait, I think it was around 73%. That's option B. Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I'm not entirely sure. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe looking at other similar questions or related data.

Alternatively, maybe the percentage is lower, like around 48% or 58%. But I feel like the belief that AI is biased is more widespread than that. So, 58% is option C, and 66% is D. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes these surveys can vary based on the wording. If the question is about whether AI can be biased at all, a higher percentage would agree. But if it's about whether they will always reflect bias, that might be a slightly different number.

I think I've read that a majority, perhaps around 73%, believe that AI systems are biased. So, that would point me towards option B: 73%. Alternatively, another source might have a different number. 

I'm trying to remember if it's 73% or 78%. Maybe I can think of other contexts where these numbers came up. For example, in discussions about facial recognition technology, a lot of people are concerned about bias, and that might influence their views on AI in general.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is lower. Maybe 58% is the number. I'm getting a bit confused now. Let me try to think of any specific reports. I think a study by MIT or another tech institution found that a significant majority of people believe AI has biases. I'm going to go with 73% as the answer, which is option B.

The question asks about the percentage of US adults who believe computer programs will always reflect human bias as of 2018. Considering the context of AI bias discussions and recalling surveys, a significant majority, around 73%, likely holds this belief. 

Answer: B
