Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. Hmm, okay, so we have a laboratory wind tunnel with an axial-flow fan. The fan is producing an air velocity of 65 feet per second (fps) at the test section when it's driven by a 3-horsepower (hp) motor running at 1200 revolutions per minute (rpm). The question is asking what motor speed and power would be needed to increase the velocity to 100 fps.

Okay, first, I think I need to understand the relationship between the motor's speed and the air velocity it produces. Since it's an axial-flow fan, I believe the air velocity is directly proportional to the fan's speed. So if the motor speed increases, the air velocity should increase by the same factor.

Let me write down what I have:
- Initial velocity (V1) = 65 fps
- Initial speed (N1) = 1200 rpm
- Desired velocity (V2) = 100 fps
- Desired speed (N2) = ?

Since V is proportional to N, I can set up the ratio: V2/V1 = N2/N1.

Plugging in the numbers:
100 / 65 = N2 / 1200

Let me calculate 100 divided by 65. 65 times 1.5 is 97.5, so 100/65 is approximately 1.5385. So N2 = 1200 * 1.5385 ≈ let's see, 1200 * 1.5 is 1800, and 1200 * 0.0385 is about 46.2. So adding them together gives approximately 1846.2 rpm. So around 1846 rpm. Looking at the options, option D is 1846 rpm. That's one part done.

Now, the power part. Motor power relates to both speed and the work done. Since power is force times velocity, and for a fan, I think the power needed depends on the cube of the speed ratio, assuming that the density and pressure are constant, but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the power required to do the work.

Wait, but actually, for similar operations (like similar Reynolds numbers or something), the power required scales with the cube of the speed. Or maybe it's the cube of the velocity ratio. Let me think.

Power (P) is related to velocity (V) and the mass flow rate (m_dot), and the pressure rise (ΔP). But maybe a simpler approach is to consider that when you change the speed, the power needed changes with the cube of the speed ratio. Because power is force times velocity, and force is related to pressure, which depends on velocity squared. So P is proportional to V^3.

Alternatively, since the fan is a device that, for a given flow coefficient, the power required increases with the cube of the speed. So, if the speed increases by a factor k, the power increases by k^3.

Wait, but another way: since power is in horsepower, and the initial power is 3 hp at 1200 rpm for 65 fps. We found N2 is about 1846 rpm, so the speed ratio k is 1846 / 1200 ≈ 1.5385.

So the power required would be P2 = P1 * (k)^3.

Let me calculate k^3: 1.5385^3. Let's compute step by step. 1.5^3 is 3.375. But since it's a bit more than 1.5, maybe around 3.6 or so.

Wait, 1.5385 is approximately 1.538. Let me compute 1.538^3.

1.538 * 1.538 = let's see, 1.5 *1.5 is 2.25, 1.5*0.038 is 0.057, and 0.038*1.5 is 0.057, and 0.038^2 is ~0.00144. So adding up: 2.25 + (0.057 +0.057) +0.00144 = 2.25 + 0.114 + 0.00144 ≈ 2.3654. So that's (1.538)^2 ≈ 2.3654.

Now multiply by 1.538 again: 2.3654 * 1.538.

Let me compute 2 *1.538 = 3.076, 0.3654 *1.538 ≈ 0.562 (since 0.3*1.538=0.4614, 0.0654*1.538≈0.1007, so total ≈0.5621). So total is approximately 3.076 + 0.5621 ≈ 3.638.

So the power factor is about 3.638.

So initial power is 3 hp. So P2 = 3 * 3.638 ≈ 10.914 hp, which is approximately 10.9 hp.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1846 rpm and 10.9 hp. That matches both the speed and the power.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another approach: power is proportional to (V)^3, since P = (1/2) * rho * A * V^3 * efficiency, assuming efficiency is constant. So if V increases by a factor of k, power increases by k^3.

So k = V2/V1 = 100/65 ≈ 1.5385.

So P2 = P1 * k^3 = 3 * (1.5385)^3 ≈ 3 * (3.638) ≈ 10.91 hp.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D: 1846 rpm and 10.9 hp.
</think>

The axial-flow fan's air velocity is directly proportional to the motor speed. To increase the velocity from 65 fps to 100 fps, the speed ratio is \( \frac{100}{65} \approx 1.5385 \). Thus, the new speed is \( 1200 \times 1.5385 \approx 1846 \) rpm. 

Power is proportional to the cube of the speed ratio. Calculating \( (1.5385)^3 \approx 3.638 \), the new power required is \( 3 \times 3.638 \approx 10.9 \) hp. 

The correct option is **D: 1846 rpm and 10.9 hp**.
