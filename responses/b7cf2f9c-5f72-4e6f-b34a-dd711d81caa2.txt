Question:

The world's total reserve of coal and natural gas is estimated to be equivalent to 3.0 × 10^19 Kcal. The world's present consumption of these fuels is 4.2 × 102 7ergs/year. At this rate of consumption, how long will the fuel reserves last?

Options:

A: 200 years
B: 250 years
C: 500 years
D: 400 years
E: 700 years
F: 100 years
G: 600 years
H: 350 years
I: 300 years
J: 800 years

Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out how long the world's coal and natural gas reserves will last based on current consumption rates. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem states that the total reserve is 3.0 × 10^19 Kcal. Wait, Kcal is kilocalories, right? And the consumption is 4.2 × 10^27 ergs per year. Hmm, I need to find the time these reserves will last, so I think I should divide the total energy by the annual consumption. But before that, I need to make sure the units match, so I'll convert one to match the other.

Let me recall the conversion factors. I remember that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. But wait, here we're dealing with kilocalories and ergs. Oh right, 1 Kcal is 1000 calories, so that's 1000 * 4.184 joules, which is 4184 joules. Alternatively, since 1 calorie is 4.184 J, 1 Kcal is 4184 J.

And what about ergs? I think 1 erg is 1e-7 joules because the erg is a smaller unit. So, 1 erg = 1e-7 J. Therefore, to convert ergs to joules, I can multiply by 1e-7.

So, let's convert the reserve from Kcal to joules. 

3.0 × 10^19 Kcal * 4184 J/Kcal = ?

Let me calculate that. 3e19 * 4184. 3 * 4184 is about 12,552, so 12,552 × 10^19 J. Wait, that's 1.2552 × 10^23 J.

Now, the consumption is 4.2 × 10^27 ergs per year. Let's convert that to joules. Since 1 erg is 1e-7 J, 4.2e27 ergs is 4.2e27 * 1e-7 J. That would be 4.2e20 J per year.

Wait, no: 4.2e27 * 1e-7 = 4.2e(27-7) = 4.2e20 J/year.

Now, to find how many years the reserves last, I divide total energy by annual consumption.

So, time = (1.2552e23 J) / (4.2e20 J/year) = (1.2552 / 4.2) * 1e3 years.

Calculating 1.2552 / 4.2. Let's see, 4.2 * 0.3 is 1.26, which is just a bit more than 1.2552. So, 0.3 approximately. So 0.3 * 1e3 = 300 years. That would be option I: 300 years.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I'm a bit concerned about exponents.

Wait, 3e19 Kcal is 3e19 * 4184 J = 3 * 4184 = 12,552, so 1.2552e23 J. Correct.

Consumption: 4.2e27 ergs/year. Each erg is 1e-7 J, so 4.2e27 * 1e-7 = 4.2e20 J/year. Yes, that's correct.

So, 1.2552e23 / 4.2e20 = (1.2552 / 4.2) * 1e3.

1.2552 / 4.2: Let me compute that more accurately. 4.2 * 0.298 is about 1.2516. So approximately 0.298, which is about 0.3. So 0.3 * 1e3 is 300 years.

So the answer should be I: 300 years.

To determine how long the world's coal and natural gas reserves will last at the current consumption rate, we need to calculate the total energy available and divide it by the annual energy consumption.

1. **Convert the total reserve from kilocalories (Kcal) to joules (J):**
   - 1 Kcal = 4184 J
   - Total reserve: \(3.0 \times 10^{19} \, \text{Kcal} \times 4184 \, \text{J/Kcal} = 1.2552 \times 10^{23} \, \text{J}\)

2. **Convert annual consumption from ergs to joules:**
   - 1 erg = \(1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{J}\)
   - Annual consumption: \(4.2 \times 10^{27} \, \text{ergs/year} \times 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{J/erg} = 4.2 \times 10^{20} \, \text{J/year}\)

3. **Calculate the duration the reserves will last:**
   - Time: \(\frac{1.2552 \times 10^{23} \, \text{J}}{4.2 \times 10^{20} \, \text{J/year}} = \frac{1.2552}{4.2} \times 10^{3} \, \text{years} \approx 300 \, \text{years}\)

Thus, the fuel reserves will last approximately **300 years**.
