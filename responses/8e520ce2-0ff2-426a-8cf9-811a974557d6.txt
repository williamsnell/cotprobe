Question:

A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe jaw pain since undergoing a painful dental procedure 1 day ago. The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?

Options:

A: Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine
B: Interference from the dental procedure
C: Insufficient dosage of codeine prescribed by the dentist
D: Allergic reaction to codeine preventing pain relief
E: Resistance to codeine developed over time
F: Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine
G: Overuse of codeine leading to tolerance
H: Deficiency of κ receptors
I: Decreased absorption of codeine

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient who's not getting pain relief from codeine after a dental procedure. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The patient is a 54-year-old woman who had a dental procedure and now has severe jaw pain. She was given codeine and told to take it every 4 hours. But even though she's been following that, she's still in pain. Plus, other family members have also had issues with codeine not working well for them. So, the question is asking why the codeine isn't working.

First, I need to think about how codeine works. Codeine is an opioid, right? It's converted in the body to morphine, which binds to opioid receptors to relieve pain. So, if it's not working, maybe something is wrong with how her body processes it or how the drug is getting into her system.

Looking at the options:

A: Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine. Wait, codeine is metabolized into morphine, which does bind to receptors. If more codeine is bound to proteins, would that affect its availability? I'm not sure. Maybe if the binding is increased, less morphine would be available because it's stuck to proteins. But I'm not certain about this.

B: Interference from the dental procedure. The procedure was yesterday, and now she's in pain. Maybe the dentist's work is still causing issues, but the question says she's adhering to the codeine regimen. I'm not sure if the procedure itself would cause the codeine to fail. Maybe if she's having more inflammation or something, but that's more about the pain itself, not the medication's effectiveness.

C: Insufficient dosage. She was prescribed codeine, but maybe the dose isn't high enough. But the question says she's taking it as directed every 4 hours. If the dose was too low, that could be an issue, but the question doesn't specify the dosage. Plus, other family members also had poor pain control, which might suggest it's not just the dose but something else.

D: Allergic reaction. An allergic reaction would probably have other symptoms, like a rash or trouble breathing. If it's an allergic reaction, she might not get the pain relief because the drug isn't working, but I'm not sure if that's the most common reason for failure. Also, the question doesn't mention any allergic symptoms.

E: Resistance to codeine. I'm not sure about opioid resistance. Opioid tolerance can develop, but resistance isn't a term I'm too familiar with in this context. Maybe this is more about tolerance leading to needing higher doses, but the question says she's taking it as prescribed. Plus, the family members also had issues, which might point away from individual tolerance.

F: Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine. Oh, wait. Codeine is metabolized in the liver by enzymes like CYP3A4 to morphine. If her metabolism is slow, less morphine would be produced, making the pain relief weaker. Alternatively, if she's a rapid metabolizer, maybe she's getting too much, but that's probably less likely. But if she's not converting enough, the codeine wouldn't work well. Also, if family members have the same issue, maybe it's a genetic factor affecting enzyme levels. That sounds plausible.

G: Overuse leading to tolerance. If she's taking it too much, her body might build tolerance, but the question says she's taking it every 4 hours as instructed. Unless the prescribed dose isn't enough, but I'm not sure if overuse is the case here. Plus, the family members also had issues, so it's probably not just her.

H: Deficiency of κ receptors. Opioids like morphine bind to μ receptors more than κ, but if there were a deficiency in κ receptors, would that affect pain relief? I'm not too sure. Maybe, but I don't recall this being a common reason for codeine failure.

I: Decreased absorption. If she's not absorbing codeine well, maybe from gut issues or something, but the question doesn't mention any GI problems. Also, if absorption was a problem, maybe she'd have fluctuating pain levels, but she's been consistent in taking it.

So, putting it together. The most likely options seem to be C, F, or G. But the question says she's been taking it as instructed, so maybe the problem isn't with her taking it wrong. The fact that other family members also had poor pain control suggests a genetic factor. So, if codeine is metabolized into morphine via a specific enzyme, and if she (and her family) have a deficiency in that enzyme, then codeine wouldn't work well. That would explain why despite taking it as prescribed, the pain isn't controlled. So, decreased metabolism (option F) could be the reason. Alternatively, if they're slow metabolizers, less morphine is produced, so the pain isn't adequately treated.

Another angle: codeine is converted to morphine, and if the conversion is slow, the active drug isn't present in sufficient amounts. So, the answer might be F.

Wait, but the options are A to I. Let me check again:

Option F: Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine. That seems correct because if the conversion is slow, less morphine is available to relieve pain. If the family has the same issue, it's likely a genetic polymorphism affecting enzyme activity.

So, the most likely answer is F.
</think>

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with severe jaw pain following a dental procedure, despite adhering to a prescribed codeine regimen. The failure of codeine to relieve pain, coupled with similar issues in her family, suggests a systemic or genetic factor. Codeine's effectiveness depends on its conversion to morphine via the CYP3A4 enzyme. If the patient has decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine due to a genetic polymorphism affecting enzyme activity, the conversion would be slower, resulting in insufficient morphine production and inadequate pain relief. This explanation aligns with the fact that other family members also experienced poor pain control, indicating a hereditary predisposition. Therefore, the most likely reason for the therapeutic failure is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine.

Answer: F
