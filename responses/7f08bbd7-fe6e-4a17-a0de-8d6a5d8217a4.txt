Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about vapor pressures of solvents in an ideal solution. Hmm, I remember that when two solvents mix ideally, their vapor pressures follow Raoult's Law. Let me think about what that entails.

The problem says Solvent A has a vapor pressure of 345 torr, and Solvent B has 213 torr at the same temperature. The mixture has a mole fraction of A as 0.285. I need to find the vapor pressure of this mixture.

Wait, Raoult's Law states that the partial vapor pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction in the solution multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. Oh right, and the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each component.

So, the formula should be P_total = X_A * P_A^0 + X_B * P_B^0. But wait, X_A is given as 0.285, so X_B would be 1 - 0.285, which is 0.715.

Let me plug in the numbers. So, P_A would be 0.285 * 345 torr. Let me calculate that. 0.285 times 345... Hmm, 0.2 times 345 is 69, 0.08 times 345 is 27.6, 0.005 times 345 is 1.725. Adding those together: 69 + 27.6 is 96.6, plus 1.725 is 98.325 torr.

Now for P_B: 0.715 * 213 torr. Okay, 0.7 times 213 is 149.1, 0.015 times 213 is about 3.195. Adding them gives 149.1 +3.195 = 152.295 torr.

Adding both partial pressures: 98.325 + 152.295 equals 250.62 torr. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is E: 251 torr.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. For X_A * P_A: 0.285 * 345. Let me compute 345 * 0.285. 345*0.2 is 69, 345*0.08 is 27.6, and 345*0.005 is 1.725. So 69+27.6+1.725 is indeed 98.325.

Next, 0.715 * 213. Let me do it another way: 213 * 0.7 is 149.1, 213 * 0.015 is 3.195. So 149.1 +3.195 is 152.295. Adding to 98.325 gives 250.62, which rounds to approximately 251. So the correct answer is E.

The vapor pressure of the mixture is calculated using Raoult's Law, where the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each component. For solvent A, the partial pressure is \( P_A = X_A \cdot P_A^0 = 0.285 \cdot 345 = 98.325 \) torr. For solvent B, the partial pressure is \( P_B = X_B \cdot P_B^0 = 0.715 \cdot 213 = 152.295 \) torr. Adding these gives the total vapor pressure \( P_{\text{total}} = 98.325 + 152.295 = 250.62 \) torr, which rounds to 251 torr.

Answer: E
