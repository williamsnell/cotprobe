Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Berkeley synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The question is about calculating the percentage increase in the proton mass due to relativistic effects. 

Alright, let's start by understanding what's given. The proton is accelerated to a kinetic energy of 5.4 x 10^-11 J, and its speed is about 2 x 10^8 m/s. Wait, but wait—protons have a rest mass, and when they're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases. So the problem is asking for the percentage increase in mass compared to their rest mass.

I think the formula for relativistic mass is m = gamma * m0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). But wait, do I need to use the kinetic energy here? Because the kinetic energy given might relate to the total energy, which is gamma*m0*c². 

Wait, the kinetic energy (K) is given by (gamma - 1) * m0 * c². So I can use that to find gamma. Let me write that down. 

K = (gamma - 1) * m0 c². I can rearrange this to find gamma: gamma = (K/(m0 c²)) + 1.

Alternatively, I could calculate gamma using the velocity since I have v. But I'm not sure if the speed given is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: the speed v is 2e8 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v is about 2/3 c. That's a significant fraction, so relativistic effects are definitely important here. 

Wait, but the problem says the speed is about 2e8 m/s, which is 2/3 c. So maybe using v is easier. Alternatively, perhaps using the kinetic energy is more straightforward. Let's think about which approach is better.

Let me first compute gamma using velocity. The speed v is 2e8 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So beta (β) is v/c = (2e8)/(3e8) = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me compute beta squared: (2/3)^2 = 4/9 ≈ 0.4444. So 1 - 0.4444 is 0.5556. The square root of that is sqrt(0.5556) ≈ 0.7454. So gamma is 1 / 0.7454 ≈ 1.3416.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. So 1 - (4/9) is 5/9, which is approximately 0.5556. The square root of (5/9) is sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 2.236/3 ≈ 0.745. So 1/0.745 is about 1.342. So gamma is approximately 1.342.

So the relativistic mass is gamma times m0. So the mass increase is gamma - 1, which is 0.342, or 34.2% increase. Looking at the options, D is 34 per cent. But wait, let me check if this approach is correct because maybe I should use the kinetic energy instead.

Alternatively, using the kinetic energy. The rest mass of a proton is m0 c² ≈ 938 MeV, but in joules it's about 1.67e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 = 1.5e-10 J. Wait, wait, let me compute m0 c² properly.

m0 is the rest mass of the proton, which is approximately 1.67 x 10^-27 kg. c is 3e8 m/s. So m0 c² = (1.67e-27 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) = 1.503e-10 J. 

The kinetic energy K is given as 5.4e-11 J. So using the formula K = (gamma - 1) m0 c², we can solve for gamma.

So gamma = (K/(m0 c²)) + 1. Plugging in the numbers:

K = 5.4e-11 J, m0 c² = 1.503e-10 J.

So K/(m0 c²) ≈ (5.4e-11)/(1.503e-10) ≈ 0.359. So gamma ≈ 0.359 + 1 = 1.359.

Wait, so gamma is about 1.359. Then the mass increase is gamma -1, which is 0.359 or 35.9%, which would be approximately 36%, but the options don't have that. The closest option is D: 34 per cent.

But wait, earlier when I calculated using v, I got gamma as about 1.342, which is a 34.2% increase. So that would align with option D.

Wait, but the K approach gave me a slightly higher gamma, around 1.359, leading to a 35.9% increase. But the options don't have 36%. So perhaps using the velocity approach is more accurate here because the speed is given, and the kinetic energy is a result of that speed.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the velocity approach since it's given directly. Let me think: when the speed is given, the gamma calculated from velocity is perhaps more accurate. But why is there a discrepancy between the two methods?

Wait, perhaps because the kinetic energy given is the actual kinetic energy, so using K to find gamma is more precise here. Let me double-check both methods.

First method (using v):

v = 2e8 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

beta = v/c = 2/3 → 0.6667.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (4/9)) = 1/sqrt(5/9) = 3/sqrt(5) ≈ 3/2.236 ≈ 1.3416.

So mass increase is 1.3416 -1 = 0.3416 → 34.16%, so about 34%, which is option D.

Second method (using K):

Compute gamma using K = (gamma -1) m0 c².

K =5.4e-11 J, m0 c²=1.503e-10 J.

So K/(m0 c²) = (5.4e-11)/(1.503e-10) ≈ 0.359. So gamma = 1.359.

Mass increase is 0.359 → 35.9%, which is about 36%, but that's not an option.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy? Oh wait, perhaps the kinetic energy given includes relativistic effects, so the calculation using K would be more appropriate, but the options don't have 36%. Alternatively, perhaps the speed given is an approximation, and the exact gamma from the speed is more accurate.

Wait, perhaps the speed given is approximate, so using the speed to compute gamma is more accurate. Let me recalculate using more precise numbers.

Compute beta = 2e8 /3e8 = 2/3 = 0.666666...

beta squared is (4/9) = 0.444444...

1 - beta squared = 0.555555...

sqrt(0.555555) is approximately 0.7453559925.

gamma = 1 / 0.7453559925 ≈ 1.341640786.

So the mass increase is 0.341640786, which is approximately 34.16% → 34.2%, so 34% when rounded.

Looking back at the options, D is 34 per cent. So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves calculating the percentage increase in the relativistic mass of a proton accelerated to a speed of \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), which is approximately \( \frac{2}{3} \) the speed of light (\( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)). Relativistic mass is given by \( m = \gamma m_0 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). 

First, calculate \( \beta = v/c = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \). Then, \( \beta^2 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \approx 0.4444 \). Using the formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.4444}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.5556}} \approx \frac{1}{0.7454} \approx 1.3416.
\]

The relativistic mass increase is \( \gamma - 1 \), which is \( 1.3416 - 1 = 0.3416 \), or approximately \( 34.16\% \). Rounding to the nearest option, the percentage increase is \( 34\% \).
