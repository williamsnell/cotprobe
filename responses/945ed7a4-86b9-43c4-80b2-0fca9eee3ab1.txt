Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Second Agricultural Revolution. I remember from my history class that there were a few agricultural revolutions, and each had different causes and effects. Let me think about each option to see which one makes the most sense.

The question is asking for a chief factor that contributed to the Second Agricultural Revolution. First, I need to recall what the Second Agricultural Revolution was about. I think it was a period in the 18th and 19th centuries, right after the First Agricultural Revolution, which was more about the transition from nomadic life to farming.

Looking at the options:

A: the discovery of the plow. Well, the plow is an ancient tool, so that's probably from the First Agricultural Revolution. It's not the main factor for the second one.

B: the invention of electricity. Hmm, electricity was developed more in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I'm not sure how much it directly contributed to the Second Agricultural Revolution, which was earlier.

C: the Renaissance. The Renaissance was a period of cultural and scientific rebirth in the 14th to 17th centuries. It did contribute to some agricultural advancements, but was it the main factor for the Second Revolution?

D: the invention of the internet. That's way too modern, definitely not related.

E: World War II. That was in the mid-20th century, so probably not connected.

F: the discovery of new continents. That was during the Age of Exploration, around the 15th to 17th centuries. While it opened up new trade routes and maybe new crops, I'm not sure if it's the main factor for the Second Revolution.

G: the French Revolution. That was in the late 18th century, around the same time as the start of the Industrial Revolution. Not sure how it ties into agriculture.

H: the Great Depression. That was in the 1930s, so probably not relevant.

I: World War I. Early 20th century, again not directly related to the Second Agricultural Revolution.

J: the Industrial Revolution. Wait, the Industrial Revolution did play a big role in changing agriculture. It introduced machinery like the steam engine, which could be used in farming. Also, industrial techniques improved agricultural efficiency. So I think J is a strong candidate.

Let me double-check. The Second Agricultural Revolution is often linked with the development of new farming techniques, machinery, and the use of technology. The Industrial Revolution provided the technological advancements that made this possible. So yeah, the Industrial Revolution was a major contributing factor.

The Second Agricultural Revolution was significantly influenced by technological advancements, particularly those from the Industrial Revolution, which introduced machinery and improved farming techniques. 

Answer: J
