Question:

A first-grade teacher is planning activities to introduce students to nonstandard units of measurement. Which of the following activities will best meet the teacher's goal?

Options:

A: Asking students to use pencils to measure the length of a desk
B: Asking students to use a digital scale to weigh their lunch box
C: Asking students to use a measuring tape to measure the length of the classroom door
D: Asking students to use a ruler to measure the length of a book
E: Asking students to determine how many one-liter bottles of water can fill a onegallon container
F: Asking students to stand in a line, from the shortest person to the tallest

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which activity is best for introducing first-grade students to nonstandard units of measurement. Let me think about what nonstandard units mean. Nonstandard units are things like using everyday objects to measure instead of rulers or scales. Like, using a pencil or a shoe as a unit to measure length.

The question is asking which activity would best meet the teacher's goal of introducing nonstandard units. So I need to look at each option and see which one uses nonstandard units.

Option A: Using pencils to measure the desk. Pencils are not standard units, so this is nonstandard. That sounds good.

Option B: Using a digital scale to weigh lunch boxes. Digital scales use standard units like grams or pounds, so this is standard, not nonstandard.

Option C: Using a measuring tape for the classroom door. Measuring tapes have standard units, like centimeters or inches, so this is standard.

Option D: Using a ruler to measure a book. Rulers are standard tools, so this is standard measurement.

Option E: Determining how many one-liter bottles fill a gallon container. Liters and gallons are standard units, so this is standard.

Option F: Standing in a line from shortest to tallest. This is about ordering by height, not measuring in units, so it's not about measurement at all.

So the only option that uses nonstandard units is A, where pencils are used as the measuring tool. That makes sense because pencils are objects kids can relate to, and it's a hands-on activity that introduces the concept without relying on standard tools.

The best activity for introducing nonstandard units of measurement is Option A, as it uses pencils, a nonstandard tool, to measure the desk. This hands-on approach helps students understand measurement concepts using familiar objects.

Answer: A
