Okay, so I have this question about the number of electrons, neutrons, and protons in an atom of Chromium-52, right? I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the periodic table gives us the atomic number and the atomic mass. The atomic number is the number of protons, and the atomic mass is the sum of protons and neutrons. So, for Chromium, the symbol is Cr. I think the atomic number of Chromium is 24 because I remember that the sequence around that area... like, Vanadium is 23, then Chromium is 24. So protons would be 24.

Now, the atom is 52Cr, which means the atomic mass is 52. Since atomic mass equals protons plus neutrons, I can subtract the protons to find neutrons. So 52 minus 24 equals 28. That would make the number of neutrons 28.

As for electrons, I remember that in a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. So if protons are 24, electrons should also be 24.

Wait, but looking at the options, I should double-check. Let me go through each option:

Option A: 28 electrons, 27 protons, 24 neutrons. No, protons should be 24, so this is wrong.

Option B: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 27 neutrons. Wait, 24 protons and 27 neutrons adds to 51, not 52. So that's incorrect.

Option C: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 24 neutrons. Protons plus neutrons would be 48, which is less than 52. Nope.

Option D: 24 electrons, 28 protons, 28 neutrons. Protons should be 24, so this is out.

Option E: 28 electrons, 24 protons, 24 neutrons. Electrons are 28, which would mean a +4 charge, but since it's a neutral atom, electrons should match protons. So this is wrong.

Option F: 24 electrons, 28 protons, 24 neutrons. Again, protons are 28, which isn't right. So no.

Option G: 27 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. Electrons don't match protons. So no.

Option H: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. Wait, wait, protons are 24, neutrons 28. 24+28=52, which matches the mass. Electrons are 24, which matches protons, so this should be correct. Hmm, that's option H.

Option I: 28 electrons, 28 protons, 24 neutrons. Protons are 28, which would make it another element. So wrong.

Option J: 27 electrons, 27 protons, 24 neutrons. Protons should be 24, so nope.

Wait, I thought I was confident, but I need to make sure I didn't mix up anything. So, Chromium is Cr, atomic number 24. So protons =24, electrons=24. Neutrons=52-24=28. So that's 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. Looking back at the options, that's option H.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, but the question is about 52Cr, which is the mass number, so the sum of protons and neutrons is 52. So yes, 24 protons and 28 neutrons. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons.

Answer: H
