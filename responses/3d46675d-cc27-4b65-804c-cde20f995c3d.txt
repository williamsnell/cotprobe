Question:

A writer sent a four-page synopsis of an idea for a new television series to a Hollywood producer. He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work." She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?

Options:

A: The court will rule that there can be no contract as the writer didn't explicitly state his expectation for compensation for the idea itself.
B: The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.
C: The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.
D: The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.
E: The court will rule that there was a unilateral contract, with the producer obligated to pay only if he used the idea.
F: The court will rule that the writer's case is invalid as there was no written agreement.
G: The court will rule that the producer's assistant lacked the authority to form a contract, and thus, no contract exists.
H: There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.
I: The court will rule that the phone call between the writer and the producer's assistant formed a verbal contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether there was a contract between the writer and the producer. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the situation: A writer sends a four-page synopsis to a Hollywood producer in response to an ad. He talks to the producer's assistant on the phone, and they discuss compensation. The assistant says they always pay for a writer's work and will show it to the boss. Months later, the writer sees a series that's similar to his idea and sues for breach of contract. The producer says there was no contract.

So, the main issue is whether a contract exists. For a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be offer, acceptance, consideration, mutual assent, and sometimes a written agreement depending on the laws, especially if it's for goods over a certain value, but in this case, it's about a creative idea, so maybe not UCC but common law.

Looking at the elements:

1. Offer and Acceptance: The writer sent the synopsis, which could be seen as an offer. The producer's assistant responded positively, suggesting acceptance. But was it a formal offer and acceptance?

2. Consideration: Both parties need to give something of value. The writer provided the idea, and the producer promised to pay. But the assistant said "we always pay for a writer's work," which is a bit vague. Did this constitute a promise that was part of the contract? Or was it too vague?

3. Mutual Assent: Did both parties agree to the terms? The phone call discussed compensation, so there was some discussion, but did they reach a mutual agreement? It seems like the assistant was just checking with the boss, not necessarily accepting the offer on behalf of the producer.

4. Written Agreement: Contracts for the sale of goods over $500 need to be in writing, but this is more about services or an idea, so maybe not required. But the assistant's statement might be enough for a verbal contract if it's within the statute of frauds.

But wait, the producer's assistant might not have the authority to form a contract. If she was just an assistant and not authorized to make binding agreements, then any statements she made might not be enforceable. That could be a problem for the writer's case.

Also, the assistant said she'd go over it with the boss. That sounds like she wasn't accepting the offer but was just passing it along. So maybe there was no acceptance yet, and thus no contract.

Looking at the options:

A: No contract because no explicit statement about compensation for the idea itself. But the assistant did mention payment, so maybe this isn't the reason.

B: Implied contract based on conduct. But the facts don't suggest an implied contract because the interactions were mostly discussions, not conduct indicating a contract.

C: No consideration because it was a gift. But the assistant's promise to pay seems like consideration, so maybe C isn't right.

D: Express contract because of meeting of minds. But if the assistant wasn't authorized, or if there was no clear acceptance, then D might not hold.

E: Unilateral contract, but that's when one party makes a promise in exchange for performance, which isn't exactly the case here. The writer didn't perform beyond sending the synopsis.

F: No written agreement. But many contracts don't need to be written unless under statute of frauds, which might not apply here.

G: Assistant lacked authority. This seems plausible because if she couldn't form a contract, even if she said they pay, it might not be binding.

H: Too indefinite. The terms might be too vague, but the assistant's statement about payment and the fact that the idea was used could make it specific enough.

I: Verbal contract via phone call. But if the assistant lacked authority, the verbal contract wouldn't be valid.

So, the key point is whether the assistant had the authority to form a contract. If not, then no contract exists. That would make option G the likely ruling.

The court will rule that there was no contract because the producer's assistant lacked the authority to form a contract, and thus, no contract exists.
