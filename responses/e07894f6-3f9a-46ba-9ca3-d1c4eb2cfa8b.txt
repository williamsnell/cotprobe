Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this Inca question. The question is asking about one of the less obvious reasons why the Inca fought so many wars. The options are A through E, each suggesting a different reason.

First, I remember that the Inca Empire was known for its expansionist policies. They conquered a lot of territories and built a vast empire. So, the most obvious reason for their wars would be to expand their territory, which is option B. But the question is about a less obvious reason, so I should look beyond the obvious.

Option A says they fought to demonstrate military prowess. That makes sense because many empires use military strength to intimidate others, but is that less obvious? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the primary reason.

Option C suggests they united their population through a common enemy. Hmm, the Inca had a large and diverse population. Maybe fighting wars helped them all come together against a shared threat, which could strengthen their empire internally. That seems plausible, but I'm not certain if that's a well-known reason.

Option D is about identifying and cultivating leaders. I recall that the Inca used conquered peoples to test their leadership skills, perhaps allowing promising individuals to rule conquered areas. So fighting wars might help in finding and developing talent. That sounds like a good point, but is it less obvious? I think it's more of a secondary reason.

Option E is gaining control of vital resources. The Inca needed resources for their economy and to support their population. Expanding through war would secure these resources. But again, this seems more like a straightforward reason, not necessarily less obvious.

So, considering all options, the question is about a less obvious reason. The Inca's expansion was a big part of their history, so B is more obvious. E is also a common reason for wars. A and C are possible, but I think C might be a better fit because uniting diverse groups through a common enemy could help maintain internal cohesion, which might be a less obvious strategy.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the Inca had a centralized system and used mita labor, which required a lot of people. Maybe they needed more resources and labor, so E is also a solid option. But since the question is about a less obvious reason, perhaps E is more about the immediate needs, while C is about internal management.

I'm a bit torn between A, C, and D. Maybe D is about leadership development, which is more strategic but not as commonly discussed. Or perhaps C, uniting the population, is the less obvious reason because it's about internal politics rather than expansion.

After thinking, I think the answer might be C: to unite their own population through a common enemy. Wars can create a sense of unity and purpose among the people, which might have been a key strategy for the Inca.

The Inca fought wars not only for expansion but also to unite their diverse population through a common enemy, fostering internal cohesion.
