Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about TV series and I need to figure out which one isn't set in the United States. The options are A through J, each with a different show. Let me go through each one and think about where they're set.

Starting with A: 'Grey's Anatomy'. I remember that this show is about doctors in a hospital, and I think it's set in Seattle. Seattle is definitely in the US, so A is set there.

B: 'Boston Legal'. The name suggests it's set in Boston, which is a major city in Massachusetts. So that's in the US too.

C: 'Breaking Bad'. This one's set in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Definitely a US city, so C is US-based.

D: 'Northern Exposure'. Hmm, I'm not as sure about this one. I think it's set in a small town, but I'm not certain if it's in the US or Canada. Wait, I think it's actually set in Alaska, which is a US state. So D is in the US.

E: 'The Paper Chase'. I believe this show is set in a law school, probably in the US. Maybe New York or some other city, but definitely the US.

F: 'Friends'. That's set in New York City, so definitely the US.

G: 'M*A*S*H'. This one's a bit tricky. I know M*A*S*H is a military hospital show, but wasn't it set during the Korean War? So the setting would be in Korea, not the US. So G is not set in the US.

H: 'Picket Fences'. I think this show is set in a small town in the US, maybe Texas. So H is in the US.

I: 'The X-Files'. This one is set all over the place, but primarily in the US. The main characters are FBI agents, so their cases take them around the country.

J: 'The West Wing'. That's set in Washington, D.C., which is in the US, focusing on the White House.

So, going through each option, the only one not set in the US is G: 'M*A*S*H', because it's set in Korea during the Korean War.

The correct answer is G: 'M*A*S*H', as it is set in Korea, not the United States.

Answer: G
