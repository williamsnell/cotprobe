Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about translating a formal proposition into English. The proposition is given in predicate logic, and I need to pick the correct interpretation from options A to J. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the proposition: (∀x)[Ax ⊃ (∃y)(Hy • Bxy)]. 

Breaking this down, ∀x is a universal quantifier meaning "for all x." Ax represents "x is an apartment." So the first part, ∀x Ax, would be "for all x, x is an apartment." But since it's followed by a conditional (⊃), the structure is "If x is an apartment, then..." 

The consequent is (∃y)(Hy • Bxy). ∃y is an existential quantifier meaning "there exists a y." Hy is "y is a house," and Bxy means "x is bigger than y." So putting it together, the consequent is "there exists a y such that y is a house and x is bigger than y."

So the entire proposition translates to: For all x, if x is an apartment, then there exists a y (a house) such that x is bigger than y. In simpler terms, every apartment is bigger than some house.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, for every apartment x, there's at least one house y that x is bigger than. That means each apartment is bigger than some house. So the statement is that every apartment is bigger than some house.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Some house is smaller than every apartment. → This would mean that there's a house y that's smaller than all apartments x. But the original says every apartment is bigger than some house, which is a bit different.

B: Every house is bigger than some apartment. → This would be ∀x Hy ⊃ (exists y) Ax • Bxy, which isn't what we have. Our proposition is about apartments being bigger than houses.

C: Some apartments are bigger than all houses. → This would mean there exists an apartment that's bigger than every house. But the original says for every apartment, there's some house it's bigger than. It doesn't say all houses are smaller than some apartment.

D: Some apartments are smaller than all houses. → Opposite of what we have. Our apartments are bigger than some houses, not smaller.

E: Some house is bigger than every apartment. → That would mean a house is bigger than all apartments, which isn't what the proposition says.

F: Every apartment is bigger than some house. → This seems to match. Because for every apartment x, there's a house y that x is bigger than. So every apartment is bigger than some house.

G: All apartments are smaller than some house. → This would mean that for every apartment, there's a house bigger than it, which is the opposite of F.

H: Every apartment is smaller than some house. → Same as G, so not correct.

I: All houses are smaller than some apartment. → This would mean every house is smaller than some apartment, which is similar but the structure is different. The original says every apartment is bigger than some house, which is the same as some house is smaller than every apartment. Wait, but option A says "some house is smaller than every apartment." Hmm, but the original is about every apartment being bigger than some house, which is a bit different.

Wait, let me clarify. The proposition is ∀x (Ax → ∃y (Hy ∧ Bxy)). So for every x that is an apartment, there exists a y that is a house, and x is bigger than y. So for each apartment, there's at least one house it's bigger than. So every apartment has at least one house it's bigger than. 

Option F says "Every apartment is bigger than some house," which matches exactly. So F is correct.

Wait, but let me check option E: Some house is bigger than every apartment. That would be ∃y (Hy ∧ ∀x Ax → Bxy). Which is not the same as our original statement. Our original is about each apartment having a bigger house, but E is about a single house being bigger than all apartments.

So yes, F is the correct interpretation.

The proposition states that for every apartment, there exists a house that it is bigger than. This corresponds to option F: Every apartment is bigger than some house.

F
