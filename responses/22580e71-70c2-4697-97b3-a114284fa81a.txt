Question:

Congress enacts a $100 tax on the sale of any handgun to a private individual not for use in law enforcement or military duties. Will this new handgun tax survive a constitutional challenge?

Options:

A: Yes, if the tax is applied uniformly across all states.
B: Yes, if Congress could have banned possession of handguns outright.
C: No, if the tax is seen as a way to indirectly ban handguns.
D: Yes, if the tax is used to fund law enforcement or military activities.
E: No, if the tax disproportionately affects individuals of lower income.
F: No, because the tax infringes on an individual's right to bear arms.
G: No, if the tax does not result in a significant collection of revenue.
H: No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.
I: Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.
J: Yes, if the tax is proportional to the cost of the handgun.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this new $100 tax on the sale of handguns to private individuals will survive a constitutional challenge. So, the question is about the constitutionality of this tax. I remember that the Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights, has certain amendments that could be relevant here.

First, I think about the Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms. But taxes are generally allowed unless they're a direct infringement on a constitutional right. So, the key here is whether the tax is constitutional under the taxing power of Congress, or if it's an unconstitutional use of that power.

I know that the Supreme Court has ruled on cases where the government imposes taxes that could be seen as targeting a specific group or activity. In some cases, if the primary purpose of the tax is not to raise revenue but to regulate or punish a certain behavior, it might be struck down. For example, in United States v. Lott, the court upheld a tax on certain firearms, but I think the reasoning was that the tax was a legitimate exercise of the taxing power, not aimed at infringing on the right to bear arms.

Looking at the options, I need to see which ones align with these principles. Option F says "No, because the tax infringes on an individual's right to bear arms." But I'm not sure if a tax alone infringes on the right. The Second Amendment doesn't explicitly prohibit taxes on arms; it's more about regulation. So F might not be correct unless the tax is seen as a penalty.

Option H says "No, if the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership." That sounds plausible because if the main goal of the tax is to discourage handgun sales rather than raise revenue, it could be unconstitutional. The courts have been wary of taxes that are a guise for regulation or prohibition.

Option C says "No, if the tax is seen as a way to indirectly ban handguns." That's similar to H. If the tax is so high that it effectively makes handgun sales unfeasible, it might be seen as a de facto ban. But the tax here is only $100, which might not be enough to have that effect, so maybe C isn't the best choice.

Option I says "Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue." This aligns with the idea that as long as the primary purpose is to raise revenue, it's constitutional. If Congress intended the tax to generate income, then it's likely to survive.

So, putting it together, the Supreme Court generally allows taxes as long as they are intended to raise revenue and aren't just a regulatory tool in disguise. If the tax's main purpose is revenue, it's constitutional. Therefore, the correct answer would be I, if the dominant intent was revenue.

The question revolves around whether a $100 tax on handgun sales to private individuals survives a constitutional challenge, particularly under the Second Amendment and the taxing power of Congress. The key consideration is whether the tax is a legitimate exercise of Congress's taxing authority or an unconstitutional infringement on the right to bear arms.

Option I is the correct answer because the Supreme Court generally upholds taxes as constitutional if their primary intent is to raise revenue, regardless of the policy's broader effects. If Congress's dominant purpose was to generate revenue, the tax is likely constitutional. Other options either misinterpret the constitutional balance or conflate tax purposes with regulatory overreach.

Answer: I
