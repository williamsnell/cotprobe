Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about springs and work done. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The problem says: A spring with force constant k is stretched a certain distance. It takes twice as much work to stretch a second spring by half this distance. I need to find the force constant of the second spring, and the options are from A to J.

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about springs and work. I remember that the work done to stretch a spring is related to the potential energy stored in it, right? The formula for elastic potential energy is (1/2)kx², where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

So the first spring has a force constant k and is stretched a certain distance. Let's call that distance x. The work done to stretch it would be W1 = (1/2)k x².

Now, the second spring is stretched by half that distance, so the displacement is x/2. The work done to stretch it is given as twice as much as the first. So W2 = 2 * W1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the problem again. It says it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance. So W2 = 2 * W1? Or is it that the second spring requires twice the work when stretched by half the distance?

Wait, the problem states that the work done on the second spring is twice that of the first. So W2 = 2 W1.

But wait, the first spring is stretched by x, and the second by x/2. So let's write that down.

W1 = (1/2) k x².

W2 = (1/2) k2 (x/2)². Because the second spring's force constant is k2, which is what we need to find.

But according to the problem, W2 = 2 W1. So substituting:

(1/2) k2 (x/2)² = 2 * (1/2) k x².

Let me simplify this equation. Let's compute each part.

First, expand (x/2)²: that's x²/4.

So the equation becomes:

(1/2) k2 (x²/4) = 2 * (1/2) k x².

Simplify the left side: (1/2) * k2 * x²/4 = (k2 x²) / 8.

On the right side: 2 * (1/2) k x² = (2/2) k x² = k x².

So the equation is:

(k2 x²) / 8 = k x².

Wait, both sides have x², so I can divide both sides by x², assuming x ≠ 0. That gives:

k2 / 8 = k.

Then, solving for k2: k2 = 8k.

Wait, that's 8 times k. So the second spring has a force constant of 8k.

Looking at the options, option A is 8k. So the answer should be A:8k.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes I might mix up the work done and the equations.

Wait, wait. Another way: W2 is twice the work done on the first spring. So W2 = 2 W1.

W1 = (1/2)k x².

W2 = (1/2)k2 (x/2)^2.

So (1/2)k2 (x²/4) = 2*(1/2)k x².

Multiply out:

k2 x² / 8 = k x².

Divide both sides by x²: k2/8 = k → k2=8k. Yep, that's correct.

So the second spring's constant is 8k. So the answer is A.

The work done to stretch a spring is given by the elastic potential energy formula \( W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \). For the first spring with constant \( k \), the work done is \( W_1 = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \). The second spring is stretched by half the distance, \( \frac{x}{2} \), and the work done is \( W_2 = \frac{1}{2}k_2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}k_2\frac{x^2}{4} \). According to the problem, \( W_2 = 2W_1 \). Substituting the expressions, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}k_2\frac{x^2}{4} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{k_2x^2}{8} = kx^2
\]

Dividing both sides by \( x^2 \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):

\[
\frac{k_2}{8} = k \implies k_2 = 8k
\]

Thus, the force constant of the second spring is \( 8k \).
