Okay, so I've got this question about the hygiene hypothesis and multiple-choice options. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember the hygiene hypothesis is related to why allergies have been increasing, especially in developed countries. It's something to do with cleanliness and how our immune systems develop.

The question says that smaller family sizes and better sanitary conditions have led to more allergic diseases. So, the hygiene hypothesis is trying to explain this. From what I've heard, the idea is that when we're too clean, our immune systems don't get exposed to enough germs or dirt, which might make them more likely to react to allergens.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this hypothesis. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Living on a working farm will increase the development of atopic diseases. Wait, atopic diseases are like allergies and asthma. But working farms have more exposure to various allergens and possibly more bacteria. I thought that being around animals and dirt could actually reduce allergies because the immune system gets trained. So maybe this isn't correct because it suggests farms increase atopic diseases, which seems opposite.

Option B: Particular care during breastfeeding for high-risk infants. I'm not sure how this ties in. Breastfeeding is generally good for the immune system, but I don't recall the hygiene hypothesis focusing on this specifically. Maybe it's a distractor.

Option C: Living on a working farm helps reduce atopic diseases. This seems more in line with what I was thinking earlier. Farms expose you to more allergens and possibly beneficial microbes, which might help prevent allergies. So this could be the correct answer.

Option D: Using antibiotics frequently reduces allergies. Hmm, antibiotics kill bacteria, but they can also disrupt the natural microbiome. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that reducing exposure to germs (like through antibiotics) might increase allergies. So using antibiotics more would probably increase, not reduce, allergies. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: Urban areas reduce atopic diseases. Wait, urban areas are more sanitized, have less exposure to nature, pets, and diverse microbes. So according to the hygiene hypothesis, urban living should increase allergies, not reduce them. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Frequent antiseptic swipes reduce allergies. Again, using antiseptics would mean more cleanliness, less exposure to germs. The hypothesis says this leads to more allergies, so F is likely incorrect.

Option G: Exposure to allergens in early childhood increases allergy risk. Wait, that seems opposite. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that exposure to allergens and germs early on can reduce the risk by building up immunity. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Staying in sanitized environments reduces atopic diseases. No, the hygiene hypothesis says that sanitized environments (like urban, clean homes) lead to more allergies because the immune system isn't challenged enough. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Breastfeeding should be avoided in high-risk infants. That doesn't make sense. Breastfeeding is recommended for building immunity. So I is likely wrong.

Option J: Probiotics increase atopic diseases. Wait, I think probiotics are supposed to help the immune system. Some studies suggest they might reduce allergies, so J seems incorrect.

So, going back, the correct answer should be C: Living on a working farm will help reduce the development of atopic diseases. Because farms expose kids to more dirt, animals, and diverse bacteria, which supports the immune system and reduces allergy development.

The hygiene hypothesis suggests that reduced exposure to germs and allergens in early childhood, due to cleaner living conditions, can increase the risk of developing allergic diseases. Working farms provide environments with greater exposure to diverse microbes and allergens, which can help train the immune system and reduce the likelihood of allergies. 

Answer: C
