Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
C: admissible as non-hearsay.
D: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
E: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
F: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
G: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
H: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
I: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I have this evidence question here about a car accident and a statement made by a pedestrian. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the scenario: a man and woman are in a car accident. The man switched lanes without signaling, causing the woman to hit his car into a median. Right after the accident, a pedestrian who saw it ran up and shouted at the man, calling him careless and saying he didn't use a turn signal. The pedestrian isn't identified and isn't at the trial.

The question is about whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible. The options are various rules of evidence, so I need to think about hearsay exceptions.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The pedestrian's statement is definitely hearsay because it's being offered to show that the man was careless (i.e., didn't use a turn signal), which is a fact at issue.

Now, the key is whether any exception applies. The options mention excited utterance, present sense impression, spontaneous statement, etc.

The pedestrian was emotional and upset right after the accident. That makes me think of the excited utterance exception under FRE 803(2). For that, the statement must be made under the stress of the event and relate to its circumstances. Here, the pedestrian just saw the accident, was emotional, and spoke immediately. So the statement likely qualifies as an excited utterance, making it admissible.

Another possibility is the present sense impression under FRE 803(1). That requires a statement describing an event made while the event was occurring or immediately thereafter. The pedestrian's statement was made as the drivers were emerging, so maybe it's a present sense impression. But excited utterance seems more applicable here because of the emotional state.

Looking at the options: B says excited utterance, E says present sense impression, I says spontaneous statement. Wait, spontaneous statement is a bit different. Spontaneous statements are under 803(3) but require the declarer's belief to be about a then-existing state of mind or emotion, and the event's circumstances. But excited utterances are a specific type of spontaneous statement. So maybe both B and I are applicable, but the options are separate.

The question is whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible. If it's an excited utterance, then B would be correct. Alternatively, if it's a present sense impression, E would be right. But excited utterance seems more fitting because of the emotional context right after the accident.

Now, looking at the options, B and E are both possibilities. But which one is correct? Well, the statement was made immediately after the accident, so both exceptions could apply, but excited utterance is typically broader in terms of stress and emotion.

Other options: Option D says admissible even though hearsay. That's not correct because it doesn't specify an exception. Option G says inadmissible because the bystander isn't identified and not present. But the rule doesn't require the declarant to be available; it's about the statement's reliability. So G is wrong.

So the correct exception is excited utterance, which is option B. Alternatively, I is spontaneous statement, but I think excited utterance is more precise here.

The pedestrian's statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception because it was made immediately after the accident while the declarant was still under the stress of the event. 

Answer: B
