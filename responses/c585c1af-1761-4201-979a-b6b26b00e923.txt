Okay, so I need to find the variance of a random variable X that's uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 3]. Hmm, I remember that for a uniform distribution, the variance has a specific formula. Let me think.

Wait, the uniform distribution over [a, b] has some standard properties. I think the mean is (a + b)/2. So in this case, a is 0 and b is 3, so the mean should be (0 + 3)/2 = 1.5. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, the question is about variance. I remember that variance for a uniform distribution is ( (b - a)^2 ) / 12. Let me make sure. Oh right, because variance measures how spread out the numbers are, and since the interval is from 0 to 3, the spread is 3 units. So the formula would give (3)^2 / 12, which is 9/12. Simplifying that, 9 divided by 12 is 3/4. Wait, no, 9/12 reduces to 3/4? Wait, 9 divided by 12 is 0.75, which is 3/4. So the variance is 3/4?

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to calculate variance is E[X²] minus (E[X])². So maybe I should compute it that way to confirm.

First, E[X] is the mean, which we already found as 1.5. Now, E[X²] for a uniform distribution on [a, b] is (b² + a² + ab) / 3. Let me plug in the values. a is 0, b is 3. So E[X²] = (9 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 9/3 = 3. Hmm, wait, is that right? Because when a is 0, the formula simplifies. Alternatively, maybe I should integrate x² from 0 to 3 and then divide by the length of the interval, which is 3.

So integrating x² from 0 to 3. The integral of x² is x³/3. Evaluated from 0 to 3 is (27/3) - 0 = 9. Then divide by the interval length 3: 9/3 = 3. So E[X²] is indeed 3.

Now, variance is E[X²] minus (E[X])². So that's 3 - (1.5)^2. 1.5 squared is 2.25. So 3 - 2.25 equals 0.75, which is 3/4. So that confirms it. The variance is 3/4.

Looking at the options, option C is (3/4). So that's the answer. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Oh wait, sometimes I get confused between variance and standard deviation. But no, variance is squared, so 3/4 seems right. Yeah, I think I did this correctly.

The variance of a uniformly distributed random variable over [a, b] is given by (b - a)² / 12. For the interval [0, 3], this becomes (3 - 0)² / 12 = 9/12 = 3/4.

Answer: C
