Okay, so I need to find the delta response h[n] of the given difference equation. The equation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = x[n], and the initial condition is h[-1] = 0. Hmm, I remember that the delta response is the system's response when the input x[n] is the unit impulse δ[n]. So, to find h[n], I should set x[n] = δ[n] and solve the difference equation.

First, I should probably write down the homogeneous equation because the system is linear and time-invariant. The homogeneous version is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 0. To solve this, I'll find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a homogeneous linear difference equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form y[n] = r^n. Plugging that in gives:

r^n - (5/6)r^{n-1} + (1/6)r^{n-2} = 0.

Dividing both sides by r^{n-2} (since r isn't zero), we get:

r^2 - (5/6)r + 1/6 = 0.

Now, multiply through by 6 to eliminate fractions:

6r^2 - 5r + 1 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: r = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 24)] / (12) because 6*(1)^2 is 6, 5 is the coefficient, and 1 is the constant. So sqrt(25 -24)=sqrt(1)=1.

So r = [5 ±1]/12. That gives two roots: (5+1)/12=6/12=1/2, and (5-1)/12=4/12=1/3. So the roots are r1=1/2 and r2=1/3.

Therefore, the general solution for the homogeneous equation is y[n] = A(1/2)^n + B(1/3)^n, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.

Since the system is causal (because h[-1]=0), the response starts at n=0. The delta function x[n]=δ[n] will cause the system to respond starting at n=0.

The delta response h[n] is the solution to the homogeneous equation with initial conditions determined by the input δ[n]. Let's think about the initial conditions. When n=0, the input is δ[0]=1, and for n<0, δ[n]=0.

Wait, but wait, the system is causal, so h[n] = 0 for n <0. The initial conditions at n=0 and n=1 will be determined by the system's response to the delta function.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this in terms of the system's impulse response. The impulse response h[n] satisfies the homogeneous equation with initial conditions determined by the impulse.

The general approach is to find h[n] by solving the homogeneous equation with the initial conditions h[-1]=0, h[0] = something, and h[1] determined by the system's response to the impulse.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When x[n]=δ[n], the output h[n] satisfies the equation:

h[n] - (5/6)h[n-1] + (1/6)h[n-2] = δ[n].

Because it's a second-order system, the initial conditions are h[-1]=0 and h[0] can be found by considering n=0.

Wait, let me plug n=0 into the equation. Then,

h[0] - (5/6)h[-1] + (1/6)h[-2] = δ[0]=1.

But since h[-1]=0 and h[-2]=0, this simplifies to h[0] = 1.

Now, for n=1, the equation becomes:

h[1] - (5/6)h[0] + (1/6)h[-1] = δ[1]=0.

So h[1] = (5/6)h[0] = (5/6)*1=5/6.

Similarly, for n=2, the equation is:

h[2] - (5/6)h[1] + (1/6)h[0] = δ[2]=0.

Plugging in h[1]=5/6 and h[0]=1:

h[2] = (5/6)(5/6) - (1/6)(1) = 25/36 - 1/6 = 25/36 - 6/36 = 19/36.

But wait, I'm trying to find the general form of h[n], so perhaps it's better to proceed with the homogeneous solution.

We have the general solution h[n] = A(1/2)^n + B(1/3)^n.

Now, apply the initial conditions. Since h[-1]=0, but the system is causal, so h[n]=0 for n<0. So for n=0, h[0]=A + B =1.

For n=1, h[1]=A(1/2) + B(1/3) =5/6.

So we have two equations:

1) A + B =1

2) (A/2) + (B/3) =5/6.

Let me solve these equations.

From equation 1: A=1-B.

Substitute into equation 2:

( (1-B)/2 ) + (B/3) =5/6.

Multiply all terms by 6 to eliminate denominators:

3(1-B) + 2B =5.

Expand: 3 -3B +2B =5 → 3 - B =5 → -B=2 → B= -2.

Then, from equation 1: A=1 - (-2) =3.

So A=3, B=-2.

Thus, h[n] =3*(1/2)^n -2*(1/3)^n, for n≥0, and 0 otherwise.

Now, looking at the options, option D is h[n] =3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]. Wait, no, that would be 3*(1/2)^n u[n] minus 1*(1/3)^n u[n]. But our solution is 3*(1/2)^n u[n] minus 2*(1/3)^n u[n]. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the equations again.

Wait, when I substituted A=3 and B=-2 into equation 2:

(3*(1/2) ) + (-2*(1/3)) = 3/2 - 2/3 = (9/6 -4/6)=5/6. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct expression is h[n] =3*(1/2)^n u[n] -2*(1/3)^n u[n]. Now, looking at the options:

Option D is h[n]=3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]. So it's missing the coefficient 2 on the second term. So none of the options exactly match this.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should find the impulse response by using the Z-transform method. The system's transfer function H(z) would be the Z-transform of the impulse response. The difference equation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = x[n]. Taking Z-transforms on both sides:

Y(z) - (5/6)Y(z)z^{-1} + (1/6)Y(z)z^{-2} = X(z).

Thus, H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) = 1 / [1 - (5/6)z^{-1} + (1/6)z^{-2}].

But perhaps it's easier to write it in terms of z:

Multiply numerator and denominator by z^2 to get:

H(z) = z^2 / [z^2 - (5/6)z + 1/6].

Wait, that's correct. Then, to find h[n], we can factor the denominator.

The denominator is z^2 - (5/6)z +1/6. Let's factor this quadratic in z:

The roots of the denominator are the same as the characteristic equation, which are 1/2 and 1/3, as before. So the denominator factors as (z - 1/2)(z - 1/3).

So H(z) = z^2 / [(z -1/2)(z -1/3)].

We can perform partial fraction decomposition on this:

H(z) = A/(z -1/2) + B/(z -1/3).

Multiply both sides by (z -1/2)(z -1/3):

z^2 = A(z -1/3) + B(z -1/2).

To find A and B, set z=1/2 and z=1/3.

When z=1/2:

(1/2)^2 = A(1/2 -1/3) → 1/4 = A*( (3-2)/6 )= A*(1/6) → A= (1/4)*(6)= 3/2.

Wait, but that doesn't match previous result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the inverse Z-transform using the residues. Let me proceed.

H(z) = z^2 / ( (z -1/2)(z -1/3) ).

Expressing as partial fractions:

H(z) = C/(z -1/2) + D/(z -1/3).

Multiply both sides by (z -1/2)(z -1/3):

z^2 = C(z -1/3) + D(z -1/2).

Let me plug in z=1/2 to find C:

(1/2)^2 = C(1/2 -1/3) → 1/4 = C*(1/6) → C= (1/4)/(1/6)= 6/4=3/2.

Similarly, plug in z=1/3:

(1/3)^2 = D(1/3 -1/2) → 1/9 = D*(-1/6) → D= (1/9)/(-1/6)= -6/9= -2/3.

So H(z) = (3/2)/(z -1/2) - (2/3)/(z -1/3).

The inverse Z-transform of 1/(z - a) is a^n u[n]. So:

h[n] = (3/2)(1/2)^n u[n] - (2/3)(1/3)^n u[n].

Simplify the coefficients:

(3/2)(1/2)^n =3*(1/2)^{n+1} =3*(1/2)^n *1/2 = same as 3*(1/2)^n multiplied by 1/2. Wait, perhaps better to write as 3*(1/2)^n * (1/2) = 3*(1/2)^{n+1}.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Wait, 3/2 * (1/2)^n = (3/2)*(1/2)^n = 3*(1/2)^{n+1}.

But perhaps it's better to leave it as 3/2*(1/2)^n, which is the same as 3*(1/2)^{n} * (1/2) = 3*(1/2)^{n+1}.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the system is causal, so h[n] =0 for n<0, and the inverse Z-transform of H(z) is valid for |z|> max(1/2,1/3)=1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction setup. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should represent H(z) as (z^2) / [(z -1/2)(z -1/3)] and perform partial fractions correctly.

Let me write H(z) = A/(1 - 1/2 z^{-1}) + B/(1 - 1/3 z^{-1}).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express H(z) as:

H(z) = (z^2) / [(z -1/2)(z -1/3)].

Expressed in terms of z^{-1}, let me factor:

Denominator: (z -1/2)(z -1/3) = z^2 (1 - (1/2)z^{-1})(1 - (1/3)z^{-1}).

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should write H(z) as:

H(z) = (z^2) / [ (z -1/2)(z -1/3) ) ].

Expressed as partial fractions:

H(z) = C/(z -1/2) + D/(z -1/3).

So, solving for C and D as before.

Wait, earlier I found C=3/2 and D= -2/3.

So the inverse Z-transform is:

h[n] = C*(1/2)^n u[n] + D*(1/3)^n u[n].

Substituting the values:

h[n] = (3/2)(1/2)^n u[n] + (-2/3)(1/3)^n u[n].

Simplify the terms:

(3/2)(1/2)^n = 3*(1/2)^{n} * (1/2) = 3*(1/2)^{n+1}.

Similarly, (-2/3)(1/3)^n = -2*(1/3)^{n+1}.

But perhaps it's better to write it as:

h[n] = (3/2)(1/2)^n u[n] - (2/3)(1/3)^n u[n].

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this expression. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: h[n] =3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]

Option E: h[n] =3 (1/3)^n u[n] - 2 (1/2)^n u[n]

Option F: h[n] =3 (1/3)^n u[n] - 2 (1/3)^n u[n]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the homogeneous solution and apply initial conditions correctly.

Earlier, using the difference equation approach, I found h[n] =3*(1/2)^n u[n] -2*(1/3)^n u[n], which would be option D if the second term's coefficient is 2, but in the options, option D has -1*(1/3)^n. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conditions.

Wait, let me double-check the initial conditions.

At n=0:

h[0] = A(1/2)^0 + B(1/3)^0 = A + B =1.

At n=1:

h[1] = A*(1/2) + B*(1/3) =5/6.

From these two equations:

Equation 1: A + B =1.

Equation 2: (A/2) + (B/3) =5/6.

Let me solve these again.

Multiply equation 2 by 6 to eliminate denominators:

3A + 2B =5.

From equation 1: A =1 - B.

Substituting into equation 2:

3(1 - B) +2B =5 → 3 -3B +2B =5 → 3 - B =5 → -B=2 → B= -2.

Then, A=1 - (-2)=3.

So h[n] =3*(1/2)^n u[n] -2*(1/3)^n u[n].

Wait, looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]

Option F: 3 (1/3)^n u[n] - 2 (1/3)^n u[n]

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction approach earlier. Let me re-express the transfer function.

H(z) = z^2 / (1 - (5/6)z^{-1} + (1/6)z^{-2} )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write this as:

H(z) = z^2 / [ (1 - (1/2)z^{-1})(1 - (1/3)z^{-1}) ) ]

Because the denominator factors into (1 -1/2 z^{-1})(1 -1/3 z^{-1}).

So, performing partial fraction decomposition:

H(z) = A/(1 -1/2 z^{-1}) + B/(1 -1/3 z^{-1}).

Multiply both sides by (1 -1/2 z^{-1})(1 -1/3 z^{-1}):

z^2 = A(1 -1/3 z^{-1}) + B(1 -1/2 z^{-1}).

Now, let me express this equation in terms of positive powers of z^{-1}.

z^2 = A [1 - (1/3) z^{-1} ] + B [1 - (1/2) z^{-1} ].

Multiply through by z^2 to make it easier:

z^4 = A(z^2 - (1/3) z ) + B(z^2 - (1/2) z ).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to substitute specific z values to find A and B.

Let me set z=1/2:

(1/2)^2 = A(1 -1/3*(1/2)) + B(1 -1/2*(1/2)).

Wait, no, perhaps I should set z=0 instead.

Wait, when z approaches infinity, the highest degree terms dominate.

z^2 = A(1) + B(1), so coefficient of z^2 is 1 = A + B. Hmm, but that's not matching the earlier setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let me represent H(z) as:

H(z) = z^2 / ( (z -1/2)(z -1/3) )

Expressed as A/(z -1/2) + B/(z -1/3).

Multiply both sides by (z -1/2)(z -1/3):

z^2 = A(z -1/3) + B(z -1/2).

Now, let me expand the right side: Az - A/3 + Bz - B/2 = (A + B)z - (A/3 + B/2).

This must equal z^2, so:

A + B must equal the coefficient of z^2, which is 1. But wait, the left side is z^2, and the right side is (A+B)z - (A/3 + B/2), which doesn't have a z^2 term. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should express H(z) as (z^2) / [(z -1/2)(z -1/3)] = [A z + B] / (z -1/2) + [C z + D]/(z -1/3).

Alternatively, perhaps I need to perform polynomial division because the degree of the numerator is higher than the denominator.

Wait, the denominator is a quadratic (degree 2), and the numerator is z^2 (degree 2), so perhaps there's a proper fraction. Alternatively, I can perform partial fractions after dividing.

Wait, let me try dividing z^2 by (z -1/2)(z -1/3) = z^2 - (5/6)z + 1/6.

So, z^2 ÷ (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6).

The leading term is z^2 divided by z^2, which is 1. So, H(z) =1 + [ (5/6 z -1/6 ) ] / (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6).

Wait, that's because when you multiply (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6) by 1, you get z^2 -5/6 z +1/6. Subtracting that from z^2 gives 5/6 z -1/6.

So, H(z) =1 + (5/6 z -1/6) / (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6).

Now, the proper fraction is (5/6 z -1/6) / (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6) = (5/6 z -1/6) / [(z -1/2)(z -1/3)].

Now, perform partial fractions on this:

(5/6 z -1/6) = A/(z -1/2) + B/(z -1/3).

Multiply both sides by (z -1/2)(z -1/3):

5/6 z -1/6 = A(z -1/3) + B(z -1/2).

Expand the right side: A z - A/3 + B z - B/2 = (A + B) z - (A/3 + B/2).

Equate coefficients:

For z term: (A + B) =5/6.

For constant term: -(A/3 + B/2) = -1/6.

Which simplifies to A/3 + B/2 =1/6.

Now, we have two equations:

1) A + B =5/6.

2) (A/3) + (B/2) =1/6.

Let me solve these equations.

Multiply equation 2 by 6 to eliminate denominators:

2A +3B =1.

From equation 1: A =5/6 - B.

Substitute into equation 2:

2*(5/6 - B) +3B =1 → (10/6) -2B +3B =1 → 10/6 + B =1 → B=1 -10/6 = (6/6 -10/6)= -4/6= -2/3.

Then, A=5/6 - (-2/3)=5/6 +4/6=9/6=3/2.

So, (5/6 z -1/6) / (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6) = (3/2)/(z -1/2) + (-2/3)/(z -1/3).

Therefore, H(z) =1 + (3/2)/(z -1/2) - (2/3)/(z -1/3).

Now, the inverse Z-transform of 1 is δ[n], the inverse Z-transform of 1/(z -a) is a^n u[n].

So, h[n] = δ[n] + (3/2)(1/2)^n u[n] - (2/3)(1/3)^n u[n].

But wait, when n=0, h[0] should be 1 because of the delta function. Let me check:

h[0] =1 + (3/2)(1) - (2/3)(1) =1 + 3/2 -2/3.

Calculating: 1 + (9/6 -4/6) =1 +5/6=11/6.

But earlier, when I used the difference equation approach, h[0]=1. So this suggests a mistake in the partial fraction approach. I think I made a mistake in the polynomial division step.

Wait, perhaps I should not have included the 1 in H(z). Let me re-express H(z) correctly.

H(z) = z^2 / (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6) = [ (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6) +5/6 z -1/6 ] / (z^2 -5/6 z +1/6 )

=1 + (5/6 z -1/6)/(z^2 -5/6 z +1/6).

Yes, that part is correct. So the inverse Z-transform is:

h[n] = δ[n] + (3/2)(1/2)^n u[n] - (2/3)(1/3)^n u[n].

But when n=0, h[0] =1 +3/2 -2/3 =1 + (9/6 -4/6)=1 +5/6=11/6, which contradicts the earlier result where h[0]=1. This indicates a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me go back to the difference equation approach.

We have h[n] =3*(1/2)^n -2*(1/3)^n for n≥0.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match, but perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction approach. Let me check the options again.

Option D is h[n]=3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n].

The coefficient of the second term is -1*(1/3)^n, but according to the difference equation approach, it's -2*(1/3)^n.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the difference equation approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the general solution correctly.

The homogeneous solution is h[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n.

At n=0: h[0] =A + B=1.

At n=1: h[1] =A*(1/2) + B*(1/3)=5/6.

So, solving:

Equation 1: A + B =1.

Equation 2: (A/2)+(B/3)=5/6.

Multiply equation 2 by 6: 3A +2B=5.

Substitute A=1-B into equation 2:

3(1-B) +2B=5 →3 -3B +2B=5 →3 -B=5 →-B=2 →B= -2.

Then A=1 - (-2)=3.

Thus, h[n]=3*(1/2)^n -2*(1/3)^n.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is 3*(1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n], but it has -1*(1/3)^n instead of -2*(1/3)^n. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the difference equation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is E: h[n]=3 (1/3)^n u[n] -2 (1/2)^n u[n], but that doesn't match either.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial conditions.

When n=0:

h[0] =1.

h[0] =3*(1/2)^0 -2*(1/3)^0=3 -2=1. Correct.

h[1]=3*(1/2) -2*(1/3)=3/2 -2/3= (9/6 -4/6)=5/6. Correct.

h[2]=3*(1/4) -2*(1/9)=3/4 -2/9= (27/36 -8/36)=19/36. Which is correct as per earlier calculation.

So the solution is correct. Now, looking back at the options, none of them match exactly except none. But perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at option D: h[n]=3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]. So it's 3*(1/2)^n -1*(1/3)^n.

But our solution is 3*(1/2)^n -2*(1/3)^n.

So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conditions.

Wait, perhaps the initial conditions are different. The problem states h[-1]=0. Since the system is causal, h[n]=0 for n<0. So for n=0, h[0]=1, and for n=1, h[1]=5/6.

So the solution is correct. Therefore, the correct answer must be option D, but the coefficient is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the second term's coefficient is a mistake in the options. But looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a combination of terms that match 3*(1/2)^n -2*(1/3)^n.

Looking at the options:

Option D:3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]

Option E:3 (1/3)^n u[n] -2 (1/2)^n u[n]

Option F:3 (1/3)^n u[n] -2 (1/3)^n u[n]

Hmm, none of them match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the difference equation approach. Let me try using the transfer function again.

H(z) =1 + (3/2)/(z -1/2) - (2/3)/(z -1/3).

Inverse Z-transform gives:

h[n] = δ[n] + (3/2)(1/2)^n u[n] - (2/3)(1/3)^n u[n].

But this leads to h[0]=1 +3/2 -2/3=1 +9/6 -4/6=1 +5/6=11/6, which contradicts the earlier result where h[0]=1.

This suggests a mistake in the partial fraction approach. Therefore, I think the correct answer must be the one found via the difference equation approach, which is h[n]=3*(1/2)^n u[n] -2*(1/3)^n u[n], but since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial conditions. When solving for the impulse response, the initial conditions for the homogeneous solution are determined by the system's response to the impulse. For a causal system, the initial rest condition applies, meaning that h[n]=0 for n<0. Thus, when x[n]=δ[n], the initial conditions are h[-1]=0 and h[0]=1.

Wait, perhaps the correct form is h[n]=3*(1/2)^n u[n] -2*(1/3)^n u[n], which isn't directly listed, but perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, looking again, option D is h[n]=3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]. The coefficients are 3 and -1. Perhaps I made a mistake in the difference equation approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-solve the equations.

Equations:

1) A + B =1.

2) (A/2) + (B/3)=5/6.

Let me solve these again.

From equation 1: B=1-A.

Substitute into equation 2:

(A/2) + ( (1-A)/3 )=5/6.

Multiply all terms by 6 to eliminate denominators:

3A + 2(1 -A) =5.

3A +2 -2A=5 → A +2=5 →A=3.

Then B=1-3= -2.

So h[n]=3*(1/2)^n -2*(1/3)^n.

Thus, the correct answer is h[n]=3*(1/2)^n u[n] -2*(1/3)^n u[n].

Looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps option D is the intended answer, assuming a typo in the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D: 3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n], but that would mean B=-1 instead of B=-2. So perhaps I made a mistake in solving the equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the difference equation approach.

At n=0: h[0] =1.

At n=1: h[1] = (5/6)h[0] =5/6.

At n=2: h[2]= (5/6)h[1] - (1/6)h[0] = (5/6)*(5/6) - (1/6)*1 =25/36 -6/36=19/36.

Now, with h[n]=3*(1/2)^n -2*(1/3)^n:

h[0]=3 -2=1.

h[1]=3*(1/2) -2*(1/3)= 3/2 -2/3=5/6.

h[2]=3*(1/4) -2*(1/9)=3/4 -2/9=27/36 -8/36=19/36.

So the solution is correct. Therefore, the correct answer must be the one that matches this form. However, looking at the options again:

Option D:3 (1/2)^n u[n] - (1/3)^n u[n]

Option E:3 (1/3)^n u[n] -2 (1/2)^n u[n]

Option F:3 (1/3)^n u[n] -2 (1/3)^n u[n]

Option I: (1/3)^n u[n] - (1/2)^n u[n]

None of these match exactly. I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, and the coefficient is a typo.

But given the options, the closest match is option D, so I'll select that.

The problem involves finding the impulse response \( h[n] \) of the system described by the difference equation:

\[
y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = x[n],
\]

with the initial condition \( h[-1] = 0 \). The impulse response \( h[n] \) is the solution to this equation when \( x[n] = \delta[n] \).

### Step 1: Homogeneous Solution
The homogeneous equation is:

\[
y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = 0.
\]

Assuming a solution of the form \( y[n] = r^n \), the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
r^2 - \frac{5}{6}r + \frac{1}{6} = 0.
\]

Multiplying through by 6 to clear the fractions:

\[
6r^2 - 5r + 1 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
r = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{12} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{12}.
\]

The roots are:

\[
r_1 = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad r_2 = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is:

\[
h[n] = A\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n u[n] + B\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n u[n].
\]

### Step 2: Initial Conditions
Since the system is causal (\( h[n] = 0 \) for \( n < 0 \)), the initial conditions are determined by the impulse input \( \delta[n] \). At \( n = 0 \):

\[
h[0] = A + B = 1.
\]

At \( n = 1 \):

\[
h[1] = \frac{A}{2} + \frac{B}{3} = \frac{5}{6}.
\]

### Step 3: Solving for Constants \( A \) and \( B \)
From \( h[0] = 1 \):

\[
A + B = 1. \tag{1}
\]

From \( h[1] = \frac{5}{6} \):

\[
\frac{A}{2} + \frac{B}{3} = \frac{5}{6}. \tag{2}
\]

Multiply equation (2) by 6 to eliminate denominators:

\[
3A + 2B = 5. \tag{3}
\]

Substitute \( A = 1 - B \) from equation (1) into equation (3):

\[
3(1 - B) + 2B = 5 \implies 3 - 3B + 2B = 5 \implies 3 - B = 5 \implies B = -2.
\]

Substitute \( B = -2 \) back into equation (1):

\[
A = 1 - (-2) = 3.
\]

Thus, the impulse response is:

\[
h[n] = 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n u[n] - 2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n u[n].
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
The derived impulse response does not exactly match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is:

**D: \( h[n] = 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n u[n] - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n u[n] \).**

Although the coefficient of the second term does not match exactly, it is likely that option D is the intended answer due to a possible typo in the problem statement.
