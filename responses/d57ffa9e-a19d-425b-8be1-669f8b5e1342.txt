Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: "An auditor of a nonissuer should design tests of details to ensure that sufficient audit evidence supports which of the following?" And there are ten options from A to J.

First, I need to recall what tests of details are in auditing. From what I remember, tests of details are procedures that an auditor performs to obtain audit evidence about specific transactions or account balances. These tests are used to verify the accuracy and completeness of financial statement assertions. Assertions, in this context, are claims made by management regarding the financial statements, such as assertions about existence, completeness, accuracy, cutoff, and rights and obligations.

The question is asking which of the options the tests of details support. So, I should think about what each option is referring to.

Option A: The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level. Hmm. Assurance relates to the confidence the auditor has. But tests of details are more about gathering evidence to support or contradict certain assertions. Not sure if this is the right fit.

Option B: The planned level of detection risk. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor's procedures will not detect a material misstatement. Tests of details would influence detection risk because they directly test for misstatements. But the question is about what the tests are designed to support, not directly about detection risk.

Option C: The effectiveness of the organization's risk management. That sounds more like something related to internal control or maybe the risk assessment process. Tests of details might not directly assess risk management effectiveness; they're more about the financial statements.

Option D: Management’s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently. Wait, that's about internal controls. Tests of controls are different from tests of details. Tests of details are about the financial statements, not the controls themselves. So I think D is more about tests of controls, like walkthroughs or observation.

Option E: Management’s assertions about the future profitability of the company. That seems forward-looking. Auditors typically focus on past and current events, not future profitability. So E might not be the right answer.

Option F: The financial statements are free from material misstatement. That sounds familiar. Tests of details are designed to gather evidence to support this assertion. Because the auditor wants to find if there are any material misstatements, so F seems a strong candidate.

Option G: The planned level of control risk. Control risk is the risk that a material misstatement exists and the internal controls don't prevent or detect it. Tests of details might affect control risk, but again, the question is about what the tests are designed to support.

Option H: The organization's compliance with laws and regulations. That's a specific assertion, but tests of details would cover this if it's part of the financial statements, but I'm not sure if H is the best fit here.

Option I: The accuracy of the organization's financial reporting. That's similar to F, but maybe more specific. Tests of details do ensure accuracy, so perhaps I is also a contender.

Option J: The effectiveness of internal controls. Again, similar to D, this is about controls, which is more about tests of controls rather than tests of details.

Now, I need to think about what tests of details actually target. Tests of details are used to verify the accuracy and completeness of specific transactions and balances. They are part of the substantive procedures an auditor performs. The goal is to gather sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

Looking at the options, F says the financial statements are free from material misstatement. That seems to directly address the purpose of tests of details. Option I says the accuracy of financial reporting, which is related but perhaps more specific. But in auditing terminology, the primary focus is on whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, which is a more general assertion.

Wait, but sometimes accuracy is a type of assertion. Assertions include existence, completeness, accuracy, cutoff, and rights and obligations. So tests of details would support the accuracy assertion, which is part of F.

So F is about the overall financial statements being free from misstatement, which encompasses all the specific assertions. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: The financial statements are free from material misstatement.

Answer: F
