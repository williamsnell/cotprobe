Question:

Explain how the MC = MR rule can be applied to the hiring of laborin a perfectly competitive market.

Options:

A: Firms hire an unlimited number of workers as long as they contribute any positive amount to total revenue.
B: In a perfectly competitive market, firms don't hire workers based on MRC = MRP rule.
C: MRC = MRP for labor and a firm will pay each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired.
D: Firms hire workers until the wage rate is equal to the average cost of labor.
E: Firms hire workers based on a fixed wage, regardless of marginal revenue or marginal costs.
F: Firms pay each worker a wage equal to the total revenue of the company.
G: Marginal revenue product of labor is ignored, and firms focus on minimizing the average cost of labor per worker.
H: Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor.
I: Each worker's wage is set by the average revenue product of all workers combined.
J: MRC = MRP and firms pay each worker a wage higher than the MRP of the last worker hired.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about the application of the MC = MR rule in the hiring of labor in a perfectly competitive market. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in economics, firms make decisions based on marginal costs and marginal revenues. The basic idea is that a firm should produce up to the point where the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR). This is because beyond that point, each additional unit costs more than it brings in revenue, so it's not profitable anymore.

Now, the question is about labor. So, how does this apply when a company is hiring workers? I think it has something to do with the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP) and the marginal cost of labor (MRC). 

Wait, MRP is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker, right? So, MRP is calculated as the marginal product of labor (the extra output from one more worker) multiplied by the marginal revenue of the output. In a perfectly competitive market, the marginal revenue is the same as the price of the product, so MRP = MP * P.

On the other hand, the marginal cost of labor (MRC) is the additional cost from hiring one more worker. That's straightforwardâ€”it's just the wage rate per worker. So, in a perfectly competitive labor market, the firm can hire as many workers as it wants at the going wage rate. So, the MRC is equal to the wage rate because each additional worker costs the same.

So, applying the MC=MR rule here, the firm should hire workers up to the point where MRP equals MRC. That is, when the additional revenue from the last worker equals the additional cost of hiring that worker. So, the firm hires until MRP = MRC, and then stops. This ensures that each additional worker adds as much to revenue as it adds to cost, maximizing profit.

Looking at the options:

Option C says "MRC = MRP for labor and a firm will pay each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired." Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because in a competitive market, the wage rate is determined by the market, not by the firm's MRP. The firm can't set the wage; they take it as given. So, the MRC is the same as the wage rate. But the MRP varies with the productivity of each worker.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The firm's MRC is the wage rate, and the MRP is the additional revenue from the worker. So, the firm will hire until MRP = MRC (which is the wage). So, the wage each worker is paid is equal to the MRP of that worker, but only up to the point where MRP equals MRC. Beyond that point, MRP would be less than MRC, so the firm wouldn't hire more workers.

Wait, but in a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a wage-taker, so the wage rate is fixed. So the MRC is fixed at the wage rate. The firm will keep hiring workers until the MRP of the next worker equals the MRC (wage). So, each worker is paid the wage, which is the MRC, and the MRP of the last worker is equal to that wage. So the firm stops hiring when MRP of the next worker is less than the wage.

So looking at the options, option C says that MRC = MRP and the firm pays each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker. Hmm, but if MRC is the wage, and MRP is equal to MRC at the optimal point, then the wage is equal to MRP of the last worker. So that seems correct.

Wait, but another option is H: "Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor." So H says they stop when MRC > MRP. Which is correct because the firm would stop hiring when the next worker's MRP is less than MRC, which is the wage. So H is correct as well. Wait, no, H says they hire until MRC exceeds MRP, which would mean they stop when MRC > MRP. That's right because they only hire when MRP >= MRC.

Wait, so the rule is to hire up to the point where MRP equals MRC. So, they hire until MRP = MRC, and beyond that, MRP < MRC. So, they stop when MRP < MRC. So option H says they hire until MRC exceeds MRP, which would mean they stop when MRC > MRP. So H is correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, let me check each one.

Option C: MRC = MRP and each worker's wage equals the MRP of the last. So when MRC = MRP, the wage is set to that MRP. So that's correct because at that point, the next worker would have MRP less than MRC, so the firm stops. So the wage is equal to the MRP of the last worker hired. So that's correct.

Option H: Firms hire until MRC exceeds MRP. So they keep hiring as long as MRP >= MRC. They stop when MRC > MRP. So that's also correct.

Wait, so both options C and H seem relevant. But let me think again.

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm's MRC is the wage rate, which is fixed. The firm will hire workers until the MRP of the next worker equals the MRC (wage). So when MRP = MRC, they stop. So they hire until MRP equals MRC, which is option C's first part. The second part says the firm pays each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired. So the wage is equal to MRC, which is the same as the MRP of the last worker. So that's correct.

Option H says firms hire until MRC exceeds MRP. So they hire as long as MRP >= MRC. So when MRP drops below MRC, they stop. So H is correct in the stopping condition.

Wait, but the question is asking how the MC=MR rule is applied. So MC here is the MRC (marginal cost of labor), and MR is the MRP (marginal revenue product). So the rule is MRC = MRP, which is option C. So the firm hires until MRC equals MRP. So option C is correct because it states that MRC = MRP, and the wage is set to that MRP. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but option H says they hire until MRC exceeds MRP. So they stop when MRC > MRP, which is when MRP < MRC. So H is about stopping when MRC exceeds MRP. But the rule is to hire up to where MRC equals MRP. So the correct application is when MRC equals MRP, which is in option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the firm hires until MRP equals the wage rate (which is MRC). So the stopping point is when MRP equals MRC. So option C is correct.

Wait, but option H is phrased as "hires workers until MRC exceeds MRP." So that would mean they keep hiring as long as MRC is less than or equal to MRP, and stop when MRC > MRP. So H is correct in the stopping condition. But the question is about applying the MC=MR rule, which is MRC = MRP. So the correct answer would be C, because it's stating that MRC equals MRP, and the wage equals the MRP of the last worker.

Wait, but in reality, the wage is the MRC, which is fixed. So if MRC (wage) equals MRP, then the firm stops. So each worker's wage is equal to the MRC, which is the same as the MRP of the last worker. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option C says "MRC = MRP for labor and a firm will pay each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired." So the wage is equal to the MRP of the last worker, which is the same as MRC. So that's correct.

Option H says they hire until MRC exceeds MRP, which is when they stop. So H is correct in the stopping condition, but perhaps not the exact application. The question is about applying the MC=MR rule, which is when MRC equals MRP. So the correct option is C.

The MC = MR rule in the context of labor hiring in a perfectly competitive market involves equating the marginal cost of labor (MRC) with the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP). In this scenario, MRC is the wage rate, which is fixed in a competitive market, while MRP is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker. Firms will hire workers until the MRP of the next worker equals the MRC (wage rate). At this point, the wage paid to each worker is equal to the MRP of the last worker hired. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: MRC = MRP for labor and a firm will pay each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired.
