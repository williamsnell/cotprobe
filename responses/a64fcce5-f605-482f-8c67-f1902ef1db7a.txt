Okay, so I need to figure out the current life expectancy in the United States. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I'll try to think it through. I remember hearing that life expectancy varies by country, and the US is somewhere in the middle. Let me see... I think it's around 70s, maybe 78 or 80?

Wait, I'm trying to recall if it's increased over the years. I think a while ago it was like in the 70s, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should break it down. For men and women, I think women generally live longer. So the average might be a bit higher than the male average. But the question is about the overall life expectancy, so it's a combined number.

I've heard that the US life expectancy is lower than some other developed countries like Japan or Sweden. I think Japan's is in the 80s, so maybe the US is a bit lower. So perhaps around 78 or 80? Let me think about recent data. I remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy in the US is about 78-79 years. But wait, could it be higher? Maybe 80?

Wait, no, I think I read that as of recent years, it's around 78-79. So looking at the options, option D is 78, E is 80. Which one is correct? I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about other factors. The US has a high rate of obesity, which can affect life expectancy. Also, access to healthcare varies, which might impact the numbers.

Another angle: I remember that in 2020, due to the pandemic, life expectancy dropped a bit. But that's a recent dip. Prior to that, I think it was around 78-79. So the current figure might be bouncing back, but perhaps it's still around 78. So option D: 78.

Alternatively, maybe it's 80. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll go with the 78 because that's what I've heard more frequently.
