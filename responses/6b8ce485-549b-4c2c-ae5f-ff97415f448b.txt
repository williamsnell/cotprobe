Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here. It says to find the value of y₀ for which the solution of the initial value problem y' - y = 1 + 3 sin t, with y(0) = y₀, remains finite as t approaches infinity. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should probably recall how to solve linear differential equations. The equation given is a first-order linear ODE. The standard form is y' + P(t)y = Q(t). In this case, the equation is y' - y = 1 + 3 sin t. So I can rewrite it as y' + (-1)y = 1 + 3 sin t. That means P(t) is -1 and Q(t) is 1 + 3 sin t.

To solve this, I think I need an integrating factor. The integrating factor μ(t) is usually e^(∫P(t) dt). Since P(t) is -1, integrating that would give me -t. So the integrating factor would be e^(-t). Wait, no, actually, the integrating factor is e^(∫P(t) dt), so P(t) is -1, so ∫-1 dt is -t, so μ(t) = e^(-t).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. The standard form is y' + P(t)y = Q(t). So in this case, I have y' - y = ... which is y' + (-1)y = ... So P(t) is -1. So the integrating factor is e^(∫-1 dt) = e^(-t) yes.

Now, I multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor. So:

e^(-t) y' - e^(-t) y = e^(-t) (1 + 3 sin t).

The left side should now be the derivative of (e^(-t) y). So:

d/dt [e^(-t) y] = e^(-t) (1 + 3 sin t).

Now I need to integrate both sides with respect to t.

Integrate from 0 to t, perhaps, to find the solution.

So:

∫₀^t d/dt [e^(-s) y(s)] ds = ∫₀^t e^(-s) (1 + 3 sin s) ds.

The left side becomes e^(-t) y(t) - e^(0) y(0) = e^(-t) y(t) - y₀.

The right side is the integral of e^(-s) times (1 + 3 sin s) ds. Let me compute that.

First, split the integral into two parts:

∫ e^(-s) ds + 3 ∫ e^(-s) sin s ds.

Compute each integral separately.

The first integral, ∫ e^(-s) ds, is straightforward. It's -e^(-s) + C.

The second integral, ∫ e^(-s) sin s ds, is a standard integral. I think the formula for ∫ e^(at) sin(bt) dt is e^(at)/(a² + b²) (a sin bt - b cos bt) + C. In this case, a = -1 and b = 1. So let me compute it.

∫ e^(-s) sin s ds = e^(-s) [ (-1)(sin s) - (1)(-cos s) ] / [ (-1)^2 + (1)^2 ] + C

Wait, let me apply the formula correctly. The integral is:

∫ e^{at} sin(bt) dt = e^{at} (a sin bt - b cos bt) / (a² + b²) + C.

So here, a = -1, b = 1.

So substituting, we get:

e^{-s} [ (-1)(1) sin s - (1)(-1) cos s ] / ( (-1)^2 + (1)^2 )

Simplify numerator:

(-1) sin s + (1) cos s.

Denominator: 1 + 1 = 2.

So the integral is [e^{-s} ( - sin s + cos s ) ] / 2 + C.

So putting it all together, the right side integral becomes:

[ -e^{-s} ] from 0 to t + 3 * [ (e^{-s} (-sin s + cos s)) / 2 ] from 0 to t.

Let me compute each part.

First part: [ -e^{-t} - (-e^{0}) ] = -e^{-t} + 1.

Second part: 3 times [ (e^{-t} (-sin t + cos t) / 2 - (e^{0} (-sin 0 + cos 0) / 2) ) ]

Simplify each term.

Compute the second part:

3 * [ (e^{-t} (-sin t + cos t) ) / 2 - ( (0 + 1) / 2 ) ]

Because sin 0 is 0, cos 0 is 1, so e^{0} is 1.

So that's 3 * [ (e^{-t} (-sin t + cos t) ) / 2 - 1/2 ]

Expanding this:

3 * [ (-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) / 2 - 1/2 ]

So combining all terms, the right side integral is:

[ -e^{-t} + 1 ] + 3 * [ (-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) / 2 - 1/2 ]

Let me simplify each term:

First, the -e^{-t} +1.

Second, the 3* [ ... ] part:

3 * (-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) / 2 = (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t )

And 3*(-1/2) = -3/2.

So combining all terms:

Right side integral = (-e^{-t} +1) + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 3/2.

Combine constants: 1 - 3/2 = -1/2.

So the right side becomes:

-e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2.

Now, the left side was e^{-t} y(t) - y₀.

So:

e^{-t} y(t) - y₀ = -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2.

Now, let's solve for y(t).

Bring y₀ to the right side:

e^{-t} y(t) = -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2 + y₀.

Multiply both sides by e^{t} to solve for y(t):

y(t) = [ -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2 + y₀ ] * e^{t}.

Simplify each term:

- e^{-t} * e^{t} = -1.

(3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t) * e^{t} = (3/2)(-sin t).

(3/2)(e^{-t} cos t) * e^{t} = (3/2) cos t.

-1/2 * e^{t} remains as is.

y₀ * e^{t} is y₀ e^{t}.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, when you have [a + b + c + d] * e^t, each term is multiplied by e^t.

So:

y(t) = (-e^{-t})*e^t + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t)*e^t + (3/2)(e^{-t} cos t)*e^t + (-1/2)*e^t + y₀ * e^t.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in the expansion. Let me go back.

Wait, the right side after integrating was:

- e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2.

Then when I multiply both sides by e^t, each term gets multiplied by e^t:

e^{-t} y(t) = [ -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2 ].

So when I multiply both sides by e^t, I get:

y(t) = [ -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2 ] * e^t.

So each term:

- e^{-t} * e^t = -1.

(3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t) * e^t = (3/2)(- sin t).

(3/2)(e^{-t} cos t) * e^t = (3/2) cos t.

-1/2 * e^t = (-1/2) e^t.

So putting it all together:

y(t) = -1 - (3/2) sin t + (3/2) cos t - (1/2) e^t + y₀ e^t.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the last term would be y₀ multiplied by e^t, right?

Wait, no, the last term when I moved y₀ to the right side was:

e^{-t} y(t) = ... - 1/2 + y₀.

So when I multiply by e^t, it's y(t) = [ ... ] * e^t + y₀ e^t.

Wait, no. Wait, let's re-express the equation after integration correctly.

After integrating, we had:

e^{-t} y(t) - y₀ = [ -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2 ]

So bringing y₀ to the other side:

e^{-t} y(t) = [ -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2 ] + y₀

Then multiplying both sides by e^t:

y(t) = [ -e^{-t} + (3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t + e^{-t} cos t ) - 1/2 + y₀ ] * e^t.

Wait, so each term inside the brackets is multiplied by e^t.

So:

- e^{-t} * e^t = -1.

(3/2)(-e^{-t} sin t) * e^t = (3/2)(- sin t).

(3/2)(e^{-t} cos t) * e^t = (3/2) cos t.

-1/2 * e^t.

y₀ * e^t.

So:

y(t) = -1 - (3/2) sin t + (3/2) cos t - (1/2) e^t + y₀ e^t.

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me check my steps again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the solution in a more compact form. The general solution to a linear ODE is y(t) = homogeneous solution + particular solution.

The homogeneous equation is y' - y = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 1 = 0, so r=1. So the homogeneous solution is y_h = C e^{t}.

Now, to find the particular solution y_p. The nonhomogeneous term is 1 + 3 sin t. So I can try a particular solution of the form y_p = A + B sin t + C cos t.

Wait, because the nonhomogeneous term is a constant plus a sine function. So let's assume y_p = A + B sin t + C cos t.

Compute y_p':

y_p' = B cos t - C sin t.

Substitute into the equation y' - y = 1 + 3 sin t:

y_p' - y_p = (B cos t - C sin t) - (A + B sin t + C cos t) = 1 + 3 sin t.

Simplify:

B cos t - C sin t - A - B sin t - C cos t = 1 + 3 sin t.

Group terms:

(B cos t - C cos t) + (-C sin t - B sin t) - A = 1 + 3 sin t.

Factor:

cos t (B - C) + sin t (-C - B) - A = 1 + 3 sin t.

Now, equate the coefficients:

cos t term: (B - C) = 0.

sin t term: (-C - B) = 3.

Constant term: -A = 1.

From the constant term: -A = 1 ⇒ A = -1.

From cos t term: B - C = 0 ⇒ B = C.

From sin t term: -C - B = 3.

But since B = C, substitute into the equation:

- C - C = 3 ⇒ -2C = 3 ⇒ C = -3/2.

Since B = C, B = -3/2.

So the particular solution is y_p = A + B sin t + C cos t = -1 - (3/2) sin t - (3/2) cos t.

Wait, but wait, in the earlier approach, when I integrated, I had terms with cos t and sin t, but this approach gives me a particular solution with coefficients for cos t and sin t. Let me see if this matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration earlier, so let me cross-check.

In any case, the general solution is y(t) = y_h + y_p = C e^{t} -1 - (3/2) sin t - (3/2) cos t.

Now, apply the initial condition y(0) = y₀.

At t=0, y(0) = C e^{0} -1 - (3/2) sin 0 - (3/2) cos 0.

Simplify:

y(0) = C*1 -1 - 0 - (3/2)(1) ⇒ y₀ = C -1 - 3/2 ⇒ y₀ = C - 5/2.

So C = y₀ + 5/2.

Therefore, the general solution is y(t) = (y₀ + 5/2) e^{t} -1 - (3/2) sin t - (3/2) cos t.

Now, the problem asks for the value of y₀ for which the solution remains finite as t approaches infinity.

Looking at the solution y(t), the term with e^{t} will dominate as t → ∞. Since e^{t} grows exponentially, to keep y(t) finite as t→infty, the coefficient of e^{t} must be zero. Otherwise, y(t) would blow up.

So the coefficient of e^{t} is (y₀ + 5/2). Therefore, to make this zero:

y₀ + 5/2 = 0 ⇒ y₀ = -5/2 = -2.5.

Now, looking at the options, F is -2.5. So the answer should be F.

To determine the value of \( y_0 \) for which the solution remains finite as \( t \to \infty \), we solve the initial value problem \( y' - y = 1 + 3 \sin t \) with \( y(0) = y_0 \). 

1. **Rewrite the equation**: The given equation is a first-order linear ODE. We rewrite it in standard form as \( y' + (-1)y = 1 + 3 \sin t \).

2. **Integrating Factor**: The integrating factor is \( \mu(t) = e^{\int -1 \, dt} = e^{-t} \).

3. **Multiply through by the integrating factor**:
   \[
   e^{-t} y' - e^{-t} y = e^{-t} (1 + 3 \sin t).
   \]
   The left-hand side is the derivative of \( e^{-t} y \).

4. **Integrate both sides**:
   \[
   \int_0^t \frac{d}{ds} [e^{-s} y(s)] \, ds = \int_0^t e^{-s} (1 + 3 \sin s) \, ds.
   \]
   The left-hand side becomes \( e^{-t} y(t) - y_0 \).

5. **Compute the right-hand side integral**:
   - \( \int e^{-s} \, ds = -e^{-s} \).
   - \( \int e^{-s} \sin s \, ds = \frac{e^{-s}(-\sin s - \cos s)}{2} \).

   Combining these, the integral evaluates to:
   \[
   -e^{-t} + 1 + \frac{3}{2} \left( -e^{-t} \sin t + e^{-t} \cos t \right) - \frac{3}{2}.
   \]

6. **Solve for \( y(t) \)**:
   \[
   e^{-t} y(t) = -e^{-t} + \frac{3}{2} \left( -e^{-t} \sin t + e^{-t} \cos t \right) - \frac{1}{2} + y_0.
   \]
   Multiply through by \( e^t \):
   \[
   y(t) = -1 - \frac{3}{2} \sin t + \frac{3}{2} \cos t - \frac{1}{2} e^t + y_0 e^t.
   \]

7. **Ensure finiteness as \( t \to \infty \)**: The term \( y_0 e^t \) grows exponentially unless \( y_0 = 0 \). However, this neglects other terms. Correctly, the coefficient of \( e^t \) in the solution is \( y_0 + \frac{5}{2} \). To prevent exponential growth, set \( y_0 + \frac{5}{2} = 0 \), giving \( y_0 = -\frac{5}{2} = -2.5 \).

**Answer:** F
