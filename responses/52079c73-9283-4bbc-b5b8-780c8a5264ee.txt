Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Both food and air pass through the pharynx. Explain how these are channeled into the proper tubes so that the food goes into the stomach and the air goes to the lungs.

Options:

A: Air is directed into the lungs by the bronchial sphincter, while food is funneled into the esophagus by the esophageal sphincter
B: When we swallow, the larynx moves up so that the glottis is closed by the epiglottis and the food or liquid passes into the esophagus behind the trachea. Breathing ceases momentarily during swallowing.
C: A flap called the tracheal flap opens and closes to direct food and air into the correct tubes
D: Food and air passages are controlled by a series of muscular valves that open and close in response to swallowing
E: The tongue pushes food into the esophagus, while a muscular reflex diverts air into the trachea
F: The nasal passage contracts to prevent food from entering the lungs while swallowing
G: The diaphragm adjusts its position to guide food and air into the esophagus or trachea, respectively
H: The larynx contracts to direct food and air into the appropriate tubes
I: Food and air are directed by the uvula into the appropriate tubes
J: Food and air are separated by cilia in the pharynx

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how food and air are directed to the right places after passing through the pharynx. I remember from my biology class that the pharynx is a common area where both air and food pass through, but they need to go into different places: food to the stomach and air to the lungs. 

I think the key here is the epiglottis. The epiglottis is a flap that covers the trachea when swallowing, right? So when you swallow, the epiglottis closes off the trachea, preventing food from going into the airway. That makes sense because if food went into the trachea, it could cause choking or enter the lungs, which isn't good. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A mentions the bronchial and esophageal sphincters. I know the esophageal sphincter controls the entrance to the esophagus, but the bronchial part doesn't sound right because the trachea has a cartilage structure, not a sphincter. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B says the larynx moves up and the glottis is closed by the epiglottis, allowing food to go into the esophagus. Also, it mentions breathing stops during swallowing. That sounds familiar. I think when you swallow, the larynx does elevate, and the epiglottis closes, so food goes behind the trachea into the esophagus. And yes, you can't breathe during swallowing because the airway is blocked, so this seems right.

Option C talks about a tracheal flap. I'm not sure what that refers to. The epiglottis is the main structure here, so maybe C is incorrect.

Option D mentions muscular valves controlling the passages. While there are sphincters, the primary action during swallowing is the epiglottis movement, so D might not be the best choice.

Option E suggests the tongue pushes food and a reflex diverts air. The tongue does push food, but the main diverter is the epiglottis, not just a reflex. So E might not be correct.

Option F says the nasal passage contracts to prevent food from entering the lungs. That doesn't seem right because the nasal passage is for breathing, and preventing food would be the epiglottis's job, not the nose.

Option G talks about the diaphragm adjusting position. The diaphragm is involved in breathing, but I don't think it's directly involved in routing food and air during swallowing.

Option H says the larynx contracts to direct things. The larynx does move up, but contraction isn't the main action; it's more about the epiglottis closing.

Option I mentions the uvula directing things. The uvula is part of the soft palate and helps in swallowing by closing off the nasal passages, but it doesn't directly route food and air into the esophagus or trachea.

Option J says cilia in the pharynx separate food and air. I don't recall cilia being involved in this process; instead, it's the epiglottis that physically blocks the trachea.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should involve the epiglottis closing off the trachea when swallowing, and the larynx moving up. Looking back at the options, option B fits this description. It mentions the larynx moving up, the epiglottis closing, and the temporary stop in breathing during swallowing. That's exactly what happens.

The correct answer is option B. When we swallow, the larynx moves up, causing the epiglottis to close and directing food into the esophagus while preventing air from entering the trachea. Breathing briefly stops during this process.

Answer: B
