Okay, so I've got this question about Abraham Maslow and his theories. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but let me think through this. The question is asking which approach expresses the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others, as proposed by Maslow.

Hmm, I remember that Maslow is famous for his hierarchy of needs. Let me recall what that is about. The hierarchy, or pyramid, as I think it's sometimes called, divides human needs into different levels. The lower levels are more basic and necessary for survival, like physiological needs (food, water, shelter), then moving up to safety, social belonging, esteem, and finally self-actualization at the top. So the idea is that you have to satisfy the lower needs before you can focus on the higher ones. That makes sense because without the basics, you can't really be motivated by things like self-esteem or personal growth.

Looking at the options, option B is "Hierarchy of needs," which sounds exactly like what I was just thinking. Option E is "Maslow's pyramid of desire," which I think is another way of referring to the same concept since the pyramid is a visual representation of the hierarchy. So E might also be a correct choice, but I think the term "hierarchy of needs" is more commonly used in psychological contexts.

Wait, but the question is about approaches that express the idea that some motives are more imperative. So Maslow's hierarchy specifically ranks these needs, showing that some are more fundamental. So the hierarchy is about the order and priority of needs. That's different from other theories like drive reduction theory, which is more about reducing physiological drives, or self-determination theory, which talks about intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.

Let me check the other options quickly. Option A is homeostatic regulation, which I think is more about maintaining internal balance, like temperature or hunger, but not about prioritizing different types of needs. Option F is drive reduction theory, which is about reducing tension through satisfying basic needs, but it's a different approach from Maslow's. Options C, D, G, H, I, J are all other theories by different psychologists, like Self-Determination Theory by Deci and Ryan, Goal-Setting by Locke, etc.

So the correct answer should be either B or E. But the question is about the approach that expresses the idea of some motives being more imperative. Since the hierarchy explicitly ranks the needs, I think B is the better answer. E is more of a term that describes the same structure, but the question is asking for the approach, which would be the hierarchy itself.

The correct answer is B: Hierarchy of needs. Maslow's theory explicitly ranks needs, showing that some are more fundamental for survival, aligning with the idea that certain motives are more imperative.

Answer: B
