Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ï¿¡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around."

Options:

A: The Zulu lands offered fertile soil for agricultural activities.
B: A gold rush ensued following the discovery of gold on Zulu lands.
C: The British government offered tax incentives to citizens moving to Zulu lands.

H: The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa.

Alright, so I've got this question about why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867. The question refers to a letter from a British citizen during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879, but the event in question is 1867. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because the letter is from 1879, but the migration is about 1867. Maybe the letter is just context, and the actual question is about the reasons for migration in an earlier time.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which reason best explains the large movement of Europeans to Zulu lands in 1867. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The Zulu lands offered fertile soil for agricultural activities. That makes sense because fertile land is a common reason for settlement. But I'm not sure if that's the specific reason for a large movement in 1867.

Option B: A gold rush ensued following the discovery of gold on Zulu lands. I know that the discovery of minerals, like diamonds and gold, often attracts people. The Witwatersrand gold rush started in 1886, though, which is after 1867. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option C: The British government offered tax incentives. Tax incentives can be a motivator, but I'm not sure if this was the main reason for moving to Zulu lands specifically in 1867.

Option D: The Zulu created attractive trade ports. The Zulu were more known for their military prowess and less for trade ports. Plus, I don't recall them building major ports during that time.

Option E: A diamond rush after diamonds were found. The Kimberley diamond rush started in the 1870s, which is close to 1867 but perhaps not exactly the same time. Wait, the first diamonds were found in 1867 in Kimberley, which is in what's now South Africa. Oh, that's exactly the time frame! So the diamond rush in 1867 would have attracted many Europeans to the area, including Zulu lands.

Option F: British military offered land grants. This could be a reason, but I'm not sure if this was a widespread incentive in 1867.

Option G: Attracted by cultural heritage. That seems less likely as a reason for mass migration.

Option H: British crown offered incentives for homesteads. This is possible, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason in 1867.

Option I: Free passage offered. Again, possible, but not sure.

Option J: Berlin Conference clarified boundaries. The Berlin Conference was in 1884, so that's too late for 1867.

Wait, so focusing on option E: the diamond rush. The first diamonds were found in 1867 in the Kimberley region, which was part of the Zulu territories. So that would have led to a rush of Europeans moving there to mine diamonds. That makes sense as a reason for large-scale migration.

So the answer should be E. Diamonds were discovered in 1867, leading to a rush, which explains the movement.

The correct answer is E. The discovery of diamonds in 1867 led to a diamond rush, attracting a large number of Europeans to the Zulu lands.
