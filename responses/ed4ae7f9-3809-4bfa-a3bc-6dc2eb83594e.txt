Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about orbital resonance and what it doesn't cause. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which of the options are NOT caused by orbital resonance. The options are A through E. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to remember what I know.

First, let me recall what orbital resonance is. From what I remember, orbital resonance occurs when two objects exert a gravitational influence on each other that is in a ratio of small integers. This can lead to various effects, like stabilizing or destabilizing orbits, or even causing gaps in rings around planets.

Now, looking at each option:

Option A: Gaps in Saturn's rings. I think that gaps are caused by orbital resonances with Saturn's moons. For example, the Cassini Division is a big gap in Saturn's rings, and it's caused by the moon Mimas. So this is caused by resonance. So A is caused by resonance, so it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option B: Kirkwood Gaps. These are gaps in the asteroid belt. I remember that Kirkwood gaps are caused by orbital resonances with Jupiter. For instance, when asteroids are in a 3:1 or 2:1 resonance with Jupiter's orbit, they get pulled out of their orbits, leading to gaps. So B is caused by resonance, so not the answer.

Option C: The Cassini Division in Saturn's rings. As I thought earlier, this is a gap caused by Mimas. The Cassini Division is a clear space between the A and B rings, and it's due to resonance. So C is caused by resonance, so not the answer.

Option D: 2:3 periodic ratio of Neptune:Pluto. Wait, I think Pluto's orbit is in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune. That means for every three orbits Pluto makes, Neptune makes two. This resonance helps keep Pluto's orbit stable. So D is caused by resonance. So D is not the answer.

Option E: Breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this one. I know that when small moons are disrupted, they can form rings. But is that due to orbital resonance? I'm trying to remember. Orbital resonance usually affects the structure of rings, like creating gaps. But the breaking of moons into rings... I think that's more about tidal forces or collisions, not resonance. So E might not be caused by orbital resonance. So E could be the answer we're looking for.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there cases where resonance causes moons to break apart? I don't remember resonance directly causing moons to break apart. It's more about clearing out gaps. So E is probably not caused by resonance, making it the correct answer.

The question asks which option is NOT caused by orbital resonance. Orbital resonance involves gravitational interactions that can create gaps in planetary rings or stabilize orbits. 

- **A**: Gaps in Saturn's rings, like the Cassini Division, are caused by resonance with moons. 
- **B**: Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt are due to resonance with Jupiter.
- **C**: The Cassini Division is a well-known gap caused by resonance with Mimas.
- **D**: The 2:3 resonance between Neptune and Pluto stabilizes Pluto's orbit.
- **E**: The breaking of small Jovian moons into ring materials is not caused by resonance but by other factors like tidal forces or collisions.

Thus, the answer is E.
