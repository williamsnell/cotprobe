Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Arnold Gesell and his contributions to school psychology. I'm a bit rusty on my history of psychology, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Arnold Gesell was a prominent figure in child psychology. He's often associated with the concept of developmental milestones. I think he did a lot of work observing children and their growth patterns. One thing that comes to mind is his studies on the development of motor skills in infants, maybe even creating some kind of assessment for that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Developed the first standardized test for elementary school kids. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Standardized testing in schools... I think there were others like Lewis Terman who worked on IQ tests, but I'm not certain if Gesell was the first with a standardized test for elementary kids.

Option B: Introduced emotional intelligence in education. Emotional intelligence is more associated with people like Peter Salovey and Daniel Goleman. Gesell's work was more about cognitive and motor development, so probably not B.

Option C: Created a classification system for learning disabilities. Learning disabilities as a field... I think that was more in the 60s and 70s with people like Samuel Kirk. Gesell was earlier, maybe in the early 20th century, so probably not C.

Option D: Developed a version of the Thematic Apperception Test for children. The TAT is a projective test, and I think it was created by Henry Murray, not Gesell. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E: Identified the four major periods of cognitive development. That sounds like Jean Piaget, who talked about sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational stages. Gesell's work was more about motor development and perhaps more continuous, so E is probably not the answer.

Option F: Advocated for including special needs students in mainstream classrooms. I think Gesell's work was more about understanding child development and creating assessments rather than focusing on inclusion policies. So F might not be it.

Option G: Established ethical standards for NASP. I'm not sure about this. I think ethical standards were developed by the organization itself over time, and while Gesell contributed, this might not be his key contribution.

Option H: Pioneered psychoanalysis in schools. Psychoanalysis is more Freudian, and I don't think Gesell was into that. He was more observational and empirical, so H is probably wrong.

Option I: Devised a normative assessment for infants and young children. This rings a bell. I think Gesell created something called the Gesell Developmental Schedules, which are norm-referenced tests assessing motor, language, social, and cognitive development in young children. So I is likely correct.

Option J: Established the first school psychology graduate program. I'm not certain, but I think that was someone else, maybe E. A. Kolb or another pioneer, but I might be mixing things up. Gesell was at Yale and worked on child development, so maybe J isn't the right answer.

Wait, another thought: Gesell did a lot of work on motor development and created those schedules. So the key here is that he developed a normative assessment for infants and young children, which would be option I. So the answer should be I.

Arnold Gesell is best known for his work in child development, particularly his creation of the Gesell Developmental Schedules, which are normative assessments for infants and young children. These assessments evaluate motor, language, social, and cognitive development. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I

The answer is I.
