Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the heat of formation for methane (CH4) using some given reactions. I'm a bit rusty on thermochemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The main reaction I need to consider is C(graphite) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g). The ΔH° for this reaction is what I'm supposed to find. They've given me three other reactions with their ΔH° values, so I'll need to use those somehow.

Let me list out the given reactions again:

1. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l) ; ΔH° = -212.80 kcal/mol
2. C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2(g) ; ΔH° = -94.05 kcal/mol
3. H2(g) + ½ O2(g) → H2O(l) ; ΔH° = -68.32 kcal/mol

Hmm, I think I need to use Hess's Law here, which allows us to add reactions together to get the desired reaction, and their ΔH° will add up as well.

So, the target reaction is the formation of CH4 from its elements. The formation reactions typically involve elements in their standard states. So, I need to find a way to express the formation of CH4 using the given reactions.

Wait, let's see. The target reaction is:

C(graphite) + 2 H2 → CH4(g) ; ΔH° = ?

I need to derive this reaction from the given ones. Let me look at each given reaction and see how they can be manipulated.

First, let me think about each reaction's role. The first reaction burns CH4 to produce CO2 and H2O. The second reaction involves graphite carbon reacting with something to form CO2. The third is the formation of H2O from H2 and O2.

Maybe I can manipulate these to get the formation of CH4. Let's think about breaking down each reaction.

Let me label the reactions for clarity:

Reaction 1: CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O ; ΔH1 = -212.80
Reaction 2: C + C2 → CO2 ; ΔH2 = -94.05
Reaction 3: H2 + ½ O2 → H2O ; ΔH3 = -68.32

Wait a second, in Reaction 2, it's C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2. That seems a bit odd because I'm not sure what C2 is. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo, and it should be O2. Because, in the reaction, CO2 is produced, so perhaps it's C + O2 → CO2. Wait, but that's not what's written. Hmm, maybe it's C plus something else.

Wait, let me check the original problem again. The second reaction is written as: C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2(g), ΔH° = -94.05. Hmm, that's strange. Maybe it's a typo and should be O2 instead of C2. Because otherwise, it's C plus C2 forming CO2, which doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo for something else, but I'll proceed with what's given.

Alternatively, perhaps it's correct, but I'm not sure. Let me consider that Reaction 2 is C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2(g), which would mean that C2 is a reactant. That seems a bit odd because C2 isn't a common form, but I'll proceed.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 2 is actually a typo, and the correct reaction is 2C(graphite) + O2 → CO2, but that's not what's written. Alternatively, maybe it's C(graphite) + O2 → CO2, but the given reaction says C2. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake, but I'll go with what's given.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the reactions. Let me think about the desired reaction. I need to get CH4 from C and H2. So, perhaps I can express CH4 in terms of the products of the given reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the formation of CH4 as the sum of smaller reactions. For example, using the reactions to express the formation of CO2 and H2O, and then combine them.

Let me think: the formation of CH4 is the reverse of Reaction 1, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the formation of CO2 and H2O from elements and then combine them to get CH4.

Wait, perhaps I should write the given reactions in terms of the target reaction.

Let me consider each reaction:

Reaction 1: CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O ; ΔH1 = -212.80 kcal/mol

If I reverse this, I get:

CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80 kcal/mol

Reaction 2: C + C2 → CO2 ; ΔH2 = -94.05

I'm not sure what C2 is here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo for O2. Let's assume for a moment that it's O2, so Reaction 2 would be:

C + O2 → CO2 ; ΔH2 = -94.05

That makes more sense. Let me proceed with that assumption because otherwise, the problem becomes a bit confusing.

So, assuming Reaction 2 is C + O2 → CO2 with ΔH = -94.05 kcal/mol.

Similarly, Reaction 3 is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O ; ΔH3 = -68.32

Now, with these corrected, let's proceed.

The target reaction is:

C + 2 H2 → CH4 ; ΔH = ?

I can express this target reaction as the sum of three reactions:

1. Formation of CO2 from C and O2 (Reaction 2)
2. Formation of H2O from H2 and O2 (Reaction 3 multiplied by 2)
3. Then, use the reverse of Reaction 1 to get CH4.

Wait, perhaps let me think in terms of the standard formation reactions. The formation of CH4 would be from elements in their standard states: C(graphite) and H2(g).

So, I can write the formation of CH4 as:

C(graphite) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g) ; ΔH = ?

To find this, I can use the given reactions to form CO2 and H2O, and then combine them to get CH4.

Let me outline the steps:

1. First, find the formation of CO2 from C(graphite) and O2. That's given by Reaction 2, but wait, Reaction 2 as corrected is C + O2 → CO2, ΔH = -94.05.

2. Then, find the formation of H2O from H2 and O2. That's Reaction 3, which is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O, ΔH = -68.32.

3. Now, I can combine these to form CO2 and H2O, and then use the reverse of Reaction 1 to get CH4.

Wait, let me think again. The first reaction is the combustion of CH4 to CO2 and H2O. So, if I reverse Reaction 1, I get:

CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80

So, now, if I have the reactions:

a. C + O2 → CO2 ; ΔH = -94.05 (from Reaction 2)
b. 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O ; ΔH = 2*(-68.32) = -136.64 (since Reaction 3 is per mole, so multiplied by 2)
c. CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80 (reverse of Reaction 1)

Now, if I add reactions a, b, and c together:

(C + O2) + (2 H2 + O2) + (CO2 + 2 H2O) → (CO2) + (2 H2O) + (CH4 + 2 O2)

Let me simplify the left and right sides.

Left side: C + O2 + 2 H2 + O2 + CO2 + 2 H2O
Right side: CO2 + 2 H2O + CH4 + 2 O2

Wait, actually, when adding the reactions, the intermediates (CO2 and H2O) should cancel out. Let me check:

Reaction a: C → CO2 (with O2 as reactant)
Reaction b: 2 H2 → 2 H2O (with O2 as reactant)
Reaction c: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 (with O2 as product)

When I add them:

C + O2 + 2 H2 + O2 + CO2 + 2 H2O → CO2 + 2 H2O + CH4 + 2 O2

Now, let's cancel the intermediates:

CO2 on both sides cancels. 2 H2O on both sides cancels. O2 on the left is O2 + O2, and on the right, it's 2 O2. So, O2 cancels as well.

So, what's left is:

C + 2 H2 → CH4

Which is exactly the target reaction. So, the sum of a + b + c gives the target reaction.

Now, let me sum the ΔH values:

ΔH_total = ΔH_a + ΔH_b + ΔH_c

ΔH_a = -94.05 kcal/mol
ΔH_b = -136.64 kcal/mol (since 2 * (-68.32) = -136.64)
ΔH_c = +212.80 kcal/mol

So, adding them up:

-94.05 + (-136.64) + 212.80 = ?

Let me compute:

-94.05 -136.64 = -230.69

Then, -230.69 + 212.80 = -17.89 kcal/mol

So, the ΔH° for the target reaction is -17.89 kcal/mol.

Looking back at the options, option B is -17.89 kcal/mol. So, the answer should be B.

To calculate the heat of formation of CH₄(g), we use Hess's Law to combine the given reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: CH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(l), ΔH° = -212.80 kcal/mol  
   Reverse this reaction: CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(l) → CH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g), ΔH° = +212.80 kcal/mol  

2. **Reaction 2**: C(graphite) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g), ΔH° = -94.05 kcal/mol  

3. **Reaction 3**: H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(l), ΔH° = -68.32 kcal/mol  
   Multiply by 2: 2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(l), ΔH° = 2 × (-68.32) = -136.64 kcal/mol  

Combine the reactions:  
- C(graphite) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) (ΔH = -94.05)  
- 2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(l) (ΔH = -136.64)  
- CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(l) → CH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) (ΔH = +212.80)  

Adding these gives:  
C(graphite) + 2 H₂(g) → CH₄(g), ΔH° = (-94.05) + (-136.64) + (+212.80) = -17.89 kcal/mol  

Thus, the heat of formation of CH₄(g) is **-17.89 kcal/mol**, corresponding to option B.
