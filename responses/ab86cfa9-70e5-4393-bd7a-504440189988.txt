Question:

On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. If the mother asserts a wrongful death action against the doctor, she will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.
B: not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.
C: not prevail, because the hospital, not the doctor, is responsible for the errors of its employees.
D: prevail, because the doctor had a duty of care to ensure the correct blood type was administered.
E: prevail, because the doctor's failure to follow the hospital's rules indirectly led to the father's death.
F: not prevail, because the doctor did not personally administer the wrong blood type.
G: not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.
H: not prevail, because the doctor gave correct instructions to the nurse.
I: prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.
J: prevail, because the doctor should have ensured that the nurse followed the hospital's rule for blood transfusion orders.

Okay, so I need to figure out which answer is correct for this question. Let's break down the situation step by step.

The scenario is about a father who cut his hand seriously while carving a turkey. His artery was severed, causing significant blood loss. The mother called the family doctor, who told her to take him to the hospital and said he'd meet them there. At the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand but then ordered a blood transfusion because the father had lost a lot of blood. The father's blood type was A-positive, so the doctor told the nurse to get A-positive blood. The nurse called the blood bank, and the person there correctly wrote down the order for A-positive. However, someone in the blood bank made a mistake and sent B-positive blood labeled as A-positive. The father received the wrong blood and died.

The hospital has a rule that all blood transfusion orders must be made in writing by the physician. The doctor knew this rule but often gave oral orders, like many other doctors at the hospital.

The mother is suing the doctor for wrongful death. The question is about whether she will prevail.

First, I need to consider the legal principles here. Wrongful death cases usually involve proving that the defendant's negligence caused the death. So, did the doctor's actions (or inactions) meet the standard of care, and was that the cause of the father's death?

The hospital's rule requires written orders for blood transfusions. The doctor, however, gave an oral order. But he's not alone in doing so; many other doctors there do the same. So, perhaps the hospital's rule isn't strictly enforced, or it's a common practice, which might affect the standard of care.

Now, the blood bank error: the blood was mislabeled, leading to the wrong transfusion. The person who made the error is unknown, but they're an employee of the hospital, not the doctor.

So, looking at the options, let's analyze each possibility.

Option A says the mother will prevail because the doctor is responsible for the blood bank's error. But the blood bank is part of the hospital, so the responsibility might lie with the hospital, not the doctor, unless the doctor's negligence directly caused it.

Option B says she won't prevail because the blood bank employee wasn't the doctor's employee. That makes sense because the blood bank is part of the hospital, so the doctor isn't liable for their actions.

Option C says she won't prevail because the hospital is responsible for its employees' errors. That also makes sense. The hospital is the employer of the blood bank staff, so any negligence there would be the hospital's responsibility.

Option D says she will prevail because the doctor had a duty to ensure correct blood type. But the duty here is about the standard of care. Did the doctor's failure in ordering blood (orally instead of written) cause the error? Maybe, but the actual error was in the blood bank's labeling, not the order.

Option E says she will prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rules, leading to the death. But the direct cause was the wrong blood being given, which was the hospital's fault. So the doctor's failure to follow the rule might be negligence, but was it the cause of death? The order was correct (A-positive), but the blood was wrong. So the doctor's oral order might not have been the cause.

Option F says she won't prevail because the doctor didn't administer the wrong blood. That's correct; the doctor ordered the right blood type, but the hospital messed up. So the doctor isn't responsible for the administration error.

Option G says she won't prevail because the doctor acted like others. This is about whether the doctor's conduct met the standard of care. If many doctors do it, maybe it's not negligence. But if the rule is clear, then following it is part of the standard.

Option H says she won't prevail because the doctor gave correct instructions. Yes, he told the nurse to get A-positive, which was correct. The error was in the blood bank, not the order.

Option I says she will prevail because the doctor didn't follow the rule. The rule requires written orders. The doctor gave an oral order. If the failure to follow the rule was a breach of duty, and that breach contributed to the father's death, then the doctor might be liable. But here, the order was correct; the problem was in the blood bank's execution. So the breach of the rule might not be the cause of the father's death.

Option J says she will prevail because the doctor should have ensured the nurse followed the rule. So, the doctor's duty was to make sure the order was in writing. If he didn't, and that led to an error, he might be liable. However, in this case, the order was correctly taken by the nurse, but the blood bank made the mistake. So the broken rule might not be the cause.

Putting it all together, the key issue is whether the doctor's oral order (breaching the hospital's rule) caused the father's death. The problem arose from the blood bank's mistake, not the order itself. Therefore, the hospital is responsible for the blood error, not the doctor. The mother's claim against the doctor might fail because the doctor's negligence (if any) in ordering orally didn't cause the father's deathâ€”the cause was the hospital's blood bank error.

Looking at the options, options B and C suggest the mother won't prevail because the hospital's employees are responsible, not the doctor. Option I and J focus on the rule, but the cause was elsewhere. So, the correct answer is likely option C or B. Option B says the blood bank employee wasn't the doctor's employee, which is true. So, the doctor isn't liable for the blood bank's mistake because they're not his employees.

Therefore, the answer should be option C or B. Between them, C says the hospital is responsible for its employees, which is correct. So option C is correct.

The mother's claim against the doctor is unlikely to prevail because the hospital is responsible for the errors of its employees in the blood bank, not the doctor. The doctor correctly ordered A-positive blood, and the issue arose from the hospital's internal mistake.
