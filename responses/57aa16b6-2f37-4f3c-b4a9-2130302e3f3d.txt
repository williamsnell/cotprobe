Question:

Discuss the influence of heredity on emotionalresponsivity for both animals and humans.

Options:

A: Heredity has no impact on emotional responsivity
B: Heredity provides a predisposition for emotional responsivity, but it is ultimately shaped by early childhood experiences
C: Heredity influences only basic emotions, while complex emotions are entirely learned
D: Emotional responsivity is not inherited, but learned
E: Environment solely influences emotional responsivity
F: Heredity is influential in emotional responsivity, as seen in animal and human studies demonstrating genetic influence on emotional reactions
G: Emotional responsivity is equally determined by heredity and environment with no variation among individuals
H: Emotional responsivity is a random process, not influenced by heredity or environment
I: Heredity determines emotional responsivity completely, with no role for the environment
J: Emotional responsivity is determined solely by individual learning experiences, with heredity playing no role

Okay, so I've got this question about the influence of heredity on emotional responsivity in both animals and humans. I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that emotional responsivity refers to how individuals respond emotionally to different situations. I've heard that both genetics and environment play a role in shaping behavior and traits, including emotional ones. So, I should consider the role of heredity here.

Option A says heredity has no impact. That doesn't seem right because I know there's research showing that genetics can influence traits like anxiety, depression, and other emotional disorders, which tie into emotional responsivity.

Option B suggests heredity provides a predisposition but is shaped by early experiences. This makes sense because while genes might set the stage, the environment and upbringing can influence how those traits develop. For example, a child might inherit a tendency towards shyness, but their parents' interactions can either exacerbate or mitigate that trait.

Option C claims heredity affects only basic emotions, leaving complex ones to learning. I'm not sure about this. I think basic emotions like fear or anger are indeed influenced by genetics, but complex emotions might also have some genetic components. Plus, I don't recall if the line between basic and complex is so clear-cut in terms of heredity.

Option D says emotional responsivity isn't inherited but learned. That doesn't align with what I know about twin studies showing that some emotional traits are heritable. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E states the environment solely influences it. Again, this ignores the genetic component, so E is likely wrong.

Option F mentions heredity's influence with studies showing genetic impacts on emotional reactions in both animals and humans. I remember reading about studies on animals, like mice with certain gene mutations showing different fear responses. In humans, twin studies have shown significant heritability for traits like emotional reactivity. So F seems plausible.

Option G says heredity and environment equally determine it. While both are important, I don't think they contribute exactly 50-50 in every case. Some traits might be more heritable, others more influenced by the environment.

Option H suggests it's random, which doesn't fit with the evidence of heredity and environment both playing roles.

Option I claims heredity determines it completely. That's probably an overstatement because environmental factors also play a significant role, though perhaps not as strong as I thought initially.

Option J says it's solely determined by learning. Again, this ignores the genetic component, so J is incorrect.

So, considering all this, the best options seem to be B and F. B talks about heredity as a predisposition and environment shaping it, which is a balanced view. F directly mentions heredity's influence supported by studies.

Wait, but the question asks about both animals and humans. Option F says heredity is influential as seen in studies on both. That's broad and accurate. Option B is also correct in a way, emphasizing that heredity provides a predisposition, but the environment plays a role in shaping it.

Hmm, but the question is about the influence, not the interaction between heredity and environment. So F is more about heredity's role, while B is about the interplay. The question asks for the influence of heredity, so F directly addresses that with evidence from studies.

Thus, the answer should be F.

The influence of heredity on emotional responsivity is supported by studies in both animals and humans. Heredity provides a predisposition, but the environment shapes these traits. However, the question focuses on heredity's role, which is accurately described in option F.

Answer: F
