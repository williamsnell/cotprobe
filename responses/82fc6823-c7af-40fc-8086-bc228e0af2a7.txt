Okay, so I have this question: What is the value of log 0.0148? And I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, let's see. I remember that log typically refers to base 10 logarithm unless specified otherwise. So I need to calculate log₁₀(0.0148).

First, I should think about how logarithms work. Logarithms of numbers less than 1 are negative because they're the reciprocal of numbers greater than 1. So, for example, log(0.1) is -1 because 10^-1 is 0.1.

Now, 0.0148 is a small number, so its log should definitely be negative. Looking at the options, I can eliminate options that are positive: A (3.0000), G (0.0148), H (1.8297), I (0.1703), and J (2.0000). So the possible answers are B, C, D, or E, F, etc.

Next, I'll try to approximate log(0.0148). I know that 0.0148 is between 0.01 and 0.1. Let me write down some log values I remember:

- log(0.1) = -1
- log(0.01) = -2
- log(0.001) = -3

Wait, but 0.0148 is between 0.01 and 0.1. So its log should be between -1 and -2. That narrows it down. Let me see the options between -2 and -1. Options C is -2.1703, E is -1.1703, F is -1.8297.

Wait, no: 0.0148 is 0.01 < 0.0148 < 0.1. So log(0.0148) should be between -2 and -1. So options between -2 and -1 are C (-2.1703), E (-1.1703), F (-1.8297), and D (-0.8297). Wait, D is -0.8297 which is greater than -1, so it's actually between 0.1 and 1, which doesn't fit because 0.0148 is less than 0.1. So D is too high. So possible options are C, E, F.

Wait, maybe I should think more precisely. Let me try to express 0.0148 as a power of 10. 0.0148 is 1.48 × 10^-2. So log(0.0148) = log(1.48 × 10^-2) = log(1.48) + log(10^-2) = log(1.48) - 2.

I know that log(1) = 0 and log(2) ≈ 0.3010. So log(1.48) should be between 0 and 0.18. Because 10^0.18 is around 1.5, maybe. Let me check: 10^0.1761 is about 1.5 because log(1.5) ≈ 0.1761. So 1.48 is a bit less than 1.5, so log(1.48) would be a bit less than 0.1761, maybe around 0.17 or 0.16.

So log(1.48) ≈ 0.17, so log(0.0148) ≈ 0.17 - 2 = -1.83. Looking at the options, option F is -1.8297, which is very close to -1.83. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Another way to think is using natural logarithm and then converting, but that might complicate. Alternatively, I can use logarithm properties.

Alternatively, I know that 0.0148 is 148 × 10^-4, so log(0.0148) = log(148) - 4. log(148) is log(1.48 × 100) = log(1.48) + 2. So log(0.0148) = log(1.48) + 2 - 4 = log(1.48) - 2. Which brings me back to the same calculation. So again, log(1.48) is about 0.17, so 0.17 - 2 = -1.83. So option F is -1.8297, which seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is -1.1703, which is -1.17, which would be if log(1.48) was around 0.17, but subtracting 2 would give -1.83, which is option F.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the calculation? Let me think: log(0.01) is -2, log(0.1) is -1. So 0.0148 is between 0.01 and 0.1, closer to 0.01 than to 0.1. So the log should be closer to -2 than to -1. So between -2 and -1, closer to -2. So -1.83 is in that range. So yes, option F is correct.

The value of log 0.0148 is approximately -1.8297, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
