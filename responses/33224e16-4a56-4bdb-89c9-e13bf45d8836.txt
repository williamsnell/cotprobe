Question:

Sea divers are aware of a danger known as the "bends". Explain the physiological mechanism of the bends.

Options:

A: Carbon dioxide bubbles forming in the blood causing acidosis
B: Rapid increase in barometric pressure causing the bends
C: Formation of helium bubbles in the bloodstream due to rapid ascent
D: Increased salinity in the water leading to dehydration and joint pain
E: Oxygen bubbles forming in the blood leading to hypoxia
F: Lack of oxygen while breathing under high pressure leading to the bends
G: Accumulation of lactic acid in muscles due to strenuous activity underwater
H: Sudden decrease in water temperature causing muscle cramping and disorientation
I: Rise in blood pressure due to underwater currents, resulting in the bends
J: Bubbles of nitrogen gas form in the blood and other tissue fluids when the barometric pressure drops below the total pressure of all gases dissolved in the body fluids, causing dizziness, paralysis, and unconsciousness, known as the bends.

Okay, so I have this question about the bends that sea divers experience. I'm a bit rusty on my diving physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the physiological mechanism behind the bends. Let me see what each option says.

First, I remember that the bends, also known as decompression sickness, have something to do with gases in the body. When divers go deep underwater, they breathe compressed air, which means higher pressure. The gases in the air (like nitrogen, oxygen, and others) get dissolved into the bloodstream under high pressure.

Now, when they start ascending, the water pressure decreases. If they come up too quickly, the pressure drops rapidly, and the dissolved gases, especially nitrogen, start to form bubbles in the blood. These bubbles can cause all sorts of problems because they block blood flow and damage tissues.

Looking at the options:

A: Carbon dioxide causing acidosis. I don't think that's it because CO2 issues are more about respiration and acidosis, not the bends.

B: Rapid increase in barometric pressure. Wait, barometric pressure increases when going deeper, but the bends happen when pressure decreases, so this might be the opposite.

C: Helium bubbles. I thought helium is used in some diving mixtures, but the bends are typically associated with nitrogen, not helium.

D: Increased salinity. That's about water in the body, dehydration maybe, but not directly linked to gas bubbles.

E: Oxygen bubbles. Oxygen is essential, but if too much forms bubbles, I think it's more about oxygen toxicity, not the bends.

F: Lack of oxygen under high pressure. That's hypoxia, but the bends are about excess gas, not lack.

G: Lactic acid from muscles. That's more about exercise and fatigue, not directly related to decompression.

H: Cold water causing cramping. It's a risk, but not the cause of the bends.

I: High blood pressure from currents. Maybe, but not the main cause.

J: Nitrogen bubbles when pressure drops. This sounds exactly right. Nitrogen is inert, so it doesn't react but can form bubbles when pressure decreases. Symptoms like dizziness, paralysis, unconsciousness fit with the bends.

So, putting it together, the bends occur when dissolved nitrogen forms bubbles as pressure drops during ascent. That matches option J.

The bends, or decompression sickness, occur when dissolved nitrogen gas in the bloodstream forms bubbles during rapid ascent due to a drop in water pressure. This causes symptoms like dizziness, paralysis, and unconsciousness. 

Answer: J
