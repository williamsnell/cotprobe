Question:

Tay-Sachs is a disease caused by a recessive allele. Individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years, and thus are not able to reproduce and pass on the gene. What would explain how this allele and its associated disease is preserved in the population?

Options:

A: Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual.
B: Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive.
C: The recessive allele is actually beneficial in certain environments.
D: The disease increases the fertility of those who carry it.
E: Tay-Sachs is a dominant disease, so carriers will show symptoms.
F: Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form.
G: Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.
H: The gene for Tay-Sachs also provides resistance to another disease.
I: The disease can be cured, so individuals with the disorder are able to reproduce.
J: The allele is not preserved and is actually decreasing in frequency.

Okay, so I have this question about Tay-Sachs disease and why the recessive allele that causes it is still preserved in the population. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Tay-Sachs is a recessive disorder. That means you need two copies of the defective allele to actually get the disease. People who are carriers, meaning they have one normal and one recessive allele, usually don't show any symptoms. So they're phenotypically normal but can pass the gene on.

The question says that individuals with the disease don't survive long and can't reproduce. So, they can't pass the allele to the next generation. That seems like it should mean the allele would disappear, right? But the question is asking why it's still preserved. So I need to think about why a recessive allele would remain in the population despite this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual. Hmm, that's possible. Maybe in some cases, the allele provides a benefit, like sickle cell where it confers resistance to malaria. But I don't recall Tay-Sachs being linked to any such advantage. Not sure, but maybe.

Option B: Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive. Wait, no. Homozygous recessive individuals do have the disease. They show symptoms and usually don't survive. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The recessive allele is actually beneficial in certain environments. I'm not sure about this one. If it was beneficial, maybe it would be maintained. But I don't think Tay-Sachs is known for having such a benefit. So maybe not C.

Option D: The disease increases the fertility of those who carry it. Carriers are heterozygotes, right? I don't think being a carrier makes you more fertile. In fact, carriers (heterozygotes) are more likely to pass the gene, but fertility isn't directly linked. So D seems unlikely.

Option E: Tay-Sachs is a dominant disease, so carriers will show symptoms. No, that's not correct. Tay-Sachs is recessive, so carriers don't show symptoms. So E is wrong.

Option F: Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form. Mutation can introduce new alleles, but Tay-Sachs is a recessive disease, and once it's rare, the chance of new mutations adding to it is probably low. Plus, most people don't have the allele in the first place, so F might not explain why it's preserved.

Option G: Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms. Yes, that's right. Carriers don't get the disease. So they can pass the allele on without being affected themselves. That's a key point. So G is correct, but how does that answer the question? Well, because carriers don't have symptoms, they can reproduce and pass on the allele, even though the homozygous recessive individuals don't survive. So G is a factor in preserving the allele.

Option H: The gene for Tay-Sachs also provides resistance to another disease. I don't remember this being the case. Some genetic diseases do have this, like sickle cell, but I'm not sure about Tay-Sachs. So H might not be correct.

Option I: The disease can be cured, so individuals with the disorder are able to reproduce. No, Tay-Sachs is a fatal disease, and I don't think it's curable. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The allele is not preserved and is actually decreasing in frequency. Well, the question is asking why it's preserved, so J is the opposite of the correct answer.

So putting it together, the main reason the allele is preserved is because carriers (heterozygotes) don't show symptoms and can pass the allele to their offspring. Therefore, option G explains why the allele is still present in the population despite the disease being lethal in homozygous individuals.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is why the allele is preserved. So if carriers don't show symptoms, they can reproduce and pass on the allele. Even though homozygous individuals don't survive, the carriers do, so the allele remains in the gene pool. That makes sense. So G is the correct answer.

The allele for Tay-Sachs is preserved in the population because heterozygous individuals (carriers) do not exhibit the disease and can pass the recessive allele to their offspring. While homozygous recessive individuals with the disease do not survive long enough to reproduce, carriers remain unaffected and contribute to the gene's persistence. 

Answer: G
