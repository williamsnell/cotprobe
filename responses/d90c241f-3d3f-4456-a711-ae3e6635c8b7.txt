Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about support vector machines (SVMs). Let me break it down step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate each one to determine if they're true or false. The options provided are various combinations of true, false, not applicable, etc.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "Support vector machines, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example."

I remember that SVMs are primarily used for classification and regression. For classification, SVMs output a decision boundary, or hyperplane, that separates classes. However, they don't inherently provide probabilities like logistic regression does. Logistic regression gives the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class by using a sigmoid function, which outputs values between 0 and 1. 

SVMs, on the other hand, can be used to estimate probabilities, but it's not their default behavior. You can use something called Platt scaling to convert the SVM's output into probabilities, but that's an additional step and not something SVMs do out of the box. So, without that step, SVMs don't give probability distributions like logistic regression. Therefore, Statement 1 seems to be false.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: "We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels."

Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and are crucial in defining the SVM's model. The kernel function determines how the data is transformed into a higher-dimensional space. A linear kernel doesn't transform the data at all; it's just the dot product. Higher order polynomial kernels, like degree 2 or 3, will transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, possibly making the data more separable.

If we switch from a linear kernel to a higher order polynomial kernel, the decision boundary becomes more flexible. This could mean that the support vectors change because the transformation alters how the data is separated. In the linear case, certain points are support vectors, but with a higher-degree kernel, the model might capture more complex patterns, leading to different points being the support vectors. So, the support vectors are likely to change when the kernel changes. Therefore, Statement 2 is also false.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Does the change in kernel always change the support vectors? Well, in some cases, maybe not, but generally, moving to a higher order kernel increases the model's capacity, allowing it to fit more complex boundaries. So, it's probable that the support vectors would change, making Statement 2 false.

So, evaluating both statements:

Statement 1: False
Statement 2: False

Looking at the options:

Option D is "False, False". That seems to fit.

I don't think the statements are not applicable or anything else. So, the correct answer should be D.

The first statement is false because SVMs do not inherently provide probability distributions like logistic regression. They can be modified to do so, but it's not their default behavior. The second statement is also false because support vectors can change when moving from a linear to a higher-order kernel, as the kernel affects the decision boundary's flexibility.

Answer: D
