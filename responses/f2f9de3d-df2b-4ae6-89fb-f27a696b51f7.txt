Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question. The question is about what Hill wants to ask instead of why destroying the environment might be immoral. Let's break it down.

First, the original question is about the immorality of destroying the environment. Hill isn't asking that; instead, he's shifting the focus. I need to find an option that reflects a different angle on the same topic.

Looking at the options:

A: How preserving benefits the environment. That seems more about the positive effects, not about the act of destruction.

B: How destruction affects the economy. That's an economic perspective, not directly about morality.

C: Why people who preserve are good. This is about the moral aspect of preservation, not destruction.

D: How destruction affects future generations. This is about consequences but not immorality per se.

E: Why destroying nature is immoral. Wait, this is exactly what Hill is moving away from because the question says he doesn't want to ask why it's immoral. So E is the original question, not what he's asking instead.

F: Whether plants have interests. This seems like a different topic, more about plant rights.

G: Why people who destroy are bad. Similar to E but focusing on people's character, still about immorality.

H: If destruction is legally punishable. This is about legal aspects, not morality.

I: Whether nature has a right to exist. This is a different angle, more about rights than immorality.

J: Whether animals have rights. Again, another topic about rights, not the act's immorality.

So, the question is asking what Hill wants to ask instead of E. He's moving away from the immorality aspect. The options that don't directly address immorality but still relate to the environment are D, F, G, I, J. But let's think about what's the best fit.

Option D is about the impact on future generations. That's a consequence-based question, which is a different approach. Hill might be interested in the long-term effects rather than the moral aspect.

Option I is about nature's right to exist, which is a more philosophical question, maybe even a different angle on why preservation is necessary.

Option F and J are about whether plants or animals have rights, which are separate from the act of destruction's morality.

Between D and I, D seems more directly related to the consequences of destruction, which is a common angle when discussing environmental issues. It's about foreseeability and responsibility towards the future, which is a different way to approach the issue without focusing on the morality of the act itself.

So I think the answer is D: how destroying the environment affects future generations.

The answer is D: how destroying the environment affects future generations.

Answer: D
