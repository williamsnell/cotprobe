Question:

A plaintiff sued a defendant in federal court for injuries arising out of an accident involving the parties. The plaintiff alleged and presented evidence at trial demonstrating that her injuries had left her legs permanently paralyzed. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff and awarded her $5 million in damages. Two months after the court entered judgment, the defendant was given a videotape made that day showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor. What is the best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment?

Options:

A: Move to set aside the verdict based on the new evidence that contradicts the plaintiff's claims.
B: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff's injuries were not as severe as originally presented.
C: Move for a new trial or in the alternative for remittitur to reduce the award in light of the shortened duration of the plaintiff's injuries.
D: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff misled the court about her condition.
E: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that there is newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent.
F: Request a retrial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that could alter the verdict.
G: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed a fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.
H: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief that the plaintiff's injuries would be permanent.
I: File an appeal with the appellate court alleging that the judgment was based on false information.
J: Move for relief from the judgment arguing that the jury's decision was influenced by emotional rather than factual reasoning.

Okay, so I have this question about a legal procedure, and I need to figure out the best answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a plaintiff sued a defendant in federal court for injuries from an accident. The plaintiff claimed her injuries left her legs permanently paralyzed. The jury found in her favor and awarded $5 million. Two months later, the defendant gets a videotape showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor. Now, the defendant wants to seek relief from the judgment. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different motion or action.

First, I need to remember the rules about post-judgment motions. In federal court, after a judgment is entered, a party can make various motions to seek relief. Common ones include motions for a new trial, remittitur, or relief from judgment under certain conditions.

The key here is the new evidence. The videotape shows the plaintiff jogging, which contradicts her claim of permanent paralysis. So the defendant wants to use this new evidence to challenge the judgment.

I recall that Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party to move for a new trial if there's newly discovered evidence that could have been reasonably discovered earlier. Alternatively, Rule 60(b) allows for relief from judgment if there's a mistake of fact or law, or newly discovered evidence that makes the judgment unjust.

Looking at the options:

A: Move to set aside the verdict based on new evidence contradicting the plaintiff's claims. That sounds possible, but I'm not sure if that's the exact legal term. I think "set aside" might be part of a motion for new trial.

B: Move for relief on ground that injuries weren't as severe. This is similar to A but phrased differently. It might fall under Rule 60(b)(2) for newly discovered evidence.

C: Move for new trial or remittitur. Remittitur is when the court reduces the award if the damages are excessive. Since the plaintiff's injuries are shown to be less severe, a new trial might be warranted. Alternatively, the defendant could argue that the award should be reduced based on the shorter duration of injuries.

D: Move for relief on ground plaintiff misled the court. This sounds like fraud, which would be Rule 60(b)(3). But does the evidence show fraud, or just that the plaintiff's condition was misrepresented? Misleading the court could be a basis, but I'm not sure if this is the strongest option.

E: Move for relief on ground that injuries were not permanent. This seems similar to B and E. The evidence shows the injuries aren't permanent, so E might be a good option.

F: Request a retrial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. A retrial is the same as a new trial, so F is another way to phrase a motion for new trial.

G: Move for relief on ground of fraud in obtaining damages. This is similar to D but more specific. If the plaintiff lied about the injuries being permanent to get more damages, this could be a fraud claim under Rule 60(b)(3).

H: Move for relief on ground that the jury thought injuries were permanent. This might be about the jury's belief being mistaken, possibly under Rule 60(b)(1), but I'm not sure how strong that ground is.

I: File an appeal. Appeals typically don't consider new evidence; they review the record. So unless there was a legal error, an appeal wouldn't be the right move here because the new evidence came after judgment.

J: Move for relief arguing the jury was influenced by emotion. This might be challenging because it's about the jury's reasoning, which is hard to prove. The new evidence shows the plaintiff's condition, not the jury's emotions.

So, the key points: the defendant has new evidence that contradicts the plaintiff's claims. They can seek a new trial (Options A, C, F) or seek relief under Rule 60 (Options B, D, E, G, H, I, J). 

Option C suggests moving for a new trial or remittitur. A new trial would allow the defendant to present the new evidence, which could change the outcome. Remittitur would reduce the award, but the defendant might prefer a new trial to challenge the entire verdict.

Option E is about the injuries not being permanent. That directly addresses the basis of the damages. If the injuries are less severe, the damages might be lower, so this could support a motion for new trial or remittitur.

Option G is about fraud. If the plaintiff intentionally misled the court, that's a strong basis under Rule 60(b)(3). But proving fraud can be difficult, so maybe the defendant goes for a more straightforward argument based on new evidence showing less severe injuries.

So between C and E, C seems broader because it allows for either a new trial or a reduction of the award. E is more specific to the nature of the injuries. But the best way might be to move for a new trial because the new evidence is significant and could change the outcome.

Wait, but in federal court, Rule 59(e) allows a party to alter or amend the judgment if there's a mistake of law or fact, or newly discovered evidence. So the defendant could file a motion under Rule 59(e) for a new trial.

Looking back at the options, Option C says "Move for a new trial or in the alternative for remittitur." That seems comprehensive. The defendant can ask for a new trial if the evidence is strong enough, or if not, ask to reduce the award.

Alternatively, Option E is also a possibility because it directly addresses the permanency of the injuries, which was a key factor in the damages. The defendant can argue that the jury's belief about permanent injuries was incorrect, thus justifying a new trial or a reduced award.

But the best approach is likely a motion for a new trial because the new evidence is so significant. So the answer would be C or F. But Option C includes remittitur as an alternative, which makes it a better choice because it covers both possibilities.

Another angle: under Rule 60(b), the defendant could argue for relief from judgment because the new evidence is material and could have been discovered with due diligence. This would be a motion under Rule 60(b)(2). So the defendant could file such a motion, which would be similar to Options B, E, or G.

But in federal practice, a motion for a new trial under Rule 59 is the primary way to seek relief when there's new evidence that could have been discovered earlier. So moving for a new trial is the more direct approach.

So Option C seems correct because it combines the request for a new trial and, if that's not granted, asks for a reduction in the award.
</think>

The defendant can seek relief by filing a motion for a new trial under Rule 59, arguing that the newly discovered evidence showing the plaintiff's ability to jog contradicts her claims of permanent paralysis. Alternatively, they can request remittitur to reduce the damages awarded. This approach allows the court to reconsider the judgment based on the new evidence.

Answer: C
