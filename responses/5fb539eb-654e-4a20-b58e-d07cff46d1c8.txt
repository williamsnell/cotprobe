Okay, so I've got this question here about the color of an airplane's black box. Hmm, the options are A through J, with colors like green, brown, silver, and others. I think the term "black box" is a bit confusing because I remember hearing that it's not actually black. Wait, isn't it something else? Maybe orange? I think I've seen pictures or read somewhere that it's bright orange. Let me think. The black box is the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, right? It's supposed to be highly visible to help in recovery after a crash. So if it's bright orange, that makes sense because it stands out against most backgrounds, making it easier to find. 

Looking at the options again, H is orange. Yeah, that must be the correct answer. I don't think it's black because that would make it harder to find, especially if it's buried under debris. Orange is a standard color used for safety equipment and things that need to be easily spotted. So yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is H, orange.

The answer is H: orange.
