Okay, so I've got this problem where Ramanujan and Hardy picked complex numbers, and their product is given as 32 - 8i. Hardy picked 5 + 3i, and I need to find out what Ramanujan picked from the options A to J.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you multiply two complex numbers, you distribute the multiplication, like the FOIL method. So if I let Ramanujan's number be z, then Hardy's number is 5 + 3i, and their product is 32 -8i. So mathematically, that would be z * (5 + 3i) = 32 -8i.

To find z, I should divide both sides by (5 + 3i). So z = (32 -8i) / (5 + 3i). But dividing complex numbers can be tricky. Oh right, the way to do that is by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 5 + 3i is 5 - 3i.

So let's compute that step by step. First, write the division as:

z = (32 - 8i) / (5 + 3i) * (5 - 3i)/(5 - 3i)

The denominator becomes (5 + 3i)(5 - 3i), which is 5² - (3i)². Calculating that, 25 - 9i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 25 +9 =34.

Now the numerator: (32 -8i)(5 -3i). Let's expand this using FOIL.

First, multiply 32 *5 = 160.

Then 32*(-3i) = -96i.

Next, -8i*5 = -40i.

Finally, -8i*(-3i) = 24i². But i² is -1, so this becomes -24.

So adding all these parts together: 160 -96i -40i -24.

Combine like terms: 160 -24 = 136. And -96i -40i = -136i.

So the numerator is 136 -136i.

Putting it all together, z = (136 -136i)/34. Let's simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 34.

136 ÷34 = 4, and -136i ÷34 = -4i.

So z = 4 -4i.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 4 -4i. So that must be the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Denominator: (5+3i)(5-3i) =25 - (3i)^2=25 +9=34. Correct.

Numerator: (32-8i)(5-3i) = 32*5=160, 32*(-3i)=-96i, -8i*5=-40i, -8i*(-3i)=24i²=-24. So 160-24=136, and -96i-40i= -136i. So numerator is 136-136i. Divided by 34 gives 4-4i. Yep, that's correct. So Ramanujan picked 4-4i, which is option G.

The product of Ramanujan's and Hardy's numbers is 32 - 8i. Hardy's number is 5 + 3i, so Ramanujan's number, when multiplied by 5 + 3i, gives 32 - 8i. To find Ramanujan's number, divide (32 - 8i) by (5 + 3i). 

By multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, the division simplifies to (4 - 4i). This corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
