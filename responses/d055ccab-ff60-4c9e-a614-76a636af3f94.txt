Okay, so I've got this problem about Radium-226 and its half-life. The question is asking me to find the time it takes for a given amount of this material to be reduced by one-quarter. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The formula for the amount remaining after time t is N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N0 is the initial amount, T is the half-life, and t is the time elapsed.

Wait, the problem says the material is reduced by one-quarter. So that means three-quarters of it remains, right? Because if it's reduced by a quarter, the remaining is 75%, or 0.75 in decimal form.

So, plugging into the formula: 0.75 = (1/2)^(t / 1620). I need to solve for t here. Hmm, how do I solve for t in this equation?

I think I can take the natural logarithm of both sides. Let me try that. Taking ln on both sides: ln(0.75) = (t / 1620) * ln(1/2). Because ln(a^b) = b*ln(a).

So, solving for t: t = [ln(0.75) / ln(0.5)] * 1620.

Let me calculate the values. I know that ln(0.5) is approximately -0.6931, and ln(0.75) is about -0.2877. So plugging in: t = (-0.2877 / -0.6931) * 1620.

The negatives cancel out, so it's 0.2877 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.415. Then multiply by 1620: 0.415 * 1620 ≈ 672.3 years. Hmm, that's about 672.4 years. Wait, looking at the options, option B is 672.4 years. But wait, is that the correct approach?

Wait a second, another way to think about it: if the material is reduced by a quarter, that means 25% has decayed. So the remaining is 75%, which is correct. Alternatively, could it be that the question is asking when it's reduced by a quarter, meaning 25% remains? Oh, no, that would be a different scenario. Because if it's reduced by a quarter, it's gone down by that amount, so remaining is 75%, not 25%. So I think my initial approach is correct.

But let me double-check. The half-life is 1620 years. Each half-life reduces the amount by half. So after one half-life (1620 years), it's reduced by half, so 50% remains. But we're looking for when it's reduced by a quarter, meaning 75% remains. So it's not a full half-life yet.

Wait, perhaps using the formula in another way. The formula N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But the decay constant λ is ln(2)/T, so λ = 0.6931 / 1620 per year.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of half-lives. Let me denote n as the number of half-lives. Then, 0.75 = (1/2)^n. Solving for n: take log base 2 of 0.75.

So, n = log2(0.75). I know that log2(0.5) is 1, and log2(0.75) is a negative number, but wait no, because 0.75 is less than 1, so log2(0.75) is negative. Wait, but we're talking about the number of half-lives, which can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I should take the absolute value.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as 0.75 = (1/2)^n → taking reciprocal on both sides: 1/0.75 = 2^n → 4/3 = 2^n → take ln of both sides: ln(4/3) = n ln(2) → n = ln(4/3)/ln(2). Let me compute that.

ln(4/3) is approximately 0.2877, and ln(2) is 0.6931, so n ≈ 0.2877 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.415. So n is about 0.415 half-lives. Then t = n * T = 0.415 * 1620 ≈ 672.3 years, same as before.

So that would be option B, 672.4 years. But wait, looking at the options, option B is exactly 672.4, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the question is about the time it takes for the material to reduce by a quarter, does that mean the time it takes for 25% to decay, leaving 75%? Or does it mean the time it takes for the material to reach a quarter of its original amount, which would be 25% remaining? Because that would be a different scenario.

Wait, the wording says "reduced by one-quarter." So if I have, say, 100 grams, reduced by a quarter would be 25 grams gone, leaving 75 grams. So the remaining is 75%, which is 0.75. So my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, if it were "reduced to one-quarter," that would mean remaining is 25%, but the wording is "reduced by one-quarter," which implies the amount lost is a quarter, so remaining is three-quarters.

Therefore, the time is approximately 672.4 years, which is option B.

The problem involves determining the time it takes for Radium-226 to reduce by one-quarter, meaning 75% of the initial amount remains. Using the exponential decay formula, the time is calculated to be approximately 672.4 years, corresponding to option B.

Answer: B
