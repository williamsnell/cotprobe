Question:

If the volume of an object were to double, with no change in mass, its density would

Options:

A: triple.
B: None of these.
C: halve.
D: double.
E: be the same.

G: decrease by a factor of four.
H: remain the same only if the object is a liquid.
I: increase by a factor of four.
J: decrease, but not necessarily halve.

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about density, volume, and mass. Hmm, let's see. Density is mass divided by volume, right? The formula is density = mass/volume. So the question is, if the volume of an object doubles and the mass stays the same, what happens to the density?

Wait, so the mass isn't changing. So mass is constant. Volume is doubling. So if volume increases, and mass stays the same, then density would change because density is inversely proportional to volume when mass is constant. Because if you have the same mass spread out over a larger volume, it's less dense.

Let me think. Originally, density is mass over volume. If volume doubles, the new density would be mass over (2 times volume). So that's half of the original density. So the density would decrease by half. Wait, but the options don't all say that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A to J. The options are:

A: triple.
B: None of these.
C: halve.
D: double.
E: be the same.
F: increase, but not necessarily double.
G: decrease by a factor of four.
H: remain the same only if the object is a liquid.
I: increase by a factor of four.
J: decrease, but not necessarily halve.

Wait, I thought the density would be half. So that's a decrease by half, which is the same as saying it would be halved. So looking at the options, option C is 'halve' and option J says 'decrease, but not necessarily halve.' Hmm, wait. So if the volume doubles, density would be halved, so exactly halved. So option C says 'halve,' which would be correct. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another way to look at it: If original volume is V, then new volume is 2V. Mass is M. Original density is M/V. New density is M/(2V) = (M/V) * 1/2. So it's exactly half the original density. So the density would be halved. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but why is option J there? Option J says 'decrease, but not necessarily halve.' But in this case, it does halve. So in this scenario, since the volume doubles exactly, the density is exactly halved. So the correct answer should be C. But wait, the options are presented as A to J, and the user's question is asking to select the correct one.

So in this case, the answer is C: halve.

When the volume of an object doubles while its mass remains constant, the density is halved because density is inversely proportional to volume. 

Answer: C
