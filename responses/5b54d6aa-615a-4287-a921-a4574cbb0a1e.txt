Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Minoan culture, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: "Unlike most other early civilizations, Minoan culture shows little evidence of:"

And the options are A through D, each with different aspects. I remember that Minoan civilization was one of the early ones, around the Bronze Age, on Crete. They're known for their palaces like Knossos, their art, and their apparently peaceful society compared to others. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Trade. I think the Minoans were big on trade. They were海上民族, right? They had ships and traded goods like pottery, wine, and maybe even metals. So A is probably not the answer because they did engage in trade.

Option B: Warfare. From what I recall, the Minoans didn't have a lot of defensive structures or evidence of wars. Their palaces weren't fortified like other ancient cities, which often had walls for protection. They might have had a more peaceful society, so B could be the correct answer because they didn't show much evidence of warfare.

Option C: Development of a common religion. Wait, most early civilizations had some form of common religion, with temples and deities. The Minoans had their own set of gods and religious practices, as seen in their art and the layout of their palaces. So C is probably not the right answer because they did develop a common religion.

Option D: Conspicuous consumption by elites. This refers to the elites showing off their wealth, like in architecture or art. The Minoan palaces, like Knossos, were quite elaborate with frescoes, intricate layouts, and maybe even signs of luxury. So they did have some level of conspicuous consumption, making D unlikely as the answer.

So putting it all together, the Minoans were known for their lack of evidence of warfare compared to other civilizations of the time. They didn't have the same kind of military structures or conflicts recorded as, say, the Mycenaeans or other nearby cultures. Therefore, the answer should be B: warfare.
