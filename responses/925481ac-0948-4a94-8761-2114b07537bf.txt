Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the mean, median, and mode from a set of numbers. The numbers given are 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, and 9. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let's understand what each term means. The mean is the average of all the numbers. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order, and the mode is the number that appears most frequently.

Starting with the mean: To find the mean, I need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Let's add them up: 3 + 5 is 8, plus 6 is 14, another 6 makes 20, plus 7 is 27, and then 9 brings it to 36. So the total sum is 36. There are 6 numbers in total. Dividing 36 by 6 gives me 6. So the mean is 6.

Next, the median. The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Since the numbers are already in order (3,5,6,6,7,9), I can easily find the median. But wait, there are 6 numbers, which is even, so the median will be the average of the third and fourth numbers. The third number is 6, and the fourth is also 6. So (6 + 6)/2 equals 6. So the median is 6.

Now, the mode. The mode is the number that appears the most often. Looking at the set: 3 appears once, 5 appears once, 6 appears twice, 7 once, and 9 once. So the mode is 6 because it's the only number that repeats.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Are there any other numbers that appear more than once? No, 6 is the only one that appears twice. So yes, the mode is 6.

Let me go through the options provided to see which one matches these values. The options are A through J. Looking for mean 6, median 6, and mode 6.

Option D says Mean:6, Median:6, Mode:6. That seems to fit perfectly. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option E: Mean 6, Median 6, Mode 6? Wait, no, E says Mode:6, but looking at E's details, it says Mean:6, Median:6, Mode:6. Wait, no, no, the option E is listed as Mean:6, Median:5.5, Mode:6. So that's not correct because the median should be 6.

Option D is correct. So the answer should be D.

The mean is calculated by adding all the numbers and dividing by the count, resulting in 6. The median, being the average of the third and fourth numbers in the ordered set, is also 6. The mode is 6 since it appears most frequently. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Answer: D
