Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this ethics question. The question is asking for two theories that are examples of a certain type, based on universal principles of right and wrong. The options are given as A through J, each with different pairs of theories and a category.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says that the two blank theories are both examples of a "_____-based theories" which are based on universal principles. So, I'm looking for two theories that fit into a particular category, and both are based on universal principles of right and wrong.

I remember that there are a few main ethical theories. The main ones I can think of are:

1. Utilitarianism: This is a consequentialist theory that focuses on the outcomes of actions, particularly maximizing happiness or utility.
2. Deontological Ethics: This is principle-based and focuses on duties and rules, such as Kant's ethics.
3. Egoism: This theory suggests that actions are right if they benefit the self.
4. Ethics of Rights and Justice: This might relate to theories like libertarianism or Rawls' theory of justice.
5. Virtue Ethics: Focuses on developing good character traits.
6. Relativism: Suggests that moral principles are relative to culture or situation.

The question mentions that both theories are based on universal principles. So, relativism is probably not the answer because it's against universal principles. So, the category is not relativist.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Egoism, Utilitarianism, Deontological.

Wait, but I think Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialist, not principle-based. Deontological is principle-based, though. Egoism is more about self-interest, which is a different category.

Wait, the question says both are examples of a certain type based on universal principles. So, perhaps the category is principle-based. Let me think.

Deontological is a principle-based theory. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory. So, if the two theories are both principle-based, then perhaps they would be Deontological and something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, maybe the first two blanks are theories, and the third is the category. So the sentence would be: Theory1 and Theory2 are both examples of Category-based theories.

Looking at option C: Egoism, Utilitarianism, Deontological. So, the category is Deontological, and the two theories are Egoism and Utilitarianism. But Utilitarianism is not deontological; it's consequentialist. So that can't be right.

Option B: Ethics of rights and justice, Egoism, Deontological. So, the category is Deontological. Are both Ethics of rights and justice and Egoism deontological? I'm not sure. Deontological focuses on duties and rules. The ethics of rights and justice might be part of deontological, but egoism is more about self-interest, not necessarily based on universal principles. So maybe not.

Option I: Ethics of duty, Utilitarianism, Consequentialist. No, because Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialist, but Ethics of duty is deontological. So that doesn't fit.

Option E: Utilitarianism, Egoism, Principle. So the category is Principle-based. Utilitarianism is not principle-based; it's outcome-based. So that's incorrect.

Option C again: Egoism and Utilitarianism as examples of Deontological. But Utilitarianism is not deontological. So that's wrong.

Option D: Utilitarianism, Ethics of duty, Relativist. No, because Utilitarianism is not relativist, and Ethics of duty is deontological. So the category would be relativist, which doesn't fit.

Option F: Ethics of rights and justice, Utilitarianism, Virtue. The category is Virtue-based. But Utilitarianism is not virtue-based; it's consequentialist. So no.

Option G: Ethics of duty, Ethics of rights and justice, Principle. So the category is Principle-based. Both Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are principle-based. So this could be it. But I need to check if the category is Principle, and the two theories are both principle-based.

Wait, the question says the theories are based on universal principles. So, if the category is principle-based, then both theories fit. So, option G says the category is Principle, and the two theories are Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice. That makes sense because both are principle-based.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is: Ethics of duty, Ethics of rights and justice, Principle. So the sentence would be: Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are both examples of Principle-based theories.

That seems correct because both are based on principles. So the answer would be G.

But wait, another option I should check. Option C says Egoism, Utilitarianism, Deontological. Hmm, but Utilitarianism is not Deontological. So that's wrong.

Option C is incorrect because Utilitarianism is a different category. So the correct option is likely G, where both theories are principle-based, and the category is Principle.

Wait, but the options for the category in G is Principle, so the third blank is Principle. So the sentence would be: Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are both examples of Principle-based theories.

Yes, that makes sense. Both are based on principles, not outcomes or relativism.

So the answer is option G.

The correct answer is G: Ethics of duty, Ethics of rights and justice, Principle. Both Ethics of duty (deontological ethics) and Ethics of rights and justice are principle-based theories, focusing on universal principles of right and wrong.

Answer: G
