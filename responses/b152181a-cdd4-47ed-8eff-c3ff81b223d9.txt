Okay, so I have this question about the F-ratio in statistics. I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that the F-ratio is used in ANOVA to compare the variance between groups to the variance within groups. The formula, if I recall correctly, is F = (Between-group variance) / (Within-group variance). So the F-ratio is the ratio of the mean square between (MSB) to the mean square within (MSW).

The question is about what reduces the magnitude of the denominator term, which is the within-group variability. So I'm focusing on the denominator here. The denominator is MSW, which is the within-group variance. If the denominator gets smaller, the F-ratio becomes larger because you're dividing a bigger number (numerator) by a smaller number (denominator).

Wait, but the question is asking what reduces the denominator's magnitude. So I need to find factors that decrease within-group variability. Let's think about what affects within-group variability.

Within-group variability is the sum of squared differences within each group. If within-group variability decreases, that means the data points within each group are getting closer to their group mean. That makes sense because if all the data points in each group are close to the mean, the variability within each group is low.

So, how can within-group variability be reduced? Well, if the sample sizes within each group increase, the estimate of the within-group variability becomes more precise, but does it reduce the variability? Not necessarily. It's more about how the data is spread around the mean.

Alternatively, if the groups themselves are more homogeneous, meaning the subjects or data points within each group are very similar, then within-group variability would decrease. So factors that make each group more similar within themselves would lower within-group variability.

Now, looking at the options, the question is about what reduces the denominator (within-group variability). So I need to find the option that talks about decreasing within-group variability.

Looking at the options:

A: decreasing both within and between-group variability. Hmm, but the question is about the denominator, which is within-group. If both decrease, then denominator decreases, which would increase F. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit because the question is about just the denominator.

B: increasing both. That would make the denominator bigger, which is the opposite of what we want.

C: increasing between-group variability only. That doesn't affect the denominator, so it's irrelevant here.

D: increasing within-group variability. That would increase the denominator, making F smaller, which is not what we want.

E: decreasing between-group variability only. Again, that doesn't affect the denominator.

F: increasing between-group and decreasing within. Wait, that would decrease the denominator, which we want. But the F-ratio is MSB/MSW. If MSB increases and MSW decreases, F would increase a lot. But the question is about the denominator being reduced. So F is about both, but the question is about the denominator only. Hmm, but the question is about what reduces the denominator (within-group variability). So if within-group variability decreases, the denominator decreases. So any option that talks about decreasing within-group variability would be correct.

Looking at the options, option J: decreasing within-group variability. That directly answers the question. So if within-group variability decreases, the denominator gets smaller, which increases the F-ratio.

Wait, but let me check all the options again. Option J is about decreasing within-group variability. So that's exactly what we're looking for.

Wait, but the question is about what reduces the denominator. So option J says "decreasing within-group variability," which is exactly what reduces the denominator. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question is about the denominator term in the F-ratio being reduced. So if within-group variability (denominator) decreases, that's correct.

So, the answer is J.
</think>

The denominator term in the F-ratio, which is the within-group variability, is reduced in magnitude when within-group variability decreases. This makes the denominator smaller, which increases the F-ratio. Among the options provided, only option J directly addresses the reduction in within-group variability.

Answer: J
