Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again: We have three variables a, b, and c such that a + b + c = 1, ab + ac + bc = -4, and abc = -4. The question is asking for the value of a³ + b³ + c³. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the sum of cubes in terms of the sums and products of variables. Let me try to recall it.

I think the formula is something like a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember another formula: a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc). Maybe that's the one I should use. Let me write that down.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc). Hmm, but I don't know a² + b² + c² yet. Maybe I can find that from the given information.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, plugging in the known values: (1)² = a² + b² + c² + 2*(-4). That simplifies to 1 = a² + b² + c² - 8. So, solving for a² + b² + c², I get 1 + 8 = 9. So, a² + b² + c² = 9.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 1 squared is 1, ab + ac + bc is -4, so 2*(-4) is -8. So 1 = a² + b² + c² -8, which gives a² + b² + c² = 9. Yep, that's correct.

Now, going back to the formula for a³ + b³ + c³. Using the identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc) + 3abc. Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check another source. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Let me verify that.

Let me expand (a + b + c)^3. It's a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, expanding (a + b + c)^3 gives a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula I mentioned earlier.

Wait, I think I was right the first time. The correct formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Let me confirm that by plugging in some numbers, but maybe it's easier to just proceed.

So, given that, let's compute each part step by step.

First, (a + b + c)^3 = 1^3 = 1.

Next, 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) = 3*1*(-4) = -12.

Then, 3abc = 3*(-4) = -12.

Putting it all together: a³ + b³ + c³ = 1 - (-12) + (-12). Wait, that doesn't seem right because 1 - (-12) is 13, and then adding (-12) would give 1, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the signs.

Wait, the formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So, substituting the values, it's 1 - 3*(1)*(-4) + 3*(-4).

Let me compute each term:

(a + b + c)^3 = 1.

-3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) = -3*(1)*(-4) = +12.

+3abc = 3*(-4) = -12.

So, adding them up: 1 + 12 -12 = 1.

Wait, that gives 1, which is option I. But wait, let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should use the other formula I was thinking of earlier, the one involving a² + b² + c².

So, using a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc).

We have a² + b² + c² = 9, and ab + ac + bc = -4. So, a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc = 9 - (-4) = 13.

Then, (a + b + c) is 1, so 1*13 =13.

Adding 3abc, which is 3*(-4) = -12.

So, 13 + (-12) = 1. So again, it comes out to 1.

But wait, the options include 1 as option I. But wait, I also remember that when a + b + c = s, ab + bc + ac = p, and abc = q, then a³ + b³ + c³ = s³ - 3s p + 3q.

Wait, so s=1, p=-4, q=-4. So, s³ is 1, 3s p is 3*1*(-4)= -12, and 3q is 3*(-4)=-12.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 1 - (-12) + (-12) = 1 +12 -12 =1.

Hmm, that's consistent. So the answer should be 1, which is option I.

Wait a second, but looking back, when I first did the calculation, I got 1, but in the options, I see option I is 1. But the problem is, in the options, option I is 1, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach to verify.

Another way to find a³ + b³ + c³ is to note that each variable satisfies the equation x³ - (a + b + c)x² + (ab + ac + bc)x - abc = 0. So, for each variable, x³ = (a + b + c)x² - (ab + ac + bc)x + abc.

So, a³ = 1*a² - (-4)*a + (-4).

Similarly, b³ = 1*b² - (-4)*b + (-4).

And c³ = 1*c² - (-4)*c + (-4).

Adding them up: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a² + b² + c²) +4(a + b + c) -12.

We know a² + b² + c² =9, and a + b + c =1.

So, substituting: 9 +4*(1) -12 =9 +4 -12=1.

Again, same result. So, a³ + b³ + c³ =1.

Wait, but the options have 1 as option I, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can have other answers, but maybe I'm correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the sum of cubes. Let me check another formula.

Wait, I think another formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, plugging in the values:

(1)^3 = 1,

-3*(1)*(-4) = +12,

+3*(-4) = -12.

Adding them: 1 +12 -12 =1.

Yes, same result. So, the answer should be 1, which is option I.

The value of \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\) is calculated using the identity \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc\). Substituting the given values: \(a + b + c = 1\), \(ab + ac + bc = -4\), and \(abc = -4\), we find:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1^3 - 3(1)(-4) + 3(-4) = 1 + 12 - 12 = 1.
\]

Thus, the answer is **I**.
