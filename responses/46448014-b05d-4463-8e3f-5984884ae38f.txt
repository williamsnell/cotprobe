Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Gresham's Law is. I've heard the name before, probably in an economics class or something. Let me think. I remember that Gresham's Law has something to do with money, specifically about good and bad money.

Wait, wasn't there something about bad money driving out good? Or was it the other way around? I think it's one of those laws where when you have two types of money in circulation, people prefer to use the one that's better, so the worse one gets pushed out. Or maybe the opposite.

Let me try to recall. I think the law was named after someone, maybe an Englishman, and it's related to the concept of monetary exchange. So, if you have both good and bad coins in circulation, people will use the bad ones to pay debts because they're worth less, and save the good ones. That way, the bad money drives out the good because people don't want to spend the good money; they'd rather use the bad ones and keep the good for themselves.

Wait, so in that case, the bad money is the one that's overvalued or undervalued? I think it's when the government sets a fixed exchange rate between different types of money. For example, if you have both gold and silver coins, but the government says they're equal, but in reality, one is more valuable. So, people will use the less valuable coins for transactions and hoard the more valuable ones. That means the bad (less valuable) money pushes out the good (more valuable) money.

Looking at the options, option A says "Bad money drives out good." That seems to fit what I was thinking. Option D is the opposite, "Good money drives out bad," which doesn't sound right. I think it's the bad that drives out the good because people prefer to spend the worse money and save the better.

Wait, let me make sure. Gresham's Law is about the circulation of money, right? If you have both a currency that's overvalued and undervalued, the overvalued one (bad) will be used for transactions, and the undervalued (good) will be held. So, bad money circulates, good money is hoarded. So, bad money drives out good. So option A is correct.

I don't think it's about the quantity determining value, so option B or E are probably not right. Option I says money has no intrinsic value, which might be true for some forms, but that's not Gresham's Law. Option H is about intrinsic vs nominal value, which is more about the concept of money itself, not the circulation dynamics.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident that the answer is A: Bad money drives out good.

Gresham's Law states that "bad money drives out good." This occurs when both good and bad money are in circulation, with the bad money (often overvalued or less valuable) being used for transactions while the good money (undervalued or more valuable) is hoarded. This happens because people prefer to spend the inferior money and save the superior money, leading to the bad money circulating and the good money being pushed out of circulation.
