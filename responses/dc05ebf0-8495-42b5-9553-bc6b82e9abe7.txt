Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is all about.

The question is asking which of the listed activities are NOT secondary economic activities. The options are from A to H. I remember that economic activities are divided into different categories, and secondary activities are a specific one. Let me try to recall what each category entails.

First, I think primary economic activities involve extracting or harvesting raw materials. Like mining, farming, logging, etc. So any activity that gets resources directly from the earth would be primary.

Secondary economic activities are about processing those raw materials into finished goods. So manufacturing, assembling, constructing—those are secondary because they take the primary materials and turn them into something else.

Tertiary activities are services, like retail, healthcare, education, etc. They don't produce goods but provide services to people.

So the question is about which activities are NOT secondary. That means I need to find the options that are either primary or tertiary.

Looking at the options:

A: Sewing shirts. Hmm, sewing shirts would involve taking fabric (which is a primary product) and making shirts. That sounds like manufacturing, so secondary.

B: Assembling automotive parts. That's definitely manufacturing cars or parts, so secondary.

C: Building houses. Construction is a secondary activity because it's creating structures from raw materials like lumber, bricks, etc.

D: Mining copper. That's primary because it's extracting a raw material from the earth.

E: Brewing beer. Brewing involves processing raw materials (like grains) into a finished product, so secondary.

F: Manufacturing furniture. That's making products from raw materials, so secondary.

G: Processing food. Taking raw food items and turning them into processed foods, which is manufacturing, so secondary.

H: Binding books. That's part of manufacturing or maybe even出版业, which is tertiary if it's services. Wait, binding books is more like manufacturing because it's taking paper and materials and making a product. So secondary.

Wait, but I thought maybe tertiary is when it's a service. So does binding books count as manufacturing or as a service? I'm a bit confused. Binding books is part of the publishing process, which could be considered both. But I think in economic terms, manufacturing is about producing goods, so binding would be secondary.

So the only one that's not secondary is D: Mining copper, because it's primary. All the others are secondary or maybe tertiary, but the question is about NOT secondary, so only D is not secondary.

The activity that is NOT a secondary economic activity is mining copper, as it falls under primary economic activities. All other options involve processing raw materials into finished goods, making them secondary.

Answer: D
