Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the equilibrium constant K for a reaction. Let me see if I can work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The reaction given is CO₂(g) + H₂(g) ⇌ CO(g) + H₂O(g). So, carbon dioxide reacting with hydrogen gas to produce carbon monoxide and water vapor. 

The problem states that one mole of CO₂ is reacted with one mole of H₂ at 825 K. At equilibrium, the pressure of CO is 0.27 atm. We need to find the equilibrium constant K at this temperature.

Hmm, I think I should start by setting up an ICE table. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. It helps track the changes in concentrations (or partial pressures, since it's gas) as the reaction proceeds to equilibrium.

Wait, but the problem gives the partial pressure of CO at equilibrium, which is 0.27 atm. So I can use that to find the other partial pressures.

Let me outline the ICE table:

Reaction: CO₂ + H₂ ⇌ CO + H₂O

At the start (initial), we have 1 mole of CO₂ and 1 mole of H₂. But wait, since it's in a gaseous state, I think the initial partial pressures would depend on the volume, but since all stoichiometric coefficients are 1, maybe I can assume they are 1 atm each? Or perhaps the initial pressures are both 1 atm? Wait, no, because the problem doesn't specify the initial pressures, just the moles. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the problem says one mole of CO₂ is reacted with one mole of H₂. So initially, the partial pressures would be: CO₂ = 1 atm, H₂ = 1 atm, and CO and H₂O are zero. Because when you start, only the reactants are present.

But wait, no, that's only if the volume is 1 L, but pressure might not be 1 atm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are 1 M each, but I'm dealing with partial pressures here. Maybe I should assume that the initial partial pressures are 1 atm each for CO₂ and H₂, and zero for the products. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct, but I'll proceed with that assumption for now.

So, initial partial pressures:
CO₂: 1 atm
H₂: 1 atm
CO: 0
H₂O: 0

Change: Let's let the change be -x for CO₂ and H₂, and +x for CO and H₂O because the stoichiometry is 1:1:1:1.

Wait, but the problem states that at equilibrium, the partial pressure of CO is 0.27 atm. So that means x is 0.27 atm. Because CO starts at 0 and increases by x to reach 0.27 atm. So x = 0.27.

So, the changes would be:
CO₂: -0.27 atm
H₂: -0.27 atm
CO: +0.27 atm
H₂O: +0.27 atm

Now, the equilibrium partial pressures would be:
CO₂: 1 - 0.27 = 0.73 atm
H₂: 1 - 0.27 = 0.73 atm
CO: 0.27 atm
H₂O: 0.27 atm

Wait, but that can't be right because if both CO₂ and H₂ are 0.73, then the products are each 0.27. So the K expression would be [CO][H₂O] / ([CO₂][H₂]).

So, plugging in the values:

K = (0.27)(0.27) / (0.73)(0.73)

Let me calculate that. Numerator: 0.27 * 0.27 = 0.0729. Denominator: 0.73 * 0.73 ≈ 0.5329.

So K ≈ 0.0729 / 0.5329 ≈ 0.1368. Hmm, that's approximately 0.137.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.137, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I correctly assign the initial pressures? Because in reality, the initial pressures would depend on the volume and moles, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think assuming 1 atm each for CO₂ and H₂ is reasonable. Alternatively, perhaps the initial pressures are 1 bar or another unit, but the problem uses atm, so I think my approach is correct.

Another thing: when setting up the ICE table, I assumed that the change is x for each, but since each mole of reaction consumes 1 mole of CO₂ and H₂ and produces 1 mole each of CO and H₂O, the changes would be correct.

So, the K value is approximately 0.137, which is option B.

To determine the equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( \text{CO}_2(g) + \text{H}_2(g) \rightleftarrows \text{CO}(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(g) \) at 825 K, we use the given equilibrium partial pressure of \( \text{CO} \) as 0.27 atm.

### Step 1: Set up the ICE Table
The initial partial pressures are assumed to be 1 atm for \( \text{CO}_2 \) and \( \text{H}_2 \), and 0 atm for \( \text{CO} \) and \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \), based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.

| Species      | Initial (atm) | Change (atm) | Equilibrium (atm) |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------|
| \( \text{CO}_2 \) | 1             | -0.27         | 0.73               |
| \( \text{H}_2 \)   | 1             | -0.27         | 0.73               |
| \( \text{CO} \)    | 0             | +0.27         | 0.27               |
| \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) | 0            | +0.27         | 0.27               |

### Step 2: Write the Expression for \( K \)
The equilibrium constant expression is:
\[
K = \frac{[\text{CO}][\text{H}_2\text{O}]}{[\text{CO}_2][\text{H}_2]}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the Equilibrium Partial Pressures
Substitute the equilibrium partial pressures into the \( K \) expression:
\[
K = \frac{(0.27)(0.27)}{(0.73)(0.73)}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( K \)
\[
K = \frac{0.0729}{0.5329} \approx 0.137
\]

### Final Answer
The equilibrium constant \( K \) at 825 K is approximately **0.137**, which corresponds to **Option B**.
