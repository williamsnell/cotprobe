Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out which point isn't a solution to both inequalities y > 9x – 8 and y < –x + 8. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that an inequality like y > 9x – 8 represents all the points on one side of the line y = 9x – 8. Similarly, y < –x + 8 represents the area below the line y = -x + 8. So the solution to both inequalities would be the region where both conditions are satisfied, meaning the overlapping area where y is greater than 9x – 8 and less than –x + 8.

Looking at the options A through F, I need to check each point to see if it satisfies both inequalities. If a point doesn't satisfy one of them, it's the answer because it's not a solution to both.

Let me list the points again for clarity:

A: (-2, 15)
B: (-1, 5)
C: (-2, -8)
D: (0, 0)
E: (1, 5)
F: (-1, -1)

I'll go through each one by one.

Starting with option A: (-2, 15). Let's plug x = -2 into both inequalities.

For y > 9x – 8: 9*(-2) = -18, so -18 –8 = -26. So y should be greater than -26. Since y is 15 here, 15 > -26 is true.

Now check y < –x +8: Plug x = -2. So –(-2) is 2, plus 8 is 10. y needs to be less than 10. Here y is 15, which is not less than 10. So this point doesn't satisfy the second inequality. Wait, but the question is asking for a point that is NOT a solution to both. So if it doesn't satisfy one, it's not a solution to both. So A might be the answer, but let me check the others to be sure.

Option B: (-1, 5). Let's compute.

First inequality: y > 9x –8. x=-1: 9*(-1)=-9 –8 = -17. y=5 > -17? Yes.

Second inequality: y < –x +8. x=-1: –(-1)=1 +8=9. y=5 <9? Yes. So B satisfies both.

Option C: (-2, -8).

First inequality: y > 9*(-2) –8 = -18–8=-26. y=-8 > -26? Yes, because -8 is to the right of -26 on the number line.

Second inequality: y < –(-2) +8 = 2 +8=10. y=-8 <10? Yes. So C satisfies both.

Option D: (0, 0).

First inequality: y > 9*0 –8 = -8. y=0 >-8? Yes.

Second inequality: y < –0 +8=8. y=0 <8? Yes. So D is good.

Option E: (1,5).

First inequality: y > 9*1 –8 =9–8=1. y=5 >1? Yes.

Second inequality: y < –1 +8=7. y=5 <7? Yes. So E works.

Option F: (-1, -1).

First inequality: y >9*(-1) –8= -9–8=-17. y=-1 >-17? Yes.

Second inequality: y < –(-1) +8=1+8=9. y=-1 <9? Yes. So F satisfies both.

Wait a minute, so the only point that doesn't satisfy both is A, because it fails the second inequality. So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me double-check option A. For y < -x +8, when x=-2, it's 2 +8=10. y=15 is definitely greater than 10, so it doesn't satisfy y <10. So yes, A is not a solution to both inequalities.

The point (–2, 15) does not satisfy the second inequality y < –x + 8 because 15 is not less than 10. Therefore, it is NOT a solution to both inequalities.

Answer: A
