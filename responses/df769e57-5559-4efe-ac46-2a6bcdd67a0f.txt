Okay, so I've got this nuclear equations problem to solve. It's a multiple-choice question with four parts (a to d), and I need to figure out what the missing particles are in each equation. The options are A through J, each listing four particles in a specific order. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with part (a): _7N^14 + _2He^4 → _8O^17 + .... The question is, what's the missing product here? I remember that in nuclear reactions, the sum of the atomic numbers (the subscript numbers) on both sides must be equal, and the same goes for the mass numbers (the superscript numbers).

So, for part (a), nitrogen has 7 protons, helium-4 has 2. Adding them together gives 7 + 2 = 9. On the product side, oxygen has 8. So the missing particle must contribute 1 to the atomic number, because 8 + (missing) = 9. So the missing particle has a charge of +1, which is a proton. Now for the mass numbers: 14 (from N) + 4 (He) = 18. Oxygen-17 has a mass number of 17, so the missing particle must account for 1 (since 17 + 1 = 18). A proton has a mass of 1, so that fits. So the missing particle is a proton. Wait, but looking again, the options are in order a to d, each needing a particle—so part (a) is a proton?

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. The product is O^17, so the other product would be the missing one. Let me recalculate:

Left side: 7 (N) + 2 (He) = 9. Right side: 8 (O) + x, so x's atomic number is 1. So x is a proton because a proton has charge +1. Mass: 14 +4 =18. O is 17, so 18-17=1. So yes, the missing is a proton. So part (a) is proton.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, could it be a positron? No, because the atomic numbers have to add up. Let me make sure. Nitrogen-14 has 7 protons, He-4 has 2, so total 9. Oxygen has 8, so the missing must be +1. That's a proton. So part (a) is proton.

Moving to part (b): _4Be^9 + _2He^4 → _6C^12 + .... Again, summing atomic numbers: 4 + 2 =6. Carbon has 6, so the missing must be zero. Wait, but what has zero charge? Like a neutron, because a neutron has 0 charge. Let's check mass numbers: Be is 9, He is 4 → total 13. On the right, C is 12, so 13-12=1. So the missing must have a mass number of 1. But a neutron has a mass of 1 (since 1 neutron is considered mass 1). So the missing particle is a neutron. So part (b) is neutron.

Wait, but wait. Could it be a positron or electron? No, because the atomic numbers already balance. If the missing had a charge, let's see. The sum is 6 on the right, so the product must be 6 from Be and He. So the missing particle must have charge 0. So it's a neutron. So part (b) is neutron.

Now part (c): _15P^90 → _14Si^30 + .... Let's look at the atomic numbers. P has 15, Si has 14. So 15 = 14 + x. So x must be +1. So the missing particle has charge +1, which is a proton. Now mass numbers: 90 =30 + x. So x is 60. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because the reaction is P^90 → Si^30 + something. So P^90 has 90 mass units. Si^30 has 30, so the missing must have 60. But what particle has a mass of 60? That doesn't make sense because typical particles like protons, neutrons, electrons have much lower masses. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decay. So P^90 decays into Si^30 plus something. Let's calculate the difference in atomic numbers: 15 →14, so it's a decrease by 1. That suggests a positron emission (since a positron has +1 charge). Wait, no: when a nucleus emits a positron, the atomic number decreases by 1. So in this case, P (15) becomes Si (14), so the nucleus emits a positron. So the missing particle is a positron. But wait, let's check the mass numbers. The P has mass 90, and Si is 30. So 90 =30 + x. So x is 60. But that's way too high. No, that can't be right. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the mass numbers don't have to balance because it's a decay, and energy is released. Or perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. The P^90 decays into Si^30 and something else. The mass number on the left is 90, and on the right, it's 30 plus the mass of the emitted particle. So 90 = 30 + x → x=60. But that's impossible because no known particle has a mass of 60. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the mass numbers don't have to balance in this case, but that's not how it works. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a beta-plus decay. When a nucleus undergoes positron emission, it converts a proton into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So the atomic number decreases by 1, and the mass number remains the same. So P has 15 protons, emits a positron, becomes Si (14), and the mass number remains 90. So the equation should be P^90 → Si^90 + positron + something else, perhaps a neutrino. But in the given equation, Si is 30, which doesn't match. So maybe the equation is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the equation is written as P^90 → Si^30 + something. But that would mean a mass number decrease of 60, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the mass numbers are not required to balance, but that's not correct. So perhaps the correct approach is that the missing particle is a positron, but the mass numbers don't add up, implying that the question has an error. Alternatively, maybe the mass number of Si is 30, so the emitted particle has mass 60, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of decay. Let's try another approach. The difference in atomic numbers is 15 →14, so the emitted particle has a charge of +1. That points to a positron. So part (c) is positron.

Wait, but the mass numbers don't add up. So perhaps the problem is that the mass number on the right is 30, which is lower than 90. That suggests maybe it's a neutron being emitted, but that would require the mass number to increase, which isn't the case. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me move on and come back.

Part (d): _1H^3 → _2He^3 + .... Let's calculate. Hydrogen has 1 proton, He has 2. So 1 →2, which suggests an increase in atomic number by 1. That usually happens when a neutron captures a proton and emits a positron, but more commonly, in a fusion reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton being emitted. Let me check the numbers.

Hydrogen-3 → He-3 + something. He-3 has a mass number of 3, same as H-3. So the total mass before is 3, after is 3 + x. So x must be 0. Wait, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton. Let me see.

Wait, H-3 has 1 proton and 2 neutrons. He-3 has 2 protons and 1 neutron. So H-3 → He-3 + something. The difference is that He-3 has one more proton. So H-3 must have emitted a positron and a neutron? Or perhaps it's a reaction where a proton is captured. Alternatively, maybe the missing particle is a neutron. Wait, let's think in terms of charge and mass.

Hydrogen-3: Z=1, mass=3. He-3: Z=2, mass=3. So the missing particle must have Z= (1) → (2) + x → x must be +1. So a proton. Because 1 = 2 + (-1). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the reaction is H-3 → He-3 + something. So the He has Z=2, so H's Z is 1. So the missing must have Z= -1, which is a beta-minus particle (electron). But wait, beta minus is when a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron. But in this case, H-3 becoming He-3 would require adding a proton. So perhaps it's a proton being captured, but that's not a decay. Alternatively, maybe the missing particle is a neutron, but that doesn't fit the charge.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a proton being emitted. Let me see: H-3 → He-3 + x. So He has Z=2, so H's Z=1, so x must have Z= -1, which is an electron. So the missing particle is an electron. But then the mass numbers: H-3 (mass 3) → He-3 (mass 3) + x (mass ?). So 3 = 3 + x → x=0. But an electron has mass approximately 0, so that could fit. So the missing particle is an electron, which is a beta-minus decay. But wait, in beta-minus decay, a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. So if H-3 is a neutron-rich isotope, perhaps it undergoes beta decay. But H-3 is actually a proton-rich isotope, as it's H-3 (tritium), which has 1 proton and 2 neutrons. Wait, but He-3 has 2 protons and 1 neutron. So H-3 → He-3 would require gaining a proton, which isn't typical decay. So perhaps the reaction is H-3 → He-3 + something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a capture of a neutron. But I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The sum of the charges: H-3 has Z=1, He-3 has Z=2. So the missing particle must have Z= -1 (because 1 = 2 + (-1)), which is an electron. So the missing particle is an electron. So part (d) is electron.

Wait, but let me check the mass numbers again. H-3 has mass 3, He-3 has mass 3. So 3 =3 + x → x=0. So the missing particle must have mass 0, which is an electron. So yes, part (d) is electron.

Now, let's go back to part (c). The problem is that the mass numbers don't add up. P^90 → Si^30 + x. So 90 =30 +x →x=60. That's impossible. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the Si is not ^30 but another isotope. But assuming the question is correct, perhaps the missing particle is a neutron. Let me check. If the missing is a neutron, its mass is 1. So 90 =30 +1 →31, which isn't 90. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe the missing particle is a positron and a neutron? But that wouldn't make sense in a single emission. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is P^90 → Si^30 + something else. Let me think about the atomic numbers. P has 15, Si has 14. So the missing must have +1 charge, which is a proton or positron. But earlier, I thought it was a positron because the atomic number decreases by 1. But if the atomic number increases, it would be a proton. Wait, no: in beta-plus decay, the nucleus emits a positron, so Z decreases by 1. So P^15 → Si^14 + positron. So the missing particle is a positron. So part (c) is positron.

But then the mass numbers: 90 =30 +x. So x=60. That's impossible. So perhaps the equation is written incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the mass number of Si is 30, so the missing particle has mass 60, which isn't possible. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the knowledge that the missing particle is a positron, regardless of the mass numbers, as the question might have a typo.

So, compiling the findings:

(a) Proton

(b) Neutron

(c) Positron

(d) Electron

Now, looking at the options, each option lists four particles in order a to d. Let's match.

Options:

A: Neutron, Positron, Proton, Electron

B: Neutron, Proton, Electron, Positron

C: Electron, Positron, Neutron, Proton

D: Neutron, Electron, Positron, Proton

E: Positron, Neutron, Electron, Proton

F: Electron, Neutron, Proton, Positron

G: Positron, Proton, Neutron, Electron

H: Proton, Neutron, Positron, Electron

I: Proton, Positron, Neutron, Electron

J: Positron, Electron, Proton, Neutron

Our answers are:

(a) Proton

(b) Neutron

(c) Positron

(d) Electron

So the order is Proton, Neutron, Positron, Electron.

Looking for an option where the four are in this order. Let's see:

Option I: Proton, Positron, Neutron, Electron → No, because (b) is Neutron, which is second in our list.

Option H: Proton, Neutron, Positron, Electron → Yes! That's exactly our order: a=Proton, b=Neutron, c=Positron, d=Electron.

Wait, no. Wait, in our case, a=Proton, b=Neutron, c=Positron, d=Electron. So the order is P, N, E+, E-.

Looking at the options, which option has P, N, E+, E- in order?

Looking at each option:

Option H: Proton, Neutron, Positron, Electron → Yes, that's exactly our order. So option H is the correct one.

Wait, but let me double-check the order. Option H: H is "Proton, Neutron, Positron, Electron". Yes, that matches a to d.

The nuclear equations are solved by balancing atomic and mass numbers. For part (a), the missing particle is a proton (atomic number +1, mass number +1). For part (b), the missing particle is a neutron (atomic number 0, mass number +1). For part (c), the missing particle is a positron (atomic number +1, mass number 0). For part (d), the missing particle is an electron (atomic number -1, mass number 0). The correct order of particles is Proton, Neutron, Positron, Electron, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
