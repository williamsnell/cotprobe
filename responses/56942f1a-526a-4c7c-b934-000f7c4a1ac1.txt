Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when there's a negative or contractionary supply shock. The options are from A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should remember what a supply shock is. From what I've studied, a supply shock refers to an event that suddenly changes the productive capacity of an economy. There are two types: positive and negative (or contractionary) supply shocks. A positive shock increases the economy's output, while a negative one decreases it.

Now, the question is about the effect of a negative supply shock. I think this would reduce the economy's ability to produce goods and services. So, the first thing that comes to mind is how this affects the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve shows the relationship between unemployment and inflation. In a contractionary supply shock, the economy's potential output decreases. I remember that when the potential output decreases, the Phillips curve shifts. But I'm not exactly sure which direction it shifts. 

Let me think. The Phillips curve typically slopes downward, indicating that as unemployment decreases, inflation increases, and vice versa. If there's a negative supply shock, the economy can't produce as much as before. So, at any given price level, the economy can't supply as much, which might lead to higher inflation for the same level of output. Alternatively, it could mean that the economy is operating below its new lower potential output, leading to higher unemployment for a given inflation rate. 

Wait, I think I might have it backwards. Let me visualize the Phillips curve. If the supply shock is contractionary, the economy's short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shifts to the left. A leftward shift in SRAS would mean that at every price level, the quantity of output supplied is less. This would lead to higher prices (inflation) for the same level of demand, or it could lead to higher unemployment because the economy can't produce as much.

So, how does this affect the Phillips curve? The Phillips curve is essentially a curve that shows the trade-off between unemployment and inflation. If the SRAS shifts left, then for any given level of demand, the economy produces less and prices are higher. This situation would cause the Phillips curve to shift outward. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

In the Phillips curve framework, a negative supply shock (like an increase in oil prices) reduces aggregate supply. This leads to higher inflation for a given level of output, or higher output needed to achieve the same inflation rate. So, the Phillips curve shifts to the right because, at every level of unemployment, inflation is higher. Alternatively, for a given inflation rate, the unemployment rate is higher. So, the curve shifts outward, which is to the right.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the SRAS shifts left, the equilibrium real GDP decreases. This leads to higher inflation and higher unemployment. So, the Phillips curve, which plots inflation against unemployment, would shift. If the economy is now operating at a lower potential output, the curve would shift outward. That is, for the same level of unemployment, inflation is higher. So the curve shifts to the right.

So, looking at the options, option D says "shift the Phillips curve to the right." That seems correct.

Let me quickly review the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A is shifting the Phillips curve left, which would mean lower inflation for the same unemployment, which doesn't fit a contractionary shock. Options B and C talk about investment demand and money demand curves. Investment demand is about how much investment happens at different interest rates; a contractionary supply shock doesn't directly affect that. Similarly, money demand is about transactions, precautionary motives, etc., not directly caused by a supply shock. So, the correct answer should be D.

A negative or contractionary supply shock reduces the economy's productive capacity, shifting the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the left. This leads to higher inflation for a given level of output or higher output required to achieve the same inflation rate. Consequently, the Phillips curve, which shows the relationship between unemployment and inflation, shifts to the right. This is because, at every level of unemployment, inflation is higher due to the reduced supply capacity.
