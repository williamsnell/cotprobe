The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Consider the ABO blood group locus in humans, which has six (6) alleles reported for it, of which three are most prominent, I^A, I^B andi. The I^A and I^B alleles are both dominant toiandcodominantto each other. A woman of blood group O marries a man who has blood group B. There are four children in the family: a son and daughter of blood group O; a daughter who has A blood type; and a son who has B blood type. One of the children is adopted. Which child is the adopted child?

Options:

A: the daughter of blood group O
B: The son with A blood type
C: the son of blood group O
D: the daughter who has blood group A
E: None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred
F: The daughter with AB blood type
G: the son who has B blood type
H: The son with AB blood type
I: The daughter with B blood type
J: The child with a rare blood type not listed

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about the ABO blood group locus. Hmm, I remember that the ABO system has three main alleles: I^A, I^B, and i. I think i is recessive, and I^A and I^B are codominant with each other. Right, so people with I^A or I^B are either A or B, and AB means they have both. Oh wait, no, AB has both I^A and I^B, so they have AB blood type.

The question says a woman with blood group O marries a man with blood group B. Blood group O is ii, so she must have two i alleles. The man has B, so his genotype must be I^B i, because i is recessive. Wait, wait, no—wait, no, because if he's B, he could be either I^B I^B or I^B i. But since the parents have children with O and others, let's think.

The woman is O, so genotype ii. The man is B, so his genotype is either I^B I^B or I^B i. Let's figure out which one it is based on the children. The children are: a son and daughter with O, a daughter with A, and a son with B.

Wait, so let's break down the possible alleles each parent can contribute.

The mother is ii, so she can only give i alleles. The father is B; if he's I^B I^B, he can only give I^B. If he's I^B i, he can give either I^B or i.

So let's see the possible children:

If the father is I^B I^B:

- Each child gets I^B from father and i from mother. So all children would be I^B i, which is blood group B. But the children include O, A, and another B. So that can't be right because the father being I^B I^B would only produce B children. But the family has O, A, and B children, so the father must have the i allele.

So father's genotype must be I^B i.

So the father can pass on either I^B or i.

The mother is ii, so only i.

So possible children:

Each child gets i from mother and either I^B or i from father.

So possible offspring:

- i (from mom) + I^B (from dad) → I^B i → blood group B.

- i (mom) + i (dad) → ii → blood group O.

So the children can be either B or O.

Wait, but the family has a daughter with A, so that's a problem. Because according to this, the children can only be B or O. But the daughter has A, which is I^A. How?

Wait, that's impossible if the father is I^B i and the mother is ii. Because the father can't pass on I^A. So the daughter with blood group A must have I^A, which neither parent has. So that suggests that one of the children is adopted, because the parents can't produce a child with I^A.

Wait, let's think again. The mother is O (ii), so she can't give any A or B alleles. The father is B, so his genotype is I^B i. So he can give either I^B or i.

So possible children:

From mother: i.

From father: I^B or i.

So possible combinations:

I^B i → blood group B.

i i → blood group O.

So the children can only be B or O. But the family has a daughter with A. That's impossible unless there's a mutation or adoption.

So the daughter with A must be the adopted one.

Wait, but let me check the children again. The family has four children: a son and daughter of O, a daughter with A, and a son with B.

So the daughter with A is the one who doesn't fit. So she must be adopted.

Looking at the options, option D is the daughter with A. So the adopted child is D.

The woman has blood group O (genotype ii), and the man has blood group B (genotype I^B i). The ABO blood group system has three main alleles: I^A, I^B, and i, where i is recessive, and I^A and I^B are codominant. 

The woman can only pass on the i allele, while the man can pass on either I^B or i. Therefore, the possible genotypes for their children are:

- I^B i (blood group B)
- ii (blood group O)

The family includes four children: a son and daughter with blood group O, a daughter with blood group A, and a son with blood group B. Blood group A corresponds to the genotype I^A i, which neither parent can produce, as neither the woman nor the man has the I^A allele. This indicates that the daughter with blood group A is not biologically related to the couple and must be the adopted child.

Answer: D
