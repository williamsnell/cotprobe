Okay, so I need to figure out what the median international income was as of 2020. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to break it down. First, I know that median income means the middle value when all incomes are ordered from lowest to highest. It's not the average, which can be skewed by very high incomes.

I remember hearing that global income can vary a lot between countries. For example, in developed countries like the USA or Germany, the average income is much higher than in developing countries. But the median would be more representative of the typical person's income, not just the average pulled up by a few wealthy individuals.

I think the World Bank or some similar organization might have data on this. From what I recall, the World Bank often reports on global poverty lines, and I think the poverty line is around $2.15 a day, which is about $785 a year. But that's the extreme poverty line, not the median. So maybe that's too low for the median.

On the other hand, I've heard that a significant portion of the world's population lives on less than $10,000 a year. I think the median might be somewhere in that range. Let me think about the options given. The options are A: $300, B: $15,000, C: $1,000, D: $10,000, E: $40,000, F: $30,000, G: $20,000, H: $25,000, I: $50,000, J: $5,000.

Well, $300 (A) seems way too low. Even the extreme poverty line is higher than that. So A is probably wrong. J is $5,000, which is higher than the poverty line but still low. I think the median would be higher than that because more people might be earning more than $5k, but I'm not sure.

C is $1,000, which is still quite low. I don't think that's the median. B is $15,000, which seems a bit high as a median. D is $10,000, which sounds more plausible. I've read before that around half the world's population lives on less than $10k annually, so that might be the median.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. If the median is the middle point, then half of the world's population earns less than that, and half earns more. So if the median is $10,000, it means 50% earn less and 50% more. I think that's correct because many people, especially in developing countries, earn less, while a significant portion in developed countries earn much more.

So the options are D: $10,000 and maybe G: $20,000. Hmm. I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should consider the purchasing power parity. Because $10,000 in the US might not be the same as in other countries. But I think the question is asking about nominal income, not adjusted for PPP.

I remember reading a report that stated the global median income was around $10,000 a year. So I'm leaning towards D as the correct answer. The other options like $20k or $25k seem too high for the median because only a smaller portion of the global population would earn that much. Plus, considering countries like India and China have large populations with lower incomes, the median would be pulled down closer to $10k.

So after considering all this, I think the median international income as of 2020 is $10,000, which is option D.

The median international income as of 2020 is best estimated at $10,000, considering the global distribution of income and the influence of lower incomes in developing countries. 

Answer: D
