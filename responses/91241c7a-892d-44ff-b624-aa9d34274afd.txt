Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which explanation would satisfy an auditor when they're questioning management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a debit to accumulated depreciation means. Accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account, so when you debit it, you're increasing the amount of depreciation. That usually happens when you either write off an asset or change the way you're depreciating it.

The auditor is concerned about significant debits, so they're looking for a legitimate reason why the company increased the accumulated depreciation. It's possible that the company made a mistake, like overstating or understating expenses in previous years, or maybe they changed their accounting methods.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Plant assets were retired. Retiring assets would involve removing them from the books. When you retire an asset, you debit accumulated depreciation and credit the asset account. This makes sense because it's a legitimate reason for a debit. So this could be a possible answer.

Option B: Prior years' depreciation was overstated. If they overstated depreciation before, that means they've already debited too much. But if they're correcting that, they might need to adjust the accumulated depreciation. Maybe they're reducing it, but the question is about debits, so this might not explain a significant debit now. Or maybe they're adjusting, but I'm not sure how this would cause a debit in the current year. It could be a possibility if they're restating, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Prior years' depreciation was understated. If they understated depreciation, they didn't charge enough in previous years. To correct this, they might need to increase the accumulated depreciation in the current year, which would involve debiting it. This could be a valid explanation because the company is catching up on depreciation, so this would cause a significant debit. This seems plausible.

Option D: Company revalued plant assets. Revaluing assets would typically adjust the asset account, not the accumulated depreciation. Unless they're changing the method, but usually, revaluation would affect the asset's value, not the accumulated depreciation directly. So maybe this isn't the best fit.

Option E: Depreciation method changed. Changing the method could affect how depreciation is calculated. If they switch to a method that requires more depreciation, that would increase accumulated depreciation. So this could be a reason for a significant debit. For example, switching from straight-line to an accelerated method would increase the current year's depreciation, leading to a debit.

Option F: Current year's depreciation was understated. If the current year's expense was understated, that means they didn't debit enough. So the auditor is concerned about significant debits, but if the expense was understated, maybe they didn't make a big enough debit. This might not explain a significant debit because it would actually mean they didn't record enough. So this might not be the right option.

Option G: Salvage value was revised upward. If the salvage value increases, the depreciation expense would decrease because you're depreciating the asset over its cost minus salvage. So this would mean a lower depreciation expense each year, not a higher one. Therefore, this would not cause a significant debit but rather a credit or lower debit, so it's unlikely to explain the situation.

Option H: Remaining useful lives were revised upward. Similar to G, if the useful life is longer, the annual depreciation expense would decrease because it's spread over more years. So this would lead to lower depreciation, not higher, so this wouldn't explain a significant debit. It might explain a decrease in depreciation, but the question is about a debit, so this is probably not the right answer.

Option I: Significant purchases of plant assets. Purchasing more assets would increase the balance of plant assets, but accumulated depreciation is a contra account. If you buy more assets, you'd debit accumulated depreciation when you write them off, but usually, when you buy new assets, you start depreciating them, which would involve debiting depreciation expense and crediting accumulated depreciation. Wait, no, when you record depreciation, you debit expense and credit accumulated depreciation. So if they bought a lot of assets, they might have more depreciation to record, leading to more debits to accumulated depreciation. So this could be a reason because they have more assets to depreciate, thus more debits.

Now, thinking about the options, the auditor is concerned about significant debits to accumulated depreciation. So which of these would cause that?

A: Retiring assets would mean removing them, which involves debiting accumulated depreciation, but it's a one-time adjustment. It's possible but not necessarily the only reason.

C: Prior years' understatement would require increasing accumulated depreciation in the current year, which would involve debiting it. That makes sense because they're correcting past errors by increasing the accumulated depreciation now, which would be a debit. So this would explain a significant debit.

E: Changing the depreciation method could lead to higher depreciation in the current year, causing more debits to accumulated depreciation. For example, switching to a more aggressive method would increase the expense, hence more debits.

I: Purchasing more assets would lead to more depreciation, so more debits to accumulated depreciation each period. So this could also be a valid reason.

So which of these is the most likely explanation that would satisfy the auditor?

The question is about "significant debits" in the current year. Let's think:

If the company changed the method (E), that could cause a one-time adjustment or an ongoing higher depreciation. If they made purchases (I), that would lead to higher depreciation moving forward. If prior years were understated (C), they might have to make a large adjustment in the current year to correct it, which would cause a significant debit.

But which of these is more likely the correct answer?

In accounting, when you have a prior year error, you correct it in the current year. So if prior years' depreciation was understated, the company would have to increase accumulated depreciation in the current year, which would involve a debit. That would be a significant debit because it's correcting past mistakes.

Alternatively, if they changed the method (E), that could also lead to a significant debit, but it depends on how the method was changed. For example, changing to a method that requires more depreciation would increase the current year's expense, leading to a debit.

Similarly, purchasing a lot of assets (I) would mean more depreciation each period, leading to ongoing debits, but the question is about a significant debit in the current year. So it could be either C, E, or I.

Wait, but the question is about an explanation that would satisfy the auditor. The auditor is likely looking for a reason that either corrects past errors or justifies a change in accounting that leads to higher accumulated depreciation.

Option C: Prior years’ depreciation expenses were erroneously understated. This would mean that in prior years, they didn't charge enough depreciation. To correct this, they would have to increase the accumulated depreciation in the current year by debiting it. This would be a valid explanation because it's correcting an error, and the auditor would understand that the company is adjusting for past mistakes.

Alternatively, if the company made purchases (I), the auditor might expect that the depreciation would be higher in the current year, but the question is about the accumulated depreciation account being debited. So when you purchase assets, you start depreciating them, which would involve debiting the accumulated depreciation account each period. So that could also explain significant debits.

Wait, but accumulated depreciation is a contra account. When you record depreciation for the current year, you debit accumulated depreciation and credit the asset. So if you have more assets, you'd have more depreciation each period, leading to more debits. That would make sense.

So which is more likely? The question is about significant debits in the current year. If the company made significant purchases, they would have more depreciation to record, leading to more debits. Alternatively, if they corrected prior errors, that could also cause a significant debit.

I think both C and I are possible, but the question is about which explanation would satisfy the auditor. The auditor might be concerned because a significant debit could indicate a correction of prior year errors. So if management says they corrected prior years' understatement, that would explain the debit.

Alternatively, purchasing assets would naturally lead to higher depreciation each year, which would include more debits to accumulated depreciation. So if the company made a lot of purchases, that would also make sense.

I'm a bit torn between C and I. Let me think again: the question is about "significant debits" in the current year. If the prior years were understated, they might have to make a large adjustment in the current year, causing a significant debit. Alternatively, purchasing assets would mean ongoing higher depreciation, but the question is about the current year's debits, which could be significant either way.

But I think the most direct answer is that the company made significant purchases, leading to more depreciation. So option I would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: when you make a purchase, you debit the asset account and credit cash or another account. Then, each period, you record depreciation by debiting accumulated depreciation and crediting the depreciation expense. So the accumulated depreciation account is being debited each period as part of depreciation. So if they made a lot of purchases, each period's depreciation would include more debits to accumulated depreciation.

But the question is about a significant debit in the current year. So if they made a lot of purchases, the accumulated depreciation would be higher, but each month's depreciation would involve a debit. So over the year, the total debit would be significant.

Alternatively, if prior years' depreciation was understated, they might have to make a large adjustment in the current year, perhaps in one journal entry, leading to a significant debit.

I think the most likely explanation that an auditor would accept is that the company made significant purchases, leading to more depreciation. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but another thought: the question is about accumulated depreciation being debited. When you purchase an asset, you don't immediately debit accumulated depreciation. You only do that when you start depreciating it. So if they made purchases, the initial purchase is recorded as an asset, not affecting accumulated depreciation. Then, each period, they depreciation, so accumulated depreciation is debited each month. So over the year, the total debits would be higher due to more assets being depreciated.

Alternatively, if they retired assets (option A), they would remove them from the books, which would involve debiting accumulated depreciation. But that's a one-time event, not an ongoing debit.

Wait, the question is about significant debits in the current year. So if they made purchases, the accumulated depreciation would have more debits each period, leading to a higher total for the year. So that would explain the significant debits.

But I'm still a bit confused between C and I. Let me think of the accounting entries.

If prior years' depreciation was understated (C), the company would need to increase accumulated depreciation in the current year. For example, if in prior years they didn't record enough depreciation, they might have to make a large adjustment in the current year by debiting accumulated depreciation. This would be a significant debit in the current year.

Alternatively, purchasing assets (I) would mean that each month, more depreciation is recorded, leading to more debits each month, but these are spread out, not a single significant debit. Unless the purchases were made late in the year, but generally, it's spread out.

So if the auditor is seeing a significant debit in the current year, it's more likely due to an adjustment, such as correcting prior year errors, rather than ongoing purchases. Therefore, option C might be the better answer.

Wait, but let me think again. If you have prior years' depreciation expenses understated, that means the accumulated depreciation account was too low. To correct that, you would need to increase the accumulated depreciation, which involves debiting it. So you would make a journal entry like:

Debit Accumulated Depreciation (to increase it)
Credit Retained Earnings (or some income statement adjustment)

This would be a significant debit because you're correcting past mistakes. So the auditor would understand that the company is adjusting for prior errors, leading to a significant debit in the current year.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Prior years’ depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.

The question asks which explanation would most likely satisfy an auditor concerning significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year. Accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account, and a debit to it indicates an increase in depreciation. The auditor is seeking a legitimate reason for such a significant debit.

### Analysis of Options:

- **Option A (Plant assets retired):** Retiring assets involves removing them from the books, which requires debiting accumulated depreciation. However, this is a one-time adjustment and may not explain significant ongoing debits throughout the year.

- **Option B (Prior years' depreciation overstated):** Overstated depreciation in prior years would typically require a reduction in accumulated depreciation, not an increase. This does not align with the scenario of significant debits in the current year.

- **Option C (Prior years' depreciation understated):** If prior years' depreciation was understated, the company would need to increase accumulated depreciation in the current year to correct the error. This would involve significant debits to the account, making it a plausible explanation.

- **Option D (Revalued plant assets):** Revaluation typically affects the asset account, not accumulated depreciation. This is unlikely to cause significant debits to accumulated depreciation.

- **Option E (Depreciation method changed):** Changing the depreciation method could lead to higher depreciation expenses, causing more debits. However, this explanation is less direct than correcting prior errors.

- **Option F (Current year's depreciation understated):** Understating the current year's depreciation would not explain significant debits but rather a lack of them, making this option unlikely.

- **Option G (Salvage value revised upward):** An upward revision in salvage value would decrease depreciation expenses, not increase them, so this does not explain significant debits.

- **Option H (Remaining useful lives revised upward):** Extending the useful lives would also decrease depreciation expenses, making this an unlikely explanation.

- **Option I (Significant purchases):** Purchasing more assets would lead to higher depreciation expenses, causing more debits to accumulated depreciation. However, these debits would be spread out over the year, not necessarily a single significant debit.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is **Option C**, as correcting prior years' understatement of depreciation would require a significant debit to accumulated depreciation in the current year. This directly addresses the auditor's concern and provides a clear, legitimate reason for the adjustment.
