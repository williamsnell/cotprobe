Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with projectile motion yet. But I'll try to tackle it step by step. Let's see, the problem is about a ball being thrown directly upward and staying in the air for 10 seconds. They're asking three things: the initial speed, the speed when it hits the ground, and how high it goes. And I have to choose from options A to J.

First, I remember that when something is thrown straight up, its motion is affected by gravity. The time it stays in the air depends on its initial velocity and the acceleration due to gravity. I think the formula for time of flight when thrown upward is related to the velocity and the gravitational acceleration.

Wait, I think the time to reach the maximum height is equal to the initial velocity divided by the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, actually, the total time in the air would be twice that, right? Because it takes time to go up and the same time to come down. Oh, but wait, that's assuming it's thrown from the ground and lands at the same elevation. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so I guess I can assume that.

So the formula for time of flight t is t = (2v₀)/g, where v₀ is the initial velocity and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, I should check the units. The options are in feet per second, so I guess we're using imperial units. I think the acceleration due to gravity near Earth's surface is about 32 ft/s² downward.

So rearranging the formula, v₀ = (g * t) / 2. Let me plug in the numbers. t is 10 seconds, so v₀ = (32 ft/s² * 10 s) / 2. That's (320) / 2 = 160 ft/s. So part (a) should be 160 ft/s. Looking at the options, option B has (a) as 160 ft/s. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, is the formula correct? Because if the ball is thrown upward, it goes up, stops, then comes back down. The time to reach the peak is v₀/g, and the time to come back down is the same. So total time is 2*(v₀/g). So v₀ = g * t / 2. Yeah, so 32 * 10 / 2 = 160 ft/s. So (a) is 160. That's option B.

Now part (b), what's its speed when it hits the ground? Well, when it comes back down, assuming it lands at the same height it was thrown from, the speed should be the same as the initial speed but in the opposite direction. Because in projectile motion without air resistance, the speed upon return is equal to the initial speed. So the speed would be -160 ft/s, since upward is positive and downward is negative. So (b) is -160. That fits with option B as well.

Now part (c), how high does the ball rise? The maximum height can be calculated using the kinematic equation. I think the formula is v² = u² + 2as. At the top, the final velocity v is 0, initial velocity u is 160 ft/s, acceleration a is -32 ft/s² (since it's acting downward). So, 0 = (160)^2 + 2*(-32)*s. Solving for s.

Calculating that: 0 = 25600 - 64s. So 64s = 25600, so s = 25600 / 64. Let me do that division: 25600 divided by 64. 64 * 400 = 25600, because 64*400=25600. So s=400 ft. So the maximum height is 400 ft. That matches option B's (c) value of 400 ft.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I use the right formula? Another approach is to use the equation s = ut - (1/2)gt². At maximum height, the time taken to reach there is t = v₀/g = 160/32 = 5 seconds. So plugging back into s: s = 160*5 - 0.5*32*(5)^2. 160*5 is 800. 0.5*32 is 16, times 25 (5 squared) is 400. So s=800-400=400. Yep, same result. So the height is 400 ft.

So all three parts of the question match option B. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is determined by analyzing the time of flight, final speed, and maximum height of the ball. Using kinematic equations and assuming gravity is 32 ft/s², the initial velocity is calculated as 160 ft/s, the final speed upon return is -160 ft/s, and the maximum height is 400 ft. These values match option B.

Answer: B
