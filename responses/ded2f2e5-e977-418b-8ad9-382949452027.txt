The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan…In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China…
When we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…"

Okay, so I have this history question here about the differences in Mongol administration between their Russian domains and China, based on an excerpt from Ibn Battuta's Voyages. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question is comparing how the Mongols administered their Russian territories versus China between 600 C.E. and 1450 C.E. The excerpt from Ibn Battuta talks about China (which I assume is Hangzhou) in the 14th century. He mentions that the Chinese were considered infidels, but the Mongols allowed Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others to live in their own areas. There's a lot about the administration there—towns for different groups, walls around districts, a judge, elders, and merchants. It sounds like the Mongols in China were pretty tolerant of various religions and facilitated trade, as the city is described as beautiful and the people wealthy.

Now, thinking about the Mongol Empire's administration in Russia around that time. I remember that the Mongols, also known as the Golden Horde, ruled over parts of Russia, like the area around the Volga River. Their approach was different from China. From what I recall, the Mongols in Russia imposed a system where they extracted tribute, often in the form of goods and slaves. They allowed local rulers, called princes, to maintain some autonomy but under Mongol overlordship. There was a system of military control, and the Mongols didn't really interfere much with the local governance as long as the tribute was paid.

In China, as described by Ibn Battuta, it seems like the Mongols were more integrated into the existing administrative structures. They allowed for the continuation of existing bureaucracies and were more tolerant of different religions, including Islam, which was a big deal because the Yuan dynasty (Mongol rulers in China) was quite eclectic in their religious policies. They also facilitated trade, which is evident from the bustling cities and the presence of various merchants and religious groups.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly states how the Mongol administration in Russia differed from that in China. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Resulted in isolation vs. facilitating trade. The excerpt shows that China was part of international trade, so if Russia was isolated, that could be a difference. But I'm not sure if Mongol Russia was isolated. They were part of the Silk Road, so probably not. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B: Only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity vs. favoring many traditions. The Mongols in Russia probably tolerated local religions, including Orthodox Christianity, but in China, they favored multiple traditions, including Buddhism and Islam. So the wording here might be off because in Russia, they were more about not interfering, but in China, they were more about supporting various groups. So B could be a possibility.

Option C: Relied on tribute vs. emulated Chinese bureaucracy. The Mongols in Russia did rely on tribute from principalities, while in China, they might have used a more centralized system. But I'm not sure if China emulated the Chinese system or replaced it. The Yuan dynasty used the existing Chinese bureaucracy, so maybe C is correct.

Option D: Granted autonomy to local rulers vs. direct control. In Russia, the Mongols allowed local princes but kept control through tribute, so they granted some autonomy. In China, the Yuan dynasty took over the existing administrative system, imposing direct control. So D seems correct so far.

Option E: Imposed Islamic law vs. allowed diverse practices. The excerpt says in China, Muslims, Jews, Christians, etc., were present and treated well. The Mongols in China allowed diverse practices, while in Russia, they might have been more about military control and less about imposing any specific law. So E might not be correct because the Mongols in Russia probably didn't impose Islamic law; they were more about collecting tribute.

Option F: Viewed favorably vs. domestic unrest. I don't think the Mongols were viewed favorably in Russia. They were seen as oppressive, so F probably isn't right.

Option G: Led to decline of cities vs. encouraged urban development. The excerpt describes a vibrant city, so G is probably not correct.

Option H: Lacked administrative structure vs. robust system. The Yuan dynasty had a robust system, while the Golden Horde might have had a looser structure, so H might be correct.

Option I: Stimulated trade vs. curtail economic activity. The Chinese excerpt shows trade was happening, but in Russia, I'm not sure if trade was curtailed. The Mongols in Russia might have allowed some trade as well, so I might not be the right choice.

Option J: Discouraged inter-cultural exchanges vs. promoted integration. The Chinese excerpt shows cultural integration, so if in Russia they discouraged it, that could be a difference. But I'm not certain about that.

Now, focusing on the options, I think D and H are strong candidates. The question is about how the administration in Russia differed from China. The Yuan dynasty (China) had a more centralized system, taking over existing bureaucracies, whereas the Golden Horde (Russia) allowed local rulers more autonomy. So D says the Mongols granted autonomy in Russia while imposing direct control in China. That seems correct.

Option H says that in Russia, the administration lacked a well-defined structure, while China had a robust system. That's also true because the Yuan dynasty used the existing Chinese bureaucratic system, making it robust, whereas the Golden Horde had a more flexible, less centralized approach. So H is also a contender.

Wait, the question asks about the Mongol administration in Russia compared to China. So in Russia, the Mongols didn't impose direct control but allowed local rulers (autonomy), while in China, they did impose direct control. So D is correct.

Alternatively, H is about the administrative structure. China had a robust system because they used the Chinese bureaucracy, while Russia's administration was more about military control and less about a structured system. So H might also be correct.

But the question is which option correctly states the difference. The key is to find which aspect was different. From the excerpt, in China, the Mongols allowed various religious groups, facilitated trade, and had a structured administration. In Russia, the Mongols were more about military control, tribute, and less about direct governance, allowing local rulers.

So D says, in Russia, they granted autonomy, while in China, they imposed direct control. That seems accurate.

H is about the administrative structure—lacked vs. robust. That's also correct. So now I'm a bit confused between D and H.

Looking back at the options, the question is about what the Mongol administration in Russia differed in compared to China. The excerpt focuses on the Chinese administration's structure, including judges, colleges, mosques, etc., which suggests a more organized system. In Russia, the Mongols probably didn't establish such a structured system but instead allowed local rulers to manage, with the Mongols focusing on tribute and military presence.

So both D and H seem correct, but I need to pick the best fit. The question is about how the administration differed, so perhaps the key is the administrative approach: direct control vs. autonomy.

The answer options are:

D: granted autonomy to local rulers, while the Mongol administration in China imposed direct control.

H: lacked a well-defined administrative structure, while the Mongol administration in China established a robust bureaucratic system.

Which one is more accurate? The Yuan dynasty did impose direct control through the existing Chinese bureaucracy, making their administrative structure robust. The Golden Horde in Russia didn't have such a system; they imposed less direct control and allowed local rulers more autonomy, which fits D.

Alternatively, H is also correct because the Mongol administration in Russia lacked a robust structure compared to China. But the question is about what the Mongol administration in Russia did that was different, so the main difference would be the approach to local rulers.

I think D is the better answer here because it directly contrasts the administrative approach: autonomy in Russia vs. direct control in China.
</think>

The Mongol administration in Russia differed from that in China in that, while the Mongols in Russia granted local rulers autonomy and focused on collecting tribute, the Mongols in China imposed direct control through a centralized bureaucratic system. This is best captured by option D, which highlights the contrasting administrative approaches in the two regions.

Answer:
D
