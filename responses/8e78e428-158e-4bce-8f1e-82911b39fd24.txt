Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Miranda rights question. Let me read through the scenario again and break it down step by step.

So, a man is approached by a police officer on the street. The officer grabs his arm and says he wants to talk. The man is in a hurry to watch a baseball game, but the officer asks what he was doing at the liquor store last week. The man responds, "I was there during the robbery." Then the officer arrests him and charges him with robbery. At the police headquarters, he's booked and for the first time, he gets his Miranda warnings. He waives his rights and confesses to being an accessory. Now, the man's attorney is moving to suppress both statements.

The trial court granted the motion to suppress the first statement because it was a Miranda violation. Now, the attorney is moving to suppress the second statement made at headquarters. The question is whether this second statement should be suppressed.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are A through J. Let me go through each option and see which makes the most sense.

First, I need to remember Miranda rights basics. Miranda warnings are required when a person is in custody and being interrogated. If the warnings aren't given, any statements made can be excluded as evidence.

In this case, the first statement was made on the street without Miranda warnings, so it was suppressed. The second statement was made after Miranda warnings at the police station. The key here is whether the second statement is admissible despite the first being suppressed.

Option A says the second statement should be granted because he didn't have an attorney present. But Miranda doesn't require an attorney to be present unless the suspect invokes their right to counsel. The man waived his rights, so having an attorney present isn't required unless he specifically asked for one. So A might not be the right choice.

Option B says it's not granted because the first statement doesn't affect the second. That makes sense because each statement is evaluated on its own legality. The first was illegal, but the second could be legal if properly given Miranda warnings. So the first doesn't taint the second unless there's some link.

Option C says it's not granted because the second was volunteered after a knowing waiver. Wait, but Miranda requires that the waiver be knowing and voluntary. If he waived his rights correctly, then his statement would be admissible. However, the question is whether the second statement was indeed a voluntary waiver. The fact that he was arrested and then given warnings might affect this, but if he waived correctly, C could be a possibility.

Option D says not granted because he had already confessed. But that's not a legal reason. The fact that he confessed doesn't make the second statement admissible; it's about whether the Miranda warnings were properly given and whether the statement was voluntary.

Option E says the second statement was willingly given. But willingness alone doesn't make it admissible if the Miranda process wasn't followed. So E might not be correct.

Option F says granted because the first was excluded, and the second is tainted. This is the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine, which excludes evidence obtained as a result of illegal activity. But this usually applies when the second statement is a direct result of the first illegal action. Here, the first statement was obtained without Miranda, but the second was after proper Miranda. So F might not apply because the second was made after the Miranda warnings, which would break the chain.

Option G says granted because he wasn't informed of his rights before the second statement. But the scenario says he was given Miranda warnings at the police headquarters, so G is incorrect.

Option H says not granted because Miranda was correctly given before the second statement. That seems correct because if the Miranda warnings were properly administered and the waiver was knowing, the statement should be admissible.

Option I says granted because he was under duress. There's no indication of duress in the second statement. He was in custody but that's part of the Miranda process, so I don't think this applies.

Option J says granted because the second was the fruit of the first. But again, the second statement was made after proper Miranda, so it's not tainted by the first. The fruit of the poisonous tree applies when evidence is obtained as a result of an illegal act. Here, the second statement was given after the Miranda warnings, so it's not tainted.

So putting it together, the first statement was suppressed because there were no Miranda warnings. The second statement was given after proper Miranda warnings, and the man waived his rights. Therefore, the second statement should be admissible. Looking at the options, H says it's not granted because the Miranda was correctly given. So the motion to suppress the second statement should not be granted.

Wait, but the man was under arrest and in custody when he made the second statement. Miranda applies when a person is in custody and being interrogated. The officer read him his Miranda warnings, and he waived them. Therefore, the second statement should be allowed unless the waiver wasn't knowing or voluntary.

The problem states he "waived his rights and confessed." So assuming the waiver was valid, the statement is admissible. Therefore, the motion to suppress the second statement should not be granted because Miranda was correctly given before the second statement. So H is the correct answer.

The second statement was made after the man was given Miranda warnings at police headquarters, and he waived his rights. Since the Miranda warnings were properly administered and the waiver was knowing, the second statement should be admissible. The first statement's suppression due to Miranda violations does not affect the legality of the second statement. Therefore, the motion to suppress the second statement should not be granted.

The answer is H.
