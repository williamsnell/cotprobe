Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the profit in U.S. dollars for a product made in Mexico and sold in Europe. I'm a bit new to these types of currency conversion problems, so I'll take it slow.

First, let's understand the given data:

- The product costs 116.50 pesos to produce and ship to Europe.
- It sells for 20 euros in Europe.
- Exchange rates: 
  - 0.1099 USD buys one Mexican peso (so, 1 peso = 0.1099 USD)
  - 0.8928 USD buys one euro (so, 1 euro = 0.8928 USD)

Wait, no, actually, I think I might have that backwards. Let me double-check. If it costs 0.1099 USD to buy one peso, that means each peso is worth less than a dollar. So, 1 peso = 0.1099 USD. Similarly, 0.8928 USD buys one euro, meaning each euro is more valuable than a dollar. So, 1 euro = 0.8928 USD, which is the same as 1 euro = 0.8928 USD. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because a euro is more valuable than a dollar. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as how many USD you need to buy one unit of the foreign currency.

Wait, no, if 0.1099 USD buys one peso, that's the exchange rate from USD to MXN. So, to get 1 MXN, you spend 0.1099 USD. So, the exchange rate is USD/MXN = 0.1099, meaning 1 MXN = 0.1099 USD. Similarly, 0.8928 USD buys one euro, so the exchange rate is USD/EUR = 0.8928, meaning 1 EUR = 0.8928 USD.

Wait, but that can't be right because typically, euros are stronger than dollars. So, maybe I'm getting the exchange rates wrong. Let's clarify: The exchange rate is given as how many USD you need to buy one foreign currency unit. So, if it's 0.1099 USD per peso, that means 1 MXN = 0.1099 USD. Similarly, 0.8928 USD per euro means 1 EUR = 0.8928 USD. Wait, that would imply that 1 euro is worth less than a dollar, which isn't correct because in reality, the euro is stronger. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the exchange rates.

Maybe the exchange rates are given as how much foreign currency you get per USD. Oh, wait, perhaps the rates are expressed as foreign currency per USD. For example, if 1 USD buys 0.1099 MXN, that would mean each USD is worth 0.1099 MXN, so the exchange rate is 1 USD = 0.1099 MXN. But that seems very low, implying that the MXN is much weaker than the USD, which is possible. Similarly, 1 USD buys 0.8928 EUR, so 1 USD = 0.8928 EUR. That also seems odd because in reality, 1 USD is about 0.9 EUR, so perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but the question says: "0.1099 U.S. dollars are required to buy one Mexican peso." So to get 1 peso, you need 0.1099 USD. That means 1 MXN = 0.1099 USD. Similarly, "0.8928 U.S. dollars are required to buy one euro," meaning 1 EUR = 0.8928 USD. Hmm, that does mean the euro is weaker than the dollar, which is not correct. So maybe I'm interpreting the exchange rates incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the exchange rate is given as the number of foreign currency units per USD. So, if 0.1099 USD buys 1 MXN, that would be 1 MXN per 0.1099 USD, which implies that 1 USD = 1 / 0.1099 MXN ≈ 9.09 MXN. Similarly, 0.8928 USD buys 1 EUR, so 1 EUR = 0.8928 USD, which means 1 USD = 1 / 0.8928 ≈ 1.12 EUR. Wait, that makes more sense because 1 USD is worth about 1.12 EUR, which aligns with typical exchange rates.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The exchange rate is given as how much USD is needed to buy one unit of foreign currency. So, for MXN, 0.1099 USD buys 1 MXN, so the exchange rate is USD/MXN = 0.1099. That means 1 MXN = 0.1099 USD. So, to convert pesos to USD, you multiply by 0.1099.

Similarly, for EUR, 0.8928 USD buys 1 EUR, so 1 EUR = 0.8928 USD. To convert euros to USD, you multiply by 0.8928.

Wait, but that would mean that 1 EUR is less than 1 USD, which is not correct. Because in reality, 1 EUR is about 1.12 USD. So, perhaps the exchange rates are given as the number of foreign currency units per USD. So, for example, if the exchange rate is 0.1099 USD per MXN, that would imply that 1 USD can buy 1 / 0.1099 MXN ≈ 9.09 MXN. Similarly, 1 USD can buy 1 / 0.8928 EUR ≈ 1.12 EUR. That makes more sense because it aligns with the real-world exchange rates where 1 USD is about 1.12 EUR.

Wait, so perhaps the way to think about it is:

- To get 1 MXN, you spend 0.1099 USD. So, the exchange rate is 1 MXN = 0.1099 USD.
- To get 1 EUR, you spend 0.8928 USD. So, 1 EUR = 0.8928 USD.

Wait, but that would mean that 1 EUR is less than 1 USD, which is incorrect. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the exchange rates. Let me try to frame it differently.

Another approach: The exchange rate is how much of the foreign currency you get per USD. So, for MXN, if 1 USD buys 10.099 MXN (because 1 / 0.1099 ≈ 9.09 MXN per USD), and for EUR, 1 USD buys 1.12 EUR (since 1 / 0.8928 ≈ 1.12 EUR per USD). That makes sense because 1 USD is about 1.12 EUR.

So, to find the profit, I need to calculate the cost in USD and the revenue in USD, then subtract cost from revenue.

Cost in USD: The production cost is 116.50 pesos. Since each peso is 0.1099 USD, the cost in USD is 116.50 * 0.1099.

Revenue in USD: The selling price is 20 euros. Each euro is 0.8928 USD, so revenue is 20 * 0.8928.

Then, profit is revenue minus cost.

Let me compute each step.

First, compute cost in USD:

116.50 pesos * 0.1099 USD/peso = ?

Let me calculate that:

116.50 * 0.1099.

Well, 116.5 * 0.1 = 11.65

116.5 * 0.0099 ≈ 116.5 * 0.01 = 1.165 → but since it's 0.0099, it's slightly less. Let's compute 116.5 * 0.0099:

0.0099 is 99/10000, so 116.5 * 0.0099 = (116.5 * 99)/10000.

But maybe it's easier to do 116.5 * 0.1099.

Alternatively, 116.5 * 0.1099 = ?

Let me compute 116.5 * 0.1 = 11.65

Then 116.5 * 0.0099 = ?

0.0099 is 0.01 - 0.0001.

So 116.5 * 0.01 = 1.165

Minus 116.5 * 0.0001 = 0.01165

So 1.165 - 0.01165 = 1.15335

So total cost in USD is 11.65 + 1.15335 = 12.80335 USD, approximately 12.8034.

Now, revenue in USD: 20 euros * 0.8928 USD/euro = ?

20 * 0.8928 = ?

Well, 20 * 0.89 = 17.8

20 * 0.0028 = 0.056

So total is 17.8 + 0.056 = 17.856 USD.

So revenue is 17.856 USD.

Now, profit is revenue minus cost: 17.856 - 12.8034 = ?

Let me subtract:

17.856  
-12.8034  
= ?

17.856 - 12.8 = 5.056

But since it's 12.8034, subtract 0.0034 more: 5.056 - 0.0034 = 5.0526 USD.

Wait, that would be approximately $5.05.

Looking at the options, option D is $5.06, which is very close. So the profit would be approximately $5.06.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, cost in USD: 116.50 * 0.1099.

Calculating 116.50 * 0.1099.

Let me use a calculator approach:

116.50 * 0.1 = 11.65

116.50 * 0.0099 = ?

0.0099 is 99/10000.

116.50 * 0.0099 = (116.50 * 99)/10000.

116.50 * 99 = 11533.5 (since 116.5 * 100 = 11650, minus 116.5 gives 11650 - 116.5 = 11533.5)

Divide by 10000: 11533.5 / 10000 = 1.15335

So total cost is 11.65 + 1.15335 = 12.80335 USD.

Revenue: 20 * 0.8928 = ?

20 * 0.8928 = 17.856 USD.

Profit: 17.856 - 12.80335 = 5.05265 USD, which is approximately $5.05.

Looking at the options, D is $5.06, which is the closest. So the answer should be D.
</think>

The profit is calculated by converting the production cost from pesos to USD and the revenue from euros to USD, then subtracting the cost from the revenue. The production cost of 116.50 pesos converts to approximately $12.80 USD, and the revenue of 20 euros converts to $17.86 USD. The profit is $17.86 - $12.80 = $5.06 USD.

Answer: D
