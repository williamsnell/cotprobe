Question:

Physics students are checking the constant acceleration equations of kinematics by measuring the velocity of a tennis ball that is dropped and falls 6 meters and then passes through a photogate. The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Which of the following best describes the cause of the large percent difference?

Options:

A: Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball.
B: The ball experienced magnetic interference during the fall.
C: The ball's velocity decreased due to collision with another object.
D: The gravitational pull fluctuates during the fall.
E: The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.
F: The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity.
G: The ball changes its shape while falling.
H: The ball's mass increased during the fall.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the physics students are getting a 20% higher predicted velocity than the measured one when dropping a tennis ball. Hmm, let's think about what factors could cause this discrepancy.

First, I remember the kinematic equations for constant acceleration. The basic idea is that if you drop an object, it should accelerate due to gravity, right? The velocity should increase as it falls. But wait, in real life, air resistance plays a big role, especially with something like a tennis ball. Oh, but wait—air resistance usually opposes the motion, slowing the ball down. So if the predicted velocity is higher than the measured, that means the actual velocity is lower than expected. So maybe air resistance is causing it to not reach the predicted speed.

Looking at the options, option A says air resistance increases acceleration. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Air resistance would oppose the motion, so it would actually reduce the acceleration. Because without air resistance, the acceleration is just g (9.8 m/s²), but with air resistance, the acceleration is less. So if the ball's acceleration is less, then its velocity would be lower than what's predicted by the equations that assume no air resistance. That would mean the photogate measures a lower velocity, which aligns with the problem statement where the measured is lower than the predicted.

Option B is about magnetic interference. Unless the ball is magnetic, which a tennis ball isn't, this probably isn't the issue. So B is unlikely.

Option C suggests the ball's velocity decreased due to collision. But the ball was just dropped and fell 6 meters, so unless it bounced or hit something, but the question says it passed through a photogate, so maybe it didn't collide. Plus, the question says it's during the fall, so maybe not.

Option D talks about gravitational pull fluctuating. Gravity does vary slightly depending on location, but over 6 meters, the variation isn't that significant. So D might not be the main reason.

Option E says gravity varies as the ball falls. Similar to D, but again, over such a short distance, the change in g is negligible. So E is probably not the cause.

Option F suggests acceleration varies with velocity. Hmm, that's more like a variable acceleration scenario, which would mean the equations are more complex. But the equations used are for constant acceleration, so if the acceleration isn't constant, that would affect the prediction. But why would the acceleration vary with velocity? Maybe if something else is acting, like air resistance, which depends on velocity. Oh, wait, that's another point. Air resistance causes the acceleration to decrease as the ball speeds up because the force depends on velocity squared. So the acceleration isn't constant; it's decreasing over time. The kinematic equations assume constant acceleration, so using them would give a higher velocity than actual because they don't account for the decreasing acceleration due to air resistance. So F could be part of the reason.

Option G says the ball changes shape. If it deforms, that could increase air resistance, affecting the velocity. But I'm not sure if that's the main factor here. It's possible, but maybe not the primary reason.

Option H suggests the mass increased, which would affect acceleration. But if mass increases, the acceleration due to gravity (F=ma) would change. But gravity's acceleration is g, which is independent of mass. So H probably doesn't make sense.

Wait, going back to the options. The question states that the predicted velocity is 20% higher than measured. So the actual velocity is lower. The standard kinematic equations assume no air resistance, so when air resistance is present, the actual acceleration is less than g, leading to a lower velocity than predicted. So the cause is air resistance. So option A says air resistance increases acceleration—that's incorrect because air resistance would decrease acceleration. Oh wait, maybe I misread option A. Let me check again. A: Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball. Wait, that's not right. Air resistance acts opposite to the motion, so it would decrease the net acceleration. So A is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up acceleration and velocity. If you have air resistance, the net acceleration is less than g. So the ball's acceleration is less, which would make the velocity lower than what's predicted. So the problem is that the model didn't account for air resistance, so the prediction is higher. So which option addresses this? Looking again, option F says acceleration varies with velocity. That's more about the acceleration not being constant, which is true because with air resistance, acceleration decreases as velocity increases. So when using the constant acceleration equations, the prediction would be higher than actual because the equations assume a constant acceleration (g) and don't account for the decreasing acceleration due to air resistance.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. The main issue is air resistance causing a lower velocity, so the reason is that air resistance wasn't considered. So the correct answer would be F, because the acceleration isn't constant—it varies with velocity. Or is it A? Wait, no, because A says air resistance increases acceleration, which is wrong. So the correct reasoning is that the acceleration isn't constant due to air resistance, so the equations assuming constant acceleration overestimate the velocity. Therefore, the cause is that the acceleration varies with velocity, which is option F.

Wait, but another way to think: the constant acceleration equations assume no air resistance. So when air resistance is present, the acceleration isn't constant. So the model's assumption is wrong, leading to a higher prediction. So the percent difference is due to the acceleration not being constant, which varies with velocity. So option F is the best choice.

The question involves a discrepancy between the predicted and measured velocities of a falling tennis ball, with the predicted velocity being 20% higher than the measured value. The key issue lies in the assumptions of the kinematic equations used for the prediction, which assume constant acceleration due to gravity (g) and neglect factors like air resistance.

When air resistance is present, it opposes the motion of the ball, reducing its actual acceleration. As the ball falls, the force of air resistance increases with velocity, causing the net acceleration to decrease over time. This means the ball's acceleration is not constant, which violates the assumptions of the constant acceleration equations. As a result, the equations overestimate the velocity, leading to a higher predicted value compared to the actual measured velocity.

Option A incorrectly states that air resistance increases acceleration, which is not true. Air resistance decreases the net acceleration. Option B (magnetic interference) and Option H (mass increase) are unlikely because they are not relevant to the scenario. Options D and E (gravitational fluctuations) are negligible over a short fall distance. Option C (collision) is not mentioned in the problem. Option G (shape change) could affect air resistance, but it is not the primary cause. Option F correctly identifies that the acceleration varies with velocity due to air resistance, making it the best explanation for the discrepancy.
