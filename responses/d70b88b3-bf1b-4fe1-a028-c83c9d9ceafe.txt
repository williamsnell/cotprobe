Okay, so I have this question about cancer cells grown in culture compared to normal cells. The question is asking what they are similar in, and I have to choose the correct option from A to J. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that both normal and cancer cells can be grown in culture, but there are some key differences. I think cancer cells are known for their ability to divide indefinitely, unlike normal cells which have a limited number of divisions (like the Hayflick limit). So that makes me think about option B: divide an indefinite number of times. But wait, I should check all options.

Option A says they don't have the ability to metastasize. Hmm, but metastasis is more about spreading in the body, right? In culture, both might not show metastasis because they're in a controlled environment. So maybe A is not the right choice because the question is about similarity, not differences.

Option C is about programmed cell death, apoptosis. I think cancer cells often bypass apoptosis, so normal cells undergo it, but cancer cells don't. So C might not be correct because they are different in that aspect.

Option D says they can grow without a nutrient supply. That doesn't sound right. Cells in culture need nutrients; otherwise, they wouldn't grow. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: do not require oxygen. No, most cells require oxygen for respiration, whether normal or cancer. Some cancer cells might use anaerobic respiration, but I don't think that's a similarity in culture conditions.

Option F: proliferate to the same cell density. I'm not sure about this. I think cancer cells might grow more rapidly, so they might reach higher densities than normal cells. So F might not be correct.

Option G: repair DNA efficiently. Cancer cells might have defective DNA repair mechanisms, so G is probably not correct.

Option H: not susceptible to mutations. That's the opposite. Cancer cells are more prone to mutations because that's how they develop. So H is wrong.

Option I: require a surface for attachment. I remember that many cells, including cancer cells, need a surface to grow, like adhering to something. Normal cells usually do this too. So I think I is correct because both might require attachment.

Option J: do not display contact inhibition. Contact inhibition is when cells stop dividing when they touch each other. Cancer cells lose this, so in culture, normal cells might stop, but cancer cells keep growing. So J is a difference, not a similarity.

Wait, the question is about what they are similar in. So looking back, option I says both require a surface for attachment. That sounds right because both normal and cancer cells typically need a substrate to grow properly in culture. Without it, they might not proliferate well. So I think the answer is I.

But wait, earlier I thought B might be correct because cancer cells can divide indefinitely. But normal cells in culture can only divide a certain number of times. So in that case, B is a difference. So B is not a similarity.

So the similarities would be things like needing nutrients, oxygen, and a surface. So the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I: require a surface for attachment in order to grow.
