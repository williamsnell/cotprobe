Okay, so I have this question about Epicurus and his view on the wealth needed for a good life. Hmm, I remember Epicurus was a Greek philosopher, right? I think he focused a lot on happiness and living a simple life. So the question is asking about the wealth he believed was necessary. The options are A to J.

Let me think about what I know. Epicurus talked about the "good life," which he associated with a simple, moderate lifestyle. He emphasized that happiness comes from within, not from external wealth. So he probably didn't think you needed a lot of money or material possessions. Instead, he might have believed that the basic necessities are enough.

Looking at the options, A says "easily procured." That makes sense because if wealth is just the basics, it's not hard to get. B says available only to the educated. I don't think so; Epicurus probably thought it's accessible to everyone, not just the educated. C is about the rich, which doesn't fit because he was against excessive wealth.

D is about material possessions, but Epicurus was against accumulating a lot. E is constant labor, which sounds more like a different philosophy, maybe like Aristotle. F says attainable for everyone through effort, but I don't recall Epicurus requiring effort; he thought the basics were enough. G is about inheritance or luck, which doesn't seem right. H says wealth isn't necessary, but the question is about wealth required, so maybe H is too extreme. I is for gods, which makes no sense. J is a lifetime of pursuit, which again sounds more like a different approach.

So putting it together, Epicurus probably thought the necessary wealth is the basics and easily obtainable. So the answer should be A: easily procured.
