Okay, so I've got this problem about communication links using dipole antennas. Hmm, dipole antennas... I remember they're common in radio communications. The question says both are λ/2 dipoles, and they're in a free space environment. The transmitter is sending 1 kW of power to the transmitting antenna. I need to find out how much power the receiver connected to the receiving dipole will get, given it's 500 km away. The frequency is 200 MHz, and the path is normal to each dipole, theta is 90 degrees, and they're aligned.

Alright, first, I think I should start by recalling the basic concepts. Free space loss, right? The power received by the antenna depends on the transmitted power, the distance, and the gain of the antennas. Oh wait, but dipoles are usually considered as having a certain radiation pattern. Since theta is 90 degrees, the dipoles are aligned, but the path is normal to each dipole. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the configuration.

Wait, when they say the path is normal to each dipole, that means the line connecting the two antennas is perpendicular to the direction each dipole is pointing. So each dipole is oriented so that their axes are perpendicular to the line of sight. Hmm, but wait, dipole radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis. Oh right, because a dipole radiates most strongly perpendicular to its axis. So if the path is along the dipole axis (theta = 0), the radiation would be minimal. But here, theta is 90 degrees, so the path is along the direction of maximum radiation. Wait, no, because theta is the angle between the direction of propagation (line connecting the two) and the dipole's axis. So if theta is 90 degrees, the dipole is perpendicular to the line of sight. So the dipole's radiation pattern would be such that the maximum radiation is in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis, which in this case would be in the plane of the line of sight. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the radiation pattern for a dipole is such that it's most efficient when the line of sight is perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So the dipole is aligned such that the line between the two is perpendicular to each dipole's axis, so the radiation is maximum. So each dipole is oriented so that their axes are perpendicular to the line connecting them, which would be the case when the dipoles are aligned and the path is normal to each.

In any case, for the purpose of calculating the received power, I think the key factors are the path loss and the gain of the antennas. But wait, since both are dipole antennas, their gain might be considered as isotropic? Or maybe they have a certain radiation pattern that affects the effective gain.

Wait, dipole antennas have a radiation pattern that's maximum at theta = 90 degrees in the plane. So when the receiver is at theta = 90 degrees, the transmitted power is at maximum. That would mean the receiver is in the direction of maximum radiation, so the gain would be maximum. But wait, the dipole's radiation is maximum in the direction perpendicular to its axis. So if the dipole is aligned such that the line between the two antennas is along the dipole's axis (theta=0), then the radiation would be minimal, but if the line is perpendicular (theta=90), then the radiation is maximum. So in this case, since theta is 90, the dipole is radiating most effectively towards the receiver.

Wait, but the problem states that the path is normal to each dipole, so theta is 90 degrees. So the dipoles are oriented such that their axes are perpendicular to the line of sight. Therefore, the radiation is maximum in that direction. So the gain of each dipole in that direction is maximum.

But wait, dipole antennas have a certain radiation pattern. The gain of a dipole is typically given as 2.15 dBi for a half-wave dipole, which is higher than an isotropic radiator. So in that direction, the gain is higher than isotropic.

Wait, but maybe in this problem, they're assuming the dipoles are aligned and the path is normal, so we can model them as having maximum gain, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're treated as isotropic, but I think that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps we can model each dipole as having a gain G, and the total received power would be (Pt * Gt * Gr) / (4 * pi * d^2 * L), where L is the loss factor? Wait, no, in free space, the path loss is just the inverse square law, but the gain of the antennas would also play a role.

Wait, perhaps the formula I need is the received power Pr = Pt * (Gt * Gr) / (4 * pi * d^2), where Gt and Gr are the gains of the transmitting and receiving antennas, respectively, and d is the distance between them.

But wait, if the dipole is a half-wave dipole, then its gain is about 2.15 dBi, so in the direction of maximum radiation (theta=90), the gain would be 2.15 dBi. Alternatively, the dipole has a certain radiation pattern, but perhaps for this problem, they're assuming the dipoles are ideal and have a certain effective area, so maybe we can consider them as having a certain gain.

Wait, but wait, in the case where the dipole is aligned such that the line of sight is along the dipole's axis (theta=0), the radiation is minimal, but in our case, theta is 90 degrees, so the line of sight is in the plane of maximum radiation. So the dipole's gain in that direction is maximum, which is about 2.15 dBi.

Alternatively, perhaps the dipole's radiation is considered to be isotropic, but that's not accurate. So, I think I should proceed with the formula for received power considering the gains of both antennas.

So, the formula would be:

Pr = (Pt * Gt * Gr) / (4 * pi * d^2 )

But wait, another approach: the power radiated by the dipole is given by the radiation resistance. The power delivered to the antenna is Pt, which is 1 kW. The efficiency of the antenna is assumed to be 100% for simplicity, so the power radiated is Pt. Then, the received power depends on the antenna gains and the distance.

Wait, but dipole antennas have a certain radiation pattern, and their gain is maximum in certain directions. So for a half-wave dipole, the gain is about 2.15 dBi, which is about 1.64 times the power of an isotropic source. So, Gt = Gr = 2.15 dBi, which is 10^(2.15/10) ≈ 1.64.

Wait, but let me think again. The gain in the direction of maximum radiation is 2.15 dBi, which is 1.64 times the gain of an isotropic radiator. So, if both antennas are aligned such that the receiver is in the direction of maximum gain for both, then the total gain factor would be (1.64)^2 = 2.6896.

But I'm not sure if both antennas contribute their gain. Wait, the transmitting antenna's gain affects how much power is transmitted in the direction of the receiver, and the receiving antenna's gain affects how much of the transmitted power it captures. So both gains multiply.

So, Pr = (Pt * Gt * Gr) / (4 * pi * d^2 )

But wait, in free space, the path loss is 1/(4 * pi * d^2), so the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the dipole's gain is 1.64, so Gt = Gr = 1.64.

But wait, let me confirm: a half-wave dipole has a maximum gain of 2.15 dBi, which corresponds to a gain of about 1.64 in linear terms (since 10^(2.15/10) ≈ 1.64). So, Gt = Gr = 1.64.

So, Pt is 1 kW, which is 1000 W.

Distance d is 500 km, which is 500,000 meters.

Frequency is 200 MHz, which is 200e6 Hz.

Wait, but we might not need the frequency for this calculation, unless we're trying to compute wavelength for some other reason, but perhaps it's given to find the wavelength for gain considerations. Hmm.

Wait, the gain of a dipole depends on the wavelength and the size, but since it's a half-wave dipole, the length is λ/2. So, we can compute λ.

Wavelength λ = c / f, where c is speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, λ = 3e8 m/s / 200e6 Hz = 1.5 meters.

So the dipole is λ/2, which is 0.75 meters long. That's correct for a half-wave dipole.

But maybe that's not necessary for the calculation, unless we're considering the effective area, but I think the gain is already given by the dBi value.

So, putting it all together:

Pr = (Pt * Gt * Gr) / (4 * pi * d^2 )

Pt = 1000 W

Gt = Gr = 1.64

d = 500,000 m

So,

Pr = (1000 * 1.64 * 1.64) / (4 * pi * (5e5)^2 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1000 * 1.64 * 1.64 = 1000 * (1.64)^2 ≈ 1000 * 2.6896 ≈ 2689.6

Denominator: 4 * pi * (5e5)^2 = 4 * pi * 25e10 = 100e10 * pi ≈ 3.1416 * 1e12 ≈ 3.1416e12

So, Pr ≈ 2689.6 / 3.1416e12 ≈ ?

Wait, 2689.6 / 3.1416e12 = 2689.6 / 3,141,600,000,000 ≈ approximately 8.56e-10 W.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 7.85e-10 W, and option F is 1.64e-10 W, etc. Hmm, but my estimate is around 8.56e-10, but that's not one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, denominator: 4 * pi * (5e5)^2.

(5e5)^2 = 25e10 = 2.5e11.

4 * pi * 2.5e11 = 10 * pi * 1e11 = 10 * 3.1416 * 1e11 = 3.1416e12.

Wait, wait, 4 * pi * 2.5e11 = (4 * 3.1416) * 2.5e11 ≈ 12.5664 * 2.5e11 = 3.1416e12. So that's correct.

Numerator: 1000 * (1.64)^2 = 1000 * 2.6896 = 2689.6.

So Pr = 2689.6 / 3.1416e12 ≈ 8.56e-10 W.

Hmm, but none of the options match that exactly. The closest is option A: 7.85e-10 W.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the gain. Maybe the dipole's gain is considered as 1.5 or 2, or perhaps in this problem, the dipole is treated as an isotropic radiator, which would have Gt=Gr=1. Let me check that.

If Gt=Gr=1, then Pr = (1000 * 1 * 1) / (4 * pi * (5e5)^2) = 1000 / (4 * pi * 25e10) = 1000 / (1e12 * pi) ≈ 1000 / (3.1416e12) ≈ 3.18e-10 W.

Hmm, 3.18e-10 is close to option A (7.85e-10) but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the gain. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the dipole's gain is 2.15 dBi, so Gt=Gr=10^(2.15/10) ≈ 1.64, which I used earlier. So with that, the calculation gives around 8.56e-10, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the power received is Pt * (lambda/(4 pi d))^2 * (Gt * Gr) / (lambda^2/(4 pi)^2)) ), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another formula for the received power is:

Pr = (Pt * Gt * Gr * (lambda/(4 pi d))^2 )

Wait, because the effective aperture of the dipole is A = lambda^2/(4 pi) * G, so the power received would be Pt * Gt * Gr * (lambda/(4 pi d))^2.

Wait, so let's compute lambda first.

lambda = c/f = (3e8 m/s) / (200e6 Hz) = 1.5 m.

So lambda = 1.5 m.

So, (lambda/(4 pi d))^2 = (1.5 / (4 * pi * 5e5))^2.

Let me compute that.

4 * pi * 5e5 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 5e5 ≈ 12.5664 * 5e5 ≈ 6.2832e6.

So, 1.5 / 6.2832e6 ≈ 2.387e-7.

Then, (2.387e-7)^2 ≈ 5.69e-14.

Now, Pr = Pt * Gt * Gr * 5.69e-14.

Assuming Gt=Gr=1.64, then:

Pr = 1000 * 1.64 * 1.64 * 5.69e-14.

Calculate 1.64 *1.64 ≈ 2.6896.

So, 1000 * 2.6896 ≈ 2689.6.

Then, 2689.6 * 5.69e-14 ≈ ?

2689.6 *5.69e-14 ≈ 1.53e-10 W.

Ah, that's option C: 1.53 × 10^-10 W.

Wait, that makes sense. So I think I made a mistake earlier in the first approach, perhaps by not considering the effective area correctly.

So the correct calculation would be:

Pr = (Pt * Gt * Gr) * (lambda/(4 pi d))^2.

Which gives 1.53e-10 W, so option C.
</think>

To determine the power received by the receiver, we use the formula for received power in free space:

\[
P_r = P_t \cdot G_t \cdot G_r \cdot \left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} \right)^2
\]

### Given:
- \( P_t = 1 \, \text{kW} = 1000 \, \text{W} \)
- \( f = 200 \, \text{MHz} = 200 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( d = 500 \, \text{km} = 500,000 \, \text{m} \)
- \( \theta = 90^\circ \), path is normal to dipoles, so both dipoles have maximum gain \( G_t = G_r = 1.64 \) (from \( 2.15 \, \text{dBi} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate Wavelength (\( \lambda \))
The wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{200 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}} = 1.5 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} \right)^2 \)
\[
\frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} = \frac{1.5}{4 \pi \cdot 500,000} = \frac{1.5}{6,283,200} \approx 2.387 \times 10^{-7}
\]
\[
\left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} \right)^2 = (2.387 \times 10^{-7})^2 \approx 5.69 \times 10^{-14}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Received Power (\( P_r \))
\[
P_r = 1000 \cdot 1.64 \cdot 1.64 \cdot 5.69 \times 10^{-14}
\]
\[
1.64 \cdot 1.64 = 2.6896
\]
\[
P_r = 1000 \cdot 2.6896 \cdot 5.69 \times 10^{-14} \approx 1.53 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W}
\]

### Final Answer:
The power received by the receiver is approximately \( 1.53 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W} \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
