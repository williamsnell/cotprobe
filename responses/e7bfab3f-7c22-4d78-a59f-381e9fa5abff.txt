Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about naming an organic compound, specifically CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3. I need to find the correct IUPAC name from the given options A to J.

First, I remember that IUPAC naming involves a few key steps: identifying the parent chain, numbering the carbon chain to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, and then naming the substituents in alphabetical order.

Let me start by drawing the structure. The formula is CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So that's a five-carbon chain because there are five CH groups in a row. Wait, no, actually, the chain is CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So the parent chain is pentane because there are five carbons.

Wait, no, actually, let's count the carbons: The first carbon is CH3, then CHBr, then CHCl, then CH2, then CH3. So that's five carbons in a row. So the parent chain is pentane.

Next, I need to number the carbons from 1 to 5. The substituents are Br and Cl on the second and third carbons. Wait, let me check: The structure is CH3-CHBr-CHCl-CH2-CH3. So the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3.

Now, I need to assign the numbers correctly. When numbering the chain, I should choose the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So if I number from the left, the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3. If I number from the right, the substituents would be on carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, because the chain is symmetric when you look from both ends. Let me visualize: Carbon 1 is CH3, carbon 2 is CHBr, carbon 3 is CHCl, carbon 4 is CH2, carbon 5 is CH3. If I number from the other end, carbon 5 would be carbon 1, and the substituents would be on carbons 4 and 3, which when counting from the other end would be carbons 2 and 3. So the numbering doesn't change; the substituents are still on carbons 2 and 3 regardless of the direction. Therefore, the numbering is correct as is.

So the substituents are Br on C2 and Cl on C3. Now, when naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So Br comes before Cl in the alphabet? Wait, no, actually, the order is based on the substituent names. Let me think: Bromine (Br) starts with B, and Chlorine (Cl) starts with C. So B comes before C, so Br should be listed before Cl. But wait, the main thing is the order in the name. So the substituents are 2-bromo and 3-chloro.

Wait, no, wait. The substituents are on carbons 2 and 3, but when writing the name, do I list them in the order of their positions? Or their alphabetical order? I think it's the alphabetical order regardless of their positions. So Br (bromo) comes before Cl (chloro) because B comes before C.

So the name should be 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane? Wait, no, that's the opposite. Because Br is on C2 and Cl on C3, but when naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So Br (bromo) comes before Cl (chloro), so the name would be 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.

Wait, but let me make sure. The substituents are on C2 and C3. The substituents are Br and Cl. So when writing the name, the order is alphabetical, regardless of their position. So Br comes first because B comes before C. So the substituents would be named as bromo and then chloro. So the name would be 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.

Looking at the options, let's check each one:

Option A: 2-bromo, 3-chloropropane. Wait, propane is three carbons, but our chain is five. So that's incorrect.

Option B: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane. That matches what I thought: pentane with Br on C2 and Cl on C3, in alphabetical order. So this seems correct.

Option C: 2,3-dibromochloropentane. Wait, that implies two Br atoms, but we only have one Br and one Cl. So that's wrong.

Option D: trichlorodibromopentane. That would mean multiple substituents, but we only have one Br and one Cl. So D is wrong.

Option E: 2-chloro, 3-bromopentane. Here, chloro comes before bromo, which would be incorrect because bromo should come first alphabetically. So E is incorrect.

Option F: 2,3-chlorobromopentane. This seems like it's combining the substituents as chlorobromo, but I think each substituent is named separately. So F might be incorrect because it's not using the correct numbering or substituent order.

Option G: 2,3-bromochloropentane. Similarly, this combines the substituents, which might not be the correct way. I think each substituent is named separately, so the correct way is to have bromo and chloro as separate, not combined as bromochloro.

Option H: 3-bromo, 2-chloropentane. This swaps the positions of the substituents, so that's incorrect.

Option I: dibromotrichloropentane. Again, this implies multiple Br and Cl, which we don't have. So I is wrong.

Option J: dibromotrichloropropane. Again, propane is wrong and multiple substituents, so J is incorrect.

So the correct option is B: 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane.

The compound CH3CHBrCHClCH2CH3 consists of a five-carbon chain (pentane) with bromine (Br) on carbon 2 and chlorine (Cl) on carbon 3. When naming, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so bromo (Br) comes before chloro (Cl). Thus, the correct name is **2-bromo, 3-chloropentane**, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
