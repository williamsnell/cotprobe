Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about using gallium in a barometer instead of mercury. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question is asking for the height of a gallium column that would sustain 1 atm pressure. I remember that in a barometer, the height of the liquid depends on its density and the pressure it's supporting. Mercury is commonly used because it's very dense, which is why the mercury barometer has a column height of about 76 cm or 760 mm.

Wait, right. The formula I think is related to pressure. Oh yeah, pressure P equals density ρ multiplied by gravity g and the height h. So P = ρgh. We need to solve for h, so h = P/(ρg).

The density of gallium is given as 6.09 g/cm³ at 35°C. I should probably convert that to kg/m³ to match standard units. Let me calculate that. Since 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³, so 6.09 g/cm³ is 6.09 * 1000 = 6090 kg/m³.

The pressure P is 1 atm. I remember that 1 atm is approximately 101325 Pascals. Pascals are kg/(m·s²), so that's consistent with the units for the other variables.

Gravity g is about 9.81 m/s².

Now plugging into the formula: h = P/(ρg) = 101325 Pa / (6090 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s²). Let me compute the denominator first: 6090 * 9.81. Let's see, 6000 *9.81 is about 58860, and 90*9.81 is about 882.9, so total is roughly 59742.9.

So h = 101325 / 59742.9 ≈ approximately 1.697 meters. Oh wait, the options are in millimeters. So 1.697 meters is 1697 mm. That would be option A: 1697 mm Ga.

Wait a second, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversions. Gallium's density is 6.09 g/cm³. Converting to kg/m³: since 1 g = 0.001 kg and 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so 6.09 g/cm³ is 6.09 * (0.001 kg) / (1e-6 m³) )= 6.09 * 1000 kg/m³ = 6090 kg/m³. That part seems right.

Pressure is 1 atm, which is 101325 Pa. So yes, using those numbers. The calculation for h comes to around 1.697 meters, which is 1697 mm. So the answer should be option A.
</think>

The height of the gallium column in a barometer at 1 atm pressure is calculated using the formula \( h = \frac{P}{\rho g} \), where \( P = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \), \( \rho = 6090 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Substituting these values gives \( h \approx 1.697 \, \text{m} \), which is equivalent to 1697 mm.
