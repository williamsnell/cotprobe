Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the diameter of the objective lens is 30 mm. The angular magnification is 5x. The observer's pupil is 5 mm in diameter. I need to find the fraction of the objective's area that's actually used. The options are from A to J, like 80%, 70%, etc.

Wait, I remember that in telescopes, the angular magnification (M) is related to the diameters of the objective and the eye's pupil. Oh right, the formula is M = (D Objective) / (D Pupil). So M = D_obj / D_eye.

Given that M is 5x, D_obj is 30 mm, and D_eye is 5 mm. Let me plug in the numbers: M = 30 / 5 = 6. Wait, but the given M is 5. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Oh, wait no, I think I'm correct. Because the maximum angular magnification of a telescope (like an astronomical telescope) is given by M = (D_obj) / (D_eye). So if the given M is 5, then according to the formula, M should be 30 / 5 =6. But the problem states M is 5. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing angular magnification with something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual light gathering area. But the question is about the fraction of the objective's area that's used. So maybe it's about how much of the objective's area is actually contributing to the image because of the eye's pupil size.

Oh, right! The area used would depend on how much the light from the objective can pass through the eye's pupil. So the area depends on the ratio of the diameters squared.

Wait, the area of the objective is π*(D_obj/2)^2. The area of the pupil is π*(D_eye/2)^2. So the fraction would be (Area_pupil) / (Area_obj) = (D_eye/D_obj)^2.

So the fraction is (5/30)^2 = (1/6)^2 = 1/36, which is approximately 0.0277 or about 2.77%. But wait, none of the options are that low. The options are like 10%, 25%, etc. Hmm, maybe I messed up the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of 'exit pupil'. The exit pupil of a telescope is the diameter of the beam coming out of the eyepiece. The exit pupil diameter (D_exit) is D_obj / M.

So D_exit = 30 mm / 5 = 6 mm. Now, the eye's pupil must be at least as large as the exit pupil to utilize the full brightness. But in this case, the eye's pupil is 5 mm, which is smaller than 6 mm. So the eye can't capture the entire exit pupil. So the area used would be the area of the eye's pupil compared to the area of the exit pupil.

So the fraction would be (D_eye / D_exit)^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.694, about 69.4%. Looking at the options, 70% is option B. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compare the eye's pupil to the objective's diameter.

Wait, wait. The question is about the fraction of the objective's area that's utilized. So perhaps it's about how much of the objective's light is actually captured by the eye. But I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, maybe the fraction is (D_eye / D_obj)^2. So (5/30)^2 = 1/36 ≈ 2.77%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another approach: The maximum angular magnification M is determined by M = D_obj / D_eye. So if M is 5, then D_obj = M * D_eye → 5 * 5 =25 mm. But the given D_obj is 30 mm, which is larger than 25 mm. So the actual M would be higher if the eye's pupil were larger.

So when the eye's pupil is fixed at 5 mm, the actual M is 30/5=6, but the problem states M is 5. Maybe they used a different formula or perhaps it's a different type of telescope, like a Galilean telescope, but I don't think that affects this calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the fraction of the objective's area that is used based on the eye's pupil. So the area used would be the area of the pupil compared to the area of the objective. So fraction = (Area_pupil)/(Area_obj) = (π*(5/2)^2) / (π*(30/2)^2) ) = (25)/(900) = 1/36 ≈ 2.77%. That's not an option. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on the exit pupil. The exit pupil is D_obj / M =30/5=6 mm. So the area of the exit pupil is π*(6/2)^2=9π. The area of the objective is π*(30/2)^2=225π. So the fraction is (9π)/(225π)= 9/225=1/25=0.04, which is 4%. Again, not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is about the fraction of the area of the objective that's actually used. So the area used would be the area of the eye's pupil compared to the objective's area. So (5/30)^2=1/36≈2.77%. But no option matches. So perhaps the question is referring to the brightness, which is proportional to the area of the exit pupil.

Wait, perhaps the fraction is the area of the exit pupil (6mm) compared to the eye's pupil (5mm). So (5/6)^2≈0.694, so about 69.4%, which is close to 70%. Option B. But the question is about the objective's area used, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction is the area of the eye's pupil compared to the objective's area, which is 1/36≈2.77%. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: the magnification is 5x. So the linear dimensions are multiplied by 5. But for area, it's the square of that. So perhaps the area used is related to that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The objective's area is 30mm diameter, so 30mm. The eye's pupil is 5mm. So the ratio is 5/30 =1/6. Then, the area ratio is (1/6)^2 =1/36≈2.77%. But again, not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the fraction of the objective's area that is used for the image, which would depend on the eye's ability to capture the light from the telescope. If the exit pupil is larger than the eye's pupil, then only a part of the exit pupil is used, which affects the area. So the area used would be (D_eye / D_exit)^2 = (5/6)^2≈0.694, so 69.4%, which is approximately 70%, option B.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the area used is (D_eye / D_obj)^2. So 5/30 is 1/6, squared is 1/36≈2.77%. But that's not an option. So perhaps the answer is close to 70%, so option B.

The problem involves determining the fraction of the objective lens area utilized in a telescope. The key steps involve understanding the relationship between the telescope's angular magnification, the objective diameter, and the observer's pupil diameter. The angular magnification \( M \) is given by \( M = \frac{D_{\text{objective}}}{D_{\text{pupil}}} \), where \( D_{\text{objective}} = 30 \, \text{mm} \) and \( D_{\text{pupil}} = 5 \, \text{mm} \). Using the formula, \( M = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \), but the problem states \( M = 5 \). This discrepancy suggests focusing on the fraction of the objective's area used.

The area of the objective is proportional to \( \pi \left(\frac{D_{\text{objective}}}{2}\right)^2 \), and the area of the pupil is \( \pi \left(\frac{D_{\text{pupil}}}{2}\right)^2 \). The fraction of the objective's area used is given by the ratio of these areas:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{pupil}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{objective}}} = \left(\frac{D_{\text{pupil}}}{D_{\text{objective}}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{30}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{36} \approx 0.0277 \, (2.77\%).
\]

However, this value does not match any provided option. Considering the exit pupil, which is \( D_{\text{exit}} = \frac{D_{\text{objective}}}{M} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \, \text{mm} \), the fraction of the exit pupil area used by the eye's pupil is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \left(\frac{D_{\text{pupil}}}{D_{\text{exit}}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \approx 0.694 \, (69.4\%).
\]

This value aligns closely with option B (70%). Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the fraction of the objective's area utilized corresponds to the fraction of the exit pupil area captured by the eye's pupil.

Answer: B
