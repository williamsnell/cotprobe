Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a camera photographing a sodium lamp. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. The camera is 100 meters away from a 120-W sodium lamp. The exposure time is 1/100 seconds, and the camera's aperture diameter is 4 cm. I need to find out how many photons enter the camera during the exposure. The wavelength of sodium light is given as 5893 Ångströms, which I think is 5893 × 10^-10 meters. Also, all the energy of the lamp is emitted as light, which probably means I can ignore other forms of energy loss.

First, I think I need to calculate the number of photons the lamp emits in that time, and then figure out how many of those reach the camera. Wait, but maybe it's better to find the total number of photons the lamp emits and then determine how much of that reaches the camera's aperture.

Wait, but the lamp is 100 meters away, so the light spreads out over a large area. The camera's aperture is 4 cm in diameter, so the area is pi*r², where r is 2 cm, which is 0.02 meters. So the area is π*(0.02)^2 = π*0.0004 ≈ 0.001256 m².

But the lamp emits light in all directions, so the total surface area over which the photons spread is a sphere with radius 100 meters. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so 4π*(100)^2 = 4π*10,000 ≈ 125,664 m².

So the fraction of the light that reaches the camera is the area of the aperture divided by the surface area of the sphere. That fraction would be 0.001256 / 125664 ≈ 1.000e-5. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 0.001256 divided by 125,664. Let me compute 0.001256 / 125664. Let's see, 125664 is approximately 1.25664e5. So 0.001256 is 1.256e-3. So 1.256e-3 / 1.25664e5 ≈ (1.256 / 1.25664) * 1e-8 ≈ approximately 0.999 * 1e-8, which is about 9.99e-9. So approximately 1e-8 of the light reaches the camera.

Wait, but that seems small. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the power of the lamp and the energy per photon, then find the total number of photons emitted, then find how many reach the camera.

Let me start by calculating the number of photons emitted by the lamp per second. The lamp's power is 120 W, which is 120 J/s. Each photon has energy E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 5893 Å = 5893e-10 m = 5.893e-7 m.

So E per photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (5.893e-7) = let's compute that.

First, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 5.893e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 5.893e-7 ≈ 3.37e-19 J per photon.

Now, the lamp emits 120 J every second, so the number of photons per second is Power divided by E per photon: 120 / 3.37e-19 ≈ let's see, 120 / 3.37e-19 ≈ 3.555e+20 photons per second.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by λ=5.893e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 5.893e-7 = (1.9878 / 5.893) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.337e-18 = 3.37e-19 J per photon. That seems right.

So 120 J/s divided by 3.37e-19 J/photon gives 120 / 3.37e-19 ≈ 3.555e+20 photons per second. So that's the total number of photons emitted by the lamp every second.

Now, since the exposure time is 1/100 seconds, the total number of photons emitted during that time is 3.555e20 * (1/100) = 3.555e18 photons in total.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if the lamp emits 3.555e20 photons per second, then in 1/100 seconds, it's 3.555e18, but that seems too high. Hmm. Let me check again.

Wait, 120 J/s divided by 3.37e-19 J/photon is indeed 3.555e20 photons per second. So 1/100 s: 3.555e18 photons emitted in total during exposure.

Now, how many of those reach the camera? Since the lamp emits light uniformly in all directions, the number of photons reaching the camera's area would be the fraction of the total area that the camera's aperture represents.

The total surface area of the sphere at 100 m is 4πr² = 4 * π * (100)^2 ≈ 125,663.7 m².

The area of the camera's aperture is π*(0.02 m)^2 = π*0.0004 ≈ 0.001256 m².

So the fraction is 0.001256 / 125,663.7 ≈ 1.000e-5 (if I approximate, but let me compute it more accurately).

Calculating 0.001256 / 125663.7: Let's see, 125663.7 is 1.256637e5. So 0.001256 is 1.256e-3.

So 1.256e-3 / 1.256637e5 = (1.256 / 1.256637) * 1e-8 ≈ approximately 0.999 * 1e-8, which is about 9.99e-9.

So the fraction is approximately 1e-8.

Therefore, the number of photons that reach the camera is total photons emitted multiplied by this fraction.

So 3.555e18 photons * 1e-8 = 3.555e10 photons.

Wait, but wait, that's 3.555e10 photons. Looking at the options, option G is 3.55 ×10^10, so that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the steps:

1. Energy per photon: E = hc/λ. Correct.
2. Number of photons per second: Power (W) divided by E per photon. Correct.
3. Exposure time: 1/100 s. So photons emitted during exposure: 3.555e20 * 0.01 = 3.555e18. That's correct.
4. Fraction reaching the camera: aperture area / sphere area. Correct.
5. Multiply total photons by fraction: 3.555e18 * 1e-8 = 3.555e10. So 3.55e10, which is option G.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the aperture area. Wait, the diameter is 4 cm, so radius is 2 cm, which is 0.02 meters. So area is π*(0.02)^2 = π*0.0004 ≈ 0.001256 m². Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the solid angle and consider the flux. Hmm, but I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: Calculate the intensity of the light at the camera's position, then find the power entering the aperture, then convert to photons.

Let me try that approach to verify.

The intensity (power per unit area) at the camera's position is the total power of the lamp divided by the area of the sphere. So I = P / (4πr²) = 120 W / (4π*(100)^2) ≈ 120 / (125663.7) ≈ 9.549e-4 W/m².

The power entering the camera's aperture is I multiplied by the area of the aperture: P_entered = I * A = 9.549e-4 W/m² * 0.001256 m² ≈ 1.20e-6 W.

Then, the energy per photon is E = hc/λ ≈ 3.37e-19 J. The number of photons per second would be P_entered / E = (1.20e-6 J/s) / (3.37e-19 J/photon) ≈ 3.555e12 photons per second.

Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than before. Wait, no, wait, that's per second. But the exposure time is 1/100 seconds, so the number of photons is 3.555e12 * 0.01 = 3.555e10 photons. Oh, same as before. So that confirms the same result.

So the answer should be 3.55e10, which is option G.

To determine the number of photons entering the camera during the exposure, we start by calculating the total number of photons emitted by the sodium lamp per second. The lamp's power is 120 W, and each photon's energy is given by \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 5893 \, \text{Å} = 5.893 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). 

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{5.893 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 3.37 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/photon}.
\]

The number of photons emitted per second is:

\[
\text{Photons per second} = \frac{\text{Power}}{E} = \frac{120}{3.37 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.555 \times 10^{20} \, \text{photons/second}.
\]

Over an exposure time of \( \frac{1}{100} \, \text{s} \), the total photons emitted are:

\[
\text{Total photons} = 3.555 \times 10^{20} \times \frac{1}{100} = 3.555 \times 10^{18} \, \text{photons}.
\]

Next, we calculate the fraction of these photons that reach the camera. The lamp's light spreads over a sphere of radius 100 m, with a surface area \( 4\pi r^2 = 4\pi (100)^2 \approx 125,664 \, \text{m}^2 \). The camera's aperture area is \( \pi (0.02)^2 \approx 0.001256 \, \text{m}^2 \). The fraction is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{0.001256}{125,664} \approx 9.99 \times 10^{-9}.
\]

The number of photons entering the camera is:

\[
\text{Photons entering} = 3.555 \times 10^{18} \times 9.99 \times 10^{-9} \approx 3.55 \times 10^{10} \, \text{photons}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **G: 3.55 × 10¹⁰ photons**.
