Question:

If we have a list of tabular values represented by a one-dimensionalar-ray, then the first differences of the list areformed by subtracting each element except the last [sincenothing follows the last element] from the element immediatelyfollowing it. Suppose we have a one--dimensionalarray named X that contains 50 elements. Compute the 49 elements of another array named DX from DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I) I = 1,2,...,49. Write a program segment to perform this calculation.

Options:

A: DIMENSIONX(50), DX(49) DO 50 I = 1, 50 50DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I) STOP END
B: DIMENSION X(50) DIMENSION DX(50) DO 50 I = 1, 49 50 DX(I) = X(I + 2) - X(I) STOP END
C: DIMENSION X(50), DX(48) DO 50 I = 1, 48 50 DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I) STOP END
D: DIMENSION X(50), DX(49) FOR I = 1 TO 49 DX(I) = X(I) - X(I + 1) NEXT I STOP END
E: DIMENSIONX(50), DX(49) DO 50 I = 1, 49 50DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I) STOP END
F: DIMENSIONX(50), DX(50) DO 50 I = 1, 49 50DX(I) = X(I) - X(I+1) STOP END
G: DIMENSION X(50), DX(49) DO 50 I = 2, 50 50 DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I - 1) STOP END
H: DIMENSIONX(49), DX(50) DO 50 I = 1, 49 50DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I) STOP END
I: DIMENSION X(51), DX(49) DO 50 I = 1, 49 50 DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I) STOP END
J: DIMENSION X(50), DX(49) DO 50 I = 1, 48 50 DX(I) = X(I + 2) - X(I + 1) STOP END

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the first differences of a one-dimensional array. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem says that given an array X with 50 elements, I need to create another array DX with 49 elements. Each element DX(I) should be calculated as X(I+1) minus X(I) for I from 1 to 49. So, basically, for each consecutive pair in X, I subtract the current element from the next one and store that in DX.

Now, looking at the options, I'm trying to find the correct program segment. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: It defines X as 50 elements and DX as 49. The loop runs from 1 to 50, which is a problem because for I=50, I+1 would be 51, which is beyond X's size. So this can't be right.

Option B: X is 50, DX is 50. But the loop is from 1 to 49, and DX is accessed up to 49. However, the computation is X(I+2) - X(I), which is the second difference, not the first. So this is incorrect.

Option C: DX is dimensioned as 48, but we need 49 elements. So this is wrong.

Option D: The loop goes from 1 to 49, and DX(I) is X(I) - X(I+1), which is the negative of what we need. So it's subtracting in the wrong order. DX should be X(I+1) - X(I), not the other way around.

Option E: X is 50, DX is 49. The loop runs from 1 to 49, and the calculation is correct: X(I+1) - X(I). This looks right.

Option F: DX is 50 elements, but we only need 49. Also, the calculation is X(I) - X(I+1), which is the negative of what's needed.

Option G: The loop starts at 2 and goes to 50, then stores DX(I-1). So for I=2, DX(1) is X(2)-X(1). That seems correct, but the problem is the dimensions. DX is dimensioned as 49, so this might be right. Wait, let me check. The loop runs I from 2 to 50, which is 49 iterations. DX is size 49, so it fits. And the calculation is correct. So this could be another correct option, but wait, the initial option E also seems correct. Hmm.

Option H: X is dimensioned as 49, but the original X has 50 elements. So this is wrong.

Option I: X is 51 elements, but the problem states X has 50. So this is incorrect.

Option J: The loop runs only to 48, so DX would have 48 elements, but we need 49. So this is wrong.

Now, between options E and G. Option E's loop is from 1 to 49, directly assigning DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). That's straightforward and correct.

Option G's approach is a bit more indirect. It loops from 2 to 50, computes X(I) - X(I-1), and stores it in DX(I-1). So for I=2, DX(1) is X(2)-X(1). For I=3, DX(2) is X(3)-X(2), etc. This also correctly fills DX with 49 elements. So both E and G seem correct, but wait, in the options, E and G have different dimension settings.

Wait, looking back: Option E's dimensions are X(50), DX(49), which is correct. The loop runs from 1 to 49, which is correct.

Option G's code also has X(50), DX(49). The loop runs from 2 to 50, which is 49 times, so it correctly populates DX. So both E and G seem correct, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in Option E, the loop is written as DO 50 I = 1, 49. But I'm not sure if the syntax is correct. The label 50 is used twice, which might be an issue if the DO and the statement are labeled the same. Typically, in FORTRAN, the DO statement and the corresponding END (or CONTINUE) are labeled with the same number. So Option E has DO 50 and then 50 DX(...). That's correct.

In Option G, the loop is DO 50 I = 2, 50, and inside, it's DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1). So for each I from 2 to 50, it's calculating the difference between X(I) and X(I-1) and storing it in DX at position I-1. So when I=2, it's DX(1)=X(2)-X(1). When I=50, it's DX(49)=X(50)-X(49). So this also correctly builds DX. So both E and G are correct in terms of computation, but I need to check the dimensioning and loop bounds.

Wait, in Option E, the loop is DO 50 I = 1,49. So I runs from 1 to 49, which is correct. Each iteration computes DX(I) = X(I+1)-X(I). So for I=49, it's X(50)-X(49), which is correct.

In Option G, the loop runs I from 2 to 50, which also gives 49 iterations. So both are correct.

But looking at the options, E and G are both present. However, in the problem statement, the correct approach is to loop from I=1 to 49 and assign DX(I) = X(I+1)-X(I). So Option E does exactly that.

Option G, while correct in computation, is a less direct approach. It's also correct but perhaps less straightforward.

Wait, but the question is to choose the correct program segment. Both E and G are correct, but looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct based on the options given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each option again.

Looking at Option E: It's dimensioned correctly, and the loop is correct.

Option G: It's dimensioned correctly, but the loop starts at 2 and ends at 50, which is also correct.

Wait, but in programming, sometimes the way the loop is structured matters. For instance, in FORTRAN, the indices must be within bounds. In E, when I=49, X(I+1) is X(50), which is valid. In G, when I=50, X(I) is X(50), and X(I-1)=X(49), which is also valid.

So both E and G are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is present. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, E and G are separate. So perhaps both are correct, but the problem expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option correctly captures the calculation as per the problem statement.

The problem says DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I) for I=1 to 49.

So Option E directly implements this.

Option G computes the same values but in a different order, using I from 2 to 50 and storing in DX(I-1). So it's effectively the same as E but with a different loop structure.

So both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is provided.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is:

E: DIMENSIONX(50), DX(49)
DO 50 I = 1, 49
50DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I)
STOP
END

And G is:

G: DIMENSION X(50), DX(49)
DO 50 I = 2, 50
50 DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I - 1)
STOP
END

Both are correct, but the problem asks to select the correct option. So perhaps both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, only one is intended.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, as it directly implements the formula given. G is another way but perhaps less straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and G are both correct, but in the given options, only E is present as correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is E and G are both correct, but in the options provided, perhaps only E is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct loop structure.

The problem states that DX has 49 elements, which is correct in both E and G.

But in the problem statement, the loop runs from I=1 to 49, which is exactly what E does.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct program segment must compute the first differences of the array X, which has 50 elements, into another array DX with 49 elements. Each element DX(I) is calculated as X(I+1) - X(I) for I from 1 to 49. 

Option E correctly initializes the dimensions of X and DX, loops from 1 to 49, and computes each DX(I) as required. Option G also computes the differences correctly but uses a different loop structure, which is valid but less straightforward. However, since the problem explicitly describes the loop running from I=1 to 49, Option E directly matches this description.
