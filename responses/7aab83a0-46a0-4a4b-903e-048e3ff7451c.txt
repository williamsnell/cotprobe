Question:

A woman was the owner of a farm in fee simple. Thewoman left the farm in 1986 to move to the city. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. The man's nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it during his uncle's absence. When the man returned from his mother's home in 1999, he continued in possession until 2010 when the womanbrought an ejectment action. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. The court would most likely hold that

Options:

A: the woman was the rightful owner and thus entitled to possess the farm.
B: the man's nephew was entitled to possession, as he was the one who took care of the farm during the man's absence.
C: the man was entitled to possession, because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.
D: the man was not entitled to possession, as he left the property for a year.
E: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man had not paid any property taxes.
F: the man was entitled to possession, because he had lived on the farm for over 20 years.
G: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's absence for a year interrupted the continuity of his possession.
H: the man was entitled to possession, because the woman had abandoned the farm.
I: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.
J: the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this adverse possession question. Let me start by understanding the scenario. 

There's a woman who owned a farm in fee simple, which means she owned it completely. She left the farm in 1986 to move to the city. Then, a man took possession in 1987 as an adverse possessor. He stayed there from 1987 to 1997, so that's 10 years. Then he left for a year to care for his sick mother and came back in 1999. 

When he returned, his nephew agreed to live there and take care of the farm while he was away. The man continued living there until 2010, when the woman brought an ejectment action. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. 

The question is whether the man, his nephew, or the woman is entitled to possession. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall how adverse possession works. Adverse possession requires that the possessor has been in continuous, open, notorious, hostile, and uninterrupted possession for the statutory period, which here is 20 years.

Let me break down the timeline:

- Woman leaves in 1986.
- Man takes possession in 1987, so from 1987 to 1997: that's 10 years.
- Then he leaves in 1997 for a year to care for his mother, so from 1997 to 1998.
- He comes back in 1999, so from 1999 to 2010, which is 11 years.

Wait, actually, from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, then he leaves in 1997 and comes back in 1999, so that's a two-year gap, not a one-year. Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check: 1987 to 1997 is 10 years (since 1997 is the end). Then he left in 1997, came back in 1999, so that's a two-year absence. Then he stayed until 2010, which is 11 years. So total time from 1987 to 2010 is 23 years, but with a two-year break.

Wait, the question says he left the property to care for his mother for one year, returning the following year, which would be 1999. So from 1997 to 1998, that's one year. Then he returns in 1999. So the absence was one year, not two.

So from 1987 to 1997: 10 years. Then 1997-1998: one year absence. Then 1999 to 2010: 11 years. So total time he was present is 21 years, but with a one-year absence. 

Now, the key is whether the absence breaks the continuity required for adverse possession. If the possession is interrupted, even for a short time, it can break the chain needed for adverse possession. 

In this case, the man left for a year, and during that time, his nephew took care of the farm. So the farm was still being occupied, but by the nephew. Does that count as the man's continued possession?

I think the rule is that adverse possession requires continuous possession by the same person or through someone in privity. If the man's absence was brief and the property was still under his control, perhaps via his nephew, then the continuity might not be broken. 

But in this case, the man was absent for a year, and the nephew was taking care of it. The nephew was acting on behalf of the man, so maybe the possession was still considered continuous. 

Also, the statutory period is 20 years. From 1987 to 2007 would be 20 years. But the man's possession continued until 2010, which is beyond that. But the issue is whether the one-year absence interrupts the period. 

If the absence breaks the chain, then the time after the absence would start anew. So from 1987 to 1997: 10 years. Then he leaves for a year, comes back in 1999, and stays until 2010. That's 11 years. So total time would be 10 + 11 = 21 years, but without the interruption, it's 21. But if the interruption breaks it, then the 11 years after 1999 wouldn't count towards the 20 needed. 

Wait, no, the statutory period is 20 years. So if the man's possession was interrupted, the time before and after the interruption would not count together. So he had 10 years before the interruption, then after the interruption, he had 11 years, but those don't add up because the interruption broke the continuity. 

But if the interruption was for a reason that's not his fault, like military service or something, sometimes courts allow it, but here it's just a year to care for his mother. I don't think that's a recognized exception. 

Alternatively, if the man's absence was brief, maybe less than a year, but here it's a year. So that's a significant absence. 

Moreover, during his absence, the nephew was taking care of the property. Does that count as the man's possession? Because the nephew was doing so at the man's request. So perhaps the possession was still considered continuous, as the man was still in control, even if he wasn't physically present. 

In some jurisdictions, if the possession is through a third party in privity with the adverse possessor, the time can still count. So if the nephew's possession was under the direction of the man, then the time the nephew was there could count towards the man's adverse possession. 

In this case, the nephew agreed to live there and take care of it during the man's absence. So the nephew was acting on behalf of the man. Therefore, the man's possession was not interrupted because the property was still under his control, even through his nephew. 

So the total time from 1987 to 2010 is 23 years. But the statutory period is 20 years, so even if there was a one-year absence, if the possession is considered continuous through the nephew, then the man would have satisfied the 20-year period. 

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says the man is entitled because of privity between him and his nephew, aiding the statutory period. So that's possible.

Option F says he's entitled because he lived for over 20 years. From 1987 to 2010 is 23 years, but with a one-year absence. So without considering the privity, maybe he didn't meet the continuous period. But with privity, the time during the nephew's possession would count.

Option J says the man was entitled because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile for the statutory period. But if the absence breaks continuity, then maybe not. But if privity allows the time to count, then J would be correct.

Wait, but the absence was a year, and the nephew was taking care. If the absence is a year, which is more than a temporary absence, perhaps it's enough to break the continuity. 

In some cases, a temporary absence, like a few months, doesn't break the continuity, but a year might. But it depends on the jurisdiction. 

If the man left for a year, and the nephew took over, but the man's intent was to return, then the possession might not be considered abandoned. But the key is whether the possession was continuous. 

Alternatively, if the man's absence was for a year, and he didn't return, then the nephew's possession might be considered as a new adverse possession, but since the nephew was acting under the man's authority, perhaps it's still part of the same claim.

So, under the doctrine of privity, the time the nephew spent could count toward the man's adverse possession period. Therefore, the total time would be 20+ years, satisfying the statute.

Looking back at the options, option C says the man is entitled because of the privity between him and his nephew, which helped fulfill the statutory period. That seems correct.

But wait, another option is J, which says the man's possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required. But the issue is whether the one-year absence broke the continuity. If the absence broke it, then J would be incorrect because the period wasn't met. But if privity allowed the time to count, then C is correct.

Alternatively, if the absence was for a year, and the nephew's possession continued without the man being present, then maybe the man's possession was not continuous. So the time after the absence, from 1999 to 2010, is 11 years, but the statutory period is 20, so that wouldn't meet it. So the total time would be 10 years before the absence, then 11 after, but without the privity counting, so the total would be 21, but with a break, so only 11 years after, which is less than 20. Thus, the man wouldn't have met the 20-year period.

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. So if the man's possession was interrupted, he needs to have 20 years after the interruption. But from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, which is less than 20. So he didn't meet the period. Therefore, the woman would be entitled.

But that would make option A correct. But option C and J argue about privity and whether the period was met.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Adverse possession requires continuous possession without interruption. If the man left for a year, that's an interruption, so the time before and after don't count together. So he had 10 years before, and 11 after, but without the interruption, so total is 21, but the period needs to be 20 without interruption.

Wait no, the statutory period needs to be met without interruption. So if he had 10 years, then a year off, then 11, the 10 and 11 don't add up because of the interruption. So he only has 11 years after the interruption, which is less than 20. Therefore, he hasn't met the statutory period. So the woman would win.

But that would make option A correct. But wait, the man was in possession from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), then from 1999 to 2010 (11 years). If the interruption was a year, then the periods don't count together. So 10 + 11 = 21, but the law requires 20 without interruption. So he didn't meet it.

Alternatively, if the privity allows the nephew's time to count, then from 1987 to 1997 (10), then 1997-1998 (nephew's year), then 1999 to 2010 (11). So that's 10 + 1 + 11 = 22 years, which is over 20. So that would satisfy the period.

But the question is whether the nephew's possession during the man's absence counts as the man's possession due to privity. If so, then the total time is 22 years, meeting the 20-year requirement.

So in that case, the man would be entitled, so options C or J would be correct.

But I'm not sure if the nephew's year counts. The nephew was acting on behalf of the man, so the possession was still the man's, just through the nephew. So the time during the nephew's care would count.

Therefore, the man's total possession time would be from 1987 to 2010, with only a one-year absence where the nephew was taking care. So the total time is 23 years, but the statutory period is 20. So the man would have met the period.

So the man's possession was open, notorious, hostile, and continuous, with the nephew's help counting as his possession. Therefore, option J would be correct because it states that his possession was as required.

Wait, but option C says it's because of privity. Option J says the possession was open, etc., which includes the elements.

So which is correct? If the privity allows the time to count, then the man's possession was continuous, meeting the statutory period. So both C and J could be correct, but C is more about the privity aiding the period, while J is about the possession meeting the elements.

But the correct rule is that the adverse possessor must be in continuous possession. If the absence was for a year, then unless the possession was through someone in privity, the continuity is broken. If the nephew's possession counts as the man's, then the continuity isn't broken, and the period is met.

So the answer would be either C or J. Let me check the options again.

Option C: the man was entitled because of privity between him and his nephew, aiding the statutory period.

Option J: the man was entitled because his possession was open, etc.

I think the correct answer is J because the man's possession, including through the nephew, met the required elements, including continuity. The privity is part of why the continuity wasn't broken, but the main point is that the possession was continuous and met the 20-year period.

Alternatively, the absence of a year might have interrupted the continuity, so the periods before and after don't count together. So from 1987 to 1997: 10 years. Then from 1999 to 2010: 11 years. So the total is 21, but without the interruption, it's 21, which is more than 20, but the law requires the period to be without interruption. So if the man left for a year, the time after doesn't count towards the initial period.

Wait, no. The statutory period is 20 years of continuous possession. So if the man's possession was interrupted, he needs to have 20 years after the interruption. From 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, which is less than 20. So he didn't meet the period.

Therefore, the woman would be entitled, making option A correct.

But earlier I thought the privity might save it, but if the interruption breaks the period, then the privity during the absence doesn't count. So the man's possession was from 1987 to 1997, then he left, so the period before the interruption is 10 years. Then he comes back and has 11 years. So 10 + 11 = 21, but without the interruption, so he only has 11 years post-interruption, which isn't enough.

Therefore, the man hasn't met the 20-year period, so the woman wins. So option A is correct.

But I'm a bit confused because some jurisdictions allow for the time after the interruption to count if the interruption was brief. But a year is significant.

So the answer is A: the woman was the rightful owner and entitled to possession.
</think>

The woman owned the farm in fee simple and left it in 1986. The man took possession in 1987 as an adverse possessor, living there until 1997 (10 years). He then left for a year in 1997-1998 to care for his mother and returned in 1999, continuing his possession until 2010. During his absence, his nephew lived on the farm at his request. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.

Key considerations:
1. **Adverse Possession Requirements**: The man must have been in continuous, open, notorious, hostile, and uninterrupted possession for 20 years.
2. **The One-Year Absence**: The man's absence from 1997 to 1998 interrupts his possession. The time before and after the absence does not count together unless the interruption is brief or the possession continues through someone in privity.
3. **Nephew's Role**: The nephew's possession during the man's absence may count if there is privity (i.e., the nephew acted on behalf of the man). However, the interruption caused by the man's absence likely breaks the continuity required for adverse possession.
4. **Statutory Period**: From 1987 to 1997, the man had 10 years of possession. After his return in 1999, he had 11 years until 2010. However, the one-year absence interrupts the period, and the time after the interruption (11 years) is insufficient to meet the 20-year statutory period.

Conclusion: The man's possession was interrupted by his one-year absence, and the time after the interruption does not meet the 20-year requirement. Therefore, the woman, as the rightful owner, is entitled to possession.
