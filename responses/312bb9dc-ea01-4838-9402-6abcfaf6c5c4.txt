Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Simplify (2 + 5)^2 − 42. And I need to choose the correct answer from the options A to J. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when simplifying expressions with exponents, I should handle what's inside the parentheses first. So, 2 plus 5. Let me add those together. 2 + 5 is 7. So now, the expression becomes 7 squared minus 42.

Next, I need to calculate 7 squared. 7 times 7 is 49. So now the expression is 49 minus 42.

Subtracting 42 from 49. Hmm, 49 minus 40 would be 9, and then minus 2 more would be 7. So 49 - 42 equals 7.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2 + 5 is definitely 7. Then 7 squared is 49, right? Yes. Then subtracting 42 from 49, that's correct. 49 minus 42 is 7. So the answer should be 7.

Looking at the options, option C is 7. So I think that's the correct choice.

The expression simplifies as follows: (2 + 5) = 7, then 7² = 49, and 49 - 42 = 7. So the answer is C.

Answer: C
