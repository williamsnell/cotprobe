Question:

A spring is mounted horizontally, with its left end fixed. A spring balance attached to the free end and pulled toward the right indicates that the stretching force is proportional to the displacement, and a force of 6.0 N causes a displacement of 0.030 m. We replace the spring balance with a 0.50-kg glider, pull it 0.020 m to the right along a frictionless air track, and release it from rest. Find the period T of the resulting oscillation. (Unit: s)

E: 0.20

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spring and a glider. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. Alright, the setup is that there's a spring mounted horizontally, fixed on the left end. They used a spring balance to pull it to the right, and they noticed that the force is proportional to the displacement. Oh right, that's Hooke's Law, F equals k times x, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement.

The problem says that when a force of 6.0 N is applied, the displacement is 0.030 meters. So I can use that to find the spring constant k. Let me write that down: F = kx. So rearranging, k = F/x. Plugging in the numbers, k = 6.0 N / 0.030 m. Let me calculate that. 6 divided by 0.03 is the same as 6 times 100/3, which is 200. So k is 200 N/m. Got it.

Next part: they replace the spring balance with a 0.50-kg glider. So now, the glider is attached to the spring and pulled 0.020 m to the right along a frictionless air track. Then it's released from rest. I need to find the period T of the resulting oscillation.

Wait, right, the period of a mass-spring system is given by T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Since the track is frictionless, there's no damping, so simple harmonic motion applies.

So m is 0.50 kg, and k we found as 200 N/m. Let's plug those into the formula. T equals 2π times the square root of (0.50 / 200). Let me compute what's inside the square root first. 0.5 divided by 200 is 0.0025. The square root of 0.0025 is 0.05, because 0.05 squared is 0.0025. So now, T = 2π * 0.05.

Hmm, 2π is approximately 6.2832. Multiplying that by 0.05 gives... let's see, 6.2832 * 0.05 is 0.31416. So T is approximately 0.314 seconds. Looking at the options, the closest one is option G, which is 0.31. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 0.5 kg divided by 200 N/m is indeed 0.0025. Square root of 0.0025 is 0.05. Multiply by 2π: 2*3.1416 is about 6.2832. 6.2832 * 0.05 is 0.31416. So yeah, that's about 0.314 seconds, which rounds to 0.31. But wait, looking at the options, option G is 0.31, option I is 0.35, and option C is 0.37, which is a bit higher. Oh, but wait, what if I messed up the units or the numbers? Let me recheck once more.

Wait, k was 6 N / 0.03 m = 200 N/m. Then m is 0.5 kg. T=2π√(0.5/200) = 2π√(0.0025)=2π*0.05=0.314 s. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be option G, 0.31.
</think>

The period of oscillation for a mass-spring system is calculated using \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \). From the given data, the spring constant \( k \) is determined to be 200 N/m. Substituting \( m = 0.50 \, \text{kg} \) and \( k = 200 \, \text{N/m} \), the period is found to be approximately 0.314 seconds, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
