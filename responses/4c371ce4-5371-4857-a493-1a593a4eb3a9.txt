Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the rest mass of a particle when given its total energy and momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember it involves some equation from special relativity. Let me think.

Wait, the key equation here is the energy-momentum relation. Oh right, the equation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Where E is the total energy, p is the momentum, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. Since the units here are in GeV and GeV/c, maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for m without needing to plug in c explicitly.

Let me write that down. So, the equation is E squared equals (p squared times c squared) plus (m squared times c to the fourth). But in the units given, everything is in terms of GeV and GeV/c. Oh wait, when using natural units where c=1, the equation simplifies. So in those units, E² = p² + m². So m² = E² - p². That should make the calculation easier.

Given that E is 5.0 GeV and p is 4.9 GeV/c. Wait, but when using natural units, the c in GeV/c cancels out. So I can treat p as 4.9 GeV. So plugging in, m² = (5.0)^2 - (4.9)^2.

Let me compute that. 5 squared is 25, and 4.9 squared is... wait, 4.9 times 4.9. Let me calculate that. 4 times 4 is 16, 4 times 0.9 is 3.6, 0.9 times 4 is another 3.6, and 0.9 times 0.9 is 0.81. So adding up: (4+0.9)^2 = 4^2 + 2*4*0.9 + 0.9^2 = 16 + 7.2 + 0.81 = 24.01. So 4.9 squared is 24.01.

So m² = 25 - 24.01 = 0.99. Taking the square root of 0.99 gives approximately 0.995, which is almost 1. So the rest mass m is approximately 1 GeV/c².

Looking back at the options, option D is 1.0 GeV/c². So that's the answer. Let me just double-check my steps. Yeah, E² = p² + m². Calculated E and p correctly, subtracted, took the square root. Yep, that seems right.

The rest mass of the particle can be found using the energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \). In natural units where \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to \( E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \). Rearranging for \( m \), we get \( m = \sqrt{E^2 - p^2} \). Substituting \( E = 5.0 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( p = 4.9 \, \text{GeV}/c \), we calculate:

\[
m^2 = (5.0)^2 - (4.9)^2 = 25 - 24.01 = 0.99
\]

Taking the square root, \( m \approx \sqrt{0.99} \approx 0.995 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), which is approximately \( 1.0 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: 1.0 GeV/c²

The answer is D.
