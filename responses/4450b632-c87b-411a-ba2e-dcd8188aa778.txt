Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a 37-year-old woman who's been experiencing episodes of severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness in her hands and feet for three months. Her vital signs are normal, and physical exams didn't show any issues. They also checked her thyroid function and did an ECG, both of which came back normal. Now, the question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy from the given options.

First, I need to think about what could be causing these symptoms. She's healthy otherwise, so it's not something like a heart attack or thyroid issues, since those tests came back normal. The symptoms she's describing—severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness—could point to a few possibilities.

Anxiety disorders often present with symptoms like these. Palpitations can be a result of anxiety, as can the shortness of breath and numbness if it's related to panic attacks. But the numbness is a bit concerning because it could also be a sign of something else, like a neurological issue or even a panic attack causing peripheral issues.

Now, looking at the options, they're all various medications. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Haloperidol. That's a typical antipsychotic, used mainly for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. But the patient doesn't have any signs of psychosis, so this seems unlikely.

Option B: Risperidone. Another antipsychotic, used for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and sometimes as an adjunct for severe anxiety. But again, without signs of psychosis or mania, this might not be the first choice.

Option C: Paroxetine. That's an SSRI, which is commonly used for depression and anxiety disorders. It could help with the anxiety symptoms, but I should consider if it's the best fit here.

Option D: Methadone. Primarily used for opioid dependence and chronic pain. Doesn't seem to fit the symptoms described.

Option E: Diazepam. That's a benzodiazepine, often used for anxiety, panic attacks, and sometimes as a muscle relaxant. It's effective but has risks of dependence and isn't usually a first-line for long-term use.

Option F: Chlorpromazine. Another antipsychotic, used for schizophrenia and sometimes severe anxiety. But again, no signs of psychosis here.

Option G: Methylphenidate. A stimulant, used for ADHD and sometimes for narcolepsy. Doesn't seem related to anxiety symptoms.

Option H: Olanzapine. Another atypical antipsychotic, used for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and sometimes as an adjunct for severe anxiety. No indication of psychosis here.

Option I: Lithium carbonate. Used mainly for bipolar disorder, especially for mania. There's no evidence of mood swings or mania in the patient's history.

So, the main issue here seems to be anxiety. The symptoms like severe anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath could be indicative of panic disorder. Panic attacks often present with these somatic symptoms, sometimes mistaken for a heart attack. The numbness is a bit unusual but might be due to hyperventilation during a panic attack.

Between the options, benzodiazepines like diazepam (E) are effective for acute anxiety and panic attacks. However, they are not typically first-line for long-term treatment due to dependence risks. SSRIs like paroxetine (C) are often first-line for anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, because they have fewer immediate side effects and are safer for long-term use.

But wait, the patient has episodes, so maybe an SSRI would be better for prevention. Diazepam is more for acute relief. The question is asking for the most appropriate pharmacotherapy, so considering the duration, maybe an SSRI is more appropriate. However, sometimes in severe cases, especially if the episodes are frequent, a benzodiazepine might be used as a short-term adjunct.

Alternatively, another option is beta-blockers, but they aren't listed here. Since the options don't include them, I have to choose from the given choices.

Given that, the choices between C and E. Paroxetine is an SSRI, which is good for anxiety, while diazepam is a benzodiazepine for immediate relief but with dependency risks.

The patient has a 3-month history, so maybe the physician is considering long-term management. Therefore, an SSRI like paroxetine would be more appropriate as first-line treatment.

The patient presents with symptoms consistent with anxiety, including severe anxiety, palpitations, shortness of breath, and numbness. Given the normal thyroid function and ECG, the symptoms are likely related to an anxiety disorder, possibly panic attacks. Among the options, paroxetine (C) is an SSRI commonly used for anxiety disorders and is appropriate for long-term management. Diazepam (E), while effective for acute anxiety, carries risks of dependence and is not typically first-line for long-term treatment. Other options are not relevant to the patient's presentation. 

Answer: C
