Question:

Police officers received an anonymous tip that two men were selling cocaine from the back of a restaurant. The tipster stated to the police that the two men were both tall white men who were wearing jeans and black shirts, the uniform of the restaurant. The tipster also said that one of the men had red hair and was wearing a tan ball cap and the other man had black hair and was wearing a red ball cap. The police set up surveillance on the back of the restaurant and saw the two men make several hand- to-hand transactions. Upon receiving authority to make the arrest from their commanding officer, they waited for the two men to come out again. About two hours later, the two men came out again, this time with a woman. The officers arrested the two men and detained the woman to determine her involvement. The officers took the woman's purse without her consent and searched it for illegal narcotics. In her purse they found three grams of crack cocaine, digital scales, a small glass pipe used for inhaling crack cocaine, and a balloon of black tar heroin. The woman was then arrested on the various drug charges. The woman was thereafter prosecuted and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. She filed a motion to exclude the drugs and the paraphernalia from evidence. Her motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that she was involved in the drug transactions.
B: denied, because the search was justified, since she was about to leave the scene of the crime.
C: granted, because the woman was not given a chance to refuse the search of her purse.
D: granted, because the police violated her right to privacy by searching her purse without her consent.
E: denied, because the woman was in a public place where she had a reduced expectation of privacy.
F: denied, because the police were acting in the interest of public safety.
G: denied, because she was sufficiently close or proximate to the crime scene to justifi the warrantless search.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before conducting the search.
I: granted, because the police should have asked for her consent before searching her purse.
J: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of her purse.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a police search and whether evidence should be excluded. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Police get an anonymous tip about two men selling cocaine from a restaurant's back. The tip gives a detailed description of the men, their clothing, and even their hairstyles and hats. The police set up surveillance and see them making hand-to-hand transactions. After getting permission from their commander, they wait for the two men to come out again. Two hours later, the two men come out with a woman. The officers arrest the men and detain the woman to check her involvement. Then, they take her purse without consent and find drugs and paraphernalia. The woman is charged, and she's moving to exclude the evidence.

So, the issue is whether the search of her purse was legal, and whether the evidence should be excluded.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, searches without a warrant are generally prohibited unless there's an exception. So, let's think about the exceptions. There's the consent exception, the plain view exception, and others like hot pursuit or public safety.

In this case, the police didn't get a warrant. They took her purse without her consent. So, the first thing is whether they had consent. The question says they took the purse without her consent, so consent isn't the issue here. So options I and C might be about consent, but since she didn't consent, maybe those are out.

Next, was the search in plain view? Plain view requires that the police were lawfully in a position to view the item, it's immediately apparent that it's contraband, and the item's location allows for its seizure without a warrant. In this case, the police took the purse, so it's not like they were looking into the purse from a distance. They had to open it, so plain view probably doesn't apply here.

Another exception is if the person is arrested and the search is incident to the arrest. But the woman wasn't arrested yet when the purse was taken; she was being detained to determine her involvement. So, I'm not sure if that applies. The arrest happened after the search, so maybe not.

What about public safety? If there's a risk that evidence might be destroyed, but in this case, they had her purse, and it's not like she was about to throw the drugs away. Or maybe if she was a danger, but that's not indicated here.

Another exception is the so-called "plain feel" doctrine, but that's for when an officer pats someone down and feels something. That's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the police had probable cause to believe the purse contained contraband. But to search without a warrant, they need probable cause. However, probable cause usually requires a warrant unless an exception applies. So, without a warrant, unless an exception, it's illegal.

So, the woman's motion to exclude would argue that the search was illegal because it was without a warrant and there's no exception. The police didn't have her consent, so they couldn't search the purse. So the evidence found should be excluded.

Looking at the options:

A: Denied because of reasonable suspicion. But reasonable suspicion is lower than probable cause. For a search, they need probable cause, not just reasonable suspicion. So A is probably not correct.

B: Denied because the search was justified since she was about to leave. I'm not sure about this. The idea might be that she was leaving the scene of a crime, but I don't recall a specific exception for that. Maybe it's related to hot pursuit, but she wasn't fleeing; she was just there with the men. So B might not be the right reason.

C: Granted because she wasn't given a chance to refuse. But in this case, they took the purse without consent, so maybe this is about consent. But police can take a purse if they have probable cause, even without consent. So C might not be the main issue.

D: Granted because they violated her right to privacy. Well, the Fourth Amendment is about privacy, so if the search was without a warrant and no exception, then yes. So D could be a reason.

E: Denied because it's a public place. Public places have a reduced expectation of privacy, but that applies to whether they can be approached or stopped, not necessarily to searching a purse without consent. So E might not apply here.

F: Denied because of public safety. I don't see a direct link here; the situation doesn't indicate an immediate public safety risk that would justify the search.

G: Denied because she was near the crime scene. Proximity might not be enough on its own to justify a warrantless search unless there's another exception, like hot pursuit or incident to arrest.

H: Granted because no warrant. But the question is whether the warrant was needed. If an exception applies, the warrant isn't needed. So H might be correct if no exception applies.

I: Granted because they should have asked for consent. But they didn't have consent, but if they didn't have probable cause, then yes. But if they did have probable cause, they might not need consent. So I'm not sure.

J: Granted because no probable cause. So if the police didn't have probable cause to believe the purse contained contraband, then the search was illegal. But did they have probable cause? The tip was detailed, but it was about the two men. The woman was with them. The police observed the men making transactions, but did that give them probable cause to believe the woman was involved? Maybe not directly. The fact that she was with them when they came out after two hours, but without more, maybe not. So if they didn't have probable cause, then J would be correct.

Wait, but the officers arrested the two men. At that point, were they in the process of making an arrest, and could they search her? If they had probable cause to believe she was involved, maybe they could search her. But if not, then the search was illegal.

So the key is: did the police have probable cause to search her purse? The tip was about the two men, not the woman. They saw the men make transactions, but the woman was just there. Maybe she was a lookout, or maybe she was just a friend. Without more, I'm not sure if they had probable cause to search her purse. So if they didn't have probable cause, then J would be correct.

Alternatively, if the tip was reliable, maybe it gives them probable cause to believe that anyone with the men might be involved. But generally, an anonymous tip can be unreliable, but if it's detailed, maybe it's considered credible.

Wait, the tipster provided detailed info about the men, which matched their observations. So maybe the police had probable cause to believe the men were involved in drug sales. But not necessarily the woman. So unless the woman was acting in a way that gave them probable cause, like if she was seen handing drugs or money, then they can't just search her purse without a warrant or consent.

So, in this case, the police didn't have probable cause to search her purse because the tip was about the men, and the woman's presence alone doesn't give them probable cause. Therefore, the search was illegal, and the evidence should be excluded.

Looking back at the options, J says granted because police didn't have probable cause. So the motion would be granted because the search lacked probable cause.

The question revolves around whether the search of the woman's purse was legal under the Fourth Amendment. The police searched her purse without a warrant and without her consent, and the woman is challenging the admissibility of the evidence found. The key issue is whether the police had probable cause to justify the warrantless search.

The police had a detailed anonymous tip about two men selling cocaine, which matched their observations. However, the tip did not mention the woman, and there is no evidence indicating she was directly involved in the drug transactions. Without probable cause to believe the purse contained contraband or that the woman was involved in criminal activity, the search was illegal. Therefore, the evidence should be excluded.

The correct answer is:

J: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of her purse.

Answer: J
