Okay, so I've got this question about fiscal policy and how to remedy a recession. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that fiscal policy has to do with government spending and taxation. During a recession, the economy is probably not doing so well, maybe high unemployment, low GDP growth, and businesses might be struggling. So the government needs to step in to stimulate the economy.

From what I learned, there are two main tools: expansionary fiscal policy and contractionary fiscal policy. Expansionary is used during recessions to boost the economy, while contractionary is used during booms to cool things down and prevent inflation.

Expansionary fiscal policy usually involves increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes. By increasing spending, the government directly injects money into the economy, creating jobs and supporting businesses. Cutting taxes leaves people with more disposable income, which they can spend, thereby increasing demand and economic activity.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones fit this. The question is asking for the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession, so we're looking for expansionary measures.

Option A: Increase government spending and taxes. Wait, that's contradictory. Increasing taxes would take money out of the economy, which is contractionary. So this might not be right.

Option B: Reduce government spending and increase taxes. Both are contractionary. That would make things worse during a recession.

Option C: Increase taxes without changing spending. Again, increasing taxes is contractionary, so probably not the answer.

Option D: Maintain current levels. That's neutral, but during a recession, you need active policies, so maybe not the best choice.

Option E: Reduce spending and taxes. Cutting spending is contractionary, but cutting taxes is expansionary. Hmm, but cutting both might not be the right approach. I think during a recession, you want to increase spending and/or cut taxes, not reduce spending.

Option F: Reduce taxes without changing spending. So cutting taxes would leave people with more money, which is good. But if government spending isn't increased, maybe it's not as effective, but it's still better than doing nothing or contractionary steps.

Option G: Increase spending and reduce taxes. Oh, that's a double expansionary approach. Both actions would inject more money into the economy. That makes sense because increasing spending directly adds to aggregate demand, and cutting taxes increases disposable income, leading to higher consumption.

Option H: Decrease spending and increase taxes. That's contractionary, which would worsen the recession. So definitely not.

Option I: Increase spending without changing taxes. That's also expansionary, but maybe not as strong as combining both. But it's still a correct approach.

Option J: Reduce spending without changing taxes. That's contractionary on spending and neutral on taxes, which would be bad for a recession.

So, the options that make sense are G, I, and F. But which is the best?

Well, the most effective expansionary fiscal policy combines both increased spending and tax cuts because it boosts demand from both government and private sectors. So Option G seems the best. Alternatively, Option I is also correct if the focus is solely on increasing spending without touching taxes, but I think the ideal scenario is to do both.

Wait, but sometimes in practice, governments might choose one over the other based on political feasibility. But the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy, so both actions together are ideal.

So the answer should be G: increase government spending and reduce taxes.

The appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession involves increasing government spending and reducing taxes, as this combination boosts aggregate demand through both direct government spending and increased disposable income for individuals and businesses. 

Answer: G
