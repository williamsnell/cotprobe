Okay, so I have this question about the heat capacity of uranium. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says that the atomic heat is 26 J/mole and the heat capacity is 238 g/mole. I'm a bit confused about what each term means, but I'll try to break it down.

Wait, atomic heat... I think that refers to the molar specific heat. So, the molar specific heat capacity (usually denoted as C) is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree Celsius. So, in this case, it's 26 J/(mole·°C). 

But the question is asking for the heat capacity in J/(g·°C). Oh right, that's the specific heat capacity per gram. So I need to convert the molar value to the per gram basis.

The molar mass of uranium is given as 238 g/mole. So, to find the specific heat capacity per gram, I should divide the molar specific heat by the molar mass. That makes sense because if one mole (238 grams) has a heat capacity of 26 J/°C, then each gram would have a smaller value.

So the formula I should use is: specific heat (J/g°C) = molar specific heat (J/mol°C) / molar mass (g/mol).

Plugging in the numbers: 26 J/(mol·°C) divided by 238 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 26 divided by 238. Let's see, 238 goes into 26 about 0.109 times because 238 * 0.1 is 23.8, subtract that from 26 gives 2.2. 238 into 2.2 is about 0.009, so total around 0.109. 

Looking at the options, option A is 0.11, which is close. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. 26 divided by 238. Let's compute it more accurately. 238 x 0.1 is 23.8, which leaves 2.2. 2.2 / 238 is approximately 0.0092. So total is 0.1 + 0.0092 = 0.1092, which rounds to 0.11. Yep, that's correct.

The heat capacity of uranium is calculated by dividing the molar specific heat (26 J/(mole·°C)) by the molar mass (238 g/mol). This gives approximately 0.11 J/(g·°C), which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
