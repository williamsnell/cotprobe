Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of adults aged 18 and older who were obese as of 2016. The options given are A through J with various percentages. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I'll try to recall what I know.

First, I remember that obesity rates have been a significant public health issue in the United States, and they've been increasing over the years. From what I've heard, around a third of adults in the U.S. are considered obese. But wait, I think that's a bit high. Let me think again.

I recall that the term "obese" refers to a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. The BMI calculation is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. So, someone with a BMI of 30 is considered obese.

Now, I'm trying to remember the exact figure. I think the obesity rate in the U.S. for adults was around 36-39% in recent years. But the question is specifically about 2016. Let's see if I can pin that down.

I believe that in the early 2010s, the obesity rate was around 30-35%, and it has been increasing since then. So in 2016, it might have been a bit higher than 33%, perhaps close to 36%. Looking at the options, A is 39%, F is 33%, and J is 27%. Hmm.

Wait, I think I might be confusing the obesity rate with the overweight rate, which includes both overweight and obese individuals. The overweight rate is higher, but the question specifically asks about obesity.

Let me try to remember any specific reports or data from around 2016. The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics releases data on this. I think around that time, the obesity rate was approximately 36-37%. But the options don't have 36 or 37. The closest higher option is A:39%, and F is 33%.

Alternatively, maybe the data I'm recalling is from a slightly later year, like 2018 or 2019, where the rate was around 39%. But the question is about 2016. So perhaps the rate was a bit lower.

Wait, another angle: sometimes the data is reported as the percentage of adults with a BMI over 25, which includes both overweight and obese. But the question specifically says obese, so BMI over 30.

If I recall correctly, around 2016, the obesity rate in the U.S. was about 36.5%. Since the options don't have that exact number, I have to choose the closest one. The options are A:39%, F:33%. So 36.5 is closer to 39 than to 33, but maybe I'm off.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the data with the percentage of people who are overweight (including obesity). Let me clarify: the percentage of adults who are overweight (BMI 25+) is higher than those who are obese (BMI 30+). So if the question is about obese, it's the higher end.

I think in 2016, the obesity rate was approximately 36.5%, which would be closest to option A:39%, but that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the correct figure was around 33%, which would be F.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the data more precisely. Let me try to remember if any specific reports or articles I've read stated the obesity rate for 2016. I think the CDC's data from around that time indicated that about 36.9% of adults were obese. That rounds up to about 37%, but the options don't have that.

Looking at the options again: A is 39%, which is slightly higher than 37, but perhaps the data was a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's 33% because I'm confusing it with another figure.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the data is presented as the percentage of the population that is overweight (BMI 25+) which includes both overweight and obese. If the question were about that, the number would be higher, but since it's about obesity, it's just the BMI over 30.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to settle on the most likely answer. If the options are A:39%, F:33%, and the actual figure was around 36-37%, then the closest option is A:39%. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F:33%.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other sources. For example, in 2016, the World Health Organization reported that about 39% of adults in the U.S. were obese. Or was that for a different year?

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A:39%. I think I've heard that as of recent years, the obesity rate in the U.S. has surpassed 35%, and by 2016, it might have been around 39%. But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another angle: the question says "about what percentage," so it's looking for an approximate figure. If the actual figure was 36.9%, then 39% is a bit high, but perhaps it's the closest option.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with the percentage of children who are obese. No, the question is about adults.

Wait, I think I've read that in 2016, the obesity rate in the U.S. was approximately 36.5%, which is close to 37%. Since that's not an option, I have to choose between the given options. The closest higher option is A:39%, and the closest lower is F:33%.

Given that 36.5 is closer to 39 than to 33, I would lean towards A:39%. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate for 2016.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F:33%, but that seems lower than what I remember. Maybe I'm mixing up the data. I think I need to go with the best estimate.

The question asks for the percentage of adults aged 18 or older who were obese as of 2016. Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Based on the options provided, the closest estimate to the known data suggests that approximately 36-37% of adults in the U.S. were obese in 2016. While the exact figure isn't listed, the closest higher option is A:39%.

Answer: A
