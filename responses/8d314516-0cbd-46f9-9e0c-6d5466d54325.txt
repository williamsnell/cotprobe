Okay, so I have this problem about natural convection heat transfer from a horizontal plate. Let's see what I remember from my studies. The plate is 7 inches square, so each side is 7 inches. The surface temperature is 300°F, and the ambient air is 80°F. The question is asking for the rate of heat transfer.

First, I need to figure out whether the plate is heated or cooled. Since the plate's temperature is higher than the ambient air (300 vs. 80), it's a heated plate. Now, the plate is horizontal, so I need to determine if it's facing upward or downward. The problem says it's a horizontal plate, but it doesn't specify the orientation. Hmm, I think the default assumption might be that it's facing upward if not specified, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, looking at the empirical equations provided, there are different formulas for heated plates facing upward and downward.

Wait, the options for heated plates facing upward are given as h = 0.22(ΔT)^1/3 and h = 0.27(ΔT/L)^1/4. But wait, I think I'm mixing up the configurations. Let me look again: the first line says for heated horizontal plates facing upward, h is 0.22ΔT^1/3 and 0.27(ΔT/L)^1/4. Then for hasted plates facing downward, same as the first. Wait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check: the configuration says heated horizontal plates facing upward, h=0.22ΔT^1/3, and another equation h=0.27(ΔT/L)^1/4. Then, for hasted (maybe a typo for 'heated' facing downward), same as the first. Wait, maybe it's about whether it's facing up or down. Alternatively, perhaps the first applies to 2x10^7 to 3x10^10 ranges, and the second to 1e5 to 2e7.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the length scale L. Hmm, maybe L is the length of the plate, which is 7 inches. The plate is square, so both dimensions are 7 inches. So L is 7 inches. But wait, the formula for h uses ΔT divided by L. So I need to calculate ΔT first.

ΔT is the temperature difference between the plate and the ambient air. That's 300 - 80 = 220°F. Now, I need to determine which equation to use. The problem says it's in the turbulent region, as per the ranges given for X (which I think is the length scale, maybe the height or length of the plate). The ranges are: Turbulent region for X is 2e7 to 3e10, and laminar is 1e5 to 2e7.

Wait, but what is X here? Oh, wait, perhaps X is the plate's length or another characteristic length. Alternatively, maybe X is the height of the plate, but the plate is square, so maybe that's not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps X refers to the length in terms of the Grashof number calculation. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the plate is in the turbulent region because the temperature difference is high, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the Grashof number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Grashof number (Gr) is given by Gr = (gβΔT L^3)/ν². Here, g is acceleration due to gravity, β is the coefficient of thermal expansion, ν is kinematic viscosity. But I'm not sure about these values for air at 80°F. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the given empirical equations without calculating Gr.

Wait, the problem provides two equations for heated plates: h=0.22ΔT^{1/3} and h=0.27(ΔT/L)^{1/4}. Which one applies? It depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Since the ranges are given, let's see. The problem says for the turbulent region, X is between 2e7 and 3e10, and laminar is 1e5 to 2e7. So I need to find X and see which region it falls into.

Wait, but what is X in this context? Maybe X is the length scale. Let's think: for a horizontal plate, perhaps X is the length (L) of the plate, which is 7 inches. But 7 inches is 0.5833 feet, which is about 0.068 meters. Hmm, but that doesn't seem to fit into the X ranges given. Alternatively, perhaps X is the height (which for a horizontal plate is zero, but that doesn't make sense). Maybe X refers to the height of the boundary layer or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is the length of the plate in some dimensionless form. Wait, maybe X is the length of the plate (L) in the formula. Wait, the problem says "configuration equation" with ranges for X, so perhaps X is the length scale, like L.

Wait, the plate is 7 inches square, so L is 7 inches, which is 0.5833 feet or approximately 0.1473 meters. Wait, but 0.1473 meters is about 147.3 mm. Hmm, but the ranges given are for X in terms of 1e5 to 3e10. That seems way too large. Maybe X is in some other unit, perhaps inches? Let me calculate X in inches. 7 inches is 7. So 7 is way below 1e5 (which is 100,000). So according to the ranges, X is 7, which is way below 1e5, meaning it's in the laminar region. But wait, the problem says "empirical equations for natural convection from horizontal plates to room temperature air at atmospheric pressure. Configuration equation: Turbulent region X 2e7 - 3e10, Laminar X 1e5 - 2e7."

Wait, that can't be right because 7 is way below 1e5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding X. Alternatively, maybe X is the Grashof number. Let me try to calculate Gr.

For air, at 80°F, let's get the properties. The kinematic viscosity ν of air at 80°F is approximately 1.40 x 10^-4 ft²/s. The thermal expansion coefficient β for air is about 2.08 x 10^-4 per °F. The acceleration due to gravity g is 32.2 ft/s².

The Grashof number Gr is given by Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔT = 220°F.

Gr = (32.2 * 2.08e-4 * 220 * (0.5833 ft)^3) / (1.40e-4)^2.

First, calculate each part:

g = 32.2 ft/s²
β = 2.08e-4 /°F
ΔT = 220 °F
L = 0.5833 ft

Compute L^3: (0.5833)^3 ≈ 0.5833 * 0.5833 = 0.3402, then *0.5833 ≈ 0.1985 ft³.

Now, numerator: 32.2 * 2.08e-4 * 220 * 0.1985.

Let's compute step by step:

32.2 * 2.08e-4 = 32.2 * 0.000208 ≈ 0.0067056.

0.0067056 * 220 ≈ 1.4752.

1.4752 * 0.1985 ≈ 0.2934.

Denominator: (1.40e-4)^2 = (0.00014)^2 = 2.0e-8.

So Gr ≈ 0.2934 / 2.0e-8 ≈ 1.467e7.

Wait, that's about 14.67 million. Now, the ranges given in the problem: Turbulent region is X from 2e7 to 3e10, and laminar is 1e5 to 2e7. So Gr ≈1.467e7 is just below the turbulent range (since 1.467e7 is less than 2e7). So the flow is in the laminar region.

Wait, but according to the problem's configuration, the equations for the heated plate facing upward are:

- Turbulent: h = 0.22(ΔT)^{1/3}
- Laminar: h = 0.27(ΔT / L)^{1/4}

Since Gr is ~1.47e7, which is in the laminar range (1e5 to 2e7), I should use the laminar equation: h = 0.27 (ΔT / L)^{1/4}.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Grashof number for the transition from laminar to turbulent is around Gr ~ 1e7. So if Gr is 1.47e7, which is slightly above 1e7, but the problem's ranges say up to 2e7 for laminar. So maybe it's still in the laminar region. Alternatively, perhaps the cutoff is higher. But for now, I'll proceed with the laminar equation.

So, h = 0.27 * (ΔT / L)^{1/4}.

ΔT is 220°F, L is 7 inches. Wait, but in the formula, are the units in feet? Because the other properties were in ft and s. So I should convert L to feet. 7 inches = 7/12 ft ≈ 0.5833 ft.

So, ΔT / L = 220 / 0.5833 ≈ 377.27.

Now, take the fourth root of 377.27.

Let me compute that: 377.27^(1/4). Let's see, 4^4 is 256, 5^4 is 625. 377 is between those, so the fourth root is between 4 and 5. Let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 377.27^(0.25):

Well, 4^4 = 256, 4.4^4 = (4.4)^2=19.36; 19.36^2≈374.8. That's close to 377. So 4.4^4 ≈ 374.8. The actual value is a bit higher. Let's say approximately 4.41.

So, (377.27)^(1/4) ≈ 4.41.

Now, h = 0.27 * 4.41 ≈ 1.1907 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that's the heat transfer coefficient. Now, to find the rate of heat transfer, Q, we use Q = h * A * ΔT.

Wait, no, the formula for Q is h * A * ΔT, but wait, no. Actually, the formula is Q = h * A * (T_s - T_ambient). Here, A is the area of the plate, which is 7 in. by 7 in., so 49 in². But we need to convert that to square feet.

Since 1 ft = 12 in, 1 ft² = 144 in². So 49 in² = 49/144 ≈ 0.3403 ft².

So Q = h * A * ΔT.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is Q = h * A * (T_s - T_ambient). So h is in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), A in ft², and ΔT in °F. So yes, that would give Q in Btu/hr.

So, h ≈ 1.1907 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), A ≈ 0.3403 ft², ΔT = 220°F.

So Q = 1.1907 * 0.3403 * 220.

Calculate that step by step.

First, 1.1907 * 0.3403 ≈ 0.405.

Then, 0.405 * 220 ≈ 89.1 Btu/hr.

Wait, but none of the options are close to 89. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong equation. Let me check again. The problem states that for heated horizontal plates facing upward, in the laminar region, the formula is h = 0.27 (ΔT / L)^{1/4}.

Wait, but I think I messed up the units. Because in the formula, ΔT is in °F, but when using the equation, perhaps the units are in certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe L needs to be in meters or another unit. Wait, no, in the problem statement, the equations are provided as is, so perhaps the units are consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h. Let me recheck.

h = 0.27 * (220 / 0.5833)^(1/4).

220 / 0.5833 ≈ 377.27.

377.27^(1/4) ≈ 4.41.

h ≈ 0.27 * 4.41 ≈ 1.1907 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Yes, that seems right. Then Q = 1.1907 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 89.1 Btu/hr.

But the options are all around 5 to 15 Btu/hr. So something's wrong. Maybe I used the wrong equation.

Wait, perhaps the plate is cooled, but no, the plate is at 300°F, ambient is 80°F, so it's heated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the heated plate facing upward uses h = 0.22(ΔT)^{1/3} in the turbulent region, and h = 0.27(ΔT/L)^{1/4} in the laminar region. But earlier, I thought Gr was 1.47e7, which is in the laminar region (up to 2e7). So I used the laminar equation.

But perhaps I should check the Grashof number again. Let me recalculate Gr.

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

g = 32.2 ft/s².

β = 2.08e-4 /°F.

ΔT = 220°F.

L = 0.5833 ft.

ν = 1.40e-4 ft²/s.

Compute numerator: 32.2 * 2.08e-4 * 220 * (0.5833)^3.

32.2 * 2.08e-4 = 32.2 * 0.000208 = 0.0067056.

0.0067056 * 220 = 1.475232.

(0.5833)^3 ≈ 0.1985.

1.475232 * 0.1985 ≈ 0.2933.

Denominator: (1.40e-4)^2 = 1.96e-8.

So Gr = 0.2933 / 1.96e-8 ≈ 1.50e7.

Yes, that's about 15 million, which is just below the 2e7 threshold for the laminar region.

So I think I did it right. But then why is my Q so high compared to the options? Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for h is in a different unit. Let me check the units again.

The formula says h = 0.27 (ΔT / L)^{1/4}.

ΔT is in °F, L in ft. So (ΔT / L) is in °F/ft.

But when taking the fourth root, the units would be (°F/ft)^{1/4}, which doesn't make sense for h's units. So perhaps the formula is dimensionless, implying that L is in a specific unit, like meters or inches.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is intended for L in inches. Let me try that.

If L is 7 inches, then L = 7 in. Let's convert that to ft: 7/12 = 0.5833 ft, which is what I did before. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the formula is h = 0.27 (ΔT / L)^{1/4}, where ΔT is in °C and L is in meters. But the problem gives ΔT in °F, so perhaps I need to convert it to °C. Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. Let me try that.

ΔT in °C: 220°F is (220 - 32)*5/9 ≈ 104.44°C.

L in meters: 7 inches is 0.1778 meters.

So ΔT/L = 104.44 / 0.1778 ≈ 586.4.

Take the fourth root: 586.4^(1/4). Let's see, 4^4=256, 5^4=625. So 586.4 is just below 625, so the fourth root is approximately 4.93.

h = 0.27 * 4.93 ≈ 1.331 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that changes the result a bit, but let me compute Q again.

Q = h * A * ΔT.

h ≈ 1.331 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

A = 0.3403 ft².

ΔT = 220°F.

So Q = 1.331 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 1.331 * 74.866 ≈ 100 Btu/hr. Still way higher than the options.

Hmm, this doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the configuration. Let me look back at the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "heated horizontal plates facing upward" have two equations: h=0.22ΔT^1/3 and h=0.27(ΔT/L)^1/4. But perhaps these equations are for different length scales or different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses L in a different way. Maybe L is the height, but for a horizontal plate, that's zero. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is for a vertical plate, but the problem is about a horizontal plate. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula altogether. Looking back, the problem says "horizontal plates," so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, the options given are all in single digits, like 5.88, 6.88, etc. My calculation is way higher, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let's check the problem again. The problem says for heated horizontal plates facing upward, the equations are h=0.22ΔT^1/3 and h=0.27(ΔT/L)^1/4. But perhaps I should use the first equation when in the turbulent region and the second in the laminar.

Wait, Gr is ~1.5e7, which is just below 2e7, so in the laminar region. So I should use h=0.27(ΔT/L)^{1/4}.

But perhaps the formula is in a different unit system. Let me check the units again. Alternatively, maybe I should be using metric units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate h in W/(m²·K) and then convert to Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). Let me try that approach.

First, convert all units to metric.

ΔT = 300 - 80 = 220°F. To convert to °C: (220 - 32)*5/9 ≈ 104.44°C.

L = 7 inches = 0.1778 meters.

Air properties at 104.44°C:

But wait, room temperature is 80°F, which is about 26.67°C. The plate is at 300°F, which is much higher. But the formula might still be applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the English system.

Wait, perhaps the formula is intended for L in inches. Let me try that.

L = 7 inches.

So, ΔT / L = 220 / 7 ≈ 31.4286 °F/in.

Now, take the fourth root: 31.4286^(1/4). Let's see, 2^4=16, 3^4=81. So it's between 2 and 3. Let's compute it:

31.4286^(0.25). Let's approximate. 2.3^4 = (2.3)^2 =5.29; 5.29^2≈27.98. Close to 31.43. So maybe 2.35.

So (31.4286)^(1/4) ≈ 2.35.

Then, h = 0.27 * 2.35 ≈ 0.6345 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that's still in English units. Now, compute Q.

Q = h * A * ΔT.

A = 49 in² = 49/144 ≈ 0.3403 ft².

ΔT = 220°F.

So Q = 0.6345 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 0.6345 * 74.866 ≈ 47.45 Btu/hr.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check the problem again. It says for heated horizontal plates facing upward, the configuration equations are:

h = 0.22ΔT^1/3 and h = 0.27(ΔT/L)^1/4.

Wait, perhaps the first equation is for a different condition, like when X is in a different range. Alternatively, maybe I should use the first equation when the Grashof number is in the turbulent region.

Wait, but Gr is 1.5e7, which is in the laminar region. So I should use the second equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Grashof number calculation. Let me double-check.

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

g = 32.2 ft/s².

β = 2.08e-4 per °F.

ΔT = 220°F.

L = 7 inches = 0.5833 ft.

ν = 1.40e-4 ft²/s.

Compute numerator:

32.2 * 2.08e-4 = 32.2 * 0.000208 ≈ 0.0067056.

0.0067056 * 220 ≈ 1.4752.

L^3 = (0.5833)^3 ≈ 0.1985.

Multiply: 1.4752 * 0.1985 ≈ 0.2933.

Denominator: (1.40e-4)^2 = 1.96e-8.

Gr = 0.2933 / 1.96e-8 ≈ 1.50e7.

Yes, that's correct. So Gr is ~1.5e7, which is in the laminar region (1e5 to 2e7).

So I should use h = 0.27 (ΔT/L)^{1/4}.

But perhaps I'm miscalculating the (ΔT/L) part. Let's try using L in inches instead of feet.

L = 7 inches.

ΔT = 220°F.

So ΔT/L = 220 / 7 ≈ 31.4286°F/in.

Take the fourth root: 31.4286^(1/4) ≈ 2.35.

h = 0.27 * 2.35 ≈ 0.6345 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then, Q = h * A * ΔT.

A = 49 in² = 0.3403 ft².

So Q = 0.6345 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 47.45 Btu/hr.

Still not matching the options. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is h = 0.22 (ΔT)^{1/3} in the turbulent region, but I thought Gr was in the laminar region. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the plate is in the turbulent region despite Gr being 1.5e7. Let me try that.

If I use h = 0.22 (ΔT)^{1/3}.

ΔT = 220°F.

220^(1/3) ≈ 6.039.

h = 0.22 * 6.039 ≈ 1.3286 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q = 1.3286 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 1.3286 * 74.866 ≈ 99.5 Btu/hr.

Still way off. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the plate is cooled, but that doesn't make sense because the plate is hotter than the ambient.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is for a vertical plate. But the problem specifies a horizontal plate.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different orientation. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "heated horizontal plates facing upward h = 0.22ΔT^1/3 h = 0.27(ΔT/ L)^1/4 Hasted horizontal plates facing downward ... h = 0.12(ΔT/ L)^1/4 Cooled horizontal plates facing upward ... h = 0.12(ΔT/ L)^1/4 Cooled horizontal plates facing upward h = 0.22ΔT^1/3 h = 0.27(ΔT/ L)^1/4"

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and "Hasted" is supposed to be "Heated". So for heated plates facing upward, both equations are provided, but which one applies depends on the flow regime.

Wait, perhaps the first equation is for the turbulent region, and the second for laminar.

So, Gr is 1.5e7, which is in the laminar region. So I should use h = 0.27 (ΔT / L)^{1/4}.

But I'm getting a Q of about 47 Btu/hr, which isn't among the options. The options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the formula gives h in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), right? Because the problem is in English units.

But perhaps the formula is intended for different units. Alternatively, maybe the formula is in a different system, like metric, and I need to adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating A. Let me check: A is 7 inches by 7 inches, which is 49 in². Convert to ft²: 49 / 144 ≈ 0.3403 ft². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a plate facing downward, but the problem says it's facing upward. No, the problem says the plate is horizontal, but doesn't specify, so I assumed upward.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "heated horizontal plates facing upward" have h=0.22ΔT^1/3 and h=0.27(ΔT/L)^1/4. But perhaps the first equation is for a different length scale, like when X is in the turbulent region. Let me try using the first equation.

If I use h = 0.22 (ΔT)^{1/3}.

ΔT = 220°F.

220^(1/3) ≈ 6.039.

h ≈ 0.22 * 6.039 ≈ 1.3286 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q = 1.3286 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 99.5 Btu/hr.

Still way too high. The options are all single digits. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a plate with a different orientation. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the plate is cooled, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula altogether. Let me see if I can find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is h = 0.27 (ΔT)^{1/4} without dividing by L. Let me try that.

h = 0.27 * (220)^(1/4).

220^(1/4) is approximately 3.825.

So h = 0.27 * 3.825 ≈ 1.0328 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q = 1.0328 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 1.0328 * 74.866 ≈ 77.3 Btu/hr.

Still too high. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses L in meters. Let me try that.

L = 0.1778 meters.

ΔT = 220°F, which is 104.44°C.

So ΔT/L = 104.44 / 0.1778 ≈ 586.4.

Fourth root of 586.4 is about 4.93.

h = 0.27 * 4.93 ≈ 1.331 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Again, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says for heated horizontal plates facing upward, the configuration equations are:

h = 0.22ΔT^1/3 (turbulent region)

h = 0.27(ΔT / L)^1/4 (laminar region)

So, perhaps I should use the first equation if Gr is in the turbulent region. But Gr is 1.5e7, which is in the laminar region (since 2e7 is the start of turbulent). So I should use the second equation.

But that leads me to a Q of ~47 Btu/hr, which isn't an option. The options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a square plate with side length L, but I'm not accounting for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the formula for a different orientation, like a vertical plate, but the problem specifies horizontal.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is in a different unit system. Let me try converting everything to metric units.

Compute h using metric units.

ΔT = 220°F = 104.44°C.

L = 7 inches = 0.1778 meters.

Air properties at 25°C (room temperature, assuming ambient is 80°F=26.67°C, but the plate is at 300°F=148.89°C. Hmm, maybe properties are evaluated at (Ts + T_ambient)/2, but that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the convective heat transfer coefficient for natural convection from a horizontal plate at 300°F to air at 80°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a horizontal plate facing downward, but the problem says it's heated and facing upward.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is h = 0.22(ΔT)^{1/3}, which is for the turbulent region, but since Gr is 1.5e7, which is close to the transition, maybe it's considered turbulent. Let me try that.

h = 0.22 * (220)^(1/3) ≈ 0.22 * 6.039 ≈ 1.3286 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q = 1.3286 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 99.5 Btu/hr.

Still not matching the options. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach, like using the Nusselt number.

Wait, the Nusselt number for natural convection from a horizontal plate can be found using the formula:

Nu = 0.59 * (Gr·Pr)^(1/3) for laminar flow.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a horizontal plate, which might have a different Nu expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula h = 0.27(ΔT/L)^{1/4} without considering the Grashof number, just plugging in the numbers.

So, let's try that.

h = 0.27 * (220 / 0.5833)^(1/4).

220 / 0.5833 ≈ 377.27.

377.27^(1/4) ≈ 4.41.

h = 0.27 * 4.41 ≈ 1.1907 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Q = 1.1907 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 89.1 Btu/hr.

Still not matching the options. I'm missing something. Maybe the formula is intended for a different plate size.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the length in a different way. Let me think: for a horizontal plate, the characteristic length L is the height, but since it's horizontal, the height is zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps L is the length in the direction of flow, which for a horizontal plate, might be the width.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the plate is square, so both dimensions are the same, so L is 7 inches in both directions.

Wait, perhaps I should try using L in inches in the formula.

So, L = 7 inches.

ΔT / L = 220 / 7 ≈ 31.4286.

31.4286^(1/4) ≈ 2.35.

h = 0.27 * 2.35 ≈ 0.6345 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q = 0.6345 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 47.45 Btu/hr.

Still not matching any options. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula h = 0.22(ΔT)^{1/3} for a horizontal plate facing upward, regardless of the flow regime. Let me try that.

h = 0.22 * (220)^(1/3) ≈ 0.22 * 6.039 ≈ 1.3286 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Q = 1.3286 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 99.5 Btu/hr.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the surface area correctly. Wait, the plate is 7 inches square, so area is 49 in², which is 0.3403 ft². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for h is in a different unit, like W/(m²·K), and I need to convert it to Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Let me try that.

First, compute h using the metric formula.

h = 0.27 * (ΔT / L)^(1/4).

ΔT = 104.44°C (since 220°F is 104.44°C).

L = 0.1778 m.

ΔT / L = 104.44 / 0.1778 ≈ 586.4.

Fourth root: ~4.93.

h = 0.27 * 4.93 ≈ 1.331 W/(m²·K).

Now, convert W/(m²·K) to Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr.

1 m² = 10.7639 ft².

1 K = 1°C, but since we're using ΔT in °C, and 1°C = 1.8°F, so we need to adjust for that.

So, h (Btu/(hr·ft²·°F)) = h (W/m²·K) * 3.41214 / (10.7639 * 1.8).

Compute denominator: 10.7639 * 1.8 ≈ 19.375.

So, h ≈ 1.331 * 3.41214 / 19.375 ≈ (4.543) / 19.375 ≈ 0.2346 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, compute Q.

Q = h * A * ΔT.

h ≈ 0.2346 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

A = 0.3403 ft².

ΔT = 220°F.

So Q = 0.2346 * 0.3403 * 220 ≈ 0.2346 * 74.866 ≈ 17.56 Btu/hr.

Hmm, that's close to option B (13.88) and option E (8.88), but not exactly matching. Maybe my unit conversion was slightly off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me try using the formula h = 0.27 (ΔT / L)^{1/4} and see if I can get a Q that matches the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check: the formula is (ΔT / L)^{1/4}.

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps the correct answer is around 17.5 Btu/hr, but the closest option is B:13.88, or maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses L in a different way, like the width of the plate. Wait, maybe L is the width, which is 7 inches, but perhaps the formula expects L in a different unit.

Wait, perhaps I should try using L in inches without converting to feet.

So, L =7 inches.

ΔT = 220°F.

ΔT / L = 220 /7 ≈31.4286.

31.4286^(1/4) ≈2.35.

h =0.27 *2.35 ≈0.6345 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q=0.6345 *0.3403 *220≈47.45 Btu/hr.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula for a cooled plate, but that doesn't make sense because the plate is heated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use h=0.12(ΔT/L)^{1/4}, which is for cooled plates. Let me try that.

h=0.12*(220/0.5833)^(1/4)=0.12*4.41≈0.5292 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Q=0.5292 *0.3403 *220≈0.5292 *74.866≈39.6 Btu/hr.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula for a different plate orientation, like vertical. Let me check.

For a vertical plate, the formula is different, but the problem specifies a horizontal plate, so that's not applicable.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach or consider that I made a mistake in the Grashof number calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem assumes the flow is turbulent despite Gr being 1.5e7. Let me try using the turbulent formula.

h=0.22*(220)^(1/3)=0.22*6.039≈1.3286 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Q=1.3286 *0.3403 *220≈99.5 Btu/hr.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula for h is given in a different way, like h=0.22(ΔT)^{1/3} in the turbulent region, but the problem's options are much lower. Maybe I'm using the wrong exponent.

Wait, perhaps the formula is h=0.22*(ΔT)^{1/4}.

Let me try that.

h=0.22*(220)^(1/4)=0.22*3.825≈0.8415 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Q=0.8415 *0.3403 *220≈0.8415 *74.866≈63.05 Btu/hr.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is h=0.22*(ΔT)^{1/4}.

h=0.22*3.825≈0.8415.

Q=0.8415 *0.3403 *220≈63.05.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is h=0.22*(ΔT)^{1/4} for the laminar region. But that doesn't align with the problem statement.

I'm running out of options. Maybe the correct answer is option B:13.88 Btu/hr, but I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should select the closest option based on my earlier calculation of around 17.5 Btu/hr, which would be option B (13.88) or option J (11.88). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion when using the metric system. Let me recheck.

h in metric: 1.331 W/(m²·K).

Convert to Btu/(hr·ft²·°F):

1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr.

1 m² = 10.7639 ft².

1 K = 1°C, and 1°C = 1.8°F, so to convert ΔT from °C to °F, multiply by 1.8.

So, h = 1.331 * (3.41214) / (10.7639 * 1.8).

Calculate denominator: 10.7639 * 1.8 ≈ 19.375.

Numerator: 1.331 *3.41214≈4.543.

So h≈4.543 / 19.375≈0.2346 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q=0.2346 *0.3403 *220≈17.56 Btu/hr.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option B:13.88.

Alternatively, perhaps I should round 17.56 to the nearest option, but that's not exact. Maybe I made a mistake in the Grashof number calculation, leading to the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:13.88 Btu/hr, but I can't see how to get there. I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't find a match. Maybe I should select option B as the closest.

To determine the rate of heat transfer by natural convection from the surface of a horizontal, 7 in. square plate at 300°F to ambient air at 80°F, the following steps were taken:

1. **Identify the plate configuration**: The plate is heated (300°F > 80°F) and horizontal, facing upward. The empirical equations provided are:

   - Turbulent region: \( h = 0.22\Delta T^{1/3} \)
   - Laminar region: \( h = 0.27\left(\frac{\Delta T}{L}\right)^{1/4} \)

2. **Calculate the temperature difference**:  
   \[
   \Delta T = T_{\text{plate}} - T_{\text{ambient}} = 300 - 80 = 220°F
   \]

3. **Determine the flow regime**:  
   The Grashof number (\(Gr\)) was calculated to assess whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Using air properties at 80°F (\(g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2\), \(\beta = 2.08 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{°F}^{-1}\), \(\nu = 1.40 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}\)) and \(L = 7 \, \text{in} = 0.5833 \, \text{ft}\), the Grashof number was found to be approximately \(1.5 \times 10^7\). This places the flow in the **laminar region** (\(10^5 \leq Gr \leq 2 \times 10^7\)).

4. **Apply the laminar flow equation**:  
   Using \(h = 0.27\left(\frac{\Delta T}{L}\right)^{1/4}\):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta T}{L} = \frac{220}{0.5833} \approx 377.27
   \]
   \[
   \left(377.27\right)^{1/4} \approx 4.41
   \]
   \[
   h = 0.27 \times 4.41 \approx 1.1907 \, \text{Btu/(hr·ft}^2\text{·°F)}
   \]

5. **Calculate the heat transfer rate**:  
   The surface area of the plate is:
   \[
   A = 7 \, \text{in} \times 7 \, \text{in} = 49 \, \text{in}^2 = 0.3403 \, \text{ft}^2
   \]
   Using \(Q = h \cdot A \cdot \Delta T\):
   \[
   Q = 1.1907 \times 0.3403 \times 220 \approx 89.1 \, \text{Btu/hr}
   \]

6. **Adjust for discrepancies**:  
   The calculated value (\(89.1 \, \text{Btu/hr}\)) does not match the provided options. Reassessing the equations and unit conversions, the closest match to the expected result is **option B: 13.88 Btu/hr**, though the exact reasoning for this discrepancy remains unclear.

ANSWER: B
