Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what an auditor does regarding subsequent events. I remember that subsequent events are events that happen after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Auditors have to consider these because they might need to adjust the financial statements or disclose them.

The question is asking which procedure an auditor would perform related to subsequent events. Let's look at the options:

A: Perform a complete re-audit of the financial statements. Hmm, that seems too broad. I don't think an auditor would do a complete re-audit just for subsequent events. They might review certain parts, but not the whole thing again.

B: Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. That sounds plausible. Interim statements are after the balance sheet date, so comparing them could help spot changes or events that need attention.

C: Verify the client's tax returns for the previous year. I'm not sure. Tax returns are more about compliance and might not directly relate to subsequent events unless there's a material tax adjustment, but that's not the main focus here.

D: Test internal control activities that were previously reported as inadequate. Testing controls is part of the audit, but this seems more about ongoing controls rather than subsequent events. Unless the controls failed and led to events, but I'm not sure if this is the best answer.

E: Review the client's budget plans for the next fiscal year. Budgets are forward-looking, but subsequent events are about the period after the balance sheet. Reviewing budgets might not directly relate unless the budget shows significant changes, but I'm not certain.

F: Analyze the client's sales records for the first quarter of the new year. Sales records could show subsequent activity, but is analyzing them the procedure? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the most general approach.

G: Examine the client's payroll records for several months after the year end. Payroll records are ongoing, and any changes after the year end could be a subsequent event, like bonuses or severance. But would an auditor examine them? I think they might review certain key areas, but is this the best option?

Thinking back, the audit standards mention that after the balance sheet date, the auditor should perform certain procedures to identify any events that could affect the financial statements. This includes reviewing interim financial statements if available, because they can show changes that happened after the year end. So option B seems correct because comparing the latest interim statements would help the auditor spot any significant events or changes that need to be considered.

Other options either don't relate directly or are too specific or not the standard procedure. So I think B is the right answer.

The correct answer is B: Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. This procedure is relevant because it allows the auditor to identify any significant events or changes that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were finalized.

Answer: B
