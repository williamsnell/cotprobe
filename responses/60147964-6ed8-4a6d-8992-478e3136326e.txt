Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Mulholland's 1998 argument on how privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that privatization generally refers to the transfer of ownership of a company from the public sector to the private sector. This often involves selling state-owned enterprises to private investors. Now, the question is about how this affected the relationship between companies and their managers.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: The relationship became more formalized. Hmm, formalization in relationships could mean more structured contracts or defined roles. Privatization might lead to more formal agreements, especially if the company is now owned by private shareholders instead of the state. That seems plausible.

Option B: Ownership transferred from small shareholders to senior managers. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Privatization usually involves selling to private entities, which could be large shareholders or institutional investors, not necessarily transferring ownership to managers. I don't think senior managers would become the primary owners as a result of privatization.

Option C: The state had greater control over production processes. That doesn't make sense. Privatization is about reducing state involvement. If anything, the state would have less control, not more.

Option D: Managers became less accountable to shareholders. Well, after privatization, the company is now under private ownership, so managers would be more accountable to the new private shareholders, not less. So D might be the opposite of what happened.

Option E: Privatization led to an increase in the number of small shareholders. I'm not sure. Privatization can sometimes lead to more shares being available to the public, which might increase the number of small shareholders. But it's also possible that large institutions buy most of the shares, so this might not be the case.

Option F: Privatization led to a decrease in the number of employees. I think privatization can lead to changes in employment practices, possibly including layoffs or restructuring, but the question is about the relationship between companies and managers, not the number of employees. So F might not be directly related.

Option G: Flexibility was reduced by detailed daily worksheets. That seems a bit off. I'm not sure how detailed worksheets would be related to privatization. Maybe in some industries, but not a general outcome of privatization.

Option H: Employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment. This could make sense. In state-owned enterprises, employment might be more based on trust and seniority. After privatization, performance-based employment could become more common as the company focuses on efficiency and profitability.

Option I: Shift in power from managers to employees. That doesn't seem right. Privatization might actually give managers more autonomy if they're now under private ownership, but I'm not sure about power shifting to employees.

Option J: Role of managers remained unchanged. I doubt this. Privatization likely brings changes in how managers operate, so J is probably incorrect.

Now, going back to the options, the question is about the relationship between companies and managers. I think the key here is the change in accountability. Before privatization, in state-owned companies, managers might have reported to the government or a board, and their accountability was different. After privatization, managers would be more directly accountable to shareholders or the new owners. So looking at the options, which one reflects this change?

Option D says managers became less accountable to shareholders. Wait, that seems contradictory. If the company is privatized, it's more likely that managers become more accountable to the new private shareholders, not less. So maybe I misread the options.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. Option D says managers became less accountable to shareholders. If the company was state-owned, managers were accountable to the state. After privatization, they are accountable to private shareholders. So perhaps the accountability increased, not decreased. So D might not be correct.

Wait, but the options are about how the relationship changed. If the company was a state entity, managers might have had less direct accountability to shareholders because the state was the main owner. After privatization, the company has private shareholders, so managers are more directly accountable to them. So the change is that managers became more accountable, not less. But none of the options directly say that.

Looking again, the options don't have an option that says managers became more accountable to shareholders. So perhaps the closest is another option. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the relationship between companies and managers. Perhaps it's about the nature of their roles. In state-owned companies, managers might have had a certain level of autonomy or different reporting structures. After privatization, the structure might become more formalized, with clearer contracts and more defined roles.

So Option A says the relationship became more formalized. That could mean more structured contracts, clearer expectations, and possibly more accountability. That makes sense as a change brought by privatization.

Alternatively, Option H talks about performance-based employment, which could be a change in the relationship between management and employees, but the question is about companies and managers, not employees. So H might not be the best fit.

So between A and D, but considering that D seems to suggest less accountability, which might not be the case. So perhaps A is the correct answer because the relationship became more formalized with clearer roles and accountability after privatization.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If the company is privatized, does that mean the relationship becomes more formalized? Or does it become less formal because private companies might have more flexible structures?

Hmm, I think formalization can refer to the structure of the management. In state-owned companies, there might be more rigid structures, but after privatization, the structure might become more formal in terms of defined roles and responsibilities to the new owners. So A could be correct.

Alternatively, another angle: before privatization, the state might have had a more informal relationship with managers, perhaps with more paternalistic oversight. After privatization, the relationship becomes more formal, with clearer contracts and performance metrics. So A seems plausible.

I think I'll go with Option A: the relationship between companies and managers became more formalized.

The question asks how privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers according to Mulholland (1998). Privatization involves transferring ownership from the public sector to private investors, which often leads to changes in management structures and accountability. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests the relationship became more formalized. This could mean clearer roles and responsibilities, which aligns with the idea that privatization introduces structured contracts and defined expectations to meet the needs of private shareholders.
- **Option D** claims managers became less accountable to shareholders, but this is unlikely as privatization typically increases accountability to private owners.
- Other options either misrepresent the effects of privatization or focus on unrelated aspects like employment numbers or power shifts.

Considering the focus on the relationship between companies and managers, **Option A** best captures the change, as privatization likely led to a more formalized structure with defined roles and increased accountability.

**Answer: A**
