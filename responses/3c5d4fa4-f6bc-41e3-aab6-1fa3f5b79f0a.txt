Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly identifies a monopsonist. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that monopsony has to do with a single buyer in a market. Let me think about what a monopsonist is. Monopsony is the opposite of monopoly, right? So while a monopoly is a single seller, a monopsony is a single buyer. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, I should be looking for something that describes a single buyer. Let's go through each option:

Option A: A wage payment lower than the average revenue product of labor. Hmm, not sure about this. I think average revenue product is related to how much output a worker adds on average. But does that define a monopsonist? Maybe not directly.

Option B: Employment level lower than that of a competitive labor market. Monopsonists might pay lower wages because they're the only buyer, so maybe they can get away with paying less, leading to fewer people wanting to work, hence lower employment. But is this the defining characteristic? Or is it more about being the sole buyer?

Option C: A single buyer of labor services. Oh, wait, that sounds exactly like what a monopsonist is. If there's only one buyer, that's the monopsonist scenario.

Option D: Employment level greater than that of a competitive labor market. I think monopsonists might actually have lower employment because they can pay less, so this doesn't seem right. Plus, this is about employment levels, not the nature of the buyer.

Option E: A wage payment lower than the marginal revenue product of labor. Marginal revenue product is the additional revenue from hiring one more worker. In a competitive market, wages equal marginal revenue product. Monopsonists might pay less because they have to lower the wage when they hire more workers due to being the sole buyer. So this could be true, but is it the definition? Or is it a result?

Option F: A wage payment equal to that of a competitive labor market. No, because monopsonists have market power and can pay less, so this wouldn't be correct.

Option G: A wage payment higher than that of a competitive labor market. That doesn't make sense. Monopsonists are buyers with market power, so they can pay less, not more.

Option H: A multiple seller of labor services. Wait, sellers are workers. If there are multiple sellers, that's a competitive market, not a monopsonist. So H is about sellers, not buyers.

Option I: Employment level equal to that of a competitive labor market. I think monopsonists might have a different employment level because of the wage difference, so this might not be correct.

Option J: A single seller of labor services. Wait, no, sellers would be the workers. A monopsonist is a single buyer, not seller. So J is about sellers, which is the opposite of what we're looking for.

So going back, the key is that a monopsonist is a single buyer. So Option C says "A single buyer of labor services." That seems to fit perfectly. The other options are either about wages or employment levels, which are effects, not the definition.

The correct answer is C: A single buyer of labor services. This directly describes a monopsonist, who is the sole buyer in a market, distinguishing them from other market structures.
