B: The possible outcomes must all be numerical.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about discrete random variables, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true for all of them. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, the question is asking which of the options A to E is not a true statement for all discrete random variables. So I need to remember what defines a discrete random variable and then check each option against that.

I recall that a discrete random variable is one that can take on only a countable number of distinct values, like integers. Examples are things like the number of heads in coin flips or the number of defective items in a batch. Each outcome is separate and distinct, and probabilities are assigned to each possible outcome.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something called the empirical rule, which says that for normal distributions, about 68% are within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. But wait, does this apply to all distributions, or just normal (bell-shaped) ones? I think it's specifically for normal distributions. So if the random variable isn't normally distributed, this might not hold. Since the question is about all discrete random variables, which don't have to be normal, this statement might not always be true. So A could be the exception.

Option B: The possible outcomes must all be numerical.

Yes, random variables are always numerical. Whether discrete or continuous, they represent numerical outcomes. So B is definitely true. So B is not the answer.

Option C: The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive.

Mutually exclusive means that two outcomes can't happen at the same time. For a random variable, each outcome is a distinct value, so they can't overlap. For example, if you roll a die, you can't get both a 3 and a 4 on the same roll. So yes, the outcomes are mutually exclusive. So C is true.

Option D: The sum of all probabilities for all possible outcomes is always 1.

Yes, this is a fundamental rule. The total probability over all possible outcomes must equal 1. So D is definitely true. Not the answer.

Option E: The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability.

Yes, that's the definition of expected value. The mean is calculated exactly that way. So E is true.

So, going back to the options, A is the only one that might not be true for all discrete random variables because it relies on the distribution being approximately normal, which isn't a given. All other options are always true by definition of a discrete random variable.

The correct answer is **A** because the statement about 95% of outcomes within two standard deviations applies only to normal distributions, not all discrete random variables.

Answer: A
