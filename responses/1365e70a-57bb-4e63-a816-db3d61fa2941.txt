Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Lukianoff and Haidt's argument regarding the disinvitation of certain speakers. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Lukianoff and Haidt are known for their work on free speech on college campuses. I think they wrote a book called "The Coddling of the American Mind." In that, they discuss how colleges are becoming more restrictive in terms of speech, which they believe has negative consequences.

The question is asking what they argue about the disinvitation of speakers. So I need to recall what their stance is. From what I remember, they argue that this kind of censorship leads to various issues on campuses. They probably don't see it as a positive move because they're critical of the trend towards political correctness and speech restrictions.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

A: is a form of cognitive distortion. Cognitive distortion refers to errors in thinking. I'm not sure if they frame disinvitation as a cognitive distortion. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

B: will eventually lead to a decline in student enrollment. I don't recall them specifically linking disinvitation to enrollment numbers. They might talk about other effects, but enrollment decline is a specific outcome.

C: will encourage students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history. That sounds a bit abstract. Maybe, but not sure if this is their main point.

D: will lead to a decline in university reputation. Maybe, but again, not the main point I remember.

E: will only serve to promote intellectual homogeneity on college and universities. This rings a bell. They argue that restricting certain speakers leads to a more homogeneous environment, stifling diverse thought.

F: All of the above. If E is correct and others aren't, then F isn't the answer.

G: is an example of mental filtering. Mental filtering is focusing on the negative. Not sure if they use that term.

H: is a violation of the speaker's freedom of speech. They do discuss free speech, but the question is about the argument of disinvitation, not necessarily whether it's a violation.

I: is a proactive measure to safeguard students' mental health. I don't think this is their argument. They are more critical of such measures.

J: will foster a culture of intolerance and narrow-mindedness on campuses. This also sounds familiar. They likely argue that limiting speakers creates a more intolerant environment.

Wait, E and J both seem plausible. Let me think again. In their arguments, they focus on how restricting speech leads to intellectual homogeneity and also contributes to a more intolerant culture. But looking back, I think their main point is that disinvitation leads to a decline in diverse ideas, promoting homogeneity. So E might be the answer. However, J is also a possible consequence.

Wait, the question is about what Lukianoff and Haidt argue. I think in their work, they discuss both the promotion of homogeneity and the fostering of intolerance. But looking at the options, E says it will only promote homogeneity, which might be too strong. Alternatively, J says it fosters intolerance and narrow-mindedness, which is another key point they make.

Alternatively, perhaps both E and J are correct, but the options don't have an 'E and J' choice. So looking at the options, J seems to encapsulate the negative cultural impact they discuss.

Wait, but the correct answer according to the options is probably J. I think I remember them talking about how such practices lead to a culture of intolerance. So J is the right choice.

The answer is J.

The reasoning is that Lukianoff and Haidt argue that disinviting speakers fosters a culture of intolerance and narrow-mindedness on campuses, as it stifles diverse perspectives and promotes a more restrictive environment.
