Okay, so I've got this question about the paramyxovirus family and which member causes very serious croup. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that croup is a respiratory infection that affects children, causing symptoms like a barking cough and difficulty breathing. It's usually caused by viruses that affect the upper airways. I think the most common causes are parainfluenza viruses, but I'm not sure if that's the one they're asking about here.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

A: Meta pneumo virus – I'm not too familiar with this one. Maybe it's a newer or less common virus. I don't think it's the main cause of croup.

B: Measles – Measles is a paramyxovirus, but I think it's more associated with a rash and is quite serious, but does it cause croup? I'm not sure. I recall that measles can cause complications like pneumonia, but is croup a primary symptom? Maybe not the main cause.

C: Ebola – Wait, Ebola is a filovirus, not a paramyxovirus. So this option is probably incorrect because the question specifies paramyxovirus.

D: Nipah virus – I know Nipah is a paramyxovirus, but it's more associated with encephalitis and respiratory issues in outbreaks. I don't think it's a common cause of croup.

E: Newcastle disease virus – That's more of an avian virus, affecting birds, so probably not relevant here.

F: Mumps – Mumps is a paramyxovirus, but it's known for causing parotitis (swollen salivary glands). I don't think it's a major cause of croup, though it can cause respiratory issues.

G: Hendra – Another paramyxovirus, but I believe it's more associated with horses and can infect humans, causing severe respiratory issues. Not sure about croup specifically.

H: Parainfluenza – Yes, this rings a bell. Parainfluenza viruses are a group (like HPIV) that are a leading cause of croup, especially in kids. So this seems like a strong candidate.

I: Rabies – That's a lyssavirus, not paramyxovirus. So this is out.

J: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – RSV is another respiratory virus, but it's a pneumovirus, I think, or maybe in a different family. Wait, no, RSV is actually a member of the Pneumoviridae family, so not a paramyxovirus. So J is incorrect.

So, considering all this, H: Parainfluenza seems to be the correct answer because it's known for causing croup. Measles (B) is a paramyxovirus but I'm not certain it's the primary cause of croup. Parainfluenza is more directly linked. So I'll go with H.

The correct answer is H: Parainfluenza.

Answer: H
