Okay, I need to figure out the conclusion of the given argument. Let's break it down step by step.

The argument starts with the statement: "It is wrong for society to kill a murderer." Then it says, "This follows for the reason that if a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer." After that, it adds, "And a murderer is wrong in killing his victim."

So, the structure is like this:
1. Premise: It is wrong for society to kill a murderer.
2. Reason: If a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer.
3. Supporting fact: A murderer is wrong in killing his victim.

The conclusion should be the main point the argument is trying to make. The first statement is the conclusion because the rest are supporting it. The reason and the supporting fact are backing up why the first statement is true.

Looking at the options, option J is the same as the first statement. So the conclusion is J.
</think>

The argument concludes that it is wrong for society to kill a murderer. This is supported by the reasoning that if a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer, and it is indeed wrong for a murderer to kill.

Answer: J
