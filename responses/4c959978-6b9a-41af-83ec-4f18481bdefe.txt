Question:

Which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?


Options:

A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides
B: Protein digestion and absorption does not involve any brush-border enzymes.
C: Protein digestion only takes place in the stomach
D: The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters
E: Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum
F: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete amylase, this initiates the process of protein digestion
G: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion
H: Gastric digestion of all proteins is less efficient due to the grinding action of the antrum
I: All products of dietary protein digestion are absorbed by the same amino acid transporter
J: The products of protein digestion are only absorbed as di- or tripeptides

Okay, let's try to figure out which statement about protein digestion and absorption is correct. I remember from my biology class that proteins are broken down into smaller parts before they can be absorbed. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says the products of protein digestion can be absorbed as free amino acids or di- or tripeptides. I think that's right because I remember that after digestion, proteins are broken down into peptides, and these can be absorbed either as small chains or individual amino acids.

Option B claims that brush-border enzymes aren't involved. Wait, no, brush-border enzymes like peptidases are definitely part of the process in the small intestine. So B is incorrect.

Option C says protein digestion only happens in the stomach. That's wrong because the stomach starts it with pepsin, but the majority of digestion happens in the small intestine with enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Option D says the products use only one of 14 transporters. I don't think that's right because there are several different transporters for different amino acids, so it's unlikely they use just one.

Option E says gastric digestion is equally efficient because of the antrum's grinding. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. The antrum's churning does help, but I think the efficiency varies depending on the protein. So E might not be correct.

Option F says chief cells produce amylase. No, amylase is for carbohydrates. Chief cells produce pepsinogen, which becomes pepsin in the stomach. So F is wrong.

Option G says chief cells produce chymotrypsin, elastase, etc. No, those enzymes are produced by pancreatic cells, not the chief cells in the stomach. So G is incorrect.

Option H says digestion is less efficient due to antrum grinding. That doesn't make sense because the grinding is helpful, not harmful. So H is wrong.

Option I claims all products use the same transporter. No, different amino acids have different transporters, so I is incorrect.

Option J says products are only absorbed as di- or tripeptides. Wait, I thought some amino acids can be absorbed as free, so J is incorrect.

So the correct statement should be A. It correctly states that the products can be absorbed as free amino acids or small peptides.

The correct answer is:

**A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides**

This statement accurately reflects the process of protein digestion and absorption, where the small intestine absorbs amino acids and small peptide chains. 

**Answer: A**
