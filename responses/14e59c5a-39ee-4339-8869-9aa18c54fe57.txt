Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the volume of a solid. The base is a circular disk with radius 3. The cross-sections perpendicular to the base are isosceles right triangles, and their hypotenuse lies along the base. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with volumes with known cross-sections, the general approach is to integrate the area of the cross-sections along the axis perpendicular to the base. Since the base is a circle, I think the cross-sections are taken along the diameter, maybe from one end to the other. So, I should probably set up an integral from one end of the circle to the other.

Let me visualize this. The base is a circle of radius 3, so its diameter is 6. The cross-sections are perpendicular to this diameter, right? So each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with the hypotenuse along the diameter of the circle.

Wait, is the hypotenuse lying along the base? Yes, the problem says so. So the hypotenuse of each triangle is a segment along the diameter of the circle. That means the length of the hypotenuse varies depending on where we take the cross-section along the diameter.

Hmm, how does the hypotenuse length vary? Let's consider the circle equation. If I take the diameter along the x-axis from (-3,0) to (3,0), then at any point x along this diameter, the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse length equal to the distance from the center to that point? Wait, no. Wait, actually, maybe the hypotenuse is the entire diameter, but that can't be because the cross-sections are perpendicular to the diameter. I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Each cross-section is a triangle perpendicular to the diameter. So the hypotenuse of each triangle lies along the diameter, and the triangle extends outward from the diameter into the circle. So the hypotenuse length at each point x would be the width of the circle at that point, but wait, no. Wait, the circle is symmetric, so the width at any point x along the diameter is the height of the circle at that x, which is determined by the equation of the circle.

Wait, the equation of the circle is x² + y² = 3², so y = sqrt(9 - x²). But how does that relate to the cross-sections?

Wait, the cross-sections are perpendicular to the diameter, which we can take as the x-axis. So each cross-section at position x will be a triangle whose hypotenuse is along the x-axis, from some point a to another point b, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each cross-section is a vertical slice at position x, and the hypotenuse is the line along the x-axis, with length 2y, where y is the height of the circle at that point.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, which is the circular disk, and the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse along the base (the diameter). So, at each point along the diameter, the cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a segment of the diameter. So, for a given position x along the diameter (from -3 to 3), the hypotenuse length of the triangle would be the width of the circle at that point, which is 2y, where y is the height at that x.

Wait, but in a circle, the width perpendicular to the diameter at position x is 2y, yes. So the hypotenuse of each triangle would be 2y = 2*sqrt(9 - x²). Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal. Let me recall: in an isosceles right triangle, the legs are of length a, and the hypotenuse is a√2. So if the hypotenuse is h, then each leg is h / √2.

Wait, but in this case, the hypotenuse is the width of the circle at that point, which is 2y. So h = 2y = 2*sqrt(9 - x²). Then, each leg of the triangle is h / √2 = (2*sqrt(9 - x²)) / √2 = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - x²).

But wait, the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. But since it's an isosceles right triangle, both legs are equal, so area is (a^2)/2, where a is the length of each leg. Alternatively, since the hypotenuse is h, the area would be (h^2)/(2*2) = h²/4, because each leg is h/√2, and the area is (h/√2)^2 / 2 = (h²/2) / 2 = h²/4.

Wait, let me check that again. If the legs are each of length a, then the hypotenuse is a√2. So a = h / √2, where h is the hypotenuse. So the area is (a^2)/2 = (h² / 2) / 2 = h²/4. Yes, that's correct.

So the area A(x) at position x along the diameter is (h²)/4, where h is 2y = 2*sqrt(9 - x²). Therefore, A(x) = ( (2*sqrt(9 - x²))^2 ) / 4 = (4*(9 - x²)) / 4 = (36 - 4x²)/4 = 9 - x².

Wait, that simplifies nicely. So A(x) = 9 - x².

Now, to find the volume, I need to integrate A(x) along the diameter from x = -3 to x = 3. So the volume V is the integral from -3 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx.

Let me compute that integral.

The integral of 9 dx from -3 to 3 is 9*(3 - (-3)) = 9*6 = 54.

The integral of x² dx from -3 to 3 is (x³/3) evaluated from -3 to 3: (3³/3) - ((-3)^3/3) = (27/3) - (-27/3) = 9 + 9 = 18.

So the integral of (9 - x²) dx from -3 to 3 is 54 - 18 = 36.

Wait, so the volume is 36. Checking the options, option B is 36. So I think the answer is B.

The volume is calculated by integrating the area of the cross-sections, which are isosceles right triangles, along the diameter of the circular base. Each cross-section's hypotenuse is the width of the circle at a given point, determined by the circle's equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 9\). The area of each triangle is derived from the hypotenuse length, leading to the integral of \(9 - x^2\) from \(-3\) to \(3\), resulting in a volume of 36.
