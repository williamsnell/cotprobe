Okay, so I have to find the pH of a 0.2 M solution of formic acid, and the given K_a is 1.76 × 10^-4. Hmm, I remember that formic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. I think the first step is to set up the dissociation equation. 

Formic acid, HCOOH, dissociates into H+ and HCOO^- ions. So the equation should be HCOOH ⇌ H+ + HCOO^-. 

Since it's a weak acid, I can use the approximation that the change in concentration is small compared to the initial concentration. Let me set up an ICE table to organize the changes.

Initial concentrations:
[HCOOH] = 0.2 M
[H+] = 0 (well, actually, pure water has 1e-7, but since it's a weak acid, we can assume negligible contribution)
[HCOO^-] = 0

Change:
HCOOH decreases by x, so [HCOOH] becomes (0.2 - x)
[H+] increases by x, so [H+] = x
[HCOO^-] increases by x, so [HCOO^-] = x

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:
[HCOOH] = 0.2 - x
[H+] = x
[HCOO^-] = x

The K_a expression is [H+][HCOO^-] / [HCOOH] = 1.76e-4. Plugging in the equilibrium concentrations:

(x)(x) / (0.2 - x) = 1.76e-4

That simplifies to x² / (0.2 - x) = 1.76e-4.

Now, I need to solve for x. Since K_a is small, x should be much smaller than 0.2, so maybe I can approximate 0.2 - x ≈ 0.2. Let's try that.

So, x² / 0.2 ≈ 1.76e-4 → x² ≈ 1.76e-4 * 0.2 = 3.52e-5 → x ≈ sqrt(3.52e-5). Let me calculate that.

The square root of 3.52e-5 is approximately... Well, sqrt(3.52) is about 1.876, so 1.876e-2.5? Wait, no, wait: 3.52e-5 is 3.52 x 10^-5. The square root of 10^-5 is 10^-2.5, which is about 3.16e-3. So 1.876 * 3.16e-3 ≈ 5.94e-3. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 3.52e-5 is 0.0000352. Taking the square root: sqrt(0.0000352). Let me think. sqrt(3.52) is approximately 1.876, and sqrt(1e-5) is 0.003162. So 1.876 * 0.003162 ≈ 0.00594. So x ≈ 0.00594 M. Wait, that's about 5.94e-3 M.

But wait, I should check if the approximation holds. If x is 0.00594, then 0.2 - x is 0.19406, which is still close to 0.2, so the approximation is valid.

Now, [H+] is x, which is approximately 0.00594 M. The pH is -log[H+]. Let me calculate that.

log(0.00594) is the same as log(5.94e-3). log(5.94) is about 0.7735, so log(5.94e-3) = 0.7735 - 3 = -2.2265. So pH = -(-2.2265) = 2.2265. Rounding that gives pH ≈ 2.23.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.23. But wait, I should make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me double-check the square root. 0.00594 squared is approximately 3.528e-5, which matches the numerator. So yes, x is correct.

But wait, another approach: let's not approximate and solve the quadratic equation. So the equation is x²/(0.2 - x) = 1.76e-4. Multiply both sides by (0.2 - x): x² = 1.76e-4 (0.2 - x) → x² = 3.52e-5 - 1.76e-4 x.

Bring all terms to one side: x² + 1.76e-4 x - 3.52e-5 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=1.76e-4, c=-3.52e-5.

Compute discriminant: (1.76e-4)^2 + 4*1*(3.52e-5) = (3.0976e-8) + (1.408e-4) ≈ 1.408e-4.

Square root of discriminant ≈ sqrt(1.408e-4) ≈ 0.01186.

So x = [-1.76e-4 ± 0.01186]/2. Taking the positive root: (0.01186 - 0.000176)/2 ≈ (0.011684)/2 ≈ 0.005842, which is about 0.00584, so x≈0.00584 M, which aligns with our initial approximation of ~0.00594. So the approximation was good.

Thus, pH is -log(0.00584) ≈ 2.23. So option B is correct.

To determine the pH of a 0.2 M solution of formic acid (HCOOH) with a given \( K_a = 1.76 \times 10^{-4} \), we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{HCOOH} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{HCOO}^-
\]

Using an ICE table, the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{HCOOH}] = 0.2 - x\)
- \([\text{H}^+] = x\)
- \([\text{HCOO}^-] = x\)

The \( K_a \) expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{HCOO}^-]}{[\text{HCOOH}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.2 - x}
\]

Since \( K_a \) is small, we approximate \( 0.2 - x \approx 0.2 \), giving:

\[
x^2 \approx 1.76 \times 10^{-4} \times 0.2 = 3.52 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x \approx \sqrt{3.52 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.94 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, \([\text{H}^+] = x \approx 5.94 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\). The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+] = -\log(5.94 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.23
\]

Verifying with the quadratic equation confirms the approximation is valid. Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.23.
