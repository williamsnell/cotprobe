Okay, so I have this question about the maximum number of edges in a simple triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices. Hmm, I remember that planar graphs have certain constraints on the number of edges they can have. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I recall that for a planar graph, there's a formula that relates the number of vertices (v), edges (e), and faces (f). It's Euler's formula: v - e + f = 2. But since we're dealing with planar graphs, they must satisfy some conditions beyond that.

Wait, there's also Kuratowski's theorem, but I think that's more about planarity in terms of containing certain subgraphs, like K5 or K3,3. Maybe that's not directly relevant here because the question is about edges.

Oh right, there's the formula for the maximum number of edges in a planar graph. I think it's e ≤ 3v - 6 for planar graphs without any triangles, but wait, no, that's actually the general case. Or is it different when triangles are forbidden?

Wait, let me think. For a simple planar graph, the maximum number of edges without any triangles... Triangle-free means there are no cycles of length 3. So maybe the formula changes.

I remember that for planar graphs, there are different bounds depending on whether they have triangles or not. The standard formula for a planar graph without any triangles is e ≤ 2v - 4. Is that right? Or was that for something else?

Wait, no, I think that's another approach. Let me check. For a planar graph without triangles, the maximum number of edges is given by e ≤ 2v - 4. So if v is 30, then e would be 2*30 -4 = 56. But wait, looking at the options, H is 56. But wait, I thought the general planar graph without any restrictions has e ≤ 3v -6. So for 30 vertices, that would be 3*30 -6 = 84 edges. But that's the maximum for any planar graph, regardless of triangles.

But the question specifies a triangle-free graph, so maybe the maximum number of edges is less than 84. So which is it? The general formula is e ≤ 3v -6, but when triangles are forbidden, perhaps the maximum is lower.

Wait, I think I might be confusing the formula. Let me get this straight. There's a theorem by Euler and another by Ringel and Youngs, but maybe more straightforwardly, I should think about the relationship between edges and faces in a planar graph without triangles.

Another approach: in a planar graph, the number of edges can be related to the number of faces. For a planar graph without triangles, each face must be bounded by at least four edges. So, using the handshake lemma for planar graphs, we can say that 2e ≥ 4f, because each face has at least four edges, but each edge is shared by two faces. So that gives f ≤ e/2.

Substituting into Euler's formula: v - e + f = 2. Since f ≤ e/2, we can write v - e + (e/2) ≥ 2. Simplifying, v - e/2 ≥ 2 → e/2 ≤ v -2 → e ≤ 2(v -2). That gives e ≤ 2v -4.

So for v=30, e ≤ 2*30 -4 = 60 -4=56. So 56 edges. So the maximum would be 56, which is option H.

Wait, but another thought: wait, I thought the general planar graph without any restrictions is e ≤ 3v -6. So for 30 vertices, 3*30=90-6=84. So 84 edges. But that's when the graph can have any planar structure, including triangles. But since this graph is triangle-free, perhaps it can't reach 84 edges, so the maximum is lower, which would be 56.

But wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me make sure: the formula e ≤ 3v -6 applies to any planar graph, regardless of whether it contains triangles. But for triangle-free planar graphs, the maximum number of edges is actually higher than for those without any restriction? That can't be. No, wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because without triangles, the graph is more restricted, so the maximum number of edges should be lower than 84.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, e ≤ 2v -4, which for 30 vertices is 56 edges. So the maximum would be 56, which is option H.

But wait, I'm a bit uncertain because I've heard that for bipartite planar graphs, which are triangle-free, the maximum number of edges is 2v -4. So that's consistent with what I found earlier.

Wait, but another angle: perhaps the formula is different when the graph is not necessarily bipartite but just triangle-free. Let me check again.

In a planar graph, if there are no triangles, then each face must be a cycle of length at least 4. So each face contributes at least four edges, but each edge is shared by two faces, so 2e ≥ 4f → f ≤ e/2.

Using Euler's formula: v - e + f = 2 → f = e - v + 2.

But since f ≤ e/2, we have e - v +2 ≤ e/2 → e/2 - v +2 ≤ 0 → e ≤ 2v -4.

Yes, that's correct. So for 30 vertices, e ≤ 2*30 -4 =56. So the maximum number of edges is 56. So the answer is H:56.

The maximum number of edges in a simple triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices is determined using the formula for planar graphs without triangles. For such graphs, the maximum number of edges is given by \( e \leq 2v - 4 \), where \( v \) is the number of vertices. Substituting \( v = 30 \), we get \( e \leq 2(30) - 4 = 56 \). Therefore, the correct answer is H:56.

Answer: H
