Question:

Suppose that a certain software product has a mean time between failures of 10,000 hours and has a mean time to repair of 20 hours. If the product is used by 100 customers, what is its availability?

Options:

A: 90%
B: 97%
C: 100%
D: 75%
E: 85%
F: 99%
G: 80%
H: 95%
I: 98%
J: 99.80%

Okay, so I've got this question about software product availability. Hmm, availability... I remember that it's a measure of how much time a system is operational compared to the total time. It's usually expressed as a percentage, right? The formula I think is something like Availability = (Mean Time Between Failures) divided by (Mean Time Between Failures + Mean Time To Repair). Let me write that down: A = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR). 

The question says the mean time between failures (MTBF) is 10,000 hours. That means on average, the software doesn't fail every 10,000 hours. And the mean time to repair (MTTR) is 20 hours. So when it does fail, it takes about 20 hours to fix. 

So plugging those numbers into the formula: A = 10,000 / (10,000 + 20). Let's calculate the denominator first. 10,000 plus 20 is 10,020. So now it's 10,000 divided by 10,020. 

What's that value? Let me do the division. 10,000 divided by 10,020. Hmm, 10,000 รท 10,020. Well, 10,020 is just a bit more than 10,000, so the result will be just under 1, but as a decimal. Let me compute it: 10,000 รท 10,020 = approximately 0.9980. 

Wait, 0.9980 as a percentage is 99.8%. So the availability is 99.8%. Looking at the options, I see option J is 99.80%, which matches exactly. 

But wait, why is the number of customers 100? Oh, right, availability is a per-unit measure, so it doesn't depend on the number of customers. Whether 100 customers or 1, each unit's availability is the same. So the 100 customers part is probably just extra info to test if I get confused, but it doesn't affect the calculation. 

So yeah, the answer should be J: 99.80%.

The availability of the software product is calculated using the formula: Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR). With MTBF = 10,000 hours and MTTR = 20 hours, the availability is approximately 99.80%. The number of customers does not affect this calculation.

Answer: J
