Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the Fizeau toothed-wheel experiment. I remember that this experiment was used to measure the speed of light, right? Let me think about how it works.

So, the setup involves a toothed wheel with a certain number of teeth rotating at a specific speed. The light source is aimed at a mirror, and when the wheel rotates, it blocks the light. When the wheel's teeth align such that the light is just beginning to be blocked, that's when an eclipse is observed. 

The problem here has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's start with part (a).

Part (a) says: When the speed of the disk is 1500 rpm, an eclipse is first observed. The distance of the toothed wheel to the reflecting mirror is 4980 meters, and the wheel has 600 teeth. I need to find the velocity of light.

Hmm, I think the basic idea is that the time it takes for the light to make a round trip (to the mirror and back) must be equal to the time it takes for one tooth to pass a certain point, like the position where the light is emitted or detected. Because when the light starts its journey, the wheel is rotating, so by the time the light comes back, the wheel has turned a bit, and the next tooth is in the way, causing an eclipse.

Wait, no, actually, I think the first eclipse occurs when the light has traveled to the mirror and back, and during that time, the wheel has rotated such that a tooth has moved into the position where it blocks the light again. So the time for the light to go to the mirror and come back is equal to the time it takes for the wheel to rotate a distance corresponding to one tooth gap.

Wait, maybe more precisely, the light leaves the source, goes to the mirror, reflects back, and when it comes back, the wheel has rotated so that another tooth is blocking the path. So the total time taken for the light to make the round trip is equal to the time it takes for the wheel to rotate an angle such that a tooth moves into the blocking position.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me try to derive it.

Let’s denote:
- n = number of teeth on the wheel = 600
- d = distance from wheel to mirror = 4980 meters
- v = velocity of light (what we're trying to find)
- ω = angular speed of the wheel in revolutions per unit time. Since the speed is given in rpm (revolutions per minute), maybe it's better to convert it to revolutions per second.

Wait, no, the problem gives the speed as 1500 rpm, so let me see. The first eclipse occurs when the wheel is rotating at 1500 rpm. So the time for one full revolution is 60 seconds divided by 1500, which is 0.04 seconds per revolution. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, the time for one tooth to pass a point is the time it takes for the wheel to rotate by one tooth's angle. Since each tooth corresponds to an angle of 2π/n radians, the time for one tooth to pass is the time it takes for the wheel to rotate that angle.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The linear speed of the teeth can be calculated. The circumference of the wheel is the number of teeth times the distance between teeth, but maybe we don't need that. Alternatively, the linear speed of the teeth is the product of the angular speed (in rad/s) and the radius of the wheel. But wait, since the wheel has 600 teeth, the distance between each tooth along the circumference is (2πr)/600. But maybe without knowing the radius, we can relate the rotational speed to the linear speed of the teeth.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the time it takes for the light to make a round trip. Let's denote T as the time for the light to go to the mirror and back. So T = 2d / v.

During this time T, the wheel must have rotated by an angle θ such that a tooth has moved into the blocking position. The number of teeth that pass a point in time T is (ω * T) * n, but wait, no. Let me think: the angular speed ω in radians per second is (2π * rpm) / 60. So ω = (2π * 1500) / 60 = (2π * 25) = 50π radians per second.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check: 1500 rpm is 1500 revolutions per minute. So in one second, it's 1500/60 = 25 revolutions per second. Each revolution is 2π radians, so ω = 25 * 2π = 50π rad/s. Yes, that's correct.

So during time T, the wheel rotates by θ = ω * T radians. Now, the condition for an eclipse is that the light has gone to the mirror and back, so the time T is such that the wheel has rotated an integer number of tooth spacings. Wait, but perhaps more precisely, for the light to just begin to be eclipsed again, the rotation during time T would have moved one tooth into the position where it blocks the light. So the rotation angle θ must be equal to the angle between two adjacent teeth, which is 2π/n.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if θ is 2π/n, then T would be (2π/n)/ω. But let me think again. When the light leaves the source, the wheel is blocking it, so the light goes out, reflects, and comes back. By the time it comes back, the wheel has rotated so that the next tooth is in the same position to block the light again. So the rotation during time T must be such that the wheel has rotated one full tooth's worth of angle, which is 2π/n radians.

So θ = 2π/n.

So T = θ / ω = (2π/n) / ω.

But T is also equal to 2d / v.

So setting these equal: 2d / v = (2π/n) / ω.

Let me write that equation:

2d / v = (2π) / (n ω).

We can solve for v:

v = (2d * n ω) / (2π) )= (d n ω) / π.

Wait, because the 2's cancel out. So v = (d n ω) / π.

Now, substituting the known values:

d = 4980 meters,

n = 600,

ω = 50π rad/s (from earlier calculation, since ω = 25 * 2π = 50π).

So substituting:

v = (4980 * 600 * 50π) / π.

Wait, the π in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So:

v = 4980 * 600 * 50.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 4980 * 600 = ?

Well, 4980 * 600 = 4980 * 6 * 100 = (4980 * 6) * 100.

4980 * 6: 4000*6=24000, 900*6=5400, 80*6=480, 0*6=0. So 24000 + 5400 = 29400 + 480 = 29880. So 29880 * 100 = 2,988,000.

Then multiply by 50: 2,988,000 * 50 = ?

2,988,000 * 50 = 2,988,000 * 5 * 10 = 14,940,000 * 10 = 149,400,000 m/s.

Wait, that's 1.494 × 10^8 m/s. Hmm. Looking at the options, option B is 1.488 × 10^8 m/s, and option E is 1.988 × 10^8 m/s. Hmm, close but not exactly matching. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the ω calculation. The wheel is rotating at 1500 rpm, which is 1500 revolutions per minute. So in one second, that's 1500/60 = 25 revolutions per second. Each revolution is 2π radians, so ω = 25 * 2π = 50π rad/s. That's correct.

So v = (4980 * 600 * 50π) / π = 4980 * 600 * 50.

Wait, 4980 * 600: Let me calculate that again. 4980 * 600. 4980 * 6 is 29,880, then multiply by 100 gives 2,988,000. Then 2,988,000 * 50 is 149,400,000 m/s. 149.4 million m/s.

But the known value for the speed of light is approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s. So this calculation gives 1.494 × 10^8 m/s, which is about half the actual speed. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again about the setup.

In the Fizeau experiment, the light travels from the source, reflects off the mirror, and returns. The time taken is T = 2d / v.

During this time T, the wheel must have rotated such that a tooth has moved into the position to block the light again. So, the number of teeth that pass a point during time T is (ω * T) / (2π) ) * n.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the rotation during time T must result in the wheel having moved one tooth's width. So, the distance moved by a tooth during time T is (ω * T) * r, where r is the radius of the wheel. But without knowing r, maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, the linear speed of the teeth is v_teeth = ω * r. But again, without r, perhaps we need to express it in terms of the number of teeth.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (θ), where θ is the angle per tooth. Wait, maybe I should look for the standard formula for the Fizeau experiment.

Wait, I think the formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (1 - (n * d * ω)/(c)), but no, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (some function), but I'm not recalling correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relative motion. The light is moving at speed v, and the wheel is rotating at angular speed ω. The effective speed of the teeth relative to the light is different.

Alternatively, the time for the light to go to the mirror and back is T = 2d / v.

In that time, the wheel rotates by an angle θ = ω * T.

For an eclipse to occur, the rotation θ must be such that the number of teeth passed is an integer, but perhaps more accurately, the rotation must have moved the wheel so that a tooth is now in the blocking position. So the angle θ must be equal to (number of teeth) * (2π / n). Wait, perhaps θ = (m) * (2π / n), where m is the number of teeth that have passed during time T. For the first eclipse, m would be 1, so θ = 2π / n.

So, θ = ω * T = 2π / n.

But T is 2d / v.

So substituting:

ω * (2d / v) ) = 2π / n.

Solving for v:

v = (ω * 2d * n) / (2π) ) = (ω * d * n) / π.

Ah, same formula as before. So plugging in the numbers again:

ω = 50π rad/s,

d = 4980 m,

n = 600.

v = (50π * 4980 * 600) / π = 50 * 4980 * 600.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because 50π * 4980 * 600 divided by π is 50 * 4980 * 600.

Wait, that's 50 * 4980 = 249,000. Then 249,000 * 600 = ?

249,000 * 600 = 249,000 * 6 * 100 = 1,494,000 * 100 = 149,400,000 m/s.

Which is 1.494e8 m/s. But the actual speed of light is about 2.998e8 m/s. So this value is about half of that. That suggests I might have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me re-examine the setup.

Oh wait, in the Fizeau experiment, the light beam passes between the teeth of the wheel, and when the wheel rotates, the teeth block the light. The first eclipse occurs when the light has gone to the mirror and back, and during that time, the wheel has rotated such that the next tooth is now blocking the beam. So perhaps the correct condition is that the time taken for the light's round trip is equal to the time it takes for one tooth to pass a point, which would mean θ = 2π/n.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So why is the result not matching the known speed?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be v = (n * d * ω) / (1 - (n * d * ω)/(c)) ), but that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (some factor), perhaps including the speed of light itself.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Doppler effect or relative motion. The light is moving towards the mirror at speed v, and the teeth are moving either towards or away from the light. So the effective speed between the light and the teeth would change.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the options given. The first part of the options for part (a) gives velocities around 1e8 to 4e8 m/s. The correct speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So perhaps the correct answer would have a velocity close to that.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.488e8 m/s, which is close to my calculated 1.494e8. But wait, the actual value is about 3e8, so perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the light's path is affected by the rotation of the wheel. Maybe the correct formula is different. Let me try to find the correct formula for the Fizeau experiment.

After a quick search in my mind, I recall that the formula used is v = (n * d * ω) / (1 - (n * d * ω)/(c)). But that seems a bit more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (some factor).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω * 2) / (something). Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the time for the light to go to the mirror and back is T = 2d / v. During this time, the wheel rotates by θ = ω * T radians. For an eclipse to occur, θ must be such that the number of teeth that have passed is an integer. So, θ = m * (2π/n), where m is an integer. For the first eclipse, m=1, so θ=2π/n.

Thus, ω * T = 2π/n.

But T = 2d / v.

So, substituting:

ω * (2d / v) ) = 2π / n.

Canceling the 2's:

ω * (d / v) ) = π / n.

Solving for v:

v = (ω * d * n) / π.

Which is the same as before. So the calculation gives v ≈ 1.494e8 m/s, which is close to option B's 1.488e8 m/s. But that's about half of the actual speed of light. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (something else). Let me try to think differently.

Wait, another approach: the time for the light to go to the mirror and back is T=2d/v.

During this time, the wheel makes ω*T rotations. For the light to be eclipsed again, the wheel must have made exactly one full rotation, so that the same tooth is back in position. Wait, but that would mean ω*T=1.

Wait, no, that can't be right because if the wheel makes one full rotation, the same tooth would be back, but the light has already traveled. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the time T is equal to the time it takes for one tooth to pass a point, which is (2π)/(nω). So T = (2π)/(nω). 

Wait, no, that would be the time for one tooth to pass a point. But in that case, T= (2π)/(nω) = (2π) / (600 * 50π) ) = (2π) / (30000π) )= 2/30000 = 1/15000 seconds.

Then, the distance the light would travel in that time is v*T = v*(1/15000) = 2d. So 2d = v*(1/15000). So v=2d *15000.

Wait, d is 4980 m, so 2d=9960 m. Multiply by 15000: 9960 *15000=149,400,000 m/s. Again, same as before. But that's only about 1.494e8 m/s, which is about half the actual speed of light.

That doesn't make sense because the actual speed is around 3e8 m/s. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the light is moving in the same direction as the rotating wheel, so the relative speed is v + v_teeth, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the light's path is affected by the rotation, so the effective speed is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think of the formula as v = (n * d * ω)/(something). Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (m), where m is the number of times the wheel has rotated during the light's round trip. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the light takes time T to go to the mirror and back, and during that time, the wheel rotates by an angle θ such that the number of teeth that have passed is equal to one. So θ = 2π/n.

Thus, θ = ω * T.

But T = 2d / v.

So ω*(2d/v) )= 2π/n.

Cancel 2: ω*d/v = π/n.

So v = (ω*d*n)/π.

Which again gives the same result.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that in the Fizeau experiment, the light reflects off the mirror, and the rotation of the wheel causes a phase shift, so the actual formula might involve a different factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be v = (n * d * ω)/(something else).

Wait, maybe I should consider the fact that the light has to pass by two teeth: one when going to the mirror and another when returning. So perhaps the angle θ is 2*(2π/n) = 4π/n. Let me try that.

So θ = 4π/n.

Then, ω*T = 4π/n.

T=2d/v.

So ω*(2d/v) )=4π/n.

Solving for v:

v= (ω * 2d *n)/(4π).

Simplify: v= (ω * d *n)/(2π).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

ω=50π,

d=4980,

n=600.

v= (50π *4980 *600)/(2π).

The π cancels out: (50 *4980 *600)/(2).

Which is (50 *4980 *600)/2.

50/2=25.

25 *4980 = 124,500.

124,500 *600=74,700,000 m/s. That's 7.47e7 m/s. That's way lower than the known speed, so that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the time it takes for the light to go to the mirror and back as T=2d/(v - v_teeth), where v_teeth is the linear speed of the teeth. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, the linear speed of the teeth is v_teeth = ω * r, where r is the radius of the wheel. But without knowing r, perhaps I can express it in terms of the number of teeth.

The circumference is 2πr = n * t, where t is the distance between adjacent teeth along the circumference. But without t, maybe this approach won't help.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (something else), but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that during the time T=2d/v, the wheel rotates by (ω T) revolutions, and for an eclipse to occur, the rotation must have caused the wheel to move by an integer number of teeth. So the number of teeth passed is ω T * n / (2π) ) = m, where m is integer.

So, (ω T * n )/(2π) )= m.

For the first eclipse, m=1.

So, (ω * (2d/v) *n )/(2π) )=1.

Simplify: (ω * n * d )/(π v) )=1.

So, v= (ω *n *d ) / π.

Which brings me back to the same formula as before, giving v=1.494e8 m/s.

But that's about half the known speed of light. So maybe I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the wheel must rotate by (m + 0.5) * (2π/n), meaning that the light catches up with the next tooth, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be v= (n * d * ω)/(something else), like 1 - (n*d*ω)/(c), but that seems more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. Since my calculation gives 1.494e8 m/s, the closest option is B: 1.488e8 m/s. So perhaps that's the intended answer for part (a).

Now, part (b) asks: At what speed must the disk be moving for a second eclipse to be observed?

Hmm, a second eclipse would occur when the wheel has rotated such that another tooth is in the blocking position. So perhaps the condition is that the rotation during time T results in the wheel having rotated an additional tooth's worth of angle.

Wait, but the first eclipse happens when m=1, the second when m=2, etc. So for the second eclipse, m=2.

So, using the same formula as before:

v= (ω *n*d ) / π.

But now, for the second eclipse, m=2. So the equation becomes:

(ω * (2d/v) *n )/(2π) )=2.

Which simplifies to (ω *n *d )/(π v) )=2.

So v= (ω *n *d )/(2 π).

Wait, but that would give a different velocity. But in this case, the velocity of light is a constant, so perhaps the approach is different.

Wait, no, the velocity v is the speed of light, which is a constant. So the rotation speed ω will change for the second eclipse. So perhaps for the second eclipse, the wheel must rotate faster so that during the same time T, more teeth have passed.

Wait, but the time T is still 2d/v, which is fixed because v is the speed of light. So the angular speed ω must be such that during time T, the wheel has rotated enough to cause the second eclipse.

Wait, for the first eclipse, m=1: θ=2π/n.

For the second eclipse, m=2: θ=4π/n.

So, θ=ω*T=4π/n.

But T=2d/v.

So, ω= (4π/n) / T = (4π/n) / (2d/v) )= (4π v)/(2 d n )= (2π v)/(d n).

Wait, but this is giving ω in terms of v, which is known. So:

ω= (2π v )/(d n).

But we can calculate ω for the first eclipse as well.

From first eclipse:

ω1= (2π v )/(d n).

We know that for the first eclipse, ω1=50π rad/s.

So, 50π = (2π v )/(d n).

Solving for v: v= (50π * d n )/(2π )= (50 * d n )/2.

Which brings us back to v= (50 *4980 *600)/2= (50*4980*600)/2.

Wait, that's the same as before, which gives v= 149,400,000 m/s, which is 1.494e8 m/s.

But for the second eclipse, m=2, so θ=4π/n.

So, ω2= (4π)/(n T )= (4π)/(n*(2d/v)) )= (4π v)/(2 d n )= (2π v)/(d n).

But since v is the same, ω2=2 * ω1.

Because ω1= (2π v)/(d n), so ω2=2*(2π v)/(d n )= 2ω1.

So ω2=2*50π=100π rad/s.

Converting 100π rad/s to rpm:

100π rad/s = (100π * 60)/(2π) ) rpm = (100 *60)/(2 ) ) rpm= (6000)/2=3000 rpm.

So for the second eclipse, the wheel must rotate at 3000 rpm.

Looking at the options, option D has 3000 rpm and velocity 2.488e8 m/s, but that's not matching our part (a) answer. Option I has 7500 rpm, which is higher than 3000. Option D is 3000 rpm.

Wait, but in part (a), our calculation gave v=1.494e8 m/s, which is close to option B's 1.488e8 m/s. But part (b) requires the speed for the second eclipse, which we calculated as 3000 rpm.

Looking at the options, option D says 2.488e8 m/s and 3000 rpm. But our part (a) calculation gave 1.494e8 m/s, which is closer to option B's velocity. So perhaps the correct option is B for part (a) and 3000 rpm for part (b), which would be option D. But wait, option D has velocity 2.488e8, which doesn't match our part (a) value.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the part (b) calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, for the second eclipse, the condition is that during time T=2d/v, the wheel rotates by θ=2*(2π/n)=4π/n.

So, θ=ω*T=4π/n.

So, ω= (4π/n) / T = (4π/n) / (2d/v) )= (4π v)/(2 d n )= (2π v)/(d n).

But since v is the same, ω is proportional to m. So for m=2, ω is twice that of m=1. So if ω1 is 50π rad/s for m=1, then ω2=100π rad/s.

Converting 100π rad/s to rpm:

100π rad/s * (60 sec/min) / (2π rad/rev) )= (100π *60)/(2π) )= (100*60)/(2)=3000 rpm.

So yes, part (b) speed is 3000 rpm.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.488e8 m/s and 3000 rpm. But our part (a) calculation gave 1.494e8 m/s, which is closer to option B's 1.488e8 m/s. So perhaps the correct choice is option B for part (a) and then the speed for part (b) is 3000 rpm, which would be option D. But option B's part (b) speed is 6500 rpm, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the condition for the second eclipse. Maybe the second eclipse occurs when the wheel has rotated by two teeth's worth of angle, which would be 2*(2π/n)=4π/n. So the same approach applies, leading to ω2=2ω1=100π rad/s=3000 rpm.

So, part (a) velocity is approximately 1.494e8 m/s, which is closest to option B: 1.488e8 m/s, and part (b) speed is 3000 rpm, which is option D's speed. But option D's velocity is 2.488e8 m/s, which doesn't match our part (a) calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (something else). Let me try using the formula from a reliable source.

Wait, after some thinking, I recall that the correct formula for the speed of light in the Fizeau experiment is given by:

v = (n * d * ω) / (1 - (n * d * ω)/(c)).

But that seems more complex and involves the speed of light on both sides, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (something), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula as v = (n * d * ω) / (something else). Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (some multiple), but without knowing the exact formula, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the options to find which one fits. Let's see, for part (a), option B is 1.488e8 m/s, which is close to my calculation of 1.494e8. So perhaps the correct answer is option B for part (a), and then for part (b), the speed would be 3000 rpm, which is option D's speed. But option B's part (b) speed is 6500 rpm, which doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the condition for the second eclipse. Maybe the second eclipse occurs when the wheel has rotated by (m + 1) teeth, so for m=2, it's three teeth? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the second eclipse occurs when the light has gone to the mirror and back, and the wheel has rotated by two teeth's worth of angle, leading to a higher ω.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests that for m=2, ω=2ω1=100π rad/s=3000 rpm.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D for part (b), but then part (a) would have a higher velocity, which doesn't match.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the initial calculation for part (a) as 1.494e8 m/s, which is closest to option B, and part (b) as 3000 rpm, which is option D's speed, but since option D's part (a) velocity is higher, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor I missed, leading to a higher velocity. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (some factor), perhaps involving the speed of light itself. Let me assume that the correct formula is v = (n * d * ω) / (k), where k is a factor.

If I take the known speed of light as 3e8 m/s, and plug in the numbers:

3e8 = (600 * 4980 * ω) / k.

But without knowing k, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the factor is 1 - (n*d*ω)/(c), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that my initial calculation gives 1.494e8 m/s and 3000 rpm, but since none of the options perfectly match, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a) and 3000 rpm for part (b), which would be option D. But option D's part (a) is 2.488e8, which is higher than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the time for the light to go to the mirror and back is T=2d/v.

During this time, the wheel rotates by (ω T) revolutions. For the first eclipse, the number of teeth that have passed is exactly one, so ω T = 1/600 revolutions.

Wait, because each revolution has 600 teeth, so to pass one tooth, the wheel must rotate 1/600 of a revolution.

So, ω T = 1/600.

But T=2d/v.

So, ω*(2d/v) )=1/600.

Solving for v:

v= ω * 2d * 600.

Now, ω is in rpm, so let me convert 1500 rpm to rad/s.

Wait, no, ω is in rpm, but I can use it directly in revolutions per second. So 1500 rpm is 25 revolutions per second (1500/60=25).

So, ω=25 rev/s.

Thus, v= 25 * 2 *4980 *600.

Calculating:

25 * 2=50.

50 *4980=249,000.

249,000 *600=149,400,000 m/s=1.494e8 m/s.

Same result as before.

So, part (a) is 1.494e8 m/s, part (b) is 3000 rpm.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.488e8 m/s and 6500 rpm, which doesn't match part (b). Option D is 2.488e8 m/s and 3000 rpm, which matches part (b) but not part (a). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second eclipse occurs when the wheel has rotated two teeth's worth, so the condition is ω T=2/600 rev.

So, ω T=2/600.

Thus, v= ω *2d *600 /2= ω *d *600.

With ω=25 rev/s,

v=25 *4980 *600=25 *2,988,000=74,700,000 m/s=7.47e7 m/s.

That's not matching any option for part (a). So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the intended answer is option B for part (a) and 3000 rpm for part (b), but since the options don't have that combination, perhaps the correct option is B and D, but that's not possible.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I has 7500 rpm, which is 2500 rev/min higher than 1500, but that doesn't fit with our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the condition for the second eclipse. Maybe the second eclipse occurs when the wheel has rotated enough so that two teeth have passed, which would require ω T=2/600 rev.

So, v= ω *2d *600 /2= ω*d*600.

With ω=25 rev/s,

v=25 *4980 *600=74,700,000 m/s=7.47e7 m/s. But that's not matching any option.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the initial calculation, part (a) is approximately 1.494e8 m/s, which is closest to option B (1.488e8), and part (b) is 3000 rpm, which is option D's speed. However, since option D's velocity is 2.488e8, which doesn't match, perhaps the correct option is B for part (a) and the speed for part (b) is 3000 rpm, which would be option D.

But looking at the options again, option I has 7500 rpm and 3.988e8 m/s. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for the second eclipse, the condition is m=2, leading to ω=2*ω1=100π rad/s=3000 rpm. So part (b) is 3000 rpm, which is option D's speed.

But option D's part (a) is 2.488e8, which is higher than our calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option I for part (b), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should select option B for part (a) and option D for part (b), but since the options are given as a single choice, I need to pick the option that has both parts correct. But none of the options have both 1.488e8 and 3000 rpm. Option D has 2.488e8 and 3000 rpm, which doesn't match part (a). Option B has 1.488e8 and 6500 rpm, which doesn't match part (b).

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option I: 2.988e8 m/s and 7500 rpm. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial calculation. Let me compute 50 *4980 *600.

50 *4980 = 249,000.

249,000 *600 = 149,400,000 m/s =1.494e8 m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the only option close to this is option B: 1.488e8 m/s and 6500 rpm. But part (b) would require 3000 rpm, which isn't there. So perhaps the correct answer is option B for part (a), and the part (b) is 3000 rpm, but since that's not available, perhaps the intended answer is option I, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v= (n * d * ω)/(1 - (n * d * ω)/(c)), but without knowing v in advance, it's hard to use.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: 2.988e8 m/s and 7500 rpm.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll go with option B for part (a) and 3000 rpm for part (b), but since the options don't match, perhaps the intended answer is option I.

The Fizeau toothed-wheel experiment involves measuring the speed of light by observing eclipses caused by a rotating wheel. The key steps are as follows:

### Part (a)
1. **Given Data**:
   - Number of teeth, \( n = 600 \)
   - Distance to the mirror, \( d = 4980 \, \text{m} \)
   - Rotational speed, \( \omega = 1500 \, \text{rpm} = 25 \, \text{revolutions/second} \)
   - Angular speed in radians: \( \omega = 25 \times 2\pi = 50\pi \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Condition for Eclipse**:
   The time for light to travel to the mirror and back is \( T = \frac{2d}{v} \). During this time, the wheel rotates by an angle \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{n} \) for the first eclipse.

3. **Equation**:
   \[
   \omega T = \frac{2\pi}{n}
   \]
   Substituting \( T = \frac{2d}{v} \):
   \[
   \omega \left(\frac{2d}{v}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{n}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   v = \frac{\omega \cdot n \cdot d}{\pi}
   \]

4. **Calculation**:
   \[
   v = \frac{(50\pi) \cdot 600 \cdot 4980}{\pi} = 50 \cdot 600 \cdot 4980 = 149,400,000 \, \text{m/s} = 1.494 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]
   This is closest to **Option B: \( 1.488 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)**.

### Part (b)
1. **Condition for Second Eclipse**:
   For the second eclipse, the wheel must rotate by an additional tooth's angle, \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{n} \). Thus:
   \[
   \omega T = \frac{4\pi}{n}
   \]
   Substituting \( T = \frac{2d}{v} \):
   \[
   \omega = \frac{4\pi}{n \cdot T} = \frac{4\pi}{n \cdot \frac{2d}{v}} = \frac{2\pi v}{d n}
   \]

2. **New Angular Speed**:
   Since \( v \) is constant, \( \omega \) doubles for the second eclipse:
   \[
   \omega_2 = 2 \cdot \omega_1 = 2 \cdot 50\pi = 100\pi \, \text{rad/s}
   \]
   Converting to rpm:
   \[
   \omega_2 = 100\pi \cdot \frac{60}{2\pi} = 3000 \, \text{rpm}
   \]

### Conclusion
- **Part (a)**: The velocity of light is approximately \( 1.494 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), closest to **Option B**.
- **Part (b)**: The required speed for the second eclipse is \( 3000 \, \text{rpm} \), which matches **Option D**.

However, since the options are combined, the best match is **Option B** for part (a) and **Option D** for part (b). Given the constraints, **Option B** is selected for part (a), and **Option D** for part (b), but the combined answer aligns with **Option B**.
