Okay, so I have this chemistry problem where a chemist mixes acetic acid and HCN in a solution. I need to find the concentrations of H3O+ and OH-. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that both acetic acid and HCN are weak acids. Acetic acid is a stronger acid than HCN because its Ka is larger (1.8e-5) compared to HCN's Ka (4e-10). So, the stronger acid will dissociate more, contributing more H+ ions to the solution.

The chemist used 0.5 moles of each acid in a one-liter solution. That means the initial concentrations of both acids are 0.5 M each since concentration is moles per liter. So, [HC2H3O2] = 0.5 M and [HCN] = 0.5 M.

Since both are acids, they'll both try to donate H+ ions. But because acetic acid is stronger, I think it will contribute more H+ than HCN. However, since HCN is a much weaker acid, its contribution might be negligible compared to acetic acid's.

Wait, but how do I calculate the H+ concentration here? I think I should consider the dissociation of both acids, but maybe I can approximate because the stronger acid will dominate.

Let me start by considering the dissociation of acetic acid first. The reaction is:

HC2H3O2 ↔ H+ + C2H3O2^-

The Ka for acetic acid is 1.8e-5. Let's denote the concentration of H+ from acetic acid as x. So, the expression is:

Ka = [H+][C2H3O2^-] / [HC2H3O2]

Assuming that x is small compared to 0.5, the denominator can be approximated as 0.5. So,

1.8e-5 ≈ x² / 0.5 → x² ≈ 9e-6 → x ≈ 3e-3 M. So [H+] from acetic acid is about 3e-3 M.

Now, let's look at HCN. Its dissociation is:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-

Ka is 4e-10. The initial concentration is 0.5 M. Let me denote the H+ from HCN as y.

Ka = y² / (0.5 - y). Since Ka is so small, y will be much smaller than 0.5, so 0.5 - y ≈ 0.5.

So, y² ≈ 4e-10 * 0.5 → y² = 2e-10 → y ≈ sqrt(2e-10) ≈ 1.414e-5 M. But that's about 1.4e-5 M H+ from HCN.

Wait, but the H+ from acetic acid is 3e-3, which is 3e-3 = 3e-3 ≈ 3e-3 M. The H+ from HCN is about 1.4e-5 M. So the total H+ would be approximately 3e-3 + 1.4e-5 ≈ 3.014e-3 M. But since 1.4e-5 is much smaller than 3e-3, maybe we can approximate the total H+ as just from acetic acid, like 3e-3 M.

But wait, I thought that when you have two acids, their H+ contributions add up. So I should consider both. But the H+ from HCN is much smaller than that from acetic acid, so it's negligible. So the [H+] is dominated by acetic acid.

Therefore, [H3O+] ≈ 3e-3 M. Now, to find [OH-], I can use Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1e-14.

So [OH-] = 1e-14 / [H+] = 1e-14 / 3e-3 ≈ 3.33e-12 M.

Looking at the options, option A says [H3O+] = 3.0e-3 and [OH-] = 3.3e-12. That matches.

Wait, but let me think again. What if the HCN contributes some H+ that's not negligible? Let me check.

The [H+] from acetic acid is 3e-3. The [H+] from HCN is about 1.4e-5. So adding them gives 3.014e-3, which is almost the same as 3e-3. So the approximation holds.

So the [H3O+] is approximately 3e-3, and OH- is 3.3e-12. So option A is correct.

The problem involves mixing 0.5 moles of acetic acid (HC₂H₃O₂) and 0.5 moles of HCN in a one-liter solution, requiring the calculation of [H₃O⁺] and [OH⁻]. Both acids are weak, with Ka values of 1.8 × 10⁻⁵ for acetic acid and 4 × 10⁻¹⁰ for HCN. Since acetic acid is a stronger acid, it will dominate the H⁺ contribution.

For acetic acid, the dissociation is:

\[
\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2 \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2^-
\]

Using the initial concentration of 0.5 M and the approximation that \([H^+]\) (denoted as \(x\)) is small compared to 0.5 M:

\[
K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.5} \implies x^2 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.5) = 9 \times 10^{-6} \implies x \approx 3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, \([H^+]\) from acetic acid is approximately \(3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\).

For HCN, the dissociation is:

\[
\text{HCN} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{CN}^-
\]

With an initial concentration of 0.5 M, the contribution of \(y = [H^+]\) from HCN is calculated as:

\[
K_a = \frac{y^2}{0.5} \implies y^2 = (4 \times 10^{-10})(0.5) = 2 \times 10^{-10} \implies y \approx \sqrt{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The total \([H^+]\) is the sum of contributions from both acids:

\[
[H^+]_{\text{total}} \approx 3 \times 10^{-3} + 1.4 \times 10^{-5} \approx 3.014 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

Since the contribution from HCN is negligible compared to acetic acid, \([H^+]\) is approximately \(3.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\).

Using the water ionization constant \(K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}\):

\[
[OH^-] = \frac{K_w}{[H^+]} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{3.0 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}.
\]

These values match option A: \([H_3O^+] = 3.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\) and \([OH^-] = 3.3 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}\).
