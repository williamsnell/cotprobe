Okay, so I've got this question about meiosis and the number of chromatids at different stages. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, the question says the animal has an adipoid number of 8. Wait, adipoid number? I think that's a typo. Oh, right! Adipoid number is probably meant to be "adiploid." No, wait, no—wait, adiploid isn't a term I'm familiar with. Oh, wait, maybe it's "haploid" or "diploid"? Because animals are usually diploid. Oh wait, I think "adipoid" is a typo for "diploid." So the diploid number is 8. That makes sense because diploid means two sets of chromosomes.

So, diploid number is 2n = 8. That means each diploid cell has 8 chromosomes. Each chromosome has two chromatids after replication, right? So in a diploid cell, there are 8 chromosomes, each with 2 chromatids, making a total of 16 chromatids.

Now, the question is about meiosis. Let's break down each part.

Part a: Number of chromatids in the tetrad stage. The tetrad stage is during the prophase I of meiosis. At this point, each homologous pair (since it's diploid) has formed a tetrad. Each homologous pair has two chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So for each tetrad, there are four chromatids. But wait, the question is about the total number of chromatids in the cell during this stage. Wait, no, the tetrad is a structure made by a pair of homologous chromosomes. Each homologous pair consists of two chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So each tetrad has four chromatids. But the question is about the total in the cell. Wait, no, the tetrad refers to a single unit. So perhaps the question is about how many chromatids are present in the tetrad, not the whole cell. So each tetrad has 4 chromatids because each homologous pair has two chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the answer for part a is 4 chromatids per tetrad. Wait, but the question says "how many chromatids are present a) in the tetrad stage." So maybe it's per tetrad, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the number of chromatids in the cell during the tetrad stage.

Wait, the diploid number is 8, so each cell has 8 chromosomes. During prophase I, each chromosome has been replicated, so each has two chromatids. So each of the 8 chromosomes is a pair of sister chromatids, making 16 chromatids in total. But when they form tetrads, each tetrad consists of four chromatids. Wait, no, each tetrad is a pair of homologous chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So each tetrad has four chromatids. But I'm not sure if the question is asking per tetrad or for the whole cell. Let me re-read the question.

It says, "how many chromatids are present a) in the tetrad stage." So maybe it's about the cell. At the tetrad stage (prophase I), each of the 8 chromosomes has two chromatids. So the total number of chromatids in the cell is 16. Or wait, no, because during prophase I, the cell hasn't divided yet. So the cell is still diploid, with 8 chromosomes, each having two chromatids. So total chromatids are 16. So part a is 16 chromatids.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have all three parts matching that. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the tetrad stage refers to each tetrad. So each tetrad has four chromatids, but how many tetrads are there? Since it's diploid with 8 chromosomes, n is 4, so there are 4 tetrads. Each tetrad has four chromatids, so in each tetrad, 4. But the question is about how many chromatids are present in the tetrad stage. So perhaps each tetrad has four chromatids, but the question is about the total in the cell. So each tetrad is a pair of homologs, each with two chromatids. So each tetrad contributes four chromatids. Since there are four tetrads (because diploid number is 8, so 8/2=4 homolog pairs), each with four chromatids, but that would be 16. But that's the same as the total in the cell. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently. The cell is diploid with 8 chromosomes (n=4, 2n=8). During prophase I, each chromosome has replicated, so each has two chromatids. So the total number of chromatids is 16. The tetrad stage occurs during prophase I, so the total number of chromatids in the cell is 16. So a) is 16.

Part b: In the late telophase of the first meiotic division. So after the first division, the cell is in telophase I. During this phase, the chromosomes have been pulled apart. So each daughter cell would have n=4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids because replication has already occurred. Wait, but during telophase I, the chromosomes are being pulled to the poles, and the cell is getting ready to divide. So each daughter cell will have 4 chromosomes. But the question is about the number of chromatids at this stage. Wait, in telophase I, the cell is about to split, so each daughter cell will have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. But during telophase I, the cell is still diploid in terms of number of chromosomes per cell, but each chromosome has two chromatids. Wait, no—during anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated, so each daughter cell has 4 chromosomes (each with two chromatids). So in telophase I, the cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the number of chromatids is 8. But wait, the cell is still a single cell at this point, so it has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, making 8 chromatids in total. So for part b, the number is 8.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. During meiosis I, the cell goes from 8 chromosomes (each with two chromatids) to each daughter cell having 8/2 = 4 chromosomes, but each of those still has two chromatids because replication has already happened. So in telophase I, the cell is about to split into two cells, each with 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So the total in the cell at that point is 8 chromatids. So part b is 8.

Part c: Metaphase of the second meiotic division. Metaphase II is similar to mitosis. At this point, the cell has already undergone meiosis I and is a haploid cell (4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids). During metaphase II, the chromosomes line up in the middle, and the sister chromatids are about to be pulled apart. So each chromosome has two chromatids. So the total number of chromatids is 8. Because each of the 4 chromosomes has two chromatids, so 4×2=8.

Wait, but during the second meiotic division, in metaphase, the sister chromatids are still attached. So each chromosome has two chromatids. So in the cell, there are 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, totaling 8 chromatids.

Putting it all together:

a) Tetrad stage (prophase I): 16 chromatids.

b) Late telophase I: 8 chromatids.

c) Metaphase II: 8 chromatids.

Looking at the options:

Let me check each option.

Option F: a) 16, b) 8, c)8. So F is a)16, b)8, c)8.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option F: a)16, b)8, c)8.

Looking at the options, option F would match a=16, b=8, c=8.

Wait, but let me check other options to be sure.

Option E: a)16, b)8, c)4. No, because c is 8.

Option F: a)16, b)8, c)8. Yes.

Other options:

Option A: a=8, which is wrong.

Option C: a=16, b=16, which is wrong.

Option J: a=8, wrong.

So the correct answer should be option F: a)16, b)8, c)8.

The animal has a diploid number of 8 (2n = 8), meaning each cell has 8 chromosomes. During meiosis, the number of chromatids changes at different stages:

1. **Tetrad stage (Prophase I):** Each chromosome has been replicated, resulting in 16 chromatids in total. Each tetrad consists of four chromatids, but the question refers to the total in the cell, which is 16.

2. **Late telophase of the first meiotic division (Telophase I):** The homologous chromosomes have been separated, and each daughter cell will have 4 chromosomes (each with two chromatids). At this stage, the cell still contains 8 chromatids.

3. **Metaphase of the second meiotic division (Metaphase II):** The cell is haploid (4 chromosomes), and each chromosome has two chromatids. Thus, there are 8 chromatids in total.

**Answer:** F
