Okay, so I have this question about the NATO intervention in Kosovo, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking what was unique about the NATO intervention in Kosovo, and the options are from A to I. I remember that the Kosovo conflict happened in the late 1990s, specifically in 1999, I think. NATO, which is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, intervened there, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

First, I need to go through each option and see which one fits. Let's start with option A: It was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans. Wait, wasn't the US involved in the Balkans before? Like in the early '90s with the Bosnian War? So maybe A isn't correct because the US was already involved.

Option B: It was the first war won by airpower alone. I think this might be true because I remember that NATO's intervention was mainly through airstrikes, and they didn't have a ground force. They called it Operation Allied Force, and it was a bombing campaign. So maybe B is correct because it was the first time a war was won without ground troops, relying solely on airpower.

Option C: It was the first war where NATO suffered no casualties. That seems unlikely because I think during the airstrikes, some NATO planes might have been shot down or had some losses, but I'm not entirely sure. I think C is probably not correct.

Option D: It was the first war where NATO used drones. Drones have been around for a while, but I think the first major use was in Afghanistan later on, so maybe D isn't right.

Option E: It was the first time NATO used military force. Wait, didn't NATO use military force before? Like in the Gulf War or earlier conflicts? So E probably isn't correct.

Option F: It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons.' Smart weapons, like guided missiles, were used earlier, maybe in the Gulf War, so F might not be correct either.

Option G: It was the first time NATO was involved in a civil war. I'm not sure about this. Kosovo was more of an ethnic conflict, but was it considered a civil war? I think so, but I'm not certain if it was the first time NATO was involved in one. Maybe they were involved in other civil wars before, so G might not be the right answer.

Option H: It was the first time NATO intervened in a non-member state. Wait, Kosovo wasn't a NATO member, but I think NATO had already intervened in non-member states before, like in Bosnia. So H might not be correct.

Option I: It was the first war where NATO used cyber warfare. I think cyber warfare became more prominent later on, maybe in the 2000s or 2010s. So I probably isn't the right answer.

Going back, the main point I remember is that the Kosovo intervention was notable for being an air campaign without ground forces. So option B seems to fit because it was the first war where airpower alone was sufficient to achieve the objectives. I think that's the key point here. Other interventions had ground forces, but in Kosovo, NATO relied solely on airstrikes, which was a first.

The unique aspect of the NATO intervention in Kosovo was that it was the first war won by airpower alone, as NATO relied solely on airstrikes without deploying ground forces. 

Answer: B
