Okay, so I've got this problem about distributing overhead based on floor space. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

The company is Harrison Manufacturing, and they have a total overhead of $97,500 for the month. The total floor space they use is 121,500 square feet. Department A occupies 8,100 square feet of that. I need to find out what Department A's share of the overhead is based on this floor space.

Hmm, so I think the approach here is to calculate the proportion of the total floor space that Department A uses and then apply that same proportion to the total overhead to find their share.

Let me write down the numbers to make it clearer. The total floor space is 121,500 sq ft, and Department A is 8,100 sq ft. So the first step is to find out what fraction or percentage 8,100 is of 121,500.

To find the proportion, I can divide 8,100 by 121,500. Let me calculate that. 

8,100 ÷ 121,500. Hmm, let me see. Both numbers are divisible by 100, so that simplifies to 81 ÷ 1215. Maybe I can simplify this fraction further. Let's see, 81 and 1215. Well, 81 times 15 is 1215 because 80*15=1200 and 1*15=15, so 1215. So 81 ÷ 1215 is the same as 1 ÷ 15. So that fraction is 1/15.

Wait, 1/15 as a decimal is approximately 0.066666..., which is about 6.666...%. So that's the proportion of the total floor space that Department A uses.

Now, to find Department A's share of the overhead, I need to take the total overhead, which is $97,500, and multiply it by this proportion, 1/15 or approximately 0.066666.

Let me do that calculation. 97,500 multiplied by 1/15. Alternatively, I can divide 97,500 by 15 to make it easier.

So, 97,500 ÷ 15. Let me compute that. 

15 goes into 97 six times (15*6=90), remainder 7. Bring down the 5, making it 75. 15 goes into 75 exactly 5 times. So so far, we have 65. Then bring down the 0, making it 0. 15 goes into 0 zero times. Next digit is another 0. So 15 goes into 0 zero times. So the result is 6,500.

Wait, that's $6,500. So Department A's share is $6,500. Looking at the options, option A is $6,500. So that should be the correct answer.

The calculation involves determining the proportion of the total floor space used by Department A and then applying that proportion to the total overhead. Department A uses 8,100 sq. ft. out of 121,500 sq. ft., which simplifies to 1/15. Multiplying the total overhead ($97,500) by 1/15 gives $6,500.
