Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. It says that when 10.0 grams of n-propylchloride reacts with excess sodium in the Wurtz reaction, how many grams of hexane would be produced, assuming a 70% yield. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember the Wurtz reaction is a type of coupling reaction. It's used to prepare alkanes from two alkyl halides using sodium metal. But wait, wait, in this case, the question mentions only one alkyl halide, n-propylchloride, and excess sodium. So I think the Wurtz reaction here is between two equivalents of n-propylchloride, right? Because sodium would deprotonate the alkyl halides, leading to an elimination and then coupling.

So the reaction should be: 2 CH2CH2CH2Cl + 2 Na → CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 + 2 NaCl. Wait, let me write that correctly. n-Propyl chloride is CH2CH2CH3Cl, but I think the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2Cl, so when two of them couple, they form hexane, which is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, wait. n-Propyl chloride is actually CH2CH2CH3Cl, but when you have two n-propyl groups coupling, you should get pentane? Wait, no. Wait, n-propyl is CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait: n-propyl is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, n-propyl is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, n-propyl is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. n-Propyl chloride is CH2ClCH2CH3, right? So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH3.

When two molecules of this undergo the Wurtz reaction, they lose two chloride ions and combine. So, each molecule contributes a CH2CH2CH3 group? Wait, no, each molecule is CH2ClCH2CH3, so when they couple, the two CH2CH2CH3 groups combine. So that would make CH2CH2CH3-CH2CH2CH3, which is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons in a row. So that's hexane. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, n-propyl is CH2ClCH2CH3, so each has three carbons. Coupling two would give six carbons, so hexane. So the product is hexane, correct.

So the balanced equation would be: 2 C3H7Cl + 2 Na → C6H14 + 2 NaCl.

Now, the next step is to calculate the moles of n-propylchloride. The molar mass of n-propylchloride: C is 12.01, H is 1.008, Cl is 35.45. So for C3H7Cl: 3*12.01 + 7*1.008 + 35.45.

Calculating: 3*12.01 = 36.03, 7*1.008=7.056, 35.45. Sum: 36.03 +7.056=43.086 +35.45=78.536 g/mol.

Wait, let me double-check: C3H7Cl. So 3 carbons, 7 hydrogens, and one Cl. So yeah, 3*12=36, 7*1=7, Cl=35.5. So 36 +7 +35.5=78.5 g/mol. So 10.0 grams divided by 78.536 g/mol is about 0.1273 moles.

Since the reaction is 2 moles of n-propylchloride producing 1 mole of hexane, the mole ratio is 2:1. So moles of hexane produced theoretically would be 0.1273 / 2 = 0.06365 moles.

Now, the molar mass of hexane (C6H14) is: 6*12.01 + 14*1.008. 6*12.01=72.06, 14*1.008=14.112. Total is 72.06 +14.112=86.172 g/mol.

So the theoretical mass is 0.06365 moles *86.172 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.06365 *86.172 ≈ 5.49 grams.

But wait, the yield is only 70%, so actual yield is 5.49 * 0.7 = approximately 3.84 grams.

Wait, let me recalculate more precisely.

First, moles of n-propylchloride: 10.0 /78.536 = let me compute that accurately. 78.536 goes into 10 how many times? 78.536 *0.127 is approximately 10 grams. Let me compute 78.536 *0.127: 78.536 *0.1=7.8536; 78.536 *0.02=1.57072; 78.536 *0.007=0.549752. Sum: 7.8536 +1.57072=9.42432 +0.549752≈9.974, which is about 10 grams. So 0.127 moles.

So moles of hexane = 0.127 /2 =0.0635 moles. Molar mass of hexane is 86.17 g/mol. So 0.0635 *86.17= let me compute: 0.06 *86.17=5.1702, 0.0035 *86.17≈0.3016. So total ≈5.4718 grams.

Multiply by 70% yield: 5.4718 *0.7 = about 3.830 grams.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.82 g, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

The Wurtz reaction involves the coupling of two alkyl halides to form an alkane. Given 10.0 g of n-propylchloride (C₃H₇Cl), the molar mass is calculated as 78.5 g/mol, yielding approximately 0.127 moles. The reaction equation is:

\[ 2 \, \text{C}_3\text{H}_7\text{Cl} + 2 \, \text{Na} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{14} + 2 \, \text{NaCl} \]

From the stoichiometry, 2 moles of n-propylchloride produce 1 mole of hexane. Thus, the moles of hexane formed theoretically are:

\[
\text{Moles of hexane} = \frac{0.127}{2} = 0.0635 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The molar mass of hexane (C₆H₁₄) is 86.17 g/mol. The theoretical mass of hexane is:

\[
\text{Mass of hexane} = 0.0635 \times 86.17 = 5.47 \, \text{g}.
\]

Considering a 70% yield, the actual mass of hexane produced is:

\[
\text{Actual mass} = 5.47 \times 0.7 = 3.83 \, \text{g}.
\]

Comparing this to the options, the closest value is **3.82 g**.
