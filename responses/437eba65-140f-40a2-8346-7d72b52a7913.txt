Question:

In theorising the Responsibility to Protect, fundamental questions are raised about the nature of state sovereignty. Regarding this tension between R2P and notions of sovereignty, which of the following is not an accurate statement?

Options:

A: In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty.
B: In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty.
C: The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.
D: According to R2P, sovereignty is only valid if the state can guarantee the safety and rights of its citizens.
E: In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and its relation to state sovereignty. Hmm, I remember R2P is a concept in international relations that deals with the protection of populations from genocide, war crimes, and other atrocities. The question is asking which statement is not accurate regarding the tension between R2P and sovereignty.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: "In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty." From what I recall, R2P does try to redefine sovereignty. It moves away from the traditional Westphalian view where sovereignty is absolute and instead ties it to the responsibilities of the state. So A seems accurate.

Option B: "In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty." That sounds right too. R2P changes the notion of sovereignty to allow for interventions when a state can't or won't protect its citizens, so B is also correct.

Option C: "The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens." Yes, R2P argues that sovereignty includes responsibilities towards one's citizens. So C is accurate.

Option D: "According to R2P, sovereignty is only valid if the state can guarantee the safety and rights of its citizens." Wait, R2P says that sovereignty is not absolute; states have a responsibility to protect their citizens. But does it say sovereignty is only valid if they can guarantee safety and rights? I think R2P implies that if a state fails in that, others can intervene. So D might be accurate, but maybe it's phrased incorrectly. Or does it say "only valid" which might be too strong?

Option E: "In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security." Hmm, R2P actually tries to move beyond traditional Westphalian sovereignty by allowing for interventions. So invoking Westphalian ideas for R2P might not be correct. Maybe E is the inaccurate statement.

Wait, the question is which is NOT accurate. So if E says that Westphalian sovereignty is invoked to justify R2P interventions, that might be wrong because R2P is trying to redefine sovereignty, not rely on the old Westphalian concept. So E is the incorrect statement.

The question asks which statement about the relationship between the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and state sovereignty is not accurate. R2P redefines sovereignty to emphasize a state's responsibilities to protect its citizens, moving away from the traditional Westphalian notion of absolute sovereignty. 

- **Option A** accurately states that R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate.  
- **Option B** correctly highlights that R2P redefines sovereignty to facilitate humanitarian interventions.  
- **Option C** accurately reflects R2P's conceptualization of sovereignty as linked to responsibilities towards citizens.  
- **Option D** is accurate because R2P implies that sovereignty is conditional on a state fulfilling its protective duties.  
- **Option E** incorrectly claims that Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked to justify R2P interventions. R2P actually redefines sovereignty, so this statement is not accurate.  

Answer: E
