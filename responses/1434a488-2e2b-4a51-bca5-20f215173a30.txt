Okay, I need to find the term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making. Let me think about what each of these options refers to.

Framing bias is about how you present information. Availability bias is when people make decisions based on how easily examples come to mind. Representativeness bias is when you judge something based on how similar it is to a specific group. Self-serving bias is when people's decisions are based on their own perceptions. Hindsight bias is when people believe past events were better than they remembered. Over-confidence bias is when people overestimate their knowledge or accuracy. Confirmation bias is when people check for information that supports their beliefs. Optimism bias is when people overestimate outcomes. Anchoring bias is when decisions are based on an initial piece of information, which might not be relevant. Heuristics are mental shortcuts people use for decision-making, and the options include J: Heuristics.

The question is about the rule of thumb, which is a general principle or rule of thumb. I remember that heuristics are general strategies people use, but the rule of thumb is a specific type of bias. For example, anchoring bias is when you rely too much on the first piece of information, like in the "golf ball" example where you look at the first impression and make a decision based on that.

So the options are:

A: Framing bias (no, because that's about how you present info)
B: Availability bias (based on availability)
C: Representativeness bias (based on similarity)
D: Self-serving bias (also about personal judgment)
E: Hindsight bias
F: Over-confidence bias
G: Confirmation bias
H: Optimism bias
I: Anchoring bias (no, that's different)
J: Heuristics

Wait, the question is about the term for the rule of thumb. So, the options J is about heuristics, which are general strategies, not a specific type of bias. The rule of thumb is a specific form of a particular bias. But the options don't include a specific term for the rule of thumb; instead, I think the closest is "heuristics" but that's not one of the options except J.

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct term for the rule of thumb is "heuristics," but since the options don't include that, perhaps the answer is "Heuristics" but that's not listed. Wait, no, the options are A through J, and the correct term is not listed except if it's another option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Framing bias
B: Availability bias
C: Representativeness bias
D: Self-serving bias
E: Hindsight bias
F: Over-confidence bias
G: Confirmation bias
H: Optimism bias
I: Anchoring bias
J: Heuristics

So, the rule of thumb is a type of heuristic. So the term is "Heuristics." But looking at the options, J is Heuristics. So the answer is J. But wait, the question is about the term for the rule of thumb, which is a type of bias. So is the term "Heuristics" or another term? Or is there a specific term.

Wait, no, the options include J: Heuristics, which is a term that refers to a mental shortcut. But the rule of thumb is a specific type of heuristic, but the term for the rule of thumb itself as a bias is not among the options. Wait, noâ€”the options are the possible answers, and we have to pick from them. So if the correct term is "heuristics," but that's option J, but J isn't a term for the rule of thumb per se.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The rule of thumb is a heuristic used in decision-making. So the term for the rule of thumb as a type of bias is not directly listed. The options are A through J, and the correct answer is J: Heuristics.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another approach. The rule of thumb is a specific type of a general strategy. So the term for the rule of thumb is "heuristics." But the options don't have "heuristics" as an option except J. So J is the correct answer.

Wait, wait another moment. Wait, the rule of thumb is a type of heuristic. So the term for the rule of thumb as a type of bias is "heuristics," but if the options don't have "heuristics" as a choice (except J), then J is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I have misunderstood the options. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Framing bias

B: Availability bias

C: Representativeness bias

D: Self-serving bias

E: Hindsight bias

F: Over-confidence bias

G: Confirmation bias

H: Optimism bias

I: Anchoring bias

J: Heuristics

So, the correct term is "Heuristics," which is option J. Therefore, the answer is J.
</think>

The correct answer is J: Heuristics. The rule of thumb is a form of a mental shortcut, which is referred to as "heuristics." While heuristics are broader, the specific term for the rule of thumb itself is not listed, but J is the closest option.

Answer: J
