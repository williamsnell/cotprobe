Okay, so I've got this question here about converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin. The given temperature is -10°C, and I need to find the equivalent readings in Fahrenheit and Kelvin from the options provided.

First, I remember that there are formulas for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit and to Kelvin. Let me recall them. For Celsius to Fahrenheit, the formula is F = (C × 9/5) + 32. And for Kelvin, I think it's K = C + 273.15. Wait, sometimes I get confused between Celsius to Kelvin and Fahrenheit, so I should double-check that.

So, starting with converting -10°C to Fahrenheit. Plugging into the formula: F = (-10 × 9/5) + 32. Let me calculate that step by step. First, multiply -10 by 9/5. 9 divided by 5 is 1.8, so -10 × 1.8 equals -18. Then add 32 to that. So -18 + 32 is 14. So Fahrenheit should be 14°F. That seems right because I know that water freezes at 32°F, which is 0°C, so each degree Celsius is about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. So -10°C would be about 14°F. That makes sense.

Next, converting -10°C to Kelvin. The formula is K = C + 273.15. So -10 + 273.15 equals 263.15 K. But I think sometimes people round it to the nearest whole number, so that would be approximately 263 K. Wait, but looking at the options, some have 263, others 268, 250, etc. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the choices for Fahrenheit are in A through J. For Fahrenheit, I got 14°F, which is option E: 14°F and 250K, but wait, E's Kelvin is 250, which doesn't match my calculation. Let me check again. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the Kelvin part. Let me recalculate.

Wait, K = C + 273.15. So -10 + 273.15 = 263.15 K, which is about 263 K. So looking for an option that has 14°F and 263K. Let me check the options.

Looking at option G: 14°F and 263K. Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the Fahrenheit is 14, Kelvin is 263. So the correct option should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the options. Let me go through each option quickly:

A: 20°F and 283K. No, my F is 14.

B: -5°F and 268K. F is wrong.

C: 10°F and 253K. Both wrong.

D:5°F and 258K. No.

E:14°F and 250K. K is off by 3.

F:0°F and 273K. F is wrong, K is 263.15, so 273 is too high.

G:14°F and 263K. Both correct.

H:0°F and 260K. No.

I:-10°F and 283K. F is wrong.

J:18°F and 260K. Both wrong.

So definitely, G is the correct option. So the answer should be G.

The temperature of -10°C converts to 14°F using the formula F = (C × 9/5) + 32 and to approximately 263K using K = C + 273.15. The correct option is G: 14°F and 263K.

Answer: G
