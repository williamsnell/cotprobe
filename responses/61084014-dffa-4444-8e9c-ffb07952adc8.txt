Okay, so I have this question about the capital/output ratio, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: When the capital/output ratio for the annual output is 2, what is it for quarterly output? The options are from A to J, with numbers like 10, 5, 0.5, etc.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the capital/output ratio means. From what I remember, the capital/output ratio is a measure used in economics to indicate how much capital is required to produce a unit of output. So, if the ratio is 2, it means that for every unit of output, two units of capital are needed. In other words, capital is twice as much as the output.

But wait, the question is about moving from annual output to quarterly output. I think this has to do with the time frame. Annual is yearly, and quarterly is every three months. So, the question is asking, if the ratio is 2 on an annual basis, what would it be when measured quarterly?

I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about how these ratios change with time periods. Let me consider that the capital stock is usually a stock variable, meaning it's measured at a point in time, while output is a flow variable, measured over a period. So, when we talk about the capital/output ratio, we're comparing the stock of capital to the flow of output over a certain period.

If the ratio is 2 annually, that means the total capital is twice the annual output. Now, if we look at it quarterly, we're dividing the same annual output into four parts, each representing three months. But what about the capital? Does the capital change quarterly? Well, capital can change over time due to investments or depreciation, but if we're assuming it's the same throughout the year, then the stock remains the same.

So, let's say the annual output is O. The capital is 2O (since the ratio is 2). Now, for each quarter, the output would be O/4, assuming output is evenly distributed. The capital remains 2O because it's a stock, not a flow. So the quarterly capital/output ratio would be 2O divided by (O/4).

Let me compute that: 2O / (O/4) = 2 * 4 = 8. Wait, that gives me 8, which is option J. But wait, that seems high. Maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is applied per period. So if the annual ratio is 2, then for each quarter, the ratio would be the same because the relationship holds per period. So the quarterly ratio would still be 2, which is option E. But that doesn't make sense because the time period is shorter.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between capital as a flow and output as a flow. Let me think again. The capital/output ratio is typically calculated as the stock of capital divided by the flow of output over a period. So if the annual ratio is 2, that's K/Y = 2, where K is the stock and Y is annual output.

When we look at quarterly output, Y for a quarter is Y_annual / 4. But the capital K remains the same, as it's a stock. So the quarterly ratio would be K / (Y_annual /4) = (K/Y_annual) *4 = 2 *4 =8. So that would be 8, option J.

Wait, but some sources say that if the ratio is for a year, then per quarter it would remain the same because the ratio is a proportion. But that doesn't align with the calculation I just did. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is based on the same time period, so if you're looking at a shorter period, the ratio might change based on how output and capital are measured.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The capital/output ratio is 2 annually. So for the entire year, K/Y = 2. When we look at a quarter, which is 1/4 of a year, the output for the quarter is Y/4. The capital K is the same. So the quarterly ratio is K/(Y/4) = 4*(K/Y) = 4*2 =8. So the answer would be 8, which is J.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes ratios can remain the same when considering the same proportion over different time frames. But in this case, since output is divided by four, the ratio increases by four times, leading to 8.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the question is simply asking, if the annual ratio is 2, what's the quarterly ratio, and the answer is the same, 2. But that would be option E. But that doesn't make sense because the output is spread over four quarters, so the ratio should change.

Wait, let me check an example. Suppose annual output Y is 100. Then K is 200 because K/Y = 2. Now, for each quarter, output is 25. The capital is still 200. So the quarterly ratio is 200/25 =8. So the answer is 8, option J.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be J:8.

The capital/output ratio for annual output is 2, meaning the capital is twice the annual output. When considering quarterly output, the annual output is divided by four, but the capital remains the same. Thus, the quarterly ratio is calculated as the capital divided by the quarterly output, which is 8.

Answer: J
