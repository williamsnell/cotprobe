Okay, so I've got this problem about home runs hit by the Boston Red Sox over eight consecutive games. The numbers given are 2, 3, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0. And I need to find the mean, median, and mode from these numbers. Then, select the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by understanding each part: mean, median, and mode.

First, the mean. That's the average, right? So I need to add up all the home runs and divide by the number of games. Let me add them up:

2 + 3 is 5, plus 0 is 5, plus 3 is 8, plus 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13, plus 3 is 16, plus 0 is 16. So total is 16 home runs over 8 games. 16 divided by 8 is 2. So mean is 2.

Wait, let me double-check that addition. 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. So adding step by step:

2 +3=5

5+0=5

5+3=8

8+4=12

12+1=13

13+3=16

16+0=16. Yep, that's right. 16 divided by 8 is indeed 2. So mean is 2.

Next, the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are 8 games, which is an even number, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th numbers after sorting.

Let me sort the numbers: 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4.

So the 4th number is 2, the 5th is 3. The average of 2 and 3 is (2+3)/2 = 2.5. So median is 2.5.

Wait, or did I sort correctly? Let me list them again: the original numbers are 2,3,0,3,4,1,3,0. When sorted, it's 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4. Yes, that's correct. So the middle two are 2 and 3, average is 2.5.

Now, the mode. That's the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the sorted list: 0 appears twice, 1 once, 2 once, 3 appears three times, and 4 once. So 3 is the mode.

So putting it all together: mean is 2, median is 2.5, mode is 3.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Mean:3, Median:3, Mode:3 → No, mean is 2.

B: Mean:2.5, Median:3, Mode:0 → No, mean is 2, mode is 3.

C: Mean:3, Median:2, Mode:1 → No.

D: Mean:1, Median:2, Mode:4 → No.

E: Mean:2.16, Median:2, Mode:3 → No, mean is 2.

F: Mean:2.5, Median:2, Mode:3 → No, mean is 2.

G: Mean:2, Median:3, Mode:0 → No, mode is 3.

H: Mean:1.5, Median:2, Mode:3 → No, mean is 2.

I: Mean:2, Median:1.5, Mode:2 → No, median is 2.5, mode is 3.

J: Mean:2, Median:2.5, Mode:3 → Yes! That matches.

Wait, let me check each option again. Option J has mean 2, median 2.5, mode 3. That's exactly what I calculated.

So the correct answer should be J.

The mean is calculated by summing all home runs (16) and dividing by the number of games (8), resulting in 2. The median is the average of the 4th and 5th values in the sorted list, which are 2 and 3, giving 2.5. The mode is the most frequent number, which is 3. Therefore, the correct option is J.

Answer: J
