Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistics, specifically comparing bootstrapping and pure simulation. I need to figure out under which situations bootstrapping would be preferred. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that bootstrapping is a resampling method where you take samples with replacement from the original dataset to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. Pure simulation, on the other hand, usually involves generating data from a known model or distribution.

The question asks when bootstrapping is preferred over pure simulation. Let's look at the options given.

The scenarios are i to iv:

i) Desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are the same as some actual data.

ii) Desired that the distributional properties are known exactly.

iii) Distributional properties of actual data are unknown.

iv) The sample of actual data available is very small.

So, I need to determine when bootstrapping is better. Let's think about each scenario.

Starting with scenario i: If we want the distributional properties to match some actual data. Bootstrapping uses the actual data's distribution, so in this case, it makes sense to use bootstrapping because it preserves the original data's characteristics. Pure simulation would require knowing the exact distribution or model, which might not be the case here.

Scenario ii: Desired that distributional properties are known exactly. If the distribution is known, maybe pure simulation would be better because you can generate data from that exact model without needing to rely on the sample data. Bootstrapping might not be as efficient here since it's resampling from the data, which is just an approximation of the known distribution.

Scenario iii: Distributional properties are unknown. Bootstrapping is useful here because you don't need to know the underlying distribution. You just resample from your data, which can estimate the distribution without prior knowledge. Pure simulation might not be feasible if the distribution isn't known because you can't model it.

Scenario iv: Small sample size. Bootstrapping can still work with small samples, though it's sometimes less reliable. Pure simulation might require a good model, which you might not have if the sample is small. So, if you don't have a good model, bootstrapping from the small dataset might be better than trying to simulate a model you don't know.

Now, let's evaluate which scenarios make bootstrapping preferable.

i) Yes, because it uses the actual data's distribution.

ii) No, because if the distribution is known, pure simulation is better.

iii) Yes, because bootstrapping doesn't need to know the distribution.

iv) Yes, because with small samples, bootstrapping can still provide estimates without needing a model.

Wait, but scenario iv: if the sample is very small, would bootstrapping still be better than simulation? I'm a bit confused here. Bootstrapping relies on the sample data, so if the sample is small, the resamples might not capture the true distribution well. But pure simulation requires knowing the distribution. If the distribution is unknown, then even simulation isn't straightforward. So in that case, maybe bootstrapping is the better option because you don't need to know the distribution, even if the sample is small.

So, putting it all together:

i) Yes, bootstrapping is better.

ii) No, pure simulation is better.

iii) Yes, bootstrapping is better.

iv) Yes, bootstrapping is better.

Wait, but looking back, some sources say that bootstrapping can be problematic with very small samples because the resamples might not be diverse enough. So maybe in iv, pure simulation might be better if the distribution is known, but if it's unknown, bootstrapping is still better. But in this question, scenario iv doesn't specify whether the distribution is known or not. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about when bootstrapping is preferred to pure simulation. So in iv, if the sample is very small and the distribution is unknown, bootstrapping might still be better because you can't do pure simulation without knowing the distribution. So yes, iv is a case where bootstrapping is preferred.

So the scenarios where bootstrapping is preferred are i, iii, and iv. Looking at the options:

Option H is (i), (iii), and (iv) only.

Option D is (i) and (iv) only.

Wait, but in my analysis, scenario i is yes, iii is yes, iv is yes. So that's three scenarios. Let me check the options:

H: (i), (iii), and (iv) only.

So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: (i), (iii), and (iv) only.

**Answer: H**
