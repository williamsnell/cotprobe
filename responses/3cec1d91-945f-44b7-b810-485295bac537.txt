Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a mass-spring system. Let me try to understand what's being asked and figure out the solution step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my differential equations, but I'll take it slow.

The problem states: A mass weighing 2 lb stretches a spring 6 inches. Then, the mass is pulled down an additional 3 inches and released. There's no damping, so we're dealing with simple harmonic motion. I need to find the position u of the mass at any time t and the frequency of the motion. The options are given as A through J, with various multiples of pi in seconds.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I remember that in a spring-mass system without damping, the motion is described by the equation:

u(t) = A cos(ωt - φ)

where ω is the angular frequency, A is the amplitude, and φ is the phase shift. Since the mass is released from its maximum displacement, the phase shift φ should be zero, so the equation simplifies to u(t) = A cos(ωt).

But wait, sometimes it's written using sine instead of cosine if there's an initial velocity, but since it's released from rest after being pulled down, I think using cosine is correct here because at t=0, u should be at its maximum displacement.

Now, I need to find ω, which is related to the system's natural frequency. The formula for ω is sqrt(k/m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass.

Wait, the units here are in pounds and inches, so I'll need to convert them to standard units (slugs, seconds, feet) because in the English system, the units for spring constant k are lb/in, and mass is in slugs.

First, let me find k. The problem says a 2 lb mass stretches the spring 6 inches. From Hooke's Law, F = kx, so k = F/x.

F is given as 2 lb, x is 6 inches. But I should convert inches to feet because typically in these equations, x is in feet, and k would then be in lb/ft.

Wait, but sometimes people keep x in inches, so I need to be careful. Let me see: 6 inches is 0.5 feet. So x = 0.5 ft.

So k = F/x = 2 lb / 0.5 ft = 4 lb/ft.

Wait, that seems right. So the spring constant k is 4 lb/ft.

Next, I need the mass m. The mass is 2 lb. Wait, no, the mass in the English system is in slugs, not pounds. Pounds can refer to force, not mass. So I need to convert the weight (force) to mass.

The formula is m = F/g, where F is the force (weight) and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The standard g is approximately 32.174 ft/s².

So m = 2 lb / 32.174 ft/s² ≈ 0.06212 slug.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes people approximate g as 32 ft/s² for simplicity, so m ≈ 2/32 = 1/16 slug, which is 0.0625 slug. Close enough.

So now, ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(4 / (1/16)) = sqrt(4 * 16) = sqrt(64) = 8 rad/s.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check the calculations.

k is 4 lb/ft, m is 2 lb divided by 32 ft/s². So 2/32 is 1/16 slug, which is correct. So 4 divided by (1/16) is 64, so sqrt(64) is 8 rad/s. Right.

So the angular frequency ω is 8 rad/s.

Now, the frequency f is ω/(2π). So f = 8/(2π) = 4/π Hz. Wait, but looking at the options, they don't have 4/π. Let me check again because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: the period T is 2π/ω, so T = 2π/8 = π/4 seconds. So the frequency f is 1/T, which is 4/π Hz. But looking at the options, they have frequency in terms of pi. Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the period instead of the frequency? Wait, the question asks for the frequency of the motion, so I think I need to express it in Hz, but the options are in terms of pi, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the mass is 2 lb. Is that the weight, so the actual mass m is 2 lb / g. And I used g=32 ft/s², so m=2/32 = 1/16 slug, that's correct. Then, k is 4 lb/ft. So ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(4/(1/16)) = sqrt(64) = 8 rad/s. So that's correct.

Then, the frequency f is ω/(2π) = 8/(2π) = 4/π Hz. But 4/pi is approximately 1.273 Hz, which is about 1.273 cycles per second. Now, looking at the answer options, they are frequencies given as multiples of pi in seconds, but wait, the options are labeled as "frequency of the motion" but the options are in terms of pi multiplied by some fraction and then 's', which I think represents seconds. Wait, no, actually, the options are labeled as "pi/5 s", etc., which probably refers to the period, since periods are in seconds. Alternatively, maybe they mean the frequency is 1/(pi/5) Hz, but that's not how it's written. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read again.

Wait, the question asks to determine the position u of the mass at any time t and find the frequency of the motion. So the second part is to find the frequency. The options are all in terms of pi and 's', which suggests they are periods, not frequencies. Because frequency is in Hz (1/s), but the options are like pi/5 s, which is a period. So maybe the question is actually asking for the period, not the frequency. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "determine the position u of the mass at any time t. Find the frequency of the motion." So the question is about frequency, but the options are in terms of seconds, which makes me think they are periods. Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the period instead. Since ω is 8 rad/s, the period T is 2π/ω = 2π/8 = π/4 seconds. So that's T = π/4 s, which is option D.

But since the question asks for frequency, which is 1/T, that would be 4/pi Hz. But 4/pi isn't one of the options. The options are all multiples of pi in seconds, which suggests they're periods, not frequencies. So perhaps the question meant to ask for the period instead. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, let me check the initial data again. The mass is 2 lb, which is a weight, so the actual mass is 2 lb / 32 ft/s² = 1/16 slug. The spring is stretched 6 inches (0.5 ft) by 2 lb, so k = 2 lb / 0.5 ft = 4 lb/ft. That seems correct.

So ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(4/(1/16)) = sqrt(64) = 8 rad/s. Correct.

Then, the period T is 2π/ω = 2π/8 = π/4 seconds. So the period is π/4 s, which is option D. But the question asks for the frequency, which would be 1/(π/4) = 4/π Hz, which isn't an option. So maybe the question intended to ask for the period, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial stretch of the spring is 6 inches, which is when the mass is at equilibrium. So when the mass is pulled an additional 3 inches, the total displacement from equilibrium is 3 inches. So the amplitude A is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet. But for the equation of motion, we need to express u in feet or inches? Well, probably in feet since our calculations are in feet.

But wait, the equation of motion is u(t) = A cos(ωt), where A is the amplitude. So A is 0.25 ft. But the question is about the position u at any time t, and the frequency. So perhaps I need to write the equation in terms of u(t), but the options are about frequency, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem is asking for the position u(t) and the frequency. So perhaps the position is u(t) = (3 in) cos(ωt), but I'm more concerned about the frequency part.

Given that, and that the period is π/4 s, which is option D, but the options are for frequency. So I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ω.

Wait another approach: Let's make sure about the units. The spring constant k is in lb/in, perhaps, because the displacement was given in inches. Let me recalculate k.

If x is 6 inches, F is 2 lb, so k = F/x = 2 lb / 6 in = 1/3 lb/in. Oh, perhaps I should have kept x in inches. Because if x is in inches, then k is in lb/in, and mass m is in slugs, but when using k in lb/in, the units for ω become sqrt( (lb/in) / slug ). But I'm not sure if that works out. Let me think.

Wait, in the English system, the units for k in Hooke's Law F = kx should be in lb per inch because x is in inches. So F is in pounds, x in inches, so k is lb/in.

So F = 2 lb, x = 6 in, so k = 2/6 = 1/3 lb/in. That's correct.

Now, the mass m is 2 lb divided by g. But g is 32 ft/s², so m = 2 lb / 32 ft/s² = 1/16 slug. Now, the formula for ω is sqrt(k/m), but with k in lb/in and m in slugs, I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, 1 slug is the mass that accelerates 1 ft/s² under 1 lb of force. So to use k in lb/in, perhaps I need to convert it to lb/ft by multiplying by 12, since 1 ft = 12 in. So k = (1/3) lb/in * 12 in/ft = 4 lb/ft.

Yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So k is 4 lb/ft, m is 1/16 slug.

So ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(4 / (1/16)) = sqrt(64) = 8 rad/s. So that's correct.

Thus, the period T = 2π/ω = 2π/8 = π/4 s. So the period is π/4 seconds, which is option D.

But the question asks for the frequency, which is 1/T = 4/π Hz. But since the options are all in terms of pi and seconds, perhaps the intended answer is the period, which is π/4 s, option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question and it's asking for the frequency in terms of pi, but that doesn't make much sense. Because frequency is 1/period. So if the period is π/4 s, the frequency is 4/π Hz, which is approximately 1.273 Hz. But none of the options match that. The options are all multiples of pi in seconds, so they must be periods, not frequencies.

Therefore, I think the intended answer is the period, which is π/4 s, so option D.

The problem involves a mass-spring system where a 2 lb mass stretches a spring 6 inches. Using Hooke's Law and the formula for angular frequency, we calculate the spring constant \( k = \frac{2 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{ft}} = 4 \, \text{lb/ft} \). The mass \( m \) is converted from weight to slugs: \( m = \frac{2 \, \text{lb}}{32 \, \text{ft/s}^2} = \frac{1}{16} \, \text{slug} \). The angular frequency \( \omega \) is then \( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{1/16}} = 8 \, \text{rad/s} \). The period \( T \) is \( \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{s} \). Since the question asks for the frequency, which is \( \frac{1}{T} = \frac{4}{\pi} \, \text{Hz} \), but the options are in terms of seconds, they likely refer to the period. Thus, the period is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{s} \), corresponding to option D.
