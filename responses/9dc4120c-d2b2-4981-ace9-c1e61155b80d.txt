C: Euglena moves by pseudopodia, carries on heterotrophic nutrition, and reproduces sexually.
D: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but cannot shift to heterotrophic, and reproduces asexually through budding.
E: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on chemosynthetic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through sporulation.
F: Euglena moves by undulating its flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission.
G: Euglena moves by jet propulsion, carries on autotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through multiple fission.
H: Euglena moves by cilia, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under light, and reproduces asexually through binary fission.
I: Euglena moves by gliding along surfaces, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic in the absence of light, and reproduces asexually through budding.
J: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on mixotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation.

Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Euglena. Let's break down the question and the options.

The question is asking about three aspects of Euglena: method of locomotion, nutrition, and asexual reproduction. I'm a bit rusty on my protozoans, but I remember that Euglena is a type of flagellate. 

First, locomotion. Euglena has a flagellum, right? So they move using that flagellum. So any option that says they move by something else, like cilia or pseudopodia, is probably wrong. Let's look at the options.

Option A says they contract their body. No, that's not right. Flagellates use flagella. So A is out.

Option B: flagellum. That sounds correct. Option C: pseudopodia. No, that's for amoeboids, so C is out. D: flagellum. So D could be possible. E: flagellum as well. F: flagellum again. G: jet propulsion? I don't think that's correct. H: cilia? No, Euglena has a flagellum. I: gliding? Not sure about that. J: flagellum. So B, D, E, F, H, J are possible for movement.

Next, nutrition. Euglena is a mixotroph, meaning it can do both autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition. So it can photosynthesize (autotrophic) when light is available and switch to consuming organic matter (heterotrophic) when it's dark. Wait, or is it the other way around? No, I think in light, they photosynthesize, and in darkness, they feed heterotrophically. So they can switch based on conditions.

Looking at the options: B says autotrophic but can switch to heterotrophic. So that's mixotrophic. Option F says autotrophic but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness. That fits. Option J says mixotrophic, which is correct. Let's see the other options.

Option B's nutrition is autotrophic with switching, which is correct since mixotrophic implies both. But let me check the other parts. Option F says under darkness, shift to heterotrophic. That seems accurate because when light is low or absent, they can't photosynthesize and switch to taking in organic matter.

Option J says mixotrophic, so that's correct, but I need to check the reproduction part as well.

Reproduction: Euglena typically reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission. Option B says cytokinesis, which is cell division but doesn't specify the method. Option F says longitudinal binary fission, which is correct. Option J says both longitudinal binary fission and sporulation. Wait, sporulation is more for when they form spores, perhaps under stress conditions, but the regular asexual reproduction is binary fission.

So, putting it together, let's look at the options again.

Option B: moves by flagellum, autotrophic but can switch to heterotrophic, reproduces via cytokinesis (which is cell division but not specifically binary fission). So maybe not the best choice.

Option F: moves by flagellum, autotrophic shifting to heterotrophic under darkness, reproduces via longitudinal binary fission. That seems correct.

Option J: mixotrophic nutrition, but the reproduction is both fission and sporulation. I'm not sure if Euglena uses sporulation as a regular asexual method. I think it's more about binary fission.

So the correct answer would be F or J. Wait, let me double-check the nutrition part.

Euglena has a structure called the paramylum body, which is a starch reserve, and they can photosynthesize with chloroplasts. So in light, they use autotrophic, and in dark, they switch to heterotrophic. So the nutrition is mixotrophic.

Looking back at the options, option J says "mixotrophic nutrition" which is correct. But let me check the reproductive method. Option J says "reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation." Wait, do they do both? Or is sporulation a different process?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Euglena's asexual reproduction is typically by longitudinal binary fission. Sporulation is more like producing spores, which might be more common in other protozoa, like in some amoeboids or when conditions are harsh, perhaps. So the main method is binary fission.

So in the options:

Option B: flagellum movement, can switch nutrition, reproduces via cytokinesis (which is a general term for cell division, but binary fission is a type of cytokinesis). So B might be correct, but the nutrition part is more about autotrophic with switching, which is mixotrophic. But option B says 'carries on autotrophic nutrition and can switch to heterotrophic when necessary' which is correct. Reproduction is cytokinesis, which includes binary fission.

Option F says 'autotrophic but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness' and reproduces via longitudinal binary fission. That's accurate.

Option J says 'mixotrophic nutrition' and reproduces via fission and sporulation. But I'm not sure if sporulation is a common asexual method for Euglena. I think they primarily use binary fission.

So between B and F. Let me check the movement again. Option B says 'moves by flagellum' which is correct. Option F also says the same. So the difference is in nutrition and reproduction.

Option B's nutrition is autotrophic with switching, which is correct. Reproduction is cytokinesis, which is correct as it's a form of binary fission.

Option F's nutrition is correct, and reproduction is correct as well. So what's the difference between B and F in nutrition? Option B says 'carries on autotrophic nutrition and can switch to heterotrophic when necessary.' Option F says 'autotrophic but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness.' Both are correct, but maybe F is more specific about the condition (darkness) which is accurate.

So the correct answer would be F. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option J says 'mixotrophic nutrition' which is the same as B and F, but includes sporulation, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, option J says 'mixotrophic nutrition' and 'reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation.' If Euglena can reproduce via both methods, then J would be correct. But I thought the main method is binary fission, and sporulation might be under stress.

Wait, let me check. From what I remember, Euglena's main asexual reproduction is through binary fission. Sporulation is more for producing resting stages, perhaps when conditions are unfavorable. So the primary method is binary fission, not sporulation.

So, looking back, option F correctly states the movement, nutrition, and reproduction. Option J includes both fission and sporulation, which might not be accurate for the primary method.

Wait, but the question is asking for a brief description. So if the organism can use both methods, then J would be correct. But I'm not certain about that. 

Alternatively, I think that 'mixotrophic' is the correct nutrition, and the main reproduction is binary fission. So the correct option would be J if it includes both, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options again, let's see:

Option F: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission.

Option J: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on mixotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation.

So, nutrition-wise, F says 'autotrophic but shifts under darkness' which is correct because mixotrophic. So F and J both have correct nutrition aspects.

Reproduction-wise, F says binary fission, which is correct. J says both fission and sporulation. I'm not sure if sporulation is part of asexual reproduction in Euglena. I think binary fission is the primary method, so F would be correct.

So the answer should be F, but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is J because it correctly mentions mixotrophic nutrition.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Euglena's movement: flagellum. Correct.

Nutrition: mixotrophic. So the options that say mixotrophic are B, J, and others. Wait, no. Option B says 'autotrophic but can switch,' which implies mixotrophic. Option J says 'mixotrophic.' So both are correct.

Reproduction: asexual via binary fission. So the options that mention binary fission are F and J.

Wait, option B says 'reproduces asexually through cytokinesis,' which is a broader term, including binary fission. So F and B are possible.

But if the question is looking for the specific method, F is more precise with 'longitudinal binary fission.'

So, putting it all together, the correct option is F. Because:

- Movement: flagellum. Correct.

- Nutrition: can shift from autotrophic (in light) to heterotrophic (in darkness). So F's description is accurate.

- Reproduction: longitudinal binary fission. Correct.

So the answer should be F.

Euglena is a green flagellate protozoan that moves using a flagellum. It exhibits mixotrophic nutrition, meaning it can photosynthesize (autotrophic) in light and switch to consuming organic matter (heterotrophic) in darkness. Asexual reproduction in Euglena typically occurs through longitudinal binary fission. Among the options, F accurately describes all three aspects of Euglena's biology.

Answer: F
