Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Purusa-Sukta"
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Okay, so I've got this question about the caste system in ancient Indian society and which option would best contradict the argument that it imposed rigid economic and social roles from 600 BCE to 600 CE. The question references a passage from the Purusa-Sukta hymn in the Rig Veda, which describes the origins of the caste system as a divine creation. 

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It wants an option that contradicts the idea that the caste system was rigid in terms of economic and social roles. So, I'm looking for an option that either shows flexibility in the system or challenges its divine origin or rigidity.

Looking at the options:

A: Bhagavad Gita talks about dharma based on caste. This supports the rigid system, so it wouldn't contradict it.

B: Brahmins have highest status because they're priests. This aligns with the rigid structure described, so it's supporting, not contradicting.

C: Sudras are servants. Again, this supports the rigid roles, so not the answer.

D: Rig Veda depicts caste as divine. This is directly from the passage, so it supports the rigid system as a divine order, not contradicting.

E: Ramayana was written by a prince. Hmm, this doesn't directly talk about caste. It's more about literature, but maybe it shows that literature could be created by people outside the traditional roles? Not sure yet.

F: For a Kshatriya, battle is duty. This is about a specific role but doesn't necessarily contradict the rigidity; it's just stating their duty.

G: The person who wrote Mahabharata was born to a fisherwoman. Wait, the Mahabharata is traditionally credited to Vyasa, who was born to a fisherwoman. This might suggest that even great works can come from lower castes, which could imply that the system wasn't as rigid as it seems. This might be a good candidate.

H: Krishna says four divisions are created by him. Again, supports the divine origin, so it's supporting, not contradicting.

I: Shiva as creator, preserver, destroyer. This is more about cosmic roles, not directly about caste system's rigidity.

J: Manusmriti says caste system is religiously sanctioned. This supports the argument, so it doesn't contradict.

So, the options that could potentially contradict are E and G. E is about the Ramayana being written by a prince, but it's more about authorship than challenging the caste system's rigidity. G, on the other hand, points out that the author of the Mahabharata came from a lower caste (fisherwoman), which might suggest that the system wasn't as rigid as it's made out to be. It challenges the idea that rigid roles prevented someone from a lower caste from achieving such a high literary feat.

Therefore, the best answer is G.

The correct answer is G, as it challenges the rigidity of the caste system by highlighting that a significant literary work could be created by someone from a lower caste.

Answer: G
