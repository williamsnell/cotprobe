Question:

Use indirect truth tables to determine whether the following argument is valid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
(K · L) ⊃ M
N ⊃ ~M
N ∨ K / L ⊃ K

Options:

A: Valid
B: Invalid. Counterexample when L, M, and N are true and K is false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when L and M are true and K and N are false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false

Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure out whether the argument is valid or not. If it's invalid, I need to pick the right counterexample from the options given. Let me break it down step by step.

The argument is:

1. (K · L) ⊃ M
2. N ⊃ ~M
3. N ∨ K
4. Therefore, L ⊃ K

I think I should use an indirect truth table, which I remember involves assuming the conclusion is false and then checking for contradictions. But maybe I should first try to understand each statement.

Starting with statement 1: If both K and L are true, then M must be true. So whenever K and L are both true, M has to be true. If either K or L is false, this implication doesn't say anything about M.

Statement 2: If N is true, then M must be false. So whenever N is true, M is false, and vice versa? Wait, no, implications only go one way. So if N is true, M is false; but if N is false, M could be either true or false.

Statement 3: Either N is true or K is true. So in any situation, at least one of N or K must be true. No, wait, actually, it's N OR K. So if either N is true, or K is true, or both, the statement holds.

Now, the conclusion is L ⊃ K. So if L is true, then K must be true. The argument is saying that given the premises, we can conclude that L implies K. I need to check if this is always true or if there's a case where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. If such a case exists, the argument is invalid, and that case would be a counterexample.

To do this, I can construct a truth table, but since there are four variables (K, L, M, N), that's 16 possible rows. That's a bit tedious, but maybe I can find a smarter way using an indirect truth table.

Alternatively, maybe using logical equivalences or implications to derive the conclusion. Let's see.

From premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M. Which is equivalent to ~K ∨ ~L ∨ M.

From premise 2: N → ~M, which is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~M.

From premise 3: N ∨ K.

We need to derive L → K, which is equivalent to ~L ∨ K.

Let me see if I can derive ~L ∨ K from the premises.

Alternatively, let's assume that the premises are true and the conclusion is false. So, assume that L is true and K is false. Then, we look for a truth assignment where premises are true but the conclusion is false.

So, let's set L=T and K=F.

Now, with K=F and L=T, let's see what the premises say.

Premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M. Since K=F, (F ∧ T)=F. An implication with a false antecedent is always true, so premise 1 holds.

Premise 2: N → ~M. Hmm, so if N=T, then ~M must be T, so M=F. If N=F, then the implication is automatically true, regardless of M.

Premise 3: N ∨ K. Since K=F, N must be T for this premise to hold. Because if K=F, then N has to be T for N∨K to be T.

So, with K=F, L=T, we have N must be T (from premise 3). Then, from premise 2, since N=T, ~M must be T, so M=F.

Now, check premise 1 again: (K ∧ L) → M. K=F, so (F ∧ T)=F. F→M is T regardless of M. So premise 1 is satisfied.

So, in this scenario, L=T, K=F, N=T, M=F.

Let me see if this is a valid assignment.

Now, let's check the conclusion: L→K. Since L=T and K=F, the conclusion is F. So in this case, the premises are T, and the conclusion is F. Therefore, this is a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

Now, let's look at the options.

Option B: Invalid. Counterexample when L, M, and N are true and K is false. Wait, in my scenario, L is T, M is F, N is T, K is F. So M is F, which contradicts option B, because B says M is T. So option B isn't the case here.

Option C: Invalid. Counterexample when L and M are true and K and N are false. So L=T, M=T, K=F, N=F. Let's check if this satisfies the premises.

Premise 3: N ∨ K. N=F, K=F, so F∨F=F. So premise 3 is F, which can't be because we need premises to be true. So this can't be a counterexample.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false. So L=T, N=T, K=F, M=F.

Check premises:

Premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M. K=F, so F→M is T.

Premise 2: N → ~M. N=T, so ~M must be T, which is true because M=F.

Premise 3: N ∨ K. N=T, so T∨F=T.

So all premises are true. The conclusion L→K would be T→F=F. So yes, this is a valid counterexample. So option D seems to be correct.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I had L=T, K=F, N=T, M=F, which is the same as option D. So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me check option B again. Option B says L, M, N are T, K=F. So L=T, M=T, N=T, K=F.

Check premises:

Premise 1: (F ∧ T) → T. F→T=T.

Premise 2: N=T → ~M. But M=T, so ~M=F. So N=T→F=F. So premise 2 is F, which can't be because premises must be T. So option B isn't a valid counterexample.

So the correct counterexample is option D: L and N are T, K and M are F.

The argument is invalid, and the counterexample occurs when L and N are true, and K and M are false. This satisfies all premises while making the conclusion false.
