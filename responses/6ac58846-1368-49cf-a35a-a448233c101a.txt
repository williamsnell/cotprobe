Okay, so I have this question about the strength of a B1 field based on the duration of a 180-degree pulse. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR concepts, but let's try to work through this.

I remember that the B1 field is related to the RF pulses used in NMR. The duration of the pulse and the angle it creates are connected through some equations. I think the formula involves the resonance frequency and the strength of the B1 field.

Wait, the pulse angle θ (which is 180 degrees here) depends on the product of the B1 field strength (let's call it B1) and the pulse duration (τ). The formula I recall is θ = (γ * B1 * τ) / 2π, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. 

So, rearranging that formula to solve for B1, I get B1 = (θ * 2π) / (γ * τ). 

But wait, I don't remember the exact value of γ for protons. I think it's around 267.5 × 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1. Let me double-check that—yes, γ is approximately 2.675 × 10^8 rad/(T·s). 

The given pulse duration τ is 12.5 μs, which is 12.5 × 10^-6 seconds. The pulse angle θ is 180 degrees, which is π radians.

Plugging into the formula: B1 = (π * 2π) / (γ * τ) → Wait, no. Let me make sure. The formula is θ = (γ B1 τ) / (2π), so rearranged, B1 = (2 π θ) / (γ τ).

Wait, θ is in radians. So substituting the numbers: θ is π radians.

So B1 = (2 * π * π) / (γ * τ). Let's compute that.

First, calculate the numerator: 2 * π * π = 2 * (3.1416)^2 ≈ 2 * 9.8696 ≈ 19.7392.

Denominator: γ is 2.675e8 rad/(T·s), τ is 12.5e-6 s.

So denominator = 2.675e8 * 12.5e-6 = Let's compute that. 2.675e8 is 267500000, and 12.5e-6 is 0.0000125. Multiply them: 267500000 * 0.0000125 = Let's see, 267500000 * 1.25e-5.

Alternatively, 2.675e8 * 1.25e-5 = (2.675 * 1.25) × 10^(8-5) = 3.34375 × 10^3 = 3343.75.

So denominator is 3343.75.

So B1 = 19.7392 / 3343.75 ≈ 0.0059 T. Wait, that's 5.9e-3 T, but wait, the options are in 1e-4 T units. Wait, 0.0059 T is 5.9e-3 T, which is 59e-4 T. But looking at the options, the highest is 9.3e-4 T. Oh wait, no, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me check the formula again. Maybe I messed up the formula. Another approach: The formula for a 180-degree pulse is τ = (π * T2) / (γ B1), but I'm not sure about T2. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is that the pulse angle θ (in radians) is (γ B1 τ) / 2. So θ = (γ B1 τ) / 2. Therefore, B1 = (2 θ) / (γ τ).

Ah, that makes more sense. So θ here is π radians.

So B1 = (2 * π) / (γ * τ).

Let me compute that again.

Numerator: 2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

Denominator: γ τ = 2.675e8 rad/(T·s) * 12.5e-6 s = 2.675e8 * 1.25e-5 = Let me compute 2.675e8 * 1.25e-5.

2.675 * 1.25 = 3.34375. The exponents: 1e8 * 1e-5 = 1e3. So 3.34375e3 = 3343.75.

So B1 = 6.2832 / 3343.75 ≈ 0.001879 T, which is 1.879e-3 T, or 18.79e-4 T. Wait, but the options are all in the range of 3.8e-4 to 9.3e-4 T. Hmm, that suggests I might have messed up the formula.

Wait another thought: Maybe the formula uses the relation θ = γ B1 τ. No, I think that's for the rotation angle when considering the B1 field. Wait, perhaps θ = γ B1 τ. So for a 180-degree pulse, θ = π radians.

So B1 = θ / (γ τ) = π / (γ τ).

So let's compute that: π ≈3.1416.

γ τ = 2.675e8 * 12.5e-6 = same as before, 3343.75.

So B1 = 3.1416 / 3343.75 ≈ 0.000939 T = 9.39e-4 T. Looking at the options, option G is 9.3e-4 T. That's close. But wait, earlier I thought the formula was θ = (γ B1 τ)/2, but maybe I was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is θ = (γ B1 τ) * (something else). Let me think. The rotation angle θ in radians is given by θ = (γ B1 τ) * (something related to the pulse type). Wait, maybe the formula is θ = (γ B1 τ) / (2π) * 2π? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach. The standard formula for the pulse angle θ is θ = (γ B1 τ) / 2. So for 180 degrees, which is π radians, we have π = (γ B1 τ) / 2. So solving for B1: B1 = (2 π) / (γ τ).

So with γ = 2.675e8 rad/(T·s), τ = 12.5e-6 s.

So B1 = (2 * 3.1416) / (2.675e8 * 12.5e-6)

Compute denominator: 2.675e8 * 12.5e-6 = 2.675 * 12.5 * 1e2 = 33.4375 * 1e2 = 3343.75.

Numerator: 2 * 3.1416 ≈6.2832.

So B1 ≈6.2832 / 3343.75 ≈0.001879 T = 1.879e-3 T. Wait, that's 18.79e-4 T, but the options are all lower than that. Hmm, that can't be right because option G is 9.3e-4, which is about half of that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is θ = (γ B1 τ) / (2π) multiplied by 2π, but that's just θ=γ B1 τ. So for θ=π, B1= π/(γ τ).

So B1=3.1416/(2.675e8 * 12.5e-6) = 3.1416/(3343.75) ≈0.000939 T =9.39e-4 T. That's option G, which is 9.3e-4 T. But wait, earlier I thought the formula was θ= (γ B1 τ)/2, which would give B1= (2θ)/(γ τ). That would give about 0.001879 T, which is 1.879e-3 T, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct formula is θ=γ B1 τ, so B1=θ/(γ τ).

But wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I should double-check the formula.

After looking it up, I recall that the rotation angle θ is given by θ = (γ B1 τ) / (2π) * 2π, which simplifies to θ = γ B1 τ. So θ = γ B1 τ.

So for θ=π, B1= π/(γ τ).

Plugging the numbers: π ≈3.1416, γ=2.675e8, τ=12.5e-6.

So B1=3.1416/(2.675e8 *12.5e-6).

Compute denominator: 2.675e8 *12.5e-6 = 2.675 *12.5 *1e2 = 33.4375 *1e2=3343.75.

So B1=3.1416/3343.75 ≈0.000939 T=9.39e-4 T, which is option G:9.3e-4 T.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the formula was θ= (γ B1 τ)/2, I got about 1.879e-3 T, which isn't an option. But since option G is 9.3e-4, and that's what I get from θ=γ B1 τ, I think that's the correct approach. So the answer should be G.

The strength of the $\mathscr{B}_1$ field can be determined using the relationship between the pulse angle, the gyromagnetic ratio, and the pulse duration. The formula used is:

\[
\theta = \gamma \mathscr{B}_1 \tau
\]

Rearranging for $\mathscr{B}_1$:

\[
\mathscr{B}_1 = \frac{\theta}{\gamma \tau}
\]

Given:
- $\theta = 180^\circ = \pi$ radians,
- $\gamma = 2.675 \times 10^8 \, \text{rad/(T·s)}$ (gyromagnetic ratio for protons),
- $\tau = 12.5 \, \mu\text{s} = 12.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s}$.

Substituting the values:

\[
\mathscr{B}_1 = \frac{\pi}{(2.675 \times 10^8) \times (12.5 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
(2.675 \times 10^8) \times (12.5 \times 10^{-6}) = 3343.75
\]

Then, calculate the numerator:

\[
\pi \approx 3.1416
\]

So:

\[
\mathscr{B}_1 = \frac{3.1416}{3343.75} \approx 0.000939 \, \text{T} = 9.39 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{T}
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is **G: 9.3 $10^{-4} \, \text{T}$**.
