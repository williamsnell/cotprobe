Okay, so I've got this question here about renewable energy sources, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking which of the given options is a renewable energy source. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me list them out again to make sure I have them all straight:

A: Oil shale
B: Wood
C: Natural gas
D: Oil
E: Peat
F: Diesel
G: Gasoline
H: Propane
I: Coal
J: Uranium

Alright, first, I should remember what a renewable energy source is. Renewable energy refers to energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished over a short timescale. So, things like sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass are all examples of renewable energy sources because they don't deplete quickly and can be used sustainably.

Now, looking at the options, I need to determine which one fits into that category. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Oil shale. I think oil shale is a type of rock that contains kerogen, which is a source of oil when heated. But oil is a fossil fuel, right? So oil shale is processed to extract oil, which is a non-renewable resource. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Wood. Hmm, wood is interesting. I know that wood can be a renewable resource if it's sustainably harvested. Trees can be replanted, so as long as they're cut at a rate slower than they regrow, wood can be renewable. But wait, sometimes wood is used as a fuel, like for fireplaces or in some power plants. So does that make it renewable? Well, if the trees are being replanted, then yes, it's a renewable energy source. But I'm not entirely sure if it's considered renewable in all contexts. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: Natural gas. I know natural gas is a fossil fuel, just like oil and coal. It's formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms and takes millions of years to form. So it's definitely not renewable because it can't be replenished quickly enough by natural processes. So C is out.

Option D: Oil. Same as natural gas, oil is a fossil fuel. It's formed from the remains of plants and animals millions of years ago. It's non-renewable because we can't produce it quickly. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: Peat. Peat is a type of fuel, usually used in certain regions like Ireland or Scotland. It's made up of decomposed plant material that's been compressed over time. Peat is considered a fossil fuel because it's formed from organic matter over long periods. So E is non-renewable.

Option F: Diesel. Diesel is a type of fuel derived from petroleum, which is a fossil fuel. So F is non-renewable.

Option G: Gasoline. Again, gasoline is a product of petroleum refining, so it's a fossil fuel and non-renewable. G is out.

Option H: Propane. Propane is another hydrocarbon fuel, used for heating and cooking. It's extracted from natural gas or petroleum, so it's non-renewable. H is not the answer.

Option I: Coal. Coal is a well-known fossil fuel. It's used extensively for electricity generation. Since it's formed from ancient plant matter over millions of years, it's definitely non-renewable. So I is out.

Option J: Uranium. Uranium is a nuclear fuel used in nuclear power plants. It's a finite resource that doesn't replenish quickly enough to be considered renewable. So J is non-renewable.

So, looking back, the options are all non-renewable except maybe B: Wood. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes wood is considered a part of biomass, which is renewable. However, in some contexts, especially when it's not sustainably harvested, it might not be. But generally, wood is considered a renewable energy source because trees can be replanted. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: Wood, as it is considered a renewable energy source when sustainably harvested. All other options are non-renewable fossil fuels.

Answer: B
