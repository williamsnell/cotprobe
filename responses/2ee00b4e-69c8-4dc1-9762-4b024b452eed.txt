Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following memoir.
Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: "I do not know him"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, "He is a man I never see"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.
No one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.
He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.
â€”Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about King Louis XIV's weaknesses and regrets based on a memoir excerpt. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage describes Louis XIV as someone who expected everyone, especially those of distinction, to be continually at the court. He noticed who was absent and didn't tolerate people who came only for short visits. He would dismiss those he didn't see often, saying things like "I don't know him" or "He is a man I never see." It seems like he was very focused on appearances and maintaining a certain image at court.

He also valued splendor and magnificence, encouraging his courtiers to spend money on things like equipages, buildings, feasting, and even gambling. The author mentions that Louis XIV knew how to make favors seem valuable through his manner, using words, smiles, or even glances. However, he also notes that Louis made expensive habits fashionable, forcing courtiers to live beyond their means and become dependent on his bounty for subsistence. This suggests that he used his court's extravagance as a way to maintain control and dependency.

Now, looking at the options:

A: His inability to produce a male heir led to a succession crisis. I don't remember the passage mentioning anything about his heirs. The excerpt focuses more on his courtly behavior and administration, not family matters.

B: His insistence on religious uniformity led to civil unrest. The passage doesn't discuss religion much. It's more about courtly appearances and spending, so this might not be the right choice.

C: He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he didn't rule his country well. This seems relevant. The passage talks about how he focused on courtly rituals, who was present, and how he managed his courtiers. It implies he was very image-conscious but perhaps neglected actual governance.

D: His domination of the nobility left him without friends and allies. The passage does mention his control over the nobility, but it doesn't suggest he had no allies. Nobles were dependent on him, but he still maintained a court, so maybe he had some allies, just in a dependent way.

E: He left the administration to intendants. The memoir doesn't mention intendants, so I can't choose this based on the given text.

F: His lavish spending led to financial ruin. While he did encourage spending, the passage doesn't explicitly say this caused financial ruin. It might have contributed, but it's not the main point discussed.

G: Too focused on architecture, neglecting people. The passage does mention building projects (like Versailles), but the main issue seems to be about courtly appearances and control, not neglecting people's needs.

H: He was at war a lot, uniting others against him. The passage doesn't talk about his wars, so this might not be the right choice.

I: Failed to modernize the military. Again, the passage doesn't mention military matters, so this is unlikely.

J: Lack of interest in foreign affairs led to isolation. The passage doesn't discuss foreign affairs either.

So, the passage focuses on Louis XIV's meticulous control over courtly appearances, his use of ceremony, and how he managed his courtiers by making them dependent on his favors. He was very image-conscious and used ceremonies to maintain control, but this might have been a weakness because it diverted attention from effective governance. Therefore, option C seems to capture this weakness best: being too concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he didn't rule well.

Alternatively, option D talks about domination leaving him without friends. But the passage doesn't suggest he had no friends; rather, he had courtiers who were dependent on him. So C is more about his focus on appearances hindering his actual rule, which seems to align with the text.

The passage highlights Louis XIV's focus on courtly appearances, ceremonies, and maintaining control over his courtiers through elaborate rituals and dependency on his favors. This suggests that his preoccupation with these aspects may have diverted attention from effective governance, indicating a weakness in his rule.

Answer: C
