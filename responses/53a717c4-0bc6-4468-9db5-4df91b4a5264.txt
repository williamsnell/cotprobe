Question:

A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have "caught the same bug." Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2째C (98.9째F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?

Options:

A: Administer a tetanus shot
B: Prescribe azithromycin
C: Administer the meningococcal vaccine
D: Prescribe ibuprofen
E: Prescribe penicillin
F: Administer the pneumococcal vaccine
G: Prescribe amoxicillin
H: Prescribe doxycycline
I: Prescribe rifampin
J: No intervention is needed at this time

Okay, so I'm faced with this medical question about a 16-year-old girl who's worried she might have meningitis because her teammate was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. The girl is feeling well but is concerned. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: the patient's teammate was admitted to the hospital yesterday after being diagnosed. They were on a soccer trip a week ago, sharing a hotel room. Now, the patient is here because she's worried she might have caught it.

Looking at the patient's details: She's 16, has asthma, and uses inhaled albuterol. Her vital signs are slightly elevated temperature (37.2째C, which is 98.9째F), pulse 64 (a bit low but normal can vary), respirations 16 (normal), and blood pressure 107/58, which is a bit low but not critically so. The physical exam shows no abnormalities, so no signs of meningitis like stiff neck, rash, or confusion.

Meningococcal meningitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. It's contagious and can spread through close contact, which they had by sharing a hotel room. However, the incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is typically 2-10 days. Since they were together a week ago, it's within the possible incubation window, so the patient might be at risk.

But wait, the patient is asymptomatic. She's feeling well, no symptoms, so she doesn't have the disease right now. The question is about the most appropriate intervention at this time.

Looking at the options:

A: Tetanus shot. Tetanus is from Clostridium tetani, usually from wounds. Doesn't relate here.

B: Azithromycin. That's an antibiotic for different bacteria and some STDs. Not for meningococcus.

C: Meningococcal vaccine. That would provide immunity. But if she's already exposed, the vaccine might not prevent infection, but could it help? Or is it more for prevention in non-exposed individuals?

D: Ibuprofen. For pain or fever, but she's asymptomatic, so probably not needed.

E: Penicillin. Used for treatment, not prevention. She doesn't have the infection yet.

F: Pneumococcal vaccine. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, not Neisseria.

G: Amoxicillin. Another antibiotic, but again, for treatment, not prophylaxis.

H: Doxycycline. For other bacteria and infections, not meningococcus.

I: Rifampin. Used for TB and some other bacteria. Maybe as prophylaxis for meningococcus? I'm not sure, but I think it's more for other diseases.

J: No intervention needed. She's well, so maybe no action is needed unless there's a risk.

In meningococcal disease, when someone is exposed, like a close contact, the standard approach is to give prophylaxis to prevent infection. The usual prophylaxis is with antibiotics like rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin. But wait, the patient is asymptomatic and hasn't developed the disease yet. So the question is whether to give antibiotics to prevent it.

However, looking at the options, the available prophylactic options are I (rifampin) and maybe B (azithromycin). But the question is about the most appropriate intervention. Alternatively, the meningococcal vaccine could be considered, but vaccines are more for long-term prevention, not immediate post-exposure prophylaxis.

Wait, but the patient is 16. If she hasn't had the meningococcal vaccine before, maybe giving the vaccine now could help, but it's not immediate. The immediate prophylaxis would be antibiotics.

But in the options, I don't see ciprofloxacin or other common prophylaxis drugs. The options are limited to what's given. So among the choices, J says no intervention, which might be correct if she's well and the exposure is not high risk, but she was in close contact.

Alternatively, if the patient is a close contact, she should receive prophylactic antibiotics like rifampin or azithromycin. But looking at the options, I is rifampin, which would be appropriate. However, I'm not certain if the question expects the vaccine or no intervention.

Wait, but the patient's teammate was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. So the exposure is real. The standard practice is to give prophylaxis to close contacts, which includes roommates, within 24 hours. So in this case, the patient was a close contact, so she should get prophylactic antibiotics.

Looking at the options again, option I is rifampin, which is used for prophylaxis. So that would be the correct choice. Alternatively, sometimes amoxicillin is used, but usually for treatment, not prophylaxis.

So the most appropriate intervention would be to give rifampin as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Therefore, the answer should be I.

The patient is a 16-year-old girl who was a close contact of someone with meningococcal meningitis. She is asymptomatic but concerned about possible exposure. The most appropriate intervention is to provide prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection. Rifampin is a suitable choice for this purpose. 

Answer: I
