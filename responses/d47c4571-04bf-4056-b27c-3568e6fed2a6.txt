Okay, so I need to figure out whether the football player can successfully claim intentional infliction of emotional distress against the coach. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) is a tort claim. For someone to win, they need to show that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly, the defendant's actions were extreme and outrageous, the actions caused the plaintiff emotional distress, and the distress was severe.

Looking at the facts: The coach told the player he was despised and couldn't return. Then, when the player was leaving, the coach said, "Hope you decide to transfer, because everybody hates your guts around here." The player then wrote a suicide note blaming the coach, took an overdose, and was saved.

So, did the coach's actions meet the elements of IIED?

1. **Intentional or Reckless Action:** The coach's remarks seem intentional. He wasn't just joking; he was serious about the player not being welcome back. So that's probably covered.

2. **Extreme and Outrageous Conduct:** The key here is whether the coach's words went beyond all possible bounds of decency. Telling a player he's hated by everyone and encouraging him to transfer might be harsh, but is it extreme? Courts usually require more than just hurtful words. If the coach was just being tough, maybe it's not enough. But if he knew the player was vulnerable, maybe it crosses the line.

3. **Causation:** The player's emotional distress directly followed the coach's remarks. He wrote a suicide note, so it's clear the coach's words contributed to his state of mind.

4. **Severe Emotional Distress:** Attempting suicide is a strong indicator of severe distress, so that's met.

But wait, there's another factor: the foreseeability of the suicide. Did the coach know or should he have known that the player was at risk? The player was already feeling dejected after being dropped. So maybe the coach's harsh words pushed him over the edge, making the outcome foreseeable.

However, sometimes in these cases, the courts require more than just the defendant's words to be the sole cause. They might look at whether the coach had a duty to protect the player. But coaches usually don't have a duty to prevent self-harm unless they have a specific relationship that includes that responsibility, which might be the case here.

But another angle is whether the coach's remarks were the immediate cause of the distress or if other factors contributed. The player had already been dropped, which might have been a contributing factor. So was the coach's comment the last straw?

Also, the element of outrageousness: while harsh, were the coach's comments so extreme that they're beyond what's acceptable? Courts typically require more than just hurtful criticism. For example, if the coach had a history of bullying or if he acted with malice, it might qualify. But in this case, it's just a tough coach giving an ultimatum and a harsh goodbye.

I think the coach's actions might be seen as within the realm of locker room tough talk, even if it's harsh. Unless there's evidence that the coach knew the player was suicidal or mentally脆弱, the remarks might not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct required for IIED.

Additionally, the fact that the player attempted suicide might support the claim, but the coach's actions have to be the proximate cause. If the coach's words were a direct cause, then maybe. But if the player's decision was based on multiple factors, including being dropped from the team, it's possible the coach's liability is limited.

Another point: public figures or those in positions of authority might have a higher bar for IIED because their statements can be more impactful. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the player won't prevail because the coach's remarks don't meet the legal standard. That seems possible if the court finds the conduct not outrageous enough.

Option J says not prevail because the overdose was an unforeseen consequence. But if the coach should have known the player was vulnerable, it's foreseeable, so J might not be correct.

Option F says the player would prevail because the coach's remarks were intended to inflict distress and caused the attempt. But if the conduct isn't outrageous, even if intended, it doesn't meet IIED.

So, considering all this, the coach's remarks might not be considered extreme enough for IIED. Therefore, the player likely won't prevail. So the answer might be I or J, but I think I is more accurate because the remarks don't meet the outrageousness standard.

The football player's claim against the coach for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) hinges on whether the coach's actions meet the legal criteria for IIED. The key elements required for IIED include intentional or reckless conduct, extreme and outrageous behavior, causation, and severe emotional distress. While the coach's remarks were harsh and contributed to the player's emotional state, they may not rise to the level of "extreme and outrageous" conduct necessary for an IIED claim. Courts typically require more than hurtful words, and the coach's comments, though impactful, might be seen as within the realm of tough locker room talk. Additionally, the player's suicide attempt could be considered an unforeseen consequence of the coach's remarks, further weakening the claim. Therefore, the player is unlikely to prevail.
