Question:

A psychologist conducts an experiment in which subjects are asked to learn a series of “facts” which are actually statements that have been fabricated by the research team. The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?
I. The amount the subjects were compensated.
II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.
III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.
IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.

Options:

A: I and II only
B: III only
C: I, II, and III only
D: II, III, and IV only
E: I and IV only
F: I and III and IV only
G: I, III, and IV only
H: II and IV only
I: II only
J: I, II, and IV only

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which variables are dependent in this psychology experiment. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, the experiment involves subjects learning fabricated facts. The subjects are undergrads at a university. They're randomly assigned to groups with different conditions. The independent variables here would be the factors that the researchers are manipulating, right? And the dependent variables are what they're measuring as outcomes.

Looking at the variables mentioned:

1. The amount subjects were compensated: That's either $10 or $20. Since the researchers are assigning different amounts, this is an independent variable. They're testing how compensation affects recall.

2. The room where they recall the facts: It's either the same room or a different, unfamiliar one. This is another independent variable because the researchers are changing the environment to see its effect on recall.

3. The number of facts recalled: This is what they're measuring. How many facts each subject gets right. So this must be a dependent variable because it's the outcome they're interested in.

4. The time given to learn the facts: 15 or 30 minutes. The researchers are varying this time, so it's an independent variable.

So, the dependent variable is only the number of facts recalled, which is option III. The others are independent because they're manipulated by the experimenters.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question asks which are dependent variables. So only III is dependent. The others (I, II, IV) are independent variables. So looking back at the options, option B is III only. Yeah, that makes sense.

The dependent variable in the experiment is the number of facts the subjects can recall, as it is the outcome being measured. The other variables are independent variables manipulated by the researchers.

Answer: B
