Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat conduction through a copper kettle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. The kettle's bottom is circular, 6.0 inches in diameter, and 0.062 inches thick. The outer surface temperature is 214°F, and the water is at boiling point, which I think is 212°F. The question is asking how much heat is conducted through the bottom in 5 seconds. The thermal conductivity is given as 2480 Btu/(ft²·hr·°F/in). The options are from A to J, with various Btu values.

Alright, so I remember that the formula for heat conduction through a solid is Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d, where:
- Q is the heat conducted,
- k is the thermal conductivity,
- A is the area,
- ΔT is the temperature difference,
- t is the time,
- d is the thickness.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might have that formula a bit off. Let me double-check. Oh right, the formula is actually Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d. Yes, that's right. So I need to calculate each of these variables.

Let's start with the area A. The diameter is 6 inches, so the radius is half of that, which is 3 inches. The area of a circle is πr². So A = π*(3)^2 = 9π square inches. Let me calculate that: 9 * π ≈ 9 * 3.1416 ≈ 28.274 square inches. But wait, units are in square inches, and the thermal conductivity is given per square foot. Oh right, I need to convert square inches to square feet because the units in k are Btu/(ft²·hr·°F·in). So 1 square foot is 144 square inches. So to convert A to square feet, I divide by 144. So A ≈ 28.274 / 144 ≈ 0.1963 square feet.

Next, the temperature difference ΔT. The outer surface is 214°F, and the inner (water) is at boiling point, 212°F. So ΔT = 214 - 212 = 2°F. That's a small difference, but it's there.

The time t is 5 seconds. But the thermal conductivity is per hour, so I need to convert seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so t = 5 / 3600 hours ≈ 0.001389 hours.

The thickness d is 0.062 inches. Since the thermal conductivity is per inch, I can use this as is.

Now, let's plug everything into the formula:

Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d

Plugging in the numbers:

k = 2480 Btu/(ft²·hr·°F·in)
A = 0.1963 ft²
ΔT = 2 °F
t = 0.001389 hr
d = 0.062 in

So:

Q = (2480 * 0.1963 * 2 * 0.001389) / 0.062

Let me compute the numerator first: 2480 * 0.1963 ≈ 2480 * 0.1963. Hmm, 2480 * 0.2 is 496, but since it's 0.1963, a bit less. Let me compute 2480 * 0.1963.

2480 * 0.1963 = 2480 * (0.1 + 0.09 + 0.0063) = 2480*0.1=248, 2480*0.09=223.2, 2480*0.0063≈15.744. Adding them up: 248 + 223.2 = 471.2 +15.744≈486.944.

Then multiply by 2 (ΔT): 486.944 * 2 ≈ 973.888.

Multiply by t (0.001389): 973.888 * 0.001389 ≈ Let me compute 973.888 * 0.001 = 0.973888, and 973.888 * 0.000389≈0.3795. So total ≈ 0.973888 + 0.3795 ≈ 1.3534.

Now divide by d (0.062 in): 1.3534 / 0.062 ≈ 21.83.

Wait, that's around 21.83 Btu. Looking at the options, the closest is I:22 Btu and G:24, and others. Let me check my calculations again, maybe I made an error somewhere.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator step by step.

A = π*(3)^2 = 9π ≈28.2743 in². To convert to ft²: 28.2743 / 144 ≈ 0.1963 ft². That seems correct.

ΔT is 2°F, correct.

t =5s =5/3600 ≈0.001389 hr.

d=0.062 in.

So Q= (2480 * 0.1963 * 2 * 0.001389) / 0.062.

Let me compute each part step by step:

Compute 2480 * 0.1963 first:
2480 * 0.1963 = let's compute 2480 * 0.1963.

Let me do it as:

0.1963 = 0.1 + 0.09 + 0.0063.

So 2480 *0.1=248.

2480*0.09= 2480*9*0.01= 22320*0.01=223.2

2480*0.0063= Let's compute 2480 * 6.3e-3 = 2480 *6.3 /1000.

2480 *6.3 = ?

2480 *6=14,880; 2480 *0.3=744. So total 14,880 +744=15,624.

Divide by 1000: 15.624.

So total 248 +223.2 +15.624= 248+223.2=471.2+15.624=486.824.

Then multiply by 2 (ΔT): 486.824 *2=973.648.

Multiply by t (0.001389): 973.648 *0.001389.

Let me compute 973.648 *0.001=0.973648.

973.648 *0.000389= Let's compute 973.648 *3.89e-4.

First, 973.648 *3e-4= 0.2920944

973.648 *0.089e-4= 973.648 *0.000089= approx 0.0868.

So total ≈0.2920944 +0.0868≈0.3789.

So total of 0.973648 +0.3789≈1.3525.

Now divide by 0.062: 1.3525 /0.062 ≈21.814.

So around 21.814 Btu. Looking at the options, I:22 Btu is the closest. So the answer should be I:22 Btu.
