Okay, so I need to figure out what colors the two circles are in the MasterCard logo. I'm a bit unsure, but I'll try to recall what I know about the logo.

I remember that MasterCard's logo is pretty iconic. It has those two overlapping circles, right? But wait, what colors are they? Let me think. I think one is red and the other is blue, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, could they both be red? No, that doesn't seem right because I remember seeing different colors.

Wait, maybe it's red and yellow? I'm not sure. Or perhaps one is red and the other is black? Hmm, no, that doesn't ring a bell. I think the main colors I associate with MasterCard are red and blue. Oh, but sometimes the logos have other colors too, like gold or something. But the two main circles... I think red and blue are the primary ones.

Let me visualize the logo. It's two overlapping circles, and the word MasterCard is written inside. The colors, if I'm not mistaken, are red and blue. So looking at the options, option D is red and blue. That must be the correct answer.
