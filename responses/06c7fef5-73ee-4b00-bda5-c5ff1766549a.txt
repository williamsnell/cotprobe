Question:

A healthy 22-year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism. At the beginning of the study, his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range. He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?

Options:

A: Increased glucose uptake by the brain
B: Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal
C: Increased glucose uptake by red blood cells
D: Glucose release from skeletal muscle
E: Glycogenolysis in the liver
F: Increased leptin release from adipose tissues
G: Enhanced gluconeogenesis in the kidney
H: Elevated insulin secretion from the pancreas

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about glucose metabolism. Let me read it again carefully.

The scenario is a healthy 22-year-old man participating in a study. Initially, his serum glucose is within normal range. He eats an 800-calorie meal with protein, fat, and carbs. Then he sleeps without eating or drinking more. Twelve hours later, his glucose is still normal. The question is asking which mechanism is most likely maintaining his serum glucose level.

Hmm, so after eating, his body processes the food. The meal has carbs, which are broken down into glucose. Right after eating, his blood sugar would rise, and insulin would be released to help cells take in the glucose. But he sleeps for 12 hours, so that's a long time without eating.

What happens during fasting? I remember that when you don't eat, your body uses stored glucose. The liver plays a big role here. The liver has glycogen stored, which is broken down into glucose through glycogenolysis. Also, when blood sugar drops, the liver can produce glucose via gluconeogenesis, using amino acids and other substrates.

Looking at the options:

A: Increased glucose uptake by the brain. Well, the brain does use a lot of glucose, but if he's slept through the night, maybe his body is conserving glucose. But I'm not sure if this is the main mechanism here.

B: Continued gut absorption. After 12 hours, I think the gut would have finished absorbing the meal. The gut doesn't keep absorbing that long, right? So maybe this isn't it.

C: Increased red blood cell uptake. Red blood cells need glucose too, but again, not sure if this is the main factor in maintaining serum levels over 12 hours.

D: Glucose release from skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles store glycogen, but I think they can only release a limited amount. The liver is the main organ for releasing glucose during fasting.

E: Glycogenolysis in the liver. This makes sense. The liver breaks down glycogen into glucose, releasing it into the blood to maintain levels.

F: Increased leptin. Leptin is related to satiety and long-term regulation, not immediate glucose control. So probably not the main mechanism here.

G: Enhanced gluconeogenesis in the kidney. The kidneys can produce glucose, but I think the liver is the primary source for maintaining blood sugar. Also, gluconeogenesis might be part of it, but maybe not the main process.

H: Elevated insulin. During fasting, insulin levels should decrease because you're not eating. Insulin promotes storage, so when fasting, glucagon and other hormones like epinephrine increase to release glucose.

So, thinking about this, after the meal, the initial rise in glucose is handled by insulin. Then, during the night, the body needs to maintain glucose. The liver uses glycogenolysis to break down stored glycogen into glucose. Once glycogen stores are depleted, gluconeogenesis would kick in, but the question says his glucose is still normal after 12 hours. So maybe it's still in the phase where glycogen is being used.

Wait, but how long does glycogen last? Liver glycogen is usually enough to last about 12-24 hours. So after 12 hours, he's probably still in the glycogenolysis phase. So the most likely mechanism is E: Glycogenolysis in the liver.
</think>

The correct answer is E: Glycogenolysis in the liver. After consuming a meal, the body processes carbohydrates into glucose, which is regulated by insulin. During the 12-hour fasting period, the liver maintains serum glucose levels by breaking down stored glycogen into glucose through glycogenolysis. This process ensures a steady supply of glucose to the body, particularly the brain, while fasting. Other options, such as continued gut absorption or increased insulin secretion, are less likely during this extended fasting period.

Answer: E
