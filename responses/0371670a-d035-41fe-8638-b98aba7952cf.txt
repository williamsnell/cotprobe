B: $1,440
C: $1,000
D: $300
E: $960
F: $600
G: $1,200

Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation methods. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question says the Five Star Hotel put down $3,000 worth of carpeting, which is supposed to last five years. They used the declining-balance method for depreciation. I need to find out the depreciation for the second year.

Wait, so the first thing I remember is that declining-balance depreciation isn't the same as straight-line. Right, straight-line is when you spread the cost evenly over the useful life. But declining-balance uses a multiple of the straight-line rate, which means it's a bit faster. Like, you might be using a rate like 200% or 150% of the straight-line rate.

But wait, the question doesn't specify the rate. Oh, right, in some contexts, the rate is a fixed multiple, like 100%. Wait, no. Wait, the question doesn't give any specific rate, so maybe I'm supposed to assume it's the straight-line method? Or perhaps the rate is 200% declining balance.

Wait, no. The question is about using the declining-balance method, so I think the rate is a multiple, like 200% or 150% of the straight-line rate. But since the question doesn't provide the rate, maybe it's implied to be a straight-line approach? Wait, no, because the question says "declining-balance method," so I should stick with that.

Wait, but without knowing the rate, how can I compute the second year's depreciation? Oh wait, maybe the question is asking if the rate is 200% or the straight-line rate. Because if it's 200%, then for the first year, the depreciation would be 200% of the initial cost. But wait, the initial cost is $3,000. 200% of $3k is $6k. But the carpet only lasts five years, so that can't be right because you can't have more depreciation than the asset's cost. So maybe the rate is 100%, so it's straight-line.

Wait, but the problem says it's using the declining-balance method. So perhaps the rate is 100% per year. Then, the first year's depreciation would be $3,000 * 100% = $3,000. But that's more than the value, which can't be. Hmm, maybe the rate is 200%? Let's see: 3000 * 200% is 6000, which is way higher than the asset's value. That's impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is simplified, and they just want the straight-line method's second year's depreciation. Because the question says it's using the declining-balance, but without knowing the rate, perhaps the intended approach is to use straight-line. Because otherwise, the rate isn't given, so it's not possible to calculate with the information provided.

So, assuming it's straight-line, the annual depreciation would be total cost divided by useful life. The total cost is $3,000, useful life five years. So annual depreciation is 3000/5= $600 per year. So the second year would also be $600. But wait, looking at the options, option F is $600. But wait, the options are A to J, and I'm looking for the second year. So the second year's depreciation is $600.

Wait, but wait another thing. If it's declining balance without a specified rate, perhaps the rate is 200% of straight-line? Let me think. Straight-line rate would be 1/5 = 20%. So 200% of that would be 40% per period. So first year: 3000 * 40% = 1200. Second year: 3000 - 1200 = 1800 left. Depreciation is 40% of 1800, which is 720. Third year: 1800 * 40% = 720, so 1080 left. Fourth year: 720 *40% = 288, so 792 left. Fifth year: 720 *40% = 288, so 504 left. But wait, that's a lot. 

But wait, the options include $720 (option H) as the second year's depreciation. Oh, but that would only be the case if the rate is 40%. But the problem didn't specify the rate, so I'm not sure. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the straight-line method, as the question mentions the declining-balance method, which typically doesn't require a specified rate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the straight-line method, and I'm supposed to compute that, leading to option F, $600. Because the options don't have the declining balance method's calculation unless you have a given rate.

Wait, but in the problem statement, is there any other information? The carpeting is put down, worth $3000 for five years. So perhaps the initial cost is $3000. If it's using the straight-line method, the annual depreciation is $600. So the second year is also $600, which would be option F. But wait, looking at the options, F is $600, but let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: $900

B: $1,440

C: $1,000

D: $300

E: $960

F: $600

G: $1,200

H: $720

I: $1,800

J: $480

So if the straight-line method is used, the annual depreciation is 3000/5=600. So second year would be 600, which is F. But wait, the question is about using the declining balance method. Oh, perhaps I should use the declining balance method, but without a rate. So maybe the question is intended to be straight-line.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a 200% declining balance rate, so 6000, but that's impossible. So perhaps the correct approach is to use straight-line.

Wait, but the options don't include 600, but F is 600. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but wait! Another angle: perhaps the question considers the cost as $3000 and uses straight-line. Then, the second year's depreciation is $600, which is option F. So the correct answer would be F.
</think>

The question involves calculating the second year's depreciation using the declining-balance method. However, without a specified rate, the problem cannot be precisely solved. Assuming the method intended is the straight-line method (as it's more straightforward and aligns with typical accounting practices when the rate isn't specified), the annual depreciation is $3,000 divided by 5 years, equaling $600 per year. Therefore, the second year's depreciation is $600, which corresponds to option F.
