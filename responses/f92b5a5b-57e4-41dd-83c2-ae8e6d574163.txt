Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about magnetic poles and the force between them. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my magnetism, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there's a magnetic south pole with a strength of 15 units placed 10 cm away from another pole, and the repulsion experienced is 300 dynes. I need to find out what kind of pole the second one is and its strength.

Wait, I remember that magnetic poles attract or repel each other based on their polarity. Like poles repel, opposite attract. So if the first pole is a south pole and they're repelling, the second must also be a south pole. Because south repels south, north repels north. So that narrows it down to options where the second is a south pole. Looking at the options, A, C, D, H, J have south poles. The others can be eliminated because they're north.

Now, the formula for the magnetic force between two poles is F = (k * m1 * m2) / r², right? Where F is the force, k is Coulomb's constant for magnetism, m1 and m2 are the pole strengths, and r is the distance between them. Oh wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. The force is given in dynes, and the distance is in centimeters. I think the formula in cgs units (which I think this is) is F = (k * m1 * m2) / r², where k is 1 in cgs units when using the right units for force, distance, and pole strength.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think in the cgs system, the formula might be F = (m1 * m2) / r², because the units would work out. Let me check: m1 and m2 are in units of magnetic pole strength, which I think in cgs is called the Gilbert. But in this problem, the units are just 'units strength' so maybe I can treat them as unitless for the calculation.

So F = (m1 * m2) / r². The given F is 300 dynes, m1 is 15 units, r is 10 cm. So plugging in the numbers: 300 = (15 * m2) / (10)^2. Wait, because 10 cm is 0.1 meters, but wait, no, in cgs units, 10 cm is 10 cm, so r² is (10)^2 = 100 cm².

So rearranging the formula: m2 = (F * r²) / m1. Plugging the numbers in: m2 = (300 * 100) / 15. Let's compute that: 300 * 100 = 30,000. Divide by 15: 30,000 /15 = 2000. So m2 is 2000 units.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if the formula is correct. Another thought: sometimes the formula includes a factor like the permeability of the medium, but in air, which is what the problem states, the permeability is μ0, which in cgs units is 1. So maybe the formula still holds without any additional constants. So yeah, F = (m1 * m2)/r².

So m2 is 2000 units. Now, since the force is repulsion, the second pole must be a south pole, as I thought earlier. So looking at the options, the second pole is a south pole with 2000 units strength. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option D is "South pole, 2000 poles". Option H is "South pole, 2500 poles". Option J is "South pole, 3000 poles". Wait, in my calculation, I got 2000. So which option matches that?

Yes, option D says "South pole, 2000 poles". So the answer should be D.
</think>

The problem involves two magnetic poles in air, with a south pole of 15 units strength experiencing a repulsion of 300 dynes when placed 10 cm away from another pole. Since the force is repulsion, the second pole must also be a south pole. Using the formula \( F = \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2} \), where \( F = 300 \, \text{dynes} \), \( m_1 = 15 \, \text{units} \), and \( r = 10 \, \text{cm} \), we solve for \( m_2 \):

\[
m_2 = \frac{F \cdot r^2}{m_1} = \frac{300 \cdot 100}{15} = 2000 \, \text{units}.
\]

Thus, the second pole is a south pole with a strength of 2000 units.
