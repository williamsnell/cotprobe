Okay, so I've got this question about Nathanson's form of retributivism, and I need to figure out which of the options is not required. Let me start by recalling what I know about retributivism. From what I remember, retributivism is a theory of punishment that suggests that the punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed. It's often contrasted with utilitarianism, which focuses on the outcomes and consequences of the punishment.

Nathanson, if I'm not mistaken, is a proponent of retributivism. I think he might have proposed a system where crimes are ranked based on their seriousness, and then corresponding punishments are assigned accordingly. So, for example, more serious crimes would lead to more severe punishments.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A list of crimes ranked according to their seriousness. That sounds like something a retributivist would support because they believe in proportionality based on the crime's severity.

Option B: A scale of punishments that correspond to the seriousness of certain crimes. Again, this aligns with the idea of proportional punishment, so this is likely included in Nathanson's model.

Option C: Treating criminals humanely. Hmm, this is interesting. Retributivism, as I understand it, focuses on just desertsâ€”punishing criminals because they deserve it. But does that necessarily mean anything about how they're treated? I think some retributivists might argue that even while offenders deserve punishment, they should still be treated humanely. Wait, but I'm not sure if Nathanson specifically includes this in his model. Maybe he focuses more on the desert aspect without explicitly stating humane treatment as a requirement.

Option D: The death penalty for the most serious crimes. This makes sense because the most serious crimes would require the most severe punishment, which in some cases could be the death penalty. So Nathanson might support this as part of his retributive scale.

The question is asking what Nathanson's retributivism requires except. So, the one that's not required. If I'm right that Nathanson's model is about proportionate punishment based on crime severity, then treating criminals humanely (Option C) might not be a required element. Because retributivism is more about the deserved punishment rather than the conditions of treatment during incarceration or punishment.

Wait, but I should think again. Do retributivists generally care about humane treatment? Some might argue that even if punishment is deserved, it shouldn't involve torture or inhumane conditions. But maybe Nathanson's version doesn't explicitly require humane treatment as part of his retributive theory. His focus is on the proportionality and the desert, not necessarily on the humanity of the treatment.

So, putting it together, the exception would be Option C: treating criminals humanely. Because while that's a good principle, it's not something that retributivism per se requires, at least according to Nathanson's model.

The question asks which element is not required by Nathanson's form of retributivism. Retributivism focuses on proportionate punishment based on the seriousness of the crime. Nathanson's model likely includes ranking crimes and assigning corresponding punishments, possibly including the death penalty for the most serious crimes. However, treating criminals humanely is not a core requirement of retributivism, as the emphasis is on deserved punishment rather than humane treatment conditions.

Answer: C
