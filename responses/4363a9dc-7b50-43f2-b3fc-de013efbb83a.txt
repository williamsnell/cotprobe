Okay, so I've got this question about biocentrism, and I need to figure out which option correctly defines it. Let me start by recalling what I know about biocentrism.

Biocentrism is an ethical theory that focuses on the value of life. From what I remember, it's different from other theories like anthropocentrism, which puts humans at the center, or ecocentrism, which focuses on ecosystems. Biocentrism seems to prioritize living beings themselves. 

The question asks what biocentrism is the view that, and the options are from A to J. Let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says that ecosystems are the primary bearers of direct moral standing because of their functional integrity. Wait, that sounds more like ecocentrism. I think biocentrism is more about individual organisms rather than ecosystems as a whole. So probably not A.

Option B states that only humans have direct moral standing. That's definitely not right because biocentrism considers other living beings as well, not just humans. So B is out.

Option C claims individual species are the primary bearers. Hmm, I'm not sure. Biocentrism is more about individual organisms, not species as a whole. So maybe C isn't the right choice.

Option D says only beings that can feel pain matter. That sounds more like a sentocentric view or perhaps related to utilitarianism, focusing on pain and pleasure. Biocentrism is broader than that, so D might not be it.

Option E suggests that all beings, because they exist, have direct moral standing. That sounds too broad. I remember that biocentrism specifically includes living beings, not necessarily all existing things like rocks or machines. So E might not be correct.

Option F states only conscious beings have moral standing. Again, that's more like a specific subset, and biocentrism includes all living organisms regardless of consciousness. So F is probably not the answer.

Option G says only humans and animals. Well, biocentrism might include all living beings, not just humans and animals. For example, plants and other organisms too. So G might be limiting it too much.

Option H claims all and only sentient creatures. Sentient beings can feel and perceive, but biocentrism includes all life, not just those that are sentient. So H is too restrictive.

Option I says all living beings because they are living. That aligns with what I thought earlier. Biocentrism centers on life, so every living being has moral standing because they are alive. That makes sense.

Option J includes all beings, living or non-living. That would mean rocks and other non-living things have moral standing, which I don't think biocentrism supports. It's more about life, so J is likely incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: all living beings, because they are living, possess direct moral standing.

The correct answer is I: all living beings, because they are living, possess direct moral standing.
