Okay, so I've got this problem about a circle inscribed inside a square, and I need to find the area of the square. The equation of the circle is given as 2x² = -2y² + 12x - 4y + 20. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can figure it out step by step.

First, I remember that the general equation of a circle is usually in the form (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. But the given equation isn't in that form, so I need to rearrange and complete the squares for both x and y terms.

Let me start by rewriting the equation. The original equation is 2x² = -2y² + 12x - 4y + 20. Wait, that's 2x² equals a bunch of terms. Maybe I should move all terms to one side to make it easier to handle. Let me do that.

So, adding 2y² to both sides and subtracting 12x, adding 4y, and subtracting 20 from both sides to get everything on the left:

2x² + 2y² - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0.

Hmm, but this still looks messy. Maybe I can factor out the coefficients of the squared terms to make completing the square easier. The coefficients of x² and y² are both 2, so let's factor that out from the respective terms:

2(x² - 6x) + 2(y² + 2y) - 20 = 0.

Wait, that's better. Let me write that again:

2(x² - 6x) + 2(y² + 2y) = 20.

Now, I can divide both sides by 2 to simplify things:

x² - 6x + y² + 2y = 10.

Okay, now it's a bit simpler. Now, I need to complete the square for the x terms and the y terms.

Starting with the x terms: x² - 6x. To complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is -6, so half is -3, and then square it: (-3)²=9. So I add 9 inside the equation for the x terms.

Similarly, for the y terms: y² + 2y. Half of 2 is 1, and squaring that gives 1. So I add 1 for the y terms.

But wait, since I'm adding these numbers inside the equation, I have to balance the equation by adding them to the other side as well. Let me write this out:

(x² - 6x + 9) + (y² + 2y + 1) = 10 + 9 + 1.

Simplifying that:

(x - 3)² + (y + 1)² = 20.

Oh, okay, so now the equation is in standard form. The center of the circle is at (3, -1), and the radius is sqrt(20). Wait, sqrt(20) can be simplified. Since 20 is 4*5, sqrt(4*5)=2*sqrt(5). So the radius is 2√5.

Now, the circle is inscribed inside a square. When a circle is inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Because the circle touches all four sides of the square, so the diameter spans from one side to the opposite side.

So, the diameter of the circle is twice the radius. The radius is 2√5, so diameter is 2*(2√5) = 4√5. Therefore, the side length of the square is 4√5.

Now, the area of the square is side length squared. So, (4√5)² = 16 * 5 = 80.

Wait, let me double-check that. (4√5)^2 is 4²*(√5)^2 = 16*5=80. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option G is 80. So the area of the square is 80.

The circle's equation is rewritten and simplified to standard form, revealing a radius of 2√5. The diameter, equal to the square's side length, is 4√5. The area of the square is (4√5)² = 80.

Answer: G
