Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with remainders and what happens when a grantor's heirs' remainder becomes invalid. Hmm, I remember that in property law, when someone conveys land, they can create future interests. One of those is a remainder, which is the right that follows after a prior estate has ended. 

The question is about a situation where the grantor's heirs have a remainder, but that remainder is invalid. So what happens then? I think when a remainder is invalid, it doesn't pass on, and instead, it reverts back to the grantor. Wait, but the grantor is the one who created the interest in the first place. So if their heirs' remainder is invalid, does it become a reversion in the grantor? 

I'm trying to remember the different doctrines related to this. There's the Doctrine of Lapse, which I think deals with when a person's interest fails because they die without a valid will or without a valid devisee. So if someone dies and their heir's remainder is invalid, maybe that's when the Doctrine of Lapse applies. That would cause the interest to lapse back to the grantor. 

Wait, but I also recall the Doctrine of Escheat, which is when property goes back to the state because there's no heir. But that's more about the state taking the property, not the grantor. So probably not that.

Then there's the Rule in Shelley's Case, which is about when a grant creates a life estate followed by the grantor's heirs. It says that if the grantor's interest is to their heirs, it's treated as a remainder in fee simple. But I'm not sure how that ties into the remainder becoming a reversion.

The Doctrine of Merger involves a situation where an estate is held by the same person in severalty, causing the future interest to terminate. But that seems different from what's happening here.

The Rule Against Perpetuities is about whether a future interest is valid if it might vest too remotely in the future. If the remainder is invalid under this rule, it would fail, but I'm not sure if that's the same as reverting to the grantor.

The Doctrine of Worthier Title is about which future interest is better when two are possible, but I'm not sure that's directly related here.

So putting it together, when a remainder in the grantor's heirs is invalid, it must revert back to the grantor. The Doctrine of Lapse is the one that deals with the failure of a remainder because the heir can't take it, so it lapses and goes back to the grantor. That makes sense because the grantor was the one who created the interest in the first place, and if the heirs can't take it, it goes back to them.

The correct answer is when a remainder in the grantor's heirs becomes invalid, it reverts back to the grantor due to the failure of the heir's interest. This situation is governed by the Doctrine of Lapse, which causes the invalid remainder to lapse and return to the grantor.
