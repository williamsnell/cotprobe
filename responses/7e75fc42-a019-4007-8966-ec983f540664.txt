Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car battery and the current it supplies to the starter motor. The question is asking how much charge passes through the starter in half a minute. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, I remember that current is related to charge and time. The basic formula that comes to mind is I = Q / t, where I is current, Q is charge, and t is time. So, if I rearrange this formula to solve for charge, it would be Q = I * t. That makes sense because charge is just the amount of current flowing over a period of time.

The problem states that the current I is 50 amps, and the time t is half a minute. Wait, half a minute is 30 seconds, right? So t is 30 seconds. Now I need to plug these values into the formula.

Let me write that down: Q = 50 A * 30 s. Multiplying those together gives 1500 amp-seconds. Oh wait, amp-seconds is the same as coulombs. So the charge Q is 1500 coulombs.

Looking at the options, option D is 1500 coul. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 50 times 30 is indeed 1500, so yeah, I think I'm confident with that.

The question involves calculating the charge passed through the starter motor using the formula \( Q = I \times t \), where \( I = 50 \, \text{A} \) and \( t = 30 \, \text{s} \). Multiplying these gives \( 1500 \, \text{C} \), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
