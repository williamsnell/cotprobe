Okay, so I need to figure out what Baier argues about genuine moral rules. The question is a multiple-choice with options A through J. I'm a bit rusty on Baier's philosophy, so let me think this through.

First, I remember that Baier is associated with moral rationalism, which suggests that moral rules are derived from reason. He might argue that moral rules need to be based on something universal rather than just individual feelings or societal norms. 

Looking at the options:

A: Must take into account all living beings. That sounds broad, but I'm not sure if Baier goes that far. Maybe he's more about human beings?

B: All sentient beings. That's similar to A but focuses on sentience. I'm not certain if Baier includes all sentient beings or just humans.

C: Preserve the natural environment. That seems more like an environmental ethics perspective, which I don't think is Baier's main point.

D: Align with societal norms. I think Baier's approach is more about reason than just following what society expects.

E: Based solely on religion. No, Baier is a rationalist, so he probably relies more on reason than religious doctrines.

F: For the good of human beings. This sounds plausible. Maybe Baier thinks moral rules should benefit humans as a whole.

G: Universally applicable regardless of culture. This seems like a key point. If something is a genuine moral rule, it should apply everywhere, not just in a specific culture.

H: Only individual's interests. That's more of an egoism perspective, which I don't think Baier supports.

I: Primarily self-interest. Again, self-interest isn't the basis for Baier's moral rules.

J: Only applicable if chosen. That doesn't make sense for genuine rules; they should have applicability beyond just personal choice.

So, narrowing it down, options F and G seem strong. F is about human good, G is about universal applicability. Baier's rationalism suggests that moral rules should be universal and based on reason, not just human benefit. Wait, but does he focus on human beings specifically?

Wait, I think Baier's moral rules are based on what is necessary for human well-being, but also that they should be universally applicable. But the question is about what the rules must be. So G is about applicability, F is about the end goal.

Wait, the question is asking what Baier argues genuine moral rules are. If I recall correctly, Baier emphasizes that moral principles must be applicable to everyone, meaning they should be universal. So G might be the answer. Alternatively, F is about human good, which could also be correct.

Hmm, maybe I should think more about Baier's specific arguments. I remember that Baier's critique of emotivism and his defense of moral rationalism suggests that moral statements are genuine if they are based on reasons that can be accepted by any rational person. So the rules must be applicable to all, hence universal.

So G: should be universally applicable regardless of cultural differences. That makes sense. It's about the universality of moral rules, which aligns with Baier's rationalist approach.

The correct answer is **G**. Baier argues that genuine moral rules should be universally applicable regardless of cultural differences, reflecting his emphasis on rational and objective moral principles.

**Answer: G**
