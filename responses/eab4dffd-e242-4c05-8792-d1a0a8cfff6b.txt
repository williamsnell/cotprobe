Okay, so I've got this question here about which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass. The options are A through J, including organs like intestines, heart, lungs, kidney, liver, brain, stomach, skin, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Hmm, I need to figure out which one uses the least energy relative to its weight.

First, I remember that some organs are more metabolically active than others. The brain, for example, uses a lot of energy despite its relatively small size. I think it's something like 20% of the body's total energy. Then there's the heart, which is always beating, so it must use a fair amount too. The liver is another organ that's quite active, processing all sorts of stuff.

Wait, I think the skin might be a contender here. Skin is the largest organ, but I'm not sure how much energy it uses. Maybe it's not as high as the brain or heart. Then there's skeletal muscle, which can vary depending on activity levels. When resting, muscles don't use as much energy, but if you're active, that changes.

The pancreas is involved in digestion and hormone production, so it's probably not the lowest. The stomach, intestines, and lungs—I'm a bit fuzzy on their energy expenditure. I think the lungs are involved in respiration, which is a big process, but maybe they don't use as much energy as the heart or brain.

Kidneys are important for filtering blood, so they must use some energy. Liver is high because of all the metabolic processes. Then, the intestines—I think they might have a lower energy expenditure. Wait, I recall that some organs have lower metabolic rates. Maybe the intestines are lower because their primary function is digestion, which might not be as energy-intensive as the heart or brain.

Let me think about the order. The brain is highest, then the heart, liver, kidneys, maybe the lungs, and then the others. Intestines might be lower. The skin, I'm not sure, but I think it's relatively low because it's more about maintaining temperature and barrier functions, which might not be as energy-heavy as the heart or brain.

So, putting it all together, the organ with the lowest energy expenditure per kg would be the intestines. Or maybe the skin? Wait, I'm a bit confused now. I think the skin is actually quite active in terms of blood flow, but perhaps not as much as the organs I mentioned earlier. Or maybe the intestines are lower because they're part of the digestive system, which is more about mechanical processes and absorption rather than high metabolic activity.

I think I'll go with the intestines as the organ with the lowest energy expenditure per unit mass.

The organ with the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass is the intestines.
