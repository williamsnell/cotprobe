Alright, so I've got this question about attachment patterns in children. The question is asking about a child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment style. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby, categorizes children into different attachment styles based on their behavior when separated from a primary caregiver, usually the mother. The main types are secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant (or ambivalent), and disorganized.

The question is specifically about the anxious-avoidant pattern. From what I recall, anxious-avoidant children often have a contradictory approach. They show some distress when separated but might avoid seeking comfort when the caregiver returns. They might seem more comfortable when the caregiver is absent than when she's present. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, so I need to be careful.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Shows little distress when separated and turns away when mom returns. That sounds more like avoidant, maybe secure? Wait, no, secure kids usually aren't too distressed and are happy to see the parent. But avoidant might show less distress but not seek comfort.

Option B: More anxious when mom is absent than present. So when she's present, the child is less anxious. That seems like avoidant because they might prefer being alone or not want to depend on the parent. So when the parent is there, they might not seek her as much, but when she's gone, they're more anxious. Wait, but I thought anxious-avoidant is more about the internal conflict—wanting proximity but avoiding it.

Option C: Very distressed when separated and highly anxious when she returns. That sounds more like the anxious-resistant or ambivalent type. They can't be comforted easily when the parent comes back, which is different from avoidant.

Option D: More anxious when mother is present. That doesn't sound right because avoidant kids are more anxious when the parent is gone, I think. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, anxious-avoidant children might feel more comfortable when the parent is gone because they don't have to deal with the conflict of wanting to be close but not feeling safe. So when the parent is present, they might resist contact. So when separated, they might not show much distress, but when the parent comes back, they might not want to be comforted.

Option E: Very distressed when separated but easily comforted when mom returns. That's more secure, I think. Secure kids are distressed when separated but quickly soothed upon reunion.

Option F: No preference between stranger and mom. That sounds like disorganized attachment, maybe due to trauma or inconsistent care.

Option G: Extreme distress when separated and clings when mom returns. That's the anxious-resistant or ambivalent type again. They want to be close but can't be comforted easily.

Option H: Very distressed when separated but pulls away when mom returns. Oh, that's interesting. So the child is upset when alone but when the parent comes back, he doesn't want to be comforted. That sounds a lot like the anxious-avoidant pattern because they're conflicted—wanting proximity but also avoiding it.

Option I: Indifferent to mom's presence or absence. That's avoidant, but I think it's more about the secure base. Wait, no, avoidant kids might show some distress but not seek comfort. Indifferent might be more like the disorganized or maybe secure in a different way.

Option J: Little distress when separated and seeks comfort from a stranger. That seems like avoidant. If the child doesn't mind being alone and even prefers a stranger, that's avoidance towards the parent.

Wait, so the key here is to distinguish between avoidant and resistant. The anxious-avoidant (sometimes called avoidant) children tend to avoid seeking comfort from the parent. They might show less distress when the parent is present, or perhaps not show much distress at all. When the parent returns after separation, they might not approach her and might even turn away.

Looking back at the options, Option A says little distress when separated and turns away when mom returns. That fits the avoidant pattern. Option H says very distressed when separated but pulls away when mom returns. That seems more like a mix but perhaps the avoidant style as well because they're conflicted.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The anxious-avoidant child is characterized by a pattern of behaviors where they seem to avoid closeness with the caregiver. They might not show much distress when separated, but when the caregiver returns, they don't seek comfort. They might even show some avoidance, like looking away or not wanting to be held.

So in the options:

Option A: Little distress when separated and turns away when mom returns. That fits the avoidant pattern.

Option H: Very distressed when separated but pulls away when mom returns. That seems more like the ambivalent/resistant type, where the child is very upset when separated and wants to be with the parent but is resistant upon reunion.

Wait, no. The ambivalent/resistant type is more about being very upset when the parent leaves, being slow to calm down when the parent comes back, and maybe even resisting comfort. So Option C is that.

Option H is about being very distressed when separated but pulling away when the parent returns. That seems to align with the avoidant pattern because the child is trying to avoid the conflict of wanting to be close but not feeling safe. So when the parent comes back, they might show some avoidance, like pulling away, even though they were distressed when separated.

Wait, but the avoidant child might not show much distress when separated. So which option is correct?

I think I need to recall the exact behaviors. The anxious-avoidant (avoidant) child typically:

- Shows little distress when mother leaves.
- When mother returns, the child may avoid her, show little interest in her, or turn away.

So that's Option A.

But wait, another perspective: Some sources describe the avoidant child as being more comfortable when the parent is absent and not particularly distressed. When the parent comes back, they might not seek her out, which is Option A.

However, some descriptions might include that the child is internally conflicted, showing some distress but avoiding contact. That could be Option H.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the more accurate option is A. Because the avoidant child is characterized by a lack of distress when separated and avoidance upon reunion.

Wait, but another angle: The anxious-avoidant child is anxious about separation but avoids showing it. So when the parent is present, they might not be as anxious, but when separated, they are more anxious. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The anxious-avoidant child is more about the avoidance of proximity. They prefer to be independent and may not show much distress when the parent is gone. They might even show more anxiety when the parent is present because they don't want to be dependent.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: More anxious when mother is absent. That would mean the child is more anxious when she's not there, which could be the resistant/ambivalent type. Because when the parent is absent, they're more anxious, and when she's present, they're more clingy but also resistant.

Option D: More anxious when mother is present. That doesn't seem right because that would imply the child is more comfortable when she's gone, which might be avoidant.

Wait, actually, the avoidant child might be more comfortable when the parent is absent because they don't have to deal with the conflict. So when the parent is present, they might not show much anxiety but avoid her.

So Option A: Shows little distress when separated and turns away when she returns. That's the avoidant pattern.

Option H: Very distressed when separated but pulls away when she returns. That sounds more like the resistant/ambivalent because the child is very upset when alone but resists comfort when she comes back.

Therefore, the correct answer for an insecure/anxious-avoidant pattern is likely Option A.
</think>

The correct answer is **A**. A child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment pattern typically shows little distress when separated from their mother and may turn away from her when she returns. This behavior reflects the avoidant aspect of the attachment style, where the child avoids seeking comfort and proximity with the caregiver, even though they may feel internal conflict.
