Question:

A rider entered a subway car at the 42nd Street station. Because all of the seats were occupied, the rider stood in the subway car and grabbed a pole to secure his balance. As the subway car was proceeding downtown, the rider glanced at a girl standing next to him. Suddenly, the subway car made an unexpected stop. The rider momentarily lost his balance and grabbed the girl around the waist (to avoid falling). Once the rider regained his balance, he removed his hands from the girl's waist and grasped the pole again. In a civil action instituted by the girl against the rider, he will most likely be found

Options:

A: liable, because the rider believed that the girl consented to the contact under the circumstances.
B: not liable, because the rider's actions were unintentional.
C: not liable, because the girl did not express any discomfort at the time of contact.
D: not liable, because the subway's sudden stop was an unforeseeable event.
E: liable, as he should have found another way to secure his balance.
F: liable, because the rider did not apologize for the contact.
G: liable for battery.
H: not liable, because the girl was not harmed by the contact.
I: liable for assault.
J: not liable, because the rider's conduct was socially acceptable under the circumstances.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let's break it down. The scenario is about a rider in a subway car who, during an unexpected stop, loses his balance and grabs a girl next to him. After regaining balance, he lets go and holds the pole again. The girl is suing him, and we need to determine if he's liable.

First, I need to remember the basic tort concepts here, specifically battery and assault. Battery is an intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person. Assault is the apprehension of imminent harmful contact. But in this case, the contact happened, so it's more about battery.

The rider grabbed the girl to prevent falling when the subway stopped suddenly. So, was this contact intentional? Well, he did reach out and grab her on purpose, but the intent was to prevent himself from falling, not to harm her. But in tort law, the intent is about the act, not the result. So even if his intent was to prevent falling, the act of grabbing her was intentional. So that might make it a battery.

But wait, there's the issue of consent. If the rider believed the girl consented, does that matter? Or was the contact without her consent? In this case, the rider didn't ask her; he just grabbed her without warning. So she probably didn't consent.

However, sometimes in cases where someone's actions are necessary to prevent harm, like in self-defense or to prevent injury, there's a defense of necessity or consent implied. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the rider's action was to prevent himself from falling, not necessarily to protect the girl.

Looking at the options, option A says he's liable because he believed she consented. But if he didn't ask, his belief might not be valid. Option B says not liable because it was unintentional. But the grabbing was intentional, so B might not be right. Option E says he's liable because he should have found another way to secure his balance. That could be a negligence argument, but battery is about intent, not negligence.

Option G says liable for battery. That seems possible because he made intentional contact without consent. Option H says not liable because she wasn't harmed. But battery doesn't require harm; it just needs offensive contact. So H might not be correct.

Option J says not liable because the conduct was socially acceptable. I'm not sure about that. Grabbing someone without consent isn't usually socially acceptable, so J might not apply.

So considering all that, the rider committed a battery because he intentionally made contact without consent. So the answer would be G: liable for battery.

The rider intentionally grabbed the girl to prevent falling, which constitutes battery as it involved intentional and harmful contact without consent. While the rider's intent was to prevent his own fall, the act itself was intentional. The sudden stop doesn't absolve him of liability, and there's no evidence of consent. Therefore, the rider is liable for battery.

Answer: G
