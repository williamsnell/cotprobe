Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Space Shuttle's acceleration due to Earth's gravity. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about gravity and how it works with objects in orbit.

The question says the Space Shuttle is orbiting 300 km above Earth's surface. Oh right, Earth's radius is given as 6400 km. So first, I should find the total distance from the center of the Earth to the Shuttle. That would be the Earth's radius plus the altitude, so 6400 km + 300 km. Let me add those: 6400 + 300 is 6700 km. Wait, but I think when using these values in formulas, I need to convert them into meters because the answer options are in meters per second squared. Right, so 6700 km is 6,700,000 meters, or 6.7e6 meters. And Earth's radius is 6400 km, which is 6,400,000 meters or 6.4e6 meters.

Now, the formula for gravitational acceleration at a distance r from the center of a mass is g = G*M / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the distance from Earth's center. But I remember another way to approach this using the known surface gravity. At Earth's surface, the acceleration is about 9.8 m/s², which is what I often see as g.

So, the acceleration decreases with the square of the distance from the center. That means I can compare the distance of the Shuttle to Earth's radius and then find the ratio squared. Let me write that down: the ratio would be r Shuttle divided by r Earth, which is 6.7e6 m / 6.4e6 m. Let me calculate that: 6.7 divided by 6.4 is approximately 1.046875. So the ratio is about 1.0469.

Now, since acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, I take 1 divided by (1.0469)². Let me compute that. 1.0469 squared is roughly 1.0469 * 1.0469. Let me do that step by step: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.0469 is 0.0469, 0.0469*1 is another 0.0469, and 0.0469*0.0469 is about 0.002199. Adding those together: 1 + 0.0469 + 0.0469 + 0.002199 = approximately 1.095999, so about 1.096. So 1 divided by 1.096 is approximately 0.912.

So the acceleration at the Shuttle's altitude would be Earth's surface gravity multiplied by this factor. So 9.8 m/s² multiplied by 0.912. Let me calculate that: 9.8 * 0.912. Well, 9 * 0.912 is 8.208, and 0.8 * 0.912 is 0.7296. Adding those gives 8.208 + 0.7296 = 8.9376 m/s². Hmm, that's about 8.94 m/s². Looking at the options, option B is 8.9 m/s². That seems to be the closest answer.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the ratio: 6700 km is 6,700,000 m, and Earth's radius is 6,400,000 m. So 6.7e6 /6.4e6 = 6.7/6.4 = 1.046875. Squared, that's (1.046875)^2. Let me calculate it precisely: 1.046875 * 1.046875.

Breaking it down: 1 * 1 =1, 1 * 0.046875 =0.046875, 0.046875 *1=0.046875, 0.046875 *0.046875= approx 0.002197. Adding all these: 1 + 0.046875 + 0.046875 + 0.002197 = 1.095947. So 1 / 1.095947 ≈ 0.9123. So 9.8 * 0.9123 = let's calculate that more accurately: 9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82, 9.8 *0.0123= approx 0.12054. Adding them gives 8.82 + 0.12054= 8.94054 m/s². So approximately 8.94 m/s², which rounds to 8.9 m/s², matching option B.

Wait, but sometimes in these problems, the exact calculation might vary a bit due to more precise values. Let me think if I did everything correctly. Oh, wait, I used Earth's surface gravity as 9.8 m/s², which is correct. The formula I used is correct because the gravitational force decreases with the square of the distance. So I think my approach is right.

Another way to check: the Space Shuttle is in low Earth orbit, which typically has an altitude of around 200-500 km. The gravity there is a bit less than 9.8 m/s². From what I remember, the acceleration at that altitude is roughly around 8.5 to 9 m/s². So 8.9 seems reasonable.

Let me see the options again. Option B is 8.9, which fits our calculation. So I think that's the correct answer.

The Space Shuttle orbits 300 km above Earth's surface, with Earth's radius being 6400 km. To find the gravitational acceleration at this altitude, we first calculate the total distance from Earth's center: \( 6400 + 300 = 6700 \, \text{km} = 6.7 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \). The ratio of this distance to Earth's radius is \( \frac{6.7 \times 10^6}{6.4 \times 10^6} \approx 1.0469 \). Since gravitational acceleration decreases with the square of the distance, we compute \( \frac{1}{(1.0469)^2} \approx 0.912 \). Multiplying Earth's surface gravity (\( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)) by this factor gives \( 9.8 \times 0.912 \approx 8.9 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). This matches option B.
