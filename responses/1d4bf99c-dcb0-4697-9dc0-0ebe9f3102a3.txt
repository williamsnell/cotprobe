Okay, so I've got this question about a patient with a malignant tumor damaging the glossopharyngeal nerve. I'm a bit rusty on my neuroanatomy, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that the glossopharyngeal nerve is the 9th cranial nerve, right? It's involved in taste and also some motor functions. Wait, no, actually, the ninth nerve is mainly sensory, but there's also a small motor component. Hmm. Let me get this straight.

The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is responsible for taste sensation in a specific area. I think it's the posterior one-third of the tongue. So if this nerve is damaged, the patient would lose taste in that region. But wait, another nerve is involved in taste too. Oh right, the facial nerve (CN VII) handles taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. So if the glossopharyngeal is damaged, the posterior part would lose taste.

Now, looking at the options, the ones related to taste are A, G, and I. Option A says loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds, which is the facial nerve's area, so that's probably not it. Option G is loss of taste over the posterior two-thirds, but wait, isn't it the posterior one-third? So maybe G isn't correct either. Option I says loss of taste and somaesthetic sensation over the posterior third. That sounds more accurate because the glossopharyngeal nerve carries both taste and sensory (somaesthetic) fibers.

Wait, but the question says the tumor is damaging the glossopharyngeal nerve. So the patient would lose taste and sensation where? The ninth nerve's taste area is the posterior third. So they'd lose taste there, and also the sensory function, like pain and touch, in that area.

Looking at the options again, option E is loss of somaesthetic over the posterior two-thirds. No, that's more the territory of the vagus nerve perhaps. Option F is anterior two-thirds, which is CN VII's area. Option I is posterior third for both taste and somaesthetic. So that fits.

Wait, but I also need to consider if the ninth nerve has any motor functions. Oh, right, the stylopharyngeus muscle is innervated by CN IX. So if the nerve is damaged, the patient might have trouble moving that muscle, which is part of swallowing. But the options don't mention that. The options are about taste and sensation, so I think the main issue is the loss of taste and sensation in the posterior third.

So the correct answer should be I: loss of taste and somaesthetic sensation over the posterior third of the tongue.

The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is responsible for taste sensation in the posterior one-third of the tongue and also carries sensory fibers for the same region. Damage to this nerve would result in the loss of both taste and somaesthetic (pain, touch) sensation in the posterior third of the tongue. Among the options provided, option I correctly describes this scenario.

Answer: I
