Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about how a company reports a stock issuance in their statement of cash flows. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says Ace Co. issued 1000 shares of its $10 par value common stock for $15 per share in cash. So, they sold 1000 shares, each with a par value of $10, but sold at a higher price of $15 each.

First, I remember that when a company issues stock, it's a financing activity. Financing activities involve the company's equity and debt. So, the cash received from issuing shares should be reported under financing activities.

Let me think about the cash involved. They sold 1000 shares at $15 each. So, 1000 times $15 is $15,000. That's the total cash inflow from this transaction.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly categorizes this as a financing activity with a $15,000 inflow. Let's read through the options again.

Option A says $15,000 cash inflow from operating activities. No, that's not right because issuing stock is a financing activity, not operating.

Option B mentions $10,000 from financing and $5,000 outflow from investing. Hmm, why would there be an investing outflow? The company is receiving cash, so why would it be an outflow? Maybe this option is mixing up something else, like maybe the par value and additional paid-in capital, but I'm not sure. Let me think more.

Option C is $15,000 cash inflow from financing activities. That sounds correct because they received cash from issuing shares, which is a financing activity.

Option D says no impact because it's a non-cash transaction. Wait, no, they actually received cash, so D is wrong.

Option E is $15,000 from investing. No, that's not right because it's a financing activity.

Option F is a $15,000 outflow from financing. That can't be right because they received cash, so it's an inflow, not an outflow.

Option G talks about $10,000 from investing and $5,000 adjustment. I'm not sure where the $10k comes from or why there's an adjustment. Maybe it's considering the par value, but I think the correct approach is to report the full $15k as inflow under financing.

Option H says $10k inflow from financing and $5k adjustment. Hmm, why the adjustment? Maybe because of some other accounting adjustment, but I'm not certain. I'll need to think about this more.

Option I is $10k outflow from investing and $5k adjustment. That seems off because the company is receiving cash, so it's an inflow.

Option J mentions $5k inflow from financing and $10k adjustment. That doesn't match the $15k total either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the company received $15,000 in cash. Financing activities include cash from issuing stock. So the correct answer should be an inflow of $15k under financing. Looking back at the options, option C says exactly that. So I think C is correct.

The correct answer is C: $15,000 cash inflow from financing activities. When Ace Co. issued shares for cash, it received $15,000, which is a financing activity. 

Answer: C
