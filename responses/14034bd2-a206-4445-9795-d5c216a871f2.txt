Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I need to figure out the rate of heat transfer per unit length of a pipe. Let me read the question again carefully.

Air is flowing perpendicularly to a pipe, transferring heat by forced convection. The pipe has a diameter of 4 inches and a surface temperature of 90°F. The cooling air with a flow velocity of 15 ft/s has a bulk temperature of 75°F. I need to calculate the rate of heat transfer per unit length of the pipe.

Hmm, right. So, the key here is forced convection, which involves heat transfer between a flowing fluid and a solid surface. The formula I remember for the rate of heat transfer in such cases is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference between the surface and the fluid.

Since the question asks for the rate per unit length, I probably just need to compute it for a length L and then divide by L to get per unit length. So, Q per unit length would be h * average circumference * ΔT divided by L, but wait, since we're considering per unit length, maybe the length cancels out. Let me think. The surface area per unit length (A/L) for a pipe is the circumference, which is π * diameter. So, the formula simplifies to Q/L = h * (π * D) * ΔT.

Alright, so I need to find h first. The convective heat transfer coefficient depends on the flow conditions, fluid properties, and the geometry. For forced convection, there's a correlation equation that relates h to the Reynolds number (Re) and the Prandtl number (Pr).

The Reynolds number is given by Re = (v * D) / ν, where v is the velocity, D is the diameter, and ν is the kinematic viscosity. The Prandtl number is Pr = μ * c_p / k, where μ is the dynamic viscosity, c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure, and k is the thermal conductivity.

But wait, I need the properties of air at the given conditions. The bulk temperature is 75°F, so I can assume the air is at around that temperature. Let me jot down the required properties of air at 75°F.

First, converting 75°F to Celsius because I'm more familiar with the metric system, but wait, maybe I can find the properties directly in imperial units. Let me recall or look up the standard values for air. 

At 75°F (which is about 23.9°C), the properties of air are approximately:
- Kinematic viscosity (ν) ≈ 1.48 × 10^-4 ft²/s
- Dynamic viscosity (μ) ≈ 3.75 × 10^-4 lb·s/ft²
- Thermal conductivity (k) ≈ 0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F
- Specific heat (c_p) ≈ 0.24 Btu/lb·°F
- Prandtl number (Pr) ≈ 0.706

Wait, I should double-check these. Oh right, at 75°F, ν is about 1.48e-4 ft²/s, μ is about 3.75e-4 lb/s·ft², k is 0.0144 Btu/(hr·ft·°F), and c_p is around 0.24 Btu/(lb·°F). Pr is indeed around 0.706 for air.

So, let's compute the Reynolds number first. The diameter D is 4 inches, which is 4/12 = 0.333... feet. The velocity v is 15 ft/s. So,

Re = (v * D) / ν
Re = (15 ft/s * 0.333 ft) / (1.48e-4 ft²/s)
Let me calculate the numerator first: 15 * 0.333 ≈ 4.995 ft²/s. Wait, no, wait: 15 ft/s * 0.333 ft = 4.995 ft²/s? Wait, no, units: ft/s * ft = ft²/s. So yes, 4.995 ft²/s.

Then Re = 4.995 / 1.48e-4 ≈ let's compute 4.995 / 0.000148.

Well, 4.995 / 0.000148 = approximately 4.995 * (1/0.000148) ≈ 4.995 * 6756.759 ≈ let me compute 5 * 6756.759 ≈ 33,783.795, minus 0.005 * 6756.759 ≈ 33,783.795 - 33.784 ≈ 33,749. So Re ≈ 33,750.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 4.995 / 0.000148.

Let me compute 4.995 / 0.000148:

0.000148 = 1.48e-4.

4.995 / 1.48e-4 = (4.995 / 1.48) * 1e4.

4.995 / 1.48 ≈ let's see: 1.48 * 3 = 4.44, 1.48 * 3.38 ≈ 4.9944. So 3.38.

So 3.38 * 1e4 = 33,800. So Re ≈ 33,800.

Okay, that's a high Reynolds number, which suggests turbulent flow since Re > 40,000 typically indicates turbulence for pipe flow. But wait, this is external flow because the air is flowing perpendicular to the pipe, which is more like a cylinder in cross flow. So, for a cylinder in cross flow, the Reynolds number is based on diameter, same as pipe flow, but the flow is different.

Wait, in this case, the problem says the air is flowing perpendicularly to the pipe, so it's more like the pipe is a cylinder in cross flow, not internal flow. So the convective heat transfer correlations for external flow, like around a cylinder, would apply.

For external flow, the Nusselt number (Nu) is given by:

Nu = (Re)^n * (Pr)^m

Where n and m are constants depending on the flow regime. For turbulent flow around a cylinder (Re > 10^5), the correlation might be different than internal flow. Alternatively, another approach is to use the Dittus-Boelter equation, but that's for internal flow. For external flow, perhaps the Gnielinski correlation or another one.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

When the fluid is flowing over a cylinder (external flow), the Nusselt number can be determined using the formula:

Nu = 0.023 Re^(0.8) Pr^(1/3)

But wait, that's the same as the Dittus-Boelter equation for internal flow, right? Or is it different? No, wait, for external flow, the correlation might have a different exponent. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for natural and forced convection around a cylinder.

Alternatively, perhaps another way: using the formula for heat transfer coefficient in external flow.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is assuming internal flow since it's a pipe. Wait, no, the question states that air is flowing perpendicularly to the pipe, so it's external flow. So the pipe is like a cylinder with air moving around it.

Wait, but the pipe's diameter is 4 inches. So if the air is moving perpendicularly, it's like a cylinder in cross flow. So I'll need to use the appropriate correlation for external flow.

I think for external flow around a cylinder, the Nusselt number for forced convection can be given by:

Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another correlation might be more appropriate. Alternatively, perhaps for a cylinder in cross flow, the Nusselt number is given by:

Nu = (Re)^(0.6) (Pr)^(0.333)

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a cylinder in cross flow, which might have a different exponent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the general formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for forced convection over a cylinder, which might be the same as for a flat plate in some cases. Hmm, no, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, I could use the formula for a cylinder in cross flow, which I think is similar to the Dittus-Boelter equation but with different constants. Alternatively, perhaps the correlation is:

Nu = 0.033 Re^0.5 Pr^(1/3)

Wait, that's for laminar flow around a cylinder, but when Re is high, it's turbulent. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Dittus-Boelter equation, assuming internal flow. But the problem says the air is flowing perpendicularly, so it's external. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is commonly used for internal flow. Let me see what that gives.

But wait, the Dittus-Boelter equation is:

Nu = 0.023 Re^(0.8) Pr^(1/3)

Which applies to internal flow and for Re > 10,000 and Pr between 0.7 and 100.

In this case, Re is about 33,800, which is above 10,000, and Pr is 0.706, which is within the range. So perhaps the problem expects me to use this formula, treating it as internal flow, even though the flow is external. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to internal flow because it's a pipe. Wait, the pipe's diameter is 4 inches, and the air is flowing perpendicularly, so I think it's external flow. But maybe the question is treating it as internal flow, perhaps for simplicity.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but given that it's a pipe and the flow is forced, perhaps it's intended to model it as internal flow. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem expects me to use the Dittus-Boelter equation regardless.

Let me proceed with that. So, using Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3).

We have Re ≈ 33,800, Pr ≈ 0.706.

Compute Nu:

First, Re^0.8 = (33,800)^0.8. Let's compute that.

33,800^0.8 = e^(0.8 ln(33800)).

ln(33800) ≈ ln(3.38e4) ≈ ln(3.38) + ln(1e4) ≈ 1.216 + 9.2103 ≈ 10.426.

So 0.8 * 10.426 ≈ 8.341.

e^8.341 ≈ e^8 is about 2980, e^0.341≈1.406, so 2980 *1.406≈4190.

So Re^0.8 ≈ 4,190.

Next, Pr^(1/3) = (0.706)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

0.706^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.706. 0.89^3≈0.704, because 0.89*0.89=0.7921, 0.7921*0.89≈0.705. So cube root is approximately 0.89.

So Pr^1/3 ≈ 0.89.

Now, multiply them: 0.023 * 4190 * 0.89.

0.023 * 4190 = 0.023 *4000=92, plus 0.023*190≈4.37 → total ≈96.37.

Then 96.37 *0.89 ≈ 85.8.

So Nu ≈ 85.8.

Now, Nu = h * D / k → h = (Nu * k) / D.

We have Nu ≈85.8, k =0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F, D=0.333 ft.

So h = (85.8 * 0.0144) / 0.333.

Compute numerator: 85.8 *0.0144 ≈ let's see: 80 *0.0144=1.152, 5.8*0.0144≈0.08352 → total ≈1.2355.

So h ≈1.2355 / 0.333 ≈3.71 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

85.8 *0.0144 = ?

Let me compute 85 * 0.0144 = 1.224, and 0.8 *0.0144=0.01152 → total 1.224 +0.01152=1.23552.

Divide by 0.333: 1.23552 /0.333 ≈3.713 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

So h ≈3.713 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, the temperature difference ΔT is the surface temperature minus the bulk temperature, so 90°F -75°F=15°F.

The surface area per unit length is the circumference, which is π*D. D=0.333 ft, so π*0.333≈1.047 ft.

So, Q/L = h * A/L * ΔT = h * (π D) * ΔT.

Plugging in the numbers:

h ≈3.713, π D ≈1.047, ΔT=15.

So Q/L =3.713 *1.047 *15.

Compute step by step:

3.713 *1.047 ≈ let's see: 3.7 *1.047 ≈3.8739, 0.013*1.047≈0.0136 → total≈3.8875.

Then 3.8875 *15 ≈58.3125 Btu/hr·ft.

Wait, that's about 58.3 Btu/hr·ft, but looking at the options, the closest is E:60, J:68, etc. Hmm, but 58 isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me check each step again.

First, Re calculation:

v=15 ft/s, D=0.333 ft.

Re = v*D/ν = (15 * 0.333)/1.48e-4.

15 *0.333 =4.995.

4.995 /1.48e-4 = 4.995 /0.000148≈ let's compute 4.995 /0.000148.

Well, 0.000148 is 1.48e-4. 4.995 /1.48e-4 = (4.995 /1.48) *1e4.

4.995 /1.48 ≈3.38, so 3.38 *1e4=33,800. So Re=33,800. That seems correct.

Next, Pr=0.706.

Using Dittus-Boelter: Nu=0.023*(Re)^0.8*(Pr)^1/3.

Re^0.8=33,800^0.8.

I approximated it as 4190, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 33,800^0.8 = e^(0.8 * ln(33800)).

ln(33800)= ln(3.38e4)= ln(3.38)+ln(1e4)=1.216 +9.2103≈10.426.

0.8 *10.426=8.3408.

e^8.3408: e^8 is 2980.958, e^0.3408≈1.406.

So 2980.958 *1.406≈4190. So that's correct.

Pr^(1/3)=0.706^(1/3)≈0.89.

So Nu=0.023 *4190 *0.89.

0.023*4190=96.37.

96.37 *0.89≈85.8. So Nu=85.8.

Then h=(85.8 *k)/D.

k=0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

h=(85.8 *0.0144)/0.333.

Compute numerator: 85.8 *0.0144.

Let me do 85 *0.0144=1.224, 0.8*0.0144=0.01152. Total=1.23552.

Divide by 0.333 ft: 1.23552 /0.333≈3.713 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). That's correct.

Now, A/L=π*D=π*0.333≈1.047 ft²/ft.

ΔT=15°F.

So Q/L= h * A/L *ΔT=3.713 *1.047 *15.

3.713 *1.047≈3.713 *1=3.713, 3.713 *0.047≈0.1746 → total≈3.8876.

3.8876 *15=58.314 Btu/hr·ft.

Hmm, but the options don't have 58. The closest is E:60, J:68, but 58 isn't there. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should use a different correlation for external flow. Let me try that.

For external flow around a cylinder, the Nusselt number is given by:

Nu = 0.027 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3)

Wait, but that's for internal flow. Alternatively, for external flow, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another source says that for forced convection around a cylinder, the Nusselt number can be calculated using:

Nu = (0.023 Re^0.8) Pr^(1/3)

Which is the same as the internal flow correlation. But I'm not sure if that's accurate for external flow. Alternatively, perhaps the correlation for external flow is:

Nu = 0.033 Re^0.5 Pr^(1/3)

But that's for laminar flow. Since Re is 33,800, which is well into the turbulent range, perhaps a different formula is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for external flow is:

Nu = 0.018 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3)

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for flow over a flat plate, but that's a different geometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Dittus-Boelter equation, treating it as internal flow, even though it's external. In that case, I proceed as before, getting h≈3.713 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F), leading to Q/L≈58.3 Btu/hr·ft, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h.

Wait, let me check the calculation of h again.

h = (Nu * k) / D.

Nu=85.8, k=0.0144, D=0.333 ft.

So 85.8 *0.0144 = let's compute precisely.

85.8 * 0.0144:

80 *0.0144=1.152

5.8 *0.0144=0.08352

Total=1.152 +0.08352=1.23552.

1.23552 / 0.333 = let's compute 1.23552 ÷0.333.

0.333 *3.713=1.23549, which matches, so h≈3.713.

Hmm, perhaps I should use a different formula for external flow. Let me think again.

Another approach: for air flowing over a cylinder, the convective heat transfer coefficient can be found using the formula:

h = (k * (Re)^(n)) / D,

where n is an exponent that depends on the flow regime. For forced convection, n is typically around 0.5 to 0.8.

Wait, but without knowing the exact formula, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the natural convection formula, but that's unlikely because it's forced convection.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer in external flow, which might be:

Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_s - T_inf)

But that's the overall heat transfer equation, but I need to find h first.

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula for external flow. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated as internal flow, and I should proceed with that, even though the flow is external.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Nusselt number.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for external flow uses a different exponent, such as Nu = 0.023 Re^0.6 Pr^(1/3), but I'm not sure.

Let me try that.

If I use Nu = 0.023 Re^0.6 Pr^(1/3).

Re=33,800.

Re^0.6 = (33800)^0.6.

Let me compute ln(33800)=~10.426 as before.

0.6 *10.426=6.2556.

e^6.2556≈e^6=403.4288, e^0.2556≈1.2917.

So 403.4288 *1.2917≈521. So Re^0.6≈521.

Pr^(1/3)=0.89 as before.

So Nu=0.023 *521 *0.89.

0.023 *521≈12.

12 *0.89≈10.68.

So Nu≈10.68.

Then h=(10.68 *0.0144)/0.333.

10.68 *0.0144=0.153792.

0.153792 /0.333≈0.4616 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q/L= h * π D *ΔT=0.4616 *1.047 *15.

0.4616 *1.047≈0.483.

0.483 *15≈7.245 Btu/hr·ft.

That's way too low, so probably the wrong approach.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula for external flow is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should check another resource.

Wait, perhaps for external flow around a cylinder, the Nusselt number is given by:

Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3)

Which is the same as the internal flow formula. But let me check with Re=33,800.

As before, that gives Nu≈85.8, leading to h≈3.713, and Q/L≈58.3.

But the options don't have that. The closest is J:68, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Prandtl number. Let me double-check the properties of air at 75°F.

At 75°F (23.9°C), the properties are approximately:

- Kinematic viscosity ν ≈ 1.48 × 10^-4 ft²/s
- Dynamic viscosity μ ≈ 3.75 × 10^-4 lb/s·ft²
- Thermal conductivity k ≈ 0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F
- Specific heat c_p ≈ 0.24 Btu/lb·°F

Pr = μ * c_p / k.

Plugging in the numbers:

Pr = (3.75e-4 lb/s·ft²) * (0.24 Btu/lb·°F) / (0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F)

Wait, the units need to be compatible. Let me convert c_p from Btu/lb·°F to Btu/(lb·°F·hr), but wait, no, let's see:

Wait, c_p is in Btu/lb·°F, and k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So when we compute Pr, the units should cancel out.

So Pr = (μ * c_p) / k.

μ is in lb/(s·ft²), c_p in Btu/(lb·°F), k in Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

Let me compute the units:

μ * c_p = (lb/(s·ft²)) * (Btu/(lb·°F)) )= (Btu·s)/(ft²·°F).

k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So Pr = [ (Btu·s)/(ft²·°F) ) ] / [ (Btu)/(hr·ft·°F) ) ] = (s * hr * ft) / (ft² ) = (s * hr) / ft.

Wait, that's not dimensionless. I must have made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me check the correct units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute Pr using consistent units. Let me convert all to SI units.

But perhaps I should just compute Pr numerically.

Pr = (μ * c_p) / k.

μ=3.75e-4 lb/s·ft².

c_p=0.24 Btu/lb·°F.

k=0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

So,

μ*c_p =3.75e-4 *0.24 =0.00009.

Then divide by k: 0.00009 /0.0144 ≈0.00625.

Wait, that can't be right because Pr for air is about 0.7. So I must have messed up the units.

Ah, I see. I think I messed up the units for μ. Let me check the correct value for μ in compatible units.

Wait, in imperial units, μ for air at 75°F is approximately 3.75 × 10^-4 lb·s/ft².

c_p is 0.24 Btu/(lb·°F).

k is 0.0144 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So,

Pr = (μ * c_p) / k = (3.75e-4 lb·s/ft²) * (0.24 Btu/(lb·°F)) ) / (0.0144 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)).

Simplify the units:

(lb·s/ft²) * (Btu/(lb·°F)) ) = (s/ft²) * Btu/°F.

Divide by (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) → (s/ft²) * Btu/°F * hr·ft·°F / Btu → (s/ft²) * hr·ft → (s·hr)/(ft).

Wait, that's (s·hr)/(ft). But we need a dimensionless Pr. So I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert μ to lb/(s·ft²) and k to Btu/(hr·ft·°F), and compute Pr.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert all to consistent units, like SI.

But perhaps I can find the Pr value directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct Pr for air at 75°F. I think it's around 0.706, as I initially thought.

So perhaps I should proceed with Pr=0.706.

So back to h=3.713, leading to Q/L≈58.3, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula for internal flow, but the flow is external. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a pipe with flow perpendicular, which might imply that the length is along the flow direction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer per unit length is along the pipe's length, which is perpendicular to the flow. So perhaps the surface area is the lateral surface area, which is circumference times length, but since we're considering per unit length, it's just the circumference.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier: A/L=π*D.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for a pipe with flow along its length, but the question says the flow is perpendicular. So I think I'm correct in using the external flow approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the natural convection formula, but that doesn't make sense because it's forced convection.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of h again.

h= (Nu *k)/D.

Nu=85.8, k=0.0144, D=0.333.

h=85.8 *0.0144 /0.333.

85.8 *0.0144=1.23552.

1.23552 /0.333≈3.713.

Yes, that's correct.

Then Q/L=3.713 * π *0.333 *15.

Wait, π *0.333 is the circumference, which is correct.

3.713 *1.047 *15=3.713 *15.705≈58.3.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for the thermal conductivity or other properties. Let me check the values again.

Thermal conductivity k for air at 75°F is approximately 0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for forced convection in a pipe, assuming flow is along the pipe, not perpendicular. So perhaps I should recalculate using internal flow.

Wait, if the flow is along the pipe, then the diameter is the same, and the formula would be the same.

But the problem states that the air is flowing perpendicularly, so it's external flow. But perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's intended to be internal flow. In that case, I proceed as before, getting 58.3, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest higher value is J:68, which is 68 Btu/hr·ft.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Nusselt number. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for external flow uses a different exponent, such as Nu = 0.023 Re^0.5 Pr^(1/3), but that's for laminar flow, and Re is 33,800 which is turbulent.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for external flow is:

Nu = 0.018 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3)

Let me try that.

0.018 * (33800)^0.8 * (0.706)^(1/3).

We already have Re^0.8≈4190, Pr^1/3≈0.89.

So Nu=0.018 *4190 *0.89.

0.018 *4190=75.42.

75.42 *0.89≈67.18.

So Nu≈67.18.

Then h= (67.18 *0.0144)/0.333.

67.18 *0.0144≈0.967.

0.967 /0.333≈2.902 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q/L=2.902 *1.047 *15.

2.902 *1.047≈3.036.

3.036 *15≈45.54 Btu/hr·ft.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula for flow over a flat plate, but that's a different geometry. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the natural convection formula, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula for external flow. Another resource I recall for external flow around a cylinder in cross flow uses the formula:

Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3)

Which is the same as the Dittus-Boelter equation, even for external flow. So I proceed as before, getting Nu≈85.8, h≈3.713, Q/L≈58.3.

But since 58.3 isn't an option, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the use of a different formula, perhaps assuming laminar flow.

Wait, but Re is 33,800, which is well into the turbulent range. So perhaps I should consider a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with flow velocity, but the question says the flow is perpendicular, so it's external.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient using the formula h = (k * (v * D)^n) / D, where n is an exponent. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for forced convection in a pipe with flow velocity v, and use the formula Q = (v * c_p * A * ΔT).

Wait, that's the formula for heat transfer when you know the mass flow rate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the mass flow rate m_dot = rho * A * v, where rho is density.

But I don't have rho given. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it.

Density of air at 75°F is about 0.0748 lb/ft³.

So m_dot = rho * A * v.

A is the cross-sectional area, which is π*(D/2)^2 = π*(0.333/2)^2 ≈ π*(0.1665)^2 ≈0.0867 ft².

v=15 ft/s.

So m_dot = 0.0748 lb/ft³ *0.0867 ft² *15 ft/s ≈0.0748 *0.0867 *15 ≈0.0997 lb/s.

Then, Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_s - T_inf) =0.0997 lb/s *0.24 Btu/lb·°F *15°F ≈0.0997 *3.6 ≈0.359 Btu/s.

But the question asks for per unit length, so Q/L=0.359 Btu/s/ft.

Wait, but that's not matching any options, and the units are in Btu/hr.

0.359 Btu/s/ft *3600 s/hr=1292.4 Btu/hr·ft, which is way higher than any option.

So that approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer per unit length, considering the pipe as a cylinder in cross flow, using the formula:

Q/L = (h * π * D * ΔT)

But I already have h from before, leading to 58.3, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the formula for internal flow but with a different Nu calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an error in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Re. Let me recheck.

Re = v * D / ν.

v=15 ft/s.

D=4 inches=0.3333 ft.

ν=1.48e-4 ft²/s.

So Re= (15 *0.3333)/1.48e-4.

15 *0.3333≈4.9995.

4.9995 /1.48e-4 =4.9995 /0.000148≈33,781.

Yes, Re≈33,781.

Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use a different value for the thermal conductivity or other properties. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for forced convection in a pipe with flow perpendicular, which might involve a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the heat transfer coefficient formula for a pipe with flow velocity v, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer per unit length is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with forced convection, using the Dittus-Boelter equation, leading to h=3.713, and then Q/L= h * π D *ΔT=3.713 *1.047 *15≈58.3.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to use the formula for external flow with a different exponent, such as Nu=0.033 Re^0.5 Pr^(1/3).

Let me try that.

Re=33,800.

Re^0.5=√33800≈183.85.

Pr^1/3=0.89.

So Nu=0.033 *183.85 *0.89.

0.033 *183.85≈6.067.

6.067 *0.89≈5.398.

So Nu≈5.4.

Then h=(5.4 *0.0144)/0.333.

5.4 *0.0144=0.07776.

0.07776 /0.333≈0.2335 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q/L=0.2335 *1.047 *15≈0.2335 *15.705≈3.663 Btu/hr·ft.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation gives me 58.3, which isn't an option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for natural convection, but it's forced convection. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer per unit length as Q/L = (v * c_p * rho * A * ΔT).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of velocity and properties.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula:

h = (0.018 Re^0.8 Pr^0.4)(k/D)

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the general formula for forced convection around a cylinder.

After some research, I find that for forced convection around a cylinder, the Nusselt number can be calculated using:

Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3)

Which is the same as the Dittus-Boelter equation, even for external flow. So I proceed as before, leading to h≈3.713, Q/L≈58.3.

But the options don't include this. Perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the formula for a pipe with flow along its length, not perpendicular. Let me try that.

If the flow is along the pipe, then the diameter is the same, and the formula is the same as before. So I get the same result, 58.3, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for a pipe with flow velocity and calculate the heat transfer per unit length using Q/L = (v * c_p * rho * A * ΔT).

But I don't have rho given, but I can compute it.

Density rho of air at 75°F is approximately 0.0748 lb/ft³.

So,

Q/L = v * c_p * rho * A * ΔT.

A is the cross-sectional area, π*(D/2)^2= π*(0.333/2)^2≈0.0867 ft².

So,

Q/L =15 ft/s *0.24 Btu/lb·°F *0.0748 lb/ft³ *0.0867 ft² *15°F.

Compute step by step:

15 *0.24=3.6.

3.6 *0.0748≈0.269.

0.269 *0.0867≈0.0233.

0.0233 *15≈0.3495 Btu/s.

Convert to Btu/hr: 0.3495 *3600≈1258 Btu/hr·ft.

That's way higher than any option, so this approach must be wrong.

I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to 58.3, but the options don't include that. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula for the rate of heat transfer again. The formula is Q = h * A * ΔT.

But for per unit length, A is the surface area per unit length, which is circumference: A/L= π D.

So Q/L = h * π D * ΔT.

Which is what I did.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest higher option is J:68.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different value for Pr. Let me double-check.

Pr = μ * c_p / k.

μ=3.75e-4 lb/s·ft².

c_p=0.24 Btu/lb·°F.

k=0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

So,

Pr= (3.75e-4 *0.24) /0.0144 = (9e-5) /0.0144≈0.00625.

Wait, that can't be right because Pr for air is about 0.7. I must have made a mistake in the units.

Ah! I think I messed up the units for μ. Let me check the correct value for μ in the correct units.

In imperial units, the dynamic viscosity μ of air at 75°F is approximately 3.75 × 10^-4 lb·s/ft².

So,

μ=3.75e-4 lb·s/ft².

c_p=0.24 Btu/(lb·°F).

k=0.0144 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So,

Pr = (μ * c_p) / k = (3.75e-4 *0.24) /0.0144.

Compute numerator: 3.75e-4 *0.24 = 9e-5.

9e-5 /0.0144 = 0.00625.

Wait, that's Pr=0.00625, which is way too low. But this can't be correct because Pr for air is around 0.7. So I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert k to Btu/(s·ft·°F) to match the units.

Wait, 1 hr=3600 s, so k=0.0144 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)=0.0144/3600 Btu/(s·ft·°F)=4e-6 Btu/(s·ft·°F).

So,

Pr = (μ * c_p) / k = (3.75e-4 lb·s/ft²) * (0.24 Btu/(lb·°F)) ) / (4e-6 Btu/(s·ft·°F)).

Simplify:

(3.75e-4 *0.24) =9e-5.

Divide by 4e-6: 9e-5 /4e-6=22.5.

So Pr=22.5.

Wait, that's way higher than the correct value. I must have messed up the unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps I should use consistent units. Let's convert everything to SI units.

Density (rho) of air at 75°F is about 1.184 kg/m³.

Dynamic viscosity μ≈1.89e-5 kg/(m·s).

Specific heat c_p≈1005 J/(kg·K).

Thermal conductivity k≈0.0243 W/(m·K).

So,

Pr = μ * c_p / k = (1.89e-5 kg/(m·s)) * (1005 J/(kg·K)) ) / (0.0243 W/(m·K)).

Compute numerator: 1.89e-5 *1005 ≈0.0189945.

Denominator:0.0243.

So Pr≈0.0189945 /0.0243≈0.782.

That's close to 0.7, which is correct.

So perhaps using the SI units gives Pr≈0.782, which is close to 0.7.

So perhaps using Pr=0.782 instead of 0.706 makes a slight difference.

Let me recalculate Nu with Pr=0.782.

Nu=0.023 * (33800)^0.8 * (0.782)^(1/3).

We have (33800)^0.8≈4190, as before.

(0.782)^(1/3)≈0.923.

So,

Nu=0.023 *4190 *0.923.

0.023 *4190≈96.37.

96.37 *0.923≈89.1.

So Nu≈89.1.

Then h=(89.1 *0.0144)/0.333.

89.1 *0.0144≈1.28784.

1.28784 /0.333≈3.868 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q/L=3.868 *1.047 *15≈3.868 *15.705≈56.7.

Hmm, that's even lower than before. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the answer isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to use a different formula, such as the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with velocity v, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer per unit length as Q/L = (v * c_p * rho * π * D * ΔT).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer coefficient as h = (v * k) / (D).

Wait, that's not correct, but perhaps let's try.

h=(15 ft/s *0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F) /0.333 ft.

15*0.0144=0.216.

0.216 /0.333≈0.648 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q/L=0.648 *1.047 *15≈0.648 *15.705≈10.21 Btu/hr·ft.

No, that's way too low.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the thermal conductivity is in W/m·K, but I think I've already tried that.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the heat transfer coefficient in terms of the velocity and the thermal conductivity, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the heat transfer coefficient for a turbulent flow as h=0.036 Re^0.5 Pr^0.333 *k/D.

Let me try that.

h=0.036 * sqrt(Re) * (Pr)^(1/3) *k/D.

Re=33,800, so sqrt(Re)=183.85.

Pr=0.782, so Pr^(1/3)=0.923.

k=0.0144 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

D=0.333 ft.

So,

h=0.036 *183.85 *0.923 *0.0144 /0.333.

Compute step by step:

0.036 *183.85≈6.6186.

6.6186 *0.923≈6.122.

6.122 *0.0144≈0.0882.

0.0882 /0.333≈0.265 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q/L=0.265 *1.047 *15≈0.265 *15.705≈4.18 Btu/hr·ft.

Nope, that's not matching.

I'm really stuck here. The calculation consistently leads me to around 58 Btu/hr·ft, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with flow along its length, and the diameter is 4 inches, but the velocity is 15 ft/s. Let me try that.

Using the Dittus-Boelter equation for internal flow:

Nu=0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.333.

Re=(v D)/ν= (15 *0.333)/1.48e-4≈33,800, same as before.

Pr=0.782.

So Nu=0.023*(33800)^0.8*(0.782)^0.333.

As before, Nu≈89.1.

h=(89.1 *0.0144)/0.333≈3.868.

Then Q/L=3.868 * π*0.333 *15≈56.7.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with flow velocity and calculate the mass flow rate, then use Q= m_dot * c_p * ΔT.

But I tried that earlier and got 1292 Btu/hr·ft, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer per unit length as Q/L = (v * c_p * rho * π * D * ΔT).

With rho=0.0748 lb/ft³, v=15 ft/s, c_p=0.24 Btu/lb·°F, D=0.333 ft, ΔT=15°F.

So,

Q/L=15 *0.24 *0.0748 *π *0.333 *15.

Compute step by step:

15 *0.24=3.6.

3.6 *0.0748≈0.269.

0.269 *π≈0.845.

0.845 *0.333≈0.281.

0.281 *15≈4.215 Btu/hr·ft.

No, that's too low.

I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 58 Btu/hr·ft, but since it's not an option, I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with flow velocity, but using the formula Q = (v * A * c_p * rho * ΔT).

But that's similar to what I did earlier, leading to a high value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer coefficient as h = (0.018 Re^0.8 Pr^0.333 k)/D.

Let me try that.

h=0.018*(33800)^0.8*(0.782)^0.333*(0.0144)/0.333.

We have (33800)^0.8≈4190, (0.782)^0.333≈0.923.

So,

h=0.018 *4190 *0.923 *0.0144 /0.333.

Compute:

0.018 *4190≈75.42.

75.42 *0.923≈70. (approx).

70 *0.0144≈1.008.

1.008 /0.333≈3.027 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then Q/L=3.027 *1.047 *15≈3.027 *15.705≈47.5.

Still not matching.

I think I've exhausted all options. The correct calculation leads me to approximately 58 Btu/hr·ft, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose the closest one, which is J:68. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option I:75.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:68.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of h again.

h= (85.8 *0.0144)/0.333.

85.8 *0.0144=1.23552.

1.23552 /0.333≈3.713.

Yes, that's correct.

Then Q/L=3.713 *1.047 *15=3.713 *15.705≈58.3.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem expects me to round to the nearest option, which isn't available. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Re calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck Re.

Re= v * D / ν.

v=15 ft/s.

D=4 in=0.333 ft.

ν=1.48e-4 ft²/s.

So,

Re=15 *0.333 /1.48e-4.

15 *0.333=4.995.

4.995 /1.48e-4=33,800.

Yes, correct.

I think I've done everything I can. The answer should be around 58, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J:68.
</think>

To calculate the rate of heat transfer per unit length of the pipe, we use the formula for forced convection heat transfer:

\[
Q/L = h \cdot \pi D \cdot \Delta T
\]

where:
- \( h \) is the convective heat transfer coefficient,
- \( D \) is the pipe diameter,
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference between the surface and the fluid.

### Step 1: Calculate the Reynolds Number (\( Re \))
The Reynolds number is given by:

\[
Re = \frac{v \cdot D}{\nu}
\]

Given:
- \( v = 15 \, \text{ft/s} \),
- \( D = 4 \, \text{in} = 0.333 \, \text{ft} \),
- \( \nu = 1.48 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \),

\[
Re = \frac{15 \cdot 0.333}{1.48 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 33,800
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Nusselt Number (\( Nu \))
Using the Dittus-Boelter correlation for turbulent flow:

\[
Nu = 0.023 \cdot Re^{0.8} \cdot Pr^{1/3}
\]

Given:
- \( Re = 33,800 \),
- \( Pr = 0.706 \),

\[
Re^{0.8} \approx 4190, \quad Pr^{1/3} \approx 0.89
\]

\[
Nu = 0.023 \cdot 4190 \cdot 0.89 \approx 85.8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (\( h \))
The Nusselt number is related to \( h \) by:

\[
Nu = \frac{h \cdot D}{k} \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{Nu \cdot k}{D}
\]

Given:
- \( k = 0.0144 \, \text{Btu/hr} \cdot \text{ft} \cdot ^\circ \text{F} \),
- \( D = 0.333 \, \text{ft} \),

\[
h = \frac{85.8 \cdot 0.0144}{0.333} \approx 3.713 \, \text{Btu/hr} \cdot \text{ft}^2 \cdot ^\circ \text{F}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Rate of Heat Transfer per Unit Length (\( Q/L \))
The surface area per unit length is the circumference of the pipe:

\[
A/L = \pi \cdot D = \pi \cdot 0.333 \approx 1.047 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{ft}
\]

\[
Q/L = h \cdot A/L \cdot \Delta T
\]

Given:
- \( \Delta T = 90^\circ \text{F} - 75^\circ \text{F} = 15^\circ \text{F} \),

\[
Q/L = 3.713 \cdot 1.047 \cdot 15 \approx 58.3 \, \text{Btu/hr} \cdot \text{ft}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated value of \( Q/L \approx 58.3 \, \text{Btu/hr} \cdot \text{ft} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest higher value is **68 Btu/hr·ft (Option J)**. Given the discrepancy, it is likely that the intended answer is:

**J: 68 Btu/hr·ft**

**Answer: J**
