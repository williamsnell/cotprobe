Okay, so I have this physics question about waves moving from shallow to deep water. I'm a bit rusty on my wave properties, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that when a wave moves through a medium, certain properties change depending on the medium's properties. In this case, the medium is water, and we're moving from shallow to deep water. I think that in shallow water, waves have different characteristics than in deep water.

I recall that the speed of a wave depends on the medium. For water waves, specifically, the speed usually increases with depth because deeper water allows the wave to move more freely. So when a wave moves from shallow to deep water, the speed should increase. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should double-check.

Next, the frequency. I remember that frequency is related to the source of the wave and doesn't change unless the source changes. So if the wave is moving from one medium to another, the frequency should stay the same. Because the frequency is determined by the wave's source, and the medium change doesn't affect it. So the frequency remains constant.

Now, the wavelength. Since the speed is changing and the frequency isn't, I can use the wave equation: speed = frequency Ã— wavelength. If the speed increases and frequency remains the same, the wavelength must increase. Because if speed goes up and frequency is constant, wavelength must also go up to keep the equation balanced. So wavelength increases.

Putting it all together: frequency doesn't change, speed increases, wavelength increases. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Frequency doesn't change, wavelength increases, speed increases. That matches what I thought.

Option F: Frequency doesn't change, wavelength increases, speed decreases. No, speed increases so F is wrong.

Option H: Frequency decreases, wavelength increases, speed increases. No, frequency doesn't change.

Wait, does the speed of a surface wave actually increase with depth? Hmm. I think in deep water, the wave speed is higher because the restoring force is greater. Shallow water waves are more affected by the bottom, so their speed is lower. So yes, moving from shallow to deep, speed increases.

So the correct answer should be A.

When a wave moves from shallow water to deep water, the frequency remains constant because it is determined by the wave's source. The speed of the wave increases as it moves into deeper water. Using the wave equation \( v = f \lambda \), where \( v \) is speed, \( f \) is frequency, and \( \lambda \) is wavelength, we see that if speed increases and frequency remains unchanged, the wavelength must also increase. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

A: frequency does not change, the wavelength increases, and the speed increases.
