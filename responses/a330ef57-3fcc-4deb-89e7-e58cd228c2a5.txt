Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a concave shaving mirror. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: A man has a concave shaving mirror with a focal length of 20 inches. How far should the mirror be held from his face to give an image of two-fold magnification? The options are A through J, with various inches.

Hmm, I remember that concave mirrors are used for things like shaving because they can produce magnified images when the object is placed within a certain range. I think the key here is to use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.

Wait, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. And magnification m is di/do. Oh, and for magnification, m is also equal to -di/do, right? Because the sign conventions matter here. But since we're dealing with magnification in terms of just the factor (like two-fold), maybe the sign won't matter for the magnitude.

The problem states that the magnification is two-fold, so m = 2. Since the mirror is concave, I think the image formed when the object is within the focal length (do < f) is virtual and upright, which makes sense for a shaving mirror because you want to see a magnified, upright image of your face.

So, the magnification formula is m = di/do. Wait, but I also remember that for mirrors, the magnification can be positive or negative depending on whether the image is upright or inverted. In this case, since it's a virtual image, the magnification should be positive, so m = 2.

But wait, let me make sure. The formula is m = -di/do. So if m is positive, then di must be negative, which indicates a virtual image. Because concave mirrors can form virtual images when the object is within the focal length.

So, if m = 2, then 2 = -di/do. Wait, but that would mean di = -do * 2. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The formula is m = -di/do, so solving for di gives di = -m * do.

Since m is 2, di = -2 * do. Now, plugging this into the mirror equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Substituting di: 1/20 = 1/do + 1/(-2 do). Let me compute that.

1/20 = 1/do - 1/(2 do). To combine the terms, let's find a common denominator. So, 1/do - 1/(2 do) = (2 - 1)/(2 do) = 1/(2 do).

So now the equation is 1/20 = 1/(2 do). Solving for do: 2 do * 1/20 = 1 → do = 20/(2) = 10 inches.

Wait, that gives do = 10 inches. So the object distance (the distance from the mirror to the face) is 10 inches. Let me check the options: option C is 10 inches.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Plugging do = 10 into the mirror equation:

1/f = 1/10 + 1/di. And since di = -2 * do = -20 inches.

So 1/20 = 1/10 + 1/(-20) → 1/20 = (20 - 10)/(200) → Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it numerically.

1/10 is 0.1, and 1/di is 1/(-20) = -0.05. So 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05. And 1/20 is 0.05. So yes, it checks out.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the signs again. Because in the mirror formula, object distance do is positive when the object is in front of the mirror (real object), which it is here. The image distance di is negative because the image is virtual, which makes sense for a concave mirror when the object is within the focal length.

So, the calculations seem correct. The object distance is 10 inches. So the answer should be option C: 10 inches.
</think>

To determine how far the concave mirror should be held from the man's face, we use the magnification formula \( m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \), where \( m \) is the magnification, \( d_i \) is the image distance, and \( d_o \) is the object distance. Given \( m = 2 \), we find \( d_i = -2d_o \).

Substituting into the mirror formula \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} \), with \( f = 20 \, \text{in} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{-2d_o}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{d_o} - \frac{1}{2d_o} = \frac{1}{2d_o}.
\]

Solving for \( d_o \):

\[
d_o = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \, \text{in}.
\]

Thus, the mirror should be held 10 inches away from the face.
