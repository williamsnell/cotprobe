Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

If you rub your eyes long and hard enough, you would eventuallysee some type of visual pattern. Explain this phenomenon.

Options:

A: The rubbing action generates light inside the eye
B: Pressure on the eye temporarily alters the shape of the cornea, leading to distorted visual signals.
C: The mechanical stimulation from rubbing triggers a reflex that causes the pupils to dilate and create patterned visuals.
D: Friction from rubbing generates heat, which causes the illusion of light patterns.
E: It happens due to the production of a natural hallucinogen when pressure is applied
F: The pressure causes the release of stored light energy in the eye
G: The pressure exerted on the eye stimulates the receptor nerve cells at the back of the retina, which normally respond to light, and their response to this pressure, when communicated to the visual area of the brain, produce the experience of light.
H: Rubbing the eyes causes a temporary change in blood flow to the visual cortex, resulting in visual phenomena.
I: The rubbing motion activates latent photoreceptor cells which produce the visual patterns.
J: The optic nerve is temporarily disoriented by the rubbing, resulting in random visual patterns.

Okay, so I have this question about what happens when you rub your eyes and see visual patterns. I'm trying to figure out which option is correct. Let's think through each option one by one.

The question is asking why, after rubbing your eyes, you see some kind of visual pattern. So, I remember that when you rub your eyes hard, you sometimes get these flashes of light or geometric patterns. But why does that happen?

Option A says the rubbing generates light inside the eye. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I don't think friction creates light; light is a form of energy, and friction generates heat, not light. So probably not A.

Option B suggests that pressure alters the cornea's shape, leading to distorted signals. While it's true that pressure can affect the cornea, I think the main issue is with the retina, not just the cornea. Plus, distorted vision from cornea changes would be more about seeing things out of focus, not patterns like flashes or grids. So maybe B isn't the best choice.

Option C says mechanical stimulation triggers a reflex to dilate pupils and create patterns. Pupil dilation does happen when you're in the dark, but I'm not sure it's the cause of the visual patterns when you rub your eyes. The patterns seem more related to the eye's internal response rather than pupil size. So C might not be it.

Option D claims friction generates heat, which causes light illusions. I've heard that heat can affect vision, but I don't recall it being a common explanation for eye-rubbing patterns. Plus, the heat would probably cause some discomfort rather than specific visual patterns. So D seems less likely.

Option E suggests a natural hallucinogen is produced under pressure. That sounds a bit far-fetched. Hallucinogens are chemicals that alter perception, and I don't think eye pressure would produce such compounds. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F says pressure causes the release of stored light energy. I don't know much about stored light energy in the eye. It sounds a bit like a made-up concept. I think the eye uses light as it comes in, not storing it, so F might not be correct.

Option G explains that pressure stimulates receptor nerve cells in the retina, which respond to pressure instead of light, and this sends signals to the brain creating the light experience. This makes sense because the retina has photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that detect light. If you apply pressure, maybe those cells get activated even without light, causing the brain to perceive light. I've heard something about this before, so G seems plausible.

Option H talks about a change in blood flow to the visual cortex. While blood flow affects many things, including vision, I'm not sure if it's the primary reason for these patterns when rubbing eyes. It might contribute, but I think the main cause is more direct, like the retina's response. So H might not be the best answer.

Option I says the motion activates latent photoreceptor cells. Latent cells doesn't sound familiar. Photoreceptors are either rods or cones, and they're active when light is present. Rubbing might not activate new ones; instead, it might affect the existing ones through pressure. So I might not be correct.

Option J suggests the optic nerve gets disoriented, causing random patterns. The optic nerve transmits signals, but I think the issue is more with the retina and how signals are being sent, not the nerve being disoriented. So J doesn't seem right.

Putting it all together, the most plausible explanation is G. When you rub your eyes, the pressure directly stimulates the receptor cells in the retina. These cells are normally activated by light, but under pressure, they send signals to the brain as if light is present, creating the visual patterns we see.

The phenomenon occurs because pressure from rubbing activates the receptor nerve cells in the retina, which then send signals to the brain, creating the illusion of light. 

Answer: G
