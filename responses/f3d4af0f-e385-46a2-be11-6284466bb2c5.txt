Okay, so I have this question about abelian groups, specifically two statements, and I need to figure out if they're true or false. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, Statement 1 says, "There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank." I remember that a free abelian group is basically like a free group but with the added structure of being abelian. So, in group theory, a free abelian group of rank n is isomorphic to ℤⁿ, right? That's the direct product of n copies of the integers. So for any positive integer n, like 1, 2, 3, etc., we can construct such a group. For example, ℤ is a free abelian group of rank 1, ℤ×ℤ is rank 2, and so on. So it seems like Statement 1 is true because for any positive integer, we can form a free abelian group with that rank.

Moving on to Statement 2: "A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set." Hmm, let's parse this. I know that the Betti number of a group is the rank of the free abelian part in the group's decomposition. For a finitely generated abelian group, it's the number of copies of ℤ in its structure theorem decomposition. 

Wait, so the Betti number is the number of free generators, if I'm not mistaken. And the generating set's size would be the minimal number of generators needed for the group. For a finitely generated abelian group, if it's free abelian, then its structure theorem tells us it's isomorphic to ℤᵏ for some k, where k is the Betti number. So in that case, the Betti number equals the rank, which is the size of any generating set because in a free abelian group, any basis has exactly k elements.

But wait, the statement says the Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. So suppose G is a finitely generated abelian group. Its Betti number is the dimension of its torsion-free part. Now, if G is free abelian, then it's torsion-free, and its Betti number is equal to its rank, which is the size of any minimal generating set. But what if G isn't free abelian? Then it would have a non-trivial torsion part, and the Betti number would still be the rank of the free part.

So the statement is saying that if the Betti number equals the size of some generating set, then G is free abelian. Let's think: if G is not free abelian, then it has torsion. The minimal generating set (a basis) would include the torsion elements plus the free generators. So the size of the generating set would be at least the Betti number (the number of free generators) plus the number of torsion elements. Therefore, if the Betti number equals the size of some generating set, that would mean there are no torsion elements, because otherwise the generating set would have more elements than just the Betti number.

Wait, but the statement says "some generating set." So even if G has torsion, there might be a generating set that includes the torsion elements, but the size would be at least the Betti number. But the Betti number is the rank, which is the minimal number of generators needed for the free part. So if the Betti number equals the size of some generating set, does that imply there's no torsion?

Wait, let me think again. Let's take an example. Suppose G is ℤ × ℤ/2ℤ. Then G is finitely generated. Its Betti number is 2 because the free part is ℤ². Now, what's the minimal number of generators? Let's see, we can write G as generated by (1,0), (0,1), and (0,1+2ℤ). Wait, no, actually, the group is generated by two elements: (1,0) and (0,1), but (0,1) has order 2. So the generating set has size 2, which equals the Betti number (2). But G is not free abelian because it has torsion. So in this case, the Betti number equals the size of a generating set, but G isn't free abelian. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, that's a counterexample. So if G is ℤ² × ℤ/2ℤ, it's generated by two elements, and the Betti number is 2, but G isn't free abelian. So Statement 2 is false because the condition doesn't necessarily make G free abelian.

Wait, wait, in my example, I think I made a mistake. Let me correct that. Wait, actually, ℤ² × ℤ/2ℤ would have Betti number 2, but a generating set can be of size 3 because you need to generate the free part and the torsion part. Wait, no, in reality, ℤ × ℤ/2ℤ is generated by two elements: (1,0) and (0,1), where (0,1) has order 2. So the size of the generating set is 2, which equals the Betti number (2). But the group isn't free abelian because it has torsion. So that's a valid counterexample, showing that Statement 2 is false.

Therefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. So looking at the options, the one that says Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false is option G: True, False.

The first statement is true because free abelian groups of any positive integer rank exist, such as ℤⁿ for any n. The second statement is false because a finitely generated abelian group with its Betti number equal to the size of some generating set may still have torsion, as shown by the counterexample ℤ × ℤ/2ℤ.
