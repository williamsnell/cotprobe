Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to convert two logical expressions into reverse Polish notation, also known as postfix notation. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what reverse Polish notation is. RPN is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. This is different from the usual infix notation where operators are placed between operands. For example, the infix expression (a + b) * c would be written as ab+c* in RPN.

The question has two parts, (a) and (b). I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): (Z ↓ ( ( (X) ⊗ Y ) / (X ⊗ Z ) > (Y ≡ X ) ) )

Wait, I need to parse this correctly. The main operator here is ↓, which has a complex subexpression as its operand. Let me parse the structure.

The expression inside the ↓ is: ( ( (X⊗Y) / (X⊗Z) ) > (Y ≡ X) )

So the entire expression is Z ↓ ( [ (X⊗Y)/(X⊗Z) > (Y ≡ X) ] )

I think I should handle the innermost operations first. Let's break it down.

First, the subexpression (X⊗Y) is straightforward. Then, (X⊗Z) is another operation. Next, we have a division ( / ) between these two results: (X⊗Y)/(X⊗Z). 

Then, we have a comparison operator (>) between this division result and another comparison (Y ≡ X). So the structure is:

( (X⊗Y)/(X⊗Z) ) > (Y ≡ X)

So the order of operations here is: first compute X⊗Y, then X⊗Z, then divide those two results, then compare that with Y ≡ X.

Finally, the entire thing is fed into the ↓ operator with Z.

Now, to convert this into RPN. Let's handle each part step by step.

Let me write the expression in infix form with parentheses to make it clearer:

Z ↓ ( ( (X ⊗ Y) / (X ⊗ Z) ) > (Y ≡ X) )

So, the innermost parts are X⊗Y and X⊗Z. Each of these will be converted to RPN as XY⊗ and XZ⊗ respectively.

Then, the division (X⊗Y)/(X⊗Z) becomes (XY⊗)(XZ⊗)/. So that's XY⊗ XZ⊗ /.

Next, we have Y ≡ X. That's Y followed by X with ≡, so YX≡.

Then, we have the comparison between the division result and Y ≡ X. So, the division result is on the left, YX≡ is on the right, and the operator is >. So that would be (XY⊗ XZ⊗ / ) (YX≡) >. In RPN, that's XY⊗ XZ⊗ / YX≡ >.

Now, this entire subexpression is the argument for the ↓ operator with Z. So the order is Z, followed by the subexpression, then the ↓ operator. So in RPN, it's Z followed by the subexpression, then ↓. So the RPN for part (a) would be Z XY⊗ XZ⊗ / YX≡ > ↓.

Wait, but looking at the options, the RPN for part (a) would be arranged as Z followed by X, Y, ⊗, X, Z, ⊗, /, Y, X, ≡, >, then ↓.

Now, looking at the options, let's see how they present part (a). The options are given as a part of the string, so I need to see which option matches this structure.

Looking at option A: ZXY \odot XZ \odot / Y \equiv X > \downarrow

So, Z, X, Y, ⊗, X, Z, ⊗, /, Y, X, ≡, >, ↓. That seems to match what I derived.

Now, moving to part (b): (X / Y) / ( (X / X) / (Y / Y) )

This is a nested division. Let's parse it step by step.

The main structure is (X/Y) divided by ( (X/X) / (Y/Y) ).

In infix, division is left-associative, so we can parse it as:

( (X / Y) ) / ( ( (X / X) / (Y / Y) ) )

But let me break it down:

First, compute X/Y as XY/.

Then, compute X/X as XX/ and Y/Y as YY/.

Then, divide those two: (XX/ ) / (YY/ ) → which would be XX/ YY/ /.

Wait, no. Wait, in RPN, when you have a / b / c, it's a b / c /, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The denominator is ( (X/X) / (Y/Y) ). So first compute X/X, which is XX/, then Y/Y is YY/. Then, divide those two: (XX/) / (YY/) → which is XX/ YY/ /.

So the denominator becomes XX/ YY/ /.

Then, the entire expression is (X/Y) divided by (XX/ YY/ / ), which in RPN would be XY/ (XX/ YY/ / ) /.

Wait, but RPN requires that the operators come after their operands. So the entire expression is:

First, compute X/Y → XY/.

Then, compute X/X → XX/.

Then, compute Y/Y → YY/.

Then, compute (XX/) / (YY/) → which is XX/ YY/ /.

Now, the main expression is (XY/) divided by (XX/ YY/ / ), which is XY/ [XX/ YY/ / ] /.

In RPN, that would be XY/ XX/ YY/ / /.

Wait, let me structure this correctly.

The main expression is (X/Y) / ( (X/X) / (Y/Y) )

In RPN, the steps are:

1. Compute X/Y → XY/.

2. Compute X/X → XX/.

3. Compute Y/Y → YY/.

4. Compute (X/X) / (Y/Y) → which is (XX/) (YY/) / → so XX/ YY/ /.

5. Then, divide (X/Y) by the result of step 4 → which is XY/ (XX/ YY/ / ) / → in RPN, that's XY/ XX/ YY/ / /.

So the RPN for part (b) is XY/ XX/ YY/ / /.

Now, looking back at the options, let's see how part (b) is represented.

Looking at option A: ... YX / XX / YY / / /

Wait, option A's part (b) is YX / XX / YY / / /. That doesn't seem right. Because in part (b), the first operation is X/Y, which would be XY/, not YX/.

Wait, but in RPN, the order matters. If the expression is X/Y, it's XY/. So the first operand is X, then Y, then /.

So the correct RPN for part (b) should start with XY/, then the denominator part.

Looking at the options:

Option A: For part (b), it's YX / XX / YY / / / → which is Y then X then /, which would be Y/X, not X/Y. So that's incorrect.

Option B: ... YX / XX / YY / / / → same as A, YX/ is Y/X, which is wrong.

Option C: Part (b) is XY / XX / YY / / / → Wait, does option C have that? Let me check.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: ZXY \odot XZ \odot / Y \equiv X > \downarrow, YX / XX / YY / / /

So part (b) is YX / XX / YY / / / → which is Y/X, then XX/, YY/, etc. So that's wrong.

Option B: ... YX \equiv > \downarrow, XY / XX / YY / / /

Wait, part (b) in option B is XY / XX / YY / / / → that's correct.

Wait, no, in option B's part (b), the first part after the comma is XY / XX / YY / / /.

Wait, the options are presented as two parts, (a) and (b), separated by a comma. So for option B, the first part is ZXY \odot XZ \odot / YX \equiv > \downarrow, and the second part is XY / XX / YY / / /.

Wait, that would make part (a) as ZXY⊗ XZ⊗ / YX≡ > ↓, which is Z X Y ⊗ X Z ⊗ / Y X ≡ > ↓ → which matches what we derived for part (a). And part (b) is XY/ XX/ YY/ / /, which is correct.

So option B seems to have both parts correct.

Wait, but let me check all options.

Option A: Part (a) ZXY⊗ XZ⊗ / Y \equiv X > ↓ → which is correct. Part (b) is YX/ XX/ YY/ / / → which is Y/X, which is incorrect because part (b) should be X/Y.

So option A's part (b) is wrong.

Option B: Part (a) is correct, part (b) is correct.

Option C: Part (a) is ZYX⊗ XZ⊗ / YX≡ > ↓ → that would be Z Y X ⊗ X Z ⊗ / Y X ≡ > ↓, which is Z⊗Y⊗X, but that's not correct because the original part (a) has (X⊗Y)/(X⊗Z), so the order should be X⊗Y first. So option C's part (a) is wrong.

Option D: Part (a) ZX⊗ YXZ⊗ / Y≡X> X↓ → Not sure, but seems incorrect.

Option E: The expression seems to have some issues, like maybe using ceil instead of the correct operators.

Option F: Part (a) seems to have YZ⊗, which might be incorrect.

Option G: Maybe similar to E, perhaps with incorrect operators.

Option H: Part (a) has YXZ⊗ which might not be correct.

Option I and J: They seem to have similar issues as E and others.

So, the correct option would be option B, where part (a) is correctly converted to ZXY⊗ XZ⊗ / YX≡ > ↓, and part (b) is correctly XY/ XX/ YY/ / /.

Wait, but looking back at part (a), the correct RPN is Z XY⊗ XZ⊗ / YX≡ > ↓, which is option B's part (a).

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option B.
</think>

The correct answer is option B, as it correctly converts both parts (a) and (b) into reverse Polish notation.

B
