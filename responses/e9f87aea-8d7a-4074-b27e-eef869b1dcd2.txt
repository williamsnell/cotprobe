Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the standard enthalpy of combustion for ethylbenzene. Hmm, I remember that combustion reactions involve a substance reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. The standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance combusts completely under standard conditions.

The given data is the standard enthalpy of formation of ethylbenzene, which is -12.5 kJ/mol. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So ethylbenzene is C8H8, right? Wait, no, wait. Ethylbenzene is C6H5CH2CH3, which is C8H10. Oh wait, but sometimes I might get confused between ethylbenzene and toluene. Toluene is C7H8, ethylbenzene is C8H10. So formula is C8H10.

To find the enthalpy of combustion, I think I need to use Hess's Law, which involves the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants.

The combustion reaction for ethylbenzene would be:

C8H10(l) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Wait, need to balance it. Let me write the reaction correctly.

The general formula for combustion is:

C8H10(l) + 12.5 O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(l)

Wait, that's because: 8 carbons from C8H10, so 8 CO2. For hydrogen, 10 hydrogens become 5 H2O.

So the balanced equation would be:

C8H10(l) + 12.5 O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(l)

Now, the standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔcH°) is calculated using the enthalpies of formation (ΔfH°) of the products and reactants.

The formula is:

ΔcH° = [sum ΔfH°(products)] - [sum ΔfH°(reactants)]

The products are 8 moles of CO2 and 5 moles of H2O. The reactants are 1 mole of C8H10 and 12.5 moles of O2.

I know that the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2(g) is -393.5 kJ/mol, and for H2O(l) it's -285.8 kJ/mol. O2 is in its standard state, so ΔfH° is 0.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔcH° = [8*(-393.5) + 5*(-285.8)] - [1*(-12.5) + 12.5*(0)]

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, the products' sum:

8 * (-393.5) = 8 * (-393.5) = Let's compute that. 393.5 * 8: 393*8=3144, 0.5*8=4, so 3148. So 8*(-393.5) = -3148 kJ.

5 * (-285.8) = 5*(-285.8) = -1429 kJ.

So total for products: -3148 + (-1429) = -4577 kJ.

Now the reactants' sum:

1 * (-12.5) = -12.5 kJ.

12.5 * 0 = 0.

So total for reactants: -12.5 kJ.

So ΔcH° = (-4577) - (-12.5) = -4577 +12.5 = -4564.5 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's almost -4564.5 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, option A is -4564.7 kJ/mol. That's very close, so I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Ethylbenzene is C8H10, so the combustion would produce 8 CO2 and 5 H2O, correct? Let me check the stoichiometry again.

C8H10 has 8 C and 10 H. So 8 CO2 and 5 H2O. Yes, that's right. O2 is 12.5 moles.

Wait, but sometimes, the state of water can affect the value. If H2O were gaseous, the enthalpy would be different. But in this case, I think the problem assumes H2O is liquid, so I'm correct.

Also, the standard enthalpy of formation for C8H10 is given as -12.5 kJ/mol, so I used that correctly.

So the calculation comes out to approximately -4564.5 kJ/mol, which matches option A: -4564.7 kJ/mol. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding during calculations, I suppose.

The standard enthalpy of combustion is calculated using the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The balanced combustion reaction for ethylbenzene (C₈H₁₀) is:

C₈H₁₀(l) + 12.5 O₂(g) → 8 CO₂(g) + 5 H₂O(l)

Using the formula:

ΔcH° = [sum ΔfH°(products)] - [sum ΔfH°(reactants)]

The standard enthalpies of formation are:
- ΔfH°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol
- ΔfH°(H₂O) = -285.8 kJ/mol
- ΔfH°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol
- ΔfH°(C₈H₁₀) = -12.5 kJ/mol

Calculating the products' sum:
8 × (-393.5) = -3148 kJ  
5 × (-285.8) = -1429 kJ  
Total for products = -3148 + (-1429) = -4577 kJ

Calculating the reactants' sum:
1 × (-12.5) = -12.5 kJ  
12.5 × 0 = 0 kJ  
Total for reactants = -12.5 kJ

ΔcH° = (-4577) - (-12.5) = -4564.5 kJ/mol

The closest option is A: -4564.7 kJ/mol.
