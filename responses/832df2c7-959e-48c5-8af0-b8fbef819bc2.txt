Question:

One day, while visiting a plastic surgery clinic for a routine Botox treatment, a patient received an excessive dose of Botox from a new medical assistant on the staff. Her face frozen in a grotesque grimace, she demanded to speak to the doctor. The doctor said, "Listen, why don't you go over to the emergency room and send the bills to me? I'll take care of your medical expenses. " The patient subsequently sued the doctor for negligent hiring of the medical assistant and for damages. At trial, she proposes to call the doctor's administrative assistant, who was present during her conversation with the doctor. The patient wants the administrative assistant to testify to the doctor's offer to pay her medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects. The trial judge should

Options:

A: sustain the objection, as the administrative assistant is not qualified to testify on medical matters.
B: sustain the objection as an offer to pay the medical bills.
C: sustain the objection, as the conversation between the doctor and patient should be kept confidential.
D: overrule the objection, as the patient has a right to call any witness to support her case.
E: overrule the objection, as the testimony could provide context to the incident.
F: overrule the objection, as the administrative assistant's testimony could shed light on the doctor's character and integrity.
G: overrule the objection, because an offer to pay medical bills is an inferential admission.
H: overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring.
I: sustain the objection, because the patient's medical records are the best evidence of the doctor's negligence.
J: sustain the objection, as the doctor's offer does not directly imply guilt or negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation is a patient who went in for a Botox treatment but got an excessive dose from a new medical assistant. Her face froze, and she's suing the doctor for negligent hiring and damages. At trial, she wants to call the doctor's administrative assistant as a witness. The patient wants the assistant to testify about the doctor's offer to pay her medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects, and the question is what the trial judge should do.

The options are A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall some evidence rules, especially about hearsay and offers to pay medical expenses. I remember that offers to pay someone's medical bills can be considered admissions against interest. But I also think that such offers can sometimes be used as evidence of liability, but only under certain conditions.

In this case, the doctor told the patient to go to the ER and send the bills, and he'd take care of them. The patient is offering testimony about this statement. So the issue is whether this statement is admissible and whether the administrative assistant can testify about it.

Option B says to sustain the objection because it's an offer to pay the medical bills. But wait, isn't an offer to pay medical bills admissible as an admission by a party-opponent? I think under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. So the doctor's statement would be admissible as a party admission. That would mean the objection should be overruled, not sustained. So option B might not be correct because it suggests sustaining the objection, which would exclude the evidence.

Option G says overrule the objection because the offer is an inferential admission. That sounds right because the offer could imply that the doctor admits some level of responsibility. But I also need to consider whether the administrative assistant is a proper witness. Can they testify about what they heard? Yes, because they were present during the conversation. So the assistant can testify to the statement.

Looking at the other options, option C says to sustain because the conversation should be confidential. But patient-physician conversations are generally confidential, but in this case, the administrative assistant was present, so maybe she's not considered part of the confidential relationship. Or perhaps the offer to pay is an exception. I'm not sure, but I think the main issue here is the admissibility of the statement, not confidentiality.

Option H says overrule because the evidence is relevant to negligent hiring. The patient is suing for negligent hiring, so if the doctor's statement suggests he admitted liability, it might support the claim. But I'm not sure if the statement directly relates to negligent hiring. The main point is the offer itself as an admission.

Option J says to sustain because the offer doesn't directly imply negligence. But I think an offer to pay can be an admission of fault, so the court would likely allow it.

So putting it together, the correct ruling is to overrule the objection because the statement is an admission by a party-opponent. Therefore, the correct answer would be G: overrule, as the offer is an inferential admission.

Wait, but let me double-check. Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. The doctor's statement about paying the bills would be within the scope of his practice. So the statement is admissible as a party admission. Therefore, the administrative assistant can testify to it, so the objection should be overruled. That points to option G.

Alternatively, option E says overrule because it provides context. But the main reason is that it's an admission, not just context. So G is better.

The correct answer is G: overrule the objection, as the offer to pay the medical bills is an inferential admission. The doctor's statement is admissible as a party admission under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the administrative assistant can testify to it.
