Question:

A participant in a single-trial free-recall task is presented with a list of words, one at a time, in the following order: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad. In accord with the serial position curve, which of the following words is the participant most likely to forget?

Options:

A: Salad
B: Computer
C: The last word presented
D: Dog
E: The word presented in the middle of the list
F: House
G: Water
H: Flower
I: License
J: Table

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the serial position curve and which word a participant is most likely to forget. Let me start by recalling what the serial position curve is about. From what I remember, it's a concept in psychology that describes how the position of an item in a list affects its likelihood of being remembered. The idea is that the first items and the last items are remembered better than the ones in the middle. This is often visualized as a curve where the beginning and end have higher recall rates, and the middle is lower.

The question gives a list of words: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad. So that's eight words in total. The task is a single-trial free-recall task, meaning the participant sees each word one at a time and then tries to recall them in any order after being tested once.

The options are A through J, each corresponding to a specific word or position. The question is asking which word is most likely to be forgotten. According to the serial position curve, the middle items are the ones that are least likely to be remembered. So, I need to figure out which word is in the middle of the list.

Let me count the positions. The first word is house (1), then flower (2), dog (3), table (4), license (5), water (6), computer (7), and salad (8). So there are eight words. The middle would be between the 4th and 5th items because 8 divided by 2 is 4, so the middle is around position 4 and 5. Wait, no, actually, for an even number, the middle is between 4 and 5. So, the exact middle would be the 4th and 5th items. But the question is about the most forgotten, which would be the ones in the middle part, maybe the 4th or 5th.

Looking at the options, E is "The word presented in the middle of the list." So, if the list has eight words, the middle would be the 4th and 5th. The 4th word is table, and the 5th is license. Wait, but the options include both E and I (license) and J (table). Hmm, but the question is asking for the word most likely to be forgotten, which is the middle one.

Alternatively, sometimes the serial position effect shows that the middle items have the lowest recall. So, the 4th and 5th are in the middle. But in some cases, the exact middle might have lower recall than the surrounding ones. So, perhaps the 4th and 5th are the most forgotten.

But the options are specific words. E is the middle word, which would be either table or license, depending on how you count. Wait, the list is 8 words, so the middle is between 4th and 5th. So, the 4th word is table, and the 5th is license. So, both are in the middle.

Looking at the options, E is "The word presented in the middle of the list." So that would be either table or license. But the options also have I: license and J: table. So, if the question is asking which word is most forgotten, it would be one of these two. But the options also have E as a choice, which is a general statement about the middle word.

Wait, the question is phrased as which word is the participant most likely to forget. So, if E is an option that refers to the middle word, and the middle words are the least recalled, then E would be the correct answer. Alternatively, if the question expects a specific word, then perhaps the exact middle is the 4th or 5th word. Wait, another thought: sometimes the serial position curve refers to the "recency effect," where the last few items are better remembered, and the first few are better than the middle. So, the middle is the least recalled.

In the list of 8 words, the middle would be positions 4 and 5. So, the 4th word is table (J), and the 5th is license (I). So, both J and I are in the middle. But the question is which is most likely to be forgotten. Since both are in the middle, perhaps the exact middle is the 4th or 5th. Alternatively, maybe the 5th is a bit more towards the end, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the serial position curve typically shows that the first few and the last few are better remembered, with a U-shaped curve. The middle items have lower recall. So, the word in the exact middle would be the least recalled. For an even number of items, the middle is between 4th and 5th. So, both are equally in the middle. But the options have E as the middle word, which would be either, but the question is asking which word is most forgotten, so perhaps E is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether the last word is better remembered, but that's the recency effect. Wait, the question is about which is most likely to be forgotten, so the middle. So, the answer should be E: The word presented in the middle of the list.

Wait, but looking back at the options, E is "The word presented in the middle of the list," which would be either table or license. So, the participant is most likely to forget the middle word. So, the answer is E. But wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A: Salad
B: Computer
C: The last word presented
D: Dog
E: The word presented in the middle of the list
F: House
G: Water
H: Flower
I: License
J: Table

So, if E is correct, that's the answer. Alternatively, if the question is expecting the exact middle word, which is either I or J, but E is a general choice. So, perhaps E is the correct answer.

The serial position curve predicts that words in the middle of a list are least likely to be remembered. In this case, the list has eight words, so the middle falls between the 4th and 5th items: "table" (J) and "license" (I). Since the question asks for the word most likely to be forgotten, the correct answer is the general option referring to the middle word.

Answer: E
