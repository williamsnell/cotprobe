Okay, so I've got this problem here about Reeves Corporation and their dividends. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question says that Reeves Corporation is going to pay a total dividend of $50,000 for the year. They have two types of stock: preferred and common. Specifically, there are 1,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a 6% par value of $50. And then there are 5,000 shares of common stock. I need to find the dividends per share for each class.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that preferred stock dividends are usually fixed, based on the par value and the dividend rate. So for preferred stock, the dividend per share is calculated by multiplying the par value by the dividend rate.

The par value is $50, and the rate is 6%. So for each preferred share, the dividend should be 50 * 6% = $3 per share. Since there are 1,000 preferred shares, the total preferred dividend would be 1,000 * $3 = $3,000.

Now, the total dividends are $50,000, so the remaining amount after preferred dividends goes to the common stockholders. That would be $50,000 - $3,000 = $47,000 left for common stock.

There are 5,000 common shares, so the dividend per common share is $47,000 divided by 5,000. Let me do that calculation: 47,000 รท 5,000. Hmm, 5,000 goes into 47,000 nine times (because 5,000 * 9 = 45,000) with a remainder of 2,000. So that's $9.40 per common share, right? Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate it properly. 47,000 divided by 5,000 is 9.4. Oh, so it's $9.40 per common share.

Wait, but let me double-check. 5,000 shares times $9.40 is 5,000 * 9.4 = 47,000. Yep, that adds up correctly because 3,000 (preferred) + 47,000 (common) = 50,000, which matches the total dividend.

Looking at the answer options, I need to find the one where preferred is $3 per share and common is $9.40 per share. Let me go through the options quickly.

Option J says $3 for preferred and $9.40 for common. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be J.

The preferred stock dividend per share is calculated as 6% of the $50 par value, which is $3. With 1,000 shares, the total preferred dividend is $3,000. The remaining $47,000 is for common stock, divided by 5,000 shares, giving $9.40 per common share. Option J matches these figures.
