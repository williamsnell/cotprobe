Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields from a charge distribution. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says the charge density ρ varies with radius r as ρ = a*r, where a is a positive constant. The distribution exists out to radius R. I need to find out what the electric field strength is like at a distance r from the center. The options are about whether it increases or decreases, and how, depending on whether r is less than or greater than R.

First, I remember that electric fields due to charge distributions can be found using Gauss's Law. Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a Gaussian surface to the charge enclosed by that surface. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, where Φ is the electric flux, Q_enc is the enclosed charge, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity.

So, for a spherical charge distribution, the Gaussian surface would be a sphere of radius r. The electric field E at radius r would be the same at every point on this sphere, and the flux Φ is E multiplied by the surface area of the sphere, which is 4πr². So, Φ = E * 4πr².

Now, I need to find Q_enc, the charge enclosed within radius r. Since the charge density varies with r, I can't just use a simple formula. Instead, I'll integrate the charge over the volume.

The charge enclosed Q is the integral of ρ over the volume. Since ρ = a*r, I'll set up the integral in spherical coordinates. The volume element dV in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr, because for each thin spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr, the volume is surface area times dr.

So Q_enc = ∫ (from 0 to r) ρ(r') * 4π r'² dr'. Substituting ρ = a*r', this becomes Q_enc = ∫0^r a r' * 4π r'² dr'. Simplifying the integrand: a*4π ∫0^r r'^3 dr'. The integral of r'^3 dr' is (r'^4)/4. So evaluating from 0 to r gives (a*4π) * (r^4/4 - 0) = a π r^4.

Wait, let me double-check that. The integral is ∫r'^3 dr' from 0 to r, which is (r^4)/4. Multiplying by 4πa gives Q_enc = a *4π * (r^4/4) = a π r^4. So Q_enc = a π r^4.

Now, using Gauss's Law: E * 4π r² = Q_enc / ε₀. Substituting Q_enc, we get E = (a π r^4) / (ε₀ * 4π r²) ) = (a r²) / (4 ε₀ ). So E = (a/(4 ε₀)) r².

Hmm, wait, that's for r ≤ R, because the charge distribution only goes up to R. So when r is less than or equal to R, the charge enclosed is a π r^4, and E is proportional to r squared.

What about when r is greater than R? Then the Gaussian surface encloses all the charge, so Q_enc is the total charge in the sphere of radius R. Let's compute that.

Q_total = ∫0^R a r' * 4π r'² dr' = a 4π ∫0^R r'^3 dr' = a 4π (R^4/4) )= a π R^4.

So for r > R, E * 4π r² = (a π R^4) / ε₀. Solving for E gives E = (a π R^4) / (4 π ε₀ r²) ) = (a R^4) / (4 ε₀ r² ). So E is proportional to 1/r² when r > R.

Wait, but in the case of r > R, for a point charge, which this total charge would look like, the electric field falls off as 1/r². So E decreases as r increases beyond R.

So, putting it together: for r < R, E is proportional to r², so it increases as r increases. For r > R, E is proportional to 1/r², so it decreases as r increases.

Looking at the options, I need to see which ones match this behavior.

Option A: It increases as r approaches infinity. Wait, for r much larger than R, E should go as 1/r², which would decrease as r approaches infinity. So A is incorrect.

Option B: It increases exponentially for r > R. No, because E decreases as 1/r², not exponential.

Option C: It increases linearly for r > R. No, it's 1/r², which is inverse square, so decreases.

Option D: It decreases non-linearly for r < R. Wait, for r < R, E is proportional to r², which increases, not decreases. So D is wrong.

Option E: It decreases exponentially for r < R. No, because E increases as r^2, a polynomial.

Option F: It increases non-linearly for r < R. Yes, because E is proportional to r squared, which is a non-linear increase, as opposed to linear. So F is true for r < R.

Option G: It decreases linearly for r > R. No, because 1/r² is a non-linear decrease.

Option H: It remains constant for r < R. No, because E increases as r².

Option I: It remains constant for r > R. No, E decreases as 1/r².

Wait, but the question is asking which of the options is true about the electric field strength. So each option applies to either r < R or r > R.

Looking at the options again, the question is about the behavior at a distance r from the center. So depending on whether r is less than R or greater than R, the behavior changes.

The options are:

A: Increases as r approaches infinity. When r approaches infinity, we're in r>R, and E decreases as 1/r², so it doesn't increase. So A is incorrect.

B: Increases exponentially for r>R. No, E decreases as 1/r², which is a power law, not exponential. So B is incorrect.

C: Increases linearly for r>R. No, E is inversely proportional to r squared, so it's a non-linear decrease.

D: Decreases non-linearly for r<R. Because E is r squared, which increases as r increases. So D says it decreases, which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

E: Decreases exponentially for r < R. No, E increases as r squared, which is a polynomial, not exponential. So E is incorrect.

F: Increases non-linearly for r < R. Yes, because E is proportional to r squared, which is a non-linear increase. So F is correct.

G: Decreases linearly for r>R. No, because it's 1/r², which is a non-linear decrease. So G is incorrect.

H: Remains constant for r < R. No, E increases with r squared. So H is incorrect.

I: Remains constant for r > R. No, E decreases as 1/r². So I is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is, "Which of the following is true of the electric field strength...?" So I'm looking for the statements that are correct based on our calculations.

So the correct statements are:

- For r < R: E increases as r squared. So E increases non-linearly, which is option F.

- For r > R: E decreases as 1/r squared, which is a non-linear decrease. So looking at the options, does any option mention this?

Looking at the options again:

Option I says it remains constant for r > R. Which is not true, because E decreases as 1/r². So I is incorrect.

Wait, but in the options, F says "It increases non-linearly for r < R." So that's correct.

Is there any other correct option? Let's check all the options again.

Option F is correct for r < R, but what about the behavior for r > R? Let me check if any option correctly describes that.

The options don't seem to have an option that correctly describes r > R as decreasing as 1/r², which is a non-linear decrease. But the options don't have that. So the only correct option among the choices given is F.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any options.

Looking again:

Options:

A: Increases as r approaches infinity. (Incorrect, because E decreases as 1/r²)

B: Increases exponentially for r > R. (No, 1/r² is not exponential)

C: Increases linearly for r > R. (No, 1/r² is non-linear)

D: Decreases non-linearly for r < R. (No, E increases for r < R)

E: Decreases exponentially for r < R. (No, E increases with r²)

F: Increases non-linearly for r < R. (Yes, E is proportional to r², which is non-linear)

G: Decreases linearly for r > R. (No, 1/r² is non-linear)

H: Remains constant for r < R. (No, E increases as r²)

I: Remains constant for r > R. (No, E decreases as 1/r²)

So the only correct option is F.

The electric field strength due to the charge distribution is determined using Gauss's Law. For a spherical charge distribution with ρ = a*r, the charge enclosed within radius r is calculated by integrating the charge density over the volume. This gives Q_enc = a π r⁴ for r ≤ R. Using Gauss's Law, the electric field for r ≤ R is found to be E = (a/(4 ε₀)) r², which increases non-linearly as r increases.

For r > R, the electric field is determined by the total charge enclosed within radius R, which is Q_total = a π R⁴. Applying Gauss's Law again, the electric field for r > R is E = (a R⁴)/(4 ε₀ r²), which decreases as 1/r², a non-linear decrease. However, none of the options correctly describe this behavior.

Among the given options, only **F** correctly states that the electric field increases non-linearly for r < R. 

Answer: F
