Okay, so I have this linear programming problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The goal is to maximize the function 3x + y, subject to some constraints. Let me write down the problem again to make sure I have it right.

Maximize 3x + y
Subject to:
1. -x + y ≤ 1
2. 2x + y ≤ 4
3. x ≥ 0
4. y ≥ 0

Hmm, I remember that in linear programming, the optimal solution lies at one of the vertices of the feasible region. So, I need to find the feasible region defined by these constraints and then evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum.

First, I think I should graph each inequality to visualize the feasible region. Let me start by rewriting each constraint as an equation to find the boundary lines.

1. -x + y = 1 → y = x + 1
2. 2x + y = 4 → y = -2x + 4
3. x = 0 (the y-axis)
4. y = 0 (the x-axis)

Now, I'll find the intercepts for each line to plot them.

For the first line, y = x + 1:
- When x=0, y=1.
- When y=0, x would be -1, but since x ≥ 0, this point isn't in our feasible region.

For the second line, y = -2x + 4:
- When x=0, y=4.
- When y=0, 0 = -2x +4 → x=2.

So, the lines intersect the axes at (0,1), (0,4), and (2,0).

Next, I need to find where these two lines intersect each other. That's the point where y = x +1 and y = -2x +4 meet.

Setting them equal:
x + 1 = -2x +4
Adding 2x to both sides: 3x +1 =4
Subtract 1: 3x=3 → x=1
Then y=1 +1=2. So, the intersection point is (1,2).

Now, the feasible region is bounded by these lines and the axes. I should sketch this mentally or perhaps on paper. The feasible region is a polygon, and the vertices are the points where these constraints intersect. So, the possible vertices are:

- (0,0): Where both x and y are zero.
- (0,1): Where -x + y =1 meets y-axis.
- (1,2): Where the two lines intersect.
- (2,0): Where 2x + y =4 meets the x-axis.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if all these points are within the feasible region. For example, does (0,4) lie within all constraints? Because in the second constraint, when x=0, y=4 is allowed, but let's see if it satisfies the first constraint. Plugging into -x + y ≤1: 0 +4=4 ≤1? No, 4 is not ≤1. So (0,4) is not in the feasible region. So the feasible region's vertices are actually (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0). Because (0,4) is outside.

Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me check each point.

At (0,0): All constraints are satisfied because 0 ≤ everything.

At (0,1): -x + y =1, which satisfies the first constraint. Also, 2x + y =1 ≤4, so yes.

At (1,2): Both constraints are satisfied because 2(1)+2=4 which is equal to 4, and -1 +2=1 which is equal to 1.

At (2,0): 2*2 +0=4 ≤4, and -2 +0= -2 ≤1. So yes.

So the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0).

Wait, but wait, does (0,1) and (1,2) and (2,0) form a polygon without any other points? I think so. So the feasible region is a polygon with four vertices.

Now, I need to evaluate the objective function 3x + y at each of these vertices to find which gives the maximum.

Let's compute:

- At (0,0): 3*0 +0=0
- At (0,1): 3*0 +1=1
- At (1,2): 3*1 +2=3+2=5
- At (2,0): 3*2 +0=6

Wait, so 6 is higher than 5, right? So (2,0) gives 6, which is higher than (1,2)'s 5.

But wait, does (2,0) satisfy all constraints?

Let me check again:

- Constraint 1: -2 +0 =-2 ≤1 → yes.
- Constraint 2: 2*2 +0=4 ≤4 → yes.
- x and y are non-negative, so yes.

So the maximum is at (2,0) with a value of 6.

Wait, but in the options given, I don't see (2,0). Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: [1, 2]

B: [0, 1]

C: [1, 1]

D: [4, 0]

E: [3, 0]

F: [2, 0]

G: [0, 2]

H: [0, 4]

I: [2, 2]

J: [1, 3]

So option F is [2, 0]. So that's the point where the maximum occurs.

Wait a second, but earlier I thought (1,2) gives 5, and (2,0) gives 6. So the maximum is at (2,0), which is option F.

But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Because when I plotted the feasible region, I thought the vertices were (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0). But wait, when I look at the constraints again, could there be another vertex? Let me think.

Wait, when x=0, from constraint 2, y can be up to 4, but constraint 1 limits y to 1 when x=0. So the feasible region's upper boundary at x=0 is y=1. So the point (0,1) is a vertex, but (0,4) is not in the feasible region.

So yes, the vertices are correct as I listed before.

Wait, but when I evaluated (2,0), I got 3x + y =6, which is higher than (1,2)'s 5. So why is option F [2,0] not the correct answer?

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options are given, and F is [2,0], which seems to be the point with maximum value.

But wait, let me double-check the constraints. Because sometimes I might have made a mistake in identifying the feasible region.

Wait, another approach is to solve the system of equations step by step.

Let me list all the constraints again:

1. -x + y ≤1 → y ≤x +1

2. 2x + y ≤4 → y ≤-2x +4

3. x ≥0

4. y ≥0

So, the feasible region is where all these are satisfied.

Now, the intersections:

- Intersection of y= x +1 and y= -2x +4 is at x=1, y=2.

- Intersection of y= -2x +4 with y=0 is x=2, y=0.

- Intersection of y= x +1 with y=0 is x=-1, which is not in feasible region because x≥0.

- Intersection of y= -2x +4 with x=0 is y=4, but that's not in feasible region because it doesn't satisfy y ≤x+1 (since 4>1).

So the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0).

Evaluating the objective function at each:

(0,0): 0

(0,1):1

(1,2):5

(2,0):6

So (2,0) gives the maximum value of 6.

Therefore, the optimal solution is [2,0], which is option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option D is [4,0], but since 4 isn't allowed because 2x + y ≤4, so x=4 would require y= -4, which isn't allowed because y≥0. So [4,0] is not feasible. So option F is correct.
</think>

The optimal solution occurs at the vertex (2,0), which corresponds to option F.
