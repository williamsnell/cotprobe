Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the development of peace studies in the twentieth century. I need to figure out which statement is not applicable. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict. I think this is true because peace studies often look beyond just state actors, considering global issues and other factors like non-governmental organizations or transnational issues.

Option B: At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was frequently labelled 'appeasement studies' and was bitterly opposed by critics. I remember that during the Cold War, especially in the US, promoting peace could be seen as soft on communism. So this makes sense. Critics probably dismissed it as appeasement.

Option C: Peace studies in the twentieth century focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare. Hmm, this seems too narrow. I think peace studies cover a broader range of issues, like other forms of conflict, not just nuclear. So maybe this is the incorrect statement.

Option D: The development of peace studies was largely influenced by the rise of feminism in the late twentieth century. Feminism brought attention to gender issues in conflict and peace, so yes, this influenced the field. So D is applicable.

Option E: Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping. I know that later in the century, especially post-Cold War, there was more focus on these areas. So E is correct.

Option F: The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War. This doesn't sound right. The Cold War's geopolitical tensions likely influenced what peace studies focused on. So F is probably the incorrect statement.

Option G: By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts. I think there were movements towards expanding the scope, but maybe they didn't achieve much at the time. This could be true.

Option H: By the end of the twentieth century, peace studies had become a universally accepted academic discipline. Hmm, I'm not sure if it's universally accepted. Some universities might have been slower to adopt it, but it's probably more established now. So H might be correct.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The question is which statement is NOT applicable. So looking back:

Option C says peace studies focused solely on preventing nuclear warfare. That's probably too narrow because peace studies also address other conflicts, human rights, etc. So C is not applicable.

Option F says the development wasn't affected by the Cold War. That's unlikely because the Cold War's issues would have influenced the study's focus, like deterrence, arms race, etc. So F is also a contender.

Wait, the question is which is NOT applicable. So which of these statements is false regarding the development.

If I think about it, I remember that during the Cold War, peace studies were sometimes dismissed, which supports B. So B is correct.

Looking back at F, if the Cold War did affect it, then F is incorrect. So F is the statement that's not applicable because the Cold War definitely influenced the field.

Wait, but the options are:

C: focused solely on nuclear prevention. That's incorrect because it's broader.

F: not affected by Cold War. Also incorrect.

But which one is the answer? The question is which is NOT applicable. So the incorrect statement.

I think the correct answer is F because the Cold War had a significant impact on peace studies. So F is not applicable.

Wait, but the options are options A to J, with F being "The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War." Since the Cold War influenced the field, F is incorrect. So F is the statement not applicable.

Wait, but the question is which statement is not applicable. So F is the answer. Or maybe C is the answer because it's too narrow.

Wait, I'm confused now. Let me think again.

Option C: focused solely on prevention of nuclear warfare. That's definitely incorrect because peace studies cover more. So C is not applicable.

Option F: not affected by the Cold War. That's also incorrect because it was influenced.

So the question is asking which is NOT applicable. So both C and F are incorrect statements about peace studies. But the options are from A to J, and the answer is one of them.

Wait, I need to pick the best answer. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

C: focused solely on nuclear prevention. That's not correct because peace studies include other areas.

F: not affected by Cold War. That's also incorrect because the Cold War influenced the field, perhaps by making it more about state-centric approaches.

So the question is which statement is NOT applicable. So the one that's not true.

So both C and F are incorrect. But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the answer is F because the Cold War did affect the development, so F is incorrect.

Alternatively, C is incorrect because it's too narrow.

I think the correct answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, F is the correct answer because the Cold War definitely influenced the field.

Wait, I think the answer is F because the Cold War had a significant impact. So the statement that it wasn't affected is incorrect.

Alternatively, C is incorrect because peace studies are broader.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The question is which is NOT applicable. So the statement that is false.

Option C says peace studies focused solely on nuclear prevention. That's too narrow, so it's not applicable. So C is the correct answer.

The question asks which statement is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century. After analyzing each option, the key points are as follows:

- **Option C** states that peace studies focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare. This is too narrow because peace studies encompass a broader range of issues, including other forms of conflict and global challenges. Therefore, this statement is not applicable.
- **Option F** claims that the development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War. This is incorrect because the Cold War significantly influenced the field, shaping its focus on state-centric approaches and conflict resolution.

Both options C and F are incorrect, but the question requires selecting one. Since peace studies are broader than nuclear prevention, **Option C** is the most clearly inapplicable statement.

Answer: C
