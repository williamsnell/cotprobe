Okay, so I've got this problem about miniature poodles' heights. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says that the mean height is 12 inches and the standard deviation is 1.8 inches. We're supposed to find the percentage of poodles that are taller than 14 inches, but the height is measured to the nearest inch. Hmm, so the actual height could be, for example, 14.5 inches, but it's recorded as 14 or 15 inches depending on the decimal part. Wait, no, I think the problem says height is measured to the nearest inch, so we're only considering integer values for height. So a poodle's height is recorded as an integer, like 12, 13, 14, etc., but the actual height could be up to 0.5 inches higher or lower than that. So, for example, a recorded height of 14 inches could mean the actual height is between 13.5 and 14.5 inches.

Wait, the problem is about poodles exceeding 14 inches when measured to the nearest inch. So, the recorded height is 14 inches if the actual height is between 13.5 and 14.5. But we're interested in poodles whose actual height is above 14 inches. Wait no, because when it's measured to the nearest inch, a poodle with, say, 14.1 inches would be recorded as 14 inches, not 15. So, the recorded height of 14 inches includes poodles from 13.5 to 14.499... inches. Similarly, a recorded height of 15 inches would be from 14.5 to 15.5 inches, and so on.

But the question is asking for the percentage of poodles whose height exceeds 14 inches. So, that would include those recorded as 14 inches and those recorded as 15 inches and above. Wait, no. Wait, if the recorded height is 14 inches, that's for 13.5 to 14.5. So, poodles with actual heights from 14.5 to 15.5 would be recorded as 15 inches. So, the question is about the actual height being more than 14 inches, but the measurement is to the nearest inch. Wait, no, the question says "height exceeding 14 inches," but the measurement is in whole inches. So, the recorded heights are 12,13,14,15, etc. Therefore, poodles with an actual height of 14.5 inches are recorded as 15 inches. So, any poodle with an actual height above 14.5 inches would be recorded as 15 inches, which is over 14. But the question is about poodles whose height is more than 14 inches, regardless of how it's recorded. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

The problem says, "find the percentage of poodles having a height exceeding 14 inches." But since the height is measured to the nearest inch, perhaps they mean that the recorded height is 14 inches or more. Wait, but the wording is "height exceeding 14 inches," so maybe it's the actual height, but since they measure to the nearest inch, perhaps we have to consider the possible actual heights that would round to 14 or higher.

Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler. Maybe the problem is just asking, given that heights are reported as whole numbers, what's the probability that a poodle's actual height is more than 14 inches. But that doesn't make sense because the measurement is to the nearest inch, so poodles with actual heights between 14.0 and 14.499... would be recorded as 14 inches, and those from 14.5 to 15.499... would be recorded as 15 inches, etc. So, the actual height exceeding 14 inches would include all measurements from 14.0 upwards, but that can't be right because the mean is 12 inches, so the distribution is around that.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of poodles whose recorded height is 14 inches or higher. Because the mean is 12, so 14 is higher than average. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states: "find the percentage of poodles having a height exceeding 14 inches." So, I think it's about the actual height, not the recorded height. But the recorded height is to the nearest inch, so perhaps we're to model the actual heights as continuous and then find the probability that the actual height is greater than 14 inches. Then, because the height is measured to the nearest inch, perhaps that affects the calculation. Or maybe it's just a standard normal distribution problem, and the measurement aspect is a red herring.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it as a normal distribution problem. The mean (μ) is 12, standard deviation (σ) is 1.8. We need to find P(X > 14), where X is the actual height. But since the measurement is to the nearest inch, perhaps we're considering the probability that the actual height is more than 14 inches. So, we can model this using the Z-score.

Z = (X - μ) / σ. So, for X = 14, Z = (14 - 12)/1.8 = 2/1.8 ≈ 1.1111.

Now, we can look up the Z-table for Z = 1.11. The standard normal distribution table gives the area to the left of Z. So, for Z = 1.11, the area is about 0.8662. That means P(X ≤ 14) ≈ 86.62%, so P(X > 14) = 1 - 0.8662 ≈ 0.1338, or 13.38%. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are A:45%, B:2.5%, C:5%, D:30%, E:20%, F:10%, G:15%, H:35%, I:40%, J:25%.

Wait, 13.38% isn't an option. Hmm, did I miscalculate? Let me check the Z-score again. 14-12=2, divided by 1.8 is indeed 1.1111. The Z-table for 1.11 gives 0.8662, so the area to the right is 0.1338, which is about 13.38%. So that's approximately 13.4%.

Looking at the options, the closest one would be F:10%, G:15%, or H:35%. Wait, 13.38 is closer to 15% (option G) than to 10% (option F). But none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the percentage of poodles whose recorded height is 14 inches or more, meaning that their actual height is at least 14.0 inches. But wait, the recorded height of 14 inches corresponds to actual heights between 13.5 and 14.5 inches. So, if the question is about poodles whose recorded height is 14 inches or higher, that would include poodles whose actual height is 13.5 inches and above. But that doesn't make sense because the problem states "exceeding 14 inches," which implies actual height, not recorded.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the recorded height as the exact value. No, that can't be, because the measurement is to the nearest inch, so the recorded height is just a rounded value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that we're supposed to model the possible heights as integers and compute the probability that the actual height is above 14, considering the rounding. So, perhaps the actual height could be between 14.0 and 14.5 to be recorded as 14, and anything above 14.5 would be recorded as 15, which is exceeding 14 when measured as an integer. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the actual height is greater than 14.5 inches, because that's when the recorded height would be 15 inches, which is above 14 inches.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the question is about poodles whose recorded height is 15 inches or more, which would correspond to actual heights of 14.5 inches and above. So, we need to calculate P(X > 14.5), where X is the actual height.

Using the same Z-score formula: Z = (14.5 - 12)/1.8 = 2.5 / 1.8 ≈ 1.3889.

Looking up Z = 1.3889 in the standard normal table. Let me think, Z=1.38 is about 0.9162, and Z=1.39 is about 0.9177. So, for 1.3889, it's approximately 0.9175. Therefore, P(X ≤ 14.5) ≈ 0.9175, so P(X >14.5) = 1 - 0.9175 = 0.0825, or 8.25%. Hmm, that's about 8.25%, which is closest to option F:10%, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the recorded height of 14 inches corresponds to actual heights from 13.5 to 14.5, so if we're looking for poodles taller than 14 inches, that would be poodles with actual heights greater than 14.5 inches. So, that's where the 14.5 comes in.

Wait, but according to my calculation, that gives about 8.25%, which isn't an option. The options are 2.5%,5%,10%, etc. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of poodles whose recorded height is 14 inches or more, meaning that their actual height is at least 14 inches. Wait, but that's not how rounding works. Wait, if the recorded height is 14 inches, the actual height could be as low as 13.5 inches. So, if the question is asking for poodles whose recorded height is more than 14 inches, that would be those recorded as 15 inches and above. So, their actual heights are 14.5 and above.

So, perhaps I should calculate P(X >=14.5). Let me redo that.

Z = (14.5 -12)/1.8 = 2.5 /1.8 ≈1.3889.

As before, the area to the left of Z=1.3889 is approximately 0.9175, so the area to the right is 1 - 0.9175 = 0.0825, or 8.25%. That's about 8.25%, which is closest to option F:10%, but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the percentage of poodles whose recorded height is more than 14 inches, which would include those recorded as 14 inches and above. Wait, no—wait, 14 inches is the recorded value. So, if the recorded height is 14, that's actual heights between 13.5 and 14.5. If we're looking for poodles whose recorded height is more than 14 inches, that would be 15 and above, which corresponds to actual heights from 14.5 to 15.5, etc.

Wait, but the question says "height exceeding 14 inches." So, if the actual height is 14.1 inches, that's more than 14 inches, but it would be recorded as 14 inches. So, perhaps the problem is about the actual height being more than 14 inches, regardless of the recorded value. So, in that case, we don't need to worry about the rounding. We just calculate P(X >14), where X is the actual height.

Earlier, I calculated that as approximately 13.38%. But that's not an option either. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple Z-score calculation without considering the rounding, and the options are approximate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Z-score. Let me check again.

Z = (14 - 12)/1.8 = 2/1.8 ≈1.1111.

Looking up Z=1.11 in the standard normal table: the area to the left is approximately 0.8662, so the area to the right is 1 - 0.8662 = 0.1338, which is 13.38%. Hmm, but that's not one of the options either. The closest options are F:10% and G:15%.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the measurement to the nearest inch, so the actual height could only be integer values. So, perhaps the distribution is discrete, with possible heights at 12,13,14,... etc. But that seems unlikely because heights are continuous variables. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for P(X >=14), treating X as a continuous variable, without considering the rounding, which would give 13.38%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the continuity correction. Since the measurement is to the nearest inch, perhaps we should adjust the cutoff by 0.5 inches. So, if we're looking for P(X >14), we can model it as P(X >14.5) when dealing with a discrete variable. Wait, that's what I did earlier, which gave 8.25%. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the probability that a poodle's height is more than 14 inches, treating the distribution as continuous, and using the Z-score without considering the measurement rounding. So, 13.38%, which is closest to option F:10% or G:15%. Since 13.38 is closer to 13.38, which is between 10 and 15, but closer to 13.38 is 13.38, which is about 13.4%, so perhaps the intended answer is 10% or 15%. But neither is exactly correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Z-table lookup. Let me double-check. For Z=1.11, the cumulative probability is indeed about 0.8662. So, 1 - 0.8662 is 0.1338, which is 13.38%.

Hmm, maybe the options are approximate, and the closest is 15%, option G. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of poodles whose height is recorded as more than 14 inches. So, that would include those recorded as 14 inches and above. But that doesn't make sense because 14 inches is the cutoff. No, the question is about exceeding 14 inches, so perhaps the recorded height being 15 inches and above. So, the actual height would be 14.5 inches and above.

Wait, let me recalculate using 14.5 as the cutoff.

Z = (14.5 -12)/1.8 = 2.5/1.8 ≈1.3889.

Now, looking up Z=1.3889. The standard normal table gives for Z=1.38, 0.9162, and for Z=1.39, 0.9177. So, 1.3889 is approximately halfway between 1.38 and 1.39, so the area would be about (0.9162 + 0.9177)/2 ≈0.91695. So, the area to the right is 1 - 0.91695 ≈0.08305, which is 8.305%, so about 8.3%.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:10%. So, perhaps the intended answer is F:10%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the Z-score without considering the continuity correction, leading to 13.38%, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is 2.5%. Wait, that's option B, which is much lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is intended to be a simple Z-score calculation without considering the measurement rounding. So, P(X >14) is 13.38%, which is closest to option F:10% or G:15%. Since 13.38 is closer to 13.38, which is between 10 and 15, but neither is exact. However, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest option, which would be 13.38% to 13%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the height is measured to the nearest inch, so the actual height can only take integer values. Therefore, the distribution is discrete, and we can model it as such. So, the possible heights are 12,13,14,15,... inches. So, the probability that a poodle's height is 14 inches or more would be the sum of the probabilities of each integer height >=14.

But that's a bit more complicated. Let me try that approach.

First, the mean is 12, standard deviation is 1.8. So, for each integer k >=14, we can calculate the probability that X is in the interval [k-0.5, k+0.5), which corresponds to being recorded as k inches.

So, for k=14, the interval is [13.5,14.5). For k=15, it's [14.5,15.5), etc.

We need to find the sum of probabilities for k=14,15,16,... But since the distribution is normal, the probabilities beyond a certain point become negligible. Let's compute P(X >=14).

Wait, but in this approach, we can calculate the probability that the actual height is in [13.5, infinity), which would correspond to being recorded as 14 or higher. But that's not exactly correct because the question is about poodles whose height exceeds 14 inches, which would be actual heights >14 inches. So, the recorded height would be >=15 inches, corresponding to actual heights >=14.5 inches.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is asking for P(X >=14.5). Let's compute that.

Z = (14.5 -12)/1.8 ≈1.3889.

As before, the area to the left is ~0.91695, so the area to the right is ~0.08305, or 8.3%. So, about 8.3%, which is closest to option F:10%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple Z-score without continuity correction, giving 13.38%, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is 2.5%, option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try to compute the exact probability using the continuity correction.

The continuity correction for P(X >14) in a continuous distribution would be P(X >14.5), which is what I calculated earlier as ~8.3%.

Since 8.3% is closest to 10%, option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple Z-score without considering the measurement aspect, leading to 13.38%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 2.5%, option B.

Wait, perhaps I should check the Z-score again. Let me make sure I'm using the correct approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of poodles whose recorded height is 14 inches or higher, which includes poodles with actual heights from 13.5 to infinity. So, that would be P(X >=13.5).

Calculating that:

Z = (13.5 -12)/1.8 =1.5 /1.8≈0.8333.

Looking up Z=0.8333, the area to the left is approximately 0.7986. So, P(X >=13.5)=1 -0.7986=0.2014, or 20.14%, which is closest to option E:20%. But that doesn't make sense because the question is about exceeding 14 inches, not 13.5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The question is: "find the percentage of poodles having a height exceeding 14 inches."

So, the actual height is more than 14 inches. So, the recorded height would be 15 inches or more if the actual height is >=14.5 inches. So, the probability is P(X >=14.5), which is ~8.3%, closest to 10%, option F.

But the options don't have 8%, so perhaps the intended answer is 2.5%, option B, but that seems too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Z-score calculation. Let me recalculate.

Z = (14.5 -12)/1.8 =2.5/1.8≈1.3889.

Looking up Z=1.3889 in the standard normal table. Let me use a more precise table or a calculator.

Using a Z-table calculator, Z=1.3889 corresponds to approximately 0.9175 area to the left. So, area to the right is 1 -0.9175=0.0825, which is 8.25%. So, about 8.25%.

Since the options are in whole numbers, perhaps the intended answer is 10%, option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach, such as using the empirical rule. The mean is 12, standard deviation 1.8. So, 14 inches is (14-12)/1.8 ≈1.11 SD above the mean. The empirical rule says that about 68% of data is within 1 SD, 95% within 2 SDs, and 99.7% within 3 SDs. So, for 1.11 SD, perhaps the area beyond that is about 13-14%, which aligns with our earlier calculation of ~13.38%. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the 68-95-99.7 rule, which would suggest that 14 inches is about 1.11 SD above the mean, so the percentage beyond that is roughly 16% (since 68% is within 1 SD, so 34% above the mean within 1 SD, and perhaps 16% beyond 1 SD). But that's a rough estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the exact value and round to the nearest option, which would be 13.38% to 13%, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is 2.5%, option B, but that seems too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the cutoff. Let me think again: the question is about poodles whose height is more than 14 inches. So, if the mean is 12 and SD is 1.8, then 14 is (14-12)/1.8 ≈1.11 SD above the mean. The area beyond that is ~13.38%, which is closest to 15%, option G.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the height is measured to the nearest inch, so the actual height can only be in increments of 1 inch. So, the probability distribution is discrete, and we can model it as such. So, we can calculate the probability for each possible integer height and sum them.

But that's more complicated. Let's try that.

The probability that a poodle's height is exactly k inches is the probability that X is in [k-0.5, k+0.5). So, for k=14, it's [13.5,14.5), for k=15, [14.5,15.5), etc.

So, the probability that the height is more than 14 inches is the sum from k=15 to infinity of P(k-0.5 <= X <k+0.5).

But that's tedious to compute manually. Alternatively, we can approximate it using the normal distribution.

So, P(X >=14.5) is approximately 8.25%, as calculated earlier.

But again, that's not an option. The closest option is F:10%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the Z-score of 1.11 and round 13.38% to the nearest option, which would be 13.38% to 13%, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is 2.5%, option B, but that seems too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try to compute the exact probability using the normal distribution function.

Using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the normal distribution, P(X <=14) is CDF(14;12,1.8) = CDF(1.1111) ≈0.8662, so P(X>14)=1-0.8662=0.1338 or 13.38%.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different method, such as using the 68-95-99.7 rule, which would suggest that about 16% are beyond 1 SD, but that's not precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the Z-score without considering the cutoff adjustment, leading to 13.38%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 2.5%, option B.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of poodles whose recorded height is 14 inches or more, which would be P(X >=13.5). As calculated earlier, that's about 20.14%, which is option E:20%.

Wait, but the question is about exceeding 14 inches, not 13.5. So, that can't be right.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize:

- The problem states that the mean is 12, SD is 1.8.
- We need P(X >14), where X is the actual height.
- Using Z=(14-12)/1.8=1.1111, P(X>14)=13.38%.
- Since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects us to adjust for measurement rounding, leading to P(X>14.5)=8.25%, closest to 10%, option F.
- Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is 2.5%, option B, but I don't see how that aligns with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Z-score calculation. Let me check again.

Z = (14 -12)/1.8 = 2/1.8 ≈1.1111.

Looking up Z=1.1111 in a standard normal table gives a cumulative probability of approximately 0.8662, so the area to the right is 0.1338, which is 13.38%.

Hmm, that's correct. So, perhaps the intended answer is 10%, option F, as the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the Z-score without considering the rounding, leading to 13.38%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 2.5%, option B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the integer values directly, without considering the continuous distribution. So, perhaps we can model the height as a discrete variable taking integer values, and compute the probability using the normal approximation with continuity correction.

So, for P(X >14), where X is discrete, we can model it as P(X >=14.5) in the continuous case.

So, Z=(14.5-12)/1.8 ≈1.3889, which gives P(X >=14.5)=8.25%, which is closest to 10%, option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use P(X >=14), which is 13.38%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 2.5%, option B.

I'm not sure. Given the options, the closest to 8.25% is F:10%, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the empirical rule, which states that about 68% of data is within 1 SD of the mean, 95% within 2 SDs, and 99.7% within 3 SDs.

So, 14 inches is (14-12)/1.8 ≈1.11 SD above the mean. Since 1 SD is about 68%, the area beyond 1 SD is about 16%, but since 1.11 is a bit more than 1 SD, perhaps the area is a bit less than 16%, say around 13-14%, which aligns with our earlier calculation of 13.38%.

But again, that's not an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is 2.5%, option B, but I can't see how that aligns.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Z-score calculation. Let me double-check with a calculator.

Using a Z-score of 1.1111, the cumulative probability is indeed approximately 0.8662, so the area to the right is 0.1338 or 13.38%.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach, such as considering the measurement to the nearest inch and calculating the probability accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of poodles whose recorded height is 14 inches or more, which would include those with actual heights from 13.5 inches and above. So, P(X >=13.5).

Calculating that:

Z = (13.5 -12)/1.8 =1.5/1.8≈0.8333.

Looking up Z=0.8333, the area to the left is approximately 0.7986, so P(X >=13.5)=1 -0.7986=0.2014 or 20.14%, which is option E:20%.

But the question is about exceeding 14 inches, not 13.5. So, that can't be right.

I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest to 13.38% is not present, but perhaps the intended answer is 2.5%, option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is about the percentage of poodles whose height is more than 14 inches when measured to the nearest inch, which would mean that their actual height is >=14.5 inches. So, P(X >=14.5)=8.25%, which is closest to 10%, option F.

I think that's the most reasonable approach, so the answer is F:10%.
</think>

To determine the percentage of miniature poodles with a height exceeding 14 inches, given a mean height of 12 inches and a standard deviation of 1.8 inches, we model the heights using a normal distribution. 

First, calculate the Z-score for 14 inches:

\[
Z = \frac{14 - 12}{1.8} \approx 1.1111
\]

Using the standard normal distribution table, the cumulative probability for \( Z = 1.11 \) is approximately 0.8662. Thus, the probability that a poodle's height exceeds 14 inches is:

\[
P(X > 14) = 1 - 0.8662 = 0.1338 \, \text{or} \, 13.38\%
\]

Since this value isn't listed among the options, we consider the possibility that the question refers to poodles whose recorded height is 15 inches or more, corresponding to actual heights of 14.5 inches and above. Adjusting the cutoff to 14.5 inches:

\[
Z = \frac{14.5 - 12}{1.8} \approx 1.3889
\]

The cumulative probability for \( Z = 1.3889 \) is approximately 0.9175, so the probability that a poodle's height exceeds 14.5 inches is:

\[
P(X > 14.5) = 1 - 0.9175 = 0.0825 \, \text{or} \, 8.25\%
\]

Given the options, the closest match to 8.25% is **10% (Option F)**.

**Answer: F**
