Alright, so I've got this question about Butler's view on acting virtuously. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember Joseph Butler was a 18th-century philosopher and theologian. He talked a lot about ethics and human nature. I think he was concerned with how people make moral decisions. From what I recall, he was critical of some of the other philosophers of his time, like Hobbes and Locke, but I'm not entirely sure.

The question is asking what Butler said about acting virtuously. The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different principle. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: all of our inward principles. That sounds like it might be too broad. I think Butler was more about prioritizing certain principles rather than following all of them without exception.

Option B: our highest inward principle. Hmm, this seems plausible. I've heard that Butler talked about a "principle of self-love" and a "principle of benevolence." Maybe he thought that acting virtuously involves aligning with the highest or most important principle.

Option C: the principles dictated by law. I don't think Butler focused much on laws. He was more about internal principles and conscience, so this might not be right.

Option D: the commands of God. While Butler was religious, I think he emphasized conscience and internal principles over divine commands as the direct source of morality. So maybe not D.

Option E: the principles of our elders. That seems too external and not about individual judgment, so probably not E.

Option F: the principles of society. Again, Butler was more about internal principles, so F doesn't seem right.

Option G: our weakest inward principle. That sounds counterintuitive. Why would you follow the weakest? Butler probably thought the opposite, so G is unlikely.

Option H: our strongest inward principle. This rings a bell. I think Butler discussed the idea that the strongest principle within us should guide our actions. So H might be the answer.

Option I: the principles of our peers. Similar to E and F, this seems external and not what Butler focused on.

Putting it together, Butler's view was that acting virtuously involves aligning with the highest or strongest inward principle. I'm more confident about H now because I remember him talking about the 'dominant' or 'strongest' principle guiding behavior. So the answer should be H.

The answer is H: our strongest inward principle.

The reasoning is that Joseph Butler emphasized the importance of aligning actions with the strongest inward principle, such as the principles of self-love and benevolence, rather than external dictates or weaker principles.

Answer: H
