Okay, so I've got this math problem here. The question is asking for the square root of 81 squared. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that squaring a number means multiplying it by itself. So 81 squared would be 81 times 81. Let me calculate that. 80 times 80 is 6400, and 81 times 81 is 6561. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 81 squared is actually 81*81. Let me compute that properly. 80*80 is 6400, 80*1 is 80, 1*80 is another 80, and 1*1 is 1. So adding them up: (80+80) is 160, plus 6400 is 6560, plus 1 is 6561. So 81 squared is 6561.

Now, the question is the square root of 81 squared. So that would be sqrt(81^2). I remember that the square root of a square of a number is the absolute value of that number, but since 81 is positive, it's just 81. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, sqrt(a^2) is |a|, so yes, since 81 is positive, the square root of 81 squared is 81.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one corresponds to 81. Let's check the options:

A: 9^2 is 81, but the question is about the square root of 81 squared, which is 81, so A is 81 but presented as 9^2. Wait, but the actual value is 81, so maybe I should look for 81 directly.

B: 27 – nope.

C:81^2 is 6561, which is 81 squared, not the square root.

D:729 – that's 27 squared, I think. 27*27 is 729.

E:6561 – that's 81 squared, same as C.

F:12 – irrelevant.

G:162 – not sure where that comes from.

H:243 – that's 3^5 or something else.

I:81 – yes, that's the number we arrived at.

J:9 – that's the square root of 81, but the question is about the square root of 81 squared, which is 81.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The square root of 81 squared. So sqrt(81^2) is 81. So the answer is I:81.

Alternatively, sometimes square roots can have positive and negative answers, but since we're talking about the principal square root, it's just 81. So yeah, I think I is the correct answer.

The square root of 81 squared is 81, as the square root of a square returns the absolute value of the original number, which is positive here.

Answer: I
