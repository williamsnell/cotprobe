Okay, so I need to find the remainder when 2^87 + 3 is divided by 7. Hmm, modular arithmetic, right? I remember something about remainders cycling in patterns when you raise numbers to powers. Let me think.

First, maybe I should break this down into two parts: 2^87 mod 7 and 3 mod 7. Then I can add those results and take mod 7 again to find the final remainder.

Starting with 2^87 mod 7. I think Fermat's Little Theorem might help here. Fermat's Little Theorem says that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. Since 7 is prime and 2 isn't divisible by 7, this should work.

So, 2^6 ≡ 1 mod 7 because 7-1 is 6. That means every exponent that's a multiple of 6 will give a remainder of 1 when divided by 7. So, 2^6k ≡ 1 mod 7.

Now, 87 divided by 6. Let me calculate 87 ÷ 6. 6*14=84, so 87 is 6*14 +3. So 87 = 6*14 +3. Therefore, 2^87 = 2^(6*14 +3) = (2^6)^14 * 2^3.

From earlier, 2^6 ≡1 mod7, so (2^6)^14 ≡1^14 ≡1 mod7. Then, 2^3 is 8. So 2^87 ≡1 * 8 mod7. Wait, 8 mod7 is 1, because 7*1=7, 8-7=1. So 2^87 ≡1 mod7.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Because 2^3 is 8, which mod7 is 1. So 2^87 is (2^6)^14 * 2^3. So that would be 1^14 * 1 =1 mod7. So yeah, 2^87 mod7 is 1.

Now, the second part is 3 mod7, which is just 3 because 3 is less than 7.

So adding them together: 1 +3 =4. Now, 4 mod7 is 4, so the total is 4. So the remainder should be 4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should check a smaller exponent to see the pattern.

Let me compute 2^1 mod7=2
2^2=4 mod7=4
2^3=8 mod7=1
2^4=2^3*2=1*2=2 mod7=2
2^5=2^4*2=2*2=4 mod7=4
2^6=2^5*2=4*2=8 mod7=1.

So the cycle repeats every 3 exponents? Wait, no, because 2^3 is 1, then 2^4 is 2, which is the same as 2^1. So the cycle is 3, so the pattern repeats every 3.

Wait, but earlier I used Fermat's Little Theorem which said the cycle is every 6, but here, it's repeating every 3. Hmm, maybe I confused the cycles. So perhaps the order of 2 modulo 7 is 3, which is a divisor of 6, which is correct.

So, for 2^87, since the cycle is every 3, 87 divided by 3 is 29 with no remainder. So 2^87 is (2^3)^29, which is 1^29=1 mod7. So that part checks out.

Then, adding 3: 1 +3=4. So 4 mod7 is 4. Therefore, the remainder is 4.

Wait, looking at the options, I see option I is 4. So I think the answer is I.

The remainder when \(2^{87} + 3\) is divided by 7 is 4.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Find the remainder of \(2^{87}\) modulo 7.
   - Find the remainder of 3 modulo 7.
   - Add the two results and take modulo 7 again.

2. **Compute \(2^{87} \mod 7\):**
   - Use Fermat's Little Theorem: \(2^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).
   - Express 87 as \(6 \times 14 + 3\).
   - Thus, \(2^{87} = (2^6)^{14} \times 2^3\).
   - Since \(2^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\), this simplifies to \(1^{14} \times 8 \mod 7\).
   - \(8 \mod 7 = 1\), so \(2^{87} \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

3. **Compute \(3 \mod 7\):**
   - \(3 \mod 7 = 3\).

4. **Add the Results:**
   - \(1 + 3 = 4\).
   - \(4 \mod 7 = 4\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The remainder is 4.
