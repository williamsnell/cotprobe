Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the European Economic Community is. I remember hearing a bit about it in history class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking about the European Economic Community, and it's giving me multiple options labeled A to J. I need to pick the correct one. I'll go through each option one by one to see which one fits.

Option A says it's a political union of European nations. I recall that the European Union (EU) is a political and economic union, but the European Economic Community (EEC) might be part of that. So maybe this is too broad, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B is a social welfare collaboration between Eastern and Western European countries. Social welfare sounds more like the welfare aspect, like the European Union's policies on social security or healthcare. The EEC might focus more on the economic side, so this might not be it.

Option C is a military alliance. That makes me think of NATO, which is a military alliance in Europe and beyond. The EEC doesn't seem to be about military stuff, so I can probably rule this out.

Option D is a cultural organization. Things like the Council of Europe or UNESCO might fall under cultural organizations. The EEC sounds more economic than cultural, so D doesn't seem right.

Option E is a trade agreement between Europe and Asia. That sounds more like something like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) or maybe other free trade agreements, but I think the EEC is strictly within Europe, not involving Asia. So E might not be correct.

Option F is a consortium focused solely on environmental regulations. I know that the EU has environmental policies, but again, the EEC is broader than just environment. So F is probably not the answer.

Option G: a group of Western European nations which have agreed to strive for economic integration. This sounds closer. I remember that the EEC was one of the predecessors to the EU, focusing on economic integration among Western European countries. So G seems plausible.

Option H is a central bank for all European nations. That sounds more like the European Central Bank (ECB), which is part of the EU's structure but not the EEC itself. So H isn't it.

Option I is about coordinating transportation infrastructure. That could be part of the EU's policies, but again, not specifically the EEC. So I don't think so.

Option J is about fixed exchange rates. That makes me think of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which was part of the EU's policies leading up to the euro. So J isn't the EEC itself.

Putting it all together, the EEC was established in 1957 as the European Economic Community, part of the Treaty of Rome. It aimed to create a common market and eventually achieve economic integration among its member states, primarily Western European countries. Over time, it evolved into the European Union. So the correct answer should be G.

The European Economic Community (EEC) was established in 1957 through the Treaty of Rome. It focused on creating a common market and economic integration among Western European nations, which later evolved into the European Union. Among the options provided, G accurately describes the EEC as a group of Western European nations striving for economic integration.

Answer: G
