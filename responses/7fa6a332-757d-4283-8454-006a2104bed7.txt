Alright, so I've got this problem here about a wholesaler who's going out of business and selling some merchandise. The question is asking for the original cost of the merchandise based on the selling price and the loss percentage. Hmm, okay, let's think through this step by step.

First, the problem says he sold the merchandise for $1,288 at a loss of 8 percent of his original cost. So, the selling price is $1,288, and the loss is 8% of the original cost. I need to find the original cost.

Wait, I should remember how cost, selling price, and loss relate. So, if he sold at a loss, that means the selling price is less than his cost. The loss is calculated on the original cost. So, the formula for loss is: Loss = (Loss Percentage) * (Original Cost). 

Wait, more accurately, Loss = (Loss Percentage / 100) * Original Cost. So, the selling price would be Original Cost minus the loss. So, Selling Price = Original Cost - (8% of Original Cost).

Let me write this down. Let’s denote the original cost as C. Then, the loss is 0.08 * C. So, the selling price is C - 0.08C, which simplifies to 0.92C. Oh, right, because 100% - 8% = 92%, so the selling price is 92% of the original cost.

So, we have Selling Price = 0.92 * C. We know the Selling Price is $1,288, so plugging that in:

1,288 = 0.92 * C

To find C, I need to divide both sides by 0.92. So,

C = 1,288 / 0.92

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1,288 divided by 0.92. Let's see. 1,288 divided by 0.92. Well, 0.92 times 1,400 is 1,288 because 1,400 * 0.92 is 1,288. Let me check: 1,400 * 0.92. 1,400 * 0.9 is 1,260, and 1,400 * 0.02 is 28, so 1,260 +28= 1,288. Yes, that's correct.

So, the original cost is $1,400. Looking at the options, option C is $1,400.00. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug the numbers back into the problem.

Original cost is $1,400. A loss of 8% would be 0.08 * 1,400 = $112. So, the selling price should be 1,400 - 112 = $1,288. And that's exactly what the problem states. So yes, the original cost is $1,400, which is option C.

To determine the original cost, we use the relationship between selling price, loss percentage, and original cost. The selling price is the original cost minus 8% of it. Rearranging the formula:

Selling Price = Original Cost × (1 - Loss Percentage)
$1,288 = C × 0.92

Solving for C:
C = $1,288 / 0.92 = $1,400.

Answer: C: $1,400.00
