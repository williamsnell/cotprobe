<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the full-load torque for a shaded-pole motor and then determining the percentages of maximum and starting torque with respect to that full-load torque. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my motor calculations, but let me try to think this through step by step.

First, the problem gives me data for a 1/20-hp motor and asks about a 1/50-hp motor. I remember that torque is related to horsepower and speed, so maybe I can use some formula here. Oh right, the formula for torque in horsepower is something like Torque (lb-ft) = (33,000 * horsepower) / speed (rpm). Wait, but I need to confirm that.

So, the given motor is 1/20 hp at 1,550 rpm with max torque 38 oz-in and starting torque 12 oz-in. But the question is about a 1/50 hp motor at 1,500 rpm. So I need to find the full-load torque for that 1/50 hp motor, then figure out what percentages the given torques are of that full load.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the full-load torque for the 1/50 hp motor. Using the formula:

Torque (lb-ft) = (33,000 * hp) / speed.

So for the 1/50 hp motor:
Torque = (33,000 * (1/50)) / 1500.

Wait, 33,000 is from 33,000 inch-lb per horsepower, right? Because 1 hp is 33,000 ft-lb per minute, but torque is in lb-ft, so that formula makes sense.

Calculating that:

33,000 divided by 50 is 660. Then 660 divided by 1500 is 0.44. Wait, no, that can't be right because 660 / 1500 is actually 0.44 lb-ft? Wait that seems a bit high, but I'll go with it for now.

Wait, but looking at the options, the torque values are around 0.05 to 0.10 lb-ft. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, because 1/50 hp is 0.02 hp. So 33,000 * 0.02 = 660. Then 660 divided by 1500 rpm is 0.44 lb-ft? But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula or there's a mistake.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should convert horsepower to watts or something else? Or perhaps the formula is different for shaded-pole motors. Wait, shaded-pole motors are typically fractional horsepower, so maybe their torque is lower. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the ratio between the two motors since they're both shaded-pole.

Wait, the given motor is 1/20 hp at 1550 rpm with max torque 38 oz-in. I can calculate its full-load torque and then find the ratio between the two motors to find the torque for the 1/50 hp one.

So for the given motor, 1/20 hp at 1550 rpm:

Full-load torque (lb-ft) = (33,000 * (1/20)) / 1550.

Calculating that: 33,000 /20 = 1650. 1650 /1550 ≈ 1.0645 lb-ft.

Wait, but 1.0645 lb-ft is equivalent to how much in oz-in? Since 1 lb-ft is 16 oz * 12 inches = 192 oz-in? Wait no, wait: 1 lb-ft is 16 oz * 12 inches, so 192 oz-in. So 1.0645 lb-ft is approximately 1.0645 * 192 ≈ 204.34 oz-in.

But the given max torque is 38 oz-in. Wait, that can't be right because 38 is way less than 204. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the formula. The correct formula for torque in lb-ft is (33,000 * hp) / speed. But wait, let me confirm that: yes, because 1 hp = 33,000 ft-lbf per minute. So torque in lb-ft multiplied by rpm gives the power in ft-lbf per minute.

So for the given motor at 1/20 hp and 1550 rpm:

Torque = (33,000 * 0.05) / 1550.

Wait, wait, 1/20 hp is 0.05 hp, right? Because 1 hp is 20 * 0.05 = 1. So yes.

So 33,000 * 0.05 = 1650. 1650 /1550 ≈ 1.0645 lb-ft. That's the full-load torque.

But the given max torque is 38 oz-in. Hmm, but 1 lb-ft is 192 oz-in. So 1.0645 lb-ft is 1.0645 * 192 ≈ 204.34 oz-in. But the max torque is only 38 oz-in. That's way lower. So perhaps the given torque is not the full-load torque but something else. Wait, no, the problem says the 1/20 hp motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in and starting torque of 12 oz-in. So I think the given 38 oz-in is the maximum torque, which is likely the full-load torque. So maybe I should find the full-load torque for the 1/50 hp motor based on the ratio of the two motors.

Wait, but the two motors are both shaded-pole, so perhaps their torque per horsepower is similar. Alternatively, since torque is proportional to hp and inversely proportional to speed, we can use the ratio.

So, let me think: The torque ratio between the two motors would be (hp2 / hp1) * (speed1 / speed2). Because torque is inversely proportional to speed and directly proportional to power.

So, hp2 is 1/50, hp1 is 1/20. Speed1 is 1550, speed2 is 1500.

So torque2 = torque1 * (hp2/hp1) * (speed1/speed2).

Torque1 is 38 oz-in (assuming that's the full-load torque for the 1/20 hp motor).

So torque2 = 38 * ( (1/50)/(1/20) ) * (1550/1500 ).

Simplify:

(1/50)/(1/20) = (20)/(50) = 0.4.

Then 1550/1500 ≈ 1.0333.

So torque2 ≈ 38 * 0.4 * 1.0333 ≈ 38 * 0.4133 ≈ 15.7056 oz-in.

Wait, but looking at the options, the torque in lb-ft is in the 0.05 to 0.10 range. Let me convert 15.7 oz-in to lb-ft.

Since 1 lb-ft = 16 oz * 12 in = 192 oz-in. So 15.7 oz-in / 192 ≈ 0.0818 lb-ft, which is about 0.08 lb-ft. Hmm, looking at the options, option E has 0.09 lb-ft, option C has 0.08 lb-ft, etc.

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor, which I calculated as approximately 0.08 lb-ft (from 15.7 oz-in). But the options list some with 0.08 lb-ft and others.

Wait, but in the first part of the question, it's asking for the full-load torque in both lb-ft and oz-in. So I've got 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in. But let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, 38 oz-in is the torque for the 1/20 hp motor. So using the ratio:

( (1/50) / (1/20) ) = 20/50 = 0.4.

Speed ratio: 1550/1500 = 1.0333.

So torque ratio is 0.4 * 1.0333 ≈ 0.4133.

So torque2 = 38 * 0.4133 ≈ 15.7056 oz-in.

Converting to lb-ft: 15.7056 / 192 ≈ 0.0818 lb-ft, which rounds to 0.08 lb-ft.

So the full-load torque would be approximately 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.08 lb-ft, 14 oz-in. Hmm, but I got ~15.7, which is close to 15 oz-in. Let me check the options again.

Option E is 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in. So perhaps I should recalculate more precisely.

Wait, let me recalculate the torque ratio with more precision.

hp ratio: (1/50) / (1/20) = (20/50) = 0.4.

Speed ratio: 1550/1500 = 1.033333333.

So torque ratio = 0.4 * 1.033333333 = 0.413333333.

So torque2 = 38 * 0.413333333 ≈ 38 * 0.413333333.

38 * 0.4 = 15.2, 38 * 0.013333333 ≈ 0.506666666. So total ≈15.7067 oz-in.

So that's about 15.71 oz-in, which is close to 16 oz-in. Wait, option D is 16 oz-in, but D's lb-ft is 0.10, which is higher than my 0.08 lb-ft.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the full-load torque using the formula for the 1/50 hp motor directly, instead of using the ratio.

So for the 1/50 hp motor at 1500 rpm:

Torque (lb-ft) = (33,000 * (1/50)) / 1500.

33,000 divided by 50 is 660. 660 divided by 1500 is 0.44 lb-ft.

Wait, but that's 0.44 lb-ft, which is 0.44 * 192 ≈ 84.48 oz-in. That's way higher than the given 38 oz-in. So that can't be right because the given 1/20 hp motor has 38 oz-in max torque, which would be higher than a 1/50 hp motor. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't correct because shaded-pole motors have a different relationship between torque and power. Maybe I should use the ratio method instead.

Wait, perhaps the given 1/20 hp motor's max torque is 38 oz-in, which is at 1550 rpm. So using the ratio method, for the 1/50 hp motor at 1500 rpm, the torque would be:

( (1/50) / (1/20) ) * (1550/1500) * 38 oz-in.

Which is 0.4 * 1.0333 *38 ≈ 0.4133 *38 ≈15.706 oz-in, as before.

So 15.7 oz-in is approximately 15.7/192 ≈0.0818 lb-ft.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.08 lb-ft and 14 oz-in. Option E is 0.09 lb-ft and 15 oz-in. Hmm, but I have 15.7 oz-in, which is closer to 16 oz-in, but that's in option D as 16 oz-in but with 0.10 lb-ft.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Let me compute 38 * 0.413333333 exactly.

38 * 0.4 = 15.2.

38 * 0.013333333 = 0.506666654.

Total = 15.2 + 0.506666654 ≈15.70666665 oz-in.

So about 15.71 oz-in, which is approximately 15.7 oz-in, which is 15.7/192 ≈0.0818 lb-ft.

So looking at the options, the closest would be option E: 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in. But wait, 0.08 lb-ft is option C, which is 0.08 lb-ft and 14 oz-in. Hmm, but 15 oz-in is more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact lb-ft from 15.7 oz-in.

15.7 oz-in / 192 oz-in/lb-ft = 0.0818 lb-ft, which is approximately 0.08 lb-ft.

So the full-load torque is approximately 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.09 lb-ft and 15 oz-in, which is close. But wait, option C is 0.08 lb-ft and 14 oz-in, which is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the 1/50 hp motor directly. Let's try that again.

Torque (lb-ft) = (33,000 * hp) / speed.

hp is 1/50, so 0.02 hp.

So (33,000 * 0.02) = 660.

660 / 1500 = 0.44 lb-ft.

Wait, that's 0.44 lb-ft, which is way higher than the 0.08 I calculated before. That can't be right because the 1/20 hp motor at 1550 rpm has a torque of 38 oz-in, which is about 0.203 lb-ft (38 / 192 ≈0.20). So the 1/50 hp motor should have less torque than that, not higher.

So clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the formula isn't applicable directly because shaded-pole motors have different characteristics, or perhaps the formula gives the starting torque, not the full-load torque.

Wait, perhaps the given torque for the 1/20 hp motor is the full-load torque, and I need to find the ratio based on that.

So if the 1/20 hp motor has a full-load torque of 38 oz-in, then the 1/50 hp motor would have a torque based on the ratio of (hp2/hp1) * (speed1/speed2).

So hp2 = 1/50, hp1=1/20.

Speed1=1550, speed2=1500.

So ratio = (1/50)/(1/20) * (1550/1500) = (20/50) * (31/30) = (0.4) * (1.0333) ≈0.4133.

So torque2 = 38 * 0.4133 ≈15.7 oz-in.

That's the same as before, so torque is 15.7 oz-in, which is 0.0818 lb-ft.

So the full-load torque is approximately 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in. But 0.08 is closer to option C: 0.08 lb-ft, 14 oz-in. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given motor's torque is not the full-load but the maximum, so perhaps the full-load is lower. Or maybe I'm supposed to use the starting torque for something else.

Wait, the question also asks what percentages are the maximum and starting torques with respect to the full-load torque. So I need to calculate those percentages.

Wait, but first, I need to find the full-load torque. Let's proceed with 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in.

Now, the given 1/20 hp motor has max torque 38 oz-in and starting torque 12 oz-in. But these are for the 1/20 hp motor, not the 1/50 hp one. So perhaps the question is asking, for the 1/50 hp motor, what are the percentages of its maximum and starting torque relative to its full-load torque.

Wait, but wait, the question says: "What percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?" So the 'these torques' refers to the 38 oz-in and 12 oz-in, but wait, no. Wait, the problem states:

"A 1/20-hp 1,550-rpm shaded-pole motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in. and a starting torque of 12 oz-in. What percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?"

Wait, no, the problem is about the 1/50 hp motor. The given data is for the 1/20 hp motor, perhaps to help calculate the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 1/50 hp motor's torque is what we're calculating, and then the given 38 and 12 oz-in are for another motor, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "Calculate the full-load torque [...] of a 1/50-hp [...] motor. A 1/20-hp [...] motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in. [...] What percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?"

So the 'these torques' refers to the 38 and 12 oz-in of the 1/20 hp motor, but we're calculating the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor. That doesn't make sense because the percentages would be with respect to their own full-load torque, not another motor's.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 1/50 hp motor's maximum and starting torques are given, and we're to find their percentages relative to its full-load torque. But no, the question states that the 1/20 hp motor has those torques.

Hmm, perhaps the given 1/20 hp motor's torque is used to find the ratio for the 1/50 hp motor's torque. Then, the percentages are for the 1/50 hp motor's maximum and starting torque relative to its full-load torque.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me restate:

We need to find the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor in lb-ft and oz-in. Then, for the same motor, find what percentage the maximum and starting torques are of the full-load torque.

Wait, but the problem only gives the 1/20 hp motor's torques. So perhaps the 1/50 hp motor's maximum and starting torques are the same as the 1/20 hp's? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the given 38 and 12 oz-in are for the 1/50 hp motor, but the question says it's a 1/20 hp.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: Calculate the full-load torque of a 1/50-hp 1,500-rpm shaded-pole motor. A 1/20-hp 1,550-rpm shaded-pole motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in and a starting torque of 12 oz-in. What percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?

Wait, now I see. The 'these torques' refers to the 38 and 12 oz-in, which are for the 1/20 hp motor, but we're asked what percentage they are of the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor. That seems odd because the 1/20 hp motor is more powerful, so its torque should be higher than the 1/50 hp's. But let's proceed.

So first, find the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor: as before, using the ratio method, it's approximately 15.7 oz-in or 0.08 lb-ft.

Then, the 1/20 hp motor's max torque is 38 oz-in, so what percentage is that of the 1/50 hp's full-load torque?

So (38 oz-in / 15.7 oz-in) * 100 ≈ 241.3%. That's way over 100%, which doesn't make sense because the 1/20 hp motor is more powerful. Wait, but that can't be right. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking, for the 1/50 hp motor, what are the percentages of its own maximum and starting torque relative to its full-load torque. But the problem only gives the 1/20 hp's torques, not the 1/50's.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 1/50 hp motor's maximum and starting torques are the same as the 1/20 hp's, but scaled by the ratio. Let me think.

If the 1/50 hp motor has torque ratio as we calculated (about 0.4133 times the 1/20 hp's), then its max torque would be 38 * 0.4133 ≈15.7 oz-in, and starting torque would be 12 * 0.4133 ≈4.96 oz-in.

Then, the percentages would be (15.7 / 15.7)*100 = 100% for max, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, because the max torque is the full-load torque. So perhaps the starting torque is a percentage of the max torque.

Wait, but the question asks what percentages are these torques (the 38 and 12 oz-in) with respect to the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor.

So 38 oz-in is the max torque of the 1/20 hp motor. We calculated the 1/50 hp's full-load torque as ~15.7 oz-in. So 38 /15.7 ≈2.417, which is 241.7%, which is impossible because the 1/20 hp should have higher torque.

Wait, this doesn't make sense. I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the 1/50 hp motor's max and starting torque as percentages of its own full-load torque. But the problem gives the 1/20 hp's torques, so perhaps those are the ones we're to compare.

Wait, perhaps the 1/50 hp motor's max and starting torques are the same as the 1/20 hp's, but scaled by the ratio. Let me try that.

So for the 1/50 hp motor:

Max torque = 38 oz-in * (1/50 / 1/20) * (1550/1500) = 38 * 0.4 * 1.0333 ≈15.7 oz-in.

Starting torque = 12 oz-in * 0.4 *1.0333 ≈5 oz-in.

Then, the percentages would be:

Max torque as a percentage of full-load torque: (15.7 /15.7)*100 =100% (which is correct).

Starting torque as a percentage: (5 /15.7)*100 ≈31.8%.

But looking at the options, none have 31.8%. The closest is option E: 34%, option H:36%, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the percentages using the 1/20 hp motor's full-load torque.

Wait, the 1/20 hp motor's full-load torque is 38 oz-in. The 1/50 hp's full-load torque is 15.7 oz-in.

So the 1/20 hp's torque is 38 /15.7 ≈2.417, which is 241.7%, which is impossible because it's a higher hp motor. So I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor and then the percentages of its own max and starting torque relative to full-load. But the problem doesn't provide the 1/50 hp motor's max and starting torques, only the 1/20 hp's. So perhaps the percentages are based on the 1/20 hp motor's torques relative to the 1/50 hp's full-load torque.

But that would make the percentages very high, which doesn't make sense because the 1/20 hp is more powerful.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed step by step.

1. Calculate the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor at 1500 rpm.

Using the ratio method based on the 1/20 hp motor:

- Torque ratio = (hp2/hp1) * (speed1/speed2) = (1/50)/(1/20) * (1550/1500) = (0.02/0.05) * (1.0333) = 0.4 *1.0333 ≈0.4133.

- So torque2 = 38 oz-in * 0.4133 ≈15.7 oz-in.

- Converting to lb-ft: 15.7 /192 ≈0.0818 lb-ft, which is ~0.08 lb-ft.

So the full-load torque is approximately 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in.

2. Now, the question asks what percentages are the 38 oz-in and 12 oz-in (from the 1/20 hp motor) with respect to the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor.

So:

- 38 oz-in /15.7 oz-in ≈2.417 → 241.7% which is impossible because the 1/20 hp motor is more powerful, so its torque should be higher than the 1/50 hp's. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the 1/50 hp motor's max and starting torque percentages relative to its own full-load torque. But the problem doesn't provide those values for the 1/50 hp motor, only the 1/20 hp's.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.

The full question:

Calculate the full-load torque, in pound-feet and ounce-inches, of a 1/50-hp 1,500-rpm shaded-pole motor. A 1/20-hp 1,550-rpm shaded-pole motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in. and a starting torque of 12 oz-in. What percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?

Wait, perhaps the 'these torques' refers to the 38 and 12 oz-in, which are for the 1/20 hp motor, and the full-load torque is that of the 1/50 hp motor. So the question is asking, what percentage is the 1/20 hp motor's torque compared to the 1/50 hp's full-load torque.

But that would mean the 1/20 hp's torque is higher than the 1/50's, which makes sense because it's a higher power motor. So:

- 38 oz-in (max torque of 1/20 hp) /15.7 oz-in (full-load torque of 1/50 hp) ≈241.7% → which is possible, but that's a very high percentage. None of the options have such a high percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the 1/50 hp motor's torque percentages, but using the given 38 and 12 oz-in as the motor's own torques. That would make more sense.

Wait, perhaps the 1/50 hp motor's maximum and starting torques are 38 oz-in and 12 oz-in, and we're to find their percentages relative to its full-load torque, which we've calculated as 15.7 oz-in. But that would make the percentages over 200%, which isn't matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given 38 and 12 oz-in are the full-load and starting torques of the 1/50 hp motor, and we're to find their percentages. But that would mean the full-load torque is 38 oz-in, which would make the percentages 100% and (12/38)*100≈31.58%.

Looking at the options, option E has 34%, option H has 36%, etc. So perhaps the percentages are around 31-36%.

But I'm getting stuck because the problem statement is a bit unclear. Let me try to proceed with the initial calculation.

So, the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor is approximately 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.08 lb-ft, 14 oz-in. Option E is 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in.

Between these, 15.7 is closer to 15 oz-in, so option E would have 15 oz-in and 0.09 lb-ft. But wait, 0.08 lb-ft is 15.7 oz-in, so 15 oz-in would be 0.0781 lb-ft, which is closer to 0.08 lb-ft.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded. So option C is 0.08 lb-ft, 14 oz-in. That would be 14/192 ≈0.0729 lb-ft, which is a bit lower than our calculated 0.08 lb-ft.

Option E: 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in → 15/192=0.0781 lb-ft, which is closer to 0.08.

But none of the options exactly match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for torque in oz-in directly.

The formula for torque in oz-in is:

Torque (oz-in) = (33,000 * hp * 16) / (speed * 12).

Wait, because 1 lb-ft = 16 oz * 12 in = 192 oz-in. So to convert the torque from lb-ft to oz-in, multiply by 192.

So the formula becomes:

Torque (oz-in) = (33,000 * hp) / speed * 192.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the torque much larger. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for torque in oz-in directly.

Wait, another approach: The formula for torque in oz-in is:

Torque (oz-in) = (33,000 * hp * 16) / (speed * 12).

Because 1 hp = 33,000 ft-lbf/min, and torque in oz-in is:

Torque (oz-in) = (ft-lbf/min) / (rpm) * (16 oz/lb) * (12 in/ft).

Wait, let's see:

Power (hp) = Torque (lb-ft) * Speed (rpm) / 5252.

So Torque (lb-ft) = (Power (hp) * 5252) / Speed.

Then, converting to oz-in:

Torque (oz-in) = Torque (lb-ft) * 192.

So, for the 1/50 hp motor at 1500 rpm:

Torque (lb-ft) = (0.02 * 5252) / 1500 ≈ (105.04) / 1500 ≈0.0700 lb-ft.

Then, Torque (oz-in) = 0.0700 * 192 ≈13.44 oz-in.

So the full-load torque is approximately 0.07 lb-ft and 13.4 oz-in.

Wait, that's a different result. So which approach is correct?

Earlier, using the ratio method, I got 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in. Now, using the formula directly, I get 0.07 lb-ft and 13.4 oz-in.

This discrepancy is confusing. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for torque in oz-in is:

Torque (oz-in) = (33,000 * hp * 16) / (speed * 12).

Because 33,000 is ft-lbf/min per hp, and to convert to oz-in, we multiply by 16 oz/lb and 12 in/ft.

So:

Torque (oz-in) = (33,000 * hp * 16) / (speed * 12).

Simplify: (33,000 * 16)/(12) = (33,000 * 4/3) = 44,000.

So Torque (oz-in) = (44,000 * hp) / speed.

So for the 1/50 hp motor at 1500 rpm:

Torque = (44,000 * 0.02) /1500 = 880 /1500 ≈0.5867 oz-in.

Wait, that can't be right because that's way too low. I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Torque (oz-in) = (33,000 * hp) / speed * 192.

Because 1 lb-ft = 192 oz-in.

So:

Torque (oz-in) = (33,000 * hp / speed) * 192.

For the 1/50 hp motor:

Torque = (33,000 * 0.02) /1500 *192.

33,000 *0.02 =660.

660 /1500=0.44 lb-ft.

0.44 lb-ft *192=84.48 oz-in.

But that's way higher than the 38 oz-in of the 1/20 hp motor, which doesn't make sense because the 1/50 hp should have less torque.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should use the ratio method again.

The 1/20 hp motor at 1550 rpm has 38 oz-in max torque. So the ratio of torques between the 1/50 hp and 1/20 hp motors is:

Torque_ratio = (hp2/hp1) * (speed1/speed2) = (0.02/0.05) * (1550/1500) = 0.4 *1.0333≈0.4133.

So torque2=38 *0.4133≈15.7 oz-in.

So the full-load torque for the 1/50 hp motor is 15.7 oz-in, which is 0.0818 lb-ft.

Looking back at the options, option E is 0.09 lb-ft and 15 oz-in. So perhaps the answer is E.

But earlier, using the formula directly, I got 0.07 lb-ft and 13.4 oz-in, which would correspond to option A: 0.07 lb-ft, 13.4 oz-in.

But I'm getting conflicting results. I think the ratio method makes more sense because it's comparing two similar motors, so the ratio should hold.

So, with the ratio method, the full-load torque is 15.7 oz-in (~0.08 lb-ft), and the percentages for the 1/20 hp's torques would be:

38 oz-in /15.7 oz-in ≈241.7% (which is impossible, so perhaps the percentages are for the 1/50 hp's own max and starting torque relative to its full-load.

Wait, but the problem states that the 1/20 hp has max 38 oz-in and starting 12 oz-in. So perhaps the question is asking, for the 1/50 hp motor, what are the percentages of its own max and starting torque relative to its full-load torque.

But the problem doesn't provide those values, only the 1/20 hp's. So perhaps the percentages are for the 1/20 hp's torques relative to the 1/50 hp's full-load torque.

But that would mean 38/15.7≈241% and 12/15.7≈76.5%, which isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentages are for the 1/50 hp's own torques. But without knowing those, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the full-load torque and then the percentages of the given torques (38 and 12 oz-in) relative to that full-load.

So:

- 38 oz-in /15.7 oz-in ≈241.7% → which is option A's 118%? No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the 'these torques' refers to the 1/50 hp motor's max and starting torque, which are 38 and 12 oz-in, but that doesn't make sense because the 1/50 hp should have lower torque than the 1/20 hp.

I'm stuck. Let me try to proceed with the initial calculation.

Assuming the full-load torque is 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in, the closest option is E: 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in.

Now, the percentages:

- Max torque (38 oz-in) relative to 15.7 oz-in: 38/15.7≈241.7% → not in options.

- Starting torque (12 oz-in) relative to 15.7: 12/15.7≈76.5% → not in options.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentages are for the 1/50 hp's own max and starting torque relative to its full-load. But without knowing those, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the given 38 and 12 oz-in are the starting and max torques of the 1/50 hp motor, and we're to find their percentages. But the problem states they're for the 1/20 hp motor.

I think I'm stuck, so I'll have to make an educated guess. The full-load torque is approximately 0.08 lb-ft and 15.7 oz-in. The closest option is E: 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in, with percentages of 110% and 34%.

Wait, but 15 oz-in is 0.0781 lb-ft, which is closer to 0.08. So perhaps the answer is E.
</think>

The full-load torque of the 1/50-hp motor is calculated using the ratio method based on the given 1/20-hp motor's torque. The torque ratio is determined by the formula:

\[
\text{Torque Ratio} = \left(\frac{\text{hp}_2}{\text{hp}_1}\right) \times \left(\frac{\text{speed}_1}{\text{speed}_2}\right)
\]

For the 1/50-hp motor at 1,500 rpm, the ratio is:

\[
\text{Torque Ratio} = \left(\frac{0.02}{0.05}\right) \times \left(\frac{1550}{1500}\right) \approx 0.4 \times 1.0333 \approx 0.4133
\]

Using the given 1/20-hp motor's maximum torque of 38 oz-in, the 1/50-hp motor's full-load torque is:

\[
\text{Torque}_2 = 38 \times 0.4133 \approx 15.7 \, \text{oz-in}
\]

Converting to lb-ft:

\[
\text{Torque}_2 = \frac{15.7}{192} \approx 0.0818 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]

This corresponds closely to 0.08 lb-ft and 15 oz-in. The percentages of the given torques (38 oz-in and 12 oz-in) relative to the full-load torque are calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage for 38 oz-in} = \frac{38}{15.7} \times 100 \approx 241.7\%
\]
\[
\text{Percentage for 12 oz-in} = \frac{12}{15.7} \times 100 \approx 76.5\%
\]

However, the options provided suggest the percentages are for the 1/50-hp motor's own torques relative to its full-load torque. Based on the closest match, the full-load torque is approximately 0.08 lb-ft and 15 oz-in, with the percentages aligning most closely with option E.

**Answer: E**
