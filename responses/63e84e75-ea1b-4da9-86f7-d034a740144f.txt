Question:

Explain briefly the background and applications of BASIC computer language.

Options:

A: BASIC was developed by Microsoft to enhance the Windows operating system.
B: BASIC was created by IBM as a language to program mainframe computers and has limited use today due to its complexity.
C: BASIC stands for "Business Acquisition and System Integration Code" and is used mainly in the corporate finance sector.
D: BASIC is an advanced programming language used mainly for developing complex scientific simulations and models.
E: BASIC is an acronym for "Binary Algorithmic Scientific Instruction Code" and is used primarily in data analysis.
F: BASIC was developed in the 1950s as a language for artificial intelligence research.
G: BASIC is a language developed at Dartmouth College in the 1960s to make the computer more accessible and easy to use. It is widely used in science, business, and engineering due to its simplicity and similarity to English and algebra.
H: BASIC was developed in the 1980s to simplify computer programming.
I: BASIC is a language developed in the late 1970s for the exclusive use in graphical user interface design.
J: BASIC is a language primarily used in the field of arts and literature.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. The question is about the background and applications of the BASIC computer language, and I need to pick the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that BASIC stands for Beginners' All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. It was created to make programming more accessible, especially for non-experts. I think it was developed a while ago, maybe in the 60s or 70s. I'm pretty sure it wasn't Microsoft who created it because I recall something about it being developed at a university.

Wait, Dartmouth College rings a bell. Yes, BASIC was indeed developed at Dartmouth College in the 1960s. The creators were John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz. They wanted to make programming easier so that students without a technical background could use computers. That makes sense because it's designed to be simple and similar to English and algebra, which aligns with the idea of being accessible.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says BASIC was developed by Microsoft to enhance Windows. No, that's not right because Microsoft popularized BASIC for their platforms, but they didn't create it. Option B mentions IBM and mainframes, but that's incorrect too because IBM isn't associated with the creation of BASIC, and it's not used much today due to complexityâ€”actually, BASIC is known for being simple, so B doesn't fit.

Option C says it's about business acquisition and system integration in corporate finance. That doesn't sound right. I don't recall BASIC being specific to finance. Option D talks about complex scientific simulations, which might be more in line with FORTRAN or other specialized languages. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E's acronym doesn't match. Binary Algorithmic Scientific Instruction Code doesn't fit, and I think BASIC is more general-purpose than data analysis. Option F places BASIC in the 1950s for AI research. I don't think so; BASIC came later, and AI research was using other languages like Lisp then.

Option G says BASIC was developed at Dartmouth in the 1960s for accessibility and is used in science, business, and engineering. That sounds exactly right. It's simple and widely applicable, so G seems correct.

Option H mentions the 1980s, which is too late. BASIC was already around before that. Option I says late 70s for GUI design, which I don't think is accurate. GUIs became more prominent later, and BASIC was more about general programming. Option J is about arts and literature, which doesn't fit at all.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G. BASIC was developed at Dartmouth College in the 1960s to make programming more accessible, especially for beginners. It is widely used in various fields like science, business, and engineering due to its simplicity and similarity to English and algebra.

Answer: G
