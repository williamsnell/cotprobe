Okay, I need to solve this shaft design problem. Let's see. The question is about determining the diameter of both a solid and a hollow shaft that can transmit 30 hp at 400 rpm. The ultimate shear stress is given as 60,000 psi with a factor of safety of 5. The options are A to J, each providing both solid and hollow shaft dimensions.

First, I remember that the power transmitted by a shaft is related to the torque it can handle. The formula for power in horsepower is P = (T * ω) / 5252, where T is torque in lb-ft and ω is angular velocity in rad/s. But wait, maybe I should start by converting the given power into torque.

Wait, another thought: the formula for power in horsepower is P = (Torque * Speed) / 5252. So I can rearrange that to find torque T. Let me write that down.

Given P = 30 hp, speed N = 400 rpm.

So T = (P * 5252) / N. Plugging in the numbers: T = (30 * 5252) / 400. Let me calculate that.

30 * 5252 = 157,560. Divided by 400: 157560 / 400 = 393.9 lb-ft. So the torque is 393.9 lb-ft.

Wait, no, wait. That can't be right. Wait, 30 * 5252 is 157,560. Divide by 400, that's 393.9 lb-ft? That seems high. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, 5252 is the conversion factor for hp to torque in lb-ft. So yes, that seems correct. So T ≈ 393.9 lb-ft.

Next, I'll need to find the shear stress for the shaft. For a solid shaft, the maximum shear stress (τ) is given by τ = (T * r) / J, where r is the radius and J is the polar moment of inertia. For a solid shaft, J = (π * r^4)/2.

Wait, but I think the formula is τ = (T * r) / J, and J for a solid shaft is (π d^4)/32, since J = (π (d/2)^4 ) / 2, which simplifies to π d^4 / 32. Because r = d/2. So J = (π r^4)/2 = (π (d/2)^4 ) / 2 = π d^4 / 32.

So rearranging to solve for d, I can set τ_allow = (T * (d/2)) / (π d^4 / 32) ), but actually, the allowable stress is the ultimate shear stress divided by the factor of safety. So τ_allow = 60,000 / 5 = 12,000 psi.

So τ_allow = (T * (d/2)) / (π d^4 /32) ) = (T * d / 2) * (32)/(π d^4) ) = (T * 16) / (π d^3)

So rearranged: τ_allow = (16 T) / (π d^3 )

I can rearrange this to solve for d:

d^3 = (16 T) / (π τ_allow )

So plugging in the numbers:

T is 393.9 lb-ft. Wait, but to use this in the formula, I think the units need to be consistent. Since shear stress is in psi (lb/in²), I should convert torque from lb-ft to lb-in. Because 1 ft = 12 inches, so 393.9 lb-ft = 393.9 * 12 = 4726.8 lb-in.

So T = 4726.8 lb-in.

So d^3 = (16 * 4726.8) / (π * 12,000 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

16 * 4726.8 = 75,628.8

Denominator: π * 12,000 ≈ 3.1416 * 12,000 ≈ 37,699.2

So d^3 = 75,628.8 / 37,699.2 ≈ 2.006

So d ≈ cube root of 2.006 ≈ 1.26 inches.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately. Cube of 1.26 is approx 2.000, since 1.26^3 = (1.26)(1.26)=1.5876, then *1.26: 1.5876 *1.26 ≈ 2.000, yes. So d ≈ 1.26 inches.

Wait, but looking at the options for solid shaft diameters: option B is 1.2 in, option E is 1.25, option H is 1.125, etc. So 1.26 is close to 1.25, but not exactly. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the torque again. Wait, 30 hp is correct? Let me double-check the torque calculation.

30 hp at 400 rpm: T = (30 * 5252) / 400. Let me compute that again. 30 * 5252 = 157,560. Divided by 400: 157560 / 400 = 393.9 lb-ft. So that's correct.

Wait, but when I converted to lb-in, I did 393.9 * 12 = 4726.8 lb-in. That's correct.

So d^3 = (16 * 4726.8) / (π * 12,000 )

Compute numerator: 16 * 4726.8 = 75,628.8.

Denominator: π * 12,000 ≈ 37,699.2.

So 75,628.8 / 37,699.2 ≈ 2.006.

Cube root of 2.006 is approximately 1.26 inches. But looking at the options, none have 1.26. The closest solid shaft option is E (1.25 in), B (1.2), or perhaps F (1.375). Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula I used for τ_allow is (16 T) / (π d^3). Let me confirm that. The formula τ = (16 T)/(π d^3) is correct for a solid shaft because J for solid is (π d^4)/32, so τ = T r / J = T (d/2) / (π d^4 /32) ) = (T d/2) * 32/(π d^4 ) = (16 T) / (π d^3). Yes, correct.

So d^3 = (16 * T) / (π τ_allow )

Wait, but let me check the units again. T is in lb-in, so (16 T) has units of lb-in. τ_allow is in psi, which is lb/in². So the units would be (lb-in) / (lb/in²) ) → (lb-in * in²) / lb ) → in^3. So units check out.

So d^3 = (75,628.8 lb-in) / (37,699.2 lb/in²) ) → (75,628.8 /37,699.2 ) in^3 → 2.006 in^3.

Cube root of 2.006 is approximately 1.26 inches. So the solid shaft diameter is about 1.26 inches, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest options are:

Option B: 1.2 in

Option E: 1.25 in

Option H: 1.125 in

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of torque. Because sometimes when dealing with horsepower and RPM, perhaps I should use the formula with ω in rad/s. Let me try that approach.

Power P = 30 hp.

ω = 400 rpm * (2π rad / 1 rev) * (1 min / 60 sec) ) = 400 * 2π /60 ≈ 41.8879 rad/s.

Then, P = T * ω / 5252? Wait, no, I think the formula is P (hp) = (T (lb-ft) * ω (rad/s)) / 5252. So T = P * 5252 / ω.

So T = (30 hp * 5252) / 41.8879 ≈ (157560) / 41.8879 ≈ 3762.8 lb-ft.

Wait, no, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 30 hp is about 30 * 5252 = 157560 lb-ft·rad/s? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up units. Let me think differently.

Wait, the correct formula is:

Power in horsepower: P = (T (lb-ft) * ω (rad/s)) / 5252.

So rearranged, T = (P * 5252) / ω.

So with P =30, ω = 400 rpm = 400 * 2π /60 = (400 * 3.1416)/60 ≈ (1256.64)/60 ≈ 20.944 rad/s.

So T = (30 * 5252) / 20.944 ≈ (157560) / 20.944 ≈ 7530.5 lb-ft. Wait, that's way too high. That can't be right because earlier I had 393.9 lb-ft. Something's wrong here.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing units. Let me double-check. 1 hp = 5252 lb-ft per minute. So to convert to lb-ft per second, it's 5252 / 60 ≈ 87.5333 lb-ft/s.

So P = 30 hp = 30 * 87.5333 ≈ 2626 lb-ft/s.

Power is also equal to T * ω, so T = P / ω.

So ω is 400 rpm = 400 * 2π /60 ≈ 41.8879 rad/s.

So T = 2626 lb-ft/s / 41.8879 rad/s ≈ 62.83 lb-ft.

Ah, that makes more sense. So earlier, I must have made a mistake in the initial torque calculation. So T is about 62.83 lb-ft.

Wait, that's a big difference. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I confused the formula. The correct formula is T = (P * 5252) / (N * 60), where N is in rpm. So let me compute that correctly.

So T = (30 hp * 5252) / (400 rpm * 60) ) → (157560) / (24,000) ) ≈ 6.565 lb-ft. Wait, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. I must be mixing up the formulas.

Let me clarify the correct formula for torque in lb-ft when power is in hp and speed is in rpm.

The correct formula is:

T (ft-lbf) = (P (hp) * 5252) / (N (rpm)).

Wait, but 5252 is the conversion factor for 1 hp to torque in lb-ft when speed is 1 rpm. So that's correct.

So T = (30 * 5252) / 400 → (157560) / 400 = 393.9 lb-ft.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. But when I tried using the other formula, I got 62.83 lb-ft. That's a discrepancy.

I must be making a mistake in the unit conversion elsewhere. Let me try to resolve this.

Another approach: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf per second. So 30 hp = 30 * 550 = 16,500 ft-lbf/s.

Power P = T * ω, so T = P / ω.

ω in rad/s is 400 rpm * (2π/60) ≈ 400 * 0.1047 ≈ 41.8879 rad/s.

So T = 16,500 / 41.8879 ≈ 393.9 lb-ft. Which matches the earlier calculation.

So that's correct. So T = 393.9 lb-ft. Which is 393.9 lb-ft.

Wait, but when I converted to lb-in earlier, I multiplied by 12, so 393.9 * 12 = 4726.8 lb-in. So that's correct.

So going back, for the solid shaft, d^3 = (16 * 4726.8) / (π * 12,000) ) → 75,628.8 / 37,699.2 ≈ 2.006.

Cube root of 2.006 is about 1.26 inches. So the solid shaft diameter is approximately 1.26 inches.

Looking at the options, none have exactly 1.26, but option E is 1.25 inches, which is close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But let me check the hollow shaft part. The hollow shaft has an inside diameter ratio to outside diameter of 0.5, so d_i = 0.5 d_o.

The formula for shear stress in a hollow shaft is similar but with the polar moment of inertia for a hollow shaft, which is J = π (d_o^4 - d_i^4)/32.

So τ_allow = (T * r_o) / J, where r_o is the outer radius.

But since d_i = 0.5 d_o, then d_i = d_o / 2. So r_i = d_i / 2 = d_o /4.

The outer radius r_o = d_o / 2.

J for hollow shaft is (π (d_o^4 - (d_o/2)^4 )) /32.

So J = π (d_o^4 - d_o^4/16 ) /32 = π d_o^4 (1 - 1/16) /32 = π d_o^4 (15/16) /32 = π d_o^4 * 15/(16*32) ) = π d_o^4 * 15/512 ≈ π d_o^4 * 0.029297.

So τ_allow = (T * r_o) / J = (T * (d_o/2)) / ( π d_o^4 * 15/(512) ) )

Simplify:

= (T * d_o/2) * (512) / (π d_o^4 * 15 )

= (T * 512) / (2 * π d_o^3 * 15 )

= (T * 512) / (30 π d_o^3 )

So τ_allow = (512 T) / (30 π d_o^3 )

Rearranging:

d_o^3 = (512 T) / (30 π τ_allow )

Plugging in the numbers:

T = 4726.8 lb-in

τ_allow = 12,000 psi

So numerator: 512 * 4726.8 ≈ 512 * 4726.8 ≈ Let's compute 500 *4726.8 = 2,363,400, 12*4726.8=56,721.6 → total ≈ 2,363,400 +56,721.6=2,420,121.6

Denominator: 30 * π * 12,000 ≈ 30 * 3.1416 * 12,000 ≈ 30 * 37,699.2 ≈ 1,130,976.

So d_o^3 = 2,420,121.6 / 1,130,976 ≈ 2.1405

Cube root of 2.1405 is approximately 1.29 inches.

So the hollow shaft outer diameter is about 1.29 inches, and the inner diameter is 0.5 * 1.29 ≈ 0.645 inches.

Looking at the options, the hollow shaft outer diameter that's close to 1.29 in would be option J: 1.75 in, which is too big. Option F is 1.375 in, outer diameter, inner 0.69 in. Hmm, but 1.29 is closer to 1.25 in.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation again. Let me re-calculate the hollow shaft part.

Wait, the formula I derived for τ_allow was: τ_allow = (512 T) / (30 π d_o^3 )

So d_o^3 = (512 T) / (30 π τ_allow )

Plugging numbers:

T = 4726.8 lb-in

τ_allow = 12,000 psi

So 512 * 4726.8 = ?

Let me compute 500 *4726.8 = 2,363,400

12 *4726.8 = 56,721.6

Total = 2,363,400 +56,721.6=2,420,121.6

Denominator: 30 * π *12,000=30*3.1416*12,000≈30*37,699.2≈1,130,976

d_o^3=2,420,121.6 /1,130,976≈2.1405

Cube root of 2.1405 is approx 1.29 inches.

So the hollow shaft outer diameter is about 1.29 in, which is not exactly any option. The closest is option F: 1.375 in. But 1.29 is closer to 1.25, which is option E for the solid shaft. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options for hollow shaft outer diameters:

A: 1.625

B:1.2

C:1.4

D:1.5

E:1.25

F:1.375

G:2

H:1.125

I:1 5/16 (1.3125)

J:1.75

So 1.29 is close to 1.3125 (option I) or 1.25 (option E). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the hollow shaft calculation.

The formula for J in a hollow shaft is J = π (d_o^4 - d_i^4)/32.

Since d_i = 0.5 d_o, then d_i = d_o/2.

So J = π (d_o^4 - (d_o/2)^4)/32 = π (d_o^4 - d_o^4/16)/32 = π (15 d_o^4 /16 ) /32 = π *15 d_o^4 / (16*32) ) = 15 π d_o^4 / 512.

The shear stress formula is τ = T r_o / J.

r_o = d_o/2.

So τ = T (d_o/2) / (15 π d_o^4 /512 )

= T * d_o/2 * 512 / (15 π d_o^4 )

= T * 512/(2 *15 π d_o^3 )

= T * 512/(30 π d_o^3 )

Which is the same as before. So the formula is correct.

So d_o^3 = (512 T) / (30 π τ_allow )

Plugging the numbers again:

T = 4726.8 lb-in

τ_allow = 12,000 psi

So numerator: 512 *4726.8=2,420,121.6

Denominator:30 * π *12,000=30*3.1416*12,000=30*37,699.2=1,130,976

d_o^3=2,420,121.6 /1,130,976≈2.1405

Cube root of 2.1405≈1.29 in.

So the hollow shaft outer diameter is approximately 1.29 in, inner diameter would be 0.645 in.

Looking at the options, none have 1.29 in. The closest is option F: 1.375 in, inner 0.69 in, which is a bit larger than calculated. Alternatively, option E has a solid shaft of 1.25 in and hollow outer 1.25 in, inner 0.625 in.

Wait, but for the hollow shaft, the outer diameter is 1.29 in, so the closest would be option F's 1.375 in, but that's a bit larger. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the factor of safety correctly. The ultimate shear stress is 60,000 psi, and the factor of safety is 5, so the allowable shear stress is 60,000 /5=12,000 psi. So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the solid and hollow shafts to have the same outer diameter but different inner diameters. So looking at the options, options A to J have the same outer diameter for both solid and hollow, except for option I which has 1 5/16 in for solid and 1.3125 in for hollow outer? Wait, no, looking back, option I says:

I: Solid shaft diameter: 1 5/16 in, Hollow shaft outer diameter: 1 5/16 in, Hollow shaft inner diameter: 0.66 in.

Wait, 1 5/16 is 1.3125 in.

So for the hollow shaft, if the outer is 1.3125 in, inner is 0.66 in. Let's check if this matches our calculation.

Compute d_o^3 for option I's hollow shaft:1.3125 in.

d_o =1.3125 in.

So d_o^3 =1.3125^3≈2.25 in^3.

Using the formula, d_o^3 = (512 *4726.8)/(30 * π *12,000 )≈2.1405.

So 1.3125^3=2.25, which is a bit higher than 2.1405. So the required d_o^3 is 2.14, so d_o≈1.29 inches, which is less than 1.3125. So option I's hollow shaft would have a slightly larger outer diameter than needed, which might be acceptable. But the closest option is I: 1.3125 in, or perhaps F:1.375 in.

Alternatively, perhaps the solid shaft diameter in the options is 1.25 in (option E), which is close to our calculated 1.26 in. So the solid shaft would be 1.25 in, and the hollow shaft would have the same outer diameter of 1.25 in, with inner diameter 0.625 in.

Wait, but let's check if that works.

For the hollow shaft with d_o=1.25 in, d_i=0.625 in.

Compute the required τ_allow.

Using the formula τ_allow = (512 T) / (30 π d_o^3 )

T=4726.8 lb-in.

d_o=1.25 in.

So d_o^3=1.953125 in^3.

τ_allow= (512 *4726.8) / (30 * π *1.953125 )

Compute numerator:512 *4726.8≈2,420,121.6

Denominator:30 * π *1.953125≈30 *3.1416 *1.953125≈30*6.1359≈184.078.

So τ_allow≈2,420,121.6 /184.078≈13,145 psi.

But our allowable stress is 12,000 psi. So this would exceed the allowable stress. Therefore, the hollow shaft with d_o=1.25 in would not be sufficient, as the stress would be higher than allowed.

So perhaps the correct answer is option F: solid shaft 1.375 in, hollow outer 1.375 in, inner 0.69 in.

Let me check that.

For solid shaft d=1.375 in:

d^3=1.375^3≈2.597 in^3.

τ_allow= (16 *4726.8)/(π *2.597 )

=75,628.8 / (8.162 )

≈9263 psi.

But our allowable is 12,000 psi, so this would be safe.

For the hollow shaft with d_o=1.375 in, d_i=0.69 in.

Compute τ_allow:

d_o=1.375 in.

d_i=0.69 in.

Compute J=π (d_o^4 - d_i^4)/32.

d_o^4= (1.375)^4≈3.594 in^4.

d_i^4=(0.69)^4≈0.231 in^4.

So J=π (3.594 -0.231)/32= π *3.363/32≈3.363 *3.1416 /32≈10.57 /32≈0.3303 in^4.

r_o=1.375/2=0.6875 in.

τ_allow= T * r_o / J =4726.8 *0.6875 /0.3303≈(4726.8 *0.6875)=3243.75 /0.3303≈9820 psi.

Which is below the allowable 12,000 psi. So the hollow shaft would be safe.

But earlier, our calculation for the hollow shaft with d_o=1.29 in would have τ_allow=12,000 psi.

So if the hollow shaft uses d_o=1.375 in, the stress is 9820 psi, which is well within the allowable limit. So perhaps the correct option is F, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but looking back, the solid shaft's calculated diameter is approximately 1.26 in. So the closest option is E:1.25 in, but that would give τ_allow= (16*4726.8)/(π*(1.25)^3 ).

(1.25)^3=1.953125.

So 16*4726.8=75,628.8.

75,628.8/(π*1.953125)=75,628.8/(6.1359)=12,322 psi.

Which is just above the allowable 12,000 psi. So that's not acceptable. So the solid shaft needs a slightly larger diameter than 1.25 in, like 1.26 in.

Looking at the options, none have 1.26 in. So perhaps the intended answer is E for the solid shaft (1.25 in) and F for the hollow (1.375 in). But that's not the same outer diameter as the solid shaft.

Wait, the question says the shaft selected is a) solid and b) hollow. So each part is separate. So for part a) solid, choose the diameter, and for part b) hollow, choose the hollow diameters given.

Wait, no, looking at the options, each option gives both the solid and hollow shaft dimensions. So the user has to pick the option where both the solid and hollow shaft dimensions are correct.

So from the solid shaft calculation, the correct diameter is ~1.26 in. So looking for an option where solid shaft is around 1.26 in. The options are:

A:1.625

B:1.2

C:1.4

D:1.5

E:1.25

F:1.375

G:2

H:1.125

I:1.3125

J:1.75

The closest is E:1.25 in.

But as calculated earlier, using E's solid shaft would give τ_allow=12,322 psi, which is above the allowable 12,000 psi. So that's not acceptable. So perhaps the correct option is B:1.2 in.

Let me check for solid shaft d=1.2 in.

d^3=1.728 in^3.

τ_allow= (16 *4726.8)/(π *1.728 )

=75,628.8/(5.429 )

≈13,930 psi. That's way above allowable. So not acceptable.

So the only option that gives a τ_allow ≤12,000 psi is E for solid shaft, but that's slightly over. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, as it's the closest.

For the hollow shaft, using d_o=1.25 in, the stress was 13,145 psi, which is over. So perhaps the correct hollow shaft is option F, with d_o=1.375 in, which gives τ_allow=9820 psi.

So in that case, the correct option would be F: solid 1.375 in, hollow 1.375 in, inner 0.69 in.

Wait, but the solid shaft with d=1.375 in would have τ_allow=9263 psi, which is well under 12,000 psi. So that's safe.

But the problem is that the solid shaft calculation requires about 1.26 in, which isn't exactly any option. So perhaps the intended answer is option E, but that would be incorrect for the solid shaft.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial torque calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, I'm confident that T=393.9 lb-ft is correct. So the solid shaft calculation leads me to d≈1.26 in.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but the closest is E:1.25 in. But that's not sufficient. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose from the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the torque was miscalculated. Let me try using the other approach where I got T=62.83 lb-ft.

Wait, that was when I used the formula P= T * ω /5252, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify the correct formula.

The correct formula is P (hp) = (T (lb-ft) * ω (rad/s)) / 5252.

So ω in rad/s is 400 rpm * 2π/60 = 400 * 0.1047 ≈41.8879 rad/s.

So T = (30 hp * 5252) / (41.8879 rad/s) → (157560) /41.8879 ≈3762 lb-ft.

Wait, that's way too high. That can't be right because earlier methods gave T=393.9 lb-ft.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. I think the correct way is T = (P * 5252) / (N * 60) ), because P in hp is torque in lb-ft multiplied by RPM, divided by 5252.

So T = (30 * 5252) / (400 *60) → 157560/(24,000)=6.565 lb-ft. That can't be right because that's too low.

I'm confused. Let me look up the correct formula for torque in lb-ft when given horsepower and RPM.

The correct formula is T (lb-ft) = (P (hp) * 5252) / RPM.

So T = (30 *5252)/400 = 393.9 lb-ft. So that's correct.

So I'll stick with T=393.9 lb-ft.

So for the solid shaft, d≈1.26 in, but no option matches. For the hollow shaft, d_o≈1.29 in, but again, no option matches.

Looking back at the options, option F has hollow outer diameter 1.375 in, which would give a safe stress. So perhaps the intended answer is F for both.

But the solid shaft would be 1.375 in, which gives a lower stress than required, but it's the only option that provides both the solid and hollow shafts with the same outer diameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E: solid 1.25 in, hollow 1.25 in, inner 0.625 in.

Even though the solid shaft's stress is slightly over, but maybe the question expects rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hollow shaft calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the hollow shaft for option E: d_o=1.25 in, d_i=0.625 in.

Compute τ_allow.

J=π (d_o^4 -d_i^4)/32.

d_o=1.25, d_i=0.625.

d_o^4= (1.25)^4=2.4414.

d_i^4= (0.625)^4= (5/8)^4=625/4096≈0.1526.

So J=π (2.4414 -0.1526)/32= π (2.2888)/32≈3.1416 *2.2888/32≈7.16/32≈0.2237 in^4.

r_o=1.25/2=0.625 in.

τ_allow= T * r_o / J = 4726.8 *0.625 /0.2237≈(4726.8 *0.625)=2954.25 /0.2237≈13,200 psi.

Which exceeds the allowable 12,000 psi. So option E's hollow shaft is not sufficient.

For option F's hollow shaft: d_o=1.375, d_i=0.69.

Compute J=π (1.375^4 -0.69^4)/32.

1.375^4≈3.594.

0.69^4≈0.231.

So J=π (3.594 -0.231)/32= π *3.363/32≈3.1416 *3.363≈10.57 /32≈0.3303 in^4.

r_o=1.375/2=0.6875 in.

τ_allow=4726.8 *0.6875 /0.3303≈3243.75 /0.3303≈9820 psi.

Which is within allowable.

So for the hollow shaft, option F works, and for the solid shaft, option F's diameter is 1.375 in, which gives τ_allow=9263 psi, which is well within the allowable.

So perhaps the intended answer is F: solid 1.375 in, hollow 1.375 in, inner 0.69 in.

But earlier, the solid shaft's required diameter was 1.26 in, which is less than 1.375 in. So perhaps the correct option is F.
</think>

To determine the diameter of both a solid and a hollow shaft transmitting 30 hp at 400 rpm, the following steps were taken:

1. **Torque Calculation**:  
   Using the formula \( P = \frac{T \cdot \omega}{5252} \), where \( P = 30 \, \text{hp} \) and \( \omega = 400 \, \text{rpm} \), the torque \( T \) was calculated as \( 393.9 \, \text{lb-ft} \). Converting to \( \text{lb-in} \), \( T = 4726.8 \, \text{lb-in} \).

2. **Solid Shaft Diameter**:  
   The allowable shear stress is \( \tau_{\text{allow}} = \frac{60,000}{5} = 12,000 \, \text{psi} \). Using the formula \( \tau_{\text{allow}} = \frac{16T}{\pi d^3} \), the diameter \( d \) was calculated as approximately \( 1.26 \, \text{in} \). Among the options, the closest solid shaft diameter is \( 1.25 \, \text{in} \) (option E).

3. **Hollow Shaft Diameter**:  
   For the hollow shaft with \( d_i = 0.5 d_o \), the allowable shear stress formula \( \tau_{\text{allow}} = \frac{512T}{30\pi d_o^3} \) was used. Solving for \( d_o \), the calculated outer diameter is approximately \( 1.29 \, \text{in} \). However, none of the options match this exactly. The closest hollow shaft outer diameter is \( 1.375 \, \text{in} \) (option F), with an inner diameter of \( 0.69 \, \text{in} \).

4. **Verification**:  
   For the solid shaft in option E (\( d = 1.25 \, \text{in} \)), the calculated stress slightly exceeds the allowable limit, making it unsuitable. For the hollow shaft in option F (\( d_o = 1.375 \, \text{in}, d_i = 0.69 \, \text{in} \)), the stress is well within the allowable limit. Thus, option F provides a safe design for both the solid and hollow shafts.

**Answer**:  
F
