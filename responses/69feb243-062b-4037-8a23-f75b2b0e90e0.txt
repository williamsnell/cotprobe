Question:

 If a global ban would not be effective in prohibiting genetic engineering that goes beyond eliminating obvious defects, then Singer suggests which "bolder" strategy?

Options:

A: none of the above
B: using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering
C: using sanctions and trade restrictions against countries that violate the ban
D: allowing genetic engineering only for medical purposes
E: promoting genetic engineering only for the wealthy
F: creating a global consensus on acceptable genetic engineering practices
G: developing a global regulatory body to monitor and control genetic engineering activities
H: implementing a global education program to convince people of the dangers of excessive genetic engineering
I: requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child
J: creating a world military that would enforce the ban with greater strength

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about Singer's suggestion regarding a "bolder" strategy if a global ban on genetic engineering isn't effective. I'm a bit rusty on Singer's arguments, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says that a global ban isn't effective in prohibiting genetic engineering beyond eliminating obvious defects. So, Singer is suggesting a different approach. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that Singer is a philosopher who discusses various ethical issues, including genetic engineering. He's concerned about the potential misuse of genetic technology, especially for enhancement purposes beyond treating diseases. So, a global ban might not be enough because countries or individuals might still find ways around it, especially if there's profit or perceived benefit in doing so.

Looking at the options, I need to find what Singer suggests as a "bolder" strategy. Bolder implies something more aggressive or comprehensive than just a ban. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: None of the above. Well, I'll check the others first before considering this.

Option B: Lottery system for fair chances. That doesn't seem related. A lottery system would be about distributing resources, not about regulating genetic engineering practices.

Option C: Sanctions and trade restrictions. That's a form of enforcement. If a ban isn't working, using sanctions could be a way to pressure countries into compliance. I think Singer might consider stronger enforcement measures, but I'm not sure if this is his exact suggestion.

Option D: Allow only for medical purposes. That sounds like a more restrictive approach, but is it "bolder"? The question is about what to do if the ban isn't effective, so maybe a different strategy is needed beyond just restricting use.

Option E: Promote only for the wealthy. That seems counterintuitive. If anything, Singer is probably against unequal access, so this might not be it.

Option F: Global consensus on acceptable practices. This sounds like establishing guidelines or norms that everyone agrees to. But is that bold enough? It's more about agreement rather than enforcement.

Option G: Global regulatory body to monitor and control. This seems like a strong measure. Having an international body to oversee and regulate genetic engineering activities could be a bold strategy. It's more proactive and enforceable.

Option H: Education program to convince people of dangers. Education is important, but it's a softer approach. The question asks for a bolder strategy, so maybe this isn't the answer.

Option I: Require genetic engineering for every newborn. That sounds extreme and unethical. Singer is probably against mandatory genetic engineering, so this is unlikely.

Option J: World military to enforce the ban. That's very bold, but also extreme. It's unclear if Singer would suggest military enforcement, which seems overly aggressive.

Now, thinking about Singer's arguments, he often emphasizes the need for international cooperation and regulation to address global issues. In his book "Practical Ethics," he discusses the limitations of individual countries acting alone and suggests the need for global governance. So, a global regulatory body (Option G) makes sense as a bold strategy because it provides oversight and control, which a ban alone might not achieve.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between Option C (sanctions) and Option G (regulatory body). Sanctions are a form of enforcement, but a regulatory body would handle monitoring and regulation more comprehensively. Singer might prefer a structured approach rather than just punitive measures. So, I think G is more likely the answer.

The correct answer is G: developing a global regulatory body to monitor and control genetic engineering activities. This approach is bold and comprehensive, addressing the need for effective oversight beyond a mere ban.

Answer: G
