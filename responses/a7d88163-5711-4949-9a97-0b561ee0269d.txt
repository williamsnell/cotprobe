Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the basic laws of Boolean algebra. Let me start by recalling what I know about Boolean algebra.

Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra where variables are logical quantities with only two possible values: 0 (false) and 1 (true). The basic operations include AND, OR, and NOT. There are several fundamental laws that govern these operations.

First, I remember some of the basic laws. Let me list them out:

1. **Commutative Law**: This states that the order of operands doesn't matter. So, A + B = B + A and A * B = B * A.
2. **Associative Law**: The way operands are grouped doesn't affect the result. So, (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) and (A * B) * C = A * (B * C).
3. **Distributive Law**: This is similar to regular algebra where multiplication distributes over addition. So, A + (B * C) = (A + B) * (A + C) and A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C).
4. **Idempotent Law**: This says that a variable ANDed with itself is the variable, and a variable ORed with itself is also the variable. So, A + A = A and A * A = A.
5. **Identity Law**: There are additive and multiplicative identities. The additive identity is 0, where A + 0 = A, and the multiplicative identity is 1, where A * 1 = A.
6. **Inverse Law**: The complement of a variable ORed with the variable itself gives 1, and the complement ANDed with the variable gives 0. So, A + A' = 1 and A * A' = 0.
7. **De Morgan's Law**: These laws relate the complement of combinations. So, (A + B)' = A' * B' and (A * B)' = A' + B'.
8. **Absorption Law**: This is when a term is absorbed by another. For example, A + (A * B) = A and A * (A + B) = A.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Lists Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Law of Union, Law of Intersection, Double Negative Law, Law of complement, and deMorgan's law. That seems comprehensive. Wait, Law of Union and Intersection might be redundant because Union is OR and Intersection is AND, which are the basic operations. But they are part of the basic laws.

Option B: Only mentions Addition, Multiplication, and Complement. That's too limited because it's missing several key laws like Distributive, Idempotent, etc.

Option C: Talks about scalar multiplication, vector addition, etc. That doesn't fit Boolean algebra, which deals with binary variables and logical operations, not vector operations.

Option D: Includes Associative, Distributive, Commutative, and Identity. Missing some like Idempotent, Inverse, and De Morgan's.

Option E: Law of Excluded Middle and Non-Contradiction are more philosophical principles in logic, not specific Boolean algebra laws. Law of Identity is part of Boolean laws but the others here don't fit.

Option F: Non-Commutative isn't correct because Boolean operations are commutative. Exclusive OR is an operation but not a fundamental law.

Option G: Lists Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, and Inverse. That's good, but missing Idempotent and De Morgan's laws, which are important.

Option H: Transitive, Reflexive, Symmetric are properties of relations, not Boolean laws.

Option I: Reduction, etc., are more calculus terms, irrelevant here.

Option J: Basic arithmetic operations, not Boolean.

So, looking back, the most comprehensive answer seems to be Option A. It includes all the major laws like Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Union, Intersection, Double Negative (which is Involution), Law of Complement, and De Morgan's. Even though Union and Intersection might be considered as operations rather than laws, they are foundational and part of the basic structure.

Wait, but does Boolean algebra include the Law of Union and Intersection as separate laws? Or are they just operations? I think they are more about the operations, but the laws governing them would be the ones I listed earlier. So maybe the wording in Option A is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G, which includes the main five: Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, and Inverse.

But another angle: the basic laws are often grouped into the four main laws: (1) Commutative, (2) Associative, (3) Distributive, and (4) Identity. But that's not all. Idempotent is another. So, perhaps Option G is missing some, but Option A includes more.

Wait, the question is about the basic laws. Some sources list the basic laws as:

- Idempotent Law
- Commutative Law
- Associative Law
- Distributive Law
- Identity Law
- Complement Law
- De Morgan's Law

Looking at Option A, it includes Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Law of Union (OR), Law of Intersection (AND), Double Negative (Involution), Law of complement, and deMorgan's. So that's covering all the main points except maybe Identity Law, which is covered under Law of complement perhaps? Or is the Identity Law separate?

Wait, the Identity Law is A + 0 = A and A * 1 = A. So it's a separate law. Option A doesn't explicitly mention Identity Law but includes Law of complement and others. Hmm.

Option G includes Identity as one of the laws, but misses some others like Idempotent and De Morgan's.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's the most comprehensive, including all the major laws, even if the wording is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G, which includes the main algebraic laws.

Wait, another thought: Boolean algebra is based on the algebraic laws similar to regular algebra but adapted for binary variables. The basic laws include the three main algebraic properties: Commutative, Associative, and Distributive. Additionally, there are specific Boolean laws like Idempotent, Complement, and De Morgan's.

So looking at the options, Option G includes Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, and Inverse. That's five laws. Identity and Inverse are part of the basic structure. But where are Idempotent and De Morgan's? They are important but perhaps considered as separate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the basic laws as the algebraic laws, which would be Commutative, Associative, Distributive. But the answer options don't have that.

Wait, looking at Option G: it includes all the main algebraic properties plus Identity and Inverse. That seems more accurate than others.

But I'm a bit confused because the correct answer should include more than just algebraic properties. So perhaps Option A is better because it includes De Morgan's law, which is a fundamental Boolean law.

Alternatively, the correct answer is A because it's the only option that includes De Morgan's law, which is definitely a key law in Boolean algebra.

The basic laws of Boolean algebra include several fundamental principles that govern the operations of AND, OR, and NOT. These laws include the Commutative, Associative, and Distributive laws, which are similar to those in regular algebra. Additionally, Boolean algebra has specific laws such as Idempotent, Identity, Complement, and De Morgan's laws. Among the options provided, Option A is the most comprehensive as it includes all these key laws, making it the correct answer.
