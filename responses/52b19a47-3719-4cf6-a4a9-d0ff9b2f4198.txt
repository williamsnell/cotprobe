Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about an electron on the axis of an electric dipole. The electron is 25 nm away from the center of the dipole, and the dipole moment is 3.6 × 10^-29 C·m. I need to find the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the electron. The options are given from A to J, all in terms of 10^-15 N.

Hmm, I remember that electric dipoles have a specific formula for the electric field along their axis. Since the distance from the center is much larger than the dipole's size, I think we can use the approximation for a point along the dipole's axis where r is much larger than the separation distance of the charges, so the dipole behaves in a certain way.

Wait, the formula for the electric field on the axis of a dipole... I think it's E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³), where p is the dipole moment and r is the distance from the center. Oh right, because for a dipole, the electric field along the axis is stronger than perpendicular to it. 

But wait, the electron is negatively charged, so the force would be in the opposite direction of the electric field. But since the question asks for magnitude, the direction doesn't matter here. I just need to calculate the magnitude of the force.

So, the force F on a charge q in an electric field E is F = qE. Here, q is the charge of the electron, which is -e, but again, since we're looking for magnitude, it'll just be e. 

So putting it all together, F = e * (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³).

Let me make sure I have all the values right. The dipole moment p is 3.6e-29 C·m. The distance r is 25 nm, which is 25e-9 meters. Oh wait, 25 nm is 25 × 10^-9 m, right.

I also need to remember the value of 1/(4πε₀), which is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Let me take that as 9e9 for simplicity, but maybe I should use the exact value for more accurate calculation.

So, let's break it down:

First, calculate the electric field E using E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/(r³).

Then, multiply E by the electron's charge e to get F.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Compute r³: (25e-9 m)^3. Let me compute that. 25^3 is 15625, and (1e-9)^3 is 1e-27, so r³ = 15625e-27 m³. Wait, 25 is 2.5e1, so 25^3 is 2.5^3 * 1e3 = 15.625 * 1e3 = 1.5625e4, so 1.5625e4 * (1e-9)^3 = 1.5625e4 * 1e-27 = 1.5625e-23 m³.

Wait, wait, 25 nm is 25e-9 meters. So r = 25e-9 m.

r³ = (25e-9)^3 = 25^3 * (e-9)^3 = 15625 * (1e-27) ) = 1.5625e4 * 1e-27 = 1.5625e-23 m³. Yeah, that's correct.

So E = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (2 * 3.6e-29 C·m) / (1.5625e-23 m³).

Let me compute the numerator first: 2 * 3.6e-29 = 7.2e-29.

So E = 8.988e9 * 7.2e-29 / 1.5625e-23.

Hmm, let me compute that step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 7.2e-29 = ?

8.988 *7.2 is approximately 64.7136, and 1e9 * 1e-29 = 1e-20. So that's 64.7136e-20, which is 6.47136e-19.

Now, divide that by 1.5625e-23.

So, 6.47136e-19 / 1.5625e-23 = (6.47136 / 1.5625) * 1e4.

6.47136 / 1.5625 is approximately 4.141 (since 1.5625 * 4 = 6.25, and 1.5625 * 4.141 is close to 6.47). So it's about 4.141e4.

Wait, but wait, 6.47136 / 1.5625: let me compute that more accurately.

1.5625 × 4 = 6.25. 

6.47136 -6.25 = 0.22136.

So 0.22136 / 1.5625 ≈ 0.1414.

So total is 4.1414. So the division gives 4.1414e4, because 1e-19 / 1e-23 = 1e4.

So E ≈ 4.1414e4 N/C.

Wait, but wait, 8.988e9 *7.2e-29 is 6.47136e-19, and dividing by 1.5625e-23 gives (6.47136e-19)/(1.5625e-23) = (6.47136 / 1.5625) * 1e4.

Which is approximately 4.1414 * 1e4 = 4.1414e4 N/C.

Now, the electric field E is about 4.1414e4 N/C.

Then, the force F is e * E. The charge of an electron e is 1.602e-19 C.

So F = 1.602e-19 C * 4.1414e4 N/C.

Multiply 1.602e-19 by 4.1414e4.

1.602 *4.1414 ≈ 6.64 (since 1.6 *4 =6.4, and 0.002 *4=0.008, and the rest adds up to about 6.64).

And 1e-19 * 1e4 = 1e-15.

So F ≈ 6.64e-15 N.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check that multiplication more accurately.

1.602 ×4.1414 = ?

1.602 *4 = 6.408

1.602 *0.1414 ≈ 0.2272 (since 1.602 *0.1=0.1602, 1.602*0.04=0.06408, 1.602*0.0014≈0.0022428; adding up 0.1602 +0.06408=0.22428, plus 0.0022428≈0.2265228.)

So total is 6.408 + 0.2265228 ≈ 6.6345.

So F ≈ 6.6345e-15 N.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.6 ×10^-15 N, which matches closely.

Wait, but let me check if I made any calculation mistakes. Hmm.

Wait, did I compute E correctly? Let me recalculate E. 

E = (8.988e9) * (2*3.6e-29) / ( (25e-9)^3 )

2*3.6e-29 is 7.2e-29.

(25e-9)^3 = 25^3 * (1e-9)^3 = 15625 * 1e-27 = 1.5625e-23.

So E = (8.988e9 * 7.2e-29) / 1.5625e-23.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 7.2e-29.

8.988 *7.2 = let me compute that accurately.

8 *7.2=57.6, 0.988 *7.2≈7.1136 → total 57.6 +7.1136=64.7136.

So 64.7136e(9-29) = 64.7136e-20 → 6.47136e-19.

Divide by 1.5625e-23 → (6.47136e-19)/(1.5625e-23) = (6.47136 /1.5625) * 1e4.

6.47136 ÷ 1.5625: Let me compute this division carefully.

1.5625 ×4 =6.25, as I did before. So 6.47136 –6.25=0.22136.

Now, 0.22136 ÷1.5625: 1.5625 × 0.14 is 0.21875. So 0.22136–0.21875=0.00261.

0.00261 ÷1.5625 ≈0.001675.

So total division is 4.14 + 0.001675=4.141675.

So E ≈4.141675e4 N/C.

Then F = e * E =1.602e-19 C *4.141675e4 N/C.

1.602e-19 *4.141675e4 = (1.602 *4.141675) ×1e-15.

Compute 1.602 ×4.141675:

Let me compute it as:

1.6 ×4.141675 = 6.62668 (since 1.6 ×4=6.4, 1.6 ×0.141675≈0.22668 → total 6.62668).

0.002 ×4.141675=0.00828335.

Adding together: 6.62668 +0.00828335≈6.63496.

So F ≈6.63496e-15 N, which is approximately 6.635e-15 N.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.6 ×10^-15 N, which is very close.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the formula. The electric field along the dipole axis is indeed (2p)/(4πε₀ r³), right? So the factor is 2p/(r³), multiplied by 1/(4πε₀). Yeah, that's correct.

Another way to think about this is the electric field due to a dipole at a point along its axis. The formula is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2p)/r³.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be approximately 6.6 ×10^-15 N, which is option A.
</think>

The magnitude of the electrostatic force on the electron is calculated using the electric field along the axis of the dipole. The formula for the electric field is \( E = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{2p}{r^3} \), where \( p \) is the dipole moment and \( r \) is the distance from the center. Substituting the given values, the electric field is found to be approximately \( 4.14 \times 10^4 \, \text{N/C} \). The force on the electron is then \( F = e \cdot E \), where \( e \) is the elementary charge. This results in a force of \( 6.6 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option A.
