Okay, so I've got this Poisson process problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my probability, but I'll do my best.

The problem says: Let {N(t), t ∈ [0, ∞)} be a Poisson process with rate λ = 0.5. We need to find the probability of no arrivals in the interval [3, 5). The options are given as A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that a Poisson process has independent increments, which means the number of arrivals in non-overlapping intervals are independent. Also, the number of arrivals in any interval of length t follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ*t.

So, the key here is to find the probability that no arrivals occur between time t=3 and t=5. That interval has a length of 5 - 3 = 2 units of time. Let me denote this interval as [3,5), so the length is 2.

The probability of no arrivals in this interval is the same as the probability that a Poisson process with parameter λ=0.5 has zero events in time t=2. The formula for the probability of zero events in a Poisson distribution is e^(-λt), right?

Wait, let me double-check that. The Poisson probability formula is P(k) = (e^(-λt) * (λt)^k) / k! for k=0,1,2,... So when k=0, P(0) = e^(-λt). That's correct.

So, plugging in the values: λ=0.5, t=2. So λt = 0.5 * 2 = 1. Therefore, P(0) = e^(-1).

What's e^(-1)? I know that e is approximately 2.71828, so e^(-1) is about 1/2.71828 ≈ 0.3679. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option H is 0.37, which is close to 0.3679. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I calculate the correct interval length? The interval is from 3 to 5, which is indeed 2 units. So λt is 0.5 * 2 = 1, and e^-1 is correct. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the time intervals. Wait, Poisson processes have the property that the number of events in any interval of length t is Poisson with parameter λt. So yes, the interval [3,5) is of length 2, so λt=1, and the probability is e^-1≈0.3679, which is approximately 0.37.

So the correct answer should be H: 0.37.

The probability of no arrivals in the interval [3,5) for a Poisson process with rate λ=0.5 is calculated using the formula for the Poisson distribution with k=0, resulting in e^(-1) ≈ 0.3679, which rounds to 0.37.

Answer: H
