Okay, so I need to find the curvature for the function f(x) = sqrt(4x - x²) at x=2. Hmm, I remember that curvature involves some calculus, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

I recall that the formula for curvature κ of a function y = f(x) is given by:

κ = |f''(x)| / (1 + (f'(x))²)^(3/2)

Right, so I need to find the first and second derivatives of f(x) and evaluate them at x=2.

First, let's write down f(x):

f(x) = sqrt(4x - x²) = (4x - x²)^(1/2)

To find f'(x), I'll use the chain rule. The derivative of (u)^(1/2) is (1/(2sqrt(u))) * u', where u = 4x - x².

So,

f'(x) = [1/(2*(4x - x²)^(1/2))] * (4 - 2x)

Simplify that:

f'(x) = (4 - 2x)/(2*sqrt(4x - x²))

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (2*(2 - x))/(2*sqrt(4x - x²)) )
= (2 - x)/sqrt(4x - x²)

Okay, so f'(x) = (2 - x)/sqrt(4x - x²)

Now, I need to find f''(x). Let's compute that.

Let me denote f'(x) as (2 - x)*(4x - x²)^(-1/2)

So, using the product rule:

f''(x) = d/dx [ (2 - x) ] * (4x - x²)^(-1/2) + (2 - x) * d/dx [ (4x - x²)^(-1/2) ]

First term: derivative of (2 - x) is -1, so:

-1 * (4x - x²)^(-1/2) = -1 / sqrt(4x - x²)

Second term: (2 - x) multiplied by the derivative of (4x - x²)^(-1/2). Let's compute that derivative using the chain rule.

Let u = 4x - x², so d/dx [u^(-1/2)] = (-1/2) u^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x)

So,

(2 - x) * [ (-1/2)(4x - x²)^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x) ]

Simplify this:

= (2 - x) * (-1/2)(4 - 2x) / (4x - x²)^(3/2)

Note that (4 - 2x) = 2*(2 - x), so:

= (2 - x) * (-1/2) * 2*(2 - x) / (4x - x²)^(3/2)

The 2 and (-1/2) cancel, giving -1.

So,

= -( (2 - x)^2 ) / (4x - x²)^(3/2)

Putting both terms together, f''(x) is:

-1/(sqrt(4x - x²)) + [ -( (2 - x)^2 ) / (4x - x²)^(3/2) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out 1/(4x - x²)^(3/2) to combine these terms.

Let me write both terms with denominator (4x - x²)^(3/2):

First term: -1/(sqrt(4x - x²)) = - (4x - x²) / (4x - x²)^(3/2)

So,

f''(x) = [ - (4x - x²) - (2 - x)^2 ] / (4x - x²)^(3/2)

Now, expand the numerator:

(4x - x²) + (2 - x)^2 = let's compute each part.

(2 - x)^2 = 4 - 4x + x²

So numerator becomes:

- [ (4x - x²) + (4 -4x + x²) ]

Simplify inside:

4x -x² +4 -4x +x² = 4x -4x cancels, -x² +x² cancels, leaving 4.

So numerator is -4.

Thus,

f''(x) = (-4) / (4x - x²)^(3/2)

Now, evaluate f''(x) at x=2.

First, compute 4x - x² at x=2:

4*(2) - (2)^2 = 8 -4 =4.

So,

f''(2) = (-4) / (4)^(3/2)

What's 4^(3/2)? That's sqrt(4)^3 = 2^3=8.

So,

f''(2) = (-4)/8 = -0.5

Now, compute f'(2). Earlier, we found f'(x) = (2 -x)/sqrt(4x -x²)

At x=2,

f'(2) = (2-2)/sqrt(4*2 -2^2) = 0 / sqrt(8-4) = 0/2 =0

So, f'(2)=0.

Now, plug into curvature formula:

κ = |f''(2)| / (1 + (f'(2))^2 )^(3/2)

Since f'(2)=0, the denominator becomes (1 +0)^(3/2) =1

So,

κ = | -0.5 | / 1 = 0.5

Looking at the options, option C is 0.5.

The curvature for the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{4x - x^2} \) at \( x = 2 \) is calculated using the formula \( \kappa = \frac{|f''(x)|}{(1 + (f'(x))^2)^{3/2}} \). After computing the first and second derivatives and evaluating them at \( x = 2 \), the curvature is found to be 0.5.
