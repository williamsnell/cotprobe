Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the value of an infinite product, specifically the product from n equals 0 to infinity of (1 + (1/2)^{2^n}). The options given are A through J, with various numerical values. I'm a bit rusty on infinite products, so I'll have to think this through step by step.

First, let me write down the product to make it clearer. The product is ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + (1/2)^{2^n}). Hmm, that's a product of terms where each term is 1 plus (1/2) raised to the power of 2^n. So for n=0, it's (1 + 1/2), for n=1, it's (1 + 1/4), for n=2, (1 + 1/16), and so on.

I remember that infinite products can sometimes be evaluated by recognizing a pattern or using a known formula. One thing that comes to mind is the formula for the product of terms of the form (1 + x^{2^k}) which might relate to a geometric series or maybe a telescoping product.

Wait, I think there's a product formula that relates to binary representations or something like that. Let me try expanding the product for the first few terms and see if I can spot a pattern.

Starting with n=0:
Term 0: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
Term 1: 1 + 1/4 = 5/4 = 1.25
Term 2: 1 + 1/16 = 17/16 ≈1.0625
Term 3: 1 + 1/256 ≈1.00390625
And so on.

Multiplying these together: 1.5 * 1.25 = 1.875. Then 1.875 * 1.0625 ≈2.0. Hmm, interesting. Let me check the next term: 2.0 * 1.00390625 ≈2.0078125. Then the next term would be 1 + 1/(2^16) which is 1 + 1/65536 ≈1.000015258789. Multiplying that in: 2.0078125 * 1.000015258789 ≈2.00782890625. So it's approaching something around 2.0078... but wait, the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Another approach: I remember that the infinite product ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + x^{2^n}) = 1/(1 - x) when |x| < 1. Is that right? Let me test that with a simple case. If x = 1/2, then the product becomes ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + (1/2)^{2^n}) which is exactly what we have here. So according to that formula, the product would be 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2. Oh! So the value is 2.0.

Wait, but when I multiplied the first few terms, I got up to around 2.0078, which is a bit more than 2. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check the formula again. The product ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + x^{2^n}) = 1/(1 - x) for |x| < 1. Yes, that seems correct. So substituting x = 1/2, we get 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2. So the product should converge to 2.

But wait, when I calculated the partial product up to n=3, I got approximately 2.0078, which is a bit higher than 2. Maybe I need to consider more terms. Let me compute a few more terms to see where it converges.

Term 4: 1 + 1/(2^32) ≈1 + 1/4294967296 ≈1.0000002328. Multiplying it in: 2.00782890625 * 1.0000002328 ≈2.00782913847. So it's still approaching 2, but very slowly.

But wait, if the formula says it's 2, then the product should approach 2 as n approaches infinity. So maybe the initial terms are just approaching 2 from above, but the limit is exactly 2.

So looking back at the options, option B is 2.0. That must be the correct answer.

The infinite product ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + (1/2)^{2^n}) can be evaluated using the formula for the product of terms of the form (1 + x^{2^n}), which equals 1/(1 - x) for |x| < 1. Substituting x = 1/2, the product converges to 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2.0.

Answer: B
