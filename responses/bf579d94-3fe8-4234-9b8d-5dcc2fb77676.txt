Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Zero Population Growth, or ZPG. I remember from my biology class that ZPG has something to do with population stabilization. Let me think about what each option means.

The question is asking when ZPG is achieved. I recall that ZPG occurs when the population isn't growing or declining anymore. That means the number of births should balance the number of deaths, right? But wait, I also remember that migration can affect population growth. So, if immigration and emigration are factors, they would add or subtract from the population.

Looking at the options:

A: Replacement fertility is achieved. Hmm, replacement fertility is when the birth rate is just enough to replace the people who have died. I think that's related but maybe not exactly ZPG because it doesn't account for migration.

B: Population decreases then increases. That sounds more like a fluctuation, maybe a cycle, but not necessarily ZPG.

C: Total fertility equals 2. I'm not sure about this. I think total fertility rate is the average number of children per woman. Replacement level is around 2 in many cases, but if ZPG requires birth rate equals death rate, this might not be the exact condition.

D: Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration. This sounds right. If births equal deaths and there's no migration, then the population wouldn't change—so that's ZPG.

E: Birth rate less than death rate. That would mean the population is decreasing, so not ZPG.

F: CBR minus CDR equals 2. I'm not sure what CBR and CDR stand for. Oh, CBR is crude birth rate and CDR is crude death rate. If their difference is 2, that would mean a positive growth, so not ZPG.

G: Total fertility equals 3. If it's higher than replacement, that would lead to population growth, so not ZPG.

H: Birth rate is twice the death rate. That's a positive growth, so no.

I: Births plus immigration equal deaths plus emigration. Wait, if births plus immigration equal deaths plus emigration, that would mean the population isn't changing because the inflow equals the outflow. But does that count as ZPG? I'm a bit confused. Because in ZPG, usually, we talk about births and deaths without considering migration. So if migration is part of the equation, then including it would still be a form of ZPG because the population isn't changing. So option I might also be correct.

Wait, but the question says "when ZPG is achieved." I think traditionally, ZPG refers to when birth rate equals death rate, regardless of migration. But some definitions might include migration. Let me think again.

Option D says birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration. That would mean no migration is considered, so if there's migration, it's not part of this condition. But option I includes migration, so in that case, even with migration, the population remains stable, which is also a form of ZPG.

So which one is correct? The question is, I think, looking for the basic condition where births equal deaths, regardless of migration. So D might be the answer. But I'm not entirely sure because some sources say that ZPG can also account for migration, meaning the total growth rate is zero when births + immigration = deaths + emigration.

Wait, the question is phrased as "when ZPG is achieved." So according to the definition, ZPG occurs when the population growth rate is zero. Population growth rate is calculated as (births + immigration) minus (deaths + emigration). So for the growth rate to be zero, births plus immigration must equal deaths plus emigration. That would make option I correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, I is written as "Births 1 immigration 5 deaths 1 emigration." I think the "1" is a typo and should be a plus sign. So I is saying births plus immigration equals deaths plus emigration. That would make the population growth zero, so that's ZPG.

But option D says birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration. So in that case, if there's no migration, then yes, that's ZPG. But if migration is happening, then D wouldn't account for it, and the population might still be changing because of migration.

So the correct answer depends on whether the question includes migration. From what I remember, ZPG generally refers to the balance between births and deaths, but some definitions include migration. However, the more precise definition is that ZPG occurs when the population growth rate is zero, which includes all factors—births, deaths, immigration, and emigration.

Therefore, the correct answer should be I: Births plus immigration equal deaths plus emigration.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me double-check. The standard formula for population growth is:

Population change = (Births - Deaths) + (Immigration - Emigration).

For ZPG, Population change must be zero. So:

Births - Deaths + Immigration - Emigration = 0.

Which can be rearranged as Births + Immigration = Deaths + Emigration.

So yes, option I is correct because it's saying Births + Immigration = Deaths + Emigration.

But wait, looking back at the options, option I is written as "Births 1 immigration 5 deaths 1 emigration." So I think the "1" is a typo for a plus sign. So option I is correct.

But earlier, I thought option D was correct. So which is it? The question is a bit ambiguous, but I think the correct answer is I, because it's considering all factors that affect population growth.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D says "Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration." So in that case, if there's no migration, then births equal deaths, leading to zero growth. But if there is migration, then it's not part of this condition. So D is a subset of the full condition, which is I.

So the full condition for ZPG is I, not D. Therefore, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I: Births plus immigration equal deaths plus emigration. This ensures that the population growth rate is zero by balancing all factors affecting population change.
