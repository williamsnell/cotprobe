Question:

At the National Air Races in Reno, Nevada, the planes fly a course around a series of pylons. In a turn around a pylon, the maximum centripetal acceleration that the pilot can withstand is about 6g. For a plane traveling at 150 m/s, what is the turning radius for an acceleration of 6g?

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a plane at the National Air Races in Reno. The question is about finding the turning radius when the pilot can withstand a maximum centripetal acceleration of 6g. The plane's speed is given as 150 m/s, and I need to choose the correct answer from the options A to J.

Hmm, I remember that centripetal acceleration is the acceleration needed for circular motion. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a_c = v² / r, where a_c is the centripetal acceleration, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of the turn. So I think I can use this formula to solve for the radius.

Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. Yeah, I think it's a_c = v² / r. So we're given a_c as 6g. Oh right, g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s². So 6g would be 6 times that, which is about 58.8 m/s².

So, plugging in the numbers. The plane's speed is 150 m/s, and the acceleration is 58.8 m/s². I need to solve for r. Rearranging the formula, r = v² / a_c.

Let me calculate that. First, square the velocity: 150^2 is 22500. Then divide that by the acceleration, which is 58.8. So 22500 divided by 58.8. Let me do this step by step.

Calculating 22500 ÷ 58.8. Well, 58.8 goes into 22500 how many times? Let me think. 58.8 times 382 is approximately 22485.6, which is close to 22500. So maybe around 382 meters. Wait, but let me check that again.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me do 22500 ÷ 58.8. Hmm, 58.8 times 383 is 58.8 * 380 = 22,344. Then 58.8 *3 = 176.4, so 22,344 +176.4=22,520.4. Oh, that's a bit more than 22500. So 383 would give us about 22,520, which is slightly over. So maybe the exact value is a bit less than 383.

Wait, maybe using a calculator approach. Let's see, 58.8 times 382 is 58.8 * (380 + 2). 58.8 *380 = 58.8 * 38 *10. 58.8 *38: let's calculate that. 58 *38 is 2204, and 0.8 *38 is 30.4, so total 2204 +30.4=2234.4. Multiply by 10, that's 22344. Then 58.8*2=117.6. So 22344 +117.6=22461.6. So 58.8*382=22461.6. But 22500 is 38.4 more. So it's 382 + (38.4 /58.8). Let's see, 38.4 divided by 58.8 is approximately 0.65. So total radius is about 382.65 meters, which is roughly 382.65 m. Looking at the options, option D is 3.83 × 10^2 m, which is 383 m. That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial formula. Centripetal acceleration is indeed v squared over r. So r = v²/(a_c). Yep, that's correct. So all the steps seem right. So the answer should be around 383 meters, which is option D.

I think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.

To find the turning radius, use the centripetal acceleration formula \( a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} \). Rearranging for \( r \), we get \( r = \frac{v^2}{a_c} \). Given \( v = 150 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( a_c = 6g = 6 \times 9.8 = 58.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), calculate:

\[
r = \frac{150^2}{58.8} = \frac{22500}{58.8} \approx 383 \, \text{m}.
\]

The closest option is D: \( 3.83 \times 10^2 \, \text{m} \).
