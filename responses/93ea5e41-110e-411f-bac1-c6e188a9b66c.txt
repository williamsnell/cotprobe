Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the fraction of a cube that's floating above a fluid. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the cube is solid plastic with uniform density. The side length is 0.5 meters, and its mass is 100 kg. The fluid it's placed in has a density of 1200 kg/m³. I'm supposed to find what fraction of the cube's volume is above the fluid's surface.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when an object floats, the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid, which in turn equals the weight of the object. So, the basic idea is that the cube will displace a certain volume of fluid whose mass is equal to the cube's mass. 

Let me jot down the given data to organize my thoughts. The cube's side is 0.5 m, so its volume is side cubed. Volume of cube, V_cube = (0.5 m)^3 = 0.125 m³. Its mass is 100 kg, so its density is mass over volume, which would be density_cube = 100 kg / 0.125 m³. Let me calculate that: 100 divided by 0.125 is 800 kg/m³. So the cube's density is 800 kg/m³.

The fluid's density is given as 1200 kg/m³. Wait, the fluid is denser than the cube. Because 1200 is higher than 800. So that means the cube will float with some part above the fluid. Since the cube is less dense, it will displace its own mass in fluid, but since the fluid is denser, the submerged volume will be less than the cube's total volume.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cube's density is 800, fluid is 1200. So the cube is less dense than the fluid, so it will float, right? So the fraction submerged would be the cube's density divided by the fluid's density. Because when an object floats, the ratio is density_object / density_fluid. So the volume submerged, V_submerged = V_total * (density_cube / density_fluid).

So, plugging in the numbers: V_submerged = 0.125 m³ * (800 / 1200). Let me calculate that. 800 divided by 1200 is 2/3. So V_submerged = 0.125 * (2/3) = 0.083333... m³. 

Wait, but wait, that's the submerged volume. The question asks for the fraction above the fluid. So the fraction above would be 1 minus the submerged fraction. The submerged fraction is (2/3), so fraction above is 1 - (2/3) = 1/3. So the fraction above is 1/3, which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it using the mass and the buoyant force. The cube's mass is 100 kg, so its weight is 100 kg * g. The buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid, which is density_fluid * V_submerged * g. Setting these equal because the object floats: 100 kg * g = 1200 kg/m³ * V_submerged * g. The g's cancel out, so 100 = 1200 * V_submerged. Solving for V_submerged, V_submerged = 100 / 1200 = 1/12 m³. 

Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Oh no, did I make a mistake? Let's see. Because earlier I used 0.125 * (800/1200) which is (0.125 * 800)/1200 = (100)/1200 = 1/12 m³. Oh, right, that's the same. So my initial calculation was correct. So V_submerged is 1/12 m³. 

The total volume of the cube is 0.125 m³, which is 1/8 m³. Wait, 0.5^3 is 0.125, which is 1/8. So V_submerged is 1/12 m³. So the fraction submerged is (1/12) / (1/8) = (1/12) * (8/1) = 8/12 = 2/3. So submerged fraction is 2/3, so the fraction above is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

So the answer should be H: 1.0/3. But wait, let me check the options. Looking at the options: option H is 1/3, that's correct. So option H is the answer.

The cube has a volume of \( V_{\text{cube}} = (0.5)^3 = 0.125 \, \text{m}^3 \) and a mass of \( 100 \, \text{kg} \), giving it a density of \( \rho_{\text{cube}} = \frac{100}{0.125} = 800 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \). The fluid has a density of \( \rho_{\text{fluid}} = 1200 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \). Since the cube's density is less than the fluid's, it floats, displacing a volume of fluid equal to its own mass.

The buoyant force equals the cube's weight, so:

\[
100 \, \text{kg} \cdot g = \rho_{\text{fluid}} \cdot V_{\text{submerged}} \cdot g
\]

Canceling \( g \) and solving for \( V_{\text{submerged}} \):

\[
V_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{100}{1200} = \frac{1}{12} \, \text{m}^3
\]

The fraction of the cube's volume submerged is:

\[
\frac{V_{\text{submerged}}}{V_{\text{cube}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{12}}{\frac{1}{8}} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus, the fraction of the cube's volume above the fluid is:

\[
1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

The correct answer is:

H
