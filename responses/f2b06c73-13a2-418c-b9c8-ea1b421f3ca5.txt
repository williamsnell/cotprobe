Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Rayleigh scattering and the ratio of intensities for two hydrogen lines. Hmm, I remember Rayleigh scattering has something to do with how light scatters off small particles, right? The formula for the intensity ratio comes to mind. I think the intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4) because Rayleigh scattering depends on the inverse fourth power of wavelength. Oh wait, yes, the Rayleigh scattering intensity I is proportional to 1/λ^4. So if I have two wavelengths, the ratio of their intensities would be the inverse of the ratio of their wavelengths to the fourth power.

So the problem gives me two wavelengths: λ₁ is 410 nm and λ₂ is 656 nm. I need to find the ratio I₁/I₂. Since I₁ is for λ₁ and I₂ for λ₂, according to the formula, I₁/I₂ = (λ₂/λ₁)^4.

Let me plug in the numbers. λ₂ is 656 nm, and λ₁ is 410 nm. So first, I'll compute λ₂ divided by λ₁. Let me do that division: 656 divided by 410. Let me calculate that. 656 / 410 ≈ 1.60. Wait, 410 times 1.6 is 656, because 400*1.6=640 and 10*1.6=16, so 640+16=656. Yep, so that gives 1.6 exactly.

Now, I need to raise this ratio to the fourth power. So (1.6)^4. Let me compute that. 1.6 squared is 2.56. Then squared again: 2.56 squared. Hmm, what's 2.56 times 2.56? Let's see, 2 times 2 is 4, but let's calculate it properly. 

Breaking it down: 2.56 * 2.56. Let me do it step by step. 2 * 2 is 4, 2 * 0.56 is 1.12; 0.56 * 2 is another 1.12; 0.56 * 0.56 is 0.3136. Wait, that approach might not be the easiest. Alternatively, 2.56 * 2 = 5.12, so 2.56 * 2.56 is (2.56)^2. Alternatively, I can compute 2.5^2 + some more. 2.5^2 is 6.25, and then the 0.06 part.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to multiply 2.56 by 2.56 directly:

2.56
×2.56
--------
First, multiply 2.56 by 6 (hundredths place): 2.56 * 6 = 15.36 → write down 36 and carry over 15.
Then, multiply 2.56 by 5 (tenths place), shifted one position: 2.56 *5 =12.8, add the carried 15? Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, when multiplying, it's:

Let me write it properly:

      2.56
    × 2.56
    --------
      (2.56 × 6) = 15.36 → write as 15.36
    (2.56 ×50) = 128 → but shifted one position: 128.0
    (2.56 ×200) = 512 → shifted two positions: 512.00
    -----------------
    Add them up:
    15.36
  +128.0 (which is 1280 tenths)
  +512.00 (which is 51200 hundredths)
Wait, maybe I should think differently. Wait, 2.56 × 2.56 is better done as (2 + 0.56)^2. Hmm, but that's for squaring, not multiplying two different numbers.

Wait, perhaps a calculator approach isn't the way, but alternatively, I can compute 2.56 * 2.56 = (2.5 + 0.06)^2 = 2.5^2 + 2*2.5*0.06 + 0.06^2 = 6.25 + 0.3 + 0.0036 = 6.5536. Oh right! So 2.56 squared is 6.5536. So (1.6)^4 is (1.6^2)^2 = (2.56)^2 = 6.5536.

So the intensity ratio I₁/I₂ is 6.5536. Wait, wait, no: Wait, intensity is proportional to 1/λ^4, so I₁ is for λ₁, so I₁ = k / λ₁^4, I₂ = k / λ₂^4. So I₁/I₂ = (λ₂/λ₁)^4. Because I₁ is proportional to 1/λ₁^4, and I₂ is 1/λ₂^4. So I₁/I₂ = (λ₂/λ₁)^4. So in this case, (656/410)^4 ≈ (1.6)^4 = 6.5536.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 6.55:1. So I think that's the answer. But let me double-check my steps because sometimes I get confused with the ratios.

Wait, if I₁ corresponds to λ₁, then the ratio I₁/I₂ is (λ₂/λ₁)^4. Because I is proportional to 1/λ^4, so I₁/I₂ = (1/λ₁^4) / (1/λ₂^4) ) = (λ₂/λ₁)^4. Yes, that's correct. So 656/410 is 1.6, and 1.6^4 is 6.5536, which is approximately 6.55:1. So looking at the options, that's option J.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the ratio of intensities for the two hydrogen lines. So if it's I₁ over I₂, then yes, it's (λ₂/λ₁)^4, which is 6.55:1. So option J is 6.55:1.

Alternatively, maybe I have the ratio reversed. Let me confirm: for Rayleigh scattering, the intensity is I = (something) * (λ_0^4)/(λ^4), where λ_0 is the wavelength in a vacuum. Wait, no, more accurately, the intensity goes as 1/λ^4. So a shorter wavelength scatters more intensely. So λ₁ is 410 nm, which is shorter than λ₂ (656 nm). So I₁ should be higher than I₂, so the ratio I₁/I₂ is greater than 1. Which aligns with our calculation of 6.55:1.

Wait, but the options don't have 6.55:1 as option J. Wait, looking back: the options are A:4.23:1, B:10.24:1,... J:6.55:1. Yes, option J is 6.55:1, which matches our calculation.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the Rayleigh scattering formula is written as I proportional to λ^4, but wait no, I think it's inversely proportional. Because the cross-section is proportional to (λ^2)/(k^4), where k is the wavevector, which is 2π/λ. So the cross-section goes as λ^2 * (λ^4)/(2π)^4), so overall, cross-section proportional to 1/λ^4. So yes, intensity is proportional to 1/λ^4.

So yes, I think I'm confident the ratio is 6.55:1, which is option J.
</think>

The ratio of intensities for Rayleigh scattering is given by \( I_1/I_2 = (\lambda_2/\lambda_1)^4 \), where \( \lambda_1 = 410 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_2 = 656 \, \text{nm} \). Calculating \( \lambda_2/\lambda_1 \) gives \( 656/410 = 1.6 \). Raising this ratio to the fourth power yields \( (1.6)^4 = 6.5536 \), which approximates to \( 6.55:1 \). This corresponds to option J.
