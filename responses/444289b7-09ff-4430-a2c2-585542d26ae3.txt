Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the annual interest rate for a radio purchased on installment. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the radio costs $39.90. The installment plan requires a down payment of $5.00 and then $3.10 per month for a year. I need to find the annual interest rate here. Hmm, I think this is related to simple interest or maybe something else.

First, let me understand the total amount paid. The down payment is $5, and then each month for a year, it's $3.10. So, 12 months times $3.10 is... let me calculate that. 12 * 3.10 = $37.20. So total payments would be the down payment plus the monthly payments: $5 + $37.20 = $42.20.

Wait, but the radio is $39.90, so the extra amount paid is $42.20 - $39.90 = $2.30. This extra $2.30 is the interest over the year. 

Now, to find the interest rate, I think I should use the formula: Interest Rate = (Interest / Principal) * 100. The principal here is the amount financed, which is the purchase price minus the down payment. So principal = $39.90 - $5 = $34.90.

So the interest is $2.30, principal is $34.90. Plugging into the formula: (2.30 / 34.90) * 100. Let me compute that. 

2.30 divided by 34.90... Let me see, 2.3 / 34.9 ≈ 0.066. Multiply by 100 gives about 6.6%. But wait, that doesn't match any of the options given. The options are 14%, 17.5%, etc. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, maybe I'm not considering the right principal. Because the down payment is made upfront, so the amount that's being financed is $34.90. But maybe the interest is calculated on the initial amount, which is $39.90. Let me try that. 

If principal is $39.90, then interest is $2.30. So 2.30 / 39.90 ≈ 0.0576, which is about 5.76%. Still not matching the options. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an installment plan where each payment includes both principal and interest, and the interest is calculated on the remaining balance each month. That might be more complicated, like an amortizing loan. But I'm not sure how to calculate that exactly.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of simple interest. The total interest paid is $2.30 over a year. So if I take that $2.30 and divide by the average amount owed, perhaps. The average amount owed would be the average of the initial principal and the final principal after payments.

Wait, the initial principal after down payment is $34.90, and after a year, it's zero, because you pay it all off. So the average principal is (34.90 + 0)/2 = 17.45. Then the interest rate would be (2.30 / 17.45) * 100 ≈ 13.18%, which is close to 14%. So option A is 14%.

Wait, but the average method might not be the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I should use the simple interest formula I = P * r * t, where I is interest, P principal, r rate, t time. Here, t is 1 year. So rearranged, r = I/(P*t). 

If P is the amount financed, which is $34.90, then r = 2.30 / 34.90 ≈ 0.066, so 6.6%. But that's not one of the higher options. Alternatively, if I consider the total amount paid as $42.20, and the purchase price is $39.90, then the interest is $2.30. But if I use the original price as the principal, that's 2.30 /39.90 ≈ 5.76%. 

Wait, maybe I'm not accounting for the fact that the down payment is part of the principal reduction. So the first payment of $3.10 includes part principal and part interest. Maybe each payment is applied to the principal first, then the interest. But calculating each month's interest would be more complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the total amount paid as $42.20 for a $39.90 item, so the interest is $2.30. To find the effective annual rate, we can use the formula:

Effective Annual Rate (EAR) = (Interest / Principal) * 100.

But again, what's the principal here? If the principal is the amount financed, which is $34.90, then EAR is (2.30 /34.90)*100 ≈ 6.6%, but that's not an option. 

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) using the simple interest method. The total interest is $2.30, and the principal is $34.90. So APR is (2.30 /34.90)*100 ≈6.6%, but maybe the options have a different approach.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total interest. Let me double-check the total payments. Down payment is $5, then 12 monthly payments of $3.10. So 12 *3.10=37.20. Total paid is 5 +37.20=42.20. The cost of the radio is 39.90, so the extra is 42.20-39.90=2.30. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest rate is calculated based on the total amount paid, not the financed amount. So 2.30 divided by 39.90 is about 5.76%. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the down payment reduces the principal, so the average principal is (39.90 -5)/2 =17.45. Then 2.30 /17.45≈13.18%, which is close to 14%. So option A is 14%.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct method. Alternatively, perhaps using the simple interest formula where the interest is 2.30, principal is 34.90, so rate is 6.6%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the simple interest method but considering the total amount. Let me see: the total amount paid is $42.20, which includes the principal $39.90 and interest $2.30. So the interest is 2.30 over 39.90, which is about 5.76%. But again, not matching the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try another approach. The installment plan is $3.10 a month for 12 months, plus a $5 down payment. So the total amount paid is 5 + 3.10*12 =5+37.20=42.20. The purchase price is 39.90, so the interest is 2.30. 

To find the annual interest rate, I think it's the simple interest rate on the amount financed, which is 39.90 -5=34.90. So interest is 2.30, principal 34.90. So rate is 2.30 /34.90= ~6.6%, which is not an option.

Wait, but perhaps the interest is compounded monthly. If that's the case, the effective annual rate would be different. Let me think. If each month's payment includes interest, perhaps it's more complex. But without knowing the exact method, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated on the initial amount each month. So each month, you pay $3.10, part of which is interest. Let's see: initial principal is $34.90. Let's say the monthly interest rate is r. Then each month, the interest is 34.90 * r, and the principal paid is 3.10 - interest. But this would require solving for r, which might be complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the total interest as 2.30 over the year, so the rate is 2.30 / (average principal). The average principal would be (34.90 + 0)/2 =17.45. So 2.30 /17.45≈0.1318, or 13.18%. That's close to 14%, so option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe I should use the APR formula which is (total interest * 12) / (average of the initial and final balance). So (2.30 *12)/ (34.90 +0)/2 = (27.6)/17.45≈1.583, which would be 158.3%, which is way too high and not an option. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another way. The total amount paid is $42.20 for a radio that costs $39.90. So the interest is $2.30. So the interest rate is 2.30 / (39.90) *100 ≈5.76%. But that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total amount financed, which is $34.90, and the total interest is $2.30. So the rate is 2.30 /34.90 = ~6.6%, but that's not an option. Maybe the correct answer isn't listed, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the APR using the simple interest formula correctly. The APR is (total interest) / (average balance during the period) * 100. The average balance is (initial balance + final balance)/2. Here, initial balance is $34.90, and final balance is $0, so average is $17.45. So APR is 2.30 /17.45 ≈13.18%, which rounds to about 13.2%, but the closest option is 14% (option A) or 12.2% (option I). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as the interest per period times the number of periods. If each payment is $3.10, and the principal is $34.90, then the interest rate per month is (3.10 - (34.90/12)) / (34.90 - (3.10 - interest)). Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should use the simple interest formula where the interest is equal to principal times rate times time. So I = P * r * t. Here, I=2.30, P=34.90, t=1. So r = I/(P*t)=2.30/(34.90*1)= ~0.066 or 6.6%. But again, not matching the options.

I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the APR based on the total interest and the average principal. So 2.30 / (34.90/2) =2.30 /17.45≈0.1318 or 13.18%, which would be approximately 13.2%. The closest option is I:12.2% or A:14%. Since 13.18 is closer to 13.2, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I should recalculate the interest.

Wait, perhaps the total interest is miscalculated. Let me check: total payments are $5 +12*$3.10=5+37.20=42.20. Radio cost is 39.90, so interest is 42.20 -39.90=2.30. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated on the original amount each month, so each month you pay $3.10, which includes interest on the remaining balance. Let's try to model this. The initial principal is $34.90. Each month, you pay $3.10, which is part principal and part interest. Let's assume the interest rate is i per month. So each month, the interest is principal * i, and the principal paid is $3.10 - interest. This seems like an amortization schedule.

Let me try to set up the equation. After each payment, the principal reduces. For a one-year plan, this would require solving for i such that the sum of the present values of the monthly payments equals the principal.

The formula for the present value of an annuity is: PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + i)^-n ] / i.

Here, PV is the principal, which is $34.90. PMT is $3.10, n=12. So:

34.90 = 3.10 * [1 - (1 + i)^-12 ] / i.

This equation needs to be solved for i, which is the monthly interest rate. Then, the annual rate would be 12i (if simple) or (1+i)^12 -1 (if compounded).

But solving this equation for i is not straightforward without a calculator. Maybe I can estimate.

Let me try i=0.01 (1% per month). Then, denominator is 0.01.

[1 - (1.01)^-12 ] / 0.01 ≈ [1 - 0.8874] /0.01 ≈0.1126 /0.01=11.26.

So 3.10 *11.26≈34.906, which is very close to 34.90. So i≈1% per month. Therefore, the monthly rate is about 1%, so the annual rate would be 12% (simple) or (1.01)^12 -1≈12.68%. 

Looking at the options, 12.2% is option I, and 14% is option A. So if it's 12.68%, the closest option is I:12.2%. Alternatively, maybe it's 12% simple interest.

Wait, but in the calculation, 3.10 *11.26≈34.906, which is almost exactly the principal. So i≈1% per month, leading to an annual rate of 12% (simple) or about 12.68% (compound). Since 12.2% is an option, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the average principal method gave about 13.18%, which would suggest 14% as the closest option. But with the annuity calculation, it's closer to 12.2%. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is simple, so 1% per month, 12% per year. So the answer would be 12%, but that's not an option. The closest is I:12.2%. So maybe the correct answer is I.

But I'm getting conflicting results from different methods. The first method using average principal gave ~13.18%, the annuity method gave ~12.68%, which is closer to 12.2%. Maybe the intended answer is I:12.2%. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the problem says "annual interest rate", so maybe they're expecting a simple interest calculation. So with total interest $2.30, principal $34.90, rate is (2.30/34.90)*100≈6.6%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, using the total amount paid, it's 2.30/39.90≈5.76%, which is also not an option.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me see the options again: A is 14%, I is12.2%. From the annuity calculation, it's about 12.68%, which is closer to 12.2% than to 14%. So perhaps the answer is I:12.2%.

Wait, but when I did the PV of annuity calculation, i was approximately 1% per month, leading to an EAR of about 12.68%, which is closer to 12.2% than 14%. So I think the answer is I:12.2%.

To determine the annual interest rate for the installment purchase, we first calculate the total amount paid and the total interest. The radio costs $39.90, with a $5.00 down payment and $3.10 monthly payments for a year. The total payments are:

\[
\text{Total Payments} = \$5.00 + 12 \times \$3.10 = \$5.00 + \$37.20 = \$42.20
\]

The total interest paid is:

\[
\text{Total Interest} = \$42.20 - \$39.90 = \$2.30
\]

The amount financed (principal) is:

\[
\text{Principal} = \$39.90 - \$5.00 = \$34.90
\]

Using the simple interest formula:

\[
\text{Interest Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Interest}}{\text{Principal}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$2.30}{\$34.90} \right) \times 100 \approx 6.6\%
\]

However, this result does not match the provided options. Considering the effective annual rate (EAR) using the annuity formula for installment payments:

\[
\text{PV} = \text{PMT} \times \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i}
\]

Where:
- \( \text{PV} = \$34.90 \) (principal),
- \( \text{PMT} = \$3.10 \) (monthly payment),
- \( n = 12 \) (months).

Solving for \( i \) (monthly interest rate) and then converting to an annual rate, we find the EAR is approximately 12.68%. The closest option to this value is **12.2%**.

Thus, the annual interest rate for the installment purchase is:

**I: 12.2%**
