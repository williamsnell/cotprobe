Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about calculating the change in entropy when mixing two quantities of water at different temperatures. Specifically, we're mixing 100 grams of water at 0°C with 50 grams of water at 50°C. The options are given in cal/K/deg, which I think is calories per Kelvin per degree, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's calories per Kelvin, since entropy is usually in J/K or cal/K. Wait, actually, cal/K/deg might be a typo or misunderstanding. Oh well, I'll proceed and see.

I remember that entropy change, ΔS, for mixing two substances can be calculated using the formula for each part and then adding them together. The formula for the entropy change when heating a substance from an initial temperature T1 to a final temperature T2 is ΔS = m * c * ln(T2/T1), where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and T is in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait. When you mix two substances at different temperatures, the heat will flow from the hotter to the cooler until they reach thermal equilibrium. So the entropy change of the system is the sum of the entropy changes of each part as they reach the equilibrium temperature.

So first, I need to find the final temperature after mixing. Since water has a specific heat capacity (c) of 1 cal/(g·°C), I think. Because I remember that 1 gram of water requires 1 calorie to raise its temperature by 1°C. So c = 1 cal/(g·°C).

So, the heat lost by the hotter water (50g at 50°C) will equal the heat gained by the cooler water (100g at 0°C). The formula is:

m1 * c * (T_final - T_initial1) = m2 * c * (T_final - T_initial2)

Wait, but wait. The hotter water will lose heat, so the equation is:

m1 * c * (T_initial1 - T_final) = m2 * c * (T_final - T_initial2)

Yes, because m1 is losing heat, and m2 is gaining heat.

Plugging in the numbers:

m1 = 50g, T_initial1 = 50°C
m2 = 100g, T_initial2 = 0°C

So,

50 * 1 * (50 - T_final) = 100 * 1 * (T_final - 0)
50*(50 - Tf) = 100*Tf

Expanding:

2500 - 50Tf = 100 Tf

2500 = 150 Tf

Tf = 2500 / 150 ≈ 16.6667°C. Hmm, that's about 16.67°C.

Now, I need to calculate the entropy change for each mass as they go from their initial temperature to the final temperature.

Entropy change formula is ΔS = m * c * ln(T_final/T_initial), but wait, because we're dealing with temperature in Kelvin. So I should convert all temperatures to Kelvin.

T_initial1 = 50°C = 323.15 K
T_initial2 = 0°C = 273.15 K
T_final = 16.6667°C = 290.15 K approximately.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 0°C is 273.15 K, 50°C is 323.15 K, and 16.6667°C is 273.15 + 16.6667 ≈ 289.8167 K, which I can approximate as 289.82 K for calculation purposes.

So for the 50g of water cooling from 323.15 K to 289.82 K:

ΔS1 = m1 * c * ln(Tf / T_initial1)
But wait, wait—no, wait. When a substance cools, it's losing heat, so the entropy change is negative because the system is losing heat. But wait, the entropy change of the universe is the sum of both parts. Alternatively, since we're considering the mixing, it's the sum of the entropy changes of both parts, which may be positive or negative depending on the direction.

Wait no, let's think again. The formula for entropy change when heating is m c ln(T2/T1). So for the hotter water cooling, T2 < T1, so ln(T2/T1) is negative, so ΔS would be negative. For the cooler water heating up, T2 > T1, so ΔS is positive.

So let me compute each part.

First, for the 50g of water cooling from 323.15 K to 289.82 K:

ΔS1 = 50 g * 1 cal/(g·K) * ln(289.82 / 323.15)

Wait, wait, no. Because the specific heat capacity in calories is 1 cal/(g·°C), but when using the formula with Kelvin, it's the same because the difference in Celsius is the same as Kelvin. So ln uses absolute temperatures, so it's correct.

So let's compute ln(289.82 / 323.15). Let me compute 289.82 / 323.15 ≈ 0.8966.

ln(0.8966) ≈ -0.1085.

So ΔS1 = 50 * 1 * (-0.1085) ≈ -5.425 cal/K.

Then for the 100g of water heating from 273.15 K to 289.82 K:

ΔS2 = 100 g * 1 cal/(g·K) * ln(289.82 / 273.15)

Compute 289.82 / 273.15 ≈ 1.061.

ln(1.061) ≈ 0.0593.

So ΔS2 = 100 * 1 * 0.0593 ≈ 5.93 cal/K.

Now, the total entropy change of the system is ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = (-5.425) + 5.93 ≈ 0.505 cal/K.

Wait, but wait a second. The units in the options are cal/K/deg, but I'm getting cal/K. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the units? Let me check the problem statement again.

The question is about the change of entropy on mixing, and the options are in cal/K/deg. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Typically, entropy is in J/K or cal/K. Perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the entropy change per degree, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps the question is intended to be in cal/(g·K), but the way it's written is a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the question is in cal/(g·K) because the options are in cal/K/deg, but wait, that's not a standard unit. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as I did and see which option matches.

Wait, my calculation gave me about 0.505 cal/K, which would correspond to option B: 0.5 cal/K/deg. But wait, the options have cal/K/deg, which is calories per Kelvin per degree. I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is expecting the entropy change per gram or something else. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because the entropy change for mixing is calculated as the sum of each mass's entropy change. Wait, but I think I did it correctly.

Wait, the problem is about the change in entropy of the surroundings plus the system, but since we're mixing two parts, the entropy change is just the sum of both.

Wait, another approach: The total entropy change is the sum of the entropy changes of each part.

So, as I calculated, ΔS1 (cooling) is about -5.425 cal/K, and ΔS2 (heating) is about +5.93 cal/K, so total is 0.505 cal/K.

But the options are given in cal/K/deg, which doesn't make sense to me. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the entropy change per degree of temperature change.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy change per degree for each part and then sum them.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use specific entropy, i.e., per gram.

Wait, let me recompute using per gram basis.

Wait, the 50g of water cooling from 50°C to 16.67°C.

The entropy change per gram would be ΔS = c * ln(Tf/Ti)

So per gram, it's 1 cal/(g·K) * ln(289.82/323.15) ≈ 1 * (-0.1085) ≈ -0.1085 cal/(g·K)

Multiply by 50g: 50 * (-0.1085) ≈ -5.425 cal/K.

Similarly, for the 100g heating from 0°C to 16.67°C:

Per gram, ΔS = 1 * ln(289.82/273.15) ≈ 0.0593 cal/(g·K)

Multiply by 100g: 100 * 0.0593 ≈ 5.93 cal/K.

Total ΔS = (-5.425) + 5.93 ≈ 0.505 cal/K.

So the total entropy change is approximately 0.505 cal/K, which is about 0.5 cal/K. Looking at the options, option B is 0.5 cal/K/deg, but that doesn't fit the units I have. Wait, maybe the options have a typo, and it's supposed to be cal/K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the entropy change per degree of temperature change. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the question is asking for the change in entropy per degree of mixing. That sounds odd, though.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the mixing entropy, but I think that's not the case here because the problem is about thermal mixing, not mixing two different substances which would involve a different calculation, like using the formula with the natural log of the ratio of masses or something else.

Wait, but in this case, it's the same substance, water, so the entropy change is just the sum of each part's entropy change as they reach equilibrium.

So, back to the calculation. I think the correct total entropy change is approximately 0.505 cal/K, which is about 0.5 cal/K. So that would correspond to option B: 0.5 cal/K/deg, but that unit still doesn't make sense to me. Unless the 'deg' is a mistake, and it's supposed to be cal/K.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are written in a confusing way. Let's look again:

Options:

A: 0.8 cal/K/deg

B: 0.5 cal/K/deg

C: 0.3 cal/K/deg

D: 0.2 cal/K/deg

E: 0.1 cal/K/deg

F: 0.7 cal/K/deg

G: 0.6 cal/K/deg

H: 1.5 cal/K/deg

I: 0.9 cal/K/deg

J: 1 cal/K/deg

Wait, perhaps the 'cal/K/deg' is a misprint, and they meant cal/K, in which case option B would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should calculate the entropy change using the formula for each part, but in terms of temperature change per degree. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy change using the equation in terms of heat transfer divided by temperature.

For each part, the heat transferred is m c ΔT, and the entropy change is integral of dQ_rev / T.

So for the hotter water cooling: Q = m c (T_initial - T_final) = 50 * 1 * (50 - 16.6667) ≈ 50 * 33.3333 ≈ 1666.665 cal.

The entropy change for this part is the integral from T_initial to T_final of dQ_rev / T. Since heat is leaving, it's negative.

So, for cooling: ΔS1 = - ∫(dQ_rev / T) from T_initial to T_final.

Which is - m c ∫(dT) / T from T_initial to T_final.

Which is - m c [ln(T_final) - ln(T_initial)] = - m c ln(T_final / T_initial).

Which is the same as before: 50 * 1 * ln(289.82 / 323.15) ≈ -5.425 cal/K.

Similarly, for the cooler water: Q = m c (T_final - T_initial) = 100 * 1 * 16.6667 ≈ 1666.67 cal.

Entropy change: ΔS2 = m c ∫(dT / T) from T_initial to T_final = 100 * 1 * [ln(289.82) - ln(273.15)] ≈ 100 * 0.0593 ≈ 5.93 cal/K.

Total ΔS = 5.93 -5.425 ≈ 0.505 cal/K, so 0.5 cal/K approximately.

Given the options, the closest is option B: 0.5 cal/K/deg. But again, the units are confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the entropy change in cal/(g·K), but that would be 0.0505 cal/(g·K) for the total, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the entropy change per degree of temperature change. Like, how much entropy changes per degree the temperature changes. But that doesn't seem right because entropy is a state function and depends on the path, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the final temperature calculation. Let me check that again.

Equation: m1 c (T1 - Tf) = m2 c (Tf - T2)

So 50*(50 - Tf) = 100*(Tf - 0)

50*(50 - Tf) = 100*Tf

2500 -50 Tf = 100 Tf

2500 = 150 Tf

Tf = 2500 / 150 = 16.666...°C, so that's correct.

Another check: The mass ratio is 50:100, which simplifies to 1:2. The temperature change would be inversely proportional to mass, so the final temperature is closer to the larger mass's initial temperature. 100g at 0°C and 50g at 50°C. So the final temp should be between 0 and 50, and closer to 0. 16.67 is correct.

So, the entropy change is around 0.5 cal/K, which would correspond to option B if the units are indeed cal/K, but the options say cal/K/deg. Maybe it's a typo, and the intended answer is 0.5 cal/K, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using Kelvin for the temperatures correctly. Let me recalculate the ln terms.

For ΔS1: T_initial1 = 323.15 K, T_final = 289.82 K.

ln(289.82 / 323.15) = ln(0.8966) ≈ -0.1085.

So 50 * 1 * (-0.1085) = -5.425 cal/K.

For ΔS2: T_initial2 = 273.15 K, T_final = 289.82 K.

ln(289.82 / 273.15) = ln(1.061) ≈ 0.0593.

So 100 * 1 * 0.0593 ≈ 5.93 cal/K.

Total ΔS = 5.93 -5.425 ≈ 0.505 cal/K.

So, 0.5 cal/K is the correct answer, which would be option B, assuming the units are a typo and should be cal/K.

The problem involves calculating the entropy change when mixing 100 g of water at 0°C with 50 g of water at 50°C. The entropy change is determined by calculating the entropy change for each portion of water as they reach thermal equilibrium.

1. **Final Temperature Calculation**:  
   Using the principle of conservation of energy, the final temperature \( T_f \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   m_1 c (T_{\text{initial1}} - T_f) = m_2 c (T_f - T_{\text{initial2}})
   \]  
   Substituting \( m_1 = 50 \, \text{g} \), \( T_{\text{initial1}} = 50^\circ \text{C} \), \( m_2 = 100 \, \text{g} \), and \( T_{\text{initial2}} = 0^\circ \text{C} \):  
   \[
   50 \cdot 50 - 50 T_f = 100 T_f
   \]  
   Solving gives \( T_f \approx 16.67^\circ \text{C} \) or \( 290.15 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Entropy Change for Each Portion**:  
   The entropy change for each portion is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \Delta S = m c \ln\left(\frac{T_f}{T_{\text{initial}}}\right)
   \]  
   - For the 50 g of water cooling from \( 323.15 \, \text{K} \) to \( 290.15 \, \text{K} \):  
     \[
     \Delta S_1 = 50 \cdot 1 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{290.15}{323.15}\right) \approx -5.425 \, \text{cal/K}
     \]  
   - For the 100 g of water heating from \( 273.15 \, \text{K} \) to \( 290.15 \, \text{K} \):  
     \[
     \Delta S_2 = 100 \cdot 1 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{290.15}{273.15}\right) \approx 5.93 \, \text{cal/K}
     \]

3. **Total Entropy Change**:  
   The total entropy change is the sum of the entropy changes:  
   \[
   \Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_1 + \Delta S_2 \approx -5.425 + 5.93 \approx 0.505 \, \text{cal/K}
   \]  
   This value is closest to \( 0.5 \, \text{cal/K} \), assuming the units in the options are a typo and should be \( \text{cal/K} \).

**Answer**: B
