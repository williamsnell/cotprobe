Question:

Dr. Ramchandran found that his patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities in their teeth as those who didn't. After interviewing the dentist, a local newswriter reports that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. Based on the dentist's research, which of the following statements is true?

Options:

A: The writer's statement would be justified if at least half of the patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
B: If a minimum of 200 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
C: No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.
D: The writer's statement would only be justified if no patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
E: The writer's statement could only be justified if the study was conducted over a prolonged period of time.
F: At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.
G: If all the patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
I: If only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
J: If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Dr. Ramchandran's study on brushing teeth and cavities. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

The question says that Dr. Ramchandran found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities as those who didn't. A newswriter then reports that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. The question is about whether the writer's statement is justified based on the dentist's research, and there are several options to choose from.

Hmm, I think this is a question about statistics and possibly confounding variables or the representativeness of the sample. Let me break it down.

First, the study compared two groups: those who brushed after lunch and those who didn't. The brushing group had 1/20 the cavities of the non-brushing group. That's a big difference, suggesting a strong association. But does that mean brushing causes fewer cavities?

Wait, the newswriter is concluding that brushing prevents cavities. But in research, especially in medical studies, we have to be careful about causation versus correlation. Just because two things are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other. There could be other factors at play.

Now, looking at the options, they're all about conditions under which the writer's statement is justified. So the question is, under what condition is the statement "brushing after lunch prevents cavities" justified based on Dr. Ramchandran's findings?

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The writer's statement would be justified if at least half of the patients brushed their teeth after lunch. Hmm. I'm not sure. If half brushed and half didn't, and the brushing group had 1/20 the cavities, that would show an association. But does it establish causation? Maybe not necessarily. It depends on other factors like whether the study controlled for other variables.

Option B: If a minimum of 200 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified. I don't think the sample size alone justifies the causation. Even with a large sample, without proper experimental design, you can't conclude causation.

Option C: No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified. Wait, that might be a possibility. Because even with a large sample, unless it's a controlled experiment, you can't rule out other variables. So maybe this is the case.

Option D: The writer's statement would only be justified if no patients brushed their teeth after lunch. That doesn't make sense. If no one brushed, there's no data on brushing, so you can't make any conclusion about it.

Option E: The writer's statement could only be justified if the study was conducted over a prolonged period of time. Well, the study might be cross-sectional, but maybe a longer period would help establish causation. But the question doesn't mention duration, so I'm not sure.

Option F: At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified. Again, sample size isn't the key issue here. It's more about the study design.

Option G: If all the patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified. Wait, if it's a study of all patients, that's a population, not a sample. But even then, without randomization or controlling variables, you can't establish causation. So this might not be correct.

Option H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified. Similar to F and B, the sample size doesn't alone justify the conclusion.

Option I: If only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified. No, because then there's no comparison group. You need to compare brushers and non-brushers to see the effect.

Option J: If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified. Again, sample size isn't the main issue unless it's about statistical significance, but without proper design, even large samples don't prove causation.

Wait, so the key here is that the study is observational, not experimental. So even if there's a strong association, you can't conclude causation. The writer's statement is about prevention, which implies causation. Therefore, the study's design matters. If the study didn't control for other factors, like diet, sugar intake, fluoride use, etc., the association could be due to those variables instead of brushing.

So the correct answer would be that the writer's statement isn't justified regardless of the sample size because you can't establish causation from an observational study. Therefore, option C says, "No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified." That makes sense because without a controlled experiment, you can't prove that brushing causes fewer cavities; it's just an association.

The question revolves around whether the newswriter's statement that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities is justified based on Dr. Ramchandran's study. The key issue is distinguishing between correlation and causation. While the study shows a strong association (brushing after lunch reduces cavities by 1/20), it does not establish causation without a controlled experimental design. 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is that no matter the sample size, the statement isn't justified because the study doesn't rule out other variables. Thus, the answer is:

C

Answer: C
