Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about the phase transition of tin. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that solid tin can exist in two forms: gray and white. They are in equilibrium at 1 bar and 18°C. Now, I need to find the temperature at which these two phases are in equilibrium when the pressure is increased to 350 bar. 

Alright, I remember that when pressure changes, it affects the phase equilibrium. The key here is probably the Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in pressure and temperature along the phase boundary. The Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔS)/(ΔV), where ΔS is the entropy change of the transition and ΔV is the volume change.

First, I'll note down the given data:

- At equilibrium: P = 1 bar, T = 18°C (which is 291.15 K)
- Density of gray tin (Sn gray) = 5750 kg/m³
- Density of white tin (Sn white) = 7280 kg/m³
- Molar entropy of gray tin (S_gray) = 44.14 J/K/mol
- Molar entropy of white tin (S_white) = 51.18 J/K/mol

I think I'll need to calculate ΔS and ΔV for the transition from gray to white tin.

Wait, ΔS is the entropy change of the system when going from gray to white. So ΔS = S_white - S_gray = 51.18 - 44.14 = 7.04 J/K/mol. Got that.

Now for ΔV, which is the volume change per mole. Since volume is inversely proportional to density, I can calculate the molar volume for each phase and then find the difference.

First, I need the molar masses. Wait, tin has a molar mass of about 118.71 g/mol, right? Let me confirm that. Yes, atomic weight of tin is approximately 118.71 g/mol.

So, molar volume for gray tin (V_gray) is mass/volume. Wait, no, molar volume is volume per mole. So since density ρ = mass/volume, then volume per mole (Vm) = mass/(n * ρ) = Molar mass (M) / density.

Wait, wait, no, Vm = M / ρ, where M is molar mass and ρ is density. Because density is kg/m³, and molar mass is in kg/mol. So Vm would be in m³/mol.

Let me compute Vm for each phase.

Molar mass of Sn is 0.11871 kg/mol.

For gray tin:
Vm_gray = M / ρ_gray = 0.11871 kg/mol / 5750 kg/m³. Let's compute that.

0.11871 / 5750 ≈ 2.065e-5 m³/mol. That's 20.65 cm³/mol.

For white tin:
Vm_white = 0.11871 / 7280 ≈ 1.628e-5 m³/mol. So about 16.28 cm³/mol.

So ΔV is Vm_white - Vm_gray = 1.628e-5 - 2.065e-5 = -4.37e-6 m³/mol.

Wait, that's negative, which makes sense because white tin is denser, so its molar volume is smaller. So when going from gray to white, the volume decreases.

Now, the Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = ΔS/(ΔV). But since ΔV is negative here, dP/dT will be negative because ΔS is positive (since white has higher entropy). So increasing pressure (P) would require a decrease in temperature (T) to stay on the phase boundary.

But I'm looking for the equilibrium condition at 350 bar. The initial point is at 1 bar and 18°C. So I need to find how the pressure change affects the equilibrium temperature.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation of the Clapeyron equation for small changes, assuming that the changes are linear. So, assuming that dP/dT is constant, we can write:

ΔP = (ΔS / ΔV) * ΔT

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign here. Let me think again. The Clapeyron equation is (dP/dT) = (S2 - S1)/(V2 - V1).

In this case, going from gray to white, S2 is white, S1 is gray. So S_white - S_gray is positive. V_white is less than V_gray, so V2 - V1 is negative. So dP/dT is negative.

So, if pressure increases, temperature must decrease to maintain equilibrium.

Now, the equation can be rearranged to:

ΔT = (ΔV / ΔS) * ΔP

Wait, because from dP = (ΔS/ΔV) dT, so dT = (ΔV/ΔS) dP.

Wait, let me double-check. Clapeyron equation: dP/dT = ΔS/(ΔV). So dP = (ΔS/ΔV) dT. So dT = (ΔV/ΔS) dP.

But ΔV is negative, so if dP is positive (increase in pressure), dT would be negative, meaning temperature decreases. That's what we expect.

So, the change in pressure ΔP is 350 bar - 1 bar = 349 bar. But wait, the original pressure is 1 bar, and the new pressure is 350 bar, so ΔP = 350 - 1 = 349 bar. But wait, no, the original is 1 bar, and we're moving to 350 bar, so ΔP is 349 bar. Hmm, but maybe it's better to take the absolute values as positive.

Wait, but the Clapeyron equation is (dP/dT) = (S_white - S_gray)/(V_white - V_gray). Since V_white < V_gray, denominator is negative. So dP/dT is negative.

So, when pressure increases by ΔP = 350 - 1 = 349 bar, what is the corresponding ΔT?

Wait, but I need to make sure the units are correct. The Clapeyron equation uses pressure in Pascals, so I'll convert bar to Pascals. 1 bar is 1e5 Pascals. So 350 bar is 350e5 Pa. So ΔP is 350e5 Pa - 1e5 Pa = 349e5 Pa.

Wait, but actually, maybe I should think in terms of the change from 1 bar to 350 bar, so ΔP = 349 bar = 349e5 Pa.

Now, let's compute ΔT:

ΔT = (ΔV / ΔS) * ΔP

But wait, ΔV is negative, and ΔS is positive, so ΔV/ΔS is negative. So, ΔT will be negative, meaning temperature decreases.

Let me compute the values:

ΔV = V_white - V_gray = (-4.37e-6 m³/mol) as I calculated earlier.

ΔS = 51.18 - 44.14 = 7.04 J/(K·mol).

So,

ΔT = ( (-4.37e-6 m³/mol) / (7.04 J/(K·mol)) ) * (349e5 Pa)

Wait, but J is m³·Pa, so m³·Pa / (m³·Pa/K·mol) )? Let me check the units.

ΔV is m³/mol, ΔS is J/(K·mol) = (m³·Pa)/(K·mol).

So ΔV / ΔS would have units (m³/mol) / (m³·Pa/(K·mol)) ) = (m³/mol) * (K·mol)/(m³·Pa) ) = K/(Pa).

So when multiplied by ΔP (Pa), the units become K, which is correct for ΔT.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

ΔT = ( (-4.37e-6) / 7.04 ) * 349e5

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute (-4.37e-6) / 7.04:

That's approximately (-4.37 / 7.04) * 1e-6 ≈ (-0.6206) * 1e-6 ≈ -6.206e-7.

Then, multiply by 349e5 (which is 3.49e7):

ΔT ≈ (-6.206e-7) * 3.49e7.

Let me compute that:

6.206e-7 * 3.49e7 = 6.206 * 3.49 * 1e0 ≈ (approx 21.65) because 6 *3.5 is 21, 0.206*3.49≈0.717, so total about 22.367.

So, 6.206e-7 * 3.49e7 ≈ 22.367. But since it's negative, ΔT ≈ -22.367 K.

Wait, that's a significant change. So the temperature change is approximately -22.37 K.

But wait, the initial temperature is 18°C, which is 291.15 K. So the new temperature would be 291.15 K + ΔT. But wait, no: because the Clapeyron equation's dT is the change from the initial point. Wait, actually, the initial point is at T=18°C (291.15 K), and when pressure increases, the equilibrium temperature decreases by 22.37 K.

Wait, no. Wait, the Clapeyron equation gives the slope of the phase boundary. So, when you move along the phase boundary, if pressure increases, temperature decreases.

So, the change in temperature is ΔT = -22.37 K. So the new temperature is 291.15 K + (-22.37 K) = 268.78 K.

Convert that back to Celsius: 268.78 K - 273.15 = approximately -14.37°C.

Wait, looking at the options, I see option H is -15.2°C, which is close.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because 22 K seems quite a large change, and maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me redo the calculation more carefully.

Compute (-4.37e-6 m³/mol) / (7.04 J/(K·mol)).

First, J is kg·m²/s², but since 1 J = 1 Pa·m³, so it's correct.

Compute (-4.37e-6) / 7.04:

4.37 /7.04 ≈ 0.6206, so 4.37e-6 /7.04 ≈ 6.206e-7.

So, 6.206e-7 m³/(Pa·K·mol) ??? Wait, no, the units for ΔV/ΔS are (m³/mol) / (J/(K·mol)) ) = (m³/mol) * (K·mol)/J ) = K·m³/(J).

But since J is N·m = Pa·m³, so K·m³/(Pa·m³) ) = K/Pa.

Wait, perhaps better not to get stuck on units and just proceed numerically.

So, 6.206e-7 * 349e5 = 6.206e-7 * 3.49e5 = let's compute exponents: 1e-7 * 1e5 = 1e-2.

6.206 * 3.49 ≈ 21.65, so 21.65 * 1e-2 = 0.2165.

Wait, wait, 349e5 is 3.49e7? No, 349 *1e5 = 3.49e7? Wait, 349 * 1e5 = 34,900,000 = 3.49e7. Yes.

Wait, no, 349e5 is 349 * 1e5 = 3.49e7.

So, 6.206e-7 * 3.49e7 = 6.206 *3.49 * (1e-7 *1e7) )= 6.206 *3.49 *1 = approx 21.65.

So, 6.206e-7 *3.49e7 = 21.65, so ΔT = -21.65 K.

Wait, that's different than before. So, 21.65 K decrease from 18°C would be 18 -21.65 = -3.65°C.

Wait, but that's not matching the earlier calculation. Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔV. Let me recalculate the molar volumes.

Molar mass M of Sn is 0.11871 kg/mol.

Density of gray tin is 5750 kg/m³, so molar volume V_gray = M / density = 0.11871 /5750 = ?

Let me compute that: 0.11871 /5750 = let's compute 0.11871 ÷5750.

5750 = 5.75e3, so 0.11871 /5.75e3 = (0.11871/5.75) ) * 1e-3.

0.11871 ÷5.75 ≈ 0.02065, so 0.02065e-3 m³/mol = 2.065e-5 m³/mol.

Similarly, white tin's density is 7280 kg/m³, so V_white = 0.11871 /7280.

Compute 0.11871 ÷7280: 7280 is 7.28e3, so 0.11871 /7.28e3 ≈ (0.11871 /7.28) ) * 1e-3.

0.11871 ÷7.28 ≈ 0.01632, so 0.01632e-3 m³/mol = 1.632e-5 m³/mol.

So, ΔV = V_white - V_gray = 1.632e-5 -2.065e-5 = -4.33e-6 m³/mol. So that's correct.

Thus, ΔV is -4.33e-6 m³/mol.

ΔS is 7.04 J/(K·mol).

So, (ΔV/ΔS) = (-4.33e-6) /7.04 ≈ -6.15e-7 m³/(J·mol) ??? Wait, no, the units are (m³/mol) / (J/(K·mol)) ) = (m³/mol) * (K·mol)/J ) = K·m³/(J).

But J is m³·Pa, so it simplifies to K/(Pa). So when multiplied by dP (in Pa), it gives dT in K.

So, (ΔV/ΔS) = (-4.33e-6 m³/mol) / (7.04 J/(K·mol)) = (-4.33e-6 /7.04) * (m³/mol) * (K·mol)/(J) ).

Now, J = Pa·m³, so:

= (-4.33e-6 /7.04) * (K·m³)/(Pa·m³) ) = (-4.33e-6 /7.04) * K/Pa ≈ (-6.15e-7) K/Pa.

Now, dP is 349 bar, which is 349e5 Pa.

So, ΔT = (ΔV/ΔS) * dP = (-6.15e-7 K/Pa) * 349e5 Pa.

Compute 349e5 = 3.49e7 Pa.

So, ΔT = (-6.15e-7) * (3.49e7) ) K.

Multiply 6.15e-7 by 3.49e7:

6.15 *3.49 ≈ 21.42, and 1e-7 *1e7=1e0=1.

So, 21.42 *1 =21.42, but with the negative sign: ΔT ≈ -21.42 K.

So, the change in temperature is approximately -21.42 K.

Initial temperature is 18°C = 291.15 K. So the new temperature is 291.15 + (-21.42) = 269.73 K.

Convert to Celsius: 269.73 -273.15 = -3.42°C.

Wait, that's about -3.4°C. Looking at the options, option C is -3.5°C. That's very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again the multiplication.

6.15e-7 *3.49e7:

6.15e-7 *3.49e7 = 6.15 *3.49 * (1e-7 *1e7) )= 21.4185 *1 =21.4185.

Yes, so ΔT≈ -21.4185 K.

So, 291.15 K -21.4185 K = 269.7315 K.

269.7315 K is 269.7315 -273.15 = -3.4185°C, approximately -3.42°C.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: -3.5°C.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the transition from gray to white tin. So, when pressure increases, the phase with higher density (white tin) is favored because higher pressure tends to favor the denser phase.

At 1 bar, the transition occurs at 18°C. When pressure increases to 350 bar, the transition temperature should decrease because the system is under higher pressure, which favors the denser (white) phase. So, the equilibrium temperature would be lower than 18°C.

Wait, but earlier I calculated a ΔT of -21.4 K, leading to a temperature of about -3.4°C. That makes sense because increasing pressure lowers the transition temperature.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is -3.5°C, which is very close to my result.

Wait, but the options also include B: -7.8°C and H: -15.2°C. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me check the molar volumes again.

Molar mass M = 0.11871 kg/mol.

Gray tin: V_gray = 0.11871 /5750 = 0.11871 /5750 = 2.0644e-5 m³/mol.

White tin: V_white = 0.11871 /7280 = approx 1.632e-5 m³/mol.

ΔV = V_white - V_gray = 1.632e-5 -2.0644e-5 = -4.324e-6 m³/mol.

ΔS = 51.18 -44.14 =7.04 J/(K·mol).

So, (ΔV/ΔS) = (-4.324e-6) /7.04 = approx -6.14e-7 K/Pa.

dP = 350 bar -1 bar = 349 bar = 349e5 Pa.

So, ΔT = (-6.14e-7 K/Pa) * (349e5 Pa) = (-6.14e-7) *3.49e5 = let's compute 6.14 *3.49 = approx 21.43, and 1e-7 *1e5=1e-2.

Wait, no, wait: 349e5 Pa is 3.49e7 Pa. So,

ΔT = (-6.14e-7) *3.49e7 = (-6.14 *3.49) * (1e-7 *1e7) )= (-21.4286) *1 = -21.4286 K.

So, initial T is 291.15 K (18°C), so new T is 291.15 -21.4286 ≈ 269.72 K.

269.72 K is 269.72 -273.15 = -3.43°C.

So, approximately -3.43°C, which is very close to option C: -3.5°C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer might be around -14°C, but that was a miscalculation. No, now I'm confident it's around -3.4°C.

So the correct answer should be option C: -3.5°C.
</think>

To determine the temperature at which gray tin and white tin are in equilibrium at 350 bar, we use the Clapeyron equation:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Initial conditions**: \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{bar}, T_1 = 18^\circ \text{C} = 291.15 \, \text{K} \)
- **Densities**:  
  \[
  \rho_{\text{gray}} = 5750 \, \text{kg/m}^3, \quad \rho_{\text{white}} = 7280 \, \text{kg/m}^3
  \]
- **Molar entropies**:  
  \[
  S_{\text{gray}} = 44.14 \, \text{J/K/mol}, \quad S_{\text{white}} = 51.18 \, \text{J/K/mol}
  \]
- **Molar mass of tin**: \( M = 0.11871 \, \text{kg/mol} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta S \)
\[
\Delta S = S_{\text{white}} - S_{\text{gray}} = 51.18 - 44.14 = 7.04 \, \text{J/K/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Molar Volumes
The molar volume \( V_m \) is given by \( V_m = \frac{M}{\rho} \).

- For gray tin:
\[
V_{\text{gray}} = \frac{0.11871}{5750} \approx 2.065 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3/\text{mol}
\]

- For white tin:
\[
V_{\text{white}} = \frac{0.11871}{7280} \approx 1.632 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3/\text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta V \)
\[
\Delta V = V_{\text{white}} - V_{\text{gray}} = 1.632 \times 10^{-5} - 2.065 \times 10^{-5} = -4.33 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3/\text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Use the Clapeyron Equation
The Clapeyron equation is linearized as:
\[
\Delta T = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta S} \cdot \Delta P
\]

- Convert \( \Delta P \) to Pascals:
\[
\Delta P = 350 \, \text{bar} - 1 \, \text{bar} = 349 \, \text{bar} = 349 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}
\]

- Compute \( \Delta T \):
\[
\Delta T = \frac{-4.33 \times 10^{-6}}{7.04} \cdot 349 \times 10^5
\]

\[
\Delta T = (-6.15 \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 349 \times 10^5 \approx -21.42 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the New Temperature
The initial temperature is \( T_1 = 291.15 \, \text{K} \). The new temperature is:
\[
T_2 = T_1 + \Delta T = 291.15 - 21.42 = 269.73 \, \text{K}
\]

Convert to Celsius:
\[
T_2 = 269.73 - 273.15 \approx -3.42^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Final Answer:
The temperature at which gray and white tin are in equilibrium at 350 bar is approximately \( -3.4^\circ \text{C} \), which corresponds to option **C: -3.5°C**.
