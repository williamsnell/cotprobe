Okay, so I've got this finance question here about tax shields, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking for the value of the tax shield. The given data points are: the value of the firm is $5 million, the value if it were unlevered would be $4.78 million, and the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the tax shield is related to the benefits a company gets from taking on debt because interest is tax-deductible. The formula I think goes something like Value of the Firm = Value Unlevered + Tax Shield - Bankruptcy Costs. Or was it Value Levered = Value Unlevered + Tax Shield - Bankruptcy Costs? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, maybe it's Value Levered = Value Unlevered + (Tax Shield - Bankruptcy Costs). So in this case, the levered value is given as $5 million, and the unlevered is $4.78 million. So if I rearrange the formula, Tax Shield would be (Value Levered - Value Unlevered) + Bankruptcy Costs.

Let me plug in the numbers. Value Levered is $5,000,000, Value Unlevered is $4,780,000. So 5,000,000 - 4,780,000 equals $220,000. Then add the bankruptcy costs of $360,000. Wait, that would make Tax Shield $220,000 + $360,000 = $580,000? But wait, that doesn't seem right because I think the formula subtracts the bankruptcy costs, not adds them. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, let me think again. The formula I remember is: Value Levered = Value Unlevered + Tax Shield - Bankruptcy Costs. So rearranged, Tax Shield = Value Levered - Value Unlevered + Bankruptcy Costs. Wait, no, that can't be right because if you move things around, it's Tax Shield = (Value Levered - Value Unlevered) + Bankruptcy Costs? That doesn't seem to make sense because if the value is higher, the tax shield would be higher. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is Tax Shield = Value Levered - Value Unlevered + Bankruptcy Costs. Let me check: 5,000,000 -4,780,000 = 220,000. Then plus 360,000 would be 580,000. But I'm not sure if I'm adding or subtracting the bankruptcy costs. Alternatively, maybe the formula is Tax Shield = (Value Levered - Value Unlevered) + Bankruptcy Costs, which would be 220k + 360k = 580k. But that would make the tax shield higher than the difference, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another approach: The tax shield is the present value of the tax savings from debt. The formula for tax shield is typically Tax Rate * Interest Tax Shield, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the value of the tax shield is the difference between the levered and unlevered firm plus some costs.

Wait, another way: The value of the tax shield is equal to the value of the levered firm minus the value of the unlevered firm minus the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs. So Tax Shield = (5,000,000 - 4,780,000) - 360,000. Wait, that would be 220,000 - 360,000, which is negative, which can't be right because the tax shield is a positive value. So that approach must be wrong.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Tax Shield = (Levered Value - Unlevered Value) + Bankruptcy Costs. Oh, but that would be 220k + 360k = 580k. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the formula is Value Levered = Value Unlevered + Tax Shield - Bankruptcy Costs. So if we rearrange, Tax Shield = Value Levered - Value Unlevered + Bankruptcy Costs. So 5,000,000 -4,780,000 = 220k, plus 360k = 580k.

But looking at the options, E is 580,000. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because I thought the tax shield is the benefit from debt, but when you add in the costs of bankruptcy, it might reduce the net benefit. So perhaps the correct formula is that the tax shield is the difference between levered and unlevered plus the costs. Or maybe the tax shield is the difference minus the costs.

Wait, I think I might have it backwards. Maybe the correct formula is Tax Shield = (Value Levered - Value Unlevered) + Bankruptcy Costs. Because if the value of the firm increases due to the tax shield, but then you have to subtract the costs. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I should probably look up the formula. The standard formula for the value of the firm with leverage is:

Value Levered = Value Unlevered + Tax Shield - Bankruptcy Costs

So rearranged, Tax Shield = Value Levered - Value Unlevered + Bankruptcy Costs.

So in this case, 5,000,000 -4,780,000 = 220,000. Then add 360,000: 220k + 360k = 580k. So the tax shield would be $580,000, which is option E.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the tax shield is just the difference between levered and unlevered, without adding the bankruptcy costs. But in the question, they also mention the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs, which perhaps are part of the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

Value Levered = Value Unlevered + Tax Shield - Bankruptcy Costs

So if we know Value Levered, Value Unlevered, and Bankruptcy Costs, we can solve for Tax Shield.

So rearranged: Tax Shield = Value Levered - Value Unlevered + Bankruptcy Costs.

So 5,000,000 -4,780,000 = 220,000. Then add 360,000, giving 580,000. So option E is correct.

To determine the value of the tax shield, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Value Levered} = \text{Value Unlevered} + \text{Tax Shield} - \text{Bankruptcy Costs}
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for the tax shield:

\[
\text{Tax Shield} = \text{Value Levered} - \text{Value Unlevered} + \text{Bankruptcy Costs}
\]

Plugging in the given values:

\[
\text{Value Levered} = \$5,000,000
\]
\[
\text{Value Unlevered} = \$4,780,000
\]
\[
\text{Bankruptcy Costs} = \$360,000
\]

\[
\text{Tax Shield} = \$5,000,000 - \$4,780,000 + \$360,000 = \$580,000
\]

Thus, the value of the tax shield is \$580,000.
