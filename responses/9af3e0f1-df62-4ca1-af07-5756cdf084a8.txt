Okay, so I've got this problem about water flowing through a pipe, and I need to find the power required. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my classes. I think this involves some fluid mechanics, maybe the Bernoulli equation or something about head and power.

Alright, let's see the details. The pipe is wrought iron, 4 inches in diameter, 100 feet long. The water is moving at a mean velocity of 6 feet per second. The outlet is 3 feet higher than the inlet. The question is asking for the power required to maintain this flow. The options are from A to J, so I need to calculate and choose the right one.

First, I think I should calculate the head loss due to friction and then any other heads involved. Since the outlet is higher, that's a velocity head difference, but maybe that's already accounted for in the total head. Wait, no, the total head would include the static head (the elevation difference), the kinetic energy change, and the head loss due to friction.

The equation I remember is the Bernoulli equation: h_total = h_friction + h_velocity + h_elevation. Or wait, maybe it's h_total = h_friction + (v²)/(2g) + z, but I'm a bit confused here. Wait, actually, the Bernoulli equation is about energy conservation, so the total head at the inlet equals the total head at the outlet plus the head loss. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the Bernoulli equation is h1 + v1²/(2g) + z1 = h2 + v2²/(2g) + z2 + h_loss. Here, h_loss is the head lost due to friction. So, rearranged, the head loss h_loss = (v1² - v2²)/(2g) + (z1 - z2). But in this problem, I don't know if the velocities at inlet and outlet are the same. Wait, the pipe is a closed system, so maybe the velocity is the same at both ends? Or is there a difference because of the elevation?

Wait, no, the pipe is 100 feet long, so the flow is steady, probably with the same velocity at inlet and outlet because it's a single pipe without any changes in diameter. So v1 = v2 = 6 ft/s. Then, the elevation difference is 3 feet, with outlet higher, so z1 - z2 = -3 ft. So putting that into the equation: h_loss = (v1² - v2²)/(2g) + (z1 - z2) = (0)/(2g) + (-3) = -3 ft. Wait, that can't be right because head loss should be positive. Hmm, maybe I have the signs wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the Bernoulli equation is h1 + (v1²)/(2g) + z1 = h2 + (v2²)/(2g) + z2 + h_loss. So rearranging, h_loss = h1 - h2 + (v1² - v2²)/(2g) + (z1 - z2). If h1 and h2 are the static pressures, but maybe in this case, we're assuming the only heads are elevation and velocity. So if the pipe is horizontal, z1 = z2, but here z2 is higher, so z1 - z2 = -3 ft. Since v1 = v2, their squares cancel out. So h_loss = (z1 - z2) = -3 ft. But that would imply negative head loss, which doesn't make sense. I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the head loss is due to friction, and the total head provided by the pump (if any) is the sum of the elevation head and the velocity head change plus the friction head. But in this case, the problem doesn't mention a pump, so maybe it's a natural flow, like gravity-fed? But the outlet is higher, so that would mean it's not gravity-driven because the water would flow uphill, which would require energy input.

Wait, no, the pipe is going uphill 3 feet, so the water is being pushed up, which means work is done, so power is needed. So perhaps I should calculate the work done per unit time, which is power.

Power is given by the equation P = ρ g Q h_total, where h_total is the total head required, including friction and elevation. But wait, I'm not sure. Another approach is to calculate the head loss (h_f) using the Hazen-Williams formula or the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should use the Darcy-Weisbach equation because it's more general.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is h_f = f * (L/D) * (v²)/(2g), where f is the friction factor, L is the length, D is the diameter, and v is the velocity.

But to find f, I need to know the Reynolds number and the relative roughness. Wrought iron pipes have a certain roughness. Wait, I think the relative roughness for wrought iron is ε/D, where ε is the roughness height. From my notes, I recall that for wrought iron, ε is about 0.0008 ft. Let me check: the relative roughness ε/D is 0.0008/0.3333 (since 4 inches is 0.3333 ft). So that's about 0.0024.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, I think for wrought iron, the relative roughness is around 0.0008 ft. Let me proceed with that.

Next, I need the Reynolds number, Re = (v D) / ν, where ν is the kinematic viscosity. Water's ν is about 1.1 x 10^-6 m²/s, but I need it in ft²/s. Let me convert that. 1 m is approximately 3.28084 ft, so 1 m² is (3.28084)^2 ≈ 10.7639 ft². So 1.1e-6 m²/s = 1.1e-6 * 10.7639 ≈ 1.184e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no: 1 m²/s = (3.28084 ft)^2 / s ≈ 10.7639 ft²/s. So 1.1e-6 m²/s = 1.1e-6 * 10.7639 ≈ 1.184e-5 ft²/s. So ν ≈ 1.184e-5 ft²/s.

Now, velocity v is 6 ft/s, D is 4 inches which is 0.3333 ft. So Re = (6 * 0.3333) / (1.184e-5) ≈ (2) / 1.184e-5 ≈ 168,907. So Re ≈ 1.69e5.

Now, for wrought iron, which is a smooth pipe, but wait, no, I think wrought iron is a rough pipe. Wait, no, actually, I think the relative roughness for wrought iron is ε/D = 0.0008 ft. So with Re around 1.69e5, which is in the turbulent flow region. So now I need to find the friction factor f using the Moody diagram or the equation.

The Moody diagram gives f for a given Re and relative roughness. Since Re is about 1.69e5 and ε/D is 0.0008, I can look up f. Alternatively, use the equation for smooth pipes when Re is high enough, but I think for ε/D=0.0008, it's a smooth pipe if Re is above a certain value. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with an approximate f value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for f in the Moody diagram. For Re=1.69e5 and ε/D=0.0008, I think f is around 0.02. Wait, I'm not certain, but I'll go with f=0.02 for now.

Now, compute h_f using Darcy-Weisbach: h_f = f*(L/D)*(v²)/(2g). Plugging in the numbers:

f=0.02, L=100 ft, D=0.3333 ft, v=6 ft/s, g=32.174 ft/s².

So h_f = 0.02 * (100 / 0.3333) * (6^2)/(2*32.174).

Calculating each part:

100 / 0.3333 ≈ 300.

6^2 = 36.

So h_f = 0.02 * 300 * 36 / (2*32.174).

Compute denominator first: 2*32.174 ≈ 64.348.

So numerator: 0.02 * 300 = 6; 6 * 36 = 216.

So h_f = 216 / 64.348 ≈ 3.356 feet.

Wait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Now, the total head required is the sum of the elevation change and the head loss. Wait, but the elevation is 3 feet higher at the outlet, so the water is being lifted up, which adds to the head. So the total head h_total is h_f + (Δz), but wait, Δz is 3 ft, but in which direction? Since the outlet is higher, the head due to elevation is +3 ft. So the total head is h_f + Δz?

Wait no, wait. The head loss is the energy lost, so the total head provided by the pump (if any) would be the sum of the head loss and the elevation change. So h_total = h_f + (z2 - z1). Since z2 is higher, z2 - z1 = +3 ft. So h_total = 3.356 + 3 = 6.356 ft.

Wait, but that might not be correct because the head loss is the loss due to friction, and the elevation is the static head. So the pump would need to provide enough head to overcome both the friction loss and the elevation. So h_total = h_f + Δz.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the elevation difference is already included in the head loss calculation. Wait, no, because the elevation difference is an external force, so the pump would have to provide the energy for that as well as overcoming the friction.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the pipe is 100 ft long, and the outlet is 3 ft higher. So the water is moving from a lower point to a higher point, which requires energy input. So the total head the pump needs to provide is the sum of the head loss (h_f) plus the elevation head (Δz). So h_total = h_f + Δz.

Wait, but the elevation head is z2 - z1, which is +3 ft. So h_total = 3.356 + 3 = 6.356 ft.

Now, to find the power, I know that power P is given by P = (ρ g Q h_total) / (efficiency * 1000), but wait, maybe I'm mixing units. Let me think again. The formula for power in fluid mechanics is P = (ρ g Q h_total) / η, where η is efficiency. But the problem doesn't mention efficiency, so maybe we're assuming 100% efficiency, or perhaps it's included in the head loss calculation.

Wait, but in this case, the problem is asking for the power required, so maybe it's just P = ρ g Q h_total, but I need to check the units.

First, calculate the flow rate Q. Q is A * v, where A is the cross-sectional area. The pipe diameter is 4 inches, which is 0.3333 ft. So radius is 0.16665 ft. Area A = π r² = π*(0.16665)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.02777 ≈ 0.08727 sq.ft.

Velocity v = 6 ft/s, so Q = 0.08727 * 6 ≈ 0.5236 cubic feet per second.

Now, water's density ρ is 62.42 lbm/cu.ft. g is 32.174 ft/s². h_total is 6.356 ft.

So P = ρ * g * Q * h_total. Wait, but the units here: ρ in lbm/ft³, g in ft/s², Q in ft³/s, h in ft. So the units would be (lbm/ft³) * (ft/s²) * (ft³/s) * ft = lbm * ft²/s³.

But power in horsepower: 1 hp = 550 ft·lbf/s. So I need to convert the units correctly.

Wait, another approach. The formula for power in horsepower is P = (Q * Δh * ρ * g) / (550 * η), but since efficiency isn't given, maybe η=1.

Wait, but let me think. The energy per unit time is power, so P = (ρ g Q h_total) / η. But without η, perhaps it's assumed to be 100% efficient, so η=1.

So P = (62.42 lbm/ft³) * (32.174 ft/s²) * (0.5236 ft³/s) * (6.356 ft) / (550 ft·lbf/s).

Wait, let me compute the numerator first.

62.42 * 32.174 ≈ 2007 lbm·ft/s² per ft³ (since lbm·ft/s² is equivalent to lbf, because F=ma, so lbm·ft/s² = lbf·ft).

Wait, no, actually, 1 lbm·ft/s² = 1 lbf·ft, because F=ma, so F in lbm·ft/s² would be lbf, since 1 lbf = 1 lbm * 1 ft/s².

So 62.42 lbm/ft³ * 32.174 ft/s² = 62.42 * 32.174 ≈ 2007 lbf/ft³.

Then, 2007 lbf/ft³ * 0.5236 ft³/s ≈ 2007 * 0.5236 ≈ 1052.4 lbf/s.

Then, 1052.4 lbf/s * 6.356 ft ≈ 1052.4 * 6.356 ≈ 6677.5 ft·lbf/s.

Now, 1 hp = 550 ft·lbf/s, so P = 6677.5 / 550 ≈ 12.14 hp.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are up to about 2 hp. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, let me go back. Did I make a mistake in calculating h_total? I thought h_total was h_f + Δz, which was 3.356 + 3 = 6.356 ft. But maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should not add them. Because the head loss is in addition to the elevation. Let me think again about the energy equation. The pump has to provide enough energy to not only lift the water 3 ft but also overcome the friction loss of 3.356 ft. So total head is 3 + 3.356 = 6.356 ft.

Wait, but according to the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the h_f is the head lost due to friction, so the pump needs to provide that plus the elevation head. So yes, 6.356 ft.

Wait, but that would make the power requirement higher, but the options don't go that high. The highest option is J: 1.75 hp. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the elevation difference is considered as a head, and the head loss is in addition. Alternatively, maybe I should subtract the elevation if the water is going uphill, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the Bernoulli equation. The correct form is:

At the inlet: h1 = elevation head + velocity head + pressure head.

At the outlet: h2 = elevation head (higher) + velocity head (same as inlet, since velocity is same) + pressure head.

The head loss (h_f) occurs from inlet to outlet.

So the equation is:

h1 + (v1²)/(2g) = h2 + (v2²)/(2g) + h_f

But since v1 = v2 = 6 ft/s, the velocity heads cancel out.

So h1 = h2 + h_f.

h1 is the head at the inlet, which is at a lower elevation than h2, so h1 = z1 + ... and h2 = z2 + ... But in terms of static head, the elevation difference is z2 - z1 = +3 ft.

Wait, perhaps the equation should be h1 = h2 + h_f, but h2 is higher than h1 by 3 ft. So h1 = (z2) + (v2²)/(2g) + h_f - (z1) - (v1²)/(2g).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the total head the pump needs to provide is the sum of the elevation head and the head loss.

Wait, but when the water is pumped uphill, the pump must supply the energy to lift the water plus overcome the friction loss.

So h_total = Δz + h_f = 3 + 3.356 ≈ 6.356 ft.

So that part seems correct.

Now, the flow rate Q = 0.5236 ft³/s.

Power P = (ρ g Q h_total) / η. Assuming efficiency η=1 for now.

ρ=62.42 lbm/ft³, g=32.174 ft/s², Q=0.5236 ft³/s, h_total=6.356 ft.

Compute P = 62.42 * 32.174 * 0.5236 * 6.356.

Let me compute step by step:

62.42 * 32.174 ≈ 2007. (As before.)

2007 * 0.5236 ≈ 1052.4.

1052.4 * 6.356 ≈ 6677.5 ft·lbf/s.

Convert to horsepower: 6677.5 / 550 ≈ 12.14 hp. But that's way higher than any of the options, which go up to about 2 hp. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the friction factor f is incorrect. Earlier I assumed f=0.02, but maybe that's too high. Let me check the Moody diagram again for Re=1.69e5 and ε/D=0.0008.

Looking at the Moody diagram, for Re=1.69e5 and ε/D=0.0008, the friction factor f is around 0.02. Wait, but maybe for a 4-inch diameter pipe, the relative roughness is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different approach to calculate f.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the flow rate. Let me double-check Q.

Diameter is 4 inches, so radius is 2 inches, which is 0.3333 ft divided by 12? Wait, no. Wait, 4 inches is 0.3333 ft. So radius r = 0.3333 / 2 = 0.16665 ft.

Area A = π r² = π * (0.16665)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.02777 ≈ 0.08727 ft².

Velocity v=6 ft/s, so Q = 0.08727 * 6 ≈ 0.5236 ft³/s. That seems correct.

Hmm, maybe the elevation difference isn't supposed to be added but is part of the head loss. Wait, no, the elevation is a separate term in the Bernoulli equation.

Wait, perhaps the head loss is calculated without considering the elevation, but the elevation is an additional term. So h_total = h_f + Δz.

Wait, but in that case, h_f is 3.356 ft, Δz is 3 ft, so h_total is 6.356 ft, which leads to the same problem as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the elevation difference is already included in the head loss. But that doesn't make sense because head loss is due to friction, not the elevation.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the elevation head is a form of potential energy that the pump has to provide, in addition to overcoming the friction loss.

So, going back, perhaps the problem is that I'm including both the head loss and the elevation, but the elevation is already part of the necessary head, so maybe the total head is just the sum.

But the power calculation is giving me 12 hp, which is way beyond the options. So I must have made a mistake in calculating h_f.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Darcy-Weisbach calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

h_f = f * (L/D) * (v²)/(2g).

f=0.02, L=100 ft, D=0.3333 ft, v=6 ft/s, g=32.174.

So L/D = 100 / 0.3333 ≈ 300.

v² = 36.

So (v²)/(2g) = 36 / (2 * 32.174) ≈ 36 / 64.348 ≈ 0.5568 ft.

Then, h_f = 0.02 * 300 * 0.5568 ≈ 0.02 * 300 = 6; 6 * 0.5568 ≈ 3.341 ft. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the friction factor is lower. Let me think again. For a smooth pipe, f is lower, but wrought iron is actually a rough pipe. Wait, no, I think I confused the materials. Maybe the relative roughness for wrought iron is higher. Let me check: I think wrought iron has a relative roughness of ε/D = 0.0008 ft, which is a smooth pipe. But for Re=1.69e5, which is quite high, the flow is turbulent, and for smooth pipes, f decreases with increasing Re. So perhaps f is lower than 0.02.

Wait, from the Moody diagram, for Re=1e5, f≈0.02 for smooth pipes. At Re=2e5, f≈0.015. So maybe at Re=1.69e5, f is around 0.018.

Let me recalculate h_f with f=0.018.

h_f = 0.018 * 300 * 0.5568 ≈ 0.018 * 300 = 5.4; 5.4 * 0.5568 ≈ 3.004 ft.

So h_f ≈ 3.004 ft.

Now, h_total = 3.004 + 3 = 6.004 ft.

Now, recalculate the power.

P = (62.42 lbm/ft³) * (32.174 ft/s²) * (0.5236 ft³/s) * (6.004 ft) / (550 ft·lbf/s).

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, 62.42 * 32.174 ≈ 2007 lbm·ft/s² per ft³.

2007 * 0.5236 ≈ 1052.4 lbm·ft/s² per s, which is lbm·ft²/s³.

1052.4 * 6.004 ≈ 6319.2 lbm·ft²/s³.

Now, convert to horsepower: 6319.2 / 550 ≈ 11.49 hp. Still too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the elevation difference is 3 ft, but the head loss is calculated correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the pipe isn't horizontal, but the elevation difference affects the head loss.

Wait, no, the elevation difference is between the inlet and outlet, but the pipe is 100 ft long. So the elevation is 3 ft, but the pipe's length is horizontal? Or is the pipe inclined? The problem says the outlet is 3 ft higher, but doesn't specify the pipe's slope, so I think we can assume the pipe is horizontal, and the elevation difference is 3 ft from inlet to outlet.

Wait, but if the pipe is horizontal, the elevation difference is 3 ft, but the pipe itself is 100 ft long. So the head loss is due to friction along the length, which is 100 ft.

Wait, maybe the elevation difference is included in the head loss calculation. No, the elevation is a separate term.

I'm stuck because my calculation gives over 11 hp, but the options are much lower. Maybe I used the wrong formula for power.

Wait, another approach: the power can also be calculated as P = (1/2) * ρ * v^3 * A, which is the kinetic energy per unit time.

Wait, but that's only considering the kinetic energy, not the elevation or friction. So that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula where power is given by P = (ρ g Q (h + (v²)/(2g))), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is considering only the head due to the elevation and the head loss, but without considering the velocity head change, assuming it's negligible or the same at both ends.

So, with h_total = Δz + h_f = 3 + 3.004 ≈ 6.004 ft.

Then, power P = (ρ g Q h_total) / η.

But without efficiency, perhaps it's assumed to be 100%, so P = 62.42 * 32.174 * 0.5236 * 6.004.

Wait, I've done this before and got around 11.5 hp, which isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the head loss. Let me check the Darcy equation again.

Wait, maybe I should have used the Hazen-Williams formula instead. The Hazen-Williams equation is easier and gives the velocity head directly.

The Hazen-Williams equation is v = (0.408 * C) * (R^(1/6)) * (S^0.5), where C is the Hazen-Williams coefficient, R is the hydraulic radius, and S is the slope (h/L).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the value of C for wrought iron. I think for wrought iron, C is around 120.

Wait, let me try that. R is the hydraulic radius, which is A/w, where A is the cross-sectional area and w is the wetted perimeter.

For a pipe, w = π D. So R = A/w = (π (D/2)^2)/(π D) )= (π D²/4) / (π D) )= D/4.

So R = D/4 = 0.3333 /4 ≈ 0.0833 ft.

Slope S is the head loss per length, S = h_f / L.

But I'm trying to find h_f, so rearranging the Hazen-Williams equation:

v = 0.408 * C * (R^(1/6)) * (S^0.5).

But S = h_f / L, so S^0.5 = sqrt(h_f / L).

Rearranging for h_f:

h_f = (v / (0.408 * C * R^(1/6)))^2 * L.

Plugging the numbers in:

v=6 ft/s,

C for wrought iron is 120,

R=0.0833 ft,

L=100 ft.

Compute R^(1/6): (0.0833)^(1/6). Let me calculate that.

First, ln(0.0833) ≈ -2.4849. Divide by 6: ≈ -0.41415. Exponentiate: e^(-0.41415) ≈ 0.66.

So R^(1/6) ≈ 0.66.

Now, denominator: 0.408 * 120 * 0.66 ≈ 0.408 * 79.2 ≈ 32.34.

Now, h_f = (6 / 32.34)^2 * 100.

6 /32.34 ≈ 0.1856.

Square that: ≈0.03446.

Multiply by 100: h_f ≈3.446 ft.

So h_f ≈3.446 ft.

Then, h_total = Δz + h_f = 3 +3.446≈6.446 ft.

Now, P = (62.42 * 32.174 * 0.5236 *6.446)/550.

Compute step by step:

62.42 *32.174 ≈2007.

2007 *0.5236 ≈1052.4.

1052.4 *6.446≈6784.4.

6784.4 /550≈12.33 hp.

Still way too high.

Wait, I'm getting the same issue with both methods, so perhaps I'm miscalculating something else. Let me think about units again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for power in terms of head and flow:

Power (hp) = (1.714 x 10^-5) * Q * h_total,

where Q is in cubic feet per second, and h_total in feet.

Wait, that's a shortcut formula. Let me see.

Yes, the formula is P = (Q * h_total) * 1.714e-5 hp/(ft³/s * ft).

So, Q=0.5236 ft³/s, h_total=6.356 ft.

P = 0.5236 *6.356 *1.714e-5.

Compute 0.5236 *6.356≈3.327.

3.327 *1.714e-5≈5.71e-5 hp.

Wait, that can't be right because 5.7e-5 hp is about 0.057 hp, which is option A: 0.5 hp. But that seems too low.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me check the formula again.

The correct formula for converting to horsepower is P (hp) = (Q * h_total * 54.54) / (efficiency * 1000).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me find the correct formula.

The standard formula is:

Power (hp) = (Flow rate (gpm) × Head (ft) × 0.430) / Efficiency.

But since we're using Q in ft³/s, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, another approach: 1 horsepower = 550 ft·lbf/s.

Power in ft·lbf/s is ρ * g * Q * h_total.

With ρ=62.42 lbm/ft³, g=32.174 ft/s².

So, ft·lbf/s = 62.42 *32.174 * Q * h_total.

Then, divide by 550 to get hp.

So, let me compute this again with h_total=6.356 ft.

62.42 *32.174 = 2007.

2007 *0.5236 = 1052.4.

1052.4 *6.356≈6677.

6677 /550≈12.14 hp.

This is consistent with previous calculations, but the options don't have anything near 12 hp.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach entirely. Maybe the problem doesn't involve a pump and is just about the power required to lift the water, ignoring friction loss. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the power is just the product of the weight of the fluid, the height, and the flow rate, without considering friction. Let me try that.

The weight flow rate is ρ * g * Q. So ρ=62.42 lbm/ft³, g=32.174 ft/s², Q=0.5236 ft³/s.

So weight flow rate = 62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 ≈ 62.42 *32.174≈2007 *0.5236≈1052.4 lbm·ft/s² per s, which is lbf/s.

Then, lifting 3 ft: 1052.4 *3 =3157.2 ft·lbf/s.

Convert to horsepower: 3157.2 /550≈5.74 hp.

Still higher than the options. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the power required is just to lift the water, without considering friction. So h_total=3 ft.

Then, P = (62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *3)/550.

Compute:

62.42 *32.174≈2007.

2007 *0.5236≈1052.4.

1052.4 *3≈3157.2.

3157.2 /550≈5.74 hp. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the flow rate. Let me check again.

Diameter is 4 inches, so radius is 2 inches. Area A = π*(2/12)^2 = π*(1/6)^2= π/36≈0.08727 sq.ft.

Velocity v=6 ft/s, so Q=0.08727 *6≈0.5236 ft³/s. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula where power is ρ * g * Q * h, but using different units. Let me try using metric units.

Wait, but the problem is given in imperial units, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for power in terms of the head and flow without considering friction, but that would give me 5.74 hp, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. The options are from 0.5 hp up to 2 hp. So maybe the correct answer is around 1 hp.

Wait, perhaps the head loss is negligible, and only the elevation is considered. So h_total=3 ft.

Then, P = (62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *3)/550.

As before, that's 3157.2 /550≈5.74 hp. Still too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the power is calculated as the kinetic energy plus the potential energy, but without considering friction.

Wait, but that would be (1/2)ρ v^2 Q + ρ g Q h. Let me compute that.

(1/2)*62.42*(6^2)*0.5236 +62.42*32.174*0.5236*3.

Compute each term:

First term: 0.5 *62.42 *36 *0.5236 ≈0.5 *62.42≈31.21; 31.21 *36≈1123.56; 1123.56 *0.5236≈588.3.

Second term:62.42 *32.174≈2007; 2007 *0.5236≈1052.4; 1052.4 *3≈3157.2.

Total P≈588.3 +3157.2≈3745.5 ft·lbf/s.

Convert to hp:3745.5/550≈6.81 hp. Still too high.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think if I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for power as P = (v^3 * A * ρ)/2, which is the kinetic energy per second.

v=6 ft/s, A=0.08727 ft².

So P = 0.5 *62.42 *6^3 *0.08727.

Compute:

6^3=216.

0.5 *62.42≈31.21.

31.21 *216≈6730.56.

6730.56 *0.08727≈587.3.

Convert to hp:587.3 /550≈1.068 hp. That's close to option E:1.05 hp.

But why would the problem ignore the elevation and friction? Because maybe the problem is considering only the kinetic energy, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using only the potential energy, which would be P= (ρ g Q h)/550.

So P= (62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *3)/550≈5.74 hp, which isn't an option.

Wait, but if I use only the elevation and not the friction, and use the formula P= (ρ g Q h)/550, then 62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *3=62.42*32.174=2007; 2007 *0.5236=1052.4; 1052.4 *3=3157.2; 3157.2 /550≈5.74 hp.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula where power is (1/2) m v^2 + m g h, but without considering the flow rate and time.

Wait, but that's not the right approach. I think I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the head loss calculation. Let me try using the correct f value.

Earlier, using Darcy-Weisbach with f=0.018, h_f≈3.004 ft, h_total=6.004 ft.

P=(62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *6.004)/550≈(62.42 *32.174)=2007; 2007 *0.5236≈1052.4; 1052.4 *6.004≈6319.3; 6319.3/550≈11.49 hp.

Still too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula where power is (v^3 * A * ρ)/2, which I calculated as≈1.068 hp, which is near option E:1.05 hp.

But that would ignore both elevation and friction, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the elevation is already accounted for in the velocity head.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. I'm really stuck. Given the options, the closest I got was around 1.05 hp, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula P = (v^2 * A * ρ)/2, which would be 6^2 *0.08727*62.42 /2.

Compute:

6^2=36.

36 *0.08727≈3.1417.

3.1417 *62.42≈196.4.

196.4 /2=98.2.

Convert to hp:98.2/550≈0.1785 hp, which is about 0.18 hp, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the head loss as 3.356 ft and elevation as 3 ft, but the pump only needs to provide the head loss, not the elevation, but that doesn't make sense because the water is going uphill.

Alternatively, perhaps the elevation is subtracted from the head loss, but that would give a negative head, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the elevation is a gain in head, so the total head is h_f - Δz, but that would be 3.356 -3≈0.356 ft, which would give a lower power.

Let me try that.

h_total=0.356 ft.

P= (62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *0.356)/550.

Compute:

62.42 *32.174≈2007.

2007 *0.5236≈1052.4.

1052.4 *0.356≈374.2.

374.2 /550≈0.68 hp, which is close to option H:0.60 hp.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the elevation is already included in the head loss, but that doesn't align with the Bernoulli equation.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and the closest I can get is around 0.68 hp, which is near option H:0.60 hp. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:0.934 hp.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate the head loss with a more accurate f value.

Earlier, I tried f=0.02 and f=0.018, but perhaps the correct f is around 0.015.

Let me try f=0.015.

h_f=0.015 *300 *0.5568≈0.015*300=4.5; 4.5 *0.5568≈2.5056 ft.

h_total=2.5056+3=5.5056 ft.

P=(62.42*32.174*0.5236*5.5056)/550.

Compute:

62.42*32.174≈2007.

2007 *0.5236≈1052.4.

1052.4 *5.5056≈5795.7.

5795.7 /550≈10.54 hp. Still too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for power as P = (v^3 * A * ρ)/2, which gave me ≈1.068 hp, close to option E:1.05 hp.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to ignore the friction loss and only consider the elevation.

Then, h_total=3 ft.

P=(62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *3)/550≈5.74 hp, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the work done against gravity only, without considering the kinetic energy or friction. So P=(ρ g Q h)/550.

With h=3 ft, that's (62.42 *32.174 *0.5236 *3)/550≈5.74 hp, but that's not an option.

I'm really stuck. Given the options, and the fact that my kinetic energy approach gave me about 1.05 hp, which is option E, I'll go with that.

To determine the power required to maintain the flow of water through the pipe, the analysis involves calculating the head loss due to friction and the elevation difference, then using these to find the total head and subsequently the power.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Flow Rate (Q):**  
   The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the pipe is calculated using the diameter \( D = 4 \, \text{in} = 0.3333 \, \text{ft} \):  
   \[
   A = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.3333}{2}\right)^2 \approx 0.08727 \, \text{ft}^2
   \]  
   With a velocity \( v = 6 \, \text{ft/s} \), the flow rate is:  
   \[
   Q = A \cdot v = 0.08727 \cdot 6 \approx 0.5236 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s}
   \]

2. **Head Loss Due to Friction (\( h_f \)):**  
   Using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:  
   \[
   h_f = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{v^2}{2g}
   \]  
   where \( f \) is the friction factor. For a wrought iron pipe with \( \varepsilon/D = 0.0008 \) and \( \text{Re} = \frac{vD}{\nu} \approx 1.69 \times 10^5 \), the friction factor \( f \) is approximately \( 0.02 \). Substituting values:  
   \[
   h_f = 0.02 \cdot \frac{100}{0.3333} \cdot \frac{6^2}{2 \cdot 32.174} \approx 3.356 \, \text{ft}
   \]

3. **Total Head (\( h_{\text{total}} \)):**  
   The outlet is \( 3 \, \text{ft} \) higher than the inlet, so the total head is:  
   \[
   h_{\text{total}} = h_f + \Delta z = 3.356 + 3 = 6.356 \, \text{ft}
   \]

4. **Power Calculation:**  
   The power required is given by:  
   \[
   P = \frac{\rho \cdot g \cdot Q \cdot h_{\text{total}}}{550}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \rho = 62.42 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3 \), \( g = 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), \( Q = 0.5236 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \), and \( h_{\text{total}} = 6.356 \, \text{ft} \):  
   \[
   P = \frac{62.42 \cdot 32.174 \cdot 0.5236 \cdot 6.356}{550} \approx 12.14 \, \text{hp}
   \]  
   This result is inconsistent with the provided options, suggesting a potential error in assumptions or approximations.

5. **Revisiting the Options:**  
   Considering the possibility of neglecting friction or elevation effects, the power due to elevation alone is recalculated:  
   \[
   P = \frac{\rho \cdot g \cdot Q \cdot \Delta z}{550} = \frac{62.42 \cdot 32.174 \cdot 0.5236 \cdot 3}{550} \approx 5.74 \, \text{hp}
   \]  
   This still does not match the options. However, using the kinetic energy formula:  
   \[
   P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot v^3 \cdot A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 62.42 \cdot 6^3 \cdot 0.08727 \approx 1.068 \, \text{hp}
   \]  
   This is close to option **E: 1.05 hp**.

### Conclusion:
Given the inconsistencies and approximations, the closest match to the calculations is **E: 1.05 hp**.
