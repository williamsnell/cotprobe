Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Poisson random variables. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says: X₁ and X₂ are independent Poisson random variables with means λ₁=2 and λ₂=3. I need to find P(X₁=3, X₂=5). The hint says this event happens if and only if either {X₁=1, X₂=0} or {X₁=0, X₂=1}. Hmm, that's interesting. So, I think I need to calculate the probability of those two events and add them together because they are mutually exclusive.

Wait, why are those the cases? Oh, right, because X₁ and X₂ are independent, so the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities. But wait, the problem is asking for P(X₁=3, X₂=5). How does that connect to X₁=1 and X₂=0, etc.?

Oh, wait a second. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. Oh no, wait, no. The question is actually part (a), and the hint is pointing out that P(X₁=3, X₂=5) is equivalent to the union of P(X₁=1, X₂=0) or P(X₁=0, X₂=1). That's confusing. How does that make sense?

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think. Oh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually about the sum of X₁ and X₂? Because if X₁ and X₂ are Poisson, their sum is also Poisson with parameter λ₁ + λ₂. But the question isn't about their sum, it's about the joint probability P(X₁=3, X₂=5). So, why is the hint suggesting considering X₁=1, X₂=0 or X₁=0, X₂=1?

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about a typo? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again carefully.

Wait, the problem says: "Find P(X₁=3, X₂=5)." But the hint says this event can occur if and only if either {X₁=1, X₂=0} or {X₁=0, X₂=1}. That doesn't make sense directly. Because P(X₁=3, X₂=5) is a separate event from those two. Unless the hint is referring to some conditional probability or perhaps a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Oh! Wait, perhaps the original problem is about P(X₁ + X₂ = 8) or something else, but the user wrote it as P(X₁=3, X₂=5). Wait, no, the user wrote 5.3-1. Let me check again.

No, the problem is definitely P(X₁=3, X₂=5). So why is the hint suggesting considering {X₁=1, X₂=0} or {X₁=0, X₂=1}? That doesn't align. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait a minute, maybe the problem was supposed to be P(X₁ + X₂ = 8), but the user wrote P(X₁=3, X₂=5). Because P(X₁=3, X₂=5) is straightforward—just the product of their individual probabilities since they're independent. But the hint suggests it's related to X₁=1 and X₂=0 or the other way around.

Hmm, perhaps the question is actually about something else, or maybe the hint is for a different part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the hint is correct for this problem. Let me try to make sense of it.

Wait, maybe the hint is trying to say that the event {X₁=3, X₂=5} can be broken down into two mutually exclusive events: one where X₁=1 and X₂=0, and another where X₁=0 and X₂=1. But I don't see how those relate directly. Unless there's a transformation or a condition I'm missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves conditional probabilities, like given that the sum is a certain value. But without more context, it's hard to say. Let me try to proceed as if the hint is correct and I need to compute the probabilities of those two events and add them.

So, the hint says P(X₁=3, X₂=5) = P(X₁=1, X₂=0) + P(X₁=0, X₂=1). Since X₁ and X₂ are independent, the joint probabilities are the product of their individual probabilities.

So, let's compute each term.

First, P(X₁=1) for a Poisson variable with λ₁=2 is (e^{-2} * 2^1)/1! = (e^{-2} * 2)/1 = 2e^{-2}.

P(X₂=0) for λ₂=3 is (e^{-3} * 3^0)/0! = e^{-3}.

So, P(X₁=1, X₂=0) = P(X₁=1) * P(X₂=0) = (2e^{-2}) * e^{-3} = 2e^{-5}.

Next, P(X₁=0) is e^{-2} for λ₁=2.

P(X₂=1) is (e^{-3} * 3^1)/1! = 3e^{-3}.

So, P(X₁=0, X₂=1) = e^{-2} * 3e^{-3} = 3e^{-5}.

Adding these two probabilities together: 2e^{-5} + 3e^{-5} = 5e^{-5}.

Now, let's compute 5e^{-5}.

First, e^{-5} is approximately 0.006737947.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.006737947 ≈ 0.033689735.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.0337. The options are around 0.01 to 0.0245. So that's confusing. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the hint. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about P(X₁=3, X₂=5) without any relation to those other events, and the hint is incorrect or irrelevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the sum X₁ + X₂ = 8, which would make more sense with the hint, because P(X₁ + X₂ =8) can be found by summing over all combinations where X₁ + X₂ =8, like X₁=1, X₂=7; X₁=2, X₂=6; up to X₁=8, X₂=0. But the hint only mentions two cases, which might be a mistake.

Wait, but the original problem is P(X₁=3, X₂=5), so perhaps the hint is incorrect or perhaps I'm misapplying it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find P(X₁=3) + P(X₂=5), but that's not the same as P(X₁=3, X₂=5). Wait, no, because the question clearly states P(X₁=3, X₂=5), which is a joint probability. Since X₁ and X₂ are independent, it's P(X₁=3) * P(X₂=5).

Let me compute that directly, ignoring the hint. Maybe the hint is for another part or perhaps misleading.

Compute P(X₁=3) with λ₁=2: (e^{-2} * 2^3)/3! = (8 e^{-2}) / 6 ≈ (8 * 0.135335)/6 ≈ (1.08268)/6 ≈ 0.180446.

P(X₂=5) with λ₂=3: (e^{-3} * 3^5)/5! = (243 e^{-3}) / 120 ≈ (243 * 0.049787)/120 ≈ (12.088)/120 ≈ 0.10073.

Multiply them together: 0.180446 * 0.10073 ≈ 0.0182.

Looking at the options, E is 0.0182. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier when I followed the hint, I got 0.0337, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the hint is either incorrect or I misapplied it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was intended to be about the sum, but the question is written as P(X₁=3, X₂=5), which is a joint probability. So in that case, the correct approach is to compute P(X₁=3) * P(X₂=5) because they're independent.

So, the correct calculation would be as I did above, leading to approximately 0.0182, which is option E.

The problem involves finding the joint probability \( P(X_1=3, X_2=5) \) where \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent Poisson random variables with means \( \lambda_1 = 2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 3 \), respectively. 

Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities:

1. Compute \( P(X_1=3) \) using the Poisson formula:
   \[
   P(X_1=3) = \frac{e^{-2} \cdot 2^3}{3!} \approx 0.1804
   \]

2. Compute \( P(X_2=5) \) using the Poisson formula:
   \[
   P(X_2=5) = \frac{e^{-3} \cdot 3^5}{5!} \approx 0.1007
   \]

3. Multiply the two probabilities:
   \[
   P(X_1=3, X_2=5) = 0.1804 \times 0.1007 \approx 0.0182
   \]

The correct answer is E: 0.0182.
