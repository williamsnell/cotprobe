Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes."
Germania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I have this question from Tacitus's Germania, and I need to figure out what the excerpt is showing about Roman society. Let me read through it again to make sure I get the details right.

The passage talks about how the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes came in and drove out the Bructeri, who had been there before. Tacitus mentions that they did this with the help of neighboring tribes, possibly because they hated the Bructeri's tyranny, were attracted by plunder, or because the gods favored them. He also says that over sixty thousand Bructeri were killed, not by Romans but by the other tribes. Tacitus then prays that the tribes will either love the Romans or at least hate each other, because while the empire's destiny pushes them on, having their enemies divided is the greatest good fortune.

Hmm, so the question is about what this reflects in Roman society. The options are A through D.

Option A: Disgust for barbarian peoples. Well, Tacitus is a Roman author, but here he's describing the actions of other Germanic tribes. He seems to be saying that it's good that the Bructeri were exterminated, perhaps because they were tyrants. But does that show disgust for all barbarians? I'm not sure. He might be more focused on the political situation than pure disgust.

Option B: Concern about barbarian attacks. The passage is about the Bructeri being defeated by other tribes, not necessarily about attacks on Romans. The Romans didn't do the fighting here, so maybe this isn't about concern for attacks on Rome.

Option C: Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy. Stoicism is about accepting what happens and being indifferent to pleasure and pain. Tacitus is expressing hope and emotion here, hoping that the tribes will either love or hate each other. That seems more emotional than Stoic, which might suggest a lack of Stoicism. But I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option D: Maintenance of large armies. The passage doesn't mention Roman armies being involved in the conflict. It's about other tribes fighting among themselves, so maybe not about maintaining armies.

Wait, going back to the passage: Tacitus is happy that the Bructeri were defeated, not by Romans but by other tribes. He's expressing a preference for internal conflicts among barbarians, which would reduce their threat to Rome. So he's probably relieved that the Bructeri are gone, and he hopes that other tribes will keep fighting each other. This suggests that the Romans are concerned about the barbarians, perhaps because they're a potential threat. But the excerpt isn't directly about attacks on Rome; it's more about the internal dynamics among the barbarian tribes.

So looking at the options again, B is about concern about attacks. But the passage is more about the internal conflicts leading to the weakening of the barbarians, which would benefit Rome. So maybe it's not about concern for attacks but more about the Romans' desire for the barbarians to fight among themselves, which would reduce their threat.

But the options don't have that. The closest is B: Concern about barbarian attacks. Alternatively, perhaps the passage reflects a Roman policy or viewpoint that it's better for barbarians to fight each other rather than unite against Rome. So the view is that having the barbarians divided is good for Rome, which ties into the idea of concern about their potential threat.

Alternatively, maybe the passage is showing that Romans are happy when barbarians eliminate each other without Roman intervention, which might tie into a strategy of divide and conquer. But I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Wait, the question is asking what the views expressed are best seen as evidence of in Roman society. Tacitus is writing from a Roman perspective, and he's happy that the Bructeri were exterminated, which he attributes to either hatred of tyranny, plunder, or divine favor. He's probably reflecting Roman attitudes towards barbariansâ€”maybe a mixture of approval for their downfall but possibly also concern about their power.

But looking at the options, B is Concern about barbarian attacks. The fact that the Romans are happy that another tribe drove out the Bructeri suggests that they were worried about the Bructeri's power. So the view is that barbarians could be a threat, hence the concern.

Alternatively, option A is disgust, but Tacitus is more celebrating the outcome than expressing disgust. He's not denigrating all barbarians, just the Bructeri for being tyrants.

So I think the best answer is B: Concern about barbarian attacks. The passage shows that the Romans are concerned about the barbarian tribes because they could be a threat, so they're happy when other tribes defeat them.

The passage from Tacitus reflects a Roman perspective on the conflict between the Chamavi, Angrivarii, and Bructeri. Tacitus is celebrating the extermination of the Bructeri, attributing it to either hatred of tyranny, plunder, or divine favor. He expresses hope that the tribes will either love the Romans or at least hate each other, as this would weaken their threat to Rome. The key sentiment is the concern about the potential danger posed by barbarian tribes, as evidenced by the Roman desire for internal conflict among them.

Answer: B
