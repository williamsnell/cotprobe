Okay, so I need to figure out how much Jim Smith has in his savings account on July 1. The problem involves multiple transactions and compound interest, which I'm a bit rusty on, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let me list all the transactions:

- April 3: Deposit $792.81 (this is the initial amount)
- April 25: Withdraw $260
- May 5: Deposit $200
- June 9: Deposit $271.50
- June 16: Deposit $544.53

Interest is compounded quarterly at 5%. Hmm, so each quarter, the interest is calculated on the current balance and added. But in this case, the deposits and withdrawals happen on specific dates, so I think I need to calculate the interest between each transaction date and the next.

Wait, but the interest is compounded quarterly, which usually means every three months. But here, the dates are monthly, so maybe each period between transactions is less than a quarter? Or perhaps each transaction is considered as an event that changes the principal, and the interest is calculated in each period from the day of deposit to the day of withdrawal or next transaction.

Let me clarify: The interest is compounded quarterly, meaning each quarter (3 months), the interest is applied. So the periods are March 31, June 30, September 30, etc. But the transactions happen on April 3, April 25, May 5, June 9, and June 16. So I need to figure out how much time each balance is held for, and apply the interest accordingly.

Wait, but the problem says "from day of deposit to day of withdrawal." So each deposit earns interest until it's withdrawn, and each withdrawal affects the balance. So it's more like each deposit is a separate principal for the time it's in the account until the next transaction.

So maybe I should calculate the interest for each deposit period individually.

Let me outline the timeline and the periods each deposit is in the account:

1. April 3 deposit: $792.81
   - Withdrawn on April 25. So the period is from April 3 to April 25.
   - Then, after withdrawal, a deposit on May 5 of $200. So that $200 is in the account from May 5 until next transaction, which is June 9.
   - Then another deposit on June 9: $271.50. So this is added to the balance, which now includes the $200. So from June 9 to June 16, the balance is increased by $271.50.
   - Then on June 16, deposit $544.53. So this amount is deposited, and we need to calculate interest from June 16 to July 1.

Wait, but the interest is compounded quarterly at 5%, so each quarter's interest is 5% / 4 = 1.25% per quarter. But since the time periods here are less than a quarter, I think we'll need to calculate the interest for each period using simple interest formula because the periods are less than a quarter, and each period is treated as a separate event.

Wait, compound interest is typically calculated at specific intervals. If the interest is compounded quarterly, but the time between transactions is less than a quarter, perhaps each deposit earns interest for a fraction of the quarter based on the number of days.

Alternatively, maybe each transaction is treated as a separate principal, and the interest is calculated from the day it's deposited until the next transaction or the end date (July 1).

So perhaps I should model each transaction as a separate principal with its own period, and calculate the interest for each period.

Let me structure this:

1. April 3: Deposit $792.81. Withdrawn on April 25. So the period is 22 days (from April 3 to April 25 inclusive? Wait, April has 30 days, so April 3 to April 25 is 23 days (including both start and end days). Wait, April 3 to April 25: from 3rd to 25th, that's 25 -3 = 22 days, but since both days are included, it's 23 days. Hmm, but sometimes when calculating days between dates, you subtract the start date from the end date and add one day if including both. So 25-3=22, plus 1 is 23 days.

But maybe it's better to use the exact number of days between the two dates. Let me check:

April 3 to April 25: 25 -3 = 22 days. So from April 3 (day 1) to April 25 (day 23), that's 22 days passed. Wait, no, the number of days between April 3 and April 25 is 22 days. Because if you count April 3 as day 0, then April 4 is day 1, and so on until April 25 is day 22. So the period is 22 days.

Then, the next deposit is on May 5. So from April 25 to May 5 is how many days? April 25 to May 5: April has 30 days, so April 25 to April 30 is 6 days, and May 1 to May 5 is 5 days, total 11 days. So that's 11 days.

Then, on May 5, $200 is deposited. Then, next transaction is on June 9. So from May 5 to June 9: May has 31 days, so from May 5 to May 31 is 27 days, and June 1 to June 9 is 9 days, total 36 days.

Then, on June 9, $271.50 is deposited. Next transaction is on June 16: that's 7 days.

Then, on June 16, $544.53 is deposited. Then, we're looking up to July 1, which is 16 days later (June 16 to July 1 is 16 days, since June has 30 days, so 30-16=14 days in June, plus 1 day in July: 15 days? Wait, let me count: June 16 to June 30 is 15 days (including June 16?), no, from June 16 to June 30 is 15 days (June 16 is day 1, June 17 day 2, ..., June 30 day 15). Then July 1 is day 16. So the period is 16 days.

Hmm, maybe it's better to calculate each period's exact days.

So the plan is:

- For each deposit, calculate the number of days it's in the account until the next transaction or until July 1.

- For each period, calculate the interest earned on that deposit using the formula:

Interest = Principal × (1 + r)^(t), where r is the quarterly interest rate and t is the fraction of the quarter.

Wait, but if the interest is compounded quarterly, that means interest is added every 3 months. So if a deposit is held for, say, 22 days, that's less than a quarter (which is about 90 days). So the interest for that period would be calculated as simple interest? Or is it compounded daily? Wait, the problem says interest is compounded quarterly, so I think it's compounded once every three months, meaning that each deposit earns interest only at the end of each quarter. But since the transactions happen mid-quarter, perhaps the interest is calculated as if it's compounded at the quarterly rate for the fraction of the quarter that the money was in the account.

Alternatively, perhaps each deposit earns interest at 5% per annum, compounded quarterly, but the time is a fraction of a year. Wait, no, because compound interest typically compounds at fixed intervals, so in this case, every three months. So if a deposit is in the account for less than a quarter, it doesn't earn any compound interest, only simple interest. But the problem says "interest was compounded quarterly at 5% from day of deposit to day of withdrawal." Hmm, maybe it's considering the time between deposit and withdrawal as the period, and the interest is calculated using the quarterly rate, but for the exact number of days.

Wait, perhaps each deposit is treated as a separate principal, and the interest is calculated for each period between the deposit and the next transaction, using the quarterly rate but for the exact number of days.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the interest for each transaction period using the simple interest formula, but with the quarterly rate. Because compounding quarterly would mean that each period's interest is based on the quarterly rate applied to the number of days.

Wait, but let me think: The quarterly rate is 5% per annum, so each quarter, the interest rate is 5% / 4 = 1.25%. So each quarter, the balance is multiplied by 1.0125.

But if a deposit is in the account for only a fraction of a quarter, like 22 days, then the interest would be 1.25% * (22/90), since a quarter is 90 days. Or maybe it's using 365 days in a year, so 22/365.

Wait, but the problem says "compounded quarterly," which implies that the interest is applied once every three months. So if a deposit is made on April 3 and withdrawn on April 25, which is within the same quarter (assuming the quarter starts on April 1), then it's less than a quarter, so no compounding occurs. The interest would be simple interest for 22 days at the quarterly rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as if it's compounded daily at the quarterly rate. But I'm not sure. The problem states it's compounded quarterly, so perhaps each period between transactions is treated with the quarterly rate as a simple interest.

Alternatively, maybe each deposit is in the account for a certain number of days, and the interest is calculated as (1 + (5% / 365) * days) for each deposit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the interest is compounded daily at the quarterly rate. Because otherwise, if it's compounded quarterly, and the time between transactions is less than a quarter, it's unclear how to calculate the interest. So maybe the interest is calculated as simple interest for each period, using the quarterly rate.

Wait, let's see the options. The options are all small amounts, like around $10 to $25. So perhaps the total interest is small, which would make sense if the periods are short and the rate is 5%.

Alternatively, maybe each deposit is held for a certain number of days, and the interest is calculated for each deposit at the quarterly rate, but using the exact number of days.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, list all the transactions with their dates and amounts:

1. April 3: Deposit $792.81
2. April 25: Withdraw $260
3. May 5: Deposit $200
4. June 9: Deposit $271.50
5. June 16: Deposit $544.53

We need to calculate the balance on July 1, considering each deposit earns interest from the day it's deposited until the next transaction or July 1.

Let me break down each period:

1. April 3 to April 25: 22 days (as calculated earlier)
   - Deposit: $792.81
   - Withdrawal on April 25: $260, so the balance after withdrawal is $792.81 - $260 = $532.81
   - But wait, the $792.81 is deposited on April 3, and withdrawn on April 25. So during this period, the balance is $792.81 for 22 days. Then, on April 25, it's withdrawn, leaving $532.81 in the account?

Wait, no. Wait, if he withdraws $260 on April 25, that means the balance on April 25 after withdrawal is $792.81 - $260 = $532.81. But before that, from April 3 to April 25, the $792.81 was in the account. So the interest on this deposit is for 22 days.

Then, after withdrawal, on April 25, the balance is $532.81. But then, the next transaction is on May 5: deposit $200. So from April 25 to May 5, that's 11 days. So the $532.81 is in the account for 11 days, and then on May 5, $200 is added, making the balance $532.81 + $200 = $732.81.

Then, from May 5 to June 9: that's 35 days (May has 31 days, so May 5 to May 31 is 27 days, plus June 1 to June 9 is 9 days, total 36 days). Wait, May 5 to May 31 is 27 days (including May 5?), no, from May 5 to May 31 is 27 days: May 5 is day 1, May 6 day 2,... May 31 day 27. Then June 1 to June 9 is 9 days. So total 36 days.

So the $732.81 is in the account for 36 days, then on June 9, $271.50 is deposited, making the balance $732.81 + $271.50 = $1,004.31.

Then, from June 9 to June 16: 7 days. So $1,004.31 is in the account for 7 days, then on June 16, $544.53 is deposited, making the balance $1,004.31 + $544.53 = $1,548.84.

Then, from June 16 to July 1: 16 days. So the balance is $1,548.84 for 16 days.

Wait, but each of these periods needs to have interest calculated. So for each deposit, we need to calculate the interest earned during the period it was in the account.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each transaction and the interest earned between them.

Let me structure this as a table:

1. April 3: Deposit $792.81. Interest from April 3 to April 25 (22 days). Then withdrawn on April 25.
2. April 25: Withdraw $260. So the balance after withdrawal is $792.81 - $260 = $532.81. This amount is in the account from April 25 to May 5 (11 days).
3. May 5: Deposit $200. Now balance is $532.81 + $200 = $732.81. This is in the account from May 5 to June 9 (35 days).
4. June 9: Deposit $271.50. Balance becomes $732.81 + $271.50 = $1,004.31. This is in the account from June 9 to June 16 (7 days).
5. June 16: Deposit $544.53. Balance becomes $1,004.31 + $544.53 = $1,548.84. This is in the account from June 16 to July 1 (16 days).

Wait, but the interest is compounded quarterly at 5%. So each deposit earns interest for the number of days it's in the account, but the rate is 5% per annum, compounded quarterly.

So perhaps the interest rate per day can be calculated as (1 + 0.05/4)^(1/90) - 1, but that's for daily compounding. Alternatively, since the problem says it's compounded quarterly, perhaps each deposit's interest is calculated as simple interest for the number of days it's in the account, using the quarterly rate.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the daily interest rate and apply it to each period.

The quarterly rate is 5% per annum, so the daily rate would be 0.05 / 365 ≈ 0.000136986.

But if it's compounded quarterly, then the effective daily rate is (1 + 0.05/4)^(1/90) - 1, which is approximately 0.0006406 per day.

But I'm getting confused. Maybe the problem simplifies it by using the quarterly rate as a simple interest rate for the period.

So for each deposit, the interest earned is Principal × (5% / 4) × (days / 90). Because each quarter is 90 days, and the rate is 5% per quarter.

Wait, that might make sense. So for each deposit, the interest is calculated as:

Interest = Principal × (5% / 4) × (days in period / 90)

Because 5% is the annual rate, but compounded quarterly, so each quarter's rate is 1.25% (5% / 4).

So for a deposit held for 'd' days, the interest is Principal × (1.25% / 90) × d.

Wait, but 1.25% is the rate for the entire quarter, so if the deposit is held for 'd' days, the fraction of the quarter is d/90, and the interest is Principal × 1.25% × (d/90).

Yes, that seems reasonable.

So let's calculate the interest for each period.

1. April 3 to April 25: 22 days
   - Principal: $792.81
   - Interest: 792.81 × (0.0125) × (22/90)
   - Let's compute that:
     0.0125 × 22/90 = 0.0125 × 0.2444 ≈ 0.003055
     792.81 × 0.003055 ≈ $2.425
   - So interest earned: ~$2.43
   - But wait, he withdraws $260 on April 25, so the balance after withdrawal is $792.81 + $2.43 - $260 = $792.81 - $260 + $2.43 = $535.24

Wait, but actually, the interest is earned on the deposit until it's withdrawn, so the interest is added to the principal before the withdrawal.

So the balance before withdrawal is $792.81 + interest.

So the interest is $2.43, so the balance before withdrawal is $792.81 + $2.43 = $795.24. Then he withdraws $260, so the balance after withdrawal is $795.24 - $260 = $535.24.

Okay, that makes sense.

Next period:

2. April 25 to May 5: 11 days
   - Principal: $535.24
   - Interest: 535.24 × 0.0125 × (11/90)
   - 0.0125 × 11/90 ≈ 0.0013889
   - 535.24 × 0.0013889 ≈ $0.743
   - So interest earned: ~$0.74
   - On May 5, he deposits $200, so the new balance is $535.24 + $0.74 + $200 = $735.98

Wait, but wait: the $535.24 is in the account for 11 days, earning $0.74, so the balance on May 5 before the deposit is $535.24 + $0.74 = $535.98. Then he deposits $200, making it $535.98 + $200 = $735.98.

Next period:

3. May 5 to June 9: 35 days
   - Principal: $735.98
   - Interest: 735.98 × 0.0125 × (35/90)
   - 0.0125 × 35/90 ≈ 0.004861
   - 735.98 × 0.004861 ≈ $3.58
   - So interest earned: ~$3.58
   - On June 9, he deposits $271.50, so the balance before deposit is $735.98 + $3.58 = $739.56. Then adding $271.50 gives $739.56 + $271.50 = $1,011.06

Wait, but let me check: May 5 to June 9 is 35 days. So the calculation is correct.

Next period:

4. June 9 to June 16: 7 days
   - Principal: $1,011.06
   - Interest: 1,011.06 × 0.0125 × (7/90)
   - 0.0125 × 7/90 ≈ 0.0009722
   - 1,011.06 × 0.0009722 ≈ $0.983
   - So interest earned: ~$0.98
   - On June 16, he deposits $544.53, so the balance before deposit is $1,011.06 + $0.98 = $1,012.04. Adding $544.53 gives $1,012.04 + $544.53 = $1,556.57

Next period:

5. June 16 to July 1: 16 days
   - Principal: $1,556.57
   - Interest: 1,556.57 × 0.0125 × (16/90)
   - 0.0125 × 16/90 ≈ 0.002222
   - 1,556.57 × 0.002222 ≈ $3.46
   - So interest earned: ~$3.46
   - Since we're calculating up to July 1, this interest is added, so the final balance is $1,556.57 + $3.46 = $1,560.03

Wait, but let me check the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First period: April 3-25 (22 days)
- Principal: $792.81
- Interest: 792.81 * 0.0125 * (22/90) = 792.81 * 0.0125 * 0.2444 ≈ 792.81 * 0.003055 ≈ 2.425
- So balance before withdrawal: 792.81 + 2.425 ≈ 795.235
- Withdraw $260: 795.235 - 260 = 535.235 ≈ $535.24

Second period: April 25-May 5 (11 days)
- Principal: $535.24
- Interest: 535.24 * 0.0125 * (11/90) ≈ 535.24 * 0.0125 * 0.1222 ≈ 535.24 * 0.001528 ≈ 0.816
Wait, earlier I calculated 0.74, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:
0.0125 * 11 = 0.1375
0.1375 /90 ≈ 0.001528
535.24 * 0.001528 ≈ 535.24 * 0.001528 ≈ 0.816
So interest ≈ $0.816
- So balance before deposit: 535.24 + 0.816 ≈ 536.056
- Deposit $200: 536.056 + 200 = 736.056 ≈ $736.06

Third period: May 5-June 9 (35 days)
- Principal: $736.06
- Interest: 736.06 * 0.0125 * (35/90) ≈ 736.06 * 0.0125 * 0.3889 ≈ 736.06 * 0.004861 ≈ 3.59
- So balance before deposit: 736.06 + 3.59 ≈ 739.65
- Deposit $271.50: 739.65 + 271.50 = 1,011.15

Fourth period: June 9-June 16 (7 days)
- Principal: $1,011.15
- Interest: 1,011.15 * 0.0125 * (7/90) ≈ 1,011.15 * 0.0125 * 0.0778 ≈ 1,011.15 * 0.000972 ≈ 0.983
- So balance before deposit: 1,011.15 + 0.983 ≈ 1,012.13
- Deposit $544.53: 1,012.13 + 544.53 ≈ 1,556.66

Fifth period: June 16-July 1 (16 days)
- Principal: $1,556.66
- Interest: 1,556.66 * 0.0125 * (16/90) ≈ 1,556.66 * 0.0125 * 0.1778 ≈ 1,556.66 * 0.002222 ≈ 3.46
- So balance on July 1: 1,556.66 + 3.46 ≈ $1,560.12

Wait, but the options are all much smaller, like around $10-25. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by treating each deposit as a separate principal. Maybe the correct approach is to track the balance day by day, adding interest as it compounds quarterly, but considering each transaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is applied quarterly, so each deposit's interest is calculated only at the end of each quarter, but the transactions happen mid-quarter, so the balance is adjusted before the interest is applied.

Wait, let's think differently. The interest is compounded quarterly, which typically means that interest is added once every three months. So if a deposit is made on April 3, which is within the first quarter (assuming the quarter starts on January 1), then the interest would be added on June 30, but since the deposit is withdrawn on April 25, before the end of the quarter, the interest for that deposit wouldn't be credited because it was withdrawn before the compounding date.

But this approach might not account for the exact days, so perhaps the interest is calculated as if it's simple interest for the time the money was in the account, using the quarterly rate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the interest for each deposit as simple interest, using the quarterly rate, for the number of days it was in the account.

So, the quarterly rate is 5% per annum, so the daily rate is 5% / 365 ≈ 0.000136986 per day.

But the problem says it's compounded quarterly, so perhaps each deposit's interest is calculated as Principal × (1 + (0.05/4) × (days/90)).

Wait, let's try that.

So for each deposit, the interest is:

Interest = Principal × (1 + (0.05/4) × (days/90)) - Principal

But let's compute each period again with this formula.

1. April 3 to April 25: 22 days
   Principal: $792.81
   Interest: 792.81 × (1 + (0.05/4) × (22/90)) - 792.81
   = 792.81 × (1 + 0.0125 × 0.2444) - 792.81
   = 792.81 × (1 + 0.003055) - 792.81
   = 792.81 × 1.003055 ≈ 792.81 + 792.81 × 0.003055 ≈ 792.81 + 2.425 ≈ $2.425
   So balance before withdrawal: $792.81 + $2.425 ≈ $795.235
   Withdraw $260: $795.235 - $260 = $535.235

2. April 25 to May 5: 11 days
   Principal: $535.235
   Interest: 535.235 × (1 + 0.0125 × (11/90)) - 535.235
   = 535.235 × (1 + 0.0125 × 0.1222) - 535.235
   = 535.235 × (1 + 0.001528) - 535.235
   = 535.235 × 1.001528 ≈ 535.235 + 535.235 × 0.001528 ≈ 535.235 + 0.816 ≈ $0.816
   So balance before deposit: $535.235 + $0.816 ≈ $536.051
   Deposit $200: $536.051 + $200 = $736.051

3. May 5 to June 9: 35 days
   Principal: $736.051
   Interest: 736.051 × (1 + 0.0125 × (35/90)) - 736.051
   = 736.051 × (1 + 0.0125 × 0.3889) - 736.051
   = 736.051 × (1 + 0.004861) - 736.051
   = 736.051 × 1.004861 ≈ 736.051 + 736.051 × 0.004861 ≈ 736.051 + 3.59 ≈ $3.59
   So balance before deposit: $736.051 + $3.59 ≈ $739.641
   Deposit $271.50: $739.641 + $271.50 ≈ $1,011.141

4. June 9 to June 16: 7 days
   Principal: $1,011.141
   Interest: 1,011.141 × (1 + 0.0125 × (7/90)) - 1,011.141
   = 1,011.141 × (1 + 0.0125 × 0.0778) - 1,011.141
   = 1,011.141 × (1 + 0.000972) - 1,011.141
   = 1,011.141 × 1.000972 ≈ 1,011.141 + 1,011.141 × 0.000972 ≈ 1,011.141 + 0.983 ≈ $0.983
   So balance before deposit: $1,011.141 + $0.983 ≈ $1,012.124
   Deposit $544.53: $1,012.124 + $544.53 ≈ $1,556.654

5. June 16 to July 1: 16 days
   Principal: $1,556.654
   Interest: 1,556.654 × (1 + 0.0125 × (16/90)) - 1,556.654
   = 1,556.654 × (1 + 0.0125 × 0.1778) - 1,556.654
   = 1,556.654 × (1 + 0.002222) - 1,556.654
   = 1,556.654 × 1.002222 ≈ 1,556.654 + 1,556.654 × 0.002222 ≈ 1,556.654 + 3.46 ≈ $3.46
   So balance on July 1: $1,556.654 + $3.46 ≈ $1,560.114

Wait, but the options are all much lower, like single digits. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the compounding. Maybe each deposit is only earning interest for full quarters. So if a deposit is made on April 3, and the next quarter ends on June 30, but the deposit is withdrawn on April 25, which is before the end of the quarter, so no interest is earned.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem says interest is compounded from day of deposit to day of withdrawal.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the balance at the end of each quarter, but the transactions happen mid-quarter, so the balance is adjusted before the interest is applied.

Wait, let's try this approach.

First, identify the quarters:

- Q1: Jan 1 - March 31
- Q2: April 1 - June 30
- Q3: July 1 - Sept 30

So transactions:

- April 3: Deposit $792.81 (Q2)
- April 25: Withdraw $260
- May 5: Deposit $200
- June 9: Deposit $271.50
- June 16: Deposit $544.53

We need to calculate the balance on July 1, which is in Q3.

So let's calculate the interest for each quarter that the money was in.

But the transactions occur mid-quarter, so the balance changes, affecting the interest.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated at the end of each quarter based on the average daily balance during that quarter.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps each deposit is in the account for a certain number of days, and the interest is calculated for each deposit based on the number of days it was in the account, using the quarterly rate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the interest for each deposit separately, using the exact number of days each deposit was in the account, and apply the quarterly rate as simple interest.

So for each deposit:

1. April 3: $792.81
   - Withdrawn on April 25: 22 days
   - Interest: 792.81 × (0.05/4) × (22/90)
   = 792.81 × 0.0125 × 0.2444 ≈ 792.81 × 0.003055 ≈ $2.425
   - So balance after withdrawal: 792.81 + 2.425 - 260 = 535.235

2. April 25: balance is $535.235
   - Next deposit on May 5: 11 days
   - Interest: 535.235 × 0.0125 × (11/90) ≈ 535.235 × 0.001528 ≈ $0.816
   - Balance before deposit: 535.235 + 0.816 ≈ 536.051
   - Deposit $200: 536.051 + 200 = 736.051

3. May 5: $736.051
   - Next transaction on June 9: 35 days
   - Interest: 736.051 × 0.0125 × (35/90) ≈ 736.051 × 0.004861 ≈ $3.59
   - Balance before deposit: 736.051 + 3.59 ≈ 739.641
   - Deposit $271.50: 739.641 + 271.50 ≈ 1,011.141

4. June 9: $1,011.141
   - Next transaction on June 16: 7 days
   - Interest: 1,011.141 × 0.0125 × (7/90) ≈ 1,011.141 × 0.000972 ≈ $0.983
   - Balance before deposit: 1,011.141 + 0.983 ≈ 1,012.124
   - Deposit $544.53: 1,012.124 + 544.53 ≈ 1,556.654

5. June 16: $1,556.654
   - Next date is July 1: 16 days
   - Interest: 1,556.654 × 0.0125 × (16/90) ≈ 1,556.654 × 0.002222 ≈ $3.46
   - Balance on July 1: 1,556.654 + 3.46 ≈ $1,560.11

But again, the options are much smaller. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the quarterly rate as a simple rate, but the correct approach is to compound the interest quarterly, meaning that each deposit's interest is calculated at the end of each quarter, but the transactions happen mid-quarter, so the balance is adjusted before the interest is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the balance at the end of each quarter, and any transactions in between are applied before the interest is added.

So let's try that approach.

First quarter: Q1 (March 31)
- No transactions in Q1, as all transactions start in April.

Q2: April 1 - June 30

Let's break down Q2 into the transactions:

- April 3: Deposit $792.81
- April 25: Withdraw $260
- May 5: Deposit $200
- June 9: Deposit $271.50
- June 16: Deposit $544.53

We need to track the balance and apply interest at the end of Q2, which is June 30.

But the problem asks for the balance on July 1, which is in Q3. So perhaps the interest for Q2 is applied on June 30, and then the transactions on June 9, 16 are before that.

Wait, perhaps the interest is compounded at the end of each quarter, so on June 30, the balance is calculated, interest is added, and then any transactions after that are considered.

But the transactions happen on June 9 and 16, which are before June 30. So the interest for Q2 would be calculated on the balance as of June 30.

Wait, maybe I should track the balance day by day, but it's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the interest for each deposit based on the exact number of days it's in the account, using the daily rate derived from the quarterly rate.

The quarterly rate is 5%, so the daily rate is 5% / 365 ≈ 0.000136986 per day.

So for each deposit, the interest is Principal × (1 + rate × days) - Principal.

Let's try this approach again.

1. April 3: $792.81
   - Withdrawn on April 25: 22 days
   - Interest: 792.81 × (1 + 0.000136986 × 22) - 792.81
   = 792.81 × (1 + 0.0030137) - 792.81
   = 792.81 × 1.0030137 ≈ 792.81 + 792.81 × 0.0030137 ≈ 792.81 + 2.39 ≈ $2.39
   - Balance before withdrawal: 792.81 + 2.39 ≈ $795.20
   - Withdraw $260: 795.20 - 260 = $535.20

2. April 25: $535.20
   - Next transaction on May 5: 11 days
   - Interest: 535.20 × (1 + 0.000136986 × 11) - 535.20
   = 535.20 × (1 + 0.0015068) - 535.20
   = 535.20 × 1.0015068 ≈ 535.20 + 535.20 × 0.0015068 ≈ 535.20 + 0.806 ≈ $0.806
   - Balance before deposit: 535.20 + 0.806 ≈ $536.006
   - Deposit $200: 536.006 + 200 ≈ $736.006

3. May 5: $736.006
   - Next transaction on June 9: 35 days
   - Interest: 736.006 × (1 + 0.000136986 × 35) - 736.006
   = 736.006 × (1 + 0.0047945) - 736.006
   = 736.006 × 1.0047945 ≈ 736.006 + 736.006 × 0.0047945 ≈ 736.006 + 3.525 ≈ $3.525
   - Balance before deposit: 736.006 + 3.525 ≈ $739.531
   - Deposit $271.50: 739.531 + 271.50 ≈ $1,011.031

4. June 9: $1,011.031
   - Next transaction on June 16: 7 days
   - Interest: 1,011.031 × (1 + 0.000136986 × 7) - 1,011.031
   = 1,011.031 × (1 + 0.0009589) - 1,011.031
   = 1,011.031 × 1.0009589 ≈ 1,011.031 + 1,011.031 × 0.0009589 ≈ 1,011.031 + 0.970 ≈ $0.970
   - Balance before deposit: 1,011.031 + 0.970 ≈ $1,012.001
   - Deposit $544.53: 1,012.001 + 544.53 ≈ $1,556.531

5. June 16: $1,556.531
   - Next date is July 1: 16 days
   - Interest: 1,556.531 × (1 + 0.000136986 × 16) - 1,556.531
   = 1,556.531 × (1 + 0.0021918) - 1,556.531
   = 1,556.531 × 1.0021918 ≈ 1,556.531 + 1,556.531 × 0.0021918 ≈ 1,556.531 + 3.409 ≈ $3.409
   - Balance on July 1: 1,556.531 + 3.409 ≈ $1,560. (approximately)

But again, the options are way lower. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the interest is only applied once on the initial deposit, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the interest is compounded quarterly, but the transactions are happening before the end of the quarter, so only the deposits that are in the account for a full quarter earn interest.

Wait, for example:

- The initial deposit on April 3 is in the account until April 25, which is within Q2 (April 1 - June 30). So if the interest is compounded at the end of Q2 (June 30), then the initial deposit would earn interest for the entire Q2, but since it was withdrawn on April 25, it only stayed for 22 days, so it doesn't earn a full quarter's interest.

But this approach is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps the total interest is the sum of the interest from each deposit for the time it was in the account, using the daily rate based on the quarterly rate.

So, the daily rate is 5% / 365 ≈ 0.000136986.

So for each deposit:

1. April 3: $792.81 for 22 days
   Interest: 792.81 × 0.000136986 × 22 ≈ 792.81 × 0.0030137 ≈ $2.39

2. April 25: $535.24 for 11 days
   Interest: 535.24 × 0.000136986 × 11 ≈ 535.24 × 0.0015068 ≈ $0.806

3. May 5: $736.06 for 35 days
   Interest: 736.06 × 0.000136986 × 35 ≈ 736.06 × 0.0047945 ≈ $3.524

4. June 9: $1,011.06 for 7 days
   Interest: 1,011.06 × 0.000136986 ×7 ≈ 1,011.06 × 0.0009589 ≈ $0.970

5. June 16: $1,556.57 for 16 days
   Interest: 1,556.57 × 0.000136986 ×16 ≈ 1,556.57 × 0.0021918 ≈ $3.409

Total interest: 2.39 + 0.806 + 3.524 + 0.970 + 3.409 ≈ $11.10

But the options are all under $25, so maybe the total is around $11, but the options are A:20.38, B:8.50, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me sum them again:

2.39 (April) + 0.806 (April-May) + 3.524 (May-June) + 0.970 (June) + 3.409 (June-July) = 

2.39 + 0.806 = 3.196

3.196 + 3.524 = 6.72

6.72 + 0.970 = 7.69

7.69 + 3.409 ≈ 11.10

So total interest ≈ $11.10

But the options are much lower. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps each deposit is only in the account for a certain number of days, and the interest is calculated using the quarterly rate as simple interest for each period.

Wait, the quarterly rate is 5%, so simple interest per quarter is 5% of the principal.

But if a deposit is in the account for 'd' days, the interest is Principal × (5% × d / 90), since a quarter is 90 days.

So let's recalculate:

1. April 3: $792.81 for 22 days
   Interest: 792.81 × (0.05 × 22 / 90) ≈ 792.81 × (0.011111) ≈ $8.78

2. April 25: $535.24 for 11 days
   Interest: 535.24 × (0.05 × 11 /90) ≈ 535.24 × 0.006111 ≈ $3.27

3. May 5: $736.06 for 35 days
   Interest: 736.06 × (0.05 ×35 /90) ≈ 736.06 × 0.019444 ≈ $14.26

4. June 9: $1,011.06 for 7 days
   Interest: 1,011.06 × (0.05 ×7 /90) ≈ 1,011.06 × 0.003889 ≈ $3.94

5. June 16: $1,556.57 for 16 days
   Interest: 1,556.57 × (0.05 ×16 /90) ≈ 1,556.57 × 0.008889 ≈ $13.83

Total interest: 8.78 + 3.27 + 14.26 + 3.94 + 13.83 ≈ $43.08

But again, this is way higher than the options, so I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the interest is only applied once at the end of the last period. Let me try another approach.

Perhaps the total amount in the account on July 1 is the sum of all deposits minus all withdrawals, plus the interest from each deposit for the time it was in the account.

So:

Total deposits: 792.81 + 200 + 271.50 + 544.53 = 792.81 + 200 = 992.81 + 271.50 = 1,264.31 + 544.53 = 1,808.84

Total withdrawals: 260

Net deposits: 1,808.84 - 260 = 1,548.84

Now, calculate the interest on this net amount for the period from the last deposit (June 16) to July 1 (16 days).

But the net amount is $1,548.84, and it's in the account for 16 days. The quarterly rate is 5%, so daily rate is 0.05/365 ≈ 0.000136986.

Interest: 1,548.84 × 0.000136986 ×16 ≈ 1,548.84 × 0.0021918 ≈ $3.40

So total balance: 1,548.84 + 3.40 ≈ $1,552.24

But this still doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated on each deposit individually, considering the time each was in the account.

So:

1. $792.81 from April 3 to April 25: 22 days
   Interest: 792.81 × (0.05/4) × (22/90) ≈ 792.81 × 0.0125 × 0.2444 ≈ $2.425

2. $200 from May 5 to June 16: 42 days
   Wait, no, May 5 to June 16 is 42 days (May 5 to May 31: 27 days, June 1-16:16 days, total 43 days)
   So 43 days
   Interest: 200 × 0.0125 × (43/90) ≈ 200 × 0.0125 × 0.4778 ≈ 200 × 0.005972 ≈ $1.194

3. $271.50 from June 9 to June 16: 7 days
   Interest: 271.50 × 0.0125 × (7/90) ≈ 271.50 × 0.000972 ≈ $0.264

4. $544.53 from June 16 to July 1: 16 days
   Interest: 544.53 × 0.0125 × (16/90) ≈ 544.53 × 0.002222 ≈ $1.209

Total interest: 2.425 + 1.194 + 0.264 + 1.209 ≈ $5.092

So total balance: (792.81 - 260) + 200 + 271.50 + 544.53 + 5.092 ≈ 532.81 + 200 = 732.81 + 271.50 = 1,004.31 + 544.53 = 1,548.84 +5.092 ≈ $1,553.93

Still not matching the options. I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the interest is only applied once at the end of each quarter. So let's see:

Q2: April 1 - June 30

Deposits in Q2:

- April 3: $792.81
- April 25: Withdraw $260
- May 5: Deposit $200
- June 9: Deposit $271.50
- June 16: Deposit $544.53

The interest for Q2 would be applied on June 30. So let's calculate the balance on June 30.

Let's track the balance day by day up to June 30, then apply Q2's interest, then add any interest for the period after June 30 up to July 1.

But this is getting too involved. Maybe the problem expects a simpler approach, considering only the last deposit earning interest for a short period.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is only on the last deposit, which was on June 16, earning interest from June 16 to July 1 (16 days).

So:

Deposit on June 16: $544.53 for 16 days
Interest: 544.53 × (0.05/4) × (16/90) ≈ 544.53 × 0.0125 × 0.1778 ≈ 544.53 × 0.002222 ≈ $1.209

So total interest: ~$1.21

But the options are all single digits, so maybe the correct answer is around $10, but I'm not getting there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each deposit's interest is calculated only if it was in the account for at least one day. So:

1. April 3: 22 days → interest ~$2.43
2. April 25: 11 days → interest ~$0.81
3. May 5: 35 days → interest ~$3.59
4. June 9:7 days → ~$0.98
5. June 16:16 days → ~$3.46
Total interest: ~$11.27

But the options don't include this.

Wait, looking back at the options, they are all under $25, but my calculations are way higher. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each deposit only earns interest from the day it's deposited until the next transaction, but the interest is calculated using the quarterly rate as simple interest for the exact number of days.

Let me try this again with precise calculations:

1. April 3: $792.81 for 22 days
   Interest: 792.81 × (0.05/4) × (22/90) = 792.81 × 0.0125 × 0.2444 ≈ 792.81 × 0.003055 ≈ $2.425

2. April 25: balance after withdrawal is $535.24, which stays until May 5 (11 days)
   Interest: 535.24 × 0.0125 × (11/90) ≈ 535.24 × 0.001528 ≈ $0.816

3. May 5: balance is $736.06, stays until June 9 (35 days)
   Interest: 736.06 × 0.0125 × (35/90) ≈ 736.06 × 0.004861 ≈ $3.585

4. June 9: balance is $1,011.15, stays until June 16 (7 days)
   Interest: 1,011.15 × 0.0125 × (7/90) ≈ 1,011.15 × 0.000972 ≈ $0.983

5. June 16: balance is $1,556.68, stays until July 1 (16 days)
   Interest: 1,556.68 × 0.0125 × (16/90) ≈ 1,556.68 × 0.002222 ≈ $3.46

Total interest: 2.425 + 0.816 + 3.585 + 0.983 + 3.46 ≈ $11.27

But the options don't match. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the interest is only calculated on the balance after all transactions, not on each deposit. So the net balance is $1,548.84, and it's in the account for 16 days, earning interest.

So:

Interest: 1,548.84 × (0.05/4) × (16/90) ≈ 1,548.84 × 0.0125 × 0.1778 ≈ 1,548.84 × 0.002222 ≈ $3.44

So total balance: $1,548.84 + $3.44 ≈ $1,552.28

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the interest is only on the last deposit, which was on June 16 for 16 days:

Interest: 544.53 × 0.0125 × (16/90) ≈ 544.53 × 0.002222 ≈ $1.209

So total balance: 1,548.84 + 1.209 ≈ $1,550.05

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: $22.47, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is only calculated on the last deposit, which was on June 16, and it's in the account for 16 days, so:

Interest: 544.53 × 0.000136986 ×16 ≈ 544.53 × 0.0021918 ≈ $1.209

So total interest: ~$1.21, so balance: $1,548.84 + $1.21 ≈ $1,550.05

But again, not matching the options.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. The options are all around $10, so perhaps the correct answer is E: $22.47.

Wait, but wait. Let me try a different approach: perhaps the interest is calculated on the balance at the end of each month.

But that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the interest to be calculated as simple interest for each period using the daily rate.

Let me try that:

Daily rate: 0.05/365 ≈ 0.000136986

1. April 3: $792.81 for 22 days
   Interest: 792.81 × 0.000136986 ×22 ≈ 792.81 × 0.0030137 ≈ $2.39

2. April 25: $535.24 for 11 days
   Interest: 535.24 × 0.000136986 ×11 ≈ 535.24 × 0.0015068 ≈ $0.806

3. May 5: $736.06 for 35 days
   Interest: 736.06 × 0.000136986 ×35 ≈ 736.06 × 0.0047945 ≈ $3.524

4. June 9: $1,011.06 for 7 days
   Interest: 1,011.06 × 0.000136986 ×7 ≈ 1,011.06 × 0.0009589 ≈ $0.970

5. June 16: $1,556.57 for 16 days
   Interest: 1,556.57 × 0.000136986 ×16 ≈ 1,556.57 × 0.0021918 ≈ $3.409

Total interest: 2.39 + 0.806 + 3.524 + 0.970 + 3.409 ≈ $11.10

So total balance: 1,548.84 + 11.10 ≈ $1,560. (approximately)

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the interest is only applied on the initial deposit, and the others are considered to have no time to earn interest. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the interest is compounded quarterly, so each deposit's interest is calculated at the end of each quarter, and since all transactions are before the end of Q2 (June 30), only the initial deposit earns interest for the full quarter, but it was withdrawn, so no interest.

But this approach would result in very little interest, perhaps matching the options.

Wait, let's see:

- The initial deposit on April 3 was withdrawn on April 25, so it didn't stay for a full quarter, so no interest.

- The $200 deposited on May 5 would be in the account until June 30, which is 56 days (May 5 to June 30). Since it's less than a quarter, no interest.

- The $271.50 on June 9 is in the account for 22 days (June 9 to June 30), so no interest.

- The $544.53 on June 16 is in the account for 15 days (June 16 to June 30), so no interest.

So total interest: $0

But that can't be right because the options don't include zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated at the end of each month, but that's not what the problem says.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess. Given the options, and the fact that my calculations are not matching, perhaps the correct answer is E: $22.47.

Wait, but I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try to calculate the interest for each deposit using the quarterly rate as simple interest for the exact number of days.

1. April 3: $792.81 for 22 days
   Interest: 792.81 × (0.05/4) × (22/90) ≈ 792.81 × 0.0125 × 0.2444 ≈ $2.425

2. April 25: $535.24 for 11 days
   Interest: 535.24 × 0.0125 × (11/90) ≈ $0.816

3. May 5: $736.06 for 35 days
   Interest: 736.06 × 0.0125 × (35/90) ≈ $3.585

4. June 9: $1,011.15 for 7 days
   Interest: 1,011.15 × 0.0125 × (7/90) ≈ $0.983

5. June 16: $1,556.68 for 16 days
   Interest: 1,556.68 × 0.0125 × (16/90) ≈ $3.46

Total interest: 2.425 + 0.816 + 3.585 + 0.983 + 3.46 ≈ $11.27

So total balance: 1,548.84 + 11.27 ≈ $1,560.11

But the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the interest to be calculated only on the last deposit, which was on June 16 for 16 days:

Interest: 544.53 × 0.0125 × (16/90) ≈ $1.209

So total balance: 1,548.84 + 1.209 ≈ $1,550.05

But again, not matching.

I think I've tried multiple approaches and none match the options. Perhaps the correct answer is E: $22.47, as it's the only option close to $22, which might be the sum of multiple small interests.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with E: $22.47.

To determine the total amount in Jim's savings account on July 1, we need to consider each transaction and calculate the interest earned on each deposit until the next transaction or the final date. The interest is compounded quarterly at a 5% annual rate, meaning each quarter's interest rate is 1.25% (5% / 4). Since the transactions occur mid-quarter, the interest for each deposit is calculated using the quarterly rate for the exact number of days it was in the account.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **April 3: Deposit $792.81**
   - **Period:** April 3 to April 25 (22 days)
   - **Interest:** \( 792.81 \times 0.0125 \times \frac{22}{90} \approx 2.43 \)
   - **Balance before withdrawal:** \( 792.81 + 2.43 = 795.24 \)
   - **Withdrawal:** \( 795.24 - 260 = 535.24 \)

2. **April 25: Balance $535.24**
   - **Period:** April 25 to May 5 (11 days)
   - **Interest:** \( 535.24 \times 0.0125 \times \frac{11}{90} \approx 0.81 \)
   - **Balance before deposit:** \( 535.24 + 0.81 = 536.05 \)
   - **Deposit:** \( 536.05 + 200 = 736.05 \)

3. **May 5: Balance $736.05**
   - **Period:** May 5 to June 9 (35 days)
   - **Interest:** \( 736.05 \times 0.0125 \times \frac{35}{90} \approx 3.59 \)
   - **Balance before deposit:** \( 736.05 + 3.59 = 739.64 \)
   - **Deposit:** \( 739.64 + 271.50 = 1011.14 \)

4. **June 9: Balance $1011.14**
   - **Period:** June 9 to June 16 (7 days)
   - **Interest:** \( 1011.14 \times 0.0125 \times \frac{7}{90} \approx 0.98 \)
   - **Balance before deposit:** \( 1011.14 + 0.98 = 1012.12 \)
   - **Deposit:** \( 1012.12 + 544.53 = 1556.65 \)

5. **June 16: Balance $1556.65**
   - **Period:** June 16 to July 1 (16 days)
   - **Interest:** \( 1556.65 \times 0.0125 \times \frac{16}{90} \approx 3.46 \)
   - **Final balance:** \( 1556.65 + 3.46 = 1560.11 \)

### Conclusion:
After calculating the interest for each deposit and adjusting for withdrawals and subsequent deposits, the total amount in Jim's account on July 1 is approximately **$1560.11**. However, this value does not match any of the provided options, suggesting a potential error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the options, the closest reasonable answer based on the calculations is:
