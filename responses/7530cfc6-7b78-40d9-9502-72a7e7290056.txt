Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find f(t) given the Laplace transform F(s). The function is F(s) = (3s² + 17s + 47) / [(s + 2)(s² + 4s + 29)]. The options are A through D, each involving exponential and sinusoidal terms multiplied by a unit step function u(t).

First, I remember that to find f(t), I need to perform an inverse Laplace transform on F(s). Since F(s) is a rational function, I should probably use partial fraction decomposition to break it down into simpler fractions that I can recognize from Laplace transform tables.

Looking at the denominator, it factors into (s + 2) times a quadratic (s² + 4s + 29). The quadratic doesn't factor nicely because the discriminant (16 - 116) is negative, so it's irreducible. That means I'll have a term for (s + 2) and another for the quadratic part.

So, I'll set up the partial fractions as F(s) = A/(s + 2) + (Bs + C)/(s² + 4s + 29). My goal is to find A, B, and C.

To find A, I can use the cover-up method. Multiply both sides by (s + 2) and then set s = -2.

Plugging s = -2 into the numerator: 3*(-2)^2 + 17*(-2) +47 = 3*4=12 -34 +47 = 12-34 is -22 +47=25. So A = 25 / [(-2)^2 +4*(-2) +29] = 25/(4-8+29)=25/(25)=1. Wait, no, wait, denominator when s=-2? Wait, denominator in the quadratic when s=-2 is (-2)^2 +4*(-2) +29 =4 -8 +29=25. So A = 25/25=1. So A=1.

Now, to find B and C, I'll expand the equation:

3s² +17s +47 = A(s² +4s +29) + (Bs + C)(s +2)

We already know A=1, so substituting:

3s² +17s +47 = (s² +4s +29) + (Bs + C)(s +2)

Expanding the right side:

= s² +4s +29 + Bs² + 2Bs + Cs + 2C

Combine like terms:

= (1 + B)s² + (4 + 2B + C)s + (29 + 2C)

Now, equate the coefficients from both sides:

Left side: 3s² +17s +47

Right side: (1+B)s² + (4+2B+C)s + (29 + 2C)

So, setting coefficients equal:

1. For s²: 3 = 1 + B → B = 2
2. For s: 17 = 4 + 2B + C. Since B=2, 17=4 +4 + C → 17=8+C → C=9
3. For constant term: 47 =29 + 2C → 2C=18 → C=9. Which matches, so that's correct.

So now, F(s) = 1/(s+2) + (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29)

Now, I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of each term.

First term: 1/(s+2) → L^{-1} is e^{-2t} u(t).

Second term: (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29). Let's complete the square in the denominator.

s² +4s +29 = (s^2 +4s +4) +25 = (s+2)^2 + 5^2.

So, the term becomes (2s +9)/[(s+2)^2 +25].

We can express this as (A(s+2) + B)/[(s+2)^2 +25], where A and B are constants to find.

Let me expand the numerator: 2s +9 = A(s+2) + B = A s + (2A + B).

Set coefficients equal:

2s: A=2

Constants: 2A + B =9 → 4 + B=9 → B=5.

So, the second term becomes [2(s+2) +5]/[(s+2)^2 +25] = 2(s+2)/[(s+2)^2 +25] +5/[(s+2)^2 +25].

Now, the inverse Laplace transforms are:

- For 2(s+2)/[(s+2)^2 +25], this is 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) u(t), because the Laplace transform of e^{at} cos(bt) is (s -a)/(s^2 -2as +a² +b²), but wait, let me check:

Wait, more accurately, the Laplace transform of e^{at} cos(bt) is (s -a)/(s^2 - 2a s + (a² + b²)).

Similarly, e^{at} sin(bt) is (b)/(s² -2a s +a² +b²).

So, for the term 2(s+2)/[(s+2)^2 +25], let's write it as 2(s+2)/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ), which would correspond to 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) u(t).

Similarly, the term 5/[(s+2)^2 +25] is 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ), which is the Laplace transform of (5/5) e^{-2t} sin(5t) u(t) = e^{-2t} sin(5t) u(t).

Wait, but wait, in the second term after partial fractions, we have 5 in the numerator. So the inverse transform is (5/(5)) e^{-2t} sin(5t) u(t) = e^{-2t} sin(5t) u(t).

Wait, but let's get back. So the second term in F(s) is split into two parts:

[2(s+2) +5]/[(s+2)^2 +25] = 2(s+2)/[(s+2)^2 +25] +5/[(s+2)^2 +25].

So, the inverse transform of this is 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) u(t) + (5/5) e^{-2t} sin(5t) u(t) = 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) + e^{-2t} sin(5t), both multiplied by u(t).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, the original F(s) after partial fractions is 1/(s+2) + (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29).

We rewrote the denominator as (s+2)^2 +5^2, so (s+2) is the new variable. So, the second term is (2s +9)/[(s+2)^2 +25].

Expressed as A(s+2) + B, where A=2 and B=5, as before.

So, the inverse Laplace transform is:

A e^{-2t} cos(5t) + (B/5) e^{-2t} sin(5t).

Because the standard form is (as + b)/(s^2 +2as + (a^2 +b^2)) → e^{-at} [a cos(bt) + (b/a) sin(bt)] u(t).

Wait, no, more accurately, the inverse transform of (s - a)/(s² - 2a s + (a² + b²)) is e^{at} cos(bt) u(t), and (b)/(s² - 2a s + (a² + b²)) is e^{at} sin(bt) u(t).

In our case, the second term after partial fractions is (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29) = [2(s+2) +5]/[(s+2)^2 +5^2].

Which is 2(s+2)/[(s+2)^2 +5^2] +5/[(s+2)^2 +5^2].

So, the inverse transform would be 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) u(t) + (5/5) e^{-2t} sin(5t) u(t) = 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) u(t) + e^{-2t} sin(5t) u(t).

Wait, but that seems different from the options given. The options have terms like 2.24 e^{-2t} sin(5t - 26.6°), etc.

Hmm, so perhaps I can combine the cosine and sine terms into a single sinusoid with a phase shift. Because 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t) can be written as R cos(5t - φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.

Let me calculate R and φ.

The expression is 2 cos(5t) + 1 sin(5t).

R = sqrt(2^2 +1^2) = sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)= approx 2.236, which is close to 2.24 as in the options.

The phase angle φ is given by tanφ = (1)/2 → φ = arctan(0.5) ≈ 26.565°, which is approximately 26.6°, as in the options.

So, 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t) = sqrt(5) cos(5t - φ), where φ ≈26.565°.

So, the second term becomes sqrt(5) e^{-2t} cos(5t - 26.565°) u(t).

Wait, but in the options, I see terms like 2.24 e^{-2t} sin(...). So maybe there's a sign or a sine instead of cosine involved.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard form is A cos(θ) + B sin(θ) = C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and tanφ = B/A.

In our case, A=2 and B=1, so C=sqrt(5)≈2.236, which is ≈2.24 as in option A.

So, the expression is 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t) = sqrt(5) cos(5t - φ), where φ = arctan(B/A) = arctan(1/2)=26.565°.

So, the inverse Laplace transform of the second term is sqrt(5) e^{-2t} cos(5t - 26.565°) u(t).

So, putting it all together, F(s) = 1/(s+2) + (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29).

Inverse transform is f(t) = e^{-2t} u(t) + sqrt(5) e^{-2t} cos(5t - 26.565°) u(t).

Which can be written as [e^{-2t} + sqrt(5) e^{-2t} cos(5t - 26.565°)] u(t).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: e^-2t + 2.24 e^-2t sin(5t -26.6°) u(t)

Option B: e^-2t +2.24 e^-2t cos(5t -26.6°) u(t)

Option C: e^-2t -2.24 e^-2t cos(5t -26.6°) u(t)

Option D: e^-2t +2.24 e^-2t cos(5t +26.6°) u(t)

Wait, so in my calculation, I have a cosine term with phase shift, but in the options, some have sine, some have cosine, and the phase is either subtracted or added.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I can express the expression as a sine function instead of cosine. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, let me double-check the partial fraction step.

After partial fractions, I had F(s) = 1/(s+2) + (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29).

I then completed the square in the denominator, getting (s+2)^2 +5^2.

Then, I expressed 2s +9 as 2(s+2) +5, correct.

So, the second term becomes [2(s+2) +5]/[(s+2)^2 +5^2], which splits into 2(s+2)/denominator +5/denominator.

Inverse transform is 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) + (5/5)e^{-2t} sin(5t) → 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) + e^{-2t} sin(5t).

Which combines to e^{-2t} [2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)].

Expressed as e^{-2t} [sqrt(5) cos(5t - φ)], where φ=arctan(1/2)=26.565°.

So, the overall f(t) is e^{-2t} + e^{-2t} sqrt(5) cos(5t -26.565°).

Wait, but wait, the first term is 1/(s+2), which is e^{-2t} u(t). The second term is the combination of cosine and sine, which gives a single cosine term. So f(t) is the sum of e^{-2t} and this cosine term multiplied by e^{-2t}, which is [e^{-2t} + sqrt(5) e^{-2t} cos(5t -26.565°)] u(t).

Looking at the options, option B is e^-2t +2.24 e^-2t cos(5t -26.6°), which matches because sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, which rounds to 2.24, and 26.565° rounds to 26.6°, so option B seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the phase angle again. When you have A cosθ + B sinθ, it's equivalent to C cos(θ - φ), where C=sqrt(A²+B²) and tanφ = B/A.

In our case, A=2, B=1, so tanφ=1/2, which is about 26.565°, correct.

So the phase shift is positive, meaning it's cos(5t -26.6°), which matches option B.

Wait, but let me check the signs. In the options, option B has a positive cosine term, which matches because both coefficients are positive.

Wait, but looking back, the second term in the Laplace transform is (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29). When I split it into partial fractions, I got 2(s+2) +5, leading to a positive coefficient for both cosine and sine terms. So the combination is positive.

So, the overall f(t) would be e^{-2t} + 2.24 e^{-2t} cos(5t -26.6°) u(t), which is option B.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option A has a sine term, which would be the case if the expression were written as a sine function with a phase shift. However, in our case, it's a cosine term. So option B is the correct one.

To evaluate \( f(t) \) given \( F(s) = \frac{3s^2 + 17s + 47}{(s + 2)(s^2 + 4s + 29)} \), we perform partial fraction decomposition and inverse Laplace transforms.

1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**:  
   We express \( F(s) \) as:  
   \[
   F(s) = \frac{A}{s + 2} + \frac{Bs + C}{s^2 + 4s + 29}
   \]  
   Solving for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \):  
   - \( A = 1 \)  
   - \( B = 2 \)  
   - \( C = 9 \)  

   Thus, \( F(s) = \frac{1}{s + 2} + \frac{2s + 9}{s^2 + 4s + 29} \).

2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:  
   - The first term \( \frac{1}{s + 2} \) corresponds to \( e^{-2t} u(t) \).  
   - The second term \( \frac{2s + 9}{s^2 + 4s + 29} \) is rewritten by completing the square in the denominator:  
     \[
     s^2 + 4s + 29 = (s + 2)^2 + 5^2
     \]  
     Expressing \( 2s + 9 \) as \( 2(s + 2) + 5 \), we split it into:  
     \[
     \frac{2(s + 2)}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2} + \frac{5}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2}
     \]  
     The inverse Laplace transforms are:  
     - \( 2 e^{-2t} \cos(5t) u(t) \)  
     - \( e^{-2t} \sin(5t) u(t) \)  

3. **Combining Terms**:  
   Combining the cosine and sine terms into a single sinusoid:  
   \[
   2 \cos(5t) + \sin(5t) = \sqrt{5} \cos(5t - 26.6^\circ)
   \]  
   where \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.24 \) and \( \phi = 26.6^\circ \).

4. **Final Expression**:  
   The overall \( f(t) \) is:  
   \[
   f(t) = e^{-2t} u(t) + 2.24 e^{-2t} \cos(5t - 26.6^\circ) u(t)
   \]  

This matches **Option B**.

**Answer**: B
