Okay, so I need to figure out what the Chinese process of divining the future by examining fired animal bones is called. Let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that in ancient China, people used various methods to predict the future. One of the most well-known methods involves using bones. I think it's related to something like oracle bones. Oracle bones are those turtle shells or animal bones that were used for divination in ancient China, specifically during the Shang Dynasty. 

Looking at the options provided, I need to match the correct term with this method. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: hang-t'u. I'm not sure what this refers to. It doesn't sound familiar in the context of Chinese divination methods. Maybe it's a term I'm not aware of, but I'll keep it in mind.

Option B: scapulimancy. Hmm, scapulimancy is a term I've heard before. It refers to divination by examining the shoulder bones of animals. That sounds similar to what I'm thinking about with oracle bones. But wait, isn't scapulimancy more commonly associated with other cultures, like ancient Rome or elsewhere? I'm not sure if it's the exact term used in Chinese contexts.

Option C: I Ching. Oh, I know the I Ching. It's the Book of Changes, a classic Chinese text used for divination, but it's more about yin and yang and the 8 trigrams. It's not specifically about examining bones, though. It's a system of divination that can be done through various means, like coins or yarrow stalks, but not primarily through bones.

Option D: Geomancy. Geomancy is another form of divination, but it's more about the arrangement of soil or earth. It's common in various cultures, including Chinese, but it's not about bones. So probably not the right answer.

Option E: Kau Cim. I'm less familiar with this one. Kau Cim might be a type of Chinese divination, perhaps using sticks or something else. I'm not certain about its specifics, so I'll have to think more.

Option F: cylinder seal prophecy. Cylinder seals are more associated with ancient Mesopotamia, used for imprinting contracts or religious texts. I don't think this is related to Chinese bone divination.

Option G: Tung Shing. Tung Shing refers to a type of traditional Chinese divination using a specific kind of stick. I think it's also known as the "Stick Divination" method. It's a method where sticks are thrown and their positions are interpreted. This is different from bone divination.

Option H: sarsen divination. Sarsen stones are large megaliths, often found in places like Stonehenge. Divination with stones doesn't ring a bell in the context of Chinese methods, so probably not this.

Now, going back to the question: it's about examining fired animal bones. From what I remember, the correct term for this method is "oracle bones," but looking at the options, I don't see "oracle bones" listed. Wait, perhaps the term in the options is referred to differently.

Wait, option B is scapulimancy. Scapulimancy is indeed the practice of using shoulder bones for divination. In Chinese practice, they used animal bones, often from oxen, which were heated until they cracked. The cracks were then interpreted. So, scapulimancy might be the closest term here, even if it's not the exact term used in Chinese context. Alternatively, hang-t'u (option A) might be a term I'm not familiar with. Let me think.

Hang-t'u doesn't ring a bell. Scapulimancy, while not specifically a Chinese term, describes the practice. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option E, Kau Cim, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think Kau Cim refers to using sticks, not bones.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: the method of using animal bones by heating them and interpreting the cracks is called "shou" (卜) in Chinese, but the term for the method in English might be "scapulimancy." Alternatively, in Chinese, it's called "甲骨文" (jiǎgǔwén), which refers to the inscriptions on oracle bones. But none of the options are jiǎgǔwén.

Looking back at the options, option B is scapulimancy, which is the general term for divination using shoulder/animal bones. So I think that's the closest match. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A: hang-t'u, but I'm not sure what that refers to.

Wait, perhaps I should check the other options again. Option E, Kau Cim, is another form of divination, but I think it's more associated with the use of sticks, perhaps similar to the Japanese I Ching method, but not bones. So I think the answer is B: scapulimancy.
