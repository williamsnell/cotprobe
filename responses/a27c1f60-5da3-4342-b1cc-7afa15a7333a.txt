Question:

For a class project, Charlotte recorded the heights of all 28 students in her class and calculated several statistics. She then realized she made an error recording the height of the tallest person in the class. She correctly had him listed as the tallest, but needed to add two inches to his recorded height to correct it. Which of these measures of spread must remain unchanged?

Options:

A: Mean absolute deviation
B: Mean
C: Coefficient of variation
D: Variance
E: Range
F: Interquartile range
G: Standard deviation

Okay, so Charlotte recorded the heights of all 28 students in her class for a project. She calculated several statistics, but then she realized she made a mistake in recording the height of the tallest person. She correctly noted that he was the tallest, but she needed to add two inches to his recorded height. The question is asking which measure of spread must remain unchanged after this correction.

Let me think about the measures of spread mentioned: mean absolute deviation, mean, coefficient of variation, variance, range, interquartile range, and standard deviation. I need to determine which of these doesn't change when only the tallest value is increased by two inches.

First, I should recall what each of these measures represents and how they are calculated.

The mean is the average of all the values. If the tallest person's height is increased by two inches, the total sum of all heights will increase by two inches, so the mean will also increase. So the mean (Option B) will change.

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Before the correction, the range was (tallest - shortest). After adding two inches to the tallest, the new maximum is taller by two inches, so the range will increase by two inches. Therefore, the range (Option E) changes.

The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Since the tallest person is likely in the upper quartile, increasing his height by two inches might affect Q3. If Q3 was already the maximum, then increasing the max would make Q3 larger, which would increase the IQR. Alternatively, if the maximum wasn't part of Q3, maybe the IQR remains the same. Hmm, but I think since the maximum is part of the upper quartile, Q3 could shift, so the IQR might change. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Variance and standard deviation are measures of how spread out the data is. They are calculated using the squared differences from the mean. If the mean changes, the variance and standard deviation will also change because all the squared differences will be based on a new mean. Additionally, since the tallest value is being increased, this will also affect the sum of squared differences. So both variance (Option D) and standard deviation (Option G) will change.

The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. Since both the standard deviation and the mean are changing, the coefficient of variation might change as well. Let's say the mean increases by a bit and the standard deviation also increases. The ratio could go up or down depending on how much each changes, but it's likely to change, so Option C might change.

Mean absolute deviation (MAD) is the average of the absolute differences from the mean. Like variance, if the mean changes, each of these absolute differences could change, especially for the tallest value. So MAD (Option A) is likely to change as well.

Wait, but let me think again. When you change the maximum value, how does that affect each measure?

For the range, it's straightforward: max - min. So increasing max by 2 will increase the range by 2. So E changes.

Interquartile range: If the maximum was part of the upper quartile, making it bigger could push Q3 higher, thus increasing IQR. But if the maximum wasn't part of the existing data points in Q3, maybe it doesn't affect. But in reality, adding a higher value could change the quartiles, especially if the new value affects the ordering. For example, if the previous maximum was the 28th student, and now it's increased, but all other values remain the same. So Q3 is the 21st value (since 28 is even, it's average of 21st and 22nd). If the maximum was already the 28th, increasing it doesn't change the 21st and 22nd values, so Q3 stays the same. Wait, that might not be right. Let's say the class has 28 students. So the quartiles would be at positions 7th and 8th for Q1, 15th and 16th for the median, and 23rd and 24th for Q3. So the maximum is the 28th value. If we increase the 28th value by two inches, the 23rd and 24th values (which determine Q3) might not change unless the 28th was one of them. Wait, in a sorted list, the 28th is the maximum. So the 23rd and 24th are still the same as before because we only changed the 28th. Therefore, Q3 remains the same, and Q1 remains the same. So the IQR (Q3 - Q1) remains unchanged. Oh! So that's an important point. The IQR is based on the middle 50% of the data. Changing the maximum doesn't affect the lower quartile or the upper quartile if the values are still in the same positions. So the interquartile range (Option F) remains the same.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The interquartile range is calculated from the middle 50% of the data, so it's not affected by the maximum or minimum values unless those values are part of the quartiles. Since the maximum value is beyond the upper quartile, changing it doesn't affect Q3. So IQR doesn't change. Therefore, Option F must remain unchanged.

Let me double-check the other options. Mean absolute deviation (MAD) is based on the mean. Since the mean increases, each data point's deviation from the mean changes. The tallest person's height is now two inches higher, so the difference between his height and the new mean could be different. For example, suppose the original mean was M, and the tallest was T. Now the mean becomes M + 2/28. The original difference was T - M. The new difference is (T+2) - (M + 2/28) = T - M + 2 - 2/28. So the deviation increases by (2 - 2/28). Since the mean is changing, the absolute deviations for other points might also change, but the sum could change, making MAD different.

Variance and standard deviation are definitely affected because they're based on squared deviations from the mean, which changes. So both D and G change.

Coefficient of variation (C.V.) is standard deviation divided by the mean. Both numerator and denominator change, so C.V. might change, but it's not certain without calculating.

So the only measure that remains unchanged is the interquartile range (Option F).

The interquartile range (IQR) is unaffected because it is based on the middle 50% of the data, which remains unchanged when only the maximum value is altered.
