Question:

Select the best translation into predicate logic. José introduces Wilma to Kevin. (j: José; k: Kevin; w: Wilma; Ixyz: x introduces y to z)

Options:

A: Ijkw
B: Iwkj
C: Iwjk
D: Ijwk
E: Ikjw

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct predicate logic translation for the sentence: "José introduces Wilma to Kevin." The options are A through E, each with a different arrangement of the letters j, w, k in the function Ixyz.

First, let me break down the sentence. The subject is José, who is doing the introducing. The action is introducing, and the objects are Wilma and Kevin. So, the structure is: José (introducer) introduces Wilma (introducee) to Kevin (introduced to).

Now, looking at the predicate Ixyz, the function Ixyz would mean "x introduces y to z." So, x is the introducer, y is the person being introduced, and z is the person being introduced to.

In the sentence, José is the one introducing, so x should be j. Wilma is the one being introduced, so y should be w. Kevin is the one being introduced to, so z should be k.

Putting that together, the predicate should be Ijwk, which is option D. Let me double-check the options:

A: Ijkw → x=j, y=k, z=w → José introduces Kevin to Wilma. That's not correct because Wilma is the one being introduced, not Kevin.

B: Iwkj → x=w, y=k, z=j. That would mean Wilma introduces Kevin to José, which is wrong.

C: Iwjk → x=w, y=j, z=k. Wilma introduces José to Kevin. Not correct.

D: Ijwk → x=j, y=w, z=k. José introduces Wilma to Kevin. That's exactly what the sentence says.

E: Ikjw → x=k, y=j, z=w. Kevin introduces José to Wilma. Wrong again.

So the correct answer should be D: Ijwk.

The correct translation is Ijwk, which corresponds to option D.
