Okay, so I've got this question about Lukianoff and Haidt's views on the trend of uncovering microaggressions. I'm a bit rusty on their work, but I remember they wrote about how certain campus policies can affect free speech and mental health. The question is asking what this trend encourages according to them.

First, let me think about what microaggressions are. They're those subtle, often unintentional acts that can be exclusionary, like backhanded compliments or microinvalidations. The movement to uncover them is often part of social justice efforts, aiming to make environments more inclusive.

Lukianoff and Haidt, from what I recall, have criticized some aspects of these movements. They might argue that focusing too much on microaggressions can lead to over-policing of speech, which can have negative effects on campus climates. They're concerned about how this might impact free speech and mental health, perhaps leading to more anxiety or feelings of being constantly monitored.

Looking at the options:

A: Students to confabulate reasons. Confabulate means to fabricate or make up stories. I'm not sure if that's what they say. Maybe it's about making up reasons for why something is offensive, but I don't recall that being their main point.

B: The pursuit of justice by marking out racism, sexism, and classism. This sounds positive, but Lukianoff and Haidt might critique the approach, saying it's too broad or counterproductive. They might not see it as effectively pursuing justice but rather as causing other issues.

C: Labeling, by assigning global negative traits to persons. This seems more about how people might overgeneralize and label others based on microaggressions, which could be an unintended consequence they discuss.

D: Universities to bear overly burdensome legal obligations. I think they do talk about universities taking on too much legal responsibility, maybe through policies that require extensive documentation or training, which can be a burden.

So, putting it together, Lukianoff and Haidt probably argue that the trend leads universities to take on more legal obligations than they can handle, which is option D. They might also discuss how this leads to over-policing and a negative environment, but D seems to fit their critique about the burden on institutions.
