Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate the line integral ∮_{C} y³ dx + x³ dy using Green's Theorem. The curve C is a positively oriented circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the region D enclosed by C. The theorem states that ∮_{C} (L dx + M dy) = ∬_{D} (∂M/∂x - ∂L/∂y) dA. 

In this problem, L is y³ and M is x³. So I need to compute the partial derivatives of M with respect to x and L with respect to y.

Let me compute ∂M/∂x. Since M = x³, the partial derivative with respect to x is 3x².

Now, ∂L/∂y. L is y³, so the partial derivative is 3y².

Subtracting them, ∂M/∂x - ∂L/∂y = 3x² - 3y².

So according to Green's Theorem, the line integral becomes the double integral over D of (3x² - 3y²) dA. That simplifies to 3 times the double integral of (x² - y²) dA.

Hmm, the region D is a circle of radius 2. So I should probably switch to polar coordinates to evaluate this double integral. In polar coordinates, x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, and dA = r dr dθ. The limits for r would be from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

Let me substitute x² and y² in terms of r and θ. x² = r² cos²θ, y² = r² sin²θ. So x² - y² = r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos(2θ). 

So the integrand (x² - y²) becomes r² cos(2θ), and when multiplied by dA (which is r dr dθ), the integrand becomes r³ cos(2θ).

Now, the double integral becomes 3 times the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π of r³ cos(2θ) dr dθ.

Wait a second. Let me split this into two separate integrals, one with respect to r and the other with θ. So:

3 * [∫(r=0 to 2) r³ dr] * [∫(θ=0 to 2π) cos(2θ) dθ]

Let me compute each integral separately.

First, ∫(0 to 2) r³ dr. The integral of r³ is (r^4)/4. Evaluating from 0 to 2 gives (2^4)/4 - 0 = 16/4 = 4.

Next, ∫(0 to 2π) cos(2θ) dθ. The integral of cos(aθ) is (1/a) sin(aθ). So here, a=2, so it's (1/2) sin(2θ) evaluated from 0 to 2π.

Calculating that: (1/2)[sin(4π) - sin(0)] = (1/2)(0 - 0) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because then the whole double integral would be zero, leading the original line integral to be zero as well. But looking at the options, option F is 0. So is that the correct answer?

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me go through again. The integrand after substitution is r³ cos(2θ). The integral over r is from 0 to 2 of r^3 dr, which is indeed 4. The integral over θ is of cos(2θ) from 0 to 2π. 

The integral of cos(2θ) over a full period (from 0 to 2π) is zero because the positive and negative areas cancel out. So the entire double integral becomes 3 * 4 * 0 = 0. 

So according to Green's Theorem, the line integral equals zero. So the answer should be option F: 0.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't apply Green's Theorem incorrectly. The theorem applies to positively oriented curves, which this is. Also, the region should be simply connected, which a circle is. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think: The integral of a vector field around a closed curve can sometimes be zero if the field is conservative, but in this case, the field is F = (y³, x³). Wait, is this field conservative? For a field to be conservative, the curl must be zero. The curl here is ∂M/∂x - ∂L/∂y, which is 3x² - 3y². This isn't zero unless x² = y², which isn't the case everywhere. So the field isn't conservative, but in this case, the integral over the circle still turned out to be zero because the double integral over the region of (3x² - 3y²) ended up being zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the circle and compute the integral directly, just to confirm.

Let me try that. The circle of radius 2 can be parametrized as x = 2 cos θ, y = 2 sin θ, where θ goes from 0 to 2π. Then, dx = -2 sin θ dθ, dy = 2 cos θ dθ.

Now, the integral becomes:

∫ (y³ dx + x³ dy) = ∫_{0}^{2π} [(2 sin θ)^3 (-2 sin θ dθ) + (2 cos θ)^3 (2 cos θ dθ)]

Simplify each term:

First term: (8 sin³ θ)(-2 sin θ) dθ = -16 sin^4 θ dθ

Second term: (8 cos³ θ)(2 cos θ) dθ = 16 cos^4 θ dθ

So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{2π} (-16 sin^4 θ + 16 cos^4 θ) dθ = 16 ∫_{0}^{2π} (cos^4 θ - sin^4 θ) dθ.

Hmm, cos^4 θ - sin^4 θ can be factored as (cos² θ - sin² θ)(cos² θ + sin² θ) = (cos 2θ)(1) = cos 2θ.

So the integral becomes 16 ∫_{0}^{2π} cos 2θ dθ.

Which is 16 * [ (1/2) sin 2θ ] from 0 to 2π. Evaluating this, sin(4π) is 0, sin(0) is 0, so the integral is 16*(0 - 0) = 0.

So that confirms it. The line integral is indeed zero. Therefore, the correct answer is F: 0.

The problem involves evaluating the line integral ∮_{C} y³ dx + x³ dy using Green's Theorem. By applying the theorem, the integral is transformed into a double integral over the region enclosed by the circle. After simplifying and evaluating using polar coordinates, the result is zero. This is confirmed by directly parametrizing the circle and computing the integral, which also yields zero. 

Answer: F
