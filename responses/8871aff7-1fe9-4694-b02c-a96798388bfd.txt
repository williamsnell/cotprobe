Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the volume of a gas under certain conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The question says that at 300 K and 20 atm, the compression factor of a gas is 0.86. We need to find the volume occupied by 8.2 mmol of the gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the compression factor, Z, relates the actual volume of a gas to the volume predicted by the ideal gas law. 

Wait, right, the formula for compression factor is Z = PV/(nRT), where P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. But I think another way to think about it is that the actual volume V can be calculated using the ideal gas equation multiplied by Z. So maybe V_actual = Z * (nRT/P). 

Let me write down the known values:
- Temperature (T) = 300 K
- Pressure (P) = 20 atm
- Moles (n) = 8.2 mmol. Oh wait, mmol is millimole, so that's 8.2 x 10^-3 moles.
- Compression factor (Z) = 0.86

I need to compute the volume using these. So, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But since Z is given, I can adjust for real gas behavior. So, the actual volume V is Z times the ideal volume. 

So the formula becomes V = Z * (nRT)/P.

I should make sure all units are compatible. The gas constant R is usually in units that match the pressure and volume. Since the pressure is in atm, I think R should be 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). 

Wait, let me check the units:
- n is in moles, so that's fine.
- T is in K, correct.
- R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).
- P is in atm, so units should work out for V in liters.

But wait, the volume we're looking for is in cm³, right? Because the options are in cm³. Oh, right, 1 L = 1000 cm³. So after calculating V in liters, I'll multiply by 1000 to convert to cm³.

Let me plug in the numbers:

n = 8.2 mmol = 0.0082 mol
R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T = 300 K
P = 20 atm
Z = 0.86

So, V_ideal = (nRT)/P = (0.0082 * 0.0821 * 300) / 20

Let me calculate that step by step. 

First, calculate numerator: 0.0082 * 0.0821 = let's see, 0.0082 * 0.08 is about 0.000656, but more accurately, 0.0082 * 0.0821 = 0.00067322. Then multiply by 300: 0.00067322 * 300 = 0.201966.

Then divide by P, which is 20: 0.201966 / 20 = 0.0100983 L.

So that's the ideal volume. Now, multiply by Z to get the actual volume: V = 0.86 * 0.0100983 ≈ 0.0086845 L.

Convert that to cm³: 0.0086845 L * 1000 cm³/L = 8.6845 cm³. 

Looking at the options, the closest one is D: 7.9 cm³. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, no, perhaps I messed up the multiplication. Let me recalculate the ideal volume more accurately.

nRT = 0.0082 * 0.0821 * 300.

Let me compute 0.0082 * 0.0821 first.

0.0082 * 0.0821 = (8.2e-3) * (8.21e-2) = 8.2 *8.21 * 1e-5 = 67.322 * 1e-5 = 0.00067322.

Then multiply by 300: 0.00067322 * 300 = 0.201966.

Divide by P=20: 0.201966 / 20 = 0.0100983 L.

Multiply by Z=0.86: 0.0100983 * 0.86 ≈ 0.0086845 L. So 8.6845 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have 8.7 cm³ exactly. Hmm, option H is 8.7 cm³, but option D is 7.9. Did I make a mistake in calculations? Let me double-check.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should have used the correct value for R. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), correct. Units should be okay.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

0.0082 *0.0821 = let me compute 0.0082 * 0.0821:

0.0082 * 0.0821 = (0.008 * 0.08) + (0.0002 *0.08) + (0.008 *0.0021) + (0.0002 *0.0021). Hmm, maybe this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, 0.0082 * 0.0821 is:

0.0082 * 0.08 = 0.000656

0.0082 * 0.0021 = 0.00001722

So total is 0.000656 + 0.00001722 = 0.00067322, same as before.

Then times 300: 0.00067322 *300 = 0.201966.

Divide by 20: 0.0100983 L.

Multiply by 0.86: 0.0100983 * 0.86.

Let me compute 0.01 * 0.86 = 0.0086.

But 0.0100983 is a bit more than 0.01, so 0.0086 plus the extra.

0.0000983 * 0.86 = approx 0.0000844. So total is approximately 0.0086844 L, which is 8.684 cm³.

Wait, but none of the options match exactly. Let me look at the options again: Option H is 8.7 cm³, which is very close. But wait, the options don't have H as 8.7? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:5.9, B:12.1, C:7.3, D:7.9, E:9.5, F:10.8, G:6.8, H:8.7, I:11.4, J:10.2.

So H is 8.7, which is very close to my calculation of 8.684, so that would be the correct option. But wait, why is the option D 7.9? Did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, another thought: Did I mess up the units for n? 8.2 mmol is 0.0082 moles, correct. So that's right.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered R as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but then the pressure would have to be in Pascals and volume in m³. Let me try that approach to see if it changes anything.

Wait, but that might complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps I confused cm³ with liters somewhere. Let me check the conversion again.

Wait, 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 0.0086845 L is 8.6845 cm³. So that's approximately 8.7 cm³, which is option H.

But wait, the options have D as 7.9. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the calculation steps? Let me recalculate the ideal volume again.

nRT = 0.0082 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) *300 K.

0.0082 *0.0821 = 0.00067322.

Multiply by 300: 0.00067322 *300 = 0.201966.

Divide by P=20 atm: 0.201966 /20 = 0.0100983 L.

Multiply by Z=0.86: 0.0100983 *0.86 = approx 0.008684 L, which is 8.684 cm³.

Hmm, so that's about 8.7 cm³, which is option H. But looking again, option D is 7.9, which is about 0.8 L, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: Did I mix up the compression factor formula? Wait, compression factor Z is defined as Z = PV/(nRT). So the actual volume V is (Z * nRT)/P.

Wait, but if Z is 0.86, then V = Z * (nRT/P).

Yes, that's correct. So my calculation should be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check using another approach. Let me compute using the ideal gas law first without Z and then adjust.

Ideal volume V_ideal = nRT/P = (0.0082 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(300 K)/(20 atm).

Calculations:

0.0082 * 0.0821 = 0.00067322.

0.00067322 *300 = 0.201966.

Divide by 20: 0.0100983 L, which is 10.0983 mL or 10.0983 cm³.

Then, since Z=0.86, the actual volume is 0.86 *10.0983 cm³= approx 8.684 cm³, which is 8.7 cm³, so option H.

But wait, the options also have option D as 7.9 cm³. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the calculation? Or maybe the question expects something else.

Wait another thought: Could the pressure be in bar instead of atm? Because sometimes people use different units for pressure. Let me check what 20 atm is in bar. 1 atm is about 101.325 kPa, and 1 bar is 100 kPa. So 20 atm is 20 * 101.325 = 2026.5 kPa, which is about 20.265 bar. But that might not change the result much.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas constant R should be used in different units. Wait, if I use R=8.314 J/(mol·K), then I'd have to convert pressure to Pascals and volume to m³. Let me try that.

n=0.0082 mol, R=8.314, T=300 K, P=20 atm. 1 atm is 101325 Pa, so 20 atm is 2026500 Pa.

V_ideal = nRT/P = (0.0082)(8.314)(300)/(2026500).

Compute numerator: 0.0082 *8.314 = approx 0.0683948. Multiply by 300: 0.0683948 *300=20.51844.

Divide by 2026500: 20.51844 /2026500 ≈ 0.000010125 m³. Convert to cm³: 1 m³=1e6 cm³, so 0.000010125 m³=10.125 cm³.

Now, multiply by Z=0.86: 10.125 *0.86≈8.7015 cm³, which is again about 8.7 cm³, so option H.

Wait, that's the same result. So I think my calculation is correct. So the correct answer should be option H:8.7 cm³.

But wait, looking at the options again, option H is 8.7 cm³, which matches my calculation. So why is option D 7.9? Maybe I should check if I messed up the exponent somewhere. Let me recalculate the ideal volume.

nRT =0.0082 * 0.0821 *300.

0.0082 *0.0821 =0.00067322.

Multiply by 300: 0.00067322 *300=0.201966.

Divide by 20: 0.0100983 L=10.0983 mL=10.0983 cm³.

Multiply by Z=0.86: 10.0983 *0.86=8.684 cm³.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option H:8.7 cm³.

But wait, looking back at the options, the choices are:

A:5.9, B:12.1, C:7.3, D:7.9, E:9.5, F:10.8, G:6.8, H:8.7, I:11.4, J:10.2.

So H is 8.7, which is what I got. So the correct answer should be H.

To calculate the volume of the gas under the given conditions, we use the relationship involving the compression factor \( Z \), which accounts for real gas behavior. The formula for the actual volume \( V \) is:

\[
V = Z \cdot \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

### Given Data:
- Temperature (\( T \)) = \( 300 \, \mathrm{K} \)
- Pressure (\( P \)) = \( 20 \, \mathrm{atm} \)
- Moles (\( n \)) = \( 8.2 \, \mathrm{mmol} = 0.0082 \, \mathrm{mol} \)
- Compression factor (\( Z \)) = \( 0.86 \)
- Gas constant (\( R \)) = \( 0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm \cdot mol^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the ideal volume
Using the ideal gas law:

\[
V_{\text{ideal}} = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
V_{\text{ideal}} = \frac{(0.0082)(0.0821)(300)}{20}
\]

1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   0.0082 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.00067322
   \]
   \[
   0.00067322 \cdot 300 = 0.201966
   \]

2. Divide by \( P = 20 \):
   \[
   V_{\text{ideal}} = \frac{0.201966}{20} = 0.0100983 \, \mathrm{L}
   \]

Convert to \( \mathrm{cm}^3 \) (\( 1 \, \mathrm{L} = 1000 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \)):

\[
V_{\text{ideal}} = 0.0100983 \, \mathrm{L} \times 1000 = 10.0983 \, \mathrm{cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Adjust for the compression factor
The actual volume is:

\[
V = Z \cdot V_{\text{ideal}}
\]

Substitute \( Z = 0.86 \):

\[
V = 0.86 \cdot 10.0983 = 8.684 \, \mathrm{cm}^3
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated volume is approximately \( 8.7 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \), which corresponds to **Option H**.

### Final Answer:
H
