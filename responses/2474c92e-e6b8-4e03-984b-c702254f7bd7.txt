Okay, so I have this problem here about Pluto and some caterpillars. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. The question is asking how many years it would take a mauve caterpillar to crawl around the equator of Pluto. That sounds like a big task, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to figure out the circumference of Pluto's equator. The problem says Pluto's radius is 1180 km. I remember that the circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula C = 2 * π * r. So I can plug in the radius to find the circumference. Let me do that: C = 2 * π * 1180 km. Let me calculate that... 2 times π is about 6.283, so 6.283 * 1180. Let me see, 6 * 1180 is 7080, and 0.283 * 1180 is approximately 333.14. Adding those together gives about 7413.14 km. So the equator is roughly 7413 km long.

Now, I need to find out how fast a mauve caterpillar is moving and how long it would take to crawl that distance. The problem gives some information about the lengths of lines of different caterpillars and their crawling speeds. Let me parse that.

Point 1: A line of 5 mauve caterpillars is as long as a line of 7 violet caterpillars. So, 5M = 7V in terms of length. That means the length of a mauve caterpillar (Lm) is (7/5) times the length of a violet caterpillar (Lv). So Lm = (7/5)Lv.

Point 2: A line of 3 lavender (Lv) and 1 mauve (M) is as long as 8 violet (V). So 3Lv + 1M = 8Lv. Wait, that's 3Lv + Lm = 8Lv. From point 1, we know Lm is (7/5)Lv. Let me substitute that in. So 3Lv + (7/5)Lv = 8Lv. Let me compute the left side: 3 is 15/5, so 15/5 + 7/5 = 22/5. So 22/5 Lv = 8Lv. Wait, that can't be right because 22/5 is 4.4, and 8 is larger. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. From point 1: 5M =7V => M =7/5 V. So in point 2: 3L + M =8V. Substituting M: 3L + (7/5)V =8V. Wait, but L is lavender, which I think is a different species. Oh wait, maybe I should define variables for each species' length. Let me define Llav = length of lavender, Lmau = length of mauve, Lvio = length of violet.

So from point 1: 5 Lmau =7 Lvio → Lmau = (7/5) Lvio.

Point 2: 3 Llav + 1 Lmau =8 Lvio. Substitute Lmau from point 1: 3 Llav + (7/5) Lvio =8 Lvio.

Let me subtract (7/5)Lvio from both sides: 3 Llav =8 Lvio - (7/5)Lvio. Let me compute that. 8 is 40/5, so 40/5 -7/5 =33/5. So 3 Llav = (33/5) Lvio → Llav = (33/5)/3 * Lvio = (11/5) Lvio. So Llav = (11/5) Lvio. So lavender is longer than violet by a factor of 11/5, which is 2.2 times.

Point 3: A line of 5 lavender, 5 mauve, and 2 violet is 1m long. So 5 Llav +5 Lmau +2 Lvio =1 m. Let's plug in Llav and Lmau in terms of Lvio.

From earlier, Llav =11/5 Lvio, Lmau=7/5 Lvio.

So substituting:

5*(11/5 Lvio) +5*(7/5 Lvio) +2 Lvio =1 m.

Simplify each term:

5*(11/5) =11, so 11 Lvio.

5*(7/5)=7, so 7 Lvio.

Plus 2 Lvio.

Total: 11 +7 +2 =20 Lvio =1 m.

So 20 Lvio =1 m → Lvio =1/20 m =0.05 m. So each violet caterpillar is 5 cm long.

Now, Lmau =7/5 *0.05 m =0.07 m =7 cm.

Llav =11/5 *0.05 m=0.11 m=11 cm.

So each mauve is 7 cm, violet 5 cm, lavender 11 cm.

Now, point 4: A lavender caterpillar takes 10s to crawl the length of a violet caterpillar. So the time for Llav to crawl Lvio is 10s.

So the speed of a lavender caterpillar (Lv) is distance over time: Lv = Lvio /10 s =0.05 m /10 s =0.005 m/s.

Point 5: Violet and mauve caterpillars both crawl twice as fast as lavender. So their speeds are double Lv.

So speed of violet (Vio) =2 *0.005 =0.01 m/s.

Speed of mauve (Mau) = same as violet, 0.01 m/s.

Wait, no: point 5 says violet and mauve both crawl twice as fast as lavender. So their speeds are 2 * Lv's speed.

Lv's speed is 0.005 m/s, so Vio and Mau are each 0.01 m/s.

Now, the question is about a mauve caterpillar crawling around Pluto's equator, which is 7413 km, which is 7413000 meters.

So time = distance / speed.

Distance: 7,413,000 m.

Speed of mauve: 0.01 m/s.

Time in seconds: 7,413,000 /0.01 =741,300,000 seconds.

Now, convert seconds to years.

First, seconds in a minute:60, minutes in an hour:60, hours in a day:24, days in a year:365.

So seconds per year:60*60*24*365 = let's calculate that.

60*60=3600 sec/hour.

3600*24=86400 sec/day.

86400 *365 = ?

Well, 86400 *300=25,920,000.

86400 *65=5,616,000.

So total: 25,920,000 +5,616,000=31,536,000 seconds per year.

So time in years: 741,300,000 /31,536,000 ≈ let's compute.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 741,300 /31,536 ≈ let me compute that.

31,536 *23 = 725,328.

31,536 *23.5=725,328 + (31,536/2)=725,328 +15,768=741,096.

Hmm, 31,536 *23.5 ≈741,096, which is very close to 741,300.

So 23.5 years would be about 741,096 seconds.

The actual number is 741,300, so the difference is 741,300 -741,096=204 seconds.

204 seconds is 204/31,536,000 ≈ 0.00647 years, roughly 0.0065 years, which is about 2.38 days.

So total time is approximately 23.5 +0.0065≈23.5065 years.

Looking at the options, J is 23.0. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the speed again. The mauve's speed is 0.01 m/s. The distance is 7,413 km, which is 7,413,000 meters.

Time=7,413,000 /0.01=741,300,000 seconds.

Seconds per year:31,536,000.

741,300,000 /31,536,000 = approximately 23.5 years.

But the options don't have 23.5; the closest is J:23.0 and maybe another. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:30.0

B:15.0

C:25.0

D:28.0

E:18.0

F:20.0

G:40.0

H:12.0

I:35.0

J:23.0

So 23.5 is closest to 23, which is option J. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the speed.

Wait, point 4 says a lavender takes 10s to crawl the length of a violet. So the distance is Lvio, which is 0.05 m. So speed of lavender is 0.05 m /10 s =0.005 m/s. Violet and mauve are twice as fast, so 0.01 m/s each.

That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial circumference calculation. Let me recheck.

C =2πr. Radius is 1180 km, so 1180 *1000 =1,180,000 meters. So C=2 * π *1,180,000 ≈6.283 *1,180,000 ≈7,413,000 meters. Correct.

So time is 7,413,000 /0.01 =741,300,000 seconds.

Divide by 31,536,000: 741,300,000 /31,536,000 ≈23.5 years. So the answer should be around 23.5, but the options have J as 23.0. So perhaps the intended answer is J:23.0.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider significant figures. Let me check the given data.

The radius is given as 1180 km, which is 4 significant figures. The other data are exact numbers (like 5,7, etc.), so perhaps the answer is 23.5, but since J is 23.0, maybe the intended answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the speed. Let me double-check.

Wait, point 5 says violet and mauve crawl twice as fast as lavender. So if lavender's speed is 0.005 m/s, then violet and mauve are 0.01 m/s. Correct.

Wait, but in point 4, the time is 10s for lavender to crawl the length of a violet. So distance is Lvio=0.05 m. So speed is 0.05/10=0.005 m/s. Correct.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the time is approximately 23.5 years, so the closest option is J:23.0.

The problem involves calculating the time it takes for a mauve caterpillar to crawl around Pluto's equator. The key steps are:

1. **Circumference of Pluto**: Using the formula \( C = 2\pi r \), with \( r = 1180 \, \text{km} = 1,180,000 \, \text{m} \), the equatorial circumference is approximately \( 7,413,000 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Caterpillar Lengths**: From the given ratios:
   - \( 5L_{\text{mauve}} = 7L_{\text{violet}} \) implies \( L_{\text{mauve}} = \frac{7}{5}L_{\text{violet}} \).
   - \( 3L_{\text{lavender}} + L_{\text{mauve}} = 8L_{\text{violet}} \). Substituting \( L_{\text{mauve}} \), we find \( L_{\text{lavender}} = \frac{11}{5}L_{\text{violet}} \).
   - From \( 5L_{\text{lavender}} + 5L_{\text{mauve}} + 2L_{\text{violet}} = 1 \, \text{m} \), substituting the lengths gives \( L_{\text{violet}} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \), \( L_{\text{mauve}} = 0.07 \, \text{m} \), and \( L_{\text{lavender}} = 0.11 \, \text{m} \).

3. **Speeds**:
   - A lavender caterpillar takes \( 10 \, \text{s} \) to crawl \( 0.05 \, \text{m} \), so its speed is \( 0.005 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Violet and mauve caterpillars are twice as fast, so their speed is \( 0.01 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. **Time to Circumnavigate Pluto**:
   - Distance: \( 7,413,000 \, \text{m} \).
   - Speed of mauve caterpillar: \( 0.01 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Time in seconds: \( \frac{7,413,000}{0.01} = 741,300,000 \, \text{s} \).
   - Convert to years: \( \frac{741,300,000}{31,536,000} \approx 23.5 \, \text{years} \).

5. **Final Answer**: The closest option to \( 23.5 \, \text{years} \) is \( 23.0 \, \text{years} \).
