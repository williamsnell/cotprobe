Question:

Phosphate can be removed from sewage effluent by adding magnesium oxide and ammonium ion according to the re- action 5H_2O + H_2PO^-_4 + MgO + NH^+_4 \rightarrow Mg(NH_4)PO_4 \bullet 6H_2O. The magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (Mg(NH_4)PO_4 \bullet6H_2O) precipitates out. In theory, how much of this could be produced if a city processes 5 million gal. (41.7 million lb.) daily of wastewater containing 30 ppm H_2PO^-_4? (1 pound = 453.59 g.)

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about determining how much magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O) can be produced from a city's wastewater. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again carefully. The city processes 5 million gallons of wastewater daily, which contains 30 ppm of H2PO4-. They add magnesium oxide and ammonium ions to remove phosphate, forming Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O as a precipitate. We need to find the theoretical yield of this precipitate in kilograms.

Alright, let's break it down. I think the key steps will involve calculating the moles of phosphate in the wastewater and then using the stoichiometry of the reaction to find out how much Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O is produced.

Wait, I need to be careful with the units. The volume is given in gallons, and the concentration is in parts per million (ppm), and then we have to convert to pounds and then grams. Let me jot down the given data:

- Wastewater volume: 5 million gallons/day. That's 5 x 10^6 gallons.
- Concentration of H2PO4-: 30 ppm. I think ppm here is in mg/L because that's a common unit. So 30 mg/L.
- Conversion: 1 pound = 453.59 grams. Oh, but wait, the volume is given as 41.7 million lb. in the problem statement? Wait, no, the initial problem says the city processes 5 million gal., which is 41.7 million lb. Hmm, that might be a mistake in the problem or maybe an additional conversion. Wait, no, that's probably from the initial data, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the city processes 5 million gal. (41.7 million lb.) daily. Oh, so that's giving the weight in pounds for the 5 million gallons. So 5 million gallons equals 41.7 million pounds. So the total weight of the wastewater is 41.7 million pounds per day.

Wait, but then the phosphate concentration is 30 ppm. So I need to find the mass of H2PO4- in 41.7 million pounds of wastewater.

Wait, ppm can be in different units. Typically, ppm can be mg/L, which is equivalent to parts per million by mass in water. So if the concentration is 30 ppm, that's 30 mg of H2PO4- per liter of water.

But since we have the total volume in gallons, perhaps it's easier to convert everything to liters and then find the mass of phosphate.

Alternatively, maybe I can work directly with the given volume and concentration. Let me think.

Wait, let's clarify the units. The 5 million gallons is converted to pounds as 41.7 million lb. So the total mass of the wastewater is 41.7 million pounds. But I'm not sure how that helps yet because the concentration is in ppm, which is mg per liter.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the total mass of H2PO4- in the 5 million gallons, considering the concentration in mg/L.

Wait, so 5 million gallons is the volume. Let's convert that to liters because the concentration is in mg/L. I know that 1 gallon is approximately 3.78541 liters. So 5 million gallons is 5,000,000 * 3.78541 ≈ let me calculate that.

Wait, 5,000,000 gallons * 3.78541 L/gal = 18,927,050 liters. So approximately 18.927 million liters.

Now, the concentration is 30 mg/L. So the total mass of H2PO4- is 30 mg/L * 18,927,050 L. Let's compute that.

30 mg/L * 18,927,050 L = 30 * 18,927,050 mg = let's calculate that. 18,927,050 * 30 = 567,811,500 mg. That's 567,811,500 mg, which is 567,811.5 grams. Since 1 kg = 1000 g, that's 567.8115 kg of H2PO4-.

Wait, but the problem states that the city processes 5 million gal. (41.7 million lb.) daily. So the 41.7 million lb. is the mass of the 5 million gallons of wastewater. Thus, perhaps the total mass is 41.7e6 lb, which is 41.7e6 * 453.59 g = let me check that, but I'm not sure if that's needed because I already computed the H2PO4- mass as 567.8115 kg using the ppm concentration.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the 567.8115 kg of H2PO4-.

Now, the next step is to find out how many moles of H2PO4- are present. The molar mass of H2PO4- is needed for that. Let's calculate it.

H: 1.008 g/mol * 2 = 2.016 g/mol
P: 30.974 g/mol
O: 16.00 g/mol *4 = 64.00 g/mol
Total molar mass: 2.016 + 30.974 + 64.00 = 97.0 g/mol approximately.

Wait, more accurately: H2PO4^− is H2PO4^−, so the formula is H2PO4^-.

So the molar mass is (2*1.008) + 30.974 + (4*16.00) = 2.016 + 30.974 + 64.00 = 97.0 g/mol.

So moles of H2PO4^- = 567,811.5 g / 97.0 g/mol ≈ let me compute that.

567,811.5 ÷ 97 ≈ approximately 5,859.899 mol. Let's say about 5,859.9 moles.

Now, looking at the reaction equation: 5H2O + H2PO4^- + MgO + NH4^+ → Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

Wait, the stoichiometry is 1 mole of H2PO4^- produces 1 mole of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O. So the moles of precipitate should be equal to the moles of H2PO4^-.

So moles of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O = 5,859.9 mol.

Now, the molar mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O needs to be calculated.

Let's break it down:

Mg: 24.305 g/mol
N (from NH4): Each NH4 has 1 N, so total 2 N in the formula (since Mg(NH4)PO4 has two NH4 groups?)
Wait, no, the formula is Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O. So it's Mg, NH4, PO4, and 6 H2O.

Wait, no, the formula is Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O, so it's Mg, one NH4, one PO4, and 6 H2O.

Wait, actually, no, the formula is Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O, which means Mg is in the center, with one NH4, one PO4, and six water molecules attached.

So the molar mass:

Mg: 24.305
N: 14.007 * 1 (from NH4)
H: 1.008 * (4 from NH4 + 4 from the phosphate part? Wait, no, let me count each component.

Wait, Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O: So the formula is Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

So the components are:

Mg: 1 atom
N: 1 atom (from NH4)
H: 4 (from NH4) + 4 (from PO4^3- which has four H in the structure, but wait, no, PO4^3- is phosphate, but in the compound, it's Mg(NH4)PO4, so the PO4 is just P, O's. Wait, perhaps I should count each atom:

Wait, Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O:

Mg: 1
N: 1 (from NH4)
H: 4 (from NH4) + (from PO4? No, PO4 is O's. Wait, the PO4 is part of the structure, so perhaps the H comes from the water in the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write out all the atoms:

Mg: 1
N: 1 (from NH4)
H: 4 (from NH4) + 2*6 (from 6 H2O) = 4 +12 = 16 H
P: 1
O: 4 (from PO4) + 6*O from H2O = 4 +6 =10 O? Wait, but wait, the H2O has O, so 6 H2O contributes 6 O. So PO4 contributes 4 O, so total O is 4 +6 =10? Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate each element:

Mg: 24.305
N: 14.007
H: (4 from NH4) + (2*6 from H2O) = 4 +12 =16 → 16 *1.008 =16.128
P: 30.974
O: (4 from PO4) + (6*1 from H2O) =10 → 10 *16.00 =160.0

Wait, wait, no: the formula is Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O. So the PO4 is part of the Mg(NH4)PO4, which has one PO4 group. So in the entire formula, the PO4 contributes 4 O, and the 6 H2O contributes 6 O. So total O is 4 +6 =10 O atoms.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me think about each part:

- Mg(NH4)PO4: This part has Mg, NH4, and PO4. So each molecule has 1 Mg, 1 NH4, 1 PO4.

Wait, so Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O would have:

Mg: 1
N: 1 (from NH4)
H: 4 (from NH4) + 2*6 (from H2O) = 4 +12 =16
P:1
O: 4 (from PO4) + 6 (from H2O) =10

So the molar mass would be:

Mg:24.305
N:14.007
H:16 *1.008 =16.128
P:30.974
O:10 *16.00 =160.0

Adding them up:

24.305 +14.007 =38.312
38.312 +16.128 =54.44
54.44 +30.974 =85.414
85.414 +160.0 =245.414 g/mol.

Wait, but let me check: Mg is 24.305, N is 14.007, H is 16 *1.008 =16.128, P is 30.974, O is 160.0.

So 24.305 +14.007 =38.312. Then +16.128 =54.44. Then +30.974 =85.414. Then +160.0 =245.414 g/mol.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O as Mg(NH4)PO4 plus 6 H2O.

So the molar mass would be:

Mg:24.305
N:14.007
H:4 (from NH4) + 2*6 (from H2O) =4 +12=16 → 16 *1.008 =16.128
P:30.974
O: (4 from PO4) + (6 from H2O) =10 → 10 *16=160.0

So yes, the total molar mass is 24.305 +14.007 +16.128 +30.974 +160.0 = let's add them step by step.

24.305 +14.007 =38.312

38.312 +16.128 =54.44

54.44 +30.974 =85.414

85.414 +160.0 =245.414 g/mol.

So, each mole of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O weighs 245.414 grams.

Now, we have 5,859.9 moles of this precipitate.

Mass = moles * molar mass =5,859.9 mol * 245.414 g/mol.

Let me compute that.

First, approximate 5,859.9 *245.414.

Let me break it down:

5,859.9 * 200 = 1,171,980 g

5,859.9 *45 = let's compute 5,859.9 *40=234,396; 5,859.9 *5=29,299.5 → total 234,396 +29,299.5=263,695.5 g

5,859.9 *5.414 ≈ let's approximate:

5,859.9 *5=29,299.5

5,859.9 *0.414 ≈5,859.9 *0.4=2,343.96; 5,859.9 *0.014≈82.04 → total ≈2,343.96 +82.04=2,426.0

So 29,299.5 +2,426.0≈31,725.5 g.

Now add all parts: 1,171,980 +263,695.5 =1,435,675.5 +31,725.5 =1,467,401 g.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me try a more accurate approach.

Alternatively, 5,859.9 * 245.414 = ?

Let me compute 5,859.9 * 245.414.

Well, 5,859.9 * 245.414 ≈ 5,859.9 *245.414.

Let me use exact calculation:

5,859.9 *245.414 = ?

Well, perhaps it's easier to compute 5,859.9 * 245.414 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator approach:

5,859.9 *245.414

Let's compute:

5,859.9 * 200 = 1,171,980

5,859.9 *40 =234,396

5,859.9 *5 =29,299.5

5,859.9 *0.4 =2,343.96

5,859.9 *0.014 =82.0386

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can compute 245.414 *5,859.9.

But perhaps a better way is to consider that 5,859.9 is approximately 5,860.

So 5,860 *245.414 = ?

Let me compute 5,860 *245.414.

First, 5,860 *200 =1,172,000

5,860 *40=234,400

5,860 *5=29,300

5,860 *0.414=5,860*(0.4 +0.014)=5,860*0.4=2,344 +5,860*0.014=82.04 → total 2,344 +82.04=2,426.04

Now, adding all together:

1,172,000 +234,400 =1,406,400

1,406,400 +29,300 =1,435,700

1,435,700 +2,426.04 =1,438,126.04 grams.

So approximately 1,438,126 grams, which is 1,438.126 kg.

Wait, that's about 1,438 kg.

Looking back at the options, option E is 1.433 ×10^3 kg, which is 1,433 kg. Option C is 1.433 ×10^4 kg, which is 14,330 kg. Option H is 14,330 kg, and option E is 1,433 kg.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the mass is approximately 1,438 kg, which is close to option E (1,433 kg) but a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of H2PO4^-.

Earlier, I found that the mass of H2PO4^- is 567.8115 kg, but wait, no, wait: 567,811.5 grams is 567.8115 kg. Then, moles = 567,811.5 g /97.0 g/mol ≈5,859.899 mol.

But wait, perhaps the molar mass of H2PO4^- is more accurately calculated.

H2PO4^-: H=1.008 *2=2.016, P=30.974, O=16.00 *4=64.00 → total 2.016 +30.974 +64=97.0 g/mol. So that part is correct.

So 567,811.5 g /97.0 g/mol =5,859.899 mol.

Then, molar mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O is 245.414 g/mol.

So 5,859.899 mol *245.414 g/mol = ?

Let me compute 5,859.899 *245.414.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 5,859.899 *245.414 = ?

Well, 5,859.9 *245.414.

Let me compute it accurately:

245.414 × 5,859.9.

Let me break it down as:

245.414 × 5,000 =1,227,070

245.414 ×800=196,331.2

245.414 ×50=12,270.7

245.414 ×9.9=24,300.0 (approx)

Adding these up:

1,227,070 +196,331.2 =1,423,401.2

1,423,401.2 +12,270.7=1,435,671.9

1,435,671.9 +24,300=1,460,  (wait, 9.9 is 9 +0.9)

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me compute 245.414 × 5,859.9:

Alternatively, 5,859.9 × 245.414:

I can use the formula (a × b) where a=5,859.9 and b=245.414.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator approach:

5,859.9 × 245.414 = ?

Let me compute 5,859.9 × 200 =1,171,980

5,859.9 ×45 = 5,859.9 ×40 =234,396; 5,859.9 ×5=29,299.5 → total 234,396 +29,299.5=263,695.5

5,859.9 ×5.414 = ?

Wait, 5,859.9 ×5 =29,299.5

5,859.9 ×0.414 = let's compute:

5,859.9 ×0.4 =2,343.96

5,859.9 ×0.014=82.0386

So total 2,343.96 +82.0386=2,426.00.

So 29,299.5 +2,426.00=31,725.5

Now, sum all parts:

1,171,980 (from 200) +263,695.5 (from45) +31,725.5 (from5.414) =

1,171,980 +263,695.5 =1,435,675.5

1,435,675.5 +31,725.5 =1,467,401 grams.

Wait, that's 1,467,401 grams, which is 1,467.401 kg.

Hmm, that's about 1,467 kg. But earlier I thought it was ~1,438 kg. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 5,859.9 * 245.414.

Let me compute 5,859.9 ×245.414:

It's equivalent to 5,859.9 × (200 +40 +5 +0.414) =5,859.9×200 +5,859.9×40 +5,859.9×5 +5,859.9×0.414.

Compute each part:

5,859.9 ×200 =1,171,980

5,859.9 ×40 =234,396

5,859.9 ×5 =29,299.5

5,859.9 ×0.414:

First, 5,859.9 ×0.4 =2,343.96

5,859.9 ×0.014=82.0386

So total 2,343.96 +82.0386 =2,425.9986 ≈2,426.0

Now add all parts:

1,171,980 +234,396 =1,406,376

1,406,376 +29,299.5 =1,435,675.5

1,435,675.5 +2,426.0 =1,438,101.5 grams.

So 1,438,101.5 grams =1,438.1015 kg.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.433 ×10^3 kg =1,433 kg.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 1,438 kg, which is close to 1,433 kg. The slight discrepancy could be due to rounding during calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial steps again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the initial calculation of the mass of H2PO4^-.

We had 5 million gallons, which is 5,000,000 gallons. Converted to liters: 5,000,000 *3.78541 ≈18,927,050 liters.

Concentration is 30 mg/L, so total mg of H2PO4^- is 30 *18,927,050 =567,811,500 mg → 567,811.5 grams → 567.8115 kg.

Molar mass of H2PO4^- is 97 g/mol.

Moles =567,811.5 g /97 g/mol ≈5,859.9 moles.

Molar mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O is 245.414 g/mol.

Mass =5,859.9 *245.414 ≈1,438,101 grams =1,438.1 kg.

So the closest option is E:1.433 ×10^3 kg.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the molar mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

Wait, let me recheck the molar mass calculation.

Mg:24.305
N:14.007
H: from NH4 (4 H) + from 6 H2O (12 H) → total 16 H →16 *1.008=16.128
P:30.974
O:4 (from PO4) +6 (from H2O) =10 →10 *16=160.0

Adding them up: 24.305 +14.007 =38.312

38.312 +16.128 =54.44

54.44 +30.974 =85.414

85.414 +160.0 =245.414 g/mol. That seems correct.

So the mass is 5,859.9 mol *245.414 g/mol =1,438,101 g →1,438.1 kg.

But the options don't have that exact number. The closest is E:1,433 kg. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using 30 ppm as mg/L, but sometimes ppm can be parts per million by mass, so perhaps I should adjust for the density of water, but since water is approximately 1 kg/L, 30 ppm would be 30 mg/L, which is what I used. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume conversion.

Wait, 5 million gallons is 5,000,000 gallons. 1 gallon is 3.78541 liters, so 5,000,000 *3.78541 =18,927,050 liters.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach, like using the given 41.7 million lb. of wastewater per day. Wait, the problem states that 5 million gallons is 41.7 million lb. So the mass of the wastewater is 41.7e6 lb. → 41.7e6 *453.59 g/lb = let's compute that.

41.7e6 lb *453.59 g/lb =41.7e6 *453.59 g.

But maybe we can use this to find the mass of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but since the concentration is 30 ppm, which is mg/L, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total mass of H2PO4^- in the wastewater is 30 mg/L * volume in liters.

Volume in liters is 5e6 gallons *3.78541 =18,927,050 liters.

So 30 mg/L *18,927,050 L =567,811,500 mg →567,811.5 grams →567.8115 kg.

Molar mass of H2PO4^- is 97 g/mol → moles =567.8115 /97 ≈5,859.9 mol.

Then, Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O molar mass is 245.414 g/mol.

Mass =5,859.9 *245.414 = let me compute this accurately.

5,859.9 *245.414.

I can write 5,859.9 as 5,860 for approximation.

5,860 *245.414 = ?

Well, 5,860 *245 = let's compute:

5,860 *200=1,172,000

5,860 *40=234,400

5,860 *5=29,300

So 1,172,000 +234,400=1,406,400 +29,300=1,435,700.

Now, 5,860 *0.414=5,860*(0.4 +0.014)=5,860*0.4=2,344 +5,860*0.014=82.04 → total 2,344 +82.04=2,426.04.

Adding to 1,435,700 gives 1,435,700 +2,426.04=1,438,126.04 grams →1,438.126 kg.

So approximately 1,438 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:1.433 ×10^3 kg, which is 1,433 kg.

Hmm, perhaps the slight difference is due to rounding during calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the molar mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O. Let me recalculate it precisely.

Mg: 24.305

N:14.007

H:4 (from NH4) +12 (from 6 H2O) =16 →16 *1.008=16.128

P:30.974

O:4 (from PO4) +6 (from H2O) =10 →10 *16.00=160.0

Adding them:24.305 +14.007=38.312

38.312 +16.128=54.44

54.44 +30.974=85.414

85.414 +160.0=245.414 g/mol.

That's correct.

So the calculation seems accurate. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 1,438 kg, which is closest to option E:1.433 ×10^3 kg.

Wait, but wait, let me check if the initial mass of H2PO4- was correct.

Wait, the problem states that the city processes 5 million gal. (41.7 million lb.) daily of wastewater containing 30 ppm H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total mass of H2PO4^- is 30 ppm in the wastewater, which is 41.7e6 lb. So 30 ppm would be 30 mg per kg of wastewater, since 1 kg is about 1 liter, and ppm is mg/kg.

Wait, but if the wastewater is 41.7e6 lb, that's 41.7e6 *453.59 g = let's compute that.

41,700,000 lb *453.59 g/lb = 41,700,000 *453.59 = let me compute.

41,700,000 *453.59 = ?

Well, 41,700,000 *400 =16,680,000,000

41,700,000 *53.59 = ?

Compute 41,700,000 *50=2,085,000,000

41,700,000 *3.59=150,  (41,700,000 *3=125,100,000; 41,700,000 *0.59=24,603,000 → total 125,100,000 +24,603,000=149,703,000)

So 2,085,000,000 +149,703,000 =2,234,703,000 → total 16,680,000,000 +2,234,703,000 =18,914,703,000 grams →18,914,703 kg.

So the mass of wastewater is 18,914,703 kg.

Now, the concentration is 30 ppm of H2PO4^-, which is 30 mg/kg →30 g/metric ton.

So the mass of H2PO4^- is 30 mg/kg *18,914,703,000 g → 30 *18,914,703,000 mg → wait, no, wait: 30 ppm is 30 mg per kg, so for 18,914,703 kg of wastewater, the mass of H2PO4^- is 30 *18,914,703 mg.

30 *18,914,703 mg =567,441,090 mg →567,441.09 grams →567.44109 kg.

Which is very close to the earlier calculation of 567.8115 kg. So that's correct.

So moles of H2PO4^- is 567.44109 kg /97 g/mol ≈5,850.0 mol.

Then, mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O is 5,850.0 mol *245.414 g/mol =1,416, 666 grams →1,416.666 kg.

Wait, but earlier I had 1,438 kg. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, 567.44109 kg /97 g/mol =567,441.09 g /97 g/mol =5,850.0 mol.

Wait, 5,850.0 mol *245.414 g/mol =5,850 *245.414.

Compute 5,850 *245 = let's compute 5,000 *245 =1,225,000; 850 *245=208,250 → total 1,225,000 +208,250=1,433,250.

Then 5,850 *0.414=5,850 *0.4=2,340; 5,850 *0.014=81.9 → total 2,340 +81.9=2,421.9.

So total mass is 1,433,250 +2,421.9=1,435,671.9 grams →1,435.67 kg.

Which rounds to approximately 1,436 kg.

Looking at the options, option E is 1,433 kg, which is very close.

So considering all that, the correct answer should be E:1.433 ×10^3 kg.

To determine how much magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (Mg(NH₄)PO₄·6H₂O) can be produced, we start by calculating the mass of H₂PO₄⁻ in the wastewater. The city processes 5 million gallons of wastewater daily, which corresponds to 41.7 million pounds. The concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ is 30 ppm, equivalent to 30 mg/L. 

### Step 1: Convert wastewater volume to liters
1 gallon ≈ 3.78541 liters, so:
\[
5 \times 10^6 \, \text{gal} \times 3.78541 \, \text{L/gal} = 18,927,050 \, \text{L}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of H₂PO₄⁻
The concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ is 30 mg/L. The total mass of H₂PO₄⁻ is:
\[
30 \, \text{mg/L} \times 18,927,050 \, \text{L} = 567,811,500 \, \text{mg} = 567.8115 \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert mass to moles
The molar mass of H₂PO₄⁻ is:
\[
2(1.008) + 30.974 + 4(16.00) = 97.0 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The number of moles of H₂PO₄⁻ is:
\[
\frac{567,811.5 \, \text{g}}{97.0 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 5,859.9 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine moles of Mg(NH₄)PO₄·6H₂O
From the balanced reaction:
\[
5H_2O + H_2PO_4^- + MgO + NH_4^+ \rightarrow Mg(NH_4)PO_4 \cdot 6H_2O,
\]
1 mole of H₂PO₄⁻ produces 1 mole of Mg(NH₄)PO₄·6H₂O. Thus, the moles of Mg(NH₄)PO₄·6H₂O are:
\[
5,859.9 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the molar mass of Mg(NH₄)PO₄·6H₂O
The molar mass is calculated as:
\[
\text{Mg: } 24.305, \, \text{N: } 14.007, \, \text{H: } 16 \times 1.008 = 16.128, \, \text{P: } 30.974, \, \text{O: } 10 \times 16.00 = 160.0.
\]
\[
\text{Total molar mass} = 24.305 + 14.007 + 16.128 + 30.974 + 160.0 = 245.414 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the mass of Mg(NH₄)PO₄·6H₂O
The mass is:
\[
5,859.9 \, \text{mol} \times 245.414 \, \text{g/mol} = 1,438,101 \, \text{g} = 1,438.1 \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Step 7: Match with the closest option
The calculated mass (1,438.1 kg) is closest to option **E: 1.433 × 10³ kg**.

**Answer: E**
