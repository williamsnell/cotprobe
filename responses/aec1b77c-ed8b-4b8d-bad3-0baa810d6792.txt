Okay, so I'm trying to solve this insurance problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. Mr. and Mrs. Miller bought a house and land for $32,700. They think the land is worth $5,500. Now, they want to insure the house at 80% of its estimated value. The question is, how much insurance should they purchase?

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out the value of the house separately from the land. The total amount they paid is $32,700, and they estimate the land is $5,500. So, to find the house value, I subtract the land value from the total. Let me do that: $32,700 minus $5,500. Let me calculate that.

32,700 minus 5,500. Well, 32,700 minus 5,000 is 27,700, and then minus another 500 would be 27,200. So the house is worth $27,200. 

Wait, no, wait. Is that correct? Let me check again. 32,700 minus 5,500. Let's break it down. 32,700 minus 5,000 is indeed 27,700. Then subtract 500 more: 27,700 minus 500 is 27,200. Yeah, that's right.

Now, they want to insure the house at 80% of its value. So I need to find 80% of $27,200. To calculate that, I can multiply 27,200 by 0.8.

Let me do that. 27,200 times 0.8. Hmm. Well, 27,200 times 0.8. Let me think: 27,200 divided by 10 is 2,720, so 8 times that would be 21,760. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 27,200 times 0.8 is the same as 80% of 27,200. Alternatively, I can break it down: 27,200 * 0.8.

Let me compute it step by step. 27,200 multiplied by 0.8. 

First, 27,200 * 0.8: 27,200 * 0.8 is 21,760. Let me confirm that: 27,200 * 0.8. 20,000 * 0.8 is 16,000, 7,000 *0.8 is 5,600, and 200 *0.8 is 160. Adding them up: 16,000 +5,600 is 21,600, plus 160 is 21,760. Yes, that's correct.

So the insurance they should purchase is $21,760. Now looking at the options, option B is $21,760. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total was $32,700, land $5,500, so house is 32,700-5,500=27,200. 80% of that is 27,200 *0.8=21,760. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be B.

The house's value is calculated by subtracting the land value from the total purchase price: $32,700 - $5,500 = $27,200. To find 80% of the house's value: 27,200 * 0.8 = $21,760.

Answer: B
