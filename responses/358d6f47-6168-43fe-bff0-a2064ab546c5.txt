Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about translating a given proposition into English using a specific key, and then choosing the correct option from A to J.

The proposition is: (∃x)[(Ax • Lx) • (∃y)(Hy • Bxy)]

First, I need to understand each part of this statement. Let's parse it.

The main structure is an existential quantifier for x: (∃x)[ ... ]. Inside this, there's a conjunction (•) between two parts. The first part is (Ax • Lx), which means "x is an apartment and x is large." So this part is saying there exists an x that is both an apartment and large. So, in other words, there's at least one large apartment.

Then, the second part of the conjunction is another existential quantifier for y: (∃y)(Hy • Bxy). This means "there exists a y such that y is a house and x is bigger than y." So, for this particular x (which is a large apartment), there's some y that's a house and x is bigger than y. So, the large apartment x is bigger than some house y.

Putting it all together, the entire proposition is saying: There exists a large apartment that is bigger than some house.

Now, I need to translate this into a natural English sentence. Let's see.

The first part, (∃x)(Ax • Lx), is "There exists a large apartment." The second part, (∃y)(Hy • Bxy), is "there exists a house y that x is bigger than y." So, combining them, it's saying "There is a large apartment that is bigger than some house."

So the English interpretation would be something like "Some large apartments are bigger than some houses."

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this.

Option E says: "Some large apartments are bigger than some houses." That seems to match exactly what we have.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: All large apartments are bigger than some houses. Wait, the original statement says "some large apartments" not "all." So A is too strong because it's saying every large apartment is bigger than some house, which isn't what the proposition states.

Option B: Some small houses are smaller than some large apartments. Hmm, the proposition talks about large apartments being bigger than some houses, but it doesn't specify whether the houses are small or not. So B is about small houses, which isn't directly covered by the proposition.

Option C: All houses are smaller than some large apartments. Again, the proposition only says that there's at least one large apartment that's bigger than at least one house. It doesn't say all houses are like that, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Some houses are bigger than all large apartments. That's the opposite of what we have. We have a large apartment bigger than some houses, so D is wrong.

Option E: As discussed, correct.

Option F: Some houses are the same size as some large apartments. The proposition doesn't talk about equality in size, only about being bigger, so F is out.

Option G: No large apartments are bigger than houses. That's the opposite of our statement, which says some are, so G is wrong.

Option H: Some houses are bigger than some large apartments. Wait, the proposition says the apartment is bigger than the house, so H is the reverse. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Some large houses are bigger than some apartments. The proposition doesn't talk about large houses, only about large apartments. So I is not matching.

Option J: Some large apartments are smaller than some houses. Again, the opposite of the proposition, which says the apartment is bigger, so J is wrong.

So, after checking all options, E is the correct one.

The proposition states that there exists a large apartment that is bigger than some house. This translates to "Some large apartments are bigger than some houses," which corresponds to option E.
