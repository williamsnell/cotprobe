Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a positive integer N such that both N and N squared end with the same sequence of four digits abcd in base 10. Also, the digit a can't be zero, and I need to find the three-digit number abc.

Hmm, let me break this down. The problem is about the last four digits of N and N² being the same. So essentially, N² ≡ N mod 10000. That means N² - N ≡ 0 mod 10000, which simplifies to N(N - 1) ≡ 0 mod 10000. So N and N-1 are consecutive integers, and their product is divisible by 10000.

Since 10000 factors into 2^4 * 5^4, both N and N-1 must be such that one is divisible by 16 (2^4) and the other by 625 (5^4), because they are consecutive and thus coprime. So either N ≡ 0 mod 16 and N ≡ 1 mod 625, or N ≡ 0 mod 625 and N ≡ 1 mod 16.

I think using the Chinese Remainder Theorem would be the way to go here. Let me consider both cases.

First case: N ≡ 0 mod 16 and N ≡ 1 mod 625.

So N = 16k for some integer k. Then 16k ≡ 1 mod 625. I need to solve for k.

16k ≡ 1 mod 625 ⇒ 16k = 1 + 625m ⇒ k = (1 + 625m)/16. Since k must be an integer, (1 + 625m) must be divisible by 16.

625 mod 16: 625 /16 = 39*16=624, so 625 ≡ 1 mod16. So 1 + 625m ≡ 1 + m ≡ 0 mod16 ⇒ m ≡ -1 mod16 ⇒ m=15 +16t.

So k = (1 + 625*(15 +16t))/16 = (1 + 9375 + 10000t)/16 = (9376 +10000t)/16.

9376 /16: 9376 ÷16: 16*586=9376, so k=586 + 625t. Therefore, N=16k=16*(586 +625t)=9376 +10000t.

So the smallest positive N in this case is 9376. Let me check N²: 9376². Let me compute 9376 squared.

Wait, I remember that 9376 is a known automorphic number, which means its square ends with the same digits. So 9376² should end with 9376. Let me confirm.

Compute 9376²:

Well, 9376 * 9376. Let me compute it step by step.

But maybe I can just compute the last four digits by considering modulo 10000. Since 9376 ≡ -624 mod 10000, but perhaps that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, since N=9376, N² mod10000 should be N² - k*10000 where k is such that it leaves the last four digits. But since I know 9376 is an automorphic number, I can trust that N² ends with 9376.

So N=9376 is a solution. But wait, are there any smaller solutions?

Wait, the problem says N is a positive integer, so 0 is excluded, but 9376 is the smallest four-digit number in this case.

Now the second case: N ≡0 mod625 and N≡1 mod16.

So N=625k. Then 625k ≡1 mod16.

Compute 625 mod16: 625 ÷16=39*16=624, so 625 ≡1 mod16. So 625k ≡k ≡1 mod16 ⇒k=1 +16m.

Thus N=625*(1 +16m)=625 +10000m. So the smallest N in this case is 625. Let me check 625²=390625, which ends with 0625. So the last four digits are 0625, not 625. So 625's last four digits are 0625, which doesn't match N=625, since N is 0625. But the problem says a is nonzero, so 0625 is invalid because a=0. So this solution is invalid because a must be non-zero.

So the only valid solution is N=9376, which ends with 9376, so the last four digits are abcd=9376. So a=9, b=3, c=7, d=6. The question asks for the three-digit number abc, which is 937.

Looking at the options, option G is 937. So the answer should be G.

The problem requires finding a positive integer N such that both N and N² end with the same four digits abcd, where a is nonzero. This implies N² ≡ N mod 10000, leading to N(N - 1) ≡ 0 mod 10000. Since 10000 = 2⁴ × 5⁴, N and N-1 must be divisible by 16 and 625, respectively, or vice versa.

Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:

1. **Case 1**: N ≡ 0 mod 16 and N ≡ 1 mod 625.
   - Solving, N = 9376, which is an automorphic number, meaning its square ends with 9376. Thus, the last four digits are 9376, and abc = 937.

2. **Case 2**: N ≡ 0 mod 625 and N ≡ 1 mod 16.
   - Solving, N = 625, but its square ends with 0625, which is invalid since a = 0.

The only valid solution is N = 9376, giving abc = 937.
