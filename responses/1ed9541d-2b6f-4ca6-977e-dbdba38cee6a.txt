Okay, so I've got this question about describing a work group with certain characteristics. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says the work group comprises workers with demarcated tasks and distant line managers. Hmm, demarcated tasks mean that each person has clearly defined responsibilities, right? So there's a clear division of labor. And distant line managersâ€”so the managers aren't closely involved or overseeing each day-to-day work closely. They're more hands-off, I guess.

I need to think about what kind of work group structure this describes. The options are A to I, with various terms like interdependent, cohesive, integrated, etc. 

Let's go through the options one by one. 

A: Interdependent. That means each person depends on others to complete their tasks. But if tasks are demarcated, maybe they don't need to rely heavily on each other. So maybe not A.

B: Co-dependent. That sounds similar to interdependent, but I think co-dependent might imply a less healthy dependency, more like codependency in psychology. Not sure if that's the right fit here.

C: Cohesive. That refers to the group being close-knit and working well together. But if the line managers are distant, does that affect cohesion? Maybe not directly. Cohesive is about group unity, which might not be the main point here.

D: Integrated. That suggests the group is merged or combined in some way. But with demarcated tasks, maybe they're more separate, so integrated doesn't seem right.

E: Synergistic. That's when the group's combined effect is greater than the sum of individual efforts. But if tasks are separate and managers are distant, maybe there's less synergy. So maybe not E.

F: Independent. That would mean each worker operates on their own without much reliance on others. Since tasks are demarcated, each person might work independently on their part. Also, distant managers might mean less oversight, so they can work more independently. That seems like a possible fit.

G: Collaborative. That implies working together, which requires some level of interaction. If the tasks are clearly divided and managers are distant, maybe collaboration isn't the main feature here.

H: Hierarchical. That refers to a structure with clear levels of authority. Distant line managers might fit a hierarchical structure where managers are at a higher level and not involved day-to-day. So this could be a possibility.

I: Dependent. That would mean relying on others. If tasks are clearly demarcated, maybe the workers aren't as dependent on each other, but they might be dependent on management. But the question is about how to describe the work group, so I'm not sure if dependent is the right term.

Wait, the question is asking how to describe the work group, so I'm focusing on the group's structure rather than the dependency on management. So if the group has clear tasks and distant managers, it might be more about each person working independently without much need for others. That would point towards F: Independent.

Alternatively, hierarchical (H) could also fit because distant managers imply a clear chain of command. But the question is about the group itself, not the management structure. So maybe F is better.

Another angle: in an independent group, each member works on their own tasks with less need for others. Since their tasks are demarcated, they don't necessarily need to collaborate much. So F seems correct.

The work group described has clearly defined tasks and distant line managers, suggesting that each member operates independently without heavy reliance on others or close oversight. This aligns with the term "Independent."

Answer: F
