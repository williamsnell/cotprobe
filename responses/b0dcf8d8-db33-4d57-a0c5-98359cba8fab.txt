Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about drafts and discounts. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about Holmes Bros accepting a draft. The draft is dated July 10 for $326.80 at 5%, payable 90 days after date. There are two parts: (a) how much was paid if Holmes Bros paid it when due, and (b) if the draft was discounted at 5.5% 30 days before maturity with a 1/4% collection fee charged. We need to find the proceeds in both cases, and the options are given from A to J.

First, I'll tackle part (a). So, Holmes Bros is accepting the draft, which means they're the drawee, right? When they accept it, they agree to pay it when it's due. So part (a) is straightforward: when the draft is paid when due, the amount paid is just the face value, which is $326.80. So the first part's answer should be $326.80. That seems easy enough.

Now, part (b) is where it gets a bit trickier. We have to calculate the proceeds if the draft was discounted 30 days before maturity at 5.5% and a 1/4% collection fee was charged. The options have the second part as various amounts, so I need to compute this carefully.

Let me break this down. The draft is payable 90 days after July 10. So the maturity date is 90 days from July 10. Let me figure out what that date is, but maybe I don't need the exact date, just the time until discounting.

The draft is discounted 30 days before maturity, so the discounting happens at 30 days before the 90-day period ends. That means the discount period is for 30 days, and the remaining period after discounting is 60 days until maturity. So the discount rate is 5.5%, and the time is 30 days. Also, there's a 1/4% collection fee on the proceeds.

Wait, when you discount a bill, the formula is usually: Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * Rate * Time). But here, there's also a collection fee, which is 1/4% of the proceeds. So the total deduction would be the discount plus the fee. Or wait, is the fee applied after the discount? I think so.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the discount amount: 5.5% annual rate for 30 days on $326.80.
2. Subtract the discount from the face value to get the proceeds before the collection fee.
3. Then, calculate the collection fee on these proceeds and subtract that as well.

Alternatively, sometimes the fee is applied before the discount, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says a (1/4)% collection fee was charged. Hmm, maybe it's applied after the discount. Let me think. Typically, the discount is calculated first, and then any fees are applied to the resulting proceeds.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the discount for 30 days at 5.5%. Since the year is 360 days, the discount rate per day is 5.5% / 360.

So discount rate per day = 0.055 / 360 = approximately 0.000152778 per day.

For 30 days, the discount amount is 326.80 * 0.055 * (30/360) = 326.80 * 0.055 * (1/12).

Let me compute that:

0.055 * (1/12) = 0.00458333.

So 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ let me calculate:

326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 326.80 * 0.00458333.

Let me compute 326.80 * 0.00458333:

First, 326.80 * 0.004 = 1.3072.

Then, 326.80 * 0.00058333 ≈ 326.80 * 0.0005 = 0.1634, and 326.80 * 0.00008333 ≈ 0.027233.

Adding them up: 1.3072 + 0.1634 = 1.4706 + 0.027233 ≈ 1.4978.

So the discount amount is approximately $1.4978, which I can round to $1.498.

So the proceeds before the collection fee would be 326.80 - 1.498 ≈ 325.302.

Now, the collection fee is 1/4% of the proceeds. So 0.25% of 325.302.

0.25% is 0.0025 in decimal.

325.302 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.813255.

So the collection fee is approximately $0.8133.

Therefore, the total proceeds would be 325.302 - 0.8133 ≈ 324.4887, which is about $324.49.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the order of applying the fee and discount. Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is applied before the discount? Let me check that possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is applied on the discounted amount. Let me try calculating it that way.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the draft was discounted at 5.5% and a 1/4% collection fee was charged. So perhaps both are deducted from the face value. But I'm not sure if the collection fee is applied after the discount or before.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is:

Total deduction = discount + collection fee. But the discount is calculated on the face value, and the collection fee is on the face value as well? Or is it on the discounted amount?

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is on the discounted amount, but I'm not certain. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated on the face value, and the collection fee is on the discounted amount, so the total proceeds would be face value minus discount minus fee.

Wait, let me try computing it as:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * discount rate * time) - (Face Value * discount rate * time * fee rate).

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is applied after the discount, so it's calculated on the discounted amount.

Wait, let me try this again.

First, compute the discount amount: 5.5% per annum, for 30 days.

So discount = 326.80 * (5.5/100) * (30/360) = 326.80 * 0.055 * (1/12).

As before, 0.055 * 1/12 = 0.00458333.

So discount = 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 1.4978, so $1.498.

Then, the amount after discount is 326.80 - 1.498 ≈ 325.302.

Now, the collection fee is 1/4% of this amount, so 0.25% of 325.302.

0.25% is 0.0025, so 325.302 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.813255, which is about $0.8133.

So the proceeds would be 325.302 - 0.8133 ≈ 324.4887, which is approximately $324.49.

But looking at the options, I don't see any option where part (b) is $324.49. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use 360 days for all calculations, so 30 days is exactly 30/360 = 1/12 of a year.

Let me recalculate the discount more accurately.

5.5% per annum for 30 days: 5.5% is 0.055, so 0.055 * (30/360) = 0.055 * (1/12) ≈ 0.00458333.

So the discount is 326.80 * 0.00458333.

Calculating that precisely:

326.80 * 0.00458333.

Let me compute 326.80 * 0.004 = 1.3072.

326.80 * 0.00058333 = ?

0.00058333 is approximately 1/1716.666, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 0.00058333 is 5.8333e-4.

So 326.80 * 5.8333e-4 ≈ (326.80 * 5.8333) * 1e-4.

326.80 * 5.8333 ≈ let's compute 326.80 * 5 = 1634, 326.80 * 0.8333 ≈ 272.333. So total approx 1634 + 272.333 = 1906.333.

Multiply by 1e-4: 1906.333 * 0.0001 ≈ 0.1906333.

So the discount is 1.3072 + 0.1906333 ≈ 1.4978, as before. So that part is correct.

Proceeds after discount: 326.80 - 1.4978 ≈ 325.3022.

Now the collection fee is 0.25% of 325.3022, which is 0.0025 * 325.3022 ≈ 0.8132555.

So proceeds after fee: 325.3022 - 0.8132555 ≈ 324.4889, which is about $324.49.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I messed up the order. Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is calculated on the face value, not the discounted amount.

Let me try that. So the discount is subtracted, then the fee is on the face value.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the fee is a collection fee, which would logically be on the amount collected, which would be after discounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is applied before the discount. Let me try that.

So first, calculate the fee on the face value: 0.25% of 326.80 is 0.0025 * 326.80 ≈ 0.817.

Then, subtract the fee and discount.

Wait, but if the fee is subtracted first, then the discount is calculated on the remaining amount. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the fee is added to the discount as deductions from the face value.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * discount rate * time) - (Face Value * fee rate).

So:

Proceeds = 326.80 - (326.80 * 0.055 * 30/360) - (326.80 * 0.0025).

Compute each part:

Discount: 326.80 * 0.055 * 30/360 = 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 1.4978.

Fee: 326.80 * 0.0025 = 0.817.

So total deductions: 1.4978 + 0.817 ≈ 2.3148.

Proceeds: 326.80 - 2.3148 ≈ 324.4852, which is about $324.49.

Again, same result. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the time. Let me check the time again. The discount is 30 days before maturity, so the time is 30 days. But the maturity is 90 days from July 10, so the discounting is at day 90 - 30 = 60 days from the date. Wait, no, the discount is taken 30 days before the maturity, so the time for discounting is 30 days. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discount rate. Let me re-express the discount calculation.

The discount rate is 5.5%, so for 30 days, it's (5.5/360)*30 = (5.5 * 30)/360 = 165/360 = 0.458333...%.

So discount amount is 326.80 * 0.458333% = 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 1.4978, which is the same as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but more likely, I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the collection fee is applied on the discounted amount, not the face value. Let me try that again.

After discounting, the amount is 326.80 - 1.4978 ≈ 325.3022.

Then, the collection fee is 0.25% of this, so 0.25% of 325.3022 is ≈0.813255.

So total proceeds are 325.3022 - 0.813255 ≈ 324.4889, which is about $324.49.

But in the options, I don't see a (b) with $324.49. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 326.80, 330.89

B: 326.80, 328.54

C: 328.54, 326.80

D: 328.54, 327.20

E: 330.89, 330.89

F: 332.00, 330.50

G: 326.80, 329.00

H: 332.00, 329.65

I: 330.89, 328.54

J: 330.89, 327.20

Hmm, the closest is option J, where part (b) is $327.20. But my calculation got $324.49, which is lower than that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the discount is calculated on the face value, but the collection fee is on the face value, not the discounted amount. Let me try that.

So discount is $1.4978, fee is 0.25% of 326.80, which is 0.817.

So total deductions: 1.4978 + 0.817 ≈ 2.3148.

Proceeds: 326.80 - 2.3148 ≈ 324.4852, same as before.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discount. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the discount is calculated on the maturity value, which includes any interest.

Wait, but the draft is accepted at 5%, so the maturity value is Face + interest. Wait, no, the draft is for $326.80 at 5%, so the maturity value is $326.80 plus interest for 90 days at 5%. Wait, but the question says the draft was accepted at 5%, so perhaps the maturity value is the face plus interest. Let me check.

Wait, the draft is "dated July 10 for $326.80 at 5%, payable 90 days after date." So the 5% is the interest rate. So the maturity value is face value plus interest.

So Maturity Value = Face + (Face * rate * time).

So that's 326.80 + (326.80 * 0.05 * 90/360).

Compute that:

Interest = 326.80 * 0.05 * 0.25 = 326.80 * 0.0125 = 4.085.

So Maturity Value = 326.80 + 4.085 = 330.885 ≈ $330.89.

Wait a minute, that's part (a)'s answer. So part (a) is $330.89, not $326.80. But that contradicts my initial thought.

Wait, hold on. The question says, "How much was paid if Holmes Bros paid it when due?" So if the draft is accepted at 5%, that means the maturity value is higher than the face value. So Holmes Bros would have to pay the maturity value, which includes the interest.

So part (a) is actually $330.885, which is approximately $330.89. So that changes things. So part (a) is $330.89, not $326.80. That's a mistake I made earlier.

Now, part (b) is different because the discounting is done on the maturity value, perhaps? Or on the face value? Wait, when you discount a bill, you discount the face value, not the maturity value, because the face value is the principal, and the interest is added separately.

Wait, no. When you accept a draft at a certain interest rate, the maturity value includes the interest. But when you discount the draft, you're discounting the face value, not the maturity value. Because the discount is on the principal, not the interest.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

When a bill is accepted, the maturity value is face value plus interest. So if the draft is accepted at 5% for 90 days, the maturity value is 326.80 + (326.80 * 0.05 * 90/360) = 326.80 + 4.085 = 330.885.

So if Holmes Bros pays when due, they pay $330.89, which is part (a).

Now, part (b) is about discounting the draft 30 days before maturity. So the draft is discounted 30 days before the 90-day period ends. So the maturity is day 90, so discounting is at day 60.

Wait, but the discount is taken on the face value, the principal, not the maturity value. So the discount is on $326.80, not on the maturity value of $330.89.

So the discount amount is calculated on $326.80 at 5.5% for 30 days.

So discount = 326.80 * (5.5/100) * (30/360) = 326.80 * 0.055 * 1/12 ≈ 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 1.4978.

So the amount after discount is 326.80 - 1.4978 ≈ 325.3022.

Then, the collection fee is 1/4% of the discounted amount, which is 325.3022 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.813255.

So the proceeds would be 325.3022 - 0.813255 ≈ 324.4889, which is about $324.49.

But that's still not matching any of the options. Wait, but the options for part (b) are higher than that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the discount is on the maturity value, not the face value. Let me try that.

Maturity value is $330.89. Discounting that at 5.5% for 30 days.

So discount amount = 330.89 * 0.055 * (30/360) = 330.89 * 0.055 * 1/12 ≈ 330.89 * 0.00458333 ≈ let's compute:

330.89 * 0.004 = 1.32356.

330.89 * 0.00058333 ≈ 0.1932.

Total ≈ 1.32356 + 0.1932 ≈ 1.51676.

So discount is approximately $1.5168.

Proceeds after discount: 330.89 - 1.5168 ≈ 329.3732.

Then, collection fee is 1/4% of 329.3732, which is 0.25% * 329.3732 ≈ 0.823433.

Proceeds after fee: 329.3732 - 0.823433 ≈ 328.5498, which is approximately $328.55.

Looking at the options, part (b) for option I is $328.54, and option J is $327.20. So $328.55 is close to option I's part (b).

But wait, in this case, part (a) would be $330.89, and part (b) would be $328.55, which would match option I: A: 330.89, B: 328.54.

But let me check the options again. Option I says part (a) is 330.89, part (b) is 328.54.

Wait, but I'm not sure if discounting is done on the face value or the maturity value. Because when you discount a bill, you usually discount the face value, not the maturity value. So perhaps I should stick to the face value.

Wait, but if part (a) is $330.89, and part (b) is $328.54, that would be option I.

But earlier, when I discounted the face value, the proceeds were $324.49, which isn't in the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on the discounted amount. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the draft is accepted, the maturity value is $330.89, but when it's discounted, the discount is on the face value, and the collection fee is on the discounted amount.

So discount on face value: 326.80 * 5.5% * 30/360 = 326.80 * 0.055 * 1/12 ≈ 1.4978.

So amount after discount: 326.80 - 1.4978 ≈ 325.3022.

Collection fee: 325.3022 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.813255.

Proceeds: 325.3022 - 0.813255 ≈ 324.4889.

But none of the options have this for part (b). So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the collection fee is applied on the face value, not the discounted amount. So fee is 0.25% of 326.80, which is 0.817.

So total deductions: discount 1.4978 + fee 0.817 ≈ 2.3148.

Proceeds: 326.80 - 2.3148 ≈ 324.4852.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the discount rate is 5.5% on the face value for 30 days, and the collection fee is on the face value. So:

Proceeds = 326.80 - (326.80 * 0.055 * 30/360) - (326.80 * 0.0025).

Compute each:

Discount: 326.80 * 0.055 * 30/360 = 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 1.4978.

Fee: 326.80 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.817.

Total deductions: 1.4978 + 0.817 ≈ 2.3148.

Proceeds: 326.80 - 2.3148 ≈ 324.4852.

Again, same result. No option has this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the draft is discounted at 5.5%, which includes both the discount and the collection fee. Or perhaps the 5.5% is the total discount rate, including the fee. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5% is the discount rate, and the 1/4% is an additional fee.

Wait, the problem says: "discounted at 5.5% 30 days before maturity and a 1/4% collection fee was charged."

So two separate deductions: 5.5% discount and 0.25% fee.

So the process is:

1. Compute discount on face value at 5.5% for 30 days: 326.80 * 0.055 * 30/360 = 326.80 * 0.00458333 ≈ 1.4978.

2. Subtract this discount: 326.80 - 1.4978 = 325.3022.

3. Compute collection fee on the discounted amount: 325.3022 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.813255.

4. Subtract fee: 325.3022 - 0.813255 ≈ 324.4889.

But again, no option matches. So maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated on the maturity value, not the face value. Let me try that.

Maturity value is 330.89.

Discount at 5.5% for 30 days: 330.89 * 0.055 * 30/360 = 330.89 * 0.00458333 ≈ 1.5168.

Proceeds after discount: 330.89 - 1.5168 ≈ 329.3732.

Collection fee: 329.3732 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.823433.

Proceeds after fee: 329.3732 - 0.823433 ≈ 328.5498 ≈ $328.55.

Looking at the options, part (a) is 330.89, part (b) is 328.54. So that's option I.

But I'm not entirely sure because I thought discounting is on the face value, but perhaps in this context, it's on the maturity value. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that part (a) is $326.80 was wrong, and it's actually $330.89.

Wait, let me go back to part (a). The question says, "How much was paid if Homes Bros paid it when due?" So Homes Bros is the acceptor, so when the draft is due, they pay the maturity value, which includes the interest. So part (a) is $330.89, not $326.80.

So part (a) is $330.89, part (b) is $328.54. So the correct option is I: $330.89, $328.54.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, when discounting the face value, I got $324.49, which isn't an option. But when discounting the maturity value, I got $328.55, which is close to option I's part (b) of $328.54.

So perhaps the correct approach is to discount the maturity value, not the face value. But I'm not entirely sure. However, given the options, option I seems to fit if part (a) is $330.89 and part (b) is $328.54.
</think>

The draft is accepted at 5%, so the maturity value is calculated as $326.80 plus interest for 90 days, resulting in $330.89 for part (a). For part (b), discounting the maturity value at 5.5% for 30 days and subtracting a 1/4% collection fee yields $328.54. 

Answer: I
