<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a factory's power factor correction using a synchronous capacitor. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on power factor stuff, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts: (a) original kilovars of lagging load, (b) kvar of correction needed, and (c) kVArating of the capacitor and its power factor. The options are given from A to J, so I need to figure out which option correctly answers all three parts.

First, let me understand the given data. The factory draws a lagging load of 2000 kW at a power factor (PF) of 0.6. The voltage is 6000 V. They want to raise the overall PF to unity using a synchronous capacitor, which has losses of 275 kW. 

Starting with part (a): Original kilovars of lagging load. I remember that kilovars (kVAr) relate to the reactive power in the load. The formula for reactive power (Q) is Q = S * sinθ, where S is the apparent power (kVA) and θ is the phase angle. Alternatively, since PF = P/S, then S = P / PF, and Q = S * sqrt(1 - PF²). 

Wait, let me make sure. Yes, the formula for reactive power can be calculated using P = S * cosθ, so S = P / cosθ. Then Q = S * sinθ, which is also S * sqrt(1 - cos²θ), which simplifies to P * tanθ, since tanθ = sinθ/cosθ.

So, for part (a), P is 2000 kW, PF is 0.6 (cosθ = 0.6). Let's compute the original kVAr (reactive power) of the load.

First, calculate the apparent power S: S = P / PF = 2000 / 0.6 ≈ 3333.33 kVA. Then, the reactive power Q is S * sinθ. Since cosθ = 0.6, sinθ would be sqrt(1 - 0.6²) = sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So Q = 3333.33 * 0.8 ≈ 2666.66 kVAr. Hmm, that's about 2667 kVAr. Looking at the options, I see option C has 2667 kVAr for part (a), and option J also has 2667. So part (a) is 2667 kVAr, which is likely option C or J.

Moving to part (b): kvar of correction needed to bring PF to unity. When the power factor is unity, the reactive power needed is zero. Wait, no. Wait, no. Actually, to correct the power factor from 0.6 lagging to unity, we need to add leading reactive power (a capacitor) to cancel out the lagging reactive power.

The original load has a lagging kVAr of 2667. At unity PF, the reactive power would be zero, so the correction needed is 2667 kVAr leading. But wait, the problem says the synchronous capacitor's losses are 275 kW. Hmm, that's an important point. So the capacitor itself has some losses, which would affect the total correction needed.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to account for the capacitor's losses. Let me think. The capacitor provides leading reactive power, but it also has some real power loss. So the actual reactive power it contributes is less than its nameplate rating because some of the power is lost as heat.

The formula for the capacitor's reactive power (Qc) would be Qc = Sc * sinθc, where Sc is the capacitor's apparent power (kVA), and θc is the angle for the capacitor's PF. But wait, the capacitor is a synchronous capacitor, which usually has a high power factor? Or maybe it's a motor running as a capacitor, which would have a power factor less than 1. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. A synchronous capacitor is used to correct power factor. It's a motor that's run as a capacitor, so it can supply leading reactive power. But it has some losses, so its actual reactive power contribution is less than its rating. So, the capacitor's real power loss is 275 kW. So, the capacitor's apparent power (Sc) is related to its real power and reactive power. Let me think.

The power factor of the capacitor (Pfc) would be its real power (losses) divided by its apparent power. So Pfc = 275 kW / Sc. But the capacitor's power factor is the cosine of its angle, so for a leading reactive power, Pfc would be cosφ, where φ is the phase angle. So, Sc = 275 / cosφ. But I'm not sure what φ is. Alternatively, the capacitor's reactive power is Sc * sinφ, and since it's a capacitor, it's providing leading power, so sinφ would be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the capacitor's power factor is given, but in the options, the power factors are 0.15, 0.1, 0.09, etc. Looking at the options, each option gives the power factor for the capacitor. For example, option A says 0.15, option B 0.1, etc. So maybe I can use that.

Wait, the problem says to compute the kVArating of the synchronous capacitor and its power factor. So perhaps part (c) is about finding Sc and Pfc. But for part (b), I need the correction needed, which is the reactive power the capacitor must provide, considering its losses.

Alternatively, perhaps the correction needed is the original lagging kVAr, which is 2667, but since the capacitor has losses, the actual reactive power it can contribute is less. So the capacitor's reactive power (Qc) must be equal to the original lagging kVAr (2667), but considering its losses.

Wait, no. Because the capacitor's losses (275 kW) are real power, not reactive. So the capacitor's total power is Sc = sqrt( (275)^2 + (Qc)^2 ). But the power factor of the capacitor is 275 / Sc. So Sc = 275 / cosφ, where φ is the capacitor's power factor angle. But I'm not sure if I'm approaching this correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is: The total power after correction should have PF = 1. So the original load is P = 2000 kW, Q = 2667 kVAr lagging. The capacitor provides Qc = Sc * sinθc, where θc is the angle of the capacitor's current, which is leading. The real power of the capacitor is Pcap = Sc * cosθc, which is the losses, 275 kW.

So, the system after correction must have zero net reactive power. So, the original load's Q is 2667 lagging, and the capacitor provides Qc leading. So 2667 - Qc = 0 → Qc = 2667 kVAr.

But the capacitor's real power is 275 kW, which is Sc * cosθc. So Sc = 275 / cosθc.

Also, Qc = Sc * sinθc = 2667.

So, Sc = 2667 / sinθc.

But Sc is also 275 / cosθc.

So, 2667 / sinθc = 275 / cosθc → 2667 = (275 * sinθc) / cosθc → 2667 = 275 * tanθc → tanθc = 2667 / 275 ≈ 9.7, so θc ≈ arctan(9.7) ≈ 84 degrees. Therefore, cosθc ≈ cos(84) ≈ 0.1045, so the power factor of the capacitor is about 0.1045, which is approximately 0.10 leading. So the power factor is around 0.10.

So, Sc = 275 / 0.1045 ≈ 2636 kVA. Hmm, but looking at the options, let's see which one has Sc around 2636 and power factor 0.10. Option B has 3000 kVA and 0.1, option I has 3100 kVA and 0.08, option C has 3300 and 0.09, etc.

Wait, but my calculation for Sc is 2636 kVA, but none of the options match that exactly. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the approach. Because the capacitor's losses are 275 kW, which is the real power it consumes. So the capacitor's apparent power (Sc) is the sum of its real power and reactive power. Since the capacitor provides leading reactive power, the reactive power Qc is Sc * sinθ, and the real power is Sc * cosθ. But since the capacitor is supplying leading reactive power, θ is negative, but the magnitude is what's important.

But in this case, the real power is 275 kW, which is the loss. So:

Sc = sqrt( (275)^2 + (Qc)^2 )

But we also know that after correction, the total reactive power must be zero. So the original load's reactive power is 2667 lagging, and the capacitor provides Qc leading, so 2667 - Qc = 0 → Qc = 2667.

So Sc = sqrt(275² + 2667²) ≈ sqrt(75625 + 7112289) ≈ sqrt(7187914) ≈ 2681 kVA. 

Wait, that's about 2681 kVA. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option J has a kVArating of 2755 kVA and power factor 0.103. Let's see: Sc = 2755.

So, Sc = 2755 kVA, then the real power is 2755 * cos(θc) = 275 kW. So cosθc = 275 / 2755 ≈ 0.10. So θc ≈ 84 degrees, as before. Then Qc = 2755 * sin(84) ≈ 2755 * 0.9945 ≈ 2740 kVAr. Wait, but we needed Qc to be 2667 to cancel the original load's 2667. So this would give a Qc of about 2740, which is a bit more than needed. So perhaps the calculation is approximate.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The required Qc is 2667 kVAr. The capacitor's real power is 275 kW. So Sc = sqrt(275² + 2667²) ≈ sqrt(75625 + 7112289) ≈ sqrt(7187914) ≈ 2681 kVA.

But in the options, none have exactly that. Let me look at option J: 2755 kVA. Let's compute Qc for that. Qc = Sc * sinθc, where θc is arccos(275/Sc) → arccos(275/2755) ≈ arccos(0.10) ≈ 84 degrees. So sin(84) ≈ 0.9945. So Qc = 2755 * 0.9945 ≈ 2740 kVAr. But we need 2667. So it's a bit higher than needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the capacitor's reactive power is just 2667, and the real power is 275. So the apparent power Sc is sqrt(275² + 2667²) ≈ 2681 kVA. So looking for Sc ≈ 2681 and power factor ≈ 275/2681 ≈ 0.1025, around 0.103. 

Looking at the options, option J has Sc = 2755 kVA and power factor 0.103. Let's compute the real power for Sc=2755 and Pfc=0.103: real power = 2755 * 0.103 ≈ 283.5 kW. But the given real power is 275, which is less than that. So perhaps option J is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Sc. Let me try another approach. The capacitor's real power (loss) is 275 kW. The reactive power it provides is Qc = 2667 kVAr. So the apparent power Sc is sqrt(275² + 2667²) ≈ 2681 kVA. The power factor Pfc is 275 / 2681 ≈ 0.1025, which is approximately 0.103. So Sc ≈ 2681 kVA with Pfc ≈ 0.103.

Looking at the options, option J is 2755 kVA and 0.103. Hmm, but 2755 is higher than 2681. Maybe the options are approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the capacitor's reactive power is 2667, and with losses, the Sc is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the capacitor's reactive power is its rating, and the losses are 275. So Qc = Sc * sinθc, and 275 = Sc * cosθc. So Sc = 275 / cosθc, and Qc = Sc * sinθc = (275 / cosθc) * sinθc = 275 * tanθc. We need Qc = 2667, so 275 * tanθc = 2667 → tanθc = 2667 / 275 ≈ 9.7 → θc ≈ 84 degrees. So cosθc ≈ 0.1045, so Sc = 275 / 0.1045 ≈ 2636 kVA. 

But none of the options match exactly. Option J is 2755 kVA and 0.103. Let's compute cosθc for Sc=2755: cosθc = 275 / 2755 ≈ 0.10. So θc ≈ 84 degrees, as before. Then Qc = 2755 * sin(84) ≈ 2755 * 0.9945 ≈ 2740, which is more than needed. So perhaps the correct Sc is 2681, but that's not in the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider part (c) first. Part (c) asks for the kVArating of the capacitor and its power factor. So the kVArating is Sc, and the power factor is Pfc = 275 / Sc.

From part (b), we determined that the required Qc is 2667. So Sc must be such that Sc * sinθc = 2667, and Sc * cosθc = 275. So, Sc^2 = (275)^2 + (2667)^2 ≈ 2681^2. So Sc is approximately 2681 kVA.

Looking at the options, option J has Sc=2755 and Pfc=0.103. Let's compute Pfc for Sc=2681: Pfc=275/2681≈0.1025, which is close to 0.103. So option J would have Sc≈2755, which is a bit higher than 2681. But perhaps the options are rounded, or I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact calculations.

Compute Sc:

Sc = sqrt(275^2 + 2667^2) 

275^2 = 75625

2667^2 = (2667)^2 = let's compute:

2667 * 2667:

= (2600 + 67)^2 = 2600^2 + 2*2600*67 + 67^2

= 6,760,000 + 2*2600*67 + 4,489

2600*67 = 174,200 → 2* that is 348,400

So total: 6,760,000 + 348,400 = 7,108,400 + 4,489 = 7,112,889.

So Sc = sqrt(75,625 + 7,112,889) = sqrt(7,188,514) ≈ 2681.14 kVA.

So Sc ≈ 2681 kVA.

The power factor Pfc = 275 / 2681 ≈ 0.1025, or 0.103.

Looking at the options:

Option J: 2667 kVAr (part a), 2755 kVA (Sc), 0.103 Pfc.

Wait, but option J's part (a) is 2667, which matches our calculation for part (a). Part (c) is Sc=2755 and Pfc=0.103. But according to our calculation, Sc should be about 2681, not 2755. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding part (b). Part (b) is the kvar of correction needed, which is the reactive power the capacitor must provide, which is 2667 kVAr. But the capacitor's losses are 275 kW, so the actual reactive power it can contribute is less than its nameplate rating because some power is lost as heat.

Wait, no. The capacitor's nameplate rating is its apparent power (kVA), which is the sum of its real power (losses) and reactive power. So the nameplate kVA is Sc = 275 / cosθc, where θc is the capacitor's power factor angle. The reactive power it provides is Sc * sinθc.

So to get Qc = 2667, we set Sc * sinθc = 2667, and Sc * cosθc = 275. So, dividing the two equations:

sinθc / cosθc = 2667 / 275 → tanθc = 9.7 → θc ≈ 84 degrees, as before.

So Sc = 275 / cos(84) ≈ 275 / 0.1045 ≈ 2636 kVA.

So Sc ≈ 2636 kVA, and Pfc = cos(84) ≈ 0.1045, which is approximately 0.10 leading.

Looking at the options, option B has Sc=3000 kVA and Pfc=0.1. Let's compute Qc for Sc=3000 and Pfc=0.1:

Qc = 3000 * sin(arccos(0.1)) = 3000 * sqrt(1 - 0.01) = 3000 * 0.99499 ≈ 2985 kVAr. But we need 2667, so this is too high.

Option I: Sc=3100, Pfc=0.08.

Qc = 3100 * sin(arccos(0.08)) ≈ 3100 * sqrt(1 - 0.0064) ≈ 3100 * 0.9968 ≈ 3089. So too high.

Option C: Sc=3300, Pfc=0.09.

Qc=3300 * sin(arccos(0.09)) ≈ 3300 * sqrt(1 - 0.0081) ≈ 3300 * 0.996 ≈ 3287. Also too high.

Option J: Sc=2755, Pfc=0.103.

Qc=2755 * sin(arccos(0.103)) ≈ 2755 * sqrt(1 - 0.0106) ≈ 2755 * 0.9947 ≈ 2740. Still higher than needed.

Option A: Sc=2200, Pfc=0.15.

Qc=2200 * sin(arccos(0.15)) ≈ 2200 * 0.988 ≈ 2174. Not enough.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match. But the closest is option J, where Sc=2755 and Pfc=0.103, which gives Qc≈2740, which is close to the needed 2667. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check option C: part (a) is 2667, part (c) Sc=3300, Pfc=0.09.

So, Sc=3300, Pfc=0.09 → real power=3300 * 0.09=297 kW. But the given real power is 275, so this is higher than needed. Therefore, option C's Sc is higher than needed, leading to higher Qc than needed.

Option J's Sc=2755, real power=2755*0.103≈283.5 kW, which is a bit higher than the given 275, but closer than option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the capacitor's losses are 275 kW, so the real power is fixed, and the reactive power is what we need to adjust to reach 2667.

So Sc = sqrt(275^2 + 2667^2) ≈ 2681 kVA. So the kVArating is approximately 2681, and the power factor is 275/2681≈0.1025, which is 0.103. So part (c) would be Sc≈2681, Pfc≈0.103. But none of the options have exactly that.

Looking at the options again, option J has Sc=2755 and Pfc=0.103. So Sc=2755, Pfc=0.103, which would give Qc=2755 * sin(84)≈2740. So the required correction is 2667, but the capacitor provides 2740, which is slightly more. Maybe the problem allows for rounding, so option J is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation for part (b) is simply the original lagging kVAr, which is 2667, so part (b) is 2667 kVAr. But looking at the options, option J's part (b) is 2667, but part (c) is 2755 and 0.103. So that might fit.

Wait, let me make a table:

Option J:
(a) 2667 kVAr → correct.
(b) 2667 kVAr → correct.
(c) Sc=2755 kVA, Pfc=0.103 → which gives Qc≈2740, which is a bit higher than needed.

But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the capacitor's losses when calculating the correction needed, which would make part (b) simply 2667 kVAr. But that doesn't account for the losses. Alternatively, perhaps the losses are ignored for part (b), and the full 2667 is the correction needed, with the capacitor's rating being higher.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- Part (a): 2667 kVAr → options C and J.

- Part (b): 2667 kVAr → options C and J.

- Part (c): Sc≈2681 kVA, Pfc≈0.103 → closest is option J: Sc=2755, Pfc=0.103.

So option J would have part (a)=2667, part (b)=2667, part (c)=2755 and 0.103.

But looking back at the question, part (c) asks for the kVArating of the synchronous capacitor and its power factor. So Sc is the kVArating, which is 2755, and Pfc=0.103.

Therefore, the correct option is J.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the original kilovars of a lagging load, the kvar of correction needed to bring the power factor to unity, and the kVArating of a synchronous capacitor along with its power factor. The factory draws a lagging load of 2000 kW at a power factor of 0.6 from a 6000 V mains. A synchronous capacitor with losses of 275 kW is used to correct the power factor to unity.

### Part (a): Original kVAr of Lagging Load
The apparent power \( S \) is calculated as:
\[
S = \frac{P}{\cos\phi} = \frac{2000}{0.6} \approx 3333.33 \, \text{kVA}
\]
The reactive power \( Q \) is:
\[
Q = S \cdot \sin\phi = 3333.33 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.6^2} = 3333.33 \cdot 0.8 \approx 2667 \, \text{kVAr}
\]
Thus, the original lagging load is **2667 kVAr**.

---

### Part (b): kVAr of Correction Needed
To bring the power factor to unity, the reactive power must be corrected to zero. The correction needed is equal to the original lagging reactive power, which is **2667 kVAr**.

---

### Part (c): kVArating of Synchronous Capacitor and Its Power Factor
The synchronous capacitor must provide a reactive power of 2667 kVAr while consuming 275 kW of real power (losses). The apparent power \( S_c \) of the capacitor is:
\[
S_c = \sqrt{P_c^2 + Q_c^2} = \sqrt{275^2 + 2667^2} \approx \sqrt{75625 + 7112289} \approx 2681 \, \text{kVA}
\]
The power factor \( \cos\phi_c \) is:
\[
\cos\phi_c = \frac{P_c}{S_c} = \frac{275}{2681} \approx 0.103
\]
Thus, the kVArating of the capacitor is approximately **2681 kVA** with a power factor of **0.103**. However, the closest option provided is **2755 kVA** and **0.103**, which slightly overestimates the reactive power but aligns with the given choices.

---

### Conclusion
The correct option is **J**, as it matches the calculated values for parts (a) and (b) and closely approximates the values for part (c).

**Answer: J**
