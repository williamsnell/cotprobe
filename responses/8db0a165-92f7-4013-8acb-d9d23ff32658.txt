Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the characteristic roots of an MA process. I'm a bit rusty on my time series analysis, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The process given is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. Wait, actually, I think I need to check that again. MA processes are moving average models, right? The general form is y_t = θ_0 u_t + θ_1 u_{t-1} + ... + θ_q u_{t-q}.

Hmm, looking at the equation, y_t equals a combination of u terms. Let me write it out clearly:

y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, that's y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}. Oh wait, is it? Because the way it's written is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. So, yeah, that's correct. So the coefficients are θ_0=1 (for u_t), θ_1=-3 (for u_{t-1}), and θ_2=1 (for u_{t-2}). So it's an MA(2) process.

But wait, the question is about the characteristic roots of the MA process. I remember that for MA processes, the characteristic roots are found by setting the characteristic equation equal to zero. The characteristic equation for an MA(q) model is 1 - θ_1 z - θ_2 z^2 - ... - θ_q z^q = 0.

So for this MA(2) process, the equation would be 1 - (-3)z - (1)z^2 = 0. Wait, no. Wait, the standard form is 1 + θ_1 z + θ_2 z^2 + ... + θ_q z^q = 0. Because for MA(q), the model is y_t = θ_0 u_t + θ_1 u_{t-1} + ... + θ_q u_{t-q}, and θ_0 is often 1 in some conventions. But in this case, the equation is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, so θ_0 is 1, θ_1 is -3, θ_2 is 1.

So the characteristic equation would be 1 + θ_1 z + θ_2 z^2 = 0. Plugging in the values, it's 1 + (-3)z + (1)z^2 = 0. Simplifying that: z² -3z +1 = 0.

Wait, let me make sure. The characteristic equation for MA(q) is 1 + θ_1 z + θ_2 z^2 + ... + θ_q z^q = 0. So for our case, q=2, so 1 + (-3)z + (1)z² = 0. So the equation is z² -3z +1=0. Hmm, solving this quadratic equation.

The quadratic formula is z = [3 ± sqrt(9 - 4*1*1)] / 2. So sqrt(9-4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. So z ≈ [3 ± 2.236]/2. That gives two roots:

z1 = (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 5.236/2 ≈ 2.618

z2 = (3 - 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.764/2 ≈ 0.382

Wait, but the options don't include these numbers. Let me check the options again.

Options are A through J. Let me look at them:

A: 1 and 0.5

B: 2 and 0.5

C: -1 and -0.5

D: -1 and 2

E: 3 and -2

F: 1 and 2

G: 1 and -3

H: -3 and -0.5

I: 1 and -2

J: 2 and -0.5

Wait, none of these options have 2.618 or 0.382. Did I make a mistake in setting up the equation?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the signs. Let me double-check the characteristic equation for MA processes. Another source says that for an MA(q) model, the characteristic equation is 1 + θ_1 z + θ_2 z² + ... + θ_q z^q = 0. So in our case, θ_1 is -3, θ_2 is 1. So the equation is 1 + (-3)z + (1)z² = 0. Which is correct as before.

Alternatively, sometimes the characteristic equation is written as θ(z) = 0, where θ(z) = 1 + θ_1 z + θ_2 z². So that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the AR characteristic roots instead? No, the question specifically says MA process. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the AR representation. Because sometimes MA processes can be inverted into AR forms, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the characteristic roots are the inverses of the roots of the MA polynomial. Because in some contexts, for invertibility, the roots of the MA polynomial should be outside the unit circle. So if the roots I found are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, then one is inside the unit circle (0.382 <1) and the other is outside (2.618>1). So the MA process would not be invertible because one root is inside. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, but the question is just about the characteristic roots, not about invertibility. So perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, but the options don't include the roots I found. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me re-express the model.

The model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as y_t = u_t + (-3)u_{t-1} + (1)u_{t-2}.

So the coefficients are θ_0=1, θ_1=-3, θ_2=1.

So the characteristic equation is 1 + θ_1 z + θ_2 z² = 0 → 1 -3z + z² = 0. So z² -3z +1=0.

So the roots are [3 ± sqrt(9-4)]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2 ≈ (3±2.236)/2, as before.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the model is written as y_t = u_t + (-3)u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the AR characteristic roots, but that's for the AR part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the AR polynomial instead. But no, the question is about the MA process's characteristic roots.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is referring to the roots of the denominator polynomial if we write the MA process as Y(z) = θ(z)U(z), where θ(z) = 1 -3z + z². So the roots are the solutions to θ(z)=0, which is z² -3z +1=0, as before.

But again, the roots I calculated don't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, perhaps the model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which would imply θ(z) = 1 -3z + z².

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are pairs of roots. The roots I have are approximately 2.618 and 0.382. None of the options have numbers close to these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the characteristic equation is written as z² -3z +1=0, but perhaps I should factor it differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a sign error.

Wait, let me try solving the equation again. The equation is z² -3z +1=0. Using the quadratic formula: z = [3 ± sqrt(9 -4)]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2. So approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the inverse roots. Because sometimes the roots of the MA polynomial are the reciprocals of the roots of the AR polynomial. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the denominator when writing the generating function. The generating function for y_t is Y(z) = θ(z)U(z), where θ(z) = 1 -3z + z². So the roots of θ(z)=0 are the characteristic roots. So again, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and it's asking about the AR roots instead. Let me think. If the model were AR, then the characteristic equation would be different. But the question says MA.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is written in a different form. Let me check the original equation again: y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. So that's u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as y_t = u_t + (-3)u_{t-1} + (1)u_{t-2}, which is correct. So the coefficients are θ0=1, θ1=-3, θ2=1.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the roots of the MA polynomial, which are the solutions to 1 -3z + z²=0, which are the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the roots are reciprocal? Because sometimes in time series, the roots of the MA polynomial are reciprocals of the AR roots. But that's in the context of invertibility and ARMA models. Here, it's just MA.

Alternatively, maybe I should write the equation as z² -3z +1=0 and see if any of the options match when considering possible sign errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me re-express the model.

The model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

So the characteristic equation is 1 -3z + z² = 0. So z² -3z +1=0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as 1 + (-3)z + z² =0, which is the same.

Wait, perhaps the roots are 2 and 0.5, which are options B and J. Let me check what 2 and 0.5 would imply.

If the roots are 2 and 0.5, then the characteristic equation would be (z -2)(z -0.5)=z² -2.5z +1=0. But our equation is z² -3z +1=0, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots are 1 and 2, option F. Then the equation would be (z-1)(z-2)=z²-3z+2=0. But our equation is z²-3z+1=0, so that's different.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check the model again.

The model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

So the coefficients are θ0=1, θ1=-3, θ2=1. So the characteristic equation is 1 -3z + z²=0.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as z² -3z +1=0. Let me compute the roots again.

z = [3 ± sqrt(9 -4)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)] /2 ≈ (3 ± 2.236)/2.

So z1 ≈ (3+2.236)/2 ≈ 5.236/2 ≈ 2.618.

z2 ≈ (3-2.236)/2 ≈ 0.764/2 ≈ 0.382.

Hmm, these don't match any of the options. So perhaps the question is about the AR characteristic roots instead, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the model is written in terms of lag operators. Let me write it using lag operators.

The model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Using lag operators, this can be written as y_t = (1 - 3L + L²)u_t.

So the polynomial is θ(z) = 1 -3z + z².

The characteristic equation is θ(z)=0 → z² -3z +1=0.

Same as before. So the roots are as calculated.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check the model again.

Wait, the model is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. So that's the same as u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as y_t = u_t + (-3)u_{t-1} + (1)u_{t-2}, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the AR characteristic roots, but I thought it was MA. Let me think. The MA process's characteristic roots are the roots of the denominator when expressed as a generating function. Wait, no, the denominator is 1, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the roots of the inverse polynomial. Because sometimes the roots of the MA polynomial are the reciprocals of the roots of the AR polynomial. But in this case, since it's an MA process, perhaps the roots are considered as is.

Wait, perhaps I should look for options where the product of the roots is 1, because in a quadratic equation ax² +bx +c=0, the product is c/a. In our case, it's 1/1=1. So the product of the roots should be 1.

Looking at the options:

A: 1 and 0.5 → product 0.5 → no.

B: 2 and 0.5 → product 1 → yes.

C: -1 and -0.5 → product 0.5 → no.

D: -1 and 2 → product -2 → no.

E: 3 and -2 → product -6 → no.

F: 1 and 2 → product 2 → no.

G: 1 and -3 → product -3 → no.

H: -3 and -0.5 → product 1.5 → no.

I: 1 and -2 → product -2 → no.

J: 2 and -0.5 → product -1 → no.

So only option B has a product of 1. So that's a clue. So perhaps the correct answer is B: 2 and 0.5.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the roots as approximately 2.618 and 0.382, which multiply to 1 (since 2.618 *0.382≈1). So the product is 1, which matches option B.

So perhaps the correct answer is B: 2 and 0.5.

Wait, but my calculated roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, which are not exactly 2 and 0.5. So why is option B correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me re-express the model again.

The model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

So the characteristic equation is 1 -3z + z²=0 → z² -3z +1=0.

Wait, perhaps I should factor this equation differently. Let me try to factor z²-3z+1.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 1 and add to -3. Hmm, not possible, so the roots are as calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the inverse roots. Because sometimes the roots of the MA polynomial are the reciprocals of the roots of the AR polynomial. But in this case, since it's an MA process, perhaps the roots are considered as is.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the model is written as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be rearranged as y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}.

So the coefficients are θ0=1, θ1=0 (since u_{t-1} has coefficient -3, but wait, no, θ1 is for u_{t-1}, which is -3, and θ2 is for u_{t-2}, which is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the signs. Let me write the characteristic equation again: 1 + θ1 z + θ2 z² =0 → 1 + (-3)z +1 z²=0 → z²-3z+1=0.

So the roots are [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

But none of the options have these. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which is the same as y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, perhaps the characteristic equation is written as 1 + θ1 z + θ2 z² =0, which is correct.

So the equation is z² -3z +1=0.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the options have roots that satisfy this equation.

Let me test option B: roots 2 and 0.5.

Plug z=2 into the equation: 2² -3*2 +1=4-6+1=-1≠0.

z=0.5: (0.5)^2 -3*(0.5)+1=0.25-1.5+1= -0.25≠0.

So option B is not correct.

Option J: roots 2 and -0.5.

z=2: 4 -6 +1= -1≠0.

z=-0.5: 0.25 +1.5 +1=2.75≠0.

Nope.

Option I: 1 and -2.

z=1: 1-3+1= -1≠0.

z=-2:4 +6 +1=11≠0.

No.

Option F:1 and 2.

z=1:1-3+1=-1≠0.

z=2:4-6+1=-1≠0.

No.

Option H:-3 and -0.5.

z=-3:9 +9 +1=19≠0.

z=-0.5:0.25 +1.5 +1=2.75≠0.

No.

Option C:-1 and -0.5.

z=-1:1 +3 +1=5≠0.

z=-0.5:0.25 +1.5 +1=2.75≠0.

No.

Option D:-1 and 2.

z=-1:1 +3 +1=5≠0.

z=2:4-6+1=-1≠0.

No.

Option E:3 and -2.

z=3:9-9+1=1≠0.

z=-2:4+6+1=11≠0.

No.

Option A:1 and 0.5.

z=1:1-3+1=-1≠0.

z=0.5:0.25 -1.5 +1= -0.25≠0.

No.

Option G:1 and -3.

z=1:1-3+1=-1≠0.

z=-3:9 +9 +1=19≠0.

No.

Option J:2 and -0.5.

As before, doesn't work.

Wait, so none of the options satisfy the equation z²-3z+1=0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the model is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which is the same as y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the characteristic equation is written as 1 + θ1 z^{-1} + θ2 z^{-2} =0, which would change things. Let me think.

If the characteristic equation is 1 + θ1 z^{-1} + θ2 z^{-2}=0, then multiplying both sides by z² gives z² + θ1 z + θ2 =0.

In our case, θ1=-3, θ2=1. So the equation becomes z² + (-3)z +1=0 → z² -3z +1=0, same as before.

So the roots are the same.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe the question is about the AR characteristic roots instead. Let me think about that.

If the model were AR, say, an AR(2) model, then the characteristic equation would be 1 - φ1 z + φ2 z²=0. But the given model is MA.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is expressed as an AR process. Let me try inverting the MA process.

The given MA(2) process is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

To invert it into an AR form, we can write:

y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Let me try to write u_t in terms of y's.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the AR characteristic roots, but I think the question is clear that it's about the MA process.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the roots of the denominator when expressing the MA process as a generating function. The generating function Y(z) = θ(z)U(z), where θ(z)=1 -3z +z². So the roots of θ(z)=0 are the characteristic roots, which are the same as before.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me check the original equation again.

The process is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t.

So that's y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}.

So θ0=1, θ1=-3, θ2=1.

So the characteristic equation is 1 -3z +z²=0.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the AR characteristic roots, and the model is being treated as an AR process. Let me think.

If I were to write this as an AR process, I'd need to express y_t in terms of its own lags. But that's not straightforward here because it's an MA process. Alternatively, perhaps the model can be rewritten as an AR process by inverting the MA polynomial, but that's only possible if the MA polynomial is invertible, which requires all roots of θ(z)=0 to be outside the unit circle. In our case, one root is inside (≈0.382) and the other is outside (≈2.618), so it's not invertible. Thus, it can't be expressed as a finite-order AR process.

So, perhaps the question is indeed about the MA characteristic roots, which are 2.618 and 0.382, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the model is written as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be rearranged as y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}.

So the coefficients are θ0=1, θ1=0 (since there's no u_{t-1} term except for the -3), wait no, θ1 is the coefficient for u_{t-1}, which is -3, and θ2 is the coefficient for u_{t-2}, which is 1.

Wait, perhaps I should write the characteristic equation as 1 + θ1 z + θ2 z² =0, which would be 1 + (-3)z +1 z²=0 → z² -3z +1=0.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the roots of the inverse polynomial, which would be 1 -3z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0. Multiplying both sides by z² gives z² -3z +1=0, same as before.

So, I'm stuck. All my calculations point to roots approximately 2.618 and 0.382, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps the model is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which is the same as y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the characteristic equation is 1 + θ1 z^{-1} + θ2 z^{-2}=0. So for θ1=-3, θ2=1, the equation becomes 1 -3z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0.

Multiplying both sides by z² gives z² -3z +1=0, same as before.

So, the roots are still the same.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the modulus of the roots, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the AR roots, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the characteristic roots are the reciprocals of the roots I found. So 1/2.618 ≈0.382 and 1/0.382≈2.618. But that doesn't help because the options don't have these.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's referring to the AR roots of an ARMA model. But the question says MA process, not ARMA.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the option where the product of the roots is 1, which is option B:2 and 0.5. Because in a quadratic equation, the product is c/a, which in our case is 1, so the product must be 1. So option B is the only one with product 1. So perhaps the answer is B.

But earlier, when I tested z=2 and z=0.5 in the equation z²-3z+1=0, they didn't satisfy it. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question or in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is correct, and the characteristic equation is z²-3z+1=0, which has roots ≈2.618 and ≈0.382. But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the model as y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}, which is correct. So the characteristic equation is 1 + (-3)z +1 z²=0 → z² -3z +1=0.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the characteristic roots are the solutions to the equation when written as θ(z)=0, which is 1 -3z +z²=0. So the roots are [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented differently. Let me see:

Option J: 2 and -0.5.

Wait, if one root is 2, then plugging into the equation: 2² -3*2 +1=4-6+1=-1≠0.

So no.

Option B:2 and 0.5.

z=2:4-6+1=-1≠0.

z=0.5:0.25-1.5+1=-0.25≠0.

No.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the question is about the AR characteristic roots, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the model is written as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be rearranged as y_t - u_t +3u_{t-1} -u_{t-2}=0.

So the characteristic equation would be 1 - z +3z² -z³=0? Wait, no, that's for an AR(3) model. But this is an MA(2) model.

I think I'm going in circles here. Given that none of the options match the calculated roots, but option B has the correct product (1), perhaps the intended answer is B:2 and 0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model setup. Let me try one more time.

The model is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t.

So, in terms of lags, this is y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}.

So, the coefficients are θ0=1, θ1=-3, θ2=1.

So, the characteristic equation is 1 -3z + z²=0 → z² -3z +1=0.

Solutions are (3 ±√5)/2 ≈2.618 and 0.382.

No matching options. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model's coefficients.

Wait, perhaps the model is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be written as y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}.

So, the coefficients are θ0=1, θ1=-3, θ2=1.

So, the characteristic equation is 1 -3z +z²=0.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as z² -3z +1=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the characteristic equation is written as 1 + θ1 z^{-1} + θ2 z^{-2}=0, which would be 1 -3z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0.

Multiplying both sides by z²: z² -3z +1=0.

Same as before.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is B:2 and 0.5, even though it doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the model is written differently. Let me try to see if any of the options' roots satisfy the equation.

Let's try option J:2 and -0.5.

Plug z=2 into z²-3z+1: 4-6+1=-1≠0.

z=-0.5: 0.25 +1.5 +1=2.75≠0.

No.

Option B:2 and 0.5.

z=2:4-6+1=-1≠0.

z=0.5:0.25-1.5+1=-0.25≠0.

No.

Option I:1 and -2.

z=1:1-3+1=-1≠0.

z=-2:4+6+1=11≠0.

No.

Option H:-3 and -0.5.

z=-3:9+9+1=19≠0.

z=-0.5:0.25+1.5+1=2.75≠0.

No.

Option D:-1 and 2.

z=-1:1+3+1=5≠0.

z=2:4-6+1=-1≠0.

No.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model setup.

Wait, perhaps the model is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be written as y_t = u_t + u_{t-2} -3u_{t-1}.

So the coefficients are θ0=1, θ1=-3, θ2=1.

Thus, the characteristic equation is 1 -3z +z²=0.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the characteristic equation is written as z² -3z +1=0, which is correct.

I think I have to conclude that none of the options match, but perhaps the intended answer is B:2 and 0.5, as their product is 1, which matches the requirement for the product of roots in a quadratic equation with leading coefficient 1 and constant term 1.

So, despite the roots not matching exactly, I'll go with option B:2 and 0.5.

The characteristic roots of the given MA process are found by solving the characteristic equation derived from the model:

\[
y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}
\]

The characteristic equation for an MA(2) process is:

\[
1 - 3z + z^2 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
z = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

The roots are approximately \( z_1 \approx 2.618 \) and \( z_2 \approx 0.382 \). However, none of the provided options match these values exactly. 

Among the options, only **B (2 and 0.5)** has a product of 1, which aligns with the requirement for the product of the roots in a quadratic equation of the form \( z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0 \). Despite the calculated roots not matching exactly, the reasoning suggests that the intended answer is likely **B**.

**Answer: B**
