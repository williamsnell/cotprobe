Question:

The stomach lining contains several types of cells. Which statement about them is correct?


Options:

A: Parietal cells secrete pepsinogen, the inactive precursor of pepsin
B: G cells secrete the enzyme amylase
C: Chief cells the hormone gastrin (which stimulates acid secretion).
D: Mucous cells secrete the hormone secretin
E: Enterochromaffin-like cells secrete the enzyme lipase
F: Parietal cells secrete the hormone ghrelin
G: Mucous cells secrete the glycoprotein mucin
H: Chief cells secrete bile acid
I: D cells secrete the hormone cholecystokinin

Okay, so I have this question about the stomach lining cells and what each type does. Let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my digestive system, but I'll try to remember.

The question is asking which statement about the stomach lining cells is correct. The options are A to I. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Parietal cells secrete pepsinogen, the inactive precursor of pepsin. Hmm, I remember that parietal cells are involved in acid production. Pepsinogen is the precursor, right, and it's activated by the acid. Oh wait, no, isn't pepsinogen actually secreted by the chief cells? Because I think parietal cells make hydrochloric acid. So A might be wrong.

Option B: G cells secrete the enzyme amylase. G cells are the ones that release gastrin, which is a hormone that stimulates acid secretion. Amylase is an enzyme, and I'm pretty sure amylase is produced by the pancreas, not the stomach. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Chief cells secrete the hormone gastrin. No, wait. Chief cells produce pepsinogen and maybe some other enzymes. Gastrin is actually released by the G cells, not the chief cells. So C is wrong.

Option D: Mucous cells secrete the hormone secretin. I think secretin is a hormone released from the small intestine, particularly from the S cells, in response to acid. Mucous cells in the stomach probably produce mucus to protect the lining, not hormones. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Enterochromaffin-like cells secrete the enzyme lipase. I'm a bit confused here. Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells are in the stomach and they're involved in acid regulation. I think they secrete histamine, which stimulates acid release. Lipase is an enzyme, and I believe lipase is made by the pancreas. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Parietal cells secrete the hormone ghrelin. Wait, ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite. I think it's produced in the stomach, but I'm not sure. Do parietal cells make it? Or is it another type of cell? I'm a bit unsure on this one. Maybe I should come back to F.

Option G: Mucous cells secrete the glycoprotein mucin. That sounds right. Mucous cells, as their name suggests, produce mucus. Mucin is a component of mucus, so G should be correct. Let me keep this in mind.

Option H: Chief cells secrete bile acid. Bile acids are produced in the liver, not the stomach. So H is incorrect.

Option I: D cells secrete the hormone cholecystokinin. D cells are found in the pancreas, I think, and they release somatostatin. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released by the I cells in the small intestine. So I is wrong.

So, going back to the options, the correct statements seem to be G. Let me double-check the others to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Parietal cells: They produce HCl and also intrinsic factor. So they don't make pepsinogen (that's the chief cells), so A is wrong. For F, I'm not sure about ghrelin. I thought it's the stomach that makes ghrelin, but which cells? Maybe it's the ECL cells or another type. But if parietal cells don't make it, then F is wrong. So the only correct statement is G.

The correct statement is that mucous cells secrete the glycoprotein mucin.

Answer: G
