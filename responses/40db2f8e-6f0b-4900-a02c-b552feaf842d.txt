Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically dealing with homomorphisms. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question presents two statements and asks whether each is true or not, then selects from the given options A to J. Let me break it down.

**Statement 1:** A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.

Hmm, I remember that the kernel of a group homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity element in the codomain. So, kernel is a subgroup of the domain. Now, can the kernel be empty? 

Wait, the kernel must contain at least the identity element, right? Because for any group homomorphism f: G → H, f(e_G) must be e_H. So the kernel includes e_G at least. That means the kernel can't be empty because it must contain at least one element—the identity. So Statement 1 is saying it's possible for a homomorphism to have an empty kernel, which contradicts what I just thought. So Statement 1 is **False**.

**Statement 2:** It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.

Wait, nontrivial homomorphism here probably means a homomorphism that isn't just the trivial map sending everything to the identity. So, can a finite group have a nontrivial homomorphism into an infinite group?

I think about examples. Let's say G is a finite cyclic group, like Z_n, and H is an infinite group, say Z (integers under addition). Then, the map f: Z_n → Z defined by f(k) = k*m for some fixed m. Wait, but Z has no torsion, so any element of finite order in Z must be zero. So, for cyclic groups, if G is finite, and H is infinite abelian, the homomorphism must send the generator of G to an element of H whose order divides the order of G. But in H, which is infinite, you can have elements of any order, but for H to have such elements, H must have a subgroup isomorphic to G.

Wait, but for example, the trivial homomorphism is when everything maps to zero. But if G is finite, can there be a nontrivial homomorphism into H? Like, if H is the infinite cyclic group Z, then any homomorphism from G to Z must send the generator of G to an integer m, such that m * n = 0 (where n is the order of G). But since n is finite, m must be zero, because in Z, the only element with finite order is zero. So in this case, the only homomorphism is trivial. So for G=Z_n and H=Z, the only homomorphism is trivial. 

But wait, what if H is an infinite group that has elements of finite order? For example, consider H as the infinite direct product of cyclic groups, or something like that. Suppose G is Z_2, and H is an infinite group that has an element of order 2. Then, the homomorphism f: Z_2 → H sending 1 to that element would be nontrivial. So in this case, it is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group into an infinite group. 

So Statement 2 claims it's not possible, but I just found a case where it is possible. Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question says "It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group." So the statement is saying that for every finite group and some infinite group, there's no nontrivial homomorphism. But I just found a case where it's possible, so Statement 2 is actually false. So Statement 2 is **False**.

Therefore, both statements are false. So looking at the options, which option says both statements are false?

Looking at the options:

A: Statement 1 true, 2 not given.
B: Both true, contradict.
C: Both not given.
D: False, True.
E: 1 not given, 2 true.
F: 1 false, 2 not given.
G: False, False.
H: True, True.
I: True, False.
J: 1 not given, 2 false.

So, since both statements are false, the correct option is G: False, False.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in Statement 1? Because I thought Statement 1 was saying that a homomorphism may have an empty kernel, which I concluded was false because the kernel must contain at least the identity, so the kernel can't be empty. So Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: It's not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from some finite group into some infinite group. I concluded that this is false because I can construct such a homomorphism. So Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. Therefore, the answer should be G: False, False.

Wait, but looking back, I'm a bit uncertain about Statement 2. Let me think again. The question says "It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group." So the negation is that there exists at least one finite group and one infinite group where a nontrivial homomorphism exists. So if such a case exists, Statement 2 is false.

Yes, as I thought earlier, if G=Z_2 and H is an infinite group with an element of order 2, then the homomorphism sending 1 to that element is nontrivial. So Statement 2 is indeed false.

So both statements are false. So the correct option is G: False, False.
</think>

The kernel of a group homomorphism must contain at least the identity element, so it cannot be empty. Therefore, Statement 1 is false. For Statement 2, it is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group into an infinite group if the infinite group contains elements of finite order. Thus, Statement 2 is also false.
