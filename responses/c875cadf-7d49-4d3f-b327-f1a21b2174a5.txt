Question:

A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly "panicky." She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Recommend a diet change
B: Suggest a neurological examination
C: Recommend behavioral therapy
D: Review the patient's sexual history
E: Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem
F: Recommend a urinary incontinence medication
G: Recommend a physical therapy
H: Advise the patient to stop taking oral contraceptives
I: Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best next step for this patient. Let's break down the information given. The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a 3-year history of increased urination frequency and occasional incontinence. The symptoms start a few days before she flies and stop once she arrives at her destination. She's anxious about flying and feels panicky. She had milder symptoms before exams. Her medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and she only takes oral contraceptives. Vital signs are normal, and physical exams, urinalysis, and culture are all normal.

Hmm, so the symptoms are stress-related. She gets them before flying, which she's anxious about, and before exams, which are also stressful. The symptoms come on with stress and go away once she's in a less stressful environment. That makes me think of stress-induced incontinence or maybe a functional or psychological cause.

Since all the tests are normal, it's unlikely a UTI or structural issue. So maybe it's related to anxiety. Stress can cause increased urinary frequency and even incontinence. She feels panicky, which is a sign of anxiety. The symptoms correlate with stressful situations like flying and exams.

So the options are A to I. Let's look at them:

A: Recommend a diet change. I don't see any dietary issues mentioned, so maybe not the first step.

B: Neurological exam. No signs pointing to neurological issues, and tests were normal.

C: Behavioral therapy. That could help with anxiety and stress management.

D: Review sexual history. Doesn't seem relevant here.

E: Avoid stressful activities. She can't really avoid flying or exams, so this might not be practical.

F: Urinary med. Since it's stress-related, maybe not the first choice, unless there's a physical cause, which seems unlikely.

G: Physical therapy. Possible for incontinence, but the cause seems more psychological.

H: Stop OCPs. I don't see any connection to her symptoms.

I: Psychoanalytic therapy. Seems more intensive and perhaps not the first line for this presentation.

So the most appropriate next step would be to address the anxiety. Behavioral therapy (option C) or maybe suggesting stress management techniques. Alternatively, maybe she could benefit from a discussion about stress and its physical manifestations.

Wait, but option C is behavioral therapy. That might include strategies to manage anxiety and stress, which could reduce her urinary symptoms. Alternatively, if the problem is psychological, perhaps a mental health referral is needed, but among the options given, C seems the best fit.

The patient's symptoms are stress-related, likely exacerbated by anxiety. Behavioral therapy can help manage anxiety and stress, which may alleviate her urinary issues. 

Answer: C
