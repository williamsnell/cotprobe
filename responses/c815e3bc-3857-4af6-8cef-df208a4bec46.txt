Okay, so I need to figure out how fast the Earth's surface is moving at the equator. Hmm, I remember that the Earth rotates once every 24 hours, making a full circle. So first, I should probably calculate the circumference of the Earth because that will tell me how far the surface travels in one full rotation.

Wait, the Earth's circumference at the equator is about 24,901 miles, right? Yeah, I think that's correct. So if it goes around that distance in 24 hours, then the speed would be the circumference divided by the time it takes. Let me do the math: 24,901 divided by 24. Let me see, 24,901 รท 24 equals... Well, 24 times 1,000 is 24,000, so that's 1,000 miles per hour. But wait, 24,901 minus 24,000 is 901, so that's an extra 901 miles over 24 hours. Hmm, 901 divided by 24 is roughly 37.5 miles per hour. So adding that to 1,000, that would make it about 1,037.5 mph. 

But wait, that doesn't match any of the options exactly. Let me check the options again. The options are A through J, with E being 2000 mph and I being 1000 mph. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot that the Earth's circumference is approximately 24,901 miles, but sometimes it's approximated as 24,900 for simplicity. So dividing 24,900 by 24 gives exactly 1,037.5 mph. 

Looking at the options, the closest one would be I: about 1000 miles per hour. But wait, that's only 1,000, and I calculated about 1,037.5, which is closer to 1,000 than to 2,000. But I'm a bit confused because I've heard before that the Earth's rotation speed is around 1,000 mph. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that 24,900 divided by 24 is exactly 1,037.5, so rounding that would be about 1,000 mph. 

Wait, but let me think again. If I take 24,900 miles divided by 24 hours, that is indeed 1,037.5 mph. So that's approximately 1,000 mph. Looking back at the options, option I is 1000 mph, so that's the one. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people say the speed is around 1,000 mph, but maybe I should check another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Earth's circumference is sometimes given as approximately 24,000 miles, which would make the calculation 24,000 divided by 24, which is exactly 1,000 mph. So that would make option I correct. Yeah, I think that's right.

The Earth's circumference at the equator is about 24,901 miles. To find the speed, divide this by the 24-hour rotation period, giving approximately 1,037.5 mph. The closest option is I: about 1000 miles per hour.

Answer: I
