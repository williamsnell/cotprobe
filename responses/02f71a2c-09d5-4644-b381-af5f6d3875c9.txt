Question:

With capital fixed at one unit with 1, 2, 3 units of labor added in equal successive units, production of the output increases from 300 (1 unit of labor), to 350 (2 units of labor) to 375 (3 units of labor). Which of the following is a correct interpretation?

Options:

A: This is long run constant returns to scale.
B: This is short run decreasing returns to scale.
C: This is long run increasing returns to scale.
D: This is long run decreasing returns to scale.
E: This is short run increasing returns to scale.
F: This is long run diminishing marginal productivity.
G: This is the effect of labor saturation.
H: This is due to labor specialization efficiency.
I: This is short run diminishing marginal productivity.
J: This is short run constant returns to scale.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is that capital is fixed at one unit. So, the firm is using 1 unit of capital, and they're adding labor in equal successive units—1, 2, 3 units of labor. The production output goes from 300 with 1 unit of labor, to 350 with 2 units, and then to 375 with 3 units. I need to interpret what's happening here.

First, I remember that this is about production functions and returns to scale or factors. Since capital is fixed and labor is varying, this is a short-run scenario. In the short run, only one variable factor is changing, which in this case is labor.

Looking at the output, when labor increases from 1 to 2 units, output increases by 50 units (350-300=50). Then, when labor increases from 2 to 3 units, output increases by 25 units (375-350=25). So, each additional unit of labor is adding less to the output than the previous one. That sounds like diminishing marginal productivity of labor. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Diminishing marginal productivity occurs when each additional unit of a variable input (like labor) adds less to output than the previous one, given that other inputs are fixed. So yeah, that's exactly what's happening here. The first unit of labor adds 50, the second adds 25, and so on. So the marginal product of labor is decreasing.

Now, the options are about whether this is short run or long run, and what kind of returns to scale or productivity. Since capital is fixed, this is definitely the short run, not the long run. So options A, C, D, F, G, H, J are about long run or other things, so maybe E, I, J are the possible ones.

Looking at the options:

E: This is short run increasing returns to scale. Hmm, no, because returns to scale refer to changes when all inputs are increased proportionally. Here, only labor is changing, so it's about marginal productivity, not returns to scale.

I: This is short run diminishing marginal productivity. That fits because each additional labor unit adds less output.

J: Short run constant returns to scale. No, because returns to scale aren't being discussed here—marginal productivity is.

So the correct interpretation is short run diminishing marginal productivity, which is option I.

The production function shows that as labor increases, the marginal product of labor decreases. This is an example of short run diminishing marginal productivity.
