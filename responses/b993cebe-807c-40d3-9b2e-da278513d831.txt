Okay, I need to figure out where most Kurds live. I remember that Kurds are an ethnic group primarily in the Middle East. I think they have a significant population in Turkey, but I'm not sure if that's the majority. Wait, there's also Iraq. I've heard about the Kurds in northern Iraq, like the Kurdistan region. So maybe most Kurds are in Iraq. But then again, Turkey has a large Kurdish population too. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the countries listed. The options include Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Syria, etc. I believe the largest Kurdish community is in Turkey, but the majority might be in Iraq because of the Kurdistan region being autonomous there. Or perhaps it's split between both. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the size of the populations. I think the Iraqi Kurds number around 6 million, while in Turkey, it's a larger number, maybe over 10 million. So perhaps Turkey has more Kurds. But the question is asking which country has the majority of Kurds. I'm a bit torn between A (Iraq) and H (Turkey). I think the answer is A, Iraq, because the Kurdistan region is well-known and a significant portion of Iraq's population is Kurdish. But I'm not 100% certain.
