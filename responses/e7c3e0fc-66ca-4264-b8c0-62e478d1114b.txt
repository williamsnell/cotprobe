Question:

In 1985, a widow, the undisputed owner of a cottage, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when

Options:

A: the Boy Scouts of America discovered the gift in the will.
B: the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
C: the tenant first moved into the cottage.
D: the widow left no heirs.
E: the widow died.

G: the widow first leased the cottage.
H: the Boy Scouts of America took legal action.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about property law, specifically involving adverse possession. Hmm, I remember that adverse possession is when someone gains legal ownership of land through continuous, open, and hostile use for a certain period, usually set by statute. The question is a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Let me read the scenario again. In 1985, a widow leased a cottage to a tenant for seven years. Rent was due monthly on the first of each month. A year later, in 1986, the widow died without any heirs and left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America in her will. The cottage wasn't mentioned specifically. So, the tenant found out about her death a month later and decided to stay but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts didn't know about the gift until 2009 when their attorneys did an inventory and found the claim.

The question is about when the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run. The options are A through J, with each suggesting a different starting point.

I need to think about how adverse possession works. Adverse possession typically requires the possession to be hostile, open, and continuous for the statutory period. The key here is that the possession must be adverse to the true owner. So, when did the tenant's possession become adverse to the Boy Scouts?

The widow owned the cottage and leased it to the tenant. Upon her death, the ownership passed to the Boy Scouts because she left her entire estate to them. However, the lease was an existing agreement. The tenant was still under the lease until it expired, right? So, for the first year after the widow's death, the tenant was still a lessee under the will, because the lease was still in effect.

Wait, but the lease was for seven years, starting in 1985. In 1986, the widow died. So the lease term continued until 1992, I think, unless the tenant had a right to terminate upon her death. But generally, a lease continues unless it's terminated by the parties or by law. So the tenant was still a tenant until the lease term ended, which would be 1992.

But the tenant stopped paying rent after the widow's death. That might affect things. In some jurisdictions, non-payment could lead to termination, but here, the tenant decided to remain but stopped paying. So perhaps the lease was terminated for non-payment, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the tenant's possession after the lease was no longer under the lease, but the question is about adverse possession.

Adverse possession starts when the possession is adverse to the owner's interest. The tenant was under a lease, so during the lease term, the possession wasn't adverse because the lease was a permission from the owner (the widow). Once the widow died, the Boy Scouts became the owners. But the lease was still in effect until 1992. So during the lease term, the tenant was lawfully in possession as a tenant, and thus not adverse.

After the lease expired in 1992, if the tenant continued to occupy the property without a new lease, that's when the possession might become adverse. But wait, the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986, a month after the widow's death. So perhaps the lease was terminated earlier due to non-payment. But I'm not sure; it depends on the terms of the lease and local laws.

Alternatively, maybe the tenant's belief that they had permission changed. The tenant decided to remain but stopped paying rent. So perhaps from that point, the possession became adverse because the tenant was no longer paying, implying that they were in possession without the owner's permission.

Wait, but the owner at the time of the widow's death was the Boy Scouts, but they didn't know about it until 2009. So the tenant was in possession from 1986 until when? Let me think about the timeline.

The lease was from 1985, so it ends in 1992. The widow died in 1986, so the Boy Scouts own the property from 1986 onward. The tenant stops paying rent in 1986, a month after her death. So from that point onward, the tenant is in possession without paying rent, but the lease was still in effect until 1992. So between 1986 and 1992, the tenant is still a tenant under the lease, but not paying rent.

After 1992, when the lease expired, the tenant continued to live there without a lease. At that point, the possession would be adverse because there's no lease anymore, and the tenant is staying without permission from the owner (the Boy Scouts). But the question is about when the statutory period began to run. So the period starts when the possession becomes adverse.

But wait, the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986. So from 1986 onward, the tenant was in possession without paying, but the lease was still in effect until 1992. So during the lease term, the possession wasn't adverse because it was still under the lease, even if rent wasn't paid. Adverse possession requires that the possession be hostile, meaning without the owner's permission. But during the lease term, the tenant had permission, so it's not adverse.

After the lease term ends in 1992, the tenant is still there without any lease. Now, the possession is adverse because there's no lease, and the tenant is using the property without permission. So the statutory period would start running in 1992.

But the options don't include 1992. Let me check the options again. The options are about when the period began, not the duration. So the question is, from which event did the period start.

Option E is when the widow died. So 1986. But the lease was still in effect then, so possession wasn't adverse yet. The tenant was still under the lease, so not adverse.

Option I is when the tenant discontinued paying rent. That was in 1986. But again, the lease was still in effect, so the possession wasn't adverse yet because it was still under the lease.

Option J is when the tenant believed they no longer had permission. That's subjective. Adverse possession typically requires actual or constructive knowledge of no permission, but the belief might matter. But I'm not sure if that's the starting point.

Option A is when the Boy Scouts discovered the gift in 2009. That seems too late because the statutory period is 20 years, so from 2009, 20 years would end in 2029, but the tenant has been there since 1986, so that might not make sense.

Option D is when the widow left no heirs, which is the same as when she died in 1986. But again, the lease was still in effect.

Option B is when the lease expired in 1992. At that point, the lease term ended, so the tenant's possession would no longer be under lease, and thus adverse possession could start.

Wait, but the question is about when the period began to run, not when the adverse possession claim became valid. Adverse possession requires that the possession be both adverse and continuous for the statutory period. So the period starts when the possession becomes adverse.

In this case, the possession became adverse when the lease ended in 1992 because after that, the tenant was using the property without a lease, and thus without permission from the new owner (the Boy Scouts). Alternatively, if the lease was terminated earlier due to non-payment, the adverse possession could have started earlier.

But the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986, a month after the widow's death. If the lease was terminated for non-payment, then the tenant's possession became adverse from that point. But I'm not sure if non-payment alone would terminate the lease. It might give the landlord the right to terminate, but if the landlord (widow's estate) didn't act, maybe the lease continued.

Alternatively, the tenant's belief that they no longer had permission (option J) could be when the adverse possession started. But the belief has to be a reasonable one. The tenant learned of the widow's death and decided to stay but stopped paying rent, which might indicate that they thought they had permission, or perhaps not.

Wait, the lease was with the widow. After her death, the lease continues unless it's terminated. The tenant decided to remain but stopped paying rent. So perhaps from that point, the tenant was in possession without a lease, making it adverse.

But the lease was still in effect until 1992. So during that time, the tenant was still a tenant, so not adverse. After 1992, the lease ends, and the tenant is still there without a lease, so that's when the adverse possession period starts.

But looking at the options, option B is when the lease expired. So the period would start in 1992. But the options don't have 1992; the options are events, not years.

Wait, the question is when the statutory period began to run. So the period starts when the tenant's possession becomes adverse to the owner's interest.

In this case, the owner was the Boy Scouts from 1986 onward. The tenant was under a lease until 1992. So possession wasn't adverse until after the lease ended. Therefore, the statutory period began running in 1992 when the lease expired.

Looking at the options, option B is "the tenant's lease with the widow expired." That would be 1992. So the period began then.

But wait, the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986, which might mean that the lease was terminated earlier. If the lease was terminated for non-payment, then the period would start in 1986. But I'm not sure if non-payment alone terminates the lease. It might depend on the terms of the lease and the law. If the lease required rent to be paid on the first of each month, and the tenant stopped paying, the landlord could terminate the lease. But the landlord here was the widow's estate, which was the Boy Scouts. But the Boy Scouts didn't know about the gift until 2009. So perhaps the lease wasn't terminated because the new owners didn't take action until then.

Alternatively, maybe the lease was still in effect until 1992, so the possession wasn't adverse until then.

So, considering all that, the period began running when the lease expired in 1992, which is option B.

The statutory period for adverse possession began to run when the tenant's lease with the widow expired, as this is when the tenant's possession became adverse to the Boy Scouts of America's ownership interest.

Answer: B
