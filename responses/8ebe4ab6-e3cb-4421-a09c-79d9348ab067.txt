Okay, so George has $500 in an account that earns 8% interest, compounded quarterly. He's leaving it for five years, and I need to figure out how much he'll have. Hmm, I remember from my finance class that compound interest involves the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Let me think about each part.

P is the principal, which is $500. The interest rate is 8%, so r is 0.08. It's compounded quarterly, so n is 4 because there are four quarters in a year. The time t is 5 years.

So plugging into the formula: A = 500*(1 + 0.08/4)^(4*5). Let me calculate step by step.

First, 0.08 divided by 4 is 0.02. Adding 1 gives 1.02. Then, 4 times 5 is 20. So the exponent is 20.

Now, 500 multiplied by (1.02)^20. I need to calculate (1.02)^20. I don't remember the exact value, but I can approximate it or think about the formula. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it step by step, but that might take too long. Wait, perhaps I can remember that (1.02)^20 is approximately 1.4859. Let me check that number. I think it's around there. So 500 times 1.4859 is 500 * 1.4859 = let's see, 500*1 is 500, 500*0.4859 is about 242.95, so total is 742.95. That would be approximately $742.95.

Looking at the options, option I is $742.97, which is very close. So the answer should be option I.

The correct approach uses the compound interest formula:

**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**

Where:
- **P** = $500
- **r** = 8% = 0.08
- **n** = 4 (compounded quarterly)
- **t** = 5 years

Plugging in the numbers:

**A = 500*(1 + 0.08/4)^(4*5)**
**A = 500*(1.02)^20**
**A â‰ˆ 500 * 1.4859 = $742.95**

The closest option is **I: $742.97**.
