Okay, so I need to figure out what the traditional 20th wedding anniversary gift is. I'm a bit rusty on my anniversary traditions, but I'll try to remember what I know.

I remember that each anniversary has a traditional gift associated with it, and these can vary by culture and tradition. For example, the first anniversary is paper, the fifth is wood, and so on. But I'm not sure about the 20th. Let me think about the materials and what they symbolize.

I think the 20th anniversary is sometimes called the "china" anniversary. I've heard people refer to it that way before. But wait, isn't that the 12th? Or maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Oh, no, I think the 12th is actually the 12th, but maybe the 20th is a different material.

I also recall that some anniversaries have gemstones. For example, the 25th is a silver jubilee, and the 50th is gold. So maybe the 20th has a different gem. Let me list out what I remember:

- 1st: Paper
- 5th: Wood
- 10th: Tin or Aluminum
- 15th: Crystal
- 20th: Hmm, I'm not sure. I think it's either china or something else.

Wait, I've heard that the traditional gift for 20 years is china, because it's a long time and the material is durable, symbolizing the strength of the marriage. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the 12th anniversary, which I think is actually called the "china" anniversary. Or maybe the 20th is something else.

Another possibility is that the 20th anniversary is associated with the gemstone "emerald." Emerald is a beautiful green gem, and it's often linked with love and rebirth. I'm not sure if that's the traditional gift, though. Let me think. I think the 20th is traditionally china, but maybe in some traditions, it's emerald.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to recall. I think the 20th is definitely china, but I've also heard that the 20th anniversary is sometimes referred to as the "china" anniversary. So looking back at the options, the choices are:

A: silver
B: emerald
C: pearl
D: diamond
E: leather
F: sapphire
G: ruby
H: paper
I: china
J: gold

So the options include both china and emerald. I'm trying to decide which one is correct. From what I remember, the 20th is traditionally associated with china. However, emerald is a gemstone that's sometimes linked with the 20th in some cultures, but I think the traditional gift is china.

Wait, another thought: I think the 20th anniversary is called the "china" anniversary because the material represents the idea of something that's been around for a long time and is still standing, like fine china that's used over the years. So I think the correct answer is I: china.

But wait, I've also heard that the 20th is sometimes associated with the emerald gemstone. Let me check that. Oh, maybe it's not the traditional gift but a modern one. I think the traditional gift is china, and the modern is emerald. So in the options, I is china, and B is emerald. The question is about the traditional gift, so I think the answer is I: china.
