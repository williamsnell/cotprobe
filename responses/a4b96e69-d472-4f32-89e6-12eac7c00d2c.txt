Question:

When a swimmer leaves cold water on a warm, breezy day, he experiences a cooling effect. Why?

Options:

A: The cold water causes a decrease in the swimmer's metabolic rate.
B: The swimmer feels cold due to the temperature difference.
C: Evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin cools the body down.
D: The swimmer feels cold due to the wind chill factor.
E: The swimmer's body is adapting to the water temperature after exiting.
F: The water removes heat from the swimmer's body.
G: The sun's rays are less effective on the swimmer's wet skin.
H: The water on the swimmer's body freezes.
I: The breeze makes the swimmer feel cold.
J: The swimmer's body temperature drops below normal.

Okay, so I've got this question about why a swimmer feels a cooling effect when they leave cold water on a warm, breezy day. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me break it down.

First, the scenario: the swimmer is in cold water, then gets out into a warm, breezy environment. They feel cool after getting out. Why is that?

Let me think about what happens when you get out of the water. The water was cold, so when you exit, your skin is probably wet. Now, the air is warm and breezy. So the breeze is moving air across the swimmer's skin.

I remember that when water evaporates, it takes heat away from the body. That's why sweating cools you down. So maybe the evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin is causing the cooling effect. That would make sense because the water on the skin is evaporating, which requires heat, thus cooling the body.

Looking at the options:

Option C says evaporation from the skin cools the body. That seems likely. But let me check the others to be sure.

Option A talks about metabolic rate. I don't think that's it because the question is about the immediate cooling effect, not a long-term change in metabolism.

Option B is about temperature difference. While the water is cold and the air is warm, the swimmer just got out, so their body is reacting. But why exactly? It's more about the process than just the temp difference.

Option D is wind chill factor. Wind chill makes it feel colder than it is by increasing heat loss through convection. But in this case, the day is warm and breezy, so the wind chill might not be the main factor because the actual air temperature is warm.

Option E is about adapting to the water temperature. That's more about acclimatization over time, not the immediate cooling effect after exiting.

Option F says the water removes heat from the body. Wait, when the swimmer was in the water, the cold water was removing heat. But when they get out, the water is no longer in contact. So F doesn't explain the cooling after exiting.

Option G is about the sun's rays being less effective on wet skin. That could be a factor, but the question mentions a breezy day, not necessarily sunny. Plus, the main effect here is probably the evaporation due to the breeze.

Option H is about freezing, which doesn't make sense because the water is cold but not necessarily freezing, and the day is warm.

Option I says the breeze makes them feel cold. Well, the breeze itself can cause cooling through convection, but the main cooling effect when wet is evaporation.

Option J is body temperature dropping below normal. That's more of a result rather than the reason for the cooling effect.

So putting it together, the evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin is the main reason. So the correct answer should be C.

The swimmer feels cool because the water on their skin evaporates, which removes heat from the body. This process is known as evaporative cooling. 

Answer: C
